Easiest way to peel a butternut squash:
- Lay on side
- Cut into two halves, separating the "large ball" at the bottom from the "tube" at the top.
- Cut the bottom from the large ball so you have two parallel flat surfaces. Stand the ball on one flat face. Cut slices of skin off, from top to bottom, following the contour of the ball as you make each cut.
- Cut the top from the tube. Stand on one flat end. Cut slices of skin, from top to bottom.
- Only after both pieces are peeled - cut each half in half (top to bottom) to expose seeds, which you scrape out and discard.

Not sure I'd roast butternut squash any other way after making this basic, non-fussy recipe. Winning recipes almost always begin with fresh ingredients and a little seasoning to enhance and complement. This is a winner. Easy to prepare, quick to roast, easy to serve and eat, pretty on the plate, and delicious. I simply added a little fresh chopped parsley to pretty it up.

How incredibly simply perfect.  Really top notch!  By the way, the easiest way to peel a butternut squash is with a plain old vegetable peeler.  Peel it, then cut off the ends, slice down the middle, scrape out the goosh and seeds and then chop it up per your recipe instructions.  Easy peezy!

Peeling tip: Before peeling, wash and poke holes in the squash, then put it in the microwave for 3 minutes. After it cools down a bit, you can easily cut and peel it.

Simplest way to prepare a butternut or any other tough skinned squash is to roast it for 15 minutes, at about 150C, then you can cut it like butter, and the skin comes off very easily!




Another useful tip, to stop raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, grapes etc  from going mouldy!
When you get them home, rinse them in a bowl of water to which you add 2-3Tbs vinegar-any type. Swish very gently, then drain throughly. They don't need rinsing, but you can if you like-then they will keep in the fridge for a week maybe more!

YUM!  This was delicious.

First of all, to the poster who recommended poking holes with a fork and microwaving the squash for 3 minutes, you are a genius of the highest order whom I shall worship for the remainder of my cooking life.  I was trying to explain to my boyfriend how hard it is to peel butternut squash, and I equated it to cutting down a tree with a butter knife - this tip made the job SOOOO easy.  I love you, wonderful poster.

This recipe was so easy and so good.  I made three small changes - I added petite red skinned potatoes to the mix (cut the same size as the squash), added some fresh thyme and roasted the veggies just a bit longer - 40 minutes instead of 25.  

I couldn't stop drooling and neither could my BF.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Oh, and it tasted great the next day, too.  Yum.

I have roasted butternut squash for vegetable soup recently but I had purchased one from the local farmer's market and needed a side dish with some (soy sauce/lemon juice/garlic/brown sugar) marinaded chicken breasts I planned on grilling.  I removed the skin of the squash and then cubed it.  Then I tossed it with the fresh ground pepper, drizzle of olive oil (probably closer to 1 tblspn), coarse sea salt and minced garlic.  I prepped it around 11am and stuck it in the fridge.  Come dinner time I pulled it out, placed it on a baking sheet lined with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was delicious.  I told my 3 year old son how a local "FARMER" had grown it just for him to eat and he gobbled it up.  Eat great Fall veggies until you are so tired of them and then do it all again next fall.  They are nutritious and delicious and cost effective when in season.  I paid $2.00 for a large squash that will roll over to another meal.  ENJOY!!!  This one is going in the cookbook under "Side dishes" : )

I substituted cinnamon/sugar butter in place of olive oil and garlic in the recipe just because i thought the flavor would go better with the rest of our meal.  It was awesome and easy!!!!  Love it.

I rarely write reviews.  This recipe is spectacular.  You don't need cream sauces, pastas, curries, sugary stuff, rum, chilis, or any other fancy ingredients.  They only add calories and mask the squash's flavor.  Use this simple recipe with high quality ingredients - a quality olive oil, Sea Salt, fresh garlic and freshly ground pepper.  For easy peeling, purchase a large, sharp vegetable peeler - the kind for bigger vegetables, not carrots -  at any grocery store.  Sharpen your knife, and prep will be much easier. The sweet, delicate flavor of roasted squash will shine through to reward you in minutes.  Purchase a squat squash without a long "neck" - more "meat" and fewer seeds make cubing easier and result in more squash.   I cube a big squash all at once and store the remaining cubes in a good quality produce keeper for more delicious meals later.  Thank you MChele for the great submission.

this was a great recipe! my husband ate it too, and he doesn't eat very many vegetables. an easy way to cut and peel the squash is to put it whole in the microwave for a minute, then let it sit in there for at least another minute. another thing i found out was to make sure you peel the squash below the "green lines" on it. you will know what i mean just as soon as you start peeling it you will see them.  thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Super simple and delicious. I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and it was perfect. Served with Oven Fried Chicken III for a semi-healthy comfort food meal.

I agree that peeling the squash requires some elbow grease, but I really do think that I like the texture a bit better than roasting it in the skin and scooping it out (which is probably just a quirk of mine.)  Anyway, I love this recipe!  My sister and I like to make it for Thanksgiving, but after receiving several in my CSA basket, I made it for a side in my "eat up the veggies" supper.  I added some parsley that I also got and sprinkled on some parmesan when it came out of the oven.  Great flavor and easy once you get that squash peeled.  It might be hard, but you'll have a tasty dish and amazing arms :)

Awesome! The flavor surpassed my expectations.  I am used to eating roasted butternut squash salted and buttered heavily.  This flavor was so much better. The recipe was very easy and gave an incredible aroma as the squash roasted.  The lightly crunchy tops of the cubes of squash made the dish perfect.  I'll be making this frequently!

Like other reviewers, I found the squash a pain to peel, despite following the reviewer's tip to microwave it before peeling.  However, the cooked squash was so delicious that I'm looking forward to making it again.
Update:  I made this again, with a couple modifications that (IMHO) made it even better:  I put the cubed squash, salt, pepper, 2 T. oil, and minced garlic in a bag ***along with 3 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar***.  Then gave it a good shake to combine ingredients and poured it onto a shallow baking sheet sprayed lightly with Pam.  I baked it 30 minutes, since we like it soft.  The result was delicious.  The balsamic vinegar was wonderful with the squash.

I make this frequently and it is a major hit every time.    I sprinkle toasted pepita seeds (toss raw seeds lightly in olive oil, add salt, and toast in a skillet while constantly stirring until slightly brown) on top right before serving or just put them in the table for use by those who wish to add them.  

It adds a great crunch and a nice salty compliment to the sweetness for roasted butternut squash.  Enjoy!

For easiest peeling of butternut squash, a GOOD peeler such as the inexpensive Kuhn Rikon swiss peeler on Amazon (3 for $10!) works like a charm, just like peeling potatoes.  Really.  

Tried the recipe tonight, yum!

Delicious! Try spraying the pan with Pam so that squash doesn't stick. Cook a bit longer if you like yours crunchy (10-15 minutes more).

Made exactly as directed and loved it. It's gluten, soy, dairy and sugar free as well as no MSGs, aspartame etc. Perfect for detoxing and reducing inflamation. It's so simple anyone can make it (after pealing the squash??). I'll try some of the suggestions for pealing the squash next time. And there will be a next time.

I am not a big vegetable fan so I am always looking for ways to make them taste better. This recipe is simple and really brings out the sweetness of the squash without being mushy. Quick, easy, yummy, and healthy!

Great as written.  I did use fresh squash that was already precut to save myself some time; I would recommend NOT  using frozen squash as it becomes mushy when roasted.

My new favorite way of preparing butternut squash.  Added Chipotle seasoning to the recipe as this was a side dish for a southern meal.

VERY tasty, it was a hit with the family.  I did sprinkle the pieces with dried rosemary and it was great.

This turned out great! Only thing i did different was when it was almost done (had 5 minutes left) i put it under the broiler for 3-4 minutes or till very slightly charred on the edges. Delicious!

Added this to a quick saute of onions, red pepper, dried cherries, and 1/3 c chicken stock + 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp coriander. Served over quinoa- big, big hit.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity.  I cooked my squash using my Traeger grill set at 400.  I also covered the squash with ground cinnamon.
Tasted amazing.

To make Butternut Squash easier to peel, simply put in microwave for approx 30-35 seconds.

Delicious recipe.  My only suggestion would be to pierce the skin of the squash and put it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Peels very easily with a potato peeler using this method.

So simple and delicious, just remember to flip the squash halfway through cooking so it browns on all sides. I topped it with sunflower seeds for extra texture.

Growing up in New England, Butternut Squash was on our table at holidays. It was always fixed mashed with cinnamon and butter. This is even better and healthier. Will make again. I always microwave any hard squash for a couple of minutes cut off the ends and with a sharp knife slice down the sides.

I actually LOVE garlic and used about 6 cloves and used more olive oil as well.  This was amazing!!  I will definitely make it again very, VERY soon.  Maybe even tomorrow.  The kids all loved it.  I used a dark coated pizza pan and the side of the squash that touched the pan came out nicely crisp and carmelized.  Excellent recipe.  And simple.

Made the squash last night, it was awesome. Found easiest way to peel it, but at Cosco!.  Peeled and cubed, price is pretty good for the amount of meals you can get out of that one container

Easy, reliable recipe. Seasonings and spices can easily be changed due to taste preferences.  DH and I enjoy ours more savory, but DD likes hers drizzled with maple syrup. Roasting brings out the subtle flavors in the squash and provides a lovely way to enjoy as a stand-alone side dish, or as a component in a main dish.

I used a tip of poking holes with a fork, then microwaving the whole squash for 3 minutes to make peeling easier.  I then seasoned and roasted as directed and it was delicious.  Mine never got truly crispy, but I think I used too much oil.

I don't know if it speaks to the quality of my squash but I used a good sharp vegetable peeler on the skin, easy peasy.

Easy way to peel - Swissmar serrated peeler. Set of 3 for $18 - not to give them a plug, but these peelers are incredibly sharp and very handy. Don't let their colorful, plastic appearance fool you. After peeling it seems to be much easier to cut through the squash too. This recipe is my "go-to" now, wouldn't make any other way!

Pretty much the easiest recipe I have tried for squash and pretty much the best. You can customize and vary it easily. This recipe should be named 'Simple Roasted WINTER Squash,' as I use it with whatever winter squash I have on hand and it works equally well. I do use only 1 tbsp olive oil, though. I thought it was too oily with 2. I toss everything in a zip lock bag; much easier than a bowl.

This was my first time cooking butternut squash and I don't know why I've waited all these years!  It was so flavorful and delicious.  I know a lot of people recommend cooking with brown sugar, but this recipe kept the natural sweetness from roasting without becoming too sweet or overpowering.  I plan to make this at least once a week all winter!

It was my first time eating butternut squash. I'm so glad I found this recipe. It was very tasty. It may just be my oven but I cooked it 10 minutes longer to get a crispier squash.

I had never had butternut squash before trying this recipe and was really doubtful that I'd like it but it was great! I'd definitely use this recipe again! Try adding red onion, Brussel sprouts and red peppers! (Or any veggie you love) O.M.G..so good!!

Everyone enjoyed eating this dish. Even the kids enjoyed the taste. The only thing I added was a few teaspoons of butter. We have tried other butternut recipes in the past and had to throw it out for lack of taste. I am sure we will make this one again.

Yummy squash dish. I used too much salt - it was a small butternut squash. But at any rate I'll use just 1/2 tsp. salt next time. Thanks MChele

Surprisingly good and easy to make.  For me, it's easiest to peel it whole then to cut off the bulbous portion, slice that in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.  I made this a day ahead of time for Thanksgiving; stored them on the cold balcony in the serving chafer, then a couple of hours before serving just popped the chafer on the stand to heat it up.  Everyone loved it - even those who didn't previously care for butternut squash!  Thank you for this easy, delicious recipe.

I decided to try this after picking up a pre-cubed butternut squash at the store. From the other reviews it sounds like cubing it yourself can be quite the adventure, so I'm glad I already had it done for me! I was a bit disappointed with the flavor of this recipe; I think cooking the garlic in the oil before tossing it with the squash and roasting would have improved it immensely, as even after half and hour in the oven the garlic still had a bit of a raw edge to it.

I've got to say this is most likely a good recipe. This was the first time I had tried butternut squash. I think it tasted a lot like pumpkin which I didn't like. If I ever try butternut squash again I'll go with a sweet recipe instead. It came out tender but was difficult to cut and peel. I don't know if it is worth all the effort.

Great and easy! I bought frozen butternut squash that was already cubed, so I just defrosted them, added the mixture, and stuck them in the oven.

I just want to let one of the reviewers how to peal an egg corn squash.  Just get your carrot peeler out and just peel the whole thing and then cut in half and take the seeds out and then just start slicing and  dicing. It works wonders.
Enjoy your cooking.

I find that the simplest recipes end up being the best and this is one won't disappoint! As for cutting up a butternut squash, I always, always, always use a vegetable peeler first! This minimizes the chance of me losing a finger. :-)

I really like this recipe. Butternut squash can be so bland, this really takes it up a notch. It's also extremely easy, but I do advise going heavy on the garlic, or you'll be disappointed. I'm also experimenting with ginger and other spices. This has now become one of my go to recipes for an easy and relatively quick way to produce a vegetable dish.

I tried it with one clove of garlic and I thought it was still too strong.  Kids definitely didn't like it.  I like garlic don't get me wrong just not sure it works well with butternut squash.  I'll try something with more cinnamon flavor next time.

This is a no fail easy way to make Butternut Squash.  I followed the simple directions and it turned out perfectly! Great side dish to bring to Thanksgiving.  Next time I will experiment meet with other seasoning to punch up the flavor.

Super recipe!! Simple but supremely tasty. Hardest part is preparing the squash itself. I've found if you pierce the skin several times and microwave it for 5 minutes, then use a vegetable peeler to skin it - well, makes a difficult job MUCH easier. Try it, you'll like it!!

This dish turned out decently for me, but it was a little bland. Although my guests enjoyed it, I thought it was lacking a punch of flavor. I may try to add some additional seasoning if I make it again.

I am the only one in my house that ‘likes’ squash so I decided to try this recipe out on my family. I purchased already cubed butternut squash at the grocery store to save time. My family loved it! Even I was surprised how fabulous this dish was since it was so simple and easy to make! Definitely a new regular addition to the dinner table.

Excellent! I peeled the squash prior to roasting. Also cubed it, and near the end of cooking time added a wee bit (maybe a tablespoon) of butter. Perfect

I lay the squash on its side and use a peeler before cutting it open - works great.

My son called my daughter at college to complain that mom was making roasted butternut squash for dinner.  The same child was standing over the baking tray, eating the last of the crispy, caramelized bits a half hour later.   I think we have a winner.  My only complaint was that I was going to make soup with the leftovers and now I have to go buy and peel another squash.  I did cook mine a bit longer so the bottoms got all crisp and wonderful.  But otherwise, it's a simple way to prepare a fall side dish.

This is an old standby, but sometimes I like to add a little sliced onion and just a sprinkle of fresh thyme. It's a great alternative to roasted sweet potato, and it's even delicious when added to cooked quinoa, topping with a bit of fresh vinaigrette, and making a lovely cold side salad or luncheon dish.

This recipe is perfect on it's own, or great as a base if you want to add spices. I added just a little bit of cumin last time I made it and my family loved it.  It's my go-to recipe for any winter squash because it's simple and comes out great every time!

Wowee! Delicious. Sea salt and olive oil all the way. I only chopped the garlic. Garlic made this wonderful.

Tasty. I really did not know what to do with a butternut squash, whether to go the sweet or savory route. This hit the spot with a roast chicken and green beans. I just eyeballed the measurements but did not add or change anything.

Easy and good the butternut squash has a natural sweet flavor. I used a sharp vegetable peeler and it was as easy as peeling an apple. I cut the top and bottom off with a knife.

easiest way to peel a butternut: Microwave it on HI power for a minute or so. Skin gets as soft as a potato.

I make this all the time as a side dish.  I'm on a low-carb diet and this is such a great option when potatoes are out of the picture!  Made them for Passover last year and the whole family went crazy!  It's so easy and you can use any type of seasoning you like.  One friend likes to make these using a Cajun blend, another likes it with nutmeg and cinnamon.  It's soooo great!

Needed another 10 minutes of roasting time for our preference. We all liked it, but felt it was lacking.....something. Will make again and add more seasoning.

This was a big hit for my family!  It reminds us of sweet potato fries.  The smaller pieces cook a lot faster than the larger ones, so time adjustments may need to be made or just cut the cubes in smaller pieces.

I have used this recipe several times and my husband and son love it! Our son is 12 months and he loves it. I hold the salt in his batch though. The only thing that I would change is the prep time. I had to get a new peeler because it took FOREVER with my old one. Depending on the size of the squash, it takes me about 20+ minutes to peel it. This will be a staple for us now.

Simple and tasty.  Next time I will do 1.5 TBS. of olive oil and one clove of garlic for our taste b/c I thought it was a little overpowering to the natural flavor of the squash.

Nobody in our house had ever tried butternut squash... So, I picked one up and decided on this recipe for our first try. Since there isn't a lot added to it. I thought we could get a good idea of the natural flavor.....Its a winner to the point my 13yr old picked up 2 and put them in the basket and offered to peel them if I cooked them again...(I have bad wrist) LOVE IT. THANK YOU if they were easier to peel im sure I would want it even more

So yummy! I've been wanting to try butternut squash, but I get scared of baked squashes because they get too mushy and the flavor that I'm not a huge fan of comes out. This way, they taste more like bites of potatoes and I love, love the garlic flavor! Will definitely make this again! (I added extra garlic, too.)

I was excited, but this looked better than it tasted. I ended up stirring in some pancake syrup after the cooking was done and that was an improvement for the palates of my family. I might consider baking it with some brown sugar next time.

Great with a couple cut up potatoes thrown in too. Use Rosemary, salt, fresh ground pepper, parsley, and garlic.

Perfect.  I adjusted it one time with a few simple things: toss it a few times during roasting, last few minutes sprinkle with parmesan cheese and stick under broiler.  This gives it a nice caramelized glaze & flavor.

This was amazing!! This was my first time trying a squash other than acorn squash and I'm really excited to make this again. However with that being said, this is a pain to peel!! There has got to be an easier way to do it. Any ideas?

I've been making a recipe like this for years.  Microwaving the whole squash for a minute or so makes it easier to peel.

Love butternut squash always look for new twists. Fabulous I found using the organic already cut into cubes is just as good, much easier. Now I only buy the whole butternut squash when I am going to bake and serve in the shell. This recipe was a hit.

Absolutely delicious. Easy to peel with a regular peeler, than dice and follow directions. Next time I will cook a tad bit longer...the crisp side of the squash was my favorite. My kids and my husband devoured this dish. Yum!

It is a little more effort to peel and cube the squash before roasting, but it has the benefit of cooking faster than the more traditional way of baking the squash in its skin. I also like that the spicing is designed to enhance rather than mask the flavour of the squash.

First time to cook butternut squash.  When I tried to peel it, it was so difficult I though perhaps it was not ripe enough.  So, I cut it in quarters, covered it with plastic wrap and threw it in the microwave for 8 minutes, let it sit and then peeled, cubed and roasted it. Since I am not a big garlic fan, I only used one clove.  It came out so good even my husband said it was good.

This was yummy and so simple! I tossed the squash in EVOO and spread out on a baking sheet. Then I sprinkled salt and Italian seasoning over top. I left out the garlic, but I'm sure that would be good too.

This was a first time for us - never had butternut squash before.  I was lucky to find some pre-peeled at the market as they look tough to get the skin off.  This was a very simple recipe and I enjoyed using basic ingredients.  Simple, tasty and such a nice addition to a plate of ribs!  We will be enjoying this recipe again.

This was delicious!  So simple & easy, don't need many ingredients & what you do need you have on hand.  I used already cubed squash & let it marinate in the olive oil/garlic mixture for an hour or so before roasting.  Only took 25 min. for me, roasted on a stone pan, turned out perfect!

This was just what I was looking for-a quick and easy way to cook a butternut squash. I cut it up pretty small then just dumped it on the sheet and cooked for maybe 15 minutes (I think my oven runs hot). So easy and delicious.

Previous comments stated the recipe was runny so I added the rice along with 1/2 cup of water right away.  I also added a package of taco seasoning.  Makes about 1/2 a large crock pot.  

DELICIOUS!!!!

Good flavor and texture with this recipe.  My honey who doesn't like squash even liked it.
Once the squash is peeled it's easy peasy!

I did make a change to the recipe by adding a red onion and cayenne pepper.  Really kicked it up a notch. Definitely making it again.

A WINNER!!! E-Z!!!  Squash is easy to peel, seed and cube.  Use different spices for variety, eg -- nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon. Healthy.  It is a regular dish here.

Simple and delicious! I added a dusting of cinnamon and a drizzle of maple syrup. The middle of the chunks is soft and tender, the edges are crispy and sweet.

I made this with a few alterations for the air fryer.  Only 1 TBSP olive oil. Preheated airfryer on 400 for about 3 minutes.  Then added squash and cooked for 17 minutes, shaking basket every 5 minutes or so.  Turned out great!

So easy and delicious!  I like it better without the garlic -- I think it fights with the sweetness of the squash.  But either way, this is a great easy recipe!

It’s good. I added a bit extra garlic, but I do that for everything. I think it needs a longer cooking time than the recipe calls for. For everyone who is complaining about it being hard to peel, I didn’t have any trouble and my good peeler was dirty. I just cut it in half with the ball part separated from the cylinder shaped part, then cut each half in half lengthwise and peeled. I had no troubles with it.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! Butternut squash is quickly becoming my favorite vegetable. (I just discovered it last month or so.)

I got tired of peeling it, so I left the peel on half of it. It was just as tasty, even though it had a slightly different texture. Totally worth leaving on! Even my husband didn't mind.

This recipe needed absolutely no changes, unless your personal tastes are significantly different.  I was amazed at how easy this was and, if you are fortunate enough to live in an area that sells it, you can take the lazy way and buy the squash already peeled and chopped (well worth it in my opinion).  The baking time was precise and my only fault was in not turning them halfway through.  The food was still delicious but I think I could have ensured more even browning and prevented any possibility of sticking... that is not required to make this an excellent dish.

IF you've got arthritis and can't hack up a whole squash, roast it partially or all the way first. Cut a head of garlic in half, put oil on the top, wrap it in foil and roast it along with the whole squash....if you want the garlic with it. Only "mess" is removing the seeds and rind.

I've made this several times. It's so good. But it always sticks to my non stick cookie sheet.  Question: What am I doing wrong? I made it as is, more oil, less oil, garlic, no garlic. Help.   Oh. When I put it on foil, it stick to the foil! Really?

Wow, this is such an easy way to cook the squash!  Cooked up so nice, as per recipe.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and my family devoured the whole tray!  Son was never a real squash eater.....he loved it!  Thank you for another amazing recipe!

Too hard to peel and cut... Might have had a squash that was unripe.
It tasted good, though. Would have seasoned with a bit more....
Maybe next year, I'll look for a ripe squash.

Delicious! I used minced garlic in a jar instead of garlic cloves. It tasted wonderful and saved me a few minutes! Thanks for the recipe!

I replaced some ingredients. use no salt ,garlic, onion & sprinkled tops with  spicy Paprika,  used Evoo spray & parchment paper for easier clean up. I also pealed the Squash,since I cant digest the skin. Cooking time was about the same. Drizzled Evoo over at the end before putting in Broiler for 3 to 5 mins. Enjoyed the dish along with my Trukey meat loaf.

I am a senior citizen and live, of course, in a senior citizen's home.  And, I, not really good at cooking just for one, share. They LOVED IT!!
I added to the mix in a bowl, a little of Tone's 6 peppers and ground cinnamon, salt and a dash of black pepper.  Increased the cooking time to 45 minutes (to darken just a bit), 
When cooled, I made sure none were sticking to the pan, then stuck a tooth pick into each one, making the perfect finger-style  food for others to enjoy.

I bought a small butternut squash since only one person had eaten it before.  Prepared and baked as instructed and it received rave reviews from most of the diners.  It was done and tender in the time noted.  A great recipe for winter dining and may try the sweet version in the future.

This is my go to recipe for roasted butternut squash. I change up the spices every time and today, along with garlic I added minced onion, celery seed, basil, thyme, turmeric, marjoram, salt and pepper. It's just as tasty with just garlic, salt and pepper.

So simple! And great tips on peeling! I warmed in the microwave after poking holes for two minutes, let it cool then peeled and cut into one inch chunks. Second time I made this, I tossed in some sweet potatoes, substituted butter for oil and added thyme and parsley. Absolute perfection. Will be adding into our regular fall sides rotation!

made exactly as the recipe said, except for a dash of red pepper flakes.  I didn't measure, just dashed in. I thought I accidentally put too much black pepper in, but omg, it was delicious.  We couldn't stop munching on it before the main dish was ready.  Excellent.

Simple easy recipe that tasted nice the saltiness mixed with the natural sweetness of the squash!  I also sprinkled  garlic powder before cooking and it gave the squash a crispiness that was great. I wouldnt boil it first for easy skin removal  as cutting the skin with a sharp knife was not too bad.

Thank you! My husband loves butternut squash, I made it a few times last year, but would've loved to have made it more... all that I could ever find was recipes where they were adding sugar and cinnamon. I'm just not a fan of the sweetened recipe. This was perfect!

So simple but delicious.  I've made this many times and even had a friend call for the recipe as they wanted to impress some guests.

Easy, fast, everyone loved it. I added a little bit of nutmeg and a little pit of pumpkin spice, parsley and parmigiana before roasting.

New to butternut squash, but I thought why not. We need more veggies! The meal was prepared and my husband had his nose turned up until I asked him to try it. Now, he's requesting this item  frequently. Thank you.

Easy and delicious way to prepare butternut squash.  I prepared exactly as the recipe states, and my finicky husband had three servings before asking me to always make this in the future!  Am cooking some right now.

Its so simple. Enhances the flavor instead of hiding it. In Fall I harvest and process a lot of butternut (my favorite) squash, and other  kinds. I peel, chop, blanch and freeze. Ready for any recipe.

The recipe was so easy and a really wanted to like it, but it was just OK. Visually, it looked wonderful out of the oven, but both my wife and I kind of got tired of eating before the meal was over. Probably won't make again.

First time cooking butternut squash.  It makes a good side dish but definitely needs something else for flavor.  Took the whole 30 minutes just to become tender; I'm thinking I maybe should've kept it in the oven longer.

Very good. Even though I followed the recipe exactly, I don’t think it needs the garlic. It took approximately 50 minutes to cook in my oven. I used Reynolds release foil which made nothing stick. Even my husband who does not care for squash tried a piece and then wanted more.

Made using precut squash. Roasted closer to an hour because of the other food I was making, and it still turned out good. Felt it was missing a little something, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Might add a bit of paprika or cinnamon, depending on my mood and what I'm cooking, next time.

I love this recipe and so did my family.  No leftovers here.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They were not ready to eat immediately when it was ready so I just left it in the oven for 20 more min at 200 and it was still delicious and did effect the taste at all.

I love these!  My only change was to not bake quite so long to preserve some body to the cubes, and to sub a light touch of Jamaican jerk seasoning instead of using garlic.  I actually added these colorful squash cubes to a bowl of Lima bean and buttered corn - it was pretty and tasty for company!

Very good, once I peeled the squash it was a very easy side.  I liked it but I'll try brown sugar and butter next time.

Delicious! ?? I think I’ll make this again. It’s difficult cutting through a butternut squash before you cook it though.

Everyone loves it. We made it with acorn squash (w medium) which we eat with the peels on, as always used extra garlic, and I roasted it right at the top of the oven for better browning.

I made it exactly by the recipe, and it was fine.  After taking it out of the oven and tasting it, I melted a little butter and poured over it to give it an extra boost of flavor.  I'll definitely make it again.

Only made one change.  Ghee has a higher smoke point plus it tastes like butter so I melted some and used that as my oil.  Delicious recipe and a keeper!

I didn't have any garlic, so I used garlic powder, and after reading some of the  other reviews, I decided to add potatoes and onions.  I definitely used too much olive oil, but it still turned out very delicious, and made my whole apartment smell nice.  Very simple and easy to prepare.

Great, Simple Recipe!!  I melted butter in the microwave with the garlic in it.  Then poured the butter along with the olive oil all over the squash, mixed it together, and then placed in the oven.

Absolitly the best way to eat butternut.  You can taste the squash so much better.  No butter needed and much healthier.  
Way to squash it Allrecipes...another good one.

Easy and yummy! I bought the cut up squash at Trader Joe’s so it was a breeze. Great left over too!

This recipe is truly perfect as is! It’s a chilly fall day here today and I plan on making this recipe and pairing it with roasted lemon chicken, steamed green beans and cranberry sauce for a comfort dinner that will warm us all up! 

This is how I’ve made my butternut squash for years and my family goes crazy when they smell it cooking. The squash will make your home smell absolutely delicious!

I sprinkled cinnamon over the squash instead of garlic. Fantastic either as a vegetable, dessert, or addition to store bought pumpkin soup. Simply delicious!

Super easy and tastes great. I’d been looking for a butternut squash recipe for a while that was quick. I’ll probably make this a regular side dish in my house.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and Easy! Only thing I changed was stirring them after 30 minutes and adding an extra 20 minutes of roasting! I will make them again.

Wow! Oh. My. Goodness! I was blown away. My whole family was blown away. Why didn’t I think of just putting garlic and olive oil on it? Is there anything that’s not good like that. I’m not even a huge fan of squash. Or should I say, I WASNT a huge fan. So good. Will look forward to fall from now on! Do it. It’s awesome!

Made it exactly as described, and it was delicious. It would be helpful if the weight of the squash used was listed so that ingredients could be adjusted based on the amount of squash used. Otherwise it’s a perfect recipe.  I covered my baking sheets with parchment to prevent sticking and make cleanup easy... works great!

Simple yet delicious. Awesome recipe! I only made half the recipe for two people but did not half the garlic since I love garlicky flavor. I also added a teaspoon of "organic no salt seasoning" from Costco and didn't use parsley since I didn't have any fresh ones. The whole house smelled wonderful. I'm sure it would still just as tasty without the additional seasoning. I roasted the cubes at 400'F for 30 minutes. Will keep this recipe!

Not my favorite way to have squash.  I found it fairly bland tasting and boring. I sprinkled brown sugar on it and it helped a little, but nothing to write home about.

I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and I used dried minced garlic but it tastes good and my 5 kids actually ate it all and devoured the left overs.

Everyone loved this!  Made it for Thanksgiving and had so many compliments wanting the recipe.  Love that it is so simple - don’t change a thing!  Also LOVED the prep tips - microwave for 3 minutes and then peel - so much easier!  Thanks for this keeper!!

Easy, but a bit bland for my taste.  Also, I maybe should have reduced the amount of olive oil for the size squash I used.

The most amazing thing I've ever made! The butternut squash just gets infused with garlic flavor. Just fabulous! I cut my pieces into half inch cubes and cooked for about 25 minutes.I also added more oil and flipped the pieces around once or twice while baking. I salt and peppered while on the cookie sheet.

First time for my husband and I we both loved it.  Tasty and sweet.  We added the squash to a recipe for organic ground turkey with peppers and onions.  It was a wonderful addition and is great as a side dish also.

It was very good on its own, and I made a large batch and froze much of it to add into other recipes. The seasoning worked well in the other recipes.

Loved it - made a lot for my husband and me.  Used leftover squash in a curry soup and was able to have a side again a few days later.

Cooked as per instructions for 35 minutes and was rock hard. My friend said I was supposed to boil/steam for 30 min first. We have to try again tomorrow...

Not a fan. Too bland - needs more herbs, but I don't know what exactly. Using what I made in Butternut Soup instead.

What amazing flavors! We made some minor and major changes to suit our needs. First we followed the directions of roasting the veggies but added half of a sweet onion, but did not add the garlic (2 cloves with skin on) until minute 20. After 40 min we peeled the garlic and added all the ingredients to our vitamix. We then added 4 tbl of milk and a 1/2 cup of our home made chicken broth. We blended for about a minute adding more broth as needed to make the consistency to our liking. We then transferred the sauce to a sauce pan and added salt and pepper and cooked on low for about 30 minutes.

I cooked it for 40ish minutes and it was not browning.  It was ok.  But I think if it cooks longer and will be better.  Will try again.

Peeling and seeding a butternut squash is enough work in and of itself, so its nice that this recipe is simple.  It tastes wonderful.  I personally cut the squash into smaller pieces, so it is more tender.  It's always a great side dish.

I grew up eating butternut squash but my husband and kids aren't as used to it.  I made this as is and everyone in my family loved it and asked if there was more (there wasn't).  It's a good thing I have another butternut in the house.  :)  We'll be adding it to our "side veggies" list.

Wow, this recipe followed exactly as written has made butternut squash a new favorite. It's hard to believe that a few simple ingredients can result in one outstanding dish. The squash cooked up soft and sweet, easily mashed into a fantastic replacement for mashed potatoes. Will be making this recipe again and often.

I feel it had a bit more oil and not enough spices than needed, but it was good. I'll tweak it and make it again!

Turned out great!!  I may have left my pieces a little bugger than called for because I cooked mine for about 35-40 mins and did sprinkle a little cinnamon-sugar. They were delicious

This is awesome.  I found butternut squash already cubed and bagged at Walmart.  Needs no butter.  It stands alone perfectly.

This is how I make roasted butternut too!  The only thing I add is to sprinkle cinnamon on top, yum!  I use a veggie peeler to peel the squash, super easy.

Super easy and super good!!  I put in a little (TB?) of brown sugar just to caramelize and sweeten it a bit.  I made it two nights after the first time.

I cooked it a bit longer to get it to crisp up a bit. It could be that my pan was a tad too small. Overall it was delicious.

The hardest part of this recipe is peeling the squash, definitely take the recommendation others have suggested with softening in the microwave. Such a simple but tasty side dish.

Although I didn't make any changes to the recipe, it tasted a bit bland so my daughter and I cooked up a reduced balsamic and brown sugar glaze to pour over it.  It really did the trick.  The glaze was mostly balsamic vinaigrette, about three tablespoons of brown sugar and about a tablespoon of butter.  Proportions may vary based upon your tastes!!

So simple.

Try stabbing the squash with a fork all over and microwaving it about 1 or 2 minutes.  Skin comes off easily with a sharp knife.

I used freshly pressed garlic and fresh rosemary from my garden.  So yummy!

A great recipe!  Simple yet very tasty. None of the 4 of us had ever had butternut squash and we all enjoyed it very much. I added celery salt and a bit of paperika. A little butter an canola oil because I didn't have olive oil. Yum!

It would have been awesome but did not realize the squash should  have been flipped or  stirred halfway through as they ended up burnt on the bottom.

This was the first time I’ve made butternut squash, definitely not the last!  I followed the tip of forking it before microwaving then using a vegetable peeler. Peeling was no problem. Followed the directions as written. The squash was soft, flavorful, garlicky, and delicious!  This will now be in the regular rotation!

We use this recipe for honey nut squash.  We cut off the ends and cut them in half. No peeling, just put the oil and seasonings in the squash and roasted. Scoop out the goodness into a bowl and give it a stir! Yummy.  You could also use butter, instead of oil for a different flavor. Or add a bit of brown sugar.

Simple and delicious. I added about 1 tsp Italian herb seasoning. Used a foil lined pan and after removing from the oven wrapped the squash in the foil while the salmon cooked. Served it for our friends at a dinner party. It got rave reviews from all!

Ugh, so easy! So good!!  Ovens sometimes vary slightly so just keep an eye on it towards the last 5-10 mins so they don’t burn. You want them a little brown for flavor :)

This has become my most used fall side dish. It is so simple to make and is delicious as is or can be used as a base. I've experimented with adding cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar; curry powder, cumin, chili powder; or thyme and lemon juice. It is so versatile!

Loved it!  It was delicious.  I cooked it exactly the way the video described.  My husband even loved it and he isn't much of a "squash" lover.

Definitely will make again!!

SO SO GOOD! i have no need to make butternut squash any other way now ..really. Ive made it once before and didn't like it, and ive tired soups that have the cinnamon spice played in. To me those just didn't work. i LOVE the garlic and the simplicity of it all. It really is like roasted sweet potato fries (but mushier on the inside) . I am eager to make a soup using the squash roasted like this!.  i peeled mine with a potatoe peeler then cut into rounds all across (scooping out the inners on the fat end) Then each round into squares (3 across).

Wow.  I used cubed squash  found in the produce section to reduce prep time and dehydrated minced garlic. The simple ingredients make the sweetness of the squash stand out.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

I made this as a side to a chicken dish. It is very tasty! However, I  lined my baking sheet with parchment. This may have prevented the squash from browning. I prefer baked vegetables to brown and, despite leaving the squash to bake an extra 10 minutes, it would only brown in parts. Still delicious though.

Very easy and delicious way to cook butternut squash. You could use this recipe to cook other types of squash. I drizzled a little raw local honey on the squash and it added a wonderful and healthy sweetness to the squash. This recipe is a keeper!

More of a technique than a recipe, really.  This would be a great base recipe for other dishes, but on its own it is really perfectly ordinary; bland, uninteresting and in need of some pizzazz.

I used the first of my home grown squash to make this. I liked that it was easy to make with very little clean up. I probably will not make this again, at least not without some tweaks. I used a vegetable peeler to peel this and a knife after cutting it in 1/2 so that went fine. I found the dish to be too much just one note for my taste, and just one texture. Thankfully I had a sesame ginger teriyaki sauce on my other food and that helped make it more interesting. In the future I may try to  do a similar prep only with honey instead of garlic, or adapt my blue cheese almond acorn squash recipe for it. It was fine, it was edible and none will go to waste but it was not amazing, at least not to me.

I love butternut squash and most recipes seem to involve heavy seasoning or brown sugar.  This is a perfectly simple recipe that lets the flavor of the squash shine.  I pureed the leftover squash in the blender to make soup.

They were so lovely and delicious..  They were all kinds of tasty and you could still taste the sweetness of the butternut  amidst the garlic... Simply amazing... Thank you for the recipe.

This was a great way to do a Butternut squash---we loved it! You could sprinkle with brown sugar if you wanted, we like the herbs and salt and pepper best, but easy to please everyone. Glad to have found the recipe and will make again. Thanks.

I made this for my family and parents said that unstead of salt and pepper to use mrs.dash. and maybe a bit more garlic or even just garlic salt :) otherwise AMAZING. My whole family loved it also maybe more time in the oven because it tastes better soft and it was still a little hard for some peices.

A keeper! Even non squash lovers will like this! Roasted with garlic, instead of drowned in brown sugar, made a surprisingly good side dish. I discovered that I like it this way! Delicious!

01.30.17 ~ Roasted this in the morning for my lunch and had the rest of it with our dinner. Simple, easy and quick to make. In my oven it took the 30 minutes. Flavor is spot on. For lunch I just reheated in the microwave and it was delicious. Served it as a side to 'Pink Sauce Beef Tips' for dinner. It reheated nicely, both a lunch and at dinner. Thanks for a great recipe.

Used cubed squash from store and baked 20-30 min since it was cubed smaller. On one batch used 2T maple syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon. Other batch used Herbs o' Provence. Both were good. Stirred once in between baking. Did not use garlic. Hubby like sweet one I liked savory one.

Simple and fast recipe, especially if you buy the pre-cubed squash.  I've made it a few times and recommend cooking 30+ minutes.  Can use a little extra seasoning.

I followed the advice of another cook and poked some holes in the squash, microwaved it for a few minutes and that made it so easy to peel. Kambocha squash has always been my favorite, but now I will add Butternut to my list! It was really delicious and I will make it again!

We've made this a number of times and all love it.  The only part that prevents us from making it more often is the difficulty in peeling and dicing the squash. I may follow what others say and buy squash already peeled and diced.

I liked the recipe, but I also drizzled a little maple syrup in and stirred that with the seasonings before putting the squash in the pan to roast.

Loved it! I bought the pre-peeled and cut butternut squash (best decision ever!) as I'm lazy. The simplicity of this recipe is it's strong suit as it doesn't overpower the squash, just enhances the flavour.

This is a very good recipe. It's needs something but I don't know what. I loved the texture of the roasted squash. I have always avoided butternut squash because they are so hard to peel. I cut the squash in half, scooped out the seeds and roasted for about 15 min at 400,  (like another reviewer did) let it cool and it peeled beautifully. I have some lemon infused olive oil, I plan on trying that next time. I will definitely make again.

Definately a keeper. Tried the wash, poke with fork and micro 3 minutes. Works like a champ, easy to peal.  Hubby was sceptical at first to try recipe, however he is a believer now. Son, 13, loved it too.

Easy, quick and great for soup recipe calling for roasted butternut squash, good enough though to eat all by itself.

Much better than simply roasting. I do put my favorite vegetable roasting  pan in the oven while it's preheating to promote browning, then I spray the bottom of the pan with vegetable spray and spread the squash in a single layer.  I cover the pan with foil for half the time, then I turn the pieces and return to the oven without the foil. I believe it insures the vegetable gets cooked through, especially if I'm roasting the squash along side something else at a lower temp.

Use this as my base whenever I roasted butternut squash this past fall and winter. My only advice would be to not cut the squash too small, because then they tend to get too soft and stick to the pan.

This is a wonderful and simple way to prepare butternut squash.  I may add a little more garlic depending on the size of my squash.  My children were eagerly eating the pieces of squash off the pan as soon as it came out of the oven.  Definitely a go to recipe for a weeknight side dish.

It was super easy and being me, I had to alter it a bit. I used cabbage and red chard and added 1 clove of fresh garlic. it needed salt and pepper to taste but it was excellent, easy and ready in just a half hour.

Delish!! First time eating Butternut variety and it reminds me of a very mild sweet potato, or the old fashioned "potato pumpkin" that my grandaddy raised in his garden. Love having healthy alternatives to our meals!

I add an extra clove of garlic because I'm a garlic fiend. Half the time I'll use coconut oil instead of olive.

It's a tasty treat! Give it a try.

This was my first time making butternut squash and I loved how it turned out! I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (I didn't have any on hand) and thought it tasted good. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I didn't care for it this way. 

It cooked better for me when I rubbed a little bit of olive oil on it and sprinkled it with salt & pepper. I layed it face down on my cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and baked it at 435 for 50 minutes. 

It was much more tender at the higher temperature and longer duration. Very flavorful.

This was great.  Easy to make (minus cutting up the squash), and husband approved! I undercooked it a little this time but I would definitely cook the amount of time recommended in the recipe. I made this as a side dish to the Apple Butter POrk Loin recipe and it was a perfect combo!

Loved this! Put it on the bottom rack while I was roasting a chicken. It was great  Easy to make and you can vary the type of winter squash. My husband loved it too. The nice thing Is you don't need anything else on it when it comes out of the oven.

Turn out great just as written. I bought butternut squash from Costco already cut up.  I put it in a bowl added the olive oil and salt and pepper.  I also did Brussels sprouts on the same pan and the same way. Delicious

Wonderful, simple recipe.  Doubled this one to feed a crowd, and I'll use it again.  Rather than using a bowl in which to coat the squash, I used a large ziplock bag, sealed it, and tossed the squash in the oil and garlic mixture that way.  One less dish to clean.

Loved it. It was very simple yet very tasty. I followed the recipe, otherwise how can you properly review it!!! I think, just to change things up, I'm going to toss it with rosemary next time.

I had bought an already diced package of squash thinking I'll  make a soup but was glad to find this recipe.  It turned out great.  I did not change anything.  It was so easy and very tasty.  I'll definitely make it again.

This is much better than the way I was taught to cut the squash in half, put in pan with a bit of water, and microwave. That way always made the squash waterlogged and mushy. I think roasting is a brilliant way to prepare vegetables, and this is no exception.

I cut the squash in half lengthwise then used my vegetable peeler to take off the outer layer, this was much easier than using a knife. We loved this recipe but added ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. Also used a vanilla bean olive oil. Turned out amazing and everyone wanted seconds!

This is our favorite style for butternut. Just made it as part of a formal buffet . I do make 1 simple change that I think makes it stand out, I grate  generous amount of fresh nutmeg when it first comes out & then again when in serving dish. For 2 squash a full but. BTW way quick peel tip prebake whole pricked squash for a few mintues.

This is a regular side dish in our house. I always add 1 tsp of Turmeric Powder not only to punch up the bright orange colour of the squash, but also for the purported health benefits. (Google: Health benefits of combining black pepper and turmeric). When I toss mixtures in a bowl, I inevitably use too small of a bowl, so I lose a bit onto the counter, my shirt, or the floor. To avoid turmeric stains, I prefer to toss all ingredients into a resealable plastic bag

I thought it was very yummy! I used frozen peeled and diced butternut squash. I will definitely make this again and maybe even for Thanksgiving.

SImple, straightforward, and simple. I've made this several times now. While the garlic is a delicious addition, I like the simplicity of olive oil and salt & pepper with winter squash. Throw in some roast chicken and you've got a quick weeknight meal!

This recipe is a keeper! Microwaved squash as suggested, and it made a huge difference in peeling and slicing.  Will make this one again.

Made it for the first time today and it turned out wonderful! I did tweak the recipe, adding 4 tablespoons brown sugar and half a teaspoon of nutmeg.

I too put the squash in the microwave for three minutes whole and this helped to get the skin off.

I had a really large butternut squash that covered my foil-lined sheet pan.  I decided to try multiple flavors so on one end I sprinkled the garlic, salt & pepper.  On the other end I sprinkled garlic, salt, pepper & thyme.  After 25 minutes it was tender to the fork; I added a drizzle of maple syrup over part of the S&P & thyme side and cooked it 7 minutes more.  I liked the variety of savory & sweet.  When my husband liked it too, I went ahead and mixed all the pieces together.  We have plenty of leftovers due to the size squash I found.  I got my super-fresh squash at a Farmer's Market for $2.50.  I definitely plan to make this again.

Wonderful change from the usual sweet versions. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Super favors!   Thanks to 2 other reviewers with the trick to microwave first for prep and the gem who suggested separating the bulb from tube and creating flat edges with seeds coming out after peeling...genius.  I. combined these 2 prep methods and was easily able to remove skin with basic vegetable peeler

We are trying to eat healthier, so butternut squash with lots of garlic and olive oil sounded good.  This was so easy and absolutely delicious!!!   Thank you too, for the person who suggested microwaving the squash to peel easier....it was a real blessing!  Never knew this before and it worked great.  Made the squash much easier to deal with.  Will definitely keep this in my recipe file.....YUM!

Delicious! AND EASY!
    I cut my pieces small.  I did flip the pieces over about half way.  Not sure it was necessary, but since I went by the oven to check, I thought I'd just do it  like I've done with potatoes... 
    To try a variation, I sprinkled some dried Rosemary and dried Sage on some of them and served them seperately.  I don't usually like Rosemary -or Sage, but they were good that way too.   
    Thank you for sharing this recipe!  We were able to harvesr 3 nice size butternuts that  the squirrels didn't ravage,.  Fun to prepare one and eat it as soon as I found this recipe!!

Family loved it. However I did add 3 more ingredients (kids don't like squash had to entice them somehow).

I added about a tsp of brown sugar and a a tbsp of asiago cheese (from the bulk Barn). 

In the bowl I whisked everything together then tossed the squash to coat.

Put in pan, lightly drizzled more extra virgin olive oil and put in oven.

About 10 minutes from being done (I baked mine for 35 mins) I put on a pat of butter to add a slight bit of crispiness.

Fan loves it! It has been rated the second best thing I've made.

This is squash night number 3 in 10 days!

I was very happy w this super simple recipie! I actually used precubed packaged squash , which made this even easier. I found I had to bake mine for a long time closer to 40 minutes than 30 but regardless it turned out wonderfully, would definitely make again!

Awesome! Next time, I'll only use 1 clove of garlic, rather than 2. I thought 2 cloves were overpowering. I'd like to taste what it's like with just a hint of the garlic, instead.

I had to bake this way way way longer than the recipe leads you to believe.  Be sure to start this first so you don't have a cold/overcooked main dish.

added a dash of seasoned salt and smoked paprika, a light oiling of the pan before baking would have helped as well. Best Butternut Squash i ever had!

I grow Butternut squash in my garden and as a result I have this a lot. This is an excellent recipe.  I occasionally will change it a little and add some onion soup mix. Either way it is great!

Simple but delicious. 
I had a large BNS and I only put 1.5 tbsp of oil opposed to 2, as a review suggested less oil.  It was perfect. Didn't taste oil at all.

Have made this multiple times as directed and it turns out great. We have increased the garlic to our taste and have also successfully subbed sweet potato for the squash. More time consuming than just baking them, but the change of taste and firm texture is worth the effort. Thanks for sharing!

I love using this way to make butternut squash!  I think the best reason I like making it this way is because most other prep methods involve using brown sugar to make it sweet, and I prefer a savory prep--it's healthier that way, anyway.

I made this tonight to go with dinner.  It was awesome but a little too firm.  Either make the cubes smaller or cook much longer than indicated in the recipe.

Aaaamazzing! I am a paleo vegan, and I substituted the olive oil for coconut oil and it paired extremely well with the sweetness of the squash. I also left the skin on and it was great!! Yummm!

I felt that this preparation of butternut squash left a lot to be desired. The sweet squash flavor did come through well, but that is the case with baking butternut squash, not anything special about this recipe. There just wasn't enough dimension in this dish and the flavors all kind of meld together and is texturally boring. I microwaved the halved squash to make it easier to peel, I feel this step should really be added to any recipe for butternut squash as it is very difficult to peel when raw. I then followed the directions exactly and baked for 25 minutes. The squash baked properly but did not caramelize. Once I removed from the oven I tasted the squash and it was very bland so I added garlic salt and Parmesan/Reggianno cheese which helped considerably.  However, there was still a lack of texture and acidity. I think next time I might add apples and/or craisens to add texture and diverse flavors. Maybe a different cheese like blue or Gorgonzola.

A wonderful tasting and easy to make side dish. The only hard part is cutting the squash. But once that is accomplished the rest is easy to do.

I changed it up but used the basic recipe I instead used walnut oil, then added a little of the following: cayenne, chili powder, maple syrup, tabasco, garlic, onion powder, basil, ginger. Put all the ingredients in a bag poured in the cut squash shook then poured in baking dish and added salt and pepper.

I made this with 3 cups of already diced squash, so I decided to increase the amounts of the other ingredients. I used 3 tbsp of olive oil and 3 garlic cloves. I didn't measure the amount of salt or pepper that I used, but I was much heavier on the pepper than the salt. The butternut squash pieces were not all equal in size, so I had to take them out of the oven before some of the larger pieces had softened in order to avoid burning the smaller pieces. That said, I thought the slightly different textures were all good, and the taste was very delicious. The dish was tasty and comforting when warm (not too hot). The recipe was also super easy.

Made this for my family and they loved it! For an alternative you can add mozzarella cheese for the savory and its absolutely delicious.

I loved the simplicity of making it and the way the garlic and olive oil balanced the flavor of the squash so well.  My family, whose initial disappointment that it wasn't cooked with brown sugar/maple syrup was betrayed by the lack of leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.

Unfortunately, for me, the garlic ruined it.  I'll make this again but with salt and pepper only.

Although I didn't try this recipe per se, I make butternut squash the same way so that's why I rated it 5 stars.  
I would like to share a quick and easy way to peel & cut butternut squash for  people not wishing/needing to use the whole thing.
Simply peel it using a potato peeler.  You will be pleasantly surprised at how easily the skin comes off.  The squash is then  very easy to cut into desired piece size.
Try it and see if it works for you too!

I like butternut squash any way it can be prepared.  I do not like "peeling" it.  Today I roasted the squash using this recipe as a guide. I DID NOT PEEL IT.  I sliced into 0 .5 inch crescent slices.  Placed the slices in an aluminum covered baking sheet.  Misted the  squash with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Then I covered the pan with aluminum foil and baked at 400 degrees for 50-60 minutes. The underside of the squash was caramelized a little.  All was very soft and tasty.  I figure that anyone who doesn't want to eat the peeling can discard it on their plate, but it was quite soft and had no bad taste.  The peeling can be eaten as far as I'm concerned.  Misting the squash with oil reduced number of dishes to wash.

So simple and so very tasty! I added rosemary and extra garlic. The squash can then be eaten either as is, or used on top of salads, in soups, in lasagna, etc.  If you've never tried butternut squash, start here.

As described, this is a very simple side dish. We enjoyed it very much and think one could change it from time to time by varying th seasonings.  Simple salt, pepper and garlic worked well this time.

Made this tonight. Didn't get that roasted caramelized taste/color like i kinda hoped it would. Next time, i will make it in a cast iron skillet.. sautéing first then putting it in the oven.  I may omit the garlic too or i may try it again sautéing that first too. All in all, it was ok as published.

I made it as it was listed and it was very good. The squash was easy to peal, easy to cut, and easy to prepare. It only took 10 minutes to get it ready and then 25 minutes to cook. It was so good that my finicky son at it too. This recipe is a keeper.

Loved this dish! I used only 1 tbl. of oil to cut calories and it was plenty.  And I added a chunked up onion since I had a abundance of them.  It was outstanding and as others mentioned, the house smelled great on a cold rainy night.  Can't wait to eat leftovers for lunch today.  I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe MChele!

In the future, I'm probably going to buy double the squash and only use the straight portion to make this, as that is easier to prepare. I otherwise loved this and served it at our family get together this Christmas, and will likely bring it again.

This is great...after you peel it!   It takes extra time to peel the hard skin of butternut squash, a potato peeler does not do the job!  You need to cut it off slice at a time.  Then cube it , toss with olive oil and season with your favorite spice.  Shake a little Parmesan cheese over it after baking..  Yum!

I will make this again.
Another cook suggested 1 T of olive - I will try that next time.
In addition to the minced garlic, I put whole garlic cloves because I like roasted garlic.
I also turned the oven to 450F for the final 10 minutes to brown the squash.  
The squash was sweet - I think the sugars carmelized.

Great easy recipe. The best way to peel it, is to uses vegetable peeler. Then cut into rings. Easy. :)

Amazing … and so easy. I used pre sliced & cubed butternut squash so there was one less thing to do Christmas day. I was a little hesitant about using the garlic but the end result was DIVINE! It had a roasted and somewhat candied flavor when the baking sheet came out of the oven. My family and in laws ate this dish up, and I didn’t have to take home left overs.

Quick & easy and you can add seasonings to your liking.  I adjusted the cook time down to 20 minutes in the toaster oven because I like the squash a slight bit firmer.

So simple, and so good. I've roasted butternut squash at multiple temperatures, but this was perfect. I used Costco's already-diced squash, and skipped the garlic, but other than that pretty much followed the recipe, and got perfect caramelized squash.  Thanks for posting!

This was the best thing at this years Thanksgiving meal.  Even beat out my grandmothers 24 hour ice box rolls!  I put the chunks of squash with the other ingredients in a foil pouch and threw them on the grill to cook (we were grilling/smoking our turkey).  Very Very good.

Oh yeah!  This was really a great recipe.  So simple, too!  I had a pretty good sized squash, so I made some soup with the rest of it.  I did microwave the squash for 3 minutes after piercing it with a knife several times.  Let it cool and much easier to peel.

This was my first time making butternut squash. I like the simplicity of the recipe, but the outer edges of the pieces are too chewy.... maybe I was supposed to peel more than just the skin? Also, I may've not put enough s&p on it. I will try again, and maybe another time too so I can try the other seasoning suggestions. Thanks!

Simple, perfect, yummy. I made the mistake of adding too much olive oil (didn't measure, just tossed some in), so it ended up more soft and oily than roasted. So make sure to not make that mistake :) either way, delicious!

Simple and delicious!  I microwaved the squash and it was a still a little hard to cut, but it worked much easier.  I roasted the squash and then a few minutes before I served it I added some pieces of kale to the pan (and a bit more olive oil, S&P) and roasted it while warming up the squash.  It was heaven!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Our family was "squashed-out" when I tried it.  Now, it is never left behind on dinner plates!   A quick tip:  I put the prepared recipe ingredients into a suitably-sized plastic bag (ziploc-type works well), close it and mix to coat.

I'm not a huge fan of butternut squash. It's ok and that's the way I felt about this recipe.  I could eat it, but wasn't thrilled.  I don't think I'll make it this way again....Next time I get a lot of squash from someone, I'll stick with mashing it with a bit of salt and butter or making a cake.

Very simple. I didn't have minced garlic. So just used olive oil, garlic salt and pepper. Turned out great.

This is a wonderfully simple and nutritious recipe! I had an overabundance of butternut squash in the garden, so I make this alot. To change it up, I will toss the cubes in olive oil,  cinnamon and brown sugar. You can add salt and pepper to this, too.

As suggested by other reviews, poked and microwaved the squash to make it easier to peel, esp. since I broke my 50 year old peeler the first time I made this trying to peel the impossible squash! Otherwise, filled recipe exactly. Easy and delicious!

I made this recipe from the AR magazine using the method for Rosemary Maple Squash.  It took about 45 minutes to become tender enough to eat - added 1 T. more of maple syrup and lime juice - good but probably won't make again.

I just finished making this.  I followed the recipe exactly, and loved it. Since I am cooking for one, I purchased peeled and cubed butternut squash from the grocers. Garlic was good,  another good seasoning is: nutmeg.

Very yummy! I always thought you had to load butternut squash up with sweet or cheesy ingredients, but this simple recipe really let the natural sweet and savory flavor of the squash shine! I served it with a creamy tomato soup for a cozy fall dinner. I chopped and tossed the squash with the oil several hours beforehand and it kept perfectly in the fridge until I wanted to bake it.

I'd never had butternut squash before; apparently we grew some in our veggie garden on a whim.  This recipe was simple & delicious; I made it exactly as-is, no changes. Fresh, flavorful, and healthy.  Even the leftovers were good the next day!  The worst part for me was the peeling & cubing of the squash.

I find it very easy to peel and cut butternut squash by first poking a couple of holes in it  with a sharp knife and placing it in the microwave for 1-2 minutes. Then slice the bottom if you like to make it flat. Stand on end and peel  from top to bottom with a potato peeler. The microwaving also makes it easier to cut after you've peeled it. Then follow your recipe. So easy. I love these winter squashes.

This couldn't have been any easier to make.  I cut the squash cubes a bit smaller and let it marinate for an hour or so.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  You won't regret this one!

Easy and delicious. Followed recipe exactly, but used two smaller squashes, one large knob of garlic, 1 tsp of olive oil and sprinkled a smidge of demerara brown sugar and grated fresh nutmeg on top. The squash was quartered and microwaved for 2 mins for peeling. Also added two chopped yams, for color and texture. My husband the 'fries guy', whose nose automatically turns up when real veggies are on the menu, actually said he liked the squash!!!! Wow!!! First time in seven years. This is why I rate the recipe with five stars. You know I'll make this again and again. Thanks

Excellent!! Made this last night with one small change. Used more garlic than recipe called for since we love garlic. I have never  liked winter squash, but this recipe was so good, I had two helpings! Will definitely make again. Also, thanks for the tip on putting whole squash in microwave for easy peeling and cutting. It worked!

I or should say we love Butternut Squash any way it is fixed.  This is a simple easy recipe, sometimes add sweet potato or parsnips to it or even carrots.

We make this recipe all the time! It's the only way I'll eat butternut squash. It can definitely be used in place of fries as they have that sort of texture but a healthier option.

Fairly solid - the taste is there. I'd have loved a reminder to turn it midway through, though - I didn't think to and the browning is uneven.

The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because I made some slight changes but I have to say this was AMAZING!  I used less Olive Oil and no salt!  It really was great!

It was delicious. I roughly chopped a whole head of garlic along with an onion, a few bell peppers and okra for some color and different texture. Served it with a meat and it was a complete meal.

This is the first dish I've ever made using butternut squash.  It was difficult to peel the squash, but otherwise fixing the dish was very simple.  It tasted very good.  You could really taste the flavor of the squash and the texture was great also.  I am looking forward to making this dish again.

omg!!  Love love love. soo easy and delicious.  Peeling it of course was the hardest part. 2things i did differently: i microwaved the chunks to soften them, less oven time. and i used butter instead of OO.  also you can toss in some fresh herbs.

I didn't change a thing (well, I added 2 more cloves of garlic, because I love garlic), it's a perfect fresh dish with simple ingredients. I never had butternut squash with garlic, I'm used to the more traditional mashed squash with butter and spices. This dish is very simple, very healthy, and very tasty. I will be making this again.

I had never tried butternut squash but was looking for a good recipe since my mother loves it.  I made this and had her over for lunch.  We both loved it!  The hardest part of the recipe is peeling the squash.  Great recipe - no tweaks necessary :)

I have a tendency to improvise with recipes, but stayed with the plan and made it exactly as it is written.  It was very good and I am very pleased!  In the future, I'll most likely add sweet yellow onions cut into large chunks, but it's nice to know that this recipe is definitely good just as it is.  Thank you!

Simple and so delicious! I had butternut squash pieces that I needed to use for dinner and I looked up recipes. I went with this one and it went very well with the lemoned tilapia and salad I made for dinner tonight.  You can't go wrong with it.

Low calorie, great health benefits, and delicious... this one will be a new staple for me. 

This is a simple but fantastic recipe. As someone who loves salt, I really like the sweetness of the squash combined with the salt--I used Celtic Sea Salt (as always), which made it that much better. I also only used 1 tablespoon olive oil and it was more than enough.

I did cook it a little longer than suggested and, next time, I will flip it a time or two and cook it longer yet. The smaller pieces were slightly crispy on the outside and even better.

We made this and peeled it with a potato peeler...it was amazing!
No changes in the recipe, but will try the microwave suggestion that jaydeu mentioned, because it was tough to peel and cut open. Can't wait to buy another squash!

This recipe was easy and excellent. Roasted butternut for dinner. My husband sampled from the pan when the squash emerged from the oven. Our garden produced a bumper crop of butternuts this year, no doubt we'll make roasted butternut squash again and again.
Thanks MChele

I have been cooking my butternut squash this way for years.  It is simple and taste delicious.  To those who hate the peeling, washing and cutting of the squash, try the packaged squash that is sold in most grocery stores such as Ralph's and Trader Joe's.  I have used them for some time and they take all the work out of an otherwise difficult job.

I grow this squash during summer months and it stays all yr.  Therefore, it is extra delicious!  I'm always looking for new receipes. This one is so simple, yet delicious.  You can also cut up a little larger size potato(leave skins on), add a little more seasoning, toss with the squash n  cook together .

My favorite use for this recipe that I've tried so far was in salad with red quinoa, walnuts, kale, cooked yellow onion, and raisins.

Better than I expected!  I found already cubed squash at Costco so that helped save tons of time.  Mixed all in a Ziploc bag- only 1 TB olive oil (2 would have been too much) but 3 cloves garlic.  Smelled VERY garlicy while baking.  I liked the flavor but the kiddos did not.  I will likely make again- maybe try a cinnamon variation in place of the garlic, salt, pepper next time.

Excellent! The flavors were tremendous. I agree with naples34102.  I did use a veggie peeler which took off the toughest layer. I ended up scraping more off than I probably needed to.

This is so simple and delicious!! I added rosemary to the mix and it was perfect. I ate it right out of the pan after it came out of the oven. I cooked for 15 min, stirred and then cooked for another 15 min

I love this recipe.  It's delicious.  I really like cinnamon with my butternut squash.  I found that adding cinnamon to it before baking, gave it the extra flavor I was looking for.  Very tasty the next day, too.

Fabulous!  I grew my own squash this year and have been thinking about how I should prepare this. I love this recipe!  It is savory and so simple. I have a great peeler from Pampered Chef which made the peeling so easy.  I made the recipe as is and will do it again for many years to come.  Thank you!

Very easy and tasty (once I figured out an easy way to cut the squash.  If you cut the squash into one inch pieces and "then" trim the skin off, it is easier to peal.  My entire family ate it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was so good!  I usually add other stuff (like cheese) to squash, but hubs is on a diet so I wanted to make something without the extra calories.  This fit the bill - the only change I made was to use garlic powder rather than fresh (didn't have) and added a sprinkle of Madras curry powder for a little kick.  I cooked at 425 for 20 mins, and turned the pieces after 10.  Magical - hubs and I were both stabbing with our forks for the last few pieces in the serving bowl!

I rarely rate recipes but I had to rate this one after the first meal. I made it exactly as instructed, except maybe a little more garlic, & it was phenomenal & so easy! My partner is the pickiest eater I've ever met & I can rarely get her to touch a vegetable but after the first bite, she asked me to make this again tomorrow night, too. My 12 year old ate 2 helpings & asked me to pack the leftovers in her lunch tomorrow. Score! To make this easier, I bought the squash already cut up.

A real delicious side dish. Hard to use a shortcut for the squash, since I had trouble peeling and cutting the squash. But pre-cut squash made it easier. I'm new to cooking and trying out simple dishes. This is also healthy too.

This recipe was sooo good! I didn't even follow the directions, I just eyeballed it. I added tons of minced garlic and I even added some garlic powder(you can never have enough garlic in my opinion).I also didn't have olive oil so I used vegetable oil and it tasted just fine to me. I also added parsley like someone said in the previous comments. I think next time I might add a little paprika. Super simple and super tasty! I really wish I had made more! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

For Boomer's Wife - all you have to do is heat the squash in the oven for about 10 min till the skin is soft to peel. I put a little water in the bottom of the pan.

Yes, it's simple & very good. I did think it needed a bit more garlic than my original sprinkling of garlic powder which I substituted for the fresh garlic. You might also want to check to see if it's done in 20 minutes.

Easiest way to peal butternut is to cut a thin slice off of the bulb end then you can use a small ice cream scoop or a melon ball scoop too de-seed and then use a potato peeler to skin, and do as you please!

This is amazing - my family just loved it, and it's just so easy.  I added garlic. Found that it took less time to bake - perhaps it was my oven.  I'll definitely make this again!!

Finally, my family likes butternut squash; thanks to this recipe.  I did cook longer to caramelize a bit more.  That makes the texture so much more like home potatoes and gives the outside a little crunch.  I think I put too much olive oil (didn't measure) because I could taste it more than I wanted.  The recipe amount would have been perfect.  Will definitely fix next time.

This was the first recipe I ever tried for butternut squash - my Mom never cooked it when I was growing up, so I never bought it myself until now. I LOVED it. I don't think I'll even need to try any other recipes for a while. Might make this weekly. :)

I have tried butternut squash before, but got discouraged with cutting it. I found it in the produce department already cubed so I gave this recipe a try. It was delicious and very easy. Roasting veggies is great. I will be making this many more times. NancyLee

My squash never darkened up (I suspect that my dishware was at fault, the sides were too high to circulate the heat correctly) but it did soften up and taste good.  To finish it off, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese for the last few minutes to make up for the lack of browning.

Made this last night with precut, organic butternut squash so all the hard work was done for me.  I made it exactly according to the recipe and it came out perfectly.  My daughter that likes squash loved it and my daughter that hates squash ate it without complaint.  This will be a staple in our house.  Thank you MChele!

This is so simple and delicious.  Just as good, if not better, the next day !  The second time I made this, I added a small amount of agave syrup.  Like maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 teaspoon.  It was even more yummy!!!  I took advice from others and microwaved squash first (poking holes with fork beforehand) to soften it before cutting it up.

Nice way to make this squash. Good flavor, sort of like rich, slightly sweet roasted potatoes. Cooking time was longer than indicated by about 10 minutes (I have gas convection). Smells heavenly while baking.

Fantastic!  This was one of the best and simplest recipes for butternut squash.  I did exactly (for once) what it said and it was worth it.  This is one recipe where you don't need other seasonings; it just let's the squash shine.

I liked this.  I just peeled the squash with a vegetable peeler, removed the seeds, chopped it into chunks, seasoned it, and put it in the over.  45 minutes later, voila, dinner is served.  However, I think that this squash could have really used some sweetener.  It turned out well, but was not nearly as tasty as sweet potatoes prepared the same way would have been.

This was delicious. It is now our favorite way to prepare butternut squash. Cut in half length wise and sliced along the dimples then used vegetable peeler as others suggested. Never new it could be so easy.

So delicious! Made as written with only a couple tiny changes: lined the baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup; and after baking, added a dash of cinnamon and parsley.  Holy yum :9

This was simple and tasty!  Next time I might use only half the olive oil since it did come out the tiniest bit oily.

Very easy and surprisingly very good.  It enhances the natural flavor of the squash rather than masking it with lots of butter, sugar, etc.  My 3-year-old devoured it.  This will be a regular on the menu.  

I did use Kosher salt and didn't have garlic cloves so used garlic powder.

I cut my squash in half length wise and then scooped out the seeds. After that I removed the outer shell with a potato peeler and cut the remainder into cubes. Cooked exactly as above recipe called for and it turned out perfect!

Delicious and easy! I added cumin and Italian seasoning, but followed the recipe otherwise. I kept the pan in an extra 5-10 min to make them a bit crispy.

I bought the butternut squash already cubed in the produce aisle.  How many cups does one squash equal - approximately? Can't wait to eat ours again!

Wow! This was really good! I'm normally a bit of a squash hater, and I only made this because I happened to have a squash sittin'around. I may have now been converted to a squash lover!

Terrific!  I will make again!  Reminds me of sweet potato fries with garlic.
