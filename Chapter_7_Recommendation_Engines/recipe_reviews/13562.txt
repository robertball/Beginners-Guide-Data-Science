This stuffing is outstanding!  It's a beautiful dark color from the wild mushrooms, and everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved it.  Many went back for seconds on this before the turkey!!  It is a little time consuming to prepare, but well worth the effort.  I couldn't find egg bread, so I cubed and toasted egg buns, and it turned out great.

Used rosemary bread from our machine and button mushrooms, subbed waterchestnuts for celery and red onions for leeks, added 1/2tsp. minced garlic, halved thyme and sage. Mushrooms cooked in white & red wine/broth reduction. I diced up   1 can of pears to add at end and used wine/broth reduction to moisten. I don't think I ever had better stuffing/dressing!! It was absolutely delicious...can't imagine if I had wild shrooms!!! I'm not fond of the texture of the dried thyme and rosemary "needles"...will grind them up better next time. TY for the fabulous recipe!!

Based on looks alone I give this recipe 5 stars. My husband said it looked so professional, he loved the taste and couldn't get enough of it. Also I made this at Thanksgiving time and egg bread was very very scarce around here, I ended up using butter egg rolls and cut them up, this recipe still tasted great.

The only mistake I made with this one was not knowing how much one of my 2 guests hated mushrooms, but it was fantastic for the rest of us!

This was by far the best stuffing I have ever made or eaten!  I recommend it wholeheartedly.  I called all over town to get the egg bread and tracked down one bakery who had it in stock before Thanksgiving, and it was worth the hunt.  I did cut down the amount of bread by about 1/4 as I didn't want it too 'bready', and I forgot to toast the hazlenuts but to no detrimental effect.  Loved it!

This is an excellent recipe. I love mushrooms so having a variety of mushrooms in one dish was extra special. My family and neighbors loved this stuffing and said it was the best they've ever tasted.

I gave this a two because of the amount of time and effort this takes to make.  It is also expensive (where I live mushrooms are not cheap).  It was good but lots of work.  Good recipe if you have a lot of people hanging around the kitchen looking for something to do.

I have made this stuffing for the last 3 years for sure! Everyone LOVES it! I like to use fresh herbs it really gives it wonderful flavour. We love mushrooms so I use all kinds, oyster, portabello - any that I can find. I never have any leftovers, no matter how much I make!! Thanks Christine for making this one of our Thanksgiving Traditions!

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving.  I love mushrooms but I thought this was a little much.  I will make it again but will put less mushrooms in it.  I used a packaged season stuffing mix and thought the flavoring was perfect with the fresh sage.

This is a great stuffing. I replaced the egg bread with a whole-grain bread, and it was pretty good. Also added some garlic since I'm a garlic fiend. Everyone said it was the best stuffing they ever tasted.

This was great! I used dried chanterelles that we had picked instead of the shiitakes. I will definitely be making this again.

Not bad.  It hasn't taken the top spot as my favorite stuffing.  I think next time I would include the bread crusts though.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was great but is definitely a LOT of work. I goofed up and did not quite have enough egg bread (challah). Seems to help to have extra broth on hand to keep it moist (substituted vegetable broth).  Otherwise it was very good and a big hit.

I just made this for the holidays, AMAZING!  I used Rosemary bread as I read in someone elses review and it is lovely.  My mother-in-law picks her own mushrooms and dries them so I eyeballed the amount.  I also used half celery and half water chestnuts which was a nice blend.  This recipe is such a earthy dish that it warms the soul for the holidays.  I will definitely be making this for years to come.

This stuffing was so unforgettable last year that it was specifically requested again. I used this recipe to stuff the "world's greatest turkey" recipe from this site which uses champagne as the basting juice--talk about elegant. I also found a great sweet potato recipe "praline sweet potatoes" it bakes up light and fluffy like a souffle--that was also requested again this year and though I doubled it last year I may triple it this time because it was the first to go! All in all it was a very gourmet meal and everyone (20 people) were highly impressed!

The most fantastic stuffing recipe, EVER!  One of the first times I saw everyone clean their plates...  I took some liberties with the recipe.  Instead of only adding dried porchini mushrooms, I also added morels, chanterelles, oyster, and lobster mushrooms.  YUMMY!

Super delicious!  I made this for the first time on thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit.  I couldn't find all of the mushroom varieties at the last minute (cause that's how I do everything) but it was still AWESOME.  I seriously could have skipped the turkey and just had stuffing and gravy!

This tasted good, but it makes a ton (it really will serve 16), and it is very time consuming and very expensive.  I live in Chicago, and I still had to go to four different stores to find all of the ingredients, and ended up spending nearly $50 (between the three types of mushrooms, hazelnuts, fresh herbs and challah), as well as over an hour in prep work (soaking, chopping, reconstituting...) It was not so much better than the standard sage stuffing I usually make that it was in any way worth the time or expense.  My husband, who thought it tasted great, agreed that the cost/benefit ratio was just too skewed.

This recipe is expensive and takes a lot of time... but it is TOTALLY worth it!!!!  It was by far the best part of my 8 course Thanksgiving dinner.  To save money, you can skip the porchini mushrooms.  Sounds like a lot of mushrooms and some people worry about that...but everyone of my guests couldn't get enough.  A mushroom hater even loved it and kept going back for more.
