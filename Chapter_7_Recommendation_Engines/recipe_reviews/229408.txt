REMEMBER!!! Put a cookie sheet under the spingform pan. I forgot to do this and the carmel dripped out onto the bottom of the stove.  It smelt like it was burning. Otherwise, It was great. I used carmel dip that you would use for apples and it worked fine, plus I used melted kisses for the chocolate part and that worked fine too.  I will make this again:)

This is the best cheesecake EVER! I love cheesecake and since I got pregnant it's all I ever crave. This is by far the best recipe I've ever used. It turned out perfectly and, even though it's horrible, I ate pretty much the entire thing in a week. With the exception of two slices. Lol.

I found this recipe on the Philadelphia Cream Cheese website.  I have made this cheesecake oh, 12 times for various reasons and it is ALWAYS a hit! 

Hint: The caramel mixture always drips out of the spring form pan, so a cookie sheet underneath is a must, otherwise your oven will smoke and your smoke alarm will go off and it's all a big mess.
Also, I always let the cream cheese soften, along with the eggs to room temperature, before I make this.  From crushing oreos to peeling caramels and chopping pecans to letting it sit overnight is a bit of a hassle but it is well worth the work, I promise.

Everyone loved this cheesecake! I used the exact ingredients listed, and made only a few minor changes in technique for this recipe. I needed two cheesecakes in a hurry, so I baked a 8" and a 9" at the same time.  I lined my pans with parchment paper so I could easily move the finished cheesecakes from the pans to bakery boxes. I wrapped the bottom of my pans with foil to avoid spills. I used a modified water bath, reduced the cook time to 50 minutes, and left the cheesecakes in the oven with the door closed until they cooled.  I received numerous compliments like "better than Cheesecake Factory" and "the best cheesecake I have ever eaten".  This recipe is a keeper - I will probably make it again this weekend!

Rich and delicious.  I was concerned it didn't call for a water bath, but my cheesecake did not crack.  Next time I will use less butter, as I believe that is what makes the crust hard and it had melted into the foil I had lined on the outside.  Will also reduce the baking time and temperature as it was fairly brown on top.  Althought it didn't affect the consistency.

I loved this recipe. Will use over and over again. Next time I think I will omit the caramel layer on the crust. Everything else I will keep to the recipe.

I could not find wrapped caramels but one review said they used caramel topping so I used that. I wrapped the pan in foil and cooked it in a water bath like I always do. Right now the crust is oozing apart, and while it seems to taste good, looks terrible.

i made this for Mother's Day and it was such a hit, I've made it several times since.  I have not altered the recipe one bit but I do note that the crust requires some upper body strength to cut through when cutting the cake into slices.  The recommendation to line a cookie sheet with foil and place the spring form pan on that for baking was a great idea.  This was a very heavy cheesecake and I worried about transporting it, and decided to leave the bottom of the spring form pan attached and it transported without incident.  A word of caution: this cake takes me much more than 30 min. prep. time.

Fantastic! I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly!  I think the trick is to not over-beat the cheesecake filling and do not overbake.

Really good but does anyone have tips to make the crust not so hard? Had difficult time cutting it. The actual taste was excellent and not too hard compared to some recipes I saw.

Delicious cheesecake, excellent recipe! I did 1 thing different. I added a sour cream topping just because I love sour cream! Took cheesecake from oven 5 min. before cooking was finished, spread the following  on top & returned to oven. Mixed 1 1/2 cups of sour cream & 2 Tbsp. sugar stirred, poured over hot cheesecake & baked 5 min. more. I than added my caramel & chocolate as per recipe.  Recipe cooked in less time as I had only a 10" springform pan!

Absolutely decadent. I made it with gluten-free pretend Oreos, and it was still delicious. I also used salted caramel for the drizzle, and it gave the whole thing another layer of complexity.

This cheesecake is fabulous! Everyone loves it and you only need a sliver ??.. my daughter is allergic to nuts so I substituted crushed Butterfinger for the pecans and it was perfect, added crunch without a lot of sweet!

Came out pretty tasty.  The cheesecake filling was smooth and not too sweet. The sweetest part of this cake was the oreo crust.  The only thing I didn't realize was how short this cheesecake was, it fills up half a 9" pan (~1.5-2 in.).  The only difference I made was I drizzled 1/2 the caramal topping, sprinkled mini chocolate chips and pecans on top to make it look prettier.

Very easy to make, just followed the recipe. I didn't have the proper pan, so I just used a pie tin and it worked just as well.

This was very good, easy & tasty! I made my own caramel sauce from the recipe on bakersroyale.com. It tastes better to me, and avoids the HFCS and other chems in store bought caramels.

I made this exactly like the recipe.  I made it for my sons birthday, per his request.  It was awesome!! Very rich and creamy!  This was the first cheesecake I have ever made and I thought the taste wasn't far off from something that you would get from the Cheesecake Factory!  Everyone was amazed at how pretty it was and that it looked like it was from a bakery!  Several people asked for the recipe.  Thanks so much for such a fabulous recipe!!

This recipe is wonderful! I added the chocolate chips into the cheesecake instead of melting them for the top but this is the only change I made. My cake fell quite a bit a few min after I removed it from the oven but still looked nice as a finished product!

The cheesecake batter is very delicious.  My disappointment with these cheesecake is the crust and the mess this cheesecake makes in my oven.  I've made this cheesecake 3 times.  I've tried packing the crust tight and I've tried leaving it a little looser but the crust comes out like a rock every time.  The caramel oozes out through the crust and through the bottom of the springform pan and I end up with a gooey burn on mess in the bottom of the oven.. not to mention the intense smoke that results from the burning sugar.  I'm probably not the best baker but golly!  Don't think I'll make this a 4th time.

My first homemade cheesecake and it was a smash hit! This recipe was not only incredibly delicious, but also incredibly easy. I had to borrow a springform pan from sister, but other than that it was a cinch. I made sure to whip the cream cheese on high when mixing the sugar and vanilla extract in and it made for such a light and creamy texture. It was such a hit that I had to promise I'd make it again soon for everyone. Haha!

Use a double boiler to melt the chocolate chips! I tried microwaving them like you do with the caramel. It did not end well. It still tasted amazing without the chocolate drizzled on top.

This is a very good and simple recipe. I would make this again. But I would not put the Carmel on the crust. It made the crust very sticky and hard to cut.

The overall product turned out ok. There's too much butter in the crust mix. I baked mine in a spring form pan on top of a cookie sheet and the cookie sheet had a pool of butter all over it. Would make again with some tweaks to the recipe. Less butter for sure.

This is wonderful cheesecake.  My son in law asked for it for his birthday. I didn’t want to disappoint so I did a trial run a few days before.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  The second one was just as good!  Will make again

This took a little time but was a fairly straightforward, delicious recipe.  I don't like the Oreo cream in my crust so I scraped off all of the cream and only used the cookies.  I used a total of 30 cookies to make up for the lack of cream.  My only problem was I only had chocolate chips on hand and they didn't really melt to a "drizzleable" state.  I put in a teaspoon or so of crisco and that helped immensely with the texture, but it plopped instead of drizzled. And then it hardened in the fridge so it was hard to cut through.  But once I solve that problem, I think I'll have a real winner recipe.  This easily impresses anyone who tries it.  I did leave my cream cheese and eggs out for a couple of hours to soften nicely to avoid lumps.

Easy recipe. The cake turned out great!  New York cheesecake!  I totally messed up the caramel and chocolate by first using dipping caramel and adding milk to that. Too soupy. So I tried again with home caramel. Too stiff. (I didn't mix with milk.). Then I melted the chocolate again without milk. So my topping was like candy and too hard. But the cheesecake was perfect!

Cooked it for 60 minutes on a baking sheet with a pan of hot water below. Then turned off the stove and let it sit for a couple hours. 

I will make this again!  Yum!

I followed all the directions except I used more oreos and butter in the crust as 24 oreos did not cover the bottom and sides of the pan. When I ate the cheesecake the next day I was disappointed, it seemed overcooked and kind of dry. Wouldn't have rated it higher than 2 stars. But 3 days later when I tried another slice the cheesecake surprisingly tasted a lot better! All the flavors meshed well. I even froze most of it and when I thawed and tried another slice it was good. I think if I ever made it again I would do a water bath, as I've done that for past cheesecakes and they turned out as good as the Cheesecake Factory.

Delicious cheesecake!  The Oreo crust made the crust noticibly flavorful.  This cheesecake tasted like it was made by a bakery!  I do recommend putting parchment paper inside the bottom of the springform pan, which will make removal easier.

I made this for my Christmas luncheon. Big hit!
I made a few changes. First, I toasted my pecans in the oven before tossing in the melted caramel. I also used others suggestions and only put the caramel on top the baked cheesecake in fear it would ooze out. Must put a pan under cheesecake, butter from crust does leak a little. I also decided to add 2 tablespoons of sour cream in my mixture. I also made a chocolate ganache and completely covered the caramel-nut mixture. I used heavy cream 1/2 cup and 4 oz semi sweet chocolate and a pinch of salt. Bring cream to a simmer, then add chocolate, salt. Cool ganache before adding to cheesecake. Cover caramel completely or drizzle over top. Very rich, but oh so good. Enjoy!!!

I can't say for the taste, as I made this for a family function to be held tomorrow but it looks fantastic!  I can't imagine it ever tasting bad!  I had no problems with caramel oozing out of the crust but I wrapped the base of my Springform in parchment paper and pressed the Oreo crust up the sides and made sure that the caramel base didn't overflow the cookie crust.  I also did a water bath with the pan wrapped in foil.  I had some butter leakage but it wasn't major.  Side note: I recommend using the parchment paper as I was able to easily remove the cake to a plate for drizzling the caramel and chocolate to make for a great presentation.  I have always had problems serving cheesecakes directly from the pan bottom and half of the crust sticking to the pan.  This eliminates that problem.

Great quick and easy cheesecake....only suggestion is DO NOT put caramel mixture in the crust as instructed....just pour it over the top when done. The crust is impossible to cut after the caramel is cooked! Lost half the cake because no one could eat the crust.

This was easy to make & tasted good. I did not change anything except I used Oreo crumbs from a box rather than crushing them up myself. I did not use a water bath & mine did not crack. However, my crust was a little bit hard to cut & the caramel dripped off the top & out the bottom  by the next day.

This recipe is amazing! Did make a few changes. I added 1 tsp onion salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and a pinch cayenne pepper. I also added some Velveeta cheese. My family hates veggies, but loved this recipe!!!! Also, I recommend doubling this recipe, because it's that good!!!! If you have more than 2 kids, it's a must!!!

Loved this. I've made a multiple times with awesome results each time. My brother even told me I have to bring it to all our family gatherings from now on. It is my daughter's favorite. I do however make a few changes to make it easier to make. I don't use those dumb wrapped caramels. I just use caramel ice cream topping. As much as you like. Then I just put the nuts on top of that. Also, I don't melt the chocolate. Again, chocolate ice cream topping (Hershey).  I just drizzle it over the top after it cools and add more nuts on top of that. The hint to put it on a cookie sheet to catch the butter is a great one too!

Someone else mentioned the prep time is more than 30 min and I second that! I've never made a cheesecake and just unwrapping the caramels and getting the creme out from between the cookies took a half hour. Regardless, this made a very tasty, but rich, cheesecake. This was my virgin voyage and I learned a lot. Read about water baths and decided to do that to ensure even cooking and to avoid cracks.  I'm sure people that cook often know the tricks to get this done quickly but I followed the recipe to the T and took no shortcuts. I'd say this took close to a solid hour to prep. Note: I did bake the crust for 10 min before putting in the layer of caramel & pecans. I didn't have any leaks... Not sure if that's why...? Crust was a little crunchy (which I like!) :)

I love this recipe so much I had to make it two days in a row. I never knew making a cheesecake could be so simple and homemade delicious.

Followed the recipe exact and tasted decadent!  Definitely will make it again.  One thing they don't say is MAKE SURE YOU PUT A PAN UNDER THE PAN.  The caramel oozes out.  Other than that amazing!!

I have made this several times and there is never any left overs. During potlucks at work-the girls would put me down for this every time.

It came out good, but it was way too sweet for my liking.  Next time I will not add the caramel.

used hot fudge topping on top instead of melted chocolate. Used all caramel/pecan mixture on bottom. Drizzled caramel and pecans on top.

I used the Store crust but found the amount of mixture to be way to much for the crust. I also feel like the caramel all over is to much so i may stripe it next time.

This is the first cheesecake I've ever cooked and I love it. I made a few mistakes but it still taste wonderful. Next time I'm definitely using a taller pan and more cookies for my crust. And I have to remember to be more patient lol, I'm use to cooking regular cakes. You can mess with them while they are still hot but not at all with a cheesecake. But hey you cook and you learn, silly lessons you shouldn't of had to. And this will be the first recipe I put on my blog. Can't wait to try more.

Really good but very VERY rich! I think if the cheesecake were a no-bake it'll be better. Also like the other reviews said, DON'T forget to place a cookie sheet underneath the springform pan!!

I use crumbled thin chocolate wafers for the crust.  Great cheesecake.  Whenever I make this and send it to the college, the girls on the hall fight over who wants the extra pieces of this cake...
