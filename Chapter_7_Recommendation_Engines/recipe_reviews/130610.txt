The only variations I made were to omit the pecans as I'm not a fan, and I used baked Lays potato chips as they were all I had on hand.  This is a great way to use leftover turkey to create another dish.  I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

Surprisingly good. The crunchy celery makes this dish- it needs more onion ( a lot more, finely chopped onion - like a whole small onion) Skip the salt - maybe a tiny bit of seasoning salt - I used cornflakes instead of potato chips because I had no chips. I will keep this in line for my after Thanksgiving meals.

I would give this ten stars if I could. It's delicious! I can't believe it's only a four star recipe. I really tried to stick to the ingredients so I could judge it fairly. I made half a recipe with leftover Easter turkey breast and in place of the regular salt, I used both seasoned salt and garlic salt. I did use a whole green onion so that was more than a tsp. but the more onion the better in our opinion! Do Not leave out the pecans, they add a wonderful texture and flavor! My hubby couldn't believe he liked them in this casserole since he never likes them in cold turkey or chicken salad! I also used reduced fat cheese and low fat mayo and we totally couldn't taste a difference in the finished product. Yummy!! I will always use this recipe after holidays and probably look forward to the leftoves more than the holiday meal!

What a wonderful, tasty dish using leftover turkey!  I made the following adjustments based on the ingredients I had:  I used chopped fresh red pepper instead of celery, and I added about 1/2 cup of garbanzo beans because I needed to use them up.  I used seasoned salt, not regular salt.  Also, instead of crushed potato chips, I used crushed white tortilla chips.  I'm guessing the original recipe is tasty, based on everyone's reviews, but what I ended up making was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again!!

Really great way to use left over turkey!  The only thing I did differently, was add our left over cranberry sauce to the mayo and lemon juice.. About 2 tablespoons.  More would have been even tastier!  So good!

Was quite surprised at how much we liked this!  I cut the recipe in half and used a good 1/3 cup of diced onion.  I don't like pecans so we used almonds and it was still great.  Had thought about adding garlic, but decided not to and it was great without garlic and I usually add garlic to everything.  My husband and I kept picking at it and eventually ate all 3 servings between the 2 of us!  Was pretty bummed we had no leftovers.  Very good!  Will make again!

I've been making this same recipe for 20+ yrs.  It's a great way to use leftover turkey.  No need for the salt.  The potato chips, regardless of the kind you use, typically have enough salt for the dish.

This was okay, not spectacular. An okay way to use up left over turkey, certainly edible, but nothing I will be itching to make again.

Great taste but I will leave off the salt next time. May even try a light cream of mushroom soup.  A keeper!

This is the hot salad my Grandma used to make. I substituted water chestnuts like a previous reviewer. It was just fine.

This is a childhood favorite for me, but I do it a bit differently.  Today, I actually made it with ham, because I had a lot leftover after Christmas.  It was just as good.

Here are my regular variations:
*I always use sliced almonds instead of pecans.
*I add 2-3 cans of sliced water chestnuts (drained).
*I add a few dashes of hot sauce.
*I omit the potato chips.
*I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, or a combination of both, or whatever I have on hand that will fit the bill.  (Today, I didn't have enough, so I added a little creamy poppyseed dressing.)

With the extra crunch the water chestnuts give, the potato chips aren't missing--especially not the extra fat.  It almost seems more like a casserole than a salad--or at least to my kids.  They love it.
