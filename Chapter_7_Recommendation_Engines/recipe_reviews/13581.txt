I had to improvise w/ what I had on hand--namely, fresh cranberries. Big mistake. Go with sweetened dried cranberries, but I'd cut out the brown sugar when sauteing the onions. Sweetened cranberries will be enough sweetness for this savory dish.

I really like this dish. It has a very hearty and rich flavor. I thought that six onions might be too much, so I used five. Still very good.

This was surprisingly nice.  I only used one large mayan onion though as opposed to three onions, and the dish still seemed about half onion.  Three would have made it an onion dish garnished with rice.  Also, I didn't want to buy a huge, expensive bottle of orange zest, so I substituted a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate for the zest.

Very good rice dish, with a lot of different flavors that complement each other very well.  The only problem I had with this recipe is my onions didn't 'carmelize', unless that is another word for 'burned'.  Luckily I caught that in time to save most of them.  I didn't have any orange, so just added a couple tablespoons of orange juice, but I think the zest would work best.  I recommend trying this dish if you like the ingredients it requires.

What a delightful recipe! Such a nice change to wild rice with the little bit of orange zest and cranberries.

I used the ingredients listed but changed the cooking method a little.  I sauted the rice, almonds and onions in butter until the onions were done.  To this I added the cranberries, orange zest and liquid.  To this I also added some chicken breasts, covered and baked for 1 hour.  

The chicken was nice and moist and picked up a nice flavor from the cranberries and orange zest.  I will definately make this recipe again!

Fantastic!  I did, however, cook the wild rice separate (just in boiling water) because the directions on the box indicated a longer cooking time than the brown rice.  I doubled the recipe and froze portions for future dinners.  However, neither my husband or my 20-month old cared for it as much.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it once as is and it was really good.  My second attempt I used only 1 onion, which suited our taste a little better.  I also added a tablespoon of butter when combining everything to bring it together a little more and added cinnamon for a twist.  It was out of this world! I didn't measure the cinnamon, just added a couple good dashes from my shaker.  It gives the dish a whole different dimension, and tastes even better the second day!

Very good.  I made the following changes. 1) Made 1/2 cup of wild rice and 1/2cup of red rice in rice cooker with water. 2) No mushrooms. 3) chopped walnuts and no almonds. 4) squeezed a little orange juice into the dish.

Super Easy Super Good. I did however put the almond slices to cook with the rice making them more tender. I cut the onions into smaller slices (making it a little more kid friendly)and I just dried orange peel instead of the zest.
AWESOME reciepe

This is such a good rice dish! I made it for company and they just raved over it, and my hubby liked it so much he asked if I would make it for Thanksgiving.  We just finished dinner, and I have to say, it got tons and tons of compliments! It's a keeper and a new favorite in our house! thanks for the great recipe Kathy!

What an excellent combination of flavors! Aside from using coconut oil and veg broth, I followed the recipe exactly. I grated the orange zest over individual servings for a test run; it's equally delicious both ways. The only change I'd make is to use more mushrooms, because they really complement the wild rice. This is a new favorite!

I've made this recipe for vegans using vegetable broth.  Better with chicken broth, although either one works for me.

This recipe was awesome! Even my 18-month-old loved it! Very easy to make, even if it does take some time. It's not hard -just needs to be started enough in advance. So, no problem there. We didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I just omitted them. Still turned out great. Superb with salmon and green beans! :)

This is easily one of the best side dishes I have ever had.  Took a little time to make, but well worth the time.  I only used one onion as we are not big onion eaters and it was still great.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!!  I did double the rice/chicken stock and then added some extra cranberries/almonds/mushrooms to compensate and it was wonderful. It was decided this was a keeped for future family meals.

This was pretty good!  I used 1 cup of brown rice instead of combination of brown & wild rice since I didn't have wild rice.  I also omitted the mushrooms (hubby hates them) and the nuts (both kids are allergic).  We liked the combination of the rice & onions with the sweetness of the cranberries.  I would make this again!

A very good dish to make with turkey or a pork roast. Nice blending of textures, color & flavor - especially appropriate for autumn dinners, I think. I served it alongside a lamb roast, & although it did not compliment the lamb very well ( actually overpowered the delicate taste of the lamb), I could tell it was a keeper on its own. The leftovers went fantastically with a pork roast, & I'll bet turkey would be even better. Pairing it w/lamb was my own blunder. Thanks for sharing a fine recipe!

This rice is delicious. I made it for a Thanksgiving luncheon at work and was a success. I made some changes to the ingredients. Instead of brown rice, I used jasmine rice since the wild rice I bought was mixed with brown rice. I definitely recommend it. Thank you!

Did not change the recipe.  I like all the ingredients, however the next time I make it, I will cut the cranberries down to half a cup.  The full cup made it way too sweet for me.  Seems that 3 onions would be over the top, but it's not.  Go ahead and use the 3.   Walnuts or pecans would also go well in this dish.

I've made this several times and we love it! I do "eyeball" measuring and often use more of some ingredients (such as the mushrooms), and I always double the recipe. It freezes well, and is just as good when thawed and heated!

This was only ok.  It was too much work to just out okay.  All three of us found it to be on the bland side.  I did leave out the orange zest but that wouldn't have saved it.

Absolutely wonderful!  I can keep eating this.  The almonds gave a nice crunch.  I also cooked them with the rice and used dried cherries as well as the cranberries.  So yummy and healthy
