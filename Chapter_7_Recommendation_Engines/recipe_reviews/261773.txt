This was great! I used diced tomatoes with green chiles and King’s Hawaiian Savory Butter rolls. The glaze added enough sweetness that I didn’t feel the sweet rolls were needed. You’ll need about half of the glaze is all. I also cooked the onions with some diced garlic in the same pan I cooked the bacon in, then added the beef to brown. Served four of us and we were stuffed.

These were good! I did use a different brand slider bun because the Hawaiian are a little too sweet for us. I made a different recipe earlier in the week and there wasn't enough glaze and the preparation for it was a hassle. The ingredient amounts are spot on in this recipe. The one change I might make next time is to use picante sauce instead of diced tomatoes. If you were to make these for a party, I guarantee you they won't last long.

Fantastic! I made these for a potluck and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. Since I was making them ahead of time, I assembled the sliders and wrapped them up. Then when I got to the party, I added the glaze and baked them. Just keep an eye on them when baking, because the glaze can burn if left in too long. I did like someone's suggestion of putting them on hamburger buns for a full meal. I might try that next time.

Made these for our card playing group and they were a hit. Next time i am using hamburgers buns and feeding them to my family as a main dish. I agree the Kings Hawaiian rolls are a bit too sweet.

I make these sliders frequently. They are so good and just the right size. I don't use the sesame seeds, but I don't think the flavor suffers any. Love that these refrigerate and reheat OK because I always make extra.

These are delicious! I used King’s Hawaiian Savory Butter rolls after reading previous comment. They were perfect. Going to make more for my Bible study group when I'm bringing treats.  Think I might freeze some for later snacks.
