This was really good, very simple, and quick. I used it as a base recipe though. I had a couple of pork chops in the freezer. I used left over fresh broccoli, left over fresh mushrooms, bell pepper, and onions. I also used ground ginger instead of fresh since it was what I had on-hand. I will use this again for sure.

Simple to make, and flavorful sauce.  Next time I will marinate the meat in the sauce mixture.

Very tasty for a quick recipe. I used leftover pork chops that were already cooked, but it still came out great. For once I had everything on hand, so I'm sure I'll be using this one again next time I'm in a pinch.

I followed the recipe using cooked pork loin. Great way to create a new meal out of the yesterday's left overs.

It's okay.  I did make the mistake of putting all the ingredients in the marinating bag together with the meat for about an hour in the fridge.  Maybe that affected how the taste/sauce turned out.
