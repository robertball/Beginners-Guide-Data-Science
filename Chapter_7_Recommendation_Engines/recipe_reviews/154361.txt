I used this as a sauce for some burritos I made with black beans and lime rice and it was YUMMY!! Just a warning, it is a bit on the spicy side so cut back on the jalapenos if you like mild. I did make some minor changes--I only had 9 tomatillos, and I forgot to add the jalapenos to the food processor so I just chopped them up. Also, I used fresh cilantro instead of dried--probably about 15 sprigs. When I tasted it I thought it needed a little more flavor so I added a small can of chopped anaheims and added additional chicken bouillon powder. I love the idea of the lettuce in it just because it is so different.

I thought this was fabulous! I used fresh cilantro (about 15 sprigs) but that is the only change I made. I was not thrilled with the idea of can jalapenos but I had some in the fridge and my garden tomoatillos needed used so I decided why not? The lettuce makes for a nice consistency and the cumin flavor really comes through nicely. I was very impressed with the outcome on this one.

Of course I love it!  It's my recipe LOL!  Usually though I make it when I make tamales and instead of using chicken broth, I parboil the chicken then finish cooking it in the salsa.  YUMMY!
