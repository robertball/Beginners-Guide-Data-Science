This recipe is exactly the same as the English Muffin Bread submitted by Jo.  The only difference is, one is called a bread and other is called a loaf - otherwise everything is exactly the same.

Definitely not the same taste as a traditional english muffin I'm used to but still had a good taste.

I've made quite a number of different English Muffin loaf recipes and this one is the best I've found.  No need to look further.  This is SO good toasted with butter on it.  I like peanut butter too.  You won't be disappointed.

Very nice toasted and for breakfast.  I guess it's the baking soda that puts the holes in the bread.  Really easy, and because I made very small loaves ended up with 3 of them.  I'm freezing two of them for when I don't feel like making bread.  Didn't have any issues with the dough being too sticky or not sticky enough.  I did roll in corn meal before baking just to make them a tad more English muffin-y.  Thanks for the recipe!
