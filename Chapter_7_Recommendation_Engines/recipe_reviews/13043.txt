Made this on a day when comfort food was what I wanted and it filled the bill admirably. Changed the method a bit, though because having to wash two stockpots would have made it that much less comforting. Cooked the onion, as directed, then added the potatoes and carrots to the onion, sauteed for about 5 minutes on medium low heat, added vegetable broth, brought to a boil, and then simmered, covered, for about 15 minutes, till potatoes were tender. Added herbs and pepper, and 2 cups of milk. Whisked flour with the other cup of milk, and added it to the simmering soup. Cooked till thickened. Served bowls of grated cheese and crumbled bacon (for the meat eaters in the family) on the side, and some lovely cheese toast. Felt much better afterward. Thanks so much.

Let me say that I was skeptical about the outcome of this recipe....I was wooried that it wasn't going to turn out right...It turned out fabulous!!  My husband commented all throughout dinner how much he liked the soup....I took the advice of others and sauted some celery with the leaves along with the margarine and onions....and I diced up some baby carrots with my chopper to cook along with the potatoes....and I topped the soup with some crumbled bacon and cheese...just needed to add a bit of salt....WONDERFUL!!!  Will be making again and again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this soup and is very tasty...I substituted milk with Pet evaporated milk. I added Celery (leaves included), broccoli floweretes (as I love broccoli)and sauteed with the onions and I used straight Chicken Broth in lieu of Chicken bouillon..I did not use Parsley and Thyme at all...Don't think its needed...I made homemade croutons seasoned with garlic/butter/and parsley..Topped the soup with chopped green onions, bacon bits, cheese, and croutons....It was very good and the family loved it...I didn't add flour to the onions/broccoli/and celery...I added flour last to the soup by mixing the flour with cold water real good, then added to soup.  I mixed one Tablespoon of flour into soup at a time so as to reach the consistency of thickness I wanted because of using Pet evaporated milk as its thicker than milk.  Will definitely make again...

This has become my little black dress of creamy soups and it's never failed me.  It's a solid base that you can accessorize however you wish.  The first time I made this I sauteed with olive oil rather than butter, and I replaced water for whey leftover from making cheese (with non-fat powdered milk, no less).  It was hands-down the best potato soup I've ever had, and not a soul would believe it didn't have butter (and lots of fat) in it.  Even better the second time around.  

Realize here that you're making a roux - if you don't know about roux it's worth looking up so you understand how it works.

TO MAKE THIS VEGAN you can sub some things.  I cook the potatoes in salted water.  Cook just onion on the stove with some canola oil.  When onions are done add a few more Tbls of canola oil and flour.  Stir in your non flavored almond milk and stir until it boils.  Add in your potatoes and 
season to your liking and you have a great soup!
I have now made this many, many times with many variations.  I tried it the other day adding a can of veggie broth to the flour/oil mixture and a combo of almond and coconut milk.  REALLY good, will now be the variation I use most.  The broth adds some flavor and the coconut milk is creamier than just almond milk

Excellent soup!  I didn't have enough milk, so, like another reviewer, I used a can of evaporated milk.  I think that actually made it more creamy.  I, too, sauted one celery stalk (with the leafy top) with my onion.  A great soup, thanks Cyd.

Excellent recipe!  My family loves it.  I recommend fresh parsley instead of dried.  Also, I used 2.5 cups of milk instead of the 3 that the recipe called for and beef bouillon instead of chicken.

Husband loved it and had 3 helpings and so did daughter.  I did not have dried thyme but we like extra pepper-we also used 3 chicken bouillon cubes as I did not have the powder.  It was awesome.  Just enough for 3 of us.

This is a great basic potato soup, I too, add a couple of stalks of celery tops and all chopped. for variety, instead of making the flour roux I cooked the onion (I use half and onion) and celery in butter, then added the chicken broth, parsley and some pepper and cooked til potatoes were done and added a cup of cubed Velveeta, and some whole milk to bring it to the consistency I wanted. I don't add extra salt due to the salty broth and cheese. You also don't have to add thyme and carrots.

This was a great soup.  Not too runny, not too chunky.  I will be using this soup as the base for clam chowder--great taste and excellent consistency.  Thanks very much!

I loved this recipe so much I double it when making it for a family of four. It is usually consumed within 24 hours.  I do add minced garlic to the onions and red pepper flake to the soup. Delicious!!

This was disappointing. The potatoes stayed in firm chunks rather than becoming a thick soup, and the flavor was bland. If you want an excellent potato soup, try Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup if you're ready to go all out, or, for the more calorie conscious, Russian Mushroom and Potato Soup, both on this site.

Good base recipe.  Needed chicken bullion for more flavor.  I also added some fresh grated Romano cheese to the pot.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese and chopped scallion as a garnish.

excellent recipe!  I followed some of the reviews and only used one pot.  I diced the carrots extra small (so my picky eaters couldn't pick them out) and sauted them with the onions.  I then added 2 cups vegi broth, pepper and potatoes. After the potatoes are cooked i added a bag of frozen broccoli and 3 cups organic half and half.  Served it with crumbled bacon and shredded cheese on top. yuuummmmm.  definitly a keeper.

Excellent soup and sooo easy. I used red potatoes which have the advantage of just having to be scrubbed instead of peeled which saved a lot of time.   I used Knoor vegetable bouillon granules which have a lot of flavor. I did not have any dried thyme, so I just omitted it but used fresh parsely. I used some of the cookingwater/broth to add to the flour paste (it didn't specify but otherwise the soup would have been too thick for my taste). At the end I mashed the potatoes inside the pot and it turned out like a chowder. Very yummy. Will definitely make again especially since it was quick and easy.

Delicious!   I added bacon and 1 extra bouillon cube.  I used 3 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of bacon grease to cook the onions.  I didn't have parsley so I just added 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.   I don't typically care for potato soup but this was really good.

I just made this soup for dinner tonight and I found this to be very quick and easy just what I needed. It is a basic soup but I find that when you have a good base then you add to it what you and your family enjoy. I always add bacon and cheese to mine, thats what my family enjoys. Thanks for the great easy recipe

Very yummmy!  Perfect for a cold winter day.  I never change a thing when I review a recipe, and didn't make an exception here.  Great as is.  For those who MUST post their changes, Allrecipes also has an option to post your own, go there first!  This was great, thanks for sharing.

Just like my mom used to make!!!  I didn't vary from the original recipe at all except I made it vegan.  I used soy milk (original unsweetened) and Smart Balance butter (which is vegan).  It turns out super creamy and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I used leftover red potatoes and corn on cob from a low country boil. I cut the corn off the cob.I used half & half for 50% of the milk. I also used natural chicken stock instead of bouillon and water. It is delicious!!

Made tthis once before, and follwed annother cooks advice, only using one pot. It was parvelous! Even the kids liked it! I loaded it up with plenty of celery and carrots..good veges =). Added some crumbled bacon and shreded cheeses. Yum! this time i'm adding lean ground beef, browned. Less potatoes to reduce the carbs for hubby...used 2% evaporated milk, and before it'sall done...gently went thru the pot with a potato masher. Good thing i get to taste test...cause there wont be any leftovers! LOL

This is the best potato soup recipe I have come across. It's easy, doesn't require the use of a blender, doesn't have a lot of ingredients, and everything in it is usually already in my kitchen!  You can really make it on the spur of the moment.

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever tried! Loved how easy and fast it was to make.  Even my picky three year old loved it and he doesn't like potatoes!

Good soup base to start with and make your own changes to.  It turned out much better than most soup recipes since it starts with a roux.

Great recipe. I added celery and about 1 Tbsp extra flour (because my husband likes thicker soup). My son also liked this soup! I will definitely make this again.

This was really, really good. I think I upped the carrots a bit and upped the chicken bullion a little, but this was just the potato soup recipe I was looking for-- one without heavy cream or bacon! I used lactose-free milk.

A simple and very satisfiying soup.  I have tried other more complicated potato soup recipes, but this one has the best flavor.  The flavor of the potatoes, not all tne seasonings, really stands out. Be sure to try it!

This is delicious. I was worried about making it dairy-free for an allergy, but it worked perfectly. I used coconut milk (Thai Kitchen and So Delicious) and Earth Balance butter.

My version turned out bland. To save it, I added another teaspoon of the chicken buillon powder, some potato flakes (I had only 5 potatoes on hand), crushed red pepper flakes and a cup of water, as my soup was very thick. The final result was OK, but not great.

Fabulous!  I added a small can of creamed corn and used about 4 cups of pre-cut hash brown potatoes instead of the 6 potatoes - topped with sour cream, cheese, and Baco Bits - it was, according to my sister, "the best soup I ever tasted!"

Best potato soup I've ever had! I didn't have parsley and added celery. Thyme in potato soup is new to me, but soooo good. I think this is the ONLY thing I've cooked and not added garlic to. It's perfect without it.... never thought I would say that about anything lol. Seriously AWESOME!

i made this recipe last night, i did just make half of it since it was just myself eating it...really wish i would have made the whole thing. I did leave out the carrots and the parsely and thyme. I did cook the potatoes slightly longer and i mashed them up and when the soup was done I blended it. Very good very creamy perfect for someone that just got teeth pulled and wants to eat adult food lol. I'll probably be making this again next week. I did add some cheddar chz which is good with it too.

Nice simple soup, I added a little parmesan cheese at the end of cooking and I also sautéed a stalk of celery with the onion. I will defiantly make this soup again. My vegetarian daughter made this soup using veggie stock equally as good.

I was very skeptical the entire time I was cooking this.  The recipe does not specify to dice the onions, firstly, and then it probably ought to say that the roux mixture needs to thicken rather than just saying "until warmed through".  And so I had little hope for this soup...BUT, it was GREAT!!  I hoped for a creamier soup and so I ran about 2 cups through the blender and then I also took another reviewer's advice and added a can of corn, but my review of 5 stars stands before the corn was added (that was just an afterthought...it is not needed).

I was a bit worried about doing a roux base - mine never turns out right.  But this turned out fantastic.  I threw in some broccoli too, which I would do again.  Great recipe and so easy.  This is a definate repeat!

After looking through all those potatoe soup recipes, I am sure glad to have grabbed this one. My son accidently erased it, but my husband had already bokmarked it and saved it with out us knowing. He loved it and ate the whole pot!

This was great! I used 3 bouillon cubes. I softened the onion in butter, added potatoes and carrots and let cook for a minute while stirring. I added water, added 2 cups milk and whisked last cup milk with 4 tbsp flour in separate bowl then added into soup. I added salt and pepper and just a sprinkle of thyme.  It is a great soup for a cold, snowy day like today!

I used almost about a half a cup of flour to thicken up the broth. The soup still had great flavor also used 6 boulioun cubes instead of powder. My family devoured the whole pot. Can't wait to make it again to add a few extras...bacon and celery.

Great Base Recipe! I did tweak a bit but thats because i had not choice based on what i had in the pantry. I boiled 3 cups water, the creamy chicken season packet out of a pack of ramen(i didnt have chx bouillion),  about 8 small golden potatoes cubed with skin-on, a dash of thyme, basil, & parsley. In a sep pan i fried 5 pieces of bacon let cool, crumbled, added to potatoes. I put the flour, & milk in the bacon grease along with garlic & onion powder made soupy gravy added to potatoes simmered for 5 mins added shredded cheddar & mozz voila tweaked on hand potato soup!! YUMO

This is the best potato soup I have ever tried!  I did add 2 teaspoons of salt for a little extra flavoring - worked wonders and we never have any left!  Neighbors and family members request this soup at gatherings...

This soup was just ok. I used fresh parsley instead of dried, and real butter in place of margarine. After adding additional bouillon and sprinkling some sharp cheddar on top there still wasn't as much flavor as I was hoping for. It still made a very pleasant supper. Maybe I should have let the roux get a little toastier?

This soup is fabulous!!!  I added 3 minced cloves of garlic for a little exra kick.  A GREAT recipe!  I substituted half the milk for heavy cream but it made the soup very thick.  Next time I'm going to just use milk like the recipe calls for.

This is great! I cooked the onion with 2 stalks celery, then just threw everything together into the pot, at the same time (I added the parsley after it was already cooked). I didn't need the roux, and I added some diced polska kielbasa. The thyme in the dish is wonderful, my husband has been sneaking tastes the whole time it's been cooking! Great recipe!

My husband, mom, step-dad, and I all LOVED this potato soup!  My hubby normally doesn't like soup, but he sure devoured it and agreed he loved it!  :-)  He said it was "RESTAURANT STYLE"!  I did add some chopped chives to it and didn't use parsley as I didn't have any on hand, and it still turned out great!

This is sooooo good.  I was looking for a great potato soup recipe that was like the one my husband's mother made. He loved this one.  I added more pepper and salt and also some dried chopped chives.  It was wonderful. I will definitely cook this again

Excellent soup!  My family loves this one.  I have made it four times already! We break up the potatoes pretty good in the final cooking stage so that it makes a very hearty soup.  Also, we add a bit more pepper for our taste.  Great recipe!

I took advice from Susiekew: sauted onions, added potatoes to onions, sauted 5 min, added chicken boullion to 3 c boiling water, added to onion/potato in pan, simmered 15 min til potatoes were tender, stirred 2 c milk, brought to simmer, whisked 3 T flour into remaining cup milk, stirred into pan & cooked to thicken. Wasn't thick enough for my taste so put about a cup & a half in the blender & pulsed til mostly smooth, poured it back in the pan. Turned out DELICIOUS. Thanks Susiekew for the tips.

This soup is terrific! We don't eat meat, and I wanted to use items in my kitchen, so these are the changes: I used "I can't believe it's not butter", sliced 3 carrots (for color and because I really like them), Used 3 Tbls. of "Better than Bouillon", and used almost 4 cups of 1% milk with a cup of buttermilk, some of which I pureed and added, and I  lightly steamed some broccoli and added that. I only added pepper, since the broth was very flavorful on its own! Will definitely be making this all through the fall and winter!

Marvelous recipe.  I tweaked it just a bit by omitting the carrots but adding diced ham and a liberal amount of sour cream.  It tasted wonderful.  Thanks.

Delicious...my boyfriend loves it, and I thought the thyme at the end was a bit too much, but it does add a unique and not unpleasant flavor...next time I'll use a smaller pinch. Otherwise, very good soup, and lower in fat using 1% milk, which didn't make it runny at all. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times.  The only advice that I can offer is if using dried thyme make sure you us the exact measurement don't just guess, if you use too much it will make the soup taste strange, I often use fresh thyme with great success.   I like to add more carrots than the soup calls for to add color. 
Great recipe, definately helps warm up a cold winter night.

This turned out wonderful even though I substituted soy milk for the real milk.  I mashed some of the potatoes after they were cooked to make the soup more creamy and thick since soy milk doesn't thicken like cow's milk.  This recipe's a keeper - simple and delicious.

My life wouldn't be complete without this recipe! I have made it a hundred times and shared it with so many friends. I make it a touch healthier  by replacing the butter wi olive oil and using non-fat milk. I also add celery and dill(because I love dill). Is really a blank canvas that you can do a little different every time. I serve it with grilled cheese and tomato bacon sandwiches!

The first time I made this it wasn't creamy enough. So the next time I made it I cooked the onions, flour and milk longer until it was thick, then added it to the potato and carrot mixture. It was much creamier and my family really likes it. I will keep making it.

The recipe, as written, is bland.  It needs cheese and salt to flavor it.  I used vegetable stock and didn't have parsley.

This is a very yummy, hearty soup.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I did like another viewer suggested and put the potatoes in with onions after they were translucent, then added water.  I mixed dry milk powder with the flour and added to water when potatoes were cooked.  (I didn't have carrots, either, but it would be really nice with them.)  I seasoned the soup as stated, except I forgot the thyme, and I added garlic powder to boost the flavor.  It was really good, and would be even better served with chopped bacon pieces and cheese like others recommended!  Good, fast and tasty is always what I need, and this fit the bill nicely!

I made a vegetarian version of this soup, with a few changes here and there. I added Indian spices to the onion roux and it turned out phenomenally! I used yukon golds, leaving the skin on, and processed a few cups of the potato/carrot mixture to make the final product extra creamy. Great recipe, I will be using this one again!

A good basic cream of potato soup.  I used salted butter and chicken base, and thought it still needed a bit more salt.  Also, I left out the thyme and added a little garlic powder.  It tasted even better the next day.  Will definitely make this soup again.

This was an excellent potato soup.  The thyme adds a gourmet touch to this dish.  My only adjustment to this dish was to use skim milk and to add a little salt.  A keeper recipe!

It's the thyme that makes this recipe so good.  I think the chicken broth version tastes a lot better than the vegetarian version using veggie stock.  I thought both versions were good though. This is a recipe that is in regular rotation in my household.  I love it!

Thanks for the great soup recipe! I added garlic and celery and mashed the cooked potatoes, as others did. I always have trouble making a roux, so I had to run the flour mixture through a sieve (I had already removed the onion from the pan). Mostly I left the rest the same. Yummy!

Made this last night and consumed 3 cups myself, can't wait to try it again today. Followed the receipe, but added 4 crushed garlic cloves and a touch of red pepper flakes. Also used the boat blender to partialy break down some of the potatoe carrot mixture to give a thicker base. The onion, butter flour roux is an important step and I wouldn't want to add the flour to the liquid portion as you would get the uncooked flour flavor.  This is a great basic soup which can be altered in many directions.  It tastes many times better than it sounds.

Delicious! We like our potato soup a little thicker so after I cooked the potatoes I mashed them just a bit. Didn't put quite as much onion in. Other than that kept everything the same and it was fabulous!

I can 'feel' my Grandmother when I eat this soup.  I've searched a long time for the recipe I remember as a child and this one is the closest ever. I made it exactly as written here and it's excellent.

I agree you could vary the ingredients and have a successful soup but this one is just exceptional and so quick and simple I'll use it in my kitchen from today onwards.

Thank you Cyd! :)

Absolutely fantastic soup.  The only change I made was adding a few stalks of chopped celery.  Great results for something so very easy.  For the potatoes, I used Yukon Gold which I think worked out nicely.

Delicious!  I added bacon & instead of using 1/4 cup margarine, I used 1/4 cup of bacon grease to sautee the onion & diced celery! I also added white pepper to taste. I will make this again!
Oh & if you aren't good with making the roux, you can use instant potatoes to thicken the base.

I decided to try this recipe because it looked easy, and I was trying to find a close approximation of a corn/potato soup that a friend made for me a while back.  I added a package of frozen corn to the recipe.....and it was heavenly!  I also tried replacing the carrot with celery, but I didn't like that as much, and neither did the kids.  But I say the added corn is a must for a one-dish dinner soup.

I followed the recipe as written. I used Yukon gold potatoes because they are my favorite and everyone loved it. A few even said it was the best potato soup they'd ever eaten. Everyone in my family from 5 to 93 liked it!! I'll definitely make it again.

This may be the best vegetarian potato soup I’ve ever made. To make it vegan I used vegetable broth, vegan butter, and a mix of coconut and almond milk. So yummy! Perfect for a winter lunch or dinner, served with a crusty bread.

I really enjoyed this soup along with my husband.  I followed the recipe except I used vegetable stock and almond milk.  It was fairly easy to make.  I will make it again.

This was very good. I was looking for a potato soup without celery and without meat, and this popped up. I didn't really have enough potatoes, just eight really small rather old ones, but I cooked it anyway. I boiled my potatoes in their skins, sauteed the onions and added the carrots in thin slices to the saute. Then I made the roux and added soy milk, which worked fine, and the other ingredients. I peeled the cooked potatoes, diced them, and then added them. The soup looked good but without enough potato and not as thick as I would like. My fault, since I started out without enough potatoes! So I added some instant mashed potato flakes I found in the cupboard - I never use them, not sure why I even had them! That worked out great and I loved the nice thick soup. Next time I'll try it with the right amount of potatoes!

OMG, This soup is fabulous exactly as it is!  I didn't "change" any of the original recipe but I did add celery. Every soup I make has onion, celery, and carrots so I simmered the celery with the onion.  COOKING TIP FROM EMARALD LEGASSE} He once said, "Use red/orange, yellow, and green ingredients for all full course meals because it causes you to "wow" the dish! That's why restaurants will use a vegetable garnish (such as parsley) on your plate! Try it with your family and I promise you'll wow them before they take their first bite! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> As for recipes: One pet peeve I have is when an ingredient is small, medium, or large. It's not possible to know what each person sees as small, medium, or large.  So I prefer the use of cup or weight amounts in order to make it exactly the same way every time. EXACT MEASUREMENTS I USED FOR THIS RECIPE: 8 cups potatoes, cut bite-size, 2 c. carrot coins, 2 c. onion, diced, 2 c. celery,diced.  TAKE NOTE: I always create my own soups but have never perfected potato soup.  But now I have the perfect one!  THANK YOU!  This soup deserves SIX STARS!

This was very good but I made a few changes. I left out the carrots because I'm not a fan. I also left out the chicken boulion. I added a decent sized clove of garlic, minced, once the onions were translucent. I cooked the onions and garlic in a sweet cream butter instead of margarine. After making the rue and adding the milk, once it thickened some, I added salt and pepper to taste. Then I added the potatoes, not quite cooked all the way and water they were boiled in, into the other pan with the sauce. Simmered that for a few minutes and added the parsley and added a small bunch of green onions, chopped. Then added 2 cups of cheddar cheese and stirred it in until blended and served. Good guide to go by for the method.

This is my favorite potato soup and it's just the way I like it. I have been looking for a recipe for so long that was like this. I used half and half and heavy cream since I happened to have them in the fridge, then thinned it out with water. I left the rest exactly as the recipe called for. Everybody LOVED it! It would be easy to add extra things (corn, celery, ham, etc.) to change it for personal preference. Thank you for this recipe!!!

I have to rate this 5 stars along with the other reviews.  I made it exactly like the receipe, except that I mixed milks.  I didn't have alot of regular milk, so I used a cup of whole milk, 1 1/2 cups of evaporated milk, and 1/2 cup of skim milk.  I have never made potato soup before, but with all the mmmmmm's and ahhhhhh's at dinner tonight, I will definitely be making it again.  Delicious!!

Very good, but I made so many changes I'm sure that the flavor was very different...Used yellow, red-skinned potatoes, well-scrubbed and with the skin on. Substituted celery (kept the leaves on, finely chopped) for carrots since I don't like cooked carrots. I added the spices while the onions were cooking to bring out their flavor. I also added 1/2 tsp of curry because I knew once I got going I was going to try to make this more similar to a cream of ___ soup, and curry really enhances cream of ___ soups; I also wanted a little kick so added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. Then I poured in the chicken broth right away rather than at the end, and boiled the potatoes in that, not separately in water. Also, I pureed about 1/2 of the soup and then returned it to give it that creamy texture without all of the calories. I thought it tasted great with a dollup of sour cream and my husband cut 1/2 bratwurst into his. So much for low-cal!

Very good.  I used chicken broth instead of water and olive oil instead of butter.
I also used celery and carrots. What a great addition to my recipes.

I have made this several times and my family loves it!  Yummy with cheese and bacon on top.  I usually boil the potatoes in the same pot with the onion (which I puree and then cook with the butter and some garlic) then puree some of the potatoes to thicken the base a bit before adding the milk.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Comfort food at its best!  This is the best homemade potato soup I've ever had and first I've ever made.  The only thing I really needed to do was liberally add salt.  A little bland for me in the beginning but after adding salt all the flavors came out made my taste buds happy!  I also added two more carrots for color and taste and added a few dashes of garlic powder.  I might even add some garlic cloves next time to the onions.  (I LOVE garlic in everything.)  I don't own two large stock pots so I had to compensate.  After cooking the onion (oh, and I used real butter, not margarine which is bad for you...use olive oil if you're scared of butter) I threw in the carrots and potatoes and only used about 2 cups of water.  I added the chicken stock base (plus an extra Tbsp.), stirred well, and let simmer for about 10 minutes.  In a seperate bowl I whisked together 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup half and half, and about 5 tbsp flour.  I then added that mixture to the potatoes and sprinkled in the thyme and parsley and let sit on very low heat for a while to allow the flavors to come together.

Great base soup but here's what I did:
INGREDIENTS
•	1 stick butter 
•	2 large onion 
•	5 potatoes, peeled and diced
•	1 canned New Potato 
•	15 baby carrots, diced 
•	3-4 cups chicken stock 
•	1 chicken bouillon cube 
•	3 T black pepper
•	2 t salt 
•	6 T all-purpose flour 
•	3 cups 2% milk 
•	¼ cup Real Bacon Bits
•	1 cup mild shred. cheddar cheese
•	2 T tarragon
•	4 T dried chives (or fresh)
•	4 T dried parsley  (or fresh)

DIRECTIONS
1.	In a large stock pot melt the butter add the onions and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent. 
2.	While the onions are cooking, place the diced potatoes (add canned potatoes once the other potatoes and carrots are cooked- New Potatoes are already cooked), carrots, chicken stock, and chicken bouillon cube in another stock pot and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not over cook. Season with ground black pepper and salt to taste. 
3.	Add the flour to the cooked onions to make a paste. Gradually add the milk and stir well. Cook over medium-low heat until thickens. Then add bacon bits, cheese, parsley, chives, tarragon. Add the potato and carrot mixture. Serve hot.

The soup was average. It was't clear if you were supposed to drain the potatoes before putting into the milk mixture or if you need to added the water/broth to the mixture along with the potatoes. The soup was good enough for an Sunday  afternoon meal, but the leftovers sat in the fridge until they needed to be thrown out.

I loved this recipe and my family did too.  I made a few small changes to fit our tastes.  Instead of the chicken bullion & water, I used prepared chicken stock.  It turned out great!  I'll be making this again. THANKS!

I liked this soup but unless it had modifications I don't think I would make it again.  It tasted kind of bland in my opinion.  I added more salt, but that didn't help very much.  I followed it to the T otherwise.  It would have gotten 3 stars, but since it is healthy and extremely filling (I had 1/2 bowl and was completely full), it gets 4 stars.  I think it may be the type of potatoes I used.  I used red ones.  Not too sure.  It was okay.

This was pretty good.  I added 2 cups of cheddar cheese to it to thicken it up, it was a little watery.  I also added 2 more Tbls of flour.

This was good.  The carrots were a twist I wasn't used to.  I blender my soups after making them because I like creamy over chunky.  Pretty solid recipe, I didn't change much.  I added a bit more butter to make it richer because you can never have too much butter.  :)  I'll try this again for sure.

mmm mmm GREAT!  i made a few changes and it turned out wonderfully!  i used 8 potatoes instead of 6 because a few were on the small side.  i also added an extra carrot, 2 stalks of chopped celery and some fresh, sliced mushrooms.  to compensate for the extra vegetables i used an extra cup of water and an additional 1/2 cup of milk.  i also used mushroom flavored "better than bullion" and threw in some extra spices for flavor.  it made WAY more than 6 servings.  i'd say about 12, but it freezes well.

Yummy! I added in lotsa black pepper to my soup, just because I love pepper. A good creamy hearty soup for my wintery days.

Thank you for this recipe.  I didn't have the chicken bouillon so I added some salt to this.  I didn't add the parsley or thyme either.  With all that it was still wonderful.  Definite comfort food.

I liked this as a starter recipe.  I thought, however, it lacked flavor.  Once following the directions, I made the onion/flour/milk portion again and added a jalapeno (chopped) and 4 garlic cloves.  I then added that to the soup and it really made a big difference in flavor.  I definitely plan on making this recipe again!

I’m giving this a four because it really needed celery. I added celery and a sprinkling of sharp cheddar and green onions on top. It turned out pretty good. But it really needs celery.

I made it all in a soup pot. I used 6 sliced bratwurst sausage and once browned, sautéed them with the onions and butter. I doubled the recipe and used 6 chicken bullion packs, 12 potatoes and a pre-bought package of matchstick carrots. For spices, I threw in salt and pepper, thyme, oregano and lots of dill. I didn’t bother with any flour for thickening because it had an awesome chunky texture and didn’t need it. With a few tweaks, this soup was really amped up and very good!!

Was simple and easy. I added celery and some peas. Would make a great pot pie filling if I just thickened it up. Great for a tender tummy. Filled me up with just a small amount.

I had to alter it a bit for flavor because it seemed too simple for a meal. But those are my tastes. I like the concept of boiling the potatoes and carrots in broth and seasonings while preparing the white sauce in the other pan. It gives the illusion of a longer cook time. I reduced it to one serving, browned two slices bacon (removed) then added a couple T of butter to the fat. Added the onion and some chopped celery with tops per reviews, then flour. Closer to two cups warmed milk whisked in and simmered for about twenty minutes. Dash of nutmeg and a quarter of a cup of Ricotta  because I had it, and salt. Then added the potato, carrot broth and simmered till blended. Topped with chopped bacon and fresh parsley. Fed the man soup with cheese toast and he was pleased. Totally will do again.  Very flexible soup! Thank you for the inspiration!

i have a hard copy from All Recipes that I PRINTED off in Feb 1999.  I have tweaked it over the years.  Many more potatoes and more butter and cream.  Spices etc. Some would say it's not the same recipe.  But I was a young cook at that time that didn't know how to cook any soup unless it was from a can and this recipe gave me a start in cooking souls of all kinds and have me confidence to start a culinary journey that I love and for that....I appreciate this recipe greatly!!  Five stars for sentimental reasons!!!!

used small red potatoes cut in quarters but otherwise about the same. Good flavor. Did add some shredded cheddar to top of bowl. Maybe some crumbled bacon too next time.

Very good, and quick to make. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I like a little kick to my soups. I'm not sure what to add to make it a little spicier, but it was a very good soup as presented.

Excellent !  One of the best soup recipes I have ever made.  A little chunky , very creamy and lots of veggies.  I followed the recipe as written with one  option, I added 2 ribs of celery finely chopped with the carrots  cooked this for about 10 minutes before adding the diced potatoes.  This recipe will be filed under "Favorites".  Thank You

I used this recipe as a Base for my first time attempt at potato soup.. I added freshly chopped bacon, minced garlic & organic Kale, and I garnished each bowl with cheddar cheese. My family asked that I make it again Soon..Delicious! Next time I may add sausage but then it may taste too much like my Zuppa Toscano Soup :  )

I love this recipe! It’s a great one for our family as we generally have the ingredients on hand. I don’t have a pot big enough for both elements of this, so end up mixing them together in the large serving bowl. My only substitution is when I’m lazy and don’t have vegetable broth mix

This is a great soup.  Instead of 3 cups of water, I only used one with 2 cups of chicken broth.  Although my husband is a meat and potatoes man, he really liked this.

really good and easy to make, I played around a little and added in some green onions for extra flavor; sometimes I put in some broccoli with the carrots and potatoes, but I add it after theyve been boiling for a while because broccoli cooks faster

YUM!  This is the ultimate comfort food, my husband and i both loved it.  I omitted the parsley, but did add the thyme, which brought a lovely flavor.  I used chicken stock instead of boullion and then needed to add some salt.  I also did a corn starch slurry added after boiling instead of a flour roux to make it wheat free.

Preface by saying that not only do I not cook very much, I'm also not a huge fan of potato soup because of the way my mom used to make it. I made this for book club, however, and it turned out pretty good. Hearty, tasty. Will definitely make again.

I subbed the chicken bouillon for two small cans of vegetable broth. Also added two stalks of celery. Had no thyme, but liberally seasoned with oregano and basil because I like seasoning. Served with cheddar cheese, salad, and french bread. Awesome meal!

The roux to this recipe is amazing by its self. I had never made potato soup before, and this was so simple I couldn't resist. I cooked the potatoes for about 10 more minutes than recommended and they were still a little to hard for my family. I would say if your family likes a softer potato start the potato and carrot mixture before starting the roux process.

Simple, easy, very good. I had very large potatoes so I only used 4 of them. Was out of carrots, no problem. Wife cannot stand thyme, no problem. I added bacon and parsley for a garnish. No left overs.

This is a super simple and delicious soup to make. I made it with chicken stock rather than the water because it simply tastes better that way. I also happen to love potato skins so I don't peel them off. If you need a comforting soup this is the one for you. If you don't like the chunks of potato you can use a potato masher or an immersion blender to smooth it out for you.

The only thing I really did not like is having to dirty 2 different pots to make it, thus the reason for 4 stars. I also needed to add some salt in order to provide more flavor. Other than those items, it is a very good base that you can use as a starter for other soups like clam chowder, etc. Will make again!

This recipe is so good I add cheese and a little bit of either ham or bacon to it gives it way more flavor I would highly recommend this to a friend

This soup got rave reviews throughout the meal. My husband asked that it become a regular addition to our weekly menu. I did add some frozen peas to it and served it with Parker House Rolls. So yummy!

Turned out  good.  I used chicken broth to cook the potatoes instead of water.  I also followed the advice from some of the other reviews and only used 2 1/2 cups of milk instead of 3.  I wasn't too sure about the thyme so I only added 1/2 of what the recipe called for - and glad that I did.  the thyme gave it a very unique taste (it was good, but not sure I'm sold on it)  I will definitely make this again, but may play around with some different spices (instead of thyme) next time

Excellent soup! I didn't have bouillon powder, so I used chicken stock in place of 2/3 of the water. It turned out great.

I had to double the water because of the amount of potatoes and carrots. Three cups wasn't enough to cover, and cook them. Otherwise followed exactly. This was my 2nd time. The first time I ALWAYS follow recipe exactly. The times after I may experiment and add seasonings to my palate. I think it's VERY important to experience it as written the first go round. This is a very delicious soup!

This soup tastes similar to one they serve at Olive Garden. Very delicious, and super easy to make. Definitely a keeper in my books. You can add your own twist to it since it's a plain base. I added Italian herb spices instead of the parsley.

Loved it :).  I also used an emulsion blender to thicken it up a bit and that really did lovely things :).  I was confused about consistency in the step of adding milk to the butter+onion+flour paste... But it worked out

I've been making this soup for 13 years and it has become a favorite staple in my house. My friends and family will invite themselves over if they know I'm making this soup! I don't add anything to this recipe, it's perfect as is. That being said, potatoes come in different sizes so 6 medium potatoes can be quite different than 6 small or 6 large potatoes. I like a chunkier soup so I add diced potatoes until they are just above the water level in my pot. It doesn't take long for the potatoes to lose some of their water and then they will be completely submerged. Serve with green onions, crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese. YUM!!!!

Delicious soup!  I added celery, white pepper and a few more carrots.  I also used 3/1/2 cups of water and the veggie soup base.  I like the fact that it's not cheesy.

This is a good potato soup recipe.  I followed the directions as written.  Simple ingredients, simple preparation, great tasting--what's not to like?  If you have any left over, refrigerate overnight then reheat it the next day.  Excellent!

We were looking for a simple and nutritious potato soup to make for lunch. This seemed to be a pretty basic recipe! We actually used only 4 potatoes and only 1/2 of a yellow onion chopped up. I added 2 cloves of garlic, chopped to saute with the onions. I did add the three tablespoons of flour for thickening with the same amount of butter but did reduce the water and the milk to two cups respectively, since I used less potatoes. I also reduced the amount of chicken bullion to three heaping teaspoons. I also added 1 carrot and 1 sprig of celery with the leaves to the boiled vegetables. We did not have any bacon to use so I defrosted three medium sized chicken tenders to saute in 2 tablespoons of butter with garlic powder and salt and pepper as needed for seasoning. I added the chicken tenders with the buttery sauce to the soup as a final touch. It turned out so delicious. The best comfort food to go with grilled cheese sandwiches!!!

Great recipe.  Like several others, I didn't feel like getting two pots dirty to make one soup, so I simply sauteed the onion, carrots, (and I added some diced celery) in the butter first, then added the flour to make the roux, then added the potatoes and broth, and just cooked the potatoes in the base.  It came out great!  I used 1% milk to try to cut the calories a little bit...still came out nice and creamy.  Everyone loved it.

Delicious! I actually left out the parsley and thyme. Used chicken broth instead of water and  melted in at the last a handful of grated provolone and half a handful grated fresh parmesan. Made it VERY Yummy!

I love this recipe! I always use it as my base and then make a few adjustments by leaving out the carrots and adding some cheese into it at the end to kind of thicken it up and make it cheesy potato soup! My favorite.

I used soy milk instead of cows milk because my mother prefers it. The soy milk creates a sweet taste though, so I don't really recommend it unless you know how to cover it up.

I used the slow cooker for the potatoes and broth until the potatoes were done.  I didn't have any parsley so, I used cilantro and added frozen corn at the very end (they cooled down the soup just enough so I could have some right away---I have no patience when the soup smells so good!)

This is really good! I have never made a recipe before where you use onions as part of making the "white sauce" (butter, flour, milk mixture). I like that technique. Although it is a great recipe, I may try either reducing or eliminating the chicken boullion next time. That way it will be closer to the potato soup my mom made when I was growing up. I think that recipe may have come from an old Betty Crocker cookbook. I added one stalk of celery to my soup, and sautéed it along with the onion. I added one carrot (the recipe calls for carrots) even though I have never made potato soup before using carrots. Great recipe! You won't be disappointed!

It's decent, but not packed with any flavor. Better be sure to have some additional spices to personalize it. I used garlic salt.

As other reviewers suggested, I combined ingredients to use only one pot. Also added some broccoli & cauliflower. This was delicious.

This was so good on a cold rainy night. I didn't have any carrots or dried parsley so I just made it without, topped with green onions, sour cream and bacon bits this soup was delicious!

This was the second time that I have made this recipe and it was a hit both times. I added 1/2 lb of turkey sausage this time & a bit more flour. Definitely a new family favorite!

Good base recipe, I added celery, kale, red pepper flakes and fresh garlic and used 4 chicken cubes and 4 cups of milk because it was just a tad thicker then I like. Topped w/ cheddar cheese. The thyme was a new change for me, its different but I like it :). I would use a little less onion next time and add bacon (didnt have any).

Amazing soup! Loved how it was simple yet amazingly delicious. It is also surprisingly hardy..filled both my boyfriend and I right up with one bowl. Added some corn and red pepper flakes for spice..which I thought made it even more spectacular

very good, basic recipe, flexible for personal tastes, adding seasonings and spices to taste won't be overpowering. i used golddust potatoes. also, i used cornstarch instead of flour. will adjust for a thicker broth in the future. 

i used the settings to adjust for 8 ppl b/c my family likes to eat, and it'll be good for leftovers.

This is what I call Potato Soup!  Added celery to the onion while cooking it.  I made a double batch and it turned out great.  Even better the next day.  I used other seasonings because just didn't have the thyme and parsley handy.  Let it cook for a good long time.  It was a big hit with the kids even!

This was delicious! I too made it one-pot by just whisking the flour in the milk at the end. My adjustments: I used Yukon gold potatoes unpeeled for added nutrition and firmer texture. Replaced a cup of the milk with some sour cream that I needed to use up. Used homemade chicken broth instead of water & bouillon and added salt to taste.

This turned out really well and was super easy to make. Perfect when you are craving a comfort soup. The only change I made was that I added a stalk of celery (diced, including leaves) and I didn't use the bouillon, just seasoned with salt, pepper and herbs.

I made this soup last night it was easy and delicious. I used purple potatoes as that was the only kind I had on hand.I used organic whole non homogenized milk so creamy.I will definitely make this a regular winter soup in my house.

I really loved this soup!!  I used powdered milk, since it was what I had on hand, and I followed the recommendation to cook the whole thing in one pot rather than using two.  I also pureed the soup, which gave me a more creamy texture.  It was definitely a keeper...I'll be using this recipe again!

Great soup!  I used vegetable broth and used evaporated milk for part of the milk.  I also put everything in the slow cooker on low after I sauteed the onions.  Other than that, I kept it the same and everyone loved it!  It was great warmed up the next day too.  Thanks!

I took the advice of others and doubled the thyme and used the immersion blender to smooth it out.  I used chicken broth instead of water and chicken bullion.  It was what I had available.  I put a dollop of sour cream on top of each bowl.  I did this to add a bit of extra flavour because I can't use any salt.  Tasted even better the next day.  Will be a regular on my dinner table

The only 'modification' I did was fresh parsley instead of dried, and I used chicken stock that I prepared myself, fresh off of two chickens that sat on the smoker for dinner a couple nights ago. This imparted a nice, smoky, bacon-like flavor to the stock (omg, you should have smelled the house when it was cooking down, lol)  Aside from that, followed the instructions to the T and I'm very pleased with this recipe.  Pleased enough that I know it would be just as good without the smoked chicken stock (but then I'd be apt to add bacon :D  )

This is an easy tasty recipe. I choose to add a healthy twist by adding bite size Broccoli tops in the last step.  Like most cooking, I had to alter the spices to taste, but will definatly be using this  recipe again.

this was wonderful. I put thinly sliced carrots and celery in with the potatoes with chicken broth instead of water and then put the onions and butter and milk into that after it thickened and veggies were cooked. also I put 1 tbs crumbled cooked bacon in with the onions. very good. It might be good with rivels too. put 1 egg into a cup of flour till crumbly and drop by tsps into hot boiling broth. I might do that next time.

Yum! Few changes: I used chicken stock instead of bouillon powder. I threw some cilantro in there instead of parsley. I also added chicken, because my husband hates it when I don't give him meat.

Very good once salt is added.  I didn't have chicken boullion, so I used 6 vegetable boullion cubes. Also, I used soy milk and still my son, a soy milk hater, loved it.  I first rated this a "4," but had to change it to a "5" when I realized we were disappointed when we ran out of soup!  Definitely will be in rotation all winter!

I love this recipe, super easy. The only thing I reccomend is increasing the water to 4 cups and decreasing the milk to 2. Also, instead of chicken buillon use vegetable stock. I also didn't bother with the thyme and parsley. This recipe is a guaranteed success.

This soup tasted great!  My whole family loved it...though we had to throw most of it away 'cause it turned out I had used a rotten onion.  *sigh*  What a waste...
