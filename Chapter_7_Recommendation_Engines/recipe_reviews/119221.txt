Since I had prepared mashed potatoes to go with this dish, I doubled the liquids for the gravy, and since it appeared the pork would be over cooked before the onions were tender, I removed the pork and set it aside while the onions and mushrooms finished cooking. Then I put the pork back into the gravy mixture to warm through. I though this was an awesome recipe. 
Next time, I will precook the onions and mushrooms in the pan used to brown the pork, add a little butter and/or olive oil (if needed) then add the gravy mixture and simmer it and I think that will be even better.

this was delicious, i did make a few small changes. i seasoned and  browned the pork in olive oil, then i removed the pork and added mushrooms and onions and deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine. then i added the pork and gravy mix back and let it simmer. i also used chicken broth insted of water, i served it over roasted parmesean potato wedges. the potatoes soaked up the great sauce

Sigh...family tradition for the New year went out the window yesterday when I forgot the sauerkraut for our pork roast.  Scanning, I came across this recipe which started a NEW tradition...what a delicious gravy it made.  I browned and roasted a pork roast for an hour and then put this gravy over it and baked it another 1/2 hour.  My son, who doesn't like Balsamic vinegar, LOVED this "meat dip".  Hubby, who doesn't like pork and 3 helpings of it because of this gravy.  Well done, Marilyn, well done!

Very simple to prepare. Only change I made was i browned the pork and then removed and added the onions and mushrooms for a few minutes. Then poured mixture over and finished in the oven. Will make again, thanks.

Yummy~ The pork came out tender which was very nice because it usually comes out very dry. i almost gave up on pork until i tried this recipe. The sauce was very good, but it seemed just a tad bit bland. I'll up the garlic by a lot next time, since more garlic is always good. I had these with egg noodles and it was very good. Also.. this serves a lot!! NOT 2, more like 6. (well, for me it did)

This was really good.  I was skeptical while it was cooking, because the red wine vinegar didn't smell very good.  After simmering for a while, it started to smell really good.  Do note, though, I thought the mixture looked too thick when I added it to the meat.  I added water.  Don't do that.  It will thin itself a bit.  I saved the leftover gravy to freeze.  I'll use it as a base for vegetable beef soup.

I thought this was quick and easy, and delicious.  I did make some changes.  I did not have a packet of gravy, so I used a jar of brown gravy.  also, my husband does not like mushrooms, so instead I added fresh broccoli florets.  It added nice color.  I also cubed the tenderloin, so it kind of turned out like a stir fry.  I will definately make this again.

I wanted a nice pork and gravy recipe to try instead of my usual creamy mushroom gravy.  But I found the balsamic vinegar taste totally overwhelmed all the other flavors in this sauce.  I only used half the recommended amount too, because I know how strong it can be. I guess maybe other people really like a strong vinegar flavor, but I found it to be just too much.  My husband agreed and said this pork was just OK.  If I made it again, I'd probably try the red wine vinegar instead, but I'm not sure I'm going to risk it a second time.  I'll probably keep looking.

I have made this 3 times now- it's hugely popular with everyone I have made it for.  I brown the meat, deglaze the pan and then cook the mushroom and onions for several minutes before adding meat and gravy mix back to the pan to cook everything together. Caution it is very easy to overcook the pork.

This was SO good!!!! Tasted so like beef stroganoff to my family- a favorite. Made it as a stew over rice. (simmered on the stovetop for over an hr before adding the veggies.) Very tender! We will make this again :-) maybe with mashed potatoes or the usual egg noodles.

This is so delicious.  I made mashed potatoes instead of the rice.  The sauce is a keeper and can
be used with other meats.  This is going to be my new pork tenderloin staple dinner.

Wow very good. I am not a big soy sauce fan so I was reluctant to try this but I am sure glad I did. The ingredients blended very well together. I just cut up the pork and the onions and grilled them together then I added the sauce and simmered. If anything I would say that it is a bit salty and probably would be a great counter if you wanted to add sweet element to it like pineapple maybe. I tried it just as the recipe stated omitting the mushrooms and it was hit. Thank you, I will make it again.

I thought the flavor was strange at first, but then it grew on me. I would just be careful to not overcook the pork. Served with rice, but would be delicious with mashed potatoes

We had this for dinner the other night and it was a big hit.  I had an already cooked pork tenderloin in the freezer  so just made the gravy and added the mushrooms, let it all simmer for about 30 minutes and WoW!!!I didn't know if we would like the gravy with vinegar in it but it was great.  What few leftovers went in hubby's lunch the next day. Great recipe.

My husband really enjoyed this. He did say he wanted more sauce next time though. The only things that I did differently were to brown my pork, remove it from the pan and then add a little white wine before sauteing the mushrooms and onions. Then I threw the pork back in along with the gravy. It was great over egg noodles.

The flavor that the combo of ingredients makes for the sauce is so great!!   Changes I made where no garlic (I don't like it) and chicken broth instead of water. I sauteed veggies first and I floured my pork to brown it first which made the sauce a bit too thick so I just added more chicken broth to get to the right consistency.  My husband hates pork but he'll eat this...a keeper! thanks!

Perfect as is. I used one teaspoon of pre-minced garlic in case anyone wants to go that route.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe closely, with a couple of minor changes, I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, added a splash of soy sauce, and about a 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  I browned the strip of tenderloin then added onion and stirred until the onion was caramelized then added the gravy sauce to the frying pan, and added thinly sliced carrots and chopped broccoli, the gravy thickened up nicely!  We had this over fetticini, it was delicious!  My 11 year old son loved this!  My picky 7 year old ate most of his, this will be added to my recipe box!  Very tasty, quick and easy!!

My husbands new favorite pork recipe. I did cook the onions and garlic first like others have suggested. But since we do not like fresh mushrooms I added Cream of Mushroom soup to help the flavor and thicken the gravy along with chicken broth instead of water. Love it!

This was great.  I followed the directions except I left the tenderloins whole and browned them with sautéed onions in an oven proof skillet, sticking the whole thing in at 350 for 40 minutes to finish them off.  It came out very tender and moist.  It is a very German taste.  Next time I will serve with red cabbage and potatoes, doubling the gravy with a little extra liquid.  Awesome!  Keep experimenting Marilyn! Thanks!

My family really liked this dish a lot! I doubled it to use up two tenderloins and cooked them with a hefty tsp or so of minced garlic. I used 3 packages of gravy so there would be plenty. This was perfect over rice. I'll definitely keep this quick and easy dish on file for future use. This reheated very well the next day too and was just as good if not better then. Thanks for sharing this Marilyn!

OMG! This was restaurant quality! Made enough for DH and I with just enough left for my lunch on Monday. Meat was tender, flavorful and could cut with a fork. Sauce was to die for (made no changes to it). I did cook onions and mushrooms first (canned mushrooms worked fine - used 2 4oz), then browned pork medallions. Cut way back on the oil, using just enough to get the job done. Put pork and veggies on a plate, then deglazed skillet with white wine, pouring those goodies into the sauce. Used a whip to mix the sauce super well. Spritzed skillet w olive oil cooking spray, put the meat and veggies in, then poured sauce over it all. Simmered for 17 min. The aroma had me drooling and anxious for dinner. Served with mashed potatoes (DH prefers) and side of corn. Presentation was beautiful and the meal was so delicious. Ate slowly to savor every bite. Thank you for sharing. This is now my favorite pork recipe!

Too salty to eat!  I would suggest the following: Omit the soy sauce, or only add a dash.  Replace the vinegar with a splash of red wine.  Probably still not even worth the effort though.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.  Family LOVED this.  I didnt change anything.  I did serve with a side of mashed potatoes.  My son already asked when I was going to make this again.  Very easy too!

Rich and delicious! Cooked 2 lbs. of tenderloin so I used 3X the brown gravy recipe, which was perfect since I served it w/mashed potatoes. Even my picky-eater son devoured it. Thumbs up, Marilyn! (BTW, cooked the meat whole, then sliced it after cooking.)

This was very tasty, and quick and easy as well.  Next time I'll cut the tenderloin into slightly thicker pieces; I think the meat will retain more moisture that way.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't have cider vinegar so I substituted it with 1 TBSP red wine and 1 TBSP rice vinegar. Turned out great!  Will make again

Enjoyed our meal the meat was perfect but the mushrooms and onions were a bit salty I would add them later in the cooking process.  My husband who grew up in a pork eating family really enjoyed this recipe, I who never really ate pork growing up,enjoyed it.  Always trying to make pork and falling, this was encouraging!
