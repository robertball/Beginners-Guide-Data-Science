This is a family favorite. We use Trader Joe’s fontina and Pecorino-Romano. Both melt beautifully. Use good quality, smoky bacon, and don’t skip the fresh chives. They add a wonderful flavor dimension and visual appeal.

I doubled the recipe for a large group & used 1 can evaporated milk+ 1/4 cup 1% milk along with the heavy cream. It worked great & helped cut the cost of the cream!

Fontina and bacon make a lovely couple! I had to use Barilla GF penne instead of elbows, but the taste is just as good I'm sure. The directions are right on, keeping the pan off the heat while stirring in the fontina is important so it doesn't glob-up on you. I topped with some sliced green onion for a bit of kick. Thank you for the recipe.
