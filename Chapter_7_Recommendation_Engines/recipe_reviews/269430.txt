It was great but next time I will go without the Italian seasoning it was overpowering.

I halved the recipe and I’m not sure if that was the issue or if it had to do with the actual recipe.   By halving it; it was a disappointing side- extremely dry and bland. I saw the original post was for a gluten free version so maybe that’s the issue.  Adding all the bread crumbs and crackers (used cheez-it’s) made this so dry.  I wasn’t going to top with cheese for the full bake but in keeping with  the recipe integrity I did.  I wish I didn’t.  The small amount of cheese burnt to a shell.  My final product didn’t look like the posted pic.  I’m giving it a 3 based on hopes that a GF version is the ticket.
