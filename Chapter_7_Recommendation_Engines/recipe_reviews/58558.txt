I'm only giving this 4 stars because it doesn't have garlic in it. With garlic it gets 5 stars. It needs at least 2 cloves just to get it going. I use more beause we're garlic people. Let it sit for at least an hour to let the flavors marry. I was afraid the sugar might be too much but it's just right.

This was right along the lines of what I was looking for. My wife does not like hot salsa. This worked perfect and knowing that the highest rating was 5 stars she still gave it ten stars. I did use garlic salt. For those that don't like spicy this is it.

I don't know why the description of this recipe says it's an alternative to Salsa. To me it tastes just like Salsa but without the kick of chili peppers. It's not bad but I only gave it 3 stars because it's really just another Salsa recipe.

Loved it! I can't stand garlic..... So I appreciate a recipe without it. I did add jalape√±os (very small amount). Thank you
