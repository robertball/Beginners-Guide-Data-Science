I have to echo all the other reviews, and say that this recipe is wonderful!  The sauce was runny when I first took it out of the oven, but it thickened while it cooled.  I used plain water instead of vegetable broth, and it was still delicious.  The only thing that would deter me from making this again would be the amount of prep time involved -- the best way I discovered to get around that is to multiply the amount of filling you prepare.  I make one pie immediately, then divide the rest into the right portion sizes and freeze them.  The filling freezes wonderfully, and it's so easy to defrost, put in a pie crust, and stick in the oven!

This recipe is delicious.  I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.  As a vegetarian who lives in a house full of meat eaters, this recipe was a definite winner with everyone.  In addition to what is listed, I added: shelled edamame, peas, garbanzo beans, broccoli, spinach, extra mushrooms (shitake and cremini), and 3 to 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also threw in some extra garlic and some Herbs of Provence for flavor.  I used a whole wheat pie crust just on top.  Thanks SO much!

Really good, but the next time I make it, I would make the following changes: 1) cook the pie crust a little first, then add veggies and cook again so that the crust is really done. 2) drain most of the broth after cooking veggies. I did skim some off but still put too much in the pie crust. It makes the crust soggy and the pie hard to cut.

I don't often write reviews, but this one deserved looking up my password to log on!  My picky 3 y/o asked for more!!  I did add 1-2 tbl spoons of cornstarch for a thicker sauce as recommended by other users.  It was refreshing to have a meal that was FRESH--I used carrots, potatoes, green beans, peas, celery, onion, garlic and broccoli.  I also used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts--delicious!  Not being vegetarian, I think it would be just as good with chicken or turkey added as well!  A keeper for sure!

A really tasty and filling recipe--we didn't miss having meat in it. I omitted the cauliflower and used about 1 TBS more cornstarch, because the sauce was not thick enough. You also need two 9" pie crusts (one for the bottom and one for the top). I used frozen, premade crusts, defrosted and rolled out. I also used a 8X8X2 glass pan.

Really good! I made this into 6 mini-pies (see picture) and did use more cornstarch (5 tablespoons). I don't like mushrooms so I substituted with frozen peas which turned out fantastic. I'll definitely make again and again. Perfect with the roasted garlic potatoes recipe and some cranberry sauce!

I was looking for some hearty comfort food on a cold autumn evening, and this pot pie was exactly what I was craving. The veggies I used were red skinned potatoes, parsnips, green beans, carrots, onions, portabellas and shiitakes.  Other than the veggies, the other change I made was I added a little thyme and ground sage to the filling, and a little extra cornstarch.  Make sure to bake the bottom of the pie crust for about 10-15 minutes  before you add the filling so the bottom of the pie won't get soggy.  This was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

I made individual pot-pies by pressing the crust into a big muffin cups tin.  The veggies had really good flavor (I added garlic and onion powder, and a little cilantro).

This was excellent!  I used pre-made pastry shells instead of making my own, (I don't do pastry) and the veggie filling made a little too much to fill one pie shell.  But it was really good and even my hubby liked it.  He usually hates pot pies.  It warms up the next day in microwave really nicely too and lasted me three nights.  Thanks for this one, it's a keeper.

I used frozen veggies to cut down on prep time (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, peas) and only had to cut garlic, onion & potatoes, so total prep time was like 15 minutes!  It was freakin delicious.  Definitely something we'll make regularly!

The taste of the pie was delicious, no complaints there!  The sauce was pretty thick when I made it, but when I put the pie together and cooked it the following day (after refrigerating it) it turned out extremely runny.  I actually had to drain the liquid from the pie and as a result the base turned out soggy.  I used cornflour, as I think this is the Aussie equivalent for cornstarch.  Maybe I should have used more.  But I want to try this again one day, I can imagine it will be worth it!

Great recipe, but I did change a few things.  I didn't use any mushrooms or green beans and added veggie chicken strips.  Instead of using 3 cups of broth, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup with a can and a 1/2 of broth.  I also used 3 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp each of soy sauce and worcestershire.  FYI, the thickness of the filling in the pot is how thick it will be in the pie.  It took 45 minutes to bake.  The pie turned out delicious and so satisfying!

UPDATE-  I made another pie since I have enough filling, but I waited a couple of days.  It was SO good.  The flavors had combined and it was even better than the first.  I would highly recommend letting the filling sit overnight.  This recipe is great!

Very good, but does need to be thicker.  More corn starch might do the trick.

Flavor was really good.  I added more corn starch(2 extra TBS) but it was still pretty runny.  no complaints from the eaters though, will make again.  PS - 1tsp seems like a lot of pepper and i think it really stands out in the flavor.  I am a pepper lover so no complaints from me but others might find it a bit much.

This was really great! It can get running if you subsitute flour as the thicken agent. All the same, it's versitile and quick yummy.

I was a bit nervous when I saw the sauce contained soy sauce - not a favorite of my family.  After looking at the reviews I addied some thyme, the extra corn starch and baked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes. sauce was soooo delicious.  This was a great hit with my family and the bottom crust remained perfect.  They are already asking me to make this again!

I took the advice of another review individual and used 4 Tbs of cornstarch. Made the consistency perfect. My husband is not a vegetarian but he said this had so much flavor that he didn't even miss the meat.

I used crescent roll dough instead of pie crust. Note that if you do this you have to reduce the time and/or temperature! After I peeled off the burnt crust, though, my kids loved it!

Really easy and filling for chilly autumn evening comfort food.  As a vegetarian it's difficult to find good "comfort food" recipes.  I omitted the celery and green beans, and used instead frozen bags of carrot/pea mix, and broccoli/cauliflower mix.  I also used Pilsbury ready-made pie crust and substituted potato starch for the corn starch.  It reminded me of the Swanson pot pies I grew up eating (only BETTER), and was great for leftovers.  Since my pie was smaller because I used the pie crusts, I used up the rest of the mix by having it over brown rice -- another really great meal!

This turned out soooo great! I loved the "gravy" sauce for the vegetables! It had lots of flavor, and the soy sauce gave it kind of a meaty taste. You'd never miss the meat in this!

This was very yummy and I definitely will be making it again!  My one caution -- the picture of this recipe shows a pie plate but the recipe calls for an 11x7 baking dish.  I had planned for a pie size, so I just added in a cup of frozen corn and a cup of frozen peas, and I had enough filling for 2 9" pies.  We froze one and will have it to use at a later date.  We are excited about that!

We really liked this recipe, just what we were looking for on the first snowy day of the winter.  I didn't have any vegetable broth, so I used some worcestershire sauce in addition to the soy sauce.  Also added thyme and northwoods seasoning (Penzy's).  Added peas too.  I was surprised by how much I liked the cauliflower in it.  It made a big batch of filling, so I just poured half in each of two casserole dishes.  Then I topped each one with a frozen pie crust.  Good easy winter dinner.  Update:  To take this into 5 star territory add a nice glug of red wine.  Also, here's my crust recipe:  Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp. salt in food processor.  Add 6 Tbsp. cold butter.  Process to fine crumbs.  Pour into bowl and stir in 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. ice water.  Shape into round and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

I'm sorry to say but I found this recipe to be disappointing. The sauce did not thicken, and I added extra corn starch. It was bland, and despite the fact that I cooked the vegetables longer than the recipe called for, the potato was underdone.

ATTENTION!! Before you make this be sure you take note that it takes (at least) 4 Tblsps cornstarch!!! (otherwise you get a tasty breaded veggie soup)!  Other than that---VERY tasty!!

this was soooo good, ive never tasted anything so delicious. I always loved chicken pot pie and when i became a vegetarian i thought i would never receive the same satisfaction with any "vegetarian" pot pie. Little did i know, this recipe would turn out to be my saviour, in fact i think it's better then most any chicken pot pie i've ever tasted.  It was DELICIOUS! thank you so much! by the way, i did add the extra cornstarch which defenitely helped! thanks again, this is awesome!

I am a diehard meat lover and honestly I wasn't excited about trying this recipe. Wow was I surprised. This was excellent if fact I couldn't stop nibbling on it, even when it was in the fridge. Each time I tasted it I was amazed how well it turned out and how flavorful it was...
This recipe is fantastic hot, warm or cold!!...  
I followed the recipe as is except I forgot the cauliflower at the store so subbed in broccoli which I had. I did up the cornstarch. The reviews varied from 3 - 5 TBSPS so I went with 4 TBSP. Wasn't runny at all. Oh, and, I cheated using a store bought crust. I wasn't expecting much like I said and didn't want to invest the time. Next time I will make the crust and will make smaller pies. This recipe makes tons. I made one pie and froze the leftover filling in smaller portions.

One final note: I am lactose intolerant and have been searching for a recipe to satisfy my craving for comfort food....I've found it.

I wasn't expecting much out of this but decided to try it since it had so many good reviews. Glad I did. This is pretty much perfect. I did change some stuff according to what I had. I used 1 1/2 cups of frozen sliced carrots, 1 cup of peas and 3 potatoes. I didn't use mushroom or green beans. I added an extra half cup of veggie broth. I also double the cornstarch in the mixture. I added some thyme.

I haven't had a pot-pie for at least 20 yrs (haven't eaten meat since then). Periodically, I check the Swanson Pot Pies at the grocery store, hoping they came up with a veggie pie (Amy's Vegan Pot Pies are too expensive for my liking), so I'm really excited to have found this great recipe that's just how I remember it, but much healthier and animal-friendly! I used "chicken" tvp. I'm sure precooked vegan "chicken" would be great too. And I'm sure that the recipe as is is just as great too.  But this was my 1st time making a pot pie with an attempt to make it just as much as how I remembered the meat-version, so that's the only reason I used the TVP.  This is a keeper. Thank you!

This recipe is great because of it's versatility.  I should have used what I had on hand (peas instead of green beans and broccoli instead of cauliflower). As other reviews said, it is soupy but if you let it cool after baking, a lot of it is absorbed and that extra broth is needed.  One thing that a novice like myself wont know is to bring it to a boil after adding the starch mixture to help it thicken.  Luckily my hubby directed me to do this.  I also used chicken broth just to get the real pot pie flavor.  My carnivore husband said it's the best pot pie he's ever tasted.  Great recipe!

I made my own Vegan variation on this-using pretty much the same ingredients, except added some corn, sweet potatoes and peas....I only used just over 2 cups of Veggie broth and simmered in high to get a fast sauce reduction. I used a premade flour pie shell and instead of using a crust on top, made a mashed potato crust with Vegan butter, Vegan cheese and rice milk...topped it off and voila. This recipe is an AMAZING and easy to prepare....and I love that the fat content is very low and the veggies on their own with just the broth and soy sauce concoction are incredible!! Thanks for sharing!!

4 stars because I changed some things. I have made this a bunch of times, including twice using puff pastry and the Veggie Pot Pie crust on this site. The puff pastry crust was a bit mushy, but good. The veggie pot pie crust was good, I think when I was rolling out the dough I used too much flour because I could taste it too much. I also misplaced my broth so I made my own version. I used dried onion, a small amount of chili flakes, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and it turned out great!!

Edit: I made this again with puff pastry dough and prebaked it for a couple minutes before transferring it to the top of my vegetables and cooking the whole thing together.

This was very delicious. The sauce is amazing, and it made so much!  I ended up with two large pot pies, not just one.  The taste is great!  I added a few spices, and omitted the cauliflower because I didn't have it on hand.  Amazing!  I highly recommend this!

I'm a classic creamy sauce pot pie kind of gal, and my boyfriend seems to lean that way too. This was good, but, for us, we missed the creaminess of the traditional pot pie. I don't think i'd make it again, but it was good to try.

This wasn't so great... it tasted more like a mix between a pot pie and an Asian veggie stirfry.  I had to use 4 tbsp of cornstarch, and it was still sort of runny.  I exchanged 1/2 cup peas for the mushrooms, and I used pre-made biscuits on top instead of using a pie crust, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My boyfriend thought it was good, but he didn't ask for seconds.  Eh, next time I'd rather just heat up a frozen Marie Calendars.

Changes I made, for my own future reference.  1/4 t. ground black pepper, 1/2 t. salt (1/4 t. next time?), beef broth, 4 T. corn starch (maybe even more next time, still runny), zucchini instead of green beans.

Totally delicious.

A good basic recipe, I will make it again. To reduce the fat content, I left out the bottom crust - and nobody missed it.

This is a delicious recipe as written and I rated it as such.  However!!!  If you are not the type of cook who just loves being in the kitchen and knows all the shortcuts or have the right food processor, you might not want to try this recipe.  I am not one to want to spend hours in the kitchen (cooking for only 2 people) and because of that, I will not make this again.  With all the cutting and dough making, it took me a whole lot longer than 30 minutes prep time.

I am no longer cooking meat so I was looking for a good pot pie recipe.  I rated this a 3 because it was good but not what I was expecting.  I love mushrooms but in this I wasn't a fan.  Wish I would have read reviews better because I would have followed others advice to add more cornstarch, way too runny.  Again, the recipe was good just not what I was looking for I guess.

My friend originally made this for me and sent me the link to the recipe because I liked it so much. So hard to find a good vegetarian pot pie recipe and this one hits the spot!  My only issues were getting the "gravy" part of the pie thick enough and also that I had way more vegetables than could fit in a single pie.  I too used frozen pie crust and frozen vegetables when possible to speed things up.  Great!

Delicious. While I was making it my mom complained about how little meat I was cooking, so I scooped out some veggies and replaced them with hamburger crumbles. Then I used beef broth instead of veggie. She said it was up there in her top 5 favourite recipes. This makes a lot of veggies; I filled a quart freezer bag with extra filling even after making an additional mini 4" pie.

This recipe turned out great!  I halved the recipe, and added an extra tbsp. of cornstarch. Since I didn't have the ready-made pie crust and I didn't feel like making one, I just mixed together one cup of bisquick, a half cup of milk, and one egg, poured it over the top of everything, and baked for 30 minutes.  Since the recipe was halved, I was able to perfectly fit everything into a 9 inch square pan, which I lined with Reynold's non-stick foil. Lastly, I used about 5 cloves of garlic and since I didn't have any fresh beans, I just used canned, everything else was fresh. Yum!

We've made this recipe for years.  I can't seem to get back into my All Recipes account, but I signed up again to find this recipe just to save it here. Thank goodness I saved it in my files because the poor old recipe is getting pretty tattered. The recipe is wonderful and actually makes two pies for us.  We always freeze them, unbaked, and when the kids come they ask for it.  We make a big salad to serve with it.  This is a wonderful recipe for any vegetarian or foodie type.  It's warm and satisfying and just plain yummy.  Thank you for a wonderful go to veggie/non veggie recipe. P.S we use ready made pie crust like Pillsbury, just to make it easier.

After reading all of the positive reviews of this recipe, I was pretty disappointed in the final product. I followed the recipe exactly (as I usually do the first time I try a new recipe), but my fiance and I both thought that it was missing *something*. It is a good way to get lots of veggies in one meal but a lot of prep work (chopping) for a dish that is just okay. I don't know that I will take the time to tweak this to make it better...will probably just try a different recipe next time.

Excellent, simple, hearty, delicious, healthy pot pie for vegetarians and omnivores alike. This was the first pot pie I ever attempted and it turned out wonderfully! I made minor modifications based on comments:

1. I prebaked the crust for a few minutes at 350, brushing butter on bottom crust and eggwash on top (later)

2. I used 2.5 cups of broth instead of 3.

3. I omitted cauliflower and added more of the other veggies

4. I used 2.5 tbs cornstarch instead of 3

Love it! Thank you! It was a big hit.

Great pie.  I'm not a fan of cauliflower mixed with other vegetables, as I think it is overpowering sometimes so I cut it out of the recipe.

I think I might cut down the veg broth to 2 cups instead of using an extra 2 TBS of corn starch to thicken this up.  I had way too much liquid at the bottom of my dish.  I pre-baked the "pastry for double-crust pie" recipe for 10 mins (punch holes in bottom).  I used an 8x8" pan and eyeballed how much to fill it with.  I had about a cup of filling left out.  Next time I'll use 2 small potatoes or 1 large.  I loved the cauliflower and wouldn't leave that out.   Bottom line is that we loved the taste and it's worth tweaking.

As is, it was good not great. There just seemed to be something missing maybe a certain herb or seasoning but it definitely seemed to lack something. As far as thickening goes, well I believe next time I will use 3 tablespoons of cornstarch or simply boil it longer until it's very, very thick. How it looked going in the pie is how it looked when it came out. A bit on the watery side. Eventually it set a bit but that is when it was cool. I don't personally want to eat a cold pot pie.

great dish. I added sweet potato instead, added edamame instead of carrots, bell pepper instead of celery, only because thats what I had on hand. Great versatile recipe, I think you can add to your liking. took advice of other reviewers, added 3 extra TBLS of cornstarch. i also added an extra TBLS of soy sauce, and omitted the water, just mixed soy sauce and cornstarch and the end result was a perfect consistency. also used chx cubes instead of veg broth, and salted to taste. will make again. used the pie crust for this recipe and turned out great. I did cook the crust for about 10 minutes before filling it and it wasn't soggy at all. very hearty meal without meat.

I was pleasantly surprised that the soy flavor was not too overpowering. Maybe I would try a different flavoring next time, but the pie was still very good. didn't use the green beans, and used broccoli instead of cauliflower. I had about 1 and 1/2 cups of extra veggie filling left over. (used a 9" deep dish pie pan which holds the same amount as a 11x7 or 8x8 pan.) Spooned veggies into dough-filled pie pan, trying not to add liquid to the pie, but some liquid still came out of the pie and dripped into my oven while baking. So I recommend putting foil under your pie to catch drips. I also prebaked the shell for about 5 min, as others suggested. I used betty crocker pie crust recipe which is almost the same as the crust for veggie pot pie recipe here on allrecipes. Overall, I was pretty happy with how it turned out, thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good although it was a little bland, the only alteration I made was to omit the mushrooms (we don't like them). We did like it enough to try it again sometime but with a few changes maybe some hot sauce in the "gravy" or something to spice it up. Also, I used Pie Crust IV from this site I did not pre-bake it and it turned out great. The bottom crust was not at all soggy and the top was flaky and awesome.

Excellent pot pie, took it to a potluck and it got rave reviews.  I omitted the cauliflower and mushrooms just because I didn't have any.  Also substituted swiss chard stems for the cauliflower and arrow root for the cornstach.  Perfect consistency I thought. Mmmmmmmmm!

Sorry for the poor review, but this tasted like stir-fry, even after much doctoring. Ultimately, I tossed the pie crust and mixed in some rice. A yummy stir fry, not a pot pie. Thanks for the recipe.

Great meatless meal.  I am not a vegetarian but do like to cook meatless dishes regularly.  WARNING to vegetarians-- some of the Pilsbury pie crusts have LARD in them! And, Hostess goodies have beef fat in them.

This was absolutely delish!  My husband didn't even miss the meat!  I actually doubled the recipe so I could freeze one batch for later.  We just at the second one, and it was just as good, if not better than the first one.  The only change that I made was I used Bisquick baking mix for the top "crust" the first time and a can of Pillsbury crescent rolls the second time, only because I forgot to buy the pie crusts.  Either way is a great option.

I found this to be way too watery, even though I doubled the amount of cornstarch. It tasted okay but wasn't fantastic. Also I would have liked it to be nice and creamy... ah. I used rice milk w/ a bullion cube but it still wasn't creamy.

This is excellent.  Also, if you don't waste a lot of time chopping the vegetables into small pieces, it is not very much work at all.  I cut the mushrooms in half and made the veggies large.  Didn't have cauliflower; I used frozen green beans, peas, and corn (which also cuts down on chopping!).  If you use broth with sodium you definitely don't need to add salt (there is lots in soy sauce and broth normally).  I doused it with pepper, used heaping tablespoons of cornstarch, and it was just wonderful.  Thanks!

This was delicious!  I added one extra tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up and put it in a deeper baking pan.  It is a great way to use up left over vegetable.

This recipe was wonderful! I substituted peas for the celery and it came out great.  It does make a lot of filling, so a 13 x 9 pan might work better.

It's very easy to make this. What I did was chop all of the veggies before hand and then put everything together. It took about 15 minutes. Kids loved it! Traded off Mushrooms with Tofu and Culiflower with Broccoli. May need 1 more tsp of cornstarch to firm it up.

It was fabulous.  I doubled recipe, switched cauliflower for broccoli, and put only 1 serving of broccoli and green beans in.  I still couldn't fit it all in the 2 pies.  It was overflowing and delicious.  I think in the future, I will not use 2 crusts, but just one on the bottom.  It really doesn't need 2, and 1 will make it even healthier.  Yum!  Way to go, PATTECAKE!

I only made it for my son's school lunch cos he cant take too much meat. And since he loves cream, I changed the recipe a bit. I used cream of potato condensed soup and added 1/2 cup milk. Took out mushroom, celery green beans and cauliflower and replaced with asparagus and peas. Also added sweet potatoes in addition to normal potatoes. Cut down the sizing too - ie. 1 carrot instead of 2, etc. Added thyme. Took out soy sauce and corn starch since cream of potaotes is starchy enough. Yummy for him and whole family. :)

Great recipe!  I altered a few things to suit what I had on hand.  Deleted mushrooms, and added 1 cup peas and 1 cup corn, and swapped 1 of the potatoes for 1 small sweet potato.  I also upped the corn starch to 1/4 cup after reading other reviewers.  I used a recipe for a spelt flour pie crust to up the protein content of the dish a bit. Really delicious and hearty!  A perfect supper for a cold winter evening.


This one is a real keeper.  I like it because this is a good one for using up that little bit of this or that veggie left in the fridge toward the end of the week, too.  We will be making this often this winter, I am sure.


There's kind of a trick to getting cornstarch to thicken sauces.  As a rule of thumb, use 1 Tbsp cornstarch per 1 cup of liquid to be thickened.  Make your slurry of equal amounts cornstarch and water ( I just added the soy sauce right into the veggie mixture)  Make sure the veggie broth mixture is actively boiling when you stir in the slurry, and keep it boiling for the full 3 minutes after, which thickens the sauce and cooks out any starchy taste.


Thanks for a great recipe Pattecake!  This one is totally going into my "YUM!" file!

This is soooooooo good, I could eat the whole thing at once.  I did follow the suggestions of others' in adding more cornstarch, 5 tbsps.  It worked perfectly, no soggy crust.  I used a regular pie plate, which ended up giving me two portions of the filling.  I will make this many, many more times.  It is a favourite already.

Simple and tasty. The filling also freezes well. I did not have any issues with too much liquid and a soft bottom crust. Other reviewers gave excellent pie crust recipes.

Good starting point, lends itself well to customize as you wish. Add a bunch of your favorite veggies. I would recommend going heavy handed with fresh herbs and spices, including the salt and pepper. Thicken with cornstarch until desired consistency is achieved. Made into individual pies using puff pastry. Will definitely make again!

It was delicious, but it calls for way too much pepper! 

I cut the recipe in half, and I also made a few changes: 2 tbsp of margarine, 1/4 cup of onion, 1/4 cup peas, 1/4 cup corn, 3/8 tsp pepper, pinch oregano, and sprinkled garlic powder at the end of the cooking process (on the stove top). I used water instead of vegetable stock, because I didn't have it on hand, so I thickened it with a roux (1/4 cup of butter & 1/4 cup of flour).

Thank you for this recipe, and I will be making this again!

I did not like this at all! Too much cauliflower. I am NOT a picky eater & usually LOVE all vegetables. However, I had to smother this in cheese & add turkey to try and mask the flavor.

This was delicious! The broth was a little runny so I need to add more cornstarch next time. The flavor was amazing. I love this recipe because it's open for adding any kind of vegetables that you have around.

This recipe was awesome. Our family loves meat so I added some bacon bits and it was perfect. This also works with cornbread topping instead of inside a pie. AWESOME, THANKS!

Great pot pie!  I made a few changes based on comments.  I used 2 1/2 cups of broth and I baked the bottom pie crust for a few minutes before adding the filling.  It was perfect.  Will use again!

I think the success of this dish largely depends on the type of crust used. I used the recommended crust but it wasn't nearly enough to line the bottom, sides, and top of the filling. This dish is minorly labor intensive/takes a good amount of time to make, and for the time put into it and all the ingredients used, I don't think it's THAT fantastic.

Absolutely positively delicious!  I didn't think pot pie could taste so delicious.  I used the little Trader Joe's concentrated broth packets for the broth.  I also added couple handfuls of dried mixed mushrooms chopped into small pieces (instead of fresh) and used the soaking water for the water component of the broth.  I also used my favorite pie crust, the No Roll Pie Crust II recipe from this site as my crusts, I whipped two up in under 5 minutes and didn't have to roll anything.  Other than all that chopping this is a super simple recipe.  Absolutely rich and flavorful and every bit as savory as a meat dish and super filling.  I love it and will definitely be making it again soon.

If I make this again I will leave out the soy and try to make it creamier. I'm sure it is just my personal taste, but I didn't like the taste of the "sauce".

Absolutely delicious and easy to make!  I change out the veggies and sometimes use chicken broth and add chicken.  It's always great!  Don't leave out the cauliflower!  Besides being healthy, it is particularly yummy in this recipe.

Very good.  A little salty though with the soy sauce and store-bought broth.  Next time I won't add the extra salt.

Delicious!! Now, I only gave 4 stars because it did not taste like a real pot-pie.  It tasted more like a veggie stew in a pie. Still VEERRY delicious though! Will definitely make again!

I didn't expect this to be as good as it was! With soy sauce too!? Our family of all ages loved it. The main tip I have is to DRAIN off the vegetable liquid, maybe at least a cup (can reserve it until you are sure), THEN add the soy sauce/cornstarch mixture. You can always add the liquid back if it is too thick-- I will do this next time. This time I generously doubled the cornstarch, but I still transferred the vegetables to the crust with a slotted spoon; this worked but I left some of the liquid in the pot and my pie STILL bubbled over in the oven (hate when this happens...!)  A bit time-consuming, but a keeper.

Wow that's good!  Increased the corn starch to 4 tbsp as per other reviewer's suggestions and sprinled in some poultry seasoning with the vegetible broth.  Made 2 pie pan sized pot pies.  Best veggie pot pie I'e ever tried.  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish came out very good. I had all of these veggies in the fridge that had to be used. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable both and added edamame for protein.  For the pie crust, I made a Brazilian recipe, which is used for chicken pot pie in South of Brazil, add the following ingredients to the blender: 1 egg, 1 egg white, 1/3 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup of milk and flour (around 6 Tbsp, I don't usually measure the flour, I just add a few Tbsp until is nice and not too firm, is supposed to be like a thick smoothie). Poured some of the crust on the bottom of a baking pan, then the veggie mixture and the rest of the crust. Baked at 385 for 45 minutes.

LOVED THIS!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did do what others recommended and added 2 tblsp. of cornstarch and subtracted one cup of vegetable broth.  It was delicious, and it made enough filling for me to freeze filling for a second pie (I used a regular pie plate for the one I made).  I even got a VERY pick 15 month old to eat it, and he hates pretty much everything that is inside of it.  He gobbled it up!  We will definitely have this again!

This was very good.  It definitely needs the extra cornstarch.  Even with an additional tablespoon I thought it was runny.  I didn't factor that in my rating, however, because my kids distracted me when i was adding the broth and I may have added a little more than necessary.  I also added dried rosemary and thyme to the sauce.  I used only a top 1/2 wheat flour crust to make it slightly more healthy.  I will definitely make this again this winter.

Delicious, I didn't even miss the meat!  Instead of making it in a baking dish, I used 1 frozen pie shell and 1 refrigerated pie dough.  I also added a Tbls of worcestershire sauce.  This was very flavorful and easy to make.  I think the next time I will add frozen peas.  A definite keeper!

MY FAMILY LOVED IT!!!!WILL MAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!  ANYONE THINKING ABOUT IT, YOU MUST TRY IT!!!!!

Very tasty.  Not hard to make but a little time consuming due to all the chopping.  DH, who is not a huge veggie fan, really liked it.  I used half a package of frozen green beans instead of fresh and placed 1 TBSP. butter beneath the crust, chopped up, before baking.  Have made this recipie twice and will certainly make it again.

This recipe is wonderful!  You do have to watch the cornstarch and add as needed (I added about 2-3 tbsp. more) and I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy because of my personal preference.  Tastes wonderful!

I was a bit surprised to see soy sauce in the ingredients. But it turned out very good. I didn't add salt, knowing I'd have enough with the veg. stock and soy sauce. I divided the quantities by 2 and used a 9 inch pie pan. It was very good. I added a bit more starch tho.

This was so yummy on a cold November evening.  The sauce cooks up nice and thick..thanks to the advice of previous reviewers, I added another TBS of cornstarch.  I don't think the soy sauce made it taste like stir fry at all.  It gave it a deep, rich flavor.  I used a 9x13 pan and put Pam's crust on just the top.  It came out perfect!  We will definitely have this one again!

This was my first attempt at making a pot pie, and this was wonderful!  I omitted the onions due to my taste and sadly took out the mushrooms (due to my husbands taste) but added extra beans and potatoes. This turned out so great, my picky husband said it was like his grandma used to make - and that's a compliment. I would defintely recommend this recipe! Also used 1/8 tsp. garlic powder instead of 1 clove, which was fine. This took me two 1/2 hours to make, but I never rush when I cook...this was a relaxing meal to make! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe base - I omitted the mushrooms and substituted broccoli for the cauliflower. Next time I will add the broccoli after the green beans as it took decidedy less time to cook. The sauce was a bit too salty for my taste, but I will definitely keep experimenting with it- there is a great recipe somewhere in here!

This recipe is pretty bad from start to finish.  I am not sure if I am more angry at the recipe's author or the 5 star reviews which, on further inspection,  say, " great recipe! I just changed every ingredient, added 25 things, cooked it differently, and my husband loved it!" Do not be fooled by the stars like I was, this recipe is trash. 

Why on earth would you start with the fasting cooking veggies and then move to the slow cooked ones? 

The only recipe that calls for one clove of garlic is the recipe to cook one clove of garlic. 

Other than the garlic there are no spices! Wtf?!

It comes out runny like everyone else said.  Needs more corn starch.  

It is way too much to fit in a store bought pie crust, so you'll have a lot of filling left.

Find another recipe.  This one is bunk!

If one needs to major changes, then it should not have a "major" rating.  It needs  herbs like sage, thyme,  rosemary, bay leaf and marjoram.   It also needs nutritional yeast to make it taste cheesy.  I like to use soy sauce instead of  salt.

This was amazingly good. I added 2 dashes of nutmeg, thyme, and cheyenne. For some reason mine didn't turn out liquidy like some people are saying. I used all the same veggies only used just a tad more of everything so more water might have gotten soaked up and i added about a cup or more of frozen peas. I also cooked the bottom crust at 400 for about 10 minutes and popped the bubbles every 5 minutes. After filling it i put the top crust on and cooked it at 400 for 20-30minutes  i let it sit until it thickened more. This is my new favorite recipe

I have to say first of all that I have never tasted this pie exactly as the recipe is made, but I love it! I didn't have any issue with the thickness of the sauce, and after a disaster with store bought puff pastry the first time I tried to make this, I tried to make the recommended pie crust and had a much better time with that. 
I didn't use mushrooms, cauliflower, or green beans. Instead I added parsnips (3) and a small amount of sweet potato. 
I also added sage to the seasoning, and changed the veggie broth to 2 cups broth and 1 cup white wine. 
I followed the pie crust exactly and then pre-cooked it for about 10 minutes as the first time the pie was soggy. 
Overall this is a great recipe that is easy to play around with...and best of all my meat loving boyfriend says it has flavour!

I LOVED THIS!  Talk about comfort food!  This was amazing!  I made a couple changes...I used 4 cups of vegetable broth - I ised better than boullion vegetable broth - it's well worth it! I also used frozen mixed veg instead of green beans because I didn't have any.  I also used flour not cornstarch and I added some freeze dried basil and thyme.  This was amazing as a "pie" but I had tons of filling left so am eating it as a stew.  YUM!  Oh! I also used tender flake pie shells for less fuss!  THANK YOU FOR THIS AWESOME RECIPE!

May have cooked things a bit more than suggested...but  otherwise pretty much made it as directed.  I did bake the bottom crust about 12 minutes before adding the veggies.  I have made this dish twice now and definitely will make again.

So delicious! (And I don't even like pot pie!!) wish it had been more of a gravy consistency than soup, but I'll try a little more cornstarch next time!

I omit the black pepper and the mushrooms due to our family's preferences, but otherwise this is a wonderful recipe. It's a lot of work, so I don't make it very often, but when I do it's pure comfort food.

I made this into 6 individual sized pies, and they turned out wonderfully! It was just the right amount of filling for the 6 small pot pie pans, and I used the Crust for Veggie Pot pie recipe also on this site. I baked them in the oven until they were finished all the way, and then froze and individually vacuum sealed each pie. Since the hubby refuses to eat veggies, I'm the only one who will enjoy these, so I take out one at a time to defrost in the fridge and reheat in the oven. They are SO delicious, and such a perfect meal for a cool Autumn or Winter day.

I wouldn't classify this as an easy recipe, by any means. Mainly due to the labor of the crusts, and assembling all of the little pies. But they are so worth the effort to have the meal already put together, and just needing to be heated up. I doubled the recipe for crust, to have enough for both the bottom and top full crusts for the pies.

I am not sure how just assembling and then immediately freezing (without baking first) them would have turned out in comparison to what I did, but I would guess that you could just freeze the uncooked version to bake all the way later. It may take more time in the oven at that point, though, and by the time I put one of these little pies in the oven, I am not prepared to wait very long until I can eat it! 

 I did personalize the ingredients for my own tastes, and for what I had on hand, and put some "No-chicken" broth powder into making the crust, which I HIGHLY recommend, since it

I really wanted this to work! I followed the recipe exactly except added two tbs more corn starch as other reviewers suggested...and it was still WAY too runny! It was more like eating vegetable soup with crust :-(. Still tasty, but not at all what I was hoping for. Not sure what I did wrong, but will search for another recipe!

I love chicken pot pie, but don't eat much meat.  This is fantastic.  I put it in a casserole dish with "old fashioned flaky pie crust" from this site on the top only.  Next time I'll experiment with other veggies...I'm sure different combinations will be just as good!

I love this recipe!  I halved the recipes but used the same amount of cornstarch and used Pillsbury pre-made pie crusts in a pie dish.  I baked the bottom one first 10 minutes.  I used frozen cauliflower, beans and carrots, canned mushrooms and fresh ingredients otherwise. It was so so so good, the next day it was even better!!

This works well as written, and can serve as a starting point for variations, depending on available vegetables, the wish (or not) to add a mock-meat of some kind, the wish to make a more specific flavor by adding (e.g.) garam masala, paprika, chili powder, etc. On my first use, I filled the pie shell pretty full, and it took 40-45 minutes to reach pie-brown. I was very fond of pot pie in the days before I adopted a vegetarian diet; I’ve not often found a good vegetable pot-pie in a restaurant or in a grocery store. This one satisfies my craving. My wife commented that it brought back childhood memories (g); for me it was perhaps more starving-student-day memories. My terrier begged for seconds, so the lack of meat was obviously not an issue! I think it can be served to meat-eaters without apology.

Very happy with this recipe, easy to make, kids ate it, and the husband didn't complain about missing the meat.  Ended up with enough for two pot pies, so had dinner and saved the rest for a future dinner.

Wonderful! I added one extra Tbsp of corn starch to thicken, some extra garlic salt and soy sauce for flavor. The bottom of the pie crust was soggy, I would recommend the suggestion of another reviewer, to bake the crust for a bit before adding the filling. This made sufficient filling for two 9" pie crusts!

So delicious! I omitted the mushrooms and added 1 cup frozen peas and 1 cup frozen corn. I used fresh veggies for everything else-- and a frozen gluten free crust. Also followed previous recommendations and used a total of 5 tablespoons of cornstarch. So filling, fresh, and comforting--without any dead animals inside! Hooray! Highly recommend this recipe.

Loved this! Kids gobbled it up as well.  Didn't have cornstarch so just sprinkled ~ 1/4 C over veggie mixture.  Made enough filling for 2 pies IMO.  Next time will make and freeze one

I love this recipe! It always comes out perfectly and it's so simple to make! I usually put in 4 tbs cornstarch instead of 2, though, because it came out a bit runny the first time I made it.

Recipe for filling was AWESOME. I didn't need to add any extra corn starch for the sauce to thicken. I suppose it depends on how thick you like the sauce. Unfortunately, I used some old phyllo dough pastry I had in the freezer for the crust, and it ruined the whole thing. I WILL be making this again, but next time with a better crust!

This veggie pot pie is a great comfort food and is fairly easy to make.  It is true that the thickness of the veggie "sauce" is the same pre-baking as post-baking, so you can tweak the cornstarch and spices to your liking before pouring into the pie crust. Instead of soy sauce I used miso to add a salty savoriness without such a distinctive taste.  I also went crazy on the garlic and added thyme, sage, and oregano.  For the pie crust, I prefer the crust you'll find on the "No Skill Fruit Tart" recipe.  Easy, flavorful, and the perfect texture.  I had so much veggie mix left over from the first batch of pot pie that I bought crusts the next day and made another pie.  Had I have known, I would've made more dough (double) the night before.  Next time I will make two pies and freeze them-if they don't get eaten first!

This veggie pot pie recipe is delicious! I had never made one before and it turned out wonderfully.  My husband, who insists on meat in every meal, absolutely loved it and requested I make it again, which almost never happens!

BEWARE THE CRUST! I couldn't give it less than 4 stars because maybe it was my error--used store bought crust and it was raw! Left in in an additional 10 mins and was beautifully golden, but the bottom was a raw, soggy mess. Stay away from Trader Joe's crust. It also wasn't big enough for a 9" pie plate though that's what it said to use. 

However, the filling was delicious. I'm going to throw some beans in with the leftover filling and make some biscuits to crumble on top.

This was an excellent recipe! I didn't have cornstarch, so I just used regular flour. I also chopped up the mushrooms in a food processor for the family member who doesn't like large pieces of mushroom in her food. I didn't have cauliflower, but I did at the chopped up stems of some broccoli, which gave the dish a delicious flavour.

This was super yummy and had it for Christmas with cranberry sauce. I increased carrots, added corn, put in broccoli instead of cauliflower (just like it more), and it came out really good. Have to agree to put in more cornstarch to get it thick. About a tablespoon more.

This was great. I increased the cornstarch to 5 T and only used a pie crust on top. It held together just fine. I would decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp.

I don't think I've had pot pie this good since... well ever! I'm a vegetarian and all memories of pot pie were tarnished with memories of picking out chicken bits and meaty aftertastes. I made this for myself and my husband and he couldn't stop going back for more! He's not a vegetarian but he was definitely satisfied with the flavor. I did make the following changes though: I used a jiffy pie-crust recipe (which I brushed with some beaten egg when the filling was loaded), 1/2 of a chopped onion, 1/4 cup sliced button mushrooms, 2 russet potatoes, 1 and 1/2 carrots (sliced), 1 large parsnip (sliced), 1 cup broccoli florets, 1/2 cup vegetable broth, 3 tbs enriched white flour, 1 tbs soy sauce, and 2 tbs fresh, minced rosemary. Mostly these changes were due to what I had on hand and the comments about there being too much filling, but I loved the combination so much I think I'll stick with the veggie choices. Though prep-time was a bit time-consuming, the results are well worth the work :-D

I can't believe I'm the only one who mentioned this, but I think this recipe would be much better without the soy sauce.  My husband said it tasted like stir fry pot pie.  It wasn't a bad taste, just too weird for my taste.  Also, I doubled the cornstarch per other reviews.  The best thing about this was the crust which didn't come from this recipe specifically.  I will not make this again.

Terrific recipe; I've made this dish at least 6 times in the past 3 weeks. Here's my spin on an already fabulous meal: Dissolved half a vegetable bullion cube (in place of soy sauce) and 4 heaping spoonfuls of cornstarch with 4 tablespoons mushroom broth. Subbed in mushroom broth for veggie broth, omitted the sliced mushrooms, added fresh, chopped herbs (rosemary, sage, oragano, thyme) to the pot as well as to the top crust dough. To save time (and butter!) I used a pre-made vegan-friendly whole wheat pie crust. I also dusted the bottom with a bit of cornstarch in fear of a too-runny filling. So tasty, so satisfying, so making this a staple for the winter months!

A really good recipe all around. We did some tweaking, took out greenbeans and cauliflower and added peas, corn and diced tofu. I also used water instead of broth and added sage, rosemary and a few other seasonings instead. Needed an adtl Tbsp of cornstarch as well.

Excellent base recipe. I added more cornstarch like other reviewers. Try in individual ramekins, with just a top crust to reduce calories/fat and for presentation value. All three of my children love this! I used Knorr veg. bouillon for a little more flavor than broth and found I didn't need additional salt.  Yummy!

I have now made this potpie twice! The first time it was pure bliss! Last night when i made it i doubled the recipe and i had to leave out 2 cups of broth and the pies were still just a big pile of soup! Make sure when you double the recipe you leave out at least  cups of broth!

Pretty good filling, but still needs more in my opinion.  I added a can of chickpeas and next time I think I will add some corn kernels and maybe some broccoli.  Overall, pretty good though.

wow I was very surprised by this I normal don't like using vegetable broth in any recipe but this with the soy sauce it was the right amount of everything and the sauce tasted like beef broth.  I used cauliflower, broccoli, peas, potato, carrots and Celery.  and 4tbsp of cornstarch.  I ate so much of this pie last night I could hardly move.  and I had enough filling for 2 pies :-)  going to have another slice now. Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks for the basics! I substituted the frozen veggies I had on hand (ie. instead of 2 cups of cauliflower, I had 1 cup peas 1 cup corn). Since a lot of people mentioned that it could be runny, after I simmered the veggies, I used a slotted spoon to scoop them into the shell - so I just got the liquid that came with the scoops of veggies. Also, I used a regular pie plate instead of a rectangle pan. I think you could do it in little pie pans like the traditional frozen pot pies, too.

This was a wonderful recipe! I have been looking for a decent veggie pie recipe and this fits the bill. I made it as soon as I looked it up. I didn't follow exact recipe, but it gave me the base that I needed to start and I am quite pleased with what I am eating right now.

Everyone enjoyed the dish, but I felt like the gravy was lacking something - maybe more spices?  I loved the variety of vegetables, and may make this again but with a more traditional sauce.

We loved it!!!  I used a pre-made crust and I thickened it with flour and it came out great!  We will use this recipe again.  Thanks

Yum!  My husband loved it.  I used the veggies that I had on hand: carrots, garlic, onions, turnips, potatoes, corn, peas, edamame, brocccoli.  I also added "poultry seasoning" spice mix (despite the name, it's vegan).  I made a whole wheat crust for the top only.  I'll make this again for company!

I scaled this down to 2 servings and made 2 individual pies one to eat now and one to freeze. I remembered just in time that scaling doesn't change the amount in the directions so used 2tbsp of water in the cornflour and soy sauce mix. I also changed the cauliflower to broccoli, celery to leeks and used frozen green beans. My daughter really enjoyed this. Thanks.

excellent! Added a package of soy chicken and it was perfect! Let it sit for a day or two in the fridge and it becomes even thicker and the taste is enhanced. Highly recommend!

Very good! My whole family really liked it. The only problem was  I didnt realize until it was too late that my cornstarch had expired so my sauce didnt really thicken. However, it was still yummy!

Great recipe.  I went ahead and used double the cornstarch.  And, I replaced the cauliflower with crumbled hard tofu, added some thyme and cayenne pepper, and added some frozen green peas.  It turned out wonderfully! Thanks.

I thought this recipe was ok though a little bland. The only change i made was to use puff pastry as the crust. Overall a good base but needs some spices.

I've been looking for recipes with lots of vegetables, and obviously this has a lot.  I've made other recipes, and my husband said there were too many vegetables.  Not this time.  He ate all the leftovers.  To cut down on the fat I used nonstick spray instead of the oil, and only the top crust and it was really good.  It is better the day you make it, but even the leftovers were good.

A wonderful vegetarian pot-pie!  This is time consuming due to all the chopping of vegetables but worth it.  As other reviewers have done, I made it in a 13 x 9 inch casserole and omitted the bottom crust, but no other changes.  Lots of flavor!

This dish is WONDERFUL!  I added 1/2 cup of cooked lentils for protein and I used 3 tbsps of corn starch.  I used 9x13 pan and I omitted the bottom crust - a lot easier and we didn't miss it.  EVERYONE loved it!!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This came out really, really well.  I did use a little extra cornstarch and 1/2 t table salt instead of 1 t kosher salt.  I had to leave out the onion because I ran out unexpectedly, and used chicken stock, but it was still amazing.

This was pretty tasty, and very easy to make.

I ended up using 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and filling two 9" pie pans.

Personally, I like biscuits, and if I did this again, I would leave out the crust completely and use biscuits as a top.

This is the perfect recipe for a hardy vegetarian main course when you don't feel like tofu again.  My boyfriend is a strict vegetarian but is still a meat and tatoes kind a guy so this was great for his big appetite.  Also, for a beginning cook like me, it took a lot of prep time but was totally worth it.  I also found that using some extra cornstarch was helpful.

I thought this was a good basic recipe and my family liked it.  I cooked the mushrooms quite a bit with the garlic and then added the carrots and two tablespoons of nutritional yeast and cooked them more until the carrots started to carmelize.  I made it in a regular pot (not nonstick) so there was a quite a bit of that flavorful brown muck on the bottom of the pan. I added the rest of the veggies as described, in addition to some peas, before adding two cups of Imagine No-Chicken Broth and cooked as described.  I then added 1/2 tsp sage and 1/4 tsp thyme.  Instead of the third cup of broth I added 2 tbl arrowroot to a cup of Eden Rice & Soy  and stirred it in at the end.  I made this the day before, and the next night after work I poured it into a pan and topped it with a cobbler/biscuit topping and it was ready in 35 minutes.

It was good.  A little too salty for my taste but my husband and his friend liked it.  I didn't have all the veggies and swapped out some for others.  This recipe is great for cleaning out your veggie drawer.  I will make it again with less broth or less soy sauce to cut the salt.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used canned green beans and canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh stuff on hand.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  It came out fantastic!!  I used an 11x7 pan like it said to but it was filled to the brim...I would probably use a 13x9 next time.  I added about a tablespoon of flour to the cornstarch mixture because I like it extra thick. Great recipe!

I loved this pie - it's the first pie I've made including the crust and it turned out great. I halved the amount of vegetables and stock as I thought they would overflow my 9" pie pan.  However, I used the same amount of sauce and followed the suggestion of using more cornflour.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious, easy to make (although a little time consuming).  It was a little runny, because we ate it right away, but if you let this sit awhile it gets thicker.

Extremely good taste and rich blend of vegetables totally hid the absence of meat.  Almost like a beef stew taste.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Tastes great! Beware though, when I made it, there was enough filling for 3 pies. I ended up making two pies with no top crusts, as I only had 2 crusts. I will probably eat the rest of it over rice. Other than that, very easy to make!

Added some veggie ground round.  Was worried it would be too 'soupy' to cut and serve, so doubled the corn starch.  Might have been too much Corn Starch.  But it held together ok - ish.  Always hard to cut and serve a pot pie.  Found that cutting cold (2nd night) was easier, and then heated it in the microwave.  Still, individual pies would be better if you want to avoid the slop.

The flavor was wonderful but the sauce was way to runny!  Next time I will thicken it with flour instead (about 1/3 cup or even a little more).  I have made many chicken pot pies over the years and the helps the crust not get soggy like it does if you fallow the recipe.

Even though I wasn't so sure about the recipe, I trusted the reviews and made it anyway. It turned out to by really really good!
P.S. I used leek instead of celery and cauliflower.
Also the amount turned out to be enough for two pies, so I'll only be using half the quantities mentioned from the next time.

Great comfort food option!  I took the advice of the reviews and prebaked my bottom crust and not using all the liquid.  I used a regular pie pan so I have enough filling in the freezer now for a second pie.

Delicious flavours and perfect texture. I added triple the recommended amount of cornstarch and it was still a bit runny.

Vegetarian daughter loves.  I have to admit I shortcut this recipe in the interest of time.  I use Pillsbury ready crust and frozen cauliflower, carrots, green beans, corn (whatever veggies you prefer).  I just sautéed the fresh veggies first and mixed in partially thawed frozen veggies into the broth to heat through.  Make sure to cut your potatoes into small chunks so they cook well. A little extra corn starch is needed to make the filling less runny.  I was able to prep the filling the night before and then toss in the ready made crust the following night after work.   We freeze the leftovers in individual pieces for quick college girl meals.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was great! I used an easy homemade shortening pie crust for the bottom and top; it was light and flaky and complimented the filling well.  However I will agree that the filling was a bit runny, I served it kind of “deconstructed” - I’m not sure if you could double the cornstarch or something, I tried to add some more  in before I poured it into the pan but it got a little clumpy.  So flavor = awesome but if you’re trying to impress your guests with presentation I would either play with the consistency to thicken it up or maybe make individual servings in ramekins.  Will make again!

Delicous! The prep time is long, but well worth it. I agree with the review that suggested doubling the recipe and freezing half for a second pie later. I set my oven at 400 instead of 425, because it is a smaller oven. even after starting at a lower temp, my crust was browned after about 15 min. I suggest to keep watch over yours, because cooking times may vary. I will definitely make again.

For what it is, it was great. It just seemed a little unfulfilling? Like it can't live up to chicken or beef pop pies.

I made changes due to other reviews and what vegetables I had on hand... I came out great really... even using frozen Pillsbury ready made dough and frozen veggies!
Definitely had a LOT of filling left over to make more pies!

I doubled the amount of cornstarch as suggested by some reviewers.  Very tasty and the vegetables were tender but not mushy.  I'm considering trying some fried tofu cubes in it the next time that I make it.  I used Better than Bouillon vegetable base for the broth and the seasoning was just right.

So good. Used red potatoes and added fresh green beans and brussel sprouts and brushed the top with melted butter before baking. Also added the suggested extra tbsp cornstarch. It takes two of the ready-made crusts.  Today is the third time I have made it. Popular with everyone!

This was clearly a 5-star for me.  I added more cornstarch, used 2 pillsbury pie crusts on the bottom and pre cooked - then finished recipe with one crust on top (suggested by another reviewer). Didn't change anything else.

So fantastic! I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch after reading other reviews that it’s too runny. Also, I put the bottom crust in the oven for a few minutes before adding the filling and top crust so it wouldn’t be too soggy. I used a slotted spoon to fill the pie to omit extra liquid.

Amazing! I'm not a fan of soy sauce and tend to underseason everything. I was a bit wary if the recipe but followed it almost precisely. Added some spinach I needed to use up.

Result is one of the best things I've made. The soy sauce is there but plays very well with everything else. This is a superb recipe! Very easy.

Don't have time for pie crusts? Make this as a stew. But it's so much better with a flaky and buttery crust wow.

My son devoured this, even though it's vegetarian! I had two issues - the sauce didn't thicken and the bottom crust ended up soggy, maybe because the sauce was too watery. I am reading the reviews now that say to add extra corn starch, so next time I will try that. I will also bake the bottom crust for a little while before adding the veggies and putting the top crust on, to make sure it gets cooked. This is definitely something I will make again.

Recipe was great, will make again! I substituted for the cauliflower, and added peas.  After reading other reviews, i reduced the veg broth to 2.5 cups, rather than three, and used 4 tbs of cornstarch.  Was the perfect consistency in my opinion.  If i hadn't modified, it would have been way too runny. Also, i read a recipe on Food Network that said to use puff pastry, which i did, and it was awesome. Would recommend, nice and fluffy and crisp.

It's a great vegetable medley! I used 2 cans of campbells cream of mushroom instead of making a sauce (i sauteed the carrot, onion and celery, boiled potato, cauliflower and green beans) mixed it with the soup and no soggy bottom! I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar, used store bought pie crusts. It was great! 10/10 would bake again

This was delicious!  My family loved it and my nine year old twins had two servings.  They even asked if I'd pack it for their lunch tomorrow!  I did use 4 tbsp. of corn starch as others recommended.  Also subbed asparagus for green beans and sweet potatoes for white.  I will definitely make this again.

Savory and delicious.  I added one teaspoon of herbes de Provence, an herb mixture I love and use often, with the vegetables.  I made individual pies for a gathering, and topped each with puff pastry (cut into squares)  instead of using pie crust on the top and bottom.  This recipe made 6 5-inch individual pies.  Will definitely make again.  Perfect meal to enjoy heading into the fall/winter.

I have made this veggie pot pie several times now., and I think it is excellent.  I made it exactly as written the first time, and it came out perfectly. But the great thing about this recipe is that you can easily change up the veggies to use what you have on hand.  The seasonings are pretty much perfect as is, IMO, but I have also tried subbing worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce and adding thyme to give it more of a "fall" taste, and it was really, really good.  I always make my pies with an all-butter homemade crust, because that is what I like.  But you can easily use any kind of crust, even a store-bought, and this recipe will still taste great!

This is an excellent recipe!  I used store bought crust - I know how my crust turns out (eh) - and I would suggest buying an extra crust.  It took three rounds of frozen crust for me.  My fiance ate it all up!  He kept going back for more - and he's usually a finicky eater!

I was looking for a dairy free entree and found this Veggie Pot Pie  recipe. The only changes I made were to leave out the garlic and use four tablespoons of cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers who found the consistency too thin. Extending the cooking time for thickening  from 3 minutes to 6 or 7 and  cooling the pie for one half hour before eating, produced a very nice result. My husband and I loved the flavor and we will add it to our favorites list. I am planning to freeze half of the pie for the future.

Too thin/soupy and too peppery. This is spicy. I used finely ground pepper and I think I should've used very coarse pepper.

This was very good. I used what veggies I had on hand (red onion, garlic, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, yellow zucchini, and potatoes). I used 2 cups veggie broth and 3 Tbls. cornstarch and the sauce thickened up perfectly. If you plan to make a double pie crust don't bake the bottom first because you won't be able to seal and flute the top crust to the bottom.

I used (2) 9" round pie pans instead of a rectangular one and added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch based on the other reviews, and cut back the water a little bit. I also used 2 packages of refrigerated dough. It worked out great! Tastier the 2nd day than the first!

For a first try at a pot pie, this was really great! The vegetables were very tender. The oven I was using had an iffy temperature control and I burnt the crust a bit, but it was nice and crisp. I probably added too much salt/soy sauce. I also substituted in cream of mushroom soup instead of adding the mushrooms, water, and cornstarch.

Great recipe for 1st timers! Easy to follow! Had to work on a tight budget, but was craving it so bad!  Definitely used my intuition with the thickness and only added 1/2 tbsp of starch. Combined with this recipe!

 

By only using frozen spinach and a mixture of cheeses from what I had in my fridge. (Mexican blend, Parmesan, and Oaxaca)

The soy sauce was a great substitution for salt! 

I used Kroger crusts for convenience.

And the yield made 2 whole 9"pies!

I used the no-roll pie crust recipe from this site and I subbed the filling ingredients for a more traditional pie, and what I had on hand - peas & carrots.  I also added browned cubed (firm) tofu in place of potatoes.  Absolutely fabulous - the "gravy" was delicious - I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 5 tbsp cornstarch and it was not runny at all - it held its shape perfectly.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!!!

Great dish!  I've made it several times and have changed the veggies to suit my tastes.

Also GREAT if you skip the crust and have it as veggie stew over a biscuit (I add a little more broth and let it thicken a bit more).

great base recipe.  I should have added more cornstarch and let it sit as recommended by a review.  Smelled so good that I couldn't wait.  I will make this again.  I also added sweet potatoes.  Yummy.

I can't eat dairy, so this recipe is great. But since I do eat meat, I like to add fresh, diced chicken to mine and I use beef and/or chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.   This takes me a really long time to make (since there's a lot of chopping and homemade crust involved), but I make individual pot pies that I (and everyone else) love!  One more thing: I double the corn starch/soy concoction, which makes the pie a lot less runny.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for a family gathering yesterday, and was told by several relatives that I better bring it to every future gathering, because I won't be allowed in the door without it. My only comment would be to decrease the pepper to 1/2 tsp, or even 1/4, because it was a bit too peppery.

This was delicious!!  The only problem I had was that it was a little dry.  So I quickly made up more gravy and it was perfect!!!  Next time, I will definitely double the gravy part.

Awesome recipe. The instructions could have been slightly better written, but I'm just a bit of a stickler for that. I altered things a bit, using significantly more corn starch than in the recipe, and I put a half teaspoon of dried rosemary, oregano, and parsley. Next time I'm either making more dough (the recipe for that is awesome by the way) so that it covers a bit more fully, or more likely I'll make individual pies in either cupcake tins or ramekins. I can't imagine a better meal to bring to work on a cold rainy day. :)

Very good with lots of fresh veggies!  I cut fat and calories by not using a bottom crust (no need to worry about a soggy crust) and put on a top crust.  We're not vegetarians but I try to use meat no more than twice in a week.  Both my husband and dauther took seconds.  Do all the whopping and chopping first then this recipe goes together smoothly. I ran out of soy sauce so I used Worchestershire sauce instead - still came out great.

I made this last night for my vegetarian friend and I made it as a personal pot pie for her.  I didn't have mushrooms or cauliflower so I added some frozen corn and peas, fresh green beans, potatoes, celery, carrots and onions.  I also added fresh Thyme and Rosemary.  Very good!  I followed others' advice and baked the bottom crust for about 5 minutes.  I also added a bit more cornstarch and broth and didn't have issues with it being runny or soggy.  Great recipe!!

Have been looking for a good veggie pot pie recipe and this one is the best! I also subbed in some veggies that I had on hand and didn't dice all the vegetables to give the pie a little more character.   I also added 4 tbs of cornstarch, which worked great. I would have made 1.5x the crust recipe just so the crust would be a little more substantial.   Fantastic!!

This was a yummy fresh vegetable dinner, with the flexibility for a lot of different substitutions (like change of vegetables, addition of chicken, etc.). Like others, I would add more cornstarch. I added extra, but not enough.

I'm really impressed! I have never been a fan of pot pie, but decided to try this recipe anyway. I left out the mushrooms, added an extra carrot, added an extra potato, added an extra stalk of celery, omitted the cauliflower, and added a cup of both frozen corn and frozen peas. I used 2 1/2 cups of vegetable broth (made with Better than Bouillon) and increased the corn starch to 4 tablespoons. I used a 9 inch pie pan instead of an 11x8 dish and all but about a cup and a half fit in. (I used store-bought refrigerated crusts.) My three picky kids really loved it, as did I. I'll definitely throw this into my usual rotation!

This was delicious.  You can use most any vegetables that you like.  The only thing I changed was that I left out the mushrooms and used frozen peas instead of green beans (didn't have any).  I also added a little sweet red bell pepper.    I only used about 4-41/2 cups of vegetables, not counting the onion, and it was just right for an 8X8X2 inch baking dish.  I'll definitely make this again.

How can something so simple be so good? I added a slightly different group of veggies, based on what I had laying around. It turned out wonderful! Next time, I'll multiple my crust by 1 1/2, as it was a little hard to cover the pan. I used flour instead of cornstarch, starting with 2 Tbs. The sauce was a little thin for my taste, so I added another 1 Tbs and it turned out great.

Excellent recipe! I followed the other reviewers' advice and added a couple extra tablespoons of cornstarch and the sauce turned out perfect. I omitted the onions, green beans, and garlic and substituted it with broccoli and onion powder. You can very easily change the vegetables to suit your own tastes. Next time I make it I plan on using less black pepper as it was a tad too much. This recipe is vegan, but it's so rich you can't tell!

Great recipe.  Nice foundation and easy to make it your own, adding your own favorites.  I will say that, at the suggestion of others, we added more cornstarch to thicken the recipe.  I don't think that it was necessary in the least; however, I am actually a fan of a very creamy/juicy pot pie (which of course begs the question, "well, why did you add more cornstarch?! lol. I'm a big fan of reviewer suggestion, I guess).  I made a big stock pot, so that I can freeze it for easy future preparation. Another very good suggestion made by another reveiwer.  I'll simply add more vegetable stock or water for future creamier pot pies!   Definitely a keeper and for the meat eaters, chicken, turkey, beef, etc. would go wonderfully with this recipe, but you don't miss it at all.

I thought this was great, especially since I'm generally used to chicken in my pot pie.  I substituted a cup of frozen peas for the cauliflower and left out the celery.  I added about two extra tablespoons of cornstarch and tripled the amount of garlic.  I couldn't fit all the veggies in the pie crust, so I froze the extra for another time.  Very, very good!

Yummy!  I halved the recipe, put it in a frozen pie crust & covered it with phyllo dough brushed with olive oil.  I was impressed.  I didn't miss the creaminess of frozen pot pies at all.  Very flavorful.

It tastes pretty good, but the measurements are WAY off. I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with too little crust and WAY too many veggies for the pan. I'd say the quantity of veggies needs to be reduced by at least a third. Another clove of garlic probably wouldn't hurt, either.  I'll make it again, but not without some dramatic adjustments to quantity!

This was excellent! All six of my family members loved it...for the first time in a long time, there weren't any leftovers! I follwed the notes of a few other reviews and added an extra TBS of corn starch, which worked wonderfully. I will definitely make this again!

I used this as a basis for my pot pie. I used chicken broth since that's all I had and after all, the purpose of pot pie is to make one big meal out of lots of little things left over. I used a biscuit topping and this was a big hit! Thanks

I did everything as instructed and my pot pie filling is an ugly dark brown color and smells quite unappetizing.  I used Swanson Veg. Broth from the can, it was a reddish brown color when it came out.  After seeing the results, I would strongly advise others not to use this brand when making this recipe!  It's so disappointing, I'm sure this recipe makes a good pot pie.  I'm curious to know what brand of broth others users used in their recipes, all the photos have lovely light colored filling.  No matter what, I'm still giving it 4 stars since I'm sure it was the broth and not the recipe that was the mistake.

Who knew this was so easy?  Takes a bit of time, but 2 of us ate for 3 days on this.  I upped the cornstarch per other reviews to 3 tbls and it turned out great.

Fantastic as a hearty side dish or satisfying vegetarian main dish.  Like others, I thought the sauce was too runny, but this was easily fixed by almost doubling the cornstarch.  If you have time, make the crust using the Puff Pastry recipe submitted by "your mom".  Although time consuming, it's completely worthwhile because it's a simple recipe, it can be made ahead and refrigerated for days, and it just tastes amazing.  The two perfectly complement each other.

This was very good and fairly easy. I subbed broccoli and peas for cauliflower and green beans. I also added 2 tsp more cornstarch, because it wasn't quite thick enough. And I added a small amount of roasted green chiles, just for fun. It was pretty runny straight from the oven, but it thickened up overnight.

Wow!  This is ridiculously good!  Although, I will change it a little next time.  I thought the taste of the filling was delicious a little bit at a time, but in a full serving the salt and pepper were a little overwhelming for me.  I'll go a little light on both of those seasonings next time.  This time I did substitute a few veggies - I didn't have cauliflower or carrots, so I used broccoli and asparagus.  Yum.

I'm vegetarian and a pot-pie lover. Those things don't always mix so well. I mean Amy's frozen pot-pies are a pretty good stand-in, but some times ya gotta have the real thing fresh out of the oven. I tried this recipe two nights ago, followed the directions to a T, but there was enough to fill two pie tins! So, no biggie, I rolled with it and made two pies. Had one for dinner and froze the other. It's a good thing too because my boyfriend (non-veg, btw) liked it so much, he ate half of one, and took the other one to work for lunch. I can't wait to make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

We absolutely love this pot pie! I did reduce the broth to 2 cups and used 4-5 tbsp. cornstarch, which thickened the sauce almost immediately. Also, I didn't have fresh carrots, green beans, or cauliflower, so I used a 1 lb. bag of frozen mixed veggies instead. Next time, I will use the fresh veggies instead. It was soooo good! Thanks so much for a fantastic veggie pot pie recipe.

Very good! I had to make mine in a 9x13 dish as I had sooo much filling. Not sure if I did something wrong or not, but there was no way this would've fit in anything but that size. I used Pillsbury refrigerated crust and being that the dish size was so big, the crust was quite thin on top and didn't cook totally through in some spots. Still, this was a great recipe. Quite the comfort food for a rainy day or something like that!!

Yummy! I realized that I didn't have any white potatoes so I used sweet potatoes instead. I used an extra tablespoon of cornstarch as other expected.

This will make it into our families normal rotation!

This recipe came out fabulously.  I made two pies using frozen crusts, the amount of filling the recipe makes filled 2 pie crusts perfectly.  I'm looking forward to making it again and trying differnt combinations of vegetables.

I was afraid the sauce would have an Asian flavour as some reviewers mentioned so I made one pie with this sauce and another with a more traditional cream sauce.  I actually preferred this one.  The saltiness of the soy sauce gives it a meaty flavour.

Very good, and healthy.  This recipe can be easily adjusted to your tastes or what you have on hand.  Instead of cauliflower and green beans, I added a small can of peas and frozen chopped broccoli.  I also doubled the cornstarch.  Next time I will cut back on the black pepper.

Fabulous! I made this as a first course for a holiday meal, and used puff pastry for the crust. The next night, when I served leftovers, it was the only thing that every adult and child wanted!

I followed this recipe to a "T", except that I used biscuits on top instead of pie crust.  Ideally, I would've used puff pastry, but I couldn't find any at the store.  I love this recipe and will make it again and again!

I've made this many times, and it is definitely a family favorite.
I replace the celery and cauliflower with frozen mixed peas, carrots, and corn (personal preference). I also use frozen green beans.
So so yummy! When I ask my boyfriend what he wants for dinner, he almost always requests this!

My boyfriend can not get enough of this dish! My friends and family members, who are not vegetarians as we are, also love it and are suprised by how hearty this meatless dish can be. One of my winter favorites. Thanks!

I made this as a main course for Thanksgiving. I prepared the filling the day before and stuck it in the fridge. Made the crust and baked it as called for. It looked beautiful and tasted great. One guest described it as "your very favorite vegetable stew surrounded by heaven."

Everyone loved this pie, and I've made it three times since initially making it!  The first time I used fake chicken strips, but they came out soggy -- left them out afterwards, and it was so much better!  Shows me not to mess with a great recipe.

I love this potpie. Sometimes convincing my family that dishes without meat are great too is not so easy. I made this one night for my family and my husband LOVED it, and my kids liked it. I actually had to sneak the leftovers for lunch the next day before he got to them!! Highly reccomended, I did substitute beef broth for veggie broth only because thats what I had on hand. Will be making this again real soon.

Being a vegetarian, I wanted to be able to bring a main dish to the Thanksgiving table that everyone would enjoy. This was a hit! I made my own crust and put the pie in a bowl instead of a pan. The flavor was delicious and everything turned out great! Thanks for posting this recipe

I really liked the gravy type sauce that was mixed with the veggies.  I made an individual pot pie in a ramekin dish and used puff pastry on the top of the vegetables.  I also just used whatever veggies I had on hand, ie beans, corn, potato, carrot etc.  Very tasty.

The filling part tastes great so far! I used some frozen veggies, potatoes and beans, and I used Italian Mrs Dash, garlic powder, and I also used 50% roast garlic terryaki sauce with the soy sauce. I think that enhanced the flavor nicely. I added the cornstarch by eye slowly, so I can say I used more than what was called for, but not by how much.

This recipe is easy and tastes wonderful! For extra flavor I added some fresh herbs - oregano and thyme - to the vegetables. Chopping all those veggies is well worth the effort. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was the best!  I have been a vegetarian for the past 15 years & this was just like the pot pies i ate as a child, i made it for my extended family & they all loved it!  i doubled the cornstarch & am glad i did.  i added more garlic & used "un"chicken broth in place of the veggie broth.  i also used a pilsbury refrigerated pie crust.

This was so wonderful!  I used a pillsbury refrigerated double crust, subbed brocolli for cauliflower, and didn't use the mushrooms.  I halved the amount of veggies (to make sure it would all fit in my pie dish), but didn't change a thing with the base.  I also added an extra TBS of corn starch like other reviewers have advised.  The base is so yummy..it turned out perfect.  Even my picky 6 year old LOVED it!

I can't believe how well both this and the crust turned out. I changed a lot, only because I wanted to get it close to the chicken pot pie I remember (fewer veggies, added peas and tvp, as well as bay leaves in the broth while simmering). I followed the rest of the recipe as a base, and was amazed at the results. The crust was perfect in every way - flaky, tasted amazing, very easy to make. This is a keeper!
