I thought this was really good and I took it camping and got rave reviews.  My only suggestion would to make sure the cream cheese is softened all of the way and be sure to use an electric mixer to mix the topping...mine was a little chunky and it took away from the flavor.

I too like this version with grape jello the best and always end up with an empty dish.  The blueberries and pineapple are wonderful together, and the topping is delicious!  5 star all the way!

This is awesome.  I usually use either Berry Blue or Black Cherry Jello when making this.

This is an excellent recipe. I had tried the recipe before made with rasberry jello but when I tried to find that version I found this one instead. That is the only difference. I am suprised that this hasn't been tried by more people. I try alot of recipes found on this sight and this one is very very good. I like the rasberry version better than the grape but both are very good. I always serve as a dessert.

The store I shopped at didnt have blueberry pie filling so I used cherry jello and cherry pie filling.  This was excellent.  Barely any leftovers.  This was loved by adults and children.  A great versatile recipe that can't be beat.  The frosting is delicious!

I made this for Easter dinner, using little silicone bundt molds for individual servings.  It came out very pretty and got great reviews for taste.  I didn't use the cream cheese topping, just swirled Reddi-Whip in the center of the molds, which everyone thought was fine.

This is a great dish!! If I said I make it for my boys to enjoy I would be lying... I make it for ME to enjoy! Although, I do share with them too!
I have used different kinds of jello, some I have liked better than others, but it is always a great dish. I also finely crush pretzels and sprinkle on top. The sugar & sweet is Y-U-M-M-O! 
One thing to caution is this may not be good for a picnic or potluck if dish will be out for a period of time, only becuause jello will melt. If you have a ice cooler with room, no worries... otherwise consider this if dish will be out over an hour. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!! One of my very favorites!

I liked this recipe ok. I took it to a family function where I'm known for my desserts. Unfortunately it didn't go over too well, and most of it came home with me. Maybe the cherry would've been a better choice.

Very tasty. Tried both the blueberry version and the cherry version, and I prefer the cherry by far. Sweet but not overly so. A keeper.

I grew up eating this. My family has been making this recipe for over 40 years. We use raspberry jello instead. Now my kids love it too! Try adding some finely chopped pecans on top.

SO happy to find this recipe!  My aunt used to make this every time we came to visit and it was always something I looked forward to.  This is also good with black cherry jello and sprinkled with chopped walnuts!

Been making this for years.  Always a big hit.  But I always dot the top with fresh blueberries.  Tastes great, and looks spectacular, like blueberries in fresh-fallen snow.  In fact, that's what my niece calls it:  Blueberries in Snow.

The salad was gooey and was hard to get out of the bowl, besides that it was very sweet and had a "tang" to it.

This is wonderful. I will use about 1/2 cup less water next time so it will more jello-like. I think chopped pecans would be good in between the layers. YUM!

Terrific! I was looking for something easy and coo to "throw together"; this fit the bill. I used 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries and 1/2 cup water instead of the canned blueberries. I also sprinkled 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts on top, to add crunch. Wiull definitely make again!

I'm not a plain jello fan, but this was delicious.  The pie filling gives it a different texture and taste from plain old jello and the topping is great.  Also, very easy and quick to throw together.

My mother has made this recipe for years and has always made it with cherry gelatin, which is how I make it as well. Also... after putting the topping on, we put about 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped walnuts .. just sprinkle them right on! This salad is an Easter tradition for us. Not sure why, but it is!

My husband is a Jell-o freak and he loved, loved, loved this!  And it is incredibly easy to make!  Used all of the recommended ingredients, but it needs longer than the two hours recommended to set.  Awesome recipe!

I made this using black cherry Jell-O and without the cream cheese topping because my son is allergic.  My kids LOVED the fruit and Jell-O mix just by itself.  Big hit.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Good dish on a buffet table. Used grape jello (85 gram package is 3 oz)and blueberry pie filling, and skipped the pineapple because I didn't have any. I thought there was way too much topping - easily cut in 1/2, and actually probably only used 1/4 of the topping in a 9x13 pan. Its more of a salad with less topping, you really only need a thin layer of it to enhance the dish not drown it. On the flipside, it would make a nice dessert if all the topping is used, so it depends on how you want to present this dish. Overall, its yummy and I would eat it again, interested in trying the raspberry cherry option too. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I love this!  I remember it from family gatherings years ago.  I like to add toasted pecans to the top.  Also, I have used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Very light and refreshing!

I made this for a school breakfast carry-in after losing my 20-year-old recipe for the salad.  It was such a big hit I had people coming in to my classroom to get the recipe.  I ended up printing copies and placing them in the teacher's lounge so they would all leave me alone.

I have been looking for this recipe forever. I had it as a kid on holiday dinners but I added a layer of red jello after the creamcheese layer. Wait until the cream layer sets then slowly pour red jello and let it set

What a great recipe!  I've made it twice, using blackberry jello with blueberry pie filling.  My children and our guests have devoured it!  Thanks for a great ending to a meal!

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but for me, the cream cheese/sour cream topping did not set up and was real soupy. I think that next time I will either add a packet of Knox gelatin, or maybe even a 3 oz packet of grape jello to the topping.

I made this with raspberry jello b/c I couldn't find grape and added 1 cup of chopped pecans in the jello mixture.  It was a hit at our family Easter dinner!

Delicious.  Will probably half the amount of topping next time to try and reduce the guilt factor in this recipe - but no complaints from anyone.

I made this but I put a differant spin on it.  My family  do not care for jello to much. I mixed the jello and then whipped the cream cheese and sour cream,pineapple together then folded it into the jello before it set then fold the blue berry pie into it. Put in refridge and let it set. Make a ghram cracker layer on the bottom if you wish. Its like pretty ble color and taste like cream cheese.

I thought this was a good gelatin. It had good color, and looked good over all. The structure wasn't the best it needed more gelatin or something but it was ok.

(cole) this jello was very sweet and delicious and the topping was definitetly the icing on the cake.

(Levi) it was alright i didn't like the topping very much because there was to much sour cream. i love the pineapple.

Although this recipe sounded delicious, the end result is a little strange.  I did not care for combination of pineapples and blueberries.  And the taste of the grape gelatin overpowered everything else.  I wish I would have left out the sour cream in the topping. Eeewww!  Weird.  Very weird.  Will not make again.  Noone liked it.

We made this a few days ago for my daughter's grad supper. We made the cherry version with Cherry Jello and Cherry pie filling.  It was excellent. I will make this again. Simple and a hit. I left the pineapple out. I think the only addition I would add sometime sprinkle with coconut over topping.

I decided to make this because it was rated so high.  It was just to much between the fake grape flavor (which I knew before making) and the pineapple and the pie filling. The cream cheese portion of it was good, but that was all. I won't be making it again.

Our family always knew this salad as "the purple junk". We all loved it.  Unfortunatly, grandmother then died somewhat unexpectedly, without telling us all the true name.  I'm so glad to have found it here!

This was delicious.  I wanted a different salad for Christmas dinner.  We got so busy that I forgot the topping, but the salad was wonderful without it.  Next time, I will make the topping also!

Made this with cherry jello, cherry pie filling and pineapple and it was a hit at the potluck. It’s a good versatile recipe that can be changed up as needed. Thanks for submitting.
