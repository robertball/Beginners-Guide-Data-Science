First batch turned out flat as paper and unappealing. Since I had a bowlful of batter I tried again. For the second batch I cut baking time in half and did not grease the parchment paper. While the cookies are still flat, they actually taste decent and would be good with a bitter tea. Even so, I will not make them again.

The batter turned out nicely, and prep was easy, but cookie did not turn out right at all.

I used my shiniest cookie sheet, parchment paper sprayed with Pam and the cookies lifted right off.  No problem.  The only issue I encountered was my fault.  I used my usual scoop for the dough.  The cookies spread and are huge!  I have 16 instead of 24.  Next time I will use the tablespoon for a scoop that the author recommended.  They won’t last long at church tomorrow!

What sticks to greased parchment paper even after 20 minutes in the fridge?  This cookie.  The tase is great but I can’t bring the sheets to cookie swap so I am voting NO on this recipe.
