Good flavor and real easy.  I actually omitted the cocoa because I wanted a vanilla frosting and added a little extra vanilla extract.  Tip: don't overmix as it will begin to separate.  It was an very easy recipe.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?? A super frosting, all around terrific recipe! I have tried many recipes from this site but was never inspired enough (postive or negative) to post a comment.  However, this recipe rocks. I did have to tweak it based on what I had on hand -- I used stick margerine, and substituted nonfat dry milk for the cocoa, because I wanted a vanilla frosting (I substitute NFDM for 1/3 of the sugar in most of my baking recipes).  I think because I used margarine, which is more watery than butter, I only had to use about half the milk.  Anyway, the taste is absolutely yummy.  It's a great consistancy and eminently spreadable, even on a crumbly baked-with-applesauce-instead-of-oil cake.  Easy to make and apply, delicious, what more could you ask for?  This recipe isn't just a keeper, it's going to be laminated for a place in my recipe hall of fame!  Love it!!!!!!!

I made this with butter and 1/2 & 1/2.  I wanted a vanilla frosing so I left out the cocoa powder. It had a nice creamy texture and spread beautifully.  But the best part was how it tasted . . .  I will make it often

BEAUTIFUL frosting.  Rich and creamy, chocolatey, with a silky smooth texture and great mouthfeel. Makes you want to eat it with a spoon.  I upped the cocoa powder just a little as I wanted a darker frosting, but this is sooo easily adjusted to however you like it, lighter or darker.  I beat it a good several minutes, so by the time it was done it was just beautifully fluffy.  I didn't measure the milk, just added it until I was happy with the consistency I wanted for piping. I used this frosting to top  "Brownie Batter + Cupcake = The SECOND BEST Cupcake. Ever," also from AR.

I've finally found it- this is THE chocolate frosting that I will use forever.  Chocolatey, creamy, just perfect.  I will also point out that this is actually Hershey's One Bowl Buttercream Frosting- exact same recipe, word-for-word.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This is the exact same recipe that appears on the box of  Hershey Cocoa.  I've used this recipe for years.  The trick is to make sure you beat the butter real good before you begin adding the confectioner's sugar and cocoa. Using a hand mixer, beat in as much as you can, then begin to add milk, a little a time. Also, as the package indicates, adjust the amount of cocoa to your taste; 1/4 cup for light flavor, 1/2 cup for medium flavor and 3/4 cup for dark flavor (which is what I use). Do you like "darK" chocolate over "milk" chocolate. Then use 1/2 cup of Hersheys "Special Dark" cocoa powder. The frosting is almost black in color - a whole different taste!

Both my mother and I have been using this recipe for years...it is delicious! However, I think that I will continue to look for a vanilla frosting recipe. This will work as a vanilla frosting, but in my experience,I find that without the cocoa, it is VERY sweet and seperates very easily.

The buttercream frosting I usually use can turn out a little sloppy so I decide to give this one a go. Brilliant didn't need any more milk was just right as it was. Put it on top of Grand pop's Special Chocolate Cake. Will use again. Thanks

This is the first frosting I've ever made and it was fantastic! I didn't alter a thing and everyone loved it! I will try the suggestion of using non-fat dry milk in place of cocoa when I need a vanilla frosting. Thanks!!

Simple and delicious.  For Vanilla frosting, 86 the powder cocoa but make sure to replace it with powder sugar otherwise the frosting will be too runny.  I also added a couple extra tablespoons of butter to taste.  Mmmm...

this is definitely my go-to frosting. It's super easy (I've been making it since i was 12), but it still tastes excellent. You won't need the full 1/3 cup of milk, and i find it helps to mix in the vanilla extract before you put in the milk. That way, you don't forget it and you can accurately tell how thick the frosting will be as you add the milk a little at a time. I certainly recomend this recipe!

Very good and very easy :) I doubled the recipe, adding just a tad more cocoa powder. I will definitely make it again.

This is a good basic recipe, I use half and half or cream for the liquid, and add slowly until I reach the consistancy I need. Sometimes I add a bit of espresso powder to increase the depth of the chocolate flavor.

Really good frosting, doubled recipe and added a  bit of flour to thicken.  Made into vanilla frosting.  It tasted very good with a chocolate cake.  We will make this again.

Very easy to make and very tasty!!  Wanted vanilla so I didnt add the cocoa but will next time.  I used mine to ice sugar cookies.  When I added the food coloring it made the icing thinner, exactly how I wanted for the cookies.  After icing them I let the cookies sit out and just kept checking on them to see if the icing would dry enough for me to be able to stack the cookies.  They dried perfectly, (couple of hours later so be sure to plan accordingly, I wasnt in any rush) I put them in a container and took them to the party.  They were such  a big hit I wished I had made more!! Thank you so much for this recipe, it is one I will be using again and again!!  P.S. I also love that you dont have to use shortening like other recipes.  I didnt have any shortening, didnt want to go to the store and is healthier withoout it.

LOVED this frosting!!!  I of course had to make a few changes.  I wanted vanilla so I could color it for a bday cake, so I omitted the cocoa powder.  And made these changes:  6 1/2 TBSP butter(just for a bit more flavor), 1/3 c heavy whipping cream and added 1 tsp of almond extract.  Totally awesome with the changes :)  Will def make again!!  Thanks :)

Easy and yummy!  Some things I learned along the way - powdered sugar DOES in fact get old and even with sifting those hard lumps will not help your frosting.  Test the powdered sugar first on your tongue and if you taste grains at ALL, sift more or buy fresh.  Makes a WORLD of difference.  Adding a bit of almond extract changes the flavor too and is wonderful.

Good and very easy to make. If I had used all the confectioner's sugar it would have been too sweet (at least for my taste). I mixed 2 cups of c. sugar with the cocoa and added probably about 1.5 cups (maybe a bit more) to the butter and because I was working with less sugar I used less milk. It was very easy to spread, looked great on the cake and tasted wonderful! Looking forward to trying the vanilla version as others noted.

LOVE this fluffy frosting! It's not as heavy as some buttercream can be and beats the pants off the store bought stuff! I added some cocoa powder to make a chocolate version and it was a hit! This one is going in my permanent file!

This frosting recipe is great in its own right, but I made a few changes based on another reviewer's suggestions.  I omitted the cocoa and instead of using half-and-half, which I did not have on hand, I used 1/3 cup of all natural vanilla-flavored coffee creamer (Coffee Mate's Natural Bliss) and omitted the vanilla extract.  I then added 1/8 t. of salt to off-set the sweetness a little. Wow! To my surprise, it turned out really creamy and tasty!  The creamer turned out to be a great substitute when out of half-and-half or heavy cream.  Great, easy recipe!!

Awesome! I used dry milk instead of cocoa to make vanilla frosting (as suggested by reviews) and it worked great! Never thought buttercream frosting could be easy...

LOVELY. This is absolutely scrumptious. It's rich, creamy, smooth, so chocolatey and the texture is just amazing. Thanks so much for this easy, easy recipe. I don't make scratch cakes often and I haven't had much luck with frosting recipes and I refuse to use store-bought frosting because I think it's disgusting. I made David's Yellow Cake from this site (excellent!), used this frosting and had not even a crumb left over to take home. Beautiful.

I wanted vanilla frosting (so did not use the cocoa) but this ended up too sweet, so I added 4 oz of cream cheese and it was fantastic.  Super easy and very good.

Fabulous, easy icing, perfect amount for 2- 8" square  layer cake. Used 7 T's butter, 3 cups confect sugar, added 1/3 t lemon juice to milk, 2 t's vanilla and replaced cocoa with 1/4 cup skimmed milk powder which was a brillant suggestion from other reviewer. Served on " simple white cake" from this site topped with berries. Awesome! Thank you!

Easy & delicious.  I used it as a frosting for Jenny's Black Forest Cake (also on this site).  I reserved some cherry juice and added it in place of some of the milk to tie all of the flavors together.  This is definitely making it into my tried & true recipe file...

This recipe really dissapointed me. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a mess. I refrigerated the icing because it was very liquidy and I needed to use it later and the second I put it on my cake it was ruined, plus it didn't even taste good. As well the consistency was thicky liquidy and granular which doesnt make sense because I used icing sugar not regular sugar.

Really good and easy frosting.I used it for cupcakes and it can frost around 24 cupcakes. Can replace the vanilla extract by other favors like lemon to match the cake.

This was a wonderful, tasty frosting!  I, too, was worried about the texture, but it truly does sit perfectly on the cake and doesn't seem gritty at all when you eat it.  I also used a lot more milk in this recipe (not only as necessary--but also to reduce sweetness!) That's why I'm only giving it four stars, I definitely think the recipe should call for more milk.  Otherwise, thanks for a keeper!!! *-V.

2nd time making it, 1st time made as chocolate and it was ah mazing, 2nd time I made it without chocolate and it wasn't as good and was too sweet my family said. All I tasted was powdered sugar and not buttercream. I do like the recipe, super simple and ingredients on hand is a plus, but I don't recommend making it just vanilla

This was great, but DON'T add all the milk at one time.  You won't need but half the amount (at least I didn't).  I left off the cocoa, as I wanted a vanilla frosting.  Perfect flavor & texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

The yield is way off. I just barely was able to frost 12 cupcakes and that was with added sugar. Second, as written this comes out runny - not fit to hold up as 'frosting'. I had to add sugar and even then it was not sturdy enough. Really too bad because it was yummy before I added the additional sugar to thicken it up. Once I added sugar it was too sweet. If you really want to give it a try - don't add 1/3 cup of milk! I'd start slow and gradually add...

I made this baby in the BLENDER and it was fantastic.  Exactly as called for, except for a few extra glugs of milk to make it creamier, and then just walked away for a few minutes.  It was SO GOOD that I had to give the cake away cause I was eating two pieces a day!

I found out I didn't have any baker's chocolate after making my cake and needed a recipe using cocoa powder.  I saw this recipe and had all the ingredients so I decided to give it a try.  I didn't expect much from such a simple recipe but I was really surprised, this is extraordinarily good!  Creamy and smooth!  It's my go-to frosting now.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I triple checked the recipe to make sure I didn't misread anything, and I definitely followed it exactly.  Unfortunately, I didn't think the frosting was very sweet and it was nothing like any buttercream I have ever had.  I eventually added another cup of confectioner's sugar and a tablespoon of peanutbutter to try to make it usable for my family.

The first time I made this I used half cocoa powder and half melted unsweetened chocolate.  A friend asked me to make this one again so it must be good...  The second time I didn't really measure anything and forgot the vanilla... still came out great!  :)  I used this on "Too Much Chocolate Cake" cupcakes.

This recipe itself tastes good but isn't really a "buttercream" as many know it.  I would use this for an old fashioned looking cake but not for decorating, personally.

This was a great tasting chocolate buttercream frosting. It made plenty for covering 24 cupcakes too. This was creamy, fluffy, and smooth. Nice flavor not too fudgy and it didn't taste like powdered sugar. Thanks. I'll use this one again.

This frosting was absolutely devine! I made vanilla frosting, and all I did was take out the cocoa. Here's a tip: If you make vanilla frosting, add more vanilla extract. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Okay I used this with teh One bowl chocolate cake III - was a total hit of the night  In fact never using store bought icing and cake mix again.   So worth the effort to make this.

This recipe made the by far absolute WORST frosting I have ever made. With no mistakes made, it came out thin and runny, not at all creamy and not fit to frost anything.  I ended up having to use maybe 6 cups of confectioner's sugar to get it to the right consistency. YUCK.

I love this recipe for frosting the Chocolate Eclair from this site.  I originally found this exact frosting recipe on the back of a Ghiradelli Cocoa can. I think using a good cocoa makes a big difference. This recipe is easy and delicious and one of my favorites that I have used countless times.  I always beat the butter first and sift in the cocoa and sugar before adding the remaining ingredients. I beat it for a good amount of time at the end, too.  Mmmm...delicious!

This recipe was ok. Made it with out the cocoa and it tasted good. However, it is very, very soft even with more powdered sugar. Applied to cupcakes with decorating tip, seemed good but then just seemed to melt. Would be better on a cake maybe, not cupcakes. Search for the perfect recipe continues.

I used 3 cups conf sugar, 1/3 cup milk, 1 T vanilla, after that it was still to runny for my liking so I added in some more conf sugar, still too runny, added some more vanilla, then A LOT more conf sugar to get it to a stiff consistency that I prefer.....the recipe is OK I guess if you want runny frosting, otherwise you kind of have to makeup your own as you go with this one

I used a little too much milk, but otherwise the texture was perfect.  It just hasn't set is all.  I left the cocoa out, but next time I may use it, or try it with cocoa and orange juice and orange extract.  Yummy!

I made this to frost a cake, and i was not pleased with the results. it spread relatively easily, but it tasted like eating pure sugar. Everyone ended up scooping it off and just eating the cake. If you are set on this recipe, then try using a little... or a lot less sugar.

I was actually extremely happy with this recipe. I used soymilk, and only half the cocoa powder. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg as I was using it to frost a spice cake. This was the only frosting recipe that I found that used the ingredients that I had in the house and it turned out better than I could have hoped for. I did mix it for a long time on high and it really made everything rich and creamy.

This was pretty good.  I used a whole stick of butter, 3 c powdered sugar (no cocoa), and 1/6 c fat-free half and half with 1/6 c milk (really, I changed almost everything, which makes this a different recipe).  I put this on a decadent two-layer chocolate cake.  Such a rich buttercream was probably not the best idea, but the icing alone was fine.  Together, the cake and icing were a little overpowering.

This frosting has a great consistency and wasn't hard to make.  It lacked something, though.  The left-overs made GREAT graham cracker sandwhich cookies!  I will try it again sometime.

Turned out great. Just remember to add the milk, sugar, and cocoa alternately. And only use a splash at a time of milk.

I started baking about six months ago and I tend to seek out recipes that are often easier than other recipes. Just because they're easier doesn't mean they are less tasty. This frosting was outstanding. I made it properly.....woohooo..

this frosting was probably the best one ever it was really thick but it had a really good chocolate flavor. I definitely loved it. I made it for vanilla cupcakes and it worked really well.

I did not want chocolate for the carrot cake, so I used coconut milk, flaked coconut and added a bit of pineapple on top as well. I almost always just follow recipes and that it is that. But ventured out and it was really yummy, Looked nice too.

I love this recipe! I made it just as it said and I was happy with it. Although it was a hit, my family would personally cut back on the powdered sugar with 2 cups of the powered sugar and an extra splash of milk. A word to the wise too, ours had to be refrigerated because it started melting slowly especially when I placed strawberries slices on it(delicious with fresh strawberries btw). Once cold it didn't really melt. Thanks for the recipe! Finally found one I love.

This is the BEST, made from scratch, icing recipe I have ever tried. Believe me, there have been many. I did use the cocoa and the flavor is amazing.  I read reviews and used half & half instead of milk. accidentally poured too much vanilla in, it tastes great, but is a bit thinner than I would have liked.  Its late this evening and I need to be done, so not much of a decoration, but it'll have to suffice.

I just made this- it turned out pretty well. I think it's a little bit greasy- i was expecting fluffier and lighter? I also will use less cocoa next time, only because I prefer a less chocolatey tasting frosting. all around a decent buttercream recipe.

I really liked this icing. I used it on a chocolate Bundt cake. I got two comments that it tasted like canned frosting but better... Very tasty, easily spreadable, and easy to make. Sometimes I use hazelnut extract instead of vanilla... Yum.

I made it exactly as written. This is a light and creamy, spreadable, versatile buttercream. It's absolutely delicious. I put it on one-bowl chocolate cake and people came back for seconds. So easy to make. I highly recommend sifting the sugar and cocoa together before adding the wet ingredients. That way there are are no little lumps of sugar to beat to death. This is my new go-to frosting. I always have the ingredients in my pantry.

It is quite good. Not as rich as when fondant is added. I did add cream instead of milk and it was light and smooth. Very nice. If you are frosting a cake that is larger than nine inches round or taller than two layers, you might want to make 1.5 to 2 times the recommended amount. I like the frosting about .4 inches thick on top and there was just not enough in one recipe to sculpt the top of the cake. It's hardly a criticism if I wanted to use more, now isn't it!?

I forgot to get a can of chocolate frosting at the grocery store, so I did a search and found this recipe.  I made it as written, and I don't think I'll ever buy the canned stuff again.  Not too sweet, and the chocolate flavor really comes through.  A winner!

This is delicious!!!! It was one of the first chocolate buttercreams I made and it was so easy to make! I actually substituted the milk for heavy cream and added a little more then the recipe called for (about a half cup) and then I whipped it. It turned out amazing!!!

It was VERY sweet right when it was done.  I used dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa. I will have to wait and see how it fares on my cake tomorrow night for New Years Eve.  Hopefully as it sits it will taste better.

Great flavor. I double the recipe and it's just right for a two layer 9 inch cake. So many recipes use a couple tablespoons of cocoa.  This recipe creates a great chocolate buttercream.  Really satisfies that chocolate craving

At first I was doubtful about this recipe.  Don't be fooled, it turns out amazing.  The only complaint is not about the frosting , just that there wasn't enough of it  to frost a cake so I had to make a second batch.   I used Dutch processed coco because that's all I had and it turned dark and delicious.  I couldn't keep my finger out of this and I know y family will love it!

I halved the recipe for what I needed and it turned out fine. I did add a little more extra cocoa and next time I might add a bit more butter to make the frosting a little stiffer.

OMG...delicious!  I have never made any kind of buttercream frosting before, but made it today.  I followed the recipe as  written, with the exception of creaming the butter first by itself.  Then sifted both the confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder together into the butter.  Then added the milk and vanilla as stated.  It was really easy to make, very smooth and turned out perfectly! Will be using this recipe from now on, instead of buying Pillsbury or DH canned frosting.  Thank you so very much for sharing the recipe!  :-)

This is delicious and easy. I made it exactly as written, except I added a pinch of salt at the end. Tastes like homemade chocolate ice cream!

Make sure to sift the cocoa powder and the powdered sugar! Best after refrigerating for a little while.

best frosting ever ... it isnt runny and not to thick .. you can barely taste the butter unlike other frostings where the taste of the chocolate gets lost. my favourite one so far

Awesome recipe. I used pareve vegan butter and rice/grain milk due to a milk allergy in the family, and the frosting still comes out amazing. I actually didn't need the whole 1/3 cup milk... but that might be because rice milk is thinner than real milk. 

FYI, this tastes AMAZING paired with the Vegan Chocolate Cake Recipe here.

I used half and half, doubled the recipe and sifted 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of cocoa powder then 3 1/2 cups of sugar. After creaming the butter  I slowly added the sugar and cocoa but it was not mixing well. I added 1/2 of the half and half and mixed it slowly. It mixed well and I scraped the bowl down. Added the rest of the half and half, mixed slowly until incorporated, scraped the bowl again, then turned up the speed for a couple of minutes. It came out great.

Best frosting I've ever tasted! Followed the recipe exactly as written using skim milk. Need to double it next time as it just barely covered an 8 inch layer cake. So good!!!

The only change I made was using half butter and half butter-flavored shortening (had to use what I had on hand).  This is an excellent recipe that came together easily and has a rich chocolate taste.

Excellent flavor.  I doubled the recipe for a 9" double layer round cake. Perfect amount with about 1/2 cup left over frosting.  I ended up using  a little less than 2/3 cup milk.  Just add the milk a little at a time for the right consistency. I sifted the powdered sugar and cocoa through a strainer to get rid of clumps.

Awesome! added 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Added milk 1 tablespoon at a time until I got desired consistency to pipe onto cupcakes. Made about 2 cups of frosting- enough for about 14 cupcakes. Yum!!!!!

This is the BEST chocolate frosting on the planet., hands down. You can increase the amount of cocoa to 3/4 cup if you want it insanely chocolaty. Or double the recipe. Try to get some high quality cocoa like Callebaut - it's available online.  
Important you let butter sit on counter until soft - at least a few hours. DO NOT melt the butter over heat.

I love the recipe just the way it is. The second time around making it I added lemon extract and almond extract for some added unique flavor. My family loves the great flavor and chocolatyness of the the frosting. I love using this with the Mayo cake recipe the 2 work well together.

Liked it. Made it purple by adding powdered color to milk. Left out choco Powder , frosting a little grainy. Maybe my powdered sugar was too wet. Going to try again with cocoa powder. Maybe a smig more vanilla next time too

So yummy! I made this to go on a chocolate layer cake and it was a great choice! I liked it so much I had to make more - and I will probably make it again, even though I'm not a chocolate person.

This recipe is a good one. I did not follow the amounts for the powdered sugar as I like to do that to taste. However, it is a good standard recipe for good buttercream frosting.

Heavenly is the first word that came to mind when I tasted this frosting!  The reviewer who said it had good mouth feel wasn't kidding - it has a super silky texture and the flavor is outstanding!  I frosted a chocolate cake tonight and cannot wait until tomorrow to try it... my mouth is watering!  This is now the ONLY chocolate frosting recipe I will use.

Made this for the first time this morning.  Used Imperial margarine as I was out of butter.  Only needed 1/4 cup of milk.  Very good flavor and incredibly easy to spread.  Will definitely return to this recipe when frosting is needed for cakes and cookies.

Frosting was good. Unfortunately, not the exact taste I'm used to for buttercream,, but good. In the end, turned out a little runnier than I thought it should be. Will use a tad less milk next time and see if that doesn't make it thicker. But overall, pretty good.

I only added two cups confectioners sugar, and increased the cocoa by 1/4 cup. It was getting too sweet for my taste. Beat for a long time to break down the graininess of the con. sugar.

I just made this for my husband's birthday cake and it is scrumptious!  I omitted the cocoa as he likes just plain buttercream frosting added just a splash more vanilla extract than it calls for.  It so smooth and rich!!!  Perfect!

Great frosting and easily adaptable. Mix the cocoa and powdered sugar before adding to the butter to ensure even distribution. Not my favorite, but much tastier than canned frosting, easy and cheap too. I will probably use the "special recipe dark" cocoa next time for more chocolate flavor and a richer color too.

This was really a nice compliment to my double chocolate fudge brownies. The only thing that makes it 4/5 stars is that it wasn't quite sweet enough for my taste. I ended up adding an extra 2/3 cup of powdered sugar. Other than that, great recipe with a FANTASTIC consistency for spreading and decorating!

Left a lot to be desired.  I ended up adding a lot of extra things in after tasting the finished product as written and being very unimpressed.   As a donut frosting it would work well, it is a good consistency and flavor for that, but as a cookie frosting it falls short.

Great frosting. Reminded me of the frosting my favorite bakery uses on their chocolate covered cake donuts. My husband wasn't thrilled with the cake I made but told me the frosting was yummy so I'll definitely be using this recipe again in the future. And to think...I hadn't made home made frosting since home economics in Junior High School which was a LONG LONG LONG time ago.

Meh, I honestly don't think this is a good buttercreme recipe. I had to tweak quite a bit to get something I could use and I am a very seasoned frosting maker. I won't be using this one again =(

I accidentally threw everything in together and then mixed, and it still came out perfect.  I didn't think it looked like enough to frost a 2 layer cake, but there was still enough left to lick the bowl.  Delicious!

You know how you remember something from your childhood & then you experience it again as an adult & it never matches what you remember?  This frosting brought back my childhood; tasted like I remember, maybe better!  It was the best tasting frosting that I have tasted since.  Texture was creamy & held up on a still-warm cake.  Can't wait to bake again.

This is very yummy and sweet! I wish I read all of the comments because I missed the one that said it was runny with out the cocoa. This is also a very sweet frosting. Next time I will add some whipped cream to it and see how that works.

not the best frosting. I only gave it three stars because I was able to sort-of fix it with more butter and  conf. sugar and beating until it was really fluffy... will not make again.

This came out wonderful. I wanted half vanilla buttercream and half chocolate. So I mixed it together and divided it in half, then added only half of the cocoa. I used it in between the layers of a 3 layer cake.

This is really good and pretty much fool proof. I used a large bowl to make it in because that's all I have. So I wasn't able to alternate with the sugar/cocoa and milk, so I just added all the milk in and a bit of the sugar/cocoa and beat it, but it still made a cloud of powder. So I just mixed it with a rubber spatula, adding a bit more powder each time. Then I beat it all together with my electric hand mixer and - voila! It is perfect. Since I don't like my icing too sweet (and some other reviewers said it was) I only used 2.5c icing sugar and used 2/3c cocoa. Still a bit sweet for me but my husband loves it! Didn't need extra milk.

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!! Best Frosting I Ever Tasted!! I had never made a frosting from scratch before so i was nervous. and at first I didn't like the way it looked and thought it tasted to buttery. But when I put it on the yellow 13x9" cake... Omg it was So Delicious! My family Completly Devoured it. I also covered it with multicolored nonpareils sprinkles. So Good! I will definitly be making this again and again.

my confectioners sugar wasn't quite powdered enough and this frosting came out absolutely horrible. when i think of buttercream frosting, i think of light, buttery, rich creamy frosting. when I made this, I got watery, gritty, too sweet, liquid.  i didnt even bother frosting my cake with it. I wont be making this recipe again, even though it was my mistake of usong not-powdered-enough sugar, I dont think this recipe would have tasted like buttercream anyway.

Outstanding!  Just like the kind we made when I was a child, before the store bought kind.  My daughters loved it, it was easier for them to frost with because it is so 'whippy!'

I whipped this one up in minutes and it tasted great! I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter and only used half the amount of cocoa.

This recipe was easy to make and quite yummy.  I reduced the amount of cocoa to lighten the chocolate flavour and my husband loved it.
