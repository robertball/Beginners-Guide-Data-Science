I'm not a blue fish fan, so I used smoked trout instead and threw in some capers just for fun. I loved this and so did my guests. Thank you Karen!!

I have trouble finding bluefish and have used trout and mackerel, otherwise I follow the recipe to the tee. Both of which make a nice pate. Always gets rave reviews from friends and family!
