This tastes great and I love the added fibre of the oats.  I was worried about proofing the yeast with the instructions provided, so I only put 2 cups of boiling water to soak with the oats.  For the remaining 1/4 cup of water, I used warm water, sprinkled one teaspoon of sugar and the yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes once the oats were done soaking and they I mixed it all together - this worked well! Light and flavourful, great for sandwiches or just eating toasted with a bit of butter.

Not a fan.  This bread came out super dense.  The flavor was ok, but it was so dense that if you didn't  toast  it, you were eating a brick.

Turned out great. What I did differently was substitute 2 cups of bread flour with whole wheat and I did knead bread in mixer on dough hook and then by hand as I felt mixer was getting too much of a workout!   Definitely a keeper.

I was in a bread making mood today, so after making a French baguette, i decided to try this recipe.  I did cut the recipe in half to make 1 loaf--I love being able to do that by changing the serving size and letting Allrecipes do the math!!!  I was very pleased with this bread!  It is dense, but still soft like a sandwich bread.  I have all ready made sandwiches with it for the hubby's lunch.  It did take awhile to rise...not sure if it was that the oat mixture was too cold when I started adding the other ingredients and the yeast was just slow to activate, or it needs a touch more yeast?  I love the taste of molasses in a bread and paired with oatmeal, it is a winning combo!  Thanks for the recipe, Swaneeramsey!

Delicious bread! Not overly sweet, but it has a nice "dark" flavor due to the molasses. I used milk instead of water, and a mix of all-purpose and whole wheat flour. I also halved the recipe to make 1 loaf. This bread is moist in the center, with a nice hefty crust that is perfect for dipping into soup! Thank you for the recipe!
