Very good. I added some blu cheese crumbles and both my picky boyfriend and I enjoyed for dinner. Loved the honey mustard dressing. I used grey poupon mustard instead.

Quite a tasty combination. I wasn't sure if the recipe was calling for mustard powder or prepared mustard. I used regular prepared mustard and it was quite good, though I imagine Dijon would also be quite nice.
