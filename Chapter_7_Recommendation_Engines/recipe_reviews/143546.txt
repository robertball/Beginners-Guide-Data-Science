I really think this recipe is outstanding!  My boyfriend LITERALLY licked his plate clean!  The texture is fluffy and light, with just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries (just a personal preference), and used a different crust recipe just because it's my favorite and I like to have crust on the sides AND bottom: 2 cups graham crackers, ¼ cup pecans, ½ tsp cinnamon
½ cup butter (melted).  You also don't have to pre-cook this crust so I found it to be a time-saver.  Next time I might try to put a thin layer of the liquid raspberry sauce on top of the crust (under the filling) so it can seep into the crust during baking for some extra raspberry flavor.

During the holidays, I sometimes make an orange cheesecake that is to die for.  It has been a few years since I made it but this year I finally succumbed to my children’s request.  I could not find my recipe but my research lead me to this recipe as it best matched my recollection of my former recipe.  The cheesecake turned out so well that I felt compelled to review this recipe because this technique is excellent.  The resulting cheesecake is so light and fluffy that you will feel as though you are not eating a sinfully delicious treat.  I substituted a chocolate-hazelnut crust by using 1 pkg of Famous chocolate wafers, ½ cup chopped hazelnuts, ¼ cup sugar and ¼ cup butter.  I crushed the wafers in the blender with the hazelnuts a quarter package at a time by using the pulse button on and off for about 30 seconds each batch.  After mixing in the butter and sugar, I pressed it into the spring pan on the bottom and the sides.  I substituted orange flavoring for the lemon with 1/4 cup fresh orange juice, finely grated orange zest from 1 orange and 2 tsp orange extract.  I followed the recipe's instructions explicitly and chilled the cheesecake overnight after I let it cool in the oven.  After removing from the spring pan, I cut the cheesecake with a knife that has been rinsed in hot water in between each slice.  I then serve with a drizzle of chocolate syrup

AMAZING cheesecake!! You must try this recipe! Used 2 cups vanilla wafers crumbs, 1/4 pecans, 1/2 cup butter melted and teaspoon of cinnamon for crust, baked 6-8 minutes. ( my favorite crust ). like the other reviews said, there was too much filling, so I had a reserve pan ready to go and got another little cheesecake out of it! Added another tablespoon of lemon zest to filling, I like things extra lemon and tart, and it was perfect for my taste. This technique produces the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake I've ever made. Will make this again...soon!

Un-be-LIEVE-ABLE!!!!! Made this for Mother's Day, and it got RAVES from everyone! My brother nearly tackled me as I was wrapping the leftovers to take home! The only thing I did differently was used two blocks of lo-fat cream cheese (my secret!) with the full fat and just cooked the blueberries down with the sugar. Didn't feel like juicing and all that work. And no one was any wiser. I also used a 10" springform, and the cake rose to the edge of the pan. Thanks for a 10-star recipe!

the perfect consistency (for me!)--not as dense as a crumbly cheesecake nor as soft as those mousse-y ones. i halved the recipe, and the filling fit a 9-inch store-bought graham cracker crust perfectly. also omitted the topping for a super easy and delicious dessert. otherwise followed the recipe and the lemon flavor was wonderful!

Delicious!  Like another reviewer, I also had too much filling for my pan so I may use a larger pan next time.  And like another reviewer, it was difficult to cut so I'll probably freeze it before cutting next time.   My husband is gluten-intolerant so I used gluten-free graham cracker-type crumbs instead of the regular variety.

I have never made a cheesecake before. Googled "lemon cheesecake". I started at 9 pm (Rookie mistake ... Oh how little I knew!) to cut to the chase, I made it right by the instructions. Baked it. Was afraid I had undercooked it. Surfed the net again and figured I might be ok.  I did add more lemon zest than the recipe called for. I took it to a party at my daughters house ... afraid. She had one from a bakery too. Next thing I know people are streaming from the kitchen raving about the lemon cheesecake. Was nice to admit that I had made it.  Had 1 piece to bring home. Will make again ... perhaps with oranges this time.  **** First timers ... notice it is a lemon soufflé cheesecake *** texture is lighter and fluffier ... all the positive comments were that description. It was a whole lot of work, but fun in the end. Will make again!!

This cheesecake is amazing. The only thing I changed was instead of making the topping, I put a can of blueberry pie filling on along with some whipping cream. So good. I was worried that it was not fully cooked when the time was up as when I put a knife in the middle, it came out looking almost runny. But after letting it set and cool, it was perfect. So moist and airy with a wonderful lemon taste.

This recipe was amazingly good and, though a bit more labor intensive than I'm used to, very fun to make. I made for friends and family and everyone raved about it. Like some other comments mention, I ended up with a bit too much filling. Also, next time I would make more crust, as I thought it was too thin. One other thing, I would refrigerate it longer next time for more firmness and ease of cutting. I don't think the taste could be improved upon. Great recipte!

Light and fluffy yet rich and decadent, this soufflé was a huge hit at my family's Christmas party last year.  I've never made a soufflé before this and found the idea of it somewhat intimidating.  Luckily, it was pretty easy and came out beautifully!  If I could give it an extra star, I would!

This was amazing!!  I loved the fluffy, airy texture!  I did use raspberries instead of blueberries (personal preference) and it was to die for!  My only problem was that I ended up with too much filling for my spring form pan...so I just put the extra in custard cups and baked it seperatly.  This recipe was well worth the effort and I will make agian and again!

I made this recipe yesterday for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. People went back for a second helping. I however did find it very hard to cut and serve. It feel apart as I was putting it on a plate. Taste was amazing as for being able to serve that is a different story. 
I will make this again because of flavor, I think  I will also take the sugestion of others and freeze it a little before cutting.

I made the graham cracker crust. I was amazing. Big cracks but i don't care because it was creamy goodness. I topped it with the blueberry souffle recipe topping.

Absolutely WONDERFUL. It was very light and airy, I used more lemon than the recipe called for (about twice as much) and it came out just fine. I read a review that said someone's boyfriend literally licked the plate... well so did mine :) everyone loved it, it's a little involved, but definitely worth it!

Everyone thought this was great, we actually used blackberries instead of blueberries. I also had a hard time cutting it, but overall I would make this again.

Thank you, MerryMoBerry!! This was amazing. Brought it to a 4th of July bbq and everyone asked for the recipe and said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had! But, the water bath is not really necessary. It's enough to wrap the outside of the pan in heavy foil. That gives enough insulation to stabilize the cheese cake and it won't crack.  I didn't find that the extra moisture from the water bath was required. I have made enough cheesecakes to try this with confidence and it was just fine. Freezing before cutting, as others have mentioned, is something I will do next time. I should have taken their advice but thought that the cake would be fine after sitting for about 48 hours.  Nope.  Freeze :)

Since I was making this for just 2 people, I quartered this recipe and made 4 individual sized cheesecakes in ramekins. With the smaller containers, I cut baking time to 35 minutes and let them sit in the oven with the door open for about 45 minutes. They turned out absolutely perfect — delicate, smooth, really delicious. The blueberry topping probably wasn’t even necessary, but it did add some nice tartness and depth of flavor to compliment the lemon in the cheesecake. Will definitely make this again!

I made this excellent cheesecake according to the recipe as written. I had enough extra batter to make an additional12 cupcakes (after quickly making more crust). My guests loved it! Next time, I won't bother with the suggested method for the blueberry topping; I'll just sweeten the blueberries before serving. I used gluten-free ingredients to accommodate guests, and it worked fine. I made it a day ahead, refrigerated overnight, then put it in the freezer for a few hours, removing it about three hours before serving, and that was perfect. This is a keeper!

This was fabulous and I would give it 10 stars!   Only adjustments were to use the zest & juice of both 1 lemon and 1 lime and used a 10" springform pan.  Baking time 55 minutes (turned once at 30 minutes) and set in oven one hour before placing in fridge.  NO CRACKS and flavor is amazing.  Light texture with the same taste as a non-souffle cheesecake.  

* My ingredients were out for about 3 hours (a/c on) and the added step of beating the white was minimal and well worth it.  I am glad I didn't change this step and you will be too!  

Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

I loved this recipe! It was light without giving up the rich flavor of cheese cake. I didn't find it difficult to make as long as you stay organized. I read through the recipe and measured everything out out before I began. I mixed everything then I made the egg whites with the sugar and folded them in.  I did add extra lemon zest almost double what the recipe called for  since I love lemon.  The mixture came to the top of the pan and I was concerned it would rise over the top. It did go past the top of the pan during cooking but, it did not spill over. When I let it sit in the oven after cooking it did go back down so it was level with the top. It did crack some but, no problem for me. I made the blueberry sauce per the recipe but, I did not separate the juice. I also did not add fresh blueberries to the mixture. I let my guest choose if they wanted fresh blueberries or the sweetened mixture. It does need to be refrigerated at least 6 hours. Overnight is better. I also froze it  for 3 hours. The result was a smooth creamy delight  with a fluffy texture and a nice lemon taste. I thought it was the best cheesecake I have ever made. My guest agreed and wanted more. Next time, I will add a little more lemon for a more tart taste for the sweetened blueberries. I think I will also try key limes without any fruit topping. A key pie with cheesecake. What a treat!

VERY GOOD RECIPE. My grandfather said that this is one of the best desserts that he has had in HIS WHOLE LIFE. And although a very heavy dessert, I agree. My only concern is that there is A LOT of cheesecake filling. I think next time I make this I will only use 3 packets of cream cheese. Also, I used an extra tbsp of butter for the crust. Overall, WILL MAKE AGAIN.

Absolutely perfect! Made it exactly as the recipe says and it was amazing. A little involved, so make sure you have the time available, but definitely worth the work. Everyone loved it. :)

Quite a strong lemony taste but the texture is AMAZING. However this isn't one of those cakes to reduce the sugar because it just makes the cake tart. Very tart.

I made it exactly as the recipe is written, though I used a 10-inch springform pan which was the perfect size, and I put some Grenadine in the blueberry syrup for a kick  :)  

This was FANTASTIC and a big hit.  The cake is sooooo light and fluffy you can hardly tell it's a cheesecake.  It's got a wonderful bright flavor and the blueberry sauce hits it out of the park!  I had no problem unmolding this but I wonder if it will cut better frozen...it was a bit messy to cut.  If you're serving this to a crowd it might be better to make this into single serve, little cheesecakes.  But in the end WHO CARES how it cuts, it was so good and a perfect combination of fluffy and rich nobody will really care...it tastes too good.  Just go make it, you won't be sorry.

This is amazing!  So light and delish...my daughter said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had...think though that I will take the advice of some and not put all of the filling in as I felt that it wasn't quite done enough in the center for me...maybe add a bit more baking time..five minutes or so.

This is a great recipe. This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, so I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. Although it took a bit of work, the cake was absolutely scrumptious and so worth the effort. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this three different times in the past month for parties. All three times it was gone in seconds. It's very light and refreshing. I didn't change the recipe except for the last time I used raspberry topping and it seemed to complement the lemon better. It's really worth the extra effort to make!!!

Loved this cheesecake! had no problems with it at all, and it was my first cheesecake! I did do raspberries instead of blueberries, but i'm sure it tastes just as good with either. thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I followed the instructions exactly and this turned out beautifully!  This was definitely the best cheese cake I've ever eaten!  I really appreciated the tip on freezing the cake slightly before cutting as that made it cut very nicely with a cake cutter put under warm water after every cut.  With the blueberries in sauce drizzled on top and down the sides, each piece looked beautiful!  I took it to a Thanksgiving dinner where there were 15 people and 4 pies and another  dessert available.  I took home very little while 3 pies didn't even get touched and the other dessert only had 2 pieces eaten.  I will most certainly make this recipe again and again!

Most definitely chef error but, I wrapped the springform pan in foil and placed in the water and it leaked into the bottom of the cheesecake. The crust was ruined. I would appreciate knowing if it would change the outcome if you just put the springform pan directly into the oven. The lemon cheesecake was lovely

How have I not reviewed this yet when I’ve made it at least 8 times?!? The best comment I can make about this recipe is that I made it exactly as written, donated it to the school for the annual fundraiser dinner’s  “dessert dash”, and it sold for $100 at auction! Beautiful, delicious and prize worthy. Thank you so much for sharing.

I made this as written, and it was a rather involved process but not difficult. The flavor and texture of the cheesecake were excellent. I chose this because I had a quince sauce on hand already, that had vanilla and lemon flavors in it. It was a lovely and festive finish for my Christmas dinner. Even my chocolaholic hubby said he wanted it again next year!

I thought this cheesecake was wonderful, but was not a fan of the sauce.  This sauce had a fine flavor, but was too runny.  The blueberries stayed on top of the cheesecake and the juice just went all over my plate and seeped into the cheesecake.  If I make this again, I will use a different sauce recipe.

I've made this recipe multiple times. It is what our family calls a "KEEPER". I used sugar substitute(truvia blend or Swerve) without anyone even noticing. I also doubled the amount of lemon zest and made it crustless without any complications or changes in taste.

Loved the cheesecake, however the graham cracker crust was too dry, I will add another tablespoon of butter next time.  I also cooked the blueberries in the sugar and strained them, making a little over a cup of juice, then whisked in a packet of gelatin, ;et it cool to room temperature, then poured it in the middle of the cooled cheesecake. I used an offset spatula to spread just to the edges.  It made a beautiful firm blueberry ring around the top.

This is sex in your mouth! Made no changes to cheese cake, just to the blueberry sauce. First, I used frozen wild blueberries as they are smaller. And instead of dividing the blueberries i cooked them all and did not strain them. Turned out excellent.

Loved this recipe. This is so much lighter than the standard cheesecake and the lemon flavor really pops. The blueberries balance out the tart of the cheesecake. Fairly easy to do, MUST have ingredients at room temp before combining to get that creamy consistency. To slice use a knife rinsed in water after each slice. Will make again.

Big hit at Easter dinner today. Definitely will make again even though my husband says he prefers the denser cheesecakes. Do not skip the blueberry sauce. Really a plus. I was not a big fan of the crust.  Too crumbly. Will reread reviews and look for some suggestions.

The recipe looked like a challenge, so I took it on. I agree that it was a bit labor intensive but the sweat equity made it worth the trouble. Next time, I'll use more graham cracker crust (two cups) and leave it in the fridge longer than 4 hours (overnight would be perfect).

I wasn't a big fan of this cheesecake. While it rose to the top of the pan, by the next day it had fell to about half of it's raised height. It was still light, however too savory for my tastes.

Incredibly delicious! Incredibly hard to stop eating!!  I used Meyer lemons b/c i had them. Wonderful lemon flavor! I thought the blueberry topping distracted from the lemon flavor of the cake so next time I'll serve the cake without a topping. My cake topped over so it was a bit of a presentation-fail and add to that it's  really hard to serve b/c it's so soft. I agree with others about needing a bigger pan and freezing a bit before slicing.  But it's easy to make and a winning recipe!

Very good.  Not as light as I thought,  though that's not really a bad thing.   Also not lemony enough......I'll add more next time.  We are snowed in tomorrow and plan on eating nothing but cheesecake...lol.

I didn't have a spring form pan so I tried a pie pan. It wasn't nearly large enough for the amount of filling. Next time I'll double the crust and make it in a 9x13 cake pan.

This cheesecake is the best I have had in a very long time.  
I cut the recipe in half to try it out before making it for a dinner party and used one of the raters vanilla cookie crumb crust (which is delicious, thank you for the idea!)
This is a light, creamy and delicious cheesecake that will be my go to from now on.

This is a really nice cheesecake recipe, especially if, like me, you’re not crazy about the heavier, denser version of a NY style cheesecake. This is lighter and fluffier but still has a nice cheesecake flavor.
Easy to customize with different flavors too. Orange or Vanilla Bean are great alternatives.
I always use my favorite graham  cracker crust for cheesecake’s:
9 to 10 whole graham crackers (should make about 2 cups graham cracker crumbs), 1/4 cup whole toasted almonds that have been roughly chopped, pinch of salt, 2 Tablespoons sugar, 4 Tbls melted Butter (don’t use margarine! :)). 
Place whole graham crackers into food processor, pulse until almost crumbs, add almonds, process until crackers are crumbs and almonds are chopped fine but still have some small bits. Add sugar, salt and butter, pulse a couple times to combine all. Should feel like wet sand. Pour into 9” springform pan and press down with bottom of 1/2 cup size measuring cup until bottom is covered and crumbs are about 1/2” up sides of pan and crumb mixture is evenly distributed. Bake for 8-10 min in 350 oven. Let cool before filling.
This type of cheesecake really needs to set up for easy cutting. I recommend making a Day in advance so it can stay in fridge overnight.

This is the best cheesecake! Not thick and heavy - I don't like that heavy cheesecake personally. And it steps you right through how to make a proper cheesecake. You could omit the lemon if you don't like lemon and just make vanilla or maple..still delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used a 10 inch pan and it was AWESOME!  Even before the blueberries, the lemon cheesecake amazing. Great flavor and texture. Will definitely make again.

Great consistency. I used the pecan graham cracker crust from another reviewer. Most surely needs more lemon zest it is way to mild as is. Will make again with this tweak.

Great recipe. I followed it exactly. I'll definitely make it again - the flavor was very yummy. The only thing that I would change is to bake it for longer. It wasn't fully set from the middle when I served it :(.

I loved the texture!  But, it was a bit too sweet and too lemony. I couldn't taste the cheese at all. Next time I'm going to cut the lemon in half and cut the sugar to 1 cup.

Just made this cheesecake last night. I just finished my first slice, and I might eat the entire thing! This is heavenly! A perfect summer dessert! Consistency is beautiful and fluffy and the blueberry topping just makes it. I added some more lemon juice (about a half a cup) and some additional sugar to my blueberry topping simply because I love lemon and my blueberries weren't quite sweet enough. Also I had to add a lot more butter to my graham crackers to get the crust to the right consistency. Otherwise, just awesome! I will definitely add this to my favorites!

I attempted to make this for a family dinner. I couldn't get it to set. My mixture was lovely and fluffy. I cooked it for 30 minutes longer but that made the top brown, which maybe due to using a fan oven. After leaving it in the fridge it did firm up but not enough to be able to slice it. Such a shame. It tasted fantastic!!!  Would love to try this again so if anyone has any hints on what went wrong  Id love to hear them. Delcia

This recipe was amazing, I made this at the restaurant i worked at and it literally flew off the dessert counter and i myself couldn't stop eating. I make a lot of cheesecakes and i think this just became my new personal favorite! It's a little time consuming and i feel a tad challenging for someone who cooks more then they bake as i do but well worth it if you pull it off! I made my own blueberry sauce cause this one wasn't my favorite. I just took like 2 cups frozen blueberrys and a cup of water and a cup of sugar and let it reduce down for like 15 minutes drained the berrys out of the juice added their blueberry mixture a slurry mixture of a 1/4 cup water and 2 tsp cornstarch and slowly added that in.

Looked great in the spring form but after unmolding it spooning the blueberry mixture over top, the mud slide began. I could only stand back and watch a gorgeous formed dessert turn into a messy pile on a platter. The whipped egg whites must have given this recipe a texture that was much too light. If I had enough parfait glasses, I would have scooped it up and added a dollop of whipped cream and a graham cracker streusel. This dessert was going over to some friends so I just topped it off with some fresh cut pansy blossoms from our garden. I couldn't stop laughing after what happened.

Great recipe!  Lighter than a regular cheesecake, but with the same delicious flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as written....everyone loved it!

I used strawberries instead, just a preference. Much different textutre than dense cheesecakes that I'm used to. Great lemon flavor.

Very good! But very time consuming and a lot of work. I don't think I would make it exactly like this again, because I can make a simpler recipe and still have a delicious homemade lemon cheesecake!
