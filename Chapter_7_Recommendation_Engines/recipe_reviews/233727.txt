One of my favorite breakfast recipes! So easy and so good. Tastes just like oatmeal you would cook stovetop except it's served chilled. I used 2% milk and about a teaspoon of brown sugar and no salt (my personal taste) and thought it was creamy good. I put the ingredients in a small canning jar (except for the fresh fruit, I added that right before eating), put the lid on and popped into the fridge and breakfast was ready when I was. Ideal for people "on the go" and add-ins and combinations of are endless. Step 2 is confusing and doesn't make sense, just eat it out of the jar after it sits overnight and topping with fresh fruit (use a big enough container to accommodate add-ins). I like this breakfast too with a big dollop of Greek yogurt and fresh fruit. My tummy thanks you Shannon!

I love this in summer...healthy and refreshing. I substitute almond milk for non- dairy alternative and use real maple syrup for sweetener instead of brown sugar. I have also mixed in some cocoa powder and dry peanut butter into the almond milk before adding the oats. I then add unsalted peanuts and mini chocolate chips before eating. Yum!

I switched out the half and half for 1% milk and left out the salt. It cut the calories down from 469 to 357. and less fat.
