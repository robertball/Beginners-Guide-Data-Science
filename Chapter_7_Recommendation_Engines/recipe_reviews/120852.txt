Fabulous side dish for poultry, meat or fish. The carrots give it a sweet flavor. I added two cloves of garlic along with the carrots and some pepper with the spices.

Nice flavor! I would suggest cutting back the cooking time to 5 minutes each instead of 10 for crisp-tender veggies. Very simple, yummy recipe! Thanks!

This was a simple, visually pleasing vegetable dish. My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I used a little less vinegar than was called for because I'm not a big vinegar fan, but my husband added some to his to make it more like the recipe.

I thought this was ok but nothing fantastic. I think it was missing some flavor. Perhaps the garlic that everyone writes about would have made a big difference.

A very light, very easy side dish. I had to use a little more oil after adding the zucchini & I only used a pinch of seasoning. Even my 2 yr old like it! Thx for the recipe.

I made this as directed but found that the zucchini was overcooked at the end of the stated time.  I enjoyed this dish, but DH did not.  Overall, this was a healthy, different way to eat zucchini.

6/28/10 I made this by the recipe and it was very good. I like my vegetables a little more tender than crisp, so the cooking time was perfect for me. Lightly seasoned w/ no heavy vinegar taste at all. Next time I might try it with a little garlic and some fresh mushrooms.
4/21/16 I omit the salt, because it is not needed. We love this as a side to grilled dishes in the Summer.

This was really good!  I used baby carrots and apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic b/c it was all I had on hand, it gave it a little zing I think.  I also added garlic like the other reviews suggested.  Would def enjoy this again.

With the addition of a large clove of minced garlic as well as a pat of butter in the oil, this was an excellent and easy side dish.  Great flavors, nice texture, and a low-maintenance vegetable side dish that will be in the regular rotation at our house!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I use Mrs.Dash Italian Medley for mt Italian seasoning- and I don't even think it needs as much salt as it says, maybe just a tiny pinch. I did use sea salt though.

This wasn't my favorite zucchini side dish, not sure what turned me off about it, but still easy to throw together.

This was very good especially since i love me some veggies and always have a hard time finding a good side dish. This is a new favorite. I cooked the carrots a little longer because they were still very firm, then at the end i added a little salt and my favorite seasoning mix, Spike.
