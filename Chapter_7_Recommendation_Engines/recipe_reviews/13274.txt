Considering how easy this was, this wasn't bad.  I omitted the kosher salt, and added five chipotle peppers total.  I like my chili spicy!  :-)  I used this recipe to make Frito Pie (basically chili with Fritos and Cheddar cheese), and it worked just fine.  However, it left me wanting some more ingredients...perhaps different kinds of beans?  If I ever need chili on short notice, I'll probably make this again; otherwise, I think I'll spend my time making something a little more satisfying.

This was pretty good - but it needed a little help.  I added a second can of tomatoes, some fresh cilantro and a can of beer.  I think it would have lacked flavor otherwisde.  The chipotles add a bit of heat, so be prepared.

With only the one can of tomatoes, it was more like a casserole than a chili, so I added one can of tomato sauce and a half a can of water. Make sure you let it simmer at least 30-45 minutes- the flavors are so much better after it simmers! A three as written, a five with adjustments, hence the four stars.

Loved this recipes.  Substituted black beans for kidney beans, added handful of chopped fresh cilantro and squeezed a lime into the mix after it had cooked 15 minutes.  Added 1 cup of corn and this was gobbled up by everyone.  Used 2 chipotle peppers as three was just too hot for this Canadian girl.

This recipe is wonderful to start with and shake it up a bit according to your mood. I like to add grated zucchini or spinach to add some veggie goodness!

Each time I try to make chili, it always come out bland.  But when I saw this recipe, I did not know what to expect.  After making this recipe, it was a hit.  The chili was tastful and had a kick due the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Next time I would use beef.  I believe the beef will add more flavor.

I used 2 chipotles & added a fresh jalapeno & fresh garlic while browning the beef.  Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes & a can of tomato paste, 1 tsp. salt, & about 1 cup of coffee.  (I like my chili a little soupier.)  It was so easy & turned out delicious!  My husband raved about it!

I suppose a lot of people choose this recipe for the quickness of it but chili is always better and tastier when it cooks long and slow, so I put my in the slow cooker all day.  I also made a few changes based upon what I had on hand/other reviewer suggestions.  Used 1.5lbs beef, substituted onion powder, reduced salt/cumin to 1 teaspoon each and upped the chili powder to 2 TABLESPOONS and the tomatoes to 2 cans.  Omitted the hot sauce and removed the seeds from the chipotles so it that it had the smokey flavor without all the heat.  With my changes I would make this again and again :)

Made with ground turkey- threw it all in the crock pot before I left for work this morning.  I added a 1/2 jar of chipotle salsa because I wanted more tomato-y flavor.  This was GOOOOD!  I used 1 can kidney beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans b/c it's what I had in the pantry.

This didn't taste like any kind of "chili" I've ever had. I'm not sure what I would call it, I just know it's a HOT type of hamburger dish. Maybe the cheese will help it. :(

I make this often.  It has the perfect mix of spices.  Sometimes I make it with ground turkey.  All the spices makes up for the no flavor/healthier turkey meat.

Fast and easy. Was too spicy for little ones but hubby and I ate it. Used only 1 can of beans & no hot sauce - personal preferences.

Recipe was good, but I sauted onion and added green peppers and diced garlic. Added extra can of tomatoes, and tomatoe paste. My girlfriend doesn't do beans so I left those out and just added more ground turkey. Made Goya spanish rice and poured over that with the cheese and a dollop of sour cream um um good and quick

It was efficient. Definitely needed some more seasoning. I threw in more chili powder, cayenne pepper powder, fresh cilantro,  fresh habaneros and jalapenos, and topped it off with  shredded cheese, crema, and cubes of avocado. I also didn't really drain the meat because it would have been dry if I followed the recipe.

Great base recipe. I added a can of tomato sauce and used a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (that i diced). Added 2 cloves of minced garlic, used 3 peppers and four tablespoons of adobo sauce. Nice level of heat! Will make again.
