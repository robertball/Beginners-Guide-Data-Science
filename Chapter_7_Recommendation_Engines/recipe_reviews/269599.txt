Made as written and while these were not bad, they were not great either. They are quite expensive to make and a lot of fuss. With that being said, they walnuts gave the olives a nice crunch that held up well but the flavor gets completely lost. All you can  taste is the green olive. I could have saved myself a lot of time and money by just popping the top off the olives and eating them straight out of the jar.
