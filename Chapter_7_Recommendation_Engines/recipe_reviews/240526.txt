I made this for a family holiday gathering. Wow. We all took our first sips & immediately ran out to buy the goods for a round two! This may have been a mistake, because we all almost forgot about dinner. It is very light and too refreshing. I made an ice mold with fresh cranberries and orange slices with a few rosemary sprigs for green. As it melted the cranberries were a fun pop of sour in our glasses.

Everyone enjoyed this punch!!  I had the cocktail part of a progressive dinner and had these. Simple to make ahead then quickly add champagne and soda right before guests arrived. Very festive look and a good little kick to it. I had 17 guests and was enough for everyoneâ€” as a drink or two prior to going to another house for dinner.
