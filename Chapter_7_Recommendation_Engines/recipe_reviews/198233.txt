I grew up on a variation of this - we called it Rum Tum Ditty :) My mother said her mother served it  during the Great Depression in the 20s! We substituted grated chedder for the american,  added a dash of Worcestshire Sauce and eliminated everthing else but the soup and milk... Still a rainy day comfort food in my family.

It was alright. Wasn't really for my taste. But,  my husband really liked it and said it would be great with crayfish or lobster.

Gosh this was good.. No it is not gourmet faire, but eating it really gave me some childhood like comfort. I really cannot remember ever eating this, but I must have at some point to get that sort of feeling from it.  I will make it again. that's for sure
