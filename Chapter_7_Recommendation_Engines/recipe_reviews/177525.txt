I made this chili for the first time and it was great, very filling. I made one change to the recipe though, I used a can of Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes and the flavor really came through. I will make this again.

I made this recipe without making any changes to it.  It was so quick and easy to throw together, that I had it in my slow cooker in no time at all.  After simmering for 8 hours, the end result was a thick and hearty chili that completely satisfied my appetite.  The only flaw I found was that the chili turned out to be a bit on the bland side.  The generous amount of chili powder certainly puts some zing into this dish, but, that alone, isn't enough to label this chili as "flavorful".  All in all, this recipe is worth making again.  Next time, however, I'll cut back a bit on the chili powder and just add some sweet peppers to flavor things up a tad.

I generally LIKE my chili a bit on the mild side, but this recipe was a bit too bland, even for me.  It was edible, but it definitely needed crackers, fritos, cheese... something to give it a boost of flavor.  And the flavor of cumin was so strong, even mixed in with all the other ingredients.  I'm generally not a huge fan of that spice, so next time I make chili I'll cut the cumin in half or omit altogether.  In order to "save" the rest of the batch, I added a small can of tomato sauce, a red pepper, some more garlic, and a little basil.  That seemed to give it a kick.  Now I'll more than likely eat the rest of it.  Whereas before, I most likely would've thrown it out or let it go bad.  I give it 3 stars because like I said, it was edible.  I could've eaten it even without any crackers, but boy it would've been bland.  And by the way - you're better off just using plain old tomato sauce, through and through.  It's more flavorful than the soup.  Campbell's just wants to put their name behind a chili recipe to get people to buy their soup, that's all.  (haha)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did modify it by replacing one of the cans of kidney beans with black beans.  We just like black beans better.  I did also throw a little salsa in the crock pot as well.  This is a keeper!

Definitely needed more flavour. The heat was there, and you can't go wrong with the base ingredients, but when the pot was opened, it was all fire and no flavour.

I tried this recipe and after 8-hours of slow cooking it was definitely thick and heart.  I thought is was delicious.  I added corn and smoked salt to mine which really made it tasty.  The next time I will add less chili powder to it. YUM!

This has got to be the best chili I have ever made.  I like to put a big spoonful of sour cream in it also and it makes it that much better!

This is a great basic recipe.  To "bump up" the flavor a good bit, I always brown the meat over high heat to develop a nice flavorful crust before stirring it.  This adds the "roasted-beefy" flavor missing when ground beef is overstirred, cooling the pan down and ends up just "poaching" or steaming in its own juices as it changes color to grey instead of actually "browning".  I also added a large chopped green pepper,  a TBSP of paprika, a tsp each of salt and black pepper and 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  I use chicken or beef stock instead of water and don't drain and rinse the kidney beans.  There is lots of good flavor in there that shouldn't be just washed away. I think most of the "bland" comments are primarily due too little salt.  A beef bullion cube could also perk up the dish in place of the tsp of salt.

I've been using this recipe for years as my quick and easy basic chili recipe. The Campbell's tomato soup adds a nice sweetness to the chili. I've never cooked this chili in a slow cooker, but it comes out just as good after simmering on the stovetop for an hour or so. I also add 1 large chopped green pepper, black pepper, and salt to taste. I'm surprised salt and pepper weren't included in the ingredients because it definitely needs it.

This was totally excellent. I didn't find anything wrong with the mix of ingredients at all. What I did find was and I'm mad at myself for grabbing one can wrong from the store...why I didn't check the can 1st is beyond me, but when I got home I had one can of kidney beans and one can of pintos...I still added both because it's what I had...but regardless...it was still pretty good. I wouldn't change anything. The flavors were really good. Not over poweringly hot or mild. It was quite nice for my kids to eat. I'd totally make this again.

This chili is Amazing! Yum! Very simple to make. I added a few things to spice it up, 1 garden salsa pepper, and a red pepper. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies as well. Will make this recipe over and over!

This is a very good recipe!  Nice and thick!  For those complaining about it being bland try using diced tomatoes with green chilies.  It adds the zip you're looking for. This is now my favorite chili recipe!!!

This is a great recipe!  I am a picky eater and even more picky about chili but this is fantastic.  I added more chili powder and I added black pepper b/c I like food a little more spicey.

I halved the chili powder and it was still too hot!  Will make again and reduce even more.  I added red lentils, green capsicum, carrot, and corn for added benefits and fiber and froze most of this for an easy lunch.  This soup freezes very well.

Very yummy!  I did 2lbs of beef and added extra cayenne pepper, a dash of cinnamon, and a little sea salt.  You really do have to let it cook the full 8 hours on the low setting in order for it to get nice and thick and tasty.

The name of this recipe describes it perfectly - definitely hearty, beefy and beany!  If you like your chili this way, you'll like this recipe.  I did add a bit of cayenne pepper to it to kick up the spice a little bit.  Served with salad and Sweet Corn Bread (from this site).

Great easy chili to throw in the crock pot!  Instead of the water I used beef broth.  I topped this with cheese and cilantro.  Very good!

I really love this recipe! My fiancé and I have it at least twice a month! The only change I made to the recipe is I add 2 pounds of ground beef. I also mix corn starch and water together and add it to the chili about a half hour before serving this really helps thicken the chili! Great recipe will use for years to come!

Awesome Chili! I just threw in a half red pepper chopped and a little (1/4 tsp) paprika to liven it up.

well i halved this recipe to fit a 1 1/2 qt slow cooker. I cooked this on low for the time stated and it was burnt around the sides. It does need a lot more spices for my taste my bf thought it was good. It tasted a whole lot better the next day.

This was the best chili I have ever made!!  I followed the recipe and changed this: 1 can kidney beans and one hot chili beans, added some chopped roasted red peppers and added some brown sugar.  This was amazing, thank you for sharing.  This is my new chili recipe :)

Very easy and tasty.
I made a few adjustments  - omitted the soup, water and cumin. I added 2 cups of tomato sauce and the chili was hearty and very tasty. Served it with some cornbread and a salad for a nice winter dinner.

I made this for a Christmas party.  Very easy, I just threw together all of the ingreadents and 8 hours later it was done!  I didn't get a chance to try it since it was all eaten before I had a chance to eat.  I just added a little red pepper flakes.  Rave reviews from all guests.

I made this chili for myself & my husband. I made just a few changes. I only added 1 can kidney beans and since I didn't have just can diced tomatoes so I added mexican stewed tomatoes. I had not added cumin to chili before this recipe and I was a little concerned but we liked the flavor. I will make this again but maybe next time add deer meat instead of ground beef, or both.

Best EASY chili ever!  You can add anything to it or make it as it is.  It's a good base for chili.  The first time I made it as is and the family loved it.  I have since made it adding different peppers, different seasoning and it is great every time.

This is really good.  Used ground turkey, and I didn't have any chili powder so I used the red pepper that I had.  Is 1/4 cup the right amount?  I didn't use that much of the red pepper and it was plenty hot (I know red pepper is stronger than chili powder).  It is a little soupy so next time I might use 2 tomato soup and no can tomato.

Found this recipe a bit bland on its own. With a few changes, it got rave reviews. Substitutions include:  -Using a can of Campbell's Tomato Soup with Basil and Oregano, rather than the original.  -When adding diced tomatoes, I used Aylmer's Accents Chili Stewed Tomatoes.  -When adding Kidney Beans, I used Heinz Chili Style Kidney Beans.  All of this together, plus the ingredients listed here, makes for an amazing chili. You really need the extra spices in the beans, tomatoes and soup - though you might also be able to add spices from your kitchen to help it along.   With these additions, it's become a regular item in our kitchen!

I have been making this recipe for awhile now but I cook it stovetop instead of in the crock pot--usually takes about 30 minutes from start to finish.  After making endless chili recipes this one became my go-to recipe.  We are not a household who likes terribly spicy chili, so this is perfect for us--and you can always add more spice if you prefer.  On a side note: I have made with and without beans, less and more beef (ground turkey or chicken), with and without diced tomatoes.   I've even made it with black beans when i wanted beans and didn't have others on hand, and I've added macaroni to make it a chili mac... It's been a good recipe regardless of what I've done to it.  When I have all ingredients on hand, I make recipe as stated.  It's a heartier chili, not a soupy chili.  But...Campbell's tomato soup gives a better flavor to the chili than the generic brands do I have learned, so I wouldn't use a generic brand soup with this recipe.  Enjoy!!

This recipe was really easy to follow (minus my tearing eyes when cutting the onions!) and the results were well worth it. I didn't have any chili powder, but did have some taco seasoning on hand so I subbed it in. It really gave the chili a nice southwestern kick! I would make this again and I saved it in my recipe box.

This was the best chili we ever had! I made no changes except the diced tomatoes had chopped chili's in them.  I agree, cook it for the entire time to enjoy all the flavors.

Five stars with these modifications: I added a cup of frozen corn and next time I will add some chopped green pepper and some cayenne pepper seasoning.  Great base recipe for beginning cooks!

I first started making this chili when I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and had to keep my meals within a certain carb/fiber range.  It was the first meal that left me feeling genuinely satisfied.  It is absolutely delicious!  Even now that I no longer have GD, this chili has a regular spot in our meal rotation.  It has also been a HUGE hit with my husband and his Army buddies and my chili-fanatic dad.  It's delicious and SUPER EASY to make.  Plus, you can adjust the amounts of cumin and chili powder to fit your personal tastes.  I wish I could give it ten stars!

This is so good and so easy!  I made the original version a couple of months ago and made "my" version last night.  I used 1 lb. ground turkey, 1 c. frozen diced onion, 1 can kidney beans, 1 can pinto beans, and followed everything else.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Great chili if you make a few small changes.  Half of the chili powder is all you need.  I leave out the water and add more diced or crushed tomatoes.  I also like to add half of a jalapeno for flavor and 2 tbls white sugar.

Excellent chili!  I prefer mine to be spicier so chances are I'll turn up the heat next time, but in terms of cost and resulting quality, it doesn't get much better than this (not to mention how easy it is to make with the crock pot)

This chili is the best. It is just spicy enough to let you know it's there, but not too hot that you're drinking water between every bite. That let's the other subtleties of the seasonings shine as well.
I used ground turkey instead of beef and tasted great!
Blessings,
Dave

I thought this recipe was excellent but it could have used maybe 2 lbs. of beef instead of 1 1/2 lbs for six servings

loved it. I made two portions and ate both in one go (probably because I waited so long for the meal! I doubles the chili as usual because most recipes are too bland, doubled the garlic as well. Not having any tomato soup i added ketchup made using a recipe found at allrecipes. Great!

It came out with too much liquid, more like soup, so next time I will omit the water.  Either that or drain the beans, there wasn't any mention to do that, but I'm thinking its necessary.  I added a can of diced chilis and I think that added a bit of flavor that others found was lacking.

I used a spanish type chili powder and the chili came out too spicey. I added more meat and served it with shredded cheese and a dolip of sour cream. My boyfriend loved it!

I'm kinda new to cooking in general. Just bought a crock pot. And i was told to check out this site by my mom. She told me about this recipe and I decided to try it out. Great recipe!! I followed the directions and it came out great. Will definitely make this chili again.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is a favorite.  I usually double it and put it in my 6 quart crockpot so I can freeze some for a day when i don't feel like cooking.

This is crazy good and so easy to make! Even hubby loves it! We eat it with Tortilla chips. Total A+ from me! A few things: 
     I don't know why you need to brown the beef first. Maybe to drain the oil? I did make it one time without browning first (just chucked the raw in the crockpot because I was lazy) and you did see more oil on the top when it was done but once mixed you'd never know and it did add more flavor too. So I like it better this way. But it helps that I use extra lean beef I suppose as well.
      I do add a bit more tomatoes than the recipe says. I use one of the bigger cans (24oz?) rather than the 15oz can. 
     I also use only 1lb of beef, mostly because the beef I like only comes in 1lb bricks and I hate having to open a full pack for just the 1/2 pound. Plus I like my chili more "beany" anyway ;) 

Other than those small things, I make everything else according to the recipe.

Tip: the longer you let it sit/cook (i.e. on low for 8-9 hours instead of high for 4-5) the more flavor it has. Even eating 2 days later tasted better than the first day. Really yummy stuff!

Great starter recipe.  Very mild flavor though.  Next time I will add peppers and other spices to give it a little more of a bite.

We loved it! I thought it was a simple chili to make and it tasted just as good as the others I've labored over. I'll make it again soon.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times and it comes out excellent every time. If it seems un-spicy or bland, just add a few drops of ghost pepper sauce. It's wicked hot so only maybe 10 drops to the whole crock pot. Also the most recent time I made it, it was a bit soupy so I threw in a handful of cornstarch and it thickened to a better consistency. Also it only feeds 3-4 hungry people, not 6.

Super cheap, quick, and easy to make.  I sauté my meat, drain, and then place meat and all ingredients in a cast iron skillet, cover, and simmer for about an hour.  Tastes wonderful!  Receive many positive compliments on this.

excellent base recipe!  I made this today for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  I do not like to much spice, so I used 3 TBSP or chili powder, 1T basil, 1T oregano 1 bell pepper, 1 heaping T of brown sugar and left out the cumin.

I was just not impressed with this recipe, but I can see how others would love it. I took the advice of all the reviewers and I still ended with the common problems that this dish has presented for others. It was very watery although I chose not to add 1/2 cup of water. It still struggled with flavor despite me adding taco seasoning, tbsp. of salsa, salt and pepper, brown sugar, paprika, red pepper flakes, and basil. It does help to reduce the amount of chili powder otherwise it would have been way too spicy for my family's liking. I don't think that I will try this recipe again, but if I did I would drop the cumin from the recipe. I would also drain the diced tomatoes. Even though I drained my beans I think the tomatoes added a lot of water that made the dish take a wrong turn. My chili was very watery.

This was an excellent recipe. Make it as requested the first time, try it. And then you will be able to determine what else u can use or subtitute to make your very own "famous chilli".

The real test of this recipe wasnt my tastebuds, or even my husbands but the rave reviews my children gave it. They dont like beans at all, so having them love this chili recipe is a major milestone. They like it best served with shredded cheddar cheese and crackers and I better be sure to save some for chili dogs the next night! Hehe. I of course agree with them, its very good and filling and not too much fuss to make as its written, however, I did make one tiny change. I used my own homemade pinto beans instead of kidney beans.
