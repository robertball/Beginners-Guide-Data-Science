These are awesome! After reading other reviews on messy prep, I finely chopped the pepperoni in the food processor, pulsed in the cheese and a little sauce then spread it over the dough. I used toothpicks soaked in water for 15 minutes (so they don't burn) to secure the logs, popped them in the freezer for 20 minutes then sliced with a very sharp knife. I bake them on their sides on sheets coated with a little cooking spray and ooze was minimal. A snap, and you can make an industrial sized amount in a very short amount of time. The toothpicks worked out great, and made a little handle for dipping. Also fantastic using thinly sliced ham and cheese with a honey mustard dipping sauce, or taco meat and cheddar! Perfect to do and freeze ahead to pop a handful into the toaster oven for late night munchies.

I made a few additions to this recipe and it was fantastic!  I diced up pepperoni in some, and added crumbled, cooked sausage to others.  After adding cheese and filling, i seaseoned with italian seasoning and grated romano cheese.  I rolled and added more grated cheese to the outside along with garlic and herb seasoning.  I refrigerated overnight, cut and baked the next day.  Served with homemade marinara...realy impressive!

These were fabuous and not hard to make at all when you know how to do it. The first time I tried to work with crescent dough, I cried because it turned out so horrible, but just put the can in the freezer for 15-20 minutes before you work with it and work quickly, and it will turn out fine. I also cut them up beforehand and chilled them for awhile as suggested. They turned out perfectly! I would definitely suggest the marinara or pizza sauce to dip in--it makes it that much better!

This recipe was fantastic!  I made one minor change to the recipe.  Once I rolled and before I cut I sprayed a little butter on top of each and sprinkled with ground oregano.  Nothing heavy, just a touch and they came out PERFECT!  Melts in your mouth.  In fact, the first time I made them the smell alone lured everyone to the kitchen and they never even made it to the table!  

I found that putting the cheese down then the pepperoni on top and leaving about a 1/2 inch without anything helped when rolling.  The pepperonis on top kept the cheese at bay and the extra space allowed everything to squish forward a bit without leaving excess gushing out the end of the roll.  

Also, the logs themselves freeze just fine, so you can make ahead, then pop out to thaw, slice and cook for a VERY quick and easy appetizer!  

Love this recipe!

This is a good make ahead recipe.  Chilling the dough after adding the sauce and toppings for a while makes the dough easier to roll up.  You can then freeze it and slice it frozen to maintain the shape, just as you would a pinwheel cookie.
The prepared dough can be frozen away as a log or slices for use at a later date.  You don't even have to thaw the slices as they will heat up quickly.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe!! I use the garlic flavored cresent rolls and add some pizza seasoning.  I also use turkey pepperoni and they still taste awesome.  The key is - after you roll them, freeze them for a bit (I freeze one roll while working on another) before slicing. This makes slicing them super quick and easy!  I make a ton at a time, slice and freeze them and then just pull them out whenever we have unexpected company. I slice them very thin (about 8 pieces per roll)  and bake them on a pizza stone... easy and fantastic.  I serve them with pizza sauce and ranch dressing and they always go fast!

made these the other day, what a hit!! I added the pizza sauce inside the pinwheels, one recommendation though, glaze the pinwheels with an egg wash prior to baking.  It makes them golden and glossy.

I used to make completely "homemade" appetizers.  Now everybody asks me to bring these (much easier!).  If the group is more adults than kids, I will use half mozzarella and half pepper jack, which can be too spicy for little kids.  
Tip: I chop the pepperoni up in the food processor and mix it with the cheese, makes it easier to slice the rolls.  Also, DOUBLE it, they go fast!!

These were really delicious!  I made them as an appetizer.  I used the reduced fat Crescent Rolls and used half mozzarella and half pepperjack cheese. I'm vegetarian, so I omitted the pepperoni and added diced onions and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I also prepared the rolls the day before I needed them and and froze the logs.  When I was ready to bake them, I cut each log in half and baked.  Next time, I will cut each log in half when I prepare them and pinch the open sides closed, so that cheese doesn't run out when baking.  I served them with marinara sauce and they were a big hit!  When I make them again, I will try to stuff more fillings in them because the rolls puff up when baked and the fillings remain in the bottom half.  But, nonetheless, I will definitely be making them again.  Thanks! :-)

This was a fun recipe... my 3 yr. old son loves it. Only, he's using ranch dressing! It's exactly what I was craving (pregnant).

This recipe was EASY. Detailed, perhaps, but it only took me an hour from grating the cheese to taking it out of the oven.

Having made other pinwheel recipes, I did the following differently: first, I did my assembly on a flour dusted plastic cutting mat. I used a bit of water on my fingertip to seal perforation on the rectangles and the closing "lip" of the rolls. I used a sharp, non-serrated knife with a thin blade that I wiped clean after EVERY cut. And, I used cooking spray.

I will make this again. Thank you for a good recipe.

Amazing, my husband begs for these.  I follow the reviews.  Combined this is what I do: Sprinkle counter with parmesan cheese and italian seasoning. Put rectangles of crescent rolls (after they've been in freezer for a short bit) on counter where you put seasonings, use a roller to roll out pressing dough into seasoning.  Turn over, roll other side.  In food processor, dump pepperoni, cheese and a little sauce and italian seasoning and chop to edible texture.   Spread onto rectangles, roll up, put in fridge on a plate for minimum of 20 minutes or in freezer for 10.   We like them cut so stuffing faces sideways, but it doesn't matter.  Getting them good and cold before hand keeps the stuffing in.   Then you slice and bake.  We don't like sauce so we just eat!  Wa-La!

Honestly, I was expecting these to be good, but not great. They really were fabulous! I followed advice from other reviewers and blended the cheese, pepperoni and sauce in a food processor. I also only split the dough into two rectangles. I sprinkled some seasonings (oregano, basil, garlic, onion powder) on the baking sheet before laying down the dough. Once rolled, I stuck the rolls in the freezer for about 1/2 hour and they cut extremely easily. I just wish I had sprayed the baking sheet with pam first because they tended to stick to the sheet. That's totally my own fault though. Seriously though, these are worth a try!

These were pretty good.  I didn't use pepperoni b/c the kids don't like.  I also used refrigerated pizza dough in the tube.  Freezing works great but cook a little longer to compensate

These were good, but should DEFINITELY be made exactly according to the recipe!  Based on some reviews, I tried putting sauce inside the rolls, and it was a mess.  Not only did it become extremely hard to roll them, but all the cheese and meat slipped out during baking or eating, and they didn't freeze well with the sauce inside.  

I made the second batch according to the recipe and they were much easier to make, freeze, and eat... plus they were tastier!  Not a 5 star app but a decent easy-to-make finger food.  Very versatile too- I made some with ham and cheddar that were honestly better than the pizza ones, and I'm sure I'll use this recipe for more flavor combos in the future.

Tips:  Marinara or ranch are great dipping sauces.  One 24oz package of pepperoni allowed me to make 4 cans of crescents.  The thicker they are cut after you roll them, the better they are.  If you cut them too thin, all of the filling will ooze out when you bake them and you'll be left with nothing but a mess.  And using the seamless pillsbury recipe creations sheets (cut into 4 rectangles) worked really well.

These were actually very easy.  I was worried after reading the reviews about laying them flat on the baking sheet so I only did a few that way at first.  They were perfect, the cheese did not leak out at all and I did not need toothpicks.  I used a combo of peperoni and chopped ham, I liked the chopped ham the best.

This is a great recipe for a dish to take to a party or playdate!  I did spread a thin layer of pizza sauce on the dough (get the Pillsbury Recipe Creations dough, it'll make your life easier!) before adding the cheese and pepperoni.  When serving to little kids, this is a much neater way to incorporate the sauce.    I also think it is imperative to put the unsliced rolls in the freezer for AT LEAST an hour.  Freezing them makes it so much easier to slice.

We really liked these!  I didn't have crescent roll dough so I made a batch of my own easy 1/2-whole wheat pizza dough, divided it into three 6-by-12 inch rectangles, and went from there.  I topped them with a scant amount of pizza sauce, a dusting of garlic powder, a sprinkle of grated parmesan (just the Kraft kind), a thin layer of shredded mozzarella, and a thin layer of chopped pepperoni.  Don't overfill!  I rolled them up tightly and refrigerated for an hour or so before cutting and cooking at 400 for 12 minutes.

I recommend you lay these on the flat while cooking (as one reviewer suggested) to avoid the cheese oozing out.  Mine puffed up beautifully and were really attractive.  They were a HUGE hit with my kids, my husband, and the kids/adults at the get-together we went to.  I did not find mine to be messy at all, in fact, will make these again just to have *less* messy pizza nights for my 2- and 4-YOs and myself/DH.  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

These were good but they are messy and clumsy to make.  The prep deserves 4 stars, but the taste deserves 5.  After trying the first time, I ended up just using mini muffin pans sprayed with olive oil non-stick spray.  I put pieces of the dough into each of the holes and then followed with the sauce and cheese. Instead of "pizza pinwheels" I ended up having "pizza bites"!

*These turned out great! To make it less calories and fat I used reduced fat crescent rolls, low fat mozzarella cheese, turkey pepperoni, and I added some italian spices to boost the flavor! Even though it was low fat, it was still delicious! They were so yummy, I will be making again for an upcoming party!

I made my own homemade pizza sauce and I chopped the pepperoni and folded it into the pizza sauce before I spread it onto the crescent roll dough. These were inhaled.

everybody loved these when i made them for our potluck.  One of the first things to go.  Next time I'll use marinara sauce and oregano like other reviewers have suggested as I felt it needed just a little something more.  Great quick recipe!

I have made these three times in the last two weeks!  I put a light coating of pizza sauce on the dough before I add the finely chopped pepperoni and shredded mozzarella cheese.  What a great light appetizer and a big hit with the both the young and old!

These were a big hit with my family. Next time I will double the amount of pepperoni and half the amount of cheese.
I had successes with freezing the logs for 10 mins. then cutting them. And I placed a pepperoni on the bottom of each pinwheel before baking on a lightly grease baking sheet.

These were much better than I thought they'd be. I used all organic ingredients (besides the rolls) and turkey pepperoni instead of regular. I also added in red pepper flakes to the rolls for a little zing!  Along with a salad, this made a great dinner for 2!

very good, I used a little pizza sauce on the dough before putting on the cheese, and then sprinkled italian seasoning on top of the cheese. Rolled in saran and froze before slicing.  Sprayed the pan w/ cooking spray, and it didn't ooze out or make a mess at all!  I will be making again.

I made these tonight and was so glad for the recommendation to freeze before cutting, it was great!  I used sauce that already had meat in it and mushrooms, just pureed it so the kids would eat it.  I don't recommend this it was messy.  I think next time, and there will be a next time, I will do ham and mozzarella, and maybe pineapple!

This is a great recipe.  I made one  modification though.  Instead of having the sauce for dipping I spread some sauce on befor I put in the pepperoni.  I did this because my kids are 2 and 4 and really don't get the concept of dipping and I thought this way might be less of a mess.  Great recipe!

I've made this like 5 times for parties/pot luck. Always a hit. I do brush the roll with a mixture of butter, garlic and oregano before spread the cheese and peperoni.

It was the only food completely eaten at a girls party! Used the New Garlic Butter Crescent Rolls- YUMM. I think sliced mozerella cheese would make for a cleaner cut but shredded worked great. Made them 2 days before, froze them, and then sliced them right before the party and baked! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Made these today for my daycare kids - they thought they were great. Going to have to double the recipe next time though. I warmed up the remainder of the pizza sauce and they were dipping the pinwheels in it.

Made these for my niece and nephews one Friday night. They loved them, made one batch with pizza sauce, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese and another batch with ham, cheddar, and just brushed olive oil and sprinkles garlic salt on the dough before rolling. There are so many flavors you could do for a party, separate batches.

I liked the idea of it, but for some reason the crescent dough does not want to cooperate with me.  The portions were not enough for my family of 4, so we ended up having to reheat last nights left overs as well.

these were easy and delicious.  I spread sauce on the crescent rolls, but will probably take other reviewer's suggestions and process the sauce, pepperoni and cheese together as a spread to make them easier to roll.  I also put the stuffed crescent rolls in the freezer before I cut them.  I was going to send them for lunch at school, but my husband ate them all!  Thanks for sharing!

As another reviewer suggested I pulsed the cheese, pepperoni and sauce in my food processore to make a spread. I made two batches... one wifth turkey pepperoni and one with deli ham (one guest didn't care for pepperoni)... The ham was a flop and the pepperoni hater actually loved the pinwheels with the turkey pepperoni. It was perfect because it wasn't too greasy!

I followed suggestions to freeze dough.  These turned out pretty but we didn't like the crescent dough taste as much.  May be better with biscuit dough.  Will try again.

This is a great snack or appetizer! The first time I made this I chopped up the pepperoni but the last time I made this I was lucky enough to have found mini-pepperoni in Costco so I used them.  Great time saver if you can find them.  Also, I roll them in Press & Seal then put them in the freezer.  Then, whenever we want a snack I just take them out, cut them up & pop them in the oven.  Much cheaper than buying mini-pizza rolls at the store!

I made these for my boys birthday party and they are the perfect teenage snack.  They all loved them.  The key is rolling them snuggly and refrigerating them to make cutting easier.  I assembled the rolls the night before, wrapped each roll in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge overnight.  I sprinkled a bit of parmesan on each slice before baking on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.  Big hit!

These were really good! And so simple to make! We ate these as a main dish not as an appetizer and they were so filling. I don't understand why so many people said they were messy and I didn't have a problem cutting them at all. I didn't even need to refrigerate! I used fresh pepperoni salami and loved every bite of these! We used Pizza Sauce as well as Ranch Dressing for dipping. Really really yummy!
Note: I think that rolling these in grated Parmesan Cheese might be good too.

This is my new favorite appetizer.  It was so easy.  I took the can of dough and rolled it into a long rectangle with a rolling pin to get rid of creases, then put toppings in the middle and rolled up legnthwise.  I was taking it to someone else's house and wanted it to stay hot so I kept it in the "log" shape until we got there and then cut it into slices.  I also added a little bit of sauce to the inside as some others suggested.  It was sooooooo good.  Thanks

I use 2 cups pepperoni (chopped thick), 2 cups mozzarella cheese, one beaten egg, and some oregano as my filling.  Roll and slice as the recipe says and bake for 12-14 minutes until golden.  They may be a bit messy to slice, but when the baking is done, everything comes together for a scrumptious appetizer!

easy and quick! i used pillsbury breadsticks instead, because that's what i had. it tasted fine (less buttery than the crescent rolls are). i added italian seasonings and garlic powder before i rolled them up, then put some grated parmesan over the tops after they came out of the oven.

These were pretty good. I used ham instead of pepperoni and spread a thin layer of sauce on the dough before putting on the meat and cheese. They were too soft to cut into pieces after rolling so I left them as "logs" and closed up the ends so the sauce and cheese would not spill out the sides.

These were pretty good, much better when served warm. They were very easy to make. I will make again when I need a quick easy appetizer.

This is a fun and easy recipe that I have used often.  I did make two changes.  One is I brush egg whites on top to help them brown evenly.  Two, I sprinkled italian seasoning over the roll.  Also, I sometimes do not cut them into pinwheels.  My children will eat them whole.

These were very basic, but good!  I will make them again sometime and maybe add in some Italian seasonings or a different kind of sauce to jazz it up.  Might be nice to also experiment with other pizza toppings!

Delicious. I followed the post directing me to mix the pepperoni and cheese with sauce before spreading that mix onto the dough. I also chilled it a while before rolling the dough into pinwheels. I made this for a kids party but it was a BIG hit with all ages.

I made these for a Poker night and was worried I had made too many (about 30 from 2 canned crescent rolls) but they were gone 3 rounds later!! I thought they were kind of a pain in the butt to slice only because I didn't have enough time to leave them in the refrigerator longer. When rolling them together, I highly recommend not stretching the dough too much and make sure to roll them tightly or they'll blossom (outside dough will sag out) when baking. All in all, the boys didn't care what they looked like and wanted more. Oh and didn't need the marinara/pizza sauce to dip with- I just put a little in the pizza rolls when I was putting them together.

These were very good.  I didn't have a problem with the dough at all.  I made them on a cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray and they didn't stick at all.  After making them according to the directions, my husband and I got brave and spread a thin layer of pizza sauce on the dough, added a little oregano, really piled on the pepperoni, and then added the cheese.  They were more difficult to cut, but the best batch yet.

These were very yummy but very time consuming. I had to leave them in the triangle shape and roll them instead or trying to get a rectangle shape with the crescent rolls..much easier this way than tearing all the crescents apart by trying to re-shape them.

Followed the ingredient list exactly, put the pepperoni and cheese on the crescent roll dough, then put it in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes- it makes it SO much easier to roll and to cut. Pulled out the cookie sheet, and cut each rectangle into just 2 pieces, stuck a water-soaked toothpick through each, to help hold it together, and cooked them. Turned out delicious! Kind of a mess, the cheese falls out before baking it, and tends to bubble out in the oven. A bit of a clean-up but a great taste so definitely worth it!

Made these for a party, with a few minor changes.  I diced the pepperoni, and mixed it with the cheese in a bowl prior to assembling, rather than use the layering technique.  I also added some Italian seasoning and oregano to the mix.  Yum!  The biggest change was that I used pizza dough instead of crescent rolls.  I made a batch using the crescent rolls, and even using the suggestion already posted (putting the cans in the freezer for a bit, etc.) I just did not have the patience for working with those dang things!!  Just totally frustrating.  I also didn't really like the taste of the crescent roll batch, but that's just my personal preference.  So I used the pizza dough that comes in a can just like the crescent rolls, and it worked like a charm.  Laid it out on a pre-sprayed cookie sheet, put the mixture down the middle, and rolled the two long sides in like a log.  I used the edge of a metal spatula to cut into bite sized pieces across the width, and then lengthwise.  I found that using the edge of the spatula didn't cause the dough to 'drag' like a knife does.  I also used the tip someone had posted about inserting toothpicks into the pieces before baking.  Turned out perfect!!

I am so happy I found this recipe!  Freezing canned rolls for 15 mintues prior does help!  THanks reviewers...we used chopped turkey deli meat instead of pepperoni.  Turned out great.

I served these at a party and received many compliments. Most people asked where I got them, not realizing I made them myself. I chopped the pepperoni with a couple cloves of fresh garlic then mixed it with some grated parmesan and the shredded mozzarella. I spread a very light coating of pizza sauce on the dough then spread the pepperoni/cheese mixture on top of the sauce. After rolling into logs I placed them in the freezer for about 10 minutes, which made them much easier to cut. I had some of the pepperoni mixture leftover so I sprinked it on top of the pinwheels before baking. These were pretty easy to make and quite delicious. I will make them again.

I liked the idea of this recipe but I got lazy and didn't cut the rolls before cooking them, I basically ate raw dough. You need to cut these. They make a great addition to a party platter, but may not be good for a well rounded dinner.

Very tasty! I followed the advice of another reviewer who froze the rolls for 15-20 minutes before slicing and baking. That was the key to holding these together! I also baked them in muffin tins, although I don't think it would've mattered either way. They are definitely better fresh out of the oven, but these got eaten after they had been sitting out for awhile too. A keeper!

I'm giving this 5 stars based on its appeal as a kids meal.  My 3 year old actually asked for more!  It's quick, it's easy, and she could help me make it.  I, also, need to practice my rolling and cutting technique.  I couldn't fit 2 cups of cheese onto these, but no biggie. 

****Just a comment on all the 'Messy' reviews - the pizza sauce isn't rolled up inside the dough roll - it's used for dipping AFTERWARDS.  As I tell the hubby, it's always important to read the instructions.****

This was very good, but I found it difficult to roll with all that cheese. I didn't even use the full 2 cups. I did sprinkle filling with italian herbs and some fresh sliced mushrooms.Was going to add some parmesan cheese but there was no room. I brushed some egg whites around edges to help seal and also over the top. Tucked ends under, then sprinkled with garlic salt and parmesan cheese. There was no way that these were going to slice easily so I left them as they were and we ate them like little calzones. They came out good. I think if I were to make as pinwheels, I would use chopped pepperoni,and a little less cheese for easier rolling. I think putting in the freezer is a good idea for easier slicing. I think they would be messy, we liked them whole. Thanks Christi!

I TOOK THESE TO GAME NIGHT AND THEY WERE GONE WITHIN MINUTES. I USED PIZZA DOUGH INSTEAD OF THE CRESCENT ROLLS. I ADDED A BIT OF ONION, SPRINKLED WITH PARMESAN CHEESE, GARLIC POWDER AND ITALIAN SEASONING. I TOOK OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTIONS TO BAKE AS LOGS AND THEN CUT WHEN BAKED. I WOULD SUGGEST TO DOUBLE OR EVEN TRIPLE THIS RECIPE IF YOU ARE TAKING IT TO A GATHERING.

This recipe is fantastic!  It had simple ingredients, was easy to prepare, and tasted so good.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I didn't use the meat mentioned in the recipe.  Instead I cut up and spread some onions and garlic and some mozzerella cheese.  Mmm, Mmm, Instant hit with my boyfriend and me.

I made this for my kids for a summer lunch.  It was a complete success.  The Boys really enjoyed them.  I took the advice of others and diced the pepperoni, but I think next time I'll leave them whole to see the difference.  thanks so much for a great recipe.

I found this recipe to be 'messy' during the cutting of the pinwheels...didn't hold together very well and ended up smashing most. BUT the flavor was great and I didn't bring any home from my meeting!  It was worth the mess!

We are keeping this one!  I didn't have room for all the cheese.  I had to take some of it off to be able to roll the dough.  The recipe will definitely have to be doubled for us next time!

VERY GOOD!!  My kids loved them!  I would recommend pinching the ends a little after you cut them to keep the cheese from running out as they cook, otherwise they are fantastic treats!

I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  To make rolling easier, I put the crescent roll dough in the freezer for just a few minutes so the dough would be stiffer. It really seemed to help!

This was easy and my boys loved them. I did freeze them for a little while before cutting them and it made them super easy to cut. I sprinkled a little garlic salt on top of them. Didn't have a single one left.

These were so easy and SO yummy!! Instead of using the triangle crescant rolls, I used a dough sheet that you can find in the same section as the crescants. That made is so much easier to assemble! And I didn't cut them into individual rolls until after I baked them. Such an easy yummy treat!

These were pretty good, I did as others had suggested and spread sauce on them and put them in the freezer for 10 minutes after rolling.  I think next time I will use deli sliced mozzarella for a more even filling and for easier rolling.

These turned out so well. I'm not going to buy pizza rolls again! :) What I did was roll out the creasent rolls. Then cut up the pepperoni, placed the cut up pepperoni and cheese on the dough. Then I rolled them into logs, placed them in the freezer for 20 minutes. After chilled, I sprayed with butter and seasoned with garlic, onion, and lemon and herd spice. Baked for 12 minutes. Wonderful! :)

I really hate that I wasted ingredients on this.  It sounded like it had real potential.  I fixed these for myself and three boys.  None of us ate them.  The dough browned, but was mushy and collapsed when cool.  I'm a good cook, I know how to make things work.  These just didn't (two stars for decent flavor though).

I quadrupled the recipe and made a TON of these for my mom's retirement party -- glad I did, because they went fast! Definitely a hit with adults as well as kids. I followed other users' suggestions and chopped the pepperoni in a food processor before layering on the cheese. 

One key to keeping them from falling apart while baking was to press the perforated edges of the triangles together before adding toppings, and then press and seal the edges of the roll before slicing them.

These were great - received lots of compliments!  Easy to do, especially with the newer non-perforated crescent roll doughs and quick.  I added a shake or two of Italian seasoning to the dough before rolling up and heated the pizza sauce in the microwave a bit before serving.  Yum!

Very tasty, and I love the idea! it is a bit dry though, so when I made a second batch I added some pizza sauce to the inside of the pinwheels and that worked well.  I also switch out pepperoni and add mushrooms and green peppers.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I read the helpful reviews and chopped up the pepperoni and mixed it with mozzarella and the sauce and ended up using not even 1/4 of it.  I bought puff pastry dough and made mini calzones so will find out how they taste, but can't say I loved the taste of it.  First off, it was way too messy with the sauce falling out and secondly, it was too salty for my taste.  It's a great idea, though, and could taste better, at least for me, if I use less pepperoni in the mix.

So wonderful! I made these two years ago for a football party and my husband and I enjoyed them so much that they've started to replace our weekly pizza date. They're cheaper to make than homemade pizza and way cheaper than pizza hut (alas, it's the only option in town!).

This recipe is great! I recommend adding the pizza sauce (or spaghetti sauce) to the crescent rolls, then piling on the cheese, and lastly topping it with chopped up pepperoni. Quickly roll them length wise and pop them into the freezer for a few minutes. Afterward, take them out, cut them up, and pop them in the oven. I promise, everyone will be asking for more!

p.s. I added garlic salt, sausage, and some oregano.. DELICIOUS!

Even being an experienced cook, these were messy/difficult to cut. I like to do a recipe "as written" and rate first, so this gets a 4 for being messy/hard to cut. The reviews are right...freeze some before cutting, to help. The kids I made for, loved the taste, and I should have made a double (or triple) batch!

I am so mad, I didn't even get to taste these. I had to review it and give it 5 stars because everyone came up to me after they were done eating them telling how great they were. I will have to make them again so I can have a taste. If you are planning on making these for a party I would suggest to double or triple the recipe. They go quick.

I put them in the fridge for an hour or so to make it easier to cut. I also turned over the dough and pinched that side together as well before putting on the toppings. I added mozzeralla on top and cooked for 10 minutes. Yum!

I think these are terrific! I made them last night as a snack using reduced fat cresents (store brand!)and pre sliced thin pepperoni. I tried with sprinkling italian seasoning in them and with no seasoning, my husband wasn't a fan of the seasoning but I thought they were great either way. I am baffled by the reviews about these being messy and time consuming?? I rolled these up and finished in less than 10 minutes and I got mozzerella sprinkled a little here and there but I just wiped it up! I didn't freeze them either, I had no problems cutting them. And trust me, if I can make these easily anyone can, because I am a novice cook! I will make these again and again!!!

These were yummy.  I used the super big crescents and rolled them out.  I brushed them with butter and sprinkled one side of them with parm cheese, parsley, basil, and oregano before rolling them.  I also made some with ricotta, crushed garlic, cheddar and mozzarella cheese for the non meat eaters.  The key to easily preparing these is to make sure you roll them tight and keep them cold.  I'll be making these again soon.

These aren't awful, but they aren't great either. They're time consuming and messy. It's difficult to roll them without the fillings falling out or the seams splitting. They're also difficult to cut without making a mess. The crescent roll taste is overpowering. Using actual pizza dough would make this recipe alot better, but even with pizza dough it still wouldn't be worth the time and effort these take.

It's so easy to make these. I didn't change the recipe at all and they turned out great.  I tried baking them on a pizza stone and a cookie sheet, the stone gave better results.  I'll chop up the pepperoni next time, seems like they may roll up a little better.  I'll definitely make these again.

I made these for a bridal shower I hosted.  They were a hit.  I doubled the recipe and cut the pepperoni into pieces.  I addd a little parm. and some italian seasoning with the cheese.  After I rolled them up I let them sit in the fridge to get cold and I had no problem cutting them.  Easy and delicious....a 5.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these tasted really good.  I took the advice of other members here.  I grounded the pepperoni, and added pizza sauce on the crescent.  I must admit I tried all different ways of keeping those seems closed, and they broke on me each time.  Either way, everyone ate them.  I have at least have two dozen rolled up in my freezer for late night snacking.  Thanks for the great recipe...will make them again, maybe with linguica and cheddar cheese!!!

Excellent!!  So easy and tasty.  Recipe call for pizza sauce as a dip for baked pinwheels, I found it was not needed.  My guests preferred the pinwheels without sauce.  I will definately make again.

These were wonderful!  It is much easier to fold up each end to the middle and also seal the ends- and instead of cutting all the way through-just score into 4 pieces and then bake.  After taking them out of the oven then cut again all the way through.  I also diced the pepperoni as another reviewer suggested and they were fabulous!

I use the pizza crust as well instead of crescent rolls and have added many different toppings.  This is soooo good and my children love it.  You know how hard they can be to please.  Whenever I make this recipe I make 2 and there is NEVER any left!

The pizzas came out great!  My boyfriend and I made them together.  He loves the cresent dough and cannot stop making pizzas for himself!  It was just a tiny bit difficult to roll the dough, but with a little patience, everything worked out well.  I cut the dough in halves and not in fours like the recipe said...it made the pizzas bigger - which was good for my boyfriend who can't get enough of these!  Thanks for the recipe!  My boyfriend and I love making these and it's fast and easy!:)

I loved the recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I added the pizza sauce onto the roll before baking it instead of using it as a dipping sauce.  It was a bit messier, but heavenly yummy--even my son liked it.

My kids ate this SO fast I didn't even get to try it! Perfect recipe for the kids, but you might want to double or triple it! I want to try it with other toppings just to see how that turns out. A+++ says Miles(4) and Jada(2)!

What a great idea!!  I made this using homemade pizza dough (made in my bread machine) and not only was it simple, it was a great hit with the kids.  I will definitely use this for the kids' b-day parties in the future.  They're easy to handle, yummy, and make no mess.  Thank you!!!

These were pretty terrible.  I read the reviews and put the dough in the freezer for a bit.  It really helped the rolling process.  

They just didn't taste good.  Too buttery and mushy.

I think it would be better with pizza dough, and sauce inside. 

Pretty disappointed...

WAY easy, and super quick appetizer or quick side to take to a pot-luck or serve at home for hungry people that can't wait for the main dish, haha. this one is also easilly modified to suit anyone's taste. pizza is something you can add anything you prefer to. although i did not add any extra ingredients the first time (aside from extra cheese), next time around i am going to throw some diced onions, green peppers & olives in. i also used the "mini" pepperoni slices so it rolled easier. the bake time (maybe my oven isn't as hot or something) did not seem to get them cooked all the way through, so i had to throw them in again...just watch the bake time and make sure they don't end up doughy! but this is a cool twist on pizza-like appetizers and one i will continue to make.

Made it for teen youth group meeting and they were gone quickly. Everyone loved them, including my kids who want me to make them again soon! So easy and good. I didn't make at modifications, but will add more meat next time.

The people at the party were happy with them, although I think it depends more on the taste of the sauce than the actual recipe. Good idea, either way, and easy to transport! Works well with regular pizza dough rolled thinly.

Just ok.  I'm a sauce lover and you really can't put a ton of sauce in them before rolling or it'll be super messy.  BUT - that's just my personal taste.  I did dip them in pizza sauce afterwards, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

I love these. They are a pain to make (after rolling them, try freezing them for 10 minutes or so. It makes it easy to cut) but everyone loves them. I like to sprinkle a little garlic, oregano, and parm cheese on top before I bake them. I can't go to any party without bringing these.

For simplicity's sake, I spread the pizza sauce on the crescent rolls before I added the pepperoni and cheese. These were simple and tasted good, but they didn't go as fast as other appetizers served at the same time.

These were good but not great. I spread a VERY thin layer of pizza sauce on the crescent roll dough before adding the pepperoni and cheese. I did chop the pepperoni.

Love this quick recipe. I use turkey pepperoni and a mix of shredded mozzarella and provolone. When I serve these at parties I add a dipping sauce - crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, couple pinches of sugar, and lots of oregano.

This recpie is a good starting point.  My fiance loved it, but I made some additions to it to give it some flavor.  He said it tasted almost like a calzone, with no ricotta.  I used the canned dough that comes out with no seams.  I spread the sauce as the bottom layer of the dough, then sprinkled parmesean cheese on it, and then put pepperoni and fresh mozzaerlla cheese on it.  I rolled it up, pinched it closed, then put some melted butter on top and sprinkled it with Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  It turned out fantastic.

I made these for a picnic and they were a huge hit and gone in a flash.  I did stick the rolls in the freezer for a few minutes before inserting the toothpicks (which I soaked in water) and then cutting them into pieces.  Will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks!

These are so simple but so awesome.  We love the flaky butter crescent rolls, so we used those. I folded them over instead of rolling them and the kids thought they were hot pockets. We will definitely have this again.

These were a hit with my kids.  We brushed on a little pizza sauce and then followed the recipe exactly.  I used store brand crescent rolls and I didn’t have any mess.  I paired this with a salad and my kids had a quick lunch that was fun to make.

I made these for a late night snack for me and the hubsters. I didn't cut them into the rectangles. I left the crescent rolls whole. I brushed the rolls with melted butter, Italian seasoning and garlic salt. I will probably use the garlic powder instead of the salt. We ate with pizza sauce. Loved them!!! Next time I will try with pizza dough and see which is better.

I made these along with the St. Louis Toasted Raviloi recipe on this site and we loved them both. Instead of cutting them into smaller rolls I just rolled them into two logs and brushed them with egg to brown them up.

These were pretty good, I did find them extremely tricky to assemble.  I froze my crescent rolls beforehand but once I had the filling put in I had a hard time cutting them without completely squashing them.  Definitely kid friendly tho, they were all eaten up!

Not bad.  Easier to put together than others said. I thought it was a bit bland, next time I will put a little garlic salt on the crescent rolls.  Overall pretty good though, easy to make!

I just wanted to add -- do NOT put the pizza sauce in the pinwheels...i put it in mine and they all came out FLAT. i think the oils from the crescent rolls and the sauce made the rolls sink. some came out okay, but most of them fell flat. But you can't go wrong with the flavoring. i intend to devour them all the same...just kinda bummed because they didn't look like rolls.

I was disappointment with this recipe because it was just sort of plain and so-so.  Of course cheese, pepperoni, and bread taste good together so its hard to complain but this dish would be better for kids because its just not that exciting.

I made these today after seeing the picture. My 7 year old and hubby both loved them.  So easy to make just took half the crescent rolls flaten them out covered them with 3 slices of mozzarella chesse then topped it with the pepperoni rolled it up sliced it into 8 slices and bake. Once you get them rolling up it was nothing to it.  Will keep this one for sure and make often.  Would be great for carry ins or showers.  Then again tailgate parties would also be a great place to serve them.  Thanks again for a quick and easy recipe.

This recipe was alright.  Not the pinwheels I remembered while I was in New York.  I'll try to make this again but change it up a bit.  First, I think the pinwheels need to be bigger.  Next, the dough tasted more like croissants than pizza.      With a little tweaks, we will get it!

I was very disappointed as to how these turned out after reading so many positive reviews. After reading recommendations from previous posters to freeze the dough for 20 minutes, pinching the dough with a little bit of water, to chopping the pepperoni, this appetizer was not worth the trouble in the end.

I served these as an appetizer before homemade pizza, and my friends loved them.  I was not a fan of the "crescent roll taste", but overall I thought they were pretty good.  I agree that is is not as messy if you chop the pepperoni first, then mix all the filling ingredients together.

mmm, this recipe was so easy to make and tasted delicious. I used store bought pizza dough instead of the crescent rolls and it was amazing. I rolled the dough out really thinly and then put the sauce and toppings on as I normally would with a pizza. Then, I used a pizza slicer to slice 1" x 5" rectangles and folded the ends in. Then I threw it in the oven at 375 for about 10-15 minutes and they came out nice and crispy. I don't know why, but it tastes so much better than pizza. A normal store bought dough made around 25-30 pieces.

Yummy! I rolled it as instructed into 4 pieces and didn't slice them up and baked it as a whole!! It turned out great. Easy to roll & prepare! Taste just like a pizza sub!

I left the crescent rolls in the freezer while I did each one.  They warmed up to quickly if I left them out.

I tried this recipe one night before my daughter's birthday party to see how it would work... YUM!!! The kids love it and it's a nice "finger food" for parties. The only suggestion I have is to make sure the crescent dough is right out of the fridge. If it's not stiff from the fridge it's hard to work with. I've made multiple times now and will continue making them!

I was worried about the technique as I never had much luck working with pastry dough of any kind, but I followed the recommendations to freeze the tube for 15 minutes before working with the dough, then chilled the rolls overnight before slicing and baking. Quadrupled the recipe for a party of 30. I made half with diced pepperoni and mozzerella, and half "veggie" with marinated artichokes, minced garlic, chopped black olives and mozzerella. Served with pizza sauce to dip and this was the first dish gone at the party.

I love this recipe my only suggestion is to use refrigerated pizza dough it makes it easier to roll up. I had a hard time keeping the crescent rolls from breaking where they were precut.

These were awesome.  My very picky kids, 5 & 2, just chowed them down!  I did as other reviewers suggested and chilled the dough before assembling them and after but before cutting.  They were not messy at all.  A little cheese came out of the sides but not much.  I didn't go overboard on the cheese or sauce, and did add some Italian seasoning, garlic powder parmesan cheese.  We will definitely make these again!

I had a dinner party and I could barely get them onto the serving plate before my brother ate most of them.  I did change a few things, but this is a very versatile recipe idea.  I grated the pepperoni and added a little ricotta cheese so that when it was rolled up the cheese was in the center.  I also made a vegetarian version with spinach and ricotta as well as the mozzarella in the center.  I wish I made more! They were gone before most of the guests even arrived...

These were so easy and good. My husband and kids loved them. I didn't cut them into pinwheels though. Just left them like little calzone type things. Next time I think I might try using a pizza dough or something because I don't like all the extra preservatives and stuff thats in crecent dough. And I'll cut them into pinwheels next time.

I made some changes. I used a can of pizza dough and rolled it out thin prior to adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added italian seasoning and used turkey pepperoni instead of regular pepperoni. It turned out great.

These were great for a quick snack, and were very easy to prepare. The one thing that can get a little tricky is the dough. When connecting the two pieces, be sure not to stretch out the dough too much. Freezing the dough before adding toppings and freezing the logs before cutting helped bunches! I would not recommend using sliced cheese in place of shredded cheese, since it just makes it harder to roll into logs, especially with pepperoni. When i used small slices of provalone, some edges poked out of the dough! (And since sliced cheese is thicker, there was a lot of leakage in the oven).

I used the Reduced Fat Pillsbury Crescent rolls, and they worked well, even if its flavor kind of overwhelmed that of the filling. This is definitely a recipe I will be using again; a must-have for parties!

These were really good. I rolled them up but didn't cut them so I ended up with what looked like four croissants. Had two of them for supper with some salad. I will definately make these again.

Amazing as both a "comfort food" snack and as a simple appetizer for guests.

Wonderfully versatile - as you can add as many (or as few) "toppings" as you please.

The only problem I found is that they started to fall apart as I assembled them - but this seems to be a known (and easily solved) issue...

So what if a few didn't turn out perfectly - if it tastes THIS good, then who's to complain ;);)

These were delicious.  My only complaint is that they didn't look like the picture at all.  I must have done something wrong.  The taste was there though!  I would make them again.

I winged/tweaked this due to time with this one, and instead of using crescent rolls I had a tube of the buttermilk biscuit dough--just mushed them all together and made one big flat dough surface--used diced tomatoes, oregano, smoked provolone, basil, garlic and fresh spinach. Definitely easier to freeze 'em for about 15 min before slicing. Once on the cookie sheet I sprinkled mozz cheese. Baked until golden brown/cheese bubbly (~12 min @ 400F)--they got a little tall(almost like puffballs) since it was biscuit dough--but still VERY yummy!! Can't wait to try the 'real' thing with crescent dough. :)

These were sooo good. The kids gobbled them up very quickly. They didn't look to good when they were done, but they tasted so yummy. I did as others suggested and put them in the freezer for about 10 min. before slicing. Will definitely make again (and often!!) We did not have pizza sauce, but I didn't think they really needed it. My 2yr old used ranch and loved them! Thank you for a great kid friendly recipe

Wow! I couldn't believe that something so simple was such a huge hit at our party! Like others, I had trouble keeping the dough together as I rolled it, so next time I will make sure I pinch the dough together better. Messy, but fun to make and very tasty!

Everyone really loved these.  I used sliced peperoni and mozzerella from the deli of our supermarket.  I just cut the slices of peppereoni in half and used 1 and a half slices per section.  Same with the mozzerella.  These slices were nice and pliable, and made the rolling up easy.

I served these at a kid's birthday party and they were pretty well-received.  I think I need some practice rolling, cutting and arranging them so that all the cheese doesn't spill out, though.  I will also try different fillers like basil, spinach, mushrooms, roasted peppers, etc.

These were bland, they need some seasoning in them, maybe italian seasoning blend or parmesan cheese on top, i don't know. I recommend you cut them in more than 4 , otherwise they'd be doughy inside. Rolling these suckers was kind of hard but it can be done if you keep the seams from opening (the diagonal crescent cuts). I froze the logs and it was easy to cut them with a sharp knife. I used wet toothpicks to keep them from opening up. The sauce was definitely necessary.

My boyfriend's mother makes these and he loves them.  I tried to copy the way she makes them, but they didn't turn out very well.  Low and behold I find this version of pinwheels and they now turn out perfect!  We don't use the pizza sauce, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  Be sure to take the advice of other reviewers and put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before using.  It makes it so much easier to handle.  Thank you Christi for helping me to recreate my boyfriend's favorite snack!

The recipe didn't call to add the sauce BEFORE baking.  This recipe only got 3 stars for no reason - you MUST follow directions.  Geesh.

These were really good, but I messed up the first round, but with some advice of others, I think I have come up with a good way to bake these.  Spread some sauce on the crescent rolls (lightly) place the pepperoni and then cheese and roll.  Put in the freezer for about 20 min, then cut them and use the toothpicks.  DO NOT cook them on the tray that you just put in the freezer or the tops will cook and the bottoms will be doughy.  Cook for about 15 to 17 mins.  Also, after you cut them, if you can separate them, they will cook better or the outside ones will cook a little faster than the inside ones.  Kids would definately love these and they were easy, maybe a little too messy for finger foods at a party thought - but really good!!

I refrigerated these before slicing them as others suggested and that worked well.  They stuck to the cookie sheet after I baked them though so maybe next time spray some cooking spray or something on the sheet to prevent that.  I didn't dip them in pizza sauce, and I don't think that it's necessary.  They were good, but a little messy, and I had to squish them to get them off of the sheet.  Taste: 5 stars  Prep: 4

I pulled this recipe out to make with some small kids who were bored.  We had so much fun layering the toppings and rilling these up.  Tasted just like pizza when dipped in warn pizza sauce. Yummy!

A novel idea and tasted great.  I gave it four stars b/c next time I plan to leave the rolls as-is.  Cutting them was kind of hard b/c the dough was so soft.  They bake up nicely as pinwheels, but like I said, next time I'll keep them whole.  Thanks!

Horribly hard to form & roll dough so that it would actually stay together. Messy & unrealistic. Will never make this recipe again. Very disappointing.

Everyone liked these.I would try them with some seasonings to make even tastier.
Really liked the idea of the crescents for the "crust".They were yummy!

I liked the taste of the butter from the crescent.  I had problems cutting the dough without is smooshing down so i ended up not rolling them up and then when it was done cooking we put the pizza sauce right on top and it turned out great!

This was suppossed to serve as our side to our soup & salad dinner...which unfortunately did not turn out as well as we hoped. However, these did turn out and to our surprise, were very tasty. I used pizza cheese and we didn't need to dip them in pizza sauce, we thought they were good they way they were. I'm not even a fan of pepperonu and I still thought these were good! Will make these again! Thanks Christi!

Very good and easy! Even my pickiest child tried and liked it. I added pizza sauce to the toppings and used a little touch of water to help seal the dough.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  The butter taste from the crescent rolls was just too overwhelming.  Good concept though, I think I will try it again with different dough.

Kids love it! Mine didn't exactly look like pin wheels..but the toddlers who scarfed them down didn't care. I always make this when we have company and I know the kids won't like the "grown-up" fare I have prepared. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

Very good!!! I served it at my son's 1st Birthday party and everyone loved it, including the kids. My only problem was the rolling of the dough, pepperoni and cheese. The dough was very sticky and was difficult to roll tightly. As a result, the cheese was falling out (before cooking). I also recommend you slice the pepperoni very thinly, or else you will have problems rolling... I will try making my own dough in the bread machine next time.

Instead of the crescent triangles, I used the sheet of crescent dough.  Have made this with ham and swiss and green pepper....lots of options for this easy recipe.  My favorite is sandwich pepperoni, provolone, and diced jalapenos....awesome!

These were a-ok. Made them for Saturday night movie time! I made half with pepperoni half plain cheese.  
I also used pizza dough vs the cresent rollls- they are too sweet.

My kids (2 & 3) loved these. They were very quick and easy to make. Both kiddos were able to help sprinkle on the cheese and roll 'em up. I did not use pepperoni because they don't like pepperoni. Otherwise, I followed the directions. I will be making these again soon.

A few years back I thought I was being creative and different coming up with these from items in my fridge (we were completely out of pizza dough that night but everyone wanted pizza!) I see I was beaten to the punch but it's ok - still a great fast fix for dinner (and especially a hit with the kids!)

I use this recipe all the time for family get-togethers and I never have any leftovers.  I do chop up the pepperoni a bit for ease of rolling.  I've also mixed oregano and garlic powder with the mozzarella cheese for a bit of extra flavor.  I spray the top of the rolls with non-stick cooking spray (or one can use an egg wash) and then sprinkle the tops with Parmesan cheese and then bake.  Remember, a little bit goes a long ways and makes it easier to roll up - don't go thinking a lot of filling would be better - it won't.

My daughter said her friends went nuts for these.  I did chop the pepperoni, and I added a little sauce inside the roll.  A little chill time did make them easy to slice.  Next time I'm showing my daughter how to make them - they are so easy!

Crescent rolls aren't the right medium for this dish.  They stay too mushy.

Made these for holiday party with some pizza sauce on the side - HUGE HIT.  Made some small changes - used shredded italian blend cheeses and pepperoni.  Stretched out the dough before adding the fillings to make it stretch further.  Also, found it easier to cut them after they were cooked!

Made these for a birthday party and they were a hit! Very easy to make!  I also made a big batch and froze extras.. Made it a lot easier to just pop them in the oven before serving.

I made this for the first time last week, and it was amazing. I made a a couple of alterations. I sliced the pepperoni into smaller pieces, and instead of using the sauce as a dip, I spread it on the dough before I placed down the cheese and pepperoni. It's a bit messy, and like others have said, it is a really good idea to sit these in the freezer/fridge for 10-20 minutes before cutting into them. I experimented and used canadian bacon and cheese on another batch, and they turned out amazing as well. You could definetly freeze these for the future. They're very pretty, if you cut them right, I had a few that turned into puffy globs after baking, but they were good none the less.

These were amazing!  I followed some other reviews by freezing the rolls before I cut them and it made a huge difference.  I also added green peppers and onions to some and put a little bit of pizza sauce inside the rolls.  They were gone in no time and I can't wait to make them again.

Easy, tasty, quick recipe!  And honestly you don't even need the recipe itself...just the ingedients list.  I didn't have any problems with oozing but I also didn't overload the crescent with too much sauce.  Freezing is a great tip...but if you're short on time like I always am...then just cut them after baking & cooling.  I used a butcher style knife so that I didn't have to drag the knife and cause a mess.  Works great!  Oh and I also found garlic crescent rolls which are awesome for this recipe.

Made these for a dance practice that i'm going to tonight. So will see how they go over. I like some others froze them after making them into logs. They do cut so nice that way. As another woman, she added egg wash on top of hers, but then I also added parmesean and another shredded cheese, asiago. Both cheeses together were good. I had no trouble with oozing out of anything and will definately do as others said, freeze some to have on hand when grandkids pop in. Thanks for the recipe. Will be a hit!

I took these to a neighborhood Bunko party & they were a hit.  They didn't come out quite as pretty some of the photos members posted, but they tasted good.  I did place the crescents in the fridge prior to prepping, and that helped with handling them.  I added some pizza sauce to the crescent, but will reduce the amount next time to avoid it squeezing out the when baking.  I sliced the turkey pepperoni (julienne), and that worked out nicely.  Will definitely make this again!

These were very easy and good! Changes I did: added a layer of cream cheese prior to the pepperoni and still topped with mozzerella. Then I rolled up (skipped the cutting part) and put in the refrigerator for about an hour. We dipped the rolls in warmed maranara. Super quick and easy :)

So yummy! I used Pillsbury Place n' Bake rounds since they are already pre-cut. I unrolled them, added shredded mozzarella and pepperoni slices. Once I rolled them up, I topped them off with more mozzarella and a dash of pizza seasoning. They were served with a side of Marie's Jalapeno Ranch dressing. My boyfriend gobbled them up!

I made these as an appetizer for a family get-together.  They were a HUGE hit--the only problem was they ran out too quickly, I should have doubled or tripled the recipe!  I added Italian seasoning and froze overnight for easy slicing, then served with Ragu pamesan romano marinara sauce with shredded parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

I diced the pepperoni and stirred it together with some of the sauce and the cheese, then just spread the mixture on the crescent dough.  Left remaining sauce for dipping along with Ranch.  Added chopped black olives to half the batch.  (You could add any of your pizza fav's).  Rolled them up and partially froze them to make cutting much easier.  Then sprinkled with grated parmesan and a tiny bit of garlic before baking.  YUM!

I gotta say I wasn't the biggest fan. They just didn't have much "oomph" to them. Not bad, but not great either.

I used seamless dough sheets, included sauce in the layering, rolled them up and chilled in the freezer for awhile - that helped a lot.  Cut them into about one inch thick sections and baked for probably 20 minutes, until they were browned.  I think these would be good with sausage.

Great idea! The first time in a long while that I haven't had to listen to the kids complain "I don't like it" even the one who truly doesn't like pizza ate. The only change I made was to use Pillsbury pizza dough instead of the croissants.

These are addicting! The whole family enjoyed these, especially my 19 mo. old daughter! Crescent rolls are kind of hard to work with once they have been sitting out so work fast! Great little snack.

Didn't turn out too pretty, but tasted great.  I put sauce on the inside and they turned out flat.  Will try without sauce next time.    My husband keeps asking me to make them again!

What's not to like?  Super easy.  I chopped up the pepperoni because it made things much easier, used reduced fat crescent rolls (because I totally can't tell the difference!), and used spaghetti sauce (because it was cheaper than pizza sauce. haha).  Served at a lingerie shower- didn't have any left.

I made these using the Garlic Butter flavored crescent rolls. My family absolutely loved them, as did my book club group. I didn't even bother with the pizza sauce - and didn't miss it. Will definitely make these again next time I need a quick appetizer.

These were absolutely delicious!  My husband didn't like that you had to dip it in the sauce so next time we might try and put the sauce on the rolls as well - but I loved the dipping.  VERY good.

These things are incredible!  When we have friends over, the pinwheels are the very first thing to go.  As others have said, I highly recommend refrigeration before cutting them.  I've also made these with the pepperoni diced and added diced onion as well.  Delicious!!!

I tried to follows others advice, but my biggest proble came with rolling the wheels. I tried multiple ways: 1. rolled a wheel after refrigerating, but the dough wouldn't stick together and I ended up with holes all over. I sliced it with a charp knife and inserted toothpicks to hold them together on thier sides. 2. i left one roll unsliced with toothpicks in it. 3. Two rolls I didn't bother rolling, which tirned out to be the cleanest method.   They were still eaten, but it wasn't worth the mess or time. I might try it again, but take a very different approach, such as using less ingredients or maybe different dough.

These can be quite messy to make, but it helps if you dice up the pepperoni first.  Once I roll these up, I put them in the freezer for 30 minutes or so, just to allow them to firm up before cutting them.  Everyone seems to love them, and I serve them with sides of ranch and marinara sauce.

These were pretty good.  I did put a scant amount of marinara on them prior to rolling.  Froze for about an hour prior to cutting.  Baked on their sides (not w/ the cut side down).  No mess at all.

These were a good idea, but the crescent roll dough was just too small and didn't stick together right.  They tasted good, but were way too messy.  I will definitely make these again, but I think I will use pizza dough this time.

Very tasty! They can be a bit challenging to the less seasoned cooks as far as rolling them up. The suggestions by a few other reviewers to secure with toothpicks and chill in the freezer for 20 - 30 minutes before slicing definitely helps make handling and slicing easier. Chopping the pepperoni and pressing the cheese down lightly onto the dough before rolling also is a big help. But all-in-all these are worth the extra little effort.

I like everything in this recipe so don't know what happened but everyone who ate this couldn't muster more than it's ok.  Which translates to don't make it again in my house. Due to the overwhelming amount of awesome recipes we get from this site, we were just suprised to get one so ~ NOT.

These are very good but the reason I give it only 4 stars is because they are somewhat difficult to work with when rolling them up.  I wanted to really put a lot of cheese and pepperoni in these but then they're too full and you can't roll them up.  I'll probably try a different technique next time.  Otherwise very yummy.

I used the ingredients but left the crescent rolls in the original size. I topped the triangles and then rolled them up. This made them a bigger individual size for dinner. Easy enough to do and the kids loved them. I definitely recommend chopping up the pepperoni.

I didnt care much for these. First they are very messy and everying comes in while baking. I thought it tasted to sweet because of the cresent dough. My husband and daughter loved them but I might have to make a few adjustments before I eat them again.

This was good!  I used the garlic cresent rolls, turkey pepperoni, and reduced fat mozzarella.  As per others' suggestions, I froze the rolls before cutting them and used my magic bullet to mix some sauce and chop up the pepperoni.  When I cut them, some of them broke apart, but I fit them together and laid them on the pan.  They were very good.  Next time, I would double the recipe to make a larger amount of rolls.

I used the garlic crescent roll and put the pizza sauce on the dough before I added the toppings.  The taste was great but it was very MESSY cutting the slices before.  I tried cooking them as calzones instead of cutting the slices and it was a lot easier and tasted just as good.

these did not taste good enough for all the hassle it took to assemble them.  my kids liked them, but it was just a mess.  i put the dough in the freezer and threw the pepperoni, sauce, and some cheese in the processor like some other reviews.  but the dough was just coming apart and breaking everywhere and they didn't roll up very tight.  i had doubled the recipe and i ended up just putting some of the sauce mixture with cheese on the lg end and rolling.  still wasn't that great although easier.

After reading all the reviews I really wanted to like this...I really wanted my family to like it. It was not good at all. The sweetness of the cresant rolls was gross with the pizza filling. It was just not our style I guess? I will try the method with ham and cheese, maybe that will come out better.

Husband liked these but I thought they were just ok. I will try them again but maybe a little differently. I would use sliced provolone or mozzerella next time - I think that would make it quicker, easier and less messy. Also might be better with refrigerated pizza dough. I normally like crescent dough but didn't care for it in this recipe.

This recipe is so incredibly easy to make and could be used at so many events.  I made them today.  What a breeze and how fun to dip in sauce.  I didn't have pizza sauce so used regular warmed up spagetti sauce and it was delicious.

I thought these were very good.  I think you might need to double the batch otherwise there will not be enough for a family of four!!  I am anxious to try some of the other suggestions people made.  I did not have too much trouble rolling them...just takes patience!!  I also used low fat rolls.

these were super messy!! trying to roll them up was horrible. i suggest leaving the cresant dough in the triangles that they are in and just putting a spoonful of sauce on the wide end,drop some cheese on there and pepperonis then folding from the wide end of the dough to the narrow end then stretching and folding the edges underneath the pizza pocket. then that will avoid any cheese oozing out while you bake (normally ide love that but it burns on the pan )

Made a few times already, once to bring to a party.  Got rave reviews from all and we're gone within minutes.  I used pizza dough instead, and found that if you finely chop the meat and add some green peppers & mushrooms.  Used leftover pizza sauce for dipping.

Terrific recipe! It was a little messy to make as most others have said, so I 1. Chopped up the pepperoni and cheese in the food processor. 2. Spread some sauce and the cheese/meat mix over the dough. 3. Pressed the mix down tight, and added some garlic salt and italian seasoning. 4. I rolled them up and froze it for about 20 mins. The rolls cut easily, and didn't have to bake any longer than the recipe called for. A little messy, but delicious with both ranch dressing and marinara! I highly recommend making this recipe, pinwheel shape or not. :)

These are addicting. Fairly easy once you get the hang of it, definitely take the advice of others and freeze these before cutting up. I diced the pepperoni slices, probably used less than a cup of cheese, but almost 45 slices of pepperoni. Very good, mine took a lot longer to bake, not sure why. I will be making these again, big hit.

These were very messy to make, even after freezing the dough for 15 minutes prior to making and 15 minutes after rolling them. They just tasted very ordinary. I wouldn't make these again.

I could not roll these. I chopped the pepperoni and cheese and tried to roll them up and the dough ripped and fell apart. Then I got mad and smashed it all together and it looked like a loaf, so I shaped it into a long skinny loaf of bread and baked it and cut into slices. Everyone loved it! I guess in hind sight, I'm glad I got mad and smashed it.

Wanted something quick and easy for a last minute get together - these were perfect! Put dough in freezer before preparing and again before cutting. Diced the pepperoni and mixed with with a bit of sauce then spread over the cheese. Once rolled, topped with Parmesan and oregano. They were a hit!

These are an appetizer you can make if you have guests at the last minute (esp. guests with kids) You can keep pizza sauce in pantry, crescent rolls/cheese/toppings on hand in the fridge. I have tried pepperoni/mozzarella and jalapeno/monterey jack as fillings. Loved them! Try reduced fat crescent rolls, you can't even tell!

I made this last night for my 5 kids. And they all loved it! Even my 8 year old son who does not like Pizza. They kept saying how good it was. I made half with Cheese & pepperoni and the other half with just cheese. Warmed the pizza sauce for dipping. It was good & fun!

I made these for a potluck at work. I usually try to test new recipes before hand but didn't have the time so I woke up early and made these before work. I followed other reviewers suggestions and put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before I cut them. This step is a must in my opinion. After I cut them and baked them they oozed every where and were not salvagable. Maybe this is because I cut them into thinner strips than the recipe suggests. After this I decided to roll them, bake them, and then cut them. This helped but they were still very flatt and not appealing what-so-ever. I'm sad to say I had to make an emergency run to the store to find something else for my potluck. I will not be making these again.

These are so good and sooo easy!  There's lots of ways you could switch things up like different kinds of cheeses or use sausage instead of pepperoni.  I made these for a little get together and they were a hit!

My husband found this recipe and made these. They came out really well...served with marinara sauce. He has made them a couple of times and I'm sure will make them again. Very Easy Appetizer!

These are so tasty and easy to make!  Freezing the rolls for 5-10 minutes before slicing the pinwheels is important, and cooking the pinwheels on their sides allows them to brown evenly and without falling apart.  Seriously, I can't stop snitching from the batch I made for tomorrow!

These are so easy and good! After rolling, make sure you pinch the dough along the seam so they don't come apart while baking. Everyone loves them - you can't make too many!

I made this recipe both with and without the pepperoni because 3 of my kids don't like pepperoni.

The kids raved about it.  They like it for lunch with a side of fruit or veggies.

Now that they are teens, they like it for snacks, too.

Absolute Hit!! I couldn't keep them on the plate long enough. I have been asked for this recipe many times. It is my families new favorite. I didn't deviate from the recipe until the last batch when I added some basil and oregano. Definetly give these a chance, you won't be dissapointed.

This recipe was just alright.  I've had much better recipes for stromoli (which this mimics).  I found this to be a little bland.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I also used a little olive oil to brush on the top to get that slight browned look.  These fell flat by the time I got them to where I was going.  I also find that using pizza dough and Italian seasoning is much more full of flavor and much shorter on time...You only have to roll one thing and cut it after it's done cooking.

I made these last night for my 8 year old and he gobbled them up.  I did freeze the rolls before slicing, which helped a great deal.  The cresent rolls are a little sweet for my taste for a pizza crust, but again my son was happy so I will definately make these again.  I served with green beans and corn on the cob.

I thought these were fine...nothing really special.  They were rather tricky to cut and I even tried freezing them as some suggested.  They tasted good but I probably won't make them again.

I made these for my son's 1st birthday party. I used a total of four cans of crescent rolls and we had none left! People asked for the recipe before they left. Even the toddlers enjoyed eating them. Great recipe and so easy to make.

I made these for a family party and everyone raved how yummy they were - not too mention they were almost all gobbled up before the party even actually started!!  My mom came in ten minutes late and was told to try one - and she was lucky because there was only ONE left for her to try!!

You would think this as an appitizer, but my hubby LOVES me to make it the whole meal with a salad---however I do like them with the mozzarella cheese, but like them better with cream cheese...do get the garlic cresent rolls---VERY good.

I made these for a couples party we had and everyone gobbled them up.  I don't think the prep was messy at all.  My did not look anything like the picture.  When I baked them they flattened out way too much.  Any suggestions on what I may have done wrong?  Followed the directions even put them in the freezer before slicing.  I also used one members suggestion of spraying the pan and did one batch on their side with the toothpicks(those really flattened)

This is definately a keeper in my house.  Right now, I have three pinwheels on the counter for my husband, but I don't think I can contain myself; they are so addiction.  I took the advice from the other reviewers: I placed the pinwheels in the freezer for a bit, and used parmesean and my own personally made pizza seasoning on the dough before cooking.  With my kids being somewhat picky, they like the idea of picking thier own "topping" out (ie: just cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, ect).

These were awesome and they were eaten up immediately.  I followed the recipe and served this with marinara and (my favorite) homemade Ranch buttermilk dressing.  They aren't the healthiest so I try not to make these too often.

I made it with oregano and light mexican shredded cheese. It is hard to keep them together- just make sure its refrigerated well and use a toothpick.  I sprinkled parm. cheese on wax paper before I put the dough down to keep it from sticking when I was trying to put these together. The parm. cheese made it taste great too.

Made this recipe at a game night with a bunch of friends.  The guys had these completely devoured as soon as they came out of the oven.  Burning their tongues did not stop them from eating them all.  I have never had that happen to an appetizer i've made before.  They were gone in 2 min.  Great recipe.

These must have been good because they were gone in a class of 8 and 9 year olds but I didn't get a chance to try them.  Used much less cheese so it wouldn't ooze all over the place.  Also used the new crescents that come with the garlic spread that I spread on very thinly before layering and rolling.  I'll make these again for a party and be sure to try one before I put them out!

I have been experimenting on so many different appetizers to make for the superbowl game this sunday, and my hubby told me that these were the winner! I had to make another batch cause he couldn't get enough of them. These are perfect because they are so easy to make and come out tasting so good. Thank you for the recipe!

They were good when you dipped in the pizza sauce, but without the sauce they had the overwhelmy taste of crescent rolls. I like crescent rolls, but I was looking for something different. This, to me, is a kid friendly appetizer. Nothing I'd make for company.

These are really good, and kids love them!  I made them for a party and they were gone before I had one! I would spray the pan well with cooking spray next time, and we didn't use as much sauce as they recommend.  I guess my guests didn't want to take the time to dip them!

I made these for my New Years Eve party and they were a hit.  I used the garlic cresent rolls for added flavor.  I could see the cheese wanted to fall out so I baked the rolled logs before slicing.  Once they had cooled I slice them up and put them out for everyone to enjoy.

I made these for New years and had a huge crowd(about 20 teens) to feed. They loved them! I sprayed them with a little butter and sprinkled Italian Seasoning on before baking. Served Pizza sauce and Alfredo on the side for dipping . They were gone in minutes and we made 6 pkgs worth!!

These were a huge hit at our party! They were very messy, but came out beautiful. I cooked them in muffin tins so they would have a nice round shape. I also grated some cheese overtop before sticking them in the oven. I served them hot with jalapeno ranch dipping sauce. I will definitely make these again!

These are a big hit at parties.  They're filling so you don't need to provide a whole lot of other finger foods.  

Quick and easy to make!

Oh so good! It's a pity they're so messy: I couldn't serve all of them to my guests and we gobbled the "failed" ones before they arrived. I used ham and bacon because I can't find pepperoni here in Belgium (except on ready made pizza!)

Messy, my seams were not good, but very tasty and easy. Seasoned my dough first with garlic powder and oregano covered by a light spoon of the tomato sauce.

This was a really simple recipe. If I did it again I would use more pepperoni per roll, and perhaps a dash of oregano mixed in to give it a bit more flavor. But otherwise they were a hit!

I didn't make enough was the only problem.  I made them for a birthday party and they were the first to go.  The only thing I did different is use preshredded mexican blend cheese in stead of only mozzarella.  Very Good

HORRIBLE! Ths was an absolute mess. Not only to make, but to taste. I had pizza sauce squirting everywhere, the pepperonis wouldn't fit, the dough was splitting (even though I pinched it correctly), and I was so disappointed. This recipe needs some work and I wouldn't recommend making it.

These were VERY easy to make and they were delicious.  I did add a few things... after rolling out the section I added:  Garlic powder & red pepper flakes first then, green onion cut up very small, Pepperoni, Parmesan cheese and shredded Italian 5 cheese. I think I will put larger amounts of each ingredient next time as I was afraid I would add too much and they wouldnt turn out.  I did not put them in the freezer before cutting.  I used a sharp knife and they cut easily.  Highly recommend for a kids party or appetizers for an adult party. :)

I made this recipe for a party tonight exactly as listed.  I used store brand dough.  I may not have used all of the cheese - I just sprinkled on the amount that looked right.  They were a hit!  They were the first thing to disappear from the table.  My husband has already asked if I can make some for him.

Ok, I put some of the sauce into my rollup before I baked
them. I also added some diced green pepper and onion for flavor. They came out horrid. The crescent dough didn't rise
that much and no matter how long I cooked them , they still
ended up a bit doughy on the inside. ( I think I went about
18 mins on the cook time).
They were edible but not something I would keep in the recipe file.

I followed many of others' suggestions here.  I put the logs in the freezer and added some pizza sauce to the rolls.  These were pretty tasty, even though I burned them a little bit (I think it was because I cut the pinwheels a little too thin!)  I would add that if you serve pizza sauce on the side, warm it up a little bit!  Thanks for the submission!

I really liked these and found them very easy to make..I doubled the recipe and had no problem rolling...on granite or marble works great!  I popped the logs into the fridge on the cookie sheet for about 2 minutes and they sliced great too.  

I found them a bit bland.. next time I will use diced pepperoni and add spices for more flavor.

These were very tasty, but not very easy to make---definitely try this one at least once before attempting it for a party---it is very hard to get the rolls to stay tight and also hard to slice them.  The result is yummy no matter what happens.

These were so gosh darn easy and delicious!  My two kids made "theirs" first all by themselves and had a ball.  Then my husband had one of theirs and said he would like some so I made a can of crescents for him and he only had one or two pinwheels left!  The only problem I found was that they don't come off the pan too well because of the cheese.  (I even sprayed it with a little olive oil first!)  In spite of this, they still get five stars for being so easy and so yummy!

Very good but messy! Mine totally fell apart when I rolled them. I sprinkled them with romano cheese and pizza seasoning before baking. Very good with a little pizza sauce served on the top.

Christi is right - the crescent roll dough is mouthwatering. These are great as snacks, appetizers and even quick lunches or dinners. Very easy too - my boyfriend makes them all the time now.

Very good.  I too left them a long "logs" and pinched the ends to keep the cheese from escaping.  They were great.

Yummy and easy. I used refrigerator pizza dough, pepperoni, cheese and sauce and then rolled them up and sliced them. I also sprinkled a bit more cheese on the top before baking. I baked them for about 20 minutes and in a 9x13 pan so they held their shape. Which I wouldn’t of done if I hadn’t seen a photo of someone else doing that. So thanks. My kids are going to love these.

My family loved this...it's so simple, too! I do agree that you should put them in the fridge before you roll them (for about 30 minutes), and freeze them for another 30 before you slice them. Otherwise, they fall apart. Other than that, this was great!!!

I floured my surface then put the crescent dough down to work with. I do recommend following other tips listed and mix the pepperoni with the sauce in a food processor which made it easier to spread then cut.  Flavor: I am surprised with all the rave reviews on this. This recipe to me, was a bland, so I ended up adding garlic powder and parm. cheese. This is a very good basic recipe that can be spiced up a bit (my thank you to the contributor for sharing).  I was looking for something quick and easy, which I thought this recipe would be. However, I spent more time on it than I would have liked which could just be my style of cooking.  I'd try this with puff pastry next time and more spices.

I used the crescent rolls the recipe instructed, but wasn't a fan of the crescent roll taste.  I used whole pepperoni and a little mozzarella (not a whole lot because of sensitivities) and it did turn out pretty good, even if I got a little confused with the wording.  Next time, I'll try to make it with pizza crust instead.

Tricky to cut, took several batches to figure out how much cheese to use (lots), and how thick to cut (3/4"+). Also found that I had to reduce oven temp to 350F and cook at 12 minutes. At 375 the bottoms were burning. at 350 they turned golden brown without burning.

These were very good! I made homemade crescent dough which was equivalent to 2 tubes of store bought. Used a bit of sauce as a base layer, then grated Romano, then grated mozzarella, then a bag of sliced pepperoni that I cut into quarters.
I got 19 pinwheels, that baked in 20 minutes.
Next time I would also add some basil or oregano.

I also used the suggestion of other reviewers and chopped the pepperoni in a food processor before spreading on the dough, and freezing the dough before spreading the mixture and before cutting slices.  Delicous, and my super-picky 4-year old devoured them without me nagging.  Great recipe!

This was a crowd-pleaser.  The kids had thirds and my very skinny eats-like-a-bird hostess wolfed several down.  I made my own sauce. 

I only had Pillsbury Grands in the fridge, the pinwheels came out a bit puffy, but nobody cared.  I also chopped the pepperoni in advance, and layered the sauce in with the cheese and pepperoni before rolling, reserving some for dipping.

I also followed the advice to chill the rolls first before slicing -- I gave them about 15 minutes in the freezer, and they were still a bit sloppy to slice, but it all held together once in the oven.  I also did the eggwash, per some reader suggestions.

Crescent roll dough tasted terrible with the ingredients--have made similar pinwheels with pesto and pastry before and would recommend switching to another dough. Per other comments I blended the filling ingredients in a food processor, this made it easy to spread.

These were tasty, but a bit messy putting together and didn't hold their pinwheel shape....though I did put some sauce down on the dough, because I thought it would taste better that way.  Maybe next time I would try it without the sauce rolled up in it.

These were great! Easy and quick to put together and a nice twist on an old classic. I took the advice of other reviewers. I used pepperoni sticks and put 3 of them in the food processor with the pizza sauce and a little cheese and blended into a nice paste that was easy to spread that didn't leak out and made them easy to slice.  Then I added some extra cheese over top of the sauce before rolling. And finally topped them with another sprinkle of mozza before they went into the oven.

Also, I put the rolls in the freezer for about 15 minutes and that made them very easy to slice thinly. I got 7 wheels from one roll. 
The kids loved them and I froze 2 rolls for another night. Great idea! Thanks for the recipe and the tips in the reviews!

It was a little messy getting it to roll up, and to cut, but delicious when finished!

I thought that these were bland. They were also messy to make.

Great simple family favorite, my execution was not great but I didn't want to rate the recipe down for it. I decided to use seamless crescent dough and make 1 large roll, this turned out to be quite difficult as it did not want to roll tightly at all! Because of this not being rolled tight enough my sauce ran out and made the Crescent soft and took twice as long to bake. Flavor was still excellent just not very pretty. Next time I will make as the recipe suggests and roll smaller portions.

I am in love with this recipe! Literally sooooo amazing. I had made some rolls with just plain cheese and those turned out great, too. This is great to feed to the kids I babysit.

I sprayed the pan first with cooking spray. I also used about a tablespoon and a half of melted butter and garlic powder and spread it on the inside then layered the pepperoni and cheese. Then rolled and then and put some more off the butter garlic mixture on top. I baked at 375 for about 13-14 mins. The first time I made these I didn't keep them in long enough. My boyfriend loved them!!!!

My husband and 1  year old loved these. My husband couldn't stop talking about them. They were a little messy, not too bad. I used toothpicks soaked in water for 15  minutes like some of the other reviews said.

Not bad.  Super easy, and quick when I needed something for a party the next day.  I used small pepperoni (snack size).  It worked perfectly, and it's what I had in the freezer.  I think this could be made in one or two long sheets and then sliced, but that's just my opinion.  I also didn't stuff these that much for ease and time.  I read reviews saying they could be briefly frozen for cutting purposes, which is a great idea but I didn't have the time for it.  This served it's purpose, as it was easy, quick, and a fun appetizer.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, these were great! I forgot the pizza sauce, but they still came out really good. I did not chop the pepperoni and didn't really measure anything; just put some pepperoni and cheese on each piece and rolled them up. Secured with toothpicks. I used Immaculate crescent rolls, which don't have trans fat. They were delicious. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Seriously should have read the "most helpful" reviews before attempting this with my 8 year old son...Very difficult to roll and keep together, messy, stuck to the cookie sheet during the baking process, and the cheese oozed out all over. On a positive note, my son loved them...Needless to say we will attempt this recipe one more time, but using the tips from other reviewers.

This was good! Topped with butter and pizza seasoning and that really made it delicious.  Was so yummy!  Boys loved it and was good to take to school next day in lunches.

I have made these so many times I lost count. I like to make two batches ahead of time and stick them in the freezer. Then take them out whenever I want to eat them! They are great.

I was looking for things to make for a party I'm hosting soon.  I made these as a trial for my boyfriend.  I gave us each a few to try out; they were delicious!  My boyfriend had finished the entire pan off before I was done with my plate.  I'm definitely making them for the party.

I made these as a treat for my residents the other day.  They are fabulous!  I had two batches gone in no time.  Most enjoyed them without the pizza sauce.  Today, I took the idea of the pinwheel, sprinkled cinnamon & sugar over the crescent roll, topped with cherry pie filling, rolled them  up (quite messy, I have to say) but boy were they good!  I used the jumbo crescent rolls too... You can adapt this recipe to any filling I guess... This original recipe is a keeper!

I didn't have any problems pinching them together, but they came out doughy, and deflated-looking.  If I would have baked them any longer, they would have burned.  Good recipe for the kids, just not the adults.

Easy, tasty and fun to eat!  I used a spicy pizza sauce to make sure it had enough zing.  Handling the cresent dough was easier than I anticipated.  I will be making these again come Super Bowl time.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party. I doubled the recipe and it didn't last 10 minutes! I made the recipe as is but I did sprinkle some flour on my cookie sheet before putting the cresent dough down for assembly. This really helped and I also rubbed some flour on my hands. This is definitely a keeper!!

TOO GOOD!  How can you possibly go wrong when you start with a can of crescent rolls and add cheese, etc.  FABULOUS PARTY FOOD.  Next time I think I will try adding diced peppers and onions.  HINT: Let the kids help assemble and roll these up.  Keep them occupied while you prepare other goodies.

very good and easy to make i did freeze the rolls a bit before slicing. i put a little sauce on the cresents before rolling up turned out great.  i baked on a pizza stone. I did cook them a little longer than stated. They were great and looked good too. I just made these for the second time and we love them can't understand why so many people have a hard time with these. The second time I made them I sprayed the cutting board i used to roll them up on with Pam this really helped. these are quick and easy. to quote Rachel Ray yum oh!!!!!!!!!

I give this 3 stars simply because it wasnt until after I tried to make it as directed that I realized just how hard it is to slice up cresent rolls! It was extremely frustrating to try and make this recipe without first  reading posters reviews to first FREEZE the dough before trying to roll and slice it That makes alot more sense! Unofortunately I ruined it. Its too bad it isnt mentioned in the recipe to do that because it smelled and looked like it could have been delicious. If its worth waiting on your crescent roll to freeze so you can slice it.

These were pretty good.  I took them to a party and most of them were eaten.  I may try again with different ingredients.

Good Taste. I think I messed something up though cause it does not look like the pictures that other people posted. The kids at the party didn't care and ate almost all of it... the adults on the other hand steered clear (I think cause of how it looked.. hehe). I will try this one again though cause like I said the taste is good and then update my review.

Fantastic and quick. I used garlic cresant rolls and used deli ham instead of the pepparoni. You can very these any way you want and they are great!

These pizza pinwheels were gone in a matter of minutes at our party. I followed others advice and got the butter garlic flavored crescent rolls to add flavor. Made pepporoni and cheese wheels and everyone loved them, with or without the marinara. Cut while frozen and there was zero mess. Will make again!

Easy. Tasty. Fast. Its great! I added some parmesan cheese mixed in with the mozzarella. This will be a good recipe to have on hand for a quick supper. I didn't serve it to kids, but I think it would be wonderful for them.

These were amazing! I made a pizza dough in the bread machine and added diced red and orange peppers to the mix, other than that I didn't change a thing. They went down a treat. I served them with a tomato sauce with added italian seasoning and garlic. Thanks for a great recipe.

Popular with the football crowd.  I used turkey pepperoni and chopped it in the mini-chopped.  Mixed the peppperoni with shredded cheese and some italian spices.  Next time I'll add more cheese to make it less dry.  Probably drier because of the turkey pep.

Do not make this for teenage boys unless you plan to make it everytime they get together.  I made this a couples weeks ago for my son & his friends, however, a few days later they came over again, asked for more.  I have made them 3 times in 2-weeks.  I have no idea how they taste, they are gone before I wash the pan!  KIDS/TEENS LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Fantastic!  I have made these several times and they are always a big hit. I serve them with pizza sauce for dipping. If you freeze the rolls first, they are a easier to cut,then you just have to cook them a little bit longer.

I made these for a party I was hosting and this was the only thing left over.  It was kind of bland and not very interesting.  They also got really messy.  I might try them again though on a different group of people.

Very Good! I ran out of mozzarella and used cheddar for the remaining dough and thought it had a little more taste.  Also the finely shredded cheese made it easier to roll. I doubled the recipe and one can of pizza sauce was still enough for 48 appetizers. Great Party Recipe!

I think that I didn't roll them tight enough b/c they were falling apart. Definitely tasty thought. Will try again and roll tighter and cut into 3 slices instead of 4.

This was great!  I eased up on the sauce and have found that I can use provalone as well as other cheeses.  I think that too many people who have given this recipe a poor review have used too much sauce on the inside.  Ease up and I think you'll enjoy it too!

Excellent! I used Canadian Bacon (due to daycare food requirements) and put the sauce inside. They were excellent! Thanks for the recipe.

I changed this, but it was still great!  I used provolone cheese and thin slices of deli ham (no kind of sauce)...and baked.  They were yummy...another favorite of my kids for lunch.

This recipe gets 5 stars b/c of it's simplicity and good "comfort food" taste. It was inexpensive and easy to prepare and they were a hit at a Superbowl Party we went to. The only changes I made were that I added 8 pepperoni slices to each dough rectangle instead of 6. Also, the freezer trick mentioned by other reviewers definitely helps when cutting these.

These tasted good, but they completely fell apart even after I put them in the freezer for 15 minutes.  There is too much filling to be able to wrap them up tight.

Flavorwise, these were pretty good.  I was a bit frustrated, though, that the dough split when I tried to roll them even though I really thought I had pinched and "sealed" the seams.  They certainly didn't look pretty, but no one cared... they tasted pretty good for something so simple.

These were OK, a little too doughy for our liking, could have used more filling but then they could be harder to roll up. Don't think I'll be making them again.

These were absolutely delicious!  I had a hard time rolling them after adding the cheese, but they tasted great regardless of what they looked like.  I might experiment with sausage, mushrooms, onions and other pizza ingredients next time.

These were the first to go at a recent party - I would have rated it a 5 had they not been so difficult to make.  I used a mini muffin pan to bake them in as someone else suggested and this made the cooking part a lot easier.  I still had problems rolling them though even after reading other reviews and following their suggestions.  Will try again and see if I can "master" the rolling part!  Oh, definitely use Pillsbury brand cresent rolls - I tried with Pillsbury and some generic brands and the generic brands weren't as good.

I prepared this dish as an appitizer but now I make it as a main dish. Make a salad and you have a quick and easy dinner. The pepperoni might be a little greasy for some people. I have also make this dish and subsituted the pepperoni for ham.

I served these as a meal with a salad.  They are fattening enough by themselves!  I took others advice and put them in the freezer for awhile before cutting them.  I sprinkled them with parmesan cheese and they baked golden brown.  I used my pampered chef pizza stone and crusts always turn out perfect with it.

Yummy!!  I have made this several times for luncheons and they always go fast.  They are hard to cut though.  I will probably try freezing the dough as other people suggested.

THIS IS A GREAT FAST AND EASY RECIPE. I DIDN'T HAVE THE PEPPERONI ON HAND SO I DID ONE WITH JUST CHEESE, AND ONE WITH BELL PEPPERS. I ALSO ADDED SOME OF THE SAUCE TO THE DOUGH BEFORE BAKING. THE DOUGH WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH ON THE BELL PEPPER ONE. BUT OVERALL GREAT FOR A QUICK AND EAST APP.

I didn't care for this recipe. I found it messy to make and I didn't like how the cresent roll turned out. I might try it again, but use a different dough! I still think it is a great idea Christi, it just didn't work for me.
