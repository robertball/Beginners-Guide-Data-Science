Need a nifty lunch idea? Tired of your regular ham sandwich? Here you go.  I used a stainless steel tiffin carrier, which kept everything separated. I like that the sandwich doesn’t have any condiments. For the grape salad I used cracked black pepper in place of the vanilla and Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese.  Thank you for the recipe.
