I made two modifications:  1) sauted fresh spinach instead of frozen and 2) added fresh crab.  I enjoyed the recipe, but I think it still lacked some flavor.  But, very simple and easy.  Definitely try it because it is a good base to adjust to your own liking

Love it love it I've made this twice before, but this is the first time I've used fresh spinach. I cooked two pounds of fresh spinach with olive oil and 4 cloves of garlic a little more then the recipe called but it was still great. I also wanted an extra kick so I added extra jalape単os and used the jalape単o cream cheese. Not too spicy just right for our tasting.

So good! I didn't have enough jalapenos so I will make sure I next time.  I also had a shredded parmesan cheese blend and a block of mozerella from other recipes I mixed together. Also used protein cream cheese to add some protein (I ate this for dinner with celery and bread lol).

I used fresh steamed chopped Kale instead of spinach probably 3cups or more. I also substituted no fat Greek yogurt for sour cream. I used 5 jalape単o peppers instead of 10.
