I made this pudding 27 years ago, my first time preparing Thanksgiving.  My sister was visiting and brought the recipe.  We sent our husbands out on Thanksgiving Day to find persimmons!  They finally found them.  It was fantastic, well worth the effort.  I lost the recipe and am happy to have found it again.  Can't wait to make it again.  Although I was a new cook back then, and didn't do a thing beforehand (we ate at 9:00)  still one of my most fun and memorable Thanksgivings!!!

This is the best persimmon pudding I have ever made, or eaten. Growing up with a large persimmon tree in my yard, trust me I have had everything persimmon.  Would not change a thing!

I thought this pudding was 'the best' I have ever tried!  Followed it to a 't' and it came out with amazing consistency, flavor - and the whole family loved.  Very much like my great grandmother's recipe.  Although not many ratings, THIS IS A KEEPER RECIPE!

I have never had persimmon pudding before, but it won't be the last.  I remember my grandfather talking about eating this growing up and how wonderful he thought it was.  If it was anything like this recipe, I can see why.

It is delicious!  I wonâ€™t be using the cream since I made it for someone allergic to milk so I glazed it with melted homey mixed with vanilla and a little brandy. I also used refined coconut oil instead of butter in the cake.

Just made this for a dinner party (last minute), as I had lots of persimmons. We have a persimmon tree, and I am always looking for new recipes. This came out great. I think I was steaming it at more of a boil than a simmer - it was done at closer to 2 hours. I put it on a platter with a foil tent and brought it to my party. It was still warm when dinner was over and was a huge hit! I didn't have time to make the brandy cream sauce, so used some slightly sweetened whipped cream I had already made. Worked great.

Forward to 2018:
My niece actually requested this dish for Christmas this year. Made it again, and it was as delicious as before. What a great persimmon recipe. FYI - I puree ripe Fuyu persimmons in my Vitamix for this recipe. I bet it would work with Hachiya persimmons too.

This pudding is excellent. It's sweet without being sugary or over-done. It's simple and classic and delicious.
