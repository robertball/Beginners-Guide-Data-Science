Though I did things a little different, this recipe looked so good that I really wanted to try it without all the fat content. 

This still came out very good.  I used the recipe for cooking bacon in the oven from this site, bacon for a crowd which I must say I think is wonderful, make sure you use a pan with sides for the drippings, or check out the reviews for some great tips.  Though I do use the thick bacon I think this could do well with thin bacon if the heat is cut back and watched carefully.  I also have used parchment paper and overlap the bacon so it curls less.  Add parchment or foil to the top so it don't splatter.   Heated olive oil in a skillet and browned both sides of chicken then put in oven to finish.  So yummy.  Thanks so much for the post.

This was good.  I have to say, though, that it was an overkill on the cheese and bacon.  I don't 

think it needs the provolone or bacon sprinkled on top.  Stuffing the chicken with muenster and 

bacon was enough for me.  It was also quite spicy.  Not bad spicy, but relatively spicy, so I'd 

probably either not use the hot sauce with the egg or not use the cajun seasoning with the bread 

crumbs.  I made my own cajun seasoning with the Simple Cajun Seasoning recipe from this site.  

 I used turkey bacon, and I didn't like cooking the chicken in the same pan as the bacon. The 

pan was a burned mess (maybe bc I used turkey bacon?) before I transferred to a baking dish (I 

have a skillet that can be put in the oven but I misread the directions).  I'd cook the bacon 

separately next time.  I also think the breading and egg could have been used for 4 chicken 

breasts, not 3.  Overall, I liked it and with less cheese and spice would be excellent.  Thanks for 

the recipe!

Wow.  I don't know where to begin.  I'm giving this 2 stars only because it was SOOOOO SALTY!  This is a heart attack waiting to happen and I had to pull all of the stuffing out to even eat the chicken.  I seriously feel the need to guzzle a gallon of water as I type this.  My face is puckering from all of the salt I just consumed.  However, the basics are good and this could be a nice dish if tweaked.  The salt is completely uncessary due to the salt in the massive amount of bacon called for.  The creole seasoning is also 90% salt.  I will make this again with the following changes.  Completely omit all salt, use 1/2 of the bacon and use smoked gouda instead of whatever cheese is called for in this receipe.  I will also cut the creole seasoning into at LEAST half.   As far as the bread crumbs, use Panko.  MUCH better.    I'm now going to drink a gallon of water and try to recover from my salt attack meal.

I made this recipe as stated and LOVED it!  I did not think it was too cheesy, as we like cheesy at our house.  Everyone agreed it was a keeper.  I little messy and time consuming and calorie loaded, but still good enough to endulge in occasionally.

This is really good!! I skipped the egg and just breaded with crumbs and seasoning. I tripled the recipe and left 1/2 provolone-free (for my son that is picky about gobs of melted cheese - but, like pomplemousse, I did think there was a bit of overkill - it would be fine with "just" the muenster & bacon in the middle). I probably won't make this often because it's kind of messy, time-consuming and deadly fattening, but we really enjoyed it tonight! Thanks for the recipe!

amazing! definitely took others suggestion and didn't add salt. skipped the cajun (ran out) but added a bit of cayenne and Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture. since some cheeses are a bit more pricey, I just used cheddar and a bit of cream cheese that was on hand. It turned out great and my husband says that its a recipe to keep.

I thought the flavors here were great. I took away a star because I made changes to make it more likable. First, I pounded the chicken thin, and rolled it. Second, I season the chicken itself not the breadcrumbs. (also I used italian breadcrumbs and ommited the hot sauce) lastly, I baked these the entire time. Really no need to fry and add even more fat to this.

I have to give this 5 stars because my hubby & kids rated it 10!  However, it does have a kick-I think I'd leave the hot sauce out next time just because I don't feel it really complimented the rest of the flavors. I used 1 1/2 tsp of garlic salt in place of the salt & garlic powder. The muenster completley melted out of the chicken so it was kind of a waste but I disagree that it was cheese overkill. Since the muenster melted, we were left w/just the provolone & it needed more cheese imo. I was hoping for a really rich, cheesy chicken breast & it wasn't. It WAS very good tho! Thank you!

I made this as written with 2 breasts so I could rate it fairly, and that gets a 3 1/2, but easily altered to get a 4 with, as others said, a bit less of everything. There were just so many layers, they competed a bit, I think.  With the rest, we used the same basic concept and ingredients minus the breadcrumbs and egg and less bacon and cheese, stuffed with a bit of both cheeses and bacon and grilled them. The taste was nearly the same, just a preferred way of cooking chicken this time of year. It's a good recipe either way, and adjustable. N*R

Fabulous recipe - try adding mushrooms sliced inside them it's really tasty! Another thing - do not do 2 mins on each side in the pan, they turn out black lol. 45 seconds is what worked for me, but you may find less or more works for you. 45 seconds was my perfect golden-brown time. Thanks again Nikki!

This was soooo good.  I used panko instead of breadcrumbs, so chicken was extra crispy.  Easy and delicious.

this recipe is so good and full of flavor. I have made it as is and I also enjoy using smoked gouda instead of the muenster cheese. I usually cut a pocket in the chicken breast and secure with tooth picks. Thanks for such a yummy recipe.

omg this was good! Used garlic cheese spread instead of the muenster. Made these one night with a girlfriend. It was simple although took a little prep work .. We made a mess in the kitchen (after a glass or two of wine, lol) but had a blast making it! Served with green bean cassarole and garlic bread stix. Will be making again soon!

This was pretty good overall. I only ate half because it is so filling and fairly rich tasting too. I used hickory smoked Muenster cheese and hickory smoked bacon and smoked Provolone cheese. Good flavor in this dish and it was really easy to prepare. My husband and son both made positive comments about this. Thanks!

My DH and the 3 teenage boys loved it. I would increase the hot sauce the next time, we like spicy food. I did'nt cook on the stovetop, just straight onto a hot pan and into the oven.

Ok. I made this dish but I did it my own way. I didn't feel like doing the egg wash & breading. But what I did was made the pocket to stuff the bacon & cheese in it. Seasoned my chicken w/ Lawrys, Mrs. Dash table blend, black pepper & McCormick perfect pinch cajun seasonings.  Let it sit in the seasoning for 30-40mins. Pop it in a baking pan & let it make for 50mins or so. I flipped the breasts over at 20mins. Added another slice of cheese over the top & it tasted amazing.

I tried this recipe with a few tweeks. I followed everything as written until I got to the bread crumbs, I didn't have any so I substituted for french's dried onions, crunched up really fine. I didn't bake the chicken in the same skillet I fried the bacon in, I placed the chicken into a oiled Pyrex dish after semifrying. I didn't have provolone,  so I put the leftover Muenster that I had left on top with the remaining crushed bacon. This recipe was delicious! I wouldn't change anything else, it was nowhere near too salty.

Followed the recipe, but instead of using the oven, I put them on the grill @ 350.  Everyone loved it, and it was appealing to the eye as well!

It made for a nice family dinner. Very cheesy. You look at it and wouldn't expect it to be that spicy, it was a good surprise.

We made this recipe to a T the first time and didn't change a Thing!!! I would recommend going to a save-mart or similar store and getting thick peppered bacon. That just made the thickness of bacon in the chicken taste that much better. Make sure you watch the chicken very closely when cooking the one side in the bacon fat it's very easy to over do it. And last but not least make sure your really stuff the chicken and don't be shy to cut a deep pocket.

This recipe won me an award!! "Best in Show" at "Baconfest 2009" here in Austin! It is truly great and the perfect mix of bacon, cheese and chicken. The spicy kick that the pepper sauce adds is wonderful! Extra bacon and cheese make all the difference in the world!

This tasted awesome! I am a novice cook and while making it, I thought "I will never make this again", because of the time it took to prepare. I did make some healthy changes to the recipe. I did not use the bacon grease I used vegetable oil (didn't have olive oil or I would have used that.) I also didn't use an egg, and I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also omitted the provolone cheese like other reviewers suggested.

Very good.  I didn't use any salt in the bread crumb mix because of the amount of salt in the bacon and bacon grease.  I also sauteed some chopped onions and garlic in the bacon crease and set aside with the bacon to top the chicken with.

All and all- a tasty dish!

This was great! I followed the recipe for the most part,  but had to sub garlic salt (left out the salt) and I was out of dried Parsley.  I did only use 4 slices of bacon since I was only making 2 chicken breasts. My husband and I liked it, but steer clear if your wanting to eat healthy or diet because you’re going to want to savor every bite.

Love this recipe! Only thing I did different was pound out the chicken to about a 1/4 in thick and rolled it up. Thx for sharing!

Would have rated it higher but as written it needed changes as other reviewers suggested. I found the bread crumb mixture was way too much to cover our 3 chicken breasts. I also omitted the salt as others suggested and very glad I did as we didn't miss it. I also made my own Cajun seasoning and cut back on the amount of hot pepper sauce only because I don't like overly spiced foods. I couldn't find Muenster cheese in our area so took a suggestion from the cheese store to try a Saint Paulin cheese instead. Well worth the work for this dish. Served with steamed vegetables.

This was my first time using Muenster cheese and it was great! I have to say that I forgot to top the breasts with cheese and bacon, but it was still REALLY good! Also added mozzarella to the provolone and muenster and it was very good.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this. We make it all the time. The only thing we don't do is top with cheese, and we use whatever cheese we want to stuff (He likes havarti, I like swiss) and it turns out great. Thank you very much for one of our favourite meals!

This is great and seasoned perfectly!  I have to agree with some others that extra cheese and bacon is a little bit of an overkill.  But overall this was fantastic.
