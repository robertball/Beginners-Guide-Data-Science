I read all of the reviews before I made this and followed some of the advice.  First I doubled the batch 'cause I have a big family to feed.  Then I added a can of crabmeat and reduced the shrimp to 1 1/2 c.  I sauteed the shrimp in some garlic and butter first.  finally, I added about 3/4 c. sour cream.  It became the best artichoke dip I ever ate!  And my family agreed!

This dip is very good, although I think you might get a little more "seafood" flavor by using crabmeat. The shrimp added some texture, but there was very little flavor. I'll definitely make the dip again, with a little fine tuning.

I added a few more things to make this even better, a squeeze of 1/2 lemon, few dashes of worchester sauce and 1 teaspoon of Old Bay.  Plus take 1/3 to 1/2 of the shrimp,add in with mayo and parmesan cheese in food processor, this will bring the shrimp flavor through out the dip. Served w/ warmed pita bread.

LOVE THIS DIP!  I have served it at least five times at different events and have received raves everytime.  I do add crab meat along with the shrimp and I tend to add a bit more cheese...mixing the cheese types depending on my mood.  Excellent recipe!

Honestly, I didn't really like this recipe as is.  I made one small batch to taste it, and after tasting it decided to try adding about 3/4 cup of sour cream (to a doubled recipe).  It turned out REALLY GOOD!  That would be my only suggestion.  I sent it to a party with a friend, and when I arrived later, I was met at the door by three people asking for the recipe (before they even knew my name!)

Looking forward to having this again!  Was very good/huge hit at party, though I did tweak it a bit.  1) Sauteed shrimp in butter, Old Bay, minced garlic till JUST done, chopped coarsely. 2) Used cheeses in fridge -- 1C triple cheddar, 1C pizza mix and grated fresh asiago. 3) Coarsely chopped artichokes. 4) Mixture (prior to adding shrimp) looked dry so added @ 1/3+/- sour cream to moisten.  5) Omitted garlic salt -- plenty salty with OB.  THIS WAS GOOD!!!!!

This was SO good, I added roasted jalapenos and  some hot sauce along with a blend of cheeses.....about a cup more  but I used less parm then stated. Turned out great , I will be making this regularly.

This dip was polished off at a party in about 5 minutes.  People were raving about it.
Based on prior reviews, I added some sour cream (1/3 - 1/2 cup), red pepper flakes, and tabasco.  I used good Vermont cheddar, and fresh garlic + salt instead of garlic salt.  A real winner.

This dip is fantastic! I followed other reviewers advice and added a can of crab to a doubled recipe and sauteed the shrimp in butter and garlic. I also added the 2/3 cup sour cream. Wonderful! I have two large batches waiting to be cooked up tomorrow for Thanksgiving. My husband and I already polished off the small sampling I made for us tonight in about three seconds! Thank you for the great recipe!

This was so easy and tasted AWESOME! I didn't measure anything exactly, just eye-balled it.  I didn't have green onions so I grated some white instead.  I also threw in a diced fresh jalepeno (seeds removed) for a little kick.  Will definitely make again for sure!

I made this for a little get together, and every last bite was gone.  I chopped up the shrimp and artichoke, and added just a little more of everything that the recipe called for.  Quick and easy!

This was a very good seafood dip. I did as Lynn suggested and whipped half the shrimp with the mayo in the food processor (I doubled the shrimp amount as well). I also added Tabasco and Old Bay because we like it a little spicy. Great recipe.

I made this exactly as written and we thought it was a little salty. Next time I make it I will probably sub garlic powder for the garlic salt. Thanks!

Took this to a Twelfth Night party last weekend, and the dish was CLEANED OUT!!!! It was a smash hit, and half the folks at the party asked for the recipe. :-) I boiled my shrimp in a little crab boil before adding to the dip, coarsely chopped the artichokes, and used sour cream in place of mayo. I also had a brainstorm that you could almost use this as an entree; just toss it over some noodles. YUMMMM!!!

I made this as an appitizer for Thanksgiving this year. My entire family LOVED it! They did not even leave a drop left. I put out some Melba toasts so they can put the dip on. It was such a hit, that everyone asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Make this everytime I entertain!  I do a couple of modifications however.  Substitute the shrimp w/ (1) 6 1/2 oz. can of lump crab meat and add a squeeze of lemon after baking. Secondly, 86 the Chedder and replace with a 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend.  Dee-lish! Great w/ white corn tortilla chips, Chicago Flats plain flatbread crackers, or blue corn tortilla chips.

This was an absolute hit at a party last night...I popped it into the oven just as everyone was arriving.  Within ten minutes, everyone in the house had opened the oven door to see what was smelling so good.  It was gone almost immediately.  I followed the directions almost exactly, except I used marinated artichokes and added 1/4 cup of mozzarella.  My only "problem" was that no one could taste the shrimp.  Next  time, and there *will* definately be a next time, I'll use some highly seasoned shrimp that I've steamed myself...see if that will help.  I didn't get ONE BITE!!!

Not great, but has real potential. Try using double the amount of shrimp, and using swiss instead of cheddar.

Wow, this was good. I used quartered artichokes and medium size shrimp. I loved that the shrimp and artichokes were pretty much left whole. I did add a tablespoon or so of sherry wine and chopped garlic. The sauce was just the right consistency. The shrimp is an elegant addition to the standard artichoke. I would not substitue crab unless a seafood dip is what you have in mind.

Fantastic christmas day dip, I added crab meat instead of prawns and served it with cheesy corn chips; already a family favourite.  Thanks :)

Great recipe. Followed it exactly. Next time I'll be sure to use a high quality cheddar cheese as it seemed a bit oily to my taste. Also fresh garlic rather than garlic salt. The cheese has enough salt, and seemed to overwhelm. I served it with peasant bread rather than tortilla chips.

I used chedderjack and monterey jack cheese, added 3/4 cup sour cream and 1 can of crab meat juice and all, everyone loved this dip!  I made it Christmas day and served it with tortilla chips and it tasted even better heated up the next day for snacking!  I only gave it four stars because I did deviate from the original recipe to add some flavor.

This just did not go over well at my party. It was the only thing left over. I thought it was ok but I guess my company thought otherwise.

I used canned crabmeat instead of the shrimp and used a few different kinds of shredded cheese that I had on hand, also sauteed some diced red pepper and decreases the amount of onion. Will be making again!

I'm not that great of a cook so it didn't turn out great but it could be my fault. I didn't think the cheddar belonged. I will try to modify this one to my liking. It tasted better with french bread than salty crackers because its already a bit salty.

Awesome dip.  Everyone loved it.  I had great fresh shrimp, that I boiled with a heavy seasoning of Old Bay.  I think that by doing this it is ok to leave out the crab as others have suggested and still get a great seafood flavor. Will definitely make this a regulat item at dinner parties!

Great dip but I added Old Bay seasoning to the top of this recipe considering it's a seafood dip and I'm from Maryland. It gives the dip a true seafood flavor. Thank you for the recipe!

This is pretty tasty.  I did some of the suggestions in the other reviews, like adding some crabmeat and sour cream.  It does taste much better if you have the patience to wait 10-15 minutes after baking.  I will make it again, but think I will add more garlic and perhaps some chopped Roma tomatoes.

This recipe is awesome! I did modify it some and added other things I love... a can of crab meat, some parsley, fresh garlic, red pepper and red onion, since I had no green onions. I also sauteed the shrimp in garlic and butter before adding to the mixture.

This was very good, although you can't really taste the shrimp. It is a good variation to artichoke dip. I added jack and cheddar cheese because I had it on hand. It was all eaten up, super tasty!

This was yummy, yummy stuff!  I doubled the recipe, except for the artichokes & onion, and added Old Bay and a couple of splashes of lemon juice to the mix.  I baked about 40 minutes and allowed to set up for ten minutes of so before serving.  Sinfully good, my guests loved it.

Used swiss instead of cheddar, and fresh garlic which I sauteed with a chopped vidalia onion.  Does not need salt if you are using good parm.  Easy dish that everyone (especially dieters who know how BAD this is) gobbled it up!

I should have made a double batch. at a 4th of July party it was gone in 10 minutes. And i had to print out 5 copies of the recipe for family and friends. I made a few changes and changed some of the measurements, but I will absolutely be making this one again.

This was a GREAT recipe that I will make again and again. I added mozzarella cheese, and it was wonderful! Definitely add crab meat for seafood flavor. Found that it works well with toasted bagguette bread instead of tortilla chips too.

Was looking for something different so I made this and it turned out great. Making a double batch next weekend for super bowl party. I used crab meat instead of shrimp. Next go round I'll probably add some cayenne pepper or tony chachere's for more of a kick

I've made this recipe twice already and I always hate running out. The second time I made it I decided to add crab meat along with the shrimp and it was amazing!!!

Simple yet delicious.  I used baby shrimp & added a little red pepper flake & black pepper to give it a kick.  Will be making this again & again.  Thanks for sharing Kat.

I added lobster, crab, and spinach. I only used  2 tblspns of mayo and 8 oz of sour cream. This was so delicious. My guests loved it.

Very good. That much mayo made it a bit oily so halving it with sour cream made it much better

I modified the recipe slightly. I used crushed two cloves of fresh garlic and did not use the garlic salt. No additional salt is needed in this recipe. It was wonderful!

Made for a Christmas Eve app.  The dip is really good, the reason I gave 4 stars as opposed to 5 is for one reason.  When making this I strongly advise that you cut down on the cheese(first and last time I will probably ever recommend less cheese!) The reason I say this is I feel that the cheese somewhat overwhelms the taste of the shrimp. Will make again!

Added 3/4 c sour cream and a garlic clove. Make sure to let the artichoke hearts drain for some time before combining, or the dip will be runny.

This was an okay dip. I added some hot sauce to mine, but kept to the recipe other than that. I wasn't very impressed. There was an awful lot of this dip left over.

I've made this several times and its always a huge hit.  No changes needed.  Its pretty if you butterfly some shrimp and lay them across the top of the dip    :)

This was just ok for me. It wasn't "bad" by any stretch. I served this at a football party, and everyone tasted it, but I noticed everyone went for all the other dips and appetizers when going back for seconds (and thirds), and left this dip alone after one taste. I'm sure using crab instead of shrimp would have helped or maybe a combination, but nothing about it made me or anyone else say "wow I want more." It was just ok.

i used crab instead of shrimp and it tasted great; the only thing was mine never turned golden brown or bubbly at the end of the baking time- it was really thick which in turn was a pain when trying to scoop it onto tortilla chips but got rave reviews from my guests so i'll definitely do it again!

I used mozz instead of parm (it is what I had on hand). I cooked this and then put it in a small crock pot. I also added a little sour cream to it per other reviewers. It didn't get rave reviews on Father's Day, and it didn't disappear, but I thought it was good nonetheless. This is one of those recipes for the things that I had on hand! Oh, and I didn't add garlic salt, just garlic powder...it is already salty enough from the cheese, mayo, etc.

This recipe is very good.  The amount of shrimp can be tampered with a little.  Im not quite sure if the cheddar cheese suits it but it doesnt taste too bad.  excellent work

I've made this for several occasions and it is ALWAYS a hit!  The only change I made is adding a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese.  I serve it with toasted french baguette.

I have made this three times now, and have loved it every time!  The only tip I can give you is to let it cook about 15 minutes longer than called for and let it sit for a while to come to room temperature.  It tastes more flavorful that way!

Yummy dip and adaptable, e.g., Asagio cheese can be used instead of Parmesan.  It can also be made with Finnish Lappi cheese, a cheese that most lactose intolerant persons can handle.  I found the other reviews very helpful - shrimp and crab are a tasty combo here.
