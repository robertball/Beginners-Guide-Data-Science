Although I skip the whole step with the milk and don't bother with the livers going in and out of the pan more than once, this pate is far superior to any I've made before.  I've been taking it to parties over the last few months because after the first try all my friends requested it.  A chef trained in classical French method told me it was the best she'd ever had.    Thanks Jo!

Very good!  The second time I made it I used fresh sage because it was all I hade and that was tasty too. The capers seem to make the difference.

I'm happy to be the first to review this recipe because it was fabulous! I have a weakness for pate and this did not disappoint! The addition of wine and capers gave the pate a wonderful flavor. Thank you so much! YUM!

This a very good all around chicken pate recipe. I have made a lot of different types. I think most people would like this recipe. I added some fresh lemon juice, just my preference.

Wow; Wow; Wow. What can I say this is a dynamite recipe. From a man's perspective with the usual 2 left thumbs this was easy to make and tastes out of this world. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Perhaps this would qualify as "Man Tested" Regards Peter

THIS PATE IS FAB-U-LOSO!! I have a keen appreciation for pate and this recipe does not disapoint.  

I made certain to soak the livers for several hours (at least 4) in milk and it's very important not to rinse before adding to the skillet.  Also, very important to use a good wine as the flavor will be concentrated.  Crappy wine = crappy flavor.

I've made this dish with pork livers as well, and while it was also excellent, I personally perfer the flavor of chicken livers as opposed to pork.  

I've shared this recipe with several of my family and friends and they too claim its the best and easiest (least involved) pate they've made.

Good job!  Gold stars all around!

This is ALMOST as good as 'Fritz's Pate' from the Nero Wolfe cookbook and costs about one tenth as much. It'll be my 'go-to' recipe for all but the very most festive occasions.

Love this recipe but I did change it a little...deglazed the pan with brandy instead of wine and, after I cooled the liver mixture I added 2 tsp. of brandy and 1/4 cup of cold butter to the food processor. Makes a beautiful smooth texture, adds creaminess and a hint of brandy flavour.Grand Marnier instead of brandy also works well.

This is the most delicious pate I have ever eaten.  I made it to be used in a Beef Wellington recipe.  It made the Wellington wonderful and the leftover pate was a big hit.

Much too much thyme and rosemary for my taste, and too sweet.  My wine could be partly to blame, but I think the recipe needs a lot of fiddling.  Also, I haven't made pate before, but it's pretty grey.

This was alright. I love pate, and usually just wing it. This is the first time I have really followed a recipe for it. I had some problems not getting it smooth enough and had to push it through a metal strainer. I added lemon juice, which I love in pate. I love onions, but for me they were too strong in this recipe. Thank you, though for posting this recipe.

I am a huge fan of pate, both smooth and rough, but have never made it before. I found this recipe, read the reviews, which is always preliminary, and boy oh boy, was this one fantastic! Great job, Jo! If you have a recipe for the rough pate, please do share!!!

I really wanted to put some pate in my Thanksgiving stuffing this year, so imagine my disappointment when my supermarket was so overtaken by turkeys that the chicken livers were out of sight! So I used my turkey's liver, after soaking it in milk twice for 2 hours. I think I technically fourthed the recipe because I didn't have a lot of liver.

Other than that, awesome, especially on top of cream cheese! I would urge anyone who is trying to get or get someone into liver to do this. I will definitely be making this again.

My first review in a while but just had to on this one - Ended up soaking livers in milk overnight since I ran out of time to cook evening before, threw in bay leaves with that. Used 1 yellow onion (like yellow instead of white for more subtle taste) and was all I had. Used generous dash of dried herbs listed (all I had on hand) again I didn’t have any white wine already opened, subbed red instead AND threw in glub of VSOP cognac because that’s how my French friends friends roll (add it often to give bit more depth) did w everything in 1 pan- didn’t remove livers but did have to add more time for the reduction due to extra liquor and added soaking in milk. Added capers, salt / pepper, used immersion blender. Licked the bowl and spoon. Plan on serving on top of some sort of thin smoked bread from the grill drizzled with pickled veggies (beets, cornichons(sp?) maybe few capers, sliced picked onions or whatever I can find). And of course a nice red Pinot or whatever you fancy depending on the time of year! This is so great thank you for this recipe I ?? it!

I just use this as a guide.  I used all fresh herbs added sage & oregano. Did not pull the livers out. I poached them in the wine and then I reduced the liquid.  No extra salt added.  Amazing.

It was great! Everyone loved it. I soaked it in milk over night, and cooked it with the wine in the skillet.
