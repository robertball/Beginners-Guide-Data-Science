To make these taste more like KitKats, I leave out the butterscotch chips and sub milk chocolate chips. Use Waverly (rectangular) crackers and remember to press down lightly on each layer as you assemble. Yummy! Thanks Dee.

Wonderful recipe and these were a huge hit at a recent family reunion.
When boiling the sugars and graham crumbs, keep the heat low to avoid the sugars burning. It will burn quite easily.

I used Keebler crackers which was nice when i was finished because they all lined up perfectly for cutting.  you can see the outline of the crackers through the chocolate and just cut on those marks.  I used the three layers of crackers and thought the chocolate topping was just right for that amount of cracker.  I agree with other reviews, they taste more like a twix than a kit kat.  but very good, they have a mild salty taste that goes well with the chocolate.

Excellent!!  I have to agree w/ the others, it does not taste like a kit kat- i think it's the peanut butter& butterscotch.  Next time I'll try the topping as 1 cup semi sweet chips & 1 cup milk chocolate chips and see if that's closer to the taste.  Good recomendations of others- spray dish w/ pam, have crackers ready in the dish, and refridgerate after assebmling to have it set.  Very easy & very yummy, everyone at my office loved them.  A definate keeper!

These were a hit at my office. Everyone agreed that they weren't a Kit Kat but still really tasty. I used rectangular Keebler ClubÂ® Crackers and the milk/semi-sweet choc. combo as suggested. It seemed like a lot of chocolate as I was pouring it on top but it really needed that thick layer to balanced the bottom layers. Be sure to press the cracker layers together to keep it from being crumbly. I kept them in the fridge for days and  the crackers didn't get soft at all. (Note: I made these again for a different crowd, this time using ritz crackers. The layers didn't stick together and nobody liked them. They were a crumbly mess and crackers were soft on the second day.)

The receipe instructions need to be more clear.  It needs to state in the receipe to already have the crackers in the pan before boiling the ingredients.  If you wait to put the crackers in the pan after the boiling, the liquid becomes hard and the the crackers do not stick and it falls apart when cutting.

This recipe worked well for a surplus of Ritz crackers!  Instead of layering in a 9x13, I took 2 cupcake trays and stuck the ritz in each cup.  Then layered according to directions.  Put them in fridge for about an hour to set.  Popped them out of the cup cake trays (w/ knife), and cut them into quarters.  The only other change I made was that i used ALL semi sweet chips.  Didn't have butterscotch on hand.  Enjoyed these!  But I agree w/ other reviews...don't really taste like a kit kat.  But still worth making!

These are very similar to a recipe in a Paula Deen magazine. And, with all of the ingredients and preparation they just taste like: crackers, chocolate, and brown sugar, definitely not a Kit Kat bar. In addition, they are OVERPOWERINGLY SWEET & RICH! Maybe, it was the butterscotch chips, which I don't care for? But, not a good dessert at all.

Very good....tookt hem to a football party, everyone loved them, but said they tasted like Twix candy bars.  I do not know what they taste like, but they are very very good.  I will make again.  Made three layers, used Pam sprayed on the bottom of pan, pressed down each layer lightly, also used Waverly rectangle crackers, and cooled in the fridge about 1 hour before cutting into bars. Thank you for the great recipe!

I reduced the white sugar to half cup, used club-house type crackers,  and used 2 cups milk chocolate chips (no butterscotch) with peanut butter for the topping.  I give them four starts because I have quite a sweet tooth and enjoy the sweet treat, but my other half only ate half a bar and said they were way too sweet....needless to say they are lasting a long time with just me eating them, but I have been happily nibbling on them for days and they are still crunchy!

Everyone raved over these, especially my nieces and sons! Used the rectangular crackers as in other reviews, I thought they were a little dry, but the longer they sat the better they were. Will make again.

These are delicious!!!  I have made these several times and everyone loves them.  I used Waverly crackers, rectangle in shape which fit better in the pan and I only used 2 sleeves out of a 16 oz. box.  I only used 1 stick of butter.  Next time I will make only half of the topping.

thee are great bars as the recipe says, family loves them. The longer they sit, the better they taste. Made them several times, only suggestion would be to make layers of different crackers-1 of ritz, 1 of brettons crackers-you will not be disappointed trying these

First, let me say...these taste nothing like a Kit Kat Bar, but they are very good.  I took an idea from another reviewer and made these in a silicone lined muffin pan.  They were very easy to assemble, popped right out of the liners, and were perfect individual treats.  They are very rich, a little bite goes a long way.  I also cut the recipe in half and still got 15 muffin sized treats.

I used  saltines instead of butter crackers, and put them in a 9"x9" as the mixture seemed a little small for a 9"x13". Also, I left out the butterscotch/peanut butter and added just a few tbsp of margarine to the chocolate chip mixture! Turned out JUST like a twix!
Not a kitkat, but twix is a happy alternative! Thanks!

Fabulous! Everyone raved about these and asked for the recipe.  Only changes were using Keebler Club crackers as suggested, and I used 2 full cups of chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  Thanks so much Dee!!

These are really good bars. I left out the top layer of the crackers because I like my desserts more on the sweet side (which this one was) and I didn't want the saltiness of the crackers to be too dominant. I had no problems with the caramel hardening. In fact mine was almost too hard to spread. It probably could have done with just 4 minutes of boiling. When they were done, I put them in the freezer to set the chocolate and they were ready to eat after about 30 minutes.

These don't taste like Kit Kats, but are still very good if you like butterscotch! I also used Keebler Club crackers as others suggested and crunchy PB that I had on hand. I put them in the fridge for an hour to cool before cutting, but the chocolate was still too soft. I then put them in the freezer for about 45 minutes - much easier to cut in to. My only problem was that the gooey part seeped below the bottom cracker layer, which caused them to be sticky on the bottom when stacking. I was hoping for a nice cracker bottom.... oh well, still delicious! I would probably rename these as Butterscotch Bars in my recipe book.

These were pretty good. I used all chocolate chips because I didn't have butterscotch and I don't care for it that much anyway. I didn't have enough ritz crackers to make this, so I used the rectangular Keebler crackers instead. Although it tasted great it didn't really taste like a Kit Kat, but who cares if it tastes good! Thanks, will definitely make again because my kids loved it.

This is a recipe I've wanted to make for years; ever since a co-worker made it.  While these cookies are VERY sweet and tasty, I found them to be a mess to cut and store.  My bars never "set" and the caramel filling was runny at room temperature.  Perhaps I didn't boil the caramel mixture long enough.  Because the caramel was so runny, it got under my lowest layer of crackers, causing all of the bars to "melt" and stick together when stored in a tupperware.  I took these to work and brought back almost the entire batch as everyone thought they were too messy to eat.

Delicious, very sweet treat!  I love the caramel layers!  I am not rating these on whether or not they taste like the candy bar it's named after, (they don't), just on how good they taste.  Next time I make these I will not use the butterscotch chips, just to see if I can lessen the richness some.  When I  made these as written I could only eat about a one inch square piece, they are so sweet and rich.  Definitely would make again, just changing for personal preference.

I found these cookies disappointing.  They tasted like sugar layers between crackers.  I couldn't even taste the chocolate.  Storage was a problem as well because the crackers become soft.  Out of the 12 people who tried them, nobody liked them.

It may not taste exactly like the bars, but it has the same layers and appearance and the taste is similar.  My family loved it.  I used Ritz crackers instead of club crackers as others have mentioned.

These are excellent!!  Some people use CLub Crackers in these and call them Club Cracker Bars.  I agree with other reviewers that they don't taste like a Kit Kat, but they are delicious.  I would recommend only using two layers of crackers instead of three.

My kids love these!  I found that if you spray the pan with pam first, (or grease it) they come out much easier.  Cook the mixture in a non stick pan also if you have one (it likes to stick to regular pots)

Yum Yum - not sure if these really taste like Kit Kats, but who cares - they're delicious.  The suggestion by other reviewers to have the first layer of crackers in the pan and the rest "at the ready" is a good one, although I didn't find the graham wafer mixture hardened that quickly.  My whole family enjoyed these bars.

SO GOOD, and VERY SWEET, yum !
two suggestions: spray pan with PAM; refrigerate after assembling.
also, filling "sets" easily after boiling - be prepared to work quickly.

If I were to rate these as copcat Kit Kat bars, they would get a 2.  They taste NOTHING like Kit Kats.  That being said, they are AMAZING as is!  I used all milk chocolate chips because that was all that I had so my review isn't 100% accurate, but made that way, they were delicious and I will most definitely be making them again and again!

Yummy. but be careful with boiling the graham cracker mixture. STIR IT CONSTANTLY - being a dope, I didn't and have a heck of a burnt pan to contend with - I could have used a warning in the recipe.

These are so easy to make and take no time at all.  Instead of 1 cup of semi sweet chips I subed in 1/2 cup and another 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips.  We have made thes 7 times over the past holiday season they go over so well and everyone wants the recipe.

This recipe was pretty good but I would not agree with all the rave reviews.  I agree with everyone else that it tastes nothing like a Kit Kat.  I would also only use two layers of crackers if I were to ever make again.  One reviewer wrote that she added milk to the melted chocolate, DON'T do that, I did and ruined my chocolate, it completely changed the consistency and texture.  I knew that too from past experience but must have forgotten.  Overall these were OK but I really don't think I would make again when there are so many wonderful recipes out there.  Sorry!!!

 This is definitely a very good and sweet recipe. I made it once and am going to make it again for Christmas. You do need to spray the pan with spam or some kind of shortening. I liked the reviews. This really helps.

I thought these were ok, pretty easy to make and taste just fine. I made a few changes based on reviews. I used club crackers instead of Ritz. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar in the caramel. I cooked the mixture on *very* low heat so it didn't really even boil for me. I had a hard time deciding when it was finished. I used milk chocolate chips instead of the mixture of butterscotch and semi-sweet. I put them in the freezer for 45 or so minutes, then cut them into small bars and stored them in the refridgerator. Definitely make sure you spray the pan with Pam. Also, make sure the first layer crackers are already laid out in the pan before you finish the caramel- it's important that you work quickly so that the mixture doesn't harden before you get it on the cracker layers. The women I served them to (as well as my husband) loved them, but I'm just not overly impressed. I would make them again bc they are easy (and actually it's probably best that I don't love them- that way I won't eat them all!).

These are yummy, yummy, yummy!  I use Keebler Club crackers because they line up so nicely in the pan.  My husband isn't too big on sweets, but he's always asking when I'm going to make these again.  I make the recipe exactly as stated (except I grease the pan first).  It's become one of my go-to recipes when I need an easy dessert!

My husband and my brother both love these!  It's their favorite cookie of all that I make for Christmas baking.  Thanks for posting the recipe, I lost mine and had the toughest time finding it again.  Mine was called "Twix bars", I don't think they taste like a twix or a kitkat, but they ARE very good!

These didn't remind me of a Kit Kat.  They were much better.  I tried this because I was looking for something different than the usual cookies, cake, brownies, etc.  I'm glad I tried this.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made these several times and they never fail to please. Everyone loves them- you can serve them to adults at a nice dinner and put on a paper plate to give to kids and they always go fast. Oh- I didn't actually think they tasted like kitkat bars, but regardless of what they taste like, they're delicious.

DEFINATELY not a hit with my family!  For one thing, they were very dissapointing as they taste nothing like kit kat bars.  They were also WAY to sweet!  The crackers in the bottom I found were a strange texture for the crust.
I see from other reviews that many people love these bars, but I, personally, would never make them again.

This recipe turned out to be the hit of our cook out! I used saltines instead of buttery rounds and added a little milk when melting the chips and it turned out wonderful. The peanut butter really adds a kick to this and it is very easy to make. I will make this again and again!

I found that this recipe, although sweet, tasted nothing like the Kit Kat Brand bars they claim to.  The 80 crackers made the "bars" entirely too dry and the filling was nondescript.  They were not at all what I had imagined and I ended up throwing the whole pan away because my family was disappointed and didn't like them at all.

My five year old helped make this with me I used a different cracker since I can't get waverly crackers in the city I live in.  My co-workers couldn't get enough of them, the only comment was that they don't taste like the kit kat bars we have here, but my husband swears that they are just like the ones back home(Alhambra Ca)

I love this non-bake recipe, but I found the chocolate/peanut butter/butterscotch topping to be too thick.  I prefer to halve the amount of this topping.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and I think it tastes great.  My 4 year old daughter just loved it.  I'll be making this again for Christmas but instead of using round crackers, I'll try using the rectangle kind.  Good recipe, Dee.

I mad these yesterday and a 13 by 9 pan didn't make three layers. I made 2. 
They also da KitKat. They were good but not the same taste. 
I refrigerated mine before cutting and they came out of pan fine. 
Next time I will use an 8x8 and that might change the flavor profile

I didn't like it at all, b/c it tasted too much like butterscotch.  I'm definitey wanting to try it without the butterscotch chips, but subbing it with choc chips instead. I think that will make it a lot better.

I didn't have any buttery crackers, so I just used all graham crackers, and I didn't have a ton of those, so I made this in a loaf pan. Doing it that way there was a ton of filling, and left over chocolate topping, but all in all it was still pretty yummy.

These were really simple and easy to make.  I put them in the freezer to cool.  The graham cracker mix was a little tough right after I took it out of the freezer, but I let them sit and they were fine in a couple of minutes.  The crackers stayed crispy, even after you added the graham cracker mix and choco mix

These were ok. I burnt the mixture on the stove right away but did another batch.  Forgot to put pam on the bottom and they were very hard to get out. I think the recipe has too much crackers or something. I suggest trying the recipe for (popularity cookies) on this web site... You won't be disappointed.

Wow! They Are Sweet!  You must have a very sweet tooth for this recipe.  Very similar taste to the peanut rice krispie bars with the chocolate frosting.  Nothing like a kit kat.   Won't make them again.

They do not taste like the Kit Kat candy bar, but they are still very good.  They are a bit messy to eat because of the crumbly bottom layer of crackers.

I think this may be closest I'll ever get to a kitkat bar.  Excellent!  I halved the recipe and I think I still have over 12 servings.  I guess it depends on what one would consider a serving.

My kids love this one!! We made a batch and it was gone in hours!  Get your crackers out and ready tho' cuz you have to work fast once the filling is ready.   Definitely a keeper!

Enjoyed making this w/my niece, but a 
little more envolved than I thought.  She
like it so much though she asked me to 
make it for her to take to school.
Well worth the effort.
