Good, flavorful recipe.  I did not have orange juice so I used the juice of two whole oranges and added a little water so there was enough liquid.  I also added some of the orange pulp to ensure it had enough flavor.  I also did not have canned tomatoes so I used one whole fresh tomato.   Even with my substitutions, this was an easy recipe with great flavor;  I will be making it again.

This was an easy recipe to follow.  The flavor is very subtle.  The changes I made are:  stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning instead of diced tomatoes and I used a whole chicken (fryer).  It took almost 2 hours to make with the whole chicken (I did not cut it into pieces).  I also didn't use the optional alcohol.  The chicken was very tender.

I tweeked this recipe a little. I used tangerines in place of oranges and chopped sweet red pepper in place of pepper flakes. This is by far one of the best chicken dished I've ever maede. And Suuuuper easy.

Another reviewer referred to the flavor as subtle- I'll go one step further and say it's non-existent.  Unfortunately, this is just a really bland dish.
