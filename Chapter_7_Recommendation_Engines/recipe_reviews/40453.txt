Fabulous flavor!  Just the right amount of spice.  I didn't have oyster sauce, and wasn't in the mood to make a trip for it, so I just omitted it, and it was still excellent.  I'm sure it would be even more excellent with all the ingredients.  Served with lemon herb rice and green beans--dinner for two for under 5 bucks.  Can't beat that!

I used small cornish hens, and it didn't quite finish cooking in time. I can't imagine a large cornish hen being done at this temperature in only an hour. That is my only criticism. Otherwise, these make a beautiful presentation, deep warm brown and delicious. The oyster sauce makes the sauce nice and thick and brushable. Possibly, though, these would be done in an hour without opening the oven to baste (I am a frequent baster)... I recommend this recipe, just watch for doneness!

Oops, wasn't paying attention and used Hoisin Sauce-- but it was fantastic! I marinated for about an hour in a big ziplock bag so the color was wonderful before even cooking.  Used 4 hens. I added 30 min. to the cooking but ended up cooking 1-1/2 hours at 350°. TIP: if you bake 4 at once, rotate the whole birds half-way through cooking so both sides are exposed to the same amount of heat. Setting side-by-side the 'inside' halves were underdone, outside halves were perfect.

12/2007 original review
The flavor was good, but it took about an additional 45 min to thoroughly cook the hens.  By the time it was done, I felt like I could have ran to the store and bought something in place of this.  Not sure if I would do again, due to the length of time to cook.  

***11/28/2008 UPDATE***
So I redid this for thanksgiving, ensuring that I followed the recipe and cooked it longer.  The results were AWESOME!!!!  My family could not stop raving about this and requesting this.  This time, I halved each hen, and then soaked the hens overnight in a ziploc to marinate it.  The next day I just threw it in the oven for like 1 hour 45 min.  Let me tell you, these hens were finger licking good..Awesome flavor, taste, texture..Loved it!!!

The marinade for this dish was awesome!  Hens were moist and very tasty, although, I think I will try the marinade on boneless chicken breasts.

This turned out okay. I thought it would have more flavor. It also took 10 extra minutes to cook. Probably won't make it again.

Amazing marinade and so simple to make. The Oyster sauce adds a little sweetness and acts as a thickener. I've also subsituted Hoisin sauce for the oyster sauce with great results. And add 1/2 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice for amazing flavor. I cut the hens in half and marinate them in large ziploc bags for at least 2 hours or more. And grilling this imparts even better flavor.  Great easy weeknight meal yet gorgeous enough for company.  Love it. TIP - I think the oven temp. is way off. When the hens are cut in half, I bake them at 375 degrees for about 40 min. A whole hen takes me about 1 hour. But definitely cook this at higher heat.

Simple and delicious! I must agree with one of the previous reviewers that the hens are not cooked at the end of the hour at 325 degree F. So be prepared to either cook it for longer or raise the oven temperature. I preheated the oven to 350 degree F and the hens turned out beautifully at the end of the hour. They were succulent, tender and not dry at all! I might try this recipe with a few teaspoons of ground ginger next time.

Where to begin!?! These were the best cornish hens we've ever had!  They were so EASY that while doing the dinner dishes I had to call and wake up my sis (who is rather "challenged" in the kitchen) to tell her about these really easy, impressive, and delish' little birdies.  Someone noted economical--well, the hens I got on sale 3 for $5 (bought six), the oyster sauce & tamari (soy) totaled $3.75, jar of minced garlic $2--total dinner with sides 20 bucks.  Thanks for the recipe Phuong!  Lets see some more :)

This is one of the easiest main dishes that I've ever fixed. Was concerned that the soy sauce would make the hens too salty but that didn't happen. Excellent taste and made a lovely presentation at time of serving. I follwed the recipe exactly.  Also very economic to make.

This recipe is fabulous! I thought that maybe using all that soy sauce would make the hens taste really salty but they weren't. They were perfect. I fixed this on Christmas day because we had turkey and ham at other people's houses and it was a huge success. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is an excellent marinade! I deviated from the original a good deal, mainly because I was using it as a marinade for the grouse my dad and I shot on a hunting trip. It was absolutely the best grouse we've ever had, hands down! Now every time he comes home with grouse he asks me to make it this way again. 

Here's what I did: 
First, I didn't have oyster sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce instead, and it was delicious. Then I melted the butter in the microwave and added it to the marinade. Then I put it in a gallon ziplock with the grouse (split and opened flat) and let it marinade for at least 30 minutes.  After it's done marinading, I seared it in a covered nonstick skillet, uncovering to baste with the remainder of the marinade frequently. Game meat can often be dry, but this marinade combined with the frequent basting made it juicy and so flavorful! I don't think I'll make grouse any other way again!

even though the taste was good, i have to give this three stars because after and hour and half of cooking, the hens still weren't all the way done.  I would recommend started the hens out on 350 then the latter half bump up to 375.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Next time I would double the marinade and reserve half of it for basting.  We grilled this instead of baking it and absolutely loved the results!  Will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!  I agree with the other reviews and the cooking time is a little longer than expected.  Recommend double checking the meat temperature (165 for poultry).   Wasn't a problem though because it gave us more time to baste the outside for a fantastic finish!

My sister-in-law made these for Easter dinner and they were outstanding.  Very moist and flavorful.  So good I asked for the recipe and tonight I'm making it but using chix. leg quarters.  When we had these for Easter, the cornish hens were cut in half and it solved the cooking problems as far as not being done in 30 minutes.  They did cook a little longer but still turned out moist and juicy.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this so much had it for weeks, it cooked longer than expected but not a big problem.  
I use the liquid left over to steam my veggies in and it was fabulous, topped with white rice.

I use this marinade but I cook chicken thighs in it.  I'm a big fan of chicken thighs, and when you cook them in this marinade they are phenomenal.  I can't tell you how many times I've made that for people and they ask me for the recipe.  People love it.  I just cook them for 1 hour at 350 degrees.  This marinade is by far my favorite that I've found.

Cornish hens came out very tasty and moist. I did not have the oyster sauce but I used Worcestershire sauce instead as another review did and still came out great!

This was great; made it for Valentine's Day dinner with lobster tails and mashed potatoes. My family is Chinese and we use oyster sauce in pretty much everything so I already had it just sitting in the fridge.

OK. I didn't think the soy and oyster sauces added much even after marinating for 45 minutes.

I had never cooked a cornish hen before but this recipe seemed simple enough so I picked it...and I am SO glad I did! The flavor was great! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and buttered green beans and my husband and I devoured it all! The only thing I did differently was I added the 2 tbls of butter to the marinade (by accident) and then I used 2 more later on like the recipe called for. I will definately be making this again!

This was a very easy recipe and very delicious!  I used nonfat "butter" spray instead of the butter - still browned beautifully!  I would definately make this again with other cuts of meat.

Very Verv good!!!!!  I used my injector to infused some of the mixture into the birds, also I grilled them over wood coals, using indirect heat to a temp of 180 degrees, very moist and tender birds.

Very easy. Very Yummy!  Didn't have oyster sauce and didn't feel like going out. I cooked 5 birds and just doubled the recipe.  I did increase the cooking time as other suggested. Did an hour at 350 covered, then 45 minutes uncovered with the butter and basing.  Everyone raved! The kids loved it. I'll be using this marinade again!

As with many other reviews, this needs more cooking time.  Doubled everything and made 4 birds.  Initially added 10 extra mins on 325 and 20 extra mins on 350 and basted only 3 times but that was not enough.  Put the birds back in 350 for 30 more mins, perfectly tender and juicy!

Reminded us of the ducks in Chinatown...took us longer to cook since we basted quite often. Our 6 year old ate the whole hen, it was that good.

This was a pretty good recipe - liked by the entire family.  I LOVED how the cornish hens browned...they looked beautiful - 5star restaurant-quality presentation.  I didn't especially like the oyster sauce flavor, but the hens were very moist.  I took the advice of many commenters and added Chinese 5spice, olive oil; cut the hens in half before cooking; marinated them 3 hours in ziploc bags in the fridge.  Cooked this with the following menu:  Zucchini & Tomato Bowtie Pasta, Seafood Quiche...and Watermelon.  :-)

This is a great basic easy Cornish Hen recipe. I make it exactly as printed and it was great. I did make it a second time and after the 30 min. in the oven I transfered the hens to the grill on low heat to finish them. Very good grilled.

This was really great!  I cooked it covered for 60 minutes then another 20 uncovered.  I also added 1 tsp. of minced ginger and drizzled olive oil over the chicken.  It came out nice and juicy.

Had pretty high hopes for this, but was sadly disappointed. Tastes just like chicken with soy sauce. Pretty salty, so perhaps using the reduced sodium style would work better. The soy and oyster sauce are both salt elements, so I'd probably add some brown sugar or honey for some sweetness. I cut the hens in half (as seen in the picture, but not in the recipe) for more consistent cooking. Hubs ate two halves, which is the reason for the four stars. If I were going on my review alone, it'd be three. Garnished with green onions and served with rice and Garlic Vegetable Saute (recipe to be published).

Pretty good - I substituted Hoisin Sauce for Oyster since that's all I had on hand.  I also upped the garlic to 4 cloves and marinaded the cut up hens overnight.  It was way too hot to turn on the oven so I grilled these over medium indirect heat for about 30 minutes.  The hens were very moist and had a nice mild flavor to them.

This was soooo easy! I used "lite" soy sauce instead of the regular because I was concerned about to much sodium...I added paprika once I took the foil off to help with the browning...this was a hit at my house and so totally easy! Thanks for sharing.. I will be using this again and again :0)

Cornish hens have become a traditional Christmas dinner for my family. This recipe was awesome!  I marinated the hens overnight.  My family gathered on Boxing day, and I served the roasted hens with rice, green beans sauted with onions in peanut oil, and the drippings straight from the pan.  absolutely delicious. My family literally licked their chops.

This recipe is very good.  I made the recipe exactly except that I added about a tsp of Paprika to the marinade.  I also split the chickens in half and marinaded them for about 4-5 hrs.  The chickens came out very tasty!  I will use this recipe again!

Excellent recipe.  Good flavor and great presentation.  Hens were moist and tender; however, the time they have listed is incorrect, I ended up cooking mine about an extra 20-30 minutes and if I hadn't they would have bled red! I served with fresh green beans, wild rice, and a packet of summer vegetables. 
Great dish for a Sunday Dinner.

This is the first time I baked hens and it turned out great! My friends loved this dish. When I was mixing the marinade I added about a tablespoon of sugar as well as about a table spoon of honey. During the last 15 minutes of bake time I coated the hens with honey and it gave it a nice glazed taste to the first bite!

This is a good recipe.  I added 2 tsp of sugar to sweeten it up a bit and cooked them whole @ 350 for 60 minutes covered and another 15-20 uncovered. Please note I was basting the cxns for the last 15-20 minutes.  The sauce is good over white rice.

This is delicious, but everyone is right about the cooking time.  I cut my hens in half and they still weren't done after the hour.  You definitely need to cook this longer.  Mine I put in for an addition 10 minutes and that was good enough.  The marinade is spot on though!

Easy and great tasting. We cooked this dish as a substitute for turkey on Thanksgiving. The only thing we’d caution people about is the cook time. The dark meat was just a bit underdone. So, you might add 10-15 mins to the second half of cooking. Otherwise, great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

The sauce was delicious with the mirin sauce I use instead of oyster sauce. I only had 2 hens so I cut them in half also to cut down cooking time, I prepped and marinated while at work about 9 hours and cooked them after didn't take long about 90mins. Started off @350 for 30mins as recipe stated. Left them covered @375 until the last 15mins while basting frequently. I would use this recipe again !

I followed the recipe exactly except that I cooked them for 1.5 hours at 325 for half an hour and then raised the temperature to 350 for another hour.  They were perfect and everybody loved them.

Loved it, very delicious. Did substitute fish sauce for oyster sauce and it worked out fine. Added a tablespoon of sugar to juices at end of cook, deglazed the pan and used as a nice sauce for rice.

I did not have oyster sauce nor garlic nor butter at home so I used honey and Chinese "Lao Gan Ma" sauce and vegetable oil. It ended up great! Don't focus too much the actual indigents as long as you have the soy sauce. The way of cooking was what made the hens shined!
One thing is, I used regular gas oven so the temp or timing caused a little undercooked. It may be the size of the cornish hens too. I added more time and it was okay. Something to watch for.

This was a great recipe. I made it for our anniversary dinner and he loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as listed. The only thing I would change would be to maybe poke a few holes in the hen to give it some of the marinade flavour. Besides that, it was perfect!

This was really good!  Cut the hens in half and marinated them overnight.  Basted them every 10 minutes during the uncovered roasting phase.  Mmm good!  The oyster sauce has a strong flavor.

This was a huge hit for our Thanksgiving meal!  Like others used 4 small hens, cut them in half, and let them marinate for an hour or so.  We will definitely put this dish in our rotation.

So yummy and easy to make. I didn't have oyster sauce but it was still delicious without it. I used 2 small hens and I did have to cook it about 10 min more but it came out juicy and perfect. I like the skin a nice toasty brown so I did broil the top for 5 min.  So I'd would just watch the temp I basted every 6 min.

Fantastic recipe for flavorful Cornish Hens! I split two hens down the middle. I placed the four pieces with the marinade overnight and baked for about 1 hr. and 20 minutes. And, based the hens as the recipes instructs. I served it with rice pilaf and vegetables. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thank you for sharing it with the cooking community!

A very easy and flavorful recipe.  I followed some of the reviewers ideas and sliced the hen in half, put the marinade in a plastic bag with the hen, and refrigerated for 30 minutes.  I also increased the oven temp to 375 and cooked 30 minutes on each side.  I like my meat well done, and it came out a nice darkened brown which was delicious!

It was very easy to make. Lived the sauce that came out very tasty and flavorful. Cooking time has to be longer and keep it covered longer so it's juicy. I will be making this again and I will use a crockpot next time because it was a little dry

I made this for my husband  just as the recipe said. Only suggestion I have is to cook a little longer the second time around. I'm no chef, but even on the Cornish Game Hen package it stated to cook longer than this recipe. My husband said he'd eat this again! That's a win in my book.

This is such a delicious and simple recipe! I did not have the oyster sauce on hand. I did replace it with a1 steak sauce just because I thought it may add some extra boldness to it. It turned out great. Even my 3 year old enjoyed it and didn't ask for any dipping sauces which deserves 5 stars just for that!

This was the first time I have ever made Cornish Hens. I followed the recipe to a T and my family loved it! They loved it so much it is now our family tradition to make this every year for our Christmas diner. I served it with corn, classic rice pilaf (recipe by Chef John can be found on this web sight), roll and green bean casserole.

This recipe is excellent. I had never made Cornish hens before, and I'm so glad I made them this way. I basted every 5 minutes after uncovering the pan and they were super juicy and flavorful. I used low sodium soy sauce and they were plenty salty. I did need to cook them an extra 10 minutes, but just use an instant thermometer (cook to at least 165 F) and you are sure to get some wonderful results!

Good flavor, but not enough cooking time.  I had small hens and they were not at all done after the allotted time.  Plan on having to cook them much longer and you'll be okay.

Great recipe! I will definately use this recipe again in the future.  I used a young chicken instead of the cornish hen. I also added hoisin sauce to the marinade too.

Great Recipe! i used garlic powder didn't have any cloves, otherwise followed the recipe to the T.  I would recommend not skipping the oyster sauce it pairs really well with the soy sauce.  Basted it quite a bit, meat turned out nice and juicy and tender.

These turned out really good.  I cut them in half and baked them until done then removed the tin foil and broiled till golden brown.  The rosemary gave them a wonderful flavor and the chicken salad made with the leftovers was great too.

This recipe has a great flavor, however, I must recommend increasing the cooking time and/or the cooking temperature. I made these according to the recipe and they took positively forever to get done, all the while making the breast very dry. I'm sure the problems can be fixed the next time with little alteration, and the recipe was delicious, minus the previously mentioned flaws.

This was an easy recipe with pretty good flavor but nothing to write home about.  In all fairness, I did not have oyster sauce so used Hoisin Sauce based on another review.  I only had 1/4 low sodium soy sauce and used 4 cloves of garlic. I likely would not make again.

tasty but you forgot to say when to add the 2nd half of the butter, I cooked 1 more cornish hen than th recipe said and it took at least 45 min more to cook.  Maybe I basted it too frequently?   And I know it's not your fault but my thighs said 170-75 so I thought it was done but as I bit into the drumstick, it was completely raw in the middle.  I guess trussing the hens would've been a good idea.

Very, very tasty. I had a big jar of oyster sauce and was looking for recipes to use it on. I split the cornish hen down the middle with a cleaver and marinated it for about 8 hrs. Cooked it about 40 min. at 325 then grilled it for 15 min. Also put a glaze called cheriyaki on last 10 min. Turned out great.

I put it in the marinade for about 6 hours and needed to cook it about 30 minutes longer than the recipe states.  Flavor is good, just not strong enough.  Maybe if you marinade overnight it would give all of the meat the flavor instead of just the outside edge.
