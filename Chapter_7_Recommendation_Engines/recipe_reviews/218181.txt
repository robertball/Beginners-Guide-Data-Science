I love this salad. Delicious and nutritious. If you don't have marinated mushrooms on hand, they can be skipped. The really clutch ingredients are beets, potato, carrots onion, pickles, peas, and oil. But all the other ingredients add their own flavor to the dish. Very good!

My mom makes a version of this that's very similar, a little simpler, and still very good. She adds a little lemon juice and uses olive oil. She also adds bacon bits for a little crunch... they actually compliment the recipe quite well!

One main ingredient not listed here that my mom includes is sauerkraut. A couple cans of this really makes this recipe complete, but that's just my opinion. This also adds that vinegar flavor that viniagrette is known for.

Another trick is to boil the beets alone before adding the potato. In my experience, it's taken the beets up to an hour to be fully cooked. I use a taller pan and simmer it covered. I add the potato maybe 20 minutes into boiling. 

Another tip about beets: you know they're cooked when you can insert a sharp knife in and out of the beet with no resistance. I remove the peels before the beets are cool because it comes off much easier for me.

Not a big fan.  This salad takes too many ingredients which makes it for a very long preparation process and the ingredients don't necessarily go well together.  The salad tasted fine overall but not worth the time it takes to prepare.

I have been wanting to make more recipes from my heritage and this sounded really good.  However, more seasoning and oil is in order here.  Also, I do not like the texture of the marinated mushrooms in this dish.  The recipe does make a good amount, and we intend to eat it and not waste it, but this recipe is certainly not my favorite.

The pickles added quite a contrast to the vegetables.  It
s a very colorful salad.  The dill sprig makes a delightful garnish!  I'll be making this again.

It was refreshing and delicious, and made a great side dish with some pirogies, but it would pair well with many things. only four stars because I thought it needed a bit more seasoning/pickling element than called for, but it was great.

I've made this several times as written and found it very, very good. The only thing is that it makes a huge quantity, more than my husband and I can get through. Now I make it when I'm going to a potluck, so that we can have the right amount at home too. TFTR!
