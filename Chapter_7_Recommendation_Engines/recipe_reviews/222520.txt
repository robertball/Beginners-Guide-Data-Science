Made this for a family bbq and other than the cold lemonade the kids drank, this one was THE choice for all the adults. Everyone loved it!I especially liked that it was so simple to make and tasted great. I also like that it didn't have any brandy in it like a more traditional Sangria since I am not a big fan of brandy. I used lots of cut-up oranges and peaches and raspberries and a few sliced apples too. Will be making again for future large group gatherings.

As the recipe is written, not enough fruit for 5 bottles of wine. And 6 fl. oz. of sparkling water in FIVE bottles of wine, Why bother? The proportions are way off. Find a better recipe.

I served this at a bridal shower and everyone enjoyed it.  I left out the sugar entirely and instead poured in half a bottle of none-alcoholic margarita mix and some lemon infused sparkling water.  I froze some grapes and added those - had to keep topping it up so what we ended up with at the end was anyone's guess but the original was delicious and so refreshing!
