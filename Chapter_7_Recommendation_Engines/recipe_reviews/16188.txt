Three cheers Peter! We loved this but I did make a few changes: First, I halved the recipe. Second, while browning the onions/garlic/beef, I added a good dash of all-season salt. Then, when it came time to add the beans/tomatoes, I omitted the kidney beans (none available) BUT I added a 15oz can of tomato sauce, and a couple good shakes of paprika and cumin. Once you let this simmer - it thickens nicely and the flavors are GREAT! We didn't serve over rice b/c we thought it was great w/out it BUT we did sprinkle some sharp cheddar cheese over our bowls to melt. Great recipe and with the small changes I made - I will definately make this again...esspecially at our cabin this fall! Good & hearty! Thanks!

Added some seasonings for personal preference and stopped short of adding the rice. Good flavor.

I love this recipe - simple, and versatile: witness the variations mentioned in various reviews here. It produces a rich and thick chili, with just the right flavor that you can spice up - or not - according to your taste. For me, it's great as is. It's also great when I decide to spice it up and make it hot with some hot sauce and hot pepper flakes. It's a great treat that can be adapted to anyone's taste. Bravo! I love it and encourage everyone to try it!

I have made this three times now at home in my crock pot and boy is it a favorite to everyone.  It is easy to prepare and make and it tastes great too.  Great recipe.  I recommend it highly.

It is ok.  I have had better. Granted I changed the recipe a little.  I didn't put in as much onion, cause I thought that three onions sounded like a lot.  And I cut back on the chili powder as well, knowing that my 4 year old would probably want to try it at some point.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have any pork and beans, so I added baked beans instead. I liked the taste, but my husband didn't.

I happened to have some pork and beans around the house and didn't know what to do with them because they don't taste that great out of the can.  So I followed this recipe and made chili for the first time.  It was so good!  The only downside is that the recipe produces a bland chili, so I added extra red pepper powder, cumin, cocoa, cinnamon, and paprika.

Wasn't well liked by our family.  The baked beans were too sweet.

Had this along with grilled hotdogs. It was great. I added more tomatoes and paste. I also added a couple hot dried peppers, to put a bit more spice to it.Very Good!T. J.

Really tasty, I didn't serve it over rice but instead served it in a sour dough bowl and it was a BIG hit in my household.

It was good, not great.  If you want spice, throw in a couple hot peppers.  Bland but good.

My family and myself always eat allot of chili, but this recipe gave it a different twist. My wife and my daughter could not get enough of it on their first serving. We finished up the chili in one night. Excellent Chili

Wow. So good. I added in a chopped jalapeno pepper. Very nice.
