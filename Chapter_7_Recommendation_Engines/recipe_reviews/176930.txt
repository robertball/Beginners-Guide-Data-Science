Awesome. Great combination of flavors - one I have never thought of. I over-toasted my bread a little, but it didn't end up mattering once I got the yummy topping on it. Thanks so much for the recipe, CrdsGrl! Congrats on getting your recipe published, it's a good one! :)

Just prepped all the ingredients to make for a small gathering this afternoon...popped 2 under the broiler to test...Mmmmm, they are WONDERFUL...perfect for this fall day...I used feta cheese and granny smith apples...UPDATE: 5 guests loved this bruschetta...1 didn't because she only likes American Cheese...still gets 5 stars...

Delicious! Obviously not everyone knows how to correctly follow a recipe, since it turns out wonderfully if you READ THE DIRECTIONS. I agree that AR members don't leave nasty reviews. Keep up the good work!

Tasty flavor combination and very easy to make.  I would have never thought of this flavor combo.  These bruschetta definitely taste best right out of the oven.  The apples on my first batch started to brown a bit after sitting for 30 minutes.  For my second batch, I did a quick rinse of the apples in lemon water (1/2 lemon juice squeezed into large bowl of water) - no browning and the flavor did not change. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Drizzling some honey over the bruschetta before you serve it takes this to a whole new level.

I also made this recipe last night! i must say it was very very very good. I didnt have quite enough goat cheese as the recipe called for (I guess I ate to much of it snacking!) but i had a little nub of brie that needed to be used so i threw that in as well. FAB to the LOUS. I am making them tomorrow for my hubby to take to work. Would this be good with other fuits- pears? Thanks!

Brie worked surprisingly well as a substitute for goat cheese! Instead of mixing it in, I just spread the brie on the bread and poured the cheeseless mixture on top of it. Delicious.

This is an interesting flavor combination... but it just lacked something in my opinion. I wasn't a fan of the sweet with the goat cheese, so perhaps that was my issue. By no means was it bad... it just didn't rock my socks off.

My youngest daughter Tyler and I are goat cheese freaks so I just had to give this one a try. Ty and I are both allergic to apples so I used pears instead and replaced the dried herbs with fresh as I wanted a more delicate flavor. Once out of the oven, I lightly drizzled balsamic over the bread. Wonderful and thank you for a terrific appy recipe!

Outstanding, my BF ask how could someone rate this as not good tasting.  Cheese and apples, how can you go wrong.  The herbs just put it over the top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a really delicious and simple appetizer.  It seemed much fancier than it actually was, and it definitely didn't taste like there were so few ingredients in it!  The only change that I made was sprinkling a little bit of olive oil over the bread before I toasted it on parchment paper since I liked my crostini that way.  This will definitely be a recipe that is going into my rotation!

I found the flavor combination odd.  Didn't care for the black pepper with the apple.  I used Brie but I really don't think I would feel any different had I used goat cheese.  I like the idea of using apples in bruschetta but this is just not what I was looking for.

This was okay-a little on the dry side. Next time I will  use the block of goat cheese rather than the crumbled goat cheese.

Pretty good. These were hard to eat though, maybe I needed to use thinner bread.

I LOVE this combination of the goat cheese, apples, and herbs.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried (*Gasp!*  I know!), but it was still very nice.  Bf wasn't as thrilled with the combo, and he was happier with his brussel sprouts, but that's his problem.  I really liked this, and now the leftovers are all mine!  :D  I used jonagold apples (only type in the house right now), which are a mild, slightly sweet apple, and they were great.  They were huge apples, and I only needed half the apple for the bruschetta itself.  These are very quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! Instead of a large piece of bread, I used a sliced baguette. Yum! So easy and quick but still impressive! Perfect. The fresh thyme is important!

I just made this and yummmyyyy. Just cut an apple into small pieces, added goat cheese mixed with dry thyme and oregano (I did not have any fresh) and baked it (did not even put on bread). Really good, I will be making these for my daughters first birthday buffet since it was still yummy once it was cold.

This is definitely a keeper. I kept all the ingredients the same, but spread the goat cheese on the bread first and then topped with the apple mixture. Stuck it in the oven for a couple of minutes and it came out perfectly. I can't wait to make it again for Christmas!

This was yummy and we love the flavor combo, but there is something missing...  We added chopped walnuts and almonds and in future recipes we thought about chopped mushrooms and scallions... over all delicious but needs something extra!

a real simple and easy recipe. i like the fact that it's different so people are happy it's not the same ol bruschetta again. i had to substitute dried oregano but used fresh thyme and it still came out so good. My friends finished every piece! i made the topping the night before and just kept in the fridge to save time. Can't wait to make it again.

So good!  Added honey and that took it to the flavor I was looking for.  Just drizzled a little over the top.  My boyfriend thought this was OK, not great like me and my friend did.  He thought there was too much of an herby taste, but we also didn't use fresh so maybe we'll cut back on the dried herbs next time.  Overall, this is very easy and delicious, can't beat that!

Seemed to be missing a little something. Delicious when drizzled with honey! Used more goat cheese than called for.

Delish!  I was making a pork stew for dinner guests and needed a good appetizer.  This was perfect as the stew is made with apple cider and I serve it with diced apple and goat cheese for toppings.  For the bruschetta I didn't have oregano so I used fresh basil.  I had a bit of the cheese/apple mix left over so I used it the next day on wheat crackers.  Loved it - thank you!

Wow!  Sooo easy and something different to serve as a quick appetizer.  My guests loved it.  Will be on my "go to" list, especially in the fall with fresh apples.

This was a completely different take on Bruschetta, I loved it but it needs a little something.  So I added a light balsalmic drizzle to give it a tangy side with the sweetness of the apple

I would give this 4.5 stars for ease and simplicity. I agree with the other reviews that the fresh herbs make this app. I followed the recipe exactly except for spreading some olive oil over the bread prior to broiling which I would probably do again. Thanks for the tasty and unique recipe!

I would have given it three stars, but everyone else seem to like it. I think they liked it because it was more unique than amazing tasting. I like regular bruschetta better (with tomatoes). I would had some salt next time.

These were pretty good & I liked that they were different from all of the other "typical" appetizers served for the Christmas get together I went to.  I made as directed except 1) left the skins on for a more colorful presentation and 2) doubled the recipe and used one whole multi grain baguette.  Thanks for sharing!

Different, but the goat cheese didn't really melt well (despite leaving under the broiler a little longer) and there was nothing to hold the apples together so it was messy!  I served this at a Christmas party of 25 and this was the only appetizer left.

Couldn't be simplier.  Couldn't be tastier.  Smaller pieces of apples makes it easier to assemble and eat.  The fresh herbs are key.  A big wow factor with this recipe.

I made this for a teacher's potluck at school - I loved it, but it wasn't a huge hit with others - the junior high students that tried it liked it, so that worked for me!  I did add quite a bit more cheese though - my apples were BIG, so maybe that was the problem - that's why I prefer measurements, or at least sizes (sm, med, lg) - I will make this again!!

Great recipe. I (at least) doubled the cheese and used a very small Apple,chopped pretty small. I heated the dish itself until the cheese was a bit bubbly,allowing people to serve themselves. Pairs very well with wine! Will use over and over again!

Simple, fresh and delicious!  We used the grill, grilling both sides (took just two minutes per side) for beautiful grill marks.  Then placed bread on pan and added tomato mixture.  Followed the rest of recipe except to omit the garlic (I can't eat it raw).  Very yummy.   
The tomato mixture is also great on top of chicken parmesan.  It was beautiful and elevated the dinner to restaurant quality.

I really enjoyed these, but my husband did not like the apple/thyme combination.  I used dry herbs and also drizzled honey on top right before serving. Delicious.

These went fast at a dinner party! My husband was hesitant (since it wasn't your typical meat, cheese or potatoes) but devoured them. I used Jimmy Johns french bread... cheap, fresh, and yummy.

These were very good and different from the norm.  However, I think it's time to admit something to myself: I hate thyme.  I keep using it in recipes, expecting to eventually enjoy it, and I just don't.  So if I skipped it, this would have been perfect.  For anyone else, perfect as is.  That aside, these paired perfectly with a dry Riesling and were really fun and easy to make.

Very good, but the next time I make it, I will brush or drizzle some olive oil on the bread first and add a bit more feta.  Love the flavor, though!

Sounds great and the others loved it.  Since I don't care too much for oregano, I plan to use garlic chives (hope that goes well).  Also, I like to brush my baguette slices with olive oil so they aren't quite as dry.

Very good.  You can't beat the flavor combination, and it is a unique appetizer to serve.  However, my only comment is that they are a bit dry.  Great recipe, though, thanks!

Sooo good!  What a great combination of flavors.  I am not a big fan of goat cheese so I subbed crumbled feta and it was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  Great change of pace from the traditional tomato bruschetta that I always make.  Will make again.  One of my friends suggested to try it with brie.  I think we'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this so much I made it two weeks in a row.  Great way to use those fresh herbs from the garden.  Instead of chopping the apple, I made thin slices to go on top of the bread then spread the goat cheese on the apple slice.

This was fine but not really very exciting.  It tasted like goat cheese and apple.  No surprises.  I'm not sure what I expected though considering there aren't many ingredients.
