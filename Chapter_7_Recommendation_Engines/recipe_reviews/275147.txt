Don't forget to sweat the eggplant for 30 min before making this recipe. I peel the egg plant and slice. Since the wind blows out our grill, I made them in the oven. Just put the slices on a baking sheet and add all of the other ingredients and bake until the eggplant is soft. It is really easy and yummy.
