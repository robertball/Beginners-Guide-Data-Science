Super easy to make with great results! I made it with four packets of jello rather than five and used two colours. It turned out great and my father who loves jello was very impressed! It tasted pretty good as well; regardless of the flavour combinations you use it will taste fruity. It wasn't very sweet which was a plus it was a refreshing rather than rich dessert.

Ingredients call for sweetened condensed milk & heavy cream, but recipe instructions state sweetened condensed milk and condensed milk. Typo? What's going on. What happened to the heavy cream?
