This is about Chef John,  not the omelet.  I had to turn off the sound because what started out when he first was on the videos was a sort of lilting and clever way of speaking, that now has become so annoying I have to turn off the sound.  I went back to his first video and he did not talk in this silly way as if talking to a 3 year old child.....Chef, I love your recipes and comments, but PLEASE, PLEASE stop with that annoying delivery.

This is a response to you in regards to Helen Smith. I think she sips a wee bit too much wine while cooking. I am mildly gritting my teeth with your intro but it's not that bad. You should do one monotone just for her. Love the recipes Sir.

Love Denver omelettes. My father was a short order cook as a young man and he always put chopped dill pickles in his Denver omelet which really makes it as far as I’m concerned!

I made it to the recipe. I definitely would recommend it. I was making omelettes all wrong. It was easier to flip with the ingredients mixed in with the egg, and it did tear, but it didn't matter because there wasn't a bunch of stuff inside to squish out, and burn onto the pan. I used finely diced ham. I also used my roommates awesome huge spatula, it's made for hamburgers and pancakes, but it worked great for an omelette. Thanks Chef John!

Delicious omelet. I had a terrible time making omelets because I didn’t know to cook the vegetables before putting in the eggs. This time my omlet was wonderful. You can add whatever veggies you want - even hash browns. Thank you Chef John.

Made it for Sunday breakfast.  It takes a little time but goes together very easily.  The only change to the recipe was omitting cayenne pepper because I discovered I was out of it but will definitely add it next time.  My husband even said it was good, and that is high praise!
