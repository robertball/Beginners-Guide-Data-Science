Nice juice, a little to sweet for me but it was still very good.

The raspberry jam never really incorporated itself (and I use a battery-operated whisk which really does the job) into the apple juice, just settled at the bottom of the glass.  You didn’t get any raspberry flavor until you were drinking the juice from the bottom of the glass.  It was pretty much like drinking apple juice on ice.  Sorry, this one just didn’t work for me.
