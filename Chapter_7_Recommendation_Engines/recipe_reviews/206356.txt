This will be a five star recipe with a few changes.  It would easily serve three people, and if it was part of a whole meal, probably four.  Next time I will make the sauce in the pot before adding the pasta back in, just to make things easier.  I think it needs an additional pear, so you get the extra bit of sweetness and more contrast of flavors.  I will also add an extra tablespoon each of cream and parmesan, for a little more richness.  Very tasty and different; it would definitely impress company.

I loved this! I'm a big fan of anything involving cheese, so it was a pretty sure bet. Still, I was pleased that it was so good. Even my husband, who really doesn't like Gorgonzola, tried it, and he said it wasn't bad. Next time, I'm going to use some softer, juicier pears. I also used pecans instead of walnuts, since I don't like walnuts. Anyway, overall it was wonderful!

Literally the BEST dish I've ever made, to date. EVER. I used Gnocchis for the pasta. Also used only 1 tbsp butter and half & half instead of cream, but didn't miss the extra fat. Otherwise don't change a thing; its PERFECT. Husband was so wary of eating it ..."pears and cheese-that's weird!" but then just about licked his bowl clean.
Thanks for sharing this easy, tasty, quick recipe!

EASY,ELEGANT AND DELICIOUS!! I DOUBLED THE RECIPE FOR 1 LB. OF PASTA (FARFALLE-BOW TIES)BUT USED 3 RIPE BOSC PEARS FOR A LITTLE EXTRA SWEETNESS.I TOASTED THE WALNUTS FOR 10 MINUTES AT 350 (WHICH ENHANCES THE FLAVOR OF THE WALNUT AND ALSO SPRINKLED SMOKED PAPRIKA OVER THE TOP JUST BEFORE SERVING. EVERYONE LOVED IT! I SERVED WITH A CAPRESE SALAD AND GRILLED PORTABELLOS! QUICK, FABULOUS, ELEGANT MEAL ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE UNEXPECTED GUESTS!

By far the most brilliant, perfect pasta dish I've had in my LIFE. This recipe introduced me to Gorgonzola cheese which has become my favorite.

The only thing I did differenlty was cook 2 chicken breast cutting them into strips and saute in garlic to add "meat" to the dish. I would be fine without the meat but my husband has to have some kind of meat. I REALLY liked this dish. The pears gave a new taste to food for me. Very Yummy!

Excellent!  Even with using 2% milk instead of cream and using less butter, it still was quite amazing!

This is definitely a 5 star recipe because it took a whole 20 minutes to make and it was so full of flavor (my husband couldn't stop eating it.)  I used a 1 1b. bag of whole wheat penne pasta, a 5 oz. container of gorgonzola and doubled the rest of the ingredients, with the exception of the pear which I tripled.  I also used half & half only because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious.  This will be in my keeper box.  Thank you.

Very good!  Loved the interesting flavors.  Pear was a bit too crispy in the mix--will try again with the pears sauteed.  Needed a lot more gorgonzola and parmesan for my taste.

This is soooooo good!  And super easy.  I made this as a side dish for a Pampered Chef party I was hosting at my house and this got more compliments than the dish the PC consultant made.

This recipe is wonderfully simple and flavorful, leaving you room to be creative in the way you serve it.  In my version I like to add chopped roasted asparagus, craisins, and an extra pear.  Cook these separately on a cookie sheet covered in foil.  To maximize flavor, drizzle the asparagus, cubed pears, and craisins with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper when they're on the sheet.  Cook at 350 for 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of the oven.  (I have a small toaster oven that does the job in 10.)  Throw that combo into your pasta and you'll have a more well-rounded dish.  I also tend to increase the amount of cheese and cream to make up for the added ingredients.  If nothing else, this dish pairs well with asparagus, so try serving the two together.  On a side note, I use lite cream instead of heavy to cut calories, and my man doesn't even notice the difference in flavor.  It's by far his favorite dish.

Because of what I had on hand, I subbed Asiago for the Parmesan and omitted the nuts.  I used  Dischi (little ears pasta) and added some baby spinach that I needed to use.  All I can say is WOW!  I served as a main dish with a homemade French baguette and a green salad.  It was fun watching my guests take the first bite and try to identify the familiar but unexpected flavor.  Thanks for a lovely recipe.

this recipe gave me inspiration for a modified version with stuffed shells ...i finely diced the pear and sauteed them in a tablespoon of butter and 1/4 c white wine..but left the pears with a crunchy consistency... i toasted a cup of walnuts and blended that with a 5 oz package of gorgonzola cheese crumbles in my food processor until smooth.....to each jumbo shell i added approx 1 tbsp of pear mixture and approx 1 tsp of the gorgonzola cheese mixture...baked them in the oven at 250 deg F for ~ 20 min.  I made a fresh fennel white wine parm cream sauce and added 1 tsp of torn fresh sage....served 5 shells over wilted spinach and lightly covered in white sauce....

I made this recipe without the nuts, didn't have any on hand, and it was ok.  I think maybe my pear was too soft.  My daughter loves this without the pear.  She requests it often.  It is so easy to make, that I do make it most times she requests it.  Without the pears and nuts it is kind of a "gourmet" mac-n-cheese. Delicious!

Super yummy. Everyone liked it. Its great if you don't change a thing, but here is what I changed. I sautéed shallots in the butter before adding the pasta. I doubled the cheese and cream.  I added fresh thyme at the very end.

This was excellent!  I added about a tablespoon extra of the Gorgonzola (to use up the container) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I might use more than one pear next time.   I highly recommend that anyone who liked this recipe try the Gorgonzola, pear and walnut pizza on this website.  It is outrageous!

Super yummy! Like alot of others, I doubled up on the gorgonzola because I like it a little richer, and will definately add some crumbled bacon next time as it seemed to be missing something.

One of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life was a gnocchi with a gorgonzola cream sauce when I was visiting Milan.  While this doesn't quite hit that bar, it is a very good approximation.  I did add in an extra Tbsp of both cheeses and thought that intensified the gorgonzola flavor a little more adequately, though next time I'll double the gorgonzola.  The toasted walnut and pear provide an excellent counterpoint to the cheese flavor.  It might be a little too heavy for a main dish for some, but it would certainly be a perfect side.  If you like the gorgonzola flavor, this is definitely a keeper.

Made this for my husband for dinner and it was delicious. I added chicken to make it a more filling meal, and it worked well to add another texture. I used mizithra cheese instead of parm. because that's what I had on hand and it worked well. The only change I would make next time would be to add more gorgonzola cheese. I love gorgonzola cheese and the flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked. Overall delicious dish that I will make again!

Very tasty.  I added asparagus but it may have been better on the side.  Also I don't think it needs as much pear and walnuts as the recipe calls for; I will probably use half next time.

This was ok but I wouldn't want to have it again. The pears were a nice change of taste and we added left over turkey to make it a meal, but the overall dish seemed pretty bland.

This is a must side dish for every ocassion, it is so tasty.  I added a cup of heavy cream to the cheese to give it a richer and saucier taste. It is to die for.

This recipe was a perfect balance of flavors with the savory cheese, sweet pears, and nutty nuts (I used toasted pecans).  The whole family liked it.  I served it with olive oil sauteed brussels sprouts (quartered), carrots (julienned), onion, and garlic for a complete vegetarian meal.

Wow! This was a delicious change of pace for such a quick meal, and a good meatless option, too. The only changes I made were to use half & half instead of whipping cream, and blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. I would give it 5 stars either way. The blue/gorgonzola cheese was such a nice hint in the background, definitely not overpowering. This recipe definitely yields more than 2 servings - I'd say 3 or 4. Last thing - don't skip toasting the nuts! It really does change and enhance their flavor. Enjoy this one, it's a keeper!

I made this tonight for the family but added  chicken (finely cubed and fried in olive oil).  I also went heavy on the Gorgonzola and Parmesan to bump up the flavor, and I sauteed the pears to soften them a bit.  I wanted more pear flavor so next time I'll use more pear and cube them to a larger size.

I took the recipe and ran away with it. I doubled the butter and added spinach and prosciutto, everything I kept the same. So yummy

Although I rarle rate recipes, this one is WORTH it - served mostly as is, but added Tbsp. extra cream and Gorgonzola. Serve with a well seasoned steak and lemon peas or pea pods for maximum flavor... KUDOS,

Delicious!  My husband and I both loved it and he said it was gourmet quality...on top of all that, it was easy.  I did use a little more cheese and pear than the recipe called for, but it would have been great without it.  Thanks for sharing!

So delicious- I'm never buying canned already sauce again.  This was so easy to make and the taste phenomenal!  Even better than many restaurant pastas I've had.  Will make this over and over again.

Loved this recipe! It was really easy to make and didn't take a whole lot of time. I did substitute toasted pine nuts for the walnuts, and I doubled the sauce recipe...it was delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made many times before as a side dish, but that I later developed a little to make it a main using chicken breast. To do this, count one chicken breast half per person. Slice each breast lengthwise into two fillets. Season with salt, pepper and some onion powder. No herbs as they would clash with the flavors of the dish. The onion powder makes it aromatic without being overpowering. As the pasta is boiling, grill each chicken breast over high heat and using a small amount of olive oil on the grill pan to avoid sticking. As soon as they are done, cube them and stir it into the pasta mix before you add the pear. Enjoy :)

I really liked this recipe but I did find it a bit bland as written so I made a few changes after. One pear is definitely not enough for our taste. I added four additional pears but I used my electric skillet to brown them in olive oil. I also added chicken breasts until they were nicely browned. Afterwards I de-glazed the skillet with a little white wine & added that to the pot. I know I used more Gorgonzola but I just kept adding & tasting until it tasted right to me. I also added extra heavy whipping cream because it needed it. I have to say the toasted walnuts was my favorite part. I dry roasted them in the same skillet, tasting until they were crispy & sweet. Oh! I almost forgot I also browned asparagus & added that as well. Yum! Our guests were impressed & it was quite easy to make. I know I will be making this again!

Just okay. Might have been better with some pear juice or some pear liquid thrown in during the cooking process. I was looking for something a little stronger in the pear department.

This is heaven on a plate! I sauteed my pear a bit before I added it because it wasn't very ripe and a bit hard, but beggars can't be choosers when it comes to produce in Alaska. I also used gnocchi instead of penne. This recipe is deceptively simple, but is so delicious. I've rarely met a dish that was so rich I couldn't finish it, but this one almost was. Thank you for the recipe nellegirl, this is my new guilty pleasure.

I doubled the pear and didn't peel them.  I used 8 oz macaroni, shredded Parmesan instead of grated, cashews instead of walnuts, and whole milk instead of whipping cream.  It turned out great.  Only change I would make is to triple the pear next time and more blue cheese!  This has a lot of flavor for a low-sodium dish.

The gorgonzola gives this dish great flavor. The only change I made was using apple instead of pear since I prefer the texture of apple.

We made this recipe because we had tons of pears in the house.  I love pears, pasta & gorgonzola, but didn't love this.  

Also, this is unappealing reheated.  So, make certain you eat it all the first day.  As with most cream sauces...they separate upon reheating.

The idea of this is delicious but it just didn't turn out like I had expected. I used wheat pasta because my boyfriend is obsessed with wheat, so maybe that was why I wasn't fond of this. Either way, it could have been better somehow.

I was hesitant to try this...sounds like something out of Princess Diaries :).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was quite good, definitely a break from pasta with butter, salt, sauce and Parmesan.  Will make occasionally.

LOVED IT!!! And I didn't change a thing!! BUT I can see where the right pear will really make a difference in this recipe. I use the Comice Pear that seems to be in the markets around Oct.. It is the MOST juciest and wonderful tasting pear you'll ever eat. The Comice Pear was awesome in this recipe!

Fantastic! My changes: Doubled the recipe. I sauteed the pear cubes in 2 Tbl butter with a couple dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon. When the pears are almost done, I add the walnuts so they get the yummy cinnamon-nutmeg/butter taste. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Very good and plenty for my family of four and two BIG lunches the next day.

Loved this recipe, easy, tasty and even reheated the pears added a nice tang to the dish.
