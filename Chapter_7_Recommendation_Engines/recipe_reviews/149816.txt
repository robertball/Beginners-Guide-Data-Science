Oh, yum!! I took this to a work potluck & everyone really liked it. I didn't have the full amount of honey or the shallot, but the dressing was still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I didn't have any shallots, but this dressing is incredible! I was lazy and just put all the ingredients for the dressing in a Tupperware container and shook it up really good and it emulsified pretty good. Some leftover chicken would be great on top of this too! Thank you for a great recipe, Emily!

This is a fantastic, easy recipe!  I used pistachios instead of almonds, and goat cheese in place of the feta.  Amazing!

this is quick and easy and a great, fresh salad. Definitely serve the dressing on the side as the lettuce will wilt quickly.

I just made this salad for my Bunco group and it had rave reviews! I had made the dressing in advance and was easy to throw together. Very flavorful and delicious!

I LOVE THIS SALAD!  I used candied pecans (cause that's what I had) and the biggest change was an addition of grilled shrimp because I was serving this as our evening meal. YUMMY! I also used a mix of baby spinach and lettuces as I always try to up the health benefits with spinach in my salads.  As others have said the marriage of the dressing, strawberries and feta is awesome!

Had this for lunch today along with a cup of soup.  The dressing marries really well with the strawberries and feta cheese.  Definitely will be making this again.

Nice flavor, but mine was very thick. I think next time I'll just use a whisk instead of the processor.

Delicious dressing, very easy to make and was a perfect compliment to the salad and strawberries.  Made my salad with strawberries, bleu cheese, homemade candid walnuts, red onion, and I mixed spring mix with spinach and romaine. 
The dressing was very thick, so I watered it down and it stayed perfectly blended/emulsified (probably about 3/4 cup water).  This brought down calories per serving and allowed for easier tossing. We served with grilled steak (which is why I went with bleu cheese) Very light and fresh. Amazing! A definite keeper.

This salad was fantastic!  I only made a couple minor changes.  I used a 50/50 spring mix-spinach blend for the salad, omitted the shallot and I toasted the almonds in a frying pan with a teaspoon of butter and pinch of salt.  Myself and our dinner guests were blown away by how good the dressing was.  So delicious and simple.

I think this is a great and easy recipe. I couldn’t fine any shallot so I didn’t use any but it still turned out great. I am a fan of vinaigrette and this one is definitely a favorite !!

Awesome recipe. Had enough dressing to make the salad a second time. The toasted almonds really add to the texture so don’t skip that. I also added some chicken breast that I pan fried in olive oil. Make sure you chop it up and toss it in with the dressing. A crowd pleaser ;)

Love, love , love! I have made this now 5 times in December for different holiday parties. It's a huge success! I added pine nuts to it. I also tried cut up apples when I was out of strawberries  and goat cheese crumbles one night and it was still delicious.

We added apples and thought about bananas... it was great, though we missed out on the onions and shallots. Very pleased with the dressing!

I modified a little: 
- used half of the olive oil (I think it can still be reduced!) 
- added cucumber and carrot to replace the red onion
- used yellow mustard because I don't have djon mustard
- used rose apples to replace the strawberry 
- used freshly grated cheddar cheese to replace feta cheese 

This recipe is fantastic! It's a MUST-TRY and fail-proof recipe. I love it to the max. In this recipe, I used my homegrown romaine lettuce and rose apples. It makes one wants for more!

Something was not right with the dressing.  Ruined the greens.  Might try again with my own vinaigrette.

this is an amazing recipe. I would recommend using half a small shallot, as the shallot taste was very strong, initially. After a couple days it mellowed out, however.  Would definitely make again.

I thought the dressing was very heavy and thick for a salad that seemed light - strawberries, feta cheese. I'm not sure how to make it thinner.

I've never seen a salad actually disappear. This one was delicious and pretty - Wish I'd taken a picture! The dressing is sweet - someone in our group called it a dessert salad, but it is good. What's nice about it is that you can mix it up a bit. I added dried cranberries...and possibly some pine nuts. I can't quite recall.

I don't like raw onions so I substituted cucumber for the red onion to keep the crunch. Very tasty!

This really is a delicious salad but the dressing is so high in calories!  I cut the oil by half and the dressing was still great.  Company worthy but not so sure it's worth it for an average weeknight dinner.  The feta and almonds add a lot of calories as it but then the dressing makes this more of a meal as far as calorie count.

this is delicious and a new favorite!! the dressing recipe makes more than was needed for my tastes but I have used it on everything from steamed radish greens to baked  potatoes. The dressing will be a new staple in refrigerator.

Modified this for the HCG diet and it's absolutely delicious! Used a couple tblsp water instead of oil, 1/2 tbsp liquid stevia instead of honey and second time making it, I used onion powder instead of shallot. It was terrific both ways and had a little less bite to it with the onion powder (though I do love shallots). I also added about a tsp of thyme and oregano. I put this dressing on everything and have even used it as a marinade. Yum!

Excellent!!!  Was looking for something different to bring to a dinner party and this was it.  Even the teenage boys had seconds and complimented on the dressing.  Will certainly use the dressing on a very regular basis.  Do not have a food processor but I do have one of those rocket blenders and that worked pretty well.

Absolutely great dressing. We loved it on the strawberries.
