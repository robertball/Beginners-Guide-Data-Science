I loved this jello dessert.  I don't own a jello mold, so used a bundt pan instead.  It worked out fine.  I also used all the Cool Whip in the jello instead of reserving some.

This is a great tasting, simple dessert to make. It's refreshing and reminds me of a 50/50 popsicle with the blend of orange and cream flavors. I used Cool Whip Light instead, and it worked out fine.

This was my first attempt at a Jello mold and it turned out great.  The only change was that it took closer to an hour before the first layer reached the desired consistency.  Served it at Thanksgiving and it was a hit!

Tastes like creamsicle jello.  The creamy layer started to melt under the weight of the jello layer so next time I'll adjust the proportions and make the creamy layer thicker. Since the orange sections float in the jello I pushed some them into the jello after it had partially set.  This distributed the fruit more evenly throughout the jello layer.

This is wonderfully easy to make and cool, light, and delicious. It makes the perfect summer dessert. The only problem I had is that the layer with the mandarin oranges needed to be refrigerated for 1 hour, though the other layer only needed 30 min. as stated (how can you expect to get 2 different textures from the gelatin if you refrigerate them for the same amount of time?). However, this is easy to fix. Just put in the orange layer first, then half an hour later pop the remaining gelatin in the fridge. Finally, I didn't have a mold so I used a bundt pan like a previous reviewer did. It ended up looking beautiful (the fluted edges really give it flair) and the whole family oohed and aahed when I brought it out.
