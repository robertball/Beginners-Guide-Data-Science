I took shortcuts by using canned mango puree, and this tasted delicious without the work!  I used angel food cake, instead of pound cake and it kept it light. I skipped the bananas and pineapple, and instead cut up fresh mango (since the celebrant loves loves loves mango). The trifle was a hit at the party. Thanks for the recipe idea!

I made this for a baby shower and it was fantastic!  I just pulled up the recipe again to make for Christmas.
