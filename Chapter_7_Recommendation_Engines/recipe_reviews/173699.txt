This was a very good way to use up leftover pork. I see in the reviews that some people did not use the dill pickles. Use them! I actually wish I would have put a few more on, because they added to the flavor of this dish.  Easy to make, too.

This was a fantastic dinner. I bought a premade pizza crust and added some thinly sliced granny smith apples and pineapple tidbits. It was great! I didn't put the pickles on the pizza, but tried them along side the pizza. I would put them on next time! Thanks

I've made this before (new year's eve party- I sliced it into small bite-sized pieces) and used cheddar cheese , no pickles and garnished with some chopped green onions. It was a huge hit- I only made it as a last minute "extra" appetizer but it was soo good I'll be making this again.

I used bbq chicken that I had made and put in the freezer awhile back. Put some bbq sauce on the crust very lightly, topped it with the chicken, onion, and mozzarella. No pickles for us. Everyone enjoyed it!

After having this recipe in my box forever I finally tried it. I used leftover pulled pork I had and did try the dill pickles on half and pickled jalape単os slices on the other half. They were both good but we preferred the jalape単os. The BBQ on pizza dough was a terrific idea. Next time I might try some pineapple tidbits along with the jalape単os. And there will be a next time for this delicious pizza.

I like it, and all my guest liked it too. I tried it with half of the pizza with pickles and the other half no pickles. Both were good. I also sprinkled on french fried onions the last 5 min of baking to half of the pizza. All very good. Much better than the traditional pizza sauce.

Used leftover pulled pork. It was a little dry, so next time I think I'll add a layer of BBQ sauce on the crust. Good, easy recipe!

I used left over pork chalupa, so I made it with a Mexican flair. I added the chalupa, mozzarella, jalape単os, and sliced onion. When I removed it from the oven, I garnished with cilantro, diced tomatoes, and romaine lettuce. It was delicious! Must try!

Very good, but add some BBQ sauce to the crust and then lightly spread with shredded cheddar before placing the pork and other toppings.

I left off the onion and pickle, but we love pulled pork pizza.  I cheated a little and used a precooked crust, then a package of pulled pork.  Pizza cheese on top, a little extra bbq swirled after it comes out of the oven and it is great.

Delicious!  Just what I needed to use up the left over pulled pork from Super Bowl Sunday.  If you don't use the pickles don't bother making this.  I used jalapeno pickles... wonderful.  This would be bland if not for the pickles.  There were no left overs.

YUMMY! I did use leftover 'Bourbon Mango Pulled Pork' that I had in the freezer and made my own crust, but followed the directions otherwise. This was really delicious and the pickles did make this extra tasty...I couldn't have imagined leaving them off. This was a great new way to use up leftover pulled pork, and one that I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

We have had this pizza twice in two years and it was given 5 stars by my family each time. I chopped up BBQ pork chops that we grilled the day before as the topping of this pizza. I put down a layer of BBQ sauce first on the crust, then I added pineapple to the mix as well as colored peppers and dill pickles. I made my pizza dough in the breadmaker beforehand. I get best results when I use a cookie sheet and bake pizza at 500 degrees for about 15 minutes. This makes the crust crunchy. Loved it. Will make again.

This was just okay. I made my own pizza dough but other than that I made the pizza as written except that I put BBQ sauce on one half of the pizza before adding the other ingredients. The side with the BBQ sauce was A LOT better than the side without, it added flavour to an otherwise quite bland pizza. If I make it again I might add some cooked bacon, or pickled jalapenos as some other reviewers used - just to give it some more flavour,

This is one of those dishes you can't really decide how you feel about it but can't stop eating either. I made exactly as stated above but used a pre formed uncooked pizza crust. Changes we have discussed for next time is heating the pork bbq a bit before it is but on the pizza. Mostly we just feel that the cheese and other items didn't get long enough to cook since it was on top of the cold pork. For everyone that doesn't think pickles will work. Try them on it. For some reason it just does. I found myself wishing there was maybe a few more. Also in my cheese loving house there were complaints about not being enough cheese but more a personal thing than a need addition.

I enjoyed this pizza, and it was a great way to use the rest of my pulled pork.  I spread the dough with some extra BBQ sauce before I put the pork on.  My husband wasn't a big fan of the pickles, but I liked them.
