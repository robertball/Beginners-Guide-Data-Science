OK...here goes! We are rebels. We didn't follow this recipe EXACTLY. This is what we did, or should we say DID NOT do:  1.) We did not use a gas grill 2.) We used ribeye and not a porterhouse steak 3.) Our steaks were about 1" thick and not 2".  Anyway...Believe it or not after all the DID NOTS...We DID use the method in this recipe and the hubs enjoyed the smoke infused flavor. My hubby did the grilling with me as supervisor :)  We started with the charcoal on one side of the grill. Got the coals nice and hot and added wood soaked chips in a makeshift pan formed out of foil tossed on top of the coals. Once the coals started smoking we put the steaks on the cool side of the grill. Grilled, covered,  about 15 minutes (which was a little too long for 1" steaks) until they reached 118 degrees. Oops, too long! Removed the chips/foil pan from the coals and tossed the steaks on until seared on one side, flipped to sear the other side. Approx. five minutes total searing time. Steaks were about 150 degrees when taken off. Since we only have a charcoal grill and I will use this method again I will reduce the original smoke time just a bit to make up for thinner steaks. Once done, they were still pink in the center and had a great smoke flavor but feel they were slightly overdone for our tastes.  We generally like medium doneness and this turned out more like medium well. Next time I will keep a closer eye on the temp. There will be a next time though.

I love thick steaks. My uncle (a classically trained chef) taught me this very method years and years ago. He added one thing though...keep turning the steak during the indirect portion of the cooking.  Gets rid of that funky line that exists between the cooked meat and the uncooked. Then you do the high temp sear, let it rest a bit and dig in!
