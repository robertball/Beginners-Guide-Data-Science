It looks good, tastes good, BUT don't waste a dish by using a 9X13 pan.  Use something smaller, like 8X8.

I've never made cobbler before but I think one cup water is a lil too much. Is the batter not supposed to be like a breadish topping? Very sweet n delicious none the less

Luckily I did not take the time to read the reviews and I made it just as it was written.  I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the one cup of boiling water poured over the cobbler before putting it in the oven, but that created a very nice glaze when it came out of the oven.  The batter seemed to be a bit thick to spread over the rhubarb, but I did it the best I could and it came out just fine.  A lot of reviewers suggest making it in an 8 X 8 pan, which would make it thicker, but I liked the 'bar like' result of baking it in a 13 X 9 pan.  I also liked the fact that it only calls for 3 tablespoons of butter.  I would suggest to everyone that they try the recipe just as it is written before making a changes, it was definitely a big hit at the potluck dinner I took it to.

GREAT flavor, happy to use the rhubarb my in laws brought me from their farm. This was the first time I've used rhubarb to bake. My older relatives used to make different kinds of pies/cobblers/jams when I was growing up with rhubarb and I miss it. An 8 x 8 dish was perfect size for dessert, as some others noted for the cobbler. I added a pint of raspberries, yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Well, it looks GREAT.  I just did a Faceless recipe and did my first photo, so this recipe in no longer faceless.  We are going to have it with french vanilla ice cream after we have our evening meal.  So I really do not know what it taste like, I will have to come back in an hour or so.
Well, it is a good thing I made a double batch-----I do have some left over for tomorrow.  This is very good, I like the sugar topping, it shines like glass and has a very nice crunch.  My guys all loved it and said "Save some for us tomorrow".  I am a midnight eater and I know what I will be having, hope there is enough for tomorrow.  Very good and easy to fix.  I love it.  I am so thankful that the rhubarb came out of my garden, didn't have to pay $4 or $5 a pound for it.  Now I can freeze up some with 6/7 cups and be ready to do this in the winter.

I would use a smaller amount of the topping on top of the rhubarb -- 3/4 or 1/2 amount

I made it exactly as the recipe said, but put it in an 8 x8 pan instead. I put that pan on a cookie sheet in case it overflowed as it baked (which it did a little).

It's an unusual preparation, but makes an amazing cobbler with a sweet, slightly crunchy top! It reminds me a little of sour cherry cobbler.

Sooooo yummmmy, can't stop making this awesome desert, no sooner than the dish is empty I want to make it again and again!   My husband would prefer the homemade 'mom's pie crust' used instead so we are making it that way and see how it turns out.

This turned out great but I did add a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to it for a little variety.
