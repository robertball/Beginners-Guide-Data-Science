This is certainly simple!  Simple, but delcious!  Followed recipe exactly until the end, at which point, we added a little more butter and salt just before serving.  It may not have been necessary, but my boyfriend is used to an Italian asparagus recipe, that includes pan-frying in lots of oil AND butter (yummy, but SO MUCH FAT!), and I want to slowly get him used to a healthier version.  Next time, I'll try omitting the extra salt and butter.  We steamed for a tad bit too long so the stems were slimy, but the tops were just delicious!  That was purely our own fault, and not the fault of the recipe - I'm just including it here as a warning to other members - please be careful about cooking too long!  It's really a great, simple, healthy recipe, and I think it deserves more attention.  :-)

Great!  My first time making steamed asparagus-- I had no idea how long to steam.  This recipe really helped.

This was really good.  My husband said this is his favorite way of preparing asparagus.  Before I served this I sprinkled some lime juice over the spears for a little kick.  Make sure to do this right before you plan on serving...otherwise the acidity from the lime makes the drippings turn red.  Will use this often!!

It's a total waste of butter to add it to the water.  Add it to the finished product.

Asparagus is so simple to make and doesn't require anything fancy to taste great. I steam my asparagus like this in just a little bit of water, and then no steamer basket is needed. Then, once it is a bright green color I saute it in a tad of olive oil for about a minute and sprinkle with a little salt. Yum!

This is my first time to steam asparagus, so compared to other methods, I really don't know how much better this one is. However, the asparagus was very good & I will make it again. I knew it was a hit when my husband ate the entire stalk of each one. Thinning the bases of the stalk with a vegetable peeler was a helpful hint.

Exactly as the name states.  I used "dill vinaigrette" (from this site) instead of the butter.  Basic, but good.  Thanks Kim.

I love vegetables with absolutely nothing on them, so this recipe was for me.  The asparagus turned out beatifully, not to mushy, not to bland.  I'll use it again!

Simple and tasty! It is also good for steaming a large bunch to snack on cold at a later time- not too squishy.

This was my first time steaming anything, and my first time cooking asparagus. This recipe was a great base, though I agree with other reviewers that adding the salt and butter to the steaming water is just a waste.

I made this as a snack so I could try steaming asparagus. (:
I knew I wanted more of a kick of flavor rather than just plain steamed asparagus, so I sautéed about a teaspoon or two of minced garlic (I love garlic so I pretty much just put a dollop of it in) and a pinch of salt in about 3-4 tablespoons of butter in a separate pan. ((Be careful to not brown the garlic however, as it gets bitter.))
I drizzled this onto my steamed asparagus, but still wasn't satisfied with the amount of flavor, so I followed Josie's advice and put the juice of half of a lime on there. It was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again, though I might try sautéing the asparagus in the butter mixture after steaming, and maybe adding some more spices. (:

I steamed asparagus for about 6 minutes (plain water works fine) then transferred to a fry pan with olive oil. Sauteed for about a minute or so, adding sea salt, cracked black pepper and a little garlic powder. Simple and delicious!

This was good but 10 minutes was nowhere near enough time for it to be cooked.  Next time I will steam it for at least 25 minutes.

I didn't use the butter or salt for diet reasons.   Cooked 8 minutes and shut off heat and let sit in steamer to keep warm till the rest of the dinner was on the table.

Adding salt and butter to the water in the steamer is pointless.  Add it to the asparagus at the end if you want to actually flavor them.  The only part of the butter that will evaporate and penetrate the asparagus is the water within.

We like the thin tender asparagus, and it only takes 2 1/2 mins to steam, take off heat and let stand 1 min. or so, place on serving plate and then a quick rub with the end of a refrigerated stick of butter over them (you don't need to add extra salt if you use salted butter). Butter in the water is a useless waste of butter. For garlic lovers, a slice or smashed garlic in the water is also great.  Yummo.

I just made this.  It was yummy.  I have never liked other asparagus recipes.  But here is what I did.  I had also made the Poppy Chicken II from this web site.  So I used the bay leaf from that recipe in this recipe's water.  I added a little olive oil.  Steamed for 10 mintues.  I had melted butter in a shallow baking dish ready with poultry season, salt, pepper, and Italian Herb Season Grinder mix flavoring the butter.  When the asparagus was ready, I added it to the melted butter.  Delis!

Simple. Nice for light flavor, but a bit bland for those who like a bolder flavor. Might be better with a bit of garlic.

I didn't measure the ingredients but peeled a bit at the ends. I added olive oil, lemon juice and salt after steaming for 8 minutes.

Excellent recipe! I used raspberry vinaigrette instead of butter and drizzled a little lime juice in the water before boiling. A little pepper when fully steamed. Tasted fabulous! Thanks for the recipe.

Easy breezy! This plain preparation (butter or olive oil) goes well with strongly salted foods that I make.

Easy and delicious! I only added a bit of salt and pepper, really brings the taste of the asparagus to the table instead of a bunch of seasonings.

Very good.  I usually don't like asparagus, but this was really good.  I still added butter after it was done cooking.

This seems so easy, like I should know how to do this with out the recipe, but I always pan fried my asparagus. Thanks for the reminder that simple (and healthier) can be very tasty. Very Tasty.

Five stars for simplicity, three stars for flavor.  We are trying to add more greens to our diet, and this is an easy way to do it.  Will make again when in need for a quick side dish.

Awesome recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I used distilled water instead of tap water and sea salt rather than table salt. I have no idea why, I guess I felt somewhat compelled to put my own mark on it.

This was great, I used thin asparagus and tossed it in olive oil, and garlic before streaming it and then added a few slices of lemon for zest, it was fantastic.

Simply good!  I used less water, but that is the only difference.  This was my first time trying fresh asparagus- and I can't stomach the canned mush that is presented as asparagus.  This has reconciled me to fresh! Thanks!

I steamed the asparagus over just water for five minutes until they were tender-crisp.  I then put a tablespoon of margarine on them with sea salt and black pepper.  Delicious!!

I don't have a lot of experience with asparagus (not good experience anyway!) so I was happy to find these basic instructions.  I never would have supposed it would steam this fast.  No more overcooked asparagus!  (Is there anything more disgusting??)

If you are looking for a basic, easy recipe this is it! Steaming with butter, water and salt gives just the right seasoning without being overwhelming. I'm a fan!

I left out the butter too.
Wanting tender spears, I was unsure whether I could steam the whole asparagus spear. My wife (Chinese) showed me how to find where the tender parts of the spear were and which was tougher. Simply bend the lower half of each spear. Above where the spear snaps cleanly is tender; below is the tougher part. No guesswork involved and no waste.

I made it according to the recipe and the asparagus came out perfectly. Tender but not too soft. I don't see that adding the salt and butter to the water did anything for the flavor, good or bad, so I will probably omit it next time and just use water. It was absolutely delicious with the Microwave Hollandaise Sauce recipe I also got on this site.

Excellent. I put into a steamer and so it didn't directly touch water. I used NO butter to lower the calories and I put in fresh mushrooms -- was awesome.

Really easy and delicious. I added grape tomatos to the steamer basket as well - just be careful biting into them when piping hot.  :-)   I added a drizzle of soy sauce and dash of black pepper just prior to serving.  Yum.

No matter what I do, I can't make asparagus that I like.  Don't know what's wrong with me--I like it in restaurants!  Bf said they weren't cooked enough for him, but he says he likes them mushy--apparently overcooked.  He did seem to like these well enough--he ate over half.  Very quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been doing this a long time and never gave it a thought to add butter to the steaming water!  The recipe was tasty, I’d make it again for sure.

Not quite as easy as made out, but still delicious. Probably took twice the time but could also just be my stove. Its pretty old. Haha! Fantastic recipe though when you dont want all the greasiness from frying it!

YUUUMMM! 
At my age I'm just learning to cook. Thank you for this awesome page!! 
Yes I made it!  My 1st time too! 
However I kinda changed it a bit ??.   After making it per your recipe instructions, I then placed sparagus in frying pan with a bit of butter, xtr/virgen olive oil, slightly mashed fresh garlic, & small sprinkle of salt.  
For my taste it came out delicious!

First time I have ever had asparagus, my husband found this recipe and we made it today...it came out great!  Will definitely have it again, we loved it.  We put about 2 tablespoons of butter seasoned with garlic salt in the serving dish and tossed it with the cooked asparagus. He added a dash of lemon juice to his, I liked mine without.  Even my grown son and teen daughter like it without the lemon juice.
