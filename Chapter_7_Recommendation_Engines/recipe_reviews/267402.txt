I was looking for dessert recipes without refined sugar, and this one uses dates, which is a nice substitute. I followed the recipe exactly, baking times and all, and these brownies were fragile while still warm (be careful!). The brownies were rich and delicious--rich texture and excellent chocolate flavor. I also made a simple icing to go on top (1/4 c. maple syrup, 1/4 c. melted coconut oil, and 1/2 t. vanilla), but they would be perfect without a topping too. I'll be making these again!

Better the next day.  Followed exactly and turned out really well.  May need to add a bit less cocoa for those who prefer a sweeter chocolate taste.

I followed the directions exactly except that I used spelt flour instead of wheat flour. Came out beautifully! I decided to top it with a homemade caramel sauce: 1/4c maple syrup and 1/4 c coconut oil melted for 1 min in the microwave; add in 2 T almond butter and a pinch of salt. OMG. Delicious! UPDATE: Months later, this has become one of my favorite recipes. I often replace an egg with flax or chia to give a little nutritional boost and make them even more moist and delicious. Really amazing.

For extra richness and nutrition I chopped and soaked the dates overnight in 1/2C milk and blended that to make the paste instead of doing the boiling water soak. I only had salted butter so after calculating the sodium in a stick of my brand vs what’s called for in the recipe, I omitted salt (the butter itself  had a tad more than what’s called for). Used 1T vanilla, added about 1/2t espresso powder, a pinch cinnamon, folded in 1/2C chopped pecans at the end. Only used 1 egg the 2nd time making this because I wanted a denser brownie. I failed to adjust for cooking in glass so they were more done than I wanted at 22-23 mins, but once adjusted they should be perfect and probably less fragile too (they are pretty fragile like some others mentioned). Everyone really enjoyed them! The perfect amount of chocolatiness and sweetness for me. The only crazy thing I’d say I could do to improve them would be to brown the butter, then let it cool and use it. Only tricky part to doing that would be to add in the right amount of liquid (like 1-2T milk probably) to account for the moisture lost in the browning process

I added a dollop of peanut butter and less salt than called for due to the peanut butter. My four year old licked his plate to get all of the crumbs.

These were okay but a little tasteless.  I added a ganache icing to make it better.

I found it messy to make in my food processor.  The flavor is great, but the middle of the brownies weren't done when the edges were dry.  I should have baked them longer.  I used rice flour instead of wheat flour.  Will try them again, but will  use conventional mixing..

These were very yummy.  I used 2 eggs but will use 1 next time because they were very cakey.  I only have unsweetened chocolate in my house (so I do not snack on it) so I drizzled a little honey in to cut the bitterness.  They were so good I am going to make them for giving to the neighbors at Christmas.
