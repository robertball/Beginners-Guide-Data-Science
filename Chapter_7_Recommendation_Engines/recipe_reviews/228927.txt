This was wonderful! Loving experimenting with slow cooker oatmeal. My husband loves this too. i used skim milk to replace half the water, seems to make it creamier. I also used a little more splenda.

This was super yummy.  It does make a lot.  I made it for a work breakfast pitch in and it went over very well.  I used extra banana and I served it with fresh banana and chocolate chips.  Mmm...

This made a HUGE batch!  Made the house smell very yummy though.  Needed more splenda for my family too.

Very good. Mine cooked thoroughly in about 5 hours. I stirred every so often to prevent caking on the sides.  I swapped the Stevia for pure maple syrup to make this real food friendly. We will make this again!

The oats cooked just fine, but I think they really benefited from the middle-of-the-night stirring I did.  (Was awake with the baby anyway so I decided to check on the oats.)  However, I think the chocolate flavor did not go very well with the earthy flavor of the oats.  Oh well, it was an experiment.  I'll probably cook oats this way again, but stick with a more traditional flavor profile of cinnamon and apples or raisins.

I just love the concept of cooking steel cut oatmeal in the slow cooker. I did not have cocoa so I used cranberries. This is such a timesaver. Being a work commuter, I pre-package servings so this is a winner. With all the variations and the convenience of the crock pot, never a dull moment.

Made this today perfect at 6 hrs. Did get a little dry around the edges and the bottom; I think it would benefit from stirring occasionally. Also added 1 cup of Splenda, but could have even used a little more. The kids enjoyed it with a few dark chocolate chips mixed in.

I wasn't a fan of this. I feel that the recipe called for too much water - the oats weren't thick enough. The flavor was just okay.

I was excited to try this unfortunately it was a bust. It smells and looks incredibly unappealing. I’m pregnant and the smell turned my stomach so bad I couldn’t even try it but my husband and son said it didn’t taste good at all.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was awful. It looked awful, tasted awful and the clean up was awful. Will not be making again, can't even think of ways to improve this.

My husband and kids would not eat this.  I had too dark of a chocolate flavor and they didn't like the texture. I didn't mind it but it was not my favorite.

My kids, who are usually open to different flavors, did not like this and I wasn't crazy about it either.  It had a very dark chocolate (not very sweet) taste and I'm a dark chocolate fan, but this just didn't work for me.  I liked the consistency though of the steel oats, so I think I'll try another slow cooker recipe.
