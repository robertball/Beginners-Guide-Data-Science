I initially wasn't sure about the combination of mint & mushrooms but this was delicious!  I healthed it up a bit by using half-and-half rather than heavy cream & I didn't need an entire quart; it was more like half that.  I'll stick to my changes.  I served it alongside the Super-Delicious Zuppa Tuscaca.

I was looking for something that was only a 'little risky' for a potluck, so mushroom and mint sounded just about right. I wasn't sure about the combination either, but it was a hit.

Having said that, adjustments needed to be made. An entire quart of cream is way too much -- half that is about right.

Four onions is pushing it as well. I had only small onions, and slicing three seemed to be more than enough.

Make such adjustments and you're good to go.

So good and very easy to make! I followed the other recommendations and used half the amount of cream, which was good initially, but didn't make for great leftovers or when chilled.

Not sure if something happened while I was cooking, but it ended up kind of dry and didn't taste all that minty. Still good, but will have to make adjustments next time
