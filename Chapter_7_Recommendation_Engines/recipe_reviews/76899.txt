I admit I was more interested in the concept of cooking a turkey breast in the slow cooker rather than the recipe itself, so I cooked mine with some minor changes. The amount of Worcestershire seemed excessive so I just used a few shakes. Didn't use flour, the sage, or the can of turkey gravy. I seasoned the breast with garlic pepper and a little poultry seasoning and laid a couple of bacon strips over the breast to help keep it moist and to flavor the gravy (I've always done this with my tradionally roasted turkey). Knowing that a lot of juices would be produced, I just threw in a portion of the bag of turkey gravy that came in the package. I found the stated cooking time WAY too long--I would think 6 hours on Low should me more than adequate, and next time I would check it even sooner. The turkey at 6-1/2 hours was cooked to a higher temperature than I would have preferred, but was still surprisingly moist. After I pulled the breast out to rest, I thickened up the gravy with a little cornstarch on the stovetop.  The turkey was succulent and moist and sliced beautifully, and the gravy was rich and flavorful. This method will definitely be making a comeback.

After putting two, almost nearly frozen 3lb. turkey breast roasts...boneless...in   my crockpot to cook all night, I had to jump on here this morning to rave about the result. This recipe is fantastic! We won't be eating the turkey until much later this afternoon, but I have to admit that I did sneak a few tastes as I sliced it up. Here's how I prepared mine. I put the two roasts in a large crockpot, opened up both gravy packets and dumped that over the roasts, then added one chopped vidalia onion and one bunch of chopped celery hearts...leaves and all...and a bay leaf. Then I sprinkled the tops of the roasts with crushed dried sage, thyme, salt, and cracked black pepper. I set this to cook on low...thought the roasts might take all night and most of today because they were almost completely frozen...I started this at 9:30 last night and by 7:30 this morning they were tender, very moist, and exceptionally savory. I did get up to baste the tops once during the night, but I don't think it was really necessary. This is the only way that I will ever prepare turkey from now on. This is a must-try recipe; it is OUTSTANDING!! Thank you so much for sharing this...can't wait for dinner later today.

IT WAS WONDERFUL!  The only thing that I changed was half-way through the cooking time I added 1 1/2 cups of turkey broth to it (due to the comments reguarding dryness).  It was moist and perfect.  I added a little cornstarch and made a gravy with the juices in the pot.

Oh my gosh! This was fantastic! Best turkey I ever made. Super tender and juicy, falling off the bone, great flavor. And so easy! I did not have a can of turkey gravy, so I just put in the gravy packet that came with the turkey breast. I left the skin on, and I cooked longer than the recipe called for, about 11 hours, just because of timing for my Christmas Eve meal, but it would probably be fine timed as directed. I tied the breast with string as other reviewers have suggested and it looked beautiful coming out, nicely browned. When near serving time, I removed the breast from the crockpot and added about 2 cups of chicken broth to the drippings for gravy. I stirred a couple of tablespoons of flour into some broth and added that to the mix, and turned the crockpot to high to thicken. The result was an out-of-this-world gravy to go with the turkey. I am so pleased with this recipe. Can't wait for turkey sandwiches tomorrow! This is definitely a keeper, I'll be making it throughout the year.

I was worried because I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I used a 3 lb boneless butterball turkery, and used the gravy packet it came with instead of a can of gravy) I followed the cooking time exactly and rubbed with oil before putting it in the crockpot, and it turned out AMAZING! This is such a keeper! And so easy you could have Thanksgiving dinner at least once a month!

Great recipe.  Had it today for Christmas Dinner along with ham.  Most all made positive comments on how good it was.  I will make this again.  Didn't know which way to lay the breast in the cooker so I laid it on the side.  Might put the bone side up next time to keep the breast meat in the juice.  See the pictures.

Wonderful!  I have cooked this twice now, and it has turned out better each time. One tip is to tie together with butchers string.  My first breast slightly fell apart so I tied the second and it made a wonderful presentation.  I also coated the bird breast in a mix of sage, rosemary, and basil and left it over night (after skinning.) It was HEAVENLY!

This was really good. I used a small turkey, not just the turkey breast. Left out the turkey gravy since I didn't have any. Added garlic powder and black pepper instead of the garlic pepper and also added poultry seasoning. The turkey was effortless to make and so tender. Everyone ate it right up!

This year I made Thanksgiving dinner, for the first time ever, for just me and my husband and I didn't want to make an entire turkey.  This worked out perfectly.  It gave me more room in my oven for other side dishes and the meat was very moist.  The only complaint was the very top of the turkey was a little dry.  Next time I make this I think I'll leave just a little of the skin on to keep it moist.  This smells wonderful!

I made a lot of changes but this turned out beautifully. I added thyme and rosemary and omitted bacon, flour and worc. sauce. I added pats of butter on the bird. We got turkey breasts on sale (grocery store grand opening) for 39 cents a pound. I see a lot of turkey in our future! ;-)

Juciest most flavorful turket ever! My mom raved about it- and she's cooked a lot of turkey in her day. I rubbed the skin of the breast down with olive oil then rubbed on the seasoning (sage- 2 tsp, thyme- 1 tsp, rosemary- 1 tsp, pepper- 1/2 tsp).I tucked chopped onion and celery under the breast, tied it like others had suggested. I put 5 slices of soft-cooked bacon on top of the breast. Used the whole packet of gravy include with the turkey, added a bay leaf and a couple of cups of chicken broth. I did all the prep the night before so all I had to do in the morning was plug in the slow cooker. Because the slow cooker had been in the fridge and was cold, I set it on high for 1 hour, then reduced it to medium for about 2 hours, then low for 7 hours. It was a 7.5 pound bone-in breast. Perfect- and it kept the oven available for other dishes!

I just made this recipe today as we were getting together for a early Easter celebration ( could not all get together at the same time1!)  It turned out great!!! So well, that there is just enough for my hubby to have a meal tommorrow night.  Everyone wanted to take some home with them.  The only variation I made was to add a can of cream of chicken soup, apple slices and butter.  I also did not use bacon, as I did not want this flavor to overpower.  Also left out the worcestershire sauce and added an onion.  Guess I changed it a tad;-)  I got up late, so I cooked mine on high for 5 hours breast side down.  It was about a 6 lb skin on breast.  After it was done, I placed it on a platter and covered with foil.  My hubby sliced it, and everyone said it was the best turkey they have EVER had.  No more whole bird for use again.  I will ALWAYS purchase the breast and cook in crock pot.....holidays included. No waste and melt in your mouth meal.  Needless to say, I was the mom with the mostest today;-)))

Moist and yummy! I know this is a major change, but I used a can of condensed french onion soup instead of a can of gravy; I highly recommend this if you are looking for something a little different! The gravy I made with the resulting juices was soooo good. Excellent recipe that made our Turkey Day much easier! I had a half a bird instead of a breast, about 5 lbs, and I cooked it on high for an hour then turned it to low for about 4 hours, then held it on warm for another hour while I finished everything else up. Tasted great, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. Next time I make it, I won't use the canned turkey gravy the recipe calls for (it tastes too artificial). I'd probably add 1-2 cups chicken stock and omit the bacon. Definitely rub with olive oil or butter to keep moist. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this today using a 9 lb bone in turkey breast.  It was still partially frozen when I put it in the pot, so the lid didn't fit.  Covered the pot with tin foil for the first hour until it cooked down enough to use the lid.  I doubled all of the other ingredients since the meat was almost twice the size recommended...used the gravy packet that came with the turkey breast and also a jar from the store.  I omitted the bacon - didn't have any.  I didn't miss it.  I also didn't have garlic pepper, so I used half black pepper and half garlic powder, which worked well.  Cooked it on low for 8 hours, then let it sit on the warm setting for about an hour until I finished up the sides.  I served it with stuffing, jelled cranberries, mashed potatoes, corn and crescent rolls.  I drained the gravy and juice from the pot after I took the turkey out (turkey literally fell apart) and whipped up a thick gravy on the stove by adding a few tablespoons of cornstarch.  Also used a slow cooker liner and there is virtually NO cleanup.  This is a good recipe.  Not sure I would replace the regular oven turkey with this at Thanksgiving, but it is a good recipe for other times of the year when you are in the mood for turkey.  Both my 2 and 4 year olds ate it right up.  Looking forward to making something with the leftovers for the next couple of nights.

I was amazed at how tender and juicy the turkey breast came out.  I used two packets of Knorr's Turkey Gravey.  I sliced a medium onions and place that on the bottom of the crock pot with 3 celery stalks and one large carrot sliced. Placed turkey breast on top and cooked.  I seasoned by turkey with thyme, salt, pepper and parsley.  Yum, yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Made with 4 bone-in chicken breasts (I kept the skin on the chicken, and I browned it slightly in a frying pan for some color before putting it in the slow cooker).  I used a dry packet mix of roasted chicken gravy (whisked with water according to packet directions).  I omitted the bacon, and I used just a couple of dashes of Worcestershire & a light sprinkle of ground sage, garlic powder, & fresh ground black pepper.  Cooked in slow cooker on low for 6 1/2 hours.  After removing the cooked chicken, I made gravy by straining all liquid from the slow cooker into a saucepan.  I then added a couple of spoonfuls of flour and whisked on the stove top until slightly thickened.  The results were amazing!  The chicken was very moist & tender.  Just a note: I placed the chicken bone-side-down in the slow cooker.

brilliant! did the Christmas Turkey (a whole 4kg bird) this way I did slightly overcook it by leaving it for 12 hours.  As I didn't have any gravy I just poured water on it - just make sure water isn't more than till half of the crock pot, because as the turkey cooks it will let out more succulent juices and might overflow (mine came awefully close). After it was done, I added cornflour to the juices and made a lovely gravy and put the turkey under the grill for 15 mins to crispen the skin.  I had loads of compliments on how tender, crispy and flavourful the turkey was.

This was absolutely amazing - I took the suggestion of one of the reviewer's and layered the bacon over the turkey breast instead of frying it up, crumbling it and adding it to the other ingredients.  I have passed this recipe along to everybody I know.

This was really excellent!  Everyone in my house enjoyed it.  I used 14.5 oz can of gravy to compensate for the fact that the turkey breast I found was more like six lbs.    I seasoned the meat before putting it in the crockpot with a bit of salt along with the garlic.  At the end, my daughter's friend wistfully wanted gravy.  So I took out the turkey and sliced it up and added a couple tablespoons of corn starch to the crockpot (pulled out some of the hot broth, mixed it with the corn starch, added back to crock and stirred).  Cooked this on high for about 20-30 min.  Perfect!  Really this is so good.

Amazing! I omitted the bacon b/c I didn't want that strong flavor overpowering the meat. Turned out to be the most moist and flavorful turkey I've ever made. Everyone except my niece only eats white meat so it was nice not to see all the waste and to free up the oven with a whole turkey. To please the dark meat lover I bought a couple of turkey legs separately and laid them on the sides of the breast...out came two perfect legs for my niece! Everyone was happy.

Leave skin on, don't cook for 8 hours, try 6. Nice flavor and it makes good gravy!

What a simply wonderful recipe for turkey.  I used a 6lb bones-in turkey breast & it was so moist and flavorful.  How easy is this?  I prepared exactly as written with small exceptions, used garlic powder and black cracked pepper, and only three bacon strips, and skipped the flour.  Started on high for about an hour or so since the bird was cold, and finished another 7 on low.  I ran the gravy through a seive into a pan, got the gravy simmering, and whisked in a slurry of flour/water to thinken.  Delicious and a definite do-over, for sure!  Thanks Eating Indy, I'll use this one often.

This was the easiest way to do a turkey honestly.  I had a 3 pound boneless turkey breast completely frozen and put it in the crock pot with all the ingredients (used turkey gravy mix instead of gravy in a jar).  My turkey breast was done in 8 hours on low and so tender and juicy.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

Simply amazing!  The turkey fell off the bone... I didn't have to carve one piece!  It was juicy and full of flavor!  I started it at 12am and it cooked until 11am.  The turkey was too high to cover the crock pot so I put 5 sheets of aluminum foil over the top to keep in the juices... This is the best turkey recipe ever!!!!!

This one works!  I never imagined slow-cooked turkey would turn out well but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Recipe was a lifesaver as I was working all day before running home to serve dinner.  Guests loved it!  Since I didn't find bone-in turkey breast, I ended up throwing in boneless turkey breast along with drumsticks.  Before serving, I did take some of the sauce and mixed with cornstarch to thicken and serve as gravy.

I made a couple of changes: no bacon or gravy, and I used GF flour and about a cup of water. I used an 8 lb turkey breast so I doubled the other ingredients.  I slow cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hrs, then low for another 2 hrs.  It was delicious and very moist.  It fed my family of 4 with enough leftovers for at least 4 -5 other meals.  I'm really excited to have found this recipe, I will use it often!

This was wonderful! I was thinking of doing it for TG, but wanted a trail run. I got a 3.5 breast, and a 2 lb thigh, because my husband likes dark meat. I left the skin on, because I think it would make it moister. I had a 16 ounce carton of gravy, so I saved the extra and later, mixed it all together to make the gravy. I also added 1/2 of broth. I used half the Worcester sauce, because my mom is watching her sodium.   I also made the crockpot stuffing found on this site, and used some of the gravy to improve the taste of the stuffing.   I am ready for the holidays!!

So easy and great for making gravy out of the crock pot. Strained the juices from the pot and just added a bit of corn starch and water mix.

Wow excellent.  The breast came out so juicy.  I didn't have turkey gravy so I used cream of chicken soup and added 1/2 cup of water.  Poured a lil bit of Worsche, some garlic salt and garlic herb.  Cooked a 4.5 lb on low for 6 hours.  Turned out wonderful!

I tried this turkey for the first time this past weekend, but after carefully reading the reviews, I altered this recipie slightly as well to suit my tastes. I had no garlic pepper, but instead added rosemary and thyme in equal parts to the sage. I used a jar of store bought gravy, but also thinned it out with some water and left over chicken broth. This left a TON of liquids for gravy afterwards, which is great, because my family puts gravy on everything on their turkey plates. Just a little roux in a pan and instant gravy goodness. I also sort of arranged the turkey breast on its side, so I flipped it about half way through to ensure both breasts cooked in liquid for a while. The result was fantastic. I had friends over and received nothing but rave reviews at the dinner table! I enjoyed the bacon and worcestershire sauce, it wasn't overwhelming at all since I thinned the liquids, but it did add a nice touch. I will definitely be using this recipie again as the winter months approach, such a fantastic cold night meal!

Since reading this recipe I have made it several times and it always yields a very tender turkey.  I also have tried it with a boneless breast and it is great.  I make it exactly according to directions except I left the skin on.  You won't be sorry and what a time saver.

Made this for my new slow cooker's debut at family Mother's Day dinner.  Made just as written, but doubled the sauce and used a 6.5 # turkey breast.  Used turkey bacon and 98% fat free turkey gravy to cut down on the calories and fat.  Everyone loved it, and it was so easy I can have turkey often!  Thanks, Eating Indy.

This was neat way to do turkey.  I used about a 7 lb. breast and cooked on low for 6.5 hrs.  It was a little dry even though I did add a can of chicken broth.  The only thing that I didn't count on was I couldn't get the breast out of the pot in one piece.  It just fell apart, although not necessarily a bad thing.  I also just added salt and pepper.  I didn't try making gravy because I had a hard time getting it out but I will try it next time.  All in all it was tasty and will make it this way again but I will try cutting the cooking time a little.

I made this for the first time three years ago for a carry in at work.  I put the turkey in the crock pot prior to leaving for work and let the rest of the cooking happen while we were waiting for lunch time.  By the time lunch came around my team at work was just about salivating over the smell!  It was a hit and I was asked for teh recipe by all.  Since then, my mom and and I have used this every Thanksgiving!  Thank you for such a great and easy way to do a turkey!

PERFECT! I will never put another turkey in the oven again, even at Thanksgiving! This was GREAT!!  The meat just fell off the bone so we had turkey for days afterwards! And it was only a 3.5lb breast! Thank you so much, this is an excellent recipe and I'll use it again and again!

I only added half the amount of Worchestershire sauce, and I still thought the taste was a bit strong. The breast I used was finished cooking after 4 hours on low, so I put the crockpot on warm for a couple of hours until we were ready to eat. The meat was a bit dry. It probably would have been perfect after 4 hours. I may try again using less WS and cutting down the cooking time a bit.

We were looking forward to this and had high hopes, but my turkey came out kind of stringy and dry and hard to choke down, in spite of being kind of "wet" from the gravy and juices.  We didn't like it at all.  Maybe the 8 hours was too long?  I'm not sure why it was so bad.  I tend to think with so many good reviews, maybe I did something wrong.  Maybe I added too much gravy based on the size of the breast?  I won't do another turkey in a crockpot.  If it were a pot roast, it would be nice and tender and falling apart, but that wasn't really how I wanted my turkey.

This recipe is fool-proof. We served it with a roasted turkey from Whole Foods and everyone agreed that the slow-cooked turkey was superior in taste and texture. It was also much easier to manage the rest of the cooking with the turkey not occupying the oven. The only problem is that it is a little harder to carve since the meat is so tender, it kind of just crumbles.

Perfect for two. Would feed 3-4 easy, but don't expect any left overs. My boyfriend and I work graveyards, so we came home from work, I threw this together, I added a couple whole bacon strips across the top of the turkey, then let the slow cooker do its thing while we slept. We woke up mouths watering. I have to mention I like this recipe because I don't cook but this was easy.

We were amazed at how tender the turkey turned out but it was a little too salty. I would recommend a low sodium gravy.

LOVED this! BF raved about it and asked for seconds. My first time cooking turkey and I am happy about its success.  Like others I tweaked it a bit for my tastes. No bacon. No sage. Rubbed EVOO and minced garlic all over the 3.5 lb boneless butterball turkey, added the gravy that came with the turkey, flour, worchestershire sauce, garlic pepper, and some onion. Cooked on high for 2.5hrs and on low for another 1.5 hour or so. Smelled amazing and came out tender, juicy, and DELICIOUS! It's a keeper for sure.

I used a 7.5 pound bone-in breast, it was still done in about 7 hours. I also sliced an onion and added it in the beginning, and did 7 strips of bacon instead of 5. About halfway through cook time I added a can of turkey broth because it was looking a little dry. It was fantastic, definitely one of the better turkeys I've had. If I do a small Thanksgiving next year, I might reuse this recipe for that occasion.

Made this for the first time yesterday, on Thanksgiving.  We followed the recipe exactly, except we cut the sage in half because we're not huge sage fans.  We put everything in the crock pot, turned it on, and then went kayaking.  I was worried by the reviews that said it was too salty or too dry, but ours was perfect.  Tender and flavorful, and unbelievably easy.  We're going to make it again on Christmas.  Thank you Eating Indy!

I made this for my small family on Thanksgiving with a 3 lb. boneless breast.  Only took 6 hours and could have been less. My boyfriend raved about it so much, he bought another breast that I am cooking today.  Glancing at previous reviews, I omitted the Worch. and being a garlic freak, I really lathered on the garlic pepper and poultry seasoning. Threw in the packet of gravy included with the turkey; whipped up a  packet of gravy I had on hand instead of canned; added a cup of chicken broth and turned breast over halfway through cooking. Prayed that all this would avoid a dry turkey.  The result - a VERY moist and delicious turkey.  BF raved about the extra kick it had.  Is a keeper, especially for being soo easy!!

This was a very easy way to make delicious and moist turkey, which wasn't too heavily flavored - making it easy to use leftovers in other recipes.

Great recipe!  Using only 4 pieces of bacon it left a very strong taste in the gravy.  I will use only 3 pieces next time.  
Also, my turkey was done in only 6 hours on low.
I can't wait to make it again!

To answer the question below; the crumbled bacon is mixed with the gravy, flour, worcestershire and sage before pouring over the turkey breast.

I cooked two breasts; one roasted and the other using this recipe. This one came out much juicier, and the flavor is fantastic (you can play with the spices to suit your own tastes). A definite keeper!

I guess I just don't get the reason for the bacon. I strained the bacon out as I didn't think it was that appealing with the pan juices but did thicken the juices for gravy. Turkey was moist and flavorful. I grated fresh garlic (as I didn't have the garlic pepper) and added black pepper with it. Would make this again as I have yet to find another recipe to my liking.

This was awesome!!! My boyfriend loves the whole Thanksgiving dinner...year round. And I wowed him the other night with this recipe. I did not cook it for 8 hours on low. It was closer to 6 hours on low and it was so juicy! I want to buy more crock pots and make this for the real Thanksgiving.

This is the best turkey I've EVER eaten. I have never made Thanksgiving turkey before so this was a good rookie recipe. It came out moist and delicious. Now we have to decide whether we preferred the turkey that night or the next day on our sandwiches with cranberry sauce.

the best turkey i have ever had!  my husband went crazy over it.  it's very tender and falls right off the bone.      i added more gravy b/c we like tons of gravy with our turkey.  if the skin hardened then it would be the best turkey in the world!  very satisfied with this recipe and it's super easy.

This is such a delicious recipe. Doing this recipe for Thanksgiving as the main dish gave me so much more time to work on my side dishes, as well as my desserts. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. I will repeat this recipe again for Thanksgiving.

Didn't use any turkey gravy or the bacon because I didn't have any on hand. Also, used 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon dried sage becase my husband isn't a big fan of sage. Added some carrots so I could squeeze in some veggies with the meal (which I do not suggest because the carrots lost their flavor. I know, DUH! YOU THINK???) Also, I had to use aluminum foil and a towel to cover the crockpot because my turkey breast was too big and cooked for 10 hours because the turkey was in the deep freezer. Still waiting for it to cook so I'll leave a better feedback later. ***UPDATE*** Husband came home for lunch. He finally got the turkey to squish down enough to cover with the lid. By the time I came home at 5:00 PM, the turkey was done so I put it on the WARM setting. Great taste and texture. I finally made a gravy with the drippings by mixing some garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, parsley, and enough cornstarch to thicken up a bit (I was tired so I did it the easy way). Served with "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing" and " Best Green Bean Casserole" using " Cream of Mushroom Soup I" instead of the canned stuff for the green bean casserole.

I like the concept of making a turkey breast in a slow cooker, so I gave it a try.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and when I checked the internal temperature, it was done.  I held it on warm for an hour and it was still very moist.  Next time I will cook it at the lower setting and check it after 4 hours. I did not have turkey gravy, so substituted a 1/2 cup of stock.   When the turkey was done, the slow cooker yielded about 4 cups of liquid.  Plenty of juice for gravy.  I did use the bacon; in the end did not affect the flavor of the turkey much, but made the gravy liquid a bit too smoky and overwhelmed the turkey flavor.  I will not use the bacon again.  All in all,  this is a good basic recipe.  I'd definitely experiment with more fresh herbs and spices next time, while omitting the bacon.

Awesome turkey. So easy to throw in the crock pot the night before and have a mock thanksgiving dinner ready when you get home. My husband threw in a can of turkey broth when I wasnt there and it actually made the turkey lose some of its moisture (I've noticed the slow cooker with chicken and to much liquid does that too) Next time I will be sure to do it when he's no where around. The meat was fall off the bone tender and I wont hesitate to use this recipe again. My boys just gobbled it up, no pun intended.

Very good.  Didn't have garlic pepper so I used 1/2 teaspoon garlic power and 1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper.  Used some of the leftover liquid with a little cornstarch and flour to make gravy. The gravy was awesome.

8 hours was way too much for a turkey breast even with the skin on. I'm sure it would be fantastic after 4 hours in the crock pot.

This was wonderful!  With it just being my husband and myself, I used 2 pounds of boneless turkey breast tenderloins.  After reading the reviews I decided to put my own spin on things to make sure that it stayed moist.  Along with the gravy, flour, wor. sauce, garlic and pepper, I added a 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth to cover the turkey completely.  (I did leave out the bacon, didn't think it needed it.)  I then added 5 leaves of fresh sage and 6 sprigs of fresh thyme.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and it was done, but since we weren't ready to eat yet I turned it to warm for another 4 hours.  It turned out SOOOOO moist and juicy, and tasty!  I will definitely be making this all year round!

I've made a similar recipe for years in my crockpot whenever my family needs a turkey "fix", and the meat is always tender and moist.  I always add onion and celery, along with a can of chicken broth to the crockpot to impart stuffing-like flavor to both the turkey and gravy--just thicken before serving.  Don't know what bacon is doing in this dish, though, so that's why I only rated 4 stars.

This was a very moist turkey and I loved not having to baste it every so often.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that we used a skin-on turkey and I had to put it in the oven to brown so it looked nice on the platter.  But, it was worth it for the ease of the rest of the time!  Thank you for the recipe!

This turned out really GREAT! I used a butterball boneless turkey breast and it even came with a gravy packet that I used for the sauce. The flavor was really wonderful. The bacon crumbles made a difference - adding a really nice flavor to the gravy. I did strain the gravy off and use on potatoes and the turkey.  My husband and all three children cleaned their plates!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made exactly as stated, and it came out fine, flavored nicely. In my crock pot, I should have taken it out at 6 hours, but it was still good. There wasn't enough gravy for us, so I had to use another jar to serve over the turkey. I will probably add some onion and celery next time.

Quick, easy and oh so good! My family says they prefer this over the oven roasted turkey. So it leaves alot more oven space for other goodies. I followed the other suggestions of adding a little extra turkey broth half way thru cooking time. I dont think I'll be making another turkey breast in the oven again!

We only use the gravy mix and poultry seasoning, skipping the rest of the ingredients.  I hate people who review a recipe and do that, but I thought the recipe itself was great for suggesting a cooking method that I never would have thought about trying so giving it 5 stars.

This was so easy and it turned out great.  I did not use Worcestershire sauce nor the can of gravy.  I had a 6 1/2 pound turkey breast & cooked it on high for 4 hours, then low for 2 hours.

I have to admit, I was very skeptical about making turkey in the slow cooker that would even remind me of Thanksgiving...but it really did!  I did use thighs instead of the breast just for preference only and although I wouldn't eat it for Thanksgiving because I just love a turkey roasting in the oven, I will eat it any other time of the year.  This came out delicious!

My husband absolutely loved this. I agree the turkey comes out very moist. I am just a skin lover so it is hard for me to have turkey without the skin.

I didn't care for this at all.  The turkey was tender, but the flavors didn't mix for me.

This was wonderful! I did not use canned gravy. I had some homemade gravy in the freezer from the last time we smoked a turkey. It really flavored the turkey. I will definitely be making this again.

This may be one of the best recipes to date!  I made it pretty much to speck with the exception of exact measurements - I'm a "little bit of this and a little bit of that" kind of girl. =-)   Next time I think I'll throw in an apple and a sweet onion, just to add in some sweetness - but that's just how our family likes it - honestly - this recipe is perfection!

Wow, what a very tender turkey!  Mine was 4.75 pounds and was done in 6 hours.  I did it the night before so it was ready to put in the slow cooker.  Three of us ate this and none of us could taste the bacon (I used 4 pieces) or the Worcestershire Sauce.  As most reviewers, I used the gravy packet that came with the turkey and a jar of turkey gravy.  The taste and texture was phenomenal.  Can't wait to see how it taste on a sandwich tomorrow!

made this as per recipe but without the bacon.  Turned the breast halfway through.  While turkey was cooking I made a loaf of white bread in my bread machine and made open face hot turkey sandwiches for dinner.  Everyone really liked them.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  I was looking forward to coming home to a house smelling of turkey and having a delicious meal. I came home to a house smelling not much like turkey--more like bacon.   I followed the recipe with minor changes:  I did not use garlic pepper, but substituted garlic powder and I used a slightly smaller turkey breast, but added 2 turkey thighs with the skin removed.  

My turkey was very dry, despite having put a small bit of turkey skin on top, as one reviewer suggested.  The turkey just didn't taste good to me at all.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, although I've never used canned gravy before and I wasn't really impressed with it coming out of the can.  My turkey had a bacon-y flavor even though I used only the 5 slices the recipe called for.
 
My daughter and I wouldn't eat more than a few bites.  My son ate a bit more, although he wasn't happy with it.  The only saving grace is that my husband finished it off.  He thought it was ok, but wasn't overly impressed, and although he ate it, agreed that this is one I shouldn't try again.

This was pretty good. For some reason I didn't like the bacon taste with the turkey?!  Anyway I may try this again with a few adjustments like no bacon and adding carrots, onion and celery to the pot.

Made our Thanksgiving turkey for three fall right off the bone. I decided not to use the bacon (I'm not one for mixing meats) and added a can of chicken stock, poultry seasoning, sliced carrots and celery to the broth. My crock pot was quite full...but a little foil on the lid and turning the turkey once gave us a tender and juicy bird. After only 6.5-7 hours it was ready. Next time, I might try using less broth/gravy and after about 4-5 hrs. putting it in the oven to brown the skin.

I used home made frozen turkey gravy I had in my freezer as well as frozen turkey stock to make sure it was moist and gave us lots of gravy.  It was very good, but I will leave out the bacon next time, it was a kind of wierd flavour in the finished gravy.  But the turkey was moist and delicious.  A 4 lb breast gave us a lovely meal with enough left over for a casserole or sandwiches tonight.

Excellent, easy way to cook a turkey breast.  This was my 1st time cooking one and was so simple.  I added some chicken broth to keep it moist and I cut back on cooking time about an hour.  The meat fell off the bone and had great flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!!

We love turkey and have it 3 or 4 times during the cold months, I taper off from June to November so we appreciate it again at Thanksgiving.  I will fix this again BUT never at Thanksgiving because this is a time for a truly traditional roasted turkey with crispy skin and with all the trimmings.  I can understand why this dish is so popular with younger women who work.  The taste was wonderful.  I used it as I would left overs when I do my traditional version......it's rather a "gloppy mess" but since it tasted so good it's also good for "leftover" dishes.  I prepared this following the recipe as described but (sorry) I did omit the bacon, I only like that in a tomato, turkey and bacon sandwich. :-)    I gave it a good rating because I didn't want my personal preferences to drag down the rating just because I wanted to express my opinion of it.  Thanks

Wow! This was so good. As with others, I also adapted my own recipe.  I chopped up onion and 2 ribs of celery and cooked it in butter in a skillet until aromatic. Then I added the onion and celery to crock pot with 3 cups of chicken stock, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, bunch of fresh thyme . I put the breast skin side up, sprinkled with season salt (I use "Crazy Salt") and finally I lay 5 pieces of bacon on top. (Skin and bacon got discarded when turkey was cooked through. It took about 6 hours on high (approx. 8 lb breast). It makes the turkey very flavorful and the juice it cooks in makes really delicious gravy.
For the gravy, I took 1/2 cup of butter in skillet over medium heat and slowly added 1/2 cup of flour and seasoned with cracked pepper. To that I added 4 cups of the reserved cooking juice and whisked ountil thickened.

This is a great way to have turkey for sandwiches when you don't want that fake sliced stuff sold in the stores.  I didn't add the can of turkey gravy because to me, the stuff just looks awful in the jar or can.  I just used the juices from cooking the turkey breast to make my own gravy.  I love the fact that I can put this in a slow cooker and forget about it, almost no work or cleanup at all.

Very mosit and tasty. Will be cooking again.Left out Worcestershire and added a little liquid smoke. Used Johnny's Grub Rub from this site instead of garlic and and laid a couple of bacon strips over the breast to help keep it moist.  Cooking time is more like 5-6 hours.

This was great! I used a 3lb. turkey breast, still partially frozen.  The only thing I would do differently would be to throw a potato in the crock while its cooking. I'm not sure if its because I used the gravy packet that came with the turkey, but it was a bit salty. The next day, the leftovers were super salty-tasting for some reason. I will definitely be making this again though!

I loved this recipe and will absolutely use it again!  I did a few things differently, however.  I soaked it in a brine overnight (2 cups salt, 1 cup sugar, water, rosemary, thyme, pepper).  The next day I put it in the crock pot as directed.  I didn't use the bacon, but used fresh herbs instead.  I also used fresh garlic and pepper as a rub.  It was awesome!  I think I'll use this for Thanksgiving next year.  My turkey was so moist and delicious!  YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe is delicious, plain and simple.  I find excuses to make it so I can have stuffing and mashed potatoes with gravy.  The turkey is delicious.  I have done it for 6 hours and also for longer.  Either way it is so good.  Did someone say stuffing?

This was so moist and delicious!  My husband said the only thing missing was the smell of a roasting turkey.  He said this was a keeper.  I added the gravy packet from the turkey in addition to the rest of the ingredients.  This is so easy to make and was the right size for my family with leftovers.

Made it this year, my first ever Thanksgiving Turkey....and it wasa fantastic! The turkey was so moist and it made fantastic gravy. The only thing I changed was I used turkey bacon. It tasted great. It's going to be a staple in my home on thanksgiving:)

This is a keeper.  I used the gravy packet that came with the turkey and used a jar of gravy. I didn't use the bacon. I turned the turkey half way through the cooking cycle. My turkey was moist and tender.  I used Honeysuckle White.

Made this tonight with a few variations and it was delicious. I didnt use the bacon and used the gravy packet that came with 3 pound breast. Mixed the gravy with the other ingredients and poured over breast. Basted twice while it cooked. Cooked 6 hours on low and it was super moist and delicious. Great recipe!

I really wanted to try this recipe but when I went to the market I found that the turkey breasts were a little out of my budget. I had three whole chickens at home all ready so I just picked up the spices and a can of chicken gravy. other than that I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was wonderful. I had so much left over because my family consists of two adults and two small children. So I added 1 cup of water and a chiken bullion to the "gravy" and two more tablespoons of flour and 1/2 cup of cold water. I finished pulling the chicken off of the bone added that and between 2-4 cups of cooked rice. I did this to freeze and use later as a chicken and rice dish. of course I tasted it before I froze it and from now on I will serve this as a chicken and rice dish. I also can't wait to try it with the turkey!!!!!

This came out so good!  Followed the directions exactly.  The meat was falling off the bone! I did have to split the breast in half because it was to tall for my slow cooker. My husand requests it all the time now!

This recipe is great and very easy to make even for people that are challanged in the kitchen.  I do have a question, what do you do with the package of gravy that comes with the Turkey Breast?  Can something be done with it?

I had to stay up at university this year with my boyfriend, so it was up to us to make a turkey. Neither of us had ever attempted a full Thanksgiving turkey before, but it turned out great! I used an 8.5 lb bird instead of the breast suggested in this recipe and cooked it a little longer, and I also added a can of stock just to make sure there was enough moisture. I also stuffed the bird with apples, oranges, carrots, and onions, and some herbs from the garden. This turned out wonderfully! The meat was literally falling off the bone, and everything was so tasty! I think next time I'll toss in some fresh vegetables for the heck of it, too.

This was GREAT. Turkey was moist and fell off the bone. Not too spicey but had good taste. Made putting on the Thanksgiving family meal much easier with a whole lot less stress and mess!

This is wonderful.  My husband thought it would fall off the bone.  But it didn't.  It stayed whole and was very easy to slice.  Made great gravy too.  Thank you!

This recipe is fantastic.  Not only did the turkey turn out moist and delicious, it allowed me to cook side items in the oven.  So easy.  A definite winner.

This is the BEST turkey ever. For the past four years my family and friends enjoy a fabulous dish. The only tip I have is to put the slices of bacon uncooked on top of the breast. Trust me you won't regret it! The drippings from the bacon tenderize the meat with a wonderful flavor. I hope you all enjoy it as much as we do!

This was delicious!  I was VERY nervous about trying this recipe.  I hate wasting turkey on lousy recipes where it turns out dry :( I didn't have sage so I used poultry seasoning...I used two smaller turkey breasts since that was all that I had.  Everyone loved it...EVEN my two children ages 9 & 11 who complained when I said we were having turkey they wanted pancakes.  They thought it was great and even had second & third helpings.  I will do this one FOR SURE...great for a working mom who wants to put on the table a great healthy dinner at the end of a day!

This is REALLY good and tasty, and very easy to prepare. I always have bacon grease on hand from when I fry bacon, then can use the grease with some of the Hormel cooked bacon bits instead of frying up bacon for every recipe. A real time-saver.

Good, but needs more seasoning. I think next time I'll add poultry seasoning and possibly cover the turkey with bacon to hold in some of the juices.

I made this for Thanksgiving since it was just my husband and I and our 2 children. It was so moist and delicious!  Alan hates turkey because he said it's always too dry.  He took this to work the next day!  So easy and good!  A keeper!

Amazing! I left it on low for 8 hours and them warm for 2 until it was time for dinner and the meat literally fell off the bones! It was tender and juicy. I doubled the gravy because my turkey was larger then the one called for, then made a roux to thicken it after I removed the turkey from the crock pot. Def going to use this at the holidays!

I had an almost 4 pound bone in half turkey breast.  I followed the recipe, however I only had powdered gravy mix, so I made that and poured in over the breast.  Cooked for 5 hours on low.  It was falling apart.  I just took a pair of tongs and pulled the meat off the bone.  It was so moist and delicious.  Will probably do my Thanksgiving boneless turkey breast this way.  Wonderful !

Easy recipe.  Just make sure the meat is covered by liquid or has bacon on top (or else the meat on that side is very dry)

This is very tasty turkey, BUT...I will never cook it in the Crock Pot again!!  I'm sorry, I just have to have a golden brown bird.  I will peel back the skin and sprinkle the recipe ingredients on top along with minced onion and garlic, which I also added to this recipe.  Then I'll pull the skin back over the flesh and bake.  The only thing the crock pot really saves, I think, is energy.  It's just as easy to throw the breast on a baking stone and throw it in the oven.

I absolutely fell in love with this recipe, as did my fiance! I have made it a few times now. I add some of the grease from the bacon into the sauce, as well as additional spices - poultry seasoning, margarom, thyme, salt, pepper & garlic. I've never had turkey so juicy! You must try this!

This was "OK". I made an "after T-Day" dinner last night for my parents, my bf & myself. I wanted an EASY main dish (I didn't want to roast a whole turkey for just the 4 of us). While this is good, it is not how I prefer my turkey to be prepared. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender (plus), but lacked in appearance (negative). I could have broiled for a few minutes to brown it.... I made several changes (improvements, no doubt). Here's what I did: a) followed reviewer, LEXIANDJACK's suggestions to use the turkey gravy packet incl. w/ the meat; seasoned w/ sage, thyme, cracked black pepper & salt (did not measure amts. - and rubbed EVOO all over  first); and added a bay leaf, chopped celery (2-3 in. pcs.) & a sm. onion (quartered) to the sc. I never basted the turkey (didn't need to, left skin on...). Also tied my "roast" w/ kitchen twine so that it would not fall apart. I did add bacon & W sauce, but think it was a mistake to do so.... I ended up not using the gravy at all! The bacon was soggy (yuck!) & difficult to strain out. I just warmed up a jar of T gravy to serve alongside. Had I NOT added the bacon, it would have been easy to skim the fat, add flour & turn the sc to high to make gravy. Maybe covering the meat with a few strips of smoked bacon as suggested by naples34102 would be more practical (oh well, for next time I guess...). Thanks for sharing!

This was just wonderful, snd so easy! I left the skin on for added moistness, but took it off before slicing the turkey. I used a jar of gravy instead of canned, but it still didn't taste like homemade (hence 4 stars, not 5). But the turkey itself was so moist and tender! A 7-lb breast cooked to perfection in 5 hours. After slicing the meat, I returned it to the crock pot, where the gravy kept it warm and moist. Great with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce, any time of year!

Pretty good...We did not care for the taste of the canned "fake" gravy & would maybe someday try it again using chicken or turkey broth & use the drippings to make a traditional gravy. The turkey texture was pretty good and it was a very easy meal. I found the recipe to be accurate for the timing of the turkey.

This was good.  It was my first time hosting Thanksgiving and it was just my boyfriend, my brother, and myself, so I didn't want to cook a whole turkey.  This is perfect for when you just want to cook some turkey, plus it left room in the oven for all the other stuff.

I made this just the way the recipe said with the one exception that I cooked it on low for 6.5 hours and it was perfect. I would have over cooked it if I had not read the previous review.

Of course I didn't follow the recipe! I've made this a few times, with Butterball boneless turkey breast roasts, and it's amazing! I plopped the roast(s) in the Pammed crock pot, sprinkled on s&p, some thyme, sage, and rosemary, added a bay leaf and poured the gravy packet(s) on top. Then I cover the turkey with 3-4 slices of uncooked bacon. I also add 1/2 to 1 c. Campbell's turkey gravy. For a single 3 lb roast cook on low for 4 1/2 hours, for two cook on low for six hours.

I made this in a roaster on 250F with a whole turkey! It was great! The turkey disappeared. I did add some broth and a jar if gravy as it cooked.

Had a whole half carcase (double breast with back attached) after severing off the legs and arms.  I added SALT as there is non listed in this recipe, thickened the gravy at the end but left all else the same - Excellent, thank you for posting this!

I love this recipe! Though I made minor changes (no sage, garlic powder and regular pepper instead of garlic pepper, and chicken instead of turkey gravy), this turned out fabulous! The meat was tender and fell right off the bone. It was not dry at all! This is a perfect and foolproof turkey for a couple or small group. I'm so glad I tried it!

I have used this recipe for the past three Thanksgivings, this year will be year 4.  It's excellent!!  My family loves it, and it doesn't get any easier than this.  My hubby smokes the dark meat and I use this recipe for the breasts.  I prepare the bacon the day before and I triple the gravy ingredients.  My cook time is usually less than stated. I have to use two crocks because I am usually using the breasts of a 24 lb. turkey to feed our large group.  This has become a tradition in our house now.

I tried this recipe with split chicken breasts. I also used chicken gravy instead. Heaven!! Can't wait to try with turkey as I originally planned... turkey is hard to find in Sept unless its ground.

I have made this recipe every year for several years now and have LOVED it more than any other turkey!  Very moist!  I have never made it quite the same as this recipe though.  I don't like bacon so have never included that.  I usually use the included turkey gravy packet that comes with the turkey breast instead of a can of turkey gravy. I have never skinned the turkey breast, but just usually rub a good amount of the seasonings under the skin.  It might be a bit dryer if you skinned the turkey, but I might try it this year as it would be a bit healthier that way. The sage and Worcestershire sauce do make an excellent flavor!  When it was time for making gravy, I use the drippings out of the crockpot and it makes for an excellent flavorful gravy!

The turkey breast was very moist and flavorful!  Cooked a 7lb bone-in breast for 5.5 hours (the first 2 hours on HIGH, the rest on LOW).  I was worried about salty gravy because of the bacon so I didn't add jar of gravy as suggested.  I did add about a cup of chicken stock and it was STILL super salty.  I had to add almost 2 more cups of water to the drippings in order to make a decent gravy.

After reading the reviews, I was really expecting something incredible, but it was disapointing. Maybe it was the brand of turkey gravy, but it had very little flavor. The only thing I changed was using fresh ground pepper and garlic powder since I did not have garlic pepper, otherwise I followed it exactly. My husband did eat it and said it was okay, but not anything he'd want again. I gave it 3 stars because he did eat it.

This was just okay. I think we simply like dark meat better than white. No matter what you do to white turkey/breast meat, it just tastes dry. The gravy and flavoring was good, but even after several hours on low in the crock pot, the meat was still dry. I think I'd try again but with dark meat.

Thanksgiving on a weeknight!  So easy and so good.  I backed off a bit with the bacon.  The first time I made it, I thought it overpowered the turkey taste.  I did trasnfer the juice to the stove top to thicken the gravy with flour water mixture.  Excellent gravy.    Could be done day before Thanksgiving dinners for additional gravy.  My family likes tons of gravy.  No more worries!  I will always have plenty..

I modified the recipe like another reviewer by using a 3 lb. boneless Purdue turkey, but other than that, followed the recipe to a T. Wonderfully tender and the juice made a mouth-watering gravy. I put the juice into a saucepan mixed with a little flour and whisked until thick. Mmmmmmm!! Thanks for this recipe, will definitely make it again!

this was a wonderful recipe!!! Only thing I did different was to add the gravy mix that comes with the turkey breast along with the jar of gravy. I also thinkened the juices with a cornstarch slurry.

This is good but I will leave out the bacon next time and add more sage.   The extremely tender meat is ideal for use in casseroles after the initial feast.

The bacon really adds flavor. Turkey can be bland and dry but this recipe really peps it up. I strained out the bacon and thickened the drippings with cornstarch for an ultra rich gravy. EXCELLENT!

I omitted the bacon. I cooked for 6 hours on low. The flavor was decent, but it was dry. I should have read reviews about adding chicken broth.

It was okay.  Didn't really have that Thanksgiving Turkey homemade taste.  It kind of reminded me of Turkey you'd get from a cheap sandwich shop.  Tender, yes, but flavor wise, I'd rather spend the time and do it right.

I followed the recipe exactly and found
my turkey breast to be dry and salty. 
And I basted the crud out of that sucker!

Could have been the gravy I used, but 
I've never had issues with that particular gravy before. If I were to make this again, I'd like to figure out
a way to make this a little less salty.

I used a turkey breast without the bone and it turned out very dry!  Make sure you use a bone-in.  I could tell there was potential though.

I must admit that I myself did not make this but my mother did and it was absolutely delicious! It was so moist and juicy we will definitely be slow cooking our turkeys more often!

The Best Turkey I have ever had.  Very moist; all the flavors mingle together in each bite of turkey.  I use a crock pot liner for easy, easy clean-up.

This is a wonderful, easy, recipe.  The next time I will leave out the bacon.  I added one stalk of sliced celery and a small chopped onion.  Everyone loved it, the turkey fell off the bone and the gravy was wonderful.

Chicken Pox cancelled our BIG Christmas dinner this year. This recipe still made it just like our big Christmas meal with none of the work !! Thanks for posting ! We are all white meat eaters and this was the answer. I am a big crock pot fan (usually roasts) and am thrilled to find something else we all love. I put in 2 cans of gravy as my hubby is a gravy head and the gravy turned out awesome after we thickened it up a bit with a roux.. 1st time we have succeeded with a good gravy. Thanks again!!

I used turkey breast cutlets instead of bone in turkey-- and I mixed pepper with garlic powder for the "garlic pepper."  I used more of the mix than called for-- but I didn't measure.  I thought the turkey came out really salty.  But, scraping off some of the sauce left a decent piece of moist turkey breast.  Served with some mashed potatoes with swiss cheese mixed in made for an unexciting, but decently edible meal.

I love using my crockpot, but this recipe did not work out for me at all.  I only used a 2.5 lb. turkey and maybe I cooked it too long, but the meat surface was dry and crusty.  There was hardly any gravy and it was very thin.  We salvaged the turkey for a casserole, but I won't make this one again.

I'm a mid 50's guy alone, and I made this in the crock pot. It is awesome & very easy. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and cook 2 packs of bacon, you'll need something to munch while this sweetheart cooks and the aroma fills you house.

We do this every Thanksgiving because I'm not wasting all day cooking.  It makes great leftovers (after soaking in gravy) and is so crazy easy.  I usually add extra gravy, Crisco or butter instead of Pam (which I forget to buy every year) and you really can dress the turkey however you like.  I usually do 2 3lb boneless breasts, and they are usually done at about 6.5/7 hrs (which I check by temp).  More time with family, oven is completely free for things that usually cook at the same temperature for the same time.

I used a 3# Butterball and the gravy packet it came with. Added a tablespoon of olive oil, tablespoon of poultry seasoning, teaspoon of garlic power and a little black pepper. I wiped the inside of the pot with oil in the hope of making clean-up a little easier. No bacon, no Worcester.  It was great.

I have made this twice so far and each time is more delicious than the last! I bought a turkey yesterday with this in mind (craving it!). I added some chicken brother to the crock pot at the start and again halfway through to make sure it stays moist. I also leave the skin on.

Loved it - needed to dial back cooking time and add a bit of turkey/chicken stock so that it doesn't get too dry - but results in fantastic turkey and gravy.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Could easily be made for Thanksgiving dinner. I couldn't find a 5 1/2pd  turkey so I used 7 and cooked it 9 hours. Could've probably went 8.

Soooo juicy and tasty! Never thought to make a Thanksgiving Turkey in the crockpot but very glad I did and so is my family. Only change I'd recommend is to cut the cooking time down a half hour.

Made this last Thanksgiving and am just now getting around to rating it. This was hands down the juiciest turkey i've ever had. It was shame that myself and my boyfriend could only muster a slice or two alongside all the other dishes i had prepared. It wasn't nearly as good the next day or the day after that, but right out of the slow-cooker?! EXCELLENT!

This is a really good way to be able to make turkey for less than a crowd. It is only hubby and I and I used a small turkey breats which came out perfectly. I imagine you could tweak this a little to your liking as well. I think I will try to spice it up a bit next time. Thanks

This was really good!  I'm not sure what the bacon did for the turkey, but it didn't seem to hurt the taste of the turkey at all.  Even with three people eating turkey, we still have plenty of leftovers.  Yum!

This was good, especially since it was just me and two toddlers. Glad to have found a recipe for a small family. I didn't use the bacon, though, since other reviewers complained of the taste. I gave it 4 stars because it was a little dry; I will cook it with the breast facing down like others have suggested next time. I am using this recipe again for Christmas.

I skipped the bacon-sorry, it just seemed wrong, but I stuck to the rest and loved it! Nice and moist and I loved the flavor. Poured juice into pan and whipped into a thick gravy with extra flour. Thanks for recipe!

I used a smaller turkey breast (3.5 pounds). I only added celery, onion, thyme, 1 bay leaf, salt and pepper. I cooked it on low for 3 hours and on high for 2 hours. It was wonderful!!

This was the BEST turkey we've every had.  The meat was so moist -not like turkey I've had in the past!  I cooked it for 6 hours on high and then 2 on low.  It fell off the bone!  The meat was still moist the next day for sandwiches.  No more dry turkey for us!
I only cooked it in a large jar of turkey gravy.  I didn't have bacon but I probably wouldn't have used it anyway.
Definately a keeper.  We'll be eating alot more turkey in the future.

Since it's only my husband and me at home, a turkey breast is a good alternative to a whole turkey.  However, traditional cooking methods can result in the meat being dry.  The beauty of doing the breast in a slow cooker is that it comes out moist, and I'm always looking for different slow cooker recipes.  This one was great!  I used bacon bits instead of the actual bacon and a cup of gravy prepared from a packaged mix instead of the canned gravy.  This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty good but a bit bland.  Next time I would add onions and celery, poultry seasoning and a good jar or can of gravy.

This was the answer to my Thanksgiving prayers. My family only likes the breast of the turkey. I was afraid that just baking it in the oven would dry it out. This was a great alternative. It came out moist and tender, just delicious. Thanks

Made this yesterday, big hit! I went and bought two 3lb frozen turkey breasts boneless, had to throw in microwave for about 45 seconds to get gravy packet off then dumped everything in slow cooker as recipe states.   Low for 8 hours. Turkey came out moist and when I went to slice nicely it kinda crumbled on the ends so not sure how to make It more sliceable for a nicer desired look on the plate but no one said anything other then they were shocked to hear I didn’t bake the turkey!  This is our new tradition, no more roasters etc.   great recipe!

Imade this, it's the best ever. I hd a 9 lb breast, cooed it for 2 hours on high, then 2 hours on low. It was done, turned the drippings into a gravy by adding cornstarch and water. So amazing. It will be a recipe I'll make for many years.

Very good! I added 1.5 cups broth halfway through and wrapped it in bacon (though it probably wouldve been fine without it). It was very moist and tasty.

Great recipe.  What I don't understand and will never understand is how people can give this recipe a 5 star rating when they have not made the recipe at all.   They have changed the recipe so much that it's not even close to being the written recipe.   Amazing to me.....

Worked quite well--it was my first time making turkey and I'd say it was a success! I eyeballed the chicken stock,  so I probably ended up adding more like 1.5 cups, which was too much. The part of the turkey that was in the stock ended up being a little parboiled. It was all still pretty nice, though. Cooked on high for 3 hours then put it on low for 2.5 more.

NOT PERFECT   I wanted to try to slow cook a turkey breast
just for us ,,,mid turkey seasons. Not the fuss and mess just
turkey. This is close enough but diffferent also for me just
for a change. It's not perfect for me, but I did learn and will definitely slow cook again.
I have heard about bacon and turkey but I have never tried.
I didn't like it. I also did not like garlic ( garlic pepper) ) with 
turkey. I had frozen gravy from Christmas and planned to use that so did not add that as recipe said. 
I will definitely slow cook turkey breast mid season again.
Just using my own turkey methods. Thank you for getting me started. It's just all about personal tastes.

An easy and tasty recipe.  I used a half turkey breast and two thighs.  I layered  bacon over the top of the meat after seasoning.  Used turkey gravy in the bottom of the pot and some poured over the meat.  Slow cooked for about seven hours.  Was a bit overdone.  Next time will try less time.  Thank you for the recipe

The only thing I changed was to add a small can of mushrooms to the slow cooked about 6 hours into the 8 hours of cooking. It turned out to be the most moist turkey I have ever had.

The gravy didn't have a lot of flavor, but the turkey was extremely tender and juicy. I added double the liquid the recipe called for.

Good starting point recipe.  Four hours on a high setting is perfect. Moist and juicy. I'll probably make this again the next time I have to feed turkey to 2 or 3 people. Sure beats firing up the oven.

I don't like to modify recipes but in this case I had no choice, as I was not well prepared for the holiday.  The only thing I had was a can of turkey gravy. So here is what I did:  I put onion slices and celery sticks on the bottom of the slow cooker (using a slow cooker bag).  I seasoned the turkey with poultry seasoning, butter, and pepper, then I placed a few pieces of turkey bacon on the top and poured the gravy around the edges of the slow cooker.  After 6 hours the turkey was nice & tender (not falling off the bone).  I removed the bag & put the turkey on a platter, then poured the juices in in skillet to make the gravy.  I noticed that the area where you would normally stuff was not done completely so I transferred the turkey breast to a roaster pan a finished roasting it.

This was a great "starter"  recipe.  Who knew what you can do with a turkey breast?  Thank you for sharing!

I placed the turkey breast side down and layered the up side with uncooked bacon (about 5 strips).  I discarded the bacon after slow cooking.  the Turkey was so juicy and the drippings were perfect for gravy.

I have used this site for probably 6 years now and this is the first time I ever felt like I really needed to write a review.

This turkey was AMAZING!!! Soooo tender and juicy and full of flavor! I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. My entire family loved it. My teenage son said: "whoa, mom!"  (That's a good thing, haha!)

Since we have a small farmhouse and small oven we wanted to try the crockpot method to free up oven space for other sides.  This recipe is fast, easy, tastes great and is a real time saver.  We used Old Bay instead of pepper and sage because my husband and boys love Old Bay.  Thank you for the help.

First -- make sure the turkey you buy fits in your crock pot....!
Second -- I substituted savory beef gravy with fabulous results! I don't like turkey gravy, sorry.
Third -- I cooked it over night for work and the results are AMAZING! 
This is what we are having for Thanksgiving this year!

This is such a simple meal.  And you can personalize it by adding veggies.  Try it, you'll be glad you did!

We made this in addition to the big turkey and I must say it just didn't compare.  I did brine my whole turkey though and it was exceptional.
