A few things for the beginner:  it's better to boil the peppers(any kind will do) and all the flavorings for 30ish minutes, and then cook the meat in that broth.  Also, the water should cover the meat in the pan and it needs to be cooked until it is crumbly to the touch--this makes it easier and faster to shred by hand and eliminates any further meat preparation.  Depending on the meat I use my cook time varies between 4 hours to overnight.  I keep my corn husks in hot/boiling water for at least an hour--they need to be very soft.  Two VIP things to note: masa is very bland, there is no substitute for lard!  I use the leftover meat juice instead of broth for my masa, and still add lots of other spices.  When you are making tamales the masa will dry out; just add a little meat juice to keep the consistency.  It should spread like creamy peanut butter.  The corn husks should only measure 4-5 inches across; larger ones can be torn to size.  Place the meat filling along the edge and roll like a cigar. Also when steaming them, they need to be as close to standing upright as possible. Good reference recipe, thanks!

If you are going to take the time to make tamales, be sure to double or triple the recipe, the Tamales freeze well. You also want them to turn out perfectly. This is a good recipe but the instructions leave out a few important steps: (1.) One of the biggest mistakes is not mixing the masa dough long enough; this causes the tamales to fall apart. Mix the masa dough, with an ELECTRIC MIXER, until a small amount (1 tsp) floats in a cup of water. (2.) Position your corn husks with wide end toward you. Spread a thin layer of masa dough, completely covering the bottom 2/3 of the corn husks and place filling in a line down the center of the dough. (3.) You won't have to secure your Tamales with a toothpick or strip of corn husk, if folded properly. When folding, fold in one long side about 1/3 over dough and filling, fold in the other long side, overlapping the first (like folding a business letter). Fold down the top 1/3 and place in steamer standing upright, with the folded end down and open end up. Don’t over pack the pan, just tightly enough to keep Tamales in an upright position. If you don’t have a Tamale steamer you can use a deep pot with cover. Place a steamer basket in the bottom and stand your Tamales (open end up) in the basket, add water only to the bottom of the basket (you don’t want the Tamales sitting in water) cover, and steam. Check the water level during cooking, to make sure the pot doesn’t run dry.

The directions for preparing the Masa are right on. It's a lot easier than you would expect. To simplify the meat preparation I simply used boiled chicken with monterey jack or queso fresco cheese. The chile preparation is also easy. I added a bay leaf and oregano (remove the bay leaf and add one teaspoon of lemon juice before you blend it). Don't expect a great flavor. The chile is meant to be concentrated so it will taste horrible (very woody and grainy). But when it steams with the masa and meat the end product is wonderful. Placing the masa in the husks is a challenge, be patient. Although, I didn't want to, I had to use extra husk strips to tie the tamales. They kept seeping out in the steamer and would fall apart when I attempted to move them. The last thing you want is wet masa on the bottom of your steamer. I also found the steaming to take ALOT longer. In my case (I've made it 3 times) the steaming took between 2.5-3 hours. I guess it depends on the type of steamer you use. It helps to cover the bottom, sides, and eventually top (once the tamales are in) with extra corn husks. This keeps the tamales dry as you add extra water during the steaming process. It also helps with clean up later. I also put a coin at the bottom of the steamer (when the coin stops clanking, you know that your near the end of water and need to refill it).

Tamales are a Christmas tradition here and these are the real deal. I got raves on mine this year from our friends that we gave a dozen to. The chili's used here are very mild, so I use cascabel peppers. I always use 2 pork tenderloins to make mine. I poured all the chili sauce on the shredded meat, added about 1/2 tsp each of ground ancho chili powder and ground chipotle chili powder since it adds a smoked taste. Then let in stand for several hours before I made it into tamales. This is easier done the day ahead. I also add some ground ancho chili about 1/2 tsp. and 1/4 tsp ground chipotle chili to the masa. I use Maseca brand instant corn masa flour. I use almost all the broth and make the masa the consistency of thick cake frosting. I do have to make double the masa to use all my filling though. I don't measure the filling out, I just take some with my fingers and lay out a strip of filling down the center. It gives me 4 dozen tamales. We all agree these are even better the next day. They get spicier after reheating. I took some to work and everyone thought they came from the local (and favorite) tamale shop here. Took a bit of work, but was simple to do, and worth the time. Very easy to do, you just need a little time. If you are going to the trouble and effort you may as well make lots of tamales... I've done these with the lard and with crisco, the lard is better, so don't substitute. Delicioso! Muy Bueno!

Good recipe!  I used canola oil rather than lard and instead of using a can of beef broth, I used broth from cooking the pork roast.  I also used hot chili peppers to spice it up a little.  They turned out great!

I just had to comment on this one because I am mexican and have been making (helping make) tamales since I was about 5 yrs old. You'd be surprised how much a 5 yr old kid can do! We never used gloves to clean the chiles, just because it is so much faster when you don't. Of course, you are taking a huge risk with your eyes, but we all do it that way even still. We always boil onions and other spices with the chiles while they cook and add the onions to the blender too. We use the leftover meat liquid for the masa and we add a little baking powder and salt. We also add chile sauce to the masa! Big improvment on flavor if you do. Our test for if the tamales were done has always been to remove one (a bigger one, since they are less likely to be done) and try to pull the husk off. If it comes off clean, they're done.  And sour cream? That's...different. I'm not sure what it does. We've made beef, pork, chicken, chicken and cheese, chile and cheese and sweet tamales in my lifetime. For the sweet tamales, we mix raisins in the masa and the filling is a cream cheese mixture. Pretty yummy! :)
As for this recipe, I haven't done it, but i rated it anyway because it is PRETTY close to how we do it...and they would come out okay.

Excellent!  I had a hard time spreading the masa on the husks.  I ended up using a moist corn husk to flatten/spread out the masa evenly. The review by Trptgoddess1 on 2/2004 was great and the mention by another review of using MASECA brand masa mix is great.  I also added more chicken bullion powder to my masa.  Try this...If you want to sample the flavor before making all of the tamales, just put a spoonful on a saucer and microwave for about 1 minute or so.  It kind of makes a tamale cookie!

I had tried other recipes and had almost given up.This recipe is fool proof I've made it many times since running across it and it works every time.Depending on if I'm making beef or chicken,I use chicken or beef powdered bullion for the dough,I also mix dried parsley,onion powder and garlic powder, and a touch of cumin  -oh and some powdered ancho pepper.I use a product called Maseca there are two types I do not recommend using the one that lists making tortillas and a bunch of other things the type I use comes in a light peach coloured bag and says Maseca for delicious tamales.For some reason using the other stuff was disasterous for me and if I'm putting hours of labour into a recipe disaster is not an option! : )
My favourite way to make these is with cubed grilled chicken or steak, onions and three types of cheese and just a little bit of VERY mild green chiles'. Of course they're pretty good anyway you make them.I even started selling them to friends that kept bugging me to make them.Thank you so much Saddiecat for a delicious recipe and quite possibly a lucrative business!

This recipe doesn't say what to do with the onion that cooked with the meat, or the cooking liquid. Do you discard both? When you strain the chile mixture after blending, what part are you throwing away? Why use a can of beef broth when you could use the cooking liquid? I have never made tamales before and I found the recipe instructions confusing.

This is a good recipe...you just need to add your own touches. For the masa..you can go to your Hispanic Mkt and buy the Masa (dough) already prepared .  All you have to do is add salt to taste,some chicken broth to make it plyible.(easy to apply to the corn husk) and add some shortening (lard or crisco) taste as you go.  It just takes practice.

My husband is from New Mexico, and this is the type of food he is used to eating.I am from the deep South and had never made tamales before.I made these for dinner , and he absolutely loved them!Not too spicy for my tastes, not too bland for his.Even my super picky 2 year old liked them.I do reccomend using a little bit more broth, as they came out somewhat dry, but on a second try using more broth, they came out perfectly!I used ground beef instead, mixed it and the onion with the strained mixture using a blender (threw out the large chunks of chile).I will definitely make these again!Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe and it was my first time making tamales - EVER. I did it by myself and they came out totally awesome!! I want to thank everyone for adding their tips as they helped so much. I doubled the recipe and it made 25 good-sized tamales and they went quickly. The best suggestions were about 1)adding oregano and cumin to the broth that the meat cooked in 2)adding cumin to the masa dough 3) adding the red sauce to the masa dough 4) adding more salt to the meat, sauce, and dough 5) whipping the lard 5 minutes until light and fluffy before adding broth and masa mixture 6) using only room temp or cold ingredients so the lard does not melt. I also added a small can of chipotle peppers to the red sauce when I blended it. The sauce tasted strong but after steaming, the tamales mellowed and boy were they good! That strong chipotle taste cooks out. My suggestion for anyone wanting to make these is to research all tips first, and double or triple the recipe. Thank you!! I will be making these for years to come!!

I haven't made this recipe, but I know how to make Mexican tamales. So here are two things I want to share. A lot of people will reserve some of the stock inwhich the meat was cooked in, and use it as the liquid for forming the dough, because it adds a great flavor. However, you might want to spice up the broth a little bit more than with  just  onion and garlic. 
The other tip, is that longer you knead the tamale dough, the better it will be when it's fully cooked.

My husband is from Mexico and his sister gave me some pointers on making tamales. I now have my own way in combination with hers. She lives in Chicago where you can find fresh masa in which it is already wet and you just add salt, broth, melted lard, and some baking powder. I don't have that priveledge. So I use the masa mix and I like to beat the lard with a little of the broth and salt till its light and whipped before adding the masa and the additional broth. This brings in a little more lightness to the masa. Also make sure to salt the masa well, I taste mine wet, but have also done the microwave test. It is not necessary to tie off the tamales or stand them up. Instead, try to put a thin layer of masa over the entire husk and only put a strip of filling down the middle, fold in one side, bottom up then the other side, and pinch the open end shut. If you season your masa properly then you will enjoy all the extra left on the husk. Tamales are time sonsuming because of their prep time, they do not take that long to cook. It typically takes 1 to 1 1/2 hours. To check them, c if the husk will pull away from the masa clean, if it is still sticking, let them cook a little longer. Remember that the masa will still look wet and jelly like and will set as they cool. I think they are better as leftovers. Freeze your leftovers in a baggie. For a really quick cook time, try them in your microwave steamer, takes about 8- 10 min. Just make sure the waters hot before you put them in.

Good basic recipe, however it leaves out one crucial ingredient.  Cumin.  Cumin is almost as important to the flavor as the chiles are.

I cannot believe that this is the first time I've made tamales, and they're the BEST I've ever had in my entire life! And that's saying a lot, since I grew up in the Southwest with a Hispanic father, and always had the opportunity to buy authentic tamales from the ladies that go door-to-door. I've always been yearning for that perfect tamale, though--most times, I had ones that were too bland, too dry, too salty, too spicy, etc. But the masa dough in this recipe is the secret to a tasty tamale. I did take a major shortcut with the meat--I used a 5-lb roast, sprinkled it with salt, chile powder, cayenne, garlic powder, cumin seeds, and crushed red pepper, put it in the slow cooker with chicken broth and crushed garlic cloves, and cooked it on low, overnight til the meat shredded easily. I then adjusted the spicyness. I also added the broth from the meat to the masa dough, and added some of the aforementioned spices for more flavor and color. I had to double the recipe for dough since I cooked extra meat, and I still have meat left over to make tacos or burritos later. I am so glad I can make tamales that really hit the spot!

Do try this recipe!!! My experience with this recipe was excellent. However, I did wavier the pork loin only because I had some leftover brisket I was needing to use. I chopped up the brisket and heated it up with enchilada sauce just to moisten, not loaded with sauce. Which worked out perfectly all the way around. But do try it with the pork loin. My suggestions to this recipe is that, the "chili" part was a little off. It really tasted like a spiced water with salt. If that makes since. I had to call my hispanic friend who is a whiz making tamales and ask her what was wrong with that part. She told me how I could easily spice up the sauce, with cumin, chili powder, extra water and little bit of enchilada sauce and proceed to cook longer for flavor. I can't tell you the extract measurements because it was a through in. And I hugged her through the phone it was excellent addition to the tamales. The tamales themselves, needed just a bit more broth then required because it was rather pasty as I was working with it. Do keep an extra can of broth on hand just to add a little at a time for a smooth texture when it starts to dry out. And the hardest part was just getting the tieing part down for the tamales. However, totally well worth the time. It is time consuming but however, the finished result was nothing more then awesome. I will be making this again. Because my family felt like they died and gone to heaven, thank you.

I made these last night, turned out excellent.  Some pointers that might help if you haven't made before is to look at the most helpful reviews and also go into "You Tube", and then put in 'making tamales'.  That video with the dressed up skeltons in the background  by Jose Chavez was so helpful on how to wrap and place in the pot as well as how to check for doneness.  Also this recipe seemed complicated to me, and after I watched the video on You Tube on how to prepare the meat, it helped so much.  The video was so good and 'easy'.  If you need pointers..watch the video on You tube.

I applaud this recipe but boy is it way off. Look, never, ever use Maseca for anythig. Get tortilla masa from your local Mexican bodega or market. Also, the mixing is crucial. Use baking powder and baking soda. For the meat, a flank steak is best since it shreds easier. The key is the sauce. And that's my maternal grandmother's recipe from Cuernavaca, Morelos. And you can't have it. One tip: unless you have vegetarian guests, use Lard. And not that trans stuff like REX. Go to a good butcher and get the natural stuff. It might look gross but the taste is worth it.

I am usually not one to write reviews. But me and my family make tamales every year. 30 some dozen...

The red chile sauce... California and new mexico chile pods, garlic, cummings, salt and pepper. 

We pour hot boiling water over the clean and seeded pods and let sit till plumped.  Add pods 4 at a time to a blender, 2 garlic cloves, salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp cummings seeds. Use some water from the chile pods so it will blend. Do this about 4 times. Put threw a sive. Warm the sauce in a pot and bring to simmer. Don't boil. Chile sauce becomes hotter (taste) as you cook it. you may add some ground chile powder if you want. Cool sauce and add to meat.

Also add a little sauce to your masa for extra flavor, along with juice from the meat. Also salt your masa. When steaming them you will lose the salt in them.  Never add sour cream to the masa. Work your masa (blend) very good, this can take up to 20 minutes by hand. Your tamales will come out fluffier.

For starters, this is a fabulous recipe, the best I have ever had.  These are the changes I made:
I slightly melted the lard in the microwave for easier mixing instead of fluffing it with the beater, it worked out very well.  I also cooked a boston butte pork roast instead of loin, and I cooked it in the crock pot.  I added a bit more salt, a tablespoon of cumin and chili powder to the meat mix after tasting it and it came out perfect.  The masa was very moist and tasty, perfect salt to masa ratio on the recipe.  Since I quadrupled the recipe, it took me all day to cook them, but I used the masa recipe to make some bean and jalapeno tamales, too.  My two teenage boys couldn't get enough of them, gobbled them up as they were coming out of the pot.  It was a very lost cost recipe compared to the amount of meals I got out of it, freezing recommended if holding longer than 4 days.  I will try this with chicken next time, and even beef when the price of beef goes down a little.  Try the masa recipe with a chunk of mozzarella cheese stick and a slice of pickled jalapeno instead of meat, very good!  I cut the cheese stick down the middle to make it more narrow, and layed it in the middle of the masa, then put a strip of jalapeno next to it.  Wow, these are very tasty and economical, too.

Although I made some minor modifications, this was a great first experience making tamales.  The meat was nicely spiced but not hot--my picky, heat-wimp 9-year old loved them as did everyone else.  To the 1.25# pork loin, I added 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 (7oz) can of diced chiles, 2 garlic cloves pressed, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chile powder, 3 shakes of cayenne pepper and a Tbsp or more of Cholula Hot Sauce.  Note that this is a toned down version of Charley's Mexican Meat recipe (aka "Atomic Meat") but same ingredients.  I ended up making a double batch of dough since I was also making some tamales without meat.  Into the meatless ones, I combined diced chiles (rest of can), grated sharp cheddar and same spices in meat but slightly less since there was less volume.  I used 1/4 cup of grease from sausage made this morning + vegetable shortening instead of lard (1/3 cup for each cup of masa).  I used juices from cooked meat instead of broth and omitted the sour cream.  The corn was moist and the fillings were flavorful.  My entire family was impressed and we had fun making them.  Toughest part was making sure the steamer water didn't boil away.  Use a coin in the bottom that rattles when the water boils (stops when water is gone).  I served with 505 Green Chili warmed.  Yum!  LOVED IT!!!

I think is super! I made some changes based on what I had at home. I made bbq pulled pork a couple days ago and used the leftovers also added chiptole powder and used can of green chilies and a can of diced toms (other tamales I've made had roasted tomatoes). Also I used chicken broth instead of beef. Added a little mexican oregano and thyme. The filing was a a little dry so I added more broth. From what I ve been told before it should resemeble a little thincker than cake batter. Also was out of corn husks and HATE rolling them. Found a super great tip....I used COFFEE FILTERS. Asthetically not authentic, but super easya dn still tastes the same.

I have never made tamales before but was interested in trying. This is a time-consuming process for sure! The best way to do this is make the meat a day in advance. Work to perfect the masa by watching YouTube and reading other recipes. This recipe's masa was way too dry and I had a hard time figuring out how to get a little pinch of it to float in water--as some YouTube pros suggested--to test for the right consistency.  The videos about masa show it being about the consistency of Cream of Wheat. With some insistence from my husband that we keep trying, we worked at it and finally came up with some masa that didn't sink as heavily as the first batch.   We cooked the tamales in our pressure cooker for about 45 minutes. Then let them sit in the closed pressure cooker while we went for a walk. They really need some time to cook, apparently. This combination of cooking and letting them sit ended up being perfect.   These tamales were really divine. Just as good as the ones a Mexican family used to sell door to door when I lived in Utah. Try it. But definitely be prepared for a lengthy process. Invite friends over. Play some mariachi music. Drink some Mexican beer. Worth it. But definitely an experience you want to share with others willing to get their hands dirty. The community aspect of the recipe is part of the magic of tamales.   Try it--but know what you're in for. I do think it's worth it.

This recipe is fabulous- used whole pork sirloins for the meat (far less fatty, and less expensive, too!), and it came out great! Had some extra masa dough left over- so stuffed a few with shredded cheddar cheese tossed with a little of the sauce- added an extra Yum Factor- every once in a while, one of us would get a cheese one. Oh, and a little side note- these things freeze beautifully, as does the sauce- discovered that if you thaw them in the fridge, they reheat in the microwave or steamer equally well, and are as good or better than the first time around! Thanks for the great recipe!

The sour cream should probably not be in the item list under tamale dough.  It makes it look like the sour cream goes into the dough.  It does not.  I made that mistake.  ;(

This is so easy!  Quick changes: 1) I cooked meat in the croc pot for almost two days with a whole onion, four cloves, cumin, and cajun seasoning (like a seasoned salt), covered with water.  It made the meat super tender. 2) I mixed almost two cups of the "marinade" from the meat (croc pot) with the chile mixture in the blender with onion powder and garlic salt. Very good. 3) I used a LOT of juice left over from meat for the masa mixture.  I had to use an extra cup of beef boulloin.  5) I doubled the masa mixture and used 3lbs of pork. 4) I mixed all the chile sauce that I made with the pork and put INTO husks/tamales instead of leaving some for on top.  I think this was much better this way... less dry. 5) I put fat amounts of masa mixture and lots of meat mixture in each husk.  My tamales were chunky! :-) 6) I steamed in a regular pot, layed flat, for 30 min.  I had made the chile sauce and meat in one day.  The next day I started the masa and assembly at three and we ate dinner by 5:30.  These are easy easy easy!  Will definitely make again.  Thank you so much for this recipe! The best one I've found on allrecipes! :-)

I've learned to use pork shoulder and put it in a crockpot at bedtime so in the morning it's easy to shredd the meat and go.  No waiting for the meat to cook.

I'm giving this four stars because as written, I think the masa would be really dry. I followed many other suggestions and used more cooking liquid from the meat to keep the masa the right temp. I steamed mine for about 2.5 hours. I also added chili powder and cumin to chile sause, and chili powder to masa dough. These tamales were good but needed more spice for my husband.

We got a spackle spreader from the hardware store, a nice metal one and use that for spreading the mesa. We double the chili pods and water, to the final sauce we add a teaspoon or more of high quality chocolate to deepen the flavors and mellow out the hotness if needed.  I made several hundred for a benefit. I buy a big pork shoulder, boil it up, shred it and mix it with some sauce and toss extra into the freezer so I can make the mesa, defrost the extras and have tamales in no time at all.  This IS the recipe to beat, we love it.

I just want to say thanks for taking the time to post this, because I really REALLY liked these! I've only had tamales once before (restaurant), and I wondered why I'd waited so long! So, I made a small batch at home with this recipe, but I have to admit- I modified it a bit! Like many, I'm sure! I added 1 T cumin to the batter, and I shredded the meat from some bbq spare ribs that were tender, juicy and lots of spices and flavor. I used that for the filling, and they turned out pretty well for my first time. I think what I've learned is that the maza has to be sloppy wet when you put it into the husks-- I didn't get the batter that wet, and I should have. Next time... and next time I'll experiment with some other fillings. I'd love to hear if anyone else has stuffed these with fillings that wowed their family and friends... I'd love to share the recipe with you, and I'll post it on my blog.

These turned out great!  Not a lot of actual work just a lot of time waiting for things to be done so if you've got a whole day free, I'd say go for it!   I used a beef roast and roasted with a can of vegetable broth, onion, and a few cloves of garlic.  I put all the juices, onion, and garlic from the roasting pan in a blender and liquified it, adding about a cup of water.  I used that liquid for my dough instead of a can of beef broth.    I don't have a steamer big enough so I used a metal colander in a big pot.  Covered with a couple kitchen towels and then a lid.  Worked just fine.

I have made tamales for years, and this is a good recipe.  I just wanted to say that IF you love tamales but can't eat them due to the fattening nature of the ingredients, there is a very good substitute. You can use water (yes, water) instead of lard. And if you need less meat you can use the same spices in some blended blackeyed peas for the filling. Now I know this is not the SAME, but it IS quite good and would be a great way to once again have tamales even though your doctor has said 'NO.'

Changed a couple of things based on other reviewers comments: 1. Cooked the pork with more garlic and added cumin seeds and ground oregano. Used chicken broth instead of water. 2. Used the cooled and strained broth from cooking the pork to make the masa. Used about 4 cups to make the consistency right. I've made tamales before (mind you from another recipe online because I'm not Mexican at all) and they turned out ok. My fiance is Mexican and whenever I try to make any Mexican dish, he starts to cringe because I simply had no exposure to it. So I attempted this recipe with the above modifications and got rave reviews from my whole family including him!!! And as another reviewer says, it is on the maseca bag for the tamale masa. It helps because you don't have to carry the recipe around with you because it's already going to be in the grocery cart. DEFINITELY will make again (possibly make a bunch and freeze to prepare for my wedding).

this is a great recipe i made my first batch following the recipe to the T. My second batch I made using my mom's tips. I quadrudpled the recipe, subbing one cup of Maseca with flour. I didn't use lard I used oil and added about half a cup of the chili sauce to the masa. This makes the masa super fluffy and extra tasty. I make my tamales the traditional mexican way. I spread the masa then fold in one side bring up the middle and finishing rolling (imagine the husk as a triangle with the point being the "middle" part). It saves time from having to cut strips to tie the tamales.

I am from New Mexico and this is almost what me and my family have done for years.  The only changes I would make is: The chile should taste good enough to eat on its own.  When you make chile, I would add garlic and salt to taste.  I also let the meat and chile marinate for at least 2 days.  Also you should put the meat in crock-pot with water filled all the way to the top and cook until the meat falls apart, at least 6-8 hours depending on the size.  Save the juice that is from the crock-pot to use to make the dough.  You may also need more broth so you can make the dough to a really think pudding, or really creamy peanut butter.  It needs to spread really nice.  To cook, I would just lay the tamales on top of each other on top of in inverted aluminum pan with a few holes poked in it on and then place a glass plate on top of that and add water up to the plate, then start stacking the tamales. Good luck and happy cooking!!!!!

I remember my grandma making tamales from scratch, I always loved to help her and I learned the process. The recipes themselves are not that complicated, it's the time and work it takes what makes it tedious. The original dough is made out of dry corn kernels, boiled in an alkaline water solution made with "lime", no, no the kind of lime you squeeze, construction lime, you know, the white powder they use to make plaster and stuff, believe it or not. The result is "nixtamal". Once the corn is tender is whashed, some people peels the skins off the kernels, then is put through a grinder and the result is the "masa". Most of us don't have the time, patience or equipment to do it this way. What I do is buy the "maseca para tamales", it's coarser than the one for tortillas.
Some tips for the best masa you can achieve is to use real lard, the one they scrape off the pig's skin, not the processed lard, it's hard to find but it's worth it, look for a Hispanic meat market, they usually have it. Always whip the lard until fluffy before incorporating to the dough. Always use the stock you have left from boiling the meat for your filling, it will taste way better than store-bought stock. Mix mix mix, by hand, use the cold water method to make sure your dough is ready. The basic rule for 1 kg of maseca is 1/2 kg of lard, 1 tablespoon baking powder or sodium bicarbonate (AKA baking soda) and 1-1/2 - 2 cups stock, +- as needed. Shot me an email if you need filling tips or recipes..

Very good, but I made some changes. I used Crisco instead of Lard and for the Masa dough, I added 1 teaspoon of Chili Powder and 1 teaspoon of Cumin powder. Really made it 'zing'!

Excellent recipe but I suggest steaming for three hours. The masa should pull away from the hojas(corn husks) when done. I wrap each folded tamale in a large sheet of "sandwich paper" (Smart & Final), similar to parchment but thinner and it keeps the hojas (corn husks) from opening as you stack them in the steamer. I make 50 at a time so it's better if you have a helper.

I made the recipe yesterday. I did tinker a bit,I used a standard 14.5 oz can of beef broth in the Masa and used Maseca ( instant corn flour). I tested it on my wife's caregiver this morning. Patricia is a Hispanic woman from Oxaca, Mexico. Married with four children and a growing adult husband. I gave her a tamal and after one taste, she ate it all. Her comments; Great flavor, could be a bit hotter. Also, a hint on rolling. Soak the husks over night. Trim the overlong tails just a bit. Use the smooth side to spread the masa. Lay flat,spread masa. fold the left side over, fold the tail up toward the center and fold the right side over. No need to tie.

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes as well.  I added 3 T cumin to the meat, used the broth from the meat in the masa and used a large can (27 oz) of Hatch chilies instead of the dried chili pods.  I lived for thirty years close to the Mexican border and these were every bit as good.  Thanks for the great recipe.  We doubled it and it made 42 generous tamales.

The key was reading the notes and following the suggestions... following the experience of the "experts" I found I could make delicious tamales the FIRST time!!!  I just need to practice the wrapping technique  ;-)   Thanks to everyone who helped make this recipe super special!!

This was my first time making Tamales and my husband said they were some of the best he has eaten! Him being from South Texas I had a lot to live up to. It was really simple actually. Living in DC we have a few supermercados where it was easy to find husks and MESECA brand masa. I did use a 14oz can of broth to make it more moist and had to steam them for 90 minutes. Wonderful!

I just made tamales!!  I messed around with the filling a bit and boiled the pork in water and chile powder as Rick Bayless suggests.  But the rest of the recipe I followed exactly and they were awesome!  Very tender, well cooked.  I was worried about the "unwrapping", but they held together beautifully.  Made me feel like I'd really done something!  Thanks for hanging out in the grocery store and asking all the questions for us!

First time tamale maker here...so like many other reviewers, I used this as a jumping off place and followed my instinct on flavors. I used 5 lbs pork shoulder, cooked it in the Crockpot overnight with 1/2 large onion, 5 cloves garlic, 1 tsp crushed oregano, and 5 New Mexico dried chiles. I used some of the cooked chiles and added some extra reconstituted ones for more flavor in the meat sauce. I also thought it was bland so used 2 (ea) canned chipotle chiles in adobo for some heat - that absolutely made the sauce. Saved the meat broth - strained it and used it in the masa. 
I wholeheartedly give due praise to all of the abuelitas out there who stand on their feet all day making tamales. I just  finished steaming the 4th batch and I am WIPED OUT! Whew! Totally worth it though as my husband tells me these would meet his abuelita's standards. Thanks!

This was a wonderful recipe, and very close to authentic.  I am 3rd generation Mexican, and have been looking for that perfect homecooked recipe.  I did slowcook the pork overnight on low and added some ground cumin and adobo, with a little extra garlic.  Use the broth for the masa and use your hands it is much easier.  I also added cumin, garlic salt, and adobo in the masa for a little more flavor.  As all tamales it is time consuming, but unbelievabley yummy.  Thanks so much for helping me recreate a favorite memory.  They were a hit!

I like this recipe very much. In answer to Pat's question, I use parchment paper instead of corn husks and just fold them up. I've done it both ways and actually prefer the paper.

The good: despite a few substitutions this recipe held up (fresh serrano and jalapeno peppers instead of dried, chicken instead of pork, shortening instead of lard, and the addition of cumin).

The bad: Don't listen to the reviewer who said coffee filters work as wrappers. I did (thinking that I could get rid of a huge coffee filter surplus) and suffered for it. Using coffee filters is a TERRIBLE idea!! Here are the problems that I had:
1. The filters are not as waterproof as corn husks, so when you steam the tamales the fat in them will liquefy and leak out. When the water in my steamer cooled there was 1/2 inch of fat on top of the water for a double batch of tamales. This also means that the surface of the tamales will feel greasy and grease will get all over your steamer.
2. The coffee filters bond to the masa so when you want to eat them you end up peeling off the outer layer of masa. If you try to avoid this by removing the wrapping while tamales are cold it is impossible to remove without leaving paper on the tamale.
3. Because the coffee filters bond to the masa the normal test of doneness (seeing if the masa is still sticking) is useless. This means that you need to take a tamale out and actually eat it to figure out if it is done or not.

Despite the fact that my tamales are probably now low fat they are still pretty tasty. They were better after sitting overnight because the flavors melded together.

When making tamales, the corn husks need to be in HOT WATER!  And you need to use the SMOOTH side of the husks.  Prevents dough sticking to husks when cooked.

Really good.  They tasted just like the ones I order in Mexican restaurants.  I did use Crisco instead of lard. This was a suggestion from a collegue who comes from a Mexican family.

I like this recipe. I do change the preparation of the meat.  I cook it in the oven. I prefer the roasted pork to the boiled.  If there is still cooking liquid in the pan after the meat is done, I use it in the Mesa or I reduce it down and add it back to the meat. I also prop my tamales up so that they are standing when steaming.  I simply lay my steam basket on it's side and stack the basket until it is full.  If there isn't enough tamales to fill the basket (which I always make extra) you could fill the empty space with left over corn husks or something to keep your tamales from falling flat. If my tamales are not sitting up, the filling tends to flow out of the husk. I would not be afraid to season my pork with extra seasoning....I like my tamales with a lot of flavor. I also keep the pepper sauce on the side, not everyone likes it in the meat at my house.

Living in New Mexico it's easy to go just about anywhere and find some Tamales. The only suggestion I have is for the MASA, instead of using water to make it use the broth from the meat you cook. It wall add more flavor to it. And out here we just use HATCH red or green chili.

These turned out great! I was a little anxious, but the Mexicans that work with my boyfriend said they were spot on. Like many of the others, I added ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder, and cumin. It still was not quite spicy enough for my taste, so I will probably use spicier peppers the next time. I cooked a pork tenderloin overnight in a crock pot on low heat, which turned out to be perfect. I bought a tamale steamer and they were done after about an hour and 15 minutes. My only complaint is that I don't care for using lard. I will probably substitute it the next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for Christmas and they were PERFECT!!! My first time ever making tamales and they were so yummy. Only thing I changed was that I used beef instead of pork. I also used a slow cooker for the meat. They were delicious and even my SUPER picky big brother loved them and took some home with him. One time saving tip: If your neighborhood has a hispanic grocery market, see if they have prepared Masa for tamales. That way you don't have to prepare the dough yourself. It's ready to go. Thank you sooo so very much for this recipe. I've saved it and will use it MANY times in the future. It's fool proof :)

This was incredible!  It is very time consuming however, so don't plan to whip it together an hour before dinner.  Read the other reviews to get ideas and then add your own touches for a simply incredible experience.

This was a great starter recipe, but I also needed some guidance from another website that had step by step instructions with pictures.  One thing I'm learning: you almost have to "overseason" the meat and cooking liquid, because masa has absolutely no flavor.

Turned out great but a lot of work.  Also the spice is really mellowed so don't be to worried.  Used medium salsa and it was like it wasn't even mild.  MArie did not buy the stuff for the spice but bought salsa instead.  Get help to make and something to tie the tamales before steaming or they will open up.

Thank you I have been searching for the recipe for the masa for tamales on the internet. I used to make them to sell. But it has been a while and couldn't remember if I used 1/3c of lard or 2/3. By the way I always tripled the amount of salt in the masa. All of my customers said it was better that way.

WOW - I had always thought tamales were hard to make and it hadn't even crossed my mind to attempt it til I saw this recipe and from start to finish, only took an hour and a half (including cooking time), because we didn't cook any meat. I used vegetable shortening, vegetable broth and as the filling, black beans with el pato sauce, cumin, garlic salt & onion powder simmered on the stove for 5 mins, as well as a julienne slice of monterey jack. I also mixed a few tablespoons of the el pato into the dough for flavor, which didn't change the color much. As expected without meat, they were a TAD on the dry side but still great, especially with some el pato sauce on the side. I did need to use about 1/4 c. more broth than the recipe called for. I steamed these in a pot with rack for 1 hour and they were definitely done after that hour, but only did 12 or so at a time. They kept their shape when unrolled, and looked great! This made about 24 tamales for me. OH one more thing, don't even bother using a spoon to spread the dough on the husk, it's MUCH easier just using your fingers to press it down, the dough has lots of fat so it doesn't stick to your hands. THANKS for the recipe!

Good, but why add beef broth? You've got an oniony, porky pan full of broth! Especially nice if you perk up the braising liquid with a carrot, celery and spices like a few peppercorns, cumin seeds and a couple cloves; much better balanced flavor. Also love Reyna's suggestion to use the the chile sauce in the dough:  So that's how my childhood neighbors made their fabulous dough!  Brilliant and so sensible.

Alright...  of course I tweaked this a little bit.  I made it with chicken breasts.  I had 3 huge chicken breasts so I had enough for another batch today.  So last night I made them pretty much like the recipe said.  I only added a little lime juice to the masa.  We liked them, but thought they could be better.  So today, we added some cumin and 1/2 a can of red and 1/2 a can of green enchiladas sauce.  And to the masa I added a little garlic salt.  They were perfect! My husband ate about 10 of them and each of my (EXTREMELY) picky kids ate 3 each! I served them w/ Mexican Rice II.  WE will be making these often.  Now my mom wants me to teach her how to make them!

This recipe is very authentic tasting. The technique is very easy but time consuming. My 13 year old had a lot of fun helping to make them. 
I give this recipe four stars instead of five because I think the overall flavor was too bland. Maybe more spices (cumin, chipotle) with more onion and more garlic would help. 
I deleted the sauce step and cooked the chili pods with the meat(garlic and onion) in the crock pot until the meat fell apart. I then made my sauce from everything that was sitting in the bottom of the crock pot,(onion, garlic, chili pods, and meat juice).
I had to add quite a bit more broth to the masa dough to make it more spreadable and workable to work with it.

I made this recipe today and first of all, going to take longer than 35 minutes to prepare this.  Second, two hours is not long enough to cook the meat to shred.  There are many too many things to go over that did not work out.  I would not recommend using this recipe for tamales.  Go to a more involved one and plan on spending a few hours to accomplish your goal.  It will be worth it in the long run.

Im only giving this 4 stars because I had to make a lot of changes.  As written it is very bland and heavy.  The first batch I made the masa turned out very plain and heavy too.  I made another batch the next day and I made many changes based on others input.  I cooked pork shoulder with an onion and a whole head of garlic, separated.  I used the pork broth to mix with the masa.  To the chili sauce I added an onion and 6 cloves of garlic and some chili powder and cumin and lots of salt, blended it all up and mixed half with the meat and half with the masa.  I also added sliced pickled jalapenos to the meat mix.  I also like to add 1 black olive and a thin slice of potato to each tamale after I put the meat filling on the masa.  My 2nd batch turned out so well. I also made some with a strip of green chile and cheese, they were yummy too.   Im so glad I finally decided to make some tamales on my own.  I cant wait to experiment with other fillings.

This recipe was very easy to follow.  I replaced plain water with the broth made by boiling the pork meat (cooked onion and all) when making my chili mixture and added extra dried chile pods to thicken the sauce so there was no need to strain.  This added extra flavor to the meat when mixed in together.  My family just loved it!

I made these with beef instead of pork.  They are GREAT!!!  The leftovers freeze well and they reheat easily in the microwave.  I always keep some in the freezer now for a quick, delicious dinner.

These were the first tamales I ever made! They turned out very nice and very mild spice wise. My family reallyenjoyed them even the 3 year old. You will need extra help for this batch, it was work! I will make this again.

I used the reduced liquid from cooking my pork instead of the beef broth.  I thought I'd failed this miserably because after the steam time they were mushy. I opened some up and chopped and "cooked" them in a fry pan and called it tamale hash.  Tasty but not too visual.   I tossed the rest  in the fridge to deal with later.  Next day I took them out to play with and they were perfect.  Think maybe I just had too much water in the steamer.

A little hard to follow the directions... I had to "google" for some clarifications on how to fold the tamale.   The flavor was great but the masa ended up too dry.  I reccomend adding at least 1/4 cup + or more to the dough.  As another reviewer said, it should spread like peanut butter.  This recipe as is did not. I added a lot more broth as suggested and it was still a bit dry.   I cooked the meat in a slow cooker on HIGH for 4 hours then on low 2 hours with chicken broth, garlic, onion, salt and pepper. The meat came out amazing.  I used the juice from this for the masa dough.   I only needed to steam them for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  In general, Very good!

Instead of drizzling the left-over sauce over the tamales, I mixed some into the dough(just enough to tint the masa red). I mixed it in real well and then prepared the tamales into the corn husks as directed. It gave the masa a good hint of flavor. It is good to double or triple this recipie and serve these for a party, pot luck, or freeze them for up to 6 months. They are a labor of love so if you make them, make a lot. 
I thought it would save time to buy the masa prepared but that was a big mistake the first time, never again. This recipie for the masa was great. I did have a lot of the filling left over but I just used the left over meat mixture throughout the week for tacos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.

I adore this tamale recipe. Each time I make it it is such a hit! I brought some to school and one of my teachers (who was married to a Hispanic and spent years among Mexican and Cuban cultures)said they were the best she has had, and many of my Mexican friends (whose parents often don't speak English, so I know their food is authentic!) said these are just as good as their mothers make. Point is, THEY ARE GREAT!

I just made these for my husband's birthday dinner tonight. Everyone loved it! I read some reviews before putting the recipe together and used some of the suggestions posted. I simmered the onions, garlic, and chilis with cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper for about 20 minutes. Then I put the meat in along with a can of beef broth. I made the masa with the broth from the meat. Both the masa and the filling was delicious! I will be making this again!

My recipe is similar with these added flavor boosters:  I use the broth from cooking the meat instead of beef bouillon.  I also use a pork shoulder which renders more natural "lard" to use as well.

This was my first attempt at tamales, and I think it was very successful. I doubled the recipe and I think I had 36 small tamales. Next time I would triple it because I kept worrying about running out. I added two medium potatoes to the mix because my family does, and I would definitely add them next time. I was sort of bummed to waste all that pork broth, next time I would probably just use it in place of the beef broth. I added a tomato to the boiled chiles, and pan fried three of the chiles with probably 4 chiles japones. Next time I would probably add more tomato to my mix just because I thought the tamales needed a brighter flavor. Definitely steam the tamales in an upright position with the open side up. Mine were small and took about 1 hr 20 mins. I topped the tamales with some sour cream I mixed with some chile sauce, and some homemade red salsa and those fresh flavors brought the tamales to life. DELICIOUS!

I am so sorry to give this a bad review, I adore tamales and have been looking for a recipe for years but this was extremely confusing and had huge gaps in the process. Did she mean a pressure cooker at the end? What happened to the onion? Why are we using separate broth? It's over my "cooking" head.

Sounds delicious! I've made tamales plenty of times but never on such a small scale! When we make tamales we mix up to thirty pounds of masa, we use spicy chicken, pork meat and beans with jalapeno and cream cheese! We end up with lots of tamales! Lol! Thanks to SADDIECAT, I'll be able to make a bit when I get the craving! :)

I just made tamales for the first time a few days ago with this recipe. They were delicious. I doubled the recipe and used rendered fat instead of lard and used 1/2 C of it instead of 2/3C called for.  I used 2 cups warm chicken broth intstead of the 10.5 oz can. Half of the masa made cheese and jalapeno tamales and the other half chicken. The BP makes the dough light and fluffier. Be sure to not pack the rolled tamales too tight in the steaming pot so they have room to expand. I had two pots steaming and the one that was tightly packed turned out a little chewy but the cheese ones that were loosely packed before steamed were devine! Each recipe yeilded only 12 but I made each tamale pretty fat. Worth the time and effort.

I have heard for years how hard tamales are to make so I have never tried.  I made this recipe last week and they were amazing.  Very time consuming but very easy to make and put together.  I added my own spices to the meat and the masa but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.  Thank you!!

Was looking through my recipe box and realized I didn't rate this. These are excellent tamales! They are time consuming and fussy to work with but they are wellllllllll worth the effort. I love the flavor of the masa I did add some ground chipotle to it just because. I still have 5 of these in the freezer (very well hidden). *Edit* I made these again tonight and instead of using all beef broth for the masa I used half beef and half chipotle made them extra tasty with a bit of spice this way actually turned out better than adding chipotle powder to the mix.

Delicious!  Very authentic taste and my wife and I had fun making them together.  I will say that we wish we had made more as they didn't last too long, and the left-over as just as good as fresh!  Looking forward to making more.

My husband made these and had a few problems following the directions. Mixing up the masa dough he was not sure how much of the broth to use and they turned out very dry, had good flavor with the meat tho. He was wanting to throw it all out but we saved the tamales and today I placed the wrapped tamales in a baking dish and added beef broth and heated them up in the oven, they soaked up all the broth and tasted great! Next time we'll understand better about using more of the broth so it's like a soft cookie dough!

I haven't made the tamales yet, but I did make the meat filling, and it was wonderful.  A couple things that I did was add a little more garlic, and some cumin seeds.  Also, after I drained the meat and onions and garlic mixture, I pureed the onions and garlic with a little of the broth to make a sauce and I mixed it in with the shredded pork. It really added flavor and helped the pork retain moisture.

The BEST dough recipe!  Awesome! Don't let the lard scare you.  It is a must....no worse than shortening, but it makes a HUGE difference!  Really whip it up for a light, fluffy dough!

These are great.  I didn't like the sauce that is made for them though, too bland.  Next time I will use 'Valentine Meican Hot Sauce' which can be bought at the supermarket (I buy it at Wal-Mart)...  I added it on top after cooking and wished I had used it on the meat inside.

Made this today, was great!  One tip we found was to use a small piece of plastic wrap to smooth out the masa onto the corn husk.  Worked awesome!!! :)  Also, no need to tie, just fold into thirds.  Put the masa down from the bottom about 2/3 up the husk, smooth out with plastic wrap, put a small line of filling down the middle, fold one side over filling, then fold over other side.  Masa will overlap but it's no problem.  Then fold top down.  Easy Peasy! :)  Thanks for a great recipe!! Oh yeah, put the folded side down near the water, and the open end towards the top, worked like a charm! :)  Thanks everybody else for sharing tips!!! :)

Fabulous, and easy to follow. It is definitely labor intensive, but several dozen tamales later, my freezer is stocked and a good dinner was had by all. The only suggestion would be to check the water you do the chiles in, and if it's bitter (mine was) use fresh water for blending the dried chiles. I also followed a readers suggestion and used a pork butt instead of a loin, much more tender and flavorful. Thanks for taking the time to post this !!

This recipe is exactly like the one I received from my neighbor who worked in a Mexican resteraunt in Colorado for most of her adult life.  We also used shredded beef in place of pork, but I think the pork is better.  We did not use the sour creme as a topping but  I will try it next time!  These froze really well too if any one is interested in making large batches.

Tamales in my opinion are a little hard to make. I got quite an arm workout making these but the taste was AMAZING! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Loved it! I made 24 count and I used 24oz of broth and cooked them for 2 .5 hrs. I covered the Tamales with corn husks and a cloth to keep moisture in.  Deliciosos Tamales!

This is excellent!! But we have made tamales for 60 yrs. We always do a pork roast and a beef roast. Shred them together. Much better flavor we think. Also we half black olives and put in mixture. Just some added flavor we could not do without.

Awesome recipe.  Have made several times.  My whole family loves them.  It'd recommended doubling or tripling the chili sauce so that you have extra to mix into the sour cream or just pour on top.

Time consuming but they came out so good, this was my first time. The one thing I did was peel off the skin off the chili peppers after they cooled down, that way you don't have to strain it. I also added some New Mexico red powder chili to the blended chili mixture for added flavor and heat.  I will make these tamales again!!!!

Good base recipe.  Could use more flavor and I will be searching for ways to enhance both the filling and the tamale dough.  But this is well written and offers advice on what to do exactly where you need it!  Note - following other reviewers I used Maseca brand masa harina and this is the recipe shared on that bag.  Nonetheless, Saddicat does throw in helpful tidbits that Maseca does not.

Used this for Christmas and was impressed.  The pork filling was raved about. A bit spicy for children but adults loved it with the chiliheads adding hot sauce but everyone else leaving it as is.  I couldn't find lard, thus used shortening instead.  So I tripled and replaced the plain salt in the masa portion with garlic salt for flavor.  I'll rate again after finding lard.  Thank you!

This was a great basic recipe.  I used store bought prepared masa (from the Mexican supermarket) and cooked the pork as directed but added cumin, black pepper, salt, bay leaf and more garlic to the cooking water.  I also seasoned the chile sauce with cumin, black pepper and onion powder.  My hubby and I had our own little "tamalada" and spent an hour or so assembling these.  It was fun.

Followed the recipe for the filling.  Exactly how I would make it with my grandma when I was a kid.  But for the masa, just used salt, water, lard; as this was how my mexican family would always make it.

i would make double the masa as the amount of meat you have if you want to do that much. but really that recipe makes a TON of tamales.
i kept in the seeds to make them hotter.

These were awesome!! I was a little scared to try them because it takes investing quite a bit of time and I wasn't sure they would turn out for me...but it was well worth the effort. I did substitute Crisco for the lard and it worked just fine.

OK, this was my first time making tamales ever.
I personally love peruvian style tamales (the masa is reddish brown, and they serve it with sliced onions in a light lemon vinegar sauce) but these turned out better than I had expected.

I used CHICKEN, and I made my masa very peanut buttery like - it really does dry out.  I also added an olive or two for each tamale...the oil & flavor naturally comes out while you steam it.

I worked so hard to make these and they were SOOOO bland.  Even with putting salsa, guac, sour cream, etc on them, we couldn't eat them cuz they were just too bland.  I give it 2 stars just because the instructions were good.

I'm not sure where this recipe would be considered authentic but I have never tasted Tamales like this.  The masa mixture is blah and the meat is bland.  You'll definitely need to up the seasoning in both the meat and masa maybe try adding oregano and bay leaf or two, and please please use the broth from your meat for the masa.

Use the broth for the masa. 
I fry the meat up after it has been boiled and shredded with a little vege oil. Chop the meat up while frying. Yes, chop!
Steam the tamales for 30-40 min.
My ex mother-in-law taught me this. She made these every year at Christmas. Her family was from Mexico.

This is a good solid STARTING recipe. 

The changes I suggest are using chile GUAJILLO.  Place the meat, the onion, a HEAD of garlic, 2 tbsp salt per lb of meat, 2 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp cumin. cover by at least one inch of water.  Cook overnight for best results, but until tender is fine. 
Take all the solids, cooled off a bit, blend and strain. it should be thick. shred meat, you should need no more seasonings, but check for salt. heat, add chile/ seasonings mix until slightly moist or 1/4 of the mix. 
Get your Masa, in a large bowl,  strain the broth. while broth is still warm, Mix 4 c masa, 3 c broth, leftover chile mix, 1 cup of lard. pour leftover chile  mix and 1 cup broth, mix  add broth to masa 1 cup at a time. when you can poke it and make a dent, add 3/4 cup of lard , and mix until slightly spongy. take a piece of dough, press it to the back of your hand. if any masa sticks, you need more lard. add 1/4 cup, mix, try again,  make sure you scrape the bottom often. it should be spreadable, if not, add more broth 
Take the husks, and soak them in hot water. at least 45 min. no more than 4 inches wide a the bottom, tear the bigger ones to desired size. save the small pieces.  every husk has a smooth and a bumpy side. choose the slickest side. you can use a spatula or big metal spoon (takes practice) and spread the masa on  until it covers the leaf OR
cut a ziplock bag open. place under y

These were amazing, I followed the recipe exactly and added cheese sauce with the other mole.  I will make this again as this was a learning process and I made a huge mess and will know better next time.  My picky family loved this!

Wow! It came out better than I expected! It needed to be steamed much longer than 1 hr. When I checked it after an hour, the dough was not as soft as I would like, so I steamed it longer. I think I steamed it for another 2-3 hrs. It was amazing!

This recipe turned out great! My tamales were moist & flavorful. Some reviewers said they tasted bland, I guess I always add extra seasoning for my own taste (garlic, onion powder) because I didn't have that problem. I will say that the amount of masa did not make nearly enough for the amount of pork filling I made. I had to do a double batch of masa & still had enough pork filling for enchiladas or tacos! Also, I used pasilla peppers & it was a rich deep color similar to mole. I pureed some garlic cloves I added to the boiled peppers for added depth of flavor. The pepper puree made an excellent accompaniment to cheese quesadillas the next night & would be a great marinade for chicken.

Perfect tamale mixture!  I tripled the recipes and  used this tamale spread for all kinds of tamales, from sweet potato & chorizo to traditional chilchen & green chile.

Made these today.  Loved the filling.  I had only dried chipotle peppers and they added a nice spice.  I must have made the masa too thick on the jusk becaue I had to make another batch.  I used chicken broth in that batch and preferred it to the beef.  I think you could probably use the cooking broth from the pork and it would be good, too.

First time I made tamales!  Very good.  I cooked a pork tenderloin overnight with extra spices as suggested.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great jumping-off point for beginners! Tamales are a tradition around here, but growing up in Florida, I didn't have much experience with them. I did take a few shortcuts- I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded about 2/3 of it, then I added the onion and a few cloves of garlic in with the peppers as they simmered (also, be sure to cover the pot when they simmer or you won't have enough sauce!) and they turned out wonderful! My native New Mexican husband wolfed down four of them almost immediately! If anybody has trouble finding real New Mexican chile, let me know and I'll be happy to send you some!

These are great whole family enjoyed them. I found that they were a little dry so I added more of the broth on the 2nd set and they came out perfect!

This is delicious and very easy to make.
I will use New Mexico chili next time for more heat because the California chili pods have no heat at all but still a great, amazing taste. For the masa I used double the salt indicated and it came out great, I will definetely make them again.
Thanks for the recipe.

great recipe!  as first-time tamale-makers, we were a little afraid, but they turned out great!  a few notes:
-we used the premade trader joe's carnitas ($3.99 for 12oz) and had MORE than enough meat.  i can't imagine if we'd had the entire 1 1/4 lbs!
-even after soaking the corn husks for an hour, we still had problems getting them to stay folded - toothpicks worked great to keep them shut during the steaming.
-the california chile was really mild - we think we'll try a spicier type next time.

all in all, great recipe!

The outside (Masa part) came out fabulous.  The pork was a little bland for my taste but I am working on that.  My first time making them and I thought it was time consuming but easy.  Friend just asked me if I would make more and said she would pay me for them!  So I would say these worked well.  Only yeilded 13 for me so I may try doubling the recipe.  Thanks so much, really liked this one.

Great recipe! I have been looking for a good tamale recipe for years, and this one fits the bill.  I make a full strength batch of these for the grownups and another mild batch for the kids (and wimps). Thanks!

Made tamales for the first time and they had a good flavor (I used pork in place of beef) but the masa dough was a bit crumbly. I wish that it gave a bit more information on how much liquid should be going into the dough. I think that was the reason for the crumbling. Tons of time for something that didnt turn out so well. Bummed but will try again with some help from YOUtube

Instead of using pork I used chicken. I boiled the chicken in water that was seasoned with saffron, and homemade adobo seasoning. I also seasoned the masa with the adobo seasoning and used the water the chicken was boiled in instead of canned. I boiled the chiles and I used two different kinds I added some cumin and adobo seasoning to the mole. This was the first time I have ever made tamales and they smell wonderful

Thanks, these came out perfect! It was the first time I made tamales and we loved them. For my filling I used leftover ropa vieja and they tasted great. Definitely will make these with the pork filling sometime.

I thought I would try making tamales with beef broth but my family and I prefer them with just water.  That could be because that's how we've always eaten them.  I didn't even like how the broth made them brown in color.

this recipe, while rather labor intensive, turns out perfectly every time. the only thing i change is to add more chiles to make it a little spicier.

Pretty good. I added a ton of spices to the meat to make sure they were not bland (cayenne, cumin, garlic salt, chili powder, oregano). Meat came out great. Masa was bland even though I added the meat broth.

I made 1/2 with pork and 1/2 with chicken.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The chile sauce was just awful.  Not sure if the dried chiles were poor quality or the recipe but it had no flavor, all we could taste was salt.  Highly recommend cooking the meats a day ahead of time and if possible working with at least one other person.  Less tiresome to make the tamales.  It is not hard just time consuming.

We made tamales for our church Christmas dinner. We made over 200 tamales following this recipe we used Maseca brand masa harina for the dough and we followed thair directions for that but I just want to say that the tamales were awesome. The next day we had tamale left overs for lunch after our Christmas church service.By the way tamales are always better the day after heat them up on the comal.

I made these and they were delicious. This was my first time making tamales so i was a little nervous. I used the broth from the beef , which was already seasoned with onion, cumin, chipotle powder, ancho chili powder, new mexico chili powder, and couple others, and put it in the masa. The masa should resemble peanut butter.

It was easier than I first assumed, but I do have a few notes. For one, if you have a slow cooker, use it. The meat cooks within 2 hours on high, and it shreds easier than tissue. I used pork *tender* loin as well, which wasn't too expensive. (3-4 bucks for 1.27 lbs) I threw in some extra cloves of garlic (it's my favorite aromatic!) as well. Rather than prepping the peppers to go directly into the filling, I threw dried peppers in with the meat and water to infuse it, then threw them away. This was a smart move, as it was still very spicy, but not "ruin your mouth forever" spicy. We also added basically every spice in our cabinets, including chipotle grind, paprika, cumin, giner, curry, and more. Certainly added the punch it needed. After picking out the meat, I picked out the onions and garlic to be pulverized by a food processor, and threw the peppers away (if you like things super spicy, you could savage a few, remove the seeds, and throw them into the processor). Then we used the cooking  liquid for the dough. You absolutely have to double or even triple the dough recipe if you want to use up all your meat. I over doubled it and we still had a little meat left over, and I was filling them generously. Don't worry if your dough doesn't pass the float test. Ours wouldn't float but still came out okay. It also had the texture of cookie dough or pie crusts, but balance masa and liquid so that the consistency works for you! Also I certainly suggest rolling them up like a cigar

I followed the recipe and made pork and chicken tamales.  My grand kids love them them and wanted more.  I am making a batch today.  Also, liked them with fresh salsa.  A real hit in my house. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!

This was great and made me feel accomplished at my first attempt at tamales. The masa-lard-chicken stock (didn't have pork) mixture turned out really well. The chicken in the chili sauce was so awesome. I will keep working at the recipe and by the time my kid comes home, i can try it out on him, too!

A bit bland for my taste. Reserve enough vegtable broth for masa dough with bullion added. Put the rest of the veg broth thru a blender. Season to taste, (I added chili powder and horse radish, etc). Run the meat (in my case. left-over bbq pork shoulder minus fat) thru a neat grinder. Combine meat and  broth and simmer to reduce and combine. COOL over night!!! Enjoy

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because it was just waaaayyyy too fiddley to make.  The meat mixture was very good but the dough was too sticky and it was impossible to find corn husks.  Made about 10 and that was enough for me.  Sorry!

Steaming time is more like 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  I used the left over pork from the Pork But Roast with Vegetables (shredded) on this site mixed with a 1/2 can of green enchilada sauce.  Really easy no fuss, and GOOD!

I only eat Meican food, not cook it so I read the reviews first and follow many suggestions. They turn out great. I went to other web sites to get an idea how to fold the corn the husks. I went to a few stores to find the spredder mentioned in one review but couldn't find it. The valentine hot sauce is very cheap and very hot ( mentioned in early review) but this sauce will always be handy to speed the receipt up.

As I have never made tamales before, I was a little concerned whether it would be too hard or difficult.  This recipe is so easy and delicious.  It is no more work than making homemade lasagne or stuffed cabbage.  The only confusion I had was at to which masa to buy, but I figured it out.  I will make it again with various different fillings.

My first attempt at tamales. I followed this recipe except in place or shortening I used lard. I thought they were great. But to my surprise friends and family raved about them. Many comments such as “best tamales I’ve ever had”. Thank you for posting such a great recipe

Used chicken.  Added salsa because it really needed about twice as much red sauce.  I recommend using twice as many California chilies.

They are great!  It took a bit longer than expected but most of that time was simply cooking time.  Prep time seemed tedious.  If you can, have help as many hands make for light work.

All in all, great success my first time making tamales.  I shall make them again.  Next time with green chilies, cheese and green sauce.

Whipping the lard makes all the difference.  So moist.  The only change would be the flavor of the masa.  It can be very bland if not seasoned properly.

This was fabulous.  I used chicken and pork.  I did use chili sauce and broth in the dough as well as adding cumin.  The hardest part for me was wrapping but they turned out so good.  The tip on a ball of dough floating in water  to know if it was right worked.

I loved this "easy" recipe......I say easy because it took me 3 days to finish haha!!  DAY 1:  Cooked the pork butt roast I was using for about 8 hrs. on LOW in the crock pot with seasonings & onion.   DAY 2:   Heated the crock pot on HIGH and once heated removed the meat and put in separated covered container to refrigerate over night.  Leave remaining broth in crock pot on LOW.  DAY 3:  Season the broth in the crock pot.  I used chili pods,  salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, cumin,  a bit of chili pepper  (Just all amounts to my taste)  Set crock pot now on HIGH for a good couple hours---then pour the broth/brine from the crock pot in to a sauce pan.  Return the pulled back to the crock pot and heat on HIGH add as much of the broth as desired to the pork.   Other then the above I followed the masa dough recipe as directed,  using my broth of course.  But OHH Nooo---What do I do,  I don't have that much needed steamer pot RIGHT??  Ladies...cough couch,  let me tell you a little trick.....Take any tall stock pot you hopefully own and ball up tin-foil  (around the size of a baseball ) and set in the bottom of a dry (tall) stock pot (you will need to make several of these balls depending size of your stock pot keeping in mind we only want the steam to be able to escape up through the different vents holes from the balls) ,  add water and put on your stove  (I have a gas stove and had it on 4).  Set your tamales standing up right with folded end sitting on the balls of tin foil.

For a first time tamale maker this was excellent. However there are some things you can do to make it easier. I used the instant masa you just add water to. Also the pepper sauce wasn’t really needed. It also doesn’t specify how long to soak corn husk and little details like that

I would like to begin with the fact that I am a first time tamale maker and because of what I had in the house, I used this recipe as more of a guideline, but  my dad and I really enjoyed  the tamales, they had a great flavor and the one hour cooking time was perfect. I used a broccoli steamer in a pot and parchment paper to wrap them. I also added water several times to keep the bottom of the pot from burning, (do not pour the water on the tamales!) I used canned chicken and cooked it in a pot with onions and chilli powder and because I had corn meal on hand, I used a cup of that and subbed out 2 Tbsp for corn starch. This worked very well. I also subbed out some of the butter in the batter for broth, I beat the butter (almost melted) into the broth and then mixed in my dry and beat that too to fluff it up. It was tricky to spread, so I used my fingers.  I put more than a Tbsp of meat in each and pressed the edges of together like a parchment-wrapped perigee.

One thing- the ratio of pork to Masa is off in this recipe. if you make it as written you will likely have a quarter pound of pork +/- left over unless you're really packing it in there! 

Otherwise, while there's always room for improvement, this is a very serviceable recipe as written.

Additional notes. You may have to double or triple the recipe for the dough, unless you want only bite size tamales.

It turned out pretty good. I would have used more chili sauce, and I did end up with more masa than the filling as well. Though, I think it was just my bad teqnique. Will try again soon!

I LOVE tamales and have always wanted to make them myself but everyone says it's such a long and tedious process.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a go!  I put my pork in the crock pot on low overnight so by morning it was falling apart. 

When I started pulling all of my ingredients out to make the tamales I noticed I missed a vital ingredient.  Lard.  I found several other sources online that said other fat substitutes would be okay so I used bacon grease and butter.  My husband is Hispanic and said the masa tasted amazing so I'd say it was a successful substitution.  

A popular review for the recipe suggested that you needed to soak the corn husks for at least an hour so that's what I was going to do but after soaking for about 10 minutes the husks were very soft and plyable.  The recipe wasn't clear if you were supposed to gently separate the husks before putting them in water or just throw a whole chunk in.  I separated mine so perhaps that's why they softened so fast.  And honestly, it only took a couple of minutes to separate enough husks for the tamales.

It did take a few tries to get the right consistancy for the masa to spread out on the corn husk.  The review I mentioned earlier said it should spread like peanut butter and while I never got it quite to that consistancy it did spread pretty easily over the corn husk.  I also had trouble getting to the recommended 1/4-1/2 inch thickness.  I felt like the harder I tried to make a thicker tamale the smalle

100% worth the time and effort. I made double since tamales freeze well for quick lunches. It was a bit tough to find the right ingredients in New England but you can get the husks on Amazon. I ended up using dried red chiles from the Indian market and used a bunch of them instead of the large dried peppers since I could find any in this area. Also, I used the broth left behind from the pork in the masa which turned out beautifully.

We had a ton of barbecued pulled pork left from a pig-roast, and a wedding to help cater... viola!  Lots of labor, but what a wonderful outcome!  I live in northern Spain, where no one´s ever tasted Mexican food, and assumes it´s all red-hot chili peppers... these tamales were a revelation to the whole village! I shall be making them for many fiestas to come, I think...

Excellent recipe and although a lot of steps - pretty easy.  I made it once to recipe specs and the second time I made it, I added salt to my peppers and a pinch of sugar when I was blending them to take off that bitter edge.   Don't make the dough with anything but lard - this is one place you don't want to ruin the flavor and texture.  Don't want extra calories? Skip the sour cream.  And the flavor of the dough isn't supposed to be super exciting - it's not a dumpling, it's ground corn meal to wrap meat.  The sauce and meat is where you get your flavors.  I understeamed mine then baked 
them with the sauce and cheese (just to melt the cheese) and was supremely satisfied.

I made these twice, once using this recipe. And the second masa I made, was from a different masa recipe. 

Which I ended up substituting for because the original ingredients for the masa is incomplete. 

The meat portion of the recipe I used and the substitute masa recipe to complete this dish. 

Final result was spectacular though, three stars because of the wasted ingredients and time this is a task for one person. 

Also, I did eventually watched a youtube video of how to load the masa and its meat contents. You don't need to get that exact. 

You spread it all over leaving the pointed end clear of masa, then you fold one side of the leaf over then fold the next leaf on top of that leaf  then fold the end that was not covered with masa up. 

Stand them upright with folded leaves against each other in a pot tight together (I don't have a tamale steamer) but this worked just as well. 

Keep in mind you need to keep a watchful eye like every 15mins check your water levels which needs to be kept at least one to two inches. You can end up burning the leaves if the pot runs dry. I scorched my leaves but it didn't effect the flavor really.  

This takes a lot of time.
I started too late in the day to begin. I learned two lessons though so next time number one. I will start in the am and not in the afternoon. And number two; if its just one person making these, like myself. It will be better taking two days rather than one day to make these. Applying masa is the most time consumi

Can someone tell me how to make tamales filling that is like extremely mild, not bland, but so mild you barely notice any heat?  Please?  I want to make a red sauce using tomatoes and a pinch of roasted chili powder.  Will that work? How can I flavor it up if that will work?

This recipe is really good, but I changed things up a little. So instead of using a Dutch Oven, I used a crock pot and cooked the meat overnight.  Then after the chili’s boiled and cooled, I mixed the sauce with the meat (after I shredder it) and cooked in the crock pot for about 4 more hours, until the meat has cooked the sauce in and flavor is just right. Then I continued the recipe as is, but used Crisco Shortening instead of Lard.  They still taste Great!

Having grown up in So Cal, I know what types of Mexican food I like. This tamale recipe is about as close to home as I've ever had. Don't substitute anything for the base recipe and be sure to use lard. I topped with melted cheese, tomatoes, and salsa. YUM

I used this recipe as a guide, but subbed shredded chicken breast and chicken stock for the pork and beef broth, and used butter in place of the lard.  My 12 year old son helped make the tamales and enjoyed it.  Great to make ahead on the weekend and steam for an easy weeknight dinner.  Rave reviews from everyone, from the picky  5 and 8 year olds to the 50+ crowd.  I will make variations of this recipe frequently!  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic recipe, and do freeze well. I made them the weekend prior to serving. I made 4 times the recipe and almost got about 10 each batch. Steaming takes longer, and don't over fill the steamer basket to reduce time.

I was craving these for the longest time and I had no idea what place sold them so i decided to make them on my own. Sounded great. So i did.They turned out pretty nice. Although the chicken ended up a little dry. I would suggest added chili powder and a little bit of hot sauce. Also a little bit of oil to the shredded chicken so that its not so dry. Also the way that she makes it isnt right. You want to spread the chicken along the dough pretty well so it fills the whole tamale and then wrap it. Also you will most likely need to make more dough batches than that. I made 8 batches of dough just to use all my corn husks. Other than those minor things i think the recipe was pretty great! :)

I read most of the reviews and put more spices in the mix. Not spices to heat the taste but to give it more complexity.  Cumin, chili powder, oregano and basil.  Not a lot, I also heated a small bit of meat and dough in microwave to see if the tamale would be flavorful.  I used the pepper sauce and roast juice to moisten the batter.  The chili paste that was left from draining away the liquid was  added to the filling. The liquid was reduced from cooking for about 10 minutes to make it thicker.   Family said it was a keeper.

Great basic  recipe.  I just used my drippings from my pork to flavor the masa.  I also cooked my pork in a crockpot.  I used two cans of domestic beer and some beef stock paste, bay leafs, garlic, large onion, and lots of salt/pepper.  I have found the more flavor you give the masa the better.

The dough came out very wet and sticky.  I didn't like this particular tamale dough recipe very much. The instructions are confusing as they are typed.

Loved this recipe!  I purchased pork asado already made and I used a can of red enchilada sauce with a jar of ChiChi's salsa which I mixed into the meat.  I did season the meat more with  salt, adobo and cumin. I took a hint from several people  here that mentioned whipping up the lard with a little broth to start.  Then I slowly added a little more broth and some of the masaca flour. I alternately added both.  You want the dough to be slightly sticky. Just a tad firm. Take a pea size dough and if it floats in a cup of water you're good to go. Then I took my soaked husks (I allowed mine to soak for about 3 hours) and laid a small amount of the dough, topped with meat, rolled up, folded one end up and stood them all in my steam pot.  Quick and easy to assemble!  Great taste!!  Will never buy pre-made tamales again. These were excellent!  Oh. I also added shredded meat  from a rotisserie chicken.  Very good!

good recipe: Add diced green chillies to masa with a little enchilada seasoning: cook and drain small amount of chorizo to meat mix of your choice.

It's great! My family love it. It tastes better with hot sauce. I used the meat juice to replace broth. I also added 1 cube of chicken bouillon in the meat juice when make mesa dough. I also replaced lard with butter simply because I didn't find lard at the grocery store. Will make it again.

Used this recipe yesterday to make some homemade tamales. Being in the UK made getting access to some ingredients difficult, but I was able to make my own masa using Maseca brand masa harina from MexGrocer.co.uk and made chile sauce with dried Ancho and Arbol chiles (bought from Tesco) instead of those listed in the recipe.

Following other people's suggestions, I made a few other changes: I seasoned the pork (shoulder) with salt, cumin seed, cumin powder, and a little mild chili powder while it cooked, and then made my masa using the pork broth and some of the left-over chile sauce (I also blended the onion and garlic from the pork cooking with my chilies for the sauce).

Steaming the tamales was the easiest part, but I wasn't sure if they were working right. Mine leaked a bit (steamer wasn't deep enough to stand upright, so I laid mine flat), and the masa kept seeming far too soft, but eventually I followed the advice that they would be done when the corn husk peeled away cleanly, and the masa firmed up within a few minutes of removing from the steamer. 

In all, this was excellent. A LOT of hard work, but I'll be sure to make a gigantic batch next time to freeze a bunch for later, and I'll also split the work across two days (meat and chile sauce one day, masa and tamale making the next). I'm definitely looking forward to improving this next time, and to experimenting with some other filling options!

I've made tamales three times using this recipe and they always turn out great.  I always buy a pork shoulder from Sam's Club which comes with two roasts about 7 pounds each.  I cook both roast at the same time. I use a pork Carnitas recipe from A/R for one roast which I then add the one cup of chile pepper water to the 1.5 pounds of pork for the tamales.  I then use the rest of the roast for tacos (with the chile pepper water), enchildas, buritos, etc.  The second roast I season more traditionally and serve it a number of ways from pork roast to pulled pork BBQ, etc.  The Tamales always get rave reviews.

I believe this is the recipe I used last Xmas , I hope it is because the masa and the meat came out 100% Fantastic, I just got myself a nice pressure cooker going to put the pork inside Yummy , I will try a few in the cooker and see how they come out only because its a little time consuming to assemble, but well worth it. If all goes well with it, I will let all know. Thanks for this tamale recipe. Im glad I saved this they came out awesome from last year will try again , almost similar to moms masa, great recipe.

After visiting The Tamale Place in Indianapolis I wanted to do tamales. However, don't limit yourself to just one flavor. Make some generic meat fillings ( stewed chicken, beef, and pork). Next, make some sauces ( I like mole, salsa verde, and spicy picante) you can them mix and match the meat and sauces for a bounty of tamale goodness.

I make all my tamales with Coconut oil instead of the lard, less calories and you can not even tell the difference.
