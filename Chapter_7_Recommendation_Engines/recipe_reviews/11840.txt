Very tasty recipe BUT - be careful with cumin. It is a very strong, pungent spice and I only used 1/2 teaspoon and it was still a little overpowering. But the ginger/garlic/lemon/cayenne/mustard seed combo has an AMAZING flavor! Also I used half and half instead of cream and it was still nice and creamy.

Excellent.   I'm even asked to make it.    I substitute fat free half and add a couple of tablespoons of wonder flour to thicken in place of the cream.    You can also use powered ginger.   We also use chicken which I think is even better.

This is actually really delicious and different. I have made it with shrimp and grilled chicken. If you make it with chicken, add peas. It's just great.  Now, the actual recipe of this that originated with a renowned Indian chef calls for a full cup of tomato sauce (omitting the water) with the cup of heavy cream, so that is what I did, and I loved it. He also states the use of olive oil instead of veg. oil, so that is recommended, as it is healthier.   I use the full amounts of everything, spices, etc. I wouldn't change the amounts at all. It is a rich, mouth-watering experience.   Lovely and one of my new favorites. Not for the bland of palette. Great with a nice bread.

tasted ok, but was quite watery because i didn't use cream like they said and used milk instead. So if i had used cream this would have been a lot better i'm guessing.

I substituted the heavy cream with evaporated goat milk (because of cow milk allergy and to reduce the fat and calories), and it came out really delicious. This sauce is interesting, kind of like a curry but not really like it served with pasta. Which I did, and it was soooo good.

I'm nor sure if this sauce is officially considered a curry or not, but the closest thing I can compare it to is a tomato-based version of green curry sauce. It has the same spicyness with a cream base. I will be keeping this recipe in my repertoire for when I want spicy Indian food - it's easy to make & you can have most of the ingredients on hand; just buy the shrimp, ginger & cream when you're ready to make it.

This was good.  I made the mistake of serving over ravioli, I should have used thin spaghetti.  The sauce was disappointingly thin.  It is spicy though, the kind of spicy that sneaks up on you.  I need to come up with a way to thicken the sauce a bit.  My husband doesn't want it again, so I don't think I'll have the chance.

Very very peppery.  If you like pepppery/spicy taste, you'll like it.  If not... try making it with waaaaaaaaaaaaaay less mustard seed.  Other than that, excellent.

This was delicious -- both my husband and I loved it! I did add cornstarch to thicken the sauce, half the amount of cumin, and extra lemon juice. The flavours were great together; thanks for sharing!!!

Very good.  Next time I would use half the cumin since my husband thought it was a little hot.

This is quite good. I used half & half instead of heavy cream, reduced the cumin to 1/4-1/2 tsp. and accidentally added the garlic (used 4 cloves) to the sauce mixture instead of sauteing, but it worked out fine. I only had 340g of shrimp, which was barely enough but the sauce and noodles were just fine too. I served this over rice vermicelli. Will make again.

Great pink sauce. Just the right amt of heat for us but can be easily adjusted. Be sure to use the cream to get it thick enough.

It wasn't flavorful enough for us.  The only changes I made were I used half and half and tomato paste instead of purée.  I would make it again, but would add more  spice or seasoning.

I had some white fish, so added it to the shrimp along with some diced mango and cilantro for garnish.I also sautéed some diced mushrooms along with the garlic to add in more veggies. This turned out really good. The mango and cilantro really freshened up the flavours.

Used tomato sauce instead of purée.  Very good, but sauce is quite liquid, and I think it would be better with cous cous than with pasta.  Still really delicious!!!

Wonderful flavor! My only disappointment was that the sauce was very thin. I think that next time I will reduce the sauce in a pot before adding it to the shrimp. I did not have any mustard seeds, so I added some ground mustard to the sauce. I also sauteed some spinach along with the shrimp. Will be making this again!

This recipe was excellent!  I made some modifications with the ingredients I had on hand-- I changed heavy cream to half and half; I used tomato paste instead of tomato puree; I added one package of chopped frozen spinach (previously thawed-- sauteed with the garlic).  The flavor was outstanding!  I would not cut down any of the spices-- they were perfect.  I did not add the red pepper to the main dish but added it to individual bowls afterwards (I have three young kids).  Saying that, I have four children ranging from 1-18;  they all devoured this dish!

Very good.  Made exactly as stated.  The kids thought it was a little spicy but still ate everything on their plate.  I thought it was good as written.  Thanks
