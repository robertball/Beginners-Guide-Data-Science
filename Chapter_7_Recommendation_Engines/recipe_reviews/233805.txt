The only change that I made, being a diabetic was using Polaner Allfruit Preserves instead of Dickinson's. They are very easy to make and taste great.

Needed to add about 6 more ounces of cream cheese to balance the preserves.  Used vanilla yogurt instead of plain since that is what I had on hand.

I substituted blackberries for strawberries and they turned out great! but I needed to add 4 more ounces of cream cheese than the recipe called for to balance out the preserves! it makes more than 24.

Yummy! I used raspberries and raspberry jam. I added about 4oz of jam then kept taste testing and adding a little more so it wasnâ€™t too sweet. Easy!!! And I used tart shells.

After reading other reviews, I added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I made blackberry, blueberry and raspberry and all were yummy.

I read all the reviews with their suggestions prior to making it. I used strawberry preserves and added another 4oz of cream cheese and it is very tasty. My family all enjoyed it.

These were easy to make, super delish, and a huge hit at the party I took them to. Next time I will use slightly less yogurt, as it ended up being a bit too soft (runny) for my liking.

I love a recipe that's so flexible!  I'm not a fan of blackberries but love raspberries, so I used seedless raspberry jam instead.  Also used Greek plan yogurt, and found the mixture in need of a little sweetening - a spoonful of powdered sugar did the trick.  I had a LOT of filling left over, but am considering using it as a filling for a chocolate dessert . . lots of possibilities!

Simple and amazing. I made these for a catering event at the Historic Ship Nautilus, and the people just ate them up. They are cost effective and really simple.
