Instructions were not really clear for a first timer. Bouillon mixture I assumed was the chicken broth. Marjoram was not listed but directions made it sound like a necessity when you have only a printed copy instead of online view where it said marjoram can be substituted so it was not known.

Exactly what I was looking for! Tastes just like what Grandma makes except that this is an actual recipe, whereas Grandma adds a "little of this and a pinch of that" :) I'll be making this again!

I was never much of a stuffing fan until I tried this recipe.  Let me also say, I generally dislike celery, so don't let the name of this throw ya.  However, I've made this stuffing 6 or 7 times now, including for Thanksgiving, and just love it.  I rate it 4 stars as-is.  However, I have made some adjustments to suit my tastes.  I increase the seasonings to 1/2 tsp sage (plus a light sprinkle on top too) and 1/8 tsp of thyme which I crush between my fingers while adding.  I also only use 2 eggs (which seems not enough when you first pour it over the dry bread cubes, but once the broth is added, it works fine).  Oh, and I drop the salt down to 1 tsp, never even tried it with 1T, just seems it would be too salty with the broth and butter, especially if you tend to ladle gravy over it on your plate.  Anyway, with these modifications, I give it 5 stars!  I keep forgetting to try the marjoram - next time.  I follow the directions for baking it outside the turkey (about 2.5 - 3 cups total broth, buttered glass baking dish with lid, 350 for 45 mins) and it comes out perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Very happy to have found it.

Great recipe for homemade stuffing! I cut this back to 8 servings and used 1 egg and eyeballed the herbs adding a bit of marjoram.  This was a nice alternative to mashed potoates for a change!

Very good.  Moist and flavorful without being overpowering.  Got many good comments from the family.  The amount is generous and it expanded in the turkey quite a bit!

This recipe was a big hit! I made it for Easter dinner and it complimented my ham very well. I changed the serving size to 8 and I also used rubbed sage in addition to ground sage and added in marjoram and thyme for more flavor. I used 1 can of chicken broth and baked it a little longer so the top would be crispy. It was delicious!

This was excellent, classic celery stuffy, BUT, you need to add WAY more sage and thyme.  I kept adding and adding until I thought it tasted right.  EXCELLENT and easy!!

I would give this 4.75 stars if I could. I accidentally added 1 tablespoon of fresh pepper, instead of 1 teaspoon. I also added all 3 cups of chicken bouillon. Next time I will use less salt, the buillion was salty enough as is. Wonderful recipe and I love that it doesn't have any sausage meat. This will definately become my standard stuffing recipe!

I was looking for a different version of this recipe and made a few alterations to the ingredients and it turned out great.

·	2 cups chopped celery 
·	3 cups chicken broth, divided 
·	1 cup chopped onion 
·       1 Tablespoon minced garlic 
·	1/2 cup butter
·      (2) 6oz boxed chicken flavor stuffing mix 
·	3 eggs, beaten 
·	1 tablespoon salt 
·	1 teaspoon ground black pepper



I just baked mine in a 9 x 13 pan as directed and added the extra cup of chicken broth with a baster 30 mins into baking.

I thought this was great!  I did saute the celery with the onion, and only boiled a couple of minutes.  I needed a bit more chicken broth cause I did mine in a baking dish.  The top was nice and crunchy and the inside was delicious and moist!  Why is there marjoram in the directions, but not in the ingredients.  I was out anyway so I didn't add it but it would have been a nice addition.  Thanks for making my first stuffing a great experience!

I used my own homemade, whole wheat bread cubes, used 1 egg and 2 whites.  I also used 1/4 cup canola in place of the butter.  I did not saute anything but just tossed it all together and baked it. Nice recipe and easily adaptable.  Will make again.

Perfection. Plain and simple.  I would NEVER  use another recipe.  I add Italian Sausage (a family tradition) but it is perfect without.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the middle.  Yum-o-rific!

i am not a stuffing fan, but like to keep the turkey moist and i know a lot of my family enjoys it, so i throw some together every year at thanksgiving and christmas.  tried this version though and the little taste i snuck was actually not bad - had more flavor and seasonings to it, so it didn't taste like the inside of a turkey to me...  and everyone else who likes to indulge in stuffing said this recipe was the best they've had!

Only needed 2 cups of broth. Didn't add salt (due to dietary needs) or sage (didnt have it)... and it was still delicous. I should've let it brown a little bit longer just to add a little more taste.

My family enjoyed this very much.   I also added more thyme & sage then the recipe called for.  I also had two golden delicious apples on my counter & diced that up along with 1/2 cup cranberries & added that too.  So moist & so delish!

Hands down, the best stuffing I've ever had! We served this alongside the Sunday Dinner Mashed Potatoes found on this site and they complimented each other very well. My husband loved them and went back for seconds. He's the main chef in our family and is a connoisseur of fine cooking, and even he agreed this was some of the best stuffing he's ever had!

I don't really get all the good reviews. 1 tablespoon of salt was far too much. We spent the entire afternoon trying to dilute it with an additional load of bread!

This stuffing was really easy to make. I toasted a loaf of white bread in the oven, then had the kids cut them up (with a butter knife..they're only 5 & 7!) into little squares, then followed the recipe. When it came time to add the broth, I spooned out all the "stuff" and drizzled the broth over the bread just a bit at a time. I actually didn't use most of the broth (to be cautious not to make the bread soggy) so after I stuffed the turkey, I poured the remaining broth into the turkey pan and used it to baste the bird. Soooooo good!

It's just what I've been looking for but the instructions call for marjoram but it's not listed in the ingredients above. How much marjoram is needed? I've never used marjoram before.

This was my first official Thanksgiving at my house so I wanted everything to be perfect. I chose this recipe because it was straightforward and had no ingredients that anyone could complain about - lots of opinions on stuffing out there. Also, did not stuff the bird and it tasted great baked in a casserole dish. Everyone in my family was happy and ate it all up, There was hardly any leftovers and this makes a large batch!

yum, what a nice poultry stuffing. i added both the thyme & marjoram for added flavor plus sauteed a tiny bit of finely chopped carrot for color. i also had success in scaling this recipe down to 8 servings. went well with the delicious "easy herb roasted turkey" also on this website. thanks jerri!

The spices were just right, but I will definitely be cutting the amount of salt by over 1/2 next time.  WAY TOO SALTY :(

Good but not great. I cooked it in my convection oven and it was moist. I just think it was missing something... I used butter not margarine but omitted the salt since I used boullion. The celery was not over powering.

I wanted a traditional stuffing to go with our supper tonight and decided to try this. It was great! I believe I doubled the sage but otherwise went by the recipe. This is my go-to stuffing recipe from now on.

My husband is not a big fan of stuffing. However, he ate 2 helpings and leftovers the next day. It turned out moist inside and crunchy on top. It was not over seasoned and went great with the turkey.

Soooo good! I made the following changes: lightly toast the bread b4 dicing, add 2-3 cups diced chicken, and a handful of fresh sage, and 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning. Then instead of taking so much time to bake it, I do what my mother always did....I fry it in a no-stick pan in lots of butter. Make sure to fry it putting only a thin layer in pan at a time Killer!

Absolutely no need for that much broth! I used this recipe almost as is: I used about two-three tablespoons of broth to wet the bread mixture, while fishing out all the good chunky stuff. :) The turkey gives the stuffing enough moisture without the extra broth in my opinion. I make the turkey in a bag and it all turned out perfectly!

My first stuffing and it was yummy. We used the crumbs from our favorite homemade bread recipe (Fabulous Homemade Bread, by J. Drury). We'll definitely make it again. Thanks for the submission.

Way too much salt. One tsp. is enough. I also cooked the celery with the onions. I used poultry seasoning in place of the thyme and sage.  It was exactly what I wanted.

This was very easy to make and a nice way to soak up the gravy from the turkey. The flavor was not too strong, but it was not bland by any means either.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and my husband (who LOVES stuffing with a passion) couldn't stop raving about it. He even ate it cold right from the fridge the next day... This is now my go-to "old school" stuffing recipe (I've made it several times since).  I don't change a thing except to add just a bit more sage (one of my favorite spices). As a sidenote, I always bake it in a casserole dish; I never stuff the turkey with it and it turns out great.  Never too dry...

Pretty good stuffing.  This was my first time making stuffing without sausage and it was really easy.  I love the taste of sage so I added extra.  The proportions seemed right to me.  I used several different types of leftover bread that I cubed myself.  I think you could definitely play around with this recipe by adding cranberries but overall it is a good easy stuffing recipe.  I would consider using this stuffing for an everyday meal and not just for Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I can’t believe I found a recipe with the exact ingredients as my mother’s dressing! I have been looking for this recipe for 30 years! My mom gave it to me but, like someone else said, she didn’t have measurements. It was just, some of this and enough til it tastes right! My mom has been gone now for 21 years and I am so happy to have found this!

As stuffing goes, I added carrots  to bring a little sweetness to it, also added two eggs and put it in a slow cooker for a bit and by the time the turkey was out of the oven the stuffing was done in the slow cooker.

It’s absolutely delicious. I substituted coconut oil for butter and it turned out great. The only negative is 1 tablespoon of salt is WAY too much! I would start with a teaspoon or two. Not sure we’re going to be able to finish it because of the salt.

great flavor,  and great for in the Bird. it is more of a traditional pudding. if this is destined to be a side, I recommend toasting the bread cubes in a 350 degree oven first, to maintain shape

After trying several different stuffing recipes I will be keeping this one for future meals. Made according to directions and it was a success. I think this would also be a great base recipe to play around with different additions.

This is the best stuffing recipe!  The only thing I did different was add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more broth.  My family loved it and there wasn't any left over, which normally doesn't happen!  I will be preparing this recipe at every holiday meal!

Delicious stuffing. I cooked it separate from the turkey so I was able to get a nice crunchy layer on top. I will use this again.

Such wonderful flavor and just the right moisture especially as I didn't stuff a turkey with it. Plain just how my family likes it and simple to make too! Baked it in a casserole dish in the oven an it came out perfectly!! This will become my go to recipe for stuffing.

This stuffing was delicious, I like my stuffing a little more dry, so I went with 2 cups of broth, and I tripled the sage, it was everything ii hoped it be, I also cut an egg out. I'd definitely make this again!

This tasted great! I ended up having to use less bread and more broth so make sure that everything was covered. I also did not use this to stuff the turkey but instead put it uncovered in the oven for 40 min on 350 degrees. I would definitely make this again!

I will never, ever buy boxed stuffing again. It has forever been ruined for me! I used day old Italian bread and I added some onion powder with the other spices. And I did this in a casserole dish, not in a turkey. We couldn't stop eating this! Awesome!

This recipe is a keeper. I didn't stuff it in the turkey, just cooked it separately. I threw it in the oven while the turkey was resting for about 30-40 minutes. Tasty!

Simply beautiful stuffing! A must try, especially if you don't have a bird to fill. Just the right consistency. I didn't have some of the spices, so I substituted with Italiano Seasoning in its place.....Sage and marjoram are on my grocery list. Thanks for sharing your recipe. We are stuffed :)

Great recipe.  This will be my 5th year making this stuffing and everyone loves it.   Even though i grew up eating stuffing that was stuffed in a turkey, I have not yet used it in my bird yet.  I bake mine in a casserole dish while the turkey is resting and it is fabulous!  I can imagine it would be incredible acctually stuffed in the turkey! The broth i use for this and for my gravey i make by taking the neck and maybe a couple of wings, put in my pressure cooker and cover with water. Pressure cook for maybe 15 to 20 minutes and you an awesome turkey stock!

I made this recipe two years ago and EVERYONE LOVED it! I couldn't find the print out for last year and I was so sad that I couldn't find it online either! I made a real effort to find it this year and I cannot wait till it is out of the oven in 40 minutes! I added three garlic cloves, minced, and Italian seasoning that another person suggested in the reviews! :)

Way too salty. Other than that it was great. Will cut back on salt next time!

My father always made stuffing with celery and its leaves.  We always add some oregano and creole seasoning.

If you add a sleeve of Ritz crackers or Club crackers that have been rolled into very fine crumbs it puts this over the top.

I made this, this year. I usually make may same homemade stuffing that I actually used loaves of bread and it is always a hit.  I tried to be different this year and I will never do that again.  The old saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is true.  This stuffing was soooooo dry and my husband said it tasted like sand paper.  I had to add so much more broth and butter than it called for.
