I didn't realize that this dish called for whole trout or a grill, so I spread the pepper/mango mixture over filets, wrapped them in aluminum foil and broiled them. It turned out well, though the cilantro got really mushy and tasted like canned spinach. Perhaps next time I'll wait until the fish is halfway cooked before putting the pepper/mango mixture on it.

I have served fresh mango salsa with other fish before - char, salmon - but this is the first time stuffing and baking. Turned out well. Saved some of the fresh salsa to serve on the side just in case. Good stuff. About 3 1/2 stars.

Made this with Brook trout I caught in Canada. It was fantastic. My wife said it was the best fish she has ever had. The Jalapeno added just enough heat and the mango did not make it taste too sweet. I served it with garlic cream sauced Fettuccini with fresh spinach. Great combination.

Great recipe!  Used rainbow trout caught ice fishing, but didn't have access to fresh mango, so I used canned pineapple instead and the result was fantastic.  Hope to try mango the next time.  Served with wild rice.  My boyfriend and I are avid fishermen but he loves to eat fish and I am learning to like it.  This recipe was enjoyed by both of us.

Great Recipe. Wouldn't change a thing. Used Ruby Trout. Forgot to add the jalapenos, but luckily had some jalapeno hotsauce and added it at the end. Made some roasted corn and one of those Lipton Thai Noodles with it. It was great. Hubby loved it.

I want to try this recipe since it has such great reviews but as I was compiling my shopping list I saw the recipe called for olive oil, which isn't in the recipe steps.  Then as I was going through the steps, I saw lime juice, which isn't in the ingredient list.  Then I went through the reviews and everyone was raving about the mango, which isn't listed anywhere.  If anyone can explain the lime juice, olive oil and mango, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.

Very tastey - the fish was tender and delicious and the compote was equally as good. No doubt this is a keeper!

This was fantastic! I just found a new favorite fish recipe. I used vidalia onion instead of the green ones. When I make it again, I'll use more mango.

This was VERY good.  I made it exactly as the instructions said, and it could not have been better!  I love the mango/jalepeno mix...

Absolutely excellent. I used only 1 fish (19" Dollie, so technically a char I guess), so mixed the ingredients in a lower quantity, but the result was fantastic. I've known for years how great mango goes with fish, but the jalapenos gave it the perfect kick I've been missing with the other trout I cooked. The charcoal flavor was there, but not overbearing, and another bonus is the skin sticks to the foil so it pulls right off. Overall it lacked nothing. I will definitely be using this recipe for future fish fries. Thank-you very much for it.

Didn't think the Mango added a whole lot. The salsa didn't really do much imo actually.

Made this last night--super easy and good.  I didn't have mangoes but used oranges instead. Excellent!  This was my family's first trout experience but we were all very impressed, even our 4 year old (mommy it has eyes!)  LOL  This is a keeper.

This was wonderful.  We used filets instead of a whole trout (and the grilling time was under 10 minutes with two small filets per packet), and since mangoes couldn't be found, we used honeydew.  I can see how mango would be tasty, but the honeydew also worked quite nicely.

I also made this with trout filets. It was ok but not great - too many flavors and textures going on. The fish was very thin and cooked quickly, way more quickly than the veggies. Nice for a change but I wouldn't make it again. Thanks anyway.

From the smell of it cooking I was expecting a WOW meal, but although it was tasty, the salsa didn't flavor the meat as much as I expected it to. It was yummy with a bite of fish and salsa together, but maybe with a piece if dry fish, like shark or halibut it might absorb the juices of the salsa better. Will definitely try again.

This recipe does not tell you to add the jalapenos to the mango mix, so it was confusing as to what to do with them.  I improvised and simply added them.  I love the taste with the jalapenos, although I think a little salt goes a long way here.  I would have given it a five, but the directions for the jalapenos was left out.

fantastic recipe!  It wasnt as spicy as I thought it would be either. However I used about 6 med-large pieces of trout, and only 2.5 jalapenos. Next time I would add 3 like the recipes calls for. I would also add more mango, as I couldnt really taste it.  I will definitely make this again!!
