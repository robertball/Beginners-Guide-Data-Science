I made this tonight and my family could not eat it. The yogurt made it way too tangy. I would have been better off making the recipe that calls for heavy cream. I think it would have been really good if made with the heavy cream. With that said, making the soup was easy and it looked good.

Really tasty. My first time cooking with delicata.. was a bit difficult to find. If you don't care for nutmeg, leave it out.. tastes great with or without it. I liked this soup hot and cold

I used good quality olive oil, used chopped fresh sage instead of nutmeg and added only 2-3 tablespoonfuls of Strauss whole milk yogurt. Used my immersion blender.
It's a nice and light soup.
