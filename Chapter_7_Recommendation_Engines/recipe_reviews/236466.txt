I used this recipe for the sauce in my Chicago Pizza Bowl .  The only thing I changed was I added 1/3 cup of a dry red wine (like a Cabernet Sauvignon)after the first hour of simmering.
It was a hit!

DELICIOUS! I did not use the zucchini or the tomato paste, as I felt it was thick enough. Oh, and I wasn't sure what an 'Italian sweet pepper' was (maybe a banana pepper?), so I just used some red pepper, and that was fine. Great flavor, hearty and absolutely yummy. This was a HUGE hit with the whole family...A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)
