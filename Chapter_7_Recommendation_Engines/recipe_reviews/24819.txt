Made for a Hawaiian dinner party. I used a bag of shredded cabbage because it seems to be dryer and better for coleslaw. The bag was a bit more than 4 cups. It was really good. The flavour was quite different! I loved it! The only change I made was to omit the salt. I almost never add salt. Next time I won't toss the cabbage with the liquid from the oranges, I'll mix it (and the seasonings) with the mayo. And I would only use 2 Tbsp of mayo. Also, add the oranges last so you don't crush them when you stir.

I made this for a "luau" at my son's school.  It was a great hit!  I loved it, too.  I wanted to pass on how I presented it.  I cut a pineapple down the middle lengthwise (I used my electric knife, which made it sooo easy.)  I cut out the insides to make a pineapple boat. I then filled the two halves with the coleslaw.  It was so great that I am going to do it again this weekend.  Oh, yeah, I used a bag of shredded slaw mix instead of shredding my own.  Made it very easy.

This was a good side dish for our Hawaiian theme party.  I don't think it is necessary to put in the salt or at least half the salt amount.  It also helps if you dry the cabbage well. If not there seems to be a lot of liquid at the bottom of the dish.

Loved this! I agree with adding the juice to the mayo. I added roasted peanuts, also, at the end. Served with a fruited pork loin roast, and rice. Everyone loved it!

This is a fantastic salad.  I made this as part of a Hawaiian menu for a luau-style birthday party.  It was fresh, sweet and colorful and everyone loved it.

This is a sweet slaw.  It is flavorful and good.  I'm not a big coleslaw person, but I will have to make this again sometime.  I HIGHLY recommend it.

Made this for my 30th birthday party and this went along great with the Luau theme.  I like a good bit of dressing in my coleslaw so that everything is nicely coated, so I upped the amount of mayo to 1 cup, which was the amount used in another similar recipe - 1/3 cup just didn't seem like hardly any for 4 cups of cabbage!

I did not have any white pepper so I left that out, and I may or may not have omitted the nutmeg.  Overall, it was pretty good, but I felt like it needed more ginger and perhaps a bit of sugar.  I would make this again, but play around with the measurements to make it more flavorful.

This was a nice variation of the original.  I will make it again for themed parties.  It didn't taste nearly as good the next day, so only make what you need.

This was OK but nothing really special.  I made it for my daughter's Hawaiian-themed birthday party.  People ate it, but no one went back for seconds or made comments about it which isn't a sign of approval from our family.

We enjoyed this refreshing take on coleslaw! I used a bagged coleslaw mix, cut the nutmeg back to just a pinch (I know how overpowering nutmeg can be), used 2 Tbsps. of mandarin orange liquid and added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the dressing mix, which I mixed all up before adding the slaw and finally the pineapple and oranges. This really does need the time in the fridge for all the flavors to marry. I would make this again! Thanks for sahring. :)

I'm not really a big fan of cole slaw in general so the addition of these extras (mandarin oranges, pineapple, ginger, and nutmeg) sounded like a good version that was perfect for a luau themed pot luck coming up. However I must really be used to the taste of ginger and nutmeg because I could barely taste either one! But overall it was a good version of cole slaw that disappeared quickly and I would definitely make it again. The oranges and pineapple are really what makes it special. I used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw mix, which I highly recommend doing, unless you enjoy the act of shredding cabbage. I also added about a tablespoon more mayo than the recipe calls for since it seemed a tad lacking when I mixed it up at first. Next time I'll use a touch more ginger and nutmeg too.

I was hesitant to use this b/c most of my family is very set in their ways.  My hubby even cringed and couldn't believe I would mess with a good thing.  but I did it anyway and I received more compliments on this.  I followed the recipe exact for using the bagged slaw mix.  Mine wasn't soupy at all.  Thanks for sharing it.

Made this to go with the Kalua pig in a slow cooker recipe. It was so awesome! Unfortunately we went grocery shopping during super bowl and all the prepackaged cole slaw mixes were gone, so I had to use broccoli slaw. Still amazing! Other than (unfortunately) the main ingredient, followed the recipe exactly.
**** After making this more times than I can count and with actual coleslaw mix, I prefer skipping the reserved juice (there's more than enough liquid) and adding a small can of pineapple tidbits. I also like to use a little extra of the spices, but not extra salt.

I had to make too many changes to warrant more than 3 stars. If I make this again, I will decrease the ginger and nutmeg as the flavor was overpowering. I added a little white wine vinegar to offset the sweetness of the mandarin oranges and pineapple. I also added a little more mayo because I like creamy coleslaw. Overall, I didn't like this much...

Out of the group of about 15 I served this to, only one person really liked this recipe. Something about the flavor just wasn't right. It was easy to make but we just didn't love it.

This recipe was an unexpected hit.  Even folks who aren't normally huge fans of coleslaw loved this and went back for seconds.  I served this with the Kalua Pig in a Slower Cooker recipe from this site, and some fresh fruit and it made for a easy, delicious summer meal.

I prepared this a little differently but used all the ingredients.  Used fresh mandarin orange sections and soaked them for a few hours with the pineapple, salt/pepper, ginger (used a little less of this than recipe called for because I am not a huge fan of ginger) and nutmeg.  One hour before serving I mixed this with the cabbage and mayonnaise and chilled until ready to serve.  Very tasty!!  A hit at our luau dinner.  Thanks ChristyJ for flavorful recipe!

Very nice and refreshing. I left out the nutmeg and added a dash of cinnamon in it's place and used fat free mayo.  I also added some shredded carrots and some purple cabbage.  It was a very colorful salad and would absolutely make again.

I used slightly less nutmeg & mayo and used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of shredding my own. Skipped the salt. I didn't have crushed pineapple, just rings, so I chopped them up. I did as other said to add everything (spices & juice) to the mayo first then mixing it all up. It got mixed reviews... A little too sweet and spice-y. I didn't try any, but overall won't make this again as it doesn't suit our tastes. Made as a side to 'Aloha Chicken Burgers' from AR.

It was very good. I served it in a pineapple boat(as someone else suggested) and for our luau it was a great addition.

I hate to give yet another bad review, but the nutmeg was overpowering in this and the taste was nothing special. My husband wouldn't even eat it after taking one bite and I did make it according to directions.  I think members are confused about the rating system here.  If you have ever been to a 5 star restaurant and food was great, well that's 5 stars.

I made this for a Hawaiian themed scrapbooking workshop and all the ladies really enjoyed the fruity flavor.  It is a really nice twist to the standard slaw.

I made this dish with the "Hawaiian Spareribs" (on this site) for a party. Like many have said, it gets pretty soggy after a little time.  But the flavor is great - especially for one who doesn't like "traditional" coleslaw (namely me).

I made this to take to a Luau  and  sadly, it didn't go over very well.  I brought 90% of it home. It tasted very bland to me when I tasted it. Not sure what I could have done to improve it.

I had high hopes for this but it wasn't very fruity. I'd recommend draining your pineapple really well. It was runny.

I only rate it three stars because I must have done something wrong. It didn't taste like the ingredients that went into it. I know that sounds funny, that's why I'm going to try to make it again.

I thought it to be delicious but a bit runny. I probably should have used less pineapple juices and more mayo.

I made the recipe but added shredded carrots and used half mayo and half plain Greek yogurt. This was a very good coleslaw dish, different from the norm and very flavorful. Even without my tweaks, this is a great dish if you're looking for a more exciting cole slaw recipe.

This is a great recipe for coleslaw.  It was a little sweet so it is better as a dessert than a side dish.  But a definite 5 star for me.  :)

Everyone loved it!  The only thing different I would do next time is to use pineapple pieces instead of crushed pineapple.  Even though I strained all of the juice out, it was still too soggy.  But over all, it was excellent!

This was an awesome recipe!  I made it for a slaw to serve with the pulled pork I made. I ended up adding a seeded diced jalapeno because I served it with the pork. It went very well. I have also made it without the jalapeno.

Made this exactly according to the recipe except I added some extra chopped up pineapple. Ended up adding some extra coleslaw dressing from another recipe. It was ok but not something I would make again. Thanks for the recipe though!!!

Very good recipe.  I used bagged slaw mix, and I thought I had mandarins oranges in my pantry and it turned out I didn't, so I added some dried cranberries and pineapple juice instead of the mandarin juice.  Still delicious.  I will make sure I have the oranges next time!

I made it for a dinner party. The guests all liked it, but I thought it was a little bland. I did sprinkle on a few sunflower seeds and some dried berries which helped a little, but I probably won't make it again.

I made this for a party we gave for a friend moving to Hawaii, it was dee-lish.  Instead of canned crushed pineapple, I used the fresh pineapple pulp I crushed in scooping it out of a ripe pineapple, and then served the slaw in the two empty halves of the fruit.  It was a beautiful presentation.  I'm going to repeat it for another Hawaiian themed party this weekend, but will have to triple the recipe for a bigger crowd.  I also used pre-shredded slaw instead of cutting up my own cabbage, everything else was by the book.  Easy and yummy, what more can you ask for?

I've made this twice for large gatherings, served it in 1/2 pineapple.  It was a huge hit.  I love the unusual (but not too weird) flavor.  It's easy to make, but much better than the normal, expected cole slaw.

I made this for a Hawaiian party.  It was pretty good and served it's purpose.  It is not "to die for" but I would make it again.

This was really... weird. I had a good-sized head of cabbage, so I decided to try two different types of coleslaw to try to convince my husband that not all coleslaw is evil. This would not have convinced him had he given it a try. It had a really weird taste. Sort of like the idea of a savory candy, it just didn't do anything for me. My three-year old picked out the fruit and enjoyed that. Thanks for sharing, Christine, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. :)

I made this for a Hawaiian Luau last month and it was a big hit.  It was easy to make but I made 50 servings, so it was difficult finding large enough bowls to mix it in.  I will make it again.  It is not good for leftovers due to amount of liquid it makes once it sits in the frig.
