A few tips for those of you struggling with the recipe:

1. While the directions were written for Tuna, it does work well with other fish but the cook time must be adjusted accordingly for the type of fish you are using and the thickness. For salmon I would recommend ditching the garlic -lime marinade, it really is specific to tuna or a similar fish. 

2. For those struggling with the heat there are three things:
- The recipe is designed to be eaten bite for bite with the mango salsa recipe included, if you serve it without it you'll likely need to adjust the heat level by dropping the cayenne.
- For those who just aren't into the heat, you can simply reduce the amount of cayenne, by half is about appropriate. 
- A nice alternative I've found to the mango salsa is sour cream (about 2tbsp per serving) mixed with a bit of sugar (about 1tsp per 2tbsp of sour cream). This can be served in a ramekin or drizzled over the fish, whatever your heart desires!

Hope this allays some of the issues people have had! :)

WOW! I've been wanting to make Ahi tuna and came across this recipe. I can't believe how good this was! My husband said it was better than some of the ahi tuna we've had in restaurants! I did make just a couple of changes: 1-I added avocado to the mango salsa. Just thought it would taste good. It did! 2-After marinating the tuna, I only seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. 3-I coated the tuna steaks with black and white sesame seeds. 4-I like my tuna very rare, so I only cooked each side until it was opaque in color. But when you sliced the fish, the bright red color showed thru. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks so much!

This is on the spicy side. It is excellent. We had a dinner party half of the group did not like spicy so when I made the rub I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and I had to double up on the other dry rub ingredients. I also made to separate Mango Salsa one with jalape√±o the other without. The result the non spicy people enjoyed except for one. I will definitely make this again.

I have to preface my review by revealing that I didn't do this with tuna.  Tuna is best served rare to medium-rare and I don't/can't do "raw," plain and simple. So I used tilapia, which is perfect for blackening because the filets are so thin. (Truth be told, however, I'm not crazy about tilapia either - it tastes muddy to me, like a bottom feeder) Mango salsa is relatively new to me - I have never liked sweet mixed with savory. But I'm liking it lately, and this salsa, this dish,  was simply first rate. I used my own blackening seasoning, one that is tried and true for me, important since blackening/Cajun seasonings can vary so much.  I made no changes to the salsa and it was perfect - as good as I've had at any fine seafood restaurant in SW Florida. I am finding, however, that the jalapenos from my garden have a LOT more heat in them than those I buy at the grocery store so beware if you use homegrown! I served this with "Cilantro-Lime Rice," also from this site, and they belonged together. This was a beautiful and delicious dish, nice for the two of us, but certainly company worthy as well. Nicely done!

Holy Moly. This is awesome!!  I didn`t have all the ingrediants, but still made it work. I had no limes, subbed for Nakeds Mango drink. It worked out awesome! Had no mangoes, subbed those for mandarin oranges and strawberries in the salad. It would work well with pineapple and coconut shreds as well. Delish.  I made the marinade and spice mix as directed (1/2 salt). I also halved the oil to make it thick like a blackened fish. I was making this for two steaks ;P  Hubby is from India and loves spice. For the kids and I, I used the sour cream idea. But, made it like a raita with tomatoes and onions plus the sugar. It took away the heat.  On the side I served a salad with a mango vinegrette, madarin oranges and feta cheese. AWESOME!

Tasty, but WAY too spicy. I love, love, love spicy but I've made this 2x...the 2nd time I cut the paprika and pepper in 1/2...just insanely too hot.

My family loves fresh tuna but we don't get it very often. This was a very tasty way to prepare fresh tuna. The salsa was zippy and went well with the tuna. The whole family really enjoyed this. Make sure to use a flipper to flip your fish in the pan rather than tongs so it doesn't fall apart. Thanks for a great recipe!

My fiance requested that I make tuna steaks, and I was a little nervous about it because the steaks were so thick. It came out great, though! I mixed the marinade together, placed the tuna steaks in a storage container, poured the marinade over the tuna steaks, and placed it in the refrigerator for less than an hour. The salsa was easy to put together. When it came time to blacken the tuna steaks, I soaked them in the spice mixture and then cooked them on each side for about six minutes on each side. There was still a nice pink in the middle. This recipe is a winner!

Excellent! Next time I would reduce the amount of all the spices as I had a lot left over and they are expensive to buy. I will also reduce the amount of onion in the salsa and use 1/3 of an onion and 1/2 of the jalapeno. I didn't have a mango so I used some peach mango salsa and it was fantastic that way. Thanks for a great fish recipe!

I love this recipe! After it went over so well the first time, I started using this blackening spice mixture on everything from shrimp, to chicken, to swordfish steaks. I mixed up all the spices and keep in my cabinet so it is handy!

As IF this recipe needs another 5 star review!!!  LOL!  This is a fabulous recipe.  The tuna marinade is what sets this apart from other fish/salsa style dishes.  Most recipes never recommend a marinade for fish- a rub, yes but not a marinade.  This made the difference for me and I marinated for 3 hours.  For other reviewers who complained about too much of something-- use less of it?.  Also, OBVIOUSLY cook the tuna the way YOU like it cooked.  The chef who made mine tonight (ME) used way too much jalapeno.  But heck that is my fault.  This recipe ROCKS!  My hubby LOVED the blackened, this WILL be my new seasoning for blackened always.  I served this with a citrus scented quinoa.  YUM!  Thank you for this recipe.

My husband said this is one of the top 3 meals that I have ever made him.  The salsa is delicious and I served it with an asparagus recipe from this site that has butter, soy and balsamic dressing on it.

Tastes great on the grill!!!!! If you do decide to grill, take the1 1/2 tsp olive oil that should go in the pan and mix into the dry rub-it will spread over the fish and stick to it better. This is one of my favorite recipes ever!

The mango salsa was fantastic with the spicy tuna.  My husband (the picky eater) loved it, said it was a restaurant-quality "gourmet" dinner.  Can't wait to make again.  I only made 2 tuna steaks, but kept the full recipe amount for the salsa and we ate every bit of it!!

The rub is fantastic! My husband loves off-the-scale hot food and actually didn't add pepper flakes to this dish! He said it was perfect. I can handle pretty hot food, but this was a bit too close to my limit. I will probably cut down on the cayenne a little next time and let my husband add some pepper flakes to his! The salsa is wonderful!! The mango/cilantro combined with the rub was a very happy marriage. My only critique (and the reason I am giving this four stars) is that I found 3 mins on each side was far too long to cook the (2 inch) tuna steaks. The resulting steak was grey and dry with only a hint of pale pink in the centre. It was my first time cooking Ahi Tuna, so I followed the recommended time closely. Next time I will cut the cooking time down significantly. The rub blackened properly way before the 3 mins, so the shorter cooking time wouldn't affect the great blackened appearance/taste. I will be making this again, and would use this rub and the salsa for other dishes. Both would be great with chicken and shrimp too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok, had to rate this recipe when my husband told me this was the best meal I had ever made for him(we've been married 20 years) Then I almost fell in the floor when my 3 incredibly picky children ate every bite and asked for more. It was delicious and nutritious!

Absolutely outstanding. It made my fiance, an avid non-lover of seafood, a fan. Excellent combination of spices. The salsa was also outstanding; I added a tiny bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the mango. All in all, one of the best recipes I have gotten off this site. :)

Made this for Hubby's birthday dinner - it was fabulous - everyone was blown away by by the presentation (so colorful) but more so by the incredible flavors - lime, cilantro, mango YUM! The only reason I don't make this more often is concern over mercury in Tuna : (

This was delicious.  I personally would have liked the mango salsa to be a bit more mango-y and a little less cilantro-y, which I will do next time.  Personally, I might have given it four stars, but I'm going with five because my husband said it was one of the most delicious meals he's ever had, which is definitely saying something for him!  I loved the marinade and the blackened seasoning.  Very nice and easy presentation, too!

This recipes was perfect! I had never cooked tuna steaks before, and had never blackened anything before. This was such an easy recipe, as long as you allow for 3 hrs marinating time. My husband and I both loved it and I can't wait to make it again. I made it just the way the recipe calls for, except i didn't have onion powder, so i just used a little extra garlic powder. I also used frozen tuna steaks, which I was a bit skeptical about-but it turned out fabulous!!

I used half the cayenne as we are not "high heat" lovers.  We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again and again.  Thank you for sharing it.

Amazing!  This is the best thing I have ever done to fish.  Even just the marinade would be perfect for a less spicy dish.

Very easy and very good, even my wife who hates fish said she enjoyed this, "it didn't taste fishy."  I used three frozen 6 oz. Mahi Mahi steaks and instead of making the mango salsa I used a jar of peach salsa.  I halved the cayenne and could only barely taste it so those who want the fish to have a little kick may want to go 3/4 or the full tablespoon of cayenne.  I also have at least my rub left over.  Cooking time guidance was right on.

Huge hit.  Omitted the jalepeno pepper as I can't stand hot things.  My 4yr old kept asking for more.

We reduced the heat, and made a few other alterations to the spices.  We always add sugar to our rubs.  With our rub recipe I would give it 5 stars.  With the heat, I would have never been able to eat it.  We left it just a bit raw in the center.  It was amazing!  I could not believe that all of our children loved it.  We also love the yogurt topping from a fish taco recipe by Breese823.  The combination of the Mango Salsa and the Yogurt Sauce is to be savored!  We tried this recipe with Black-tip shark and it was too salty; the only changed we made was reducing the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.

Phenomenal, restaurant quality dish.  For the salsa, I used a couple tablespoons red onion in place of the green and white onion and added half an avocado (would highly recommend!).  We only seared the tuna for about 2 - 2 1/2 minutes per side.

This was great! I did 1/2 the cayenne pepper, and broiled the fish rather than pan-frying it, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. I have also done it (on a separate occasion) with ilapia because the store didn't have any good tuna and it was delicious as well! Big crowd pleaser!

This an AMAZING tasting and EASY recipe! Great for the summer time and goes well with just a neutral white rice to help absorb some of the heat.

We usually go a little lighter on the blackening spices for less heat. But pretty much a regular dish in our house now! Amazing!

This blackened/cajun spice mixture is delicious and goes with nearly every kind of meat and fish. I use it a lot on grilled chicken and it's amazing. I have never made the mango salsa before but I imagine it's excellent as well. I keep a small container of this spice mixture on hand at all times because I use it so often. I like to use 1 Tbsp Chili Powder and 1 Tbsp Paprika instead of 2 Tbsp Paprika.

This was very good.  I followed the spice recipe exact and it was spicy but delicious. Instead of the mango salsa I made a garlic aoli from this site and it also went great with the tuna. Next time I make this I will definitely cut the cayanne in half though. But the flavors are great.

I made this recipe for a group of 5 friends.  It turned out INCREDIBLE!!!  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  It is the perfect balance of flavors, spicy and sweet.  The tuna can be cooked very rare or well done (cook at hotter temp and shorter time for very rare and blackened/crisp outside!).  Delicious, I plan to share this recipe with many friends!

Great presentation and terrific tasting dish. I had a mango but it turned out to be texturally challenged so I subbed a nice nectarine. Delish!

I have made this so many times using different fish as well as tuna.  This is also my go-to mango salsa recipe even if I don't blacken the fish and/or serve the salsa with another meat.  We love it!  Thank you for sharing.

I cheated I used a bottle of apricot Mango chipotle.  Did everything else the same.  Lot's less work and expense for me.  I sliced some fresh avacados coz there in season.  Was a fancy looking dish and looked like I spent a lot of time in the kitchen.  Healthy too!!

My cousins sent me some of the fresh tuna they caught in Mexico.   Wanted to find a new way to prepare them with my new found bounty.   Absolutly the best I have ever made.    Never will make it any other way.   TRY THIS!!!!   You will not regret it.   Adjust the heat level to what works for you.  Have used many recipes from this site, just never B4 sent a comment.  OH did I say TRY THIS?   Yep, I did,
 but worth repeating.

This was wonderful.  I did change the recipe a bit so that it wouldn't be too spicy.  I used half of a jalapeno, and I used ancho chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.  The kids were a raving fan and loved it, too.

Loved this!
I've been making it for 2 years and have made several quality/speed enhancements:
1) Much better with sushi grade ahi or yellow tail if you can splurge.  (available at many Japanese/Chinese grocers)
2) Love with avocado added to the mango salsa
3) Easier if you  buy pre-mixed spices for the blackening (e.g., Mrs Dash's Southwest Chipolte)
4) Nice with flour tortillas for fish tacos as alternative to rice
Enjoy!

This recipe was amazing!  I cut the cayenne to 1 teaspoon and next time I will use less salt.  I also made a topping of sour creme, fresh lime and cilantro to finish it off.  The pan frying technique worked perfectly.  The steaks were slightly pink in the center - just right!

this recipe was really good. to offset the overall spicyness of the fish, I added a little blue agave sweetener to the salsa (I also upped the lime juice, mostly because I like limes). I also basted the fish with a little more blue agave & fresh lime juice. The fish is really complemented well by the mango salsa (so should definitely be eaten together!)

The mixture of flavors was amazing.  The sweet of the mango and heat of the peppers with the blackened tuna went together well.  This recipe is one I will definitely make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe! When I make this again I will probably use less red pepper for myself, but my husband loved the heat of this recipe.

Delicious although a bit spicy for our taste. Next time I will cut back the cayenne some. This time we just chipped off the blackened spice rub.   Did not do the blackened tuna but instead stole the carmelized onions from a different tuna recipe. Mixed 2.5 medium onions, half a head of cabbage, and 2 banana peppers and sauteed them for like 40 minutes in a bit of butter with a dash of salt and sugar.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was 1/2 the cayenne and 1/2 the jalapeno.  It was still spicy.  My husband said it was one of the best meals I ever made and that's huge compliment from him.  I'll be making this one often.

This recipe was simple and amazingly delicious! I never made salsa before and it was the best I ever had. Recipe rivals higher level restaurants. Husband who is not a "fish lover" flipped. Cannot wait to make it again. Great job AcadiaBoi!

This recipe is amazing!  The tuna comes out, depending on thickness, with a red center and a crisp outside.  Yum!  The mango salsa is delicious.  I used only salt and pepper on one of the tuna steaks for my 6 year old daughter and she devoured it!  I think it had more to do with the salsa, honestly, she loved the fruit ( I added a small amount of pineapple and strawberry, mmmm...)   This recipe will be used again and again in our house.   THanks!

This was an excellent dish. The mango salsa was a perfect complement to the tuna. My husband and I love hot/spicy food but the heat was a little intense for us in this recipe. Next time I will cut down on the cayenne a bit.

The salsa really makes this dish wonderful!  I am allergic to mangoes so I used pineapple instead and it was great!  Hubby loved it too - said 'make this again!'  And I will.

WOW! This recipe is amazing! The fish is so full of flavour, and its spiciness is very well-balanced by the fresh mango salsa - not to mention that it is easy, and presentation rocks! We had it with "white and wild rice pilaf" from this site also. Thank you for a definite keeper!

I made this recipe with only 2 changes. I omitted the bell pepper in the salsa and broiled the fish instead of pan frying. This was a great meal and will be a regular in my house. I served it with sliced kiwi, apricots and green and wax beans. Beautiful looking plate with all the flavor I was looking for. It is VERY spicy but thats what we like.

The spice on the tuna was great, I would flip after 2 mins per side however the mango salsa was weak, maybe strawberries and/or fresh mint leaves might help....get back to you. Cheers

I love this recipe. Followed the instructions. I tweaked the seasoning for tuna, cooked a little longer. The salsa was amazing; added diced tomatoes.  It was a lovely experience making this dish and it taste so delicious!

DELICIOUS! We like our tuna on the rare side so only seared for about 2 minutes. We also sauteed the mango salsa for a couple minutes before serving. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Great combination of flavors. I really enjoyed the mango salsa (though I did omit the cilantro because I find it tastes like soap). I also followed one users suggestion and halved the amount of cayenne so it wouldn't be too spicy.

YUM.  Bold tastes.  Tasting the salsa by itself, I thought the onion was overwhelming.  With the tuna, though, it tasted great.  The tuna seasoning was spicy and bold; it left one of the best after tastes I've ever had.  The cooking time also felt perfect.

Bought some Ahi Tuna at my Farmers Market which was on sale and I found this recipe and when for it! I follow exactly, expect the mango salsa. Tuna was so tender and divine! The mango salsa was very good but was missing something, maybe salt and I add a peach since I just at 3/4 of the mango. I will do this again for sure!!!

This is my go-to "look like a professional chef" recipe! Not only is it probably one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, but the presentation is so beautiful. I make the "blackened" part pretty spicy, but it's easy to tone down - especially when I'm scarfing it down while my husband is sweating and sniffing from the heat! ;) One of the best recipes I've found on this site!!!

The thing I love so much about this website is getting ideas and customizing them to fit your needs. I did marinate the tuna for 3 hours, but rather than make mango salsa I purchased it from Giant. I also used a pre-made Cajun blackening spice, but boy did this come out great! I realize it may have been even better with the homemade salsa and rub!

I didn't make the salsa at all and didn't have basil used chili powder instead of the paprika & cayenne and holy yum, this was good! Oh, I also forgot to rinse off the marinade before cooking, but I really loved the lime flavor so I think that was a good thing for me. My husband loved this as well. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Made this exactly as per the recipe though I marinated only for about an hour due to lack of time.  This was terrific.  Definitely will make again. Might try it with chicken, too.

So very good! I was too lazy to do the salsa myself and not a huge fan of mango, so a little pico de gallo and pineapple to the rescue. Good thing too - we needed that sweetness to cut down on the spicy from the tuna. Warning: you will breath in cayan fumes!

trying to venture out into the world of seafood preparation (I am not a huge fan). This was fantastic!!!  I did have slightly longer cooking times, and I sauted the salsa mix as I am not a fan of raw onions.  I also skipped the jalepano and just used hot salsa in it's place. Frozen mango made prep time a little easier too.  Sure to repeat this one

This was amazing. Even my teenage boys ate it and asked for more. It is spicy so if you want a milder version, ditch the cayanne and use hungarian paparika...

This was a fabulous recipe. I do like my tuna a little more done than this recipe said to cook. I just placed mine in the oven for approx 18 mins,on 350 after pan frying it as recipe said to do and it was great. I didn,t change any items out. It was perfect!!! Will make again.

I'm Russian and we do not eat this kind of things, so I didn't really care about it. But my hubby (american) said that he hasn't had anything like that for 7 years (while he's not in US). he said it was AWESOME!!! he almost cried because it reminded him his friends :) plus he's not mango eater, so I was kinda worry that he won't like salsa, but he did!

now he's ordered same but chicken :)

Thank you for this great recipe and that you helped me making my hubby so happy :)

This was just as good as a restaurant dish.  I cut down on the Cayenne as suggested by others.  Next time I will cut down the cooking time, as I like mine still swimming.  Thanks for the help.

Just finished (seriously-dishes still sitting on the table).  CRAZY good!!  New favorite-hands down. It is spicy-which is great for me since I always add extra spice.  This was perfect! Only change-added some pineapple in w/mango.  Thought is would be a good combo and it worked beautifully.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  One of the best !

excellent mango salsa. Didn't use the jalapeno this time, but a little garlic instead of the green onion. Also some chopped nectarine. Very similar to a fancy restaurant near here.

I'm not sure if we messed up in some way, but my boyfriend and I really didn't like the flavor. Way too much cayenne flavor. I love spicy food, but I couldn't even finish my steak. Perhaps we didn't blacken it enough... though, our tuna seemed overdone. Not sure where we went wrong. Either way, did not care for the flavor.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I reduced the spice of the cayenne to 1 teaspoon- which was spicy enough and we like it spicy.  This is so good restaurant quality for sure.  I loved the sweetness of the mango with the savory tuna.  The cooking time was perfect for a rare center.  The only thing I'll do different next time is not cook it in my non stick skillet.  I didn't get a good blackened sear.  Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this again.

A lot of work, but this recipe is definitely worth it.  I cut down on the cayenne and it was still spicy. Used yellowfin ahi tuna steaks. Cooked exactly 3 minutes per side, which was perfect.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I's anniversary dinner and we both loved it.  Here are a few adjustments that I did:    1. I used both a tuna steak and a tuna medallion.  They were both probably about an inch thick so they had to cook much longer than the suggested time in the recipe.    2. I used more lime juice and less garlic and olive oil in the marinade.    3. Spices are expensive and you often only use them once or twice so instead of going out and buying the ones I didn't have I just made due with what was in my cabinent (I only used salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and thyme)...the rub was still AMAZING.    4. Also, to make the mango salsa requires pricey produce and believe it or not, most grocery stores will carry pre-made mango salsa so I bought that instead!    5. I recommend rice as a side dish. It goes really well the grill taste of the tuna as well as the sweetness of the salsa.    Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I halved the recipe since there was 2 of us.    While making the salsa I got concerned with the amount of onion and jalapeno in the mix (it smelled very onion-y) so I cut the amounts back a little bit and it was still quite tasty.    The steaks were easy to do. We liked the heat it had.  Was very pleased at how this turned out and will definitely make again.

What a great blackened tuna recipe.  We marinated the tuna.  Some of our diners do not like hot spices and so we cooked one steak with marinade only.  We rubbed the rest with the spicy oil based paste.  We charcoal grilled/smoked the tuna on a cedar plank instead of searing in a pan.    The tuna without the rub was also very good, so try the marinade and salsa without the Cajun rub if you do not like spicy foods. We will certainly use this simple marinade for other seafood, like salmon.   Unfortunately we did not have the makings for the mango salsa (too bad).  Will make the salsa the next time without the spicy rub just to try another variation.

WOW!  This was amazing!  It looked and tasted like a restaurant meal.  The whole family loved it.  It was a beautiful day out so we grilled the tuna (6 minutes on each side on med-high).

Excellent dish.  I used 'Hot Hungarian Paprika' instead of cayenne pepper, and it was plenty hot.  The only other deviations from the recipe I made was using a large shallot instead of a spanish onion in the salsa (only because I didn't have an onion on hand and needed to use up my shallot), and I added a splash of fresh-sqeezed grapefruit juice and lime zest to the salsa because my lime didn't have much juice.  Great and fairly simple dish.

Fantastic!  My husband LOVED this (and he hardly ever loves anything I cook).  He thought it was better than eating at a restaurant.  I omitted all of the onions from the salsa b/c I'm not an onion fan, and I added 1/2 an avocado.  I will make this next time we have guests!

Fantastic recipe! Serve this at a dinner party to impress your friends. A bit of a flavor blast though, so I would recommend serving something a little more "tame" with this dish.

Fantastic.  I have to admit I did cut down on the red pepper for milder tastes in our house and I purchased mango chutney from the Indian food section of our grocery but the Tuna and rub are really wonderful and cooked perfectly at 3 minutes per side.  Not over cooked nor too rare.

Excellent! The spices are just right- not too hot and definitely not bland. The mango salsa is really good too! Will be making this again.  I cooked my tuna to 140 degrees, which is considered overcooked by most but was perfect for me. Still a light pink in the very center but mostly gray.

I must admit I was leary about using frozen fish but that was the only choice I had.  The tuna taste surpased my expectations.  The recipe is easy to follow and makes for a truly spectacular feast.  Chopping the salsa is a bit time consuming, so next time I may use a food processor.  Other than that, fantastic recipe. Thank you so much for submitting it!

I followed the recipe exactly, and could not have been more pleased with the results.  The rub for the tuna and the salsa had the perfect amount of heat, and the mango made for a terrific and interesting contrast.  This dish had so much flavor that we kept the sides very simple - steamed broccoli and brown rice...what a delicious meal!

This was delicious but I would make a few changes if I decided to make it again. The salsa was very heavily flavored like cilantro, which I don't care for, even though I added a fresh minced habanero because we love spicy food. So I would cut that in half unless you're a big cilantro fan. Also, depending on the thickness of your tuna steaks, a 3 minute saute time might not be a good idea. I had 1 and 1/4 inch steaks I would estimate and they were definitely on the medium well side after the three minutes on one side and a minute on the other. I prefer my fish midrare to medium, if of good quality of course, so next time I will cut that long saute time in half (doing 90 seconds per). That being said, the dish was a huge hit with my fiance and we made chicken on the grill outside later in the week and topped it with the leftover salsa, greatly impressing our other guests.

Turned out great.  The only changed I made was that I used a regular onion instead on Spanish and that I cooked the steaks a minute longer on each side bc I do not like my tuna so pink.  I served with citrus rice and my husband was really impressed!

Yum! Such a delicious blackened tuna recipe! Very spicy- will probably reduce the cayenne next time- we love spice, but with the mango salsa with jalepeno, it got to be a little much. I would add a dollop of sour cream next time, to cut the spice a bit but not sacrifice the flavor. New favorite blackening recipe! Thanks!

We LOVE this recipe and have done it twice, so far!  Second time my husband grilled tuna- even better! I added a roasted chopped hatch chili (mild) to the salsa 'cause they are in season,(we in Texas).  Served with couscous.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  Husband was very impressed as I had never attempted tuna steaks before and they came out great.  They steaks came out med-rare which was perfect for us.  There was just enough salsa for the two of us, so if making for more than two, I would double the salsa.  Next time I will reduce the spice mixture as I threw a lot away.

This is my all-time favorite recipe.  First of all, the seasoning is AMAZING.  I use this every time I sear tuna.  Second of all, the salsa is AMAZING and a perfect compliment to the tuna.  If you buy store bought mango salsa, you are missing out.  DOUBLE the salsa because you will want extra.  Third of all, 3 minutes on each side will make two inch thick tuna come out medium.  I cook my sushi-grade tuna for one and a half minutes on each side.  I usually serve this with corn and rice.  Love it!

Wow.  What a healthy alternative.  I used store-bought mango salso from a fabulous grocery store called Stew Leonards here in the CT/NY area.  My husbands hates Mango, so I made a buerre blanc sauce for him to dip into instead, and that countered the spicy seasoning very well.  I only marinated for about 1 hr, and used slightly less cayenne pepper.  I sprinkled generously, and followed recipe exactly.  Warning - will cause a little smoke in the kitchen... open a window.  Otherwise, a divine recipe!  Will make every time tuna steaks go on sale!

I thought this was awesome! My wife loved it too. I will use a little less red pepper in the rub next time because my wife thought it was a little too spicy. I will also add another mango to the salsa to give it a little more sweetness and because it just tastes good!

This was fantastic. The only changes I made was no bell pepper in the salsa, personal preference, and using shark steaks instead of tuna because thats what I had on hand.

This was delicious! I didn't have time to make the mango salsa, so we just bought some in a jar and it turned out perfect. I can't wait to try it with my own salsa when I make this again, though.  The mix of spices for the tuna was great, I used a little less red pepper than the recipe called for and they still turned out really hot.  Overall, a great recipe!

I normally don't love tuna, but this recipe was really good!  I did change things a bit since I was short on time and missing a few of the ingredients.  Since I didn't have time to marinade the tuna for 3 hrs, I just mixed olive oil, paprika, cayenne, garlic salt, sesame seeds, 1/2 lime sqeezed, and poltry seasoning (basil, rosemary, sage, majoram,thyme, and oregano).  Mixed it all up and rubbed it into the tuna then threw it on the grill to cook.  For the salsa, I used canned mangos and crushed pineapple, diced red peppers, diced jalepenos and lime juice.  Overall it was awesome!

Excellent! I used frozen tuna and it tasted wonderful. Preparation was easy (I did cheat by using store-bought mango salsa, though). I thought it was just a bit too spicy, but my husband thought it was perfect. I'll be cooking this again, maybe with just a little less paprika and cayenne.

This took a little prep, but was well worth it. Of course you will have to like spicy food. I cut back a tad on the Cayenne and it was still plenty spicy. I'll use the leftovers for tacos tomorrow night with the salsa. I could practically eat the salsa with a spoon.
Addition: We had left-overs and made soft tacos...Delicious. We just reheated the meat, put it in a warm corn tortilla, added some of the salsa, grated cheese and a little lettuce from a leftover salad. What an easy dinner that was!

Wish I could give it more star, but this was just "OK" for me. Mango salsa didn't have a whole lot of flavor depth...I don't know, maybe needed honey and spices? even eating each bite of tuna with the salsa didn't really add too much. Will still be on the lookout for a good tuna steak recipe.

The spice blend needed to be tamed down on the cayenne for us (I only used 1 tsp. of it.) The mango salsa was good and made like many mango salsas. But if I make this again, I'd kick it up a notch with a different zestier dressing somehow. It'll take some experimenting to get there, but well worth it.

This recipe is AWESOME! I made the recipe as is and it was amazing. I was super nervous about cooking tuna for the first time and the four minutes per side was PERFECT. The only thing I did differently was (because of time restraints) I only marinated the fillets for about 30 min. I'm sure they'd be even better if I did the full three hours. Great way to impress your man! I don't particularly care for tuna so I did the same thing with a salmon fillet and loved it. Definitely one for the recipe books. Thanks!

I am not a fish eater, but it was suggested I try tuna steaks. This was my first time eating them and they were delish. Thank you for the recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because I halved the heat in the recipe and it was still a little too spicy.  The salsa is delish and paired nicely with the spiciness of the steaks. Thank you for giving me another option as I attempt to add more fish into my diet!

Make the salsa a few hours ahead of serving time, if possible, so that the salsa flavors meld.  

Next time i make this, the cooking time for the fish will be reduced to only a minute or so, with the skillet nice and hot, that will be plenty of time to sear, without cooking, the fish. 

I served with fried plantain and had a cool, delicious, satisfying meal.   Perfect for warm summer evening, wine, and good company.

This recipe was fantastic. It was better than the Ahi tuna we paid 29 dollars for at a fancy dinner. I followed the directions exactly and it came out great. Tips: It does get smoky, so air out your kitchen, Cut the mango really small, it makes a big difference.

This gets 5 stars for presentation (it was pretty) and 3.5 or 4 for flavor. The blackening seasoning was nice, but very similar to the Creole Seasoning Blend on this site. The Creole Seasoning is just a tad different, but I prefer that mixture. The mango salsa was alright, but it didn't blow me away. My husband seemed to enjoy it, though. I might make it again for him if he makes the request. I followed the recipe as written, except I skipped the cilantro because I don't like cilantro.

I grilled this for a barbecue and followed the recipe exactly.  I made sure to finely chop all of the salsa ingredients. My entire family loved it!  The mango was so good and offset the zing you get from the cayenne. Even the guests that weren't typically big seafood eaters went after this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

The blackening spice is excellent. I used about half the cayenne so it wasn't so spicy. I mix up the seasonings and keep it in my spice cupboard for salmon and other fish. Very good.

This recipe is SO GOOD!  Instead of using tuna I used boneless chicken breasts.  The flavors were wonderful and definitely not too spicy.  Even my ten year old picky son ate two pieces of chicken and asked for more!!!  Additionally, my husband who is not into fruit with meat, loved this particular salsa!  I served it with brown rice which my husband mixed the leftover rice and salsa together for a snack the next day!  YUM!!

Wonderful! I know I'm not a big fan of lime marinades or sweet sauces, so I marinated the tuna steak in olive oil and garlic briefly before following the rest of the recipe and then made guacamole to top it (from the top recipe on this site) and it was amazing. If you like spice without sweet, then make it this way. I will definitely make this again.

My husband, who never says WOW about any meals I make, LOVED this tuna. We used ahi tuna steaks from Costco. There were three of them and they were very thick.   I made the marinade with a little less garlic and let it sit for about 4 hours because we were out golfing. I used only a pinch of cayenne on one of the steaks because our kids aren't into spicy and left out the garlic powder.   Cooked on the grill for about 9 minutes each side (thick steaks and we wanted them a little more done). SOOO good. The kids ate one whole steak themselves and husband couldn't stop raving about how great it was. I made the salsa with pineapple instead of mango. Served with rice, veggies and a fruit salad. Great recipe!

HOT..HOT..HOT!!! I used 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper and the recipe was still HOT!!  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is FANTASTIC!!  You will LOVE this recipe.  I will make again with less cayenne.  Cooking for 3 minutes on each side made the tuna Medium Rare. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Really good! I overcooked the fish just a bit, but that was my fault. I used store bought mango chutney instead of making homemade mango salsa. I would definitely make this again and be more careful about how long I cooked the fish.

This was wonderful!  I made it even easier by using a jar of mango peach salsa I found at the store.  It was a quick and easy dinner - yet so very delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made as directed without changes and family loved it! I didn't marinate it as long as it called for, so I imagine it would be even better if I had waited the three hours for the tuna marinate and the 2 hours for the salsa marinate.

I substituted finely chopped apple for the mango and added 2 teaspoons of honey to the salsa. I like to make the spice rub ahead of time to save time. This has become a family favorite.

So yummy!!!!!  I also made a lime/cilantro rice (from a previous review) and it paired beautifully.  My fish was a bit over cooked, but still melt in your mouth awesome.  I left out the onion in the salsa (I don‚Äôt like raw onion) and the jalape√±o bit added extra pepper, mango, and an avocado.  I also didn‚Äôt use cayenne (kiddos).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite recipe for making fresh Ahi. Over time I have some short cuts. Instead of soaking the ahi in the olive oil for three hours, I chop garlic about 5 cloves and saut√© the garlic in frying skillet with olive oil. Then I place the coated ahi with the dry ingredients into skillet. I cook slightly on both sides of ahi. I make sure when flipping the ahi over and placing it back into into skillet it rests on the bed of garlic. When finished the garlic is crispy on the outside of ahi! Super delicious! It can be eaten with or without the salsa. I cut back on the amount of cayenne pepper. This recipe is a must try!!!!

Perfect combo. Easy, a lot of flavor and texture. It was so delicious it made me think it was bad for me. My only modification (due to lack of proper spices) was I substituted Chili pepper for Cyanine paper and I was out of Time (no pun intended) came out excellent.

This was great. My only issue was it way to spicey. I used 1 teaspoon of the Cayenne and it was still quite spicey.  We ended up scraping off the 'rub' and it was good.  Probably 1/2 tsp of the cayenne would have been better. But, great ingredients nonetheless

Wish we had followed the recipe exactly.  So many reviewers complained about how spicy the recipe was, so we cut back on the spices.   I'm rating this a five based on the wonderful salsa and what is most assuredly a perfectly spiced (if we'd followed the recipe!) fish.

Make extra salsa - It is delicious.  It would go perfectly with pork or chicken as well.  I didn't marinate as long as it called for - only an hour but it still tasted great.  I also cooked the tuna for a minute on each side - just enough to sear it all around instead of cooking only on one side.  It is a little spicy, but I added avocado slices on the side and that muted the spice just enough.  I will definitely make again.

I will reduce the paprika (or not use Hungarian) and the salt not time to allow the tuna flavor to shine. The mango salsa was a great balance.

SO easy and quick and delicious!  I was skeptical when I saw FIVE star review... I mean what has an all 5 star review... well this one deserves it!  We will be making this again and again.

I make this often because my family loves it!  The mango salsa is the best and so simple! Even without all the ingredients it‚Äôs the perfect balance to the spicy tuna!

Wow. I am not by any stretch a master chef, but boy did I feel like one when my husband and I were eating this! There was such great balance of flavor and texture and so much color. I had never made tuna steaks before so I followed directions exactly and it was perfect. Rare and tender. And what made it even better is that I did all my prep ahead of time so when it was time to cook dinner, it only took less than 10 minutes to cook and put it all on the plate. This goes down as one of my top 5 recipes of all time!

A winner. My Tuna was in the water about 24 hours before I cooked it. Easy to make, the blackening worked fine, I did cut back on the heat because other folks do not like spicy fish.

Third time to make this. I have added pineapple to the salsa and prefer it to mango alone.  I have also done just pineapple in a pinch.  It is good wth frozen steaks.  Just defrost them with paper towels around them overnight.

This is absolutely delicious.  The flavors are amazing and it is an easy recipe to follow.  We eat a large amount of spicy foods on a regular basis.  I even put cayenne pepper in my ketchup and dip fries into it.  That said, this dish was HOT!  So, you may need to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper you use.  However, don't let that deter you from this recipe.  We are going to use the spice mix for other things.  There was a lot of spice mix.  We divided it in half and dipped the fish in only half.  That way we have more for next time.

Will tweak a bit, but it was darn good as written.  I will try adding avocado to the salsa for sure and I'll make sure my husband knows to have the grill smoking when he cooks the fish as ours needed a better sear.  If you like ahi, this is a terrific recipe!

Delicious, just follow recipe as written. Easy enough for a weeknight dinner, and fine enough for company. I served with Basmati rice. The salsa was perfect, starts off seeming too hot, but let it rest a couple hours in refrigerator and it turns out fine, perfect amount of heat. I like mine cooked, so cooked for 4 mins on each side, but for anyone else would cook between 2-3 mins. on each side.

The next time I'd half the quantity of salt as it was a tad too salty for our taste. Otherwise, great recipe.

Unbelievably spicy even with the great mango salsa. I would cut the heat in half next time. I will try this again but not so much heat.

This recipe was amazing, next time though i'm going to buy some pre-made mango salsa, it was very time consuming to chop and dice all that stuff but came out absolutely delicious, and the tuna, wow the flavors in this recipe are incredible!  If you ever want to impress someone, make this dish!

Tried this the other day. Excellent flavor. The spice in the tuna was equally paired with the salsa. Will make again. My dad who likes spice and hates as he calls it "raw meat"said that this was delicious and had seconds.

WOW, this was awesome!! I do not know why anyone said this was too spicy. I thought it was perfect.  Than again I am from TX so I might be a little biased lol.  My kids were not impressed but this  isn't really a "kid dish"  My husband and I will be making this a lot more.  Thanks so much for posting this.

I made this for a guest and he LOVED it! He said it was hands down the best fish he has ever eaten. It came out perfectly, still pink in the center. Definitely recommend, you won't be disappointed!

Really good except I'd cut back on the Spanish onion in the mango salsa and maybe add an extra green onion instead.  Loved the spice and was pretty easy to make.  Not sure why they say to rinse after marinating other than maybe to get the garlic off so it won't burn when you sear it.

Fabulous! everyone was right! I made 2 tuna steaks, so I halved the spices. Cut down a little on the cayenne (1 tsp instead of 1 1/2) and it was just enough 'blackened' for us. served 1/2 the salsa underneath & 1/2 on top. Looked beautiful. We grilled them to avoid the smell in the kitchen.  Served with grilled romaine lettuce and crusty bread with olive oil dip on the side.  Perfect!

Oh my gosh...you have to try this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a great recipe.  We had people over and decided to serve these steaks.  I made just like the recipe says and I was VERY pleased with how my dinner party went.  Everyone loved the steaks with the mango salsa.  We even made a blacken chicken the next night and used the leftover salsa!  I will be making this many time again and will be sharing this recipe with all my friends!!!  VERY GOOD!!!

My husband loves this. It is too spicy for my Irish Taste Buds. I make my portion without the cayenne then add it before cooking my husbands.

I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp, and I used it on boneless skinless chicken breasts, this was plenty hot for my family and a real hit. I go to weight watchers and this really jazzed up the chicken. I have baked it and I have fried it, both equally yummy.

This was really good - five stars for the salsa, but the heat of the rub was a bit overwhelming for me, and I also think there was too much paprika for my taste.   Certainly something I can adjust to my preferences in the future, though!  Overall, a very nice healthy dish - I added some black beans to the salsa and they went beautifully - no other side dish was necessary.

The salsa was beautiful and flavorful. The tuna was perfect. Some of the family said the tuna was a little spicy but the mangos cooled it down a bit. Yummy I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I made the recipe as-is, except I used red onion and increased the cooking time because my steaks were very thick. I will definitely make this again.

I took a short-cut, as I didn't have much time for dinner that night.  I used store-bought mango chutney and topped with cilantro.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My husband really enjoyed this, so I will make again.

This recipe is great!  My husband and I loved it.  Just be careful of how spicy this gets...I used half the cayenne papper, and it still had lots of heat. Thanks!

A great blackened tuna, better than some I've had in restaurants.  Like another reviewer, I mixed toasted sesame seeds into the spice mixture for more of a crusted effect.  I made it without the salsa so can't comment on that.

My 5 star review is only for the rub part of the recipe. I'll update it once we make the mango salsa - we just didn't have time or ingredients for it this time. The rub is absolutely incredible! We recently moved to Japan and we got some super fresh tuna down at the port. We put on the olive oil part of the rub and then went out kayaking for the afternoon. We got home and made the rub just like the recipe called for, except we left out the thyme because we didn't have it. My husband grilled the tuna steaks and it was absolute perfection. We served it with roasted garlic couscous and grilled eggplant. Everything was wonderful. Definitely have a little water on hand because the fish has kick!

Fantastic recipe! I went to Whole Foods for fresh mangos and they had mango salsa already made. Looking on back, exact same ingredients so I took the short cut. The seasonings for the tuna mix so well with the salsa. I was worried about adding 9 spices but it was perfect. I cannot wait to try this again making the salsa from scratch. My bf said it was the best meal of his life. He couldn't stop talking about it. Thanks!
