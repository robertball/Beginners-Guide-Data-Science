I have been using this quiche recipe quite a bit lateley!  The basic ingredients are the perfect base for almost any add-ins.  Our favorite is to sautee ham, asparagus and onion and put that right on top of the swiss cheese.  Another favorite is to use one package of frozen chopped spinach thawed and squeezed dry from all it's water and spread out on top of the swiss cheese.  The recipe recommends freezing this and cooking it later, but I have been making it and then baking it right away.  350 for one hour seems to be the best cooking time and temp!  I have never added the pimento or parsley for garnish.  Also, I probably add a little bit more than 1 1/2 cups swiss cheese and I always use cream instead of milk!  I have actually been told by more than one person that this is the best quiche that they have ever had - how is that for a compliment :)

I have a monthly freezer meal swap with 9 other ladies and prepared this for my meal. I made 10 quiches (so easy...only trading Cheddar for Swiss) and they froze beautifully! I loved being able to pull my quiche out of the freezer and stick it straight into the oven, no thawing mess! Very delicious flavor and the feedback from my meal exchange ladies was awesome! They all insisted on having the recipe! Have made it for brunches and potlucks since then and mixed up the ingredients using bacan or sausage and various cheeses and veggies. This is a very good base recipe!! Have fun with it. I always get rave reviews.

I've made this as my base recipe for quite a few quiches.  Different combos: ham and onion/ spinach, meat lovers,  turkey bacon and asparagus/tomato- different combos of cheese based on what I have in the fridge.  I also use some 1/2 and 1/2 mixed with the milk.  I add real dijon mustard, tarragon and a spoon of horseradish to make the flavors pop.  If using onions, saute in a tbsp. of olive oil until soft.  Add any veggies to the onions to soften.
A trick for quiche is to bake the crust for 5 minutes while the oven is preheating so it does not get soggy.  One last thing- to avoid a spill/mess- par-bake crust.   Put cheese/flour mixture into crust.  Add veggies and meat, and open the oven.  Pull out shelf. Put the pie pan onto oven rack and THEN POUR EGG MIXTURE IN!!  Was taught this trick years ago at a restaurant I worked at.

Delicious and versatile!  I made two versions: one with a crust (used Butter Flaky Pie Crust) and one without.  I'd recommend using a crust because the cheese on the crustless one got overcooked whereas the one with the crust came out perfectly.  Homemade crust is definitely the way to go as the butter compliments the flavor of the quiche (also no transfat).  I added broccoli, paprika and fresh ground pepper.  Instead of swiss, I used a reduced fat blend of cheeses (Montrey Jack, cheddar, mozz, & colby).  I also used part half & half and part milk. I used 1 egg and 1/2 C egg substitute to cut down on the cholesterol, fat, and calories.  Great recipe!

This was the recipe I chose as a "base". I made a few modifications and additions and it was really good. I doubled the recipe and added 1 egg.(For a total of 7 eggs)I used Colby/Jack cheese, added 3 slices of bacon, broccoli, mushrooms, and added some garlic salt and paprika to taste. 
Everyone in my family enjoyed it (even the non-quiche lovers!) Thanks!

This was my first quiche, so I followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfect! Next time I'll use a homemade crust, bigger pan, and add broccoli! 

Note: This will spill over and burn onto your brand new oven, and smoke up the house, and have your significant other really worried when he comes home to a house full of smoke. Put them on a sheet pan, not directly on the oven rack!

Great recipe.  The only thing I do differently is I blind bake the crust for 10 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes, then press the cheese into the bottom of the crust.  This ensures a crispy crust every time!

We have made this according to the recipe and loved it.  One of our children was not a fan of the Swiss cheese, so we have made a couple of changes.  I now make it with Cheddar cheese and no crust in mini muffin tins. The recipe fills a 24 cup mini muffin pan and we make a couple of batches at a time.  They only need to cook for 20 minutes and they freeze beautifully for a wonderfully protein rich breakfast on the go.  Just a few seconds in the microwave and you're done!

This is a perfect recipe for quiche that you can 'doctor up' however you want. It's a great base with the amount of egg, cheese and milk. I always change up my filling ingredients with whatever meats and veggies I have on hand. It makes for a very  satisfying meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner!

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Great because you can do it ahead and freeze it and then pull it out whenever you need it.  I used cheddar cheese since I don't care for Swiss.  Also used about 1/4 c heavy cream and 3/4 c milk.  My son has already requested that I make this for his birthday.

I attempted my first quiche using this recipe and it turned out fantastic ,,, this is a keeper!!

I have made this recipe 3 times and it turned out perfect all 3 times.  Twice I baked immediately and one time I froze and then baked later and, so far, that one was the best!!!

When I froze it I first tightly sealed it using a layer of plastic wrap, then foil, then put it in a freezer zip lock bag.  When I took it out of the freezer several weeks later there were no ice crystals and the quiche did not get watery at all.  It was perfect!!

In my oven at 400 degrees, the frozen quiche took about 45 minutes and without freezing, it took about 35 minutes.  Do not overbake!!

I used my corningware french white pie plate, since it can go from freezer to oven to table ,,, so easy and looks great.  Next time, when freezing I will try using my wilton quiche pan (hopefully, it won't crack).

For filing, I used finely chopped/grated green pepper, onion, sausage, bacon, and cheddar cheese.  

I'm looking forward to playing around with other filings and will be making two for Easter breakfast.

Thank you so much for such a fantastic, "make ahead and freeze" recipe!!

wonderful easy recipe.  I wanted to serve it right away so I preheated the oven to 350 and cooked it for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.  I used a combo of swiss and cheddar then added mushrooms and spinach.  Next time I will make 2 and freeze one for later.

Four stars.  Taste was good, prep was simple.  I used frozen prepared pie shells (pre-baked for 10 minutes acording to package directions) which made this so easy.  I have 2 comments that keep me from giving that last star.  First, I think that putting the cheese in the crust first made for a really thick pile of melted cheese on the bottom.  I imagine that part of the reason behind doing this is to keep the egg off the crust, but when I make this again, I will probably only spread about half the cheese on the bottom and mix the rest in with the egg for a more even distribution of cheese.  Second, my meat quiche (ham and cheese as written) was very salty.  If you use a salty meat like ham or bacon, leave out or cut back on the added salt.  I also made a Spinach Artichoke version of this quiche with half a pound of well squeezed frozen spinach, half a can of artichoke hearts in water, and one bunch of cooked green onion, that turned out beautifully.  350 for 30 minutes was my time for the ham one (I baked them right after I made them instead of freezing).  The spinach one took about 10 minutes longer to set up.

This was fluffier than I expected of a quiche, but it thankfully did not boil over. Next time, I will ignore the little voice saying "add carrots!" They were wrong.

This is a great base for making a quiche.  It is very adaptable to whatever you have or want to add.  Based on what I had in the fridge, I used a shredded mexican cheese blend instead of swiss, one cooked up italian sausage instead of ham, 1 can of evaporated milk instead of milk. One hour at 400 seemed a little much as my quiche was a little over cooked on top.  Next time I'll cook it at a lower temp. But it was still really tasty.  I'd say this is a keeper!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe, and very easily tweaked. 
I am not a Swiss fan so used yellow & white cedar instead. I also made this a 'crust-less' quiche and just put the ingredients directly into my pie dish.
For the ham I used store bought deli ham and diced it, and also added some mini sweet peppers (about 1/2c) diced.
Delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very quick and super easy! I did this on the spur of the moment and used the "easy pie crust III" (cut the pie crust recipe in 1/2 since i didnt need a top crust) recipe and patted the crust down into a 9x9 glass dish--cooked @ 400 for 45 mins. EXCELLENT REVIEWS FROM THE FAMILY :) THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

Absolutely GREAT recipe! The reason others remark about the watery aspect is because the ham is loaded with water. Unless you "brown" the ham a little before adding to the quiche, it will be watery. Then again, it's a fine line between moist and dry ham, even in the quiche. I added 1 additional egg (because I remove the "chicken's of my eggs") and used lightly steamed broccoli as a great vegie add-in, this is a fabulous recipe as written~ Morgie I appreciate this tasteful and perfectly done quiche!!!!!

I don't know why it has taken me so long to review this recipe- it is outstanding. We do ours with crumbled bacon and cheddar (personal taste) and it turns out great. My husband doesn't like quiche and even he likes this one. I particularly love it because I can make it in 5 minutes and then freeze it until I am ready- makes it perfect for week night meals and weekends with house guests. I will make this over and over. Thanks!!

This was my first quiche and it couldn't have been easier. Deleted the ham and added 1/2 cup bacon, 1/2 broccoli, and 1/4 cup sauteed onion and left the liquids the same.  Skipped freezing and went straight to the oven. 400F for sixty minutes is too hot for too long.  I'd try 350 to 375 next time. Most importantly, my wife loved it.

Good simple recipe, I added some heavy cream to the milk and added a tsp. of dried parsley to the mix. I can see adding all types of different veggies to the mix too. I served this with a side of caramelized onions just because I love the como. Next time I might dot the onions in to see how that works out. I also top mine with crust.

It was a great base - I used imported Swiss so that I wouldn't have greasiness, replaced the ham with a peppered lunch meat and added chopped Asperagus.  I didn't bother with the garnish but did add some garlic powder.  It was borderline too bland, so adding some kind of spice other than salt would have been good - used a Marie Calendar's crust and it turned out great - 1 hour at 400 had the crust borderline overdone...

Super easy, especially when it comes to substituting. I used different cheese and only had asparagus, bell peppers and onions on hand, but it was delicious! It's a great way to clean out the vegetable drawer....

This is an excellent base recipe, exactly as it is written, for quiche.  It tastes best with cream or half and half as the author suggests.  I found a non-frozen quiche baked for 1 hr 15 min at a 325* oven turned out great.  I have never actually frozen this recipe, I imagine it would take longer to bake if it were frozen.  For my personal preference, I use a rice crust made with over cooked rice, 1 egg & a pinch of onion powder minced with a pastry blender and pressed into the pie pan.   When I mix it, I omit tossing the cheese with flour making it gluten free.  I like to add a pinch of white pepper to the egg mix,  then I just use the cheese, meat and veggies I have on hand.

This was OK - I switched out the swiss and ham for cheddar and bacon, and it was good, but it could use a little more egg compared to the amount of cheese that is called for.

This recipe was excellent. So easy to make. The only change I made was because I didn't have any dry mustard ... so I added just a touch of nutmeg. It was delicious. I made it for brunch today and my husband can't wait to eat leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. That's always a good sign that he likes something.

this was very good and so simple. I used sausage because I'm not a big fan of ham and a whole bag of cheddar because i don't like Swiss. like one of the other reviews said I cooked right away on 350 for 1hour

Wow - really great quiche!  I threw in an extra egg, and left out the parsley and pimento.  Cooked (not frozen) at 350 for 45 minutes, then tested it and because the middle was jiggly, I increasd the temp to 400 for the last 15 minutes.  My family loved it for dinner, and then ate the rest for breakfast!  Oh, I did pre-cook the (store bought) pie shell for about 8 minutes, then kept the edges covered with foil the entire cooking time.

My first attempt at quiche--what a success! I added some dried parsley to the egg mixture for a bit of color. It came out so beautifully, nice golden brown and perfectly set. I'll make this often!

This turned out perfectly, even though I had to use white extra-sharp cheddar. I also mixed the milk with half-and-half in proportion. I didn'tfreeze the quiche,so baked it at 400 for 30 minutes and it was just right!

This was incredibly easy to make and very tasty.  There are so few ingredients that it is easy to make one to eat immediately and freeze one for later. I have returned to this recipe one year later and still enjoy it.  I decided to use an Italian blend of cheeses and I sauted the diced ham with onions for some extra flavor and texture.  Even my one year old loved it.

Yum yum yum is all I can say. This was excellent - I used about 1 cup of ground sausage instead of the ham (we like lots of meat) and substituted cheddar. Our company RAVED over this. I was hoping it would be a thicker quiche. I think I might try to add another egg and more milk next time. But still - you can't beat the taste! And it was so convenient to have it on hand in the freezer.

10.8.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23772/quiche/ ... E liked this better than "yummy quiche," which wasn't bad, just much more cheesy.  This was light, but filling.  350 for about 40 minutes.  I added 2T parmesan to the cheese mix since I was just using cheddar. Also added 1/4t black pepper.  Oh, & subbed milk with half & half.  :)  I didn't prebake the crust.  If you just set it middle or a little lower in the oven, it will crisp fine.  I've done the prebake deal & mine turned out too crispy, like a very crispy cracker crispy.  Why do extra work?  :)  Later: Baked at 400, done in 30.  'Don't know if it was better, but it was faster.

I love this quiche recipe!  The only change I made was baking the Tenderflake deep dish pie shell for 5 minutes before adding the ingredients.  This helped prevent an underdone crust-which had happened numerous times before I figured out it wasn't me-just the pie shell :)  Hope that helps others who may have experienced something similar

This was my first attempt at making a quiche. It was wonderful! The only thing I changed was add a few additional spices that other reviewers recommended. I did substituted dijon for the Dry mustard only because I didnt have any dry and I didnt use the pimentos for garnish. This is an excellent recipe that will go into my book!

I loved the versatility of this quiche. I did have to switch to cheddar cheese as that is what I had on hand and as past reviewers suggested I did use 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup on half & half cream.

this is a very easy recipe that makes a great tasting quiche.  It doesn't have onions which most quiches seem to be loaded with. It had a great flavor I made it exactly as written the first time except without the crust.  I still make it without the crust but add whatever vegetables I have on hand on top. Once you make it you'll realize how this is a great basic recipe that can be easily added to if you desire, or left just as written.  Thank you for the recipe

This is delicious, especially with a homemade crust! It's also versatile since you can add the meat or veggies you desire or have on hand. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it was a little bland for my taste. I think that could easily be remedied with a little pepper or dash of hot sauce. Thank you for the recipe for this yummy and easy dish.

This is a great base recipe! I use pastry  dough (comes in sheets in the freezer section)because my kids don't care for traditional pie dough. And, then we add whatever leftovers we have in the fridge. Ham, Co-Jack, green pepper & onion has to be the favorite in our house. I usually don't freeze - just make it and bake it - 350 for about an hour works well! Just keep an eye on it and take it out sooner if it's done.

I combined this with one of your brocolli quiche recipes.  I had chopped up a bit too much brocolli, with my mushrooms and 1/2 onion, so I ended up with enough for 2 quiche.  Therefore I added a 1/2 cup more milk (evaporated), and threw in 2 more eggs. I used mostly mozarella in one (with a touch of cheddar), and mostly cheddar in the other (w/a touch of Mozarella) The mostly mozarella was a larger hit in my home. Also, I took reviewers advice and added a bottom layer "raincoat of cheese" to ensure no soggy bottom. I left off the parsley and pimentos.  Loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll have to make some changed for this one to work. It first needs to be to cook 50min-1 hour longer. It lacks flavor, but isn't bad. Next time I will add 1/2 c. feta, 1/2c. black forest ham, and will increase the broccoli by 1/2c.  The quiche isn't bad, just needs some tweaks here and there. I think its a great recipe to add ingredients to. Thanks for sharing!

Really good recipe and very easy! I'm in college and I dont really have time to cook but the prep time for this was ideal! I would say not to use 1 1/2 cups of shredded Swiss cheese, one is enough! Overall, great recipe!

This quiche was very good, I did however make a few changes. I used just the basic pie crust recipe, and put in cheddar cheese (I didn't measure this, so i'm assuming it was more than 1 and 1/2 cups.) I used canadian bacon (no ham) and a little finley chopped vidallia onion. I also omitted the dry mustard. One thing I will change next time i make this is the amunt of egg/milk mixture. I believe it definitely needs at least one more egg and a little more milk. (This is probably due to the fact that I used a deep dish pie plate, so if you are using a regular pie plate, then i'm sure you wont have a problem :]) Otherwise, this was a great basic quiche recipe.

Great quiche. It's very basic and the beauty of it is that you can add whatever you want to the recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I made a deep dish 9" pie crust and had to add an extra 2 eggs and enough milk to equal 1 cup. Thanks for this recipe. I really did enjoy it and will make it again :)

Great recipe! I have a little better luck with a deep-dish crust to keep it from spilling out of the crust, but great otherwise!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written. My only change was a suggestion from another review: sautee the ham with asapagus and an onion. It came out perfect. I look forward to all the different variations that can be made using this recipe as a base.

Great recipe! Besides the ham, I also added a half cup chopped broccoli to mine. I used Colby Jack cheese (all i had) I also used lowfat soymilk, instead of milk. I think next time I will add another egg. The quiche was a bit thin.

Great! Really appreciated how quick it was. And as others have said, adaptable. I cooked it right away at 350 for 1 hour, and that worked well. I used colby-jack to suit family's preferences, and still tasted great. using milk instead of cream works wonderful and reduces a lot of fat. I will say that I put it in a 10" pie plate, and that was too big--the quiche was thin and didn't fill all the crust.

Excellent--and so easy to make ahead and freeze.  However, I cover the crust with tin-foil becuase it burns when in the oven for that long.

Great basic recipe to start from. Very easy to prepare ahead, looked nice and well-liked by everyone. Good flavor and froze beautifully. I made some additions/substitutions for my tastes: cheddar cheese; bacon; green onion and roasted red pepper. Omitted parsley and pimentos. Great recipe for bruch with overnight guests. I served with ambrosia.

My husband HATES eggs and when I asked him if he would mind if I made a quiche, I knew he wouldn't know what it was and just say "ok" but when I told him there were eggs in it, he was shocked!  He LOVED it!  Extremely easy to make and I doubled the recipe and made 2 - baked one right away and froze the other.  I took other raters advice and cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes and it turned out perfectly.

Awesome recipe.Used it as a base recipe and then modified it with our favorites. Ours was filled with yummy stuff- brie and mozzerella, onion, spinach, mushroom, pimento peppers, sundried tomatoes. Will totally use again. I used 2% milk and it was still great. I also used Gluten Free pie crust.

Loved. Big hit at Sunday brunch. Made recipe with 4 eggs and added diced peppers. Perfect size for party of 4 as main dish. Good for 6 or 8 if you have a few other dishes to serve with it. Made fresh side salad with strawberries, craisins, feta, and homemade white balsamic dressing. Don't forget the mimosas!

- if making fresh, oven for 50min at 375
- typically use this as a base recipe but will switch cheese and savory ingredients, still comes out great.
- for a fluffier quiche, whip up eggwhites separately and fold into egg mixture (only recommended if you are cooking right away, not for freezing)

I'm giving this one star. Be aware that this recipe is for a quiche you have FROZEN and then cooked. The directions should include steps for stupid people like me and alert them that baking it fresh will result in a burnt mess. It's probably awesome when not burnt. But I sure wish I had been warned. Gotta go. Hungry family and need to call Dominoes

Did not freeze and baked at 350 for one hour. Did protect the crust halfway through with foil and put on a cookie sheet since I am embarrassed to say, used a prepared crust.  Loved this better and other recipe that we have.  No prebaking shell is great! Thanks. Did add sauted onion and sub'ed bacon for ham. Yum.

Did not freeze first. Baked at 375 for 45 min. Used 4 eggs and 3 TBS spinach. Great but wish I had a deep dish one for more servings. Be sure and put pizza pan under it.

Made this last night.  Was a huge hit with my husband and 15 year old who has never eaten quiche.  I used to make quiche all the time and lost my favorite recipe.  I now have a new one!  I forgot how yummy quiche is as it is really a favorite from the '80's.  I used cheddar in place of swiss and added broccoli and onions, skipped the pimentos.  Will be making again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I used my own crust and made with what I had (bacon instead of ham, cheddar instead of swiss and added green onion and red pepper) and it was really great.  I have made it several times with whatever is in the fridge, broccoli, peppers, cauliflower, different cheeses and it turns out every time.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy!  I made this for a breakfast meeting and there was absolutely none of it left when we went to clean up from the meeting.  I decided to use a can of chopped tomatoes instead of the pimentos just because, and it worked wonderfully.  I used Pie Crust IV from this site for the pie crust and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great "base" recipe.  The reason I'm giving four stars is because I seasoned with what I like instead of using just the dry mustard so I can't give it five because I didn't make it "as is".  I also used crumbled bacon instead of ham but I don't think that would have changed the outcome at all.  Definitely the go to quiche recipe!!!!

I made this as my first quiche, and seems like a great quiche base.  I followed the directions by putting the cheese in first, then meat, then added spinach and cooked onions, pouring the egg over that all.  Next time I will stir the ingredients before I put in the oven, as the cheese seemed to stay at the bottom and I couldn't taste it well.  Overall, a great standby recipe.

This was awesome! I used a homemade pastry, and baked in a quiche pan.  I didn't have swiss cheese, so used 1/2 cheddar, 1/2 mozzarella because that's what I had in the fridge.  I also added some finely chopped onion (which I browned a little in a pan before adding to the quiche).  I didn't freeze it, and it took about 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Will definitely use this recipe again - next time I'll plan ahead so I can try with swiss cheese.

Delicious! I used both pre-cooked bacon and ham. I use the hot water pie dough (my grandma's recipe) that I had in the freezer. So good, cheap and easy. Our Christmas morning brunch and a new tradition!

This quiche was perfect.  I did use a block of swiss cut into small cubes (like my mom used to) instead of shredded & I used bacon instead of ham.  I'm lazy, so I got a pre-made, pre-rolled pie crust.  It came in a package of 2, so I guess I'm going to have to make another one of these.  Yummy!

I loved how fast and easy this quiche was to make!  I haven't tried freezing it yet, but might double the recipe next time and freeze one of them for a fast and easy meal.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that it was a touch bland for me.  I might add some onions or other ingredients to it next time -- that said, my toddler ate it up!!

Fast and easy. I didn't freeze overnight and it still turned out great. Great base to add what ever you'd like to. Mine included homemade smoked sausage and colby-jack cheese, yum!

Great starter recipe, use whatever vegetable/meat/cheese combo you want to make it your own. The only change I made would be cooking at a lower temperature since my oven runs hot.

This is my first review of an item here on All Recipes.  I am a newbie at cooking and I made this quiche over the weekend.  I made no modifications.  It came out wonderfully!  My fiancee loved it and we had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.  It was the perfect consistency.  So, so good.  I will be using this recipe many times over!

I made two quiches - one I baked right away, and the other I froze per the recipe.  If you're going to bake this right away, I would forgo the flour mixed in with the cheese... I could definitely taste it and didn't care for it. But once frozen and baked, no issues. Maybe it helps keep the frozen version less watery?

UPDATE: I usually bake this right away, and have taken to pre-baking the crust so it doesn't get soggy. I've made different versions with sauteed spinach, steamed kale, asparagus, bacon, sausage. Any combination of greens or veggies + meat will work.  I've also upped the eggs to 4.

This is the best quiche I've ever made (and I've tried many recipes over the years). My husband and two daughters raved about it, and there was not a speck of it left at the end of the meal.   I subbed spinach for the ham for a meatless meal. I also added a 4th egg and added another 1/3 c. milk because the crust looked too empty and the egg didn't cover the spinach to my liking. But I did all the rest as stated (no garnishing at our house).  I baked it immediately for 45 min at 400 degrees F. I was so pleased to find it had set up so nicely. (Previous recipes have taken so much extra time to set up that my husband and I even joke about what time we are eating when we're having quiche!)   The texture of this quiche was excellent and the flavor exceptional. I will definitely make this again and again and again with the change in the eggs and milk. I know my family will be happy when I do! Thanks for this fabulous recipe, Morgie, Morgie's Mom, and friend Betty!

I made this pretty much "as is" except I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  It was quick and easy and tasted delicious!  Just a note:  this was my first time using a convection oven and I cooked this on convection bake...it was done in 30 minutes.

This is my first attempt at making quiche. I added chopped brocolli and red peppers for color.  It was wonderful, my 5 year old even liked it.  I made it for a food swap, so I had to make 12 of them all at once.  Finished all 12 in less than 2 hours. Great meal to pull out of the freezer and put in a toaster oven.

Was planning on serving this for my wedding reception.  Good thing I practiced it the week before.  Easy to whip up, but did not look appetizing once cooked (unfortunately mine browned unevenly and the crust got overly dark dispite the foil.)

DEEEELISH!!!  This was so yummy and quick to put together!  I decided to double this recipe to use up leftover Thanksgiving ham plus I had 2 pie crest shells.  Unfortunately, I only had a light cheddar and light mozz, so used those (swiss would be yummy!).  I ended up using 4 eggs and 4 egg whites (had a carton open) and used 1% milk.  I was out of fresh parsley, so used some fresh chopped chives for garnish.  Added fresh mushrooms and onions to each (sauteed first) and to one I added some diced tomatoes.  Both turned out wonderful...baked for a little over an hour at 375, mmmm!!

Delicious!  I made this for my best friend's bridal shower and it was a huge hit.  She said it was the best quiche she's ever had!  I used two parts imported gruyere cheese and one part imported sharp white cheddar.  I doubled the recipe and added one egg.  I also used half and half instead of half of the milk.  I used vegetarian ham and I added about half a package of thawed frozen spinach.  Everyone was so impressed with my cooking skills, but this was really so easy to do.

Made this tonite for my picky teenagers.  I did use expensive Gruyere ($10 per 3.5 cups of grated cheese) by mistake as I was stupid and didn't look at the price. I made one with ham for my 15 year old son and one plain for my vegetarian daughter. Put 1/4 tsp of nutmeg in each and was generous with the Gruyere, probably ended up with 2 cups quiche. THEY LOVED IT!! Our son who could use a few extra pounds ate over half of it!  I was so quietly pleased. I will make this recipe several different ways for our family this holiday season. I was so pleased at how much my kids liked it I don't care so much about the expensive cheese, I'll do it again because they liked it so much. But I'll bet it's fine with regular Swiss. THANKS!!!

Excellent, from now on this is my recipe for a quiche.  I did not have the dry mustard and put a little of the regular mustard and it turned out great.  I also added some chopped leek on top--- a keeper.

Like HEAVENBOUND41 I agree that this sets up nice, is a little bland, but will make a nice base for future quiche. I wish I'd had gruyere cheese like LadyJayPee--I think that might have made a difference. I used eveaporated milk since I had some to use up and I baked it right away. Good basic recipe.

I used gruyere Swiss cheese, and some black forest ham from Trader Joe's.  Used half & half since I had some to use up.  Also added a small chopped onion and two cloves of fresh minced garlic; added a splash more of milk and an extra egg due to the extra ingredients I tossed in.  I meant to add a couple of tablespoons of sherry to the mix, but I forgot; thought it might work well with the gruyere.  Sprinkled a little gruyere on top. I didn't freeze this but baked it right away and it only needed about 35-40 minutes in the oven.  Thanks, Morgan!

My family loved this quiche, but I made two different quiches for dinner (This one and the Spinach Quiche from this site), and I thought this recipe was great but missing the BIG flavors as in the Spinach Quiche.

Totall Yummi-ness!  I don't like swiss, so I used a colby-jack mix instead and added drained canned mushrooms.  I used non-fat milk and cornstarch instead of flour with a good dash of nutmeg thrown in.  I doubled this recipe, one for dinner and one to freeze for later!  Goes in my keeper box!!

I was looking for a quiche recipe I could play around with and this one was a winner.  I stick with the same amount of ingredients just change what the ingredients are.  I make it fresh and cook at 350 for 45-60 minutes.  It turns out great every time.

Both my husband and I were disappointd with this recipe.  The taste was bland and the texture was mushy -- definitely not one we will make again!

This is such a great "base" recipe! I use red bell pepper instead of pimento and I have also done a version with cooked crumbled bacon and frozen spinach (squeezed very dry), you can add sauted onions or mushrooms or anything else you like. These are so nice to have on hand for any unexpected occasion!

Very quick and easy to put together.  Was out of spinach so used broccoli.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  So many variations you can use with this one recipe.

The combinations are endless.  I had never made a Quiche before and saw this recipe. I did read the reviews and suggestions.  Oven 350 1 hour and did use pie crusts from Pillsbury... the red box.  While oven was warming I baked crusts about 10 mins. so that the bottom wouldn't be soggy.  One quiche was with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, 1 green onion and bacon...used 4 eggs. Made another quiche with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, 1 green onion, and asparagus.   In both quiches I saute the mushrooms and onions and asparagus ahead of time.  Both were yummy....baked both at same time in a deep dish pie pan...I have 2 pampered chef stone pie pans....love them.   Any left then I re-heat the next day ....1 slice about 1 min. in micro. Would use this recipe again but I would tweak it to be my own flavors.  I have used milk, or half & half, and on the vegetarian one I used almond milk.

1.5 cups of cheese sounded like a lot so I only put 1 cup. I'm glad I did, since it was still cheesy enough. I might even put less next time. 

I put 1 cup of mushrooms and 1/2 cup of spinach and no ham. It was great with the veggies. I don't think I would have liked it without them.

Followed recipe exactly except added a little broccoli and onion that I had sauteed. This was a huge hit with older teenagers and was so easy to make! Had to cover with tin foil the last 10 minutes to keep top from browning too much.

This was super easy to make and it turned out so well! I stuffed it with spinach, ham, and chives. The quiche turns out "fluffy" as opposed to a heavier quiche. My family loved it!

Very good!  I used a pie crust from scratch, which put it over the top, and I also did end up adding an extra egg just because I like a fluffy quiche.

This is a good base recipe.  Added some cooked broccoli and onion, and used half and half instead of milk.  Fast, easy, and delicious!

I made this with the cream cheese crust recipe from this site.  I'd used it before in fruit pies and loved it; it was a little too rich for this dish, though.

This was great. I made it last night for dinner and my husband and I both loved it. I made a few variations, just to add some more nutrients. I didnt have Swiss cheese, so I used Sharp Cheddar. Along with the ham, I added some thawed/drained chopped spinach and some lightly sauteed chopped onions. I didn't freeze it, I just made it in the afternoon, stored it in the fridge, then cooked at about 375 for 1 hour. Yum! I'll definitely make this again.

My family doesn't eat quiche, but I like it!  After making this they are now quiche people.  I used cheddar, swiss and parmasean, which was on-hand.  I also added fresh mushrooms, ham and green onions sliced.  I baked @ 350 for 45 minutes.  Wow!

One word for this basic Quiche recipe: WOW!  It turned out fabulous.  I did make some substitutions.  As suggested by other reviews, I used heavy cream instead of milk and I omitted the pimento peppers.  Other changes I made were: I substituted the ham for smoked turkey sausage (I diced 1/2 cup of Hillshire Smoked Turkey Party wieners), I added 1/4 cup of diced onion, upped my salt & ground dry mustard measurements to 1 tsp, added 1 & half tsp garlic and just a sprinkle of season-all salt.  The Swiss cheese and smoked sausage compliment each other well!  Taste GREAT!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was one of the easiest things that I've made lately. I have a family of seven and it was a hit, right down to the four year old that hates everything! I used Canadian bacon and a blend of cheeses. It was awesome.

Very yummy!  I added fresh chopped baby spinach, I didn't have pimento peppers and didn't miss them.  I also didn't have fresh parsley and that was no big deal, just added dry instead and it turned out great.  I added extra seasonings though - garlic, onion powder, dill, freshly cracked pepper.  yum.

This is a great base recipe. Change the cheese or the veggies or the meat to your tastes.  I've made it with turkey breakfast sausage and sharp cheese and then with pepper jack cheese with green chilies.  Very yummy. Thanks!

This is a very flexible recipe that can be easily altered to produce fantastic results. I used a mixture of Parmesan, Cheddar, Mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheeses (because I had leftovers of each in my fridge), together with bacon instead of ham. Skipped the salt, parsley and pimento peppers because I did not have any on hand, opting for a few shakes of ground black pepper and a handful of chopped green onions. Paired this with the Easy Pie Crust recipe on this site, and baked it at 190 for half an hour, by which time the quiche looked cooked and ready so I took it out of the oven. I had been worried that using the strange combination of cheese would affect the final product, but it turned out lovely. I will definitely make again and again; next time I'm going to try it with a handful of vegetables thrown in!

This is the best quiche recipe that I have ever tried! I added fresh broccoli. My quiche always turns out watery so I reduced by 1/4 c. but probably didn't need to. It was delicious!

Excellent recipe for quiche. I used broccoli and cheddar cheese as the filling, but followed the rest of the recipe as it was written. I had to bake mine a bit longer-but every oven is different. Thanks for a super and simple dish!

This was super easy. I made it for the first time today to bring to a friend's house for brunch. It was a huge hit! I used pre-made pie shells to save on time. I made one with spinach and bacon and the other with ham, peppers and onions. I made them and then put them right in the oven instead of freezing. I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half instead of just milk. I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss. They both came out great!

Delicious!
I used a package of thawed and drained spinach, swiss cheese, and crumbled cooked bacon. I used a bit too much spinach, so I'll try using only half a package next time. I'll also try using mushrooms!
Also, it doesn't matter what order you put the dry ingredients in, as long as the milk mixture goes in last. Try mixing up the dry ingredients (cheese, meat, veggies) before putting them on the crust. All my cheese was at the bottom, and I would have preferred for it to be spread out.

A wonderful basic quiche recipe, very versatile.  I wanted to make it right away, so I cooked it for about 50 min at 350 degrees and it turned out wonderful.  Next time, I plan to add a few more veggies to fill it out.  Easy to take on the go too.

If you use a defrosted pie crust do not cook the quiche for more than 50 min!! I cooked mine for 50 and it was slightly overcooked. Although, I really liked the recipe and and it had a wonderful flavor.

I don't care for quiche's much but my wife and family said it was really good. We made mini ones in a muffin pan and froze it until Christmas day! Went over well for finger foods.

I did not have dry mustard powder, so I looked in my spice cabinet, and combined (in small amounts so that it would not be overpowering) cumin, cinnamon, parsley, salt and pepper. I also used a combination of cream and milk, and added a lot more cheese at the base. Perfect, easy, super delicious- can't ask for a better quiche recipe!

This was great!! we loved it.  I made two- one for dinner and one to freeze.  I wish I had done more.  I never write recipes down in my recipe book, but this one made the book. my picky-light-eating kids both finished a whole piece without coaxing.

I love this recipe.  I use this as a guide with the basic ingredients and then add whatever extras I want.  I make it Greek, with spinach, olives, artichokes, I make it mexican with jalepenos and spicy sausage or Italian style.  I make this every couple of weeks and then eat it all week long.  A slice of this quiche with some grapes makes for a great lunch!

I ended up  doubling this to fit in a 10" springform (though I think the filling would have been lacking for my pie pan, as well), baked it, and froze it after cooling. I used red peppers in place of pimento - and less parsley than called for because I ran out. So far so good. I'll update when I get a report from the folks that will eat it.

Super easy to prepare and it comes out so fluffy and delicious! It was like a perfect combination of cheese and egg in every bite. Even my husband who normally sticks his nose up at quiche admitted that he liked it. I used pepperoni instead of ham and while it was good, I'd love to try it with some diced ham next time. This is a fast, delicious recipe, perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner!

Easy and yummy!  I changed the recipe a bit according to what I had on hand.  I used a variety of different cheeses, sausage instead of ham, added onions and potatoes and topped it with green onions.  I also used 5 eggs and about 1 1/3 cups milk to fill out the pie a bit more.  I loved that I could make this the night before!

I baked mine straight from prep, no freezing, and it took just under 40 minutes. Nice easy recipe - and I think lots of possibilities for adding various vegetables and herbs. But it's also good as is!

I made this using "cheese ends" from the deli, so I had a combination of swiss, american and who knows what. I shredded in my food processor first. Also added about 1/2c chopped broccoli. Cooked it right away, it took about 45 minutes. I read a few reviews that said plain,bland....but my kids loved it, ham, cheese and yes broccoli with no overpowering spices to get in the way. I will make again.

Kind of bland.  I used 1 1/3 Cups evaporated milk, 4 eggs for the egg mix.. Added Broccoli..baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Set up nice.  Needs alot more flavor for our tastes.  I'll use this as a base recipe and add more flavors.

I used a pre-made rolled up pie crust, cheddar/colby shredded cheese, bacon, and onion.  Delicious!  It puffed up quite a bit so leave extra room.  I made a second one with ham, cheese, and broccoli to freeze.  I cant wait to see how it comes out!

I served this at my sister-in-laws baby shower and got rave reviews from everyone, especially my three young nieces. It's great for every age. I changed a few of the ingredients such as no mustard, parsley, peppers, and salt. Instead of swiss I used monterey jack and used turkey ham instead of regular ham. The recipe turned out beautifully. Being able to freeze it before hand was a big help!!!

Very good recipe.  If cooking it fresh, not frozen, it will cook in about 40 mins.  
You may want to compare other recipes for oven temp if cooking fresh.

I made this today, added asparagus (had some that's wild here) fantastic and had no chance to freeze for later...I turned heat to 375 degrees just in case and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  Excellent recipe, easy to modify. Thanks.

Super tasty! I used 1/2c. cream and 1/2 c. milk instead.  As well, I added 3/4c. chopped spinach and 4 slices of cooked bacon instead of ham.  My kids loved it!

Made this for family that was visiting and it was a smash hit. I used cheddar cheese in place of the Swiss and sautéed onion and cubed smoked sausage in place of the ham. I also topped with a bit of smoked paprika before baking and served with fresh home made salsa on top. Outstanding!

Fast and easy recipe. I have made it several times with some modifications depending on what I have on hand. Usually, I make when I have leftover ham. If there are any leftover vegetables in the fridge, such as broccoli or mushrooms, I throw them in. I have used many different types of cheeses - swiss, cheddar, and a combination of mozzarella and parmesan. It works with both homogenized and 1% milk. To make things faster, I cheat and use pre-made pie shells.

So easy and delicious! I used sliced swiss bc that's all I had. Very good! Followed other reviews re: put the shell in the oven and then pour on the egg mixture. Brilliant. Did not boil over as some have said. Perfectly done in 60 minutes. Thanks!

Was very moist and tasty but the top of the quiche looked burned.  I put foil on the crust edge, but didn't know I had to worry about the cheese turning black on top.  What do y'all do to keep it from turning black?  I baked it for about 60 mins.  Ended up pulling over-done layer off the top.  Still tasted good but didn't look so good.

Fantastic recipe! My BF is vegetarian, so we opted to replace the meat ingredients for mushrooms, diced in small pieces. We cooked all the ingredients prior to mixing them with the eggs, make sure it's a little cool or it will start cooking the eggs. We love it! We also add piri piri (hot sauce) and cheese. Sometimes we use the kraft habanero that comes already shredded in a bag, delicious!!!

This was an excellent base recipe for anything you want to put in it and was a BIG hit on Christmas morning. I love that it took about ten minutes to prepare and then only 45min. to bake (mine did not need a full hour like the recipe states). I added one more egg, used colby-jack cheese and added sauted peppers and onions to mine but I will use this again as a base for whatever you want to add to it for the crowd you are freeding! Thanks for posting this simple and delicious brunch or dinner idea:)

I cooked right away at 350 for about 40 mins.  used more cheese and half/half as well as a little tarragon and sauteed onion. Was concerned it might not have enough liquid, but it was very moist. Excellent!

perfect quiche and a great base for whatever your additions would be!  super fluffy and always comes out perfectly cooked from center to edge.  definitely bake your crust for 10/15 mins so that the wet ingredients do not make for a soggy crust.

Did not make a crust.  I sprayed the pan and coated it with Panko.  First piece was a little hard to get out,but rest was OK.  I used jack cheese and added frozen chopped spinach (thawed, squeezed dry).  Quick to make.  I baked it at 350, because I didn't check the temperature.  Worked fine.  Satisfying dinner.  Thanks.

Great recipe. You can use pretty much whatever shredded cheese you have on hand (I used cheddar and mozzarella). Since I didn't freeze it, I took advice from another reviewer and cooked it in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes. I didn't have fresh parsley so I sprinkled some dry parsley in the eggs before baking, and I omitted the pimento.

Wowza-  wonderful!

350 for 1 hour.
Added a few things I had around the house- sautéed garlic and onion, tomato, chives.  Amazing.

I always make 2 pies.  Instead of using 2 cups of milk for a double recipe, I use 1 can of evaporated milk plus 1 cup of water since I use 8 eggs to make extra filling.  I also substitute sharp cheddar for swiss, 1 pound of sausage instead of ham, and 8 ounces of frozen, thawed spinich, all divided equally between both pies. They come out perfect every time.

this is a wonderful basic quiche recipe.  first time i made it i used cream because i did not have enough milk.  used milk (2%) the next time and had to bake a bit longer to be as firm.  Now i use cream everytime.  wonderful make and bake or to make and freeze.  cooks up beautifully even from frozen.  this is the only quiche recipe i use.

My family liked this quiche and, if you follow directions to a "T" the dish DOES set properly (maybe others that had trouble got their measurement wrong)!  I wil l defiantly make this again b/c it was fast and easy and made completely w/ left overs!!  It had a sweet flavor to it-IDK maybe because of the swiss cheese...I might add some cheddar next time!  Thanks for recipe.

i have a question does it matter if you used a shallow baking pan (square or rectangle) will it cook in the middle still or is there a reason other than how it looks and tradition to use a round pie pan?

I did change this up a little, I used bacon and cheddar with sauteed onions and garlic.  I thought it came out great but it didn't take near as long as the site suggests.  I'd say maybe only 25 minutes and it was done.  Also, I might use 1 extra egg next time for a little more filling.

Used this recipe as a base for broccoli & cheddar quiche with some fried onions & garlic. I used home made crust and added some cayenne, pepper, and an extra egg with a bit of milk to fill the pan. It was perfect.

I thought this was good.  I put a cup of broccoli (cut up small)into the quiche, also.  I think next time I will experiment with a different cheese for a little different flavor.

This recipe is awesome.  I used Cheddar cheese along with the Swiss and sprinkled some on top too... we are cheese people

This was good.  Very light and fluffy.  I made it vegetarian by adding a 1/2 cup of sauteed onions and mushrooms instead of the diced ham.  Also, I used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c half and half.  It was a great texture and taste, I just think it needed to be cooked alittle longer.

Great recipe. I used an Italian blend of cheeses and threw in some broccoli. Cooked it from frozen just as the recipe said and it was yummy!

This was pretty good. I used Monterey Jack cheese, added mushrooms and used sausage instead of ham. Next time I will add some spices.

This is a great recipe to tinker with - use different cheeses, different meats & veggies, etc, to create a new quiche every time. My favorite so far: bacon and spinach!

This is a very good base recipe. I have used it several times and have been pleased. The one thing that I think could be omitted is the salt. With the ham, I don't think you need it. For variations, I have used different cheeses and bacon pieces instead of ham. I have always added ground black pepper and either onion, or onion flakes.  Thank you.

This was so easy and so great! I switched the ham for chopped brocolli and added some chopped garlic. We served this for brunch at a baby shower and it was great. I also plan to try it with spinach. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Christmas Brunch and everyone fought over the last piece!  I should have made 2 of them but who knew I'd need that for just 6 adults!  Will make again for New Year's Day morning but will probably double the ham again like I did before.

This was a great base to put in any fillings and/or spices you would like.  I use ham, cheese and mushrooms, but there are endless possibilities.  Since pie crusts come in packages of two, I'm going to fill up my freezer with different varieties to have on hand!

Very good recipe.  I don't ever plan ahead so I did not freze this.  Mine took about 45 minutes to back unfrozen.  It has a nice flovor and good texture.

This is going to be one of my favorites too, Morgie.  I didn't have the swiss cheese (discovered this when I was already into the recipe) so I substituted Mexican Cheese Blend.  Other than that I went by recipe.  Next time it will be fun to try different fillings but same egg base.  What I especially liked about this recipe was that it's not only fast and easy, but Oh So Good!!!  Also you can freeze it and bake later.  This time around I fixed and served.  Thanks for a really great recipe!

Good base from which to get creative.  I just made the best quiche of my life.  Changes:  Cheddar instead of Swiss,  3 pieces crispy bacon crumbled and ham to equal about 1/2 a cup,  dijon mustard,  tarragon,  garlic powder,  tabasco,  sautéd mushrooms and green onions and spinach (just a bit  frozen, thawed and squeezed). I sprinkled smoked paprika on top. So delicious.

Very good, but I did not freeze, just baked it right away. very easy to substitute depending on what veggies, meat you want to use. Had to add another egg and a bit more milk because my quiche pan is 9.5" wide. Probably used a bit more cheese also.

Came out pretty great, only thing changed was that I didn't have fresh parsley nor pimento peppers, so I didn't add either of those. Didn't change much about the dish though.

Main reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it came out frankly a bit too watery and salty for my taste, so I'd suggest adding a bit more flour, and a little less salt. With that in mind though, I'd definitely recommend.

I made this Christmas morning and it was a big hit. I actually made 2 and sent one home with my daughter since she liked it so much. Easy to put together but I did have to bake it longer than 60 minutes but that could have been my oven. Definitely make again!

I used this recipe to use up items in my fridge #leftoversfordinner. I used white sharp cheddar, peas, bacon, leftover baby baked potatoes cut in fourths, then topped with my home grown cherry tomatoes.  My 19yo son exclaimed “this is WILDLY delicious!"

I thought that this was a great base recipe; I did fried bacon and onions instead of ham, and added fresh broccoli. I also substituted a bit of smoked Gouda for some of the cheese. Definitely will be my go to recipe from now on.

We made this and it tasted great. We did not have Swiss cheese so we used cheddar and mozzarella cheese. We also sautéed mushrooms, onions, and red peppers. Easy to put together. Would highly recommend.

Nice recipe. I brushed the raw pie shell with a little egg yolk (Joy of Cooking) and pre baked for 10 minutes.  Cool for a few minutes, then continue. Mine only took 45 minutes.

This is super easy to make, and easy to modify based on preferences or what you happen to have in your fridge. I had bacon, so I didn't buy ham. I had cheddar, so I didn't buy swiss. I added spinach because I like to have some veggies.
Next time I make it, I'm going to cut back on the cheese and add more egg, and add some onions.

I wanted a quick easy quiche recipe that used frozen pie crust to make ahead for Christmas morning & this recipe was perfect. I made one with broccoli & bacon and a second with ham & spinach- both turned out excellent. The only modification I made (other than choice of filling) was to use a little less cheese, more like 3/4-1cup in each pie shell. I used Marie Calendar deep dish pie crusts and 1 & 1/2 cups of cheese almost filled them completely up so I had to take some out to make room for the rest of the filling... they were still delightfully fluffy with nice cheese flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Made one test one with ham and broccoli, and baked right away - so yummy! Then went ahead and did the prep-ahead-then-bake-later for Christmas morning, this time doing one veggie and one ham and bacon with cheddar cheese. Again, very good, and so nice to be able to take care of ahead of time. Excellent recipe, thank you!

I just made three of these and froze them so I can't vouch for their taste; however, I would say get a deep dish pie crust. The recipe doesn't specify that, but I had one in my freezer and it was a lot easier getting it wrapped up and into the freezer without spillage than with the pain 9 inch pie crusts.

Made sure to save this one in favorites! Will come back to again and again, very easy to swap in/out ingredients for variety and to compromise for picky eaters. ;)
Loved tip of pouring while shells are on oven rack already - also do this for pumpkin pies - great tip!

The foundation of this recipe is outstanding!  I’m quite sure if I made it as is, I would have loved it, but I adapted to what I had on hand.  I had Swiss, bacon crumbles and onions. I didn’t freeze it. Instead I cooked it at 350 for an hour and let rest for 10 minutes. Next time, I might make one and freeze one!  Thank you for such a fantastic recipe.

Based on other comments, I cooked it at 350 degrees for 70 minutes. I used a gluten-free crust which may have accounted for the extra time needed (others said they baked it for an hour at 350 degrees).  I added a half cup of diced fresh Roma tomatoes.  I baked it immediately and will be freezing several pieces to enjoy over the next couple of weeks.

Very good quiche recipe. I've made several dozen using this recipe but baked them right away as we were selling them in bake sale.  I've since made several, freezing them unbaked.  And I always use Never, Never Fail Pastry which is perfect.  I just made another batch using coarsely chopped zucchini and onion.  Instead of ham, I cooked up some bacon, drained most of the grease, then sauteed the zucchini and onion lightly in the same pan and added it to the quiche. I kept back some of the cheese (a mix of cheddar and Havarti) to put on top.  DEEE licious.

This is delicious!!  I didn't have swiss cheese so I substituted sharp cheddar.  I also used rotisserie chicken and fresh broccoli which  was sauteed with chopped onion in a little olive oil.  It was divine!

Added some cooked asparagus I had on hand with the ham layer and dried thyme. Very good! I also didn't freeze it, so reduced the time by about a half.

I have made this recipe several times and it’s always delicious. The only change is I sweat chopped onion and add it to the filling. I made one ham quiche and another with spinach. You can really make the basic recipe with anything. The Mother’s Day crowd kept asking who made the quiche? Everyone raved about it.

Easy, make ahead recipe.  I followed directions.  It was good, but not awesome.  The swiss cheese didn't really melt.  I loved that you make this ahead and freeze for when you need it and you even cook it from frozen state.  I would try again and use different meat and different cheese.

Very good. I added a 4th egg along with quite a bit of leftover ham, spinach and mushrooms and a little onion and leftover peas. I par-baked the shell at 375 for about 8 minutes then poured everything in, baking for about 50 minutes at 375. Tasty! I also used about 1/2 milk, 1/2 whipping cream.

The only thing I would change would be using a deep dish pie crust instead of a standard crust. Tjis would prevent the contents from spilling out.

This turned out good. I estimated the measurements and had to bake it at 375 to get it done quicker, but it turned out well.

This was delicious!  Based on reviews, I made the following changes.  I blanched broccoli in the microwave and added along with the ham and swiss cheese.  I used a combination of half and half and skim milk.  I didn't use the parsley or pimento.   No need to prebake the crust.  As someone suggested, I put my pie in the lower 1/3 of the oven.  Baked immediately at 350 for about 50 minutes.  It was super easy and yummy!!

I've made this a couple times.  Great base recipe that I tweak to our tastes.  I skip the dried mustard and pimento and instead add some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.  I've filled with ham and onion for a western quiche and also used broccoli and cheddar to change it up a bit.  A very good receipt that can be modified easily to suit your needs.

I made this pretty much as the recipe stated except for adding some onion and cooked it at 350.  I made my own pie crust.  It turned out fantastic.  My husband who doesn't like quiche said it was the best he had ever eaten and he would be glad to eat it again.  This is a keeper!

So easy and yummy! I added mushrooms and broccoli. I sautéed the mushrooms in a little olive oil and steamed the broccoli for a few minutes to soften.

Pretty good. I used cheddar and itialian sausage instead and no pie crust. Cooked on 400 for 40 mins and it was well done. I will try 350 for one hour as mentioned by another user next time. 3 out of 5 kids liked it, so pretty good I'd say..

I made as is except for adding some sautéed red pepper and onion which I put on top of the ham. I also added some thyme to the milk/egg mixture. I served it with a simple arugula salad and it was a beautiful brunch for my guests!

Great recipe!  I had a lot of asparagus from our garden and added about 1/2cup after the ham.   Came out fabulous.  I make serveral during asparagus season. Love the fact that it can be frozen and enjoyed at a later date.  Will definitely make this often.

Great for using up what's in refrig. But 1 hour at 350 is my recommendation. First time, I baked at 375 (as I thought 400 was too high) and it was a bit over done. Works great in small square casserole dish too.

This is delicious! I made a homemade pie crust. I cooked it right away instead of freezing so trimmed about 10 minutes off the cook time. I used cream instead of milk. Very good and will definitely make again.

I will use 4 eggs next time and add a tablespoon or two of flour or Bisquick to the beaten egg mixture to make it fluffier.   I love the fact that us uses milk, not cream or half and half.

Excellent base quiche.  I liked the idea of making the night before and freezing.  I sauteed together the ham, some asparagus and a shallot.  Used 4 eggs.  And took the advice of some other reviewers and mixed half the cheese with the flour for the base and mixed the rest in with the egg mix.  I did not used the pimentos or parsley.  It is a very good recipe and I'm sure I'll used the idea of freezing again.

I made my own crust. Instead of ham, I used some frozen spinach  that I thawed and squeezed  dry. I mixed some of the cheese/flour mix with the spinach and put the rest on the bottom of the quiche. 
I have made a variety of  quiches in my life,  none of them calls for some flour ! I think the flour made the quiche set beautifully and kept the crust from  getting soggy.

Super base for anything you want to toss in. I use 4 eggs. I also add baby bella mushrooms, about four cups of fresh spinach (cooked in with the onions and mushrooms), and 1/4 tsp cayenne. Any cheese works with this but I have found it is best if at least 1/2 the cheese is swiss. I use Boars Head Tavern Ham.

I was  going on holiday and I had lots of eggs to use up (I hate wasting anything) So I made 3 quiche  minus the garnish and I used old cheddar because that's all I had.  This is a keeper loved it, coming back from vacation it was a quick and easy meal.  I had a last minute pot luck guess what I took everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing.

A good basic quiche recipe, simple and tasty. I cut it in half, as there is just the two of us. I used bacon, sauteed mushrooms and onions and then cheddar cheese, as that is what I had on hand. My husband and I enjoyed it. Thank you for sharing.

Well yes I made changes but it was not out of disrespect but more out of my fridge!
So, I used 1 c. of blue cheese and
1/8 c of creamed cheese and
1/8 c. of shredded cheddar cause the cream cheese was a bit too... creamy but honestly, it was freaking great and I would do it again!  Inspiration gratitude is in order.

Good starting base. Added frozen chopped broccoli (patted dry to remove water), pepper, and dried minced onion.  I also added one more egg because it seemed like way too much milk vs egg. I may add even one more next time, but it tasted great overall. The kiddos ate every bite and did`t even complain about the veggies.

This is a good basic ham and cheese quiche. I have made it several times and it turns out great each time. The only alterations I do is to use half cheddar and half Swiss cheese for variety and I had a small amount of onion powder.

I have to be honest, I really only used this recipe to get an idea of appropriate egg/cheese/milk ratios. I used a sharp cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, and my filling was composed of a cup and a half of assorted grilled veggies (chopped) that I had leftover from a barbecue. I also made the custard in the blender and used a half cup of milk, a half cup of cottage cheese (the blender smoothed it out and it gave the quiche an awesome fluffiness)  and three eggs. 
My husband said it was the best quiche he's ever tasted in his life (due in part to the butter crust I made, which was perfect, if I do say so myself). 
Sorry for being the annoying reviewer who changed half the recipe, but this recipe did provide an excellent framework and totally perfect cooking temp and time.

This was my first quiche. I used 4 eggs instead of three and omitted the mustard because I didn't have any. I have a new oven, so next time only cooking for 45-50 minutes.

Husband is fussy.  Had to leave out parsley and pimento, but it was still terrific.   I added one more egg and used half and half @ 1 1/2 cups since I used a deep dish pie plate.  Very good.  Option to replace milk with low fat half/half is worth it.

I didn't freeze this, but assembled and baked. Temp seemed high to me so mine baked at 350 for 50 min. I added scallions to mine. As noted in instructions, I did opt for something richer than milk and used half and half. Revealed perfect quiche.  Highly recommend.

Didn't prepare it exactly as directed, but it's an awesome base recipe for almost any quiche variation! I added bell peppers, used cheddar instead of swiss, and diced jalapenos (or chilies) instead of pimento. I also cooked it longer than suggested. Still great, just change it to your liking!

I already made this and thought it was very good. Just wanted to add, that I just  prepared it again and it is in the oven as we speak, but I had to change the amount of eggs and whole milk to 4 eggs and 1 and 1/3 cups of milk because there wasn't enough in the pie shell (I don't think it was a deep dish shell). I used broccoli, some caramelized onions I had left over from a dinner, and cheddar/monterey jack/parmesan cheese (which just made it to 1 and 1/2 cups of cheese). Baking at 375 degrees and have timer set to check at 35 minutes (probably will take 40-45 min). Easter breakfast with bacon on the side! Giving it 4 stars, based on the last time I made it.

I love this recipe and make it all the time. I do add an additional egg so I use four eggs instead of three and otherwise it's perfect. I also find that I can put just about anything in the quiche and it always turns out perfectly.  I call it my kitchen sink quiche. it's a great thing to bring to brunch with friends and family -- it's my go to potluck item.

This has been my go-to quiche recipe for several years.  I may vary the cheese (cheddar works well), and mix up the add ins, and I cook it up immediately instead of freezing, but it always comes out firm and delicious.  The light seasonings are not overpowering, but add just a hint of flavor.  It always disappears quickly.

I added a little cheddar, and baked from fresh, not frozen. So I baked at 350 x 1 hour. I used a great pre made crust from Whole  Foods (Achatz Pie Co). I used bacon and onions, and added the liquid last (in the oven) as suggested, on a baking sheet. I also pre baked the crust, as suggested x 5 minutes. Delicious!!! My gf's loved it!

Best quiche recipe I've made.  I use light cream instead of milk (Just my personal preference) Chose a few different fillings, all are good, great base recipe to experiment with different meats, veg and cheeses.   Delicious! Now a family fave :-)

This is an easy recipe. But the temp was too hot for my oven.  It taste good and the crust came nicely as well.  The recipe only needs a few small tweaks.  I would recommend it with caveat that all ovens are not alike.

I used this as a good base recipe. I added shredded cheddar cheese, scallions and a bi of mushrooms along with a bit of garlic. My Polish family NEEDS their garlic. LOL It turned out so good. We had it for Easter last year and I'll be making it again for Easter this year as well. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I used bacon, sauteed onion, and some frozen broccoli. I sauteed the onion and added the broccoli.The cooking time and temp. seem to be off a bit. Probably 375 for 45-55 minutes. I also brushed the inside of the pie crust with egg whites to keep it from getting soggy, works great!

I just joined All Recipes today, so I am looking at some of the recipes that I've tried recently that I loved. This was REALLY good. Some of the the helpful tips from others made it even better! I used 1/2 c egg substitute and 1 egg, milk and half-n-half, Mexican cheese blend, sauteed mushrooms and some frozen spinach,added some parmesan cheese in the mixture,and topped with about 1/4 cup more Mexican cheese and more parmesan cheese. Seems like a very versatile recipe. A real winner here! UPDATE NOTE 10/30/15: I divided this into one small baking dish and a  8x4 loaf pan. Was done between 25-35 min; checked and it was starting to brown fairly early.

Very good. This was my first quiche and it was easy and delicious. I used what I had on hand: sharp cheddar, sliced deli ham, leftover veggies from dinner the night before. I used zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, and green peppers that had been seasoned. They provided a very nice break from the richer flavors of the cheese, ham and eggs. I also doubled the dry mustard, based on my experience with egg casseroles. I think adding a touch of paprika would be nice too- color and a bit of flavor. My only complaint was that it was a lot of cheese- too much for me. My husband liked it though. Also, I didn't freeze. As per another reviewer, I baked at 350 for an hour and used a crust shield half way through to keep the edge from burning. Great texture and flavor.

This is by far my go to for quiche!  I use the milk eggs flour combo as by base and change up the filling for bacon, broccoli, spinach whatever I think may work or the taste of my guests.  I usually have brunch for my family and even my brother in law who declared he doesn't like quiche said he liked this.  One of the favorites of my family is bacon I cook one pound of bacon cut up in small pieces and use the basics of the recipe... I also save the bacon fat and use this in my veggie quiches... It makes my kids love the broccoli or spinach quiche when everyone else has finished the bacon one.  I also use several kinds of cheese so the flavor is interesting I use a mix of cheddar, Swiss & parm just a little of each.  Yummy!

This is an excellent base recipe to add anything you with to.  I made one with ham and swiss, and another with broccoli and cheddar.  If you want to eat right away, rather than freeze, bake at 350 degrees for 45-60 min.  I did also follow others suggestions and substituted half of the milk for cream.

a great basic recipe to work off of! I baked the crust for about 10 minutes while the oven was preheating, just to prevent it from getting soggy. I used a cup of a blend of shredded cheese mixed with about 2 tablespoons of flour. I spread that on the crust and then some spinach, mushrooms and onions I had sauteed together. Then I added the mixture of eggs, which I added an extra egg white in and some paprika (eliminated the mustard powder since I didn't have any). I also put foil just around the rim of the crust because it would have definitely turned too brown. Since I cut down the cheese in the quiche, I added a little sprinkle of it right at the end to finish the look. Tasted great!! 
Next time, I think I'll cut down on the cheese even more because the crust didn't get soggy especially because of baking it a little at first

I used cheddar instead of swiss cheese, ommitted the pimentos and parsley and I added chopped green peppers and chopped onion to the pies.

Although I had had Quiche many times I had never made one. I found this recipe to make something savory with my extra pie crust. I had all the ingredients. The only change I made was adding about a third of a cup chopped red bell pepper that was leftover from a salad. It was delicious! I will make this again!

I love the proportions in this recipe, but though my pie plate says 9", this just doesn't make enough filling.  I usually make several at a time, and I simply make 3 batches of filling for two quiches or 4 batches for 3 quiches and they turn out great!  I've also added spinach, broccoli, and zucchini, switched out the cheese for cheddar or a cheddar-mozzarella mix, used bacon or sausage instead of ham and generally played with the fillings.  All have come out quite tasty.

I used this recipe as a base and tweaked it a little. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I used spinach in place of the ham for one of them since I had vegetarians joining us for Christmas breakfast. I amused Marie Calendars pie crusts and they were perfect.... Buttery, flakey and light....so yummy!

Very nice recipe.  I made two.  One I made right away and the other I froze.  Haven't had the frozen one yet so can't comment on that but the fresh one was great.  My boys loved it.  I added a layer of baby spinach between the cheeze and ham to try to get in a veggie.  Plus I used cheddar instead of swiss because we prefer cheddar.  Very nice recipe.

So easy and delicious! This is a great base recipe for quiche. I substituted the ham for sausage, milk for half and half and the Swiss for cheddar.

This quiche was so good! The only thing I did differently was add broccoli and onion to it.
