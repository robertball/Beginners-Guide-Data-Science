THIS is exactly what I was looking for! There is a dive bar down the road from my home that serves the BEST biscuits & gravy for $4.00 a plate & this comes close to that :) The only way it could be better is if I was having this made & served for me with a Bloody Mary to wash it down....yup, I'm from Wisconsin!

I was on my own for dinner and since my husband won't eat biscuits and gravy I decided that was what was for dinner. I went on a search for a country gravy recipe and am so glad I found this. I didn't have green onion on hand so I just finely diced some regular onions and saut√©ed them right along with the meat. I had to use extra milk since it was kind of thick for me but that was an easy fix. I like my country gravy to take on a slightly deeper color so I added a few drops of browning sauce.  I added the cayenne but next time I'll leave it out - not my thing. Sausage and bacon combined with the onion takes country gravy to a whole new level! Loved it! Thanks Chef John!

You had me @ "cook sausage and bacon in the hot butter" How about putting the cayenne in the gravy and maybe some paprika on top for garnish?

This was the first time I ever used Bacon in my Sausage Gravy and it was AWESOME!!!! I left out the onions drained the fat and added 3 extra tablespoons of Wanna Be Butter in it's place. I also omitted the Cayenne Pepper and added a healthy amount of Cajun Seasoning instead... The only word that comes to mind for this recipe is... "AWESOME"!!!!

I am gravy challenged and always have been and this turned out perfect for me. I used Johnsonville breakfast sausage and I wouldn't have it any other way. Hubs and I don't typically care for breakfast sausage due to the overwhelming flavor of sage but Johnsonville was the bomb hands down. This will be my go to white gravy. How can you go wrong with bacon after all???

Yummy! It's a little different from my family's recipe as far as ingredients are concerned, but it came out super tasty with great texture, and we'll be having this again soon.

II give this one five stars for being a delicious gravy! Yes, I tried it. And the only change I made was to use maple syrup flavored sausage links for the sausage. It was a perfect breakfast gravy over biscuits!

This dish was wonderful. My husband and I really enjoyed it. We liked the addition of the bacon and cayenne pepper. 
Another great dish Chef John.

Thanks Chef John.  Being from Canada, Biscuits and Gravy are not typically on the menu up here.  Recently found out my son's American girlfriend is coming to stay for the summer, so this will be perfect to give her a taste of Home.  Have used several of your recipes before which have all been great, so I am sure this will be too!

My grandmother made this and called it milk gravy which it is.
 I don't usually make my country gravy with onions and bacon, but I really liked this version! It was very flavorful! We had it with Chef John's biscuits. Yummy!

The recipe is very good; BUT -- I couldn't believe that 'Chef' John served it over CANNED biscuits!  That takes away from the recipe.  There's nothing like serving this gravy over flakey, homemade biscuits.

Chef John all I have to say is...Yummmmmmmmm. Though I'm out of bacon at the moment *cries* I put extra sausage crumbles in the gravy and man is it good. Tastes almost like how mom used to make gravy, I may end up using the gravy part of this recipe to make tuna gravy or even chip beef and gravy! *squees* :D

I make mine with hot chub sausage and there's no need for the cayenne pepper. I learned how to make it from my Mother who in turn learned it from hers. Scratch biscuits are the perfect match for this gravy.

I have done my own cream gravy for years, and I'm not a fan of lots of onion. But I try to follow any new recipe just as it's written the first time, then 'tweak' it if I choose to make it again. So I used the onions and the cayenne, and put it over biscuits...and it was really good! Next time, I'll probably use less onion, and paprika instead of cayenne, but this was an interesting variation on my 'plain old bacon grease gravy'--thanks for posting this!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe I haven't tried yet, but I decided to give this one a 5 to offset the 1 star reviews of those who don't read the description of the recipe (or the title apparently) and decide to review it anyway. This country gravy is also very similar to the one I've always made with an addition I can't wait to try - bacon! The recipe I've been using for years is great so added bacon can only make it better! I usually make mine with hot Italian sausage because we're not huge fans of breakfast sausage, but I've made it with breakfast sausage sometimes, and it's good both ways. I leave out the onions because my husband can't stand them. ;-)

Thank you, this is wonderful. I have been using packets for years, not anymore. I used this as a base recipe for the gravy. Can't wait to make it the way it reads.

I made this for my biscuits, I made some changes though. I used Johnsonville Italian sausage (mild), seasoned with 1/2 tsp chilli powder. I left out the onion and cayenne pepper and bacon. My sons don't like onions. They said this was excelent and I agree.I have never made country gravy before. I will use this again.

This is the first time I have ever got it right. It turned out great. The only suggestion I would make to first timers is that when you add the milk you keep adding it until it looks too runny. Trust me it will thicken up. Good luck my sistars!! :D

My husband LOVES biscuits and gravy.  I make the Loveless Cafe biscuit from their mix.  But this gravy is the best from any he has had.  No need to look for any other recipe out there.  This is our go to now.

I have been making country gravy for nearly 30 years to rave reviews, but after having a chicken fried steak in an upscale restaurant with a spectacular gravy, my search for a better recipe was on!  Chef John has never let me down before, and this is a fantastic recipe with or without the sausage.  The only difference is that I add a bit of sage to taste.  I typically don't buy the sausage with sage as the sage tends to be a bit overwhelming. Family & friends agree it's the best country gravy they've tasted.

I make mine by first cooking the sausage, then pouring in the milk and adding the flour, stirring till smooth and thickened to my liking. You can then stir in whatever you like for garnish, but I just top it off on the plate with some of my home made Habanero/Jalapeno/Ghost pepper hot sauce (yes, all 3 in one sauce). If you let it sit and and simmer for 15 minutes, you'll have sausage flavored wallpaper paste, incidentally.

O.M.G!!! Sooo delicious!!  I grew up on country gravy and this is perfection.  I did not have green onions so I substituted yellow finely diced onion and added it with the bacon and sausage.  I also used a roll of pork sausage instead of links and it was the best gravy for B&G I've ever had, and I've eaten my share in my lifetime.  I omitted the cayenne just because my children do not like spice.  Way to go Chef John, you've done it again!  Thank you for this recipe.  I'll use it often.  :)

Chef John, You have righted a wrong in my family. I spent summers at the coast with cousins of many different ages. Grandma was always teaching the girls to cook and the boys to clean. I do love my Grandma. HOWEVER, until now, I have been  the shamed girl of her training. My gravy was just flour and oil, Yeck.  I visited her last month, told her about my success. She said she could die happy.  I made her promise not to do so too  soon.  Thanks Chef John - as always - for making me look good to my family This is such an easy and good recipe. My husband says he just may stay for the next 10 years...if I make your gravy !

The five star rating is based on my family's opinion.  I would give it four stars.  The bacon flavor seemed to powerful to me.  Other than that it was a good recipe.  The cayenne definitely gave it some pop.

This recipe was my first attempt at ever making homemade sausage gravy.  I thought it was okay but my roommates LOVED it.  They actually requested that I make this again tomorrow morning.  The only thing I did different was cook the bacon separately and add the bacon grease to the mixture midway through browning the sausage.  

Gonna give it another shot tomorrow morning.

Update: This is by far my favorite recipe.  I have mastered the almost exact recipe.  I brought some leftovers in to my work for coworkers to try this morning and they said that it's the best country gravy they have ever tried.  I'll be sharing this with them!

I have never made country gravy before today and I‚Äôm so glad I finally took a stab at it. It is so easy and taste really good! I like mine over shredded hash browns but this recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you Chef John!

I made it as directed. Maybe I used 12 oz Sausage. I'm averse to butter, bacon and sausage fat all in one place...but went w/ it. I did add a little garlic powder. I put it on English  muffins and Grands refrigerated biscuits...not sure which was best.

I cut the recipe in half to try it by myself. I did not have the green onions, but it was so very good! I am going to combine this recipe with one to make sausage gravy stuffed biscuits the next time I have my kids! Can‚Äôt wait!

The perfect sausage gravy! Full disclosure: onions were omitted because I didn't have any on hand. Also, I used twice as much sausage because I didn't want any left over.

Easy to make and tastes AMAZING!!!! I didn‚Äôt have any bacon so I used a 16 oz package of hot sausage (if I would‚Äôve had the bacon I would‚Äôve used that as the recipe calls for) and it was superb!! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!

Perfect country gravy. Instead of green onions, I used minced onions. About 2 tsp and it was great. Can't wait to add to my country fried chicken!

Instead of using sausage links, I used one pound of ground country sausage. I also left out the cayenne (couldn't find any) and the green onions. My husband doesn't normally like biscuits and gravy but that's what I made for breakfast today (using this recipe!) and he loved it. Definitely a keeper.

I made this using the "homemade-style breakfast sausage" recipe with ground turkey and turkey bacon so I had to add more butter and some oil, but the flavor was still there and it was very good.

Excellent flavor.  I used a small yellow onion instead of messing with all the green onions and it turned out great.  1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper were about right for my taste.  I have to say though, 2-1/2 cups milk is nowhere near enough.  My gravy had the consistency of peanut butter after adding 2-1/2 cups!  4 cups is more like it.  Even with that much milk it will start to thicken up after sitting for a while and you'll need to add more.  Using less flour is also an option but with the amount of sausage and bacon in this recipe it ends up just right when adding the extra milk.

Was very easy to make and really good flavor,, chopped bacon is awesome and sausage flavor.
FYI: Do not put to much flour, unless you want a lot of gravy

I didn't have any bacon, next time I'll try it with bacon and I'll use a spicy sausage rather than a sweet Italian...  I also added Italian spices (thyme, rosemary, sage, basil, oregano & marjoram)  Very good flavor.

I pre-cooked the bacon three minutes this time.  It's great!

Made this just as is, absolutely amazing! My Sons both in College,( home on break)Loved it! I served it with Pillsbury frozen buttermilk biscuits. Pop in the oven and always perfect tall & fluffy! I am saving this recipe! The flavor, I think from the added bacon & onions made it! It was my first time making country gravy from scratch, I watched the video, it was so easy.

From someone who doesn't like country gravy...
ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I was making it for my husband, with of course homemade biscuits, and I ended up liking it more than him! I also made that breakfast pizza recipe that's running around the net, using this gravy and those Pillsbury dough rolls from the can (also not a fan of those), and this gravy made that recipe turn out amazing!! The only thing I do different is add a couple of tablespoons more flour...we like a thick gravy. THANK YOU!

Love, love, love this recipe. I just added a little extra  pepper since the family likes it spicy. It's satisfying for breakfast or dinner.

Amazing! So good my hubby requested it two nights in a row! Only change I made was to add some sage, since only regular sausage - as opposed to "breakfast" sausage - is not sold in Switzerland. Served with "E-Z Drop Biscuits", recipe also on this site.

2nd time making this.  This time I used 12oz of sausage patties cooked them 70% done before chopping up.  Also added half of a jalape√±o that I had in the fridge.  Turned out really good.  I wish I had thought to garnish with some green onion like I see others have.

Delicious. We like it real peppery and more cayenne as well. It came out great with regular minced onions. And I use Jimmy Dean Maple sausage, didn't have the other.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I substituted Mrs. Dash Southwest Seasoning. It  still had enough of a spice to it.

Have made this several times, always good! Last time I made it I used extra bacon because I was out of sausage. Flavor was lacking due to the omission of sausage. So, I added some sausage seasoning mix I had ( for mixing with ground pork for homemade sausage). Voila! I did drain off a lot of extra bacon fat, still great!

I've made this several times and love it.  Definitely no changes needed.  I used to be a big Eggs Benedict fan, but now use this gravy instead of Hollandaise.

I would add another half cup of milk to make it a little less pasty and a little more creamy but the flavor is amazing!

I love this recipe!!! I followed the exact recipe, the only thing I omitted was the cayenne pepper. I didn't think it needed any! So delicious!! My husband and daughter both love this for breakfast, I will be making it over and over again.

Mmmm...! Bacon and sausage saut√© in butter!!! - almost impossible to go wrong. It is definitely not low-cal but once in awhile, everyone should indulge themselves. I didn't change a thing except I sprinkled with a pinch of smoked paprika at the end. I served it with Cheddar-Thyme Flaky Biscuits, also on this site. This is another keeper. Thank you Chef John

We were searching for the gravy over greens recipe. Found a different one but wasn't the our gramma made.  This recipe is the exact match we were looking for .  Try it with bacon sliced 1/4" pieces and add fresh leaf spinach just before the mix is boiling.  Let simmer but keep striring until the leaves are tender and slippery.  Great Meal!

This is very good gravy. Ice been trying to make a sausage gravy for years and it's always been so bland. This has plenty of flavor, the whole family loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

Love the addition of bacon, but I've got to ask, why peel the casings from link sausage instead of using bulk sausage?  I like Jimmy Dean country sausage.

Very similar to the version I was taught by my grandmother.  I have tweaked the recipe several times over the years, based on the changes to my pallet.  My current version uses chorizo sausage, which gives the gravy a pink-ish hue & extra spice!
