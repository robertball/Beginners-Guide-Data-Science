I froze the tofu for 2 days before baking it to give it more texture. This is the best jerky recipe I've tried so far!

The tofu jerky recipe unfortunatly did not turn out as well as I expected.  I did follow the directions except adding a few more spices such as paprika, onion flakes, and cayenne to kick it up a notch. I used my food dehydrator to cook the tofu but it ended up not chewy as expected but just with an unpleasant texture.  And this was after only 5 hours in there. It was also way too salty for my and my husbands tastes.  I will not make this again.

This turned out HORRIBLY.  I was so excited at the prospect of having a good tofu jerky recipe but it turned out way too salty and was not the texture of jerky.  I followed the simple directions and cooked at 150 degrees..which was the lowest my oven could go.  I don't know if that was part of the problem with texture.
I would not recommend anyone try this recipe.
It will only break your heart.

A very unusual recipe; my first time trying tofu and I can bravely say I will not attempt to do so again. By the time these were done, the texture was in between dry and jiggly, and therefore very unpleasant. I don't know where I went wrong, but we threw out the lot.

This was bomb for me; my good friend who is an AMAZING cook tried it and I understand the concept after tasting his, but still . . . dunno!

I'm just beginning to be a vegetarian today, and with all of these great reviews, I think that this may be the first tofu recipe I try!
