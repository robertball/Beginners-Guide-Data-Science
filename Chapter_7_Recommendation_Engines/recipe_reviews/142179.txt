Pretty bland. I used a firm herb tofu and added one shallot, and green onions to it. I also added one red pepper and a dash of cumin to it but it stills feels like something is missing.

It was quite tasty, but a bit too bland. I spiced it up quite a bit, and then it was delicious.

I added rosemary and thyme to the quinoa while it was cooking. In a big bowl I placed the olive oil and salt and ensured that the veggies marinated in that mixture prior to addition of quinoa. When quinoa was added it tasted great and had plenty of flavor. :)

This is a great simple vegan recipe. I made this dish for a holiday party this weekend where half the guests were vegan and vegetarian. The reason it was such a hit, though, is because I added half 1/3 cup of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons paprika (for a 4 cups serving.) Really hits the spot!

Thanks for sharing this recipe.
My 1st attempt at Quinoa - excellent base recipe for what ever you like in a stir fry - I used a pre-rinsed Quinoa - added fresh squeeze of lemon juice and some salt. Now I just have to find a use for the remaining tofu in the refer.

Very good. I used this recipe to introduce the family to quinoa. This went over well with them. I did add some thin sliced carrots and left out the tofu. I was going to use the tofu but the store was out. I thought it had a nice flavor. Kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I switched out cauliflower for the broccoli, left out the  mushrooms.  Added 1 tsp basil to the quinoa and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  and 1/2tsp salt.  Chicken broth works just as nicely if you are open to the idea.  My kids liked it with parmesan cheese on top.  We will make it again.

Great recipe but was worried about being bland. I fried the tofu a bit longer and used thai (sesame) oil. I also added soy and smoked paprika to the veggie mix after the spinach began to wilt. Gave it a nice savory taste. Yum!

This is really good!  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I make something similar with brown rice and a few more veggies, but I never used spinach.  Not sure why I never thought to use quinoa...or spinach!  I'll make this a lot.

I skipped the broccoli and tripled the amount of kale.  I also used 1 cup of  quinoa (which yields 3 cups cooked), added half a red pepper, and 8 ounces of mushrooms along with 1/4 C of  grated Parmesan cheese . I also used about 1 tsp of rosemary, thyme and parsley. This is a good make-ahead dish that I will definitely make again.

I tweaked this recipe. My kids don't like mushrooms so I substituted yellow squash instead. I added a half teaspoon of garlic while the quinoa cooked. I added some reduced sodium soy and a teaspoon of garlic powder towards the end of cooking the vegetables. My kids loved it, but I told them the tofu was cheese.

My daughter is a vegetarian and it's kind of hard to find semi balanced meals for her.  But, this is a fantastic base!  It's very good the way it reads and best of all this recipe loves "tweaking".  Honestly, you can't go wrong.  I sauteed onions and garlic and microwaved some Green Giant single serve veggies and added them to the quinoa and she loves it.  So, it will def be a base recipe for great things to come!

This was delicious! I was surprised by the amount of flavor! I didn't add mushrooms and added a red bell pepper and snow peas. I followed the directions however added a splash of soy sauce. I paired with this marinated shrimp and it was a rave meal! I will be making this again.

This dish was different yet good, made it for family that are Vegan and Vegetarians.  They loved it, I did; not use tofu, yet following others feed back I added soy sauce and paprika, making it a hit.  Will make this again as it was my first time with Quinoa and I enjoyed it.

Yummy! we didn't have mushrooms so added carrots instead. Added soy sauce when served and it was super tasty. Since the quinoa was cooked in broth I didn't find it too bland but would like to incorporate spices for variety next time

I didn't have veggie broth nor fresh shrooms in my cabinet, however I did have chicken broth & canned shrooms, so I used those. Other than that, so simple to make and very tasty.  I added ALOT of garlic because I like it. If it weren't for that extra garlic, it may be a bit bland for some. Just add your fav seasonings and you should be fine. Was my side dish to shrimp tacos. Yum!!

Great base recipe. I quadrupled it for a larger batch. Good flavor. I will add a little onion next time and maybe some soy sauce.

I am new to quinoa, I've been vegetarian for a long time and my daughter recently decided she wanted too as well. Had to add onions to spice it up enough for a 3 year old but other than that it was super easy and yummy!

I used smoked tofu, which helped add some flavor, but this still missed the mark.

I used a 'chicken style' stock i had in the cupboard. The dish was really easy to make. The taste was perfect for me and I will definitely make it again.

I cooked the Quinoa in a chicken broth to give it flavour. Then added mushrooms in the fry pan and pecans. Crunchie good !

I agree with others- this is a good base recipe but pretty bland- season to taste. I followed the advice of others and marinaded the tofu in a soy/sesame oil/red pepper mixture. I also baked the tofu first to firm it up. Overall a good base and I will be making similar dishes again.

Quite bland but overall pretty good. I added red onion and yellow pepper instead of mushrooms and tofu.
