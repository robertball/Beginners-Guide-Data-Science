Bek's Minestrone Haiku: "Shazam this was good! (Added chicken sausage too per the submitter.)" I followed the recipe as written but I put everything (except the zucchini) in the crockpot on low all afternoon and added the zucchini in the last hour so it wouldn't turn to smoosh. Only wish I'd taken Bek's other suggestion and added some pasta at the end but with the potatoes we were carb-content w/ this fab soup.

I used this as a base because I used ingredients I had on-hand rather than going to the store. Rather than chicken stock and beef broth I used low sodium vegetable broth and water. Didn't have tomato paste or diced tomatoes with jalape√±os. I used diced tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano. No potatoes or celery. I added the garbanzo beans onions zucchini carrots green beans and the garlic. I also added in cooked crumbled sweet Italian chicken sausage. For spices I added Italian Herb seasoning some extra basil parsley and some pepper. My husband said he wants this on the rotation so I must have done something right with the on-hand ingredient tweaks.

I made it 2X in the last few weeks and it is fantastic. The first time i made is exactly and added some sausage pieces at the end. The second time i changed out the potatoes for little pasta twirls and put some extra pepper spice. (I love spicey) I was delicious both times. I will be making this a lot over the winter season!!! Thanks POSHBEKI:)
