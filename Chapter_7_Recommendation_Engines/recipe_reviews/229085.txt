A great alternative to baked acorn squash for a novice cook like myself. I save 5-star ratings for dishes that knock your socks off but this really was extremely tasty and it got better as the cheese infused the broth.

When I make this again (and I will), I will definitely include mushrooms again but I will cook the bacon by itself (I cooked it for about 15 min with the onions and couldn't get it crunchy).

Like Winnie, I added more squash and pureed the carrots & squash in the broth with a immersion blender before adding the onions & bacon.  I also added 8oz chopped mushrooms.
It was very good at this point.  I added the beans, but didn't need to because it was a hearty soup even before then. Adding the bleu cheese gave it a nice additional flavor, but it is good with or without.

For a broth soup, I think it lacks sufficient texture. The blue cheese was a little out of place in a broth. I think I would have preferred a pur√©ed kind of soup instead, mashing the squash instead of having chunks and less liquid to make it thicker, something like a pumpkin soup.

This soup is a broth soup and the bleu cheese gives it a very distinct flavor.  My whole family loved it!  I have one child who doesn't like bleu cheese so having it as a sprinkle on addition was great although I do think it would be delicious added to the whole soup because it would melt in more.  I think it could very easily be turned into a cream soup.  Thank you Cheflucas!

Soup seemed very thin.  I added another acorn squash, and then chose to blend carrots, squash, and broth to give a little heartier soup.  Still seemed thin.  Another time I would add more.  The flavors were very nice.
