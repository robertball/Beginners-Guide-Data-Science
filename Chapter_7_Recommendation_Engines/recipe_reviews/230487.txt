This sandwich was Very good! I decided to make guacamole and spread it on the other half of the French bread my kids so generously brought home. Skirt steak, which is thin, fried up just fine! My hubby declared this YUMMY,  nuff said for me! Thank you Allrecipes for making dinner extra tasty ;;))

The only part of this recipe that I can honestly rate is the mayo spread for the sandwich, which was awesome.  I had the meat and was just looking for a quick recipe for dinner, so I didn't marinate my meat, but I bet that is a nice addition.  I got my mayo/garlic-basil mixed together;   I put the meat on the grill and watched it closely (it's very thin and cooks fast)  then I just   put together my sandwiches just like the recipe  and dinner  was done in a flash!!  The flavors were so good together!!
