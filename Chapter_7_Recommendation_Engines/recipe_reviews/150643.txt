This recipe works exactly as it's supposed to. The submitter never promises taste satisfaction (although I can see some people liking these...). I think the first reviewer is missing the spirit of the Kool-Aid Pickle. While decidedly disturbing, there is something about this recipe that makes me want to make it again in green... I used Tropical Punch Kool-Aid. Makes for a VERY weirdly flavored and fantastically RED pickle. An excellent conversation starter for drunks, kids and oddballs. Thanks for the recipe, Carolyn!

I live in the south, and this is how it's done in my neck of the woods...Take a gallon jar of whole dill pickles and strain liquid into a bowl.  Take the pickles and cut them in half lengthwise and place back in the jar.  This allows the inside of the pickle to be colored too.  Then add two packages of any red koolaid (Cherry and Tropical Punch is the norm) and 2 and a quarter cups of sugar to the brine and mix til sugar is dissolved.  Pour red brine back into the jar and let the pickles sit in the fridge for two weeks.  Kids love them.  Kids around here also like taking a dill pickle and sprinkling a package of koolaid singles onto it.  Even though it's not the norm, I like to slice a few of the pickles instead of halving them.  Then I make peanut butter and pickle sandwiches with the slices.  Also, having a few slices is good for skeptics to try so they don't waste a whole pickle if they don't like them! :)

Well, these get four stars for their eye catching ability! They weren't bad, but they weren't anything great. Would be great at a Halloween party.

Ok.. so far .. I made this tonight.  I didnt have red koolaid but I had Grape.. so my pickles will be purple, I assume!  Anyway it was fun and I am looking forward to trying them and trying them out on the kids!  Thanks for this fun recipe!  Ill up date on what it tastes like in a week! UPDATE  I got the pickles out.. after 2 weeks.  The outside was a nice purple color, and the inside was still a green color.  The kids wouldnt eat them, but i tried them.. They were strange and sweet, but the inside still had the pickle taste.  Fun idea, but my kids ownt touch them!  oh well

This works like it should. I have modified this recipe in two ways for two different reasons...1) if you're like me and like your pickles to have a deep hue to them and 2) my son can't wait for a whole week for the "red pickles" :)

1) I used 2 Kool-Aid packets per small to medium size jar and it gives them a very nice red color. I would use 3 to 4 packets for the large jar of pickles.

2) for my son I mix a tablespoon of sugar with a packet of Kool-Aid. I cut the pickles length wise and sprinkle the mix onto them wait a few minutes and you have "red pickles"

these things are strange, but amazingly good if your into sweet pickles. as your eating they go from sweet to slightly sour (as in dill pickle sour obviously), kids around here love them and so do i. the only change i would make in this recipe is adding almost 3x the sugar. they are supposed to be more of a sweet pickle rather than a dill. the cherry doesn't give it huge flavor but just enough to make them perfect. on a quick side note though, if you don't care for them then you really shouldn't post a recipe. mostly due to the fact that you cant tell personally if they turn out right or wrong. like a chef in a restaurant not tasting his food for years and then come to find out its actually awful.

LOVE LOVE LOVE, as well as my son. Being from the south, i would suggest peeling the skin off the pickles first.How we do them. The flavor sets in so much more. The longer you wait the better.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE I took a suggestion after I had eaten the Dill Spears that I tried to make these with the first day 8 hrs after I made the brine so I went to Wally world and got a big jar of whole pickles and halved them I put in 4 packs of watermelon Kool aid and 2.5 cups of sugar shook it up and tried to be patient this time  2 weeks later I have to say I'm impressed and treat myself to 1 or 2 every day I highly recommend these to the adventurous types if you don't like pickles or if you are just open to new things I am not particularly fond of Dill pickles but I love these  give em a shot I Dill pickle dare ya. ;-)

The only place i have seen these is on the Acoma Indian Reservation in Northern NM. There they use grape Kool-Aid and whole giant dills. On their Feast Days these were at every single food stall and practically every single child was running around with one in their hand. Located on top of a dry, windy mesa so helps keep the wee ones hydrated.
