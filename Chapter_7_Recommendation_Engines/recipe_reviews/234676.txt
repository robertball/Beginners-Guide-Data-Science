I've rated this even though I used what I had on hand - "regular" canned tuna(don't have oil-packed)and used sriracha chili (don't have sambal). I liked the whole capers in the mix, the chile, and especially the crisp toast. I let the top cheese get a little browned & very much enjoyed this for brunch today - might even make it again for dinner tonight! Even Scooter liked it (no onions in hers!) Thanks again, Chef John (if you're listening) - I'm a huge fan of your videos & recipes!

Delicious!! The first thing I ever ordered in a restaurant was a Tuna Melt when my Piano teacher and her husband took me out to a fancy place. They joked about my ordering a Tuna Melt-but hey I was a kid- what did I know? This recipe is perfect and better than the fancy restaurants version. Made it but actually had to explain to my Hubbie what a Tuna Melt was, haha. Guess we have had different life paths. But this is really good and now my Hubbie has been introduced to another Chef John Hall of Fame recipe and is a fan of Tuna Melts. Thanks Chef!

Made this last night. They were REALLY, REALLY good! Didn't have fresh onions, so I used dried minced onions, and substituted Sriracha for the paste. I purchased a whole loaf of french bread so I could cut the slices thick. Can't wait to make this again!

OMG these were good. I doubled the recipe for 4 and used tuna in water as that's all I had on hand, and sriracha instead of the samba oelek. Flavour was phenomenal and I will definitely be making these again! (Oh yeah, I also cheated and put the bread in the toaster, but I did butter them when they came out!)

I used this recipe for simple tuna sandwiches. I added one clove of grated garlic and omitted the onion. I only had tuna in water. It was perfect. Sambal & capers. I would have never guessed. Yum.

Great take on the tuna melt, capers are great and the chile paste was a nice twist.  I did take some liberties though.  I mixed all the cheese in when making, I subbed half the mayo amount with miracle whip to give a little sweetness and I just buttered one side and grilled it like a sandwich.

I know the recipe as is would be fantastic because my watered down version was amazing! Substituted chili powder, celery seed, and regular chopped onions, regular sandwich bread, and regular canned tuna in water. I also grated some medium cheddar for the tops of the sandwiches as well, and I literally made this for lunch twice in a row! My husband isn't a big tuna melt fan, and he mowed through his, nodding as I asked him if it was delicious! :D

These were very good and we will make them again.  Used horseradish cheddar and the mozzarella was shredded, instead of pinching it in bits.

So good. I used queso fresco b/c I didnâ€™t have any mozzarella & reg whole grain bread with olive oil & a lil chopped up broccoli slaw for crunch b/c again....no celery. Loved the addition of the cheese crumbles in the tuna mix. And open faced style. No smooshing all over the place! Thanks Chef John.

This was a great recipe!  I have been making tuna melts for years--they are one of our family's go to meals for a week day dinner.  But, this recipe was a nice twist to an old favorite.  I was unsure about the capers at first.  But, they make this recipe-don't leave them out!

A winning balance of flavours. Sadly I got confused and got hard mozarella, but it was still good. And broiling is always tricky; my crusts burned before the tuna even went on (next time I'll do on low and further away from the burner). Thanks chef for a great version of an old classic.

Very tasty. I had some buns that needed to be used up so I made this as an open faced bun. I didnâ€™t have the chile paste so I mixed 1 tsp ketchup with 1/4 tsp cayenne together. I didnâ€™t have raw mozza so used regular.  Mixed it all up and toasted the buns a bit before putting the tuna mixture on top. I broiled them for 2-3 minutes and then added shredded cheddar cheese on top and broiled another minute or two  til cheese was bubbly and.melted.

I didn't add the capers, used yellow onion instead of green onion, put smoked paprika on top instead of cayenne pepper. It tasted really good. The only issue I had was that the bread burnt some from my broiler.

Delicious!  Not too cheesy, I cut back on the chili paste a little and it was great.  I didn't have French bread and used a homemade whole grain.  I make tuna melts a lot but not like these and will make them this way from now on!

I like his voice too!

Just a few minor differences in my own tuna salad I've made for years, but so good and tasty with those differences.  A nice change. And then to add the cheeses and toast it really upped the flavor.

My husband, who rarely trusts himself enough to make a meal,  followed the video and found the capers!  Ended up loving it and will make it again.  Trying to figure out if this can be converted to an appetizer for the Packer game this week.  Definitely a great and easy recipe.

Very delicious. The family loved it. The recipe was easy to follow. I didn't have tuna in oil, capers, green onion and celery but improvised and used tuna in water, dried onion, and Italian herbs instead. Turned out very good so I can imagine the original recipe to be even more so.  Will definitely use this recipe in the future.

My husband & I enjoyed this. Unfortunately, I didn't have any mozzarella cheese. I'm sure it would have been a little creamier with the mozza, but  we still enjoyed & I'm sure save a few calories. Will make it again.

Delicious. I used a Thai red curry paste and at the end, topped with some tex-mex cheddar because that's what I had on hand.

GOOD. I thought this was very good. I liked the chile paste and cayenne for extra flavoring. I did not use capers. The broiling of bread first I would do again, but broiling with the tuna on does
darken the edges  fast and I would like tuna warm and cheese
melted slower. I will bake next time. It will take only a few minutes longer.

This was amazing! I was seeking a fresh new take on canned tuna, and this hit the spot! Thank you Chef John! I have since raided your recipes for a fresh spin on some other dishes.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made my own dark flatbread for the melt and it was awesome. Thank you.

Love the capers in this recipe!  Never would have thought to put them in a tuna melt.  The chili paste was very hot, so I left it out.  But the sandwiches still tasted great.  (Now, what to do with the jar of chili paste! Lol!)  Can always count on Chef John for a new slant on recipes.  Thanks!

This is great! I made it just as stated.  My only problem is finding the bread he uses.  I can only find very thin loaves.  I have substituted sourdough bread.
