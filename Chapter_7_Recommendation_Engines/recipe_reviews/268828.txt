Delicious! Tastes like something you'd order in an upscale restaurant.  Of course, taste will vary greatly depending on what type of beer you use.  I used an everyday lager and you'd never guess there was beer in the sauce, which is a good thing in my opinion!  I definitely wouldn't make this with an IPA or a stout, but that's personal preference.   I have to admit my first taste caught me off guard and I thought it was too sweet, but I added some salt and the more I ate it, the more I became addicted!  To thicken the sauce at the end, I sprinkled in a tiny bit of the leftover seasoned flour used to dredge the chops. The chops I used were nice and thick, about 1". I browned 3-4 minutes per side, and simmered in the sauce for 10 minutes and they were done perfectly. Nice and juicy and not overcooked and dry.

Made as written, I had the brilliant idea to use some delicious IPA I had in the fridge.  The dish was good but the sauce had a very bitter taste.  At first, I thought it might be all that rosemary.  Nope -- it was the IPA.  Having reduced the liquid as directed, all the hops in the IPA became concentrated, making for a very bitter sauce.  I will make this again, but I'll use a milder beer like PBR or maybe a brown ale.

10.30.18  This is a really nice recipe.  Loaded with flavor, and it just doesn't get much easier.   I had really thin chops, so I did reduce the braising time, but that sauce really is outstanding.  Good weeknight meal, but tasty enough for company.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I'll be making this one again.

this was so savory and easy.  Followed directions and used a dark lager.  Double the sauce ingredients for more juiciness

Only used 3 tbs of the brown sugar and it was sweet enough. Nice and juicy!

I used a blue moon beer, and a little less rosemary.  My kids thought it was a 3.5 star because the pork chop wasn't fall apart tender..adults gave it a 4.  Pretty easy to prepare, would make again.

Tasty, but depends a lot on the beer used. I tried an IPA and I think it would’ve been better with something like a stout. I would also try making it with a honey mustard instead of stone ground for a different taste. But very tasty regardless.

Easy and delicious. I used Magic Hat brewery’s Pattersbier which  is a Belgium-style beer brewed with Rosemary. Perfect for pork.

This is a delicious recipe.  I followed the advice on selecting the right beer.   They were simmered on low for about 10 minutes than the recipe because of an interruption.  They very flavorful and tender.

Pork chops came out nice and juicy and tender.  The pork chops I used were a little thicker and I only cooked 2 chops as there only two of us but I used the same amount of ingredients as called for in the recipe and added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic.  I mixed up the ingredients for the sauce first then prepped the ret of my supper.  Once done with the rest of my supper I floured the chops as directed and cooked them.  I like this recipe because it was easy to put together, tasted good, and I could put the chops on hold while the veggies cooked then finish the sauce when the veggies were about done.   I will be making this again.

This was really good. We used an Aldi German lager beer and boneless pork ribs.  I served it with Muffin Tin Potatoes Gratin (also on Allrecipes.com) and a mixed greens salad.  Great dinner!

I made this tonight and the wife and I really like it.  Only changes were I didn't have any rosemary, and I put meat tenderizer on the chops 30 minutes before cooking.

There was the perfect amount of flour mixture and sauce to top the  four 1 inch pork chops, when served.
