This is a family staple. I boil the chicken first, then use the broth in the stuffing. When I put it in the oven it's just to brown the? stuffing and melt the cheese.

Wanted a meal at home made from things I had in the pantry and fridge.  This was quick and easy to throw together for a weeknight warm meal.  I wouldn't serve this as a Thanksgiving main dish or anything, but it was easy and filling.  Here are my critiques/additions:
1. As another reviewer stated, CUT UP THE CHICKEN or use pre-cooked.  This took about 50 minutes to bake and I DID cut up chicken tenderloins.  
2. Thaw the broccoli all the way (I did not, which may have contributed to #1....)
3.  We added some bacon crumbles on top afterwards and it was AMAZING!  May try adding diced ham in with the chicken next time. 
Overall, good meal

the chicken did not cook in all that cheese, should have been partially cooked before going in, or chopped up or something.

This was great! Definitely good to cut up the chicken, it still took 40 minutes. Next time we will use 2 boxes of stuffing and try to melt the cheese so it mixes up better.

This was really good. I love cheese but probably wouldn't use quite as much Velveeta next time. Great dinner option on a weeknight!

I made this one with a bag of California mix vegetables and Marble cheese and my family loved it.
Quick and easy with a great flavor.

Chicken did not cook thoroughly and I cut them into pieces, so it took twice as long to cook, otherwise very tasty and easy to make!!

I precooked the chicken with some onion, and added a few spices. It came out great. Husband also liked it, and said to put it on the make again list.

This was so good, my husband went back for thirds and my 5 year old ate all of her broccoli. I cut up the chicken into one inch chunks and it did cook thoroughly in the time specified in the recipe. This is now one of my go-tos!!! I will use two boxes of stuffing next time though.

Haven't tasted it yet but it has everything we love. Another time, I'll try French fries as a topping and maybe green beans instead of brocolli. A quick and easy recipe to prep.

Pretty nasty, nobody in the family liked it. I should have known going in based on the ingredients but it's what I had on hand. it's pretty gross unless you like bland food with an overwhelming Velveeta taste.

This recipe was easy to throw together. Very good taste! I will make it again but need to figure out how to keep the top from burning/getting too done.

This turned out really well. I actually cut up the chicken into cubes and added red bell peppers and green onions. It turned out great.
