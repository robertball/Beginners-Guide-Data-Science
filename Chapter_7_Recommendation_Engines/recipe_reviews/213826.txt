I just made this last night and it was GREAT.  Easy to make.  I had to add a little more flour because the consistency was too stick.  Family  thought it wasn't sweet enough so next time I am adding a little more sugar to the recipe.

this bread hit some what the middle of the road for us. While I thought it was 3, my son gave it a 3. My oldest gave it a 4, while my middle daughter and my hubby gave it a 5. I'd never made this kind of bread. The recipe was very easy. It wasn't sweet, but was like a light biscuit bread. The raisins made it sweet. Can't say it was the best bread but can't say it was the worst either. But what I can say is that it was okay, but this batch needs to be divided into 2. The reason I say that is because It's so dense, that the bottom center never got completely baked even after it was in the oven an hour and 15 minutes. While it looked pretty, it was to thick. 2 smaller round loaves would have been better for the baking process. But I think in my own preference. To improve this better for my taste. Add just a hint of cinnamon to it. But it's an okay bread.

Just made this for St. Patrick's Day.  Followed suggestions and added 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Put batter in 2 9-inch cake pans.  When they were done baking poured some melted butter on top and sprinkled on some green sugar.  Turned out amazing!!  Everyone loved it.  Made 8 loaves and gave them out for gifts.

I baked this today, St. Patrick's Day, and absolutely loved it.  Using the All Recipes calculator, I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" iron skillet. I don't like the commercial soda breads that are dry and almost stale in texture.  This was dense, but moist and it rose beautifully.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top so it smelled as good as it looked.

I hope everyone enjoys this recipe! This is my mom's recipe and it's pretty hard to beat! This is an authentic Irish-American recipe - that's what we are! My mom passed away in 2013 but she would be so happy knowing her wonderful recipe is being shared :) Can't wait to make this year, enjoy everyone! After you make it, try it lightly toasted smeared with some Irish butter... it's amazing.

I just got this recipe today and decided to try it immediately.  It was a breeze to mix up, didn't even need a mixer.  I followed the recipe and directions exactly, except I didn't have a 9-inch round cake pan.  Instead I used a round casserole dish the same size.  The finished product is beautiful, rounded and golden brown.  Once it cooled, I sliced it and it slices beautifully too.  However the texture is not like any soda bread I've ever had before.  It's more like a muffin or quick bread.  It's a little bit sweet too.  I think it would be marvelous with peanut butter on it and I will definitely make it again.  I just won't plan to serve sandwiches on it.  It would be lovely toasted with butter & jam with hot tea also!

Good Irish soda bread.  I used white whole wheat flour and sugar in the raw in the same measurements as in the original recipe.   I did not put the dough in a round pan based on the comments from another rater who said it is too much dough for the pan.  I baked mine on a cookie sheet and it worked well.  I will definitely be making this again.

This  recipe is the real deal as far as Irish Soda Bread is concerned, both my parent are from Ireland and while their recipes have a tiny bit of variance,(much like Italian families meatball recipes do) the end result is  authentic and fantastic!

This bread was wonderful...I added the dried fruit, and a bit of dark chocolate...HMmmm.  This will become a "quick go-to recipe" for when you just want something quick, easy and wonderfully moist and delicious.

Not often does anyone ask for the recipe of something I serve. When my friend, the professional baker asked for it, I was thrilled. Add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar (stumbled on this by accident, but it was better for it.)

I made this recipe twice now.  Didn't bake evenly in a 9" pie pan either time.  Went over sides first time. Second time, used a deeper pan, but bread ended up very dry because of its density and time necessary to bake through.  Took two different breads to work.  The other recipe went very quickly while this one still has some sitting in break room.

Followed the recipe, except for tossing in some vanilla extract, used a 9" cake pan, 2 " high, and sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking. Loverly !

I can't say if this is "authentic" or not, nothing Irish about my family!  I can say it could not be easier or more delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to make my own buttermilk using milk and white wine vinegar.  Baked in a cast iron skillet.  Awesome, easy and I will make it again and again!
Update: I went to make this and realized I didn't have any milk or buttermilk. Subbed fat free Greek yogurt for buttermilk. It worked great, in fact it might be even better!

Oh...MG! This soda bread was amazing! WAS because I brought it to a pre St. Paddy's Day party and bu-bye. All gone. I, too, added a little vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup sugar as the other reviews suggested. I ground cinnamon and sugar (comes combined in a grinder at Trader Joe's) on top and baked in 2-9" round pans. Seriously, the best soda bread I've ever had. Not at all like the kind I remember growing up (DRY.)  This was moist with just the right amount of sweet.

This is an awesome tasting Irish Soda Bread. It is made better served warm with a generous pat of room temp Irish Butter. We made this in a 2.75 Quart enamel-coated high-end brand cast-iron dutch oven. We extended the bake time to 1 hr 15 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, turned the oven off then left inside the oven for an additional 15 minutes.

I made this for the first time (March 2019).  I only made  1/2 recipe, used 3/4 cup white sugar; 2 eggs; baked in 9 1/2 inch round pyrex dish for only 35 minutes.  It was delicious.  We will definitely make this recipe again.  Don't over bake - especially in glass cookware.

I don't know anything about soda bread authenticity, but this tasted great.  I left the caraway seeds out for one loaf and put half in for another.  Without was great on its own and with butter - and with was PERFECT with an Irish beef stew we made.

I followed this recipe as written. It is very good. It was a little dry for me so I’m wondering if maybe I overlooked it. I’ve never tasted irish soda bread before and I’ll definitely make it again. My family really liked it too.

This is my favorite Irish Soda Bread (though to be honest, my mom makes it, not me).  It's more moist than most other soda breads I've had, with the right amount of sweetness.  We jokingly call it Wealthy Irish Soda Bread because of the eggs and raisins.

I just made this and it tastes really great - very easy to make as well.  My only warning - I used  a 9 inch cake pan as noted in the recipe - definitely not big enough, luckily I put the pan on a cookie sheet, or this would have been all over the oven.  Will make again, next time in a bigger pan, maybe a tube/bundt pan would probably be perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! Followed other reviews and added half a cup of sugar. Otherwise followed it to a tee (I did make my own buttermilk). It came out wonderfully.

I tried this for the first time today, and it smells incredible. I had a moment of panic when I realised I was missing the sour cream, but since so many other recipes call for butter, I subbed a cup of that instead for great results. Who doesn't like butter?!? Well, my hips maybe, but this was worth the extra mile of walking today! I'll make this again for sure.

I used a 9” deep  crock, but I had to bake it almost two hours. It turned out fantastic and we had it for St. Patrick’s Day Dinner!

It dries out quickly as they said, but I liked the flavour and toasted lightly it’s just great! I will make again, I think caraway seeds would be great.

I added a tablespoon of honey, some walnuts and baked for 45 minutes. It had cakey texture but it was really delicious. Definitely would make again.

As the recipe says, this soda bread is more like a moist cake due to more sugar and butter than I would normally use,  but it is excellent.  It won't replace my less sweet and less dense Irish soda bread, but is a delight with tea, and a favorite breakfast in our home.

Excellent soda bread! I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. Only change was I used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 currants. The bread has a good sweetness, if served with some good irish butter, but if I was using jam on it, I would reduce the sugar. It is important to let the bread cool before cutting into it. It was nice and moist and cross on the outside.

I made it just as the recipe directed but the raisins I had were a little old so I soaked them in Captain Morgan. I think the buttermilk made all the difference .

I made this for St. Patrick's Day  and will never purchase store bought soda bread again!

I  like caraway seeds in my soda bread so I added 2 tablespoons  to this recipe and lessened the raisins a bit. 

I also baked it on a pizza stone because after leaving the dough to rise for about 10 min (recipe here does not state this), it nearly doubled in size. I couldn't imagine fitting this into a 9in cake pan to begin with anyway.

Definitely make again bread. My son-in-law loved it. Next time will do half plain and half with raisins for my daughter. It was so easy to make and bake. Had to cook a little longer to do the center.

I used a mix of golden raisins and currents.  The dough was very wet and tough to handle, requiring a lot of additional flour.  But delicious!  I liked how it turned out baked in a cake pan.

This is my first review, and this recipe is amazing! Moist, flavorful, and a big hit at my house for picky eaters. Would 100% recommend trying this. Only change I made was from another review. Sprinkled a small bit of sugar on top before baking. It will be a staple in our house!

Baked for an hour in a 9" high-sided cake pan, it tested as done, however, when I tried to take it out of the pan after 10 minutes cool down time, it was still raw.  Made a huge mess!  Should have baked it for two hours.

I doubled the recipe and baked in mini-spring form pans.  Came out fantastic.  The only change was for the double recipe - I used one box of Zante Currants and coated them with a little of the flour mixture before doing anything else.  This soda bread is great for dessert, breakfast, or snacking.  However, if you want to eat a soda bread with your corned beef and cabbage - try a more savory recipe with caraway seeds in it.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

Made  a couple of changes. I soaked my raisins in hot water to plump them up. I whisked the eggs and buttermilk in the mixer using the whisk attachment. Changed to the dough hook, then added the flour mixture and raisins alternatively a little at a time. Mixed on low until nicely combined. Baked it in a 9X4 loaf pan for 45mins and it was still gooey in the centre,baked for 15 mins. longer. Turned out nice. I give it a 4.5! Not perfect but almost.

This recipe was wonderful.  Perfect with Corned Beef and Cabbage.  I did add a little grated orange rind to recipe, but other  than  that  I wouldn't change anything else.  Delicious.

This recipe is amazingly easy.  It came out moist and quite delicious.  Not too sweet as the raisins /currants give it enough.  Definitely going to throw some of this together for my next potluck at work :)
