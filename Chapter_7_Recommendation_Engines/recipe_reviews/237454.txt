I'm the submitter of this recipe and I'd like to state that you don't taste the mayo.   It is used to toast the sandwich a golden brown without tearing up the bread.   Thank you to all who try it!

I think the lure to this recipe is the fact that mayonnaise is slathered on the bread instead of soft butter, doesn't really matter what you put inside. Although we made with American cheese and jalapeno pepper-jack as directed, which is a very nice combo. I was amazed how the mayo gave an even browning with a nice crispy crunch without the greasy sogginess that butter can give. You don't taste mayonnaise at all and both my husband and I agree this was a very tasty grilled cheese. The other thing is the mayo didn't burn as fast as the butter does, so we were able to leave the bread on each side long enough for the cheese to melt inside. For us ease is another factor since we live in a hot climate we must store our butter in the fridge, so no more waiting for our butter to soften or brushing on melted butter. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed, just use your favorite mayo.

I'll never make grilled cheese sandwiches any other way again. Spreading the bread with mayo made for perfectly browned and crispy bread on the outside yet it was tender soft on the inside and I loved the combination of American and Pepperjack cheeses. I used 1 slice of each kind of cheese. For anyone thinking your sandwich will taste like mayo - it won't. Great technique SHORECOOK! Thank you for sharing.

I know I'm late to the party, but OMG! I just made this and I swear, I'll never go back to butter again. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about warmed up mayo at first, but I'm so glad I tried it!

I LOVE grilled cheese sandwiches, especially when they are made different from the usual, and I LOVED this one! Made just as written, except I used light mayo, which I was unsure if it would brown properly, but it was fine. The combination of cheese was wonderful and provided just the right amount of 'kick'. Using the mayo is a great idea and a great alternative to when you have no butter or it's too cold to spread. Thanks, SHORECOOK, for the delicious sanwich idea~YUM! :)

Wow what a great sandwich.  I used 12 grain bread instead of white.  With the box grater using the slice side grated up some cheddar cheese, mozzarella and monetary jack cheese (I do not have cheese slices in house).  Then slice some tomatoes.  I cooked the sandwich in my pani maker.  Will be making again.  Thank you SHORECOOK for such a wonderful sandwich.

This is the ONLY method I use for making grilled cheese sandwiches.  The bread is not near as greasy using mayo as it is with butter - and it is delicious! I used this method to make 'Pico De Gallo Grilled Cheese Sandwich' from AR.

I think I'm converted. I don't think I'll ever make another grilled cheese sandwich with butter again. The mayonnaise was so easy to spread and fried the bread to a perfect, crispy, golden brown that had a really nice crunch to it.

In the intro, the submitter said to use your favorite cheese combo, so I used what I had...American cheese and sharp cheddar. The different thing about this recipe is the use of mayo rather than butter on the outside. The outside browns beautifully and has a nice crunchy texture. I don't think I could have told the difference at all if someone else had prepared my grilled cheese for me. Fun! Thanks, Shorecook.

I have made this and it is YUMMY!  In fact, a Man from Carson City Nevada taught me to use Mayo instead of Butter and what I tasted brought back Memories of the Toasted Cheese I used to get  from WoolWorths Grill when I was a Kid!  This Man used to run what he called a "Greasy Spoon" and said that was how all the "BEST "  Eatery's made it!  Not too much Mayo is the Key, too much will be on the Soggy Side where like this recipe calls for, it's just right!  I have not used Butter in years and have also used this recipie for one of the best Tuna Melts you'll ever have!  Brown and Crisp on the outside and Perfect on the Inside!  This Grilled Cheese with a bowl of Tomatoe Soup will bring you back to your Childhood!

While we all know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich and we all probably are creative enough to mix up the cheeses if that is what we want to do, I gave this a 5 star rating because I used the different technique of spreading a little Mayo on the outside instead of butter or margarine and I really liked it. I made it today and it came out far less greasy, nice a crispy, had a beautiful color and it all melted well. There was no Mayo taste at all, it was just a really good grilled cheese sandwich. So the stars are for the technique which I will now use in my own kitchen.  My biggest critic..my husband really liked it as well...it's a new way of doing this.

Mel's diner in jackson. Ca has been using mayo.  to grill their hamburger buns for over 40 yrs that's why there so good. I don't know. why I never thought to use them on grilled cheese. another tip after getting them somewhat brown sprinkle parmesan cheese on the grill. finish browning on one side and then repeat on the other side.  outstanding!

I've heard for years about  using mayo instead of butter when making a grilled cheese sandwich. So last night as I was preparing my grilled cheese,  I  decided to go for it. I have to say I didn't like it. Don't get me wrong, I really like mayo just not as a substitute for butter on a grilled cheese sandwich. I enjoy, and missed, the ever so slight taste of  salty butter that mingles with the melted cheese. I'm sure there are those who really like mayo instead of butter but I'm definitely not one of them!

Love grilled cheese sandwiches with pepper jack cheese (and bacon, LOL).   The only thing I do different is blend softened butter with the mayo.  That way, you get the higher smoke point of the mayo, which allows for the fantastic browning and crispy texture, but with the some of that delicious buttery flavor.

I've made grilled cheese with ALL KINDS of different cheeses but never with pepper jack and I love it! The mayo was great, easy to spread and I tasted no difference. It browned nicely if not better, because butter burns faster than oil. I'll be using mayonfrom now on because it's good and it saves me on butter.

Excellent recipe! I was surprised by the mayo on the bread but it was fantastic; the bread was perfect and golden brown and crunchy. 

The second time making this recipe,  I used caesar salad dressing for a garlicky kick. It turned out great!

Yum!!! I've been reading about using mayo in place of butter & I just had to try it. My sandwich was GREAT! I didn't have any pepperjack (which was disappointing, because I love it), so I used both Sharp Cheddar and Smoked Provolone - absolutely wonderful!

Excellent as is. Next I'll make it with a verrrrry thin slice of onion (a personal favorite) Tastes so special and no extra calories. I wonder how olive oil mayo would work out for  another change.

A friend who is a cook told me her restaurant secret for this and I  have been making grilled cheese this way for years. Everyone in my family loves it!   They know when I'm low on mayo and have to use margarine. It not only tastes better and is crispier, it looks nicer. It gets a golden brown and it's evenly toasty since mayo spreads so much easier than butter or margarine. Any cheese is good to use or even a mixed cheese sandwich. Yummy!

This is very good and I have been doing this for years. I actually alternate between using mayo or brushing the bread with olive oil. Olive oil gives it the same crispy crunch and is very heart healthy.

It was a great change, and I love it.  I also tried Miracle whip, not as crispy but another change to try. It is a five star as far as I am concerned.  I love the little kick in it.  Floss Jennings

I wanted to try this but did not have the pepperjack cheese. I'll definitely try it again when I get ahold of some. Something different with the mayo in place of butter/marg...who knew? Thanks for the recipe, Shorecook.

Delicious.   Made it with Swiss cheese and medium cheddar with slices of turkey.  A sprinkling of pepper and garlic powder.  Wonderful lunch!

This is the only way I will ever make a grilled cheese. I made it with butter recently and that was a mistake. It is greasy and doesn't  have as good of flavor when butter used.  It is easier and like most agree doesn't tear up tne bread.

I've been using mayonnaise for quite awhile now and I really like it better than butter.  I spread a very small amount on the surface of the bread (both outer and inner sides), I find that I use much less mayonnaise than I used to on the inside,  I love the crispness it gives to the surface of the outer side of the bread.  As for the cheese, I use whatever I have on hand other than parmesan!  It's my all time favorite sandwich and I can fix it for a quick meal wherever I am in this world.

Worked perfectly for a gluten free grilled cheese sandwich.  I used Schar's multigrain. Perfectly toasted on the outside and softened the inside just right, with cheese melted too. As with any grilled cheese, just pay attention to avoid burning the bread. This doesn't taste like mayo at all. The bonus is not having bread crumble when trying to spread butter on non-toasted GF bread, which is typically dry (it's possible I'm too rough with spreading the butter on GF bread). My husband has been using butter on the outside of his gluten full bread and mayo on the inside for years, which I refused. He still prefers it his way, but  I prefer this method for my bread. So, thanks for sharing this method/recipe, Shorecook!

I was skeptical at first but I'm a convert! Don't think I will ever make grill cheese with butter again. I used light mayo and it browned the beard perfectly and even better, it didn't smoke my kitchen up like when I use butter:) definitely healthier then butter with the light mayo. I used only American because I didn't have any pepper jack on hand. You don't taste the mayo when the sandwich is done.

I've always used butter, but tried mayonnaise for the first time. The mayonnaise was not detectable (I used the mayonnaise recipe from this site) but I prefer the taste butter lends to a grilled cheese sandwich.

I used wheat bread instead of white and sharp cheddar cheese slices.  Very good with mayonnaise!  I first tried Miracle Whip and wasn't pleased with the results.

I've made it twice and both times enjoyed it. I used American cheese because that is what I had. I found it much tastier than using butter and not greasy. I will be using mayo from now on

I love the pepper jack cheese in this, though I just used one slice of American and one slice of pepper jack. However, I'm just not a fan of the mayo. It did spread nicely, but I missed the buttery flavor that I'm used to on grilled cheese. I'm wondering if using Miracle Whip might give grilled cheese a nice flavor... Thanks for the idea Shorecook-- I still love your recipes!!

I used cheddar in stead and have made it twice already. You don't taste the mayo and you get a nice brown crunchy outside. My kid loves it.

This was a great recipe! Like others, I was a bit concerned about tasting the mayonnaise. However you don't taste the mayonnaise at all and the outside is evenly browned and not nearly as greasy as cooking it the old-fashioned way. Definitely a keeper.

My neighbor told me about mayo instead of butter. So I had to make it and I can't tell you how much I love it.   It browns better and also taste more creamer.  I was also told to try miracle whip, but have not tried it yet, but I will. I will try anything once.  I also put tomato with my cheese and it is so good. I love to experiment with food. Also try some cold cuts, like bologna or chicken, salami or what ever with the cheese.

I liked this sandwich, but I think I'll stick with the traditional method. Either way, a great way to add some flavor, dip it in Worcestershire sauce.

This is a lovely alternative to the grilled cheese sandwich . I don't know how someone said it was "tasteless". But try adding grated Parmesan or Romano cheese, that will kick it up a notch, I call it the "Grown up Grilled Cheese"  The tomato and bacon are a welcome change also.

I didn't taste the Mayo. I made with Mayo and the traditional butter. Both had toasted color and taste good. Either is a fine choice. Good to have options.

To the mayo add a spicy brown mustard & horseradish (both to taste).   It gives it a nice zip but not  to spicy (depending on how much horseradish you use).

I went into this recipe thinking that it would mayo and I was right. The secret is oil. Lightly put mayo on your bread, but don't cook it on that side. Leave the other end bare. Put on your cheese and make sure your sandwich is on medium high heat at least. Once its hot enough, put the sandwich on, wait until its golden brown and take it off the stove. You'll need more oil and let it heat up again. It won't take long and the crispiness won't go away. Put the sandwich back on the other side and cook it. Let it drain and its done. Cooking it on the side with the mayo doesn't really help.

Using the mayo toasts the bread much better than butter and more evenly. I've been making grilled cheese like this ever since I saw them make it this way on the "Chew" TV show  either last year or the year before.

After cooking I added a slice of tomato (sometimes a slice of onion).  The best grilled cheese ever.

I like the addition of pepper jack.  I never have a plain grilled cheese.  My go-to is to add mayo (inside the sammy) and sliced dill pickles ("hamburger dills").  
Or,  if real tomatoes are in season, sliced tomato and mayo.  And of course nice crispy bacon is always a winner on grilled cheese.   The ultimate grilled cheese is to add bacon, tomato and mayo.  My mouth is watering just thinking of it.

I found this recipe today, and I made these for lunch. I had some hoop cheese so I sliced it with pepper jack and American. My husband wanted seconds. These are definitely  a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I got my All Recipe email about this as I was trying to figure out my lunch.  I will always use mayo now and once I figure out the electric stove it will go smoother.  Have always had a gas stove.  I had to go with what I had so I did swiss and ham on whole grain and it is delicious!

I have made grilled cheese sandwiches this way for a long time.  Use any cheese you like, add pickles, tomatoes, any chopped veggie.  You do not taste the mayo and you can use reg mayo or low fat, but use a good grade of mayo.  I think I will go make one now for my lunch.

I've been using mayo instead of butter for years.  You can use a thin layer, so it's less calories.  It crisps up better than with butter and you never tear the bread.  It's also tastier!
