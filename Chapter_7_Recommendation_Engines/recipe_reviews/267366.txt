Great combination of ingredients! I didn't have graham cracker crumbs so I crumbled up sugar cookies. Great way to use Carnation Instant Breakfast packets! Will make again.

This was delicious.  Took a bite and my first thought was cheesecakey:) I had to use vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the raspberry because someone ate the raspberry before I could get to it. So I added just a bit of raspberry extract to it.

I had not tried yogurt mixed with Carnation Breakfast. I really liked the taste of chocolate mixed with the vanilla. This sort of reminded me of a cheesecake flavor as it sat in the fridge a few hours. I have used this product in smoothies and in vitamix ice creams. I will try it again in yogurt. I might just try strawberries next time as they are my favorite. Ty

This is definitely a winner!  Next time though, I will decrease the packet of Carnation to half.  It was just a bit too sweet for me.  Nothing against the recipe, I just don't have much of a sweet tooth.  My husband LOVED it, especially the little addition of whipped cream on top!
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as directed, and it was delicious! Chocolate and raspberry just go together so well, and I loved how the graham cracker crumbs got slightly softened from the yogurt, but still added a nice texture to this parfait. I used Oikos greek yogurt. The Carnation Instant Breakfast blended well with the yogurt. I was worried it might get a little "gritty", but it was perfectly smooth. This will be my new guilt free breakfast or afternoon snack! Thanks Nora!

9.1.18  That chocolate yogurt mixture is divine, I could eat that on its own!   And maybe Iâ€™ll try vanilla Greek yogurt next time instead of plain!  The chocolate flavor certainly is indulgent, the raspberry yogurt with the raspberries is really fresh, and the graham cracker crumbs give some crunchiness and add some texture.  I LUV yogurt, eat it almost every day, and this was a real treat.  What a way to start my day!!
