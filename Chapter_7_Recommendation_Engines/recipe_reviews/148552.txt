While not as creamy as ice cream made with a cooked custard,this is still pretty darn good and couldn't be easier. I used 2 c. heavy cream and 1 c. half and half as I wanted a bit richer and smoother final result. After tasting the mixture I felt it needed another 1/2 tsp. of root beer extract (I used Watkins) and it was perfect. However, this may or not be the case with other brands of root beer extract or root beer concentrate such as McCormick's, so taste first. It DOES taste like a root beer float!

EXACTLY like a root beer float!  I made no changes to the recipe.  While making it I wondered why vanilla extract was being used and not just root beer.  Now I know.  The vanilla extract gives it that vanilla ice cream in the root beer flavor.  I will surely make this when the grandchildren are coming.  Root beer has always been one of their favorite flavors.  This recipe sure brings back memories of the soda fountain days.  Thanks Grace Gutberlet for sharing!

This was the first recipe I've tried for homemade ice cream, and I liked the taste ok, but it was way too rich(even the kids thought so). I made it again with less cream and more milk and it was much better! Of the seven people in my house who tried it, 4 loved it, 2 not so much, and my husband said it tasted like Pepto!

This was pretty good, very creamy.  It really does taste just like a root beer float.  I think that I'll try some with root beer (instead of vanilla ice cream) for a double wammy root beer float!

Sooo good! My son loves root beer popsicles with ice cream in the middle, and sure enough he couldn't get enough of this.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of root beer concentrate though.  Definitely made it more tasty.

I am making this as we speak and it is gorgeous!  As I live in a country where root beer is non-existant I have to rely on the good, kind nature of my family to send me root beer extract.  And if this is the only way to get my root beer fix I don't mind at all!  It does taste exactly how a rootbeer float should taste.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was excellent! Tastes just like root beer floats. Next time, I will add a tiny bit more root beer extract, but other than that it is perfect-thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I normally make custard-based ice cream and was very impressed with the way this came out.  Using my stand mixer, I beat the eggs and sugar for several minutes, then added the extracts, then equal parts heavy cream and fat free half & half.   Like most reviewers, I doubled the amount of root beer extract.  After freezing and ripening, the texture was perfect and the flavor was heavenly.   Plus, so quick and easy!

My son wanted Root Beer ice cream.  This was great! He loved it!  I used half & half because that is what I had.  I also mixed it in my stand mixer.

I love this recipe! I change out the root beer extract for whichever flavor I'm feeling that day and it is great! Sometimes I use just vanilla extract which is great over fresh strawberries, peaches, and over a homemade pie. Great recipe!!

I love root beer floats, but I'm not crazy about this ice cream. A bit rich for my taste.
