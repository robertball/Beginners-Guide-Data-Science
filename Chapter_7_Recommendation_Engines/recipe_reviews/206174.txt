These are delicious!  I modified it to be gluten-free using Bob's Red Mill all purpose GF flour and guar gum, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly.  They are delicious as muffins, and I also tried just putting it in an 8x8 dish and baking it as cornbread - they still came out moist, sweet and flavorfull  :)  Yum!

These are wonderful!!!!!! I modified the recipe to make it gluten-free and mashed the bananas in the Cuisinart (they are harder than a regular banana). They are moist and just the right amount of sweetness. Thank you

Delicious! Try them with butter! In fact, add a little more butter when you're making them.

Thanks for sharing such a creative recipe.  I love plantains and corn muffins, genius idea.  I made these without eggs and use 1/3 cup drained crushed pineapple & 2 cups mashed (almost black ripe) plantains. If you use soy milk and earth balance this would be a vegan muffin.

who knew?  loved them!  made them in advance, froze them and took them on a camping trip.  served w/ chili.  would have made a great breakfast muffin as well.  plantain taste is mild and perfect.  super moist as well...and they still hold together nicely!

These were very tasty but a bit on the sweet side for my taste. I will cut back on the sugar next time.  Thank you for adding yet another fantastic way to use plantains.  In a Cuban/French/American household, you can imagine how many different ways we use them already.

What a great invention!  Ripe plantains are BLACK, by the way.  No need for cuisinnart mixing.  They also are wonderful for amarillos (fried in a little oil).  Serve with pork

These are great warm with butter. After one day the quality rapidly diminishes.

Thanks for a great recipe. Very moist, but it took me almost 30 mins to lightly brown and cook it all the way. Great mix between a corn bread and cake.
My kids and I enjoyed this for breakfast!
I think the texture Of this muffin would render nicely with spicy savory ingredients like corn-bacon-jalape√±o!
Great

Instead of making muffins, I put it in an 8X8 pan.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk.  It took a little longer to bake, but so worth it!  This was so good.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I also think adding some spice to it would be good too.  Will make again.

These were PERFECT, a great recipe when you keep putting off using the last 1 or 2 plantains. They were light, flavorful and delicious, they definitely did not last long in our family of 4.

I tried this using a bunch of substitution, instead of the sugar i used splenda, i used olive oil instead of corn oil and used the silk milk instead of regular milk. Everyone enjoyed it and asked for seconds. It was awesome and healthy. Even the kids enjoyed it.

Surprisingly delicious!  My husband was very skeptical when I told him I was making muffins with plantains...but then he tried them and couldn't stop eating!

Really enjoyed them. Gives them a nice banana flavor and a great way to use plantain.

My rating is more like 4.5. My husband mistakenly bought plantains instead of bananas, LOL! So I needed something to do with them. I'd never used plantains. This was easy and tasty and if I ever get them again, I would use this recipe again.

These are great - store in the fridge for upto a week to maintain quality. Even if my plantains are super ripe I like to boil them in the skins before hand which ensures an easy mash. I cut the sugar and salt in half and added chili flakes and chopped fresh mint. Really great recipe - thanks so much for creating.

You are a genius! All the ways I love plantains this will be another favorite! I changed a couple things only due to staying away from gluten in wheat and still turned out perfect. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of corn meal, left out the sugar. Ripe plantains are so sweet I did not think needed it.I loved that I could make these without the sugar. I made half the batch with some whole kernel corn. Also very good. The corn gives texture, yet sweetness and more of a savory note. These were so moist. I did have to bake for about 23 minutes.Thank you for sharing your great idea! This will be perfect for a spicy black bean soup to balance the heat!

Made this because my husband accidentally bought plantains. This ended up being a great recipe and we will for sure be making them again.

I made three batches today.  One batch for my toddlers using this recipe and adding an additional two tablespoons of ambrosia honey.  The second batch was made for my husband and I just added diced candied jakepenos.  The third batch I substituted milk with almond milk, and flour with almond flour, and added candied jalepenos!  All three turned out great thanks for sharing!
