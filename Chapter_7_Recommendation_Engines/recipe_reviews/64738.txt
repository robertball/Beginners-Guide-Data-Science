There are many variations of this recipe, however due to the omission of mozzarella cheese, this is the one I consider to be authentic. Because this pie is eaten after it cools to room temp or cold, it's also an unnecessary addition and a waste of calories (save it for a plate of juicy tomatoes instead). That being said, if your Nonna made it with mozzarella cheese, by all means add it for the nostalgia (8 ounces ought to be plenty). The fresh parsley is a must and adds a bit of brightness to the dish. Oh, and if you make just one, you'll quickly learn why you should have made two.
