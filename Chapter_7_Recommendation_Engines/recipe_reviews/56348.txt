This is the turkey recipe I used when I roasted my first-ever 19lb bird three years ago.  It turned out perfectly then and has every year since.

My version calls for placing the turkey on a v-shaped rack in the roasting pan.  This allows air to circulate under the bird and should address any issues related to the bottom not cooking as thoroughly as the top or being soggy.  I have never had to turn the bird over.   

Other hints:  truss the wings under the bird with baking string or wrap in aluminum foil to keep from over-browning. For the rest of the turkey, I place the aluminum foil tightly over the breast-portion only.  Then, I remove the foil on the breast 1 hour before the bird is done (my 19lb birds, stuffed, tend to roast in about 5 hours, so I remove at the 4 hour mark).  The breast is always beautifully brown and not overdone; very juicy!  Baste as directed (every 30 minutes) with turkey or chicken stock.  When you check the temperature, be sure you're not hitting the bone; keep it in the fleshy part of the thigh meat.  I also check the internal temperature of the stuffing to ensure it's at 160.  

Standing time is *important.*  I rest mine at least 30 minutes, up to 45. It won't get cold--keeps it juicy!

I use good quality boxed or homemade chicken stock instead of turkey stock.

This is such an easy recipe.  You don't need to over-think it or second-guess it.  It's worked for me every single time.  And...the drippings make delicious pan gravy!  Enjoy!

OH MY GOSH... what a shock to see *my* secret recipe on the internet... lol.  I've always done my turkey mostly this way.  I also put butter under the skin as some reviewers do...  and use chicken broth.  Oh!!  and big ol chunks of onions and celery around, under and in the bird.  But (I don't recommend this method) I put my bird in on 250 degrees late late Wednesday night... don't baste at all, get up early and remove foil, baste REALLY well, turn up the heat to 375 until brown, basting often.  Always excellent!!  Frees up my oven, we wake up to the smell of *Thanksgiving* and it really sets a great mood for the day.  Have done this for years!!

I used this recipe for our Thanksgiving turkey and my family loved it! I put 1/4 cup of butter between the breast meat and the skin, then after each basting I brushed the entire turkey with melted butter. Not the greatest method for calorie counting, but I've never had a turkey so moist. It was incredible!

I made this turkey last year for my first ever attempt at Thanksgiving.  It was so juicy that we barely recognized it as turkey!  One tip for those who don't have a roasting rack and want to avoid the sogginess that is mentioned, place the turkey on top of whole carrots.  The carrots will keep the turkey above the broth, and this way you can use a disposable aluminum roaster.  I followed the recipie to a T last year, but this year I'm going to add some citrus in the cavity and some lemon zest and parsely to the butter.  This is a great recipie as is, but it is so simple that its easy to add your own flair.  The broth in the bottom is really what gets the amazing results!

This is a great recipe to follow for a traditional turkey for the holidays.  I never used stock in the bottom of the pan before and it added great flavor to the gravy.  I have been making turkey for T-day for 27 years now.  I suggest the following additions: choose a fresh turkey, rub softened butter under the skin of the turkey breast too, and put the turkey in the oven @ 425 for the first 1/2 to 1 hour (especially if it is right out of the fridge, or plan on adding cooking time).

This is a great method. As stated in other reviews, definitely cover only the breast portion of the Turkey, and remove an hour before cooking time is finished. One helpful tip is to be sure loosen the skin from the breast, and actually place mayonnaise inside. I found that adding your seasonings and herbs, like sage, paprika, and garlic to mayo helps them to "stick" to the bird better while cooking - it creates such beautiful, brown skin, also.     I don't like to have to keep opening my oven and basting a turkey. Every time you open your oven, you can lose up to 20 degrees of heat! To get around this, I peel, core, and slice 1 apple (any variety that I have lying around) and slide the slices under the skin as well. The sweetness of the apple, as it roasts under the skin, handsomely offsets the saltiness, keeps the breast moist, and basting at a minimum. I still baste once or twice, with the drippings that accumulate in the roasting pan, but not nearly as often as I did in previous years. My turkey was excellent, and the gravy was wonderful.     Also, If you don't want to stuff the turkey with stuffing, place it in a separate pan to cook, and use turkey stock to moisten. That way, you can fill your cavity with quartered onions, more sliced apples, and celery, adding additional moisture inside, and enhancing the drippings and flavor outside. Hope this helps!

Made this last night.  Make sure that you put a bit of butter between the skin and the meat...like another reviewer suggested, and don't forget to baste the turkey.  It turned out wonderful and so moist.  This is definatly a great basic and easy turkey recipe.  Thanks for the post.

This was my first attempt at a turkey and I'm sure I must have done something wrong, but I can't figure it out.  I had a 16 lb turkey and followed this recipe exactly.  I even set a timer to baste every 30 minutes as instructed.  The turkey "looked" perfect, like out of a movie or something. However, after 5 1/2 hours of cooking, this turkey was still not totally cooked.

I used this recipe as a base and adjusted it a little. I cooked a 21lb turkey added fresh chopped sage to the butter and put it under the skin of the breast as well as over the top and seasoned with salt and pepper (inside and out). Instead of stuffing the bird, I heated a whole orange in the microwave for 1 minute and punctured it all over with a knife and placed that inside the bird with fresh rosemary and sage sprigs.  I covered the entire roasting pan with foil instead of just the bird, to keep in the broth (this made more seasoned broth for gravy) and basted every 30 minutes, removing most of the foil after about 3 hours. Total cook time was about 5 1/2 hours and turkey was moist and flavorful - got rave reviews from the 20 family members it served!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks Trudie!

This was my first turkey I made and it was so easy! The meat is so juicy, i was so surprised. I basted every hour for the first 2.5 hours and then for the second half i basted every 30 minutes. Also I put butter, salt and pepper between the skin and the breast meat. I also made gravy out of the drippings and it was also delicious (but a bit salty). I am glad this was so successful since it was my first turkey that I made myself, and I am only 17 years old. woohoo! If this is your first time roasting a turkey I strongly suggest you use this recipe, its pretty hard to go wrong with this. Happy roasting!

Brilliant!  I've been cooking turkey's for Thanksgiving for 30 years and this is by far the best recipe. I've always put the foil on after browning but this recipe has you put it on before browning which makes it very moist.  I also made the perfect gravy. Finally, I made the Perfect Gravy. Thanks!

Made my first (19 lb) turkey using this recipe and it turned out amazing! Not only did it look like something that should be on the cover of a magazine but even the white meat was so moist you didn't need a knife to cut through the carved pieces! The only changes I made: 1. I used chicken stock (made from a buillion w/o MSG) because I didn't have turkey stock on hand 2. I threw in some fresh rosemary at the bottom of the pan as well as a parsnip, a carrot and a small squash - all cut up in big pieces - which I placed just under the turkey. 3. I used just under the half cup of butter asked for (it just seemed like a lot). Probably used about a tablespoon less. 4. I cooked the turkey to an internal temperature of 170 because I didn't stuff it.  Perfect!

This last year we had Thanksgiving at our house for the first time. It was our first time cooking a turkey and this recipe made us look like pro's! I followed the advice of others (rub butter under the skin and wrap the wings with foil) and the recipes instructions to a T. It was perfect! Everyone asked what recipe we used! Thank you so much for this recipe Syd!

I have been making my turkeys for years using this method and it is flawless as long as you baste, baste, baste, and baste often. I prefer the toss away disposable roasting pans and ZI've never had any trouble. I make my own stock to start the ball rolling by cooking the gizzards, neck, etc. in a pot of water and using this water. Pet cats in the house will love you for cooking these otherwise disposable items (not the neck of course). This year I will be trying what other readers have advised and start cooking the turkey breast side down and turning it over for the last hour or so depending on the size. I will also be adding cut up onions to the bottom of the pan. I have found that a good rule of thumb is to gauge the cooking time to at least 20 minutes per pound and adding a little extra time to compensate for the repeated basting. I also have never prepared the turkey by rubbing it down under the skin before cooking and I am excited about doing that this year. I absolutely love this site and so does my family-LOL.  I cover the wing tips for the entire cooking time and cover the entire bird with foil until the last hour or so. I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and my thanks to all that participate on this site.

This is a simple, delicious, classic way to cook a turkey. Use this recipe as a solid foundation each time you cook a turkey. Experiment with different herbs, and rubs etc. Always keep the ingredients mentioned, but feel free to add some new ones!
I always make sure to rub the butter underneath the skin where I can too. Especially right underneath the skin on top of the turkey's breast. Delicious!

To the reviewer who stated that her turkey was not completely cooked after 5.5 hours: There is a really good chance that you did not properly thaw your turkey. It is supposed to take almost 5 hours per pound to thaw in the fridge. Some turkeys will even take longer!

This turkey was awesome! Moist and juicy on the inside. Golden brown on the outside; the only complaint I would have is that when the turkey gets tented in aluminum foil for so long,it tends to take longer to bake.My turkey,which was 12# took 4 1/2 hrs. I've read in other reviews that tenting does extend the bake time,but the results are worth it. You just have to plan on extra bake time. I plan on making it this way again,the next time my meal calls for a delicious turkey :)

I followed this recipie, but used sage and pepper on top of the turkey instead of salt and pepper.  The biggest problem I had was the cooking time.  I had a 9lbs turkey (if that) and after four - five hours at the temperature suggested it still was not cooked (just the thighs) and not really sure why....

I was strictly looking for time & temp instrux, & as usual, slow&low is the way 2 go! Mine took slightly longer than 4 hrs & I jacked up to 400 toward the end for crispy skin, but still VERY juicy. I used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning in lieu of S&P. Also, I prefer my dressing baked outside of the bird & stuffed the cavity with an onion, celery stalk & carrot.

This was my first turkey I've ever made by myself, and it turned out amazing.  The color was so beautiful.  Thank you Syd for making me a star cook this Thanksgiving.  (I did follow other suggestions such as adding butter and apple slices under the skin and quartered onions, celery and apples inside the cavity.)

I had fun basting, but my 20 lb turkey took much too long to cook through.  Although my turkey spent a week in the fridge defrosting, I suspect it may not have been fully thawed. So instead of having a perfectly golden browned, juicy turkey at 4 to 5 hours of cooking, I had a dry dark brown turkey at 7 hours of cooking.  It still tasted good, and the drippings made delicious gravy, but I didn't have the juicy bird I was hoping for.  However, I can't find fault with the recipe for my dry bird.  Next time I'll try a smaller bird that's completely, undoubtedly thawed.

I had made more complicated recipes in the past (including brining and using elaborate spices) and none of them turned out as perfect as this simple recipe did! It looked beautiful and it was juicy and tender! What an easy, perfectly delicious recipe!

This was my first time roasting a turkey for Christmas this year, and I have to say this recipe made everything so easy! I did have a self-basting turkey that I got free from the store, but I did rub light margarine inside and out, as well as under the skin, then I brushed the outside with olive oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, savory, rosemary, thyme, and crushed bay leaves. I put a quarter of a white onion, a quarter of a celery stalk, and a baby carrot in each corner of the roasting pan, along with the turkey stock. I did take one other reviewer's suggestions and put my stuffed 12 pounder in at 425 without covering with foil for an hour, and then turned it down to 325. After another 30 minutes, the breast was nicely browned. I brushed it with more olive oil, and although it was self basting, I still poured some turkey stock over it. I tented the entire pan with foil. An hour later, the turkey was done! The white meat was so juicy, and the gravy only needed cornstarch to thicken -- no seasoning necessary. My in-laws were impressed. A really wonderful experience for a first timer. Thanks for such an easy, straightforward recipe. Editing to add that I did this again last night using a stuffed (bread stuffing) chicken, and scaling the ingredients down to the size I was using. I didn't add the onion, carrot or celery to the drippings because I wasn't planning on making potatoes at first. I never even covered the chicken, and it was delicious in 1 1/2 hrs

I roasted my firrst ever turkey using this recipe and it worked a treat.  A perfect, moist bird that was a hit with the whole family.  I have to admit, I forgot to baste in the first hour and a half of cooking, but as there was plenty of stock in the roasting pan, it didn't seem to matter. Just lovely.

This was my first time roasting a turkey. It turned out beautifully - a crisp, golden brown skin and very juicy meat. Only complaint is that so much juice stayed in the bird that I had to use chicken broth in my gravy, as there weren't many drippings. Definitely worth it, though - I can't ever remember Thanksgiving turkey being so juicy. Tip: Always let the turkey sit after you pull it out of the oven. I've had turkey carved immediately and carved after a half hour or so, and it's definitely juicier when you give it a chance to rest and reabsorb the juices.

Great way to roast a turkey!  I have a roasting pan with a lid.  I roasted the turkey with the lid on for the first two hours and then removed the lid for the last part of the cooking time.  I rubbed the turkey with butter and added chicken broth to the pan as per the directions.  I did not bother with basting the turkey while I had the lid on.  I did baste about every 30 minutes after I removed the lid.  The result was a very moist bird with beautiful crisp skin.  One other suggestion, I like to buy a fresh bird whenever possible.

This was only my second time making a turkey - last year's Thanksgiving was my first (and I forgot to take the giblets out which gave my mother in law a good laugh!).  This year it turned out much better!  I followed the advice of this recipe and used fresh ground sea salt and black pepper, and in place of the butter sprayed olive oil all over the turkey (much less likely to burn the skin than butter is).  The aluminum foil tent worked great because it helped keep moisture in and also kept the skin from browning too quickly.  We pulled the tent off with about a half hour cooking time left in the oven.  Instead of stuffing this bird with bread stuffing, I did that in the crockpot (see 'Slow Cooker Stuffing' recipe on this website, it worked great!) and in the bird went a few cut up onions and some minced garlic.  Smelled amazing while roasting....a 19lb. bird took exactly 5 hours.  Also let it rest for a half hour out of the oven.  Also, I had a self-basting turkey (one of those free frozen ones that have the 8% broth solution added) so I did not baste at all which made things easy, and used chicken broth in place of the turkey stock for the bottom of the pan.  When I want a good old easy standby turkey recipe, this is what I will make.  Thank You!

I made my first turkey for Thanksgiving. I used this as a base for the cooking aspect as I was unsure of how to cook it. The only things done differently was I used a Cajun seasoning blend made by my local meat market (it is native to the South). I also injected almost a whole bottle of Creole Butter marinade. For basting I used Swanson Chicken Stock (not broth). Poor turkey, he didn't stand a chance once he was out of the oven. The thing was seriously demolished.

not that this needs more rave reviews but this came out fantastic.  It was my first turkey and I cooked it in an electric roaster, popping it in the oven for 30 min just to brown it a bit more.  Came out moist, brown and amazing.  I am now the official Thanksgiving chef in my family

Yes, this is the way I made my turkey last year and will be doing it again.  My roaster is an older one and it does not have one of those racks to keep the turkey off the bottom - so I put a few large carrots on the bottom of my roaster and set the turkey on that. Works really well.  Not sure where I got that tip - maybe it was here.

This was my first time making a Thanksgiving turkey, and while I was nervous- it turned out to be SO easy and tasted GREAT (very juicy).
I followed this recipe but made the following changes:
1. I added a couple carrots, an onion and celery around the turkey in the pan.
2. I also rubbed butter salt and pepper under the breast skin (this was easier to do then I thought it would be.)
3. I only covered the turkey (breast only) with aluminum foil until I had about 2 hours left, and then removed the foil from the breast.

The turkey came out PERFECT (looked golden brown evenly on whole turkey) and was also very juicy from basting every 30 minutes.

I had a 15 lb turkey and it took about 4 1/2 hours to cook. I used a meat thermometer.

This is a good guide line to follow. I use my giblets from the turkey to boil in chicken stock with onions and celery, for the stuffing. I've really never had to put stock or water in the pan, the turkey makes enough. And using a digital thermometer is so handy, just pop it in the thigh when you start, when it reaches 175* take the turkey out because the tempeture still riseses.

This was only my second attempt to roast a turkey and I was soooo happy with the results!! The turkey was so unbelievably moist. I don't think I've ever had such a tender and moist bird! My dad always smoked ours outside or my mom has done it in the oven but really I think my bird tasted better than theirs. I had a 14 pounder and it took about 3 hrs 15 mins. I did tent my turkey and put the stock in the pan. I have to admit that I wasn't sure what "tenting" meant so I looked it up and watched a video! I didn't realize that the turkey isn't completely covered; hence the tent. The foil is sealed on both sides but not the ends of the pan. I refilled it a couple of times when it seemed to be evaporating but I never basted it. It was too hard to try and scoop the stock out from the pan since I had my turkey on a rack so I kinda gave up and hoped for the best. I didn't have a thermometer nor did I have a turkey where the little thingy pops out so I was really nervous about it being under and overcooked. My husband said he loved it and he's not a huge turkey fan. I feel so confident now and u will, too, after roasting your turkey this way. Thank u for sharing your recipe, Syd!!!

Just like the name says. Simply Perfect.  I used to brine or dry cure my turkey, which was a chore because I have to make a large turkey. But this turns out perfectly every time. I put the neck and gibblets in the roasting pan and there are plenty of juices to make the perfect turkey gravy.

I used a 15-pound turkey and went easy on the salt because I used salted sweet cream butter. I also added poultry seasoning and black pepper. The only thing I wanted to comment on, really, is the turkey stock-I looked everywhere for premade, canned turkey stock to no avail and there was NO WAY I was going to make my own-so instead, I used Swanson's chicken broth and it still turned out wonderfully! This was the first turkey I've made and I was so happy to have a good guideline to follow. Thank you!

I made this recipe for my turkey last night but because my friend has a dairy allergy, I substituted mayo for the butter rubbed on the turkey. I ended up uncovering it sooner as well to let the mayo melt, maybe after an hour and a half instead of two and a half. The gravy I made with the drippings was one of the best I have ever made. 
Thanks for the easy delicious recipe!

I used this recipe and the result was very good. I changed a few things: Used garlic & herb compound butter under the skin and all over the bird and put five halved cloves of garlic in cavity and around the birds, as well as chopped onion and four celery stalks. Mine only required 2 cups of stock, maybe because I brained it first. It was very good and beautiful. I had a lot of drippings that made perfect gravy.

this gets 5 stars because of how easy this is, especially for the first time turkey roaster, like me. my friends and i decided to have an impromptu thanksgiving meal on the hottest day so far this year, and i had to cook the turkey. the bird was so moist and perfectly browned when it was done. i stuffed it with my mom's sausage stuffing and sewed it shut. rubbed it with lots of butter and put butter under the skin between the breast like some other reviewers did. basted every half hour and it took 5 1/2 hour for a 19lb bird. the only thing i did a little differently was to cover the drumsticks for the first hour so they didn't overcook ( my mom said to do that, lol)  oh, and i only cooked to 165 degrees and let it carryover for a half an hour. it was perfect. not too dry and cooked all the way through, even the stuffing.this really is a fool-proof method to cook a turkey. use this if you've never cooked a turkey, or if you've never cooked a good turkey. i promise it will come through for you.

I followed the recipe pretty much except that I didn't add the water/chicken stock to the pan until after drippings had browned quite well.  That made for a great gravy.  I didn't tent the turkey either, and it turned out quite nicely brown.  I spread butter slabs under the skin on each side of the turkey.  I think an important thing to do is use a meat thermometer, too.  I cooked the turkey until it was 180 degrees in the thickest part of the breast meat.  It turned out to be the best turkey I've ever made.  It was moist and done just right.

Great roast turkey, a little on the plain side. I added a ton of herbs (Thyme, Garlic Powder, Marjoram, Savory, Bay Leaves) to the rub, and it made a big difference.

My first roast turkey ever and it was perfect!  Used the stuffing recipe from another turkey on this site.  Placed it on top of carrots. Used chicken broth and didn't need even half as it never dried up.  Also, my family is Hispanic so I always add oregano to the salt/pepper mix.  The turkey was moist, flavorful, very delightful.  My family was quite impressed.

I have roasted many turkeys, but this was the best turkey ever!  I did make a few changes; I did the first 1/2 hour at 425 and then lowered the temp to 325.  I used a mixture of melted butter and olive oil.  I used Penzey's poultry seasoning instead of the salt and pepper.  I used chicken broth and found I did need to add some every 1/2 hour.  Fantastic recipe!

I'll try this now as we're having a delayed holiday meal. For Mandy- the general rule for cooking a turkey is 20 minutes per pound and extra for a stuffed turkey. So even an unstuffed 21 lb. turkey might've taken 7 hrs. When basting- if you're not quick about it, it'd be better to remove the pan and shut the oven door to do your basting. This way, you're not constantly lowering the temperature of the oven.

The results of this recipe were amazing!  I did not stuff my turkey, so it cooked in 3.5 hrs - the meat was tender and juicy and very flavourful.  A great simple recipe - a keeper, thanks!

My turkey turned out very moist.  I couldn't find turkey stock, so I bought chicken.  I made my own turkey stock by boiling the gizzards and neck with Mrs. Dash table seasoning and garlic.  I added a little of the chicken stock to it.  My 18 and a halfer took @6 1/2 hrs to cook, so I'm not sure about that 4hrs written for only a half pound less.  It was well worth the wait.

I made this last year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. And both my father-in-law and husband both said that it was the juiciest turkey they had ever had. My rosting pan was larger than the turkey so I had to add a lot more than one to two cups of stock. The recipe was easy to make and will be my holiday turkey recipe from now on.

Excellent recipe! I rubbed some butter mixed with rosemary between the skin and the breast for extra moistness. I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock and basted every half and hour or so, replacing the stock as necessary. The turkey was SO moist and delicious! It received rave reviews from everyone. A definite keeper!

I was getting ready to print this recipe for the third year in a row and realized I hadn't reviewed it yet.

I've been making turkeys for 30 years now, and this is my favorite go-to recipe.  It's easy, doesn't require a lot of fuss, and the turkey comes out fantastic.  Perfect for Thanksgiving. I also love keeping a turkey in my freezer, then when we have a big snowfall coming, defrost the night before and make a big ol' turkey dinner.

I am usually really pathetic at roasts of any kind - I had actually given up. However, for the first time my husband and kids and I had Christmas at home without other relatives (who usually do the cooking). We had to have turkey! Well - my goodness - this was truly the perfect turkey - and looked like something you see in a cooking magazine. It was a beautiful thing!  ;-) 

If I can have such success - anyone can! Really!!

Pretty straight forward.  My only suggestion is to roast thighs up, and I promise yout turcky will be supremely moist.  
* must use meat thermometer.
* must allow to stand for 15 minutes to rest the meat.

I have always made my turkey this way but I put it in a turkey baking bag.  The bird browns and is super moist, no basting at all.  I also put fruit in the bird not stuffing.

My turkey was so tender it fell off the bone.  I used a 7 pound turkey breast, and added 1 tsp. each of sage, poultry seasoning, and seasoned salt to 1/2 stick of butter and placed it under the skin.  I put this in my crock pot for 12 hours with chicken stock rather than turkey stock, and cannot say enough good things about how easy and wonderful this tasted.  Thanks for making my first attempt at cooking turkey sure to be a repeat performance.

Forget about the aluminum foil tent, unless you like steamed turkey.  Instead, soak a clean porous cloth in melted butter and cover the turkey in it.  Baste over and under the cloth every 10 minutes.  Otherwise this is a good recipe.

I searched many sites for a good easy basic turkey recipe and this was the best one. My Turkey turned out moist and delicious. I stuffed the turkey with the bread and celery stuffing recipe on this same site and I had a huge hit. Thanks Allrecipes!

I have tried to cook turkeys different ways, different brands, fresh, frozen, organic and wild. I needed some valuable space in my freezer, so out came a free 15# I got last Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe as shown, I got a beautiful centerpiece bird for my 12 guests, that was moist and cooked to perfection. Sad thing, not many leftovers. You cant miss with this recipe.

I've tried many different roast turkey recipes over the years, but this is the basic and tried and true.  I used a 12 lb turkey and cooked it just under 3.5 hours.  Used a large enamel roasting pan and rack and used the roasting lid instead of foil.  Basted every 45 min. and uncovered for the last hour.  I let it rest 30 min semi covered and it was perfect.  I added carrots, celery and onion to the bottom of the pan before roasting and the juices made a beautiful gravy while the bird rested.  Thanks for posting this easy and true roast turkey recipe.  I have found after all of the variations I have tried, this is simply the best.

I made this last night for an early Thanksgiving meal and it was amazing! My BF doesn't really like turkey because he says it is always dry... He loved this and was shocked at how juicy and flavorful it was! I made a spice rub instead of just salt and pepper and it added so much to it without taking away from the turkey flavor, I omitted the stuffing and put an onion, some celery, and baby carrots,and butter in the cavity instead. Also seasoned inside and out and under the skin.

Fantastically delicious! This recipe offers my fave method for a juicy, tender and golden brown bird. Since I tried this recipe 2 years ago, my family has me cook the turkey every thanksgiving, christmas and easter, which fills me with so much pride and joy - thank you mum and grandma.

My first turkey turned out perfect! Didn't stuff with stuffing - don't like my stuffing soggy from inside a bird - so I stuffed it with 2 whole onions and a couple celery sticks instead.

This was very good. However since I eat very little of the bottom of the bird, I cooked it for the first couple of hours breast side down. This allows all of my stuffing spices to seep into the breast. I then turn it and continue cooking. Try it. I think you will love it!

Awesome, thanks for the help.  Cooked my first thanksgiving dinner this year and it turned out great.  The only thing i had to change was that i took the foil off after 2 and a half hours as instructed, but it browned so fast that half an hour later i had to put the foil back on.  Nonetheless, the broth made making gravy a cinch. Oh i also put a few strips of bacon on the top of the bird..something I can always remember my mom doing.

I tried this recipe and loved it. Not only did my Turkey come out of the oven picture perfect It was crispy yummy skin on the outside and yummy moist on the inside! All though I leave chicken broth and carrots, celery and onions in the bottom of the pan and baist the turkey with those juices every 30 to 45 minutes.

Excellent and easy way to make a turkey that tastes great and comes out looking picture perfect.  Used chicken stock instead of turksy stock because that's all that was left at the store.  Be sure to baste every 30 minutes.  Excellent!

As most of the other reviewers, this was my first turkey. It turned out wonderful, I got rave reviews! The only change I made was only using 1 stick of butter instead of 2, but that was plenty. Update: I've made it several times now and it always turns out perfect! I've started sprinkling a little bit of sage on top, too, and that is great!

As is the tradition in my house I baked this turkey the day after Thanksgiving.  We go to relatvies houses on Thanksgiving day.  The Turkey turned out really well.  I froze the leftovers for future meals and it was good then too.

Excellent!  Made such a moist turkey!  We changed 2 small items: We did not put the stuffing in the turkey.  That was done separately.  And, we did not use canned stock.  We made our own stock using the neck, gibblets, onions, etc.  I think it improved the taste immensely.  The only thing we put inside the turkey while it was cooking was an entire bulb of garlic.  Simple.  Easy.  And very, very good!

Excellent recipe! This is the way I cook my turkeys (except I do not cover them with the foil at the beginning of cooking. If they start to over-brown, then I will tent towards the end, but this is rarely an issue, to be honest). For those who found their turkey wasn't cooked after many hours in the oven, one of three things was the culprit: 1) you might have overstuffed your turkey making it difficult to cook it clear through to the center. 2) you didn't have your oven temp correct, or 3) your turkey was not totally thawed. And to be honest, for those who found their turkey turned out rubbery or dry, sometimes it's not the cooking method, but the bird itself. Not all are created equal. Perhaps try a different brand of turkey next time and see if you get better results. And just a side note: I do not stuff my turkey, I make my dressing on the side and bake it in its own dish, so my turkeys always cook perfectly and in a timely manner and come out moist and delicious.

This is my usual turkey method.  To avoid losing heat during basting, I find it helpful to kick up the heat to 450 while the oven is open and then turn it back down about minute after you close the door again.

This came out incredibly delicious and moist. I used a little more butter thoughout basting but otherwise it was awesome. Usually ham is the hit for us but this turkey made everyone rave!

This was my first time cooking a turkey and it turned out fabulous!  I didn't use stuffing inside, instead I used garlic, onion, carrots, and celery.  It was great!  I basted about every 45 minutes and it was very juicy!  I also put rosemary and thyme in the pan.  I still found the white meat dry, but I've never had white meat turkey that wasn't dry, just the way it is I think!  My boyfriend said it was the juiciest turkey he had ever seen!  He couldn't get enough of the dark meat!  I'm using bones to make turkey stock today!  Thanks for making my first Thanksgiving turkey excellent!

This was my first Thanksgiving meal that I had ever cooked. I'm only 20 and decided to feed 14 of my friends. I didn't skimp on anything! I had a 20 lb bird and stuffed that sucker with some stuffing. It came out AMAZING. I was so worried that I would somehow mess something up. I had never cooked a whole bird, so I was REALLY worried about the color of the outside. I perservered and the end result was outstanding! I was so proud of myself, and so were my parents. The only thing I changed was I boiled my giblets the night before along with the neck and the celery and onion for my stuffing. I used that broth to baste my bird. It is a total no hassle way to cook a turkey!

I used this recipe for my first time making turkey and was amazed at how juicy it came out for such a simple recipe! This is definitely the recipe that I will use now for all my holiday dinners because it is so fail-proof :-) The only things I changed was I omitted the stuffing and used chicken broth instead of turkey broth and it still came out perfect. I'll probably stuff it with onion, garlic and some herbs this year for added flavor and will use seasoning salt and garlic powder to season the outside because I like those flavors :-) That's what's so amazing about this recipe: you can add your own flair to at as long as you have the broth part down ;-)

Moist and delicious!  Our 16 lb bird was done in about 3 hours, but stayed warm and moist in an oven on very low heat unil we were ready to carve it.

This recipe made my first attempt at a turkey (on Christmas Day, no less) a HUGE success. (I even think it was comparable to my MIL's!) Thanks so much!

Turned out perfectly.  I had about 20 guests over Christmas day who agree.  Definitely my new go-to recipe for turkey roasting.  Thanks.

This is the most perfect way to roast a turkey.  The key is the basting - as often as every 30 minutes.  Read all these reviews and got a good chuckle as I'm unsure how one can forget to remove giblets before stuffing, lol, but I guess it does happen!

This is a great simple recipe and just the foundation I was looking for this year.  I always work a good amount of butter under the skin and over the skin.  This year I mixed the butter with garlic and Italian herbs and since I was trying to simplify things this thanksgiving I used the herb mix you find in the squeeze tube in the vegetable section of the grocery store.  Also brining is a must!  I always brine and it makes the turkey juicy and delicious.

Keep an eye on the liquid in bottom of the pan that it doesn't completely evaporate.  Caught mine in time just before it burned. Thankfully it made the best rich gravy ever.  Great recipe.

Wow, this was the best turkey I've ever made. It was so juicy that even when cutting the juice was pouring out. I usually am not a fan of turkey because of it's dryness, but not this one. Unless someone can show me a better recipe to cook turkey, I'm sticking to this one. I had a 16.5 pound turkey, pre-heated oven to 425 and cooked uncovered for 30 minutes, then turned oven down to 325 and continued until done. Thanks again Trudie for a wonderful recipe!

This turkey was BEAUTIFUL!! It looked like something out of a magazine when it finished. I went exactly by the recipe and it is fail proof. The breast was juicy and tender and the dark meat was cooked to perfection. I usually go by my mothers recipe (sorry mom) but this will be on my table every Thanksgiving from here on out. Anything less than 5 stars would be an insult to this bird. Thanks Trudie!!!

I decided to make the extra turkey I had left over from Christmas and used this recipe. When I was ready to put in the oven, I realized that I did not have any Turkey stock, but I did have chicken stock on hand. Well, I used that instead and it still turned out great. The turkey was tender and juicy. I will definetly use this recipe again when preparing turkey, except I will make sure I have turkey stock on hand.

This was so easy! Not sure if it was the basting it every 30 minutes or the butter rub, but the turkey was tender, flavorful, and roasted up beautifully!

I have the secret.  You cannot ruin a bird...you can't overcook it.  If you do slightly overcook it, the dark meat will be finally done completely...if you know what I mean..ever turkey you have ever seen has it.  You will not see the streaks of uncooked dark meat.  The secret, a five gallon bucket and a 20 pound bird...(size does not matter).  Brining is it.  I will NEVER do a bird without it.  This recipe is perfect...but brining makes it completely fool proof.  3/4 cup sugar, salt, tablespoon of pepper, cup of boiling water per gallon of water for brine.  You melt the sugar and salt in the boiling water, put it in the water to make the brine.  I use about half a gallon of ice to keep the water good and cold..then put the bucket in the fridge.  The first time my wife saw that, she freaked.  Now she just parts the red sea (full refrigerator) and removes a shelf or two.  Brine is the secret...no way to mess a turkey again.

Great recipe / technique.  This was a moist turkey and I didn't mind eating the leftovers.  I put 1/4 of the butter in between the skin and the meat.  Used chicken stock since I didn't have turkey stock.  Delicious!  I wonder how to get the bottom of the turkey to brown though.

I used this recipe for this Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey I have made so far.  It was tender and juicy even the breast which I always manage to dry up.  I did use chicken broth cause I couldn't find turkey but it did just fine.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

My plan was to put my turkey in the rotisserie, only to discover that morning it was too long!  My option was to cut down his legs or find another way to cook him. Thank you to the poster of this recipe.  I followed directions exactly and everyone thought I had been cooking turkey's for years!  The white meat was perfectly moist. Thank you for a Wonderful Christmas Meal!

Hurray! I finally made a good turkey. Thanks so much for this simple recipe. I used an 18 lb bird and followed this exactly with the exception of using chicken stock instead of turkey stock in the pan, and I used more butter for basting. I roasted the bird in a large, disposable aluminum pan. I just love the simplicity of this recipe and will make it again!

This turkey was simple and delicous.  I didn't have turkey stock so I used 2 cups of chicken stock and basted every hour (4 1/2hrs)  If I ran out of chicken stock in the roasting pan I just kept adding 2 cups of chicken stock to the roast.  As well I placed the turkey on a rack and created a tent of tin foil around the turkey.  Between a consistent amount of stock in the bottom of the roasting pan and the enclosure around the turkey the meat was very moist and I had a great base for gravy left over.

I have been cooking turkey for many years and I must say that this recipe is the best by far. I used it for Christmas Day and everyone said it was the best turkey they ever had. Thanks Nellie!

This turkey tasted fantastic.  Now, after years of struggling to figure out the best and easiest way to make a good amount of rich turkey gravy, I have the answer.  I didnt have any turkey stock but had plenty of chicken broth.  I used this at the bottom of the pan along with the neck, giblets, whole carrots, celery stalks, 2 small onions and a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary and made some of the best gravy ever.  I made sure to use a fat seperater cup though.

I used this recipe for my first ever turkey, and it turned out beautiful! Golden brown, juicy and moist. It was a big hit, everyone was super impressed. I used the suggestion of placing it on a rack, which really helped keep the bottom from becomming soggy. Easiest and tastiest turkey ever. I'll be using this one for christmas as well.

I'm pretty sure I did something wrong! Though I don't know how! Haha. The breasts were great & perfect. They had so much moisture & flavor, but the legs weren't even done. We had to throw them away. I barely had enough for my guests. I guess I'll try again. Maybe I missed something because I was so busy making everything else too.

I used this recipe for my first Thanksgiving as a newlywed hosting my in-laws!  I substituted vegetable shortening for butter (husband is allergic to dairy), and the turkey came out perfect and golden brown!  Even my mother-in-law was impressed! : )

This was my first turkey and OMG!! It was wonderful, per myself and the 13 people I had over for Thanksgiving. I had a 20.5lb turkey and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock. I also did not stuff it and cooked it for approx 5 1/2 hours and let it cool for 1 hour. I was told this was one of the prettiest and juiciest turkeys that had been seen and I was not dealing with an easy crowd.Also, I cooked on 425 for the 1st 45 mins or so and I covered the wings and the breast.

i give this a 5 on the cooking temperature and time... As far  as seasoning I used Chef John's recipe. I also soaked my turkey in a brine  first.  This was my first attempt at making a turkey and it was devoured. Even my husband who really doesn't care for turkey went back for seconds.

This is the way my mom in law has always done the bird and was kind enough to teach me over 20 years ago. Simple, delicious, and always makes me smile when folks say its so hard to make a beautiful bird.

This was my first time not using turkey bags. It was the best turkey ever! Perfectly golden brown and crunchy skin, perfectly moist and juicy meat, exceptional flavor, just all around perfect and delicious. I will never make turkey any other way again, ever.
The only thing I skipped was the stuffing. I don't like cooking stuffing inside the turkey.

I used this recipe to make my very first turkey this year. It was delicious!  The turkey turned out very juicy. The recipe was so simple but the results were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly even though others gave some great suggestions.  Definitely going to use this recipe next year.

My turkey came out amazing! Very juicy and golden brown. I rubbed some butter under the skin, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. My 19 lb turkey (only stuffed with an onion and garlic) took 3 hours and 45 minutes. This will be my go to turkey recipe from now on!

I've never rated a recipe here before, but this recipe exceeded all my expectations. I've never made a turkey that looked this beautiful and tasted even better it was moist and delicious. I've added this to my favorites and will be my go-to turkey recipe for many Thanksgivings to come. Yum!!

This turkey turned out Great! I used the recipe and made a few alterations..Not many..I put chicken broth and white wine on the bottom of the roasting pan. and when it was finished I covered it with foil and put towels over it. Ate it an hour later and it was so moist and still very warm.. Hands Down the best Thanksgiving turkey I ever made and so simple. Will do this every year!

Just made this delicious turkey...couldn't ask for a more moist, delicious bird!! The only thing you should note is to make sure the stuffing has enough turkey stock on it...Mine ended up not having enough, so the stuffing was a bit dry.  Over all fantastic recipe though!!

I had such fears roasting such a big bird, especially for the first time, but this recipe totally helped me out. The turkey turned out succulent, juicy and simply delicious. Like many others, I did not put stuffing in the bird, but i made it separately.  One mistake I did was to either use too many lemons or should have not left the lemon wholes in the turkey/tray. It made my gravy a lil bitter. Otherwise, it turned out exceptional. Thanks for sharing!

This year was my first time making a turkey for thanksgiving and I have to say it turned out perfectly!  I did cook the turkey on its breast 2/3 of the time thanks to other comments I had read and it was amazing. No one believed I had never made a turkey before!  Thanks for the recipe

Simple enough. I didn't have turkey stock so I used chicken. It turned out nice enough, but if served without gravy/cranberry sauce, then it would have been a disappointing turkey.

Oh yeah! This is a simply perfect turkey.I skipped the stuffing. I don't stuff my turkey, ever. I had a 12 lb. turkey so mine was done in 2 hrs. at 350* I cut slits in the turkey skin and stuffed it with the bits of butter instead of rubbing it on. I sprinkled it with poultry seasoning too, but forgot the salt and pepper. I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth and only basted it once. I did cook this in a roaster with the lid on. It still got a beautiful golden even with the lid on! Thanks, I got lots of Mmmmmms. My husband even said I outdid myself this year and it was the best turkey yet. Easy Excellent recipe!!!!
UPDATE: 2010: I made this for hubby's work event using a 22 lb. bird and fixed it a day ahead then refrigerated it, hubby took it whole, carved it up there and they reheated it. He got raves from everyone over this being the best turkey they ever ate! And that was a group of 24 people. HE said even those who said they don't like turkey ate seconds. Thanks for the awesome easy recipe!!! I love it.

Simply Amazing! This was my 1st Turkey bird and everyone did not believe that it was my first, it turned out that amazing. I made it this weekend because we are celebrating thanksgiving both where i live in Boca Raton and where my husbands parents live in Orlando. Everyone loved it! it really is a simply perfect Turkey. I will be making it like this for many years to come. Thanks,

It's true ~ perfect turkey. You can use chicken broth as it is more readily available. And the gravy, made from the drippings and chicken broth has more flavor than turkey stock. Thanks for sharing

It doesn't get any easier then this recipe.  I had a golden and flavorful (I used the Simple Chicken Brine recipe) turkey for Christmas dinner.  Followed all the directions as stated except for removing the foil at 2.5 hours.  I don't think I did that until the last 30 minutes.  The turkey seemed to just brown under the cover from the basting every 30 mins alone.

OMG!!! This year (2008) was my first time making Thanksgiving dinner ever and I have found my turkey recipe!!
On the bottom of the roaster before placing the turkey into the roasting pan I layered the bottom with whole carrots, celery, and put a quarter of one onion in each corner of the pan. Gave the turkey a little more flavor along with the left over juice (which I only had to use the 2 cups for the entire time of roasting it!) and the veggies were nice and soft and had great flavor... a nice little side to go along with the turkey! 
My family RAVED about it and told me to make this from now on whenever it was my turn. I also recommend injecting the juice into the turkey every hour or so... made the meat very juice and moist... never had a turkey so moist!! Even the white meat didn't need gravy!
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS!!!

I made my first turkey this past thanksgiving and I followed this recipe. IT TURNED OUT PERFECT!!! I used chicken stock because I could not find turkey stock but I dont think it mattered. Everybody was so impressed with my beautiful moist tasty turkey. I did not stuff mine and it still took the time stated to cook. I used a v shaped rack. Thank you so much!!

I made followed this recipe for our Christmas dinner. Its great. I even made it the day before Christmas and reheated it in the oven the next day and it was still moist and wonderful . I roasted a 22 lb turkey and it took 5 and a half hours at 325. It made the best gravy too!!

This is such a good, old standard recipe!!  I do this when I roast chickens and turkeys- it's always so moist!!  I don't stuff my birds and I baste when I think of it- less than every 30 mins.  I put some onions and carrots into the cavity - also around the bottom of the pan.  I add more stock as it cooks off and I keep the bird tented with foil for the last hour or so- I keep an eye on how dark the breast it getting and when it gets brown enough for me, I tent with foil.
Thanks!!

I have been making Thanksgiving dinner since I was 21 years old (which was a while ago!)  I have never heard of adding stock to the pan - it was a great idea!  I used chicken stock - 2 cups- and it turned out great.  It took longer than the guidelines on the turkey to cook, so my famished family would not let it sit and rest for 30 minutes when we finally took it out of the oven.  But it was tender and juicy. I will make the stock a regular addition to turkeys from now on!

This was my first turkey for my future in-laws.  It was the best turkey I've ever had!  They're still raving about how good it looked and tasted.  They also say I'm making Thanksgiving dinner every year from now on. You can't go wrong with this one!

A beautiful turkey!  My boyfriend said this was the best turkey he's ever had, and I agree!  It was very flavorful and moist.  Nice and easy, too.  Last year I tried a brined turkey, it was a lot of work and tasted no different from any other recipe.  This one is actually better!  I will make this recipe from now on.

This was my first turkey ever and it turned out great. My husband said it was the best turkey he had ever had! The only problem I had was that the turkey didn't get done in the time it should have (5 hours for a stuffed 21 lb bird). I believe that is from opening the oven every half hour to baste. I thought it might be too simple of a recipe, but really, it turned out very moist and delicious. Even the leftovers remained moist. I'll probably adjust it just a little next time..perhaps putting some fresh sage and butter between the skin and the breast. Great recipe, thanks!

This was the first turkey I ever made and it was absolutely delicious!  I had a 22 pound turkey, so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  I think I removed the foil tent a little too late, as part of the breast did not brown.  The meat was moist and juicy and my guests loved it!

Bravo, Trudie!  I don't know why it never occurred to me to cook my turkey this way, but I promise, this is the ONLY way I'll ever cook a turkey again!  Moist and juicy meat, perfect gravy!  Everyone in my family agreed it was the best turkey ever.  My mother-in-law has never liked the white meat of a turkey, swearing it's too dry-even SHE loved this turkey breast!  I am so glad I threw an extra bird in the oven, best leftovers EVER!

this recipe was nice...I didn't see it mentioning turning over the turkey, which I had to do, because the bottom was practically raw.  Overall, good recipe though.

This is the 3rd time I have used this recipe and there will be many more. 
I cooked a 22lb bird, but with no stuffing except a quartered large onion. It took EXACTLY the recommended time for an 18lb bird with stuffing. The meat was SOOOOO moist, but cooked properly, and everyone raved about it.
I served it with an Instant Pot Mac n cheese that was awesome.

It was perfect! I’m not an experienced turkey roaster, plus my oven died the day before Thanksgiving. I was able to use my neighbor’s oven and the turkey was perfectly moist after 4 hours. This was a 13.5 lb bird. Thanks for this recipe.

Amazing! Made my first turkey this thanksgiving and I chose this recipe because it seemed pretty close to my mother’s recipe.   Turkey turned out perfect!  Juicy, flavorful and a big hit with all my guest.  Everyone grabbed seconds and couldn’t stop raving of how good it was.

I think the cooking time might be off on this recipe. I had a 15 lb organic turkey and I'm glad I did some research on cooking times because it took me 5 hours to cook a 15 lb turkey at 350 to reach an inner temp of 165, which I had already planned to do. I don't believe my oven is different than others because I cook a variety of home cooked meals everyday for decades now. Please research cooking times online more before you decide to follow just one recipe. The original recipe poster said this is a recipe for an 18 lb turkey and cooking time of only 4 hours? That seems a bit off.

This was my very first turkey ever and it turned out really good. Since my husband and I don't like stuffing,I just stuffed it with lemon grass and crushed garlic. Besides that, I did everything exactly the way the recipe asked for including the roasting time even though my turkey was only 13lb. Had to make sure it was cooked through since I don't have a meat thermometer. And I rubbed a little bit of salt and pepper mixture in the cavity as well. I pour the drippings on top of the sliced/carved turkey, makes it really juicy and flavorful. Love love this recipe.

This was so easy, but the results were so delicious!  My guests all raved about how juicy the turkey was.  The only thing I did differently was put butter under the skin as well as on top.  I've tried brining and other methods, but this recipe is so good I'll be keeping it simple from here on out.

a good basic recipe,the only tips I have is to be totally sure youre bird is fully thawed, also I always use a electric roaster no oven space wasted , set the temp put the lid on and never open until the cooking is over ( 15 minutes per pound )always a moist and flavorful bird. I highly recommend the investment in large electric roaster ( 40 bucks) you will be glad you did

Juicy and Flavorful!  This was my first attempt at roasting a turkey.  We normally fry our turkey, but I wanted to change things up this year.  It turned out great.  I brined the turkey the night before then followed the recipe exactly the next day.

I think it should be clarified, that the temperature of the bird depends on where you're taking the temperature.  If the thigh, then 180, but if the breast.. you want 165.  In addition, I like to loosely tent my bird and let it sit for at least 45 minutes before carving.  That is the perfect amount of time to get all your other sides baked, prepped and served - and insures a juicy, beautiful bird.  The Butterball website has some nice roasting tips, but they don't recommend the foil tent.. I have always roasted my bird this way too.

Thank God some people are not afraid to stuff a turkey !  This is the simplest, tried and true receipe I've made for years and as long as you don't overcook it it comes out moist and beautifully browned.  I do rub the turkey with butter or put butter under the skin.

Last thanksgiving, my boyfriend and I tried this recipe, and everyone loved it! Even my mom who has been cooking as long as I can remember said it was the juciest turkey she had ever eaten.

I "road tested" this recipe with the largest roast chicken I could find.  Sure, it came out very juicy and had a beautiful color, but in the end I was disappointed.  My husband said it tasted rubbery, and to me it was too salty. I think tenting it "steamed it" (as referenced by another reviewer). Maybe it would work better with turkey, as it is not as tender as chicken, but even so, it needed something, like different herbs on the skin; for me, the flavor was just not there. I did put butter under the skin and put celery, onions and carrots in the roasting pan and in the bird, and it was still lacking.  The best thing I could say was that it made a good gravy.  I am going to use tonight's leftovers to make chicken soup and use my regular turkey recipe this Thanksgiving.

So nice to do it the "old-fashioned" way.  I did add some different dried herbs to the butter and that added some nice extra flavor.  Didn't even baste and the meat still was juicy and delicious.

I prepared this recipe as directed, except I did not stuff my bird - and instead of a tent of foil and constant basting I roasted my turkey in a Reynold's Oven bag. I had a 27 lb bird and it came out succulent and juicy. This is a fantastic recipe.

I have roasted small birds both chickens and turkeys but until this past Thanksgiving I haven't roasted a big one.  I had major anxiety about drying out the bird(think Christmas Vacation.)  I used this recipe as a guide.  I made a few changes like adding a cup of red wine to the bottom of the pan with a few cloves of crushed garlic.   I also stuffed the bird with celery and onion instead of stuffing.  I was really stressing out because I cook my birds on a lower heat setting but had to increase my temp to 350.  I kept checking it throught the process and cooked my 20 # turkey for 5 hours.  Tented for 4 of the 5 hours and basted every 30 minutes adding broth to the pan as needed.  Let the turkey rest for about 30 minutes.  The bird was brown and juicy- delish!!

Marvelous and simple guide to a great roast turkey.  I used a free-range bird, 13 pounds, and it turned out juicy and very flavorful.  The best ever!

This turkey was DELICIOUS!  It was tender and juicy and tasted wonderful.  Instead of covering the turkey in foil I covered it in cheesecloth, as is tradition in our family.  Even though you have to stay home all day to baste the turkey, it's worth it!

Excellent. I have used this recipe for two Thanksgivings and each time the turkey was perfect--moist and golden. I received compliments each time. (And I had never roasted turkey before using this recipe.)

This was my first turkey and it was delicious!  It looked just like the picture.  Everyone stated it was the best turkey they ever ate and boy was it juicy.  I basted it about every 45 mins. to an hour.  I had a 16 lb. turkey and did stuff it, took about 4.5 hours.  I didn't use the whole stick of butter nor as much turkey stock as it called for as the drippings kept it moist.

I'm so proud of myself! I made my very first turkey this year and it turned out great! I put butter under the skin and basted the turkey every 30 mins to keep it nice and juicy. My bird was about 15 lbs. and I made the celery stuffing to put in our turkey and it cooked for about 4 1/2 hours. It probably could have been pulled out 15 - 30 mins earlier, but I'm always so paranoid about under cooking the bird. Overall, a great, easy recipe and it turned out yummy!

Followed directions except didn't stuff the turkey.  The turkey was very moist but I think it was because I followed the advice of another reviewer and covered the bird with foil for the first half of the cooking time.  Also, I didn't have a roasting rack so I used peeled carrots along the bottom of the pan.

This turkey was very moist even though I didn't get to baste it every 30 minutes. It was my first time buying a fresh turkey rather than a frozen one and I have heard that fresh are much better, this one lived up to that rumor. My 17 lb turkey took a bit more than 5 hours to reach 180 degrees so dinner was delayed a bit.  But the wait was worth it.

I love this recipe!!! I've never cooked much before (my fiancee cooks for me :) and I really wanted to surprise him with a full meal when he got home from work. We were both blown away with how good this turkey recipe is! Our turkey didn't even last a week. I can't wait to use it again for Christmas!!!

smoked the Turkey for 3 hrs. before placing in the oven bag. Placed the bird in the oven with a temp. of 325 for 4 hrs. . The Family was happy with the bird. I think Fried is still the way to go. For a change up I've got to say very good.

I just made my 1st BIG turkey on Thanksgiving.  And this recipe was a HUGE help with timing and temps.  And the butter and salt/pepper and turkey stock helped so much with the flavor.  My family said it was the best turkey they had....so thank you!!!!  I actually used black peppercorn and sea salt.  And didn't use stuffing I stuffed it with onions and celery.  Great flavor!

This is the first year I cooked Thanksgiving dinner at my house and first year I made a Turkey.  I used this recipe and everyone loved it.  The turkey was very juicy and tender.  It also looked just like his picture, beautiful golden brown.  It was very easy to make and a huge success at our house today!

Delicious! It was my first attempt at cooking a turkey without my mother and grandmother around and I was nervous.  I cooked it for Thanksgiving in New Zealand where I now live and I was feeling the pressure of living up to all the kiwi's expectations of Thanksgiving!  It was moist and beyond my expectations.

I made this recipe last year simply as stated. I thought it was great. This year, we decided to brine our 14 turkey for the first time. To 'brine' its not difficult but requires a bit of work. We boiled a stockpot of water and tossed in some garlic, shallots, thyme, sage, rosemary, peppercorns, and coarse kosher salt.  You would bring to a boil and then allow the mixture to completely cool. Once cooled, clean and prepare the bird; place in the stockpot. We left this permeate overnight. The next day, the recipe was followed except for a couple details. Instead of using butter, we placed the same 3 herbs used in the brine under the skin of the breast and used the awesome sausage, apple, and cranberry stuffing recipe from this website inside the bird cavity. The end result was the best and most tender turkey I have ever had in MY LIFE!

It was truly unbelievable how well this turned out.  I made a butter rub with poultry seasoning and fresh herbs to spread under the skin while it roasted and the flavor was outstanding.

Wonderful recipe, my first turkey was PERFECT!!!  I also put butter under the skin after reading other reviews.  Everyone said it was the most moist turkey they have ever had.

I cooked Thansgiving for the first time and I was really nervous since all my in-laws are amazing cooks!  I found this recipe and it was so easy and tasted amazing!  My husband said it was the best turkey he ever had!  And I agree!  I will definitely be making this every year!

WOW!
I give the turkey a 4, but the gravy made from pan drippings was amazing! And the turkey looked so gorgeous, my whole family was impressed.

This is the BEST and simpliest roast turkey ever!  I stuffed a small Butterball turkey (12.5 LB)with Stove Top stuffing and roasted it for 3 hours and 30 minutes. I cut back on the butter by 1/2 cause it kept sliding off the turkey.  It turned out wonderfully juicy and delicious. I am definitely use this recipe over and over!

I followed other reviewers suggestions of putting butter under the skin. I think this helped to make it more moist. I love this recipe and I plan on using every year from now on! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

This is the only way that I will EVER roast a turkey again. It was picture perfect, moist, full of flavor, and just like the name says...simply perfect! The whole family commented on how delicious it was, and also that it looked like something out of a fine dining magazine. Thanks so much!

Not a great recipe.  Covering any part of the turkey at the beginning of the roast will slow down the rise in temperature needed to kill off any harmful bacteria.  You do not want any part of the turkey to be in the temperature danger zone of 40 to 140 degrees farenheit for more than four hours.  The shorter the time the safer.  Instead, cook the bird uncovered until the breast is well browned, then cover it with foil to prevent overcooking. Be safe and enjoy!

First time at roasting a turkey and it was delicious. My roasting pan was the same size as my 15 pound turkey so it was a tight fit. I didn’t have a baster and there wasn’t room to fit a spoon to do the basting. What I did was pour the stock over the bird as I was adding it each time I noticed it was getting low. Came out perfectly! Breast was so moist! Will use this method forever!

Just made it at 8am the turkey was Brown on the top so I left it in a little while longer to Brown all around. Also, any poulty that I cook, I make it a habit to brine for 12 hrs just to make it extra juicy. We're serving this as my church so I'm hoping it's good this afternoon ??

Very easy and creates a lovely crispy browned skin without drying the turkey out.  I massaged  a melted butter and poultry seasoning, salt  marinade under the skin the evening before, covered the turkey with wax paper and a wet towel and placed back in fridge overnight. Roasted 4 hours as directed for a 14-15 lb turkey. Before roasting  I put sliced onion and celery into the cavity, and salt and half stick butter. I highly recommend  this recipe highly!

A great Thanksgiving meal starts with a perfect turkey and then one fits that description. Used this one lasts year and made exactly as written except made the stuffing separate because I wasn't certain how gluten free would turn out roasting in the bird. Excellent and simple to execute!

Perfect.. I followed the instructions to the tee based on the baking times of a stuffed, 15 lb. turkey.  The color was wonderful and the turkey was perfect.. Be sure to baste and add stock every 30 minutes..

This turned out great! I added seasoning to the butter before I massaged it into the turkey. First time I ever made a turkey and it turned out wonderfully brown and the meat was incredibly moist. I’ll definitely make this again!

1st time I ever made a turkey. It was so easy I thought I messed up. But it was so tasty and juicy. I put some apples and an onion instead of stuffing. So worth it! I did use chicken stick for basting and used about 8total cups during a 5 hour cooking time. Be sure to baste.

First time I ever made roast Turkey and it turned out delicious, however a few things that I found which could be helpful if you're a newbie to making raost turkey:
1) It took quite a bit longer than recipe (and time-size chart) describes to get temp up to 160 deep in the thigh, which is key if you want yummy, moist, drop-off-the-bone dark meat: I had a 14 pound bird, started at 425 for first 30 minutes as suggested by another reviewer (because the bird is a bit cold when taken out of the fridge), then I dropped the oven to 350 for the next hour, and 325 thereafter. I basted only once per hour  to help keep the temp up, and I have a great oven, but it still took just under 5 hours to get temp in thigh up to 160 - and with the 30 minutes prep at start and another 30 minutes at end for the turkey to sit at room temp before carving, you should expect this recipe to take 6 hours from start to serving, even for a turkey smaller than the 18pounds in the recipe.
2. I put the aluminum foil tent on the bird after the first 30 minutes (when I droppped oven temp from 425 to 350) but then left it on the rest of the way
3. Instead of bread stuffing, I stuffed the bird with quartered apples, onions, several whole garlic cloves, and sections from one peeled orange, per another comment; this generated alot of moisture and flavor; awesome.
4. For the basting broth in bottom of pan, I used 50-50 combo of apple cider and chicken broth, per suggestion from another recipe to broaden the flavor of

Didn't stuff the bird, and used homemade lard in place of butter.   Also it was a fresh Italian turkey  so no water added (Thanksgiving in the Tuscan hills).  Came out PERFECT!  Moist inside, and crispy skin outside.   9kg/19lbs. 4 1/4 hrs.

This is the only recipe that I use for thanksgiving and Christmas turkey for the past 5 years. It comes out very juicy and moist. I substitute Swanson chicken broth for the the turkey stock because chicken broth tastes better and has more flavor and it comes out perfect every time. My family and friends devour this moist, juicy turkey like vulchers every time.

This was simple and delicious. I followed other reviewers' instructions and put butter under the skin. I put a quartered onion, an apple, a celery stalk and some herbs in the cavity.  I also rubbed a mix of herbs de provence inside and out after I salted the bird. I cooked at 425 for the first 30 mins, then turned it down to 325 and basted every 30 mins thereafter. I tented from after the first 30 mins. It was excellent.  A gorgeous golden colour, juicy, and delicious.  I would absolutely make it again!

I followed the recipe and the 20lb turkey was tender and delicious.  My  family was very impressed.  With the constant basting the bird was beautifully browned and there were lots of "ooo's" when I took it out of the oven.
This one is a keeper.

The end result was excellent but the cooking time was short by nearly an hour to get the temperature to 180 degF. I think next time I will start it off at 450 degF for an hour as suggested in other reviews.

Our turkey turned out terrific!  I used an herbed butter under the breast skin.  I also made sure there was chicken stock always in the bottom of the roasting pan.  The  stuffed 19 pound turkey was very moist and cooked in 3 1/2 hours.

Perfection.  The turkey came out beautiful, tasty and moist.  Salt and pepper inside and out and drizzled with olive oil.
I stuffed the cavity with onion, apple and fresh sage.  Definitely my go to turkey recipe/cooking method.
Be sure to keep an eye on the liquid at the bottom of the pan since the pan is at the lowest level of the oven.  Makes awesome gravy, especially if you add the diced giblets.

I combined this recipe with chef John's turkey recipe. I used his recipe because it calls for vegetables underneath the turkey 3 stalks celery, 2 small onions, 2 carrots. And I also added potatoes. I used a couple thyme inside the bird instead of sage and rosemary as his recipe calls for. And as chef John suggested place butter pieces between meat and skin and also over the turkeg. As far as the rest I followed this recipe and I must say it came out wonderrful. The stuffing I used was cornbread and I followed the instructions on the back of the box. This turkey was to die for!  Please do not make this recipe if you are not going to use a thermometer it is crucial to pull out the bird the exact right time. Just a little overbaked and your bird will come out dry. I placed a thermometer inside the stuffing and was alerted by the thermometer alarm when it hit 165
 degrees.

As simple as it was, using this recipe produced the best turkey I have ever made.   We used a vegetarian, anti-biotic free turkey, kerry gold butter for the outside (going over the turkey 2-3 times before putting into the roasting pan) and organic turkey stock for basting.  The two keys were the temperature probe and the basting.  Our ovens tend to cook things faster and our 18lb turkey only took about 5 hours total and was at the 180 degrees.  We also covered with foil at the end and let rest an hour before cutting and serving.  The turkey fell off the bone and while I had the carving knife out, it was not required.  Great way to make a turkey and I've saved for all future years.

I used a wild turkey.  I have no idea how much it weighed dressed, but 14 pounds is my guess.  I made the recipe as listed, using chicken broth because that is all I had.  I baked it for 2.75 hours total.  The turkey did turn out very moist, even with it being wild.  My advice to myself for next time: watch the liquid in the bottom of the pan closely.  When it was getting low, but not evaporated off yet, it started to brown/burn.  I will keep it better replenished next time.  The drippings still made excellent gravy.  Also, I let it sit for probably 40 minutes because my husband was late from work, and I think that helped a lot!  It was very juicy.  I'll season the butter with salt and pepper next time to try and infuse a little more flavor into the meat.

Their is a lot of variations from Turkey prep. , to the stuffing. What I do is use a seasoning injector and inject melted butter mixed with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Now with the dressing I will add diced Granny Smith's apples, diced celery, diced onions, dehydrated cranberry and raisens (equal portions). In the bottom of the pan I pour 1 (32oz.) box low sodium chicken broth.  After assembling Turkey and dressing I place on a rack in the roaster. Cover with aluminum foil and roast at 275 deg. for six to eight hours. Fall off the bone moist.

I followed this recipe using a few suggestions from others.
I covered the wings with foil and used a rack in the roasting pan and it turned out beautifully! Thank you!

Best turkey ever!  I bought a frozen turkey, brined it.  I did not stuff it, instead I added parsley and tyme to the cavity and shallots to the turkey broth, along with the butter under the skin.  It was AMAZING!!  Highly recomend it!!

I've made this exact recipe since 1983 (just dated myself) lol.  It was the recipe that my mother in law taught me.  (The only thing my mom made was reservations.)  The one difference would be that I cook it in one of those V-shaped racks in a turkey pan and cover it with a foil tent for the first few hours to get the bird done.  Toward the end, take off the foil and up the heat to brown the outside.  Then let it rest under the foil tent on top of the stove for 30 minutes or so to let the juices settle into the meat.  It is a basic recipe, but it's always well received.  Thank you for sharing!

My two cents worth.... Never use a previously frozen turkey!!! If you are going to invest your precious time, please start with a FreashTurkey. I did cover the breast till last hour, then remove to brown breast. True confession...I started with what I thought was a completely thawed Turkey per instructions  And had to add on extra time  to reach temperature and to fight dryness. My mistake. This Recipe is truly the best one out there. Will try again...with fresh only!!

I started using this recipe 3 years ago when I was making my first turkey and I've used it every year since. It's fail proof and produces a delicious turkey! I add a couple more spices but that's it! Oh & I don't stuff my turkey!

This was my first Thanksgiving turkey and it was a great recipe. I did add some chicken broth and white wine poured over the turkey. I also added some apples and fruit in the cavity of the turkey!  It was moist and great!!!!!!  I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone!

I usually just put the turkey in a roasting bag, but I was looking for something better this year.  I used this recipe and my mother-in-law said that this was the best Thanksgiving meal that she has ever had.  I have a new cooking tradition.

Simply the best turkey ever, even if you aren't a total turkey lover. Moist, flavorful and a beautiful browned skin. The drippings make awesome gravey as well, so it's a double winner.

Wonderfully delicious!  The only change I made was mixing a few herbs to the butter prior to rubbing it inside, beneath the skin and over the bird.  I also threw three garlic cloves inside the bird since we made a pan of stuffing.  My first Thanksgiving turkey was absolutely perfect!  Moist, tasty and simply delicious!  Thanks...

When we finally ate, the turkey was wonderful...juicy and delicious BUT all the moisture from it cooking almost did my oven in first!  Must admit I was a bit confused about the foil tent and basting...would have thought the tent would eliminate the need for basting...anyway after one or two tries, I just laid the foil on top of the bird rather than tucking it over the pan entirely and let it take care of itself.  Two and a half hours into cooking, I removed it and basted every half hour until, almost done, my oven started beeping incessantly as if the timer was going off.  Only problem was I wasn't using the timer! Having never had a problem before, I wasn't sure what to do when faced with an F2 message blinking on the touchpad/screen.  Cancel seemed the logical option so I tried that first followed by every button I could find...all to no avail. Although the turkey was almost cooked, my sides in the lower oven still had a ways to go, so simply leaving the ovens off entirely wasn't a great option.  (Thoughts of finishing up on the barbeque ensued.)  As a last resort, my husband resorted to turning off the circuit breaker entirely which finally quieted things...until switched back on, I tried to restart everything only to be greeted by a blinking/beeping F4 "message"!  Muttering a few choice letters of our own by then, we turned everything off again and left it off for 10-15 minutes.  Fortunately that seemed to do the trick and we eventually were able to resume cooking.  That

this turkey turned out very good. the only things i changed were: 1) i did not need the whole amount of butter it called for 2) i had a 20 lbs turkey so i had to increase the baking time. Next time i think i would increase the baking tempature to 350 degrees to speed things up a bit. I started it at 7 am and it was done at 2 pm. it was also stuffed, so that made it take a bit longer too. But even my mother in law said the white meat was juicy, and thats hard to do, so thanx for the great recipe!
