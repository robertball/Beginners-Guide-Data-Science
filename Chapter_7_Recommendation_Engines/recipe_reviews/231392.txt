I make this recipe only I use wheat germ instead of almond flour.  I also like to use buttermilk or "soured" milk. This is one of our favorite pancake recipes--it always turns out fluffy with a wonderful texture. NOTE: Because this recipe calls for wheat flour and oats, let the batter sit for fifteen minutes before using so that it has time to soak up some of the liquid and fluff up.

We are not much of a pancake eating family, but I like to try new recipes, occasionally, especially if they are healthy. I rate this a 5 for healthy. It is made with all whole grains and has no refined sugar. Although, I had to use an emulsion blender to get the banana fully blended. However, taste, its not bad but would be better with strawberry or other fruit topping or whipped cream. It just needs something. Also, wasn't too sure how I felt about the almond flour. The submitter referred to it as a crispiness, I thought it was more of an after texture with the almond bits. I would opt to not add that on a similar recipe, even though it is healthy protein. Only change I made was using white whole wheat flour. I got 7 pancakes.

I used nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt instead of milk,  doubled the oats, and added 1/8 cup of honey. Delicious.

These pancakes came out great.  I took the suggestions of a few of the other reviews and did the following:  increased the oatmeal to 1/2 c., and added a touch of vanilla to the batter.  I used one very large and ripe banana, but I would suggest that if using smaller bananas, use 2.  My husband gobbled them up, and it usually takes a lot for him to eat pancakes, as he is watching his waistline:)

I subbed wheat germ, added cinnamon, and let the mixture sit 10 minutes or so (thanks Sara Jo!). I also used quick oats. The result was fluffy, moist but hearty pancakes with a mild banana flavor. Next time, I'll add more banana (not mashed up as much), more cinnamon, leave out the canola oil, and use sour milk. I topped with a fresh blackberry sauce which suited the pancakes great, but the possibilities are endless. Plain honey drizzled on top, chocolate chips mixed into the batter, blueberry sauce....they are also great plain!

These were wonderful. I used organic unbleached flour because it's what I had, but plan to use wheat germ next time to replace the almond meal.I doubled the oats, halved the salt, used milk soured with lemon juice. I let the batter rest 15 minutes as suggested. My husband and I both loved them.

I made this according to the recipe, but I think next time I would add a little more oatmeal and use buttermilk.  These do have a great flavor, but they do need a little sweetness.  I'm sure my granddaughters will inhale these.  I did make mine a little smaller than called for, but that's just because of my "audience."  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok so awesome healthy recipe! I did some tweaks though...
Didn't have almond meal so I used almond flour
Used almond milk instead of milk
Added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon 
Added an extra banana (I love bananas)
And 1 more Tablespoon of almond milk since it was thick

Oooooh so yummy!!!!!!!

My family really liked these pancakes.  I took another reviewers suggestion and "soured" my milk by adding 2 Tbls of vinegar and let it sit for about 5 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  This makes the pancakes fluffy.  Next time I will also add a little sugar.

Made them....loved them.  I  added chopped walnuts and a bit of cinnamon to the batter.  I went traditional with maple syrup for a topping, my husband topped his with peanut butter.  We were both very happy!

I didn't have almond meal so I used ground flax seed. I let it set like others had suggested. Everyone enjoyed them. I'll make them again.

Super delicious! And I love the fact that there's no added sugar in this recipe; all the sweetness comes from the ripe bananas. I even used hemp milk just because I wanted to use up the carton I bought (it's pretty gross) and the pancakes still tasted amazing! I added in walnuts to give it an extra crunch and substituted oat flour for the oats just so that the texture was smooth. I will definitely make this again!

It took quit a while for the pancake to cook  through.  Had to spread the batter out or it was too thick.  Tasted ok though!

Excellent and Easy Recipe !!  I made mini muffins instead of bread. I ended up just sprinkling  the cinnamon and sugar mixture over the top if each little muffin.  Baked for 14 min.  What a flavorful, moist and pretty little muffin.

These were so great! I didn't have almond meal or bananas, so I used corn meal (1/4 cup) and apple sauce (1/2 cup) instead! Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a generous shaking of cinnamon. They were really delicious!

Great breakfast. Really quick and easy to make. I used a banana and a half and added a dash more of milk. Topped it with a couple slices of banana, strawberry, and blueberries on the side with blueberry syrup. Delicious! Made about 6 pancakes.

Yummy and healthy. The recipe is great as it is, but I made a couple changes based on personal taste and what I had on hand. I used oat flour instead of oats, I put 1tbp vinegar with the milk and let it sour while I mixed the dry ingredients to make pancakes fluffier, and I used whole grain white flour. They turned out super yummy.

To make this lower in carbs I did not use oats and I used almond coconut milk in place of regular milk.  These were delicious. I saved it to my recipes and will definitely make them again.

Love these. I was low on whole wheat flour, so I used 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/4c of peanut butter powder, that I had just enough of. They turned out  yummy.

I am diabetic and use sugar substitute like Splenda and they are good! Do you have a section for people with Type 2 Uncontrolled Diabetes? My sugar runs TOO high every day, I take 5 oral meds (some 2x a day) plus insulin twice a day too. I can't seem to gain any weight (100 is my top weight for over a year). thanks Miriam

These pancakes are delicious.  Light considering the ingredients.  Used mini-processor for the whole almonds which works well for grinding.  Recipe is a keeper.  Served with berries and a little maple syrup.

These are delicious.  I did not have almond meal so I substituted ground flax seed, and I used ordinary corn oil instead of canola oil.  These were tender and just really good.  My husband enjoyed them too.  This recipe is a keeper.

As suggested by others, I "soured" the milk with 2 T. of vinegar, and I let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.

Finally!  A whole wheat pancake recipe I like!!!  It has been a long search, but finally I found it.  The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because my kids weren't 100% sold on this (they are a bit used to the good ol' Bisquick pancakes).

We live in Costa Rica, where the bananas are excellent and where we are always looking for ways to use the ones that are super ripe.  We tried these for the first time this morning and LOVED them!
