YUM! I'd like to also offer a twist on this recipe. I cut the frozen puff pastry into small rectangles or squares, brushed the pastry with beaten egg, and filled with approximately a teaspoon of brie, a approx. teaspoon of seedless raspberry jam, and a sprinkling of crushed walnuts. I folded each little piece of pastry over on itself to make either a triangle or a square/rectangle shape, poked a hole in the top with a fork and brushed the top with egg. They make delicious breakfast/tea party pastries. 

Also, I tried the same thing with black cherry preserves and it was wonderful! The artisan puff pastry from Trader Joe's came out light and crisp and perfectly browned in a 400 degree oven.

Try splitting a small brie in 1/2 horizontally (a wire works well) & put the jam & walnuts inside. Then wrap with phyllo, puff pastry or crescent roll dough. This makes a spectacular presentation & its own "bread" to eat it with. bake @ 350 about 30 - 35 min.

This was fabulous!  I wasn't sure what to serve with it as far as crackers, etc. so I took the suggestion of using mini fillo cups.  It's the perfect little appetizer size!  I put a couple thick cubes of brie in each cup, let that bake @ 350 until it became a little soft, then added a nice covering of raspberry jam and a few chopped walnut pieces before letting them finish baking for a couple more minutes.  Even our kids loved these!  Thanks!

I just wanted to add a not as the recipe submitter.  I noticed some question about what to serve it with.  I serve it usually with hearty crackers, toasted pieces of baguette, and crisp sliced apples.  I also really like the idea of making individually wrapped little bries.

I love brie and raspberry together!  I only get to make this at the holidays cause the kids aren't fond of this cheese.  I have made it as the recipe states, however this time I decided to use pillo cups and I think I like them better.  I cut the cheese into small chunks and placed into cups.  Halfway through baking I topped with the jam. Yum!

Made this with raspberry jam and sliced almonds and wrapped in crescent roll dough (what I had).  It was great and had a good contrast of textures.

4 people nearly ate the whole thing before dinner! I didn't expect this to be the 'hit' of the dinner, but it dominated much of the conversation. Before baking I did drizzle some real maple syrup and brown sugar on top to brown it. Very good.

I love the raspberry with the Brie, but instead of walnuts I used pecans and roasted garlic. It added a nice savory flavor to an otherwise sweet recipe

This is such an easy recipe that always turns out impressive.  I've done many combinations of nuts/jams.  This year I'm trying it with a "hot" blackberry jam I found at a farmer's market.  The jam is actually made with jalepenos!  A tip that makes it even more impressive:  Use small cookie cutters to cut out shapes from the trimmed off puff pastry, place them on the top and brush with a little egg white!  I like making a holly and berry pattern on top.

I made this for a baby shower and it was SUCH a hit, it was the first platter emptied! I wanted it to be a bit more savory so I added 2 Tbls Balsamic Vinegar to the raspberry preserves and it was such a great little variation! Everyone there wanted the recipe and were shocked when I told them how easy it was. Try it with the vinegar, it's SO good!

I made these for a pot luck and they were almost all gone as soon as the plate was on the table! I made a few adjustments to the recipe.
Firstly, I made them with phyllo dough in mini-muffin trays.  I cut the phyllo into triangles and brushed them lightly with olive oil.  It took six triangle per mini-muffin spot.  I then put a chuck of brie, a LITTLE bit of jam I had made testers before and too much Jam overpowered the brie and added walnuts on top.  

I fold the edges of the phyllo over top.  THey look SO GOOD and the Phyllo dough made it a little fancier looking! 

I brought them there cold then heated them in the oven on 350 for about 5 minutes... let cool about 5 minutes before serving them you are done!

GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe is really simple, but it looks impressive! I tried it with pumpkin butter and pecans for a holiday party, and it was a huge hit! I also brushed the top with beaten egg so that it would brown nicely.

Super delicious! Made it for an anniversary party and everybody loved it. My only mistake was that I didn't let it sit long enough before cutting so it all oozed out.

I made this with apricot jam and walnuts.  The flavor was great but I had to bake much longer than 20 minutes to get my brie nice and melted.  I think next time, I'd rather try it in individual pastry puffs.  I will try this again!

Wow. What a great dish! I made this for a holiday cocktail party and received quite a few compliments. I made th4e recipe according to the directions, and didn't change anything. However I did make it ahead of time and refrigerated the dish for a few hours before baking. Also, for anyone wondering, I cut off the rind - for fear of others not liking the rind as much as I do - and the cheese was just fine. This was an excellent recipe that was easy/fast to make. Thanks!

This was so simple AND very impressive.  I used a 19 ounce round of brie and 2 pastry sheets.  One did not reach all the way on the 19 ounce wheel, so I used another.  Also used a bit more of the jam and walnuts - RAVE REVIEWS!

Just did not work for me.  You could not taste the raspberry flavor and the puff pastry did detracted from the flavor of the cheese.  Very pretty presentation though.

Pretty good. Seems like it may be missing something... we used floss and sliced it in half, added filling and then also topped the brie before baking.

Loved it!  Used mini pastry cups for bite sized versions, forgot to grab walnuts at the grocery store but had a bag of almonds in the pantry.  Delicious and simple!

This is soo yummy!!! Very easy to make,was a big hit for our family gathering Christmas eve.Used a wedge, couldn't find a round brie, took the rind off top, spread the raspberry jam & walnuts on the brie itself, so it could melt with the brie, made it so much nicer to eat!!

Couldn't find a round brie, so bought an 8 oz wedge of brie. spread the jam and the walnuts on the puff pastry before placing the brie on the pastry. Wrapped it up best as I can and it took a while for the top to turn golden but it did and tastes great with crackers!

This recipe was the hit of the party!  The sides blew out but next time I'll just make sure the dough on the sides is a little thicker to hold it all in.  I don't have a brie baking dish so I used waxed paper on the bottom of my baking dish...mistake!.  1/2 hour after putting it out, my husband told me that our guests were eating the wax paper...I guess they really LOVED it!

I made this with crescent rolls since I forgot the puff pastry when I went to the store.  I was DELICIOUS and a huge hit with everyone at my party.  I would make this again!

Brie. Puff Pastry. Jam. Walnuts. Perfect combination. This was DELICIOUS. Messy? Of course. So worth it. I'd definately make it again!

Yum! I took others' suggestions and cut the pastry puffs into small squares, filling each with a teaspoon of brie. Instead of raspberry jam, I used cinnamon apple jelly for some and pumpkin butter for others. WOW. Those flavors, with brie & walnuts, were amazing.

All I can say AMAZING! Not only does this make a beautiful presentation its sooooooo tasty! I went with wrapping the whole brie wheel in 1 puf pastry sheet. I cut the excess of and folded it on the top and cut out a heart shape out of the remaining puff pastry and placed on the center for a fun touch, also brushed an egg wash on top to make it golden brown. Everyone loved this and it went quick. Definetly will be a staple at all my holidays and dinner parties!

I made this twice now and it is great.  The 2nd time, I used more jelly and walnuts because the first time I made it, it seemed that it could have used more. It was excellent.

This is a yummy taste treat. I sliced the brie in half horizontally and put apricot all fruit in the middle with walnuts. The spread in the middle being seedless is important. After baking it's soft and sweet and tasty! You can use whatever fruit flavor you like and goes with the rest of your meal. It was better with crispy crackers than it was with soft bread.

This was good but I feel like it's nothing special - and you have to get your guests to eat it quickly or it's solidified and doesn't taste quite as good.

I was excited to make this for father's days since my dad loves Brie. Sadly, although it was okay it did not get the reviews I expected.  Although none who tried it said they down right disliked it, they seemed to think the flavor combination was odd and weren't to sure about it. My father stated he would have preferred the brie just by itself.
Update: I gave this 3 stars to start since didnt get rave reviews but my grandfather said he put some in the oven again later in the week and loved it, requesting more! Although it was golden brown when I took it out of the oven, maybe all it needed was to sit in the oven longer or be eating right after taken out of the oven and not just when people got finished with the rest of the meal. 4 stars.

This is the first time I've made baked brie. I tried a friend's before and it was wonderful so I thought I'd try to do it too. I had a problem with presentation. I'm not sure how you're supposed to serve it without cheese and jam everywhere. Do I let it cool first?

Besides that, the final product was a lot sweeter than expected. THe jam and puff pastry were a little too much sugar. 

Still really enjoyable with Ritz crackers, but a little too rich. It was har to eat more than a small bite.

This is great tasting and has a great presentation on a buffet table.  I too am from Tulsa, but first tasted this at a holiday party in D.C. a couple of weeks ago. I asked the hostess for the recipe, but relied on my faulty memory and couldn't remember exactly how to make it when I got home. I was looking around for the recipe and was very glad to find it here - this is going to go on a New Year's buffet table at my house! Easy and Yummy!

This recipe was a great hit at a wine & cheese party. I sliced off the rind on the "top" before adding the seedless raspberry jam & roasted pecans. I used parchment paper & it came out perfectly.  I'll make this again for sure.

I took the rind off the brie because I"m not a huge fan of it.  I also brushed the top with egg and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top.  Not sure the brown sugar did anything, but this was a hit at our dinner party.

the MVP of my dinner party!  i used raspberry preserves (with the seeds) and it was delicious all the same.  this was such an easy thing to make and it was just raved about.  i will DEFINITELY make this again! the only thing i did differently was i roasted the walnuts, as i prefer the taste to raw nuts.

Just a note: I have made this in the past and if there is any puff pastry left, I use the remainder & cut out a shape/design & plunk it right on top!  A heart, a star, crescent moon,leaf, etc....it looks so pretty!

I made this last night for wine club and it was gone in 10 minutes, despite the fact that I doubled this recipe!  I also made the parmesean fondue from this site and while I thought that was awesome when I made it, once I took a bite of this, the winner was clear.  I did use pecans since that is what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (other than baking longer to get brown, since I had a larger quantity).  The texture was awesome, the raspberry and nuts added a really interesting taste combination.  The three flavors worked well . . . the brie didn't overpower the other two flavors as it sometimes can.  I did use homemade raspberry jam which can also overpower other flavors since it is so fresh tasting.  I served these with sliced baguettes and crackers and I think it went well with both, although most people seemed to prefer the crackers. I plan on making this again in days.  This one's a WINNER!

This was a great hit and my house. The only thing I added was brushing the top of the pastry with egg so it made that crispy  flaky top.

This was amazing!!  There were so many good recommendations that I made 2 and put them to a taste test.  The puff pastry won over crescent roll dough, everyone found it easier to cut into and not as heavy.  Tested both Raspberry jam and black cherry topping, both were excellent and really depends on your own preference.  SOOOOOO easy to make, I love this recipe!!  Also, serve with apples or a thing cracker or toasted bagel.  Yummm.

This is such a great recipe.  I did split it horizontly, and put in finely sliced apples, chopped walnuts and raspberry jam. (seedless) brushed the outside of the pastry w/ egg white, and.....for a bit of sweetness.........melted about 3 tablespoons of butter and a touch of cinnimon, and burshed that over the egg white!! YUM!! Making it tomorow for Super Bowl Sunday!  Go Colts!!

I made this for a girls' night dinner party last night.  Instead of the raspberry and walnuts, I used apricot preserves.  It was delicious and people that usually don't like brie raved about it.  The recipe is quick, simple, and really impressed my guests.  I look forward to making it again and experimenting with other flavors of preserves.

So simple, so good... To make things a little more "eater friendly", I substituted the pastry sheet for Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells... They were a big hit with my picky family this Easter.

I used pepper jelly (cranberry pepper jelly is even better!) I have also made this with my homemade apricot jam, too. I usually omit the nuts. Yum, yum!

I would make this again. It was delicious. I used frozen raspberries, as I did not have jam. I mashed the raspberries with my mortar and pestal, spread on the cheese topped with the chopped walnuts. Delicious!!

Amazing.  I will make this over and over again.  Next time I may make a little bit of an effort to cut off some of the rind of the cheese to make it appeal to more tastes.  BUT that being said, anyone who loves brie will LOVE this recipe.  The puff pastry makes for a crisp and tasty crust.

didn't have the berries so substituted finely chopped apple in the middle of the brie along with slivered almonds.  Used the higher temperature of 400 at 15 minutes but it still needed the extra few minutes to get that golden brown.

This was more delicious than I could of hoped; and easy to make it pretty when rolling out the pastry dough using a cookie cutter for shapes at the top. Served with cut up granny smith apples and it was a hit, will definitely make again.

Love this easy, elegant appetizer. I make it plain, no jam on top, and serve with olive tapenade, fig jam, crackers or toasted baguettes and sliced apple. Delicious!!  Definitely on my table this Christmas!

Wow, this recipe is such a crowd pleaser and ridiculously simple to make. I substituted some thick homemade cranberry sauce instead of the jam, sans the nuts, and it was a perfect Thanksgiving app. This will be my new go to recipe for parties.

The perfect baked brie! It is so easy and quick to make. I cut out the walnuts to make it a little bit more kid-friendly. I also painted egg whites on the puff pastry before I baked it to add some crispiness. I would highly recommend this :)

Like the simplicity and definitely yummy.  In the future, I will even out the jam to cheese ratio some as I felt the brie was a little overpowering, especially since it's so rich.  I'll also add more walnuts, and I will try flattening it out as well to make strips or squares rather than having a big hunk.  Next time I'm thinking of spreading the cheese and jam out on one whole sheet and then placing another sheet on top (2 sheets total) to see how that works.  I'm curious to mess around with this one - thanks for the tasty recipe!

I took the suggestion of others and made it with mini phyllo (aka fillo) cups instead.  Great idea!  Everybody loved them.  This is a recipe I'll definitely be making many more times.  It's so quick and easy.  Loved it!

I make this recipe with a few changes.  Instead of putting the raspberry preserves on the brie itself, I spread it onto the puff pastry before putting the brie down.  I also omit the nuts.  This is always a HUGE hit at our family get togethers.  I've made in dozens of times and never bring any home.

OK, I'm giving this four stars because I can imagine it being much better if I'd followed the recipe as written and because my guests really enjoyed the dish.  I did it in the individual phyllo cups and thoguht it was too pastry-y.  I did however use a seedless raspberry jam that squeezed out of the bottle like ketchup or something and that made the little individual baked bries easier.  I liked the concept, just not the taste as much as i thought I would.  They were however very convenient to make ahead of time and just pop into the oven.  A very pretty appetizer, too.
