Has anyone made this without a bread machine?  Is there any order I should mix the ingredients?

This is an excellent recipe with good results every time I have made it. If you prefer your bread in traditional loaf pans, it will make 3 loaves. I increased the cracked rye to 1/2 cup the last time I made it and reduced the milk by 1/4 of a cup just to give a more full bodied flavour.

I used bulger wheat instead of cracked rye, same method, and half wheat flour and half white flour and it was fantastic!  I also tried it with 1 1/2 T milled flax seed and 1 1/2 T Butter instead of 3 T butter and added a 1/4 c whole flax seeds and that was great too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't wait to buy a breadmaker once I saw this recipe, but I'm disappointed in the results. My loaves are consistently about half of Clemep's photos, and extremely dense. Flavour is perfect!

I've since tried using a yeast designed for breadmakers, and got loaves about half again as big as the first batch. Can't beat the taste, though. I let the loaves rise for 40 minutes in a warm place, but it didn't help much. 
Not a baker, but need Wpg rye,
Kate

We fell in love with Winnipeg rye bread while attending the folk festival.  This recipe captures the flavor and texture we were after.  Consistently good results.  A great all purpose bread.  We have increased the amount of cracked rye, and note that we gnerally need to add more flour as the bread is kneading.

I had high hopes for this recipe. To me, it was far too sweet...  not much Rye flavour,  texture-wise, it was too soft from the high proportion of milk. I was hoping for something close to City rye, but would have been happy enough with a KUB knock-off. It didn't resemble either one. Anyway, the liquid measure also seems off in this recipe - I had to add an additional 1/4 cup of water to create the right consistency in my machine.

It turned out perfect, and it is just like the bread I had in Winnipeg.

This bread is a nice bread, I'm just not sure how long to soak the rye berries for.  I soaked them over night, but think it needs to be longer.  I will try using some light rye flour to give it a little more rye flavor.

Has worked perfect every time. One time I forgot to brush the milk on before baking and the loafs were very soft. I really liked it so will try that again. I use a convection oven so my baking times are less than 20 minutes.

Made the recipe exactly as robustpresented and the bread is light, loaves are golden brown, but it has no flavor.  Certainly  not a robust one.  Any suggestions?

The bread looks and tastes really good, but it doesn't feel or taste like rye bread. But given that this is my first time making bread, this was a really fool proof recipe.
