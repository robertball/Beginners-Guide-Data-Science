omgOOOOODDDNESSS! I made this for a dinner I hosted for my neighbors, and I was SO pleased with the flavor!! The only thing I changed, was I added fresh minced garlic to the marinade-and, Oh yes I was out of lime juice so I used lemon. AND- I was only able to marinate for about 1-2 hours, but the flavor was sensational! My new favorite grilled shrimp!!
Thank you for this recipe!!

These were pretty good but a tad too spicy for me, I suspect it was the combination of  Cajun seasoning and pepper.

Although I thought this was fantastic.... the rest of my family didn't care for it.  I would do a 5 star if you like heat and a lot of it.  It was way too spicy for even my husband.

Very tasty!  I used 1.5 lbs of raw shrimp and marinated for 5 hours.  Great tangy taste without being too hot for our girls.  I served it over some phad thai noodles.  yumm!

Very good, shrimp was not dry at all.  Used Chesapeake Bay seasoning instead of Cajun, and no seasoned salt.  Served with steamed rice.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent flavor and the spices were very good. However, I found it a bit too salty and the next time I use the marinade I will cut the salt in half.

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed the advice of others and used fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder.  Otherwise we followed the recipe to a tee.  In fairness, I have to admit we overcooked the shrimp on our grill.  Because it is propane, it runs hot and we should have given it less time.  We'll try it again that way.  Also, I want to thank the submitter for saying to put the shrimp on two skewers rather than one.  The shrimp stayed on and didn't twirl around as we were trying to turn them.

These were absolutely amazing. Could find any fresh shrimp so I used frozen that was thawed. It was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be making this again. I omitted the black pepper and toned down the Cajun a lot because I can’t do spicy and it was perfect!

I used what I had:
Garlic infused Olive Oil.
Pinch of garlic powder.
Cayenne  powder 1/2 tsp - less if you you don't want the heat.
...the rest I had and they eat every shrimp!

We loved this recipe!  I cooked them on our grill, but put them on a cooking tray that had holes on the bottom.  We will be making this many more times.

It was really good. I am not a fan of tequila so I used spiced run and still very good. took the advise of others and reduced seasoning salt so it was not too salty. I also made a reduction sauce with marinade by adding 2 tablespoons of butter and boiling to reduce. Poured over the shrimp

Made it exactly as is with a pound of 1 oz  (15-20 per lb)Jumbo Shrimp (deshelled, deveined, but left the tail on) and it came out great.  Would make again for sure.

I used fresh lime juice which I think was key, and marinated for around 3 hours or so before skewering the shrimp .

Outstanding! Best grilled shrimp I've ever made.  I did cut back on the salt because the Cajun seasoning has quite a bit. Otherwise perfect!

After looking at several similar recipes, I decided to try this one as the tequila lime combo was appealing to me. WOW! I made these with smoked andouille sausage and Spanish rice for a grilled jambalaya and it was an excellent meal! I will definitely make this recipe again!

Picked the recipe at work, and found we were missing an ingredient. Had run out of garlic powder, so used garlic salt, and omitted the salt. Also found we had lime flavoured tequila! That worked!! We were late getting home. Used a BBQ basket instead of skewers, and marinated for a half hour.

The flavor was nice but it was too salty.  I blame the store brand of Cajun seasoning which probably has more salt than a more expensive brand. If I use this recipe again, I'll leave out the seasoning salt to reduce the saltiness.

Amazing recipe, my wife and I like spicy so I  was heavy handed with the Cajun spice and the cayenne pepper. I served it with grilled zucchini and squash also marinated with the same spices.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used some regular cayenne pepper as I didn't have the Asian heat.  Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight  and it was great. Read other reviews and did not add the salt and pepper because Cajun seasoning is salty on it's own. I like things spicy so when the shrimp was on the skewers I sprinkled a little more Cajun seasoning on each side.

Just used Jumbo Shrimp, and marinated just long enough for my grill to get hot and steaks to be just all the way cooked. This was my first time cooking shrimp and it turned out very good! Will make again!
