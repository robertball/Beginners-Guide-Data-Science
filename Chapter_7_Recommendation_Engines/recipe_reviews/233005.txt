My granddaughters loved helping me make these!  I am just a little confused about the number of servings because the only Grands I could find in my market had 8 biscuits in it.  We made only half the recipe, so I'm not sure where 12 puffs comes from.  I would caution you to be sure to make sure every little seam is tightly closed!  If you see my photo, you'll know what happens if there is a little hole.  I chose to eat part of one from which the marshmallow had escaped, and it was still yummy.  I had a little butter left, so you could even go a tablespoon or two short with the melted butter (you can always melt a little more!), and I used maybe a little more of the cinnamon sugar (I would suggest spooning it over the rolls because otherwise it gets all gummy from the butter).  I would maybe even try the next time they want some of this to cut each biscuit in half horizontally to make a smaller roll.  You could put almost anything in the middle with marshmallows---I'm thinking caramel or chocolate.  Anyway, this was successful!  I was glad to have the little girls take them away so I don't even have to think about having one with all the marshmallow in it.  They were delighted!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these in 7th grade home ec class and loved them. They were a little different-we dipped the marshmallows in butter and cinnamon sugar, then wrapped them in dough. I made some of these the old way and the way your recipe states and they were both just yummy!

I use 1 can of Honey Grands  biscuits for both dinner and dessert. I took 4 of the biscuits for dinner and then used the other four biscuits for our dessert.  
Hint:  I made the cinnamon sugar biscuits while cooking dinner and then just as we were cleaning up ...I put the dessert In the oven. ...then...In 15 mins ....Mmmmm!
For easy serve: I put the biscuit desserts in cup cake papers in instead of a full cup cake pan .

We truly think that the sweet puffs were excellent. They were really fun to make, and we truly enjoyed making them. 5/5? for sure.

Quick and easy recipe that is fun to eat and pleases ones sweet tooth. The only thing I would change is next time I would add more Cinnamon. Overall a great desert and a good food for kids.

The presentation was nice. Don't know what I did wrong but as soon as I opened the muffin it was just pure liquid. I wanted to get the gooey marshmallow experience lol.

This is an amazing recipe!  I made it as is, except cut it in half because I didn't need so many.  It was a huge hit and will make again....many times!  THANK YOU!
