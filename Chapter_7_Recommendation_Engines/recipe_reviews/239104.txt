I followed the recipe, but added a teaspoon of crushed garlic when adding onions/peppers to the sausage. I served it with bow tie pasta, drizzled Trader Joes Three Cheese pasta sauce over everything - delicious!  I also had garlic toast. Will definitely make again and again.

Another simple, quick and easy recipe for those with limited time. This took all of 20 minutes yet it's packed full of flavor.

Hey this is really pretty good. I added sliced fresh garlic. I would use a little less oil.

This is my first review on All Recipes as it was that good!  Was hungry for smoked sausage and found this recipe.  I used the Hillshire Farm's All Natural smoked sausage with no nitrates, artificial flavoring or msg and made of 100% pork.  Dinner in less than 10 minutes!  Made according to recipe and was absolutely awesome!

I followed recipe, but used smoked linguica instead. Added salt, pepper and garlic powder. Also threw in an onion and 1 can diced tomatoes. Served over cheese ravioli. Oh, Mama mia! Very delicious!

I  used garlic powder and Italian seasoning  but no oregano.   I also added a sliced small zucchini and some cubed new potatoes.   Served over rice.   It was pretty good but really bland.   The smoked sausage added enough flavor to make it edible.   I don't think I will make it again.

Really enjoyed this.  We added a large, crushed clove of garlic, a pinch of dried, crushed red pepper, a few shakes of black pepper, and 1t of dried parsley, and ate over mini bow tie pasta.

We live in Australia so we don't have the same sausage brands here and the people I live with are Chinese. I served this recipe  to them with rice and they loved it, definitely will repeat this recipe.

Great, veggie-packed dinner. I only added a Tbs of minced garlic, instead of powder and a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes.

Really good and quick. 15 minutes tops. I didnâ€™t serve it over anything. Served it with a garlic buttered bagel. But pasta or rice would be good.

This was good, quick and simple...my favorite kind of dish.  The only change I made was to add a can of drained chunk pineapple, which added a nice sweet contrast.  Enjoy.

Quick, easy and so good! I did add minced garlic and fire roasted diced tomatoes. I also followed another reviewer's recommendation and served this over four cheese mashed potatoes. 

This was a great week night meal full of flavor!

Following other suggestions, I added garlic and left out oregano.  I also added about a cup of fine chopped fresh basil about a minute before taking off of the stove.  The tribe liked it, but all agreed it needed to be served on a bed of pasta next time.

I used spicy red pepper sausage and I added tiny meatballs because I wasn't sure my husband would eat the sausage.  It was really good and super easy.  I will certainly make it again.

We all liked it. It was actually rated as a 3-1/2 by the family, but to be fair I rounded up.  I used turkey smoked sausage and added a clove of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. If you are tired after work this is a quick and easy meal.
I served it with pasta.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Will definitely make again. I did cut olive oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons and at others suggestions added a half tsp. Of minced garlic. It's a keeper!

For as simple as this is, It is delicious.  The flavors don't need much of a supporting cast and really meld together.  I will definitely make this again!

This was so easy & delicious. I used smoked turkey sausage & used 1 cup of each pepper. Served with a mix of bulgar & quinoa and sliced avocados. Will definitely make again!

I made this for brunch but cooked the bell peppers separate from my italian sausages.  I had compliments how the pepper dish  went so well with the sausages. I did not add the onions due to allergies and did add home grown oregano. Also added salt, pepper, and white pepper.
