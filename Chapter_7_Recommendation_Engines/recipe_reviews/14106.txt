I get requests for this recipe every Thanksgiving, but I've made modifications.  I usually double everything except the egg, cream cheese and onion.  Even doubling the recipe, I find that half an onion is plenty, even for onion lovers.  I've also substituted sour cream for the cream cheese, with great results.

Thank you for making me a star at my Easter Dinner.  Everyone loved this dish.  I did change a few things, I didn't add the flour.  I used flavored cream cheese, green onions, added crumbled bacon.  I also put a layer of grated cheddar cheese along with the French Fried Onions on the top of the casserole - too many calories for everyday but absolutely fantastic for a holiday dinner!

Oh my....how good was this?! We loved your dish Colleen! I didn't have quite enough cream cheese so I made up the difference with low fat sour cream, however, I did double the potatoes but nothing else. I didn't see the need for the flour or for the onion, ONLY because I felt that the fried onions would work even better not only as the topping but mixed in as well and it did.  I added garlic and onion powders to the mix too. This was awesome girl and I thank you for submitting your recipe!

Quick and easy! Light and fluffy! I used leftover Yukon Gold mashed potatoes from Sunday dinner and, following the advice from another reviewer, doubled everything except the cheese (I used Neufchatel), onion and egg. I didn't have fresh onion so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder which worked great because my kids don't like to see onion. I also didn't put the french onions on the top. I did forget the flour but I don't know that it made a difference.  I also added about 1/3 c real bacon chunks. I know that made a difference!  My 13-year-old son had thirds!  I think it would be good with green onions or a touch of parsley to add color.

We made this the day after Thanksgiving as a way to use up some smashed potatoes.  We used a slightly higher potato to egg ratio and scaled up the recipe. The mashed potatoes already had cheddar and bacon in them, but we added some scallions, cooked ham, and a little extra cheddar, and baked it in one of those huge foil turkey pans (also a Thanksgiving leftover!).  We used up all the potatoes and the casserole disappeared almost instantly!

What a delightful change from the usual mashed potatoes. I kept everything the same except I doubled the potatoes. I think it would be too cream cheesy with only 2 cups potato. Definately a keeper.

Excellent recipe.  However I did modify it slightly.  I did not use the chopped onion because I just knew my kids would not like it that way.  I double the potatoes and the cream cheese, but left all the other ingredients the same amount.  It was very light, fluffy and delicious.

Tip:  Just eat less of this delicious offering if you are worried about calories.  Also if you beat the potatoes too much you will release more starch and they will become gooey.  So limit the beating of the potato by mixing other ingredients first and folding into the potatoes.  Try it and it will be even better.  Smile!

This was good. I omitted the flour and we used sour cream and/or grated cheese when serving. A nice change to plain mashed ptoatoes.

This went over pretty well last night but after reading a few of the reviews I think next time I make it I will have to add some 'extras' to make it a bit better. Even a handful of cheese mixed it probably would have made this a 5 star. Adding some left over pieces of chicken and peas would have made this a a meal. Nice starting point for me to add my own spin on the recipe. Thanks.

I have to admit that I changed this dish quite a bit, but I liked how it turned out so I thought I would post my version.  I wanted it to be a main dish so I added broccoli and cubed ham.  I used half the cream cheese + 1 cup sour cream, doubled the pepper, and added about 1 cup of shredded cheese on top.  I also cooked the onions (1/2 instead of a whole) in 1 Tbs. butter, with some minced garlic, before pouring into the potato mixture (I like my onions to be really soft).  It was delicious :)

This sounded so good but as I was making them I was getting very skeptical.  I followed the recipe exactly and as I POURED it into the casserole dish I just knew I was going to have a runny mess. Since I am living in Germany right now I have become a huge fan of Gouda cheese so I sprinkled some grated cheese with the onions on top and sprinkled with paprika for presentation.  When I took it out of the oven it was beautiful and when we put it in our mouths it was wonderful.  It didn't really look or feel like potatoes but was light and fluffy, almost like a potato souffle.  My husband and I both agreed this recipe is a keeper.  The recipe says serves two but we easily saved enough so we can have another serving tomorrow.  Don't be scared off by how it looks before you put it in the oven.  This is great!

I gave this 4 stars because everyone at our church potluck and my husband loved this dish. I didn't care for it all that much but it wasn't a bad dish. The only adjustment I made was to sautee the onion in a little bacon grease to add a little depth of flavor. Other than that I kept all else the same. My husband absolutely loves it so I guess it's a success if he's happy lol.

This was so amazing. We left out the onion because I hate onions, and we also added real bacon bits in. It was so delicious! I can't wait to make it again. I might consider doubling it.

This was a simple recipe that is a great way to spice up your mashed potatoes.  However, it had a little too much onion for our tastes.  I will make this again but cut down on the amount of onion used.

This was an interesting change from the usual mashed potatoes.

I whipped my potatoes with a couple
pats of butter and a bit of hot milk. 
I then added the cream cheese. After
that, I folded in the eggs. I changed
the chopped onion to green onion, added
some small cubed medium cheddar and a 
bit of bacon bits. I then sprinkled
the crushed french onions on top.

I baked it @ 350 for about a half hour,
uncovered. I paired it with leftover 
Cola Roast and there were none leftover.

Tasty! I will make this again. I think
it would be best paired with ham so
next time I'll do as the others did
and serve it on Easter Sunday.

This was fantastic! I brought it to a family dinner and it received compliments from everyone. I really didn't measure the potatoes, so I may have used more than 2 cups. I know I used more salt and pepper than it calls for, and I also threw in a pinch of Chipotle powder (not enough to taste, just enough to add character). This is going to be my new go-to potluck dish. I wish I hadn't waited 5 years to find a reason to make it!

Made these last night as a "test" for a dinner party buffet I am planning, they are delicious and the onions give them a really nice taste.  As per other's suggestions, I doubled the potatoes and cream cheese and added crumbled bacon  which did add more flavor.  This recipe will be on the buffet table for sure   : )

Quite a twist from your typical buttery mashed potatoes. These tasted like they could be from a fancy restaurant. Per reviews, I doubled everything except the cream cheese, egg, and onion. Definately a keeper! Nice and fluffy too!

I doubled the mashed potatoes and thought this was a great side and use of leftover mashed potatoes.  The next time I make it, I intend to add cheese and bacon to the topping.  It reminds me of twice-baked or loaded baked potatoes.  Not a hit with the teenager, but husband and I liked it.

I made this with double the mashed potatoes, left out the onion, mixed in some real bacon pieces and topped it with cheddar cheese instead of fried onions.  Also I used instant mashed potatoes.The family and I loved it!

I have been making these potatoes for years and my step-mother years before that.  My daughters (now in their late 30s) always insist on these potatoes for holiday and other special meals.

Via another cooks comment I substituted the cream cheese with sour cream (I didn't have any cream cheese) which works fine but you pretty much get a twice baked potato taste. Add bacon bits and cheddar cheese on top to complete it~ Like many others have said, halve the onions.  The full amount is just really super onion-y.

This was ok. I did use less cream cheese and added little chunks of montery jack, but the onions were a little crunchy inside...which made my kids notice them. The potatoes were kinda runny. It wasn't bad, but I won't make it again.

Didn't like the texture and it was way too sweet for a main course dish.  Will not try it again.

I was skeptical but it turned out great! I followed it pretty close but had to triple the recipe for the large group I was feeding, so it may not have been exact. Was great!!

I made this recipe and did what another person mentioned. I upped the potatoes to 4 cups and eggs to 3. I did however fry the onion in some bacon fat first. Added it all together and sprinkled w the ff onions. At first hubby only took a spoonful but soon went back for lots more. Excellant recipe...thanks

This was wonderful! I am always looking for something new to do with potatoes, and this one is a keeper. I did not change anything with the recipe, although I probably had closer to 3 cups of mashed potatoes. This dish came out perfect! The potatoes were creamy and I loved the crunchy onion on top. I did not have any leftover mashed potatoes so I made them and assembled the whole dish ahead of time. When it was time for dinner, all I had to do was sprinkle on the fried onions and pop it in the oven. Delicious!!

The family loved the casserole. We did leave out the onions because of allergys. To make it a main dish meal for eight(I always make enough for leftovers to take to work) I quadrupled the recipe and when I put it into the casserole dish I first layered four cups of leftover turkey and 2 pounds of aldis frozen green beans then I spread the potato mix over everything. This made the green beans particulary good I thought. My children loved it although my husband said it had to much cream cheese.

I enjoyed this, but I'll definitely make some changes next time.  I'll sauté the onions first so they don't taste so raw, and I'll double the amount of potatoes as some other commenters have suggested.  Good recipe though :)

This was only okay.  It wasn't as light and fluffy as I expected, but more runny.  It was WAY too oniony.  I may cut back on the onion next time I try it and I may also use less cream cheese.

It took alot longer to cook through then the recipe called for.

This was really good and my guest, including an 8 month old, really liked it.  But, I doubled the recipe (except I used 3 eggs and left much of the onion out) to make sure I had enough and my husband and I thought there was too much cream cheese. If you are making 4 servings, only use 1 pkg of cream cheese.

This was excellent!  I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled everything except the cream cheese, onions and eggs.  I used green onions and added a cup of cheddar cheese to the mashed potato mixture before topping it with the friend onions.  Can't wait to make this for a special holiday and impress my family!

With changes, I enjoyed it for a change of pace.
I left the uncooked onions out of it completely, personal preference.
Used 1/2 block of cream cheese, over 2 cups of mashed potatoes.
After mixing together this recipe, minus the onion...I spread a very thin layer of sour cream over the top (probably 2T), then added shredded cheese (probably 1/2c), sprinkled bacon bits (

I thought this recipe was a little bland. I have read many of the reviews that suggested adding other ingredients. This might be a very good base recipe, but I would suggest adding your favorite baked potato toppings.

Really, really tasty. Loved the texture, very fluffy and light - do NOT omit the eggs or flour unless you want a much denser end result. Made no changes except to caramelize the onions before adding to potato mixture. We thought the amount of onion was perfect - others had noted a 'too oniony' taste - maybe caramelizing made the difference. I also used a hand mixer on med-fast for about 4 minutes to get the mixture really high and fluffy and then folded gently into the casserole dish. Yummy! I may take a previous reviewer's advice and add some bacon next time.

Thanks for the submission

Everyone would have gone up for thirds if there was any left!  Oh, I left out the onion because I didn't have any and it still turned out great.

it was alright.  My two kids didn't like it AT ALL.  My husband who LOVES potatoes didn't take more than a tablespoon.  It wasn't terrible, i think we are just purists when it comes to our mashed potatoes.

I really enjoyed using my left over mashed taters for this.  I followed the recipe except I added about 1/4 cup of real bacon bits.  YUMMMM.... even hubby thought they were good and he's very picky!

We really enjoyed this recipe; however, next time I will decrease the amount of onion used by at least half, and use instant potatoes to cut down on time.  It was a great twist on traditional mashed potatoes.

I made this as a side dish with Easter dinner.  I had t o feed 24 very larger eaters.  With 20 pounds of potatoes it still came together in no time.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone had great things to say.  Thank you !!

This recipie is really good, the french-fried onion toping added a little too much of
a strong onion flavor than I like, but  the flavors all come together very well.
I would like to add that this dish is best consumed right after it is made, as
the onion-topping gets soggy when stored in the fridge. So, plan to prepare this for more
than two, so it can be eaten all at once wtih no soggy-topped leftovers.

I was pleasantly surprised. This dish was prepared easily and enjoyed by everyone, even my finicky kids. I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to cut down on calories, and also left off the fried onions though I think they would make a great addition.

I had to triple the recipe because this sounded like a small portion, but I ended up with way too much.  It all still got eaten though.  I added bacon and the kids loved it.
