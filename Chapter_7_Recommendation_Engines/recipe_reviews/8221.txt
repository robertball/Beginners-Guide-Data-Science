Having literally made over 10,000 of these over the last 25 years, here's the real deal on these: forget the salt, it adds nothing and nobody can tast the difference. Don't substitue Devils cake fot this, it's not the same. Use Special Dark cocoa if you like dark chocolate. A little extra vanilla never hurts anything. The filling is the most crucial part of this and can be very tricky to master. You need to soften the cream cheese prior to mixing, set on the counter for an hour or two, DO NOT MICROWAVE. Mix the cream cheese, sugar and egg just until there are no more lumps, then add 1/2 bag of chocolate chip. Here's where most mess this up; DO NOT OVER MIX. If filling gets runny then it carmalizes on top  and never "sinks" into cake. If under mixed then filling only tastes like cream cheese and cake batter taste is off. Within the first hour after cooking, batter is gooey but delicious. Following day filling firms up for a different texture(still good), but microwave for 10-15 seconds can re-gooey it for you if you like that better. Also I make 18 not 24 with exact same recipe.

Yum!  Here is my $.02 about the recipe...some observations: 1) The cream cheese mixture is very runny, some previous reviews expressed concern about that, but it sets while cooking. 2) The cream cheese mixture is about twice what you need.  Double the cake portion. 3) I only needed to cook them 20 minutes.  4) I got 1 dozen regular sized muffins out of the recipe (w/o doubling the cake portion).   Changes:  1) I used a heaping 1/3 cup of cocoa.  2) Milk instead of water.  3) Splenda instead of sugar.

These were great, I used boxed devil's food cake mix instead of the batter for less prep time. I filled the cups half-full and then put in a mound of the cream cheese mix and then topped them off with more batter to make them like true cream-filled cupcakes.  They still made 24 and took around 20 min. to bake!

I acquired this reciped in 1966 - it's a family classic but I add a 1/2 tsp. of salt to the dry mix, use white vinegar and use chopped walnuts on top. I use mini cupcake pans & two liners - 1 tbsp dark batter 1 tsp light batter 350 15 mins. Seeing that these are so rich, I just pretty them up with a dusting of powdered sugar-- no icing is necessary. They store well in the fridge and get perked up with a fresh coat of powdered sugar when holday guests pop in.

Like many other reviewers, I substituted coffee for water (and added a spoonful of dry milk powder to the flour mixture).  What really made them good, though, was the spoonful of strawberry jam I dropped on the top of each before baking.  Strawberry was what I had; using blackberry or plum jam could give these a sophisticated, Black Forest-type taste, and I'll try that next time--or perhaps swirling berry puree throughout the cream cheese mixture, or just dropping a frozen raspberry into the centre of each cupcake.  The berry touch really 'lifts' the cupcake; I recommend it!

Very good.  I substituted coffee for the water and it was excellent.  I also added a little vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  I was taking them to a party so I drizzled them with a chocolate glaze just to dress them up.  They looked great and tasted great too.  It does make a lot of filling but I wouldn't cut that in half; I filled each half full with the chocolate mixture and used a heaping tablespoon of filling for each cupcake.  I ended up with 19.  The baking soda reacts to the vinegar so you really wouldn't want to omit it.

These are the BEST!!  ;d  I used a devils food cake mix to make it even quicker and I had regular size choc. chips instead of mini ones, but it turned out so delicious anyway.  I had to be careful about how I lifted the cupcakes out of the tins - take a knife or spatula and try to pre-loosen the bottoms before taking them out. Next time I might try paper lining and see how that goes.  Also, I only had one muffin tin, so I made 12 muffins and one 9" round cake.  The cake also turned out excellent. Again, pre-loosen the bottoms before removing the slices.  Also, though the cake tastes great, it's not very 'pretty.'  That's my food for thought.... :)

These were so good!  I might add orange or raspberry flavoring to the batter next time to add a hint of another flavor.  Definitely use mini chocolate chips because the big ones sink to the bottom.

These cupcakes were phenomenal! The rich chocolate paired perfectly with the sweet cream cheese filling.

If you're like me, and can't resist the urge to make a few teeny weeny changes, here's what I'd suggest:

Use coffee instead of water. It really brings out the chocolate flavor.

Unless you are all about the cake, make the full amount of cream cheese filling! (I halved the cream cheese mixture because I only had 4 ounces of cream cheese left and wished I hadn't.) It will look like you don't need the full amount when you are filling the liners but once the cake bakes and expands it should create the perfect ratio.

If you prefer rich chocolate flavor, use a chopped up dark chocolate bar in place of the semisweet chocolate chips in the filling. I used a 70% cacao bar. For the cake, use half dark chocolate cocoa powder and half unsweetened.

Last, as another reviewer suggested, add a dollop of jam to the middle of the filling. I used a four berry blend. This really took the cupcake to a different level!

After the cupcakes have cooked, top these bad boys off with fresh or candied raspberries to impress your family and friends!

Doctored up or as is, these cupcakes are my new go-to recipe when I want something sweet!

Golfingandrew is RIGHT ON!  I've been making these for 33 years?!  I think they are best after the sit and "age" for 3 days.  I make batches of these at Christmas and am famous for them : )  If your cream cheese mixture is "runny" DC girl...you are doing something way wrong-use hand mixer until nice a creamy.  Fill cupcake 1/2 full and then add a HUGE heaping tablespoon of cream cheese mixture or you will have too much left over when finished.

Meh. The cream cheese part is yummy, but the cake itself is blah. I even followed other's advice and replaced the water with coffee, still blah. I've had way better black bottom cupcakes. These are very pretty, though, so they get a 3.

Here is my .02 cents, I live in colorado. The high altitude doesn't work for the cake recipe. Use a devils food cake mix and follow high altitude directions. Make sure the cream cheese AND egg are at room temp and do not over-mix. I mix by hand to ensure this doesn't happen. My cream cheese center is never runny and always sinks to the bottom. some of the pictures posted look horrible and I have never had a problem with center not sinking, doing it my way. The top is only cake, never ANY cream cheese visible. It is always a surprise when people bite into them. I also frost with either chocolate ganache or cream cheese frosting. These cupcakes will never be beat. DELICIOUS!

The chocolate chips (Ghiradelli 60% cacao) overpowered this cupcakeI Next time I will use only HALF the amount of chips or use tollhouse chocolate chips.  I made a mini bundt cake, placing the cream cheese filling in the bottom and then covering with the chocolate. Baked for 32 min. I also got 4 additional regular sized muffins, baked at 23 minutes. There was alot of extra cream cheese filling left over.  My filling did sink well into the mini bundt cake, but sat on top of the cupcakes.

I loved these! I like how you can really taste chocolate instead of just a generic sweet taste.

The key seems to be to not overfill with cake batter and be generous with the filling. This balances out the dark chocolate flavor with sweetness and makes the cupcakes more moist overall. Also, try to push the filling into the batter a bit. I wouldn't change a thing. Although, I might try adding vanilla flavored coffee instead of the water. Probably with cream and sugar, just the way I'd drink it.

I baked the first batch for 26 minutes and they seem a little dry, although still very good. I baked the second batch for 24 minutes and they seem perfect, so 25-30 minutes may be a little too long.

I've made these cupcakes many times to rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is use plain white vinegar instead of cider vinegar and coffee instead of water (it enhances the chocolate flavor, doesn't make the cake taste like coffee).  I find it helps to use a plastic storage bag with a corner snipped off to fill the cupcakes with the cream cheese mixture.  Excellent recipe.  (I've doubled the cupcake recipe and made a layer cake with it..outstanding for a batter that contains no eggs or dairy!

These were perfect ! ! ! 
I made MINI CUPCAKES and adjusted the time to only 15 minutes. If you are making mini's make sure to cut down the recipe or you will have way to much batter! :)

absolutely the best cupcake recipe around...  I made mine in empty ice cream cones instead of cupcake liners, and then iced them with butter cream icing.  they were FANTASTIC!  Chocolatey, moist cakes with amazing flavor and texture, and the filling tastes like chocolate chip cheesecake!  i actually had leftover filling and just baked it alone and they made little mini cheesecakes-oh my GOD was it good!  Again, STRONGLY recommend this recipe, i know i will never look for another chocolate cupcake recipe again---THIS IS IT!

I changed only two things.  Used 1/3 cup of cocoa powder because it wasn't chocolaty enough for my taste, and I omitted the chocolate chips in the cream cheese filling.  They were AMAZING.  Mine baked about 20 minutes.

Great recipe. I followed the sugguestions of other reviewers and substituted coffee for water. They turned out great-moist and chocolately. No need to frost these, they're perfectly sweet and so pretty with the black and white swirl of the top. I got 18 cupcakes out of this recipes. I will definitely make these again!

I remembered having these as a child and  I found myself craving them 20 years later.  I had to go back to the mom who made them for the recipe.  We cheat and use a devil's food box mix and then add a spoonful of the cream cheese/choc chip mixture like the recipe calls for.  I think they're just as good this way (& quicker!) Doesn't taste like a box mix because the cream cheese/chips add a homemade touch.

I love these cupcakes and they are a hit every time that I make them.  I use regular size chocolate chips and use either cider or white vinegar depending on what I have on hand.  Here is a secret that I shared with a pastry chef who loves them but thought mine turned out better than his!  **** refrigerate the cream cheese mixture while you make the cake batter or even overnight! *********

Yummy cupcakes! Recipe made about 14 large cupcakes. Baked for 25 min, but could have taken them out at 23 min- they cooked a lil hard on the top, but nothing major. The center was soft and moist and the cream cheese filling came out perfect! The only changes I made were to sub coffee for water and omit the 1/8 tsp of salt from the cream cheese filling. One warning: These little numbers are addictive- you can't eat just one!!

I omitted the salt and used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. These were good, but the batter was not as rich, fudgy and chocolatey as I was expecting. Next time I think I'll actually melt some chocolate into the cupcake batter.

Very good rich chocolate cupcakes!!! Totally fulfilled my craving. I went by the recipe exactly except for one adjustment and that was using coffee instead of water which I recommend to everyone!

Very good and easy to make and take for a pot luck, football game, picnic.  Because they dont have frosting, they travel well, and can be made a day ahead since they taste better the next day.

Thanks alot for the great recipe. I got exactly 8oz of expired cream cheese and don't know what to do as it hasn't gone bad until I got this site. Bake this today and it was excellent!! I follow exactly the instruction but I only get 5 cupcakes n too much cream cheese. Immediately I make another batch but i'm out of vanilla essence. I grate 2 lemon zest instead. I think I have to change my measuring cup as the amount is incorrect. Oh ya and I used apple cider vinegar.

I'm a college kid who makes these frequently, and they're a hit in the dorm! I made a few changes as suggested by others and tweaked it myself a bit....replace the water with cooled coffee and the oil with no sugar added apple sauce. Also, I put a little more than a teaspoon of either raspberry or pineapple preserves in the middle before baking!

These were fantastic! I made a single batch of chocolate, but will do a double batch next time. I had a lot of cream cheese mixture left over. My husband ate 11 out of 12 of them in one night...these are a keeper!!

GolfingAndrew's review could be mine: my orig. recipe was from a local bakery 25+ yr ago. Hints: my cake recipe is about 1.5x this, so the filling/cake ratio works. I use foil cupcake liners,good quality cocoa,no salt, less sugar in each part, minichips, don't overmix the filling, and blend the cake ingred. in the food processor. Biggest tip: if the filling touches the edge of the cupcake it will still be yummy but not as pretty. These are wonderful,dense chocolaty, & not too sweet. If there are leftovers, haha, they freeze well.  Note: a cake mix produces more of the jumbo cake-like muffins avail. at coffee bars.   IMHO, these are absolutely delightful as written and one of my most-requested recipes.

Very good and what i remember my grandma making, but never had a recipe. This is how my experience was, I used mini cupcakes instead becuase i made these for christmas and thought a big cupcake would be too much for people, plus they are rich and chocolately. Baked them for 15 minutes. I still had half of the cream cheese mixture left over so i made a second batch of the cupcake part to use it up. I used weak coffee instead of water just thought it would give a nicer flavor. Only filled then half way with chocolate then a tsp of cream cheese so they didnt run over the liners.  And they came out wonderful.

I would have given these 5 stars except that I didn't like the cream cheese topping too much.  It was a little too cheesy for me.  But the cupcake batter was delicious!!!  I didn't have any vegetable oil, and substituted canola instead, and the batter smelled awful, but the smell was gone after they had finished baking, and left a wonderful and moist cupcake.  Next time I will try them without the cream cheese topping and just a little vanilla icing instead.

All in all, a very good cupcake!

My husband requested cupcakes and I had all of the ingredients for this recipe so I gave it a whirl.  He loved them, so I'll be making them again.  I substituted 1/2 of the water for a blend of milk and coffee in the batter.  Coffee always compliments chocolate flavor.  I was forced to used regular sized chocolate chips, didn't have the mini ones, but they turned out great.  In fact, I liked the larger burst of chocolate in the filling.  Reduced the recipe serving size to "18" and got a perfect 12 cupcakes...I like to fill my muffin pans enough to get a healthy sized cupcake.

I did not care for this recipe. I am a seasoned baker and a cupcake aficionado, so I was really excited about making these. As always, I'd read several black bottom recipes beforehand. But they just turned out dry. Plus, there was not enough of the cake mixture, nor enough cocoa. I probably should have added some sour cream (as another recipe suggested) because they were dry-definitely way less cooking time than stated; I'd say about half.

These cupcakes are great.  I've made them five different time and they are always a hit.  This recipe barely has enough for 24 cupcakes but it works.  I've also made just 12 using the same amount.  The cupcakes turn out giant but the cake engulfs the cream center and it's delicious either way.

These were good. I tried to save time & used a box mix. My mix was a little dry. The cream cheese mixture was excellent. Contrary to what others said, you can soften your cream cheese in the microwave & it'll be fine. Put in microwave for 30 seconds at 40% power. It's perfect! When mixed with egg & sugar, it wasn't runny at all.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out really salty. I would suggest leaving out the salt completely. the chocolate batter was perfect but the cream cheese made them salty.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out really good.  You need to put a generous amount of cream cheese filling in each cupcake.  This recipe made 18 cupcakes for me and I baked them for about 30 minutes.  Thanks!

These blackbottoms are great! 
I just made a few changes. I doubled the chocolate chips and didn't use miniature. I used white vinegar instead of cider. 
I also adjusted the quantity of batter in each cupcake liner. I used 1/3 chocolate, but added more than a "dollop" of cream cheese mixture. I used a healthy, heaping tablespoon.
They were amazing.

These were excellent cupcakes.  I beat the cream cheese mixture until totally light and fluffy, and it did not sink at all!!  I doubled the recipe and got 42 cupcakes, enough to take to an office potluck and to send over to the kids/grandkids house.  They were much appreciated by everyone.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but used bittersweet choc chips.  I did not mix the chips into the cream cheese mixture, just sprinkled on top and baked.  I only baked for 20 minutes.  The cupcakes were not overly sweet.  I used half coffee/half milk instead of the water.  I also used about 3/4 cup to 1 cup of cocoa (for the double batch) and the choc cake part was really chocolately and good.  All in all, I will definitely make these again.  Another good point -- they were really easy to make!!

I used to make this from scratch but I realized that substituting the actual cake batter for boxed Devil's Food Cake batter is soo much easier, less time consuming, and it comes out delicious!!

Delish - rich and gooey and decadent. I did pull a no-no. I only had soft cream cheese in a tub, and tried to use that the first time and it melted all over the top of the cupcake, so looked bad even though it tasted good. The 2nd time using the block style cream cheese it was perfect --- mea culpa.

I really love these. So moist, rich, and super easy. Here's a great tip; I used a large cookie scoop to transfer the batter to the cupcake liners and it came out to exactly 24, evenly filled cupcakes. Then I used a small cookie scoop to top the batter with the cream cheese mixture right in the center. They came out perfectly and the cream cheese mixture sunk into the batter as intended. Happy baking!

Very yummy! I've made these before and alternate between the cake recipe and boxed cake mix, depending on how much time I want to spend measuring and mixing. I also have no cream cheese mix peaking out and frost with vanilla or chocolate frosting. Wonderful recipe!

This is one of my favorite cupcake recipes. I don't change a thing with the ingredients. The only things I have noticed is that I never use all the filling and my cupcakes are always done at 20 mins.

These are delicious (and I mean delicious), but there were a few problems for me:

1. I ended up with more chocolate batter than the cream cheese mixture. I ended up swirling whatever remains of the cream cheese I could scrape from the bowl into the chocolate mixture and baking it. The small cake tasted awesome dusted with powdered sugar.

2. I used silicone cupcake cups, which might have caused the problem, because my cake batter ended up cooking very slowly, so the cream cheese was turning golden brown when the cake finally turned into a brownie-like texture.

3. I used 3 tablespoons of batter and 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese. 

4. I used regular chocolate chips. They tasted awesome after refrigerating, there were chunks of chocolate in them (yum!).

5. Use light cream cheese. Each cupcake is a whopping 171 calories. There's no taste difference.

Everyone loved these cupcakes. I couldn't stop eating them either. Time to hit the gym.

My mom used to make these for us when we were kids. I am happy to carry on this tradition now that I've found the recipe online. I made these this evening and they turned out just like they did when I was a kid. LOVE these. They also freeze really well. We always made these around Christmas time.

Loved the chocolate cake but the gooey center tasted a little like uncooked dough.  Probably wont make these again.  The taste is really good though, we didn't throw them out!

Three words: Om nom nom. I used dark chocolate chunks instead of mini chips because the only brand of mini chips available was Nestle (booooo). They gave the cupcake a more sophisticated and less sugary taste. I also used a skewer to swirl the two batters a bit before baking, giving the top a pretty marble finish. Delish!

Everyone loves this, they disappear so fast! 
I make them as mini, and I always double the cream cheese mixture because that's the best part. 
This is an awesome recipe for social events or for just snacks at home.

I used regular chocolate chips, increased the cocoa by one TB. and lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup. Excellent. 1 cup of sugar would not be too sweet though!

I bake quite a bit and thought this was an interesting recipe.  However, they were just okay.  I would omit the salt completely and maybe even the vinegar...........it seems like that is what I tasted the most in these cupcakes.

These were easy to make and scrumptious! I used regular sized chocolate chips, and I used half of the batter to make 12 cupcakes and then used the rest to make a small sheet cake, which came out sort of like brownies. I preferred the cupcakes :) I'll definitely be making them again. Chocolatey and delicious!

These are easy AND delicious...my two favorite things in a recipe!! The chocolate portion is so moist and just the right amount of chocolate. I only had regular size chocolate chips on hand, so I decreased the amount to 1/2 a cup..however, next time I will only decrease the amount to 3/4 cup if I use reguale size chips again. So yummy and rich no frosting is needed!!

i thought these cupcakes were really GOOD! some things that i changed about it were that i added white vinegar and i put milk chocolate chips. TO me the pictures that i looked at of people that have made the Cupcakes seem to look better! but anyways i am glad that i made these because they were really good! but one thing is that i followed the recipe thinking that it was going to be 24 cupcakes but it was actually 15 cupcakes. but oh well. THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made these for my daughters snack day, we made these as miniature cupcakes, instead of the regular size ones.  I thought they were really good, and they were a big hit at school.  My husband liked them too, but he said he would like to try them as regular size, because a dollop of cream cheese wasn't quite enough on a mini cupcake.  He also thought that you should cut down the vanilla to a 1/2 tsp, I didn't find the vanilla taste to overwhelming, so it is just a matter of taste.  I will definitely make these again, as they disappeared as quickly as we made them.  Side note: We got about 60 cupcakes doing it the mini way.  It was also a Valentine's Day snack so I added little conversation hearts on top of the cupcake before sticking them in the oven.  I also baked them for only 23 minutes at 350*, and that seemed to do the trick!  Awesome dessert Laura, thanks for posting!

I was so excited to make these because they sound delicious. But for me it ended there. They sounded good but didn't taste like I wanted them to. I made the recipe as is with no changes and found the cream cheese mixture came out a bit too tangy and just not sweet enough. All in all, I will not be making these again :(

The recipe made 18 cupcakes with a few slight changes.  I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to cream cheese mixture and a small spoonful of raspberry jam to top the cupcakes before putting in the oven. Stir with a toothpick to distribute the jam.  When they cooled there was an indentation on the top, so I filled it with a ganache made with 1/4 c. chocolate chips, 1/6 c. scaled heavy cream, and 1/8 tsp. vanilla. Taking them to school tomorrow....see what the other teachers say.

Hmmm, these were great! I made them for work and I should have done at least double batch... I cannot stand the smell of vinegar, so I did not use it at all. I used one egg and filled to 1 cup with water instead. It worked great. I was a bit concerned about filling the moulds only to 1/3, but they rose perfectly just to the rim! The ratio of dough and filling was perfect for me. I think they need refrigerating and are better the next day. This was great, because I had to bake them the evening before. Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I've made these twice now, and I recommend substituting coffee for water - I didn't do this the first time and the chocolate flavor was lacking. I followed the directions otherwise, including filling my cupcake wrappers 1/3 full, and they made short little cupcakes that didn't rise above the rim. Next time I will either double the recipe or make fewer, but in either case I will fill the cups to at least 1/2 full. One more tip: use a toothpick to gently swirl the filling with the batter to make a pretty pattern. This greatly improves the look of the cupcakes. I will certainly return to this recipe again and again - so good!!

These are pretty good- definately one to make again. I used white vinegar- instead of the apple cider vinegar and tasted fine. I also added more chocolate chips (that never hurt a thing!)Also, mine only made 18 instead of the 24.

These where really good! I made them for Mother's Day, and my mom loved them! I would use cupcake liners, because the cupcakes stuck to the cupped pan. And I made them without the cider vinegar.


I will use this recipe again!! :D :D :D

These were a big hit in my house.  I used regular chocolate chips because it is all I had on hand and it worked fine for me.  The recipe did not state to refrigerate them but since they have a cream cheese center I felt it was best.  They are good cold but can be warmed for a few seconds in the microwave for that just baked taste.  The kids love them!  The recipe yielded only 16 cupcakes so scale up if you need 24.

This recipe was really good! If you want to make it even fast, I found out that you could use a chocolate cake mix or a devil's food cake mix. If you chose to use the cake mix,try using a cake mix that has pudding in it. This makes the cupcakes really fluffy and good.

These were kind of bland to me...the chocolate flavor wasnt very strong and the filling needs some vanilla or something.  Also, there wasnt nearly enough chocolate batter, but too much filling.  these arent terrible, but there's got to be a better recipe out there...

Wonderful recipe!  Very moist.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think these cupcakes are even better with frosting on top.  Try a raspberry cream cheese frosting....that was my favorite on them.

I followed the recipe exactly, (except I cheated and used a cake mix, betty crocker devils food I think) and they were delicious. I wouldnt compare them to cupcakes with icing in the middle, they were more like a cake with a cheesecake centre. YUMMY! I did have to double my cream cheese filling though as I had alot more cake batter from the mix, but, then I had lots of chream cheese filling left over. I frooze it though for next time, and Ill see how it makes out after being frozen.

I made these for my sister's birthday and they were a big hit!  I added some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, filled the cups about half way with the chocolate batter, and added a very generous dollop of the cream cheese.  They were beautiful and delicious, I would definitely make this again.

my suggestion is to cut the amount of filling because then you'll have a lot of left over.  also cut the sugar, using this recipe without elimination is way too sweet.

Excellent cupcake! 
I followed other people's  modifications: use milk instead of water, increase the cocoa to about 1/3-1/2 cup.  I also added 1/4 cup of walnut.  The cupcake is done after 20 min, and I didn't have any cream mix leftover.
Definately will make this again.

This recipe is a favorite I've had for years and is a permanent part of my collection - my sister and I make them at least once a year.  We use regular sized chocolate chips.  The filling is the best part and I wouldn't reduce the amount as a prior review suggested.  I bake 20-25 min. and have a note on my recipe that they are better undercooked than overcooked. We like them both right out of the oven while the chips are still gooey and the next day when the chips have hardened.  It only makes 18 for me.  This recipe is exactly the same as "Grandma Gudgel's Black Bottom Cupcakes" and "Black Bottom Cupcakes II".

This is a wonderfull recipie! Some pointers though, the cream cheese mixter will set up perfectly within the cupcake if you whip it well first. Also, it is a moist cupkcake, make sure you use a paper liner and spra PAM within the paper liner for best results. yummy!!!

My fiance told me one day about these incredible cupcakes sold only locally at a country grocery store. He brought a package home and asked me if I could duplicate them. Looking at the list of ingredients, I thought I'd see if a recipe existed on this site. When I found this recipe I knew immediately I had hit the jackpot. The next day I whipped up a batch of the cupcakes to suprise him.
He was so impressed that he had to tell his entire family about them, and then I had to make more batches for everyone since it is a family favorite.
These cupcakes turn out perfect everytime. I've even made them gluten-free by substituting the wheat flour for a combination of rice and sweet sorghum flours. Absolutely the best!

These are really delicious. I brought them to work and everybody loved them. I didn't have cider vinegar, and it didn't seem to make a difference. I also had to use regular sized chocolate chips and they were fine. YUMMMM.

These are really good. The most important thing I have learned is that you should COOK THEM THE DAY BEFORE you eat them. For some strange reason, they taste 10X better the next day.
I make them in cupcake and regular layer circle cake.
I also only bake them for 25 min....seems to be fine.

I remember these from when I was a kid.  A neighbor used to make them so I was interested to try them for myself 30 years later.  They just didn't do it for me this time.  I love cream cheese, I LOVE chocolate...and I even make a few with jelly.  I would make them again because my family really liked them but I would say that there are other recipes that thrill me more.

Really love the chocolate cake part! As for the filling, it was descent. I had used regular chocolate chips because that's all I had so it sunked in the bottom (or is it supposed to be like that?) and my husband said the gooey chocolate is the best part.

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe because one batch made just one dozen and I needed more than that.  The cupcakes turned out moist and delicious - no frosting needed!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a teaspoon of my homemade strawberry freezer jam to the cupcake just before baking.  It added a wonderful touch. I made these for a group of college students and they all loved them.  I will definiately make these again!

Wonderful!! 

I put in 1/3 c cocoa to make them more chocolatey.

I also made them in mini muffin cups (yields just about 48). Around 20 minutes @ 350* for a 24 count mini muffin pan. I actually stopped using a timer and just kept an eye on them. Remove when the cream cheese is starting to get tan.

Last thing...many people said there was too much cream cheese batter left over. I filled additional cups with that renaming batter and my fiance loved it. It was like poor-man's chocolate chip cheese cake. =)

I LOVE these things! My mom made them for every picnic/BBQ I can remember. Our family trick is to add about 3/4 c. of coconut. It's so fantastic that way! But she always used a cake mix so I was excited to try this recipe. The first go round I baked as directed and it was a burnt disaster! I think the temp is too high!!! I tried it again at 325 for 16 minutes and it worked much better!

Amazingly delicious and incredibly moist! And honestly, not too bad for you!  I follow the recipe except for one step:  I don't add the chocolate chips directly to the cream cheese mixture.  I wait until the cupcakes are ready to go into the oven and then drop a few chocolate chips on top of the cream cheese.
Everyone loves them!!!

Great recipe. If you want to dress them up with frosting, try Rick's Buttercream, (using half the recipe). Follow reader's suggestions and use half butter, half shortening. Beat at least 10 minutes on high. Makes a light, not to sweet, perfect compliment to these. Springle some colored sugar or springles on them and they look beautiful.

These are pretty good.  I made no changes the first time i made them and i was a little disappointed.  The middle was not gooey at all.  I made them again and omitted the egg, warmed the cream cheese and baked for 23 minutes. I could actually taste the cream cheese then.  My niece thinks the cake portion could be sweeter but i thought they were fine.  They are much better cold, don't eat them right out of the oven.  they are richer once the chocolate chips set up again.

I have used this recipe for over a year now and forgot to rate it!!!  Maybe I was in such a state of euphoria from how great these are and my brain wasn't working!!  Love these Love these Love these!!

I just made them and can never get the ratio of cupcake holders right with the amount of batter I have.  Either way, I double the recipe and using standard sized cupcake pans, I was able to get 31.  So if you're trying to do the standard 24, you might want to double it and enjoy the extras.

Thanks a ton for this recipe!!

Good, but too fluffly.  I have tried other versions and prefer a more dense brownie like consistency.  Also, they weren't chocolatey enough... they need more flavor.  I will not use this recipe again.

Made exactly as the recipe stated and they are GREAT! I did microwave the cream cheese for 19 seconds to soften, the cream cheese batter after mixing was not runny for me, it thickened up even more after sitting for 20 minutes (between batches, only have 1 muffin tin). The cake batter was very thin looking, I was concerned but they came out great! Filled closer to half full and got 17 cupcakes + 1 runt LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe, these ingredients are usually something I always have on hand so that's a plus!

The chocolate cake would be GREAT on it's own...I used 1 C. all purpose flour + 1/2 C. wheat flour.  And 1/2 C. EACH of Splenda and White Sugar.  Upped the cocoa to 1/3 C.and only used 1/4 t. Salt along with the 1 t. baking soda.

I looked at the cream cheese mixture as a substitution for frosting - we could not really tell the mini chocolate chips were in it though:(   I omitted the salt and added 1/2 t. Vanilla Extract in the cream cheese mixture and it turned out fine.
 
Sprayed JUMBO muffin tins (it made 10) and baked for 35 minutes until the cream cheese is JUST beginning to brown a bit.  
We ate a couple hot out of the oven sinced they smelled soooooo good & will be interested to see how they are after a couple of days as well - IF they make it that long :0)   THIS IS ONE I WILL MAKE AGAIN & AGAIN !!

Awesome cupcakes, and really easy to make! I used Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa and Ghiradelli 60% dark choc chips instead because I'm not a milk chocolate fan, and they came out fantastic! Big hit at my son's preschool for a surprise birthday party!

Great recipe. My suggestion is to double ingredients in step 3. If you don't, you will have left over filling.

There was nothing extraordinary about theses, but they were a nice, simple, and tasty cupcake.  Very moist, and very easy to make.  I followed the directions, with the exception of using reduced fat cream cheese, and they turned out very well.  I'd make these again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the chocolate cupcake part was divine, as was the cream cheese mixture. But because other reviews suggested the cream cheese had too much left over, I decided to halve that bit. However, mixed with the egg, it turned out a little too runny and baked on top of the cupcake instead of sinking in! The end result was still divine, but if i stick to my version again (half the cream cheese filling was the perfect amount) I will put into the muffin pan a little batter, then some cream cheese, then more bater so the cream cheese ends up in the middle! Awesome recipe as is. Will make again!

Very good - but the cheesecake middle seemed a bit runny and had a few too many choc chips (seems impossible I know).  I recall making these before with a different recipe that worked a bit better.

When I came across this recipe yesterday, my immediate thought was - whay have I never made these?!  I love chocolate, I love cream cheese - these would be the perfect cupcake combination.  And they are ~ My daughter says these are the best cupcakes ever.  I was worried about the vinegar in them because the batter had a definite vinegar scent to it, but the baked cupcakes are delicious - and no vinegar taste.  These baked up very nicely and I just drizzled them with a chocolate glaze to finish.  Thanks for a spectacular cupcake recipe!

Well, I'm just eating my second cupcake right now.  The only changes in the recipe that I made was adding a little more baking cocoa and a teaspoon extra of vanilla.  The changes I wish I had made were to add milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Since the cocoa is a dark, bitter chocolate...adding the milk chocolate chips would have added much more depth to the chocolate flavors.  I always mix semi-sweet and milk chips in cookies for that exact reason and I wish I had thought of it in making these cupcakes.  I didn't use cupcake liners but rather just generously sprayed the pan with cooking spray and they popped out pretty easily.  I baked these cupcakes for 21 minutes.  Any longer and they would have been over cooked or burned.  For me they made exactly 18 regular sized cupcakes.  There was a little extra filling but I made my center dollops a little larger to use more of it up which didn't affect the cupcakes themselves.  I think these are decent cupcakes.  Nothing super exciting.  I think reviewers who added berries or jam were probably onto something good.  They aren't the most attractive cupcakes in the world but topping them with a light cream frosting might help.

Delicious! I made these exactly as the recipe called, minus the salt in the cream cheese filling. I also made sure to beat the cream cheese filling just enough to get rid of the lumps, and it maintained a nice batter-like consistency - not runny at all!

Fabulous!!!  I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla and an extra 1/4 cup of ghiradelli cocoa.  The recipe made 16 cupcakes and I baked them for 23 minutes.  They were delicious...big hit of the school BBQ!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I had to make without the chips because I didn't have any, but I think I like them better without anyway. These were great, but not exactly like the BBC's I've had in the past. I will definitely make again though, because they were pretty quick and easy. Thanks!

These were fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Some others are saying the cream cheese part was too much and to double the cake portion.  I don't agree.  It's all relative to how much cream cheese portion you'd like to add, and I liked the ratio found in the recipe.  For me the recipe made 17 cupcakes that were perfectly filled, not too full or with too little.

I probably used low-fat cream cheese as that's generally what I buy, and I also used applesauce in place of the oil to try to cut some fat content (ha!).  Even so, these were on the rich side for me.  I also did not like the texture, which was thick and heavy.  I thought perhaps the applesauce sub might have done something, but I've done that a lot and it generally works well for cakes and breads (not so great for cookies).  But looking at the many pics, I see most of them have that heavy look to them, so I think they're just like that. I won't make again, and would have given them a 3 myself, but I also gave some to a co-worker who thought they were fabulous - she said she loves cream cheese (well, so do I) - and I guess she's probably more into really rich stuff.  I upped it to a 4 cause of her opinion.  I also have to add that they weren't very appetizing looking in my opinion, which I don't personally mind, but I do mind if I'm going to be giving any to someone else, and they are small if you follow the instructions.  (They also stuck to the paper liners pretty badly even with the cooking spray.)

very quick recipe and so easy that my 6 year old can make by herself. And this is why I could't have coffee into the batter. But I'll try with milk in place of water to see if it's going to improve things even more

A good cupcake.....I do not think everyone was in love with them though....but everyone did like them.....defiantely tasty. I was skeptical about the cider vinegar in the recipe...but the RE assured me that you wouldnt taste it and it helped with the rising process of the cake. I did use low fat cream cheese for the filling. I got exactly 18 cupcakes out of this with no leftover filling or batter.  Glad I tried this....they were a different yummy treat. Thanks!

Loved these cupcakes, I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference was that I left out the salt and added an extra teaspoon of Vanilla.  Had no problem at all with runny cream cheese. I finished these off with Larkspar's French cream frosting (personal recipe), works very well together.  Thank you so much for sharing @//-_-\\@

Chocolate and cream cheese = amazing! A reviewer did state that they make 18 instead of 24, but I tried to stretch it out. They were very low inside the cupcake liners. Still good, but I'll make them into 18 next time

These are amaaazing. My Only problem is with the cupcake recipe itself, is that for me the bottoms of my cupcakes  tend to get very hard and rubbery and unedible... I always find that happens with this particular recipe causing me to have to cut the bottoms off. To avoid this problem I just used a pre made chocolate cucake mix from a store and put the creamcheese choco chip mixture in the middle... yummy!

I use this exact same cream cheese filling to swirl on the top of a pan of brownie batter (I use a mix). I line the pan with foil (extending over the sides) so I can lift the baked brownies out, freeze for a 1/2 hour then they cut perfectly. Yum!

Amazing!  I actually forgot to add the chocolate chips to the cream cheese filing so i sprinkled a few on right before they went in the oven but I thought they almost tasted too chocolately with the few I sprinkled on and took away from the awesome cream cheese filling.  Next time I'll leave them out.  Also, I was really nervous about there being not egg in the batter recipe (I guess I am just used to adding egg to all of my cake recipes).  But don't worry it came out the perfect consistency. Also, for those show said the cream cheese amount is too much, I disagree.  I thought you could even use more! Just my opinion.  I'll def make these again, thanks for sharing :).

These are fabulous.  Nice not to have to frost them for them to be moist and wonderful.  I also only got 18.  But after seeing how they puff up, I could see getting 24 smaller cupcakes.

Definitely make 1.5 times the cake batter to use up the cream cheese. These were so good and easy too.

This is totally easy to make and a rich tasting.  I didn't have mini chocolate chips and made the recipe with regular ones and it still came out awesome.  The kids love making them with me.

I got this recipe from my aunt years ago and have been making them ever since. We started doubling the cupcake part and just putting a teaspoon or so of the cream cheese mix on top. It makes it go further, and it isn't as rich! These also freeze great!

I really don't want to be the "bad" person who rates something so low, but not even an entire cupcake was eaten by our family. The moisture was wonderful, but the flavor was a very very dark chocolate flavor and my family prefers a sweeter milk chocolate taste.  Then again maybe "black bottom" means dark chocolate, then if so, they are probably wonderful.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (only used milk instead of water) and got 17 cupcakes using all the cake batter and cream cheese mixture.  I had tried a similar recipe using a cake mix and I like this version better (chocolate batter from scratch).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my husband for his birthday and we LOVED them! A big part of that is because the batter reminds me of my grandmother's Crazy Cake. I cooked mine to the low end of the suggested baking time - 25 min - until a toothpick came out clean. Be sure to let them cool for at least 15 minutes before taking them out of the baking tin. Also, I'm not sure why a few other reviews mentioned there was too much filling. My "dollop" was more like 2-3T and filled the tin just a little above the halfway mark. I overfilled a few and noticed that those were far more likely to stick to the paper wrappers than the ones that I had not.

These were absolutely delicious! I just added my own little spin by adding 1/4 cup dark cocoa and substituting the chocolate chips for white chocolate chips. Hands down the best black bottom cupcake recipe I've had the pleasure of stumbling across. Thanks a bunch!

These were good but not spectacular. Cream cheese icing makes them much better!

I disagree that using the devil's food cake takes away from this, I've made them both ways and I like them better with the boxed mix. 

I was worried about the consistency of this at first because the batter was very runny, but it bakes up fine. 

If you do skip the box, I suggest extra vanilla in the mix, and it wouldn't hurt to add it to the cream cheese mixture either. 

Also, be sure to let your cream cheese sit out at room temp for an hour or so.

I can see why it says to only fill muffin cups 1/3 full. I filled mine about 1/2 full and then put a big dollop of cream cheese mixture and they're very big. Which isn't bad! But this recipe definitely could make 24 nicely sized cupcakes, rather than the 18 big ones I made. Batter seemed a bit..stiff and hard to work with so I added about 1/4 cup extra milk. made it a bit more easy to get it off the spoon and into the muffin liners. I had no problem with my cream cheese mixture being runny. Considering the batter is somewhat thick, I'm curious as to how it would turn out with a cake mix, or a regular cake batter.

These cupcakes were great!  I used Ghirardelli Cocoa power, and only baked for 20 minutes.  They came out moist and perfect!  I even drizzled a little semi-sweet baker's chocolate on top.  We definitely make again and again. :-)

Great recipe!  I didn't have vegetable oil so I subsituted sugar free applesauce for the oil and it worked perfectly.  The only difference I noticed was that they stuck to the cupcake wrapper a little bit.  But, it did save some fat and calories so that's a plus!  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture and an addtional 1/2 tsp almond extract to the cream cheese mixture as well.  I exchanged the vanilla extract for almond in the chocolate batter.  They turned out delicious!  I filled the cups about half way and topped with a heaping tablespoon of the cream cheese mix.  It made 15 cupcakes this way.

These are delicious!  I use about a tablespoon of batter on the bottom, then a tablespoon of the cheese filling, then fill the rest with more batter.  These don't rise as high as most cupcakes, so I fill them a bit more (about 3/4 as opposed to 2/3 full)  I've also added all kinds of fun things to the cheese filing (nuts, toffee chips, etc), as well as used different cake mixes.  Red Velvet is my favorite.  I am now known as the "cupcake lady" at work, and everyone requests me to make these for their birthdays.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I found these to be GREAT!  My family and my friends LOVED them.  I did not change a thing in the recipe, they were very moist, the filling was not too watery, they were just delicious!  I did get a full 24 out of mine too.  I just put the cake mix at the bottom of each one, not a lot though.  Then I filled them the rest of the way with the cream cheese mixture.  Wonderful!

For some reason, my cupcakes stuck to my liners.  Maybe I should have sprayed those first?  I also had alot more filling then I did cake batter, like other have stated.  Some have said that their filling was runny, mine was actually pretty thick.  Not sure why though.  Also, only had to be baked for 20 minutes, not 25.

I keep making these over and over again because they are so good.   I piped the creme cheese filling using a freezer bag, into the middle of the cupcake for a more even white top.  I also discovered that subbing the water for coffee makes an amazing difference.  They're much more full of flavour and a darker chocolate texture.  Also, if you make the full recipe you'll get at best 16, not 24.  They rise nicely but you probably won't get two dozen.

I make these every Christmas and this year decided to try something new.  I used Andes Mint pieces instead of chocolate chips and added 1/4 t. mint extract to the cream cheese mixture - yum! Of course, I bet you could use any of the flavored cream cheese spreads on the market instead of making the filling.  Also, after many years of making these I discovered that if you let them cool in the pan for 10 min. they are much easier to take out and less likely to fall apart.  They are much better the second day.

Fantastic!  I would definitely double the chocolate cake batter as you do have more cream cheese filling even when using a heaping dollop.  Also I used about 3/4 of T of cider vinegar.   Without doubling the chocolate batter I got 17 cupcakes.

This will get 5 stars the next time I make it with a few changes. I dont recomend using milk instead of water- I think the increased protien dries it up a bit. I would use water or coffee, hot for extra moisture. Perhaps I just over cooked them slightly too. Keep your eye on em! The flavor was great, they just turned out a bit dry. I loved the chocolate chips in them, and used lower fat Nufchetel cheese, which was great. I sprayed my paper liners and they didnt stick at all.

These were yummy and pretty easy to make!  They don't need frosting and adding a dollop of raspberry (or any!) jam on top makes it super special!  Give these a shot for sure!

warning: do not overfill your cupcakes or they will overflow and be crispy on top and mushy in the center!

otherwise they are quite tasty.

These were pretty good, though I was expecting a little more cream cheese flavor.  I don't know if I just have a different definition of "dollop" but I thought these needed way more than a dollop of the cream cheese mixture.  I was left with a lot of it and the cupcakes seemed to have hardly any of the cream cheese once they baked.  I'd make these again, but just add a huge scoop of cream cheese to each cupcake.  That was probably just my fault, not the recipes.

Absolutely delicious!  They were a bit plain for me without icing so when I make them next time I'll probably add a bit of icing on the top.  But overall these are excellent!

A fabulous cupcake! I cooked for 20 minutes as suggested by others.  I will definitely make again, but I will not add chocolate chips to cream cheese mixture.  I don't think they are needed, and will save them for another cookie recipe!

These are pretty good but not my favorite. I think the chocolate part was a bit too rich for my taste, but the cheese cream part was awesome! i made these for a bake sale, we'll see how well other people like them. Oh, yeah, I couldn't find cider vinegar at the grocery store, but they turned out fine without it.

You can't go wrong with these, they are so good!!!  I cheated and used a box of Devils Food cake mix, with pudding...and the cake turned out super moist!  I also added a tsp. of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and really whipped it until it was light and fluffy.  I followed the instructions and sprayed the paper liners with Pam, and that worked great.  Take my advice, don't over bake them...mine only needed 20 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

What I meant to say is that these cupcakes are amazing.  My roommate said it was the best cupcake he's ever had.  I followed others' tips and used milk instead of water and almost a 1/2 cup cocoa.

Probably one of the most easiest recipes to follow; directions are practically foolproof, and the estimated prep and baking time is right on.  This version rivals any bakery's in taste and texture.  I'm usually hesitant to try a new recipe to bring to a gathering, but I took my chances since it got so many positive reviews, and I'm glad I did.  They're simply delicious!

Very yummy Laura.  I substituted coffee for the water called for and used closer to 1-1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips.  Of all vinegars, cider is my least favorite so I used raspberry instead and upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 a cup.  Even with these few changes, it was still missing depth.  I think if you used buttermilk in place of the water you'd have a richer cup cake.  My whole family enjoyed these.  Thanks.

These were so~ good...everybody that tried them loved them. they were moist and not too sweet so people kept eating them. They were so easy to make. the only thing i changed was, i put the cream cheese in the middle of the cupcakes and they came out perfect.  there was also too much cream cheese so i ended up having to make more of the cupcake batter. other than that they were great.

I agree with PATTIHIGGINS, these were pretty good, but nothing fantastic. The filling is yummy, but the cake portion is pretty bland and not chocolatey enough for my family's taste.  The texture is dense but moist and the filling is a nice compliment to the chocolate and makes for a great gooey center.  These aren't as rich and sweet as you may imagine, and that is probably a good thing for some, but not for us.  I'll make it again, but use a different cake recipe.

This was a very easy recipe, and the kids loved it. My mom makes a similar recipe of a cake with this type of cream cheese mixture in the middle.  Next time I might put the cream cheese in the middle and add more chocolate cupcake mixture on top.  Mine only came to 12 big cupcakes, and I didn't need to use a liner, although I liberally greased the pan with oil.   Really good!

I've been making these cupcakes for over 20 years-I didn't know that the recipe was "out there"! These were always great stand-by's when I needed something to bake, but had no eggs...only difference is I whipped the cream cheese until fluffy and used regular vinegar,

Better than Hostess!  I love these things.  I ended up with about 21 muffins and used all but a small amount of the cream cheese mix.  Only needed to bake for about 20 minutes and they are moist and the cream is to die for!  Even my boyfriend who is not a big "sweets" fan loved these!  I will be making again.  Soon.  Very soon!! :0)

Excellent cupcakes!  The only problem I found was that I had a lot of cream cheese mixture left over, and I had used only 6 oz.  Next time I'd double the batter but stick with the 8 oz. cream cheese.  These are always popular at parties!

This is one recipe that children will enjoy as well as moms (and dads too!) for its simplicity and easy clean-up. Note that this recipe says it yields twenty-five cupcakes whereas 16 is more correct.  A glass of ice cold milk is definitely recommended.

When I made this, the cream cheese topping sunk to the bottom.  They tasted fine but stuck to the cupcake paper and didn't look that great.

These are extrememly addictive, even with reduced fat cream cheese. I dropped in the cream cheese mixture as a clump, so it sunk in a little into the middle while cooking, keeping it very gooey and making it more of a filling. This way I thought the mini-chips were most appropriate.

I've made this recipe many times and the raves I get continue for days.  I've also made just the cake base, without the cream cheese filling.  When I make the cake portion, I lightly dust it with confectioners sugar and serve it with a generous scoop of premium vanilla ice cream.  The richness of the chocolate cake and the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream result in so many requests for the recipe that I have to explain how I came up with it.  Because this cake is so moist, I've never frosted it (it diminishes the cake and the whole effect is lost!).  Give it a try!

PS: I place the cake batter in an 8" x 8" x 2" pan.  I've also doubled the recipe and made a 9" x 13" x 2" pan.

My mother used to make these and I finally made them myself for the first time tonight. The only thing I did differently was omit the 1/8 teaspoon of salt for the filling. My cupcakes were cooked in 20 minutes, and they came out looking and tasting pretty awesome.

Finally a blackbottom cupcake that turns out wonderful!!!  Be careful not to over mix the cream cheese mixture, I sort of blended it with a spatula and it came out nice and fluffy instead of separated with a previous recipe.  They look beautiful!

Delicious and easy recipe!  I added vanilla to the filling and a teaspoon instant coffee to the water.  Mine were done in 15 minutes instead of 25 minutes.  These were delicious and so moist.  Will definitely make again.

These are GREAT!   I use the tiny cupcake liners and only bake for about 8-9 minutes.  I put the batter and cream cheese mixture in pastry bags (or ziplocks with a tiny bit of the corner clipped off) to make filling those little cupcake liners easier.  I also like to put them in the fridge and eat them cold.  MMM....MMMM.  So good.

I've made this recipe twice, once as it is written and once with no salt.  The first time the cake part was really boring and heavy but the cream cheese filling still made them taste great.  The second time same thing so I tried looking for a new recipe and found out that when you live in an high altitude environment that the cake part just doesn't work.  So I made them with my regular chocolate cupcake recipe and they turned out amazing.  Yummy.  So if you've had issues with the cake part switch to your basic chocolate cupcake recipe and still use the cream cheese filling, it won't disappoint.

Delicious! After reading some of the reviews, I substituted milk for water and used probably 3 times the amount of cocoa, since I didn't find the batter chocolaty enough. However, I didn't get as many out of them, don't know what I did wrong. 
Btw, they also freeze well - if nobody eats them first!

Yum! I just have two suggestions. I ended up making a double batch of the chocolate cake part because unless you want to make 24 teensy cupcakes, that's what you'll have to do. It's also a good idea to let the dallop of cream cheese mixture settle for about 10 min before popping the cupcakes into the oven...this way, the cream cheese has time to sink into the center, making the final product look prettier.

Yum! Came out perfectly and cake is tasty as well as cream cheese. I yielded 21 cupcakes. I let them cool a bit and put them in the fridge and they are fabulous! I made two modifications for what I had on hand: regular white vinegar and milk chocolate chips, about half a bag. I will make again, probably sooner than later.

The wife of a guy at work makes cupcakes like this and they are so good that he uses them to bribe employees.  It works! :)  While I was on mat leave I decided to look for a recipe and make my own.  They turned out so amazing.  Even my non-sweet loving partner is completely addicted and begs me to make them regularly.
Notes - I upped the cocoa as suggested.  I find that the cake mix makes exactly 12 good size cupcakes and the cream cheese filling will do 24 so I always double the cake mix.  If you are having an issue getting the cream cheese to 'sink' try adding a bit more water to the batter to make it just a bit runnier.  I had to do this because of the extra cocoa.    I top these with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and they are incredibly decadent.  Oh, and I always skip the chocolate chips.  I like my cupcakes soft. :)

This recipe makes the perfect Black Bottom cupcakes, as long as you observe one very important alteration.  The amount of cocoa powder that the recipe calls for makes very mild, not very chocolatey, tan-bottomed cupcakes.  I upped the cocoa to 3/4 of a cup and they are right on the money.  With that minor change in place, look no further for the cupcakes of your dreams.

Here are the problems I had with the recipe: The cupcakes sink a lot. The recipe does not yield anywhere near what it says. The muffin tins should probably be filled at least half way (I had quite a few that were sunk about 1/4 inch bellow the paper). It's not a good recipe for birthday cupcakes. They were okay at best as far as taste but some of them stuck to the paper and some of them didn't- not sure what the difference was. I followed the recipe exactly plus I read the reviews and heeded the advice. They were okay but not anything special. I had extra cream cheese mixture left over so maybe I didn't put enough filling in the cupcakes but I put about a tablespoon in each which seemed to be a lot.

If I was going to remake them I would have doubled the recipe- I got about 29 cupcakes making 1 1/2 times the recipe but like I said some of the cupcakes were small so I think this recipe yields more like 18 cupcakes or fewer.

I thought these cupcakes were great! Although, I followed the recipe exactly, it probably would have been better if I had only made 18 cupcakes instead of 24 because they do not rise very much. They were still great cupcakes, nonetheless. Especially with the vanilla I got from Mexico- the perfect addition.

I made these for my daughter's first birthday party and everyone raved about them. One guest asked me to make them again for a party she's hosting next week. I added a chocolate frosting and sprinkles, which was a bit over the top but really yummy.

Super easy to make! I left the cream cheese mixture in the fridge for an hour or so and used a small scooper to put into each cupcake. I used half coffee half water and they came out super chocolatey and not as 'mocha-y' which I prefer.  Yum!!

I found the filling (after cooking) to be tasty but not as noticeably cream-cheesy as I was expecting. I'm not sure how to improve that because most of mine had about as much filling as was going to be reasonably possible without risking making a nasty mess. Could play around with it to up the cheese factor though, I think flour or cornstarch in the filling (along with the egg) might make it so you could use a 2 TB cheese 1 TB cupcake batter (instead of the other ratio, 1 TB cheese 2 TB batter). Thank you for sharing, these are certainly tasty and cute :)

Made this for my girlfriend because her mom would make this when she was little. It was no exactly how her mom made it but she loved it. The first batch was too crunchy but I fixed it by leaving it less time. She loved it and my kids too. Loved that it wasn't too sweet.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the mini chips! I used regular because that is what I had on hand.  I did add a little instant expresso for the enhancement ofthe chocolate and they were wonderful!  The only made 16 and I did have filling left over.

If you find the filling too runny you may want to omit the egg.  I've made this recipe for years at a local coffee shop and never added an egg to the filling.  These are one of my customers favorites.

EXCELLENT! The dollop of cream cheese mixture wasn't enough, I had half the bowl left. So I just piled it on and they turned out awesome! They are even better refrigerated and eaten cold. Almost like fudge. :)

I'm an occasional baker... pretty sloppy and frantic when I do. But this was a fairly easy recipe. I like that it's a little different from norm. My mom, however, did not like that the chocolate cupcake part was not as fluffy and bouncy like normal cupcakes. I'm also not a big fan of cream cheese, but it was mainly for my coworks. The sugar, chocolate chips, and egg addition to the cream cheese made it standable, but not really delicious. Two of my coworkers loved it, and one thought it was ok. I think it gets a little fudgey tasting and weird moisture wise after awhile. In the main picture, the cream cheese filling looks melty, but it actually puffed up with mine... Maybe I missed something. Pretty good though.

These were great - moist and rich. Maybe they were a tad too rich (in terms of amount of chocolate chips in the cream cheese batter). After I ate two cupcakes, I was buzzing with so much  energy and guilt that I went for a 4-mile run IN THE RAIN! Anyways, the next time I make these cupcakes, I'll reduce the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup. My 5-year-old son loves them though. He looked at me gratefully and said, "Thank you mommy. They are so super yummy."

Absolutely love these cupcakes!!  I doubled the batter and not the filling and the amounts were perfect.  Like the fact that they don't need frosting, very easy to transport.

Didn't come out as I had hope, maybe I missed a step in the process but the cream cheese didn't ooze out, it hardened like the cake. But I didn't mix it in with the batter.

I followed the directions exactly and I'm not a fan. Its a regular chocolate cupcake. What did make it better was adding a little strawberry preserves. Will not make this again

I thought that theses cupcakes would be amazing, they had so many good reviews. The taste of the vinegar was so strong that was all that I could take even when I got to the filling part. I would never have even put the vinegar in, I am not even sure what the vinegar was for.

I kind of wish there was 4.5 stars.  I think this recipe is very good, but the chocolate is just a TAD dry, I think maybe adding a few egg whites folded in would moisten it up a bit, so it is a little more like souffle.  I will try this next time.  The cream cheese mixture is very good and offsets the dryness of the chocolate cake part.  I will make more cream cheese for the top next time as well and do more like 1/2 and 1/2.

This is incredible. The recipe was easy to follow and did not take much time at all. I did not put the chips into the filling, but sprinkled them on top before baking.  I also put the cream cheese filling into a pastry bag and piped it onto the center of the cupcake to make things go a little quicker and it seemed to make less of a mess.

i have these in the oven as i'm typing this so i will update/revise my review afterwards.  here are the subs/revisions that i made> light cream cheese (that's what i had on hand) rather than regular cream cheese, i didn't have a full cup of mini choc chips so i supplemented with a handful of regular size choc chips, rather than 1 cup water i used 1/2 cup coffee and 1/2 cup water, and lastly i didn't have cider vinegar so i used white wine vinegar. fingers crossed that they turn out!  so far so good...  UPDATE:  when making the filling i was a little worried because it was a little thin (the recipe says until "light and fluffy" and mine was anything but!). i'm not sure if this is because i had my cream cheese at room temp or if it was because i used light cream cheese?  regardless, they turned out perfect!  the filling settled right in the middle of the cupcake.  i had never had black bottom cupcakes before but they sounded delicious so i thought i'd try.  to be honest they are very good, but so are plain cupcakes. i think i might try adding something to the filling to make it more flavorful (jam?).  i would give this 4 1/2 stars if i could.

Awesome cupcakes. I didn't have any cider vinegar so instead used a 1.5 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar which was great. I did not use salt in the cream cheese mixture, it didn't need it. I used about 2 teaspoons of vanilla rather than one.  I never know which cocoa to use because they all taste different.  I used Nestle cocoa and it worked perfectly. Thank you for the wonderful dessert item.

The recipe worked perfectly.  I doubled all of the "cake" ingredients and was able to make exactly 30 cupcakes.  I put 1/4 cup cake batter on the bottom, 1 tbsp cream cheese mixture in the middle, 1/4 cup cake batter on top in each cupcake.  My mom used to make these for us to take to school on our birthdays and this recipe turned out just like I remember!  Yum!

Took these to a 50th birthday party for a friend. They were a big hit to say the least! I made about 48 of them and followed the review about adding some jam to the filling. Oh, that is t he kicker! I used strawberry this time but will try raspberry next time. I will go along with other about doubling the chocolate cake part. There will be plenty of the cream cheese filling for more that a double batch of chocolate bottoms!

I thought they were good when they first cooled, but I just had another one (after a few hours) and, YUM it was even better! I didn't change anything, except used regular vinegar b/c that's what I had. This made exactly 24 cupcakes and I didn't really have any cream cheese filling left over. I did bake them only 20 minutes and they were perfectly moist.

I made these per the recipe the first time and they were just ok.  This time, I increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup.  I made 24 of them (the amount of cheesecake filling was perfect) and cooked them for 19 minutes.   I think overcooking was part of my problem last time.  I used regular vinegar instead of apple cider and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the filling.  They were FABULOUS!  Moist and delicious.  They definitely make a low cupcake - and the filling sunk a little after they came out, but it my book it isn't how it looks; its how it tastes.  These were exactly what I wanted.

I'd call it 'cupcakes for the grown ups'.  Our kids love it also but the grown ups were having 2nds and 3rds. It was small enough that we didn't feel like we were indulging too much yet it was very satisfying.  I would definitely make more cream cheese mixture next time. I apparently didn't put enough mixture or put it too early so that it looked like a plain chocolate cupcake. It was delicious regardless of how it looked.  It was also great warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds the next day.  Definitely a 5-star recipe!! Thank you for sharing!

delicious! i think i didn't use enough cream cheese topping on all the cupcakes (my dollops are apparently too small), so that's something i would fix next time, but...there will definitely be a next time! really yummy, friends loved them.

Thanks to the other reviewers for their tips.  I omitted the salt, used white vinegar & baked for 20 min.  A dusting of powdered sugar was a pretty finishing touch.  Great to make when you need to use up a brick of cream cheese!  Easy & tasty!

I love cream cheese and chocolate. It's a match made in heaven! Everyone loves this and it tastes so nice when it's chilled as well. Only thing I noticed is how the cream cheese filling doesn't seem to be enough. I also once slightly overbaked this and it turned very dry on the sides so remember not to overbake.

I made this for my husbands 34th birthday and he LOVED them!  I only was able to get 15 cupcakes out of the batter however.  Next time I will be making twice the cream cheese filling and spread some ontop as an icing..YUM!

Good dessert, not my fav but very good.  Not sure how people are getting so much extra filling or aren't getting 24 cupcakes.  Only fill the cupcake 1/3 full and put a big dollop of cream cheese mixture on top.  It comes out to a perfect mix.  Waiting to see my friends reactions now...

These are awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and I got a ton of compliments on them.  There is extra cream cheese mixture, but I just made a cupcake with it. :)  The mixture isn't runny like some people said it was... I don't know what they were doing.  I only got 18 cupcakes following the recipe.

My husband really loved these.  He did his little dancing to invisible music happy thing while he ate them.  I made it according to recipe, but took the suggestion of adding a smidge of vanilla to the cream cheese for flavor.  This meant piling on way more cream cheese onto each muffin than I expected, but it turned out well.  Recommend cooling them thoroughly before taking out of the pan.  Mine were done in 20 mins.

These cupcakes were so delicious, I actually laughed out loud when I ate one. If you are on a special diet and can have only one cupcake a year, make it this one. Seriously.  The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar in the cupcake part. I wouldn't even consider using a box cake mix for this recipe because I think it would be too sweet and take away from the cheesecake flavor. Cannot recommend these enough.

I'll have to make 1.5x batter like others have suggested. Stuck to the pan - so cupcake liners would be ideal in this recipe.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.

This was a Pillsbury Bake-off recipe many years ago.  The original recipe called for chopped nuts (I use walnuts) sprinkled over the top, with a sprinkling of sugar overall.  They taste even better after being frozen and keep very well.

These were delicious but it's really hard for a chocolate cupcake to taste bad unless you under or over cook.  The cream cheese texture was light and fluffy in my cupcake. I was expecting gooey filling as one of the reviewers has mentioned. It's not gooey. It's fluffy! I thought about making a cream cheese frosting for these cupcakes but didn't because it might have been overwhelming with the cream cheese already inside the cupcake. I was wrong, these cupcakes could have used some frosting. Some of my mini chocolate chips did sink to the bottom.

I felt like these cupcakes were not anything special. It only made 17 cupcakes and there was way too much cream cheese mixture leftover. The chocolate mixture resembled a brownie texture and I was looking for something a little lighter. The cream cheese part was delicious.

Truthfully I never read the reviews of this recipe before trying it, I went solely by the picture and thought they looked very tasty.  The cupcakes were nice and moist and I really enjoyed the cream cheese filling but the dark chocolate taste of the cupcakes was not something we enjoyed.  As another reviewer said we prefer a milk chocolate taste to our cupcakes.  I don't think we will be making them again.

Best cupcakes I ever made.  No reason to ever buy another boxed cake mix again.  Make according to instructions and you will have the perfect cupcake.  Only took 20 minutes in my oven.  After cooling I put in the fridge.  Better the next day.  Don't leave ANYTHING out.

It's a winner! Everyone loved these cupcakes. I followed the ingredients and instructions as given except I only made 21 and used the remaining batter to cover the cream cheese mixture so that I could frost them and decorate with Fourth of July sprinkles.  They only needed 20 minutes to bake. This recipe is much better than one I tried previously with a cake mix. They taste best chilled.  Don't leave out the vinegar, you need it and you won't taste it. You will be glad you tried this recipe. Perfect and easy.

Awesome tidbits to serve to friends with coffee. I make these every month or so and everyone raves over them.

These are delicious!  Pretty easy, too. I really like that you don't need to ice them. Followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed - they're perfect!

These worked out great for me. I used coffee instead of water. Cream cheese sinked nicely to the middle. I added jam on top of cream cheese as someone suggested but I did not care for it. It was just too sweet and did not add any flavor. (I am glad I only tried it with couple of them) Next time I am going to omit chocolate chips, no need for them. These would be also great without cream cheese, just to use chocolate chips in the dough. Great recipe, awesome flavors and nice texture. Thanks

These were great when freshly made, but I thought the chocolate mix lost its moisture after a couple of days.  Either half the cream cheese filling, or double the chocolate mix.

I used the paper baking cups and all of the cupcakes were stuck to the paper. My husband still ate them out of the paper but I was very disappointed since I had made these to bring to Easter dinner. Cheesecake filling is very good but next time I'll try using regular cake mix.

I thought these were pretty good, not great.  The filling is delicious.  The cake, itself, has a nice flavor, but it's nothing outstanding.  I was only able to get 16 cupcakes, and for me, the baking time was more around 15-18 minutes.

These were just o.k. to me. The chocolate cake part was great (I substituted the water with very weak coffee). The cheesecake part was kind of bland, not sweet at all. If I made this again I would add milk chocolate chips next time.

Followed recipe and they were excellent! I made a chocolate ganache to top it (1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips). I also put the cupcakes in the fridge and everything just tasted so great!!

I really liked the recipe by itself but decided to make a couple changes. To make the cake batter more fluffy and light, I sifted my flour. To the cream cheese mixture, I increased the sugar to 1/2 c, added 3 Tablespoons of Malibu coconut rum, and 1/2 a cup of finely chopped sweetend coconut. I followed the baking instructions, but with 10 minutes left, I added a pinch of shredded coconut to the top to toast it and give it a crunch. I brought them to the elementary school where I work and they were a huge hit!

This is a great classic recipe my Mom made us as we were growing up.  Not sure if anyone else mentioned this, but she added food coloring to the cream cheese mixture to match the upcoming holiday, like green for St. Patrick's Day or she would do 3 batches with red, white and blue for 4th of July.  These are always a hit.

My mom made cupcakes like these for my 6th birthday party because they were my favorite but I don't remember having them ever since.  When I accidently stumbled on this recipe, I had to try it and send it to my mom too.  Hi Mom!  These came out really really good!  I am surprised that it wasn't much harder than making cake out of the box really and I had everything on hand.  I did notice like others that I ran out of black bottom before I had 24, in fact alot sooner and was left with more cream cheese mixture so I ended up making 1/2 of the cake mixture more and ended up with 24 then.  Maybe it's because mine have "muffin tops" that I needed more mixture.  Also I only baked mine for 20 minutes and this was perfect.  I would definitely suggest checking yours also at 20 minutes, just make sure you don't mistake the melted chocolate chips as being wet cake batter.  I did this and had left it in longer on a second batch.

This was good. I wasn't sure what to expect because I haven't had them before. I didn't add as much of cream cheese mixture as the photo shows and they came out like a cream filled cupcake. I took the advice of a reviewer saying not to over mix, leave cream cheese out etc. but was definitely a good recipe.

This is a great recipe. My daughter and I had a good time making them. I let her frost them, but next time I make them I will leave the frosting off and use more of the cheesecake mixture. I can tell that the cupcake is a keeper even though I didn't think to try one before my daughter put the frosting and mini chips on top. It make's it way, way too rich.

OK, I cheated and used a devil's food box mixed and they were still terrific.  I was intentionally a bit heavy handed when adding the cream cheese mixture and only made 18 black bottom ones and then 6 more regular devil's food cupcakes.  These are the perfect little snack cake, rich and not messy like a frosted cake.  Also, they get better the next day.

These were so so good.I could not change anything with them they were so good.But I am going to try to made them with more of the cream cheese filling,I think it might make them taste better.Also I think if you put them in a tupperware container and eat them the next day is better,they are more moist.

Made this exactly how recipe said and they turned out great. However, next time, I'm going to follow the advice of someone else and fill half way with chocolate, then dollop of cream cheese and more chocolate on top. Then the cream cheese doesn't dry out at all on top and it's kind of a surprise in the middle. Very tasty!

DELICIOUS! I made these as mini cupcakes, with a layer of cream cheese filling between two layers of cake batter.  Do NOT skimp on the filling, even if it looks like it'll be too much.  And if you're pressed for time, for a new twist, use brownie mix instead of devil's food... YUMMMM.

My husband and son really enjoyed this. I think the cream cheese filling is very good, but the chocolate cupcake part is rather bland. I think chocolate should have more of a kick. I didn't increase the cocoa or use coffee instead of water, like other reviewers did; those steps could have helped. The proportions also seemed out of whack to me; this recipe made 12 cupcakes, not 24. The cupcakes were soft and moist, and do taste better the next day, heated up in the microwave. If I make these again, I would drag a knife through the filling before baking, to have a nice swirly effect. The filling didn't sink much.

This is a good recipe. I halved the ingredients, and made 12. I didn't have any problems with the filling (I was afraid of a possible overflow but everything went ok). I did think the chocolate chips amount (1/2 cup) was too much, and also, weird thing, although I am a HUGE fan of cheesecake, I wasn't amazed by the cream cheese filling. All in all, a good dessert, but definately not my favourite cupcakes...

I'm trying to figure out why people like these so much.  Mine were ugly and sticky.  I would actually have preferred to use a cake mix with these.  Will not make again.

Great recipe!  At first I was worried because I thought the cupcake mix was too runny but it turns out that's the way it's suppose to be.  My modifications:  Let cream cheese sit out to soften before mixing instead of microwaving it.  Other than that I sticked to the recipe.  On a side note it didn't make 24 cupcakes well at least regular sized ones

These cupcakes are so yummy and easy to make!  I was wary of the proportion of batter to filling because of other reviews, but they must've overfilled with their chocolate because I had the perfect amount of both! I filled 1/3 full with choco and topped with a heaping spoonfull of the creamcheese, the cupcakes rose to the brim perfectly! Made 24 exactly.

Easy and delicious! I used mini m&m's (1 cup instead of 2) in the cream cheese layer and it made some really fun swirly colors. The cream cheese layer is rich enough to skip the frosting, which adds to their portability and ease.

This recipe along with the updates suggested by couple other users works perfect. I got 24 cupcakes too. Put generous portions of the cream cheese filling. It makes a big difference. Enjoy!!

These were so good and so easy!  I will definitely make these again.  Mine looked a bit messy since they overflowed (I made 12 instaed of 18) but no one minded because they were so delicious!

I'm going to give this 5 stars because it made really great cupcakes - the only thing I changed was adding to 2.5 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the recommended amount and I think as one reviewer suggested, that was a good idea. The only thing I didn't care for was that the white creamcheese part wasn't sweet enough and reminded me too much of cheesecake which I guess is great if you like cheesecake but I don't. Maybe if there was more sugar in the filling part perhaps that would make it less cheesecake like. I don't know but again this was just a personal preference that's why I didn't let it affect my rating. They tasted great and everyone loved them. I myself ate like 4 of them. It's a great recipe.

I helped my 14 yr old son make these, so we followed the directions exactly and they turned out great!  Oh, we did use milk-chocolate caramel chips instead of mini chips.  We had 21 cupcakes but some were small so next time I think 18 will be what we shoot for.  The texture of the cake and filling were just what I'd expect, no problems.

Great recipe, thanks very much!

This is really good, but the filling seemed to cook slower than the cake part. I used fewer chocolate chips in the filling.

These cupcakes turned out SO moist! I added 1/4 cup mayo to the batter as another reviewer suggested and lessened the oil to 1/4 cup. They were eaten up in NO time at all! I personally thought that the cream cheese filling was a little lacking in flavor, but you can always tweak it to your liking. This is definitely a great base recipe to build upon.

Ok, it may just be me but these were awful. I followed the recipe exactly and it wasnt sweet enough or moist enough. My 3 year old actually spit it out. I've never claimed to be a baker, so I might have done something wrong....

this recipe was really easy to make- but i thought the chocolate could be better so i made some adjustments. for a richer chocolate taste use 1 cup of coffee instead of water (i added it to the bowl while it was still hot), also i used 2 teaspoons of vanilla. and if you just want really good chocolate cupcakes, only make the chocolate batter and bake at 350 for about 15 minutes! it makes a really great vegan cupcake if you know someone who needs one!

i love the black bottom cupcakes.
i love how the saltiness and the sweetness were combined.
this was actually my first baking recipe and it turned out really good.
i also tried the cupcake recipe (without the creamcheese topping) and it turned out really great all the time. I fill in the muffin pan full, then cooke them for 15 minutes. then instead of cream cheese, i used the white mountain frosting or marshmallow frosting. everybody who tasted it loved it. the not-too-sweet cupcake matched perfectly with the just-right sweetness of the frosting. it's great!

These cupcakes were very good, especially if you want something chocolate, but don't want to bother with frosting.  Or maybe you can't decide between cake and cheesecake?  Perfect compromise!  Being that these are individual cupcakes and don't have frosting they make a great take-along for a party or get together - less mess.  I ended up with lots of cream cheese filling left over, so I made another batch of cake batter and ended up with 26 standard size cupcakes with some of them running over the edges onto the pan a little, so in hindsight I could have had closer to 30 cupcakes.  I made one batch of cake batter with regular cocoa powder and one with dutch process, either works fine, I liked the dutch process a little better, the chocolate flavor was a little deeper.  Also, I refrigerated the cupcakes overnight and think they were better the next day.  

*As a note, I wasn't sure how much filling to add to each cupcake, but since the recipe makes so much filling, feel free to be generous with it.

These were really good! I made them exactly as the recipe stated with no changes. I had exactly enough for 24 cupcakes, both with the chocolate portion and the cream cheese topping. My oven is really hot though so it only took 15 minutes for the cupcakes to bake. I left some without icing and used vanilla icing on others. I think the icing makes them a tad too rich but still yummy. I'll definitely make these again!

I used a short cut and made the cupcake part from a devil's food cake mix (but made w/ 4 eggs, 1 cup sour milk, and 1/4 cup oil...I always do this w/ boxed cake mix). I used powder sugar instead of white (what I had on hand). This made 18 regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins and I had plenty of cream cheese to go on all of these. Everyone enjoyed these!

Everyone raves about this one! I did substitute expresso for the water and used dark chocolate cocoa powder to make them extra dark and rich.  Also split the chocolate chips between the batter and cream cheese mixture. I topped these with a cream cheese frosting and they were excellent!! I've made them every week for 4 weeks now!

Great flavor, but the presentation lacked a little something.  Maybe I used too much filling for each cupcake, but I found that the chocolate batter didn't rise up around it as much as it should have.  The white "filling" sat more like a topping on the cupcakes and made them look less appetizing.  But they tasted very good.  I refrigerated them because of the cream cheese, but found when I took them out that they were pretty hard.  I recommend letting them come to room temp before serving.

Listen to the recipe when it says to only fill 1/3 of the way - this will get you almost 24 cupcakes. They really do rise enough to be full-sized. I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only change was that I used regular distilled vinegar because I didn't have the cider vinegar on hand. But these are really yummy!! No icing necessary!

I love this recipe! Made a few changes the last time I made it. Used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix and white morsel chips. The result was excellent! Also, I used a (sprayed)mini-muffin tin with no paper cups. They came right out of the tin, were bite size, and the hit of the picnic.

I actually loved this recipe, but I made a small change.  I used half of the regular chocolate, but I had some left over Williams-sonoma peppermint chocolate thats used for hot chocolate so I used the other half of the chocolate ingredient with that and it was absolutely delicious!  I handed them out to my dad & sister (my husband doesnt like chocolate) and they oved them.

I was nervous at first because the batter was so watery and it only made 1 dozen cupcakes opposed to the 2 dozen that the recipe states.  However these cupcakes were delicious!  I will make them again and again!

What an ordeal!  The first time that I made these I started out with 6, and didn't care for the taste of the cake.  So i decided to re-make them with a box cake mix thinking they would taste better this time.  Unfortunately, instead of mixing up a cake mix I mixed up a brownie mix.  Oops!  So, on the third try everything finally went well but they just weren't as good as I had expected.  My friend once made something like these that were delicious and I've been searching for the recipe ever since, but I still haven't found it & it certainly isn't this.  I've come to the  conclusion that this recipe is cursed!!  BEWARE!!

In my household, these were probably the best cupcakes we've had.  I used my new silicone muffin pan and just wiped some butter crisco around the holes (no liners needed).  They came out easily and so moist.  I made one change to the recipe however...instead of vanilla extract I used almond extract.  WOW!!!  These will be a staple in our house.

Mine stuck to the paper cups so badly it was really hard to eat them! But we did anyway, because they were very good... Next time, I'll pour more cheesecake mixture on the cocoa batter because it's definitely the best part!

These weren't worth the effort, in my opinion.  The edges tasted oddly gummy.  And I guess I should have sprayed the cupcake liners, because the cupcake stuck and I only had the inside of the cupcake left.  Very disappointed.

Very good! We really enjoyed this recipe. I don't like messing with making cupcakes so I made this as a cake instead. I spread the cream cheese over the cake mix and baked. It tasted more like a cream cheese brownie. I loved it. The ONLY reason I did'nt give this 5 stars was because of the cider vinegar. I did'nt like the "bite" it gave the cake. But it wasn't bad enough for me not to enjoy the cake. Next time I'll just leave out the vinegar. Thanks for the great recipe!

This batter baked perfectly and wasn't too runny at all. I baked one batch with Pam spray and they came out of the cupcake sheet very nicely. However, when I baked the first batch for 25 minutes they were slightly dry on the sides. I baked the second batch for a few minutes less and the  texture was fine. For my personal tastes, I would probably use different chocolate chips or omit them all together. They were gooey, but they didn't have enough cream cheese flavor for me. I tasted mostly the chocolate chips, but that's just me. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out really well for the first day of nibbling on them. However, after then they became a tad too dry. Not sure if I was supposed to refrigerate them as I did, but would not reccommend making this recipe unless you are going to gobble them all up the first day. Also my batter turned out to not be enough and my cakes were very flat and small. Reccommend doubling the recipe. May try making again sometime.

These were only Okay. I think it was a bad idea to use the vinegar, it made them smell wierd and taste funny. The cream cheese topping was really good-without that they would be horrible. I would suggest not using the vinegar and putting more of the cream cheese topping.

I followed this recipe exactly except that i forgot to add vanilla extract.  They still came out dee-licious!  I'm in agreement with the other reviews; they taste even better the next day!  And they're so cute because they're very little :D

These were ok. Nothing great that I can't live without. I think just a chocolate cupcake with frosting would be better. I LOVE cheesecake but didn't like the cream cheese with this. It was too much trouble for not enough taste

I accidentally found this recipe and I'm so glad I did.  I don't think they need icing, they are sweet and moist enough as is.  I greased and floured the muffin tins first and had no problems getting them out.  Really, really good.

I love these!!! I make these in the mini muffin tins. I think these taste the best the next day as the flavors meld together. I usually make them the night before I take them somewhere. Definitely one of my favorite deserts!

I used Devils food cake mix rather than making the mix myself, and followed instructions for the creme cheese part. Hearing all the comments about it sticking, I made sure to spray the tin well.

When they came out, they came out easily.  However it didn't taste that great.  Just tasted like plain Devils  Food Cake.  The creme cheese part had all sunk to the bottom, and didn't really have a taste to it.  

I'll pass on this one.  After seeing all the hype, I was hoping these would be a great addition to the brunch I'm hosting tomorrow afternoon.  Some have sugessted it tastes better the next day- really hope it does :)

I have to agree with people who have posted before... the taste was great but the cupcakes didn't come out as I expected. They were at first very gooey and impossible to take them out from the tins and afterwards, the cheese turned hard... i dunno if that is supposed to happen. Maybe I did something wrong, but it really didn't work for me. Thnx anyways =)

Just finished baking them. And as soon at the first batch cooled down, 6 were devoured by the kids. The cakes were a little bit on the smaller side to be able to get 2 dozen. Next time I'll make them bigger and put in more cheese. Also used milk instead of water and 1/3 cup of cocoa at 20 min.

Added this icing:  In sauce pan, stirring over low heat,  melt 2 oz unsweetened chocolate, 2 ozs cream cheese, 1/3 cup butter, and 1/3 cup of milk.  Remove from heat and beat in 4 cups confectioners sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. (Frosts best if cupcake is slightly below top of cupcake paper).

REALLY good.  Made this for a BBQ and they were so good.  I made a double batch...which yielded about 16 regular sized and 24 minis.  The minis I cooked about 15mins.  I also used low fat cream cheese for the filling and they turned out just as great.  The filling is so creamy and delicious.  Mmmmmm, love this recipe.

These cupcakes turned out fabulous!! The cream cheese filling goes so well with the chocolate, the only change to the recipe I would recommend would be to make 50% more of the cream cheese filling that stated. For the chocolate chips I used half milk chocolate and the other half semi-sweet. Again, a wonderful recipe :D

I made these for Valentine's Day this past spring (yes, I am late at reviewing!)  They were delicious.  You really can't go wrong with chocolate + cream cheese, and these reminded me of those good cream cheese swirled brownies or maybe a chocolate cheesecake, only easier and less messy to serve.

These cupcakes taste great.  However, like other reviewers mine took only 20 min to cook and the recipe only made 21 cupcakes.  Also, some of the cream cheese sunk to the bottom (on all but one) and there was no way to gracefully remove the cupcake from the pan without leaving some of the cream cheese behind.  I recommend using muffin tin liners as this would have allowed the cupcakes to be removed intact.

I've been making these for years from a recipe that is almost identical.  They are a hit everywhere I bring them.  I have never had the problem with the cream cheese or the chips sinking to the bottom.  I would suggest beating the cream cheese mixture longer in order to make it lighter.

Tasty though I think some children would turn their noses up at the cream cheese centers (mine did).  That's ok, more for us adults.

I made these for my daughter's BD party, and the kids liked them, but I didn't think they were anything special. The cream cheese mixture was a little weird and the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom and stuck, even though I greased the muffin pan really well. I was going to give it like 2 stars, but since the kids ate them up, I gave it 3. I don't think I would make this again though.

Mmm... these are very rich & delicious.  I find it's better to either double the chocolate mixture or halve the cream cheese mixture-- these work best with just a dab of cream cheese.

I made these for my kids and they liked them, but I used a boxed cake mix. The cream cheese mixture sunk to the bottom and they were kind of gooey, but of course the kids like them that way. I think I will try something different next time.

I really enjoyed the taste of these cupcakes.  I didnt quite like the chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture.  All the chips went to the bottom of the cupcake and they got stuck so I ended up with bottomless cupcakes.  If it were not for the chocolate chips, I'd rate this recipe *****.

This is my second time trying to make these. My aunt used to make them all the time and they were delicious. Now when I make them I follow this recipe to the T and they look awful. The cream cheese mixture is runny with a like chunk curds of cream cheese. This happened both times I’ve tried this recipe. Any tips would be appreciated. I live in high altitudes and that is all I can think of why mine never turn out.

These cupcakes were very popular with the extended family. I like the idea that you can freeze them. My wife and I can  pull them out of the freezer when needed as well.

These cupcakes are amazing! I put a little of the cake batter on top of the cream cheese filling, so the filling is more in the middle. Otherwise I don’t mess with perfection. They’re so good they don’t need frosting.

It’s been YEARS since I had a black bottom cupcake and I had a craving and was surprised to discover the internet doesn’t have too many recipes for them. Decided to give this recipe a shot. Made my first batch as written and giving them three stars. Second batch I used coffee instead of water, added espresso powder, a whole tablespoon of vanilla, used dark cocoa, doubled the salt in both the batter and filling (salt adds flavor to baked goods, not saltiness, it DOES matter and you CAN taste a difference, contrary to other reviews), and nearly doubled the chocolate chips. Baked in mini muffin tins for 12 minutes. Spray the cupcake liners if you want to make sure these won’t stick. 1/3 full was not enough for mini cupcakes. Fill halfway with batter and add a heaping  teaspoon of filling. Next time I’d add a little dollop of raspberry jam before adding cream cheese filling to make them more like the ones from my childhood. I think these are much better cold from the refrigerator the day after they are baked.

I have made this cupcakes for 45 years. A friend made them and brought them into work. She gave me recipe. My husband loved them. I love them too, they are pretty low in carbs. So if you are counting carbs they work well  and fit into your low carb diet. It you love dark chocolate you will love them too. They freeze well.  Enjoy!!!  CFC

These are beyond fantastic, Cupcake heaven! And I don't even like cake. I'm a pie person to be honest. The first time I made these, they were a gift for my boyfriend. We had only been dating for about three weeks at that time. I don't remember how many I made but they filled a gallon size zip-loc bag full. I gave them to my honey in the morning and they were gone by bed time. These did the trick!! I'm making them today and giving them to my honey in celebration of our 11th anniversary.  I have made them several times, like when I want something, made a mistake, or just want to see him smile. They work every time. I have never changed a thing in this recipe. Make as directed and you will see.

I used to make this recipe when it was in the Best of Bridge cookbooks....remember those?  It’s fabulous. Works every time.  But I always have the same complaint.....I have to make more of the chocolate than the recipe calls for (1/2 again) because there is no way Im getting 24 cupcakes from this recipe.  I like them decent sized...rising to above the paper.

The cream cheese filling was great but the vinegar made the cupcakes taste strange. Also, there was so much cream cheese     
filling after the batter was gone. I will look for another recipe next time I make these.

The second time I made these, I cut back on the oil in the batter and doubled the amount of cream cheese to make a thicker blend. The richer cream cheese filling totally made these amazing.

This recipe is wrong! Don't make the same mistake I did. This recipe uses the original ratios for the filling but halves the ratios for the cake batter so you end up with twice as much filling as you need. The cream cheese filling runs all over the top instead of setting up in the middle. They were not right at all. Do yourself a favor and use the Hershey's website recipe from the '70's when they were called "Filled Rich Chocolate Cupcakes". Hope this helps!

I had to make the cream cheese mixture twice when I did it like the directions say my filling wasn’t fluffy. I still used the first batch and they taste great but when I did the second filling I did it a little different and got it fluffy. I’ve never been much of a baker but my mom wanted me to make these for her. No one in our family has made them since my grandmother I’m so glad they turned out just right. Overall very easy to make!

My Grammy used to make these years ago and the recipe was gone when she passed... Tried several other variations until I found this one, and it's spot on! Wouldn't change a thing, except to experiment and try to make it gluten free for my boyfriend who has Celiac disease.

I doubled the recipe because I couldn't see anywhere on the recipe how many cupcakes it made. Doubling the recipe made exactly 36 normal size cupcakes. They turned out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly. I would suggest not using your largest sized eggs. I chose the 2 smallest in the carton of large eggs.  Baked 21 minutes.

These were very yummy.  I changed the 1 cup water to 1/2 cup coffee, 1/2 cup water.  I also used a lot less chocolate chips.

Omg my family loooved these. I’m more of a cook and not a baker but these were easy and came out so springy and moist. I did use paper liners. The chocolate chips were still crunchy and the cream cheese batter keeps the chocolate from being too overpowering.  Saving this one!

When the chocolate cake is married to the cream cheese top, it is to die for. However, the cake alone is too dense and pretty tasteless. I doubled my recipe because I was bringing the cupcakes to a party and I wanted to make sure I had some at home.The cupcakes were a success at the party. 

I made the chocolate cake from scratch instead of using store bought cake mix. I want to experiment with the chocolate cake mix to try and give it some more flavor and make it lighter instead of dense. 

Any ideas I should try?

I made this this weekend and they turned out great! I didn't check the serving size and made 12 huge cupcakes instead of 24 smaller ones, but they still cooked well. I'll definitely make these again

A delicious and pretty addition to a cookie tray but baker beware!  Some experimenting is necessary when baking.  Overfilling the baking cup even the slightest bit will cause the dark cake batter to bake too high--out of the liner. I used mini cupcake liners and put 1/2 Tablespoon of dark batter with 1 teaspoon of cream cheese batter. Baked 15 minutes. 
I would advise only filling the liner 1/3 full no matter the size. I might try using brownie batter next time, which doesn't rise so high.

I tired to make this recipe for mini cup cakes- it tasted good but didn't work as well as the pics for a mini cake- the filling sort of stayed on the top intstead of sinking into the middle.

I thought these would be so rich that I wouldn't like them, but they are perfect! I used hot chocolate instead of water and special dark cocoa powder.

These were so great.  I had never had a black bottom cupcake, but love the idea of combining cupcakes and cheesecakes.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic.  I made these 2 days ahead of our cook out and I think the extra time made them taste even better.  They are also particularly tasty if kept in the fridge and eaten cold.  Will be adding this to my recipe box.

I added some instant coffee granules to 1/2 c. hot water, added 1/2 c. milk to make the 1 c. liquid.  Added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract to the cream cheese mixture.  I got 16 cupcakes out of the recipe, baked for only 18 minutes.  The extra cream cheese mix went into a ramekin and baked.  I saved some mini chocolate chips and pushed them into the center of each cupcake after they came out of the oven, which melted and was so VERY yummy.

These are amazing! Taste just as good as my Nana's! I follow the recipe exactly the way it is, and perfect each time. I do recommend taking them out right away and placing them in an air tight container. Mine stay so moist.

These were great! I made it exactly according to the recipe, which I think everyone should do the first time they try a recipe! I got about 16 cupcakes. Next time I think I will substitute milk for the water. Oddly the cream cheese inside was a little undercooked while the cake part turned out perfect.

I would definitely  make these again. They were so good! I bought cream cheese icing just in case but I enjoyed them without any icing. I had to cook mine for about 10 minutes longer. This recipe made me 18 cupcakes.

These are unbelievably good! I did not change a thing...except I did not have choco chips which I substituted with chopped up chocolate bar. Delicious!! They're so rich that you should ideally make these mini-cupcake-sized. Delectable!!

I have made this recipe many times. It's easy to follow and turns out every time. I substitute 2/3 of the oil called for with apple sauce, which makes them more moist and light. Agree with another reviewer that the cream cheese has to be soft. I leave it sitting on top of my stove while pre-heating for several minutes and that does the trick. If you prefer a less-sweet taste, you can get away with less sugar in the filling and batter and they are still delicious.

I wouldn't eat these again warm.  The melted chocolate was overpowering and I wasn't fond of the hot cream cheese either.  After a night in the fridge they were pretty good, though.  The reformed chocolate was much better tasting.  I had used coffee instead of water as suggested and the flavor of dark chocolate really builds up the more you eat.

My recipe made 24.  I had cream cheese mixture left over.  I did go back and add more to each cupcake, but still had a lot left over.  I wouldn't recommend overdoing it on the cream cheese. Next time, I would make more cake mixture, maybe 1/2 batch.  I'm not understanding the "blah" reviews about the cake, mine was moist, chocolatey and very tasty.  I will try the coffee substitute next time as I normally do this but I was pretty surprised how good this recipe is as written.  I baked mine for 25 minutes.  I will make these again!

The cream cheese part was pretty good, but the chocolate cake was lacking both in flavor and texture. Dry, bland cake.

This recipe is mmmm mmmmm good!!  The only changes I made was to add half a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling and a spoon of instant coffee to the water. 20 minutes they were done.  I also got 15 cupcakes out of this recipe, but then I like mine tall.

This is BY FAR my favorite Black Bottom Cupcake recipe! And this is the one that has won over my best friend's in laws and family from Australia as well as my boyfriends out of town family. I love making these! Upon the advice of other bakers, I too switch the water for very strongly steeped coffee. I also shake the chocolate chips in flour before putting them in to the batter because they don't sink straight to the bottom that way. They tend to stay more toward the middle and top. I love making a coffee infused cream cheese icing for these too! It's always a hit!

I have made these for years. MOST IMPORTANT!! ONLY use Philadelphia Cream cheese. I have used off brands, low fat, fat free. All will get runny and not give you the same result. A few walnuts or pecans make them extra special. Once I even try icing them. Too much. Wouldn't recommend. They never last long!!

Yummy combination of chocolate and cheesecake--doesn't get any better! I always have a lot of the cheesecake mixture left over when I follow this recipe, so I now double the chocolate cake portion of this recipe and follow the cheesecake portion as is.  This ratio works perfectly for me (no leftovers). When baking in mini muffin tins I bake at 350 degrees for 17 minutes.

This is a great recipe!  Don't substitute the lower fat cream cheese, and do use a good chocolate.  Use all of the cream cheese mixture.  I used to have a lot left over, but now I'll add some additional cream cheese/ chocolate chip mixture to each one until it 's all used.  Mine are usually baked within 15 minutes.  They also stay nice for a week, if covered.

The cupcakes came out really good!! Like some people suggested I made some changes- 1. Ignored the salt in both the cream cheese and the chocolate mix, I don't think it adds anything 2. I didn't add egg to the cream cheese mix so that it won't be very runny 3. Used 1/3 cup cocoa instead of the suggested 1/4 - not sure if this actually makes a difference 4. Substituted water with 2% milk so that the chocolate mix won't be very runny and finally 5. to bake a tray of 15 medium-large cupcakes, it took just about 15-20 mins.

I made the cream cheese mix using the amounts given in the recipe (omitting the egg and salt). Be sure to use all of it in the cupcakes - it really makes the cupcakes yummier!!

I also ended up freezing some of the cupcakes. They tasted fresh and just as yummy as when it came out of the oven after reheating!!!

I was ready to throw these out once they cooled. They were awful.  After sitting in the fridge overnight they were significantly better.  They'll get eaten but I won't make them again.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with sour filling when they were fresh.  After sitting, the filling tasted more tangy than sour.  The cake is dry and flavorless.  If I took them out of the oven sooner (I left it for 25 mins) the cake may have been more moist, but the flavor's not nearly intense enough.

I ended up with enough cake batter for 21 cupcakes, not 24.  I probably had enough filling for 24, but used it up in the 21 pretty easily.

Next time I try black bottoms, I'll probably use box cake mix, and will use way more sugar in the filling.  I tried Rachael Ray's recipe for these cupcakes before.  Her filling calls for a cup of sugar and it's not half bad.  She only uses an egg yolk instead of a whole egg so the filling sinks a lot more than this filling did.  I had good luck with this recipe's filling consistency.

If you follow this recipe exactly, these cupcakes turn out beautifully.  I made them the ay before going to a friend's house and just heated them up for 10 minutes before serving.  They were gooey like they just came out of the oven for the first time!

We just weren't crazy about these. They were a bit on the dry side. Despite the chocolate chips, my kids wouldn't touch them after one taste which was disappointing. They were much better warm than they were the next day but even then they just didn't have a whole lot of taste.

These turned out quite nicely.  I made a few minor adjustments: added 1 tsp. vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, substituted stevia for half the sugar in the dry mixture, increased cocoa powder to 1/3 cup, added 1 tsp. instant coffee granules to dry mix and subbed in a little leftover coffee for part of the water, and used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I used a jumbo muffin tin, greased it and dusted the bottoms of the cups with cocoa powder, and all the cupcakes came out of the pan cleanly after cooling for a few minutes.  They only needed 20 minutes in the oven.  It made 12 large cupcakes, with a tiny bit of batter and a lot of filling remaining (I baked the leftovers in a couple ramekins).

This recipe is great, but I do agree that there is way too much of the cream cheese mixture. Also, i've done it using this cake recipe as well as once using a box mix, and the results were drastically different.
DO NOT use the box mix. All of the cream cheese sinks into the cake because the cake is too light. 
The cake recipe here is perfect.

Follow the recipe and DO not short cut and use a cake mix. My grandma made these all of the time when I was little and I was craving some, but short on time so used boxed mix. Not even remotely close to the way they are supposed to turn out. Follow the recipe  n they are delicious!

Are they supposed to be crunchy on top?  I got 12 large cupcakes and used all the filling.  I filled the cups 2/3 full though, not the 1/3 as stated int he recipe.  Despite their bigger size, they were done in 27 min--and crispy on top baked on the middle rack of oven.  Super good cupcake though, and I like what the mini chips add to the usual filling.  I used the coffee instead of water as suggested by other reviewers, and all else was as listed.  Thanks for sharing!  Next time I will try double the cake recipe for the same amount of filling.

I've been making cupcakes for coworkers on a weekly basis when I stumbled across this recipe.  I was in need of a new idea so I gave it a shot.  I received a round of applause along with hugs and kudos.  They turned out amazing and the presentation was spectacular.  I would highly recommend them and make them again in a heartbeat!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it exactly as written with two minor exceptions, a) I did not have apple cider vinegar so I used regular b) I only had regular sized chocolate chips

I made this and my whole family loved it! But I served this in 12 muffins instead of 24. It looked gorgeous and tasted great!

The chocolate cake part of this recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law and it's from the 1930's or earlier.  It's been very good & easy for many decades.  The cream cheese filling makes it quite decadent.

I'm a college student who loves to bake, and these were a huge hit with me friends during study sessions. I forgot who suggested this in an earlier review, but I substituted 1 cup of strong coffee for the 1 cup of water. These were exactly what a bunch of cramming college students needed during exam week! :)

I have been making these for a long time & they are easy & super tasty. Using mini cupcakes papers makes them a nice bite size treat, so you can enjoy them w/o over doing it!

These are the best. I recommend making them in the mini cup cake pan. I made Them just as the recipe states, the only thing I did not do was put the chips on the top. They are so easy to just pop in your mouth! yum

I was in a hurry and just used the cream cheese mixture with boxed dark chocolate cake mix and it worked perfectly!  The cheesecake mixture stayed at the top didn't collapse.  I did halve the sugar because I don't like too sweet sweets (if that makes sense).  And they tasted even better the next day.  Have made these twice and have had multiple requests for the recipe.

Everytime I make these cupcakes I get rave reviews. Everone loves them! Including my husband who doesn't like chocolate or cake. He's a picky eater. :)This is a great recipe, and it's very easy to change it up if you need to. I usually leave out the vinegar and add more chocolate.

I can't give this a 5 because I was iffy about the original recipe, therefor I modified it. I added an egg to the cake batter and used white vinegar instead of apple cider. I also added a bit more cocoa. I baked these for 21 minutes and they were perfectly moist and gooey. With these modifications, I would rate this a 5. I will be making this again!!

Really great recipe.  Mini chocolate chips work out really well - I think the larger ones would just sort of sink to the bottom.

These were great! They really don't need any frosting, but may be fun to experiment with-like adding a glaze or something?  They were a big hit at a joint birthday family party.

Used other reviewers' suggestions of omitting salt and what not. Cooking time definitely took longer for these to set...and when cooled were extra hard and crispy. The cheesecake filling didn't taste like cheesecake, but the chocolate cake itself was pretty tasty. Won't be making these again.

These were very good. I would probably rate at a 4.5 if I could. I didn't like them as well as some others did; The cake seemed a little bland to me and I think it could have been a little bit sweeter. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. The filling was wonderful.

These were quite easy to make and came out very very yummy!  Be careful not to overload the chocolate in the cupcake tray.  Also, add a little more sugar.  I thought they were great, but could have been sweeter!

printed recipe because it seemed simple enough and it was. My 13 yearold daughter made these followed instructions to a tee. We found they were really dense for a cupcake and very rich,as to be expected with cheesecake fillings.not sure what it was but it seemed to be lacking something. We will probably make this one a time or two again but will experiment with some of the suggestions of the others to see if we can make these more to our taste.

These cupcakes are fabulous. My only complaint is that their appearance when done is not too appealing. I frost them with the chocolate ganache frosting on this website and that solves the problem and also makes these cupcakes taste even better.

I have made these for 20+ years.  They a so good, always a favorite.  I think they actually get better after a day or two.  Heating them for a few seconds in the microwave make the center even more gooey and delicious.  Give them a try!

My husband loved these!  I think my own baking made these not as good as I've had, so I will be trying them again!  They were still tasty though and were soon all gone!  Thank you!

My kids really enjoyed these. I doubled the recipe for the cake portion and found that the filling was enough for all, making 28 cupcakes total. I put extra vanilla in the cake portion and forgot to add the chocolate chips to the filling. We ended up spreading 5 or so chocolate chips on the top of the baked cupcakes for a little chocolate oomph.

As many times as I have eaten Black Bottom Cupcakes, I had never made them before.  This recipe was easy and delicious.  I assume I need to keep them in the fridge because of the cream cheese in them, but they definitely taste best warmed up.

Very good, moist cupcakes. I omitted the chocolate chips, but next time I will definatly use them. Also, I love the salt in this recipe and think its important. Salt brings a sort of "oreo" quality to them. 20 minutes was a good baking time.

I carefully followed the other reviews regarding extra vanilla extract, room temperature ingredients, and properly mixing the filling. I add a little extra chocolate chips in mine as I preferred the taste and texture more. These cupcakes aren't the most elegant looking, but they are incredibly delicious. After being refrigerated overnight, they taste even better!!

Amazing!  The only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 cup mayo to the cake mix to keep it moist.  For me, it only made 12 and I had alot of the cream cheese mixture left over...maybe I filled them too full?

I was a bit disappointed - I halved the recipe as I only wanted a dozen, not two dozen, and only ended up getting 8 out of it. The cream cheese mixture was too much and too runny, so ended up covering the tops, and cooking into a grilled cheese type topping which was odd. My husband did say they tasted nice though.

I made these for my brother's birthday to take to school. Mine didn't turn out the best, they weren't bad, but they weren't good either. But, that doesn't mean I wouldn't give this recipe another try, I don't think it's anything that can't be fixed. The cake part was fine, even though I used 1/3 cup cocoa powder instead of 1/4 cup. And, I found that the cream cheese filling ended up not really being a filling, so next time I would double that and plop more in there. I tried them before I sent them with my brother and ended up making another batch of the cream cheese mixture for his class to use as frosting. Plus, I only cooked the muffins for 20 minutes. I think if I were to double the filling next time, these might be better.

Not bad, but not great.  Not ashamed to serve them, but probably won't make using this recipe again.  If I'm going to make cake/cupcakes from scratch, I expect the flavor to be better than these.

I like the idea of the chocolate cake/cheesecake combo, so I may try this again with different recipes.  I found both the chocolate cake and the cheesecake to be bland.  Would have preferred a "sharper" chocolate taste to the cake, and a tarter cheese cake.

Worth trying though, your preference may be different than mine!  With only 1/3 cup oil, 1 egg and not even that much sugar, I would guess that this is a pretty figure-friendly recipe.  I got about 20 cupcakes out of the recipe.

Oh, one tip:  I put the cream cheese mixture into a pastry/frosting bag and squirted it onto the chocolate batter.  Made it easy to divide up and not messy!

I am known at Christmas time for making the greatest black bottoms. Everyone always raves! I lost the recipe I normally use and found this one, hoping it would be just as good. I just made them. They are terrible. I followed the recipe to the 'T'. First batch I only left in for 22 minutes and they ended up burning. Next batch I was sure not to burn. I took them out after only 18 minutes. They were not burnt but they are as hard as a rock. I made another batch and it is the same thing. It's really hard to get them out of the paper. I've made 3 batches and none of them turned out well enough to bring to any parties or give away. A big disappointment.

This was a good recipe. For the chocolate cupcake part, I used the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site. I didn't have any leftover cream cheese sauce though. It was a hit with everyone that tried it. I would make this again.

I don't know if I can fairly judge this recipe because I cheated and used a Devil's Food cake mix, but my whole family enjoyed them a lot.  I had enough cake batter left over that I made up two mini loafs out of it.  I added some chopped up walnuts to the batter and frosted them with whipped cream cheese frosting when done.  I tried some frosting on one of the cupcakes but we found it to be a bit rich.  They are good all on their own.

I halved the recipe to try it and it made 8 cupcakes.  I had plenty of leftover cake batter.  Cupcakes popped right out of my greased foil cups.  I used a medium sized scoop and did equal amounts of cake batter and cream cheese.  Tasted yummy cold.

This recipe is a snap to make and very good. I made them for Valentine's Day and gave them as little gifts.  I had so many compliments on these...very good. (I added a bit more chocolate to the recipe:)

Oh, I'm sorry this just wasn't what we were expecting or very tasty. Although I had a neighbor who LOVED it and I gave them all to her. So I'm glad I didn't waste the ingredients for the trash.

I like these cupcakes a lot, but I did as one reviewer said and added some almond extract to the batter in place of the vanilla.  I did not care for the over-powering taste of the almond, but other than that they were fine.  I would have given them five stars but they are strange with no frosting.

This recipe is great! This is one of my childhood favorites and I am so glad that I was able to find this recipe on this site. Made it yesterday for a superbowl party and they were gone in 20 minutes. They turned out great. TIP- make sure not to fill cupcakes all the way because the cupcakes will rise and have a crispy top. I  made that mistake on the first batch but perfect second time around!

Excellent, especially while still warm.  Even after they cool, you can just pop them in the microwave for about 15 seconds and they are just as good.  The chocolate chips in these really made them, IMO.  I will definately make these again, thanks!

These are great! For me it made 15 regular size cupcakes- they were raised a bit over the paper. I made huge dollops of the cream cheese filling and didn't have any left over - - - too good to waste! They were a big hit. They taste amazing an hour after baking, then the next day, and the day after that! Will make again!

This recipe is delicious!!  I made a batch and a half of the chocolate batter.  (The cream cheese mixture was perfect!)  I had just the right amount of batter, and none of the cupcakes overflowed. I found when I made the recipe as is - the cupcakes didn't look as good because they were too short.

These tasted like chocolate cupcakes with a dollop of cheesecake on top. They weren't as chocolaty as I like but they were still good and looked appetizing. I halved the recipe and it made a tray of mini cupcakes along with 5 large ones. The mini cupcakes were bite sized and so cute.

These cupcakes were a lovely texture! Used milk instead of water as per some of the previous reviews. Also I used rice vinegar instead of cider because that's all I had. Shortened baking time to 17minutes so that the cheesecake tops wouldn't sink as much. The cheese bits were delish but the chocolate parts are missing some flavour. The overwhelming taste was strangely of oil.. Nevertheless, the look better than I expected!

Dunno... The chocolaty bit was excellent (almost doubled the cacao!) but cream cheese mixture was completely set even in the middle of cooking and didn't taste of much at all. I glazed the cupcakes with Cream Cheese Cream topping from this site and they were absolutely delicious. Maybe next time I'll omit the cream cheese bit, but then why not just make simple chocolate cupcakes?

Are these cupcakes supposed to be like Hostess cupcakes, a bit of gooey filling in the middle? Because mine did not turn out like that at all. In fact, I would call mine "marbled-cheescake cupcakes" because the cream cheese was more swirled (and fully cooked, rather than gooey) than hidden. I should of followed the reviews and cooked for only 20 minutes. Also, the cream cheese taste did not come through at all I still don't understand how this recipe got such rave reviews.

These were very tasty and easy to make. I actually ran out of sugar and used Equal Sugar Lite and sweetened cocoa. These worked out great for packaging and taking to a school carnival.

I've always loved these cupcakes, and i used to get them from the giant but they stopped selling them. But i think they are the best when you use the mini muffin pans and when served/eaten cold. So store them in the fridge. They are the best.

I made these for my friend for her birthday and they were a hit.  Even her sweet-hating mother liked them!

I was a bit disappointed when I tasted the first one, but the next morning they were really delicious and everyone loved them. I did substitute water with milk as someone suggested. 25 minutes in the oven was enough. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

I followed directions exactly due to the great response on this and to me they were average.  Not that great when first comes out of the oven but good the next day.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made them in mini muffin tins without papers- I just sprayed PAM in the tins.  I did not use mini chocolate chips, I just put 1 - 3 semisweet chocolates on top of the dollop of cream cheese.  They were delicious!  Usually dessert sit around my office for a day or two but these are almost gone & I've only been in a couple hours!  They taste EXACTLY like Starbucks' Chocolate Cream Cheese Muffins, which is what I was hoping to replicate, & the semisweet chocolate chip gives it a nice kick.

YUMMY!

Amazing!  I made them for a dinner party and they were devoured.  I would definitely cook them for the lower time range, because they're fantastic gooey.  Plus, I'm not too fond of having the creamcheese part grown.  Excellent cupcake and SO easy!

DEFINITELY USE PAPER LINERS!  I used non-stick spray and had a really hard time trying to get them out of the pan.  These were very tasty, but I honestly was hoping for a little more.  I was looking for something up to par with the blackbottoms you get in a coffee shop.  This wasn't that recipe for me, but don't get me wrong- they still tasted very good.

Used 1/3 cup cocoa instead and replaced the water with milk.  It turned out great, except I glazed some with sweetened whip cream.  Although I think this is a great recipe I would not make it again.  It looks much better than it actually tastes.  And the cake is very sticky and the paper liners stuck to the cake.  Thanks for sharing all the same!

Black bottom are my favorite cupcakes.  The recipe is just ok and I made it twice.  I found the chocolate cake to be just a bit dry.  I baked them for the maximum time.  I will make them again but will lessen the baking time.

gotta say not what i expected.  i made 3 dozen and the last ones i baked at 190 for 15-20 min and they came out the best as far as rich and gooey cupcake.  the others were kind of hockey-puck like.  nice presentation and the cheese and chocolate were a nice compliment to each other.

I only had enough batter to make 22 cupcakes, and they were so thin the cream cheese was falling out the bottom of them!  Still, great recipe, just increase amount of batter.  These are still delicious!

I left my cupcakes in too long so they're a bit dry. My fault. But the taste is great and it looks interesting. I will definitely try it again.

I made these to send to my son's kindergarten class for his 6th birthday.
I'm not sure how the kids liked them but I know I liked how easy they were to send 
to school without the big frosting mess!  We saved a few for ourselves and my husband's comment
was, "why don't you ever make things like this for us?"  Big hit  in my household!
