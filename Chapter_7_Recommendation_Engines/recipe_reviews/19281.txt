This is a good recipe, not what I was looking for, but they turned out very good.  Need to be eaten quickly or will dry out within the week after being made.  My son loved them and we'll make them again!

I saw this recipe and thought, "Hey I can use my waffle iron for something other than waffles." So I gave it a go. I covered the cookies with green frosting I had left over from icing a cake, they really did look like little turtles! My friends loved them. They called me Martha Stewart. Which is kind of weird, 'cause I'm a guy. The cookies came out really cakey and they definitely needed the frosting, but with frosting they were fantastic! I don't know about the other turtle cookie recipes (hey, how many people comparison shop for turtle cookie recipes?) but as far as the genre goes this recipe rocks. It will definitely get you brownie points at a party - no pun intended. Ha ha.

I made these in 4-H when I was little.  They are best eaten right away.  My boys (ages 6 and 3) had a ball making them at first but got bored making just 4 at time.  next time I will cut the recipe in 1/2 for instant gratification.

My sister made these when our children were young. We enjoyed them then and my husband is enjoying them now! Great fun recipe. We used Cherry frosting and it made them even greater!
