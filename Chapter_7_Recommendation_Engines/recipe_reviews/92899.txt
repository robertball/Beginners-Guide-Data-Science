Holy smokes! Talk about a taste explosion. This was an incredible party in my mouth. I was wary of trying it cause I always go for the ultra highly rated and tested recipes from this site (its just meal security) but I went out on a limb for this one and was sensationally pleased. Trust me. I know what Im talking about. You HAVE to make this soup.  Update: I just wanted to say that I use the great big can of broth or even the box rather than the 14oz can the recipe calls for. Also, I use a turkey kielbasa or turkey smoked sausage in a package (by the bacon)rather than buying a pound fresh sausage in the meat section. I slice it thin and prefer it in taste. I make this soup at least every other week as my family just LOVES it and it is so quick and easy!!!

WOW!!!!!!!!  This was SO, so good.  I used turkey sausage that was flavored with sun dried tomatoes and I think it really made it even better.  Chopped up the onion and garlic in my food processor, threw it all in with the tomatoes, etc., and let it simmer for an hour and a half.  It was simply amazing!  NO salt needed, the sausage and tomatoes give it plenty.  Easy, healthy, freezes well....what more could you want??  THANKS for a great recipe!

Yes, this soup is quite delicious -- but the best thing about this recipe is how easy it is to throw together.  Super easy, that is.  And it tastes and looks like it's spent a good day simmering on the stove top.  Changes: I doubled the chicken stock to maintain its soupy consistency -- otherwise it thickens up to a stew over time.  This was one of the soups we presented during our annual soup extravaganza and it received many kudos.  We have made it several times and will continue to make it.

Excellent soup. My whole family loved it.  I recently made it again with some modifications for a vegetarian diet (Boca sausages and vegetable broth), and it was still awesome. Thank you for this great recipe.

this soup is sooo easy and tasty , you have to try it ...if you are reading this then you are interested and won't be disapointed. i have made this a number of times now and like other reviews i added some extra stock and simmer it a bit longer if i am not in a hurry otherwise i make it like the recipe states. also i have used different beans like romano , or red and white kidney and it still tastes great. i also have used regular and spicy italian sausage...doesn't have to be turkey...oh man i am hungry now, guess what i am gonna make tonight for dinner?

I made this and served it the following day to my whole family and it was well recieved!!  My Dad can not stop talking about it.  I added more broth because I simmered for an hour or more.  I also added some crushed red pepper.

This soup is delicious! It is easy to put together and has wonderful flavor. Next time I make it I will put in half the meat and add another can of beans, as I am not a huge meat fan. I will definitely make this again.

Wow, this soup is amazing! For those who would like to adapt this to dry beans, here is how I did it: 1) Soak 1 lb dry navy beans overnight 2) Drain navy beans and rinse 3) Place in dutch oven with enough water to cover by 1 inch and boil for 10 minutes 4) Drain and rinse beans again (this is to greatly decrease the musical effect of the beans) 5) Repeat step 3, but boil for 1 hour. 6) Follow the rest of the recipe as indicated, except you should probably not simmer homecooked beans too long, as they break up more readily than the canned (I cooked mine for an additional 25 minutes in the soup, and they were mostly whole, but enough of them broke apart that the soup became a bit thicker than the author's picture - which is how I like it). Good luck!

I loved this recipe. Since I have vegetarians in my family, I made it without the sausage and it was still excellent. Great soup.

This was delicious and easy to prepare, minimal chopping involved.  Could be ready in 30 minutes and can be made in all one pot.  Has the taste of soup that has simmered all day.  Very good.

I tried this out for the ladies in my neighborhood bible study and it was very well received. What great flavor! I am passing on the recipe for this one and would only recommend that you let it simmer longer to really bring the flavor out (add a bit more chicken broth for longer cooking so it won't be too thick).

Delicous, I should have made a double batch. We cleaned the pot dry. I served it with fresh homemade buns. I started cooking it at 4:30 and we ate at 5:30, it was perfect. I will be cooking this again soon.

Excellent!  I cooked the onion, garlic and sausage in a pan and then put everything into a crock pot and let it simmer for about 4 hrs.  I did double the amount of chicken broth and I served over pasta, which I cooked separately.  Really satisfying, tasty meal.

everybody loved this!! I had to modify due to what i had in stock vs. going to the grocery store:
1.) no garlic so added 2 tablespoons grey poupon with onion to brown meat
2.) substituted pinto beans for kidney beans
3.) can of rotel diced tomato/chilis instead
4.) chopped carrots and celery
5.) bay leaves, chili powder, and oregano
6.) didn't use any olive oil (sausage was fatty enough)

Wow.  This soup is amazing.  My husband, 4 year old and I all LOVED it.  I am so glad there are leftovers! (That doesn't speak to the soup, there are only 3 of us so we always have leftovers!)  FYI: 1 serving is approximately 1 1/2 cups.  Also, we made a bit healthier by only using 1 TBSP of olive oil, using low sodium chicken broth and no salt added tomatoes.  I added in a few sprinkles of dried basil/oregano to make up for not having flavored tomatoes, but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was amazing (I know I've already said that but it deserves repeating!)

Wow!  I made this the first time simply because I had all the necessary ingredients on hand but it has quickly become a staple.  Even though there are not too many cold evenings in Southern California, we take even the slightest chill in the air as a sign it it time to make this soup again.

I used this recipe as a template, and it's ideal for that.  I started beans from dry, 2 cups.  I used a local venison-pork sausage that is leaner an firmer, so I very thinly sliced it rather than crumbling it.  I used a 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes and added oregano and basil.  And the soup was superb, with a dash of Louisiana hot sauce and a side of homemade Italian herb bread.

ABSOLUTLY FABULOUS, and very easy. My kids loved it, my husband loved it. I did double the recipe and added another can of beans. I let it cook all day and it was perfect. Thankyou for the great recipe, I will pass this around my family.

This turned out really well. It came together quickly so was a great week day meal!  I did alter for what I had on hand  and to make it a veg-meal, but they were simple changes and kept with the recipe. I had zesty vegetarian Italian meatless balls in the freezer and used vegetable broth for the protein substitutions. My canned tomatoes were plain so I just added the fresh basil, oregano and thyme and extra garlic with the rosemary. I simmered a little longer than called for, and just served with toasty bread. The man was happy with the meatless meal and sucked up his whole serving! Thank you!

My whole family loved this, even my very picky 6 and 3 year olds. I was a little sceptical but this recipe is definitely a winner. My family doesn't like onion so I left it out and I couldn't find canned Great Northern Beans so I used cannellini beans but those are the only changes I made. I will definitely make this again.

I made this today and it was terrific!  I used spicy Italian Turkey sausage,  28 oz crushed tomatoes and 2 cannelloni and 1 black bean.  I had fresh oregano and rosemary and chopped up a good amount- 2 tblsps or so.  Added the fresh pepper and let it simmer.  Just so simple but delicious.  really good!

I've been looking at this recipie for a while and decided to try it tonight. For the basic ingredients this is full of flavor and amazing.  I did use about 22 ounces of chicken broth because it seemed like 14 ounces wasn't enough, but I think the original amounts are spot on.  Easy and delicious, thanks for sharing.

This was excellent!  I added some crushed red pepper, chili powder, spinach, and an extra can of tomatoes (w/okra). I also used Italian seasoning instead of just dried rosemary.  It's also important to use more chicken broth.  I used a box (32oz) of chicken broth. Do not add salt - it's not needed. I also used 3 cans different kinds of white beans for a variety. I used turkey sausage in a package that you find near the bacon in the grocery store.  I quartered it. I served it with crusty French bread.  So easy and fast!  My whole family loved it! I will definitely be making this a lot.

Very tasty. I use any beans, garbanzo, pinto, whatever we have in a can.  Also I tend to go heavy on the herbs, it never hurts.  Parmesan shredded is a nice touch.

Easy to make and tasty. I used pork Italian sausage browning it first then added uncooked bacon to simmer in soup. My husband likes lots of flavor added crushed red pepper flakes 2 tsp. I will try it with turkey sausage in the future. Also had carrots and celery in fridge so chopped those up and added to the soup. Served with cornbread. Thank you for the recipe even though I added other ingredients your soup was the base for mine. Yummy!

This soup was great. I love hearty soups with beans. I substituted sausage that i cut small with the casings still on The two big links in the pack from Hilshire farm, still turkey sausage though, but this recipe is good so you can keep it the same or add and substitute meats or beans and it is still delicious. Thanks

Really nice and simple yet tasty! I ended up using turkey bacon because I didn't have any sausage on hand, and I added a handful of rice to make it heartier (I also added a little extra liquid since I added the rice). I love the touch of rosemary, and the simplicity of the recipe. I'll definitely make this again!

This is an awesome recipe.  I've used turkey and pork hot italian sausage, and both work well.  I can't be bothered to remove the casings, so they just stay on.  I've never heard of "Great Northern Beans" before and I live in Canada aka the Great White North.  However, when I am stateside I am able to find them in the grocery stores there.  I probably make this recipe several times a month.  Thanks for sharing.

This is definitely a very quick and easy recipe and makes a great weeknight supper on a cold winter day.  I used a turkey italian sausage that had fennel in it and my husband loved the flavor.  I only had one can of italian tomatoes on hand, so I substituted some leftover marinara sauce for the other can and it worked perfectly to keep the consistency of a soup.

As good as it sounds!!  I went ahead and just added an extra can of beans and an extra can of broth.  The other proportions will still fine -- just made it go a little further since we were all looking for more!

Easy, quick and very flavorful. I made it even easier and quicker by using Aidells Sundried Tomato and Turkey Sausage Meatballs. They're organic, low fat, gluten free and PRECOOKED. (Available in regular packs in grocery stores, and in a large pack at Costco. I divide them into ziplocks and freeze to have on hand for quick meals.) For this soup, I cut the meatballs into 1/4ths, skipping the whole step of cooking sausage. Added a twig of live rosemary from my garden while simmering (along with dried herbs) and removed it before serving. Tripled the garlic. Did have to add more broth than recipe suggests. Used my favorite S&W canned white beans. This is a DELICIOUS soup!.

I made this exactly as specified and it was very good! The only issue we had was that it needed something to cut the acid from all the tomatoes. Next time I'll add a little sugar. Thanks so much for sharing.

My family loved this recipe.  I mistakenly added beef broth instead of chicken broth and it turned out well, so I'd say you could use either.  I thought it was a little greasy so next time I would drain the fat or use less olive oil with the onions.  We ate it with an artisan filone bread which went really well with it, and a green vegetable served beside.  I drained  two of the cans of beans and did not drain the third can so there would be a little more body to the soup.  Next time I would drain only one of the cans.

We accidentally poured 8oz of tomato sauce in it, but I think it made it better.  Good recipe.

Really tasty!  I simmered mine for nearly an hour so I added a bit more chicken broth.
