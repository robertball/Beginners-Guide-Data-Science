Loved this! I was a little skeptical at first but the flavour was perfect. We made garlic roasted vegetables which complimented beautifully. We will definitely make this again!

My family enjoyed this dish, however, the next time I fix it I will reduce the amount of red wine a little.

This was quite tasty and it was a different way to prepare chicken. I followed the recipe exactly except I needed to add more oil to the skillet to keep the coating from scorching. I'm not really accustomed to a sweet sauce for chicken and I was wondering how the sauce would be with pork. Thanks for posting. I always need another idea for chicken.
