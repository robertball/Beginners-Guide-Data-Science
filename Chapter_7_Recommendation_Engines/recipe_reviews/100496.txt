I make these with whole wheat flour, a little extra milk, and some cinnamon and orange. They have a fine, dense crumb and a perfect "grown-up cupcake" flavor.  I like them with a cream cheese frosting.

VERY good!  Came out great.  I made them in a mini muffin tin and had 42 mini cupcakes!  I changed the frosting slightly by adding a package of cream cheese to make it more sturdy/thicker (as per the whipped frosting recipes on here).  Added tiny bits of strawberries straight to the "frosting" and they came out fantastic!  You can taste the honey in these for sure!  Mine ended up like mini strawberry shortcakes.

Very good! They are a more dense cake than most recipes, but the light frosting balances it well. I added a few more tablespoons of honey because my husband is such a big honey fan! This recipe works great if you use peaches as well.

These were a total hit at my niece's first birthday. I used a whipped cream cream cheese froasting that complemented them perfectly. They had a perfect honey flavor! Yum!

These were a hit! I added roughly an extra 1/6 cup of honey.  Used the whipped cream recipe provided. Topped the cupcakes with strawberries and blueberries. Will definitely make these again.

Yum! Made this cake for a recent party and everyone loved it! The cake is a little denser than most, but the honey flavor is light and not too sweet, which my husband loved! Also, made this with the "Real Strawberry Frosting" by Candice, which is also great!

I used one deep 9 inch baking pan instead of cupcakes and it took about 30 minutes to bake. (Normally would probably have to use 2 standard 9 inch baking pans.)

This would be more appropriately named "honey shortcake".  Flavor was great and sweet enough to not sweeten the whipped cream at all.  Next time, I will serve it with sliced strawberries.

I needed honey cakes for sonsâ€™s Latin Club Forum so I made them without frosting. They taste great, a little sweet for my taste but texture was terrific and they are perfect for whatI need.

Really torn between 3 and 4 stars, 3 stars because I don't think it's really a cupcake recipe but 4 stars because it has a great taste. I made a thin 4 layer cake with this recipe. Very dense as others have said but tastes great. I added a little almond extract and 1 more egg yolk to make it moister and it tastes great. Definitely going to be a heavy cake but depends on what you are in the mood for.

I substituted for the buttermilk as I had none so they came out a little dry. However, they taste amazing and smell great while baking. Very easy prep as well!

I made the cupcakes according to the recipe. For the topping, I pureed fresh strawberries with the cream and sugar. Love the look of it, but next time may increase the vanilla, because mostly the cupcakes just smelled of eggs.

Excellent recipe - very easy and lovely texture (though yes, not cup-cake-like). I also didn't have buttermilk but used kefir instead.

It's not overly sweet like some cupcakes.  This was the first time I made them, so I think I'll add more sugar next time to make them a tad sweeter.  It's also a very dense cupcake, which will keep you from eating more than one.  And I did follow the recipe exactly as written.  No subs.

I found them too sweet and too bread-like. I will not be making this recipe again.

I made the mistake of baking these for a girlfriend on her 40th birthday.  She's strong-armed me into making them every year for her since (sometimes more than once a year ...) 

These are a great (not too sweet) dessert for guests, parties, you name it.

Loved the taste of the cupcake (I added a bit more honey, and the taste really came through). I also loved the whipped topping, all together it tasted like strawberries and cream. However the whipped topping is not good for transport (it will melt). So I would recommend only making this with this topping if you are serving it soon after topping the cupcake. If not, go with a frosting.
