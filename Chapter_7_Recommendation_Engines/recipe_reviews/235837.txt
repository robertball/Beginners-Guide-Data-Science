I made a couple of small changes.  I used dried thyme for fresh, used half yellow squash half zucchini, used a roma tomato chopped for the cherry, and added in a handful of chopped spinach.  Not major changes IMO, and we thought it was delicious!

Followed everything according to the recipe. Used chicken broth because that's all I had on hand.  The soup came out fantastic!

This is a good recipe,  and it is not outrageously expensive. The only change is to the sausage, which we only buy on sale and we don't eat that often .  We had kielbasa in the freezer that was starting to get old.  So to make it smoked spicy we added 1tsp of sweet paprika, 2 tsp Spanish smoked paprika, 1 tsp fennel, garlic, salt and pepper and a touch of cayenne.  I added all the spices when the sausage and onions were sautéing, 30 seconds to bloom the spices.   Living in Michigan our outdoor garden is some time away so it had to be dried thyme but we had fresh chives from the window garden. These are the only changes we made, his worked so well.  We will be making it again.

Absolutely fabulous... Added kale from the garden to add a little hardiness.  Also added a little Parmesan at the end with the chives and cherry tomatoes. The tomatoes are a must have in this recipe...

It was a huge hit with my husband and myself!  He was pleasantly surprised, as he is not a zucchini fan.  But he asked for seconds!!!. Delicious !!!

Very tasty and easy to make. You get a hearty, flavorful stew without much effort. I was using bigger zucchini’s than Chef John, and they almost filled the pot, so I topped it off with a cup of chicken stock to raise the liquid level. Instead of fresh thyme, used about a tsp of dried. Andouille sausage seems like a must for this soup. Imparted a rich, spicy flavor throughout. Unfortunately the grocery store didn’t have cherry tomatoes, but this recipe still rocked.

It's delish and exceptionally easy to make. Followed the recipe as is with the exception of the sausage. I used chicken sausage (casing removed) b/c I don't eat pork. My only criticism is with the zucchini.  Not sure why, but the skin had a bitter taste.  Any recommendations for a substitute vegetable?

We loved this recipe!  I made a few changes just because I used what I had on hand.  I used chicken broth rather then vegetable broth.  I used roasted pepper chicken sausage and I added garlic because it was not in the sausage.  The left overs were better then the first time around!

This is really good but I also tweaked it a tad by adding 1 Tbsp of minced garlic,  a red bell pepper and handful of baby spinach.  Mmmmmm...

I made it with chorizo, added tomatoes to create the colour. Added celery for the extra flavour. It was so yummy! Thank you Chef John for this hearty meal!

Made this as written and it was wonderful!  Cut it in half, as there are just 2 of us, and  have enough left for another small meal.  Will definitely make it again.  Cannot go wrong with Chef John's recipes!

Very good. Will definitely be making this again. We have left overs tonight and put the stew over top of pierogies. Absolutely amazing by itself or on pierogies.

This has quickly become a family favorite. I use Earl Campbell Jalapeno Smoked Sausage, a mixture of whatever squashes are available, and add a fresh jalapeno seeded and diced for a little extra kick. I also use Russet potatoes because I don't care much for the Yukon Golds.
