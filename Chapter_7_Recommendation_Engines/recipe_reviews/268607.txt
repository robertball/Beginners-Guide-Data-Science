So moist! I followed the recipe exactly except that I hand-mixed the dry ingredients then I beat ALL of the ingredients on low until mixed. I found the parchment paper in the bottom of the pan really helped to remove the loaf! I had to cook mine the entire 70 minutes.

I made this recipe with a few differences. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and I believe that made this bread taste above and beyond my expectations! I also didn't have any nuts on hand so I used some dairy free dark chocolate chips. Everyone was raving about the bread!

Very good. I will definitely use this often. I would like to try it with some nuts next time.

I followed the recipe just as it was but at the end I added walnuts I had on hand this recipe did have quite a different taste than I expected and in the ingredients list the canned pumpkin wasn't listed!! I think in the future I will skip this one!!

The pumpkin bread was delicious. I followed the directions to the letter.
