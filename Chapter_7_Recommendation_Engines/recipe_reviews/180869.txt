AMAZING! I have made this twice and each time everyone was raving about the flavour. I used a thinly sliced baguette with a light spread of cream cheese and then a topping of the tapenade. YUM!

Really good. I used dried sundried tomatoes that were not packed in oil and then added roasted garlic olive oil. Serve with flat-bread crackers. Better when made a day or so ahead.

Did things a little differently.  Mixed all the ingredients together minus the feta.  Before serviing on crositini, I spread each slice with goat cheese, then topped with the tomato mixture.  I got lazy and didn't chop the tomatoes finely enough - will make sure to do that next time - delicious!

Simply delicious!  So easy to make and when used as a bruschetta topper, this is a quick and impressive party dish! I used fresh basil and let sit for 6 hours before spooning on top of lightly oiled bruschetta pieces that then baked at 350 for 6 minutes.  Even my 4-year-olds were raving!

Omg. I put this on top of portobello mushrooms and baked them. Absolutely amazing! Spread the leftover bit on crackers and was equally delicious. Made it exactly as written, and will make it again and again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

WOW!  This is fantastic.  I got lucky and found sun dried tomatoes that were already sliced thin in a jar with herbs.  Look for those if you can find it and many of the users who suggested putting this on chicken in the oven...they are SPOT ON!  Makes a nice baked chicken dish with Pesto (if you prefer) spread on top for additional color/presentation.

I really liked this tapenade.  I made just 1/2 the recipe and it was plenty.   A little goes a long way on a cracker.  Also was nice on french bread.  I was a little low on Feta but I do not think the flavour suffered too much.  I used fresh basil as i had some on hand and just blended all in a mini food processor.  Easy!

To Corrine... the recipe is calling for finely chopped "sweet red pepper" not dry hot crushed red peppers.  Also, I use seasoned sundried tomatoes in oil(basil,garlic,oregano etc.) .  This recipe has a very intense and distinct flavour but it is not hot with spicy heat.

This was ok.  I've made it 2x.  The 2nd time I used kalmata olives instead of feta.  I much prefered it.  Also added a pepper.  Definately needs a night in the fridge before serving.  I like my tapenade pureed.  Even with more olive oil, it was the consistency of a sandwich spread.  It gets better with time.  And, as expected, very stable in the fridge.  You should have a jar on hand.  It make quite a lot.

This is really delicious and super easy. Makes a great topping for a simple salad or chilled veggies like roasted beets.

This is a new favorite of mine....I love the way all the flavors meld together!  The only change I personally made is I switched the feta cheese to a Parmesano Reggiano.  No one in my family is a fan of feta.  It gives it an interesting nuttiness.  Don't use the canned stuff for this, buy a wedge at the store and grate the amount you need.  I love that I can make just enough for my husband and I....definitely a keeper!

Very strong but ever so tasty flavours in this tapenade. I made it as part of a starter for a Valentine's Day meal and served it with Ciabatta bread.

I made this one and the Kalamata Olive Tapenade (also AR) for a party. This was hands-down the favourite. Everybody love it. Served it with slices of white and whole-grain baguettes.

This smelled great after letting sit over night, but when spread very thinly on toasted Italian bread slices it was so spicy that we couldn't finish the small amount.  I didn't have finely chopped crushed red pepper, just the typical crushed red pepper.  If there's ever the occasion to make this again, I will cut the portion of the crushed red pepper to 1tbp, or less.  It was a real bummer that we couldn't enjoy this.  Now I have to figure out something else to do with abundance of the tapenade I have left.

Made as directed except for substituting fresh basil. The taste was too sweet for me so I added a can of chopped black olives. My husband and family loved it as prepared, but next time I will add kalmata olives.

I made this six hours in advance, and then baked it on top of chicken.  I cooked mine at 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes.  It tasted fabulous and my husband commented on how much he liked the way it turned out.  I think this would be great for a bruschetta topping as well.

What an outstanding recipe.  I didn't have any red pepper, so omitted it.  I also added in a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.  Pureed it smooth and spread on crusty bread.   Simply stunning!  I'll definitely use this recipe again and again.
