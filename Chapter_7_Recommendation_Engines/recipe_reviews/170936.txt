These were wonderful. My husband quickly proclaimed these as "the only way I ever want to eat shrimp from now on." Since it was about 10 degrees with a windchill below zero on the day I made these, I opted to use my oven. I put them in at 350 for about 10 minutes to sweat the bacon, then finished them under the broiler to crisp the bacon and cook the shrimp through. I'll definitely be making these again. Next time I'll be putting more jalapeno in each one for a little more spice. That's so easy to vary with this recipe. Thanks for a keeper!

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did everyone else I made it for! I was kind of worried that it would be too difficult or time consuming but not at all. I used peppered bacon too and would definately recommend it. Also, to cut back on time I used jarred jalepenos instead. Not too hot and a keeper in our home!!!

Wow! What a twist to a Texas favorite/ staple. This is the only way I will prepare bacon wrapped shrimp from now on.Thick sliced black peppered bacon is delish as well. You may have to scrape off some of the pepper to taste if it is too peppery.

These were awesome. My husband and I made them for a winter party, so we skipped the grill and used the broiler. They were gobbled up in minutes. Can't wait to try them on the grill in the summer!

I will make these again, but with the following changes: Use large shrimp so that it does not over cook before bacon is done. Use regular slice bacon and slightly pre-cook in the microwave so you can still manipulate it around the shrimp.  I used monterey jack with pepper cheese, and it melted all over the place and did not stay within shrimp and bacon - the feta did the same.  So, right when I took it off the grill, I slid a chunk of cheese onto toothpick so that it sat on top of meat. These are as good cold as they are hot.

These were fun to prepare and made a phenomenal presentation on the plate. I used what I consider to be medium shrimp (26/30) and thought the jalepeno slivers, cheese, and bacon overwhelmed the shrimp flavor a bit - the shrimp also was overcooked by the time the bacon finished, so in the future I'll use larger shrimp. I also substituted pepperjack cheese slivers for the feta, as I wanted a meltier cheese that didn't crumble all over my grilltop, and will stick with that substitution in the future. Something I'd reach for to wow company with, on the grill or in the broiler - thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  I used the peppered bacon as others suggested.  I also used the cubed feta instead of the crumbled; it was easier to slice and place inside the shrimp.  Some of it did fall out while grilling, but not too bad.  This is a repeat in our house for sure!!!!

These sounded great with all the great reviews, I had to make them. I used extra large shrimp, but it was still hard to fit the feta and pepper slivers in. Also, trying to wrap and skewer them was a difficult task. Took FOREVER to put them together. Grilled them, but shrimp were tough by the time the bacon was cooked. Edible, but would not say they were anything to brag about. I have no idea what I did wrong, but would never make them again. Too much work for the end result.

Delicious!!!!  Easy prep and great combination of flavors.  I sprinkled on a little paprika mixed with chili powder for a little kick!!! I will make these again.

My husband is a huge Chargers fan & since this is the 1st time they've made it in the playoffs in years I wanted to fix appetizers to watch the game. I followed the recipe to a T. In reading the reviews and ppl talking about the cheese melting out and bacon not cooking, I butterflied the shrimp, cooked the bacon to about half way done. I stuffed the shrimp with the cheese put the sliver of jalapeño over the cheese then wrapped the bacon around the shrimp. I put the toothpicks to where the shrimp couldn't lay on its side. I put my in the oven. Cooked for 7 mins then broiler on low for 2 mins. Nothing over cooked and bacon was crisp.

Very good--people were fighting over the last one.  They did take a lot of work--I precooked the bacon in the microwave. However, I think next time I will take the advice of others and use the precooked bacon that you buy at the store.  I will definitely be making these again.

I used jumbo 15-20 count shrimp and regular bacon, chunk feta and jarred jalapeños. Deveining and butterflying the shrimp made plenty of room for cheese and pepper. Found that slicing bacon LENGTHWISE made them easier to wrap. No leakage but grilling time was almost an hour.  We loved them but the messy prep and long cooktime may make them rare around here!

I pre cooked the bacon a little and used my broiler because it was raining outside. We  added avocado to the tooth pick after it was finished. Soooo yummy, my husband loves it!

I've made these a few times and they Were great... Smaller shrimp were harder to stiff but I found blending the jalapeños and feta make a great little paste that worked awesome for stuffing the shrimp.

These were the biggest hit at my dinner party.  Even was asked for the recipe.  Delicious!
