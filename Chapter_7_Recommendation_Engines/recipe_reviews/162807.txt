I did a pared down, lighter-on-the-calories version of this and it was spectacular. I used 1 tbsp of olive oil supplemented with olive oil cooking spray rather than the peanut and sesame oils. I left out the cornstarch and just cooked the pork in the olive oil. I didn't have broccoli, so I used a green pepper, a red pepper, and an onion, all sliced. Oh, and I had 1.5 pounds of pork tenderloin, so I used it all. 

I left the sauce unchanged (except used splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar); it is delicious as written. My husband loved it even though he doesn't normally like sweet foods, and our three male guests raved about it.

I served it with a basic fried rice (3 cups cooked white rice, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons each of soy sauce and rice vinegar, all fried up together with olive oil).

OH MY GOSH!  This sauce is to die for!  I used pork, but you could use beef or chicken or shrimp just as well.  Veggie selection is unlimited too!  I used green, red and yellow bell pepper, a handful of frozen green peas, yellow onion, chopped celery, drained water chestnuts and bean sprouts.  You could also use mushrooms, baby corn, carrots, and of course, broccoli (as the recipe calls for).  The sauce is the key!  Served over fried rice â€“ YUMMMM!  Thank you, Jenny G.!

I made this as written and it was really yummy.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I will add some more veggies though.  I was given advice on the Recipe Exchange to use a cheese grater to "chop" the ginger after you peel it and it worked great.  Thank you for the recipe!

The flavors of this dish are great, but it's pretty heavy on the soy sauce. I halved it and still needed to add a little water at the end to mellow it out (almost took the rating down to a 3, but I think this recipe idea is worth keeping, so I'm being generous). The hoisin and ginger are awesome, plus I added black pepper and some chili flakes. I used a raw stir-fry mix of broccoli, carrots and snow peas. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Different and delicious.  Because other reviewers mentioned that this recipe was quite sweet, I used a little less applesauce and added about a tablespoon of rice vinegar.  Zucchini, red onion, and mushrooms were the veggies I used and I served the stir fry over ramen noodles (cooked without the flavoring packet). The flavor combination of the sauce tasted like spicy Oriental apple butter.

Pretty tasty, but VERY sweet. Next time I'll make it without the applesauce and/or cut back on the sugars.

This was quite tasty. I had some snow peas I wanted to use up so I subbed those for the broccoli and also added  bit of cabbage. I used brown sugar splenda in the sauce and left out the apple sauce. I added a whole diced apple to the dish instead. It wasn't too sweet this way at all. I think I may even add moer apple next time as the mixture of apple and pork was very good. I served this over shirataki noodles

Great recipe for the the whole family. I added a chopped onion, half a green bell pepper, sliced, 1 can each of bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, drained. I doubled the ingrediants for the sauce to compensate for the extra veggies. My husband and kids raved throughout dinner. They were all shocked to find out that it had applesauce in the recipe. Will fix again.

An excellent pork stir-fry - thanks for the recipe, Jenny G! Neither the ginger nor the hoisin is overly strong, and the applesauce gives the sauce just the right touch of sweetness. Very easy to prepare (even for a kitchen "mechanic" like me!) and everyone loved it. I can see where this would lend itself to all sorts of additions to help make it a real one-dish meal.

Stellar! It's always refreshing when an adventurous cook introduces an unexpected ingredient into a recipe. The result: mouth wow. This was a great dish, and I would not change anything about it. Hard to mess with perfection. Thanks Jenny!

Update:  I have made this recipe 4 times now, and it's great every time. LOVE the applesauce.  I would have never thought to use it.

Yum!  I didn't have any hoisin sauce, but I made some using cashew butter instead of peanut butter; used tamari instead of soy sauce; and used canola oil instead of peanut oil (all changes due to hubby's dietary restrictions).  It took me longer than the recipe said to get the pork hot enough, but I think I may have not cooked it long enough the first round.  Served this mixed up with rice noodles.  We have a new "comfort food"!

This was good but not great. I couldn't taste the apple which was disappointing. I even put extra applesauce in. The hoisin and ginger flavors took over but it was still good.

Made this with a few changes. Used less meat and added more vegetables in addition to the broccoli, namely an onion and red pepper. Tasty and will make again.

Yummy! The applesauce gives it a unique twist on the usual homemade stir-fry. I used flour instead of cornstarch and only 4 tablespoons of soy sauce and I added some carrots, all pretty minor, and it was very tasty. Chicken could be used instead of pork, and of course, any crispy veggies could be added or used instead of the broccoli, and I'm sure it would still be very good.

In a word - "Delicious!" Only addition was that I sauteed some sliced carrots, bean spouts and snow peas with the broccoli. It made for a very full serving over Basmati rice. Thanks for the keeper Jenny!

UPDATE- The second time I made this, I realized that I had forgot to put the soy sauce into the sauce the first time. I liked it much better without the soy sauce- it makes the sauce much darker with a salty undertone. It was OK, but not nearly as good as the first time when I left it out. I have revised my rating to reflect this. 5 stars without the soy sauce- 3 stars with it. 





FIRST RATING (made without soy sauce): This recipe may be simple and quick but it's just delicious! The sauce is probably the easiest stir fry sauce I have ever made but it is also the best with wonderful texture, flavor and coverage. The only change I made was to add salt and pepper to the meat before cooking it but that is minor. I had some carrots on hand so chopped them into a fine julienne and served this dish over basmati rice. It will certainly be something I make again in the future. Thanks so much!

I really wanted to like recipe but I was disappointed. It could be that I am just not a hoisin fan. I found the sauce heavy and dark. Because my family liked this dish I've rated in the middle. Thanks anyway. It was fun to make.

I forgot to get apple sauce at the store so I just put a peeled red apple in the blender and used that.  The recipe turned out awesome!  In fact, my husband had to take some in a container for the road and he actually called me just to tell me how much he loved it!

I'll admit I was skeptical of the apple sauce in the stir fry sauce but it works! I didn't make the recipe exactly as written just because I doubled it and didn't have quite enough ginger, I added minced garlic, used 1.5 times the sugar and didn't quite double the soy sauce because I'm always scared of it being too salty. (My daughter says I must have a salt sensitivity!) I put a bit of cornstarch in with the sauce and just sautÃ©ed the pork in a little bit of canola oil without dredging it. I also added a squirt of siracha to the sauce. The heat was good with the sweet. Oh, and I added three sliced carrots. So, it's a versatile recipe. It was very yummy!

My entire family enjoyed this dish. The apple flavor is subtle, but gives the dish a fall flavor. Surprised though that it did not include garlic. Will have to try adding it next time.

Really good. Made it with brussels sprouts, carrots and mushrooms and stir fried with boiled ramen noodles like others suggested. I halved the soy sauce and halved the sugar.

Pretty good but I couldn't buy a plain tenderloin so I went with "apple bourbon" flavored because my only other option was teriyaki.  It was too flavorful for my taste but I'd like to try again because obviously it was my meat choice.  I toned down the sugar and soy as others suggested and used a bag of carrots, broccoli and snow peas.

Nice flavour. I decreased Soy Sauce to 4 Tbsp, used flour instead of cornstarch, used sesame & olive oil & used 2/3c of apple sauce. I also added a variety of colourful veggies (peppers, red onion, snow peas etc...)

I was really excited to make this recipe... it sounded delicious!  BUT.... just didn't care for it.  I found the soy sauce a bit overpowering, and just didn't like the flavor combination.  I did follow the recipe as written, other than adding onion and a yellow pepper, but didn't like the sauce.

Pretty sweet but very yummy.  Cut back brown sugar if you are using applesauce with any added sugar!  Mix the sauce and then just put the pork in the sauce while the other stuff cooks.  I used carrot (coins), celery (chopped) and didn't bother with the cornstarch coating on the pork.  I was out of asian oils so used olive oil...it was fine but I think the peanut/sesame oils would be best.

This was fantasic! I reduced the soy sauce to 4 tablespoons (I don't like too much salt in my food) but other than that I made as written. The sauce is to die for!

This was pretty, my husband loved it! Next time I'll probably use a little less of the oils (or just stick with olive oil) and maybe nix the cornstarch. When I made it, I used only 4 T. of the soy sauce because 6 seemed like so much, and it tasted fine. Still had plenty of saltiness to it. I served it over some white jasmine rice. Tasty!

My husband and Son really like it, I thought that it had too much ginger (I chopped it but did not measure it...maybe that is why).  I did not used broccoli because it is not our favorite veggie so I used carrots instead.  I will fix again though.

This recipe was fabulous...and easy since I used left over pork roast. I added 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger (instead of using fresh) and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, both to the sauce. Enjoyed by all!

This is a great recipe!  I used pork tenderloin instead of just loin and it was so tender.  My hubby was disappointed when it was all gone - he'd been taking it for lunch.  Next time I'll make more and see how it freezes.  BTW, I did cut back on the sugar and used Splenda, it worked very well.

I just finished this for dinner, and it was sooo good!  I threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms and some sliced onion. Okay, okay, I made some other changes, but I donâ€™t feel they compromised the original recipe. Because I donâ€™t eat pork,  I used sliced boneless chicken breast; I whisked  1.5 tsp. of ground ginger  into the sauce (I had no fresh ginger); and I grated one Cortland apple into the sauce in place of the applesauce, which I also didnâ€™t have.  And let me say one thing about velveting chicken with cornstarch, which I had never done before:  do itâ€”it made the most tender chicken I have ever eaten.   Try this recipe as is or with these changes, and you wonâ€™t be disappointed.  So good!

My husband and I both loved this dish. Is definitely a unique take on oriental flavors. A bit salty for me but unsure if it was this dish or the Asian quinoa I had with it. I used a mix of broccoli, baby carrots, and snap peas for veggie variety. Will make again and probably throw in some water chestnuts and mushrooms next time.

I was skeptical about making this but I am glad I did.  I used unsweetened apple sauce and didn't find it overly sweet as did some other reviewers.  I did add a bit of garlic too.  It was great,  nicely spiced and will be my go to sauce for stir-frying other things like chicken too.

I like this recipe a lot and do not think it is too sweet. I don't ever have hoisin sauce on hand so I have omitted it both times I've made it. (Maybe that's why it's not overly sweet) I also grate my ginger instead of chop it. I think it helps the ginger dissolve into the dish so you don't bite into pieces of ginger (yuck), you just get a nice ginger flavor throughout the sauce. I like the applesauce in the sauce as a thickener, so I didn't have to thicken it with any cornstarch.

I like sweet sauces, but because a lot of reviews said it was too sweet, I cut back on the brown sugar. All I had was homemade sweetened applesauce, so I cut back on the applesauce too. It was still pretty sweet. I would definitely use unsweetened applesauce if I made this again. I added a little water to make up for the applesauce, and also soy sauce, that I cut back on. I added onion and minced garlic with the ginger and also added some carrots. I sprinkled with some red pepper at the end. The applesauce gives it a different texture, but it wasn't unpleasant, just different. It made a nice meal. I liked it but don't know that I'll make it again.

I was hoping to really like this, but it didn't do so well in our house. The applesauce added an odd texture.. it was also a bit too sweet for us.

I really liked this!  The sauce has great flavor.  It's not as good as Chinese food in a restaurant, but it's the best stir fry I've made at home so far.  It made a lot of sauce, which we love.  I used tofu instead of pork and only 1/2 a pound, so I added more broccoli.  Also had to use 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger because the store was out of fresh, and only 3 tablespoons soy sauce which was plenty for our tastes.  I'm glad I ran across this recipe because I'll definitely make it again!

Good, but I thought it was more salty than sweet.  Very adaptable recipe, we're going to make it a little differently.  More garlic, veggies next time.

So nice to have a stir-fry with a new taste.  My husband loved the hint of ginger on the broccoli and I think the 15yo love this...he was too busy gobbling it down.  He did nod briefly as he said "keep" when I asked his opinion on saving the recipe.  The 10yo picky eater just picked out the meat.  Sigh.  But this was fast and easy (like all stir-fries) and delightfully yummy.

I LOVED this and so did my family. I made it a little different though. No cornstarch, I had a pre-crockpot(ted) piece of pork that I shredded then heated in some veggie oil, added some frozen veggies, let that sit for about 10 minutes then added the stirred up sauce. Served over brown rice. Delicious. Normally I have to add spice (cayenne etc) to dishes but this was very tasty. Will definitely make again.

It was fabulous! My son - super picky 2 year old - even loved it. I used pork tenderloin and it was ... well... tender. I used a mix of many veggies too. And used unsweetened applesauce - not sure I'd change anything the next time I made it. It was a hit and a nice break from chicken in stirfries.

Fantastic. Loved it and will make it again. I made my own applesauce versus commercial type and I didn't add any sugar. I added more vegetables as suggested, specifically red onion and mushrooms. Easy recipe

This is great after a little tweaking. I omitted the brown sugar and soy sauce and used 1/4 c. Thai sweet soy sauce (available from a SE Asian market), 1 T. minced garlic, 1 small onion cut into 1 inch strips, 1 t. red pepper flakes and 1/4 t. black pepper. Also I used unsweetened apple sauce. Really good!

My family loved this.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  Also, I added water chestnuts.  Needed a bit more soy sauce after serving, though.
