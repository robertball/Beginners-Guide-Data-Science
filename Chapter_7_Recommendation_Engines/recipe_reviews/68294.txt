Great recipe, I made one addition using a can of frozen limeade concentrate. So   I used the 2 cups of lime vodka, 2 liters of 7-up and then used one can of limeade concentrate mixed together and then lastly added lots of lime sherbet and an equal amount of  vanilla ice cream and allowed to float on top...it was a HUGE hit...everyone asked for the recipe.

This simple, easy recipe was a BIG hit at our New Year's Day Party.  The recipe lacks instructions, however.  Exactly how does  one "add ice cream and sherbet"?  Should they be softened? sliced frozen solid? scooped?  I opted to put scoops of the sherbet and ice cream in the bottom of the punch bowl and then add the vodka and soda.  This made quite the "foam bath", ok because the bowl was large enough, but something to be aware of.  No matter, it will be served again.

This punch was delicious as well as a pretty green color!  I made it for my sister-in-law's bridal shower and it was gone!  I am making it again for Christmas Eve.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic punch! Other than the excess foam, which can be avoided by putting in the soda first THEN the ice cream and sherbet, this is so easy and yummy. I've been making it for years, thanks to this post, and will for years to come. I add fresh lime and lemon slices, just to make it pretty.
