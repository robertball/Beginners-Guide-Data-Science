I've made this recipe but with 12 ounces of beer, tequila and water in addition to the limeade for an "on the rocks" margarita.  It's the best!

This is the same recipe my friend served to us on "Girls night out". It's so very good and so easy. I have served it to my guests and they could not believe there was beer in it and has only three ingredients. Good, quick and easy, what more could you ask for...
I used this recipe for our "mexican night" and my brother made the authentic triple sec, lime juice, tequila margarita and everyone like these much better. I did use the lime to moisten the rim of the glass before the salt. I have been even keeping the leftovers in the blender glass in the freezer and whenever I want a margarita, I just pop it back on the blender base and enjoy one anytime.

These are just as good as what you would get in a restaurant. However I found that they had a bitter aftertaste. I tried adding some sugar but it didn't help. It might be because of the beer I used (Stella Artois) or because I was a little short on ice cubes (by almost a cup). I'll definitely be trying these again but with more ice and a different type of beer.

What's not to like? I am not sure if it is psychological or not, but Corona beer works best!

We made these for our cinco de mayo party this year and they were FABULOUS.  Everyone loved them and they were quite strong, which was exactly what we were looking for.  They were also very easy to make and much less expensive than traditional margaritas, I'll make these again and again.

These margaritas are delicious, but a warning; they are very strong. Twelve ounces of alcohol in two admittedly large servings is a lot.

When I read the recipe, I wasn't sure about the beer. You certainly don't taste it in the finished product.  Sure tastes great!!!

We make this every fourth of July in a large punch bowl, no messy blender cleanup! We use Tecate Beer, it is a perfect blend. It is always a huge hit.

We had these over memorial day weekend. The beer drinkers in the gang really liked them, especially since they weren't sweet. The pina coloda drinkers didn't like them at all. We used our margarita machine to make then because it's really easy. I personally thought they could use a little more pizzaz as they seemed a little bland.

Excellent!  I'm not sure WHY you need to make it with beer, but it's certainly tasty.  And I don't even like beer!  We had this for Super Bowl, and it was very well received.  I'd definitely make it again.

Got this recipe over 25 yrs ago and regularly make it for a refreshing summer cooler at my cottage on the lake.  Use 6 oz. froz. limeade, 6 oz. tequilla, 6 oz. beer, put in blender, fill up with ice and grind away.

If you don't like frozen margaritas, you can always thaw the limeade and add a can of water.  Pour all the ingredients in a pitcher and they are ready to go!

This margarita is deffinetly one of my most favourite drinks, aside from pina coladas. I would give this 10 stars, but there are only 5. great for family outings,picnics, or just for fun. This is simple and wuick and fun. its a margarita with a twist. you dont have to salt the glasses or use the lime. frozen lemonade is good too.  shake in a blender and voila.   use  souza tequila and perferably german beer.

Very good recipe! As suggested by another user I added orange juice to cut the sour and it worked very well. Only problem I had was that our store was out of limade so I had to use frozen margarita mix. Will definitely try again with limade as the recipe states I bet it'll be even better!

We made these last evening and have to say we were not crazy about the results, I agree I did not taste the beer at all but the limeaide was a bit overwhelming. I added some frozen strawberries which helped some but probably would not make this recipe again.Thanks for sharing I am always looking for a new recipe and can say by the reviews I am in the minority.

My husband and I love margaritas, however, he likes the "topshelf" margarita and I like the originals on the rocks.  We both enjoyed this recipe, but I did find it a bit too sweet for my taste.  It was easily remedied with a little water.  Very tasty on a warm day!!

A little but runny if you don't drink them up really fast :).  Of course I probably wouldn't have even noticed if I had a straw!  Great recipe.

Very tasty! Used Corona and added some Triple Sec. Yummmm! Just a side note: I used the margaritaville to make it and there was no enough room in the pitcher to make it a frozen drink. Cut the serving size to 1 so you can make it a frozen margarita. It will require slightly more work, but the consistency will be much better!

Did not change a thing, it was perfect.
So perfect that people formed a line when ever I made a fresh batch.
I bought for two extra servings, and I ran out FAST !!!

Best drink I have tried in along time.
And it does not hurt that you can tell the manly man who does not belive in drinks that don´t come out of a can that it has beer in it.
