This was really good, and differnt. I used more mayo, probably 1/2 cup and toasted the walnuts for more flavour. A great side salad. Thanks!

Made this as part of a Russian themed dinner party.  This was by far the favorite salad of guests.  Based on another recipe I found, I did add 1/2 cup of diced prunes.  I know it sounds odd, but it was really wonderful.

I make something like this myself, but I add a touch of lemon juice and some craisins. I've used almond slivers and raw unsalted cashews because we like them better than walnuts. The cashews were especially good.

awesome recipe! I was looking for an easy salad to take to a potluck, and this was definitely easy and delicious.  Only change I made was to add a little fresh dill.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is good. I seasoned it with salt and pepper. I like the texture of the walnuts. Next time I will forgo the garlic and add golden raisins.

I love the garlic twist to this salad.  Very refreshing.  I know it is better if it sits over night, but we ate it all in one day.  Ended up adding crasins too.

Really, really good!  A nice change from regular slaw.  I was looking for a quick, simple side dish for dinner last night.  Wasn't sure if I would like the combination, but it really works!  Great way to get more veggies! Thanks!

Eh, I didn't care much for this. By itself (Made exactly as recipe stated) it was pretty bland, and not too good. I had to add a LOT of salt, pepper, lemon juice and dill leaves to make it only a little better!

Looking to use up a lot of carrots and make a salad for my MIL I came across this recipe a few weeks ago.  I chopped the carrots in my food processor rather than shred them and I toasted the walnuts.  
My MIL liked the salad and that is what I was hoping for.  Thanks Chandley for sharing your recipe.

Five stars for ease and tastiness.   I used half walnuts and half soaked raisins (ran out of the former).  Also used organic canola mayonnaise. I need a food processor though.  Took me a while to shred those carrots by hand.

I made this as written with the exception that I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. It was OK. Partway through eating yet, I added some raisins. That made it good. Then, for fun in the last few bites, I squeezed on some lime juice. That made it incredible. I will make this again!

This was very unusual and delicious!  Made as written and will make it again.  The submitter of this recipe, Chandley, said it can also be made with beets.  Would one use canned or raw fresh beets?  Thank you for any feedback!
