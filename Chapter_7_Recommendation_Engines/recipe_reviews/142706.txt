This was so much better than I thought it would be.  The flavors meld well together but not overpowering.  I served with warm pretzels.  This would be fabulous on vegetables, chicken, steak, really anything.

I liked it very much.  I had a very refined anchovy paste - I think I could have used a bit more.  Same with the Worcestershire sauce.  On the other hand, the mustard was a little too evident.  I made too much for one person, but I put the leftover into an ice cube container and deep froze it for the next piece of meat.

This butter is a staple with our Christmas dinner, served with fresh pretzel rolls.  The only thing that I have changed is that I have replaced the Dijon mustard with stone ground mustard, which provides a more distinct flavor.  I have to normally quadruple the recipe, due to how popular it is.  If anyone feels turned off by the anchovy paste, don't be!  It provides a deep umami with absolutely no fish flavor.
