I made this for dessert on Christmas day for the family. Everyone loved it, overall rating was 8.5 out of 10.  A couple of people thought it could be a bit more moist, although I didn't agree, I thought it was perfect. Some thought it would be even better with a dollop of whipped cream. I used a mix of Granny Smith apples and Honey Crisp Apples and used Vietnamese cinnamon (my favorite). I will definitely make it again, thanks for the recipe!  I didn't have a big enough pan so I made two cakes with what I had and it worked out well.

I am giving this 5 stars on the aroma alone! It is still in the oven, but man it smells delicious! 
Going to update after lunch. I will definitely be saving room for dessert!

It’s a bit too oily, & WAY-too sweet -
Even tho i cut the sugar from 2.5 C total to 2 C, one in the topping, 1 in the cake batter, the cake is too, too sweet.

I will make it again, but next time, 3/4 C of olive oil & 3/4 C of applesauce in place of the remaining oil, should correct the “greasy” mouth-feel,
& I will also cut the sugar again - 1 C in the topping, 1/2 C in the cake batter. // I also used 1/4 C snipped prunes [no raisins on hand], & those taste great.
I added 2 tsp of apple-cider vinegar to the topping, to balance the sweet, & that worked fine, plus i used ONLY brown sugar in the topping, & white in the cake.

Overall, it’s tasty; a bit too oily, a bit too sweet, but good, nonetheless. :—)   I am sure it will all be eaten!
