I loved these! I am from Arkansas and had never heard of them until now but I am glad I discovered them when I did. EXCELLENT! To us, they tasted like the kernels in a batch of popcorn that didn't pop all the way. You know, "half pops". ...

Living in the state of GA, we were visiting various sightseeing activities in the area. We had stopped at a local store to get something to drink and I purchased a small bag of what was referred to as fresh deep fried peanuts and we really liked those. This recipe reminds us so much of those those that the family requests them on the weekends for the snack during the family movie time along with the candy and soda. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
