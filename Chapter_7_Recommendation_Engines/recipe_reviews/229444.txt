I tried this recipe and found it to be very tasty. The combination of spices and herbs, while hard to imagine as being tasty, was indeed an excellent combination. I watched the video, which had some extra info, such as, add a fair amount of salt, as fresh veggies tend to absorbe a lot of it. Also, plain paprika would not do the trick. The smoked paprika, which many may not have in their pantry, was key. The cayenne on top of the ricotta was another bit of zip that really made it a good recipe. I put it all in my iron skillet, which may have helped it to bake just right!

A very disappointing recipe. I did not care for the mix of flavours. I might try something similar again, but with basil instead of mint (I find it goes much better with zucchini) and I would have to play around with the other spices as well.

I chose to make this recipe despite the reviews.I, like some other cooks, put my own spin on it.I prepared the zucchini by salting and then  tossing in olive oil, 4 cloves of crushed garlic, fresh minced basil. While I Baked the zucchini in oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes , I blended Parmesan cheese with the ricotta cheese. After the 15 minutes I pulled the zucchini from the oven, sprinkled a bit of grated Parmesan in zucchini, then spooned and somewhat spread the ricotta cheese mixture on top and baked for another 30 minutes.It was fabulous!
Definitely a keeper....

I thought this zucchini-ricotta casserole was absolutely delicious. I find zucchini hard to love--so watery and bland-- but this was rich, creamy, and flavorful. Make sure you bake it until the ricotta is browned and the zucchini is soft. Next time I'm going to drizzle a little olive oil over the cheese before I bake it. Yum, yum, yum and healthy, too! Thank your, chef John.

Between the ricotta, smoked paprika, and cayenne, I was ready for a flavor explosion.  Sadly, it didn't happen.  The only substitution I made was dried mint for fresh (w/the appropriate adjustment).  This just didn't work for us.  The mint was overpowering.  It was ok, just not a dish I'll make again.  It's def worth trying (particularly paired w/a greek flavored meat!) for yourself, though.  Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!

This is a dish that has great potential. I used a lemon flavored olive oil, yellow squash and omitted the mint. I let this cook a good 35 minutes in the hot oven before I even opened the oven door. When I pulled it from the oven the cheese was deliciously browned and the squash triangles were roasted to perfection. I served it over a diagonally sliced chicken breast with my home grown thyme. Be creative. You know what your mouth likes and this dish was a pleasant surprise.

I made this as written except I added an extra half cup of ricotta.  Sorry, but it was extremely bland.  It would probably be better with some parmesan and butter.

Delicious, the mint was different and very nice. Added some cooked, shredded chicken, two breast pieces, and doubled the ricotta.  Turned a side dish into a scrumptious main course.

I found this idea for zucchini interesting and learned about roasting at the high temp to prevent the soggy mush that it can turn into.  I also subsituted basil for the mint. The dish was a big hit at a family dinner. Our oldest son who never eats zucchini tried it and said that was the only zucchini he has tried that he really liked.

Very easy and tasty. I just used one large zucchini and loved the angle cut shown in the video.  I did not use mint and did not have cayenne pepper on hand and it tasted excellent. The texture came out very soft and each bite with the ricotta was mouth watering.  Next time I will add squash and cherry tomatoes. We enjoyed this as an appetizer.

Unimpressive! Made exactly like recipe. Mint was not a good addition in my opinion. It definitely needed more spice to give it some kick. Threw out the leftovers.

I made this recipe and it was just okay.  I've made better zucchini casseroles in the past.  I thought it had too much garlic.  I did add some other cheeses to it...don't think I'll add this one to the rotation.  The only reason I made it was because I had all of the ingredients on hand.

Really freaking tasty! I may add some parmesan to this next time, since that seems like a great addition. This is definitely a crowd-pleaser - even those who claim to not like zucchini will really enjoy this dish. This will definitely be on regular rotation!
