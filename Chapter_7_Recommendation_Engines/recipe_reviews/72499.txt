Eh, I'm on the fence about this one.  While eating my piece, some bites I thought it was good, other bites I thought it wasn't so good.  My favorite flavor was the cinnamon frosting (I made homemade frosting), but I also thought the frosting made it too sweet.  The "cake" is still in the fridge, and nobody's gone back for a second piece since we had it a few days ago.  It was OK, but I don't think we'll have it again.

I made some changes.  I made the pudding as directed on box for pie filling, added nutmeg and did not add whipped topping to it.  Layered that with cinnamon graham crackers, pudding, apple pie filling as stated.  for top I made cinnamon whipped cream with whipped topping and a pinch of cinnamon.  Kids liked it and it wasn't as sweet as it would have been with frosting.
