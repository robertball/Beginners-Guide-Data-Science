These are quite tasty!!  I had to give them a 4 star for now just because the filling was a might too sweet for my taste--even though most of the others tasting these enjoyed them as they were.   I will definitely make them again but decrease the amount of powdered sugar by at least 1 cup.   I tested them before freezing and after.   Much better after they have been frozen--The texture and flavors are better.   I used parchement paper as a liner for the baking pan with great results. This allowed me to bake one cake, pull it right out of the pan onto a cooling rack and then bake the second 1/2 of the cake portion of the recipe--since I only have one jelly roll pan at this time.   I like the idea from Kathy W's review to use them as a shortcake base.

OMG!! This was delish! We were having friends over for dinner and I saw this recipe and decided to try it. Everyone loved it. I didn't change anything to the recipe itself but we had strawbwerries in our garden that were ripe and ready to pick so I used the twinkie as the base for strawberry shortcake.  Very good but very fattening! Thanks Tyler I will make this again and again!

I only used 4 oz cream cheese and 2 oz butter to 4 cups of icing sugar, I was concerned about it tasting too cheesy. I used 2 recipes of stabilized whipped cream for the Cool Whip. The Twinkies were good, very rich, the kids loved it. 
*Next time, 2 oz cream cheese, 2 oz butter and 2 1/2 cups icing sugar to 8 oz stabilized whipped cream, instead of 16 oz.*

I made these for valentines day for my kids so I cut into heart shapes using a cookie cutter. They were very easy to make. and the filling is so yummy! I did cut the filling recipe in half as other reviewers said there was too much. I did still have some left over, but maybe next time I'll pipe more in. I will be making these again. I like the fact they held the cookie cutter shapes well! can't wait to try other shapes for different holidays! Thanks for a great recipe. I don't know who likes them more the adults or the kids!

OMG!  These were such a hit at my party!!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  You can freeze any unused filling and use it in other recipes later.

Since I baked these as pseudo "Twinkies" in a mini loaf pan (8 ct. - baked for 18 minutes) and "Sunny Doodles" cupcakes (12 - baked for 15 minutes), I wanted these to taste as close to Twinkies as possible, I took the advice of "troysgrl" and omitted the cream cheese in the filling completely.  I also took the advice of others and cut the filling recipe in half.  It was way more than enough (too much!) to fill 12 cupcakes and 8 Twinkie-like little loaves.  The cake was spot on, though, and the filling delicious with the omission of the cream cheese.  Do let these get cold in the refrigerator before eating.  Thanks, Tyler, for a great base recipe.  I will try other variations in the future.

I would give this one 5 stars but it was way too much work for me.  Also, I ended up with too much filling that I had to throw away.  I think the filling mixture should be cut in half.  Other than that it was very, very good and I didn't change a thing.

I plan on getting the canoe style muffin or cupcake pans. Then instead of cream cheese I will use a pudding recipe that I use for "Pistachio Cake" icing. Any flavor pudding will work I think.

These are VERY good! It's been years since I've had a Twinkie but I thought the cake part was pretty darn close. The filling was a little too cream cheesey for us. As a matter of fact, my husband & son didn't even finish their pieces. My daughter & I loved them regardless. I'll be making them again!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!! I made the cake part just like the recipe said, but I made my own filling. I didn't want something so rich w/ the cream cheese and all. So I made my whoopie pie filling for the center. Fantastic!!!!!!

I make this cake ofte. I make a homemade yellow cake mix instead of using a box cake. I recently made cupcakes for my daughter to take to school out of this reipe (used regular butter cream frosting for decorating) and the teacher emailed me to ask if she could have the recipe.  If you make cupcakes you will get about 30. This recipe is excellent!!!

These were outstanding. I made them as cupcakes, taking a wedge out from the top, enlarging the hole  a bit and filled it with the filling. I then sliced a bit off the bottom of the section of the top I removed. This made it fit back into the hole better. To make the cupcake more attractive, I made a cream cheese frosting flavored with lemon for the top.

The filling is very sweet but sooo good. I was wanting to make cupcakes so I only made half the amount of filling. I still had quite a bit left over and it is too sweet to frost the whole cupcake with. So I added the remainder of whipped topping to the left over filling and piped that on the cupcakes - perfect. I also used chocolate cake and chocolate pudding mix.

I had a horrible time cooking the cake.  It burned the first time at 350 so I tried again at 290.  I don't think my oven is that much too hot and wonder how other people got it to work.  But they sure are tasty.

Wonderful! We loved them! I made 1 change which was to use real whipped cream instead of cool whip. I used about 6 oz then whipped it up and mixed into filling. I will say though, it definitely didn't need as much filling as I made. I had about a quarter of it left & I was pretty generous. I would probably make half or 2/3 as much filling. Oh and I went the cupcake route instead which wasn't hard. Bake them at 350 for 18-20 mins. Then I just cut the center out and filled it. And put the little piece of cake on top.

These are very good. Next time, I'll cut the sugar by at least a cup or more. Just a bit too sweet. Agree with all who liked them frozen!

What a hit!!! I haven't had a twinkie in years, I can't remember really how they taste. No need to buy and taste them with this recipe! Love it! Although, I did end up with way to much filling/frosting.....Thanks never the less!

MMMM!  I just made these (as cupcakes) for my daughter's -year birthday party.  I can't wait to serve these, they are so yummy.  Better tasting than the original Twinkies, with all the nostalgia.  I made a few changes to accomodate for cupcakes:  lower oven temp (325) and longer time.  As per others' suggestion, I halved the filling.  But it was too sugary that way so I added all 8 oz of whip cream.  I wanted filled cupcakes so I squirted the filling in each cakeI did not use to top the twinkie-cakes because I'm going to use decorating buttercream.  There was plenty of filling left over so I'm freezing it for a rainy day.

I have made several Twinkie substitute recipes prior to this. All were bombs. This is the very BEST recipe for twinkles I have found and the simplest! Made it yesterday for the first time and took it to the church campout. Boy, was it a hit. Following the advice of others, I cut the filling in half and it was perfect.

Very good!  The cake is worth the price of admission by itself!  My rating is for the recipe as written.  Leaving out the cream cheese would make it 5 stars.

We loved these. I made them as cupcakes and piped in the filling from the top with a little rosette of filling at the top and then sprinkled with red/green sugar for Christmas. I only used 1/2 the powdered sugar though and am very glad I did. They were perfect. They were good right away but a lot better the next day. Can't wait to try different flavors.

Wishing I could give this 10 stars...amazing! 
I made exactly as is, but I can see where other reviewers would cut back powdered sugar to maybe one cup.  But still, as is, it was incredible. The cake alone was awesome....
 

I did one goof through, wasnt thinking and put in two loaf pans instead.  Still turned out amazing~ stimply stacked loaf cakes and put a lot of filling in between- it was really really high, but was able to just slice thinner.   Had leftover filling and decided to freeze it since EVERYONE has asked for this again.

Yum!  This was delicious.  It was even better frozen.  My six kids ate this in no time.

I would have given 5 stars but filling was too sweet and even after cuttin in half as advised by others it was still too much, The cake was really great I used Strawberry cake mix and french vanilla pudding didn't have yellow cake mix on hand, it still came out good this is a keeper! also tastes better cold!

delicious but not sure if it's exactly like a twinkie.  I used 2 cups sugar and 4 oz cream cheese.  Could probably do with even less of those two

Fun recipe and very good!  I followed the directions for the cake part, but for the filling I made these adjustments:  instead of 8 oz cream cheese, I used half that amount;  I also only used 2 cups powdered sugar instead of 5;  I made cupcakes (24) instead of the two bigger cakes.  Many reviewers stated they had too much filling left over....I must have put a lot into my cupcakes because I only had a little bit of filling left that I set aside for the kids to use if they wanted an extra little dollop of flavor.  Freezing is definitely recommended.  Yum!!

It does taste like a Twinkie!  I made the cakes in two 9x13 casserole dishes and halved the frosting recipe as suggested, along with reducing the sugar by another half and left out the cream cheese.  It's still super sweet.  Definitely need to eat chilled or the filling gets too gooey.

I followed the recipe as written and used directions found elsewhere (http://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Hostess-Twinkie-Recipe/?ALLSTEPS) to make individual Twinkie-like cakes. The cake is good although doesn't taste too much like a Twinkie. For the frosting, I left out the cream cheese and decreased powdered sugar (to 3 cups). The frosting turned out very well (smooth and firm) although still too sweet for my liking, perhaps only 2 cups next time?

This recipe is awesome, I do use a little less sugar and the light version of the cream cheese, still works out great. I keep getting begged to bring this to the next party.

These were pretty good, but they are not like Twinkies.  Twinkies are filled sponge cake.  These are just filled regular cake.  That said, the filling is really good!  Next time I will look up a sponge cake recipe and use this as the filling.
instead of cutting the bottoms with a knife, I used a skewer and ream out a hole through the middle of the cake.  It worked pretty well and the bottom wasn't split all the way down.

This is a darn good dessert using a boxed cake mix.  I read through the reviews and followed the filling review by 'the4taals' using 4oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 4 c. powdered and I used 8 oz. whipped topping.  I lined the cookie sheets with Pam® sprayed parchment paper that I could lift out rather than flour.  Since the cake mixes are now smaller than the size listed in the recipe, I added 1/3 cup flour to the mix.  Once baked and cooled I used all the filling, and trimmed the edges before cutting in rectangles.  I flash froze them and then individually wrapped in plastic wrap.  They will make a nice treat for lunches.

This was perfect.  I found an actual hostess Twinkie maker so I needed a recipie to fill my new toy. This recipie made very good Twinkies. The only problem was with the piping bag. This icing did not go through the small, long tip very well. And with a big tip the Twinkies would sometimes tear. So maybe next time I will put less powderd sugar or some milk.
