This was quick and easy. It is a great summer time punch. Always well received. My husband really enjoyed it. I actually like it better using a pineapple concentrate and then using sparkling water to reconstitute it.

This is a great punch that can be made ahead of time, and so simple and easy that more can be made during a party on the fly if needed!

CORRECTION is needed for the ingredients list.  It says to use a 64 oz bottle of pineapple juice...but it should be listed as 46 oz of juice.

The ratio should be 3 parts juice to 1 part coconut rum.  I made this with 46 oz juice and 1.5 cups coconut rum so we would have a low alchohol drink for our occasional drinkers/social drinkers.  If you are making this for a "party" crowd, go ahead and use the 3:1 ratio, which would be 46 oz juice and 2 cups coconut rum.  For hard-core drinkers, just leave the cocunut rum bottle out and they can pour extra rum into their drink.  Delicious!

I've made this several times but also add pineapple sherbet and mix it all in the blend.  Makes it into a nice frozen drink.

Coconut rum & pineapple, what's not to LOVE? ? I used the 1/2 can of pineapple-banana juice I had from another adult summer sipper and this was just as Yummy! Thank you redheartz
