This was very very tasty. But i added fineley chopped almonds and honey to it while cooking. I also tried it with coconut milk and i also tried it with long brown rice. It could be a great vegan recipe if you use agave instead of honey! I think I will try that!   But i recommend this recipe. Its a great was to have a calcium rich breakfast and also get rid of your left over rice! :)

I needed a crowd pleasing dessert for my co-workers that have a variety of dietary concerns and tastes and this hit the spot. I added a tsp. of vanilla and more honey as I wanted a sweeter taste. This was the first time I've used almond milk and I loved this recipe as did everyone else. I'll keep this recipe handy and make again.

I liked this!  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and stirred in about 1 Tbsp. sugar (you could use honey too).  I like that it's a fast recipe, so when I get a craving I don't have to wait more than an hour for a traditional rice pudding.

Love this recipe! So fast and much healthier than most rice pudding recipes. I used brown rice and unsweetened almond milk so I added some honey maple agave and brown sugar while it was cooking. The toasted almonds are a nice touch. This recipe is so versatile so you can basically adapt it to your tastes. I'm sure it's even better with white rice so I'll definitely be making again!

This was really easy and yummy. It's a great way to use up leftover rice--and would make a great breakfast too.  I didn't have any honey, but added 1 T of sugar.  I added it to the milk/rice mixture before I nuked it.  I think a splash of vanilla would also be great.  So happy I stumbled across this recipe.

Very quick and easy.  I must admit though that I added 1/4 cup golden raisins and substituted 1/4 cup almond milk with heavy cream.  Also added about 1/4 teasp. nutmeg and 1 teasp. stevia.  AND I used leftover sushi rice that had rice vinegar and a little salt in it.  I guess your recipe was a good place to be creative, huh?

simple and yummy. great way to get some carbs in my increasingly picky eater...i added a bit of agave (to replace the honey) and a few drops of vanilla, but for me, i would have eaten it as is in the recipe. i also sprinkled some corn starch in there, thinking it wouldn't get thick enough (although, now, i'm sure it would have been plenty thick without it). thanks for sharing.

I made this with quinoa but it was the flavor that was lacking, even with adding vanilla extract.  Next time I will double the cinnamon and honey, and I might consider cooking with chunky, mashed bananas for a sweeter taste.  Also, I chopped the almonds and added them to the quinoa/rice with the other ingredients.

Very delicious.  But how could it not be?
