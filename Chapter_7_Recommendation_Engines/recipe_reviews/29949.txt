Just a note to those who couldn't get the breading to stay on. Put 2 Tbsps of mayonnaise into a bag along with the seitan and squeeze it around until seitan is coated. Dip into bread crumbs, then fry or bake. If you're a vegan, use one of the many eggless mayonnaise brands sold at health food stores like Trader Joe's and health food co-ops.

Awesome recipe. I was skeptical when it was cooking (it didn't smell that appetizing) but the taste was awesome. Both my husband, and my kids (ages 2 & 4) loved it. They boys particulary liked it with barbeque sauce and honey mustard. Hubby and I ate it as it. Go easy on the cumin, however, as it can be overpowering very quickly.

My only complaint is that the recipe didn't even come close to feeding 4. This was more like a serving for two. I doubled it, and the four of us ate every bite along with brown rice risotto and oven roasted vegetables.

Great veggiew entree!!

This is great! I just love Seitan and am so happy to have found a recipe that uses it. Not many people know about it who haven't been vegetarians for a while. It's nice a spicy, but not hot spicy and coats well. I put it on a bed of rice. Thank you for another yummy recipe Karla!

I made seitan today for the first time and wanted to make something with it that was not stir-fry (since I didn't want to wait on rice). This was fantastic! I was running low on soy sauce so I used Bragg's instead, and I only had about 1T of nutritional yeast so I just used all-purpose flour to make up the remainder of the 1/3C. I sliced the seitan into strips about 3/4" thick. The breading stayed on without any problems -- you have to get the oil hot enough is what I've found. My seitan was a little spongy so I was worried they would stay spongy, but nope, they fried up nice and crispy! I will definitely be making these again.

So good!  I used homemade seitans and did as some other reviewers suggested and doubled the nutritional yeast.  Instead of the tamari, I dipped the seitans in a mixture of Bragg's liquid aminos (practically the same thing, flavor-wise) and beaten egg to make the mixture stick better.  The finished product tasted like school cafeteria chicken fried steak (in a good way), so next time I'm going to make a gravy and mashed potatoes to go with it.  This is definitely the best breaded seitans recipe I've tried.

*I have since tried serving these with gravy and mashed potatoes, and they are really good.  To make a good chicken-fried-steak-style gravy for them, reserve the oil after cooking the seitans and just whisk in and cook 1/4 c. flour, add vegetable broth until the flour is wet enough to completely dissolve, and then add 4 cups milk.  Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook for about 7 minutes until thickened.  Season with kosher salt and pepper.

I followed the recipe exactly using my own homemade seitan and it was SO good!  Really, the best seitan recipe I've tasted.  Even my non-vegetarian husband liked it ... it definitely lives up to the "tasty" part of its name.

My daughter is a new vegetarian, and finding ingredients that have the texture
of meat, with a great taste has required some research and experimentation.
This has become our favorite. Thank you.

This doesnt taste good.  The recipe as is, all of the breading fell off into the pan.  I tried it again making in vegetarian as opposed to vegan by dipping it into an egg/milk wash. The breading held but it still wasnt right.  My mother said that it tasted like a no-name chicken nugget with additives.  I will not try this recipe again.

changed my rating from 4 to 5 because last time I tried it with tofu and this time seitan.  No comparison -it's amazing with seitan.  My husband's new favorite dish.  Oh yeah, cut all the seasonings in half for my kids.

Reminded me of soy sauce pork chops. The taste was good. Only reason I gave this 4 stars was because the tamari was overpowering. Next time I would like to mix with equal parts tamari and water.

This was very yum, although I did have a few differences.  One, I used egg/milk before I dipped in breading as I am not vegan and I think it might stick better with the egg and milk mixture.  Also, I used bread crumbs rather than nutritional yeast (although I seasoned it exactly the same.)  Finally, I probably had more oil in the pan than a measly 2 tblspoons (I had about an 1/8-1/4 inch in the bottom of the pan).  As someone else said, it tastes a lot like 'chicken fried steak. We used "Sweet Earth" seitan and it stayed quite juicy and tender inside the very crispy and light breading.  All in all a WIN WIN!

Awesome! Our first foray into seitan and we LOVED it! We made a couple of small changes. Nutritional yeast at our health food store was very expensive so used Italian bread crumbs, but still added the other spices. Followed other reviewers' suggestion to mix with mayo but added soy sauce to it for flavor. Finally, added cornstarch and black pepper to package broth for a sauce. Served over brown rice with a salad. Thanks for sharing!!

We thoroughly enjoyed each and every bite. I took someones suggestion and put egg into the tamari sauce. The breading stayed together nicely. I also added onion powder and cayenne powder to the breading mix.

I recently watched a cooking show that featured seitan.  I had never tried it, but thought I would test it out and see how my family liked it.  My kids and husband all thought it tasted pretty good.  (They all said they would prefer chicken cooked this way, but they liked this too.)  All have rejected tofu and other soy meat replacements.  Thanks for a tasty way to introduce to seitan.

For what it is, this is a GREAT recipe.  Tasty, easy, and makes the outside of the seitan crispy, almost like fond on beef.  My gripe is that it's not like breading.  I wanted something more like breaded chicken fingers, and thought something magical would happen to the nutritional yeast when it hit the hot oil, allowing it to be converted into breading as the recipe name suggests.  After tasting the first delicious batch, I added breadcrumbs to achieve the desired effect.  Is there a way to rename the recipe so it's "crispy" instead of "breaded"?

Really good! I've been trying to find seitan recipes since I made a bunch of it. I thought the flavors worked really well together, and I didn't have any trouble with the breading. It stayed on fine. I added a bit of Panko breadcrumbs, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.

This is GOOD! I'm not a great cook, and most recipes I try only turn out okay, but this was an exception. It was great the first time around. I ate it with brown rice. I agree that it's not enough for 4 servings, though - it's about two.

Yumm. Its very tasty. I think it would be better to toast the seitan in a toaster oven so that when its dipped and fried the texture is a little tougher. I made it with peas and jasmine white rice. It was pretty easy and fast.

This is delicious.  It's like Italian style cutlets. At least how my ex mother-in-law made them. Moist, tender and tasty. I did use the mayo trick and breadcrumbs .  I mixed the seasonings with the mayo, dipped the seitan and then in the breadcrumbs. Thank you!

Really good following the recipe as written. Double if you want to feed four though. We had it along with some sauteed kale and a baked root vegetable medley so that it had the feel of a classic meat/vegetable/starch meal. Except without meat!

This is one of the best breaded meat substitute recipes I have tasted.  I used coconut oil instead.

For an easy vegan 'egg wash' use thinned out mustard. Use water and/or white wine with plain yellow or Dijon mustard.  It coats well and holds crumbs on better

Really good!  My first experience with seitan.  Used a homemade version off a different site, but this crisped up and was very chicken patty-ish on a bun with low sugar ketchup.

Very tasty coating.  I will try it on other things like tofu and tempeh.  I am fairly new to making seitan, and am not sure I am doing it right.  I had frozen some home-made seitan (I can't find it in any store where I live) which I had sliced a little too thin for this recipe, I think.  I had to add some broth to put moisture back in.  Will try again with thicker pieces next time.

I'm a new vegetarian and I loved this recipe.  I took another reviewers suggestion and doubled the yeast and spice mixture and I used soy sauce instead of tamari and served it with rice.  It was really good.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Very tasty! Yes, the kids did like to dip it in bbq sauce, but I liked mine just as is with some rice on the side. We also had some roasted butternut squash and sweet potato, and some sauted swiss chard/mushroom combo.

I followed the recipe very closely, except that I doubled the breading mixture (actually needed about 1-1/2 times the amount) and used olive oil for frying instead of vegetable oil. I loved it. Who needs chicken nuggets when you can have these? Thank you, veggigoddess, for this wonderful recipe!!!

A little too cumin-y.  I'm thinking I would like to try the baking method.

Thank you so much for this!  I like seitan a lot more than tofu, and this recipe gives me another option for a protein source.  I halved the cumin and doubled the coriander (I love coriander). I added a teaspoon of onion powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I also cut the seitan before frying for smaller pieces with flatter planes for cooking.  I sprayed with grape seed oil and oven-fried at 425 degrees.  I'll make again and again and try different dipping sauces.
