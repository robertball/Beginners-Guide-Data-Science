I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I chose to use balsamic vinegar instead of plain vinegar. Because I am watching my sugar intake, I substituted one packet Truvia for the white sugar. I thought this was good but the spices (parsley, basil, celery seed, marjoram, pepper) needed to be doubled.

This is a good, solid salad dressing!  I did use olive oil rather than the vegetable oil, and my vinegar was white balsamic--a nice complement to the flavors of herbs.  I used my garlic press rather than mincing.  I like that the herbs used are what I always have on hand!  Thanks for the good measurements!

Loved this-I made with apple cider vinegar and didn't have the marjoram so I just omitted it. Squirt of honey in place of white sugar. Turned out delicious!

So the Good Seasons Garlic & Herb dressing is my favorite! But is really hard to find around my area. I'm so glad I found this recipe as it tastes EXACTLY like it! I'm not a fan of celery seed so I added half of what was needed and only a teaspoon of sugar. Subbed olive oil and used oregano instead of marjoram. Tasty!! Also added lemon juice as others did as well and that definitely added to the yummyness!

Subbed Red wine or Balsamic vinegar for white and doubled.         Extra virgin olive oil.   Spices: doubled, including salt.    Sugar: unnecessary or halved.     Garlic: pressed or powder.   Half a lemon, squeezed.  Drizzled over a bed of romaine with tomato, cauliflower, onion, and garbanzo beans or chick peas - SUPERB!    - Thank you -

Very tasty. I substituted oregano for the marjoram so it could be used for Greek salad. I also added a squeeze of lemon. Will make again. Nice combination of herbs, which could be be doubled for a stronger flavor.

Outstanding flavour... I have been asked to make again for Thanksgiving dinner. (I substituted white balsamic for the white vinegar and honey in place of sugar)

I made this recipe as written twice.  I may try cutting the the sugar in half and try a good balsamic next time.  But raves from my dinner guests both times.

This is by far my favorite salad dressing! Salty and light with a tangy taste all the way. I reduce the usage of oil by 25% to get a thicker concentrate. I will definitely make this again next week!
