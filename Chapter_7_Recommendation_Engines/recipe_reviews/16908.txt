Very tasty.  A little too spicy for my son.
I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I 
used ground ginger.

This was very tasty. I marinated this for about 24 hours in a big Ziploc bag, shaking it up every once in awhile. I followed the recipe, with the only modification being a bit more red pepper. I baked this in the oven, covered, instead of grilling and it was very tender and moist. I served this with some rice and veggies one night and the next night diced the chicken up in an Asian Stir Fry. I'll keep this in my recipe box.

I think the ginger taste was too overpowering.  Next time I will cut the ginger in about half.  Other than that the taste was good and I would make this again.

This was very tasty!  I used about half the ginger and I think it wasn't too overpowering.  I grilled the chicken on my George Foreman grill and served with brown rice.  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this recipe was great.  The flavor was wonderful and very different from other asian marinades we've tried.  We like our food on the spicier side, so I would add more red chili pepper flakes next time.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was a bit salty.  I think using low-sodium soy sauce would help quite a bit.  Other than that, this was great.  A definite keeper!

I would omit the water the next time I made this and I added some chilli paste which gave it an extra "kick".

little too much ginger and lime for us.  I would definately keep track and consider your taste on these items in the marinade.  Very strong taste.

I use allrecipes a lot, but i hardly ever rate the recipes. This one I had to. We all loved this at my house. Will do it again for sure.  I also added a thai peanut sauce for dipping, With or with out the sauce it was great.

This was a great weeknight BBQ chicken recipe.  Chicken was moist and delicious.  Followed to a "T" with the exception of a little more red pepper flake.  Thanks, Humla, for submitting your recipe.   I enjoyed trying this.

Made this for dinner this evening, it was delicious. I had saved this recipe because of the ginger but had not used lime in a marinade before. I used bone-in skinless thighs, legs and wings. For this hot Memorial Day it was served outside by the grill with fresh, chilled cole slaw and whole grain corn chips; hubby had a cold glass of pinot grigio.  This marinade will be used again for pork loin and much more! Thank you Humla.

i was looking for something to "jazz up" basic bbq'd chicken breasts. and this recipe was great - easy enough for a novice like myself but tasted complex b/c of the different flavors in the marinade! i will definitely make this again.

I've eaten Thai BBQ chicken in Thai restaurants many times. This, recipe, however, is not even close. Firstly, the lime juice overpowers everything and makes it taste sour. Secondly, it should be sweeter so there's not enough sugar. I followed this recipe exactly. It was edible, but barely.

Converted to 3 servings and glad I did as my limes were dried out so, did'nt get enough juice out of them.  Also,  I used jarred minced garlic and powdered  ginger as this is what was on hand  That being said,  I only used a tsp of ginger and wow,  it sure overpowers everything else so I highly recommend reducing that as others have mentioned!  Cook time stated was exacto mundo & I even got the gorgeous carmelization as shown in the photo!! :)  Will definitely make this again using  the proper fresh  items needed ;)

This was great! Marinated it for more like 48 hrs due to circumstances lol. Great flavor wasn't too strong but was very noticable. Served with Thai Noodle salad. Perfect combination.

Marinated for 2 hours, and grilled over hickory chips on gas grill.  Served with fried rice.  We thought the lime was a bit overpowering. next time I'll try with 1/2 lime.

First time made the mistake of using the stated amount of ginger but in powder form. Uh, no. Don't do that. Second time made as directed.

I really liked the flavor of this chicken. I chose not to put the water in the marinade, instead I put 1/4 cup of olive oil to keep the chicken tender. And let it marinate for 5 hours in the fridge. I didn’t find this flavor spicy.
