Very good, simple chili with just basic ingredients.  Our family of five devoured it and needed more.  I recommend doubling it as she suggests, but use all kidney beans... yum!

I doubled the recipe, but instead of 2 cans of tomato sauce, I used 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes. I also used 2 cans of Kidney beans instead of pintos, because that it what I had in the pantry. Delicious!

So very easy and tasty. I ended up adding more of all of the spices. It was a *tad* bit on the tomato side, even with 1.4 lbs. of meat. Topped with green onions and shredded cheese. Oh, and I threw in half a can of diced green chiles that I needed to use.

I started with this basic recipe, but since I don't much care for tomatoes I halved the diced tomatoes, and doubled everything else, with both pinto and kidney beans as suggested.  It came out pefectly for me!  I liked the good flavor, but limited number of ingredients, because some of the chili recipes I found were way too complicated.

This is a nice, basic chili. I used a tad more crushed tomatoes, and doubled the garlic. It went very well wish mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe with the Homesteader Cornbread recipe from this site. It was VERY good. I doubled the recipe as suggested, and was surprised at how spicy it was. Next time I'll cut back on the spices a bit so the kids can enjoy it, too!  Thanks for a great, and very easy, recipe.

I loved it. I did do a little tweak to it and added a can of kidney beans, a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel) and some extra garlic powder. It was delicious!

Now this is good stuff. I've made a lot of chili in my time and this one made my husband rave. I thought it was a good basic no frills recipe and stands on it's own well enough. I only had a half of a Texas sweet onion. 8 oz. of mexican tomato sauce, a small can of tomato paste to which I added 1 can of beef consomme, Ranch Style beans, chipotle diced tomatoes. The next time I fix this I will add a 1/2 tsp of oregano, cocoa powder, 1 T of vinegar, 1 T sugar, and doubling the chili powder. This was a great starting point though and with a few tweaks will be my own (and Melanie's) 5 star chili. I let this simmer almost an hour and served it over spaghetti pasta then topped it with parmesan and a blend of shredded mexican cheese. We loved this meal!!! Thanks so much for the great chili. This was our first official chili dinner for the fall/winter 2012/13 season and it sure was a great one.

This was delicious.  I cooked my own pinto beans and added a little more seasonings than called for.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so added a couple drops of hot sauce.  I normally cheat and use packaged seasoning but proably won't again. This is much better for me, too - no additives or preservatives.

I decided to use this recipe because I wanted a basic chili without unusual ingredients. I used kidney beans and it turned out great. I will be making this again.

I started with this idea, but then it was nothing like it in the end. I used pinto beans, 2 cans diced tomato and chili, 1 big can crushed tomatoes, bag of shredded baby carrots, ground beef, onion, garlic, chili powder, red wine; and put it all in a crock pot for the day.

This was a nice, simple recipe - which is just what I was looking for.  I followed made the double batch with the pinto and kidney beans, which was nice.  I did think there was too much liquid (I cooked it down a bit before serving) and a bit too "tomato-y", so I might try it with just one can of tomato sauce next time.  I left the cayenne out because my little guys can't handle spice yet and my husband and I added some Frank's RedHot to our bowls to add it back in - all of us were happy. :)  I'll make this again - I love that it was so quick to make!

I was looking for a good chili-bean recipe for PINTO beans. Instead of using canned beans, I made my own homemade beans, which I haven't done in a very long time. The next day, I put together this recipe and it was really good. Everyone loved it. After making this recipe again a second time, the beans turned out even more delicious than the first time:-) This is definitly a keeper! Thanks Melanie:-)

Very simple and VERY good!  I made this once and my boyfriend & I were hooked.  Since then, I've amended the recipe a bit and now used 1/2 can of pinto beans & 1/2 can of kidney beans.  I also like to add chopped green pepper to give it a little color!
Thanks for a great chili recipe Melanie!

This was really good. Even my chili hating husband liked it. I doubled the recipe. Due to other reviewers saying that there was a strong tomato flavor, I didn't double the tomato sauce. Also, next time I will drain one of the cans of tomatoes. There was just a little too much liquid for me. I also added more than double of the chili powder and cumin. We only added about 1/4 t. cayenne since my husband and one of my little ones don't like anything spicy. We will probably tweak this a little but it will definitely be a keeper at our house. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I have been making this one for years now. I picked it because it didnt have a long list of weird ingredients. Most of the time I follow the recipe exactly as written and I always make a double batch. Every now and then I will add extra chili powder. This is a wonderful, homemade, simple, and delicious chili!!

Very tasty and easy!  Will double next time....A Couple questions - Should the beans be drained first?  I did, but wasn't sure.  Also - could not find cayenne pepper at my grocery store so just used some red pepper flakes to spice it up!

This was good chili, I did have to add more chili powder, but other than that it was very quick and it worked great for chili burgers. Thanks for sharing Melanie!

This is my very first review on this site, that's how much I enjoyed this recipe!  Let me start by saying that my husband is a self-proclaimed chili making master but I never eat his chili because he makes it so rich (aka FATTY) and too spicy for our boys and me to eat.  He LOVED this recipe.  

I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used a jar of Barilla Roasted Garlic pasta sauce.  I wanted to make this mild, so I just used a different mix of spices.   And that is what makes this recipe so great, you can customize the spices however you wish to make it as mild or hot to suit your taste buds. I also had a small chunk of Velveeta left in the fridge so I melted it up and drizzled it over the chili just before serving.  I didn't have anything fancy to serve on the side like cornbread, so I just used saltine crackers.  

This is great for warming up on cold, winter days, Sunday football gatherings (just serve with chips!), or anytime you want comfort food.

Great recipe!  I've made this many times now adding some of my own spices and letting it cook in the crock pot all day.  I switched to using ground turkey and it is super yummy and healthy.  I also add black beans along with chili beans, onion and green pepper.  I serve it with low fat sour cream, tortilla chips and cheese.  I really like the spices for this recipes.  Comes out perfect every time.

This chili is good!  Thank you, Melanie!  My family loved it.  I followed the recipe pretty much as is, except I used kidney beans instead of pintos (I didn't have pintos on hand).  I served it with sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and a side of cornbread.  This is especially good on a cold winter night.  Mmmm... good!

Melanie's Chili Haiku: "Good, basic chili. Used kidney beans, not pinto. Maybe needs some heat." A nice, well-rounded chili that perhaps would've been better w/ a small can of tomato sauce instead of 15 oz., along w/ more chili powder and some salt and pepper. Something came up, and after mine had simmered for 30 min., had to put it away until the next day, so my chili had an extra day for its flavors to marry, so by the time we sat down to eat it, it was the perfectly thick consistency that I like, and even though the hubbs and I had to add hot sauce, we still thought on its own, Melanie's Chili was pretty darn good.

I don't particularly like chili but this sounded so easy and good I decided to make a double batch. After one delicious cup I am now left with a ridiculous amount of chili for someone who maybe eats chili once a year. It was good though! I doubled everything except for the beef, onion and tomato sauce. Came to the perfect thickness. The spices are great as well. So easy! Hopefully my coworkers will eat it tomorrow.

Guess it's just me.  I didn't care for this recipe, I've had better.  Maybe it's cause I used ground turkey instead (I don't care to buy ground beef).  Although it's never been a factor on some of the other chili recipes I tried on here and really liked.  But all the other reviews are good, so don't listen to me! LOL

We as a family really like this- it is mild, which is good. And easy, & you usually have these ingredients around. I halved the cayenne which is standard, but maybe I didn't need to. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this chili tonight , for dinner.It came together quickly and easily. I added a small can of green chilis, 'cause that's how I roll.
It was delicious! I will make this again and again.
I had mine with sour cream , Fritos and cheddar cheese.

I added a little bit more spice and cooked pintos beans in multi cooker.   This chili was the best I’ve ever made! My husband was bragging about it the night I made it. 2 days later, and he’s still eating it and commented. Again about how good it is.  I will make this again and again. It’s so easy!

Actually, my husband made this a for Super Bowl party. He couldn’t believe how easy and delicious it turned out. He did add extra garlic and cumin. I know it’s going to be a hit tonight at the party. I hope this inspires him to cook more often - ha ha!

Great basic recipe.  Added a little cinnamon and bone broth for a little more depth of flavor.  I like my chilli a little thinner.  Good taste, will make it again.

Wow! I have been using chili spice packets from the store for years and the chili was always just OK. My husband asked for chili one night and I didn't have a packet on hand. Well, I am so glad I found this recipe! way better than the packets and almost as easy! Thank you for sharing!

Really relish! I made it a few months back as written and it was very good! Tonight I'm making it with ground turkey instead of beef! I also add bell peppers and sauté them with the meat and onions and it's so yummy!

Basic chili recipe, Next time I would add chopped green pepper to the meat and onions to give it more flavor.  Was a tad bland.

OMG I couldn't stop eating this, it was so GOOD!  Only made a couple of changes but only because of what I had or didn't have on hand. I didn't have a can of tomatoes so I chopped a whole tomatoe and added a can of tomatoe soup and the can of tomatoe sauce.  I also doubled the spices because it didn't look like enough; so glad I did.  I simmered for longer then the 20 minutes though because it was too runny at 20 minutes.  Served over a bed of rice... yummy.  I might never go back to my recipe again.

It's cold and rainy here today and I really wanted chili but was exceptionally disappointed to discover that I was out of the chili mix I usually use. This was a great substitute - simple without a bunch of weird ingredients. I did find it a little bland and so added a little of this and that but this was a great basic recipe and I'm really glad I found it this evening. Thanks!

This  is the first chili I have ever made. My husband said he would give it a 'B' because he would like to have green peppers added. My daughter, son-in-law, and I really liked it. We added Fritos, cheese, and a little sour cream to it when it was in the bowl. I will definitely make this again.

I did change this recipe a little. I used 3 tbsp of chili powder, 1 1/2 tbsp of cumin and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic. Also added a tbsp of sugar to cut down on the acidity. Even my picky 3 yr old loved it and she does not eat anything with hamburger in it. Will definitely make this again. I also used chili beans instead of pinto beans.

Super easy and very tasty! We used a tri-bean blend (pinto, kidney, and black), Turkey instead of beef, and added extra of the seasoning since we like it spicy! We topped it with cheese and paired it with gluten free corn bread to complete the meal :) best of all the recipe is naturally gluten free which is great since I live with celiac's disease.

I am NO cook, but I made this tonight. I may have added a bit more chili powder, because the lid fell off while pouring, but the end result was delicious. Thank you Melanie.

This has become my go-to chili recipe and always gets great reviews by friends and family.  The level of heat can be easily adjusted.  I usually double this recipe to freeze and save for future meals and have begun adding green peppers and a variety of beans for depth in color and texture.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Thanks for the great reviews!  I actually tweek this recipe everytime I make it, and look for suggestions from others.  Just to correct one basic thing, I do cook the garlic with the onions.

This recipe served as a very handy framework when I had to come up with lunch using the ingredients my boyfriend had in his pantry.  I still had to make a few substitutions, and I used chopped up veggie burgers instead of actual meat, but I came up with a very nice chili.  I will continue to use this recipe as a guideline, but probably still tinker with it, 'cause that's just what I do!

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for a chili recipe without any exotic ingredients and this is it.  I doubled the chili powder and added more garlic. For the diced tomatoes, I got the ones with chilis in them. I also omitted the tomato sauce and instead added about three cans of tomato juice.  I think it would have been too think with tomato sauce.  Oh yeah, it doesn't say, but make sure you drain your beef after you brown it.  Thanks!

HURRAY! I've never made chili before and this recipe is SUPERB! I left out the cumin (personal preference), doubled the recipe and used half dark kidney beans, half pinto beans, 1 can regular diced tomatoes, and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles. YUM YUM YUM! Thanks so much for sharing!

Great chili recipe, but kind of bland flavor. I cooked all the spices with beef and onion to maximize the flavor. Mild chili recipe.
