These were just perfect, followed the recipe exactly, was a little leery of all that vinegar, but glad that I used it.  I served with basmati rice, and my husband is still raving.  The pork chops came out moist and tender, even after an hour in the oven, uncovered.  Can't wait to show off with this recipe for company!

Love it! However I did sybstitute Fresh sage for the dried savory. I love fresh sage, and use it all the time,especially with pork or chicken.

I made these two days ago and were so darn tasty, I made them again last night. Very tender with just enough zip, making them the best chops I have ever tasted. I am so glad you posted this recipe. Thank you!!

Very nice! my family loved it! nice and light with a little tang... I did decrease the vinegar to 3 tablespoons as to not over power the summer savory or sour cream and I cooked it in an electric frying pan at 275 for 40 mins uncovered the last 20 mins.... great recipe!

I made this last night.  Wasn't sure about the vinegar, but it came out tasting great.  I did add rubbed sage to the flour mixture (because I like it on chops).  I made 6 chops, used 1 14 oz can of Swanson's chicken broth and about a cup of sour cream.  It wasn't done in one hour - they were still tough -- and the sauce was really runny.  So I sprinkled some "Wondra" flour on top of them and cooked for another 1/2 hour.  They were delicious and the sauce was perfect!  Great recipe.  All said, I will be making again!

These pork chops are incredibly tender--and not at all overcooked, which could be the case after browning on the stovetop and baking for an hour.  It must be the sour cream mix that protects the pork chops.  It does develop  a "skin" on the sour cream, but it still tastes fine.  I used ground savory bc I don't have dried summer savory, and I added a bit of garlic powder.  I also added some corn starch to the mix while heating it in the pan so as to get a thicker sauce.  It turned out well.  It is kind of sweet and sour--not really like sweet and sour sauce but it does faintly remind me of it.  I do like it, even if it didn't result in the most beautiful pic I've ever taken.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love sour cream, and this was great.  I have a hard time digesting meat if it isn't tender.  This was so tender I cut it with a spoon.  I served it with a spiach orzo.  Exccellent...

Special thanks to Grandma Margie (and Shiloh) for sharing a great recipe! The sauce is wonderful, a mild sweet/sour flavor that complements the meat nicely.  I didn't have summer savory but read on-line that thyme is a substitute.  I garnished with parsley, served it with rice, cooked in my left-over chicken broth, peas, and red grapes. The presentation was appealing and my husband (a tough critic) like it.  This is a keeper!

Thanks to the reviewers' notes, the dish turned out to be great!  Note to anyone who wants to try the recipe in the future, add SALT.  The main ingredient missing in the recipe is salt.  I salted the pork chops before coating them with flour.  And add a tablespoon salt while cooking the sour cream mixture. With the amount of pork chops, 4, that the recipe calls for, you will for sure get the watery sauce at the end. So add 2 more chops and whisk in about 1 tablespoon flour left from coating the chops.  If you really don't want the chop to taste sweet, cut the sugar in half.  I also added a red onion (julianed) and a small box of mushroom (sliced) sautéed in the oil left from browning the chops.

Loved them! I thought the ingredients were a little odd at first but they turned out amazing. I'm not a huge pork chop fan but I will make these again. My husband was impressed!

Tried this tonite and hubby loved it.  My chops were a bit more fatty so there was a layer of oil I had to pour off the pan while cooking.  The sour cream added a nice flavor.  It was quite savory with the vinegar as an added surprise liking.  I cooked it with rice and acorn squash as sides.  Perfect for cold fall nites :)

These were very moist and had quite an original taste, but the flavors didn't really blend together enough for my family's taste. I will still be searching for the perfect pork chop recipe. Three and one half stars, bumped up to four for ease of preparation, low cost, and moistness. Thank you.

This was just OK.  I was concerned when I poured the sauce over the chops as it was pretty watery.  It did thicken up with cooking.  Not as flavorful as I anticipated.  Will probably not make again. . .there's so many better recipes for chops on this site.

These were good, although the sauce was a little thin and it made way too much.

MMMM tasty sauce!  I used cider vinegar, and used sage instead of savory as that was the closest substitution I could come up with (out of necessity).  Both times I've made this, I've just prepared it on the stovetop to keep the kitchen cool.  Brown the pork and then simmer in the sauce until cooked through - served with couscous and dried cranberry pilaf.

Surprisingly very tasty!  I had my doubts, but they were very good and moist.  I substituted apple cider vinegar which I thought would go better with pork chops.  I didn't have savory, but substituted thyme with a pinch of sage.  Yummy!

I made this with very few changes. I always season my meat before dredging, 2 chops instead of 4 and oregano/thyme mixture instead of Savory since I was out. I did find the vinegar a bit overwhelming. I am going to try substituting white wine or white wine vinegar to make it less "tangy". I also found it too sweet with that much sugar. I will likely omit the sugar in the future. I LOVE the concept for this dish though. My husband rated it "It won't break my heart if you make it again" LOL.

This is awsome! I could not find the savory so I used italian seasoning. I added some fresh mushrooms and a dash or 2 of worcestershire sauce. I also used fat free sour cream and white wine vinegar. I did not add bay leaves did not have any. Cooked on the grill in a foil pan.

Not your same ol' same ol'.  Tender chops that were very good. Very moist.  I used white balsamic vinegar.  I might use just a tad less vinegar next time.  I will definitely make these again.

While these were the most tender pork chops I've ever eaten, my family wasn't a huge fan of the flavor.  I was really upset, because the picture makes them look so good.  The meal was edible (served them with sour cream mashed potatoes and lima beans), but we won't make this again.

I used 3 tblspns white vinegar, 1 can of broth, and Italian seasonings in place of the savory (didn't have it and we were snowed in) 1tsp of Worst sauce, and also added a teaspoon of Cornstarch before pouring the sauce mixture over the chops. Served over egg noodles. When I have the chance, I'll use Savory, but it turned out DELICIOUS! The entire family approved so it will go into the favorites rotation. VERY quick and easy to prepare.

A quick, tasty recipe. I halved it and used Splenda and it came out great! It went well with a cornbread side. Will try it with mashed potatoes next time.

This was awesome......My husband dont like pork but he loved this!!! I added minced onions and a pinch of galic salt and only 3 of vinegar instead of 5. I boiled egg noodles and added to the chops for the last 15 mins of bake time.

I was looking for something different for pork chops and decided to try this recipe. It was excellent. I used Italian seasoning as a substitute for the savory and added some sauteed onions and mushrooms. My husband really loved it too.

I liked this very much. I didn't have savory, so I used basil. I cut back on the vinegar. Next time, I will used the full amount of vinegar and get some savory. Thanks for the recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe it looked great but boy what a let down. It was way to much vinegar and the sourcream/vinegar combo was not good and the sauce was too thin. There was no saving this dish!

Thank you for the recipe.  I made it as the recipe says, and the pork chops were nice and tender, but it was a little too much vinegar/sugary tangy for me.  I think that overall, it is a good recipe, but I will have to tweak it to my taste.  I was hopeing to use some of the sauce on my mashed potatoes, but it just didn't seem right.  I was thinking it was going to be more of a salty, flavorful gravy, but it was just to sweet for me.  I'm going to play with this recipe and reduce the vinegar and sugar to try to get it to come out more to my taste.  Thank you.

I have been looking for this recipe, I had these years ago and have been looking for years, they are just as amazing as I remember.  I messed up and used apple cider vinegar next time i will use white vinegar. Amazing and very tender will cook these again. Thank you for posting this.

I used white wine vinegar and was happy with the taste. However, the sauce was very thin.

I followed the recipe as instructed, only substituting thyme for the summer savory. I have to say, it was mediocre. The sauce was very runny. And I don't know what it is, but I can NOT get pork chops to be tender. That is why I tried this recipe. But they were still somewhat tough. Oh well, they did have a nice flavor, and my husband seemed to enjoy them.

WOW - I loved it! I messed up and it still turned out GREAT!  I thought I had savory and sage at home, I didn't. I was going to use a small amount of dill but thought I'd try it without any spice.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was way too much of a vinegar taste. We like vinegar, but this did not smell or taste good.  I followed the recipe as written,cooked longer than called for as we do not eat on a firm schedule. When I took the pork chops out, the sauce was too vinegary and thin. I tasted it and decided at that time to thicken it with a small amount of flour.  I cooked the flour in for a few minutes, and the consistency was much better.  The taste was just too much vinegar.  I love Summer Savory, and would have been happier with just the broth and savory.

Tried this recipe and absolutely hated it! The sauce was too thin and sort of sickly sweet and sour. For sweet and sour would stick to a red sauce next time.

This was GREAT.  I did not have any sour cream though and I used plain non-fat yogurt.  I too was skeptical about the vinager so I only used 4 tablespoons. They came out sooo tender.  My husband did not like the look of the dish but he and my daughter (4 yrs) loved it too.

This was delicious, I added a can of mushrooms to the sauce.
I don't know if the mushrooms were the cause but the sauce was not very thick, at least not as thick as I like it.
I ended up putting the chops on another dish and put them in the oven to keep them warm while I thickened the sauce with corn starch.
Will definetly make this again.

I used this recipe last night for the family and tried to keep an open mind about the ingredients.  Way too much vinegar and the sauce never thickened. The chops were tender but the taste was overwhelmed by the vinegar.  I will finish the left overs tonight but I will not use this recipe again.  I will keep searching for pork chop recipes on this site!

This is my favourite way to have pork chops! Recipe is easy and the sauce is awesome on mashed potatoes! :)
My husband also loves it, who is not a fan of sour cream at all (I didn't tell him what was in the sauce until after he ate it)! haha!

We tried this recipe this weekend and didn't care for the taste of the sauce  with the vinegar in it.  the chops were really tender, though, and next time we will tweak it a bit and use a mixture of sauteed mushrooms and onions with a bit of garlic and omit the vinegar.  I guess I'll have to call it Margaret's Sour Cream Port Chops!

My family of four did not care for this dish.  I was worried about the reviews of the sauce being too thin, so I added about a tablespoon of flour to the sauce mix.  The consistency of the sauce came out perfect thanks to the flour tip!  The pork chops also came out very tender.  The flavor of the sauce was not good.  I did not have summer savory, so I substituted thyme as another reviewer suggested.  I would not recommend using thyme.  It did not match well with the sweet/tangy flavor.  Also, I only used 4 tablespoons of vinegar, and it still was to vinegary.  So disappointed.  It looked so good.

After a few bites I just could not stand the flavor. I could see my son was picking at his!!lol So I told him I really could not finish my chops. He looked at me and said "Dad I like them with the cream of mushroom soup you make. These taste funny."

I have made this recipe three times and each time the sauce has been thin and tasteless no matter how long I cook it.

I tried this recipe last night. It was good, but I think next time I will leave the sugar out. I love how moist & tender the chops turned out.

The sauce looks watery and tastes strange when first added to the meat, but it cooks down to be rather thick and especially good, an almost unique taste.

I doubled the recipe and substituted poultry seasoning for the summer savory and apple cider vinegar for the regular. Not successful. The chops were very tender, but the sauce had a very odd consistency. Flavor of sauce was okay, but not great. I'll try it again without substitutions.
