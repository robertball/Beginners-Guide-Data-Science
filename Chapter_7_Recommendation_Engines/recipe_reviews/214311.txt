Delicious! Super easy tasted just like a peanut butter cup. I ended up swirling my peanut butter into the clocolate. Still looked great. Thank you, I'll make again, for sure!

Kids loved these.  They didn't even wait for them to refrigerate after assembly - they just dove right in.  I topped with extra cool chip, some chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Fast, easy, and delicious!
