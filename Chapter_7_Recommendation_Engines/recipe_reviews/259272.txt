The only thing I did differently was the cooking method and I left the sausage links whole and then I sliced them.
 I cooked this in my instant pot. I used to saut√© function to brown the Italian sausage,  then removed the Italian sausage and added some oil, the sliced green bell pepper, onions, and sliced mushrooms. I then added the tomatoes, and placed the sausages on a trivet and cooked on low heat for 10 minutes.  To preserve the intensity of the herbs and seasonings I added those after I released the pressure. Yum!!!

I used marinara sauce instead of the canned tomatoes. Delicious!
