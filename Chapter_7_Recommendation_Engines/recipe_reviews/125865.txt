These are SO delicious, but the first time I made them, most of the trail mix and caramel slid off the apple onto the wax paper.  The second time, I dipped the apples in the caramel and let them set up in the fridge for about an hour.  Once they were set, I rubbed a damp paper towel around the apples (to make them sticky again), and then rolled them in the trail mix.  It was an extra step, but they held up perfectly!  Also, I found them easier to eat if you slice them up.  Not as much fun, but definitely easier!

Yum, we used the trail mix with the colorful M&M's and almonds in them.  Really looked great! Great idea!

The taste was good, the crunch of the train mix is a fun, dry alternative to the wet crunch of the apple.  But eating it can be a challenge, not that eating carmel apples are ever easy.

Deeeelicious!!!  If you chill the apples beforehand (put mine in the frig for a few hours) and dry them with a papertowel right before dipping them in caramel, it sticks perfectly!  We tried crushed heath bars in addition to the trail mix.  YUM!!!!
