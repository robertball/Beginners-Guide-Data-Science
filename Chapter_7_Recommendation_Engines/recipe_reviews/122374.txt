These definitely are delicious, slightly sweet, bite-sized little treats. They're perfect with a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. You might be tempted as I was to nibble on them on all day - not just for breakfast! My husband just loved these! I used butter instead of shortening plus 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. These turned out very light, moist, and fluffy - definitely a recipe that's sure to please every time.

I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was satisfied with these.  They're very similar to a cake donut, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I used a scoop (the kind with a spring-loaded sweeping blade) to portion the sticky batter, and I made exactly nine muffins.  I think the butter/sugar at the end is critical, and it works out to about 2 t. butter per puff.  Mine ended up sitting for almost an hour before we ate them, and one I had later in the afternoon was just as good, so there isn't much pressure to serve immediately as the recipe would indicate.  I'll be making these again.

Good recipe, just made a couple of changes the second time around; cut back sugar to 1/4, added cinnamon to the flour mixture and 5 minutes before the "puffs" were done used a sugar water glaze.  In my mind made it somewhat healthier without nearly a stick of butter as a glaze.  I also served them with fresh fruit slices.  It was a hit!

Wow!  These are great!  I was in the mood for cake doughnuts but didn't want to bother with frying so I gave these a shot.  Instead of nutmeg I added about 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I also substituted powdered sugar for the topping, I think this makes the mixture stick much better.  The batter is really sticky and stiff so it was hard to fill the muffin cups only 1/3 full.  I didn't use muffin liners and filled the cups half full so it only made 8, but they were worth it.  Very quick and easy to make.  My hubby is the family taste-tester and he says "Give 'em a 5!"

Very very good.  These taste similar to a coffee cake donut, but lighter in flavor and texture.  The only thing I did differently was before I baked them, I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top.  In doing so, they did not need to be rolled in the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture which saved some fat calories.  I did serve them warm, and cut a few open and put some Smart Balance on them which did make them extra yummy!  Good recipe - will make again!

This came out so nicely.  Texture like a great cake donut.  1st time I followed the recipe to the letter, and they came out perfect.  Next time I'll try all the traditional (and not so traditional) donut toppings.

I loved these. I made them for Thanksgiving morning, and I mixed the dry ingredients the night before so I could just toss it all together and not measure anything in the morning. I didn't use muffin cups in the muffin tin, I just used my non-stick muffin pan and greased it. They popped out just fine, and none stuck at all (I probably could've just tipped it upside down and they would've all fallen out themselves). Also, with the muffin cups filled 2/3 of the way, it only made 9, but they were a good size that way. At the end, instead of rolling them in butter and the granulated sugar and cinnamon mix, I took them out of the tins when they were still hot and rolled them in powered sugar and cinnamon like you would with regular donuts. I thought these tasted great, nice and cakey and fluffy just like a donut! You could probably easily use these in one of those donut baking pans, or even use the dough to make cinnamon rolls with. Great recipe! :)

Very good - not quite as light as I was expecting but the taste was great. The cinnamon sugar topping and butter are the best. Don't skimp on it. If you can't afford the calories eat a salad!

We used buttermilk instead of regular milk and also subtracted two teaspoons of the milk and added two teaspoons of vanilla flavoring. My oldest son made this almost unassisted (I watched mostly and jumped in when he needed it) from beginning to end. The husband and boys thought these were great--they ate almost all of them in less than ten minutes. I got ONE. ONE puff. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

These were a good, quick breakfast pastry.  I did opt to bypass the extra butter & cinnamon sugar topping.  Instead, I dusted the puffs with powdered sugar & cinnamon and they were still pretty tasty.  They do have a cake donut texture & maybe using a mini-muffin pan would be good, too (would be just like donut holes!).  They were very pretty with the powdered sugar dusting!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  :)

I made these on a Sunday morning before church and managed only to get one because my family devoured them all. I added the cinnamon inside the batter and when done I basted them with butter on top and rolled in an apple sugar topping I got from Pampered Chef. I also sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  The only change I would make is to add a bit more nutmeg or try using the pumpkin spice to give it more flavor. The texture was exactly like a cake donut even with no frying this was delicious.  I would definitely make this over and over again. P.S. I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

This recipe has been a family favorite since I was in grade school (30+ years ago). It was in mom's Betty Crocker cookbook. Thank you for sharing it. 

It's now a Christmas morning tradition.

I tried this recipe and I didn't really like it. I didn't have any milk so I used half and half--that might have ruined the recipe. The taste of these was just strange.

My son made these for his history class. They were very easy and tasted great. We did use mini muffin pans and skipped dipping them in butter. The cinnamon sugar stuck just fine without it. Thanks for the recipe.

These were absolutely delicious! They were so light and tender. I ran out of butter so I lightly sprayed each puff with Pam spray and then rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mix. They were white when I took them out of the oven, but they were done. I just wasn't expecting them to look that way.

Very yummy! I made these in mini muffin pans and baked for 12 minutes. They were great. I rolled some of them in cinnamon sugar, some in powdered sugar (no butter used) and some others I glazed with the "Hard Chocolate Glaze" from this site. The cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar ones were the best. Will make again. Love the small size (like donut holes).

Very yummy! I did make some changes based on other reviews. I added nearly half a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. Also, I skipped the butter topping entirely. I just sprinkled cinnamon sugar in the bottom of each muffin cup and sprinkled more on top before baking. The butter would be yummy I just didn't want the extra calories and fat this time. My kids loved it as well. Thanks for a quick and yummy breakfast recipe that we can dress up or down based on the occasion.

Yummy! I made these with soymilk due to an allergy- they came out just a little touch dry, but otherwise great! I was out of nutmeg, used just a tiny pinch of allspice instead. I brushed the top with melted butter then sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon on, then repeated, which tasted like streusel. My amount of batter made six regular muffins and twelve mini muffins. Overall they were great!

Anyone who said these weren't light/fluffy enough must not have followed the directions very well.  In fact, the bottoms of them were so fluffy that they soaked up the melted butter like a sponge, so 6T was only enough for 7 of my 12 puffs.  I think I'll try something different with the other 5, though, like spreading Nutella or jelly on them, maybe.  We'll see.  These don't taste exactly like a donut to me, but they're close enough to satisfy the donut craving I was having!

I made this recipe for some unexpected guests because I only had 1 egg and that's what it called for!  It really makes about 10 decent sized puffs.  It was excellent!  The kiddos loved dipping their own puffs in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  My daughter said she preferred this to a trip to the donut store (and that's her favorite!)

I made these for my mom's birthday brunch. With the word "puff" in the title, I expected a light and fluffy pastry, but they came out more like a muffin. I was concerned until I rolled them in butter and the cinnamon sugar! My mom and sister both liked these alot and brought the leftovers home. Don't be deceived by the name and you will have a yummy, easy breakfast addition!

These did taste like doughnuts. They're a great alternative to those fried doughnuts and are quick to prepare. I split mine after they cooled a little bit more and dolloped plain whipped cream, chocolate cream or stawberry cream on the bottom halves then replaced the tops.

I had to make some changes to this recipe due to my daughter's milk and egg allergies. Wasn't light and tasty, but still good. I think if I make it again I will use powder sugar. They almost taste like the bagged donuts you buy in the grocery store on the Little Debbie aisle.

These were a breeze to put together and perfect for breakfast!  I subbed butter, cake flour and soy milk for the shortening, AP and cow milk and sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking.  Baked for 15 min at 350 and 5 more at 400 to get the outsides a little firm.  After baking, I turned the tops over into a mound of powdered sugar.  The result was 11 wonderful little somethings that are vaguely reminiscent of a light cake donut.  The outsides have a nice crunch and the insides are incredibly fluffy.  I would love to try these in a mini muffin pan!

Not quite like a muffin, reminds me of a coffee cake. I made it with 1/4 c. or butter-flavored shortening insted of 1/3 regular. I also cooked it in huge muffin cups so it took 24 minutes to bake. But it only took ten minutes to prep not twenty. Very light and yummy. I didn't roll the dough in butter and sugar and cinnamon, so maybe that's why it didn't take like a cake donut to me. I was just looking for something a little different, and it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Family loved 'em though!

This was great!  My son has been begging me to buy him a donut for days.  With this recipe I was able to offer him something a little healthier that completely satisfied his craving.  Here were my alterations:  I used Earth Balance Natural Shortening, 1/4 cup sugar in the dough, 1/2 cup for rolling, I used whole wheat flour, then increased the baking powder to 2 1/4 tsp. (due to the flour change), I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp, and used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of butter to dip them in.  I baked them in a mini muffin pan, so the recipe made 24 "mock donut holes", each about 115 calories.  Thanks so much!
