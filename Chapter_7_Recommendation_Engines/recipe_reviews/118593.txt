This is the best ice cream ever!! I was feeling lazy so I threw in a can of blueberry pie filling and two store-bought graham cracker crusts near the end of the churning instead of making them myself.

This recipe is fantastic! Next time I will crush my blueberries, as they became little blueberry ice cubes once frozen. Don't limit yourself to just this one flavor. I use the ice cream base from this recipie with lots of other add-in's and flavors. It's easy to prepare and the texture is smooth and creamy, unlike most homemade ice cream that I have made in the past that turned out icy and grainy. This one is a winner!

This may very well be the creamiest ice cream I've ever had.  My brother in law (who is SO picky) said it tastes just like Cold Stone!  I wasn't too keen on using up the whole quart of cream (as it's so expensive, and I didn't want it to be TOO rich!), so I used 3 cups cream and 3 cups whole milk (instead of a quart of cream and 2 cups milk).  It was PERFECT.  Also, the cheesecake pudding was AWESOME in this.  I debated on using cream cheese and am REALLY glad I didn't!  The pudding was probably BETTER.

I made this ice cream yesterday morning to serve as dessert later that night.  The end result was really, really good but I did make some changes; and when I make it again, I will further refine the recipe.  I kept the blueberry sauce the same (used frozen blueberries) and it was good.  I made the graham cracker crust the same, but next time I will use about 1.5 cups of crumbs and no sugar.  The crumbs are sweet enough on their own considering you're adding them to ice cream and you do need to reduce the amount of crumbs (or increase the amount of butter), because I didn't really get a crust, it was very crumbly.  I did chance the ice cream significantly, I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 1.5 cups of 1% milk and 1.5 cups of table cream.  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup (I will further reduce it to 1/2 cup next time).  The biggest change I made was to omit the pudding and used real cream cheese.  I microwaved about 4 oz and whisked it until it was just little lumps, then I cut up another 2 ounces into tiny squares and added that.  The end result was really good, but a bit too sweet for us.

No eggs and no cooking... Count me in!I doubled the recipe for my 6 quart ice cream maker.  I used 1 quart heavy cream and 2 quarts half and half.  I reduced the sugar in the cream mixture by one third, and it was just right.  I subbed strawberries for blueberries and followed another reviewer's suggestion by using prepackaged graham cracker pie crust in place of the graham cracker mixture.  This is the best ice cream I've ever made, and I've made a lot of ice cream!

Made this for a dinner party and it was fantastic!  I prepared exactly to the recipe using fresh blueberries.  The graham filling was a "crumbly" consistency after cooking and did not get soggy in the ice cream(even after a few days).

This was awesome!!! So rich and creamy. I left out the graham cracker crust part and used raspberries instead of blueberries. Everyone raved about it. My Mom is going to go buy and ice cream machine just because of this recipe!

This recipe ROCKS!! The whole family loved it. It was nice and creamy! The recipe made way more graham cracker mixture, just bagged and stuck it in the freezer to use the next time I make this ice cream. Which may be once a week the way the family has been asking for it. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of doubling the blueberry mixture as I had double the amount of berries to use. I'm glad I did as half wouldn't have been near enough. That, and the fact the recipe calls for fresh or frozen berries yet doesn't direct to increase the cornstarch if using frozen causes it to lose a star (very important to do, and a beginner cook may not know that). Please don't be tempted to shortcut and buy your graham crust. Store bought ones just don't have the flavor and texture. This one was delicious and crunchy and the cinnamon really adds a lot to the overall flavor. This whole recipe really isn't a lot of work anyway. It is sinfully rich and delicious! You won't be disappointed.

I made this with strawberries since that's what I had on hand. Made 1/4 of the recipe since too much of this in the freezer would just be too uber-tempting ;-)  Fantastic end result!!!

Wow! So good! I prepped the blueberry mixture (I must remember to mash them in the pot when the mixture is nearly done simmering as I didn't care for the frozen lumps I encountered here and there- I'm also going to use a pint container of berries instead of 1 1/4 cups next time), the graham cracker mixture and the liquid yesterday (less 1/4 cup sugar: our family likes the sweetness ratio of 3 cups cream/half&half/milk/etc. to 3/4 cups sugar. I knew the pudding was going to be sweet on its own so I reduced the sugar.) and added the cheesecake pudding mix to it today and churned it. I have the KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker and the mixture was darned near the top when it was done. I broke up the batch into two different containers using most of the blueberry mixture in one and using some homemade strawberry jam in the other. 2 different tastes from one churning! I chose not to pat down the graham cracker mixture in the pan and simply stirred it several times as it baked and now have a loose, crispy, tasty mixture stashed in my freezer. I didn't use even a quarter of it between the two batches, and simply sprinkled some extra atop the ice cream in the dessert dishes. Unbelievably delicious ice cream! Thanks so much for posting, Melissa!

Amazing recipe. I did make a few changes though (even though I hate it when people that say that! lol). First, I used REAL cream cheese. Higher in calories and fat but I'm sure that made it MUCH richer. Second, instead of swirling the blueberry sauce and crust crumbles into the actual ice cream then freezing it, I just layered everything into a serving dish; one scoop or more of ice cream, drizzled with blueberry sauce then sprinkled with crust and repeat. DELICIOUS! My birthday is next week and I'll definitely be making this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My family's favorite ice cream mix.  And the recipe is so versatile - have exchanged raspberries and lime for the blueberries, and crumbled waffle cone for the "crust."  Everyone loves this recipe!

This icecream is the best. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it.  I would make this again and again. I didn't make any changes and I can't wait to experiment with other fruits.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was excited to make this recipe after reading all the great reviews.  It was very easy to make and overall, it tasted great, but it was wayyy too sweet for our taste.   I have to admit that I used a larger pudding box, 5.2 oz, since that's all I could find, but I added 2 additonal cups of milk to make up for the extra pudding.   I also cut back the sugar in the icecream mixture to 1 cup, but it was still very sweet.   My kids even found this to be way too rich and sweet.  

Also, it says to fill the ice cream freezer 2/3 full and to freeze the rest, but this whole recipe only fill my freezer to just under 1/2 full.  I didnt think my freezer is larger than average, but maybe it is???

 I will definitely try this again since the overall taste was good, but I think I'll leave the pudding out completely.

WOW! Absolutely fabulous! Great, great ice cream, my husband kept saying how good it was. It does freeze hard, but nothing a few seconds of softening in the microwave cannot remedy. Because my Sunbeam ice cream maker's capacity is only 1/2 gallon I did cut all ingredients in half. I LOVE cheesecake so to up the cheesecake flavor I added 4 ounces softened cream cheese and 2 T sour cream. I used frozen strawberries in place of the blueberries as that is what I had on hand, and used the juice from the thawed berries in place of the water. The homemade graham cracker crust pieces are a must. They have a touch of cinnamon in them which the pre-made store crusts do not have. This makes a world of difference in my book. This ice cream tastes even better then Cold Stone's cheesecake ice cream. I know it would be good even without all the berries and graham pieces.

YUMMMMMY! I do hate when people rate a recipe and make so many changes that it's not even relevante anymore. That being said, I did use the short cut method of the blueberry pie filling and crust from the store with these shortcuts, it was easy and delicious! I've snuck to the freezer several times to grab a bite before severing for desert tonight..... so good :)

Soooo good and I'm the type who prefers a more sinful flavor like chocolate! I mashed my blueberries up as another reviewer said hers froze into solid little balls. I made in my 2 qt. Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker, but the recipe was a bit too much for it to handle. It was still very soft after 45 mins. of churning and began to expand over the top attachment. I will cut the recipe in half next time. Due to the overflow I served the ice cream as is and put out the blueberry sauce and graham cracker crumble as toppings. It was eaten every which way and boy was it a hit! The graham cracker crumble was especially delicious and was difficult not to snack on in general. The only disappointment was that the ice cream became rock hard once it was stored in the freezer. This is likely due to the addition of sugar and instant pudding. Next time I will make with fat free Half & Half instead of milk and omit the sugar and pudding all together which will yield a soft and creamy texture even after fully freezing. If you choose to use the sugar, I recommend cutting down the 1.5 cups- way too much! One-half cup at most is sufficient. Thanks for such a wonderful treat! I will be making many times over!

This was excellent and my kids loved it. I did use banana pudding and frozen triple berries because that was all I has on hand. I also do not have an ice cream maker, so I blended the ingredients thoroughly, put a chill on the ice cream, did the layering, and them placed in the freezer. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We made this today and it really isn't ice cream.  It's more like a home made whipped cream and pudding mixture.  Although it is great tasting whipped cream, it's not ice cream.

The BEST ice cream I have ever had!  A little more work than usual ice cream but totally worth it!  Even though I only had the vanilla pudding it STILL tasted so much like cheesecake!  So glad we made this, it was delicious!

Very good flavor, and the ice cream has a wonderful smooth texture.  I could not find cheesecake pudding mix, so I used vanilla.  Then I warmed a little cream cheese in the microwave and mixed with milk.  This did the trick, gave me a cheesecake flavor.  Regarding the syrup, I agree with others that the blueberries get hard when frozen.  I may have to mash them up next time.  Made extra syrup to pour over top.  Love this recipe and will make again.

I made this as strawberry cheesecake ice cream for a church picnic.  It was fantastic.  I used the cheesecake pudding and graham crusts.  I got a little creative making the strawberry gel (I used Junket Danish Dessert).  I can't wait to try the blueberry!  Many compliments and folks coming back for seconds.

One of the BEST ice creams I've made yet.  I couldn't find the cheesecake pudding but wanted the cheesecake flavor, so I used 8 ounces of cream cheese.  I microwaved it to soften it for 30 seconds, added a little milk and whisked it smooth.  I cut up a few chunks to add in to get that flavor in one bite, but once frozen, it was like little ice pellets, I wouldn't do it again.  But the cream cheese throughout worked wonderfully.

This is an amazing recipe. My husband said it's the best ice cream he's ever had.
I substituted raspberry pie filling. I used 1/2 pkg. of Jell-o instant cheesecake mix and all of the gingerbread crumb mix. I didn't add more sugar to the crumbs or the cinnamon.

I've made this 3 times and we love it. I've tried it both with the blueberry sauce and also a can of pie filling. I personally like it with a can of the pie filling plus about a cup of plain fresh berries. I used a broken u graham cracker crust for ease. This recipe is amazing- everyone who has tried it at our house raves. Thanks!

No calories here! (wink wink) Instead of blueberries I used mashed strawberries as I just went picking and wanted to use them up! Stayed true to everything else and it was just fabulous.

Very rich and delicious! But as others had mentioned, very, vey sweet.  I used two cups of frozen blueberries that we had picked last year, but kept the other ingredients to the blueberry sauce the same, and I used a quart of light cream and a pint (about 2 cups) heavy whipping cream for the ice cream, just because that's what I had.  I think I have a slight preference for "cheesecake" ice cream that is more a plain base with chunks of cheesecake in it, but this was still delicious.

It is funny to read the wide variety of reviews. Too sweet, too mild, not tart enough, too much crust, enough crust... I guess it is a matter of preference.  This recipe has a great flavor. I love the idea of making my own blueberry sauce. And the cheesecake addition made the ice cream not overly sweet.  Where I messed up, I think, is when I used 2% milk. The recipe is non-specific about the type of milk and I didn't think anything of it when I added our normal 2%. However, the ice cream was a bit ice milky and was NOT the texture I was going for. Still had great flavor though, don't get me wrong!   Next time I make this (which will be soon because it is a good recipe) I will either use whole milk or half and half for the 2 cups milk called for, and hopefully it will be creamier.

This Ice cream was so rich, creamy and wonderful.  I used blueberry pie filling and when I make it again I will make sure and chill the filling and the crust before adding because it made it almost too soft.  But I recommend it to everyone!!!!!

This ice cream is out of this world.  I made it for a family gathering and everyone went nuts over it.  It does taste just like the premium ice cream you might find in a gourmet ice cream shop, or maybe something Ben & Jerry's would put out.  

I used frozen strawberries (which I sliced) instead of blueberries and it was outrageous.  Very sweet and creamy and it did taste a lot like strawberry cheesecake.

The recipe is a little confusing because it doesn't say what to do with the extra ice cream mix that is left after you fill the ice cream freezer 2/3 full.  Do you use it later as part of this recipe?  Do you use it for another batch?  I read the recipe several times and was not sure, so I decided it must be extra to make another batch, so that is what I will do.  

Also, this amount of graham cracker mixture is (in my opinion) way too much.  I used about half of it, and it still seemed like a lot (the graham cracker mixture has the potential to overpower the flavor of the ice cream if you use too much of it.)  I think you can safely HALF the amounts for the graham cracker mixture and you will have plenty.

AMAZING!!  Followed recipe exactly and is it perfect!!  I too used graham crusts to make easier in this hot weather.   I really also loved the cream cheese ice cream out of the churning bucket!  That is pretty wonderful stuff all by itself.  One of the best recipes I have made from here and I have used and made hundreds!  Thank you Melissa!

Incredible ice cream!  So far, this is my favorite to make.  You can leave the blueberries in, they do not freeze into ice chunks at all.  The graham cracker crust does not get soggy, like I thought it would.  The blueberry syrup you make for this ice cream is also great as a pancake syrup as well!  This ice cream does not last long at my house, it seems to disappear rather quickly.

Made this for 4th of July and it was a big hit! Followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a graham cracker crust and a can of blueberry pie filling to make it easier. I thought it worked better to add the blueberries and the crust for the last little bit into the ice cream maker. It was better mixed that way. Also you might want to note that this makes a TON!

Best cheesecake ice cream I have ever had-I will puree the blueberry mixture next time, as another user commented, they do turn in to icy little orbs if left intact.  A little fussy as far as prep work is concerned, with all the layers; good thing it was a no-cook base.  I will try to cut the recipe down a bit too, it makes more than can fit in my ice cream freezer in one shot, and the freezer can't do a second batch without having to be re-frozen. But taste was very good!

Amazingly delish!  I think it takes longer than the 35 minutes on the recipe, but everything was wonderful.  I even had runny ice cream (because of my ice cream maker, not the recipe) and it froze just fine.  Will definitely make this again and will mix it up with different puddings / fruits.  (Strawberry / Chocolate :))

My church is having a picnic for the Fourth of July and asked everyone with an ice cream maker to bring a churn! I was testing recipes, and this one wins, hands down! It's different from the everyday flavors, and it's AMAZING! I took someone else's suggestion and threw in some store-bought blueberry pie filling and a graham cracker crust, and it made it so quick and easy so that I can quickly make more than one churn for the picnic!

This is so good! I used 1 quart of half and half, and 1 pint of heavy cream for the "milk". I omitted the graham crumble, and just made it as Blueberry Ice Cream. I also doubled the blueberry sauce as other writers suggested. Fantastic, will be a regular rotation in my summer treats! This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream, and I guess I lucked out on a good recipe! Thank you!

WOW! Wow wow wow. Delicious!    I used canned blueberry pie filling and omitted the graham cracker mix and it turned out great. I also used 3.5 oz of cream cheese instead of pudding.  There are still little bits (very little) in the ice cream but it is really good! Amazing.  I was so afraid it was going to be grainy, but it is so smooth and creamy.  Thank you for posting this recipe! I have been craving it ever since blue bunny discontinued theirs!

I wish I had added more lemon juice and slightly less sugar to my blueberry mixture.  Blueberries were in season here, so they were sweeter than usual (yummy!).  I would've liked more of a contrast between the ice cream's sweetness and the blueberry tartness.  I also made the graham crust in the recipe, but this can be simplified by buying a pre-made crust and breaking it into pieces.  I also added some cinnamon to the blueberries and graham crackers.  Very tasty!

This was delicious!!! I thought it was a little too sweet so next time, I will use a little less sugar and maybe half cheesecake and half vanilla pudding. I also let my batter chill in the fridge for 2 hours and then after layering the ingredients and swirling,  I stuck it directly in the freezer, taking it out every 30 minutes and mixing it up until the edges were completely frozen. The family loved it!

Wow, this recipe is labor intensive unless you take some shortcuts!  I didn't, but I'm glad I had some warning that bf wanted this ice cream.  he asked me this morning to make a blueberry ice cream, and when I found this I knew I had to make it.  He adores blueberries AND cheesecake, so I didn't have much choice.  I made the graham cracker crust and the blueberry sauce earlier in the day.  When bf came home with the instant chesecake filling and the milk, we made the ice cream.  He wanted me to use splenda and purchased sugar free cheesecake filling, so if anyone is curious to know if it works with sugar free ingredients, there you go.  It worked just fine.  I'm not the best at swirling (I understand the concept but can't really do it well), so it doesn't really look swirled--more mixed, but bf loved it.  Definitely it's a recipe he'll want me to make again.  Despite how time consuming it is, it really isn't that difficult.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY! This ice cream is so creamy and rich.  I usually use whole milk in ice cream recipes, but didn't have any for this one.  I used 2% milk and wouldn't do it any different.  It turns out so thick and creamy.  If you don't want whole blueberries, just cook them a little longer and they will pop open.

This is THE best home-made ice cream I've made to date - and I didn't change a thing!  I give it 5 stars for creaminess, texture, and simplicity.  The ice cream base is fantastic - so smooth and creamy - it will be my new vanilla ice cream base, period!  It's also extremely important to allow it to ripen after freezing - preferably overnight - as this will bring out the cheesecake flavor.  I still longed for a little more blueberry flavor, because it wasn't very pronounced, so maybe next time I'll add a little cinnamon to the blueberry sauce.  Thank you, Melissa, for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I thought this was really good. Be sure to read several reviews prior to making (I always do this with every recipe) and you'll have a 5 star ice cream with this one! Thanks for sharing!

I don't usually use pudding in my ice cream, so I was skeptical.  This was fantastic.  I cut the sugar to 1 C and used 2 C heavy whipping cream and 2 C whole milk.  Awesome!

Oh Yea! This has now become my all time favorite ice cream. I loved how the graham cracker crumbs did not get soggy and the blueberry sauce is delicious. The only thing I did differently was use almond extract instead of vanilla. I plan to make this at thanksgiving this year. Thank you!!!

A.Maz.Ing.  Seriously.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I mashed the blueberries in the sauce a little.  This was the best homemade ice cream I have ever made!

So incredibly good!  I even used reduced products (half-n-half, light butter, reduced fat graham crackers) to make it contain less calories- and it still turned out fantastic!!  Defiantly would recommend for hot summer days!  Next time I would mash up the berries just a little.

The concept of this recipe is fantastic - love the blueberry sauce and the graham crust. It is a lot of extra work but I think it's worth it to make it fresh (especially with fresh-picked blueberries). The ice cream itself needs some work. I don't like cooking with pudding mix and this confirms my opinion. It was too airy and soft and the flavor was just OK. I am going to look for a true cheesecake ice cream recipe for next time. Also, cut the graham cracker mix in half - that was plenty. The amount definitely overwhelmed my ice cream maker so make sure to do half one day and the other half the next day.

One of our favorites. Guests can't get enough. I make it with vanilla pudding instead of cheesecake but it's delicious nonetheless.

I made this when I had guests in from out of town.  It was a BIG hit and everybody kept eating it.  It takes a little bit to get through all the steps, but it is worth it--I highly recommend.

I really like using pudding as a stabilizer. I'm going to explore more options using the fluid to pudding amounts in this recipe. BUT, the ratios of cream to milk are way too high in this recipe giving a greasy mouth feel. I did the math on an online calculator and determined this milk/creams in this ice cream amount to 25% milkfat. Well no wonder it's so greasy. I'm going to try it next time using half and half for the whole thing and see what happens. I'm hopeful that the pudding will add the stabilizers to keep it from getting too icy and the lower milkfat will keep it from being too greasy.

Family thought it was delicous, but I wanted more cheesecake flavor. I don't think it helped that I used frozen blueberries. It was good, but next time, I will try less sugar and perhaps swirl in a bit of graham crust.

So GOOD!!! Made with Strawberries and got the small box of cheesecake pudding mix by mistake so I added 6 oz of cream cheese. I have a feeling it would have been better with the pudding mix only but still VERY GOOD!

Awesome recipe. I followed a previous poster's advice and purchased blueberry sauce and a graham cracker crust. My ice cream maker was not making it thick enough so I actually poured the mixture into the pre-made crust and added the blueberry sauce, and then swirled it a few times. It ended up being a blueberry cheesecake ice cream pie. It was a huge crowd pleaser.

The flavor of this recipe is delicious, and I actually used strawberries instead of blueberries.  I also didn't use all of my graham cracker crumbs.  My main problem that I had with this recipe was that it was too creamy.  It tasted more like frozen whipped cream with stuff stirred into it.  If I ever make it again, I might use my favorite vanilla ice cream recipe and put half a package of the cheesecake pudding mix.

WOW, this recipe is AMAZING!!! I put the graham cracker crust on a cookie sheet with a thinkness of 1/2 a centimeter. The ice cream batter I let chill for 2 hours before putting in my ice cream maker. When combining the topping, crust, and ice cream at the end I put 1/4 of the ice cream batter first then topped with 1/2 graham cracker crust then another 1/4 batter then blueberry topping and then another 1/4ice cream and the rest of graham cracker crust then folded the layers over themselves. This was an amazing ice cream, the blueberry wasn't overwhelming so double the blueberry topping if you want a more dominate blueberry flavoring. Very good all in all, this has become a family favorite overnight. I think next time I'll try this with strawberries instead.

O-M-G!!! This is the absolute best most heavenly ice cream that I have ever made and ever eaten.  Even my 13 r old said it was better than Coldstone. I used what was on hand - a quart of half & half, 1 cup cream, and 1 cup 2% milk (which I believe is basically 6 cups half and half).  I used a can of blueberry pie filling and 1 generic brand graham cracker pie crust. Mmmm...Mmmmm...YUM!

I made the recipe as directed Next time, I will cut back on the crumbs by about a cup and double the blueberry sauce.  It's yummy but the crumb crust was too crumbly and there was too much of it IMHO (and I wanted a bit more blueberry...)  Otherwise, it's a great flavor!  I plan to try the same recipe with other fruits/berries as well.

this is a great recipe. the only thing i will do different next time is puree the blueberry mixture (so youre not biting into frozen blueberry balls) and use maybe only half of the graham cracker crust mixture...it was hard to taste the actual icecream for all the crust! But so yummy and super sweet

Melissa, I'd give you 6 stars if they'd let me! This was just as good, if not better, than our local frozen custard place...and so much cheaper. Next time I'm going to put toasted pecans on top.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked the ice cream... but strangely enough, I thought it was too creamy.  I guess I am just a fan of the ice milk version of homemade ice cream.  :)

Incredible!!  So creamy and delicious! My husband didn't believe that I made this, he thought I bought it!  He said it was "ice cream shop worthy"!  This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream, and I will use this basic recipe (without blueberries and crust) and experiment with other ingredients as well.  Thank you!!

Followed the recipe except omitted the graham cracker crust part.  Icecream was waaaayy to sweet.  There must be alot of sugar in the pudding mix.  If I try this recipe again, I will reduce the sugar in the icecream.  I would really like to find a recipe that uses real cream cheese.

Chill ice cream ingredients mixed for at least 6 hours before hand (no longer or it won’t mix in machine).  Put in ice cream maker and blend for 20 minutes. Put in large bowl and mix in blueberries and graham crackers. Take out after a few hours and mix again. Amazing.
