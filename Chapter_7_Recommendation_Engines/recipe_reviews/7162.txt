Excellent coffee cake. I halved the recipe for my husband & me -- fits an 8x8x2 pan.  After it was cool we cut it in portions to freeze.  About 14 seconds in the microwave works super.

So gooey and cinnaminny!  Tastes like I'm eatin a Cinnabon cinnamin roll! I omitted the raisins.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  In the filling I added half of the nuts.  After pouring in the batter in the dish, I topped it off with the rest of the walnuts.  I used butter instead of margarine too.  Make sure your sourdough starter is at room temperature.   This is definitely a keeper!

This is one of the best coffee cake recipes I have enjoyed eating/making.  It came out moist, 
and wasn't dry days later.

This recipe, minus the glaze, is a staple I grew up on.  When I grew up, it took me years to track down the Herman starter again & still after all those years, the memory of this coffee cake made my mouth water!  Now I make it on a regular basis for my family & more & more friends after they've tried it.  It's amazing with the glaze!  A few variations I've tried- adding 1-2c. diced apples (dusted in flour & cinnamon) to the batter mixture.  I've changed out 1c. flour for whole wheat flour & it only slightly lowered the sweet bite, couldn't even tell ;-)  I also have tried it with raw sugar, opposed to the white sugar, & it didn't affect the final texture as raw sugar normally does.    The topping for this cake is supposed to sink down into the batter as it bakes, as that adds the swirls of intense flavor to the cake.  I always use a couple toothpicks & swirl the topping into the surface of the batter a bit, to even it out more.  If your sourdough starter is too runny, it will make the final batter wetter, all you need to do is add a bit more flour to the batter until it resembles a thick brownie batter, or the like.  OR, if you're already cooking it & realize- just bake it another 5min at a time until the center stops jiggling & you can slide a toothpick out of the center (not in a cinnamon swirl) clean.  All in all, this recipe is very forgiving & very agreeable to experimenting with variations!  It's definitely a favorite around here!!

Wow, this was really good...and I usually don't like coffee cakes at all.  I don't really like raisins so I omitted those, and I mixed the chopped nuts with the topping instead of mixing them with the cake batter... Other than that, I didn't make any changes.  The cake rose a LOT during baking...it turned out very light and fluffy.  My husband, who normally eats like a bird, ate 2 pieces.  I'll definitely be making more of this!

We used this as an after-school snack cake.  It went over pretty well, but will not be a favorite.

I have been making this coffee cake for probably 30 years and still love it.  Because it's so sweet I use just powdered sugar mixed with milk for the glaze.  It gives it a great appearance without adding a whole lot more fat/sugar and still allows the topping to remain crispy.

Our favorite variations include 3 cups of cut up apples along with the nuts and raisins or a large can of cut up peaches and the nuts.  I also use a little more cinnamon - 2 t.

For best flavor it is best to make the coffee cake a day ahead.  The flavor becomes more intense as the days pass.

The secret to success with the Herman starter is to keep it at room temperature and to avoid using metal spoons or bowls.

This is an excellent coffee cake! I used  Splenda brown sugar for the topping and it turned out very well.  The longer this cake sits the better it gets... by the 3rd day it was still moist and tasted better then the first day. I'm now baking these in 6" bundt pans. Once the topping gets solid I put them on plates and freeze them, then vacuum seal them and will be giving them out for Christmas gifts. My next batch I might hold off on the topping and do that once I take them out to thaw closer to Christmas.

This coffeecake was a complete failure. I had planned to take this to a potluck, but the weird texture just just too much to inflict on friends.  We thought it had a bread pudding texture that was not what I expected or wanted. My other comment is that the glaze is complete overkill.  It made my favorite feature of coffee cake, the crumb topping,   a mess.  It totally obliterated it into a mushy slop that made it seem like it was undercooked.  I agree with another reviewer's comments about texture. If you can get past the texture the flavor was good.

This coffee cake was good but I have made better ones without Herman starter. I did make a few changes. I ran out of sugar so I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar in the cake mix and I am glad I did because it had just the right amount of sweetness. I also cut the glaze in half and only used it on half of the cake. My husband like the sweet glazed half, I liked the unglazed half because the crumb topping stayed crispy and it was sweet enough without the glaze. If i make this again i will add instant vanilla pudding to the cake mix to get a moister                  cake

This cake did not work at all for me.  I guess my starter is a bit different, so maybe that was the problem.  My batter was extremely runny and the topping sunk down into it, so it took a long time to bake and even then the consistency was weird.  Any help?

So so good. A favorite in this house. Sometimes I put sliced peaches in the batter and use the peach juice for the glaze. Super good.

It was ok, too sweet and texture was heavy.  I prefer my coffee cakes on the lighter, fluffier side.  The glaze was overkill.

Loved this coffee cake!! I did not use the sweet starter, instead I used one that only started with a tablespoon of sugar.  But, it turned out great!  Tip-do not pour all of the glaze on top of the bread.  Instead, save some to warm up later  and pour a dollop on top of the cake slice and it tastes as good as it does right out of the oven.

I made this with 2 cups of Amish Friendship bread starter on baking day.  I used 1/2 the glaze amount called for in this recipe.  It was absolutely amazing!!!  I liked it better than the regular Friendship Bread.

so-so at best.  I found that this recipe had *way* too much sugar. So far this is my least favorite coffee cake of the ones I have made.  If I do it again (and I doubt I will) I would use half the sugar, or maybe eliminate it all togethr and up the honey a bit.

This coffee cake is amazing.  I feared it would be too sweet with the glaze, so that got left off, and the taste was perfect standing alone. This was my first use of Herman!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I love this recipe! I love that I have one more way to use my herman starter. I changed out the pecans for walnuts and added 1Tbs. molasses to the brown sugar topping mixture. Thank you so much for the excellent recipe! So says my wife but I don't like it says me, the husband and the real critic of foods. Oh how I long for Pilsbury swirly things with chemicals and sugar, sugar, sugar. Shouldn't leave these things open for your husbands to get in.

I did play around with this recipe a little bit.

I reduced the sugar in the batter to 2/3 cup
I added 1 large eating apple, chopped and 1 large eating apple grated 
I reduced the nuts to half a cup and scattered them over the top after baking
I reduced the topping by 50% 
Added extra cinnamon to the topping
I drizzled an icing glaze over the finished cake

This cake was seriously yummy - has to be in my top 3 cakes of all time . This recipe is a true keeper !

I baked in two 8" square silicone pans at 160deg c fan oven for 30 mins

This was Great! I used walnuts and added vanilla to the glaze. We love it with coffee.
