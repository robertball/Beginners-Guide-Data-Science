Having just made this recipe, I've got several comments to make:
First, technically this isn't a cheesecake. Rather these are cheesecake bars. That said, they're rather tasty and I'd make them again.
Next, for the reviewer that claims this isn't a recipe, here's the definition of recipe from Merriam-Webster:
 a set of instructions for making something from various ingredients. Clearly, this satisfies that definition. If you're denigrating the recipe for using store-bought dough, then you're welcome to make your own dough. 
Finally, a suggestion: if like me you bought logs of dough in the refrigerated section, I'd let one of them sit out along-side the cream cheese. I think it would be a lot easier to form the crust that way. The other log, definitely keep chilled; rather than pinching off bits and pieces for the top, I just sliced the log into thin slices; it covered the top admirably.

My only complaint is why do people always put sizes of ingredients that don't exist in the real world in recipes? I double dog dare you to find ANY chocolate chip cookie dough in 18oz size! I bought a Nestle Toll House 36oz tub and divided it in half. Worked well. Used 1 pkg regular cream cheese and 1 pkg low fat and it turned out great. Also substituted 3/4 c. Stevia for the white sugar (hey, gotta do what ya gotta do)! This is definitely a keeper!!!

Great dish!  I made my own chocolate chip cookie dough (tollhouse recipe) instead of the packaged dough.  I would say use about 1/2 the recipe for the crust and about 1/3 of the dough for the topping.  The rest you can put in the freezer for cookies.  I also lined my pan with parchment which I sprayed with cooking spray.  It made it very easy to lift out of the pan to cut. I think I’m going to win the super bowl party!

So very simple to make. I made one minor change. I couldn't find 18  oz. rolls of cookie dough. Only 16 1/2 oz. So I had to use a little of the 2nd roll to spread in the bottom of the pan. But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I found that it took the entire cooking time.  It was a big hit at my party and none was left at the end of the night and many people complimented me on how good it was. Will definitely make this again!

This was easy and DEElish. A couple of things I did differently were:

1. I used sugar cookie dough as a crust instead of chocolate chip (that would have been a bit too much chocolate). 

2. Before pouring in the cream cheese mixture,  I liberally drizzled the crust with caramel topping; you'll find it in your supermarket aisle with the ice cream toppings.

I stored mine in the refrigerator, but let it get a bit closer to room temperature before serving--about 40 minutes--because cold caramel is difficult to cut. It was a big hit.

Very easy to make and very good.  Don't worry about using the exact amount of cookie dough as in the recipe.   I might try just making the cookie dough myself the next time rather than getting store bought cookie dough.  With these ingredients it's hard to mess up.

I was a little hesitant to make this, not knowing if I would like this. I made it anyway and it's DELICIOUS. It's quick and easy. Kinda almost fool proof. Give it a whirl... you won't be disappointed.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and taking it to events where I needed a fast dessert.  I bake it in a jelly roll pan, so it makes lots of big bars.   It is the easiest recipe in the world to 'punt' substitutions for whatever you have on hand--M&M's, mini chocolate chips, raisins, Heath pieces, different cookie dough, etc.  If you don't have pre-made cookie dough, use a vanilla (or other) cake mix and the Cake Mix Cookies recipe instead. It works just as well.  I know--I've done it.  I add vanilla to my cheesecake part and use half the sugar just on personal taste.  I also mix chopped pecans in with the  reserved topping part of the cookie dough for texture and crunch.  When I am taking the bars to a more upscale event than a football tailgate, I drizzle with white chocolate and dark chocolate diagonally for a pretty effect.  Kids and adults love this and it's easy, fast and versatile.  What more could you want?

Very easy to make. I'm going to make this for my wife's school meeting coming up. She said was a little on the sweet side. I'm going to make a graham cracker crust for the bottom instead of using chocolate chip cookie dough to cut down on cost and sweetness.

Saw this recipe and decided to try it out to get the cream cheese out of my fridge before it expired.  Turns out I didn't have enough cream cheese, only half the amount, so I just halved the rest of the ingredients that involve the cheese.  I then made the cookie portion from scratch (as I don't buy pre-made cookie dough).  Nothing fancy, just the cookie recipe on the choc chip cookie bag.  I was going to use the exact amount of cookie dough specified but changed my mind and just used it all.  So, the recipe ended up with a lot more cookie dough than called for and half the amount of cream cheese...and it was great!  Seriously, it would be hard to mess this up, so feel free to experiment all you want.

There was no directions about using a nonstick pan or spraying the pan first. I used a 9x13 pyrex and it was very difficult to remove with out destroying.  Also how to serve ideas would be helpful. I tried to cut up into squares but again it was difficult to take out of pan- cookie dough bottom layer stuck to glass. What did other cooks do?

Easily halved (one egg, one package crm cheese etc.) and baked in an 8×8 dish. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written, and it is delicious! Simple enough for kids to help, and could be topped with an endless variety of fruit syrups, or a shake of powdered sugar to make it look fancy.

I halfed the recipe since there's just two of us.  I used an 8x8 pan.  Put parchment in the bottom and it was easy to get out of pan.  I also made a half recipe of real cookie dough (as I had all the ingredients).  It was delicious.  I'll be making this again.

Have made twice recently. On both occasions they were devoured, not a one remaining. I used the refrigerated dough purchasing the 16.5oz. roll and the 36oz. tub. Added 1 1/2oz of dough to the roll for the bottom, leaving the tub with plenty to work with for the top. Remaining dough is available for future use.

I made this recipe exact with only one exception, I used two teaspoons of a combination vanilla extract and hazelnut. My family loved it, very easy to throw together and make. It did take on the longer aide to cook as well.
