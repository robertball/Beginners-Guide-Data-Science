Easy and bursting with flavor. I adapted this recipe for whole chicken pieces. I just poured the marinade over it, and baked it uncovered at 400 for nearly an hour. I basted it every fifteen minutes and the results were fabulous.

This is a very good recipe.  I changed the chicken to thin sliced chicken breast and marinated it for about 1 hour.  It was excellent.

Excellent! I love to make chicken on Sundays for the week--for salads, quesadillas, whatever. This couldn't have been easier! I used all ingredients as is.. I did however use chicken breasts that i cut into strips. I marinated them for about 2 hours. Layed them out on cookie sheet with edge, and poured a little of the marinade onto them. Broiled for about 5 minutes on one side, turned them over, broiled about 3-5 minutes more. EXCELLENT. so juicy!! Had for dinner that night. a salad the next day and a quesadilla 2 days later and they were still juicy. Finally no dried chicken!!

This was very nice.  I did it as a satay (long strips of chicken on skewers) and served it on a salad with fresh bean sprouts and crispy rice noodles.  I also eliminated the chicken broth and did fresh ginger and fresh garlic.  It was light, delicious and very flavorful.

Very good, quick, easy and I had all of the ingredients already.  Tastes like my Grandma's (she's Japanese).  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it often.  I served it over steamed brocc.  It was closer to 3 or 4 servings though.

My family loved this recipe. I used fresh garlic (just because I had some) and I cooked the chicken under the broiler on a foil-lined baking sheet. I think maybe that helped give it more flavor because it was sitting in the marinade while it cooked. We will definitely be making this again!

I make chicken frequently and both myself and my husband had to admit that this was the absolutely juiciest chicken we have ever had.  A very very light marinade which is not overpowering but subtle.  I made some slight modifications.  I used boneless thighs (breasts always dry out on me) and marinated the chicken, a cubed red pepper and a cubed sweet onion "24 hours".  I then grilled these on the BBQ - indirect heat - as Kabobs.  Perfection!  A real keeper.

Excellent! I followed Chris's advice and added onions and peppers in the marinade. Left it aside overnight and the result was great. The chicken did absorb all the juice and in the skewers, it looked quite nice. Thank you!

The sauce tasted good, but I wish it stayed on the chicken.  The chicken was tender, but not very flavorful.  Unfortunately the best  caramelized sauce was under the broiling grill pan.  It would have been a 4+ if that was ON the skewers!!

I'm glad we have leftovers!  I used a Costco package of boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them into 2" pieces as directed by the recipe.  The only things I did different was to use less onions (I was low on green onions----thus the Grilled Vidalia Onions from this site), and I grilled rather than broiled the chicken.  It was delicious.  I served it with a green salad using the leftover marinade from the onions (an Italian dressing) and sticky (Calrose) rice.  Yum.  Can't wait until tomorrow night!

Juicy Chicken Haiku: "Wow, this WAS juicy. I changed the method a tad, but used same items." Read some reviews, and ended up marinating breasts that I'd cut into strips for several hrs. (Though it could've benefited from longer.) Baked directly on a foil-lined pan at 450 for 10 min., flipped, poured on more reserved sauce, then finished off for another 15 min. til browned and cooked thru. I was hoping to avoid the sauce-sliding-off (which truthfully, it did, since it was a very liquid-ey marinade) that many other reviewers commented on, but ultimately, the chicken, while on the tamer spectrum of flavor, was very juicy. I think the same sauce would be equally as good on salmon or pork chops, and I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great marinade/glaze.  I usually skip cooking it on the stove and mix the ingredients (other than the chicken) in a plastic ziplock bag.  Then I take bone-in chicken pieces without skin and marinade them for at least 20 minutes.  I dump the chicken and all the liquid into my baking dish and bake the whole thing at 350 for about an hour.  I also like that minor variations in wine type etc. still give great results but offer variety to taste.  Last night I used marsala cooking wine instead of wine and my husband said it was better than he remembered.

This was great!  It is very easy and quick.  I put the chicken over rice and poured the remaining sauce that I had left from basting.  It was terrific.

I liked the sauce, but do agree with the others that it did not "stick" on the chicken.  I think this would be better if it were marinated, and even grilled.  I think broiling would be fine if it were saturated in the sauce.  Other than that, I would make this again.

I've never broiled chicken on skewers in the oven before, but like most things I broil... it always surprises me how delicious and tender the food comes out! This is a keeper of a recipe! Delicious marinade and fabulous tasting chicken. I was looking for something just like this to serve with brown rice and steamed broccoli for a healthier meal and this nailed it. I did let my chicken marinate in the liquid for about an hour before cooking and it absorbed much of the flavor. A winner!

Great flavor. I didn't follow the recipe completely, so I didn't want to be misleading and give a 5 (but my meal was a 4.75). I didn't have skewers, so I cubed the chicken, dusted lightly in flour, little salt & pepper, then browned in veg oil.  Set that aside, then made the sauce & onions added some cubed zuccuni 1/2 through, and then threw the chicken back in when they were almost done.  Served over Uncle Ben's 90 second rice, and added some crushed honey roasted peanuts.  Quick, easy, and good.

Was excellent. The soy sauce/salty taste was a little much for me and I'll reduce the amount next time but over all great great recipe!

This was great, but I changed it a bit -I used fresh garlic. Then, after marinating, I added a bit of brown sugar to the marinade to make it a glaze. I added bell peppers and onions to my skewers, as well.

The marinade was pretty good and basic.  I broiled the chicken in a pan so the marinade could really get in there.  I would do this again

Wasn't horrible but for me it had little flavor. The rest of my family enjoyed it, but if you are looking for something robust. . .or nice and flavorful this is NOT it.

This recipe is good, like other review said the chicken in juicy and did not get dry, but one thing I need to reduce is the soy sauce, for me it is too salty for half cup, I ended a tsp of b.sugar to take off the saltiness. but overall it was good.

this was GOOD!  it was the best thing i've cooked in a long time.  i used another rater's advice and cubed a red pepper and also added half a sweet onion after i removed the marinade from the heat, then i marinated the chicken on skewers for an hour before cooking.  i served it with snow peas and jasmine rice.  SO good!  light but filling. i will definitely make again.
