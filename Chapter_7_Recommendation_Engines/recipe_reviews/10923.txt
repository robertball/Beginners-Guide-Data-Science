When I read the reviews about this recipe I had mixed feelings about making it. I went ahead and tried it anyways because I am a sucker for recipes with less ingredients. Less ingredients = more cookies for my family. The "bland" taste everyone is talking about is really not bad. It makes the cookie just right after you frost it. I even sugar coated a batch before cooking them and they tasted great also. I did experiece the Crumble effect while mixing the ingredients together. Don't add more sour cream, water, or liquid. Use your hands to mix it till you form dough. I chilled the dough for about an hour before I used it. Turned out GREAT. Easy to cut cookies out of. I rolled them to about 1/4 of an inch, they didn't puff way out and they did hold the shapes well. I would recommend this recipe to everyone. This one is a keeper!!!!

I use a family recipe almost identical to this one and I personally think it is the best sugar cookie recipe. These cookies are easy to work with and turn out soft. If you don't like hard sugar cookies, these are the cookies for you!  :)

I made these for a holiday potluck at work.  I've never tried making sugar cookies before, usually more of a butter cookie person myself, but these were fantastic!  They completely held their shape and baked up to become tender little morsels of rich cookie goodness!  I even went all out and decorated each cookie with homemade buttercream frosting.

All in all, it was a big hit at work as well as at home.  NOW i am getting constant requests for these tasty little sugar cookies.  Enjoy!

very good cookies for holiday decorating. They hold their shape very well & don't puff up too much...you need to roll them out about 1/4 of an inch.I make them every year for my Dad, he gets upset if I don't make at LEAST 4 dozen for him!

This has been the most successful sugar cookies I have made. I substituted white flour for wheat flour and it came out good. They stayed together and were soft. I only cooked these for about 7 to 8 minutes.

Don't see what others like about this recipe. They kinda taste like sweetened pie  crust - similar texture too. Not much flavor. As a fairly experienced baker, I expect more flavor from cookies.

This recipe was really easy to prepare and they turned out great! They are not very sweet cookies, so I recommend serving them iced.

Pretty good but a little on the bland side. Maybe will try again with a bit more sugar? Dough was easy to work with.

Wonderful recipe, seems to hold up well for kids to decorate and wrap.  Made several times over Christmas to many complements.  Made large heart shapes for "Heart for Haiti" fundraiser at church Sunday to rave reviews.   This is now my go to sugar cookie recipe.

My 7 year old and I just made these today using Halloween cut outs and they turned out fabulously. We frosted them with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe submitted by JBS BOX on this site (tripled the recipe). The end result was delicious and great looking.  Weâ€™ll definitely use this again for Christmas time!

not sure i'll make this recipe again. i was in search of a good sugar cookie recipe that was quick,easy and tasted great. although it was quick and easy, the cookies do not taste good. i followed it exactly, although i did roll them a bit thinner than recommended, that shouldn't take away from the taste. good thing for frosting.

I agree with others, they aren't very sweet. They're wonderful, however, with one of the powder sugar icing recipes and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

My mom use to have the best cookie recipe and over the years it has gotten lost.  This recipe is as close to her recipe as I could find. The only problem that I had with this recipe is that I had to make a double batch to even come close the amount of cookies that it stated it made.  The cookies were good and stayed soft from beginning to end.

I wish I didn't have to, but I have to second the person who said these tasted like sweetened pie crust.  I'd have to say it tasted more like plain pie crust.  I'm glad some people enjoy this recipe, but if you like a cookie with flavor and texture, I suggest moving on.

This recipe was pretty bland the first time I made it, but it's easily fixed by adding about 1 tsp. of grated lemon, lime, or orange zest! When I add some it improves the flavor, and I do get compliments after co-workers eat them.

These turned out rather bland as is, but sprinkling with sugar before baking and/or decorating with icing improved the flavor immensely.  Easy dough to work with.

WONDERFUL! So I changed the recipe on accident. As a mistake, I used 2c butter 2c sugar when I was creaming them together. Realizing my mistake, I added another 1/4c flour to my dry ingredients to compensate. Then in addition, I used 1 tea. of almond extract. This created a wonderful sweet, slightly nutty flavor that is absolutely devine! On their own, these cookies are a bit plain, but pair them with a little buttercream, and they are TO DIE FOR! Yum.

Should have listened to the reviews, but I was hoping they were just exaggerating. Definitely the most disappointing cookies I've made in awhile- very very bland, not even that great frosted. The texture was good, I like a cake-like cookie.

I don't know if I messed this up and I don't think so, but these were not what i expected.  They were hard and when i got the flour into the cream mixture, it was crumbly to the point I added more vanilla, sour cream and some milk.  Not a good recipe for me.

These were a huge hit!  Imade these for my husband's work party and they were gobbled up!  They were soft and delicious!  They held their shape and didn't puff up so they were easy to cut out and decorate. Will use these for all my holiday cookie decorating!

I wasn't very pleased with this recipe.    The taste was lacking, it didn't taste anything like a sugar cookie, too floury.  If you do decide to try this recipe be sure to roll it out very thin, it puffed up on me quite a bit, looked more like a pancake than a cookie.  The dough was very easy to work with!  I will continue to look for another sugar cookie recipe.

You are a god!!!

I searched and searched to no avail to find a decent sugar cookie that didn't yield to 200 calories a piece. And I've found it, and they're delicious! Thank you!

The texture of these were great, but lacked flavor.  It got mixed reviews from my family.  It's just an "o.k." recipe.  I will try a different one next year.

Not much flavor. Easy to make but need to add some taste - maybe a little lemon(?)

Bland but terrific if you add a sweet icing / frosting.  Perfect Christmas cookies with the little ones.

I have made these quite a few times & they have always turned out great! The only changes I made was that I increased the amount of sugar from 3/4 to 1 cup, & added 1 teas. of almond extract to give the dough some extra flavor. I always get compliments on how good they taste. They never last very long!

Perfect cookie to bake with kids/grandkids!  I have used this recipe for several years to bake cookies with the grandkids, they just can't screw it up, they are teens now, to busy, but I do have great memories of baking these with them..all 4..started when they were about 5.

Love this recipe because the cookie is sweet and moist. Most of the time my sugar cookies come out so dry but not with this recipe; it's very forgiving. I use lemon extract and a little lemon zest instead of vanilla.
