I really liked this recipe. Loved using Brioche to make french toast. I used the Brioche recipe on this site for the brioche. My only complaint about this recipe is that the strawberries need some sugar. I suppose it depends on how sweet your berries are, mine were sweet but not enough.  And I ended up thickening the berries with about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  This was easy and delicious.  I used the brioche recipe on this site to go with this and it was the best french toast ever!

Delicious!  Brioche is the way to go for real French toast, and who can go wrong with strawberries and whipped cream on top?!  Also try warm apples and cinnamon!

I made brioche yesterday in culinary school and my professor said that it made the best french toast and I had to try it. I found this recipe (didn't use the toppings) and it was amazing. The brioche soaks up so much of the eggs and cream mixture that the final result is almost custardy. I can see why this is the true french bread for french toast! While I have enjoyed challah in the past for this, the enriched eggy butteriness of brioche is perfect.

This recipe is AMAZING!  My husband said that it is restaurant quality.  I made a half batch and it was plenty for the two of us!  The brioche is a great change up from regular bread.  It is also great with raspberries or maple syrup!  Thank you for sharing!!!!

This dish was incredible!  I used Challah bread cut thickly.  We (2 of us) gobbled down half a loaf!  To save calories/fat  I sauteed apples in margarine for the topping and omitted the whipped cream.  Still decadent and so delicious!

Used Brioche off AR for this recipe. It was good but I had to double the strawberry syrup to have just enough. Next time I would also add a little sugar in the syrup.

I made french toast twice yesterday. The first time was my amateur way of just dipping bread into eggs. Then found this recipe and tried it again for dinner after a visit to the store for the missing ingredients I needed. Just the smell alone told us how yummy we could expect this time would be. The taste blew us away - it was the first time my husband really had good french toast. I didn't even whip the cream right this time (so I dribbled it on like syrup) and it was still so delightful. I want to try to whip it next time. I did make a simple mistake, but I think it paid off - I added the sugar and vanilla to the egg/cream mixture so all that flavor soaked into the bread too. I made this using gluten-free bread and my husband even worried a little asking me which bread I used (due to allergy) because he couldn't believe it tasted so great.

I used the brioche recipe on this site to make this french toast.  My husband liked it but I thought it was bleh.  The strawberry sauce was kind of tart.  If I make it again I will add some sugar.  The whipped cream wasn't too great but it may have been the heavy creamer I used.  I will probably make this again but with some changes.

This was the best French toast ever! I did not make the strawberry sauce, just used fresh strawberries mixed with a little vanilla sugar.  Be sure to soak for full  five minutes and cook to golden brown on griddle. The heavy cream takes it over the top with the egg mixture.

I loved this recipe. I made a brioche recipe (gasp!) from another website because I didn't have enough eggs to make the recipe on this one. I'd like to try it again after a grocery trip . . . with a more authentic brioche, but I imagine this would be tasty with regular bread or even Texas toast. The flavors were simply amazing!

So incredibly easy to make and hands down the BEST french toast we’ve ever had! I used Sarah Lee’s new brioche sliced bread and it turned out perfect. This will be my “go to” recipe for breakfast when we have overnight guests from now on.

This was very good! It was even better when I softened some cream cheese, added powdered sugar to the cream cheese and then spread it on the brioche before the strawberries. Delicious!!!

I made this recipe for my girlfriends on a weekend out and we all thought it was a big hit. I will make it again.
