This is a nice change to scrambled eggs.  I added green onions while cooking the tortillas. I’m not sure what kind of green sauce was intended, but I used the Tabasco green pepper sauce which has jalapeños (not green peppers), but not 1/2 cup.  I just sprinkled it over the top once plated.  I like the crunchy texture the tortillas add.
