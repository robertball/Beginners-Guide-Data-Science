I made this once for an office potluck, and now am asked to bring it every time (sigh…). I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cup. Also, made my own glaze with the following ingredients: cook 5 minutes 1 qt. Sliced berries, 1 cup sugar, 3 Tb cornstarch, and 1 Tb lime juice, add a little orange juice if glaze is too thick. Please note, the quart of strawberries used for the glaze is separate from the quart used for the topping. Once the glaze was prepared and had cooled, I stirred in the other quart of sliced fresh strawberries. Many compliments of how great tasting the fresh strawberries were, and quite a few comparisons to really good strawberry shortcake.  Once strawberry season had passed, I made this recipe with only frozen berries.  It still tasted good, but lacked the beautiful bright red color and texture of fresh strawberries.  I’ve made this with angel food cake, with pound cake, and with yellow cake.  I prefer the yellow cake.  Next time, I plan to divide the yellow cake batter between a 9 x 13 inch pan and an 8 inch square pan, so that there is enough room in the pans to layer on the toppings without crumbling up the cake.  It will look better when served.  The crumbled cake was a little messy.

This recipe was great on short notice, everyone loved it. The only thing I did not like about it was the strawberry glaze. I STRONGLY recommend you make your own glaze which is simple. I will make this again with my own glaze. If I was short on time I wouldn't use the store glaze...I would use no glaze at all.

Superb!  Added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese/whipped topping.  Fresh blueberries layered on the top for a little something extra and served in a trifle bowl for a beautiful presentation!  Loved this recipe!

This recipe is easy to make and very versatile.  It always gets lots of compliments when served in a trifle bowl.  If you take this dessert to a potluck, don't expect any leftovers!  They will lick the bowl clean.  Now for the changes...  I use 2 pounds of strawberries.  I fold about 2/3 of them into the glaze and use the remainder to garnish the top.  Storebought glaze is a great timesaver, but I make my own when I have time.  There are many different ways to make glaze.  Most often, I use a 3 oz. box of strawberry gelatin, 4 to 5 tablespoons of cornstarch, a cup of sugar, and 2 cups of boiling water.  Cook until thickened and let cool and you're ready to go!  I use the larger, 12 oz container of whipped topping.  I only used one 8-oz package of cream cheese the first time around because I only had one on hand.  It turned out fine, so I've never added more than 8 oz of cream cheese.  I also sweeten the whipped topping to taste, as a cup of sugar seem like too much for my family's taste.  I have always used storebought angel food cake but I'd like to try it with white cake from a mix.  My favorite thing about this recipe is that it is so versatile.  Blueberries, raspberries, and peaches would be great with the appropriate glazes. A blueberry/strawberry combo would be great for the 4th of July!

Great, easy, elegant dessert.  For Easter brunch I layered this in a trifle dish (2 layers of cake, 2 of cream cheese, 2 of strawberries)using reduced fat cream cheese and Cool Whip and Splenda instead of sugar.  Everyone raved about how light and delicious it was.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I was looking for a quick and easy dessert recipe for our neighborhood July 4th Dessert contest.  I used this recipe with a few variations.  Instead of strawberries and glaze, I used 2C fresh rasp-berries and 8 oz seedless raspberry jam thinned with 2TBSP Yukon Jack (orange flavored)liquor and 4 TBSP water.  The Recipe won FIRST PLACE!

This really is a great recipe.  Everyone loves it.  It makes a beautiful presentation in a trifle dish, which is what I use, or a large glass bowl; in fact, I've always called this recipe Strawberry Trifle.  The only thing I do differently is sweeten the strawberries overnight and drain off most of the excess liquid prior to assembling the next day.  Marie's makes a really nice strawberry glaze that you can usually find in the produce section of most grocery stores.  The glaze is essential, IMO.

I had my family all coming over for dessert and a coffee and they all asked for "Something different".  I had so many strawberries in my fridge and I was getting so sick of berries on top of Angel food cake that when I saw this recipe I couldn't help but try it.  My Family loved it!! Everyone wanted the recipe. I did make a few alterations to the recipe such as using Splenda instead of Sugar and just mashing up some strawberries and Splenda to make my own Glaze.  This can be a great recipe for someone who is watching their fat and sugar intake.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I was looking for something easy but tasty.  This was one of the biggest hits that I ever made.  Instead of the strawberries and glaze, I topped it with 2 cans of cherry pie filling and it was fantastic.  I have made it 2 more times since I got this recipe a month ago.

I was so excited to try this for a get-together I was having.  After I bought the ingredients and set out to start making this, I realized that most of the reviews involve changes to the recipe.  Well I decided to stick to the recipe and it was not good at all.  I found it dry and heavy.  The cream cheese was too thick.  It really needed to be lightened up.  The whole thing did not mesh well.  I was really disappointed.  I wish people would stop rating something 5 stars but completely change the recipe.

LOWER CALORIE/DIABETIC-FRIENDLY OPTION!!  I made this dessert and it was INCREDIBLE!!  I used a store-bought sugar-free angel food cake, Marzettis sugar-free strawberry glaze (could've used sugar-free jello to make but ran out of time!), fat-free cream cheese, Splenda in place of sugar (in the cream cheese), and fat-free whipped topping.  I served this at a family BBQ and NO ONE was the wiser that I'd made a "healthy" dessert!!  Total calories decreased to 75 calories per serving - if you serve 18 like the recipe says.  But you'd NEVER serve 18 with this recipe, it's more like 10-12, if even. Calorie count for a more realistic serving made with my changes...right around 160 for a GOOD-SIZED serving!!  Last tidbit...don't let the individual taste of sugar-free/fat-free ingredients fool you.  I'll just say that the sum of the parts of this recipe come together and are greater than the whole.  Definitely a recipe I'll make again and again!!

This is a great dessert to make for summer picnics.  I combine blueberries with the strawberries.  And I only use about 1/2 of the glaze that the recipe calls for.  I always get many compliments, and many requests for the recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it for "snack" at a lunch meeting, and everyone was asking for the recipe.
My changes:
*I made my own glaze as suggested by several other reviewers:  1 qt. Sliced berries, 1 cup sugar, 3 Tb cornstarch, and 1 Tb lime juice, cook 5 minutes, only I used the juice of the whole lime (prob more like 2 Tbsp).
*Used low fat cream cheese and cool whip - this is so delicious you can't tell the difference.
*Zested the lime into the cream cheese mixture.  It really added tons of flavor.
And i definitely agree that this needs to be layered into a large clear bowl or something similar.  Very pretty!

I followed the instructions in the review by SDOUGLAS to make this dessert lower in calories and fat: sugar-free angel food cake, fat-free cream cheese, Splenda instead of sugar, fat-free Cool Whip, and Marzetti's sugar-free strawberry glaze.  I layered it in a trifle bowl and topped with another 8-oz. tub of fat-free Cool Whip.  14-18 servings = 2 weight watchers points.  I took it to a dinner and everybody loved it!

This is a great recipe as written, but I did bake a boxed angel food cake which was super easy and used it and it made a huge difference taste wise. Also, I just don't like the fake taste of the strawberry glaze from the store. You can either make your own (3 TBS strawberry jello, 3 TBS cornstarch, 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar then boil until thickened and let cool and then fold your berries into it) or skip the glaze altogether and just toss your berries with a little sugar and spread on top. The filling is PLENTY sweet to offset the tartness of the berries. Delish!

Awesome recipe!  Saved the day for me.  Made 60 servings in clear 9 oz. cups.  Also used the glaze in one of the comments, which saved money but took an hour for the glaze to thicken, and turned out great.

I make something so similar and am asked to bring it to most family functions!  The main difference is I use powdered sugar and instead of strawberries I use canned cherry pie filling--I am not a cherry pie filling fan but I do like it in this recipe.  I also cube the cake and do layers of cake, filling, cream cheese mixture, ......

LOVED THIS! Instead of crumbling the cake I just ripped mine and it turned out perfect. I did two layers in 9x13 pan & to make it more Christmas festive, I added green food coloring to the whip cream. Makes a lot too. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar as other reviews said it was too sweet.  Will definitely make again.

This was a huge hit at a recent birthday party and I was told it was hands down the best dessert they've ever had!   I made several modifications, though.  Like others, I made my own glaze and used the easy recipe posted by others.  For the cake batter, I mixed the dry batter of yellow cake with the dry batter for banana nut muffins. Instead of the liquid ingredients on the box , I used 1 cup water, 1/3 cup oil, 1 small can of crushed pineapple (saved the juice to thin the glaze if needed), and 2/3 cup buttermilk instead of the eggs. The cake turned out amazingly moist and added a great flavor to the rest of the dessert!

Made my own glaze as suggested, used only 3/4 cup of sugar for both the glaze and cream cheese. Also used 1 package of non-fat cream cheese, 1 package of reduced fat and non-fat Cool Whip, still tasted great!

Made this for Mother's Day- SO yummy!  I also added less sugar than called for, only about 1/2 cup.  I used 2 quarts of strawberries and made my own glaze (2/3 c. sugar, 1 c. water, 4 tbsp. strawberry gelatin, 4 tbsp. cornstarch- boil until thick).  Layered in a trifle dish, it was both beautiful and delicious!

Really good twist on strawberry shortcake and feeds a good crowd. Best made a day ahead. Pretty in a trifle but ugly when you scoop it out. I used the "Buttermilk Pound Cake" recipe from this site . I have used both a version with whipped cream and a version with Cool Whip.Cool Whip holds up better but whipped cream taste wonderful. I don't like the fake glaze so I don't use it. If you let the sliced strawberries sit in a 1/2 cup of sugar, you don't need the glaze. They will get nice and juicy. I layer the strawberry next to the pound cake for better blending of the flavors. The cream cheese next to the pound cake creates a barrier and leaves the pound cake too dry. Next time I may cut back to half cream cheese for a more fluffy texture. Cream cheese layer is a little heavy.

This recipe was great!  I made my own angel food cake to try to cut down some of the sugar and I made this as a trifle.  I cubed the cake and made 2 layers as instructed in the original recipe.  I used strawberries and blackberries.  I also made my own strawberry glaze with 3/4 quart of strawberries in a sauce pan with 1 cup of splenda, splash of vanilla extract and 2 tsp of corn starch.  Once the strawberries were heated up (it happens quickly) I used my masher and let the sauce simmer a few minutes.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and lite cool whip.  I almost wish I doubled the cream cheese mixture, but honestly it was great as is.  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say is WOW!!  This is wonderful.  I added 2 tsp of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture, sweetened my strawberries with some sugar, and added only enough glaze to make the strawberries stick together.  This is so wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe for strawberry season! Instead of using a store bought glaze, I used a pint of strawberries, 2/3 c Splenda, 1 tbsp vanilla and cooked it down. Also, to make it a little more waist friendly, I used 1 LG pack of sugar free, jell-o cheesecake pudding w/ 3 cups skim milk and mixed in a container of sugar free cool whip, in lieu of the cream cheese and sugar. My son and husband LOVE this! And, the strawberry farm knows me by name...

Perfect summer dessert. I use light cool whip, only one low fat cream cheese, and enough glaze to coat but not drown the strawberries.  This makes quite a bit and I am always looking forward to the leftovers but there never are any. I brought this to a potluck with lots of deserts and this went first and was the only desert completely gone.

I made this using sugar free Angel Food cake, sugar free Cool Whip, sugar free strawberry glaze, 3/4 cup splenda and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Everyone in my "lunch bunch" wanted the receipe!  It was so good and much better for you without so much sugar.  My husband is a diabetic so I always try to cut the sugar out when possible.

Easy to make and very quick dessert to whip up.  However, next time I will not use fat-free cream cheese,the consistancy wasn't right.  Also I followed a recipe for strawberry glaze by another reviewer and I didnt like it.  Wish I could find a better recipe for strawberry glaze!  Until I find that I will look for another good potluck dessert but overall good.

Heavenly! Wonderful recipe for BBQs or 4th of July.  I used boxed mix for the cake, which made a lot, but the whole thing did fit a 9x13 pan.  Use a fork to tear apart the cake.  I put one layer of cake, then the cream cheese layer, another cake layer, and then the strawberry layer.  I used my strawberry pie recipe for the berry layer (cook 5 minutes 1 qt berries, 1 cup sugar, 3 Tb cornstarch, and 1 Tb lime juice, little water if thick).  This is a keeper, but next time I will use 12 oz Cool whip to make it more creamier.

This is a nice, light dessert and very easy to make.  I made the angel food cake from scratch and don't think its worth it.  Next time I will use a mix.  I used low fat cream cheese and cool whip and you would never know.  Also used a little over a pound of strawberries and next time will use closer to two pounds.  This would definitely be great mixed with other berries.  I bought a 12 ounce container of glaze and didn't use the whole thing, 18 ounces would definitely be too much.  A strawberry huller and egg slicer make the strawberry preparation a snap.  I made this on Saturday for serving on Sunday but the leftovers tasted better on Monday and even better on Tuesday.  Next time I will definitely make at least two days ahead.  This would make a colorful presentation on July 4th and also would look pretty split into two heart shaped pans on Valentine's Day.

I am new to cooking/baking so I found this recipe super easy and delicious! After making it several times now I feel like I can add my 2 cents. Everything is perfect but personally, I liked to use 12 oz of whipped cream or decrease the amount of cream cheese to 12 oz. However, no matter if I used the original 18 to 8 oz, I still had a hard time knowing exactly how long to whip them together (with the other ingredients) to make it 'light and fluffy'. The only thing I HAD to change was the glaze. I do not like the thick and super sugary store bought glaze so I made my own with an extra 1/2 container of strawberries, a little sugar, mashed them up and let sit for a while. The one thing I'm confused about after reading comments on other recipes is; is white sugar just regular old sugar or is it CONFECTIONERS SUGAR??? If so, maybe that's why my cream cheese/whipped cream isn't fluffing well. Anyone has advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for the recipe!! It's a keeper!

I love this recipe strawberries and cream cheese is delicious.  Only thing I did different was simply sugared my berries and let them make their own juice instead of using a glaze yummy and so summery!

This was super easy.  I wanted to use some fruit so I added more than just the strawberries and it just complemented the dish even more.  It was my first time using glaze other than for pie.  I'm glad I did.

As is I rate as a 4.  I did add extra whipping cream (about 1 c to the coolwhip) - I am not 100% fond of angel food cake but next time would use pound cake.   This cake actually tastes better the next day

Every time I make this I never have any leftovers, and if there is any left at the end of the night then it's a decision of who gets the last of it!  I do about 3 layers in a bowl and it's absolutely amazing! The angel food cake is perfect, not too heavy.

Amazingly delish!!  I used frozen strawberries since we were past the season...i can't get over how wonderful this was.  I followed MANDT2 glaze recipe and used less sugar with the cream cheese.  Absolutely perfect, and quick!

This is a great recipe, however I do not like strawberry glaze. So I combined a container of fresh strawberries with a tub of frozen strawberries. Because they are frozen in a juice they made for a thin glaze. You could heat on stove and add corn starch if you want thicker. It was a HUGE hit at a party. I could just eat the strawberries and cream cheese mix too!

this recipe would have been better without the glaze.  I don't know if the glaze I bought wasn't good, but it had a very strange taste.  Next time I would just put sugar on the strawberries beforehand and let a syrup form before putting them on top.  it was very easy though.

This is amazing delicious! I used a little less sugar - 3/4  cup and made my own glazed strawberries using a pint of strawberries, 2/3 cup sugar and 2tbs of cornstarch. Bring the berries and sugar to a boil at medium heat then mix the 2tbs cornstarch with about a half  cup warm water and slowly stir into berry mixture. Boil 2-3 more minutes until thickened then let it cool off before putting topping on dessert. Everyone will love it!!!

I didn't read all the reviews on this one however my "go to" potluck recipe is this one except instead of using strawberries, use a can of cherry pie filling.  I put everything together but put the cherries on the top (not layered but you could if you like the looks of it).  It looks pretty and taste delicious.  My recipe is called "Cherries in a Cloud".

This was an excellent and easy recipe.  With the cream cheese, it tastes a little like cheesecake, which is my husband's favorite dessert, but this is so much easier than cheesecake.  I made it just as the recipe stated and thought it was great...I am sure it would be hard to improve.

This was great! I layered the items in clear, plastic cups for individual servings.  I also ran out of strawberries, so added some sliced bananas instead. Delicious!

A big hit at our cookout.  Easy and delicious.  I  will definitely make this again.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it could be easily tweaked to individual tastes.

I've been making this dessert for years, but I prepare it in individual short stemmed wine glasses for a touch of elegance.  It's also great for pot lucks when you use disposable plastic wine glasses.  To cut expense, eliminate the cream cheese and use sweetened whipped cream only in the layers of cake and berries.  Delicious!

In a word... DELICIOUS! Didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect. Ok I take that back, I layered it in a glass bowl rather than spreading it out in a 9x13 pan with only one layer. (For presentation purposes only) But the ingredients I followed to the letter and it is amazing.

Used this recipe for a church dinner and got lots of compliments. Adjusted it a little by adding instant banana pudding and milk to the cream cheese mixture. This gave it another layer of flavor that was really unexpected. Made my own glaze by smashing up 1 pt of berries and 1/2 cup sugar. Throw the remainder of the berries into the glaze and mix. It layered beautifully and I received several compliments on it yumminess!

Made a few changes based on what I had at home, but this dessert turned out great and delicious! Tastes just like a strawberry shortcake.  Modifications:  Used white cake (instead of angel food)  Used home made freezer strawberry jam (instead of strawberry glaze)  But the most beautiful dessert to serve, but oh so good!

This was great!  I followed the advice and made my own glaze (1 1/4 cup strawberries blended with 1/4 water, then boiled with 1 cup sugar and 3 tbsp cornstarch) and doubled the amount of strawberries.  Will do again, and again.

Simply divine! I skipped the glaze and sweetened the strawberries with sugar and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours. I also decreased the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 3/4 cup as others suggested. I made angel food cake from a mix, and even though I overcooked it, it didn't matter. My 7 housemates and I gobbled this up in under 15 minutes, it was so good!

I made this with Splenda, light cream cheese and light cool whip and everyone STILL loved it - and this was not a low-fat crowd. I didn't use any glaze and sweetened the berries with a little bit of Splenda before adding them. Great recipe - Thanks!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and it is so fast and easy. I don't like glaze so I was going to leave it out but I decided to take the advice of someone else's review and made my own glaze following her recipe (1 c sugar, 1 qt strawberries, 1 T lime juice, 3 T corn starch, and if it's too thick add a little bit of orange juice (I used peach because I didn't have orange). My friends are always asking me to make this when we have dinner.

Awesome, took to a bbq went over big. Nice light dessert too. I used low fat, used sugar free strawberry topping and plenty of fresh strawberries and cut the recipe i half for a smaller batch.

Delicious! Instead of adding a jar of glaze I made my own. I only added a half of cup of sugar and 12 oz of 1/3 fat cream cheese into the whipped topping (still used 8 oz of whipped cream).

Didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it still came out great!! For the glaze, I used strawberry pie filling, watered it down a bit and added some sugar. And I used the shortcake cups instead of angel food. I think the angel food would have been better, but I still loved this recipe. The whipped/cream cheese topping is not too sweet and compliments the strawberries. Mmmm! Will definitely make this again!

This will be a staple at our house, it was a very quick and delish weekday dessert.  I took MAMALEIGH advice and made my own glaze from her directions and it was absolutely fabulous, thanks MAMALEIGH.  I can't say enough about how quick and delish this recipe was.  Great Job!!

Yummy! This is a lovely dessert. I did use only 1 cream cheese and it was low fat along with fat free Cool Whip.  I also like to make my own strawberry glaze with jello, sugar and cornstarch. There is a recipe posted for the glaze on this site. You'll won't regret making your own glaze, it's so much better than pre-made from the grocers.

I tried this recipe on a whim when my daughter visited from college.  She had requested a 'home cooked' meal, so I decided to make this for dessert.  Not only was it a 'no brainer' to prepare, but it was absolutely delicious!  I had to send her back to college with the left-overs as well as the recipe. I prepared it exactly as the posted recipe suggests - did not make any changes..nor can I see any reason to do so.

Excellent!  Everyone in the house loved it.  The cream cheese takes it to another level! The only thing I did different was make the Angel Food Cake with Duncan Hines cake mix instead of purchasing an already made cake and used raw sugar instead of white sugar! It was a big hit!

FANTASTIC! I made it for a birthday, and it was well received. I baked my own cake and made fresh whipped cream instead of using Cool Whip. (I sweetened it a bit) I used my glass punch bowl and piped extra whipped cream around the top. It looked great and tasted even better!

I have made this twice already and each time everyone loved it! I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture to give it a little more cheesecake flavor and used only enough glaze to fully coat the strawberries. It was so simple to make and got rave reviews. Highly recommended for a quick, easy dessert that everyone will love.

This dessert is so yummy and super easy!  At the suggestion of another reviewer I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture to give it some added flavor.  Also, I could not find strawberry glaze and didn't want to make my own, so I bought a can of strawberry pie filling and mixed that with the strawberries instead and it came out great.  I will be making this for all of our summer parties this year.

I made this today with store bought (frozen pound cake - 2 of them) to take to a pool party.  I made it as is with store bought Marie's strawberry glaze and the only thing I changed was doubleing the strawberries.  It was delicious and everyone loved it!  Next time I will triple the strawberries.  I cut the pound cake into cubes and small rectangles in fear of the cake getting too mushy, and I'm glad I did.  It was literaly like eating strawberry shortcake.  I couldn't find a trifle dish, so used a glass bowl with straight sides.  It looked very nice.  Next time (if I have more time),I might try making my own glaze and/or pound cake.  But honestly, it's really good as is and I got a lot of compliments even though everyone knew it was all store bought. :)  I do recommend layering, and cutting pieces instead of crumbling. Oh, I didn't use all of the whipped cream - as it's just a personal preference (but used 3/4 of it) and only 1/2 of the glaze.

Update:  5/27/14:  Have made this twice now.  Exactly as the recipe states.  And the second most recent time, I made everything from scratch, homemade poundcake, homemade whipped cream, homemade glaze (all recipes found on this site).  I got rave reviews both times. When you make it as the recipe states, everyone knows you just threw store bought ingredients together but still raves about it.  Making everything from scratch is really really good, but SOO much more time consuming.  I don't think you can go wrong either way.

I made my own strawberry glaze per another reviewer's suggestion and this was simply wonderful - used angel food cake and it was perfectly consistent (not soggy) several days after the 1st serving. This is a really good recipe and treat!

I needed a quick dessert for friends coming over and this was quick, easy, and yummy! I only used 12 oz of cream cheese as someone else suggested and mixed 1 qt fresh strawberries halved with one box frozen sweet strawberry halves in syrup that I thawed in the microwave. When I make it again I will try something other than the froZen strawberries only because of their color and texture. But they tasted wonderful! Thanks for sharing this delicious, quick, easy recipe.

The best and easiest dessert!!  A hit an any occasion. The only thing I do differently is use Fat Free Cream Cheese and Fat Free Cool Whip to ease up on the fat and calories.  Absouletly delicious!

This was excellent :).  I didn't use the strawberry glaze, and it really didn't need it.  I also added some fresh blueberries to the top. It was quick, and easy to make.  I brought it to my church and had many compliments.  I will definitely make this again.
Thank You!

I made this yesterday for our Memorial Day BBQ and it was a hit! Everyone raved about it and wanted to know how to make it. I made my own angel food cake from scratch from this site (angel food cake I), and made my own strawberry glaze also from this site (strawberry glazed pie). I sprinkled fresh blueberries on the cake before I added the cream cheese mixture to stick with a red, white and blue theme. It came out beautifully! There are ZERO leftovers!

I can't tell you how many times I've made this.  It's a huge hit everytime.  Perfect.  I do a "diet" version.  Splenda, low fat cr. cheese, sugar free glaze.  You just don't miss all the bad stuff.

The one thing about this that I didn't like is that the presentation looked wonderful from the bowl, but once it gets to the plate, it does not show well.  That is the only reason for 4 stars.  Very tasty though.  I fixed it for my family last night.  I had been reading the reviews for 2 days on this recipe.  I didn't tell the fam what I was preparing, because if I screwed it up, they wouldn't know what it was supposed to be!  Once they tasted it, they all just loved it!  Even my daughter who hates strawberries loved it.  It was gone within 30 minutes!  Everyone had a second helping.  My son said to me that if this was something I messed up, he'd like me to mess this up again tonight!!

I have made this recipe several times this summer and it is always a big hit. It is very addictive. Instead of using strawberry glaze, I used strawberry pie filling and layer that on top of the angle food cake. I then added the cream cheese/whipped cream topping and decorated with fresh strawberries on top. Delicious

This was very good, although it was pretty much exactly the same as my much easier made strawberry shortcake minus all the effort. However, I thought the whip cream mix was to die for!  I will use that part of the recipe as maybe a fruit dip or something.

I needed a quick and easy recipe for a last minute block party. This was a HIT! The two changes I made was only using a couple of tablespoons of strawberry preservatives and adding blueberries to the mix. If you use a whole jar of preservatives, it would have ruined it. I suggest getting either 2 rounds of 10 inch angel food cake OR a whole container of the pre-sliced angel food cake. I felt it wasn't enough cake. Otherwise, this is a keeper and will plan to use it more often.

So so so great!  I made this for a BBQ and it got amazing reviews.  I couldn't find strawberry glaze so i made my own (strawberries, frozen blueberries, sugar/splenda mix, and cornstarch over medium heat).  I also used fresh strawberries and blueberries. We also used low fat cream cheese - i would love to try using fat free cream cheese and cool whip, plus all splenda instead of sugar - would make a great low fat treat!

Instead of making a glaze, I used a jar or strawberry jam that I heated in the microwave for about a minute until melted and liquidy.

This is delicious.  I've been making this for a few years now, but I do make one change.  I use one package of fresh strawberries( I believe it's one pound), sliced, and mix it with one can of cherry pie filling.  It's so yummy and no need to buy glaze.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this last weekend for a party and have had many requests to make again for tonights cookout!  I used low fat cool whip and low fat cream cheese and no one noticed.  I also made my own glaze like suggested.

This dessert is easy, fast and delicious! Instead of using the supermarket artificial glaze I make the Supreme Strawberry Topping (from this site). My picky teenager son loves this!

This was the best dessert ever!! The sour cream angel food cake really made this special. I just covered the berries with sugar instead of the glaze and I thought that made it taste fresher. After reading the recipe I thought this would just be a dressed up strawberry shortcake but it wasn't. It is very good and I definitely recommend this recipe.

I made this for my mom's birthday on the 14th July and she totally loved it. She says it was thee most delicious desert she's has ever tasted. But u know moms.  My birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks and I will make one for me and sister's birthday. It is a 5 star recipe but I would use 1/2 cup sugar next time because it is a little sweet to me. But it is a very fancy desert.  And I made my angel food from Angel Food III. That's thee best Angel food cake I have ever tasted. This desert is deifntely too die for. AWESOME ! !

Love this!  Because mine was for a July 4th event, I madei it more festive by reserving a bit of the filling and piping it onto the top, then topped each "star" with a blueberry.  Also, I made my own glaze (I had extra strawberries) following the previous poster's recipe suggestion.  They didn't mention this, but I drained the strawberries out of the glaze, and I think it should have cooked more than the recommended 5 minutes, as it's a little runny.

I used splenda and only added 3/4 cups. I also used sugar free whip cream and sugar free strawberry glaze. Also only added enough glaze to cover strawberries. I also doubled the strawberries. This was great.

Awesome recipe and very simple to make. Did as others suggested and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and also left out the strawberry glaze. I just tossed the fresh strawberries in sugar and let sit in the fridge for a couple hours. Was just perfect and enjoyed by all.  Will definitely make again!

This was great. Had cream cheese that needed used so made this and took it to work. I decreased the sugar by a bit and used strawberry cool whip-yum.

Made this night before for birthday party at work.  Everyone loved it!  I was asked to make this again. 

I followed other recommendations using 3/4 cup sugar, skipped the glaze but sprinkled sugar on the strawberries and let them sit.  I used sugar free whipped cream and you couldn't taste the "fake" imitation sugar at all.  I used store bought strawberry angel food cake; no worries about soggy cake.  Got a good seal with the cream cheese mixture as another reviewer stated.

I just made this for my husband and his friends who loved it.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I made my own glaze with the recipe shared by other reviewers (thanks!), and I decreased the sugar in the cream cheese layer to 3/4 cup.  I cubed a store-bought angel food cake, put it in a 9x13 pan, and continued to layer as directed.  I made this the night before they ate it (the cake mellowed in the fridge for about 20 hours) and my husband reported to me the texture was still-cakey, somewhat mellowed, but not at all runny or soaked.  I had purposely sealed the strawberries/glaze from the cake with the cream cheese layer and he thought this helped.  He liked the texture as-is but added that he thought it would have still been good eaten later, (I quizzed him) so if anyone is concerned about making ahead, it seems to be just fine.  (I wish I'd gotten a bite!) Thank you for the recipe.  I'm thinking of using this for a large summer party!

Okay...I think the best result would have been making the angel food cake not buying it premade...I believe it ruined the whole thing... :(

I made this without the strawberry glaze because I couldn't find it at the store. It was still very good and I got compliments and requests for the recipe. Next time I would try the glaze if I could find it. Also, I think I'd cut the cream cheese/Cool Whip layer in half since it was too rich for my taste. And, I'd try adding shaved chocolate on the top. Yum!

Decided to make this into a trifle for my mother's 94th birthday using her old trifle bowl. Made my own cake using angel food cake mix, made the glaze using strawberry jello, cornstarch, & boiling water; after it cooled I mixed with the sliced strawberries. I followed the layering order and the layers all mingle in a rich, almost cheesecake-like flavor--it was delicious. The trifle was a pretty presentation, and everyone loved it. This is going on my 5-star list--thanks for a super recipe Kelli.

Very quick and easy dessert... and very good.  I didn't use as much glaze as called for, just enough to cover the strawberries.  It would be just as good if you sprinkled the strawberries with sugar and allowed them to sit a little while, instead of glazing them.

Scrumptious and easy!  Use an egg slicer to slice the strawberries.  Cuts the time in half!

This reminds me of a recipe called pretzel salad (see "Judy's Strawberry Pretzel Salad" here on allrecipes). The major difference is instead of crushed pretzels for the bottom layer this recipe uses angel food cake.  I recently made this for an adult birthday party and it went over extremely well.  It is light (in weight) and not too sweet tasting.  I used sugar free glaze and added just a little sugar to it and used store bought angel food cake.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipie! Everyone loved it.  I used all lowfat ingredients with great results. I omitted the strawberry glaze as suggested by others and pureed fresh stawberries with a little sugar for the "glaze", topped with sliced stawberries and it tasted great!  I've made it twice so far.

This was really good and very easy to make.  I wasn't sure how much Cool Whip to put (because it was in liters and I didn't feel like measuring) so I put the whole tub in (1 liter) and it was really good.  I used light cream cheese and light cool whip and did not have any problems.  I cooled it in the refrigerator overnight.  As other people suggested, I ommitted the glaze and topped with strawberries and peaches and thought it was sweet/flavourful enough.  Would definitely make again.

An easy variation on  regular strawberry shortcake and much easier to take to a gathering.  We loved it. Instead of using the strawberry glaze I pureed frozen strawberries in sugar and then sliced the fresh strawberries into it.  It was delicious.  I will definitly make it again and again and again and again.

Very easy to make. Quick, no bake, and with strawberries and cream cheese it's sure to be a hit with guests.  Only drawback was when cutting, the shape did not hold well.

This is a fabulous dessert and enjoyed by all.  If you are in a pinch and do not have the strawberry glaze, make your own - 
Strawberry Glaze - Boil 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar until sugar is dissolved.  Mix 3 tablespoons corn starch with ½ cup water.  Add to boiling sugar water until thick.  Remove from heat.  Stir in 1 small box of strawberry jello.  Stir in berries.

This recipe is delicious. I haven't tried it with store bought glaze. I followed MANDT2's glaze recipe: 1 quart strawberries, 3tbsp corn starch, 1 c sugar, 1 tbsp lime juice. I've gotten rave reviews from friends who've tried it. It's so easy to make too! Definitely a keeper.

Simply amazing! First time I made it with the strawberry glaze I wasn't too happy with the processed taste. So the second time I changed it to marinating the sliced strawberries in some confectioners sugar overnight before putting them on an hour prior to eating and it was a big hit!

I took this to a 4th of July picnic.  It was a hit and several people asked me for this recipe.  I agree with MANDT2's review and made my own strawberry glaze by buying an extra quart of strawberries.  Cook them for 5 minutes with a cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of corn starch.  I used a deep 9X13 pan and topped it with a layer of cool whip and fresh strawberries.  Delish!

Tasty recipe but hard to layer. Should've let the cream cheese mixture get to room temperature, it was too difficult to spread. And I'm not a big fan of strawberry glaze I only used a tiny bit for this recipe and it was enough. (Just enough to make the strawberries spreadable)

This one gets rave reviews from the family. I don't crumble the angel food cake, I cut it with a serated knife and arrange it on the bottom of the pan. I cut back on the sugar to about 3/4 cup or less. I could not find a jar gel could only find a package of powder called red gel. I whip my own cream, never use the frozen stuff.

Made this for the first time.  Roughly doubled the recipe but only used 3 8oz cream cheese and somewhat less than a double on the whip and a lot less glaze.  Everyone really liked it and the whole bowl was finished up.

I have no cooking/baking skills whatsoever, but I was given a task to bring dessert to a Thanksgiving family dinner. This recipe was not only simple, but very delicious! It was a hit! I lightened up on the strawberry glaze (just used on one layer) and added blueberries in with the strawberries. Highly recommend!

This cake was a little too heavy and rich. My family would much more have preferred to have had the cream cheese excluded. Would have been better if it had been light and fluffy :)

I made it just as directed (well, omitted one cream cheese and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and increased cool whip to 12 oz.  Used strawberry pie filling instead of glaze.) and it was fabulous.  I then made it w/ yellow cake, blueberries, blueberry pie filling and the exact rest of the ingredients (except strawberries/glaze) and excellent also- just like blueberry cheesecake!

A huge hit amongst all of my friends. I prepared it in a trifle layering the angel food cake, the cream cheese / whip cream mixture and then the strawberries.  Make sure you leave some extra strawberries and cream cheese mixture to decorate the top.  I wasn't able to find any strawberry glaze, so I just pureed some strawberry pie filling and it worked just as well.  It is a dessert that takes 15 minutes to prepare but looks like you were cooking all day.

Awesome.  I made my own strawberry glaze per someone elses recommendation.  I think that made a big difference.  I used low fat cream cheese and whipped topping.  I was asked for the recipe.

Wonderful dessert! I used local blueberries and strawberries, and I crumbled some soft chocolate brownies in with the angel food cake. I also whipped heavy cream with confectioners sugar and vanilla instead of the frozen whipped topping.  For family holiday dinners I'm going to layer it in individual parfait glasses

Easy and everyone loves it.  I do recommend making your own glaze.  It is easy and tasted 100% better.  I added blueberries to it for color and to down place sweetness.

Very addicting.  The only thing we did different was replaced the glaze with a can of strawberry filling.  We mixed the filling with the fresh strawberries, used a trifle bowl and layered the strawberry mix directly over the cake so the cake had a little bit of strawberry juice soaked into it. MMMMMMM......

AWESOME!!! You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  It is always a big hit whenever I serve this for dessert.  Once people taste it they always go back for seconds or more.  I never buy strawberry glaze but make my own.  I just take frozen strawberries, thaw them a little bit and then blend them with a little sugar.  That becomes my strawberry glaze.  Cheaper and taste just as good.  You could just use fresh strawberries as well, but I always have frozen strawberries on hand so I use those for the glaze, and use fresh strawberries for the rest of the dessert.

Made this for company and it was so delicious! We all had seconds and there was next-to-nothing leftover. I made a few changes. I did not use the glaze. I simply cut up fresh strawberries and then put a smidge of sugar on to sweeten them up. I used low fat Cool Whip and light cream cheese and lowered the added sugar to a 1/2 cup. I layered it in a trifle bowl. It was DELICIOUS! Thank you! Will definitely be making this again.

I have made this tons of times.  I substitute the angel food cake for pound cake & use homemade strawberry topping (from this site) instead of the storebought glaze.  I also double the cream cheese mixture.  Like other, I layer mine in a bowl as a triffle.

I made this for my friend as a christmas present.  while i didn't have any myself, i got this text message from her: 
"OMG ur cake is INCREDIBLE.  Thank u so much seriously i could like eat the whole thing". 

I used strawberry flavored cool whip instead of regular to make it pink and to make it taste like more of a strawberry cake.  I also sprinkled powdered sugar over the strawberries once they were glazed. 

I couldn't find "glaze" so i just used strawberry sundae topping.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. This has got to be one of the BEST desserts EVER, and really not that unhealhty if you use low-fat ingredients.  Make sure your cream cheese is nice and soft before you need it, otherwise it will be lumpy.

Everybody loved this at my barbecue! I made it in a glass dish so all the pretty layers were visible. I cut the angel food cake into small cubes instead of trying to crumble it by hand. The taste is delicious, even if the strawberries aren't the sweetest.

I made this recipe for a potluck at work.  Everyone raved over this dessert!  I changed the recipe just a tad though.  I used about 3/4 cup of sugar, substitue regular cream cheese for the low fat version, substitue whipped cream for low fat version, used 2lbs of fresh strawberries, and I pureed fresh strawberries and a little sugar (poured just over one cup liquid in the fresh strawberries) for the glaze.  I think the store bought strawberry glaze is too sweet and artificial tasting.  I'm definitely making this again very soon!!!

I'm not huge into desserts (unless we're talking chocolate), but my hubby is- this was a hit! I made it months and months ago and he still talks about it. He's a dessert fanatic and claims this one is the best ever. I love baking and often make complicated items and was surprised such an easy recipe had such ratings with him. Go figure! I thought it was a great summertime recipe and easy on my time.

 I added blueberries and used along with the strawberries. I didn't use any glaze as I figured it would be sweetness overkill. Instead, I made some lightly sweetened syrup myself from the berry juice.

Yummy!  It almost felt healthy with the light fluffy cake and strawberries.  I'm a huge fan of all the ingredients (individually) so I thought that putting them all together in this dessert sounded very tasty - and it was!

Yummy!  This is best if you bake your own angel food cake and crumble it in the pan while it is still slightly warm (it's easier to work with).  I've tried it with a pre-made cake purchased from a bakery, and it's not quite as good.

Great recipe, especially for the summer.  My family loves strawberries.  I did not use as much glaze as it calls for the 2nd time I made it.  Seemed to like it better that way.  Still Yummy!  I made in a trifle bowl....very pretty too.

This was a wonderful summer dessert!  I used a combination of strawberries and blueberries, and reduced the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to slightly more than 1/2 cup. I also only used 1/2 container of strawberry glaze because we don't like desserts too sweet. I can't wait to make this again.

Delicious and very easy to make. I only used half a cup of sugar and used strawberry jam as the topping and it turned out delicious and not too sweet. Everyone really loved  it. I will definately make it again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a big hit at a family party.  Very refreshing ~ something I would definitely make a lot of in the summer.  I used the light cream cheese and light cool whip ~ my family raved over this!

I was looking for a quick dessert to take to a dinner and this was awesome!  I used 2 packages of "short cake" dessert cups since they didn't have angel food at the store and frozen strawberries from my garden. I'll make this one a family classic!

The strawberry glaze I used wasn't very good - maybe I'll try some form of jello next time.

I used 3/4 cup sugar in the cream cheese mixture as suggested by others and I bought an already made $6 angel food cake, I DID NOT make my own glaze, I just bought a can of strawberry pie filling. This recipe was so quick, so easy,  pretty and so delicious! It was devoured, no left overs! I will be making this again, this recipe is sure to impress!

Loved this!  It got devoured??
I made as directed with angel food cake and cream cheese/whipped topping (yummm!). I wasn't sure how big a QUART of strawberries was but I used 2 lbs and wished I had used more!  I made the glaze myself as others suggested. Was truly delicious!

Oh, and one more thing to add to my previous review: the only thing you should change about this recipe is the strawberry glaze. The flavor is much better if you only add one container if glaze!

I have made this dessert for a long time.  It's always a hit with everyone.  I do substitute Splenda for the sugar and use sugarfree whipped topping as I am diabetic.  Also I use a sugarfree angelfood cake.  I have also made this with blueberries, making my own glaze as suggested in other reviews.  This is a great go to dessert when you are short on time.

This dessert was well received at a recent small luncheon.  The red looked pretty and festive and was a pleasant seasonal touch with the fresh summer fruit.  It's light and fresh.

It was ok. I didn't care for the glaze. I also had an angel food cake that I think was too big. I would try it again but on the advice from other people to make my own glaze or try strawberry pie filling. My mistake was the glaze was sugar-free and it had an after taste to me but others didn't think so. I think the next time I would layer it more such as a trifle and maybe more berries.

I was expecting something more like strawberry shortcake, but the stickiness of the glaze made it less palatable. Even my school age kids who love strawberries did not really enjoy it.  The cream cheese layer is just a little too thick and creamy and thick thick glaze didn't help.  Lot of leftovers.  I suppose with less glaze and more strawberries it would be better?  Not likely to try it again without trying a few modifications to the recipe.

I make this in a trifle dish, just like in the picture, and it is fantastic every time. I do seem to use more strawberries than the recipe suggests, so I always buy 2 quarts and then if there is left overs, it's my snack!

This didn't last 24 hours in my home.
The only possible edit I would consider is removing the glaze (I'm not a fan of the glaze).  My family vetoed that, though. 
If you try this, you won't be sorry.

Easy and decadent - this strawberry dessert is a winner for Labor Day.  Just picked up some great strawberries from the local farm here in New Jersey.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really yummy! I would make a few changes tho... next time only use one package of cream cheese instead of two and double the whipped topping. I also used a homemade glaze as another reviewer suggested, it consisted of cooking for 5 minutes- 1 lb of strawberries, 1 cup of sugar, 3 tbs of corn starch and 1 tbs of lime juice. Please note this one lb does not include the 1 lb the recipe calls for. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese whipped topping mixture. Very yummy!!

Would give 5 stars but this was way too much glaze.  I used a sugar free angel food cake, fat free cream cheese, splenda, fat free cool whip and sugar free glaze.  Made for a decent dessert with way less calories.  I'm sure this would taste much better using light cream cheese and light cool whip- guees it depends on how much those extra calories mean to you :)  Using all the sugar/fat free stuff really gave that sweetener type of taste- no fault of this recipe.... just throwing out the info in case you are sensitive to that taste.  Made this is a trifle bowl- looked great.  Next time I will use much less glaze, maybe extra strawberries.

I took this to a family dinner and everyone loved it!  Based on another review, I made a yellow cake instead of using an angel food cake.  I used only enough glaze to coat the strawberries, and left the 2 cake layers intact, using the cream cheese mixture and strawberries between the layers and on top.  I will make this again, and again, and again... Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake was sooooo good. I decided to cut back on the sugar when I read the reviews of other people saying it was too sweet. So instead I only used about 1/2 cup of sugar and it tasted great. I used marble pound cake instead of the angel food cake, and instead of the strawberry glaze, I used hot fudge to make designs.  Wonderful!

This was wonderful.  I made a small change and used canned blueberries in light syrup, thickened that on the stove and let it cool and used this instead of the strawberry glaze.  I made it for our July 4th BBQ and it was a hit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Will save for next year.

This is always a hit. It is light and easy to make. I do not use a glaze. I cut up strawberries and sprinkle with sugar. They make their own juice. If you do it this way, make sure the cake is covered well with cream cheese and whip topping so not to get soggy.

This is a great recipe!! The cream cheese layer keeps the cake layer fresh and dry so it stays good in the fridge for quite awhile.

Yummy! I made this for my bf's parent's Easter lunch/celebration. Everyone who tried it, loved it (my bf & 1 of his bro didn't have any... my bf HATES strawberries & his bro doesn't care for sweets). I dislike when people drastically change a recipe then rate it, so pls. forgive me for doing this myself & pls. consider that I am rating this recipe based on the idea itself, the ease of prep. (if I had used all convenience items as directed) & the cream cheese layer (which I didn't tinker w/ other than subbing lt. Cool-whip b/c that's all I had on hand). Here's what I did: a) cubed a homemade pound cake in lieu of angel food cake (I was craving shortcake, hence the sub.), b) prepared supreme strawberry topping by HEISLORD5 as suggested by LucyF (thx. for the idea!) & c) layered all ingredients 2 X's in my trifle bowl in this order: pound cake, strawberries, cream cheese. I'm sure this would have been just as good w/ angel food cake (I will try this next time - using my own recipe of course!). The fact that you can prep. all ingredients from scratch or purchase convenience items if you are short on time makes this recipe VERY appealing to me. I also like the fact that it can be lightened up by sub. Splenda for all or 1/2 of the sugar called for, making your own glaze w/ red. sugar Jell-O and/or subbing lt./ff cream cheese/Cool-whip. Thx. for sharing this wonderful, versatile dessert idea (and did I mention... it makes a TON!!!) :)

I used french vanilla box cake, 2lbs of strawberries, 3/4 cup sugar, and only 13oz of glaze.   
It got attacked at the party I took it to.
My advice: Make your own glaze.  The store bought stuff was nasty.

I'm sure I won't say anything new here but I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I followed the advice of the poster that made the glaze with strawberries, sugar and lime juice and it was great.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar in the cream cheese layer to cut down the calories and sugar since some of our family has diabetes.  I topped it with extra Cool Whip and strawberries and it was a hit!  I made it the night before and loved how the angel food soaked up the juices.  YUM!

This was sooooooo delicious and very inexpensive and not diificult to put together. Hint; be sure that the cream cheese is at room temp and well creamed otherwise you filling comes out VERY clumpy. Happy eating!

I liked it ! It just seemed a bit too sweet to me.
I used ¾ C sugar & I bet I could have even cut it down a little more.
ALSO, I only used a 12oz container of glaze & that again I think I could have cut down a bit more. 
Maybe next time I will instead make the home-made glaze suggested & that might give the berries a bit more of a "fresh" flavor & not so "packaged".

This was a pretty and tasty dish but I think it needs more strawberries.  I made it with a white cake mix, reduced fat cream cheese and light whipped topping.

I made 2 pans of this for a picnic. One was normal and the other I made sugar free. It was so delicious that people applauded! In the sugar free one I uses sugar free preserves and it was way better than the strwberry glaze! I also used a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, but other than that it was a huge hit!!!

This was awesome.  What I did to cut down to make it a bit better for you was I used fat free cream cheese and lite cool whip.  I also used 2/3 cups of sugar instead of a whole cup.  I did not put all the strawberry glaze in it either.  I put a little bit at a time so it was not so soggy.  It came out fantastic and EVERYONE loved it.  I would totally make this again.

Made it twice now! Once with my own glaze (got it from one of the reviews) - and once with store-bought glaze.  They're both great - and if you dont have time, just buy the store bought glaze and you'll be alright!

I just made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was a hit!  I used a freshly made Angel Food Cake cut into large pieces, strawberries and raspberries cut up with glaze and Sweetened cream cheese with sugar free vanilla pudding.  I layered it all three times and topped with sliced Kiwi.  It was beautiful and delicious -and even beat out the double-chocolate birthday cake - WOW!

I almost rated this 3 stars but went with 4 because I did make some changes.  I used frozen sliced strawberries with sugar added and it turned out really too sweet. Also would have been better with pound cake instead of the angel food. And the cream cheese was too rich.

Very good, although I'm not sure I like it  any more than the normal angel food cake, strawberries and whipped topping.  :)

This is a great summer dessert!  
Instead of the glaze I sweetened the strawberries with sugar.  It was a little sweeter than I like
 so I would recommend cutting the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 1/2-3/4 cup.

Two words: Five Star

I changed it up slightly.  I used a 6.2 ounce package of angel food (makes just 1 loaf pan instead of the typical 2 in the boxed version).  So, with having just one loaf, I cut it in half the long way.  Made just 1/2 of the sweetened cream cheese mixture using just 2 Tablespoons Splenda (as my grandmother is diabetic and this was her birthday treat).  Put half the cream cheese mixture on one cut side of the cake, and the rest of the cream cheese mixture on the other cut side of the cake.  Then put one layer of strawberries on (about a pint) and put the 2 halves together (like an angel food sandwich).  Before serving, I topped with 3 big dallops of cool whip, and then cut 3 strawberries into "flowers" and topped each of those with one blueberry (all for presentation).  I did not use glaze, as it also reduces sugar, calories, etc.

Fantastic!  Easily adaptable for diabetics too if made with splenda.  I omited the glaze and let the strawberries sit a bit with splenda to create their own juices.  Hubby loves it!

This recipe is a great!  It's a recipe you can definately bring to a potluck.  It's easy and my whole family loved it.  The kids and the husband!  If you don't have glaze, you could mix the strawberries with sugar and add 2 tablespoons water too.

This was easy and delicious!  I took it to a block party tonight and it was a big hit.  I did layer this in a clear bowl; first layer fresh blueberries, and the top layer a can of lite canned cherry pie filling.  I also used lite cream cheese.  I could have used a sugar free angel food cake, but I didn't want to push it!  Great post!

Awesome!  My mom and her friends do Weight Watchers, so I tried to lower the calories in this by using fat-free, sugar-free angel food cake, light cream cheese (I don't recommend fat-free!), splenda for baking, fat-free cool whip, and sugar-free glaze.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I layered the ingredients in a glass bowl, a layer of cake then the cream cheese mixture, then a layer of strawberries and blueberries, then a layer of cake, a layer of the creamcheese mixture and then the strawberries and blueberries on top. It was very pretty this way, a wonderful 4th of July dish as it's red white and blue. Everyone who has had this has raved about it.

I've been making this dessert for a few years but I used like 1/4 cup sour cream and powdered sugar until it's thick enough.  My husband loves it.  I used reduced fat stuff to make it lighter.

I made a 1/2 recipe, and it was GREAT!!  The people I made it for absolutley loved this. I bought 1 lb of strawberries, because they aren't measured in quarts, and 1 lb was enough for 1/2 recipe, so I recommend 2 lb for a full recipe.  Also, I made my own glaze by pouring a bunch of sugar over the sliced, fresh strawberries, covered the strawberries with plastic wrap.  I let them sit for about 1/2 hour and then spooned the strawberries over the dessert and left the syrup in the bowl.  Then, to thicken it up, I added a little (maybe 1/2 tsp) cornstarch with a little water and then a bunch of powdered sugar.  I also added a little strawberry jam for flavor.  It thickened up great.  Overall, this was such a great, simple, wonderful summer dessert.  I will make this again!!

This recipe was very easy to make and was absolutely delicious.  It looked and tasted like I put a lot more time into it than I did.  It received rave reviews from my family.  A wonderful summer treat!

This recipe is fantastic! I made this for our Mother's Day gathering and was gone before my husband could get any. I had to make more that evening and he loved it! I will make this for every holiday or gathering! Thanks so much!

I brought this dessert to a staff potluck and it was a success.  My coworkers loved it so much that I had to make copies of the recipe for them to take home. The best thing about this dessert is that it's not only delicious, but it's easy to put together! Thanks for the great recipe.

My family loved this and it was very simple to make!  I used a store bought angel food cake and a mixture of frozen raspberries and strawberries.  Also, instead of strawberry glaze, I used about 1/2-3/4 cup of strawberry jam instead.  One thing I would consider changing when I make this next time is cutting down on the sugar.  My family said that they would like to taste the cream cheese in the filling a bit more and that it was a little too sweet.  Overall it was a very fast and tasty dessert!!

This was pretty easy, I made the angel food cake from a mix. It was really yummy!!!  What I really loved about it was that it did not taste too rich.

I changed the recipe a LOT. First off, I decided to do multiple layers and make a trifle. I made homemade sponge cake and that went bottom. Then the cool whip/cream cheese/sugar mix (I decreased sugar to 3/4 cup). then sliced bananas. Then vanilla pudding (boxed mix that used three cups milk). Then strawberry glaze, which I homemade (2 cups cut up strawberries, 1 cup was fresh and one cup frozen, 1 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, juice of 1 lime, cooked on medium heat around 8 minutes. Did before preparing everything else and put in fridge to cool down. Once cool I mixed in 2 cups fresh cut up strawberries). Then a layer of blueberries. Then repeat layers starting at sponge cake. 

Super good and a total hit at the potluck I went to. But that's with the pile of changes I made. with the changes, 5 stars. Without, there's too much sugar and store bought glaze is gross. 3 stars.

Wonderful dessert. Made it with my own homemade cake recipe and frozen strawberries. Used 3/4 for the glaze, cooked it first then purée using immersion blender, then added rest of the strawberries and turned off.

I made this with a gluten-free angel food cake mix, and it came out great! I added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture (via another reviewer's suggestion) and made two layers in a punch bowl. It was a hit at our family gathering. We will definitely be making it again. Thanks for a great recipe!

04-03-16 ~ Delicious dessert!  I made a full batch, but put it in three smaller dishes to share.  The cream cheese layer really makes this dish.  Make sure your berries are dry before adding them to the gel mixture, so that it doesn't break down that layer.  I made the gel using water, cornstarch and strawberry gelatin.  I will be making this one again.

What a refreshing summer dessert! I used only 1 pkg of cream cheese (using 2/3 cup of sugar to sweeten), and fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries. I found that using only 1 tub of whipped topping wasn't enough, so next time I'll use 2 for that extra creaminess. Also, for the strawberries and blueberries, I just added a couple of tablespoons of sugar and let it sit before draining and layering on top of the cream mixture. Everyone loved it! This would also be amazing as a chocolate version :) 5 stars!

Despite being a lover of cream cheese, I just didn't care for this. A commenter left a recipe for homemade strawberry glaze that was to die for, though!  Putting that on top of yellow or angel cake with a bit of plain cool whip is divine!

This was an incredible recipe! My family raved about it at our Mother's Day BBQ. You really can't go wrong with this. I followed other reviewers advice and made my own strawberry glaze. I used 3 tbs. strawberry jello, 3 tbs. corn starch, 1 c. sugar, and 1 c. water. Then brought to boil while constantly stirring until thickens. Let it cool for 20 min then add the strawberries. This made the dessert the perfect amount of sweetness. I hope everyone enjoyed this as much as I did!

I made this with a regular yellow cake mix in a jelly roll pan instead of angel food for my husband's birthday. I just cut the cake into small pieces and placed them in my trifle bowl. It was so good that my niece took the remainder home, along with my trifle bowl. Made it as directed except I just used powdered sugar to sweeten the strawberries instead of the glaze. I think the order of ingredients should be changed to cake then strawberries then cream.

I sliced strawberries the night before , put 1/2 c sugar on them. I did not use strawberry glaze, it didn't need it. I took this recipe to church. It was all eaten and everyone talked about light it was. I used lt cream cheese and lt cool whip. A great recipe.

I used the recipe for strawberry glaze from MANDT2 and decreased the sugar in the filling. I made 4 cups homemade whipped cream (2 cups cream, 2 tbsp c.sugar, 2 tsp vanilla) and mixed some into the filling and then saved some for the top. I used angel food cake layered in a trifle bowl. It was really good! I will make it again with the same modifications.

Best ever ....But I just cut Angel food cake in half horizontally and layered ingredients I added a chai tea pkg to the whipped cream then  put cake in freezer after first serving. When we pulled it out it was even better because strawberries were frozen.  This is the only shortcake I will make again.

I made this recipes and served it with breakfast crepes - cream cheese inside strawberries outside. I made the glaze with fresh strawberries, sugar, corn starch, and lemon as suggested by others. Delicious rich and decadent.

Love this simple and wonderful dessert!
I couldn't find 18 oz glaze so I bought 2 14oz and a second qt of strawberries so I had left over strawberries and glaze for ice cream toppings for later.

Absolutely great idea! My family loves it. But I usually lower the amount of glaze in it. It just seems like a lot. But other then that amazing!

I have made this recipe twice so far, including once for a cookout. It lasted 20min once it was put out for guests. I used the suggestions from other reviews. I used pie filling instead of glaze, and I also added vanilla to whip cream topping. I got rave reviews for this desert and many guests requested the recipe :)

I've tried this recipe twice and got great reviews. The second time making it I substituted agave syrup for the sugar in the cream cheese mixture. I had to make my own glaze with a store bought powder mix. Once the glaze began to simmer I added some agave syrup along with Summer berry fruit dip mix (crystals) from epicure to the mixture and threw in some strawberries. I let it simmer until it thickened- came out great.

Make the recipe as stated, me I wanted to avoid the strawberry gel & used the sugared, sliced strawberries in the freezer section. Unless you assembly the cake right before eating, the cake turns to mush. The flavors and presentation were good.I would make this again. It's a nice, easy dessert.

This was really good and easy and pretty.  I took it took a gathering and it was very well received.  One tip though, it can be made even more simply by replacing the sugar and cream cheese with a 15 ounce container of fruit dip.

This dessert is so easy to put together, and is forth the effort, It is soooo good. The ingredients makes the strawberries more than tasty. I am not a big fan of strawberries but when I tasted this it was mouth watering. I did not make my own glaze and used the store bought glaze and with the cream cheese mixture it was great. Loved it. And my granddaughter said it was the best strawberry dessert she ever tasted.

This is a winner for any get together.  I layer it in a truffle dish as shown on the pic and make one healthier revision.  Instead of sugar I replaced the sugar with sugar-free banana pudding .(unprepared!).  I also couldn't find strawberry glaze so used a can of strawberry pie filling.  Delicious.

Such an easy and yummy dessert.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time my family requested addition of blueberries and bananas.  Great idea, loved it with the fruit addition and added color contrast.  Will make again and again!

Beautiful & Delicious.  After reading reviews, I reduced sugar to 3/4 C, used low fat cream cheese & a splash of vanilla.  I threw in a handful of blueberries & layered it as well.

Absolutely delish!  Made this yesterday afternoon with the following modifications:  Made my own glaze as suggested by so many others on the website using 1 qt. berries, sliced, 1 C. sugar, 3T cornstarch and lime juice.  I also added some blueberries.  I can't really judge how well it would be with store bought glaze, but with homemade it was yummmmy!  Can't wait to have some more tonight!

Yahoo!!!! A beautiful presentation of strawberries! Fantastic! The "once a month girls" thought this was the "bomb".
I did make my own glaze AND used 2 pkgs of lady fingers.  I layered he lady fingers inside the bottom of the trifle bowl! Sort of looked like a picket fence. 
Thank you!

Sorry I and my family did not care for this recipe. We all agreed the strawberry glaze ruined it. I would suggest trying this again and using thawed frozen berries or a cooled down slurry mixed with sliced strawberries so that the juices soak into the cake and omitting the glaze.

This was excellent!! I used a trifle dish and layered 2 rows starting with the angel food cake and ending with the strawberries. I topped it off with frozen whipped topping and it looked amazing! The only thing that I changed was 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup.

This was very tasty and refreshing!! I made this to take to work and got many thumbs up.  I used low fat whipped topping and low fat cream cheese and did not use the strawberry glaze. The fresh strawberries as well as a sprinkling of blueberries made this a lower sugar delicious dessert.

This was very tasty and a great 4th of July treat! I tried to stick as close to the recipe the first time around. I did use my own glaze, made my own whip cream and added some blueberries. From my personal preference, I would suggest having a little extra cake on hand, I found that I wanted more cake in mine and I did not have enough, maybe I did not have as much as the recipe calls for, now that I think about it. Either way, it was SO good and got a lot of compliments. This is something I would definitely make again!

Great recipe! Only thing I changed was that I used half the amount of cream cheese/sugar called for in the original recipe. Still turned out plenty sweet enough. Used store brought glaze and cake. Will make again for sure!

Mine turned out great. I had to make 1 change because i havent found a strawberry glaze that I like. So I just used an extra basket of strawberries and pureed them in the food processor with 1/2 cup of sugar. I mixed the sliced strawberries with the pureed ones and put them in the fridge overnight. This is a keeper for me.

So good! Simple ingredients but comes together perfectly! I made a boxed angel food cake and made my own glaze by boiling some strawberries with a little sugar and water.

Made this with a few revisions, just because of what I had on hand.  Used pound cake (cubed), strawberries and blueberries, just enough glaze to coat the berries (Marzetti's brand tasted pretty good), only 1 cream cheese and 12 oz whipped topping.  Layered it cake/topping/berries two times in a trifle bowl and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Delicious and received many compliments. Next time I will use the 2 blocks of cream cheese and 16 oz. of whipped topping because it needed more.  Oh...and I only used about 1/2 cup of sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy and YUMMY!!!  I used only 1/2c. sugar because the glaze is so sweet and the strawberries were, too (straight from an Amish farm).  I made this twice in two days and everyone loved it.  I just made it a third time and used strawberry swirled pound cake and blueberries/blueberry glaze.  With a big, fresh sprig of mint on top, it looks just beautiful!

So good!  I made it in the 9X13 dish as the recipe suggests, and I think it was just fine.  I used a sugar-free angel food cake, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, only 1/2 cup sugar, fat-free Cool Whip, and I used the regular strawberry glaze...I am sure the homemade would have been better.  But this was REALLY good.  My 16 year old son is already begging me to make it again!  I can't say enough about how easy and quick and good this was.

This was very tasty but a little too rich for me. Next time I think I will 2 tubs of cool whip with one 8 oz. cream cheese instead of vice versa. Can't wait to do again and looks so pretty in a trifle dish!  4/10: Made again with 1 1/2 tubs cool whip and 2 8 oz cream cheese packages.. I also do not use the glaze.. I just cut up two quarts of strawberries and let them juice with sugar in the fridge for a few hours before putting the trifle together. Rave reviews from everyone!

I have made this using a yellow cake mix and a strawberry cake mix. This is one of the best cake recipes I have ever tried. Everyone in my family loves it. I could make one of these once a week and never get tired of it.

After using this web site for about 2 years, I believe this is my favorite recipe thus far. I used the suggestions for homemade glaze and mixed of homemade glaze with some left over jelly/jam flavors that the kids weren't eating.  I didn't have the full amount of strawberries recommended but it still came out great and easy.  Nice alternative to strawberry shortcake.

I make this all the time!  Instead of using whipped topping, I make fresh whipped cream.  I also omitted the strawberry glaze and let the strawberries soak in sugar for 1 hour to ensure they are sweet and juicy!  A great recipe -- you'll get rave reviews every time you make it!

Very creamy and good! I could only find a 14.5 oz jar of glaze, so that's all I used. I actually think more glaze would have been too much. Very good reactions from everyone who tried it. Definitely a keeper!!!!

Great recipe base for almost any whipped topping dessert. I modified a bit. Cubed the angel food cake so I can put into individual serving glasses for guests. Cut sugar by half, used lowfat cream cheese, and added 1 cup sweetened coconut flakes.

I also didn't use the glaze. Instead, I thawed 8oz frozen blueberries for 1 minute in the microwave, then mixed with 1/2 cup sugar and sliced strawberries. Keep the juice from the frozen blueberries because it makes a nice sauce to pour over the cake and topping.

When serving, I put the small cubes of angel food cake on the bottom of the glasses, drizzled the juice from blueberry and strawberry mix, topped with fruit, then topping, more fruit, then coconut flakes and fresh fruit.

The presentation looked very nice and they went very fast.

This recipe was awesome. I usually try to make a new recipe as written, but I didn't have Angel Food Cake so I made a banana cake (I cheated: I used a mix) in a 9x11 inch pan. I also only used 12 ounces of cream cheese (an 8 ounce brick and a half) and about 3/4 of the tub of cool whip. I didn't use a glaze either, because the taste of it is just yucky sometimes. I used Strawberry Preserves! Everyone LOVED IT. I didn't have to add any additional strawberries to the preserves.

Very easy. WILL MAKE AGAIN!

This recipe was a big hit at my Mother's Day cook out.  I made a lemon cake instead of angel food cake and layered it in a trifle dish.  I will definately make this again.  Next time, I will just put a little sugar on the strawberries and skip the strawberry glaze.  This was a great dessert!

Wow, I love this!  I made this last week, but instead of buying an angel food cake, I bought a box-white cake mix, prepared it in 2 9-inch pans, then layered it with that instead.  The dessert came out absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again and again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have to say that I found this recipe several years ago. It was a lifesaver for me as a new bride. I have taken it to many a baby and bridal shower and it has become my signature dish over the years. My husband just loves it and my nieces and nephews love to crumble the angel food cake.

I have also substituted frozen pound cake cut into cubes for the angel food cake (making it a 2 minute dessert - literally for those last mintue guests).

Couldn't live without this recipe.

Adjusted the recipe by using a lemon butter cake mix, add a bit of lemon zest and left out the glaze. It still came out great.

This was a huge hit at a Fourth of July party... I had at least 25 requests for the recipe.  I followed the suggestion of making my own "glaze"... used the recipe using fresh strawberries, and it was fantastic.  I bought the angel food cake in the grocery store and it was fine!  The most luscious part is the strawberries, cream cheese and glaze.... yummy!

Perfect recipe for celebrating fresh strawberry picking season. I omitted the strawberry glaze (really not necessary) and used one container of low fat cream cheese and one regular (I tried the fat free cream cheese and the taste was pretty awful). I also used fat free cool whip and reduced the sugar as other reviewers. My husband and I polished it off rather quickly.

I served this at my daughters 1st birthday party and it was gone before I got a chance to have any. Reviews were great. I skipped the storebought glaze and created my own by putting sugar on the fresh berries and refrigerating for a few hours. I also used a larger size Sara Lee Poundcake and created two layers in a clear bowl.  Refrigerated overnight. Fabulous!!

I made this exactly as the recipe says except I cut up the berries, put some suger on and let sit in the fridge for an hour or so before assembling it.  I used a trifle bowl like in the picture and came out very pretty.  This is my new summer "go to" recipe.  It is wonderful and got lots of compliments on it.  Best of all, it is so easy!

I have made this recipe many times. Evertime, it is a hit. I have had to make many copies of the recipe for friends. It is very easy. The only change I make, is I use less of the glaze.

Yum! I made this last night.  It was great.  I did as others suggested and used 3/4 c sugar. I've also made something similar but w/less calories.  I sliced strawberries sprinkled w/splenda set in fridge for an hr or so.  After an hour layer angel food cake (torn pieces), strawberries, bananas, cool whip (or yogurt or low fat pudding).  Very light and satisfying.

I have made this several times and everyone asked for the recipe.  I always use a frozen Sara Lee pound cake instead of Angel food cake.  I have never tried it using the Angel food cake.  Next time I plan on using blueberries with blueberry glaze instead of strawberry.

Wow. Easy and Delicious! Had BBQ and this for dessert, perfect spring/summer dessert. And did I mention it was easy?  I adjusted the glaze to my taste, just enough to hold it together. Used light cream cheese and fat free whip. Couldnt have been better. :)

Luscious recipe Kelli!!!! I macerated my strawberries instead of buying a glaze and to make this fabulous dessert even more incredible, I melted chocolate chips and drizzled over the top. OMG, hubby and I only got a bite because the kids devoured this! Strawberries are my all time favorite fruit and this great dessert was so refreshing. Using lite cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip did nothing to detract from the flavor. Thanks so very much!!

This was one of the easiest desserts I have ever made.  I brought it to a pot luck at church and it was the first thing gone!!  I sliced the strawberries with an egg slicer and I needed slightly more strawberries than the recipe called for, I used about a pound and a half.  Next time I might use a full two pounds. Everyone loved it.  Thanks!!

I have made this dessert over and over again.  It's light and is the perfect end to any summer meal.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe. So many people try to change recipes and then complain about the results.  This one, just follow to a T!  You won't be disappointed.  All my co-workers requested this instead of a cake for their birthdays!

Delicious!  Very easy to prepare.  Instead of using a glaze, I used the natural juices from the strawberries and added a little sugar.  I also layered the ingredients twice for a beautiful presentation.  Definitely chill the finished product before serving!  I'll make this again, for sure!  Thanks, Kelli!

I used poundcake cause I couldnt find angel food cake and that worked fine, and I used pie filling instead of strawberries and glaze - worked great for the pinch I was in.  This was sooooo good.

WOW, DELICIOUS.  I made this for Father's Day and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I too used 3/4 c sugar, 2lbs of strawberries and a little less than 3/4 of the strawberry glaze.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  Would make again.

I have made this at least 10 times, because it is such a crowd pleaser. I have to bring desert to a graduation this week and yes this will be my contribution, everytime I make it I always have a copy of the recipe with me, because there has not been a time I wasn't asked, it's that good!

Wow, way too sweet.  Perhaps not using the glaze and decreasing sugar even more.  I only used 3/4 cup and only half the glaze.

I made this with lowfat cream cheese and light cool whip.  I didn't use the glaze, just sweetened the berries.  I also added 1 cup of blueberries.  I thought this was a ridiculously easy, light tasting and delicious dessert. Will definitely be making more than once this spring and summer when fresh berries are in season.

This recipe was easy and a HUGE hit.  Guest could not get enough.  I actually ran out and I made a double batch.  Felt bad for the other people who brought desserts as theirs only got eaten when this one was all gone. Make extra!

Made this for a BBQ and got raves, followed the advise of others and used 2lb stawberrys, sliced with egg slicer and only used a little glaze.  I didn't have much time so just bought an angel food cake and ripped it up, made this the night before and it was very good, left overs still good the day after the BBQ when I served it again, this one's a keeper!

We are going to make this again... but would recommend not "crumbling" the angel food cake, but instead slicing it and layering the bottom of the pan with slices.??  Just our experience, accidentally crumbled too fine of crumbs.

I took the advice of other reviewers. I used 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 lbs. of strawberries, 9 ounces of strawberry glaze, light cream cheese, and light Cool Whip. I used an egg slicer to slice the strawberries. I made it a day in advance and it was fine. I received several compliments and will make this again.

This was an amazingly easy & yummy dessert! All my guests raved about it. I did make a couple modifications: I used only a slightly heaping half cup of sugar, which was plenty sweet. I also couldn't find my 9 X 13 dish, so I used a 7 X 11 one. The "crumbled" (ok, more like torn up) cake just barely covered the bottom of the dish...maybe it was a small cake?? Also, I couldn't fit all of the cream cheese/cool whip topping in the smaller dish...had to throw out about a third of it. I used light cream cheese & light cool whip, and it tasted great. Next time, though, I will use real whipped cream, as I'm pretty sure it would taste even better (more homemade) and because I try to avoid eating edible oil products like cool whip. I used glaze on the berries this time, but I think next time I'll just make my own glaze by mixing the berries w/ sugar, as others suggested. Finally, next time I think I'll make it a day ahead, because the small amount of the dessert that was left the next day was even better than the first night...the angel food cake became really moist and delicious from soaking up the other ingredients. A great, super-easy, flexible dessert...I'll definitely make it again!!

A big hit at our Easter lunch. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and 1/2 fat whipped topping. Also, 1/2 c. of sugar. Instead of strawberries, used one can pineapple pie filling. Used a box of angel food cake mix made in two loaf pans, and crumbled it in the 9 x 13" pan while warm as suggested. Everyone said it would be the perfect summer dessert!

I made to recipe to take to a "celebration" party for my mother who had just finished her last cancer treatment.  Everyone LOVED it...especially my mother.  She also asked me to bring it again for Easter lunch. I will always remember this dessert with special memories.

took it to a family dinner and they ate it all.  Everyone gave it a great review and I would definitely make it again.  I actually added a whole container of the whipped topping (1L) and it worked out great would repeat that mistake again.
update:  I have made this recipe many times, i get requested to bring to showers all the time.  I do make it differently when i take it to showers though, a couple of times I have made it with tarts shells and wow fantastic.  Other times i put pieces of angel food cake in the bottom of mini tart paper mash it down like the recipe says and finish, usually i will pipe in the cream cheese mixture to make it look pretty, goes really good with blueberries and cherries as well as lemon pie filling

Took this dessert to a party and it was a hit. This is a great recipe for a lighter dessert. I couldn't find strawberry glaze that I was happy with, so omitted the glaze and just covered the top with sliced strawberries.  Recipe tasted great as is, but next time will probably try reduced fat cream cheese.

This is my husband's new favorite dessert! After trying it on him, I made it 3 times in 2 weeks (!!!) for various get-togethers.  I used fat free cream cheese and "lite" cool whip. Excellent light and creamy recipe!

I made this for a pot luck dinner, and it was such a hit that all the men stole the pan out of the refrigerator and finished it off. Really easy and just as good as cheesecake!

Wonderful no bake dessert!  I thought it could use more of the cake portion for the amount of cream mixture.

I made this for our family holiday get together and it was a huge hit! My sister, who is a Christmas Eve baby, asked I make it every year for her birthday. I used a larger container of cool whip with an 8oz package of cream cheese & added a cap full of vanilla extract. I also made my own glaze just by coating the berries in some sugar and letting them sit overnight. For decoration on top I sugared some berries by brushing them lightly with egg white & tossing them in sugar, then allow to dry until hardened. *This was a very sweet dish and I will use less sugar in the cream cheese mixture next time.

I made this with a few modifications!  Instead of cream cheese I used one can of sweetened condensed milk and a package of instant vanilla pudding snd 1 1/2 cups of cold water for the cream filling!  I also added a cup and a half of chopped walnuts on the top!  Delicious!!

This was absolutely amazing. I loved it. I've made it last month. Like the other reviewers, I've made my own strawberry glaze since I couldn't find it in any store. And I've used pound cake mix instead of angel's food cake mix, which tasted deliciously amazing too. I would love ot make this with other berries someday with poundcake mix.

I made this for a BBQ, and everyone LOVED it! I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese filling. Added blueberries for that extra pop of color. Can’t wait to make it again.

Big hit at 4th in trifle bowl.  Baked store bought cake mix in 2 loaf pans and cooled on side.  Make glaze with quart of strawberries, 1 cup sugar, 3TBSP cornstarch, 1TBSP lime juice, and 1/3 cup water.  Layered with an additional quart of fresh strawberries and big container of blueberries.

I've made it several times now and wholeheartedly recommend making the glaze as per other reviews. I used an immersion blender after cooking the glaze then added the sliced strawberries once smooth and allowed to cool before layering. One time I added blue berries to the glaze in addition to the strawberries

We thought it came out really good. I cut the sugar in half and only put in 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. 
Also, the day we made it, it seemed heavy. The next day it was really light and fluffy too. We’re going to let it set overnight next time and see how that does. 
Super easy to make too!

I made this for a friend who requested  "something with angel food and berries." I was short on time and  It was an easy to make.  I did make my own glaze as one reviewer pointed out. Everyone did love it and it can feed 5-6 people. My husband said it was a "keeper". I would call this "A poor man's trifle" I'll keep it one hand to make a quick summer dessert.

Made this for a womans get together last night. It was a huge hit. We all loved it. Light and very good flavor. With it being 107 degrees out it was perfect. Cold and light.

I was looking for a no bake dessert. This was perfect, very easy. My husband loves strawberry glaze and blueberries, so I found a sugar free glaze that was very good. I used half the amount of strawberries and glaze and only topped one side with the strawberries.  I used canned blueberry pie filling to top the other half. It was very good! Hubby loved it!

This is the first time I made it! I added 1/2 the sugar used lite cream cheese and 1 container of the sugar-free Marzetti! I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I layered it twice. Can’t wait for my guests to try it tonight.

This was a huge hit at our July 4th party!   Super easy and everyone loved it!!  I took several recommendations for others that reviewed the recipe, in order to make it a lighter calorie dessert.  I used 1 block of FF Cream Cheese instead of 2 and a large tub of FF Whipped Topping.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was plenty.  I also added blueberries.

It so cream cheesy and strawberry. I guess you can make it with other fruit but it wouldn't taste the same.

It turned out great! Kids went crazy over it, and adults alike, it was gone in no time. I made some adjustments though, I used 1 package of cream cheese, 12 oz of cool whip, and made my own strawberry glaze (poured some sugar over cut up strawberries, let it sit in the room temperature for about 3 hours, strained them and used the juice with some cornstarch to make the glaze), I also used about half of sugar than what the recipe called for.

My Husband loves strawberry shortcake and since it is his birthday, I decided I was going to treat him to this delicious dessert...  I used boxed angel food cake, 4 lbs frozen strawberries (Made homemade glaze with it) and used 16 ounces whipped topping instead of 8 ounces.  I just broke my diet but was worth every bite! would make again and again! xoxo

Had absolutely no leftovers! I made it  in a casserole type dish instead of layering in a bowl. I'd say for those having issues with the texture, it's important that you let the cream cheese and sugar mix until they are really fluffy and fold the whip cream in--not stir. It's a really easy recipe which makes for an easy win at potlucks.

It would be much better if it used a homemade strawberry gelatin instead of store bought. Next time I will probably spin the strawberries in a little sugar and water instead.

Love this recipe!  We made home made whip cream instead of the store bought stuff and also made our own strawberry glaze following the recommendation of one reviewer. 4 of us went through most of this in one night with everyone fighting for the little bit of leftovers the next day.

I could eat this whole bowl by myself with coffee! Made this as a dessert for spaghetti and my family loved it. I purchased strawberries and strawberry pie filling. I ended up using the pie filling only (which had strawberries in it) because my strawberries didn't look to hot, and it was amazing. I will make this again for any potluck and can't wait to use raw strawberries next time!

I brought this dessert to my knitting group and everybody loved it.  I did change a few things,  because I did not have all the ingredients.  First I made the Angel Food Cake from the box mix, it was really easy and really good and much cheaper than store bought.  Second, I did not have strawberry glaze so I just cut up my quart of strawberries and sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of sugar on them and let them sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes,  next I added a half pint of homemade strawberry jam that I had in the pantry.  I warmed the jam and strawberries on the stove so the two would meld then put that on the top of the torn up cake pieces.  I then did the cream cheese mix but only used 3/4 cup sugar.  I layered that on top of the strawberries and then used strawberries and blueberries to decorate.  It was a hit!  Good summer dessert.

Made this for a party and it was very well received!! I always make things strictly by the recipe provided (at least the first time). However, I did make one minor change. I made my own glaze. I do not like store bought glaze. I am so glad I did!! It was so much better that way. The homemade glaze from another reviewer was so simple and wasn't gooey. I will definitely make this again soon, while strawberries are in season.

I cut the sugar in half but this was still too sweet.   I mean way too sweet.  My kids even thought so, as did my wife and people at the party who tried it.  I have no idea why it's rated so high?   It's awful!  You've been warned.

I changed two things, for the angel food cake I found a pineapple/coconut angel cake to use instead and I also found cool whip cheesecake flavor and used that instead of the regular. This was soooo good definitely going to be a regular in my house!

I made this for a Derby party & it was a hit! I used a store bought angel food cake, pre made glaze, & about 3 pounds of strawberries. For the filling I only used 1 8oz package of cream cheese, 3/4c of powdered sugar, & 12 oz (or more) of cool whip. I layered everything X 2 layers & added strawberry roses (google to see how to make) on top.

I made this beautiful dessert and brought it as an addition to a dinner party and it was very well received. Everyone raved about it and frankly, I can't wait to make it again.The only change I made was that I made my own glaze with a qt of strawberries, a cup of sugar, and the juice of a lime as someone suggested, slicing the other qt of strawberries and adding them to the cooled glaze. The cream cheese was reduced fat and I added Splenda (3/4 C.) to it to cut the fat and calories. Absolutely delicious and I have made many desserts in my time!

Made it for the neighborhood BBQ/block party over Labor Day weekend, and it was an enormous hit!  People actually took home "doggy bags" so they could take it to work with them. I took everyone's advice and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also used one layer of strawberries and one layer of blueberries. Good stuff!!!

If you want a quick dessert that is just ok, use the strawberry glaze and Cool Whip.  It goes together super quick, but it's super-sweet and has that weird Cool Whip taste and mouth feel. 
However, even short on time I made the following adjustments as other readers suggested: make your own glaze out of 1 qt. berries, 1-3 TBSP cornstarch, 1 TBSP lime juice.  I also decreased the cream cheese to 1 8-oz carton.  Instead of Cool Whip, I made whipped cream from 1 pt. heavy whipping cream, 2 TBSP sugar, & 2 tsp vanilla.  Fold the whipped cream into the whipped cream cheese.  The whipped mixture isn't super sweet, but marries perfectly with the sweetness of the angel food cake and berry glaze.

I have made this twice and both times it was a big hit at the parties. The second time, I only used half a tub of cool whip as it seems it takes away some of the flavor. I enjoyed it much more.

Family & guests LOVED it! But we all agreed it would be better without the gel. Just slice up those beautiful fresh strawberries. They're yummy enough! 
I doubled the recipe. It filled eleven 16oz cups and an 8x8 pan.
It's a keeper!

This was delicious. Made it for our Canada Day celebration. Everyone raved about how good it was. I couldn't find any jars of glaze so I used half a cup of Smuckers strawberry sundae sauce in its place. I also put about a half cup of blueberries on top to add a little contrast. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely be making this again!!

Oh my goodness this is good.  Made it about 6 hours ahead of time, layered in a trifle dish and not only was it beautiful it was GOOOOD!  My husband had leftovers the next evening and said it's one of the best desserts he's ever had (and he's picky).  I added a splash of vanilla extract.  I also used lite cool whip and fat free cream cheese and nobody even knew.  Oh, and I didn't do the glaze because I just don't like store bought glaze.  I let the sliced strawberries sit in about 1/2 cup sugar for 2-3 hours before making the dessert.  Next time I'd probably only let them sit in about 1/2 cup sugar.  We will definitely make this again!

This is my go-to dessert for any party and it's always a huge hit! I don't layer it, like the picture shows, and I can't stand glaze, so I just top the icing with fresh cut-up strawberries. So easy to make and quite delicious!

This is my go to dessert when I am strapped for time. One of my favorites. Easy to make and loved by all. There is never any left for the next day
I use blue label presidents choice strawberry jam instead of the glaze

I liked part of this recipe. The angel food cake and the cream mixture are good, but I didn't care for the strawberry layer, with its gloppy fake taste and tart  berries. I much prefer the strawberry layer from an old family recipe: dissolve one large box strawberry jello in two cups boiling water, stir in two 10oz pkgs of frozen, sweetened, sliced strawberries (not thawed), stirring to mix. Set aside to cool slightly. It will thicken as it cools. Then layer the cake, the berry mixture, and the cream mixture in a trifle bowl, repeating layers. It is very nice topped with whipped cream. In the family recipe there was only whipped cream as a layer, instead of this mixture with cream cheese, which I prefer (the other was still very good, and lighter tasting- nice for the hot summer months). I will probably make this one more often, though (with the other berry mixture) because I love cream cheese. This has great presentation in a trifle bowl and I will always make it that way, rather than a 9x13 pan. Very pretty for forth of July and picnics, but also great anytime you want a pretty, lighter dessert with festive red color.

This is good but to make it the best instead of cream cheese I use sugar free white chocolate jello pudding, everything else is the same, but I do make my own glaze, the pudding is not so dry. It is a great hit, I make small individual 8oz clear plastic cups for each person instead of a big bowl, the presentation is great, everyone love it.
This is why I give it a three.

My family loves this dessert. I also made this for a neighbor's party and it was gone in a few minutes! Followed the exact recipe and just added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese. Thanks for sharing, will make again and again.

Made for church picnic and with a table full of desserts this one was gone in a flash! It got rave reviews with my family leading the praises!! I will note I made a couple of changes mainly because I had time and am a little thrifty. 1.99 for store bought glaze? Uh no thank you I'll make my own for half that. My groceries angel food cake was 4.99 so I opted for 1.25 box of white cake mix. Other than that I followed exactly and was so yummy!! 5 stars easy reasonable price and tasty.

my 11 year old daughter made this for us for dessert tonight and it was super yummy. I do think that it was a little too sweet for my liking. I think we'll cut back on some sugar next time. but other then that my family.liked it!

Wow--this was so good. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and made my own glaze and decreased the sugar to 3/4 c in the cream cheese mixture. This such a great thing to make when you're having people over. It's super easy, looks beautiful, and you make it ahead so you aren't messing with dessert while your guests are there. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was so easy and the taste was great. I didn't use the glaze I used pie filling and dabbed it accross the top of the mixture of cream cheese. Mmmmm. It didn't last long at all. Make sure you get a great tasting angel food cake though it makes a world of difference.

I just made this for an office party and it was a hit!  Definitely make your own glaze as it makes all the difference in this dish.  I made mine in a 9x13 casserole rather than the trifle bowl.  I will definitely make it again.

I couldn't find strawberry glaze so I used strawberry pie filling instead. I also put it in 2 layers, the first layer was fresh strawberries w/ a bit of sugar. I also used half sugar & half splenda. Also used the light cool whip & light cream cheese. It was awesome, everyone ate the whole thing at my cookout. Nice summer dessert & nice presentation. Thanks.

This is the first recipe I've prepared from here that I wasn't very pleased with.  It is too sweet and a bit dry.  I tried it again with one of the reviewers recipe for glaze and it was extremely sweet.  Think i'll stick to angel food cake with just coolwhip and fresh strawberries.

Looks wonderful. The dish sounds huge, is it really 9" round
  x 13" deep? I don't want to make it and then end up with a biscuit in a box, instead of a cushion in a cup!  If you get my meaning!

This is wonderful easy and simple recipe!  My mom always made this for family get togethers when I was growing up and it disappears very quickly and always gets rave reviews. She also has made this same recipe using blackberries from her garden and that is just as delish.

This is a show stopper when made and layered in trifle bowl! Added 12 ounce frozen strawberries to homemade glaze from Jello. Also used more Cool Whip to lighten cream cheese mix and to add to top. Wonderful recipe .... Many requests for it!

Husband  gave 5 on valentine's day dessert. Healthy n yummy. I only used1 cream cheese n 1/4 cup of sugar n 1/4 Cup Splenda n tsp of vanilla. Made in my new trifle bowl. I do want to try this with the pudding instead of cream cheese. Just too see. Also, made my own glaze with the following ingredients: cook 5 minutes 1 lb of Sliced berries, 1 cup Zing baking blend, 3 Tb cornstarch, and 1 Tb lime juice, add a little orange juice if glaze is too thick. Total calorie amt 2200 for entire dessert. Calorie counting husband very happy

EVERYONE LOVED IT AND ASKED HOW TO MAKE IT.  I DID AS ALMOST EVERYONE SAID AND LEFT THE GLAZE OUT.  I PUT IT IN A TRIFLE DISH WHICH GIVES IT A LOT OF CLASS. WILL MAKE IT AGAIN ON 4TH JULY WITH JUST A FEW CHANGES TO CUT DOWN CALORIES AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.

Great receipe! I made this one 4th of July at boyfriend's family's house and everyone loved it! Asked to make it again for functions. I substituted the angel cake for store brought shortbread cake and it worked great! Quick and easy to make on the go.

Good recipe.  I made my own glaze as one of the other reviewers suggested and instructed (thank you!) and added vanilla to the cream mixture.  Also, I added blueberries and have used both chocolate and vanilla angel food cakes mixed together.  The bones of the recipe are very good and everything beyond that depends on your creativity.  I find it to be the perfect summer dessert.

Because this receipe is so quick and easy I have made it for every potluck I've gone to this year.  I completely omitted the glaze, used a combination of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries, and cut the sugar in half.  I also toggle back and forth on using 1 stick of cream cheese or 2. It really is a crowd pleaser for those who don't like super sweet desserts.

I used MANDT2's changes as well as yellow cake that I left in the pan after baking then topped with the whipped cream mixture, then that reviewer's strawberry glaze and fresh strawberries.

Absolutely wonderful!  It reminded me of a labor intensive strawberry cheesecake my mom used to make (only SO much easier).  Next time I'm going to try a graham cracker crust to really get the cheesecake flavor.  Like others suggested I did make my own glaze just because the store bought ones look unappealing to me.

Very good.  I used less sugar- 1/2 cup and also added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  I made glaze as per one reviewers recipe and used only 2/3 c sugar.  I could probably use less but not sure if it's needed for the thicker consistency. This is so easy.  You won't be disappointed.

My husband says this beats out any strawberry shortcake receipe that he has ever eaten and to top that this has moved to the top of the dessert list of stuff that I make (for that to beat out cinnamon chip cookies and triple chocolate cake is pretty something).  Anyway, I made a few slight changes, but most of it stayed the same... I used 2 quarts of fresh strawberries -- using about 1 1/2 quarts to mix in the glaze and the other on top of the strawberry glaze mixture.  I used a store bought glaze (because I didn't have a whole lot of time) that wasn't the name brand kind nor was it the generic brand and it wasn't half bad.  I also ended up using about 12 oz of whipped topping and added a touch of vanilla to the cream cheese and whipped topping mixture.  Thanks to TABKAT for great receipe!!

One suggestion for the glaze (which I've done many times in this recipe and it turns out great) is to use reduced-sugar strawberry puree (not jam). The better the quality the better tasting. I tend to use frozen berries, and this gives them a natural taste that is not super sweet. When strawberries are in season I mix them in with the frozen berries and save a few for decorating.

Made this as a "thank you" for a friend.  She loved it!  It was simple to make and tasted wonderful!  The only changes I made: substituted Splenda for the sugar and used sugar free cool whip. I also made my own strawberry glaze by taking frozen strawberries and pureeing them in the blender.  Will definitely make it again.

My boyfriend and friend who don't even like sweets loved this. I eased up on the strawberry glaze cause it seemed like too much.  I put it in a shallow, rectangular glass dish and arranged strawberries and blueberries to look like the American flag - perfect for any summer holiday!

This is a great, easy dessert.  I added a layer of blueberries (fresh blueberries mixed with 1 can of blueberry pie filling) as an additional layer.  Makes a quick and easy, red, white & blue dessert for July 4th.  Tastes as great as it looks!  I topped it with the whipped cream mixture and a stripped pattern of blueberries & strawberries.

I made this for a family party and it was gone very quickly and people kept talking about how much they liked it.  As others have done, I made it in a trifle bowl and did layers.  I also couldn't find strawberry glaze, so I used the juices from the frozen strawberries instead and that worked.

This recipe is a keeper. I amended it because I like to cut back on the sweetness.  I used only half the sugar and I made my own glaze using the Strawberry Glazed Pie recipe on this site. I left the sugar out of the glaze completely because it was already sweet enough from the jello powder. This was a great dessert for our neighbourhood Canada Day celebration.  Looked great and people came back for seconds.  I made this the day before and I think this helped the bottom two layers blend together well.  Yum!

This was soo good. I used a strawberry cream pound cake instead of the angel food cake. For the glaze, I made my own following the Strawberry Glazed Pie recipe, from this site, which I doubled, without using the pie crust. I made it the night before and it was not at all soggy. I also made it in a trifle bowl. This will be a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for our 6 month anniversary. It looked very pretty in the trifle glasses. It tasted all right, but next time I'd leave the cream cheese out. I used real whipped cream and I think that with a little sugar added would be a much better topping. I'd also switch the strawberry and cream layers.

This was amazing!  I made it in a big glass bowl as a trifle. Made an angel food cake and homemade strawberry gel. (both better than store bought) Mixed the strawberries with the gel and then layered cake, strawberries/gel and cream and then layered again.  Everybody loved it.

Yum! I accidentally bought strawberry icecream topping instead of glaze. The recipe was even sweeter, but it was still very good when mixed with the fresh strawberries. I made this dessert layered, in separate parfait glasses. It was very pretty as well as tasty!

very easy to make, I had to use half splenda as I ran out of sugar, my girlfriend doesn't like Splenda but she didn't even notice and is not even a dessert person and she loved it so much she had some for breakfast.

This was absolutely delicious. I usually LOVE anything with the combination of strawberries and cream cheese, and I was not disappointed. We had relatives coming in from out of town for Labor Day weekend, and I already had made the luscious Zucchini Brownie recipe from this site, but I always like to make a 2nd dessert that isn't chocolate, just because I don't want to assume everyone is a chocoloholic like me, and this was just the answer!  Thanks for a great (and simple) recipe!

I love this recipe for so many reasons. I come from a family that will not eat a dessert unless it contains chocolate. They actually ate this and loved it!! I served it in a trifle bowl and kept all of the ingredients and proportions exactly the same. I actually made my own angel food cake, but that is just a personal preference. Great summer dessert and wonderful presentation!

I'm not usually fond of any kind of fruit being in a cake but this was outstanding. Everyone I've served it to--even the pickiest of eaters--also love it. I followed the recipe as listed and it was very moist---I'll continue to make this over and over again.

This has been my all time favorite dessert I have ever made....It was easy and VERY YUMMY:) I made it the night before our Memorial Day cookout we went to and the strawberries stayed fresh and the angel food cake got really moist and custard like.  I did use low fat cream cheese and lite whipped cream and also found sugar free strawberry glaze, I like to watch fat and sugar, but the overal taste was fantastic:)  Thanks for a winner in my book:)

This was so good!  The glaze that I bought wasn't quite as much as called for but it didn't matter.  The whole family loved it and I can't wait to make it for the Forth of July BBQ.  I am sure everyone there will love it too.

I was looking for something quick and easy for a friends birthday. A friend of mine e-mailed this recipe to me. It was a big hit. I made it again for my family 2 days later and they loved it as well. I'm not a strawberry person, so I am going to try it with another berry for myself.

Very yummy!!  The only problem for me was, I followed the directions and they were not very clear.  The picture shows it layered but the directions do not call for it.  It seemed like a ton of the white cream cheese part and not enough strawberry or angel food.  The taste was awesome though.  I will make it again and layer it with more strawberries.

This is reminiscent of my families recipe for strawberry shortcake. We used strawberry jam instead of the glaze but, I made this recipe following esxactly as it's written and it was awesome. Letting this recipe sit in the fridge is important!

I made this for a BBQ.  I sliced the strawberries and poured sugar over them and let refrigerate overnight.  This turned out so good people were literally scraping the bowl.

Looks impressive and tastes even better!  Like other reviewers, I decreased the sugar mixed into the cream cheese.  I also skipped the glaze - I sliced up the berries and sprinkled sugar over them, then let them sit in the fridge over night before assembling the dessert.

Fabulous! Made it yesterday, already passed this link on to two people because they wanted to know how to make it too. I followed the instructions exactly as they are - made the angel food cake from a mix - and could not have asked for better.

Easy to make and very tasty. I used "no-sugar" glaze, though, which was all that was available at the time. If you don't like the taste of aspartame, which I don't, this ruins the flavor in my opinion. Will make again, but next time will use the "real" stuff for the glaze, and cut back on fat etc with fat free cream cheese and whipped topping choices.

This dessert is unbelievable!!! And so easy! It's the perfect summer treat: Light and cool. Made 3 times already with rave reviews. I used advice of other reviews and only used enough glaze to coat strawberries. Yumm!!!

YUM!YUM!YUM!  This is so good and soooo simple!  Did not use all of the glaze, just added until looked good.  Did not add additional sugar as my hand picked berries were extra sweet.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I'm with the crowd - this was absolutely delicious!  I usually don't try out new recipes at parties, but made an exception for this one.  It was definitely a hit!  I left a portion with the host and hostess, and she told me she tried to sneak the last bite, but her husband beat her to it.  I know what I'll be taking to get-togethers in the future!

I took this dessert to our Memorial Day picnic and I did not bring any back home.
It is so easy to prepare and makes a good 'chunk'.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

It's a winner (any time of the year)!

This is fantastic!  I made it for a bbq.  I turned my back and it was gone - everyone raved about it.  I used lowfat cream cheese, and less glaze than the recipe calls for and it was great.  Definitely a keeper!

Fabulous dessert. I doubled the recipe for holiday dinner party, layering the cake/cream/strawberries in a tall glass bowl for a gorgeous presentation. Everyone loved this dessert. Easy to make, even at the last minute.

We loved this!  I used low-fat cream cheese, and I promise you cannot tell the difference, but it certainly cuts out alot of fat and calories.

Loved this.....so easy - I added a second layer of angel food and drizzled chocolate over the top.  My father in law had three helpings and he does not like cream cheese.  A keeper!

I made this last night and took it to a church supper.  People practically licked the dish clean.  It is really good and pretty. Very easy too.   I didn't use quite as much glaze.  I used 1 pound of strawberries and the package of glaze I had was 14 oz. which seemed to be plenty for the amount of strawberries I had.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic - thank you Kelli! I made this for a family dinner and it was gone in less than 5 minutes - my uncle was actually running around stealing other people's portions!
I will be making this again and again.

mmm the strawberries nicely balanced out the sweetness, though it was still a bit too sweet.  we might have scooped too big portions for ourselves, so in the future we would keep portions smaller. other than that it was AWESOME!!

My sister and I tried this a bit differently. We made the cake and then put the icing on top as a frosting. Then we topped with strawberries. Delicious!

Yum!!  Sliced strawberries with an egg slicer and added sugar instead of using a store bought glaze.  Quick, easy and delicious!!!

Amazing!  I made my angel food from a box recipe, but a pre-made store bought cake would've been just as good, I think.  I only coated half of the strawberries with the glaze for those of my guests who would prefer to not have the glaze. Also, I used a very small fraction of the glaze - just enough to coat the remaining strawberries. Oh, and btw, the glaze can be found in the produce dept., in a refrigerator case.  It was a pain to find. The only downside to this is that it doesn't make a pretty presentation on the plate when served (just a gloppy mess), but no one seemed to mind once they took a bite!  Thanks for this keeper!

really easy & tasted great - was a hit.  I chose to cut my berries & add sugar to make their own juice instead of buying it!  Turned out wonderful.

This was OK, but nothing spectacular.  One 10-inch cake did not seem like quite enough to fill the bottom of the baking dish.  I took others' advice and mixed the sugar with the berries instead of using glaze, and was a little disappointed in the soupy outcome.  The cream cheese layer was very tasty, but I will probably not make again.

This recipe was well received by all.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used only fat free ingredients.  I might try making my own strawberry sauce the next time.

This is a great summer recipe. I would make a couple of changes. I would add more strawberries and most definately layer this dessert. I was a rich, but good dessert. I followed other people, leave the strawberry glaze out.

This was a big hit at the family picnic.  Will definitely make it again.  The only change I did make was to add less strawberry glaze.  I bought a 13oz container and only used about half of it.

INCREDIBLE!!  I made this for a family get together and it was a big hit!  I left out the strawberry glaze as others had suggested and sweetened the fresh strawberries with sugar.  So glad you shared this recipe!  Thanks!

I made this for Father's Day and it was so delicious!  Everyone had seconds and the best part is that it is sooo easy.  I'm a choco-holic so I want to try something similar but with chocolate instead of strawberries.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend this past weekend and he loved it! With Strawberries being out of season this time of year, I couldn't find the little individual short cakes you get when Strawberries are in season that I would normally use, however finding angel food cake was not a problem.  I'm not crazy about cream cheese so I added more whip cream to lessen the taste.  It was a no bake easy to make dessert that I'll definately use again.  A way to a man's heart is through his stomach :)

I have now made this several times. Once I brought it to work as a treat during break and there was none left! My grandsons also love it. This is a wonderful summer dessert.
