We liked this recipes alot.  It was a bit runny though.  Next time I think I'll only use 1/2 can of water.  Also, I didn't have peas so I substituted green beans and it was good.  No sherry either so I used Pinot Grigio in its place.  Nevertheless, we really enjoyed it and it was easy to make.  Served over wide egg noodles.

This is a good recipe.  I liked the flavor that the sherry adds.  I didn't have the cream so used milk instead of water.  It was a bit runny so I added more turkey (about 3 cups).  Didn't have cream of chicken soup so used cream of mushroom and added 1 tsp of dry chicken stock.  I also added a bit of Frank's hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  I'm used to having turkey a la king served over wide noodles from when I was a kid - we didn't have any so served it over left over stuffing. Yum!  Overall a good recipe to play with.

This was a super easy weeknight supper, and a great way to use up leftover turkey. Since I did not have the exact ingredients called for I substituted a little. My kids don't like mushrooms, sadly, but I used chopped onion and a stalk of celery, diced. I omitted the onion powder. I also didn't have the sherry so I used white wine. I know traditionally a la King uses sherry, but with a dash of sugar I think it turned out great. I served this over hot biscuits instead of noodles, and it was a nice change. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

What a hearty, filling dish...and it didn't seem like recycled Thanksgiving dinner!  I floated scoops of stuffing on the top the last few minutes of simmering, like you would drop a dumpling.  Delish.

We really liked this. The only major change I made was adding a small chopped onion instead of onion powder. We love onions. Plus I had some shredded carrots so I just used those. I served it over rice and it was very tasty. Added some shaved parm to the top, too. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

As far as "a la king" goes this was so good!  I used fresh parsley (had some left from Thanksgiving to use up) and added a little extra sherry towards the end.  I only had heavy cream but that worked fine.  We loved it!  Thanks!

I chose this recipe because I liked the addition of sherry and it certainly did give it a wonderful flavor. Of course I always add a few more seasonings but other than that, I followed the recipe with the exception of using cream of mushroom soup. Yesterday turned into a nice chilly Fall evening so this was the perfect comfort food dish. Thank you Jessica!

Very bland-i had to add sauteed shallots, more salt & pepper, rosemary, and thyme before it had any sort of a taste. Also only added 1/2 can water and used heavy cream instead of half & half. Good base recipe-but has to be amped up.

This was a very yummy dish. I used smoked turkey and lesser salt than called for. I also opted out of the mushrooms but wished I hadn't.

Great way to use up leftovers. I used a can of sliced mushrooms and had left over carrots and peas, so added them at the end. I used cream of mushroom soup and added no cream. Fresh parslet left over from Christmas dinner added at the end and made a great dish

quick and tasty over brown rice - I just used cream of mushroom soup since I had no mushrooms, omitted the salt and used a can of lowfat milk in lieu of water and half&half

I made as the recipe called for but added an extra half cup of turkey. The sauce was way to thin , so I thickened it with cornstarch. Next time I will cut the water to just half a can. The flavor was pretty good  over noodles.

Really good! My shortcuts were to just make it all in one big skillet instead of mixing soup in a different pan. I used a half a can of milk instead one can of water. And I used a bag of frozen pea and carrot mixture so I wouldn’t have to buy a whole bag of carrots. (Sometimes I get shredded carrots off the salad bar in the deli of my grocery store when I can’t by one or two loose carrots.) This was a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving Turkey. At other times of the year I will buy smoked shredded chicken and use that. The sherry gives it an extra special flavor. It would still be good without it if you don’t keep cooking sherry on hand.

Excellent a la king recipe as written.   Like others suggested, I went a little light on the water, 1/2 to 3/4 of a can.  I will definitely make this again.  It's just as good on toast as it is on biscuits. Great comfort food.

A good down-home meal on a weeknight. Could use some more seasoning.

Family loved it! I did make a few changes since I didn't have sherry I sauted some onion in orange juice added frozen peas and carrots and when I took it off the burner I added about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese! Way good!
