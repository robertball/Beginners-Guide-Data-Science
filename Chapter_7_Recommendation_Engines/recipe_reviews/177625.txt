A very good and simple base recipe. Made as directed the first time and then did some adjustments. First I seasoned the chicken and lightly coated it with corn starch. then very lightly browned the chicken before adding to the crock pot. This helps to thicken the sauce while it cooks without that sometimes raw taste of corn starch or flour that gets added later.  I also stirred in 1 cup frozen whole kernel corn, 1 clove minced fresh garlic, 2 tbsp whole capers. 30 minutes before serving I added 1/2 cup frozen green peas and 1/2 cup diced green pepper for crunch. the third time I made this I added 1/2 cup sour cream for a more luxuriant feel.  The additions made this a complete meal and got raves from family and friends.

not bad, not bad at all:  the sauce was delicious, if a bit thin, but it lacked a richness of flavour (not sure how to remedy that)...nice and tart, tho, and the chicken was amazingly tender...i added some salt (very little) and pepper (a good amount), and only used 4 breasts (just cooking for me and the hubby) so we ended up with tons of sauce---nice on leftover noodles!!  it was a hit at our house, so i'll make this again!

I cut the recipe in half so I got 2 meals out of it.  When the "planned overs" were reheated, I added abut 1/2 cup lite sour cream. YUMMO!  As it was though, it was delicious.  We'll definitely make it again.  I've had surgery and was looking for something simple my husband could fix in the crock pot and this was perfect.  HE'LL do it again too!  Maureen

Suggestion: I've made this basic recipe before (without the carrots) but not in a crock pot. It turns out better if you bake in the oven, uncovered, at 400 for 30 min.  Reduce the amount of water, pour the sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with parm cheese and panko (crispy bread crumbs) and bake.  The sauce doesn't thin out as much this way and has a better flavor and consistency. Don't overcook the chicken and it will be very tender.  Serve with wilted spinach or other veggies on the side. Very good over rice too, it absorbs the sauce a little better than noodles.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I made it using chicken tenders because that was what I had on hand. I also added some fresh minced garlic. About 10 min. before we were going to eat, I added some cold water with cornstarch to the crock pot and that thickened the sauce up nicely. We will be having this again!

I'm a newbie to the crock pot thing.  This receipe took 15 minutes to prepare and taste great.  My picky preteen thought it was so good too, which was an added bonus.  I did add a little Adobo, pepper and fresh chopped garlic.  Definately something I would eat again!

this was alright. after tasting it when it was done i tried to fancy it up a little because it was kind of thin and bland. i added cornstarch and water to thicken it up, and a little sour cream for richness... but it still needed "something"  i think it's a good base recipe, so I'll try it again, but I'll definitely be messing around with it next time - I just like to make a recipe the first time as written. :)   i liked the dijon in it a lot.

This recipe is very similar to one that I make.  However, I place the chicken breast in my slow cooker, "dump" one can of cream of mushroom soup and one bottle of Paul Newman Honey Dijon salad dressing on top, cook on low for 3 - 4 hours.  It couldn't be any easier.  Also, I have found that using a meat thermometer is the best indicator for cooking time when using a slow cooker.

With some modifications this is AMAZING. Try using ground mustard instead of djion and putting in onion, minced garlic, and celery.

This recipe is awesome.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did modify it based on what I had on hand, and some of the other reviewer's suggestions.  This is how I made it and it turned out amazing:

I mixed 1 can cream of chicken soup, 2 tsps dijon mustard, and 3/4 tsps garlic powder in a bowl.  I added the water in a little bit at a time and stirred constantly until it was the consistency I wanted.  I then added 1/4 cup of sour cream and stirred until it had a creamy smooth texture.  I omitted the lemon juice and carrots altogether.

I used a 9X9 square glass pan and coated it with cooking spray.  I cut up 3 large chicken breasts into thirds, coated them very lightly in plain bread crumbs, and placed them in the glass pan.  I poured the sauce over the top of the chicken and baked for 25 minutes at 400.  I sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top of everything and baked for another 10 minutes.  Served over egg noodles it was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sorry but I did not care for this. I will grant that the chicken was very tender. It was not good at all. And like everyone else has mentioned, way too thin.

The chicken was good, but the sauce is very, very bland. After reading the reviews about blandness being an issue, I even added garlic, ample pepper, and onion powder to try and get more flavor. I will try again, but this time I will add some Old Bay seasoning and a couple tsp of Worcestire sauce to add flavor. Worth trying but you will need to make some additions.

Our family loves this recipe.  The chicken is very tender and has an appealing look and flavor, even for picky eaters.  It is also very easy to make.  Found it in a Campbells book a long time ago and lost it! I am so happy to have found the recipe here!

This was a good base recipe but I changed it slightly. I was afraid it would be a little bland because my b/f and I like pretty bold flavors. I added 2 dashes of Worchestire Sauce, tsp paprika and salt and pepper. I also put in about 2 tablespoons dijon mustard and it wasn't overpowering at all. If anything it was still very lemon-y. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms and diced bell pepper along with the carrots. The end result was pretty watery so I let it cook for an hour with the lid off to let the steam get rid of some of the liquid. I also stirred in a dollop of low-fat sour cream at the end to cut the extreme tang of the lemon and that made a HUGE difference. I didn't have any egg noodles so I served over brown rice and it was a hit. The chicken was so tender and everyone went back for seconds...and thirds. Will make this again!

I really like this.  The sauce reminds me of a warm pasta salad type dressing - others complain it's too thin, but I don't feel it should be any thicker because it has a very strong, tangy flavor.  A thin/light coating is just right flavor-wise.  I always make this using 2 chicken breast halves instead of 8, and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Then before we eat it I shred the chicken all up so it kind of becomes part of the sauce.  Finally, I serve it with whole wheat rotini pasta instead of egg noodles.  Oh, and - fresh parsley on this is a must!  It really completes the recipe.  I've forgotten it a few times, and it's definitely missed.

I forgot to pull the chicken out of the freezer to make this, but forgot.... just like I did last weekend. Decided to make it anyway with fully cooked frozen chicken. It came out SO GOOD! Will definitely be making this again.

The only two good things I could say about this recipes is that it was edible and the chicken was tender. Other than that, it was bland, bland, and bland. Very disappointing, particularly since it came from Campbell's. This is definitely NOT something I would make again.

This was one of the things I did not care for. My fiance and I followed the directions exactly except that we added a bit more garlic. We taste tested it at about 5 hours into cooking to ensure it didn't need more flavoring or a thickening agent as many other reviews suggested it would need. We did not care for the flavor! I don't understand other people's comments about it being a bit bland because the lemon juice and dijon mustard flavors were overwhelming and NOT a good combination.

I cooked this in a 6 qt slow cooker and cut down the cooking time.    The chicken had a boiled taste which was not a big hit at my house.  Sauce needed some jazzing up.  I added some balsamic vinegar and sun dried tomatoes which improved it but won't be making this again

I added chopped onion and fresh garlic along with mushrooms. I didn't have 2 cans of cream of chicken so I used one chicken and one cream of celery. I also added chopped green pepper in the last half hr while my noodles cooked. I only used 4 thin sliced frozen chicken breasts therefore I cooked on high for one hr then low for the next 6hrs. My husband love it.

Very good recipe, just needs some slight tweaking! I used Cream of Chicken with Mushrooms soup, 5 carrots instead of 8, 5 sticks of celery (chopped), 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, and salt & pepper. Just the few different little things added a lot of flavor. The chicken came out juicy and the whole dish was delicious. The whole family loved it, wolfed it down and went back for seconds. I'll make this again and again!

With the changes I made this recipe was very tasty for a slow-cooker meal. A lot of other reviewers said the lemon was overpowering - however, i liked the amount. I went for more of a piccata type sauce by adding 2 T capers. I also added a good grind of black pepper and some parsley before cooking. Mine cooked about 3 hr 45 min on high when i put the chicken in frozen it was still a bit over cooked.  I didn't use the carrots and didn't serve over noodles, but this is a tasty base for a recipe. Try the capers if you like the flavors of a tangy piccata but skip this one if you're looking for a creamy mild chicken recipe.

I made this, it's pretty good.  I should have cut up the chicken breast more, it was kind of chucky, good, but chunky; it could have used more salt "I'm not big on salt usage" overall, it's a keeper:)

As is this is plain.  But this is worth saving just because its a good base for altering.  I perfered it when I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery and some Bell's seasoning.

Good but a little bland. Add some spices and sour cream and it would be delicious! Good base recipe!

I made this exactly as directed, except I added fresh sliced mushrooms. The first night, I served it over egg noodles. The second night, I served it over rice. My entire family agreed that is is MUCH better with rice. The sauce is thin, and it's like it slides right off the noodles or something. Will make again, but will tweak the spices, as it was a little bland. Definitely suggest serving with rice over noodles, though!
