I've made other meringue recipes successfully, but these were chewy and seemed undercooked (although I left them in the oven overnight).  They were not crisp nor light and airy.  I felt there were too many chips in them also.  I was disappointed.

These were too salty, too sweet, and too chewy.  They never dried out.  And.... putting them into a turn-off 350 over browned them.

This was very good and a great veriation on just regular cookies.  They were very sweet and I used half the sugar I will use less sugar than that.  I also just put a pinch of salt.

These we very good and very easy to make.  I also used butterscotch chips just for a little variety.  After reading the other reviews, I baked these cookies for 15 minutes and THEN turned off the over and left them in overnight.  They came out perfect.

I made these and followed the recipe exactly. I left them in the oven overnight but they were so chewy you could not eat them. I removed them from the oven, turned the oven back on and repeated the process again for 2 hours.  This did the trick and they were nice and crisp.  Way too salty though.  Next time I will either leave the salt out or use only a dash.

The eggs and sugar whipped up beautifully.  I was nervous to add liquid so I used vanilla sugar instead of the vanilla.  I also used less chocolate chips - maybe 3/4 cup.  But the problem with it was that they did not harden properly.  I left them in the oven overnight and they were still soft in the morning.  So I turned the oven on to 200 and left it in there for an hour.  Then I lowered the temp in the oven to 185 and left them in for another 45 minutes.  At that point, the texture was right - they had hardened into that melt-in-your-mouth consistency that they are supposed to have.  I was hoping that the leaving it in the oven thing would work because it makes for a very simple recipe - leaving it overnight, oven off, what could be easier and safer? But unfortunately this did not work.  I will just have to keep looking for a way to bake meringues.  At least I was able to salvage them by baking them longer.

These were very good.  I am on a low-fat diet and was looking for a good meringue recipe.  These were so easy to make and were better than the store bought kind.  My friends said they tasted just like a chocolate chip cookie.  I'm not sure about the other reviews but mine came out crisp and lite.  I will make these again and again.

We loved these. I've never made meringues before so I wasn't sure what to expect. These were like sugary goodness with pops of chocolate, that kind of melted in your mouth. Whats not to like in that? After reading the reviews I was concerned with the baking process so I changed it a bit. I baked them for 25 minutes at 300 they came out lightly brown and crisp. I got about 24 meringues out of this recipe. Thanks for the recipe I will make these again.

After looking at the reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I used a pinch of salt (about 1/8 t), 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 bag of the mini semi-sweet morsels.  I cooked them in my over at 300 for about 20 minutes and then turned the oven off and left them there for about an hour.  I also realized that when you make them in the summer they are mushier than if you make them in the winter.

These were excellent.  You can make them any time you have extra egg whites not just for Passover.  I've tried making a similar recipe in the past which didn't turn out.  Very easy to make.

Adapted ~~ were excellent & easy!!  Use less salt ( 1/4 t ),  1 piece of matzo (crumbled) & 1/2 C chopped pecans.  After beating egg whites, gradually add sugar n salt, beat till stiff. Fold in rest of ingred. Drop on lined cookie sheets.  Bake @ 350 for 10 minutes, turn off oven and leave over night.  Pretty n perfect.  Enjoy !!

These did not turn out well at all. So disappointing! They were crunchy, crispy, flat, and way too sugary/gritty. Despite the seemingly-easy recipe, I will not be making these again.

I may have actually used 4 egg whites instead of two.  So this made them not too sweet and everyone loved them.  Sometimes mistakes are good!

I followed the recipe and was slightly sceptical about the salt, but I have to say they taste great!
