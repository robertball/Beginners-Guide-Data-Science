These are really a nice Asian meatball!  Even my 7 year old loved them, and she's very picky.  They were super liquify, I did add about 1/2 C of crushed pork rinds (lol sounds disgusting, but it's a pretty common bread crumb substitute in low carb recipes...) to bind things together.  Cooked in chicken broth with ginger and green onion rather than water.

Fantastic! The only thing they need as a finishing touch is an Asian sauce. Sukiyaki sauce and peanut sauce pair nicely with these.

I have made these several times and I always double the batch and freeze some.  Wonderful recipe that's Keto friendly.  I serve them on a bed of spinach and they're always a hit.

Boiled meal balls didn't sound appetizing to me so I baked them.  Easy peasy.  My husband rated this 5 stars and he never rates anything 5 stars.  This was a big hit.

Was delicious.   My kids eyes lit up when they ate.    Only thing I did differently was made them in a Chinese style broth with green onions, garlic, ginger and soy sauce.   Now a family favorite!
