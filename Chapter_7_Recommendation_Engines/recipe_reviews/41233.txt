response to previous post ... i have found it in the "international" section of my grocery store with the british products ... or you can just google it & find it online ... 

Golden syrup is a thick, amber-colored form of inverted sugar syrup, made in the process of refining sugar cane juice into sugar, or by treatment of a sugar solution with acid. It is used in a variety of baking recipes and desserts. It has an appearance and taste similar to honey, and is often used as a substitute for people who cannot eat honey and those who choose not to (such as vegans). It can also be used as a substitute for corn syrup.

These cookies are fantastic.  Having lived in Norway for several years, I will explain that the vanilla sugar (vaniljesukker)I found in the grocery store was, in fact, of a powdered sugar consistency.  However, it can be quite difficult to find the Scandinavia style of vanilla sugar in the United States.  I have made the recipe using granulated sugar and adding vanilla, as well as using powdered sugar and adding vanilla.  Both ways have turned out just fine.  In my estimation, this recipe is very forgiving and highly adaptable.  Thus, I think it does not make too much difference which variation of vanilla sugar is used.  Thank you.

True to the description, these cookies are super easy to make and taste absolutely wonderful.  I make my own vanilla sugar and used maple syrup.  My DH actually gave them this rating.  He is drinking a cup of tea and eating them as I am writing this review.  He said they would be excellent with coffee or milk also.  I even nibbled on one and they almost melt in your mouth.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful, easy, and fast to make recipe.

Great buttery taste! I made them with whole wheat flour and maple syrup instead of the golden syrup, and they still turned out amazing!

I loved this recipe.  Owing to the fact I had no clue what golden syrup or vanilla sugar were, I just improvised.  I used honey for the syrup and for the vanilla sugar I used 1 tsp vanilla extract.  These were great!  

I also liked the fact it had no eggs since I LOVE to eat cookie dough by itself!

I would make these again.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to refrigerate the dough before cooking (it was quite sticky and difficult to work with) and then to bake them as drop cookies. I made these at a time when I was desperate for cookies but had absolutely no sugar on hand, but did have golden syrup, although I suppose you could use honey or corn syrup or molasses if you didn't have golden syrup. These turned out much, much better than expected.  They did not taste the greatest straight out of the oven and looked quite flat, but once they had cooled they had a lovey slightly crisp but chewy, almost melt-in-your-mouth texture with a really nice buttery flavor.

These were pretty good.  I was making sugar cookies, but ran out of eggs so found this recipe to use up the dough.  I added vanilla extract instead of vanilla sugar (by the way, you can make vanilla sugar by just adding vanilla beans to your sugar) and maple syrup.  I also added a bit of nutmeg because I'm on a nutmeg kick right now.  I did them as drop cookies and they turned out quite yummy!  I'll be adding them to some of my Christmas gift baskets this year.
Thanks!

The first time I made these almost according to directions - switching corn syrup for golden, and baked them in two rolls and they did not turn out at all.  The second time I did them as drop cookies and the taste was very good.  Great tasting, but I had issues with the method

These cookies were great!
I couldn't get vanilla sugar or golden syrup so I used vanilla extract and maple syrup and it worked great. They were a bit hard when they can out of the oven but very tasty. A very easy and yummy cookie.

AWESOME!  Best and easiest sugar cookies ever.  Don't even compare to any I have ever eaten!  Definitely need to give them some time to cool before cutting into strips or you will have a mess on your hands.

Like a flat biscotti and very good without dipping into chocolate, even though you might be tempted!  I used honey for syrup and pure vanilla extract instead of vanilla sugar.  Since recipe said to make ~1" rolls, I made several to fit on parchment-lined baking sheets (see photos).  Watch them in the oven!  Even though I used margarine, one sheet took 20 minutes and the other batch took 15 min.  To the 2nd batch, I added 1/4 cup baking cocoa - probably not traditional, but very good!  I also added ~ 2/3 cup extra flour to each batch for high altitude (>7200') adjustment.  Would be nice to see a photo of what these are supposed to look like, but this is my best guess!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum, quick and easy cookies!  I can't find vanilla beans or golden syrup out here in Hooterville so I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and maple syrup, then baked them as drop cookies for 8 minutes.  The second time I made them I replaced half the sugar with dark brown sugar and they came out moist and chewy and just crisp around the edges.  My new go-to when we just want some cookies.

These were delicious!  I used margarine and substituted honey for the golden syrup.  Simply scrumptious!  My only issue was that the dough was very sticky and was not easy to make into rolls as the recipe might lead you to believe.  It was a bit messy as I had to use my hands to settle the 'gloop' into log shapes across the baking pan...but so worth it for the tasty results.

This recipe was so delicious and SO easy to make! I used regular syrup instead of golden syrup because I was unsure what that was, but they came out great nonetheless.

I made a one inch thick bar that spread and browned on the edges as it baked but the center was a gooey mess. I cut the edges off and put it back in the oven. As it re-melted I had to shake the pan so it spread enough to bake properly. Rich and buttery... yes, if you can get past the puddle on your pan stage. That said, my 16 yr/o dd loves them, but I don't think I will make these again.

Wow!  These are my new favorite cookie.  I used vanilla (instead of vanilla sugar, which I couldn't find) and corn syrup (instead of golden syrup).  Super delicious!  But be warned that these cookies spread a LOT!

These cookies are very similar to the classic Danish butter cookies that come in the tins during the holidays. Only they're richer and have much more flavour.   I made these on a spur of the moment and only had 1/2 cup of butter, so I substituted 1/2 cup of Crisco and they still came out fabulous. I'll have to try the recipe as is when I can to see how they compare. But butter tends to make a crispier cookie, whereas oil tends to keep them more moist, and I really enjoyed the almost chewy quality of these in the center.  Golden Syrup can be hard to find in grocery stores across rural America, but most specialty cooking supply stores carry it. I just substituted light corn syrup and a smidge of sorghum molasses.  They go terrific with a cup of hot tea or coffee. Will definitely make again!

This is my recipe. I am Sheilakay1977, you can not substitute any of these ingredients.  Do not use margarine its to greasy and will make them spread to much, get vanje sukker from a Scandinavian specialty store, I promise the ingredient are harder to find then the cookies are to make.

Are these suppose to be crunchy or chewy?  I want to make them again and make 3 or 4 rolls instead of two.  Two rolls seemed to fill my 18X13 inch cookie sheet and it seemed the rolls wanted to flatten out more.  Crunchy or chewy?  Grandpa Dave

Extremely buttery. Did not turn out right.
