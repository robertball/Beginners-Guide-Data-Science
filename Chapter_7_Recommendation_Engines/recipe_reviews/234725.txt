I made a few changes, but liked basic recipe.  I added 2 large scoops of vanilla protein powder.  I also omitted the brown sugar and replaced it with 1/8 cup of honey.  I replaced the half & half with 2% milk.  Very good protein bar for breakfast or a snack!   I cut them into 16 bars.

These had good flavor but they are much more of a baked oatmeal than a pumpkin bar.  The texture is chewy and not cakey at all because there is no flour.  Don't expect a nice light cakey bar from this recipe.  For what it is...a baked oatmeal type bar, it is quite good and a nice healthy option for a snack or quick on the go breakfast.

I made these today because I wanted a healthier version that I could make with the ingredients I had on hand. I followed the recipe, except sub'd almond milk for half & half. I frosted them with a neufchatel cheese frosting (like cream cheese) and sprinkled some chopped ginger on top. They turned out sooo good. Very moist, and not too sweet, just how I like my desserts!

Good but not great-- added chia and protein powder so I could turn these into a serious grab-and-go breakfast, and they're definitely good for that. Surprisingly moist, so even though they're not an explosion of flavour it feels more like a decadent baked good than a usual dense (and disappointing) breakfast bar. Next time I'll probably add nuts, dried fruit... and probably chocolate.

Subbed milk in for the half and half and they turned out great.  15 minute prep? I think I could get it down to 3 minutes on a second try. This is not a dessert and I'm sad that other reviews cite lack of flavor, talk of adding chocolate chips, and then still go on to rate it below 5 stars. This is a solid pumpkin oatmeal bar/baked pumpkin oatmeal recipe that is great for breakfast or as a healthy snack.

Great recipe, but I only had old fashioned oats and skim milk.  Still turned out awesome, but took longer to cook, 45 instead of the 25-30

This recipe was good. It was enough of a sweet treat to keep me away from really really bad treats. However I found the bars a little too spicy all I could taste was nutmeg. If I try it again I might reduce the amount of spice added and add some walnuts to balance the mushiness.

Ok as a healthy snack, but didn't love the consistency or flavour of these. Had to re-read the recipe several times to ensure I didn't miss anything as mine didn't turn out like others said. were flat and not 'chewy'. I switched half and half to soy milk and added a little oil to compensate. The grated orange zest I added boosted the flavour, otherwise I think they would have been quite bland for my tastes.

Was too moist. I guess I should have added flour as one review suggested.

I didn't really like these, they were too soft and goopy.  I should have a added 1/2 cup flour and less pumpkin.  But they were a healthy treat and went well with a cup of coffee!

I made this recipe plant-based by subbing a flax egg for an egg and using 6 tbsp almond butter in place of the half and half. I also added a scoop of plant-based protein. The bars turned out very well! They're moist thanks to the pumpkin and flavorful thanks to the spices. They remind me of a baked oatmeal and will be an easy grab-and-go breakfast.

8.9.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234725/pumpkin-oat-bars/ ... This is like pumpkin pie filling, but not creamy or as sweet, with oats.  Seemed short on sugar so I added 1 1/2T more sugar.  It was enough, but with it being oatmeal, certainly could sprinkle on top as desired.  Rather than spices & pumpkin pie spice, I added 1t cinnamon, 1/2t ginger & 1/4t nutmeg.  I'm a little sensitive to nutmeg so always reduce.   This is my first experience with what I'd think is similar to baked oatmeal & it was fine, but I can't say I'm eager for more.   Good prep-the-night-before breakfast.

I really liked this recipe. I used 2% milk and needed to bake for 35 minutes. Simple, fast, and my 2 year old loved them.

YUM! I made these with 2% milk instead of half&half, used a little less brown sugar and added 3T mini chocolate chips. Those chocolate chips are what turned this into a delightful healthy dessert for me! I also added a touch more spice. Will be making these again! Fun for the fall season.

Soft and tasty. Not too unhealthy either. I used regular milk instead of half and half.

I made these pumpkin bars today. They are a very good snack and much healthier than other recipes. I substituted milk for half and half and added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. They turned out great.
