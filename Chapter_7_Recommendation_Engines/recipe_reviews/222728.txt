We enjoyed this, but I think we would've liked it even more if it had been chilled for awhile to give the mint time to blend with everything else.  I would make it again because it's a great healthy side salad.

After tasting this salad, I was immediately taken back to a wonderful little restaurant in Athens Greece!  I am thrilled to know that this recipe is here for us to enjoy any time we want to!!!!
With the summer upon us right now, I can see myself making this as a side with all kinds of dishes!  
Thanks for the albeit, in my mind, vacation back to Greece!

Good.  Make sure you cut the watermelon same size as the cucumber or the cucumber will fall to the bottom and larger chunks of watermelon will sit on top.  The flavors won't blend together.

I really enjoyed this salad after chilling for a short time.  Raw onion upsets my stomach but I decided to go for it anyway to see how it tasted, as is. I used regular onion as I didn't have red, and sliced it thick so I can pull it out of my serving easily.  That said, the next day, the onion taste was too strong for me- I liked it better after tasting it slightly chilled the night before.  I will definitely make again and skip the onion.  May add cilantro to add to the flavor.  My son really enjoyed it.

This was delicious!  I did use less watermelon than the recipe called for as that was all I had.  I will definitely make this again.

Just as the name implies, this is refreshing.  Itâ€™s a wonderful combination of flavors and a perfect use of the cucumbers in your garden.  This would be perfect for any summer cookouts.

I made this for a family get together and substituted cilantro for the mint as that is what i had on hand. I have a cousin who hates watermelon and he thought it was a tomato salad so grabbed a big scoop if it. He was so surprised...he went back for seconds.

Excellent! I did not add the oil and I put feta on side so it was vegan friendly for folks. Definitely let it refridgerate for a few hours to get it nice and cold. Mint and watermelon compliment each other so nicely. i recommend sprinkling some Himalayan salt on your dish to make it even more savory!

This is one of those salads that you can make your own by modifying it to suit your taste. I used crumbled goat cheese and a drizzle of a champagne vinaigrette. The mix of watermelon and tangy cheese was out of the box and
out of this world.

I was looking for something different to take to a party. This was it! Different, refreshing and very tasty. I have to tell you I didn't measure anything I just eyeballed it using the ingredients listed.  It was VERY good and got wonderful comments at the party!

I gave this a four star because I did not care for it, but my guests really enjoyed it and happily took the leftovers home. The only change I made was to skip the oil. I am sorry, but I could  not put oil on watermelon ;-).  I am not sure why I didn't like this as I do like all the ingredients in it. My guests found it very refreshing, but for me there was something missing. I don't think I will try this again.

Really liked this recipe but as I don't care for watermelon I subbed fresh papaya for it, other than that made recipe exactly as written. It was delicious, I served with a very thick slice of deli ham that had been 'sizzled' on the grill. Will be making this again and again.

I loved this recipe but can't have feta cheese, so I spiced it up with Hungarian Paprika, salt and pepper. I chilled it overnight as suggested by another rater. I am happy with the result.

The onion made me a little nervous, so I went a little easy on it, but after marinating it in the lime juice, it was way less oniony and I regret not putting the full amount in.
This was really refreshing and delicious. The fresh mint was incredible with the watermelon.

It wasn't hateful.  It was just a whole lot less than I expected.   I like everything that went in the salad (especially the feta) just not sure that it was all that exciting or even blended well.  Unlike others, I brought it to a carry-in last nite, no-one asked me for the recipe.  For me, the standard, cucumber salad with an oil and vinegar dressing is a tastier dish.

Great in season recipe! I made changes, for Feta cheese, I used Tofu. It turned out tasty!"The mint tossed in was soooo nice for a refreshing flavor that keeps with you ! My watermrelon was so large that I used only half to the same amount of cucumbers, it balnced nicely! I will make it again!

I added toasted cashews and a bit of salt and left out the feta... made it a delicious vegan dish!

Great salad for a hot muggy day!  I added freshly ground black pepper. Definitely needs to be chilled.

Underwhelming. I made it exactly as per recipe and found the flavors competing rather than complimenting each other.
File 13 for this one.

This is a big family favourite now. A nice palette cleanser to have at a BBQ where everything else has heavy meat flavours

Really loved it but had no mint so I used Lemongrass mint balsamic vinegar instead and honey dew melon as water melons aren't in season it was very delicious and BF loved it

I took the plunge and made this recipe for the first time when we had a guest for dinner.  I made it exactly as written except with mint.  It was a hit.  
     Since I wanted a meatless meal, I made a noodle kugel to go with it.  The kugel had cottage cheese in it.  The two dishes plus a carrot cake for dessert were sufficient for a meal.   This salad is a refreshing change from the usual tossed salads.

I'll try this one, because I just want to know & I see must be a good one. But, you can use just cheese & watermelon, because sweet & salty is perfect combination. Don't pull seeds out, there is an extra aroma with them  ( I never clean watermelon of seeds ).  No herbs, no oil. Only, must be a cold dish. Juicy !  And that's no salad, that's a main meal, if you have decent quantity. Try it yourself, don't trust me on word. IRA  P.S. Be my guest & enjoy !

Did not like this at all.  Not enough cucumber and too much watermelon
