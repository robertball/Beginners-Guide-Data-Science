This was pretty good for a change of pace. It doesn't really have any "kick" to it so I added some finely chopped onion and tomato, plus a little chili pepper seasoning.

Instead of sour cream and dry Ranch mix, I just used bottled Ranch dressing.  Don't forget to add a few drops of lime juice to the avocado to keep the color bright!  Chopped tomatoes and green onion really added to the recipe.  Didn't have tortilla chips, so used Town House crackers as dippers.

This guac is good for us, because my husband does not like tomatoes. I can't have cilantro, I'm allergic. We mixed 2 avocados w/ 1/2c sour cream, 2 tbls lime juice,, couple dashes of garlic salt... and it was amazing!

I left out the ranch... didn't have any powder form. 

The lime juice keeps it from turning so dark the next day (or 2-3 days if you are lucky). I get creeped out by dark guac because it tastes stale to me.

This was okay, a little bland, though.

This dip was super easy, and if you like ranch as much as I do, you'll love it.  Very creamy, and I didn't change a thing.

I have a friend who is violently allergic to onions. When I’m trying to find “fun food” recipes for occasions when we are having a party, it’s difficult to find foods to accommodate all of the guests. Grandpa's Guacamole is wonderful as written, and I wouldn’t change a thing.

I tried 3 different recipes to see which one I liked the best.  This one was really nice.  One of the other recipes asked for 7 ingredients.  This one was just as good if not better with only 3 incredients.

This is a great recipe for "quick" avocado dip. This would be okay for a "what do I prepare?" for the office party. There are one or two drawbacks; one it is a bit salty for our tastes so backing off the Ranch dressing is in order; and two it could use a couple ounces of a good Salsa or Pico de Gallo. I'll try it again that way.

SUPER EASY ... but ... it did taste kinda salty to me. And, I think I want to go with more fresh ingredients next time, so I will try another recipe in the future.

This guacamole was very bland; it pretty much tasted like sour cream. I added some lime juice and chili powder to give it more of a kick, but it was still pretty tasteless. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

The perfect recipe if you're looking for a quick and yummy guacamole. I didn't have much time and don't care for many of the mexican seasonings and this was awesome!

This was on the bland side. I had to add a lot of spices to give it flavor.

This was pretty good and quick.  I did not have regular ranch dressing mix, so I used HVR Fiesta Ranch Dip Mix (it is a little saltier, though).  I also gave it a good squirt of lemon juice. I  cut the avocado in small pieces instead of mashing.  Thanks for the recipe!
