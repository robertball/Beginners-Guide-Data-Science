I have made this several times, and every time it comes out excellent. I have always served this over pasta.   We found that cutting the chicken into small squares or strips works well, and then you can throw all the ingredients into one pot with the sauce after each is cooked.   Sometimes we dredge the chicken in the powdery parmesean cheese, and that is TO DIE FOR. I also added chunks of green peppers to this dish once (cooked them in the bacon grease befor the spinach). Every time this dish is delicious.   As an alternative to chopping the bacon, you can cook it, then crumble it once it's cooled down (you'll have time while the spinach is wilting)

Awesome!  My store didn't have that particular kind of Bertolli sauce so I just took a jar of top quality marinara and added sun-dried tomatoes and chopped olives to it.  I also drained some of the grease from the pan, added and cooked the garlic briefly before tossing in the spinach (which wilts to my taste in about 30 seconds).  A good show-off piece for company!
