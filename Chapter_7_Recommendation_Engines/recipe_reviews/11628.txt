These cookies really satisfy the chocoholic's cravings, believe me! Have a good strong cup of coffee available. They are a crispy fix for the chocolate lover. Stir in the vanilla right before folding in the dry ingredients.

Oh. My. Goodness!  These are some of the best cookies I have ever made.  The process is different than I have ever used for cookies, almost reminded me of making chiffon cake, but it yields perfectly light, moist, decadent treats.  They do not spread very much, so what you put on the baking sheet is pretty much what comes off.  9 minutes was perfect in my oven and I got exactly 36 cookies.  I can not believe no one has made these since 2004!

One of the best cookie recipes I have ever tasted but the recipe was missing some of the instructions. It did not tell you to add the remaining 4 oz of chocolate to the cookie dough or to add the vanilla to the egg & sugar mixture. You must also chill the dough for about 30 min. or until workable.

These cookies taste really good but there must be something wrong with the written recepie. If you use the meassures given for flour you end up with liquid cake-mix (we had to add 4 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar). Also, the time given for baking (8-10 min) ends up burning the cookies no matter what size you make them. If you don't mind making the meassures up as you go and cutting away half the cookie when they burn, these are great...

Oh so sorry, but I used good chocolate and let the batter set up for an hour before baking.  The shape was good, but as a cookie?  I can't accurately describe the taste, but definitely not for us.  Once again, so sorry...

This is one of the best tasting cookies I've ever had.  I just have a few problems with the directions.  Why did I need to buy 10 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate if I was only supposed to use six?  And when was I supposed to add the vanilla?  I went ahead and melted seven ounces, and mixed the vanilla in with the eggs, which seemed to work really well, but I'm still wondering if the result was supposed to be different.
