Wow!  This has to be one of the best dressings I've made on this site and I've made a lot.  My husband who only likes corn as his vegetable of choice (unless forced to eat something else) and if I do manage to get him to eat a salad his first response for a dressing is "ranch" as if it's the only kind ever made. Well, we have a winner because he not only tried it, but ate an entire bowl of salad plus asked for more and declared it a keeper.  I did use 1/2 c. olive oil and 1/4 c. veg. oil (basically switching them) omitted the garlic salt and used 1-2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 tsp. of onion powder and added a bit of sugar until I got the desired sweetness. I would suggest a name change for this one to get more people to try it  "Mustard Oil Dressing" is not nearly as appealing as "Dijon Vinaigrette".

This recipe is wonderful but using powdered garlic and onion instaead of fresh deserves 4 starts. Grate onion from your grater and dice garlic for a much more flavorful taste, I make this all the time. I also never buy salad dressings and make all dressings from scratch and people talk about them all the time. Once you master the basics you will always be able to create a dressing not only for salads but many other dishes.  If I could share my recipes I would but I do not measure anything because once you know the ratio's it is very very easy.

Great base recipe with a beautiful pink color. I like the ratio of vinegar, olive oil and vegetable oil. I prefer a bit of a vinegar punch. I add a honey mustard to sweeten it up a bit, a little more than a pinch of garlic and onion salt and then I crack fresh pepper over the salad at serving time to taste.

Good but cut down the oils a bit and it's missing something. Used this dressing for my cucumber salad.

My mom taught me to make this same thing, but we skip the onion and garlic powders, and use real pressed garlic instead, and we also add some basil.  If you let it sit over night, it get's even better!  I use it for pasta salad all the time.

My first attempt at making dressing from scratch.  I liked it however next time I'd leave out the canola oil, add a bit more olive oil.  And while I love the sharp tang of vinegar, I'd also add some honey for a bit of balance.  Overall, great, easy recipe.

Good!  I initially made this to use as a sub sandwich dressing and I liked the musterdy-ness (LOL) of this recipe.  Was good on both the sandwich and salads.  Not very complex flavors, just an easy quick dressing.  If you like mustard this is a good one.  I think Id like to use a whole grain dijon next time.

Great recipe! I was trying to find a recipe similar to my grandmother's. I bought a pestle and mortar specifically to make her recipe and realized I had bought Dijon, but it should have been Grey Poupon. I think that does make a difference because this dressing is almost as good, but not quite the same. I   ground minced garlic (store-bought), salt and pepper in the mortar, added the rest of ingredients, and whisked. Also, I topped with sliced olives. Very good!! Thank you!

Good to start with but I cut out the veg oil and changed the olive oil to half a cup and used fresh garlic and grated onion to taste then it became awesome. ;)

Light and delicious, with just the right amount of tangy flavor.  The only changes I made were: 1) I used olive oil only (ran out of vegetable oil), 2) I used garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  A really great dressing, and very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This dressing gets better & better the longer it sits in the fridge.  We have used it on regular lettuce salads & added blue cheese or parmessan cheese. Yummy!

Yummy!  The name does not do it justice - maybe Dijon Vinaigrette would be better :D  My French roommates in college used this to marinate cucumber slices in for a refreshing side/salad.  I've been looking for the recipe for many years.  Thanks for helping out!  Oh, made it the other night with cucumber slices but added large chunks of fresh tomato for variety and color.  Even the kids liked it so it lasted only one day after that dinner.  The red wine vinegar I used was zingy so you could try 2/3 oil and 1/3 vinegar, if you like.  Thanks for the memories that will repeat themselves in the future!

I found a bottle of mustard oil in my larder. No idea how it got there. So I was looking for a recipe that uses mustard oil, and found this page. Disappointed.

Very easy and light dressing with tremendous flavor.  Especially good for new leaf lettuce with fresh tomatoes and a few black olives for garnish.

Made this as posted and ended up doctoring it to suit our tastes. It was really sour so I added some more olive oil and some honey. I also added some minced garlic because I like to taste the garlic in mine. The flavors are now blending in the frig and I'm hoping it tastes great for my salad that I'm having with a grilled rib eye for the 4th.

While I really like what the black pepper brings to the table here, I very much disliked the lack of sweetness. I added a bit of honey but it turned out not to be enough after the dressing had mellowed awhile. I'm not even sure how much, to give a hint. However, I think once I add more honey this will be splendid. But lacking sweetener of any kind, this isn't 5 stars for me. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this salad dressing over coldcorkscrew pasta, Black olive slices, crumbled feta cheese, diced red and green olives. Yoiu can also add diced celery, brocolli florets, cherry tomatoes, whatever you like. It goes so fast that you need to make another batch right away! :-)
