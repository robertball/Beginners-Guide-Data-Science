I made this for my in-laws on Christmas Eve and people were fighting over it! I did change a few things, I added 1/4 cup parmesan, and used cream cheese in place of the mayonnaise. Also, I don't keep wine in the house so I left that out too. It's the perfect compliment to a nice soft pita bread or tortillia corn chips. (blue ones add a nice accent!)

My favorite spinach dip!!!  Just remember to squeeze as much water out of the spinach before mixing in.

GREAT recipe!! Definitely good with carrot sticks, celery sticks and of course tortilla chips. I made it twice - first time I couldn't find green onions so I used chives...great results! 2nd time I didn't have hot sauce so I just added red pepper flakes and a tiny bit of red wine vinegar - not as good as with the hot sauce but it did the trick! PLUS I used the leftovers to stuff chicken breasts and it was SO good! Just thin out the chicken breast, put about 1/3 cup of the mixture (pre-cooked) on, roll it up and place the breasts in a baking dish with a little butter and white wine. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes - reduce heat to 350 and bake for another 15-20 minutes or so (until chicken isn't pink throughout). Delicious!!

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit, but it was still awesome!  Ive had to make it twice now, all within 4 days.  :)
First, I used a whole stick of butter.  I melted that plus an 8oz block of cream cheese in the microwave until softened/melted.  Then I added 3 Tbsp minced garlic, 1 lb bag of frozen spinach that was thawed and squeezed dry, 3/4 cup white wine, no salt, about 1 tsp pepper, about 1 1/2 tsp hot sauce, no green onion, 1 lb shredded mozzarella, 1/2 cup Miracle Whip, and a whole can of evaporated milk (I didn't have any half and half on hand).  I also added about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  I mixed it all up and put it in a  9x13 casserole dish and baked it at the suggested 350 degrees.  I had to cook it a little longer because there was so much of it, closer to 30 minutes or until the top got a little golden brown.  But it was seriously AWESOME!!!!

What a great recipe! My family was in town and one serving of this went in the blink of an eye! Since I did not have all the listed ingredients, I improvised. I had no wine or 1/2 and 1/2. I used one can of hot rotel(drained) instead of the hot sauce. I used 8oz of cream cheese instead of mayo and 2%milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. It was delicious! We especially liked the spice of the rotel as well as the tomatoes. Hope this was helpful and thanks for posting!!

This is heavenly!  As suggested, I added some artichokes and 1/2 c. parm in lieu of 1/2 c. of the mozzarella.  Also, I chopped the spinach up a bit before wilting.  Everyone loved it, including my sister-in-law's (supposedly arthritic) dog who jumped up on the table and started munching!  Luckily I have more of the ingredients so I can make another batch!  Thanks Lisa!

I made this recently for a party.  It was gone ten minutes after I set it on the table.  YUMMY!  I did add parmesan and sauted spinach with chicken broth instead of white wine.

Simply delicious. I halved the recipe and used frozen spinach, and it still turned out very well! I've had dip like this in restaurants before, and I've tried to find recipes that could measure up. This is the first to make the grade. Yum.

I found this to be as good, or even better than restaraunts where I have had it.  I also did the substitution of chicken broth instead of white wine and did the hot rotel in place of hot sauce.  It was a hit!!  I used the cheeses which I had on hand - pepper jack and cojack.

Rather bland, but nice enough, especially as a springboard for stronger flavors. I made 2 changes: left out wine (which would've been a nice flavor addition), & used an Italian cheese blend (w/ mozzarella, smoked provolone, Romano & Parmesan) subbing 1/2 c. (sharp) Parmesan for some of the (bland) mozz. Used thawed frozen spinach & plenty of Tabasco sauce - nice. A garnish of sliced green onion tops added tremendous & much-needed flavor & freshness.

This is the best spinach dip I have ever tasted!! Way better than resturant style, I left out the white wine just due to not having it handy around the house and it is still an amazing taste!!! YUMMO!!

Thank you for this great recipe! I love it because you can alter it quite easily to suit your taste but I'm sure its delicious as is, except for the amount of butter. No offense but I cut it back significantly.
I chopped quite a bit of fresh organic spinach before adding to my pan with the garlic, add more of that too! I also added half a jar of chopped artichoke hearts but its not a requirement for taste. :)
I think the wine tho, is essential and I also boiled it down in my pan. As always I omit the salt, 99% of the time it is irrelevant and 100% of the time it is bad for you. :) I used chopped hot peppers instead of hot sauce but wished I had some Rotel, we don't have it here in Canada so I usually grab a few cans when I'm 'down that way'. :D I added the green onion in the end to keep it more 'fresh' and you can pile that in too if you like! I used Mozzarella, Parmesan and Asiago (because it was on sale!) a dollop of real mayonnaise and a dollop of sour cream because it was on hand.
Spread it on pumpernickel and whole wheat baby pita shells yum yum!
Loved the idea someone mentioned to put it in a small crock pot to take to a gathering, that'll keep it hot and soft!

I used mostly queso cheese with a small bit of mozzarella and added a small can of finely chopped mushrooms. Also didn't have any white wine, so I used just a tbsp of white wine vinegar. YUM.

very good - I guess some of the cooks haven't realized that when a recipe calls for "mayonnaise" they DO NOT mean miracle whip or salad dressing.  Makes all the difference in a lot of dips.

This was pretty good, didn't realize I didn't have any hot sauce.  I used a frozen box of spinach, and 8 oz sour cream instead of the mayo/half.  It was ok.  
I went and got some hot sauce and heated the leftovers on the stove and added the hot sauce....it was awesome!!!  Don't skip the hot sauce, I think it makes the recipe!  Thanks, will make again!

Big Hit!  For fun and color I added beet top leaves.  Everyone was curious why there was "a bit of pink".  It added flavor and fiber beyond just spinach.  Thank you!!

This would have been good had there not been so much grease floating around on the top! UGH!!! Luckily I brought this to a potluck that another girl made the same thing & hers was too dry so we combined the 2 & it was perfect. Next time I think I'll add cream cheese, and not mayo & cut the butter in half, and use more mozzarella (I had more parmesan cheese than mozzarella on hand). It definitely has potential & I will probably add artichokes in it. Overall the taste was fantastic! Just really runny!

This was delicious and my husband said it was the best Spin dip he's ever had!  I just made a few changes.  I used Sour Cream instead of half & half, Cream Cheese instead of Mayo, cut down the mozzarella cheese to 1 cup, added 1/4 cup of parm cheese, and I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I made this for a group of 6 people and it was just the right amount. I didn't use any white wine, hot sauce, or green onion and instead of 3 cups mozzarella cheese, I used 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1 cup cheddar cheese. It tasted great! Also, I used a thawed frozen block of spinach rather than fresh spinach - the taste of the actual spinach was stronger than I expected but this is probably why. I served it with multi-grain Tostito chips and everyone loved it! Tip: Mix in about 2/3 of the shredded cheese and save the remaining 1/3 to sprinkle on top - makes it look nicer.

We love this dip!  Subbed sour cream for the mayo as there is an egg allergy in my family.  Didn't have a "bunch" of baby spinach so I used about 3 huge handfulls of baby spinach from a bag and chopped it up before cooking.  Lastly, didn't have mozz cheese so subbed a bag of cheddar.  The wine really gave it a special taste, different from all the others I have tried.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  We loved it!

I got many complements on this dip.  It was nice to see a dip that didn't have artichokes since not everyone I was serving like them. I only added about 6 drops of hot sauce because no amount was specified and it was not spicy at all.  I may add some more next time for a little zing.  Served with tortilla chips and Ritz but there were soft pretzels on the table as well and many liked dipping them in the most.  I did use a 6 blend cheese instead of the plain mozzerella because that's what I had.  Will definitely make again!  (Someone mentioned reserving the sauce for the spinach but my thought was that it was ALL supposed to go into the dip - and it did and it was great!)  Thanks for the great recipe

Absolutely delicious!  Ultra easy to prepare.  I got lots of comments on how yummy this was.  For those who like garlic, I would probably add another clove of garlic to the recipe.

Made this dip but instead sautéed yellow onion in the butter wine garlic mix first before adding the spinach(I used a whole bag of baby spinach!!). Also alternatively used a combination of Swiss, Gouda, and Parmesan cheeses instead of mozzarella (that's what I had in the fridge). It was great for snacking and watching preseason football! Thanks!

I thought that 3 cups of shredded mozzarella was a little too much, so I reduced it to 2 cups and added a brick of cream cheese. I also skipped the half and half cream because the consistancy of the batter look good. I made the rest of the recipe as written. The batter tasted wonderful before it went into the oven, but after it was cooked, it did taste a little bland, but it was delicious nonetheless. Will make again with addition of parmesan cheese.

This is yummy! Here's some tips:  I used fresh baby spinach, so I didn't add ALL the liquid once I sauteed it in wine, butter and garlic.  It would have made the dip too runny.  I maybe added 1-2 tbls.  Which is too bad because the liquid tasted so good!  The wine really adds a great depth to the flavor so try not to skip using it, if you can.  Don't let this cool too long once it's out - serve it immediately for best results.  Oh - and I will chop up the spinach next time.  I may also add marinated artichoke hearts. . that would add a great acid base.  This will be a keeper!

This was pretty good! The only thing I did differently was add 1 cup of cheddar cheese b/c I only had 2 cups of mozzarella. Next time I will add parmesan cheese. I think that will make it perfect!!!

This dip was so easy and so amazingly good! I made it for my very discerning girlfriends for our annual Christmas gathering and they all begged for the recipe before they left! The only change I made was to add artichoke hearts, but it would've been great even without them! My husband is eating the left overs as dinner! :)

WOW we loved this!  The wine/butter/garlic sauce the spinach cooked in was too good to waste so I reserved it and then just added a bit back into the dip instead of using the half-and-half.  Was rich and creamy enough for me without it...  I used Sargento 6 Cheese Italian Blend for extra cheesy goodness.  No need to order out as an appetizer again...this IS better.

I have been making this recipe for years, but I have never taken the time to write out a review. I think it is a great base for a dip that you can tweak to your likes/dislikes. It always disappears at social gatherings. I love a good hot spinach/artichoke/cheese dip, but I have also had some BAD ones. I find this one great with some additions.  I use about 3/4 cup of white wine and I cook it down a bit with the butter and garlic. Reduce it slightly. I also add diced artichoke hearts, and cook it along with the spinach. I season the spinach/artichoke mixture with Emeril Lagasse's Bayou Seasoning. Old Crab and a a bit of cayenne or another heat would work well too I'd imagine. I use 2 1/2 cups of shredded moz, and a 1/2 c. of grated parmesean. I cook for about 25 min, and then I swirl in fresh crabmeat and serve. People love it. I took off one star only because I altered the recipe.

This was DELICIOUS.  I was a little nervous about it because it seemed runny when it came out of the oven, but it turned out ok and everyone LOVED it.  The dish came back to me empty.  Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I added a few more onions than it called for and a little more of the seasonings such as salt, pepper, and hot sauce.  It was a hit at my party.

This dip is very good.  Always get compliments on it.  I didn't use hot sauce, so no vinegar taste.  It's great with Hawaiian sweet bread.  I have made this several times.

This is an easy dip to put together and it has nice flavor, but it just is missing something.  I used an Italian blend of shredded cheese and frozen chopped spinach which I had drained very well.  It made a wonderful snack.

This was very good for my first attempt at making a spinach dip. I cut the wine in half as I put it in a small crockpot instead of the oven. I also used 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo. I think this would be good with cream cheese also.

I have to agree with the reviewer "kellers". I make a similar recipe to this one but instead of mayo and half and half I use sour cream or cream cheese, and cheddar or parmagiano reggiano, always fresh garlic and I add chopped onions. Sometimes wine and sometimes not. Always organic. It's delicious.

I love this recipe served on little Melba toasts. I stick it in a little crock pot to take to get togethers.  Sometimes the combination of onion and garlic is a little strong, so be careful not to add too much of either.

This recipe was fairly good. I added a few cups of imitation crabmeat and omitted the wine. I also added a half cup of chopped regular onion (not green onion) I think it need the parm. cheese still for that real creamy taste. I'd add that next tim but stilla decent dip using everythiing you pretty much have in your fridge or pantry.

Tasted like vinegar.  Everyone I let sample this recipe thought so too. I noticed that vinegar was an ingredient in hot sauce.  Maybe one should subsitute cayenne pepper instead, or maybe it was the mayo.  I don't know.  The cheese was also clumpier than in restaurants, even after carefully watching it in the oven.  I am giving the recipe two stars instead of one because I think it can be modified to taste a lot better.

So yummy!  Everyone who ate it loved it.  The spinach, wine and cheeses really compliment each other!

This turned out pretty well, but a lil different from what I expected. I did make some changes to the recipe though. I used frozen spinach and miracle whip (trying to make the dish lower in calories) and it turned out to be a lil sour. It might be the miracle whip. Next time I'll probably use less miracle whip or replace it with something else.
