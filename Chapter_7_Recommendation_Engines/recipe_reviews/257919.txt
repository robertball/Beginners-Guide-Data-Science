This is hands down the best strawberry jam I've ever tasted. It really does taste just like fresh strawberries. I'm a believer, Chef John!!

Very easy recipe and results are delicious!  I halved it to make sure I liked it and will be doing it again with about 10 pounds of fresh strawberries today.  Mine reached about 217 degrees when I removed it from heat and was a nice spreadable consistency!  Thank you for this great recipe!

I made this this weekend.  I used just under 2 lbs of strawberries so I reduced my pectin puree to 2 apples and 2/3 strawberry.  I also only used a total of 1 cup of sugar (it's for my kids so I didn't mind it being a little less sweet).  It was still so sweet and delicious.  I was afraid I'd screwed up along the way but the recipe was so easy to follow that the end results were spectacular.  I would like clarification of whether this has to be refrigerated or if it can be stored in a pantry.

Made this with apricots instead and it is great!  Besides this change, I used half the amount of sugar, and manually crushed the apricots with a spoon while cooking.  I prefer my jams/preserves not to be too sweet.  Even with the reduced sugar, my jam still seemed a bit too sweet to me, but that may be because I used 1 honeycrisp apple, 1 gala apple, and 1 fugi apple - they are sweeter apples.  I plan on trying this with rhubarb next :)

Love this jam but I also add some Hawaiian chili peppers that I grow in it!  I usually put about 12 in a batch and it has pretty good heat to it.  Might be too spicy for people who don’t like spicy.  Yummy strawberry with a kick of spice.  Me and my bf’s favorite jam!

OMG!. This jam turned out spectacularly delicious! I love the spreadable texture. I had too many strawberries that couldn’t be eaten up before spoiling so I decided to make this recipe. Other websites recipes called for pectin. I said, “What is pectin?” That gives you an idea of how much I don’t know about making jam! Chef John’s recipe only used apples and a lemon to make fresh pectin. Well I had those items on hand! I don’t have canning jars around the house, so I used a few pickle jars that I had washed out and set aside last year for the hubby who often asks for something to store nails, paint, screws etc. I boiled the jars and lids to sterilize them before pouring my strawberry jam into them. I put the sealed jars of jam into the simmering water for 20 minutes. I removed the jars and let them cool on the counter. You could hear the jars seal themselves with a little suction sound as everything cooled down. I removed the jars and let them cool on the counter.

This recipe is so delicious and fresh! This is my first time making jam and I enjoy that it isn't so sugary like store bought. I poured the mixture into a measuring jug after it was done and it yeilded surprisingly an exact 3 cups of jam. I would definitely make it again and I can't wait to use this jam on more toast and in pastries!

I followed the recipe exactly as Chef John described although I did not need to boil the apples and lemon for as long as he said. Maybe my stove is too hot at medium heat, I wasn't using the correct pan, or I was just not paying enough attention to adjust the heat better. Either way--at 15 minutes in, it started to burn at the bottom and make everything look like applesauce which couldn't be strained through my mesh strainer. Instead of starting over--which I should have done, but didn't have the apples or lemons for--I just put the weird applesauce back in the pot with another cup of water and heated it up for a few minutes. 

Regardless of my mess up, I think I was still able to create pectin and the jam tastes right which is the most important part of it all!!

I have made strawberry jam in the past and it came out watery the homemade pectin was the trick. You must be a diligent stirrer with this recipe or else you'll ruin the bottom of your pot.  So happy with this recipe, I will totally make it again, thanks Chef John!

Very good Strawberry flavor. But came out very runny, more like a strawberry sauce. I think I'll go back to my old recipe.

I’ve made this jam several times and it turns out awesome every time. I prefer this jam over store bought and wouldn’t go back.  This recipe was also super easy to follow. Thanks chef John

This was the first jam I've made it it turned out great. I went the whole way and made the pectin myself and I think it was for the best as it gave it a more fruity and tangy flavor.
