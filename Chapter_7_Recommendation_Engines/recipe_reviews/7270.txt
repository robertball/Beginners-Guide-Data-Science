We've made this twice in the last week and it is PERFECT!  I made a couple changes due to availability (I live in the UK):  I left out the pecan sandies and used approx 1 1/2 cups digestive biscuits crushed (no such thing as pecan sandies or graham crackers here).  My husband doesn't like lemony cheesecake so I added just a smidgen of fresh squeezed lemon (for that freshness taste), and about a teaspoon pure vanilla extract.  Besides that, we made it exactly as written (even with the sliced strawberries).  DELICIOUS!  I'll never make regular cheesecake again.

The second time, we decided to play with it a little and used 2 8oz blocks cream cheese instead of the 1, but left everything else the same.  It's even BETTER this way, in my opinion.  It tastes more like cheesecake and has more of a cheesecake texture (although it was delicious the first time, it had more of a whipped cream flavor and less of that cream cheese flavor).  We topped it with a bunch of randomly placed strawberry slices, fresh raspberries and blueberries.  So pretty and so easy!

This recipe may be impossible to mess up. I ended up making a lot of changes based on the ingredient I had and other recipes I read, but it was still amazing. I used sour cream instead of whipping cream, this made it great without the sickening sweetness that is found in store bought cheesecake. Also, I used almond extract and tangarine juice instead of lemon (I don't like lemon flavored cheesecake.) It turned out perfect and my husband (aka. the pickiest eater in the world") loved it.

Who knew cheesecake could be this easy? I had just about given up on making my own cheesecake after battles with waterbaths, hours of baking and chilling but ending up with heavy, mushy cakes. I used 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 Tbsp of lemon juice at the suggestion of other reviewers. The combination of the graham cracker and pecan sandies crust was delicious and not overly sweet, but it did come out a little crumbly. Maybe more butter would hold it together better. Next time I think I'll add a little vanilla, but this recipe could be tweaked in so many ways. You can easily make it chocolate or marbled with cocoa powder, add a layer of chocolate chips or mix in fruit like thawed frozen raspberries. I would also like to try adding a flavor like kahlua, grand marnier or irish cream. Rather than freezing the cake with strawberries on top, I sliced them and sprinkled a little sugar on and let them rest so a syrup formed. They tasted great piled on top of the cheesecake with the syrup soaking into the crust. Yum! Can't wait to try some variations and share this one with friends!

it was delicious. however, as this was my first cheesecake to make, i had to experiment a little. for anyone else doing this for the first time, be sure to make a thick crushed cracker layer at the bottom as it will hold the cheesecake better and it will be easier to cut. a WHOLE lot easier.

I didn't have whipping cream, so I replaced it with 1/2 cup of sour cream as suggested by another reviewer.  It set up well and tasted great.  Using Sandies in the crust is a nice touch.

This is a great recipe, I have been finding a good no bake cheesecake for a long time and finally I found one. The texture is smooth and rich. Somehow I suggest to cut down the lemon juice to 1t, cuz 2t is too lemony....feel like eating a lemon cheesecake.

I made this plain, and it was perfect for an easy, quick dessert.  Since then, I've made a tiramisu version (replace half of cream cheese with mascarpone, add kahlua, dissolve instant coffee with cream, top with whipped cream and cocoa) and an oreo version (mix in chopped oreos with chocolate cookie crust).  Keep in mind this firms up once refrigerated, so don't let the liquidy mixture take you off guard...it WILL firm up!

Super Fast, Super Easy and really good! My dad requested a Cheesecake for dessert Sunday. He didn't mention it until Sunday morning and I knew I didn't have time to make a "real" cheesecake. I started searching for something quick that used some ingredients I already had here. I did make some changes based on previous reviews and what I had on hand and ended up with a great alternative to the real thing. My dad and everyone else really enjoyed this and I know it will be made often. I didn't have pecan sandies so I used the "Graham Cracker Crust" (Janaan Cunningham) from this site. I used 1 1/2 times that recipe, wanting a thicker crust. For the cheesecake, I upped the servings to 12, and then increased the cream cheese to 1 pound, decreased the lemon juice to 2 TBS and added in the zest of approx 1/2 lemon. I also skipped the optional strawberries for topping and followed the instructions for the Orange Marmalade topping from the "Citrus Cheesecake" (Nathan14).  A wonderful creamy, flavorful, pretty dessert! Thanks for sharing!!

The filling was great but the crust needed more butter to hold it together.  Easy, tasty recipe!

I made this cheesecake for the past Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I used someone else's advice and added 2 blocks of cream cheese and I didn't have the sandies, so I used vanilla wafers in place of them and the crust was really good. On this particular cheesecake, I eliminated 1 tbs of the lemon juice and added some grand marnier flavoring... and it was fabulous! I'm passing this recipe on to my mom who also loves to bake and was looking for a great cheesecake recipe!  Great alternative to baked cheesecake. I will be making this same cheesecake for  Christmas next week!  You get 5 stars from me!!!

This cheesecake was so creamy! I did use reduced fat cr. cheese, Splenda for the sugar, 1/2 t. lemon juice and 1 cup whipped topping and it was heavenly. The crust did fall apart a little, even after increasing the butter (I used Promise margarine). Next time I'll bake the crust first. For those rating this low because it's not "real" cheesecake, I suggest you go and make a "real" cheesecake. This is excellent for what it is: easy and quick. Thank you for posting. I will be making this a lot!

Exactly what I was looking for!  Although I have to admit, I used the recipe as a "jumping off point"... For the crust, I ground those super-cheap store brand "iced oatmeal cookies" until I had 1 1/2 C crumbs; mixed the crumbs with 3 T melted margarine, and divided the mixture among 12 muffin cups for individual cheesecakes.  I stuck to the filling recipe, using 8 oz reduced-fat cream cheese and 1 C thawed fat-free Cool Whip (instead of the whipped cream - 1/2 C whipping cream yields 1 C whipped, that's how I figured how much Cool Whip to sub.)  Very light and fluffy, and the lemon juice makes it "fresh" tasting - I wanted something lighter than traditional cheesecake and this was it!  Thanks so much!!

Very nice. 
I've made this twice. 
I omitted pecan sandies cookies because I didn't have it and was too lazy to find it, and I used marie biscuits instead of graham crackers (we dont have those here). I doubled the recipe because the only springform pan that I have is a 9 inch one. For the first one,I also topped my cake with blueberry jelly and the second cake, I used black cherry preserve. They got rave review. No one believed that I made those myself. Btw, I froze them overnight and keep it in the fridge until they're ready to be served (usually a day). I always made them one or two days in advance to make sure it's set.

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews and how easy it is to make compared to making a traditional cheesecake.  Boy was I wrong.  This does not have the consistency of cheesecake at all. My husband didnt even recognize it as a cheesecake.  So I guess what I am meaning to say is if you are like me who loves cheesecake, you might want to think twice about this one.  I just wasted 2 perfectly good packages of cream cheese making this recipe. Maybe this is good for a no bake cheesecake, but now I know what a no bake cheesecake taste like, i will never make it again!

Easy and Turned out perfect! I too followed the reviews and added 2/3 sugar instead of 1/3. I used a prepared pie crust as I dont have a springform pan and it made a little more cheesecake than I needed but put it in little cups and put it in the freezer for another day. (I actually added one of the cups to mashed potatoes and they were the creamiest most delicious potatoes i've ever made)

This was so easy & quick to make & soooo good!! I mean in a matter of minutes you had a cheese cake that is going to taste so good.... I used cherries because that's what I like but I definately will try this with strawberries or whatever topping I guess I feel like it works with almost anything I would think.

*!*!* WOW!! I don’t even like cheesecake and this recipe was absolutely delicious!   Thank goodness I was the only one home when I made it, so I got to lick the bowl! I did make a few changes: Rather then make my own crust I used a store bought gram cracker crust.  I DID HAVE TO DOUBLE THE RECIPE for the filling and it generously filled 1 pie shell (plus left over in the bowl to sneak a taste) Due to the amount of lemon juice, I added an extra 1/4 cup white sugar to the cream cheese.  I also added about a 1/4 cup white sugar to the whipped cream. This cut a lot of that over tart lemon flavor. This recipe gets 10 stars for being so easy and absolutely wonderful tasting, I will make again and again! Thanks Jennifer

I tried this one today as there is another one similar here.  I cut WAY back on the "crumbs" and only used graham crackers w/sugar and cinnamon.  Then I used 1 and 1/2 8 oz. of cream cheese and used only 1 tsp. lemon and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Yummers and fit a smallish pie pan perfectly.  Wonderful recipe and totally yummy and stupid simple!  THANK YOU for posting this.  5 HUGE stars.

I made this recipe today with my 2.5yr old. Really easy, and great recipe..though I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 16oz of Cream Cheese, only half a teaspoon of lemon juice(though I think I should have used maybe a full teaspoon) and 1 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract. :) Added strawberry topping, and yummo!! :D Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  Simple to put together and it turned out perfectly.  I topped the cheesecase with lemon curd, toasted almonds and whipped cream.  Everyone loved this dessert!

Good recipe!  However, I found I needed TWO packs of cream cheese to fill a store-bought Graham cracker crust.  Still and all, this is a tasty recipe.... Resident teenager had 3 1/2 slices!

Easy... No fake stuff (I.e. Whipped topping)... It tastes great! Hubby said it needed a topping so I guess that's where the strawberries come in. Recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

Very yummy cheesecake, and super easy to make. I made a few changes as well... Decreased lemon juice to 1 Tbsp, and increased cream cheese to 16 oz as suggested by other reviews. Also, I realized I forgot the graham crackers, and made the crust entirely out of crushed pecan sandies, which turned out great. It was not crumbly at all and not overly sweet either. When I made this, it was for a dinner party that got cancelled, and the cheesecake was in the fridge for three days before we cut into it. Amazing flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is easy to make. Made some alterations in the usage of cream cheese and flavor. Will definitely make again using this recipe. Recently I used this basic recipe to make Oreo Cheesecake. It was superb.

Turned out delicious!  Even my husband liked it, he snuck a second slice without me noticing. Lol.  I used a premade graham cracker crust.  There definitley was not enough filling to fill it, so next time, I will have to double the filling.  Followed directions exactly, except I used 1 tablespoon of fresh squeezed orange juice since I didn't have any lemons on hand.  The consistency was nice and so was the flavor.  I will definitly be making again.  No more buying the store bought premade kind again.  This is soo easy.

This was very yummy.  My family enjoyed it very much.  The only issue I had was it took longer than an hour to set.  In fact, I had to put it in the freezer a second time.  It didn't look so pretty in the end, but it was good!

So yummy! 
I used double sugar & extra butter in crust, and used 3/4 cup sugar beat in with the cream cheese & folded in 1.5 cup whipped cream & topped with strawberries & blueberries.

My first ever cheesecake! This was very easy and tasty. I did something wrong when it came to the crust because mine didn't hold well, but it was still great. I topped mine with strawberries and that made for a lovely presentation.

Very delicious cheesecake and so easy! Only problem was the crust being a little crumbly. I'll add more butter next time to keep it together. Excellent, the group loved it!

PLEASE NOTE>  i'm only rating the filling :)  if i could i would give this recipe with 4 1/2 stars... i doubled the cream cheese and it was very, very good.  just keep in mind that no bake cheesecakes don't really taste like regular cheesecakes (the texture is different... more creamy as opposed to dense).  thank you for the recipe!

I modified the crust to 1 1/2c graham cracker crumbs and 5 tbl melted butter.  For the cake I used 2- 8oz room temp cream cheese, 2 additional tbl sugar, 1 tbl lemon juice and 1/2c fat free sour cream to get the creamy texture. I topped it with sliced strawberries in the shape of a large star and surrounded it in blueberries for Memorial Day. It took 20 minutes to throw together.

Fantastic! My springform is 10", so I doubled the filling, but kept the crust about the same. I did not double the lemon juice, instead adding about a tablespoon of vanilla. The taste is light and refreshing, but not overpowering, which I feared would happen if I had doubled the lemon juice for the bigger batch. Topped with caramel sauce and toasted pecans. Yum! Thanks :)

One word: DELICIOUS!!! Somehow the concept of putting cheese in the oven and having it get firmer instead of softer never quite struck a chord with me. So this recipe is perfect. I simplified it even more: used 16 oz cream cheese, 2/3 cup white sugar and 1 cup heavy cream (measured before whipping.) I left out the lemon (I HATE lemon) and used a storebought crust. Everyone raved. Thank you thank you thank you!

I didn't want to turn the oven on for 2 hours to do the real thing; this came in very close. I cut lemon juice in half and folded in fresh blueberries. While the consistancy is not that of real cheesecake, it tastes great and is super easy. Summer Cheesecake fix...........solved. Thanks for sharing

I used sugar free cookies for crust, Splenda instead of sugar and sugar free cherry topping instead of strawberries. I took suggestion of others and cut lemon down by half and added another package of cream cheese. With these revisions it was excellent!! Our dinner guests did not believe it was sugar free. I'm sure original recipe is woderful too but hubby is diabetic and I have to make adjustments for him. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Was I suppose to pour the cheesecake batter into the pie shell, because I couldn't stop eating it from the mixing bowl.  A great easy cheesecake-I was pressed for time and this was a huge help!!!  Thanks!

I made cheesecake cupcakes from this recipe. I doubled the recipe but I still did not have enough filling for the 2 doz cupcakes I had intended to make. I used Truvia for baking as a sugar substitute, two 8 oz packages of cream cheese (one was lower fat) and put in vanilla and less lemon juice. Then I made a variety of fresh fruit toppings for each cupcake. I should have taken a photo, but trust me, they were pretty and everyone had more than one. Thanks for an easy and tasty dessert recipe.

I customized slightly in the sense that I am not a good measurer... also I don't care for super sweet, and I like fluffy, there is something that makes it feel less guilty to me if it's light... so for me I put the block (8oz) of cream cheese in my mixer, a tad bit of sugar and 3 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk... I blended that smooth and to taste, then I dumped in my heavy whipping cream, a dash of lemon juice and couple dashes of vanilla, and blended it all together until it was fluffy. From there i dumped it all in a store bought graham crust, it's light, mild cream cheese flavor, and absolutely great, I'd never made a cheesecake before but with the base of this recipe and seeing others play around with the recipe I was confident, and it was awesome, kudos!

Absolutely wonderful!!!!I used this recipe to make mini cheesecake cups. I made these for 2 events already - a school dance recital and my daughters middle school picnic - and got rave reviews at both!!!
I used sour cream instead of heavy cream. This recipe is awesome.  I topped them with cherry  and blueberry pie filling, strawberry syrup and fresh strawberry slices, chocolate and caramel syrup.  Glad I found this recipe!!!!

I don't know what happened- I followed recommendations by adding in only 1 tbsp of lemon juice, adding in an extra bar of cream cheese, and adding in 1/2 cup of sour cream (instead of cream)... and it tasted really off. All I tasted was cream cheese and sour cream. So simple and somewhere I screwed it up!

I made this for my husband's birthday and we both loved it! I kept everything the same except that I added a layer of my own lemon curd recipe in between the biscuit and the cheese- gave it a bit of zing.

Wild blackberry (3-way) & Chocolate version:   I also substituted sour cream for the whipping cream, doubled the cream cheese to 2 pkgs of Neufchatel AND used lime juice and zest instead of lemon.  Other ingredients: 2-3 c. fresh picked wild blackberries 1/2 - 3/4 c. chocolate chips  1. Melt chocolate chips and cool. 2. Add 1 large handful of berries to batter and swirl till almost lavender colored. Pour half into graham crust. 3. Once chips cool, spread onto batter and top with remaining batter. Set in freezer. Topping: Reserve 2 handfuls of berries in a small bowl tossed with 1/4 or so of sugar.  With remaining berries (around 1 cup), heat in saucepan with 1/4 or so of sugar, a couple Tbsp. water and 2 dollops of blackberry preserves or other berry preserves. Cool completely (I did an ice bath and then the freezer). Add onto the top of the cheesecake and store in freezer.  When serving, add reserved berries to the top.

i tried this recipe and i must say that it was just AWESOME!!!! i hav been trying to make cheese cake for sometime n this was my 5th time... everytime i tried a new recipe but this is the one that i m going to keeeeppp. thanks alot for sharing. i just made a few changes...the first was making my own cream cheese with full fat yogurt(had to put yogurt in a muslin cloth for 5-6 hoursto drain).and the other was making whipping cream by whipping 1/2 cup heavycream with 1 tbsp sugar n a tsp of vanilla essence. and it turned out really well....

Great recipe.  I've made it twice.  Once as a whole cheesecake and second as cheesecake bites.  I altered a bit by adding a second 8 oz box of cream cheese.  I also used the powdered dream whip, whipped it up and added it into the mix.  For the cheesecake bits, I added a small box of lemon flavored Jello and omitted the lemon juice.  I love both versions, so did my husband, family, and friends.

One of the best recipes I've tried.  Taste is excellent.  I don't use grahams, just sandies but I only use a little butter.  Also tried just crushed sadies on the bottom and whole cookies lining the edges.  Looks great and family loved it.  No fresh berries in the kitchen so I used frozen (thawed) berries and my hand held blender.  Made a wonderful topping to drizzle over.

I am also in the UK and so couldn't get the USA branded stuff. This was the first recipe from this website that I've used and it was amazing! Truly the first time I've ever been proud of my own culinary creation! I found adding more lemon juice was fun, but then obviously you can adapt the quantities of this recipe to your own individual taste. 10/10 for easiness and taste!

I made this using 2 pkg's of fat-free cream cheese and light cool whip instead of the whipped cream. I used the Healthier Graham Cracker Crust from this site. WOW so good! Will definatly make again! P.S : this gets better as it sits in the fridge so maybe plan to make it a day or 2 in advance.

This is a delicious dessert and a favorite at family gatherings. I make a bigger cake by using a 10" springform pan, and doubling the filling. I also use an oreo cookie crumb crust, which goes really well with this easy cheesecake.

This made a great, light, summer dessert.
I used 2 pkgs of low-fat cream cheese, 1 Tbs. lemon juice, and sugar to taste.
I pureed some strawberries and mixed them with whipped cream for the top.
(A layer of cream cheese, then a layer of strawbery whipped cream)
Lastly, Fresh strawberies on top.
I made this for mothers' day, and everyone loved it.

I used this recipe to make mini cheesecakes.  I didn't use the Pecan Sandies, just doubled the graham cracker crumbs and pressed the mixture in the bottom of aluminum muffin liners.  The cheesecake mixture only made about 9 mini cakes, so I had to make up another batch of the just the cheesecake part. I froze these a day or two ahead of time, and then peeled off the liners and displayed them on a plate.  I used fresh blackberry jelly for a topping and it was awesome!

This was YUMMY!  I made mini-cheesecakes out of it in muffin cups with cranberry sauce (whole berry) on top...perfect!  It was a hit at our ladies Christmas potluck. I will definitely use this again.

I LOVE this cheesecake!  I used light cream cheese, folded in 1 quart of blueberries, and used 2 cups of crushed honey maid honey graham sticks instead of the graham cracker crumbs and pecan sandies cookies. It was delicious and looked beautiful as well.

Excellent even for someone who has never made cheesecake before. I did not add sugar to the cookies and I used canned and frozen berries which I combined with a couple of spoonfuls of forest-fruit jam/marmelade before spreading on top of the cake. I kept it in the freezer after making it, so that it became more solid, and even served it frozen as ice-cream cake. Every time I make this it only lasts a day!

I am a complete noob but one of the reviewers here said that this recipe is impossible to mess up. Challenge accepted. 

Due to availability of ingredients, I removed the lemon juice and the cookies. I also got regular whipped cream. And as suggested by other reviewers, a tsp of vanilla extract and a tbsp of butter. Unfortunately, the crust still fell apart... maybe I should add even more butter next time? 

I also followed the proportions in the recipe but the crust turned out too thick compared to the filling. Either I can't read or this is the actual intention of the recipe. Maybe I should increase the filling proportions next time or maybe I shouldn't substitute the missing cookies with another 2/3rd cup of grahams.

Overall, I still like the taste. Challenge completed.

It is an easy and great tasting recipe, my husband's favorite now.  I just used graham cookies to keep it even more simple... Cooked up some mixed berries to go on top. Going to do it again.

I changed it a bit. For sake of time, I used a Keebler premade graham cracker crust. Also, I did not use lemon juice. I used 1/3 cup of splenda, an 8oz tub of light cool whip, and only 6 oz of cream cheese to make it lighter, and it is wonderful! I also kept it in the freezer instead of the fridge to keep it more solid. I did not use strawberries.

This recipe was good :)  I whipped up the heavy cream and sugar first, then added the cream cheese without turnng the mixer off when it was stiff.  Worked great, and easier then folding and doing them seperately.  I make a different cruts, you can use a shortbreat cookie recipe and bake it first and it's a nice touch.  I also cooked a strawberry raspberry topping, so didnt add the lemon - the topping was enough contrast/tart.  It doesnt need 2/3 cup sugar - half a cup was plenty.   Really is a nice recipe to go to and play around with :)

this is the best cheesecake recipe i have came across yet! i tried to find an easier recipe to make but this is really as quick and easy as cheesecake gets!  instead of using 'pecan sandies cookies' i just doubled the graham crackers.. much easier to find, use less money, and taste much better. and also i always make a little more crust part (don't double it, but just add like, a little more than what they say) other than that, i don't change anything because the recipe is just fine the way it is! my family and I use this recipe a lot.. so easy and SO GOODDD!!

LOVE IT!  It's perfect just the way the recipe is written!  Always a nice touch = strawberry or cherry topping! :)

For what I needed it was perfect!  Sure it's not super fancy but it  got the job done.  I thought the creamy texture was great and the flavor delicious.  I did use two packages of cream cheese and sour cream instead of whipping cream. I will definitely makes this again.  The best part was that it was super quick to make!

Looked like a great recipe and I just changed it to make it a little bigger and more carb friendly. We used 16oz. cream cheese, 2/3 cup of Splenda, 2 tbsp.+1tsp. lemon juice and 3/4 tsp.lemon extract.  No crust and whipped in the 1/2cup of whipping cream(next time I'll just whip it w/the cream cheese instead of separate). We got the no-bake cream cheesecake texture we were looking for and the low-carb friendly dessert that we needed. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this with mini store-bought graham cracker crusts and it was the perfect amount. I also substituted 1/4 tsp lemon flavoring instead of juice because it was all I had. Even my picky eater thought it was good.

This was actually a very good no bake recipe - tasted just as good as the standard baked cheesecake recipe and not as heavy.  The only change I made was to use vanilla extract in place of the lemon juice.  I didn't make the crust portion of the recipe, only the cheesecake filling which I used to fill a Pumpkin Spice Cake that I made from this site using bakeware designed to make filled cakes. I'd definitely make this again, and possibly even double the recipe, for when I want a cheesecake but don't have a lot of time.  Thanks for sharing this one!

YUMMMMMY...not a cheesecake in the sense, but delicious just the same. Nice, creamy texture and good cream cheese taste...and very simple and quick to make. Didn't have any fruit to add to it, but I did use a chocolate cookie crust. If you're looking for something quick and easy to satisfy your sweet tooth, you just found it. Will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing.

This is my all time go to recipe when I need a dessert and want to impress people. I love that it is no bake. I did find that I needed to whip the cream seperately then fold it in or else it was a bit too runny. Other than thatit is fabulous. My brother in law had 2 huge pieces and he normally doesn't like cheese cake!.

Great filling for a cheese cake. I used instead of lemon juice, vanilla extract and sour cream instead of wipped cream as other reviwer said. Excellent. By the way..I used pie crust..great taste!

It was better the next day for sure.  
This was my first cheesecake without the baking part.  I still prefer the baked cheesecakes.  Not bad though.

This was delicious! The texture was great, creamy and smooth.  I'm what you would call a cheesecake snob, thinking you couldn't get a truly good cheesecake unless you baked it, but this recipe proved me wrong.  I didnt have the Pecan Sandies on hand so I crushed Almond Windmill cookies with my graham crackers for the crust, and added a topping of Sour cream, Vanilla, and sugar w/strawberries,  delicious! My husband and I loved it!

in all fairness i messed this up by not whipping up the cream enough so it sort of turned into a mush as opposed to a cake, i will freeze it and eat it like that, lol. i will say though that it has a more creamy than a cheesy taste, i may try to increase the cheese to 2 packages next time. also-i recommend using a nutty crust, it compliments the cake wonderfully.

I didn't really care for this cheesecake. It was way too light & too strong lemon flavor.
If you make this, make double the recipe. It didn't make enough to fill a pie crust.

Turned out well - I substituted Nilla Wafers for the graham crackers and sandies, and used 2 tsp of vanilla instead of lemon juice.  Not as good as baked cheesecake, but fast, easy, and still good!

My family loved this cheesecake!  Very easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tbsp of vanilla flavoring.  I also used 2- 8 ounce pkgs of cream cheese. Will make this again.

This was so easy and yummy! I used a ready-made oreo crust and topped with sliced bananas and strawberries. It was absolutely fabulous! Everybody had seconds! Oh, I did cut the lemon juice to 1 tbsp because of the other reviews.

This recipe was the bomb. My husband and kids loved it. I didn't use any lemon juice, its not a favorite of ours, used vanilla instead and topped it with raspberries instead. And it does taste better the next day.

YUMMY YUM YUM!!  This was so easy and so good!  I used spenda instead of sugar and a ready-made grgraham cracker pie crust.  I also poured a can of cherry pie topping on top instead of the strawberries!  Very good-me and hubby enjoyed!  Oh and it tastes better the longer it sits...was much tastier the day after I made it!  Will definately make again!

Wow...this recipe really is fantastic! This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, and I was delighted with the end result. Very yummy indeed, and easy to make, which is great for those who have very little time to prepare a desert. I covered it with blackcurrant topping, and it was simply delicious. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I used a pre-made graham cracker crust because I was short on time, and this was the easiest cheesecake I ever made.  It was delicious too!

This recipie is sooo simply! I used a oreo cookie ready made pie crust and I drizzled a little melted chocolate on top of the cheesecake to make it look like I slaved all day in the kitchen.

This is the first time I'm making a cake and this recipe is so fast and simple. The second time I made it, I used ginger snap cookies for the base (they are harder to pound to a fine dust though). Only butter is needed next to make the crust. And instead of just fresh strawberries for the top, I used canned peaches as well. My, it's been a long time something I make taste so good it's inspired me to make a new dessert every weekend.

This is a great, easy, light cheesecake. (I cheated and used a ready-made
crust - it couldn't get any easier!) Tasty without being heavy like other
cheesecakes.

I loved this recipe, so easy and simple, I did make a change though, I added 2 sticks of cream cheese but kept everything else the same, because I saw another review that did that. Adding the 2 sticks was amazing! It tasted like a CHEESEcake, just the way I like it. But the crust was really crumbly and it didn’t stick together so when my family was eating it, the crust wasn’t on the cheesecake, it was just laying on the bottom of the can and if we wanted crust on our slice, we would take a bite of cheesecake and then scoop out a spoon of crust from the tray. Other than that, it was a great recipe and I’ll definitely make it again, maybe for Father’s Day, my daddy loves this cheesecake!

It’s perfect for those cheesecake cravings on a weekday night or any night because it’s so easy to make.  It’s not as thick as I would like it to be tho.  It if you’re really craving cheesecake this hits the spot.

This is a great recipe. As per other commenters I increased the sugar and decreased the lemon juice, and used only graham crackers for the crust. I had to use an eight inch cake pan so I wound up doubling the filling, and it worked out fantastically well. For a cake that doesn't require baking the filling was convincingly cakey, with a very nice sweet and slightly tangy cheese taste. Definitely tastes like cheesecake. Forget the fussing with conventional cheesecake and make this cake instead. You and your guests will be very happy (assuming you're willing to share the finished product :))

This filling is a quick an easy alternative to regular cheesecake recipes and yet it tastes quite good. It can be made more creamy (if you're using it for a filling of some kind) by adding a little of the whipping cream to the cream cheese after it has been beaten with the sugar and lemon. I used it to to fill chocolate dessert cups and got rave reviews! I

Try using powdered sugar instead of granulated for the filling.  CoolWhip seems to work better than  whipped cream.   Also try a chocolate wafer crust... did I change it too much? Still a great treat !

I did double the recipe and used a different base which I baked for 7 minutes. I find My base is less crumby. This recipe for the filling was great, the same as my mon used to make but I had misplaced the recipe. I did line my dish with foil in both directions with over  on edges so after chilling the entire  base with filling and topping could be lifted out for easier slicing and serving.

Loved this cheesecake! I added another package of cream cheese and used 2/3 c sugar like other users suggested. I only used 1 tbsp of lemon and it turned out great!! Husband has eaten half of it already. Definitely will make this again.

This is my husband's favorite dessert. I whip this baby up in about 5 minutes. I buy a Graham cracker crust & top the cheesecake with strawberry pie filling that I canned over the summer. I do not alter the cheesecake filling at all. Some people have commented that they leave out or reduce the lemon juice. I am not a fan of anything "citrus"  but without it you're not going to get that true cheesecake flavor. The lemon juice is essential & the filling will be bland without it.

So simple and so tasty.  Huge hit with family and friends.  I live in Israel so graham crackers are not available -- used petti bear and lotus cookies -- worked like a charm.

Oh my god I was very skeptical about this being no bake cheesecake what a fool I was sorry forgot to take a picture.  I did everything exactly as stated and it turned out wonderful better in my opinion than the baked ones it was phenomenal I also made a fresh strawberry sauce by chef john on this site to put on top this made it even better will definitely make again thanks so much for the recipe

I made this for Easter. I bought the crust. But I used someone's idea to add vanilla extract and use 16oz cream cheese. Next time I will use a little less lemon juice, possibly 1 1/2 teaspoon instead of 2 and a little more sugar since I am using more cream cheese. However it was AMAZING just the way it was! I cut fresh strawberries in glaze for the topping!! YUM!!!!

Great recipe. Because I don't like whipped cream I substituted it with ricotta cheese and two tablespoons yogurth, it was delicious. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was very easy we all know what we go thru to keep the cake from cracking and the length of time it takes to cook. This was not as good as the one I just spoke of, but for a quickie it will work

I still need to tweak this to get it how I want it.  I wanted it to be fairly stiff because I wanted to make it into mini cheesecakes (in cupcake papers in a muffin tin).  I used a little more cream cheese, a little more sugar, and sour cream instead of whipped cream, and added a bit of vanilla extract (2 tsps I think).  I also made the crust out of cinnamon graham crackers and butter.  I tried three different variations:  one third of the batter I added blueberries to, and beat for a little while (topped with a raspberry); one third I left plain, to top with a pecan half; and one third I added cocoa powder to and drizzled melted chocolate chips on top of.  I ended up adding confectioner's sugar to some of it because I was afraid it wasn't turning out thick enough, and because it wasn't as sweet since I had used sour cream.  I plan to add this to the batter from the start next time.  The chocolate ones turned out the best, but all of them were pretty good.  I will continue to perfect this!

This worked out perfectly! Since I did not have a day in advance notice to make cheesecake, I decided to finally give this a try. It doesn't taste like the real deal but its veryy good! The texture is different and its less dense. I feel like its better in the summer. I did double the amount of cream cheese and whipped cream. I tasted it and decided to add a bit more sugar as well, along with some vanilla extract. It set perfectly in the freezer. I made a simple strawberry topping to go on the top.

I have made this more than once and it's gone in no time. I make it a little different though - it's the same recipe but I make 2 batches to make a double layer cheesecake. In between the 2 cheesecakes, I put a layer of caramel sauce (the ice cream topping you buy in the store)and then caramel on the top with pecan pieces covering the caramel. Thank you for sharing your recipe for all of us to enjoy :)

This recipe is outstanding. I agree, it is more of a mousse than cheesecake. It's much less dense but is still wonderful. I made just a few minor changes. I followed the recipe for the filling except for adding a half teaspoon of vanilla powder. Then I put the filling in a pastry bag and piped it into mini muffin paper liners. For the crust I used a mini vanilla wafer at the bottom of the muffin paper. Super easy an fast. This recipe made 30 mini bites.  Will definitely be making again :) thank you for a great recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T with full intentions to use it for a group of people for my New Years Eve party.  I added slightly more sugar than it called for as it wasn't quite sweet enough on it's own.  The consistency was fantastic!  I cheated due to time constraints and used a pre-made graham cracker crust which worked out good as there was a little left over for my hubby and I to do a proper tasting.  I am doing a "cheesecake bar" with plain cheesecake and several toppings for others to choose from.  I am really pleased with this recipe.  It's even better than Mom used to make....and hers rocked!!

I make this every year for thanks giving except I make it even easier by buying a gramcracker crust and I put blueberry pie filling on top of one and rasberry pie filling on the other and they are a huge hit they are so good and easy to make.

MY HUSBAND'S FAVORITE! I make this easy dessert for every birthday or special dinner. Use 1 and 1/2 blocks of cream cheese to make it thicker. And I top mine with cherry pie filling. YUM YUM YUM

Super simple, and very quick to make!  I was invited to a BBQ and didn't have much time to make anything.  This recipe was perfect for that easy "go-to" dessert.  Fresh blueberries sprinkled on top was also a great little touch!

Fantastic recipe. I changed the base a bit by making it out of almond cookies and marzipan and added a caramel topping instead of strawberries. Delicious.

Not too bad for what it is.  Much better than doing all of  the work involved with a traditional cheesecake, which is far too labor-intesnsive to make more than a few times a year.

For quick and easy, this is a pretty good cheesecake.  But it's too rich for me.  I'll stick with real cheesecake.  Part of my problem may have been the lemon.  I think with about half the lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla, this may have been less intense, and more palatable.    Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was a great no-bake cheese cake! The taste is exactly like cheesecake but the consistency is a little different. However, this was very easy to make and quite pleasing, so we're sticking with 5 stars

I used this recipe to make a red velvet cheesecake and it turned out lovely. Not sure if I would use it as a stand-alone cheesecake. My family prefers the Chantal cheesecake recipe found on this site.

Great Recipe, this is definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe except with the following revisions based on the other reviews - used sour cream and vanilla and it tastes just like the store bought cheesecakes. As for the crust, I couldn't find graham crackers so I used Ovaltine cookies and grounded them in a food processor - great crunch. Will try with light cream cheese next time and see if it will taste as great.

Perfect 'as is,' no changes. There was no "lemony" taste that many mentioned. The only thing I had to do differently is use Graham Cracker Crust recipe on this site instead of the crust included because there are no pecan sandies where I live in Europe. Very easy, flexible, delicious. Just what I was looking for! :)

was bored at home and without an oven, i decided to make my first no bake cheesecake.

after freezing for 3-4 hours, it turn out to be like ice cream.

everyone asked me bout d base, i changed d base recipe to digestive and oreo biscuit. the pecan biscuit (imported) is rather expensive.

overall, the filling taste good!

All I can say is YUM! This was awesome and easy to make. I adjusted the recipe a little bit to compensate for a few items I didn't have on hand. I used two tablespoons concentrated frozen lemonaid (thawed of course) instead of lemon juice, and macerated blueberries instead of strawberries. My husband and I both LOVED it and I definatley plan on making this again! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I was very disappointed with the way this turned out.  A better name for it would be 'Cold Cream Cheese Dessert'.  The appearance and texture is nothing like real baked cheesecake.  The taste was okay, but if you are looking for an easy way to make real cheesecake, this recipe isn't it.  Sorry!

Way too lemony for me.  Can't even taste the cream cheese.  I would only put about 1 tsp in.

This is definately a cheesecake to try. It was better than Jello's no-bake cheesecake. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves real homemade cheesecake.It was so easy to make I passed the recipe on to my cousin. She loved it!

This recipe calls for WAAAAY to much lemon juice, it tasted like a lemon cheesecake. I didnt care for it at all, but I gave it 4 stars because my husband liked it.

This is a quick and easy recipe, with the few items I had on hand.  I had only one package of creamcheese, and 1/2 cup of whipping cream, which even though was past the expiry date, it still was fresh, and tasted fine with it being no bake.  I used oreo cookie crumbs and top it will a can of cherry pie filling! My husband who doesn't prefer no bake, wanted seconds! This will be added to my favourites!

This was the best and easiest dessert I have ever made.  Think I may try something more than fresh strawberries and maybe will try some splenda to reduce the calories.  I would definately recommend this to anyone - 10 Thumbs Up!!

Wow. This was really tasty. I have been looking for a GOOD cheesecake recipe that I can modify to have less carbs and still be creamy and yummy. I used splenda instead of the sugar and made it crustless. It was fab. After reading other reviews, I decided to half the lemon juice. I was glad I did because it was perfect. Any more lemon and it would have been to lemony. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was fixed for a fundraiser for a local school club.  People raved about it wanting me to make them another for the next weekend.  Excellent recipe!!!!!!!!!!
