I love this recipe and make it a few times each month.  These are my suggested modifications:

Add an extra half red pepper and about one to two cups of fresh chopped vine-ripe cherry tomatoes.  To make it healthier - omit the butter and decrease the oil to a teaspoon or so. You really don't need it.  I've tried it with full oil and butter and without -  I can't taste the difference.  Add the grated cheese to the soup and cook for a few more minutes before serving instead of sprinkling it on the top.  I use closer to half a cup of cheese and find the flavor is better.  Also, I like to leave some of the cooked shrimp and veggies aside and only blend about 2/3 of them.  It makes the soup a little chunky and VERY yummy!  Use a sweet onion rather than yellow.  In my opinion, the yellow is too strong and the soup can come out tasting like onion and not much else.  I usually make a double batch of this and freeze it for lunches.  It's a wonderful recipe.  I'm so glad I found it.

I made this soup for my birthday dinner & it was fantastic! I used green peppers because that's what I had & I pureed it w/ my immersion blender instead of in my countertop blender. I also added another 1/2 tsp of chile sauce. This soup was  rich, creamy & flavorful but it's not enough for 6 people, served as an entree. I got four, fairly skimpy bowls out of it. My son, who is a very big eater, was raiding my fridge after dinner.  I served this w/ Pinot Grigio, a salad w/ a Honey Pear Vinaigrette, flaky croissants & Eggnog Pots de Creme for dessert. Thanks Jean!

The taste of this soup was just "ok", but I couldn't get past the texture, which as another reviewer pointed out, was awful.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least it was low fat (and only 3 weight watchers points).

This was really good! I doubled the recipe, skipped the butter, used half the amount of olive oil, green peppers (didn't have any red), and fat free evaporated milk. I also skipped the cheese at the end. I served it with raisin bread rolls.   Will def. make again!

Simple and delicious. I used red and yellow pepper with the green pepper. I also used a food processor instead of a blender after a friend told me that the blending such hot ingredients caused the soup to explode out of the blender.  And one more thing...I have also left some of the shrimp in large chunks so that it was really more of a soup than a bisque. Either way was delicious! We used the soup as the main entree with some bread on the side

Really good recipe! I left out the butter, added 3 tablespoons of flour for a rue after sauteing the red pepper and onion. Added one fresh tomato and used 1 cup of reg half & half/2 cups of skim milk. It still turned out thick enough. Used an immersion blender to get it really smooth. Excellent with crusty bread and a salad!

Just barely acceptable--but only because it's a low fat recipe.

It's sweet, and really wasn't the taste I was expecting from a bisque.  The consistency of the soup is almost like vomit, and the shrimp bits are not adequately suspended in the soup, so they kind of settle to the bottom.

The flavor is just okay.  Extra parmesan cheese seems to help.  I probably won't be making this recipe again.

I made this recipe last night when I had a couple of friends over for dinner.  Fantastic!  They both want the recipe.  It was super easy to make and was great with the French Bread Rolls to Die For from this site.  I used a bit more of the chili oil - maybe it wasn't hot enough because I could only find Thai Sweet Chili Oil. I also couldn't find no fat half and half in my regular grocery store so I used some no fat evaporated milk along with the regular half and half (equal quantities of both).  Instead of topping it with parmesan, I put a single whole shrimp and sprig of parsley on top.  I'll be making this again. Thanks for a keeper!

Delicious bisque as written. Second time, I upped raw shrimp to 1 lb., and added 20 or so chopped basil leaves, and 5 bay leaves (removed after cooking). Increased hot chile sauce to 1 teaspoon to give it more kick. This recipe is a keeper!

I say 4, but my husband says 5.  I followed another reviewer's advice by using an additional 1/2 of a red peppers and a cup or so of cherry tomatoes.  I used a vidalia onion.  I omitted the butter.  I put almost all of the soup in the blender.  The consistency didn't look so great, but it tasted good.  I added almost 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to the soup before serving, but felt it needed something else so added a little garlic powder and parsley.

This soup was AWESOME.  I only wish I had made more.  I cut this down to 2 servings, which still barely filled 1 smallish bowl.  I used real half and half (with fat) and omitted the butter.  I also used a food processor, which was kind of a disaster - I guess my food processor isn't liquid-tight.  Next time I'll separate out the non-liquid ingredients, and blend those together sans liquid and mix it together in the end.

This was really awsome  wanted to try out a soup to go with our Thanksgiving meal so I made a small batch for dinner one night. WOW!!! Lowed the low fat quality, did not put the soup in a blender just gave it a good stir and served it! Sauted a few extra shrimp to add on top.

Very good bisque; tatsy and light.  I didnt have half&half so I sued 15% cream and it was fine. I will keep this one in the rotation.  Having a huge bag of frozen shrimp on hand at all time really is so handy in the kitchen!

Awesome and sooooo easy to prepare.  Made this for lunch today and it was done in no time flat.  Used frozen,cooked jalapeno flavored shrimp.  Gave it just a "hint" of heat but the flavor was outstanding.  Thanks for a super easy, delicious meal.  I saved out a few whole shrimp for garnish but did puree the rest.

This was excellent!  Everyone loved it.  I did not use fat free half and half.  I used regular half and half but I did cut back a little.  Other than that, I followed thr recipe.

Just made this..Delicious! May sound somewhat strange, but I turned it into a pasta dish for my boyfriend. He's not much into soups/bisques, but after blending, this recipe made for a great "shrimp sauce". I served it over fettucini and added a little more grated cheese. Although I enjoyed it as a bisque.. It was a big hit all around!

This is definitely not 6 servings, maybe if you used soup crocks!  I got three soup bowls from the recipe.  I used real half & half and salted tomato sauce.  In place of the hot chili sauce I used 2 t. chili sauce, probably could have used more. I'm thinking a dab of horseradish may give  it some zip instead of the hot sauce. As another reviewer posted, I added the parm at the end instead of garnishing.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was a bit bland.  I would suggest keeping half of the shrimp whole instead of pureeing all of it. It needs something but I couldn't put my finger on it.

I actually didn't care for this as much as others seem to.  It tasted a little bland when I was done - between adding a lot of half and half plus the no-salt-added tomato sauce, the flavor was just too understated.  So I added a lot more salt and pepper, a bit more salted butter, plus some cayenne pepper - that made it pretty good.

OK.  Something about the texture did not turn out right for me.  I may have used too much shrimp...also I used regular fat half and half...perhaps its the fat-free that makes the texture right.  Easy to make though. Will look for another recipe.

Soooooo yummy! I didn't have fat free half & half (only full fat) so I omitted the butter, & threw extra little chunks of shrimp in at the end. Altogether I used a lb of shrimp. I don't usually change recipes like that but I needed to use what I had...anyway, it was life changing. Thank you for the recipe! :) Also: shrimp on its own creeps me out, so this is the ideal way to feed people who are creeped out by shrimp shrimp. If that made sense.

Double the recipe and save half. Add in one finely chopped Jalapeno pepper and use 2 tsp of SriRacha hot chile sauce. Just the right little kick!

Great flavor. Made exactly as recipe states. Deep flavor from slow cooking red peppers/onions for 15-20 minutes. Simple and light. My only problem personally was blending the soup in the food processor and it exploding all over every time I pulsed. Note that when this soup is hot, and probably due to the half and half, it will foam when pulsed (like milk in a frother). Figured out I could do extremely short pulses and it wouldn’t explode. Worth figuring out, I will definitely be making it again. My 2yo loves shrimp and loves soup, so this was a big hit with her!

Worth the effort.  This bisque is as good as it gets when it comes to shrimp bisque.  My go-to when I want to serve something impressive.  I would say you need to cut way back on the paprika.  The one time I used that massive quantity it left a very bitter aftertaste that was pretty much impossible to counter balance.

This is a great bisque!! I didn't have red bell peppers so I used chopped pimentos instead.  I also didn't have any hot sauce, so I added a touch more pepper than I normally would, a little onion powder and some ground Cayenne, which worked out just fine.

Super easy and absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe and would add more shrimp next time, only because we love shrimp!  I also seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay before I sauteed them, and added a few dashes of it to the bisque while simmering.  If you do that, you won't need much, if any, salt.  We live a few miles from Gulf Shores and can get fresh shrimp at the local seafood markets, so I can see this bisque becoming a frequent favorite! ??

It was delicious, substituted, one pint of Vanilla Silk Almond Creamer(non dairy), instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  Threw everything into a sauce pan(12 oz package of raw, shelled, tail-off shrimp).  Cooked-it for 20 min on low, since cream tended to rise-up in pan, then blended-it for 2 min, then poured into 3 bowels. I'll be making-it again, in 2 days, since I have another package of shrimp, and creamer.

Don't let the fact that this is such a simple recipe throw you, it is delicious!  I did some slight modifications: I decreased the onion to a quarter of a good sized one and increased the red pepper by half, as I notice someone else did.
Also used real half and half- come on- if I were going to make this weekly I'd go with the non-fat (which seems like an oxymoron to me, but otherwise....     I also left off the parmesan. I love cheese of any kind on just about everything , but this just doesn't need it, IMHO.   I also left off the butter - if you use real half and half you really really don't need it! Probably wouldn't even use it with the fake stuff.  Now, I did cap the bowls with puff pastry, because this is what one of my favorite  restaurants does with their lobster bisque and boy, does that work well in both recipes.

Really good stuff - added 2 tablespoons diced cilantro, 3 small diced cloves of garlic and one small diced tomato to the mix while sauteeing - sauteed the shrimp in garlic butter before adding - used 2 tablespoons of franks red hot sauce in the sauce mix - added fresh grated parmesan to the mix before blending and then served on top of half a bowl white rice with two whole shrimp, some diced cilantro and freshly grated parmesan to top the whole thing off... will make again and again!

Thanks for the recipe!  I did 1 c beef broth and 1 cup Greek yogurt instead of the 2 c half-and-half.  I pureed the soup and used 1/2 c cheddar instead of 1/4 c Parmesan.  Otherwise I made as written.  Very quick to make.

Try as I might I couldn't discern any shrimp flavor at all.  I followed directions carefully with the exception of using only half as much bell pepper and more shrimp than called for, and it still tasted like Cream of Pepper soup.  And it does have a very odd texture.  Once is enough, thank you.

This is an easy excellent recipe. I think heavy cream instead of half and half would make it even better. It would provide more richness. I think you can use crab, crawfish or scallops for more depth of flavor.

Awesome low fat soup! I didn't blend it since I prefer a chunky soup. I added a clove of minced garlic, a little garlic salt, a splash of sherry, and some oregano. Very good! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Loved it.  I added a bit more chili sauce for an extra kick.  I wouldn't mind adding a few veggies in next time.  Maybe some cubed tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, etc. Tons of ways to customize it.  Served it with a romaine/spinach salad and ciabatta bread

After cooking all the ingredients and blending in the blender I made a rue with butter and flour, then poured the pureed soup over it. Cooked untill thickened and bubbly added a little cooking sherry and it is the perfect flavors.

I tried this recipe for the first time (actually first time making any kind of bisque) and it was amazing. I'm not going to lie, I added a few extra seasonings after reading some of the reviews, but who doesn't adjust to their own taste? I made this for my parents- fully aware that my dad is the biggest food critic I know and crossed my fingers it was up to par. My dad loved it so much, I'm making it again tonight for him. Thank you!

Awesome!  I am lactose intolerant and substituted Lactaid, of all things instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and added just a touch of cream cheese.
