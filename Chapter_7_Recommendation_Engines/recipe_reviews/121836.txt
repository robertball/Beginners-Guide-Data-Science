This is the BEST pumpkin dessert recipe I have ever tried. I added pumpkin pie seasonings, cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves. Also, I did not invert it from the 9x13 pan, but just placed the frosting on top of the crust made by the cake mix and served it. My guests were practically licking the spoon at the end!

Also, if you are short on time or do not have cream cheese, I made it with just whipped topping for frosting and it was fine as well.When I made it with the powdered sugar, I cut the amount of sugar back and it was plenty sweet enough!

WOW!  This was awesome!  I've never gotten so many compliments in my life!  Even my grandma, the best cook in the world, said it was the best dish at our Thanksgiving dinner!  I added a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin and only used half of the topping because it made a TON!  I let the dessert cool in the pan for 3 hours then put it in the fridge overnight.  This morning, I had no trouble inverting it!  I lined the whole pan with wax paper, so it was very easy to tug on it while my boyfriend held it upside down.  It did take about 15 minutes longer to cook than the recipe states, but you just have to keep an eye on it.  After I iced it, I sprinkled a few chopped pecans on top just to make it pretty.  I've already been asked to bring this for Christmas!!!

I made this recipe for an annual chili/dessert cook-off among friends and I won the prize for desserts! Family members request that I make this over and over, a real keeper of a recipe. I'm off to the store to get items to make it yet again....DELICIOUS!!

This was an awesome dessert! Even my husband, who isn't a pumpkin pie lover, loved this. I baked it about 20 min. longer than the recipe said. Let a toothpick be your guide. Also, I found that when inverting the dessert it's helpful to have another set of hands! Wonderful dessert overall.

A Winner, for sure! Great alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie.  I used brown sugar (less than the white sugar called for) and also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the pumpkin part.  Went a little lighter on the melted butter and used reduced fat whipped topping and cream cheese.  I baked mine for a little longer than called for as suggested by other reviewers AND WISH I HAD NOT.  The majority of my pecans burned and had to pick them off.

These remind me of my mom! If you use fresh whipped cream instead of cool whip it makes them even better! People who don't like pumpkin pie have confessed their love for these.

Everyone, including those not fond of pumpkin pie, loved this at the Thanksgiving dinner we took it to.  I accidently bought pumkin pie mix so I used the 30 ounce can of that but didn't add the one cup of sugar.  Also subbed 12 oz. heavy cream to make whipped cream and added about 1/4 c. more powdered sugar to the cream cheese since whipped cream is not as sweet cool whip.  Once it was out people could literally not stop eating it.  We all thought it was just heavenly!!  Would give this 10 stars if I could.  Also, I made it into a trifle and it looked as beautiful as it tasted.  After cooling put half of the pumpkin pie/cake into the trifle bowl pecan side down. Spread with half the cream mix.  Put in the other half of pie/cake pecan side up, top with other half of cream mix.  I topped with whole spiced pecans and sprinkled with cinnamon.  You could do three layers if you prefer.

I made this for my girlfriend and I  two weeks ago,and we finished the whole portion of the dessert in 3 days!!!  :-) ITS DELICIOUS!!!! Now I am going to make it again today and this time add 1 Tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice as stated by another user in the reviews. I believe that it will add even more flavor. And I will sprinkle nutmeg very lightly on top of frosting.

The flavor was great, especially if you like pumpkin.  My cake fell to pieces when I inverted it.  So I layered it in my trilfe dish with the frosting.  It was yummy.

This is an awesome dessert!! I will make this again.  I did add a few things to make it closer to my recipe for pumpkin pie.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.

I took these to work yesterday, and everyone raved about them!!  I'm having to share the recipe today :)  No changes or substitutions necessary in my opinion (although I did use fat-free cream cheese and low-fat whipped cream to decrease the calorie content).  Also, before topping the dessert, I cut small pieces and placed them in cupcake paper cups and then frosted them.

Our family LOVES this recipe. I'll be  making it tonight for the second time this month. Every layer is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. When I inverted, I placed a bigger pan over it and then flipped it and it worked great.

Really, really good. HOWEVER I did add a tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 of ginger and 1/4 cloves. Also, only used an 8 oz container of cool whip. And I only had wlanuts on hand so used them instead of pecans. Made it for a church luncheon and it went over very well.

I made this for Christmas 2010 and it was a big hit with my family!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The pecans with cake mix makes the dessert have a butter brickle crunch!  So yummy...it's worth the wait.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.

I made this dessert gluten free by using Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake mix. I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice mix to the filling. We both liked it but would like more pie spice mix next time.

I like the bottom of this dessert. The nuts tasted so good with the creamy pumpkin. Mine didn’t set up like I had wanted it to. I will make it again.

Oh my gosh...this is delicious!  My son made it so easy dish.  Used 1/2 the amount of sugar.  Make sure to cool it a long time before turning it out.  We didn't even have time to frost cake and it was wonderful.

This is a very tasty dessert, but very rich!  I am rating it 4 stars because I added one teaspoon cinnamon and one half teaspoon of nutmeg to give it that pumpkin pie taste, as other reviewers did.  To cut back on some of the fat, I used low fat evaporated milk and low fat cream cheese.  I found another highly rated recipe on this site for cream cheese frosting since I realized while making the cream cheese frosting that there would not be enough for the whole dessert to be topped.  I also needed to bake the dessert much longer than the recipe states.  Everyone's favorite part of the dessert was the topping, it is so wonderfully crunchy.  I am thinking of using it on top of my favorite pumpkin bread recipe!  Next time, I would skip frosting the dessert, since it is sweet enough without it.

An absolute winner.  I added spices to the pumpkin (1 1/2 tbsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves) and made fresh whip cream using 1 1/2 c. heavy cream.  The whipped cream / cream cheese portion was about 3/4 as thick as the pumpkin portion and I thought that was perfect.  Finished it off with sprinkling nutmeg on top.

This is delicious.  I made this twice and loved it both times.  However, I made the following changes the 2nd time with better results: Used only 1 1/2 cans of pumpkin (could probably just do one can), added pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg (1 tbsp +) - definitely needs the spices added. For the topping, I used 12 oz - 1 1/2 blocks - of cream cheese (for more of the cream cheese taste), and made my own whipped topping with 1 cup of heavy cream and few tbsp of powdered sugar and vanilla (personal preference - don't care for taste of Cool Whip). Although I noticed some people said it needed to be cooked longer, the cook time was perfect for my oven. Also, both times I made this, I made the crust / pumpkin the night before. I cooked and then let it cool before covering and putting in refrigerator over night. This way, I did not have a problem inverting and pulling the wax paper the next day. Very good! The crust is unbelievable!!

Seriously delicious!  Added 1 Tablespoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice like another reviewer suggested and topped with whipped cream.  The combination of the creamy topping, smooth pumpkin center, crunchy cake and caramelized pecans is AMAZING!  Thank you for sharing this!

I tried this receipe two different ways. I fixed it the first time according to directions, it was good but my family felt it did needed a little something more.  The second time I fixed it, I took some advice from a review and added about 1/8 tea. nutmeg, 1/4 tea of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 -1/2 tea. of cinnamon.  Also, added about 1/4 cup more butter to cover all the dry cake mix because the first one, there were some dry pieces in the crust.  And added about 1/2 cup more of pecans, because we love them and I did sprinkle just a few on top when finished.  Everyone loved the second one.  It was a HUGE hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is my first review on this site even though I have been a allrecipe user for many yrs. now. This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I did make the mistake of using pumpkin pie filling instead of the real stuff and was afraid it wouldn't come out right since it was so runny before cooking it. I was totally suprised. It was perfect. We couldn't wait for it to cool so we just dolloped the frosting on top of each serving we dished out. Absolutely delicious! We def. will be using this again! Thanks!

We thought that the frosting was not needed - made it too sweet for our tastes.  The rest of the dessert was good.  I didn't have any problems with inverting it once it was done, and the nut/butter/cake mix bottom made a nice crust.  Without the frosting, it's a modified pumpkin pie.  Whether I make it again will be determined by the butter factor - 2 sticks for the crust part.  Other desserts don't require as much butter, and I'm going to have to really crave this one in order to take on those fat calories.

Awesome!  This is a sure hit with anyone who loves pumpkin.  What I liked about it the most was how easy it was to make.   The only thing I'd change would be to reduce the amount of pecans, as I just felt it was a bit of an overload.  This desert is really so good, it doesn't need icing.  Might be a better idea for those watching their weight.

I took this recipe in to work and it was a big hit.  I've had several requests for it since.  My family loves it too.  I make this recipe the lazy way and I don't bother with the wax paper and the flipping.  It's a little bit messy, but no one ever complains!  I also use pumpkin pie filling rather than plain pumpkin.

This was good; I only had pumpkin pie mix so I left out the sugar and spices just adding the eggs and evaporated milk and vanilla.  For the bottom of mine I didn't do the wax paper because I did a graham cracker crust which turned out a bit too sweet with this dessert.

OMG this was such a Huge hit at work.  Me and my 6 yr old daughter made it for my work and it was received very well.  One thing is I did not invert this cake, I could see it becoming a huge mess, so the nuts were on top and it still tasted great! 
I will be making this for the Holidays for sure and we followed the recipe and it was easy!

Love the simplicity and the ease of this autumn dessert.  I believe the filling recipe could be improved.  I used my home made granola instead of plain nuts--frosting is not needed.  Will definitely use my own filling recipe next time.  Thanks!

I LOVED this recipe!  I was skeptical at first but the end result proved me wrong!  I especially loved the frosting.  It was light, creamy, and not too sweet.  I plan on using the frosting recipe in the future for other desserts.  I made some small changes though...I used pumpkin pie mix instead of regular pumpkin puree, and skipped the pecans.  Some other reviews said to leave out the sugar if you use pumpkin pie mix but I used the 1c sugar and it turned out great!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  Some people liked the crust best, some liked the frosting the best.  This will probably be a regular fixture on the Thanksgiving table!

This is INCREDIBLE!  I served it at the first of the family Thanksgiving dinners and was asked for the recipe by everyone!  

I added 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice (perfect amount - subtle flavor) and cut down the whipped topping to an 8 oz container.  I also recommend making sure it is TOTALLY cool or it will break as it comes out of the pan.  It took more than 6 hours to cool completely for me.  Enjoy!
