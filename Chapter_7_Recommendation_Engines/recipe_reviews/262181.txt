For me the marinade was a little too tart for our taste.  I did however like the method of cooking the steaks.  Because the steaks I had were about an inch thick I cut the timing down for the oven but was still a little too done for me.

I will try the cooking method again with at least a 2 inch steak and a different marinade.

This has been my go to when my husband goes out of town. I treat myself to a nice steak. I’m too intimidated by our massive grill. This way of cooking has become my favorite especially with the marinade I grew up with. OMG it’s amazing! 1/4 cup of the following... red wine vinegar, soy sauce, dale’s, and Worcestershire. And of course, salt,pepper, and garlic the steak!

My husband really liked this. I used a 1 lb petite sirloin and splashed a little pinot noir in the pan drippings while steak was resting. Then I reduced and finished with unsalted butter. Will definitely make again.

I made it per instructions. Having never tried to cook a steak this way, I was skeptical. The outside had a perfect crust and inside it was extremely juicy and tender. I would recommend it to anyone.

Had very little time so... hoisin sauce & red grapefruit juice. Yup. Don't judge ;) It was the method of cooking that intrigued me - worked great for multiple doneness eaters - medium rare to medium. Try it!

No OJ or apple cider vinegar - still turned out well.
