Everyone loved it at the football party!  I added extra pasta and sauce to the mixture to make it more of a pasta salad with shrimp instead of a 50/50 shrimp-pasta salad.  Anyway, it was a hit at the party!

it has potential!  If I try this again I will let the shrimp "marinate" for a while to soak up tha wonderful Old Bay flavor before adding them to the rest off the ingredients.  I also think it would taste better without the onion.

thanks for this easy recipe!

Easy, attractive, flavorful and a salad I'll make again.  I used medium-sized shells and white wine vinaigrette instead of the italian dressing.

We really enjoyed this! I would never have thought to add Old Bay to shrimp salad, let alone combine it with Italian dressing (I made my own).  I thought green pepper might be a little too bold for the delicate flavor of the shrimp so I used the milder, sweeter, yellow and red bell peppers instead.  I cut way back on the onion and added some artichokes, which I quartered (frozen, thawed peas would have been nice too).

This was a great recipe. Its was just okay the first day and terrific the second once the flavors had a chance to meld. I have to agree with another reviewer that it would be much better without the onion. it was a bit over powering. Next time I will leave that out and maybe just thrown in some (like a tbs) of the minced dried onions.

I adjusted the quantities to serve 4, then made this exactly as written as far as the dressing.  (I used orange and yellow peppers instead of red and green.)  When I served this with a lemon wedge, my guest could not stop raving about the flavor!  Just enough zing to the dressing without that heavy, over-dressing-ed feeling.  Big winner!

Excellent light summer salad!  Wonderful flavor and easy to prepare as well.  Might add a few frozen peas and some hard cooked eggs next time for variety.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for some friends and they keep begging me to make more of it.  Excellent recipe.  I did add one thing.  I add some crabmeat as well.  The best.

Very Good! We had a huge crowd here for the 4th so I upped the servings to 12. I used an entire box of med shell pasta, left out the onion and replaced the green bell pepper with a yellow one (personal preference).  I was a little nervous when I tasted it right after mixing everything together because it was almost too tangy or "sharp". But after it chilled for a couple of hours it was perfect. We will make this again.

When I first mixed this up and tasted it I thought it was too tangy, but after letting it set in the fridge a few hours, the flavors mellowed and it tasted great! I had a bag of small salad shrimp to use up, so I just used that. Also, I subbed orange bell pepper for the red. We really enjoyed the flavor that the Old Bay Seasoning gave and I would definately make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for my family and they LOVED it.  I then made it for my office Christmas Party and I have had to make a lot of copies of the recipe to give to my co-workers.  It is a keeper.  I made it without the shrimp.
