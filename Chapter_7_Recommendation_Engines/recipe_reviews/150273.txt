I submitted this recipe, and the serving size varies, depending on how thick you like to spread your pimento cheese and what size sliced bread you use. The restaurant used jalapeno bread, but I serve it on honey seven-grain.

Awesome, Awesome Awesome recipe!!  My husband and  I loved this stuff!  The only changes I made were to sub onion powder for the grated onion, and I used the packaged real bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  I also added a but more mayo - maybe 2 T more just for personal taste.  Overall, fantastic pimento cheese..  Oh, and don't forget the avocado,  Never would've thought it belonged on a pimento cheese sandwich but it REALLY goes well.  Thanks for a great recipe..

FANTASTIC!! We love this in our home! It is a constant, and friends and family are always requesting it! The only thing I do different is use onion powder instead of grated onion for my picky husband! We have also discovered it is great as a dip/spread at a party with toasted baguettes. We LOVE putting it (generously) on a slice of sourdough, sticking it in the toaster over, and letting it just start to brown on the top....it is so melty and gooey! Perfect recipe.....think I will go make it now! =0)

This was good but WAY too much of the pimento cheese bread for 2 sandwiches.  Great flavor and my first pimento cheese ever making, MUCH better than the premade stuff at the store!  I used a sliced pumpernickel bread and it was a nice combination!

It tasted like salty fat.  The creamy "sauce" was not even spicy.

We like sharp cheddar, so I made it with all cheddar. I left out the avocado and the bacon and served it to my guests at a bridal shower for my daughter.  Everyone wanted the recipe and said they never had pimento cheese so good. Thanks!!!

My husband and i loved this sandwiches! I substituted the cheddar cheese for Soy cheddar chesse and used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and it was still very tasty.

I doubled this recipe and forgot to get cream cheese so I added more mayo. I rated this 5 stars cause I don't see how homemade pimento cheese can get any better. The jalapeno pepper flavor made  it

I have a serious love affair with pimiento cheese and have been looking for a go-to at home. I’ve tried many and this is by far the best. So very, very good.

I lived in the south for 20+ years, and was never overly fond of pimento cheese spread...but this is terrific!  I’ve handed out the recipe to a few friends, and one told me yesterday that he makes it all the time for his kids.....they put it on toasted bagels!!  Perfect as written.  Thank you

I bought a jar of pimentos not too long ago and went in search of a recipe to use them.  I found this one.  I have never had pimento cheese before but I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  My husband literally inhaled his first sandwich and promptly went back for a second.  My son and I thought they were pretty tasty too.   I did not change a thing except I had an extra teaspoon of pimento left and just threw it in.  It wasn't enough to hold on to for another recipe... We didn't find it very spicy, which is okay because it was still scrumptious.
I went to the meat counter at my local grocery and purchased thick cut applewood smoked bacon for these sandwiches and served it on toasted light rye bread.    We had a little of the cheese mixture and 2 slices of bacon leftover.  I chopped up the bacon and mixed it in with the cheese and we ate that with crackers the next day for lunch.  Yummy!

This flavor combination is wonderful!  I fixed the cheese mixture beforehand, and we split a sandwich for breakfast a couple of days during the Christmas holidays.  I did sub onion powder for the onion and Miracle Whip for the mayo and left out the jalapeño, so doubled the cayenne.  Delicious - thanks for sharing
