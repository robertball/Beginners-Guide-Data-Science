This did not work for me.  The pork turned out very tough.  I even bought the rock sugar online to make it.  Nothing like the picture and I followed the directions.

The sauce was not what I'd expected but I couldn't get the rock sugar so had to use regular table sugar. Will do it again with all the correct ingredients
