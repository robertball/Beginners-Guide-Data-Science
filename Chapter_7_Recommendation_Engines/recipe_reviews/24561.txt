Is this a joke? I tried to make this recipe and it came out like taffy! A big gooey mess! I followed the recipe and used a candy thermometer to reach the right temp. I did nothing wrong and wasted all these ingredients! Is the recipe wrong is something missing? What a waste of time and money!!

I don't know if this is a joke, but I didn't think it was funny, after spending over $10.00 on ingredients and it turned out like taffy. I even thought I made a mistake when cooking it, and recooked it to firm it up, and ended up with a rock-hard taffy stuck pan. Apparently SUZY does not know what fudge is! DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE!

Maple fudge is hard to make, that's for sure, but this recipe will work as it's close to one I've made.  I went through a lot of maple before getting it right. 

The recipe I've used is 2 cups maple syrup (not pancake syrup), 1/2 cup light (table) cream, and a pinch of salt.  That's it.

You have to get the temperature high enough, near 240F.  Coating the side of the pan with butter will help prevent boilover.  Don't stir it while it cooks.

Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool to 110F.  Don't stir.

Using a wooden spoon mix for about 3-4 minutes.  If you don't mix it enough it won't set up, and if you mix it too much it will seize in the pan, becoming a hard mass almost instantly.  I've erred both ways.  It will look less glossy when it's ready.

Turn the fudge into the pan and let it sit.  And that's it.  I think maple fudge is harder to make than other fudges.  There is a lot less room for error with this recipe, so if you're not just fiddling around for fun (and you'd be upset if you lost a few dollars worth of syrup) then try something more likely to succeed.

I have to agree with the last review. My mother and I made this fudge and it came out like taffy. Something is definitely missing. I would strongly recommend that you do not use this recipe unless you want a batch of goo you can't use.

I followed the advice of a previous poster and added 1 cup granulated sugar and it was delicious!  I made some for Christmas goodie bags and brought the leftovers for Christmas dinner and everyone went crazy over it.  Interestingly, I came upon a candymaking book from the 1950's or 60's which has this original recipe without the granulated sugar.  That makes me want to try it withoug the sugar but based on the reviews I think I'd just be wasting 2 cups of nice Grade B syrup.  When I find the book again I'll compare the directions and see if that's where the problem is.

This recipe will work if you add 1 cup of white sugar. Follow the rest of the recipe and it is good. I tried this today and it failed the first time. I saw people mention sugar and I reheated my bad batch, added 1 cup of white sugar, let cool to 110f and then beat with wooden spoon until well mixed. Let cool and it set up perfect.

Actually, I think she forgot to list the 1 cup of white sugar that is needed.  I have seen almost the exact same recipe(several places)...excepting that it also requires 1 cup of sugar and 1 tbsp flour.
I haven't tried either recipe...but will try it using the sugar.  If it works out well, I will post the other recipe.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a cup of white sugar (I skipped on the flour. Flour in fudge???). Anyways, it came out spectacular! I couldn't have been more pleased! I am so glad I took a chance with this recipe (with the missing ingredient: an added cup of sugar, of course!).

Don't even try it! I had the same experience as others who complained. I started with the original recipe but when it just didn't sound right, I added the cup of sugar & tbsp flour (flour in fudge???) someone suggested. It took quite a while to get this to boil on low, so it ended up to be a significant waste of time (and ingredients). I used a candy thermometer, was very careful and precise. I make killer chocolate fudge and peanut butter fudge, so it's not me, I swear! :) It was this sticky, taffy-like glop. I think it ruined my mixer, the taffy spun up the beaters and into the holes where the beaters are inserted. Switched to a wooden spoon and got a sore shoulder!! Decided maybe I'd put it in the oven and make a brittle out of it (didn't want to waste it and didn't remember the popcorn ball idea), but it didn't work.

First off I should tell everyone that though the ingredients to this recipe are correct the instructions are too vague. The original creator of this recipe is much more detailed in her description of what to do. The first two steps are pretty close to the original but when Suzy means lukewarm it should be more specifically around 120 F, this will take around half an hour to reach.  And I believe the main reason most people are having trouble with it setting up is because they are not beating it long enough. You first off all need a stand mixer (heavy duty is the best) because the mixture is so thick. Then you beat on a medium speed until it loses its gloss like she said, however the proper loss of gloss comes after about 7-10 minutes of continuous beating (another good reason to use a stand mixer). The end result will be an attractive pale tan color, pretty much a few shades darker than an eggshell white. I hope people take my advice and try this recipe again because it really is a good one, if only the instructions were a bit more specific.

I've made this recipe twice this week and both time it turned out excellent! I madfe it without any changes or additions to the ingredient list. A coupke of suggestions for anyone having trouble: make sure you use the appropriate size sauce pan, if its too large the mixture heats too unevenly since you are not stirring it. Be patient, especially when waiting for it to get to the correct temp, it may take a while, but its imprtant fot it to hit at least the lower end of the soft ball stage 234. Lastly, do not use a machine of any sort to stir the cooled fudge, it is very thick and may burn out the motor. also if you stir by hand you are less likely to miss the turn point. Again be patient, those who complained about the mixture not hardening most likely did't stir it long enough, I got blisters stirrin the first batch, but i finally set.

OMG - I can't believe how many people ended up with the same mess. This recipe should be removed. It's incomplete, I had a foggy memory about fudge making and chose this as the first one. Man..EXPENSIVE (TIME & MONEY)- results..I put it in the freezer and it's still not settled, that was like..a year or two ago. But this is the recipe I followed, it never did anything but GOO. Because it was so costly to make, I use it to top sweet potatoes in the over, or as a ham glaze - it's just syrup.

This recipe turned out sticky and gooey for me too.  We decided to use it to make popocorn balls which turned out pretty good. This is something you can do if the fudge turns out bad for you too.

I have used this recipe 3 times and have received rave reviews on the end product. I cook the mixture to 234 degrees. As the fudge winds up just a bit soft, I sprinkle chopped walnuts on lightly greased waxed paper, add the stirred fudge, and roll into a log.  It makes a wonderful maple nut roll. I like that I don't have to add additional white sugar. It is a pure Maple product...YUM!

So, I decided not to take any chances and added about 3/4 c sugar to this, and had no problems at all. (Even though syrup has plenty of sugar in it!) I didn't quite have 2 c syrup left so I added a bit more half-and-half. Once it cooled down to about 115F, I only had to mix it for a few minutes before it was ready to go in the pan. I added the vanilla and some crumbled up maple bacon for a salty twist, and it turned out GREAT.

I was already in the middle of making this when I read the reviews.  I was so worried!  I didnt have a candy thermometer, I had planned to just wing it! ...and I did.  I left out the nuts because I like just maple and this is by far the best I've ever had. I have been buying my maple fudge from the same place for over 20 years.  Never again!  it cant compare.  I am sad to hear the issues people have making this because it's so stinkin good!  I used my kitchen aid mixer on med high for 7 min after it got to room temp.  good luck!!

I made this exactly as told and only brought it to 135 degrees (soft ball stage) and it turned out like caramel, not fudge.
I'm rather disappointed and will not try this again.

I did this perfectly but came out with a soft taffy. It was tasty, and I rolled it into wax paper for candy. . .but I wanted fudge! I don't have a clue what I did wrong, but I know that I have never seen another fudge recipe without marshmallows and using so much maple syrup. It seems inevitable that this would turn out as a candy. I should have known better as an avid candy maker. . .I was just hoping to go healthier this year at Christmas.

I had a recipe for maple syrup fudge years ago and couldn't find it. I remembered that it only took about four ingredients, so I thought maybe this was it. I tried it twice. The first time it was impossibly burned before it ever got to softball stage. I thought maybe I just tried to cook it too fast since you aren't supposed to stir it after it boils. So I cooked it on a lower temperature and watched it very closely, taking it off the heat as soon as my thermometer read softball. It was still slightly scorched in the middle of the pan. But mainly it isn't fudge at all. It is more like taffy or maple flavored caramels. It isn't bad tasting, but I wanted fudge.

The fudge tasted OK, but the texture was horrible! The temp never made it to 240F after 45 minutes the mixture went  dark brown (guess I was making toffee). Adding the walnuts turned the mixture into moon rocks. Here's a photo, albeit not a good one.

The "Beat mixture until it thickens and loses its gloss." that she speaks of is about 7 to 8 minutes normally. I would guess that those of you who got a taffy consistency, didn't beat it that long. I use my kitchenaid with the paddle attachment. It then needs to be chilled as with any fudge.

I am glad I read the other reviews.  I followed this to the letter and ended up with maybe a limp taffy.  I thought it might have been me so I purchased more ingredients to try again.  I will look for another recipe.
