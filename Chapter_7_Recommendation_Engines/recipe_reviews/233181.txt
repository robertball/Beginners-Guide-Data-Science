It's delicious and you can use a gluten free cornbread mix to make it tolerable to those folks too.  I add a small can of diced green chilies and a cup of grated Monterey Jack. Used low-fat sour cream.  I think you could also make a version with finely chopped broccoli and sharp cheddar too.

I made double the recipe for a dinner party.  It was a huge hit.  Folks asked me for the recipe.  It's good hot, warm or cold.

This was really good but I think I'll add some sugar to it next time.
