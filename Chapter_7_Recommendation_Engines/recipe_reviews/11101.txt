VERY GOOD! I took the suggestion of adding an extra 1/2 cup of cereal, and the consistency was perfect...not too sticky and gooey.  The vanilla really adds to the flavor, and using real butter is highly recommended.  I do suggest either making a double batch for the 9X13 pan, or using a 9X9 or 8X8 for the original amount; I like thicker bars.  Thanks Karen.

RICE CRISPIE BARS = GOOEY OR WHY MAKE THEM!??  Great recipe - vanilla is a nice touch.  I always melt my butter in the microwave and then mix in the marshmellows.... microwave another 15 seconds then mix in the cripies.  Easier than than the pan.  I like them thick also, so I make them in a 7 x 11 brownie pan.

The recipe was pretty good following the original recipe.  I thought that it had a bit of a gritty/powdery taste to it. With the second batch I increased the cereal to 6 cups and added a tablespoon of the vanilla,and a teaspoon of corn syrup.  They were so much better. Everyone loved them.

Perfect!  I've never made rice crispie treats with vanilla, but it adds a great softness to the flavor. These are perfect as-is, but I just made a batch for Saint Patrick's day with these changes:  cut back a little on the butter, went a little heavy on the marshmallows, and instead of vanilla I added (of course) green food coloring (about 10-12 drops for a double batch) and a few tablespoons of Irish Cream liquor.  After I patted this into a 13x9 pan, I topped it with 1/4 cup each white, milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips, which I had melted and mixed with a tablespoon of butter and another few tablespoons of Irish Cream (this is the top layer of the Irish Cream Truffle Fudge recipe found here!).  It spreads on top in a thin layer.  They're a hit here!!

If you like gooey then look no farther. Like previous people I use the microwave. For the best flavor use real butter,.. a little extra doesn't hurt! ;)I also doubled the vanilla extract, and added an additional 1/2 cup of rice crispy cereal. I pressed into heart shaped pans and will be sending out "care packages" to my kids who are away at Universities. They'll be thrilled to have this childhood favorite. Thanks!

These are excellent as is.  Gooey and tasty.  I made a few changes for later batches: 1/2 tsp vanilla (to make the taste a bit more mild), 5 cups rice crispies, also I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips after I had almost completely mixes the bar mix (after they were not really warm).  The butter and marshmallows amounts were the same.  They produced great results.  By waiting to add chips until after somewhat cool you keep the chips from melting into the marshmallow and getting messy. I preferred them this way for pops of chocolate flavor.

I know this sounds ridiculous but I DON'T make Rice Krispe Bars - I tend to burn the marshmellow (or something) b/c they ALWAYS - NEVER FAIL - Come out hard as a rock!! Therefore, I always let my mom make them until last night!! I did increase the krispies by a 1/2c and THEY WERE SOFT!! They are marshmellowy but not soggy! (I might try 5c of rice krispies next time - keep your fingers crossed that this increase won't ruin them). I will keep using this recipe b/c it was the first time these worked for me!! Thanks Karen!

Since my kids are long grown and gone I haven't made these in ages, but when I found strawberry flavored marshmallows on the store shelf I decided to make an old favorite with a new twist. They turned a pretty pink and were flecked with the handful of dried mixed berries I threw in for color and interest. I liked this recipe for its addition of vanilla and for the extra gooiness, as the original calls for more Rice Krispies to the same amount of marshmallows. However, after adding four cups of cereal I agree with some others that it needed another half cup. I used an 8x8" pan for thicker bars. Other than learning I don't care for these made with strawberry flavored marshmallows (tho' I'm sure kids would love it!) these were great!

You know I always wondered what I was doing wrong when I followed the recipe on the popular rice cereal box. Now I know that I was adding six cups of cereal as the recipe directed and that was FAR too much. Plus, the vanilla just really takes these from good to YUM. Now I can make rice crispy treats that taste like I remember them tasting as a kid. I added a tad more than 3 tablespoons of real butter (maybe 1/4 tablespoon more) and a scant 1/4 extra crispy rice cereal, which is the only reason I'm not giving this five full stars. The brand name crispy cereal should take a note from this recipe! Thanks so much. It will be the only one I use now.

Oh, these were so easy and good.  Definitely a no fail recipe.  I didn't add the vanilla, but they were still good without it.  I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks Karen.

Yummy and quick to make.  Vanilla adds that extra flavor to make the delicious!  However, definitely need to double the batch if you want to fill a 9x13 pan.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I hadn't made MarshMallow Krispie Treats for ages, there wasn't a recipe on the box or bag, and I forgot my recipe so tried this, and it is much better than my old one! The Bars are really gooey, very good and stay fresh for days if stored in airtight containers.

Love the recipe just the way it is. The first time I read reviews first so added more rice krispies which made them not as gooey. the next time I thought I had enough rice krispies but apparently someone had helped themself to the cereal so i had about 1/4 cup less than the recipe called for. That actually made them pretty gooey and tastey. I am sure when I make the recipe the 3rd time with the right amount of ingredients it calls for it'll be just right. I did add a tad bit more vanilla and some m&m's for the holiday (xmas and valentines day). The only change is i would DEFINITELY double the recipe. This recipe only makes a small pan's worth, or very thin bars. Delicious recipe - will make forever!

Not much new you can do to good old fashioned rice krispie treats but I did like the addition of vanilla.  I think I used the whole 10oz. bag of regular size marshmallows & about 5 cups of krispies.  This left them nice and gooey!

Growing up, my mom ALWAYS used vanilla in her rice krispie treats, so I've always made them that way as well and will teach my daughter to do the same. Quick and easy to whip up, these are always delicious and a good go-to dessert or snack. I just made a pan for my daughter's Valentine's party, added some red food coloring (just enough to tint them pink) and used a heart-shaped cookie cutter to make them into individual hearts. I finished them off by sprinkling them with some red/pink/white edible confetti hearts. I'm going to have to use ALL my willpower NOT to eat these little beauties!

Very good recipe I also did the 6 cups of cereal ; and also just used what ever cereal I had in the cupboard a variety. Makes it look cool and fun for the kids too !!  But didn't put into a pan just to "blobs" of the mixed marshmallow mixture then wrap in saran wrap and it's easy to go ! If it gets a bit hard just microwave for 10 seconds and yummy !!

Didn't use stove.  Microwaved the butter, vanilla, and Elyon (fat free/gluten free) marshmallows.  Used Natures Path brown rice puffs.  Made into balls instead of bars.  A fun way to spend family time together on a rainy day!  2 year old loved it.  Husband wouldn't stop sneaking in bites.

We LOVE this recipe.  This is the most perfect rice krispie we have ever had.  Gooey and all.  What I do is put a sandwich bag over my hand, then spray the bag with pam and press the krispies into the dish/pan.  It works so well, it does not stick at all.  Try it.  Props for this recipe!!! :)

I hadn't made Rice Krispie treats in forever, mostly because I had forgotten about them. Then my 21/2 year old discovered them at the grocery store one day, so I decided I'd rather make my own. This was a great recipe- I like the addition of the vanilla. I added just a touch more cereal since some people seemed to have "sticky" problems, and it came out perfect. I also sprinkled those M&M baking mini candies across the top, which gave it a nice extra-sweet touch. Only thing to note is to put the M&Ms on RIGHT AWAY, because they won't stick once the marshmallow starts to set. Next time I might just stir them in!

The vanilla is a delightful touch.  This recipe doubles nicely, for extra-thick bars in the same well-buttered 9x13 pan.

Great recipe, doubled it but still kept it in the 9x13 in pan and it turned out fantastic.  Also added vanilla to give a touch of flavor.

My hubby likes the Bars we get from the store and wanted to try to see if we could make our version of theirs.  Used this recipe and added the xtra 1/4 cp RC, 1 cp Peanuts, 3/4 cp Raisins, 1/2 cp Almonds and 1 1/3 cp Choc Chips.  Taste just as good as the ones we get from the store!

double the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan.  Add 2 tsp of corn syrup and 1-2 Tbs of cocoa powder.  Add melted chocolate to the top and it's perfectly gooey and yummy!

Gooey = good.  These are the kind they don't tell you about on the box of Rice Krispies.  Great recipe! I also added the extra 1/2 cup of cereal per batch and doubled the batch.  I made mine with my daughter today in the microwave, and added about a cup of crushed peppermint hard candies, and sprinkled red sugar on top and they were pretty and best of all, delicious.

These were great!  Chewy and delicious.  Other recipes are too dry, so I was looking for one that stayed gooey and this definitely fit!

I doubled the recipe for a 9 by 13 pan. These bars are also great with 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or 1/2 cup of chopped M&Ms. Once, I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of coconut flavoring and added 1/2 cup of chopped flaked sweetened coconut. It was delicious!

This was a bad idea... these are so good I ate almost half of them this afternoon! I love the addition of the vanilla (I did use 1 tablespoon). I only had 2 cups of marshmallows, so I used about 4oz of marshmallow creme to make up the rest of it. So simple, yet so good. :)

I made these and they came out perfectly.  I did substitute almond flavoring for the vanilla, which came out nicely.  Everyone gobbled them all up.

Seems funny to rate these, since I've been making them for years. I normally use the recipe on the cereal box, but the addition of vanilla extract in this one interested me, and it has less cereal than I normally use, although I did add about 1/2 cup more. I added 1/2 semi-sweet/white chocolate swirl& 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top and after 2 minutes in a 350 degree oven, they were ready to spread. Good, dependable recipe, Karen--thanks for sharing.

These turned out great.  I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons and it didn't affect the outcome.  The only thing I would do different next time is make a double batch!  Thanks Karen!

too much marshmallow.. makes the rice crispies soggy. And the bottom goes soggy... you have to take them out of the tin to dry them out before they're set.

How can you go wrong?  For a fun twist, I used a pie tin, subbed some of the plain rice cereal with some fruity rice cereal, then topped with chocolate and butterscotch chips.  I sliced like a pizza and the kids went wild for the new desert pizza.  I've also used chocolate rice cereal and peanut butter chips.  Go wild!  The possibilities are endless!  Try with different cereals, shapes and decorate for holidays....  Always quick and fun.

Delicious and simple for kids to prepare. Ours turned out a little harder than preferred, but still a family favorite. Thinking maybe next time using a different brand of marshmallows.

Very easy. Absolutely needs to be poured in an 8x8 pan (I think the author of the original recipe must have stated 9x13 by accident). I don't think adding a 5th cup of krispies would have made it better either, however I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon immediately after the vanilla. Yum :)

I sortof guessed at all the measurements - had to finish off 2 bags of marshmallows and start another for this batch of squares, added more butter, and 1 tbsp vanilla, 2 tsp corn syrup, 8 cups rice crispies... they turned out great! I also added some chocolate chips.

these were really a decent recipe. I normally follow the cereal box when making them. I do like the slight addition of vanilla to this recipe. Crispie Treats are always a winner and when you add a bit of chocolate and M&M's to them...awww you've struck it rich with the kiddo's!

These were great! NOTE: don't let the butter burn, slow and steady wins this race! If the butter burns it will make these tough and of course bad tasting.  I added half a cup of creamy PB to the marshmallow, and cocoa rice crispy instead of plain! Greased the pan and let sit over night. Then I double boil some chocolate chips and a TBSP of peanut butter and drizzled it over the done bars ... sooo yummy!! Great base of a recipe!!

These are awesome!!! I should have taken the advice of doubling the recipe. I only filled half of my pan for the desired thickness. I also just used my hands to flatten the Krispies into the pan because wax paper sticks so bad. Just make a nice thick layer of butter on your fingers so it doesn't stick to your fingers and go to town:)

Who hasn't made this? I first learned how to make krispie bars way back in preschool. Now, I'm teaching my kids early! Be careful not to make them too often....they are quite addictive! TIP: Try this with yogurt-covered Cheerios.
Even better!

YUM, the vanilla was suprisingly good! I have made these twice.  Once just the way it says with pink food coloring, the other time I cut back a little w/the marshmellows, add some creamy peanut butter, and chopped peanuts! Yumm!! I wouldve posted a picture of those, but they were soo good, and yummy the family made a mess of them before I could get the camera!

I made these on the stovetop.  I love how they include vanilla.  I don't think I've made Rice Krispie treats since high school!  My kids LOVED making these.  I let them stir, and then press them in the pan.  Then we sprinkled them with sprinkles.  Most of them are gone already!

Easy-peasy lemon-squeasy.  I just made these with my four-year old daughter.  (I measured and supervised; she poured and stirred.) Now these are the "best-ever.  Thanks, Mom."  I did use the extra 1/2 cup crispies and I can't image this would have worked without it.  They are super-gooey.  I flipped the whole pan of them over in the 13x9 I used so both sides are lightly coated in Pam.  That seems to have helped keep the goo off our fingers.  According to my daughter we will have to make this again.  Thank-you, Karen.  My organic rice cereal didn't have this recipe on the box.;)

So easy and so good (according to my husband and kids anyway - they're not really my scene so I didn't try them).  I did as others suggested and added an extra 1/2 cup of rice krispies and they were perfect.  Thanks for the tip on using a wet spoon to press it into the pan, it worked well.

I added about six Hershey's kisses to the butter/marshmallow mixture for just a hint of chocolate.  I also took others recommendations of adding an extra half cup of cereal and put the bars in an 8X8 pan instead of a larger pan.  I tasted a little bit of the bars and they are very good.

These were a hit with the kids.  A little on the sticky side.  I made them twice, but next time I will probably add a little more cereal to make them less sticky.  First time I stirred in chocolate and butterscotch chips (YUM!) but they melted a bit, even though I waited for it to cool a bit. Second time around I put mini m&m's on the top just after smoothing into pan.  That worked great.

The recipe itself is good! By adding the extra 1/2 cup of cereal, it's just gooey enough. However, next time I would double the recipe as it only fills half of a 9X13 pan which makes the squares themselves very thin and overall quite small. Other than that, I am very happy with the recipe.

Made these for my fiancé’s birthday and they turned out great. I found that using wax paper to press it down made a sticky mess so I used a plastic bag with butter on it, worked perfectly! Also I found that approximately 9 normal marshmallows equals 1 cup (36 mallows = 4 cups). Super yummy!

Perfect Rice Crispies. I’ve tried other recipes that used a whole stick of butter and I don’t think it really improved them. The vanilla is what makes all the difference!

Too gooey to make as is. Melt 3 Tbsp butter on low heat, mix in 1 Tbsp of favorite extract, such as vanilla or strawberry) and marshmallows. Mix in 6 cups of Rice Krispies and use your buttered fingers to press it into the pan.

Absolutely better than the recipe on the box.  Make a double batch and then put it in the 9x13 pan.  If you cook on an electric stove, melt your butter and marshmallows on #2.  Add the vanilla after the stuff is melted and just before you pour in the cereal.  Using waxed paper to press it didn't really work out for me.  Just press it with a spoon and eat the sticky bits off the spoon when you're done.  Takes a decent while to set.  Don't try to whip it up and run out the door, it won't be set.  HOWEVER, you can cut it while not perfectly set and wrap in plastic wrap and it will finish setting without sticking to the plastic wrap.  Yay!

Made these at written, but added candy sprinkles that I had just for fun. These treats are just like the ones I remember eating as a kid. Very easy to make. I used the back of my plastic spoon to press treat mix into pan & it worked very well, with no sticking.

I used a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows, 2 table spoons of vanilla and 6 cups of rice crispies. Turned out great. Also, give your spatula a quick coat of cooking spray when you’re ready to spread them into the pan. Makes it easier to make them good and flat, and evenly spread.

This recipe was easy and turned out wonderful. I doubled the recipe and added a package of crumbled Oreos. Big rice crispie treats with Oreos. I just made sure everything was portioned out and ready before I started so I could get moving quickly. So yummy

The recipe is easy to make overall great! I didn't read any reviews prior to making this but I can see why many suggested to add a little extra cereal. I found that our treats very soft and could have used an extra 1/2 cup + to hold the treats together. I made them into balls for Halloween! Just add some dye to the butter and marshmallow for a fun holiday theme.

Instead of lightly coating the pan with cooking spray I fully and thickly coated it and used a wet spoon to push it down. The vanilla made it SO GOOD!

I doubled the recipe & put in a 9X13 pan that I had coated with butter.  I did my melting of the mallows in the microwave along with the butter & vanilla added.  I just heated in 15 sec. intervals (high) for 1 min. 15 sec. (stirring after each 15 second heating) til it was easily smoothed when stirring; added the cereal & used a piece of parchment paper to pack it firmly into the buttered pan.  So easy!

I always add an extra tablespoon of butter, extra handful of marshmallows and then about half cup or so less of rice krispy cereal therefore, I have a less dry bar ( a much better ratio). Any standard recipe I have ever tried does not contain a more marshmallow texture, and I think you all are missing out. Love the addition of vanilla.

Pardon my photo, it got consumed before I was able to take a photo. Anyways, kind of too gooey for me even after addinga half cup of rice crispies, probably because of our humid temperature? I think next time will be 5 cups of rice crispies for me. I love that this recipe have vanilla though. I added chocolates and M&ms and Reese's. But truthfully, I loved it as it is without any chocolate.

5 stars with an extra cup of rice crispie, not sure how 4 cups would have turned out. I added 4-5 Tbsp of green and red sprinkles and used Christmas themed cookie cutters to get fun holiday shapes.

Just made it- super fast, and SUPER EASY!  I did not make any changes to the base recipe, but had a 'Sugar, Chocolate & Coffee Bean' seasoning grinder from Trader Joe's- gave about 20 turns of the grinder into the melted butter/vanilla mix. Cereal bars just got a NEW twist!  (And go even better with a cup of coffee heaven!) This recipe was perfect!

Loved these. I think the vanilla really added a lot to them. I used this recipe at Christmas and made them green and shaped them into wreaths. A (chef) friend commented how good they were and asked what I did differently because they were better than regular krispie bars.

Add the extra 1/2 cup cereal like others suggested and use an 8x8 or 9x9 pan instead.  I cant even imagine trying to use a 9x13 because they would be soooooo thin!  For fun, we mixed in rainbow nonpareils (sprinkles) which made them even better!

Yum! I personally like the bars to be on the chewer and gooey side, so the was perfect for me!
I use any type of cereal on hand, it doesn't have to be Rice Krispies cereal so this is a very versatile recipe. I also add in different candies and chocolate or raisins depending on my mood!

SO YUMMY! My boyfriend likes them not-so-marshmellow-y, so we added 5 cups of rice Krispies to the 4 cups of marshmellows and it was fantastic. I used a smaller, thicker pan to get the size we wanted. A couple of times we put chocolate chips in them, and we actually agreed that they weren't as good with them! Coming from two chocolate lovers, that says a lot about this recipe!

I love these! I do add a bit more cereal - before the marshmallows are all melted. My gluten- free dieting friends (and everyone) give these high praise ??

I made this twice.  The first time, following another reviewers suggestion, I added more cereal and it was way too dry, but the second time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!!  The vanilla is the key to making it extra special!

A classic, favourite treat...who doesn't love rice krispie squares?!!!  I hadn't made these in awhile and had some rice krispies and marshmallows that needed to be used.  SO YUMMY!  My two older boys dug right in after school to snack on!

Great recipe!!!  Why didn't I think of adding vanilla!?!  I love the addition of the vanilla, it seems to give them a warmer flavor.  I added a 1/2 cup on peanut butter in with the marshmallows as they were melting.  They turned out great!!  Thanks  I'm going to make more this weekend, at least a double batch.

These are yummy. Make sure you use salted butter. I used unsalted and they just weren't as I expected. But, they are great, I doubled the recipe and I'll be making more!

These are not typically found in UK, but had a craving for them and have made so many batches...use 5 cups of cereal instead of 4, makes them nicer..HUSBAND loves these..AND HE would eat the whole pan in one sitting, I use a smaller pan as it makes them thicker. Have used this recipe for years

I had to add about a cup of extra rice crispies after mixing everything together, just to give this a good texture. Not a bad recipe, but I've had better and I'm not sure how one would even improve upon this as it's so simple. Thanks anyways:)

Perfect proportions of Rice Krispies to marshmallow.  Nice and chewy and not too dry! Thanks for the recipe!
