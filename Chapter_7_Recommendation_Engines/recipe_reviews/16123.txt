I made this salad for Thanksgiving dinner and I have to agree with other reviewers that it would be best if you cut back the amount of spices used. Also a bit more cool-whip would help it. It is good though and I would try it again!

This Ambrosia was one of the first to go at a recent salad/dessert bar I hosted. For personal preference I omitted half the coconut, half the marshmallows, half the cool whip, the can of fruit cocktail, 3/4 the nutmeg and 1/2 the cinnamon. Instead I used half sour cream and half coolwhip in the dressing, and chopped fresh oranges in place of fruit cocktail. As you can see, I changed it quite a bit. But it was a definite hit, and I will make my version again. Thanks Kimberly.

I tried this recipe "as is" and then made it again with half the coconut and half the spices.  Much better in my opinion with just half of these ingredients.

Consensus seems to be reduce/omit cinnamon & nutmeg & reduce coconut by 1/2 so I did.   Also reduced Cool Whip by 1/2 and added 1/2 Sour Cream.   
Added fresh fruits in season:  strawberries, blueberries, peaches & apple.   AND, used 1/2 white mini marshmallows and 1/2 coloured mini marshmallows for a bit of colour. 
MMMMMMmmmmmmm !!!

This recipe reminds me of a salad my grandma made while I was growing up!  I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg and added about 12 ozs. of Cool Whip and 1 3/4 cup coconut!  My guests loved this easy and simple recipe!

This was based on Ambrosia but not a true Ambrosia. I am a true southern cook and never have I heard of adding cinnamon or nutmeg to Ambrosia. Check out the web and you will see you won't find those ingredients in any true Ambrosia. Now that is not to say you cannot add different fruits to Ambrosia . Ambrosia is one of the true southern dishes we have. She also added far too many marshmallows. Usually a cup and a half is what is called for but whatever suits your preference . Same with the coconut - too much again, usually 1 1/2 cups, again preference . Also most people use pecans in this dish but I have seen it made with walnuts - again preference, however since pecans are grown in the South and are a staple of the South - pecans are usually what is used in Ambrosia. One can play with Ambrosia up to a point. If in doubt about the cinnamon and nutmeg, check other Ambrosia recipes. I'm 63 years old and a Southerner and have never heard of anyone adding spices to Ambrosia. This recipe just didn't taste right, in my opinion the spices ruined the taste, one could not call this true Ambrosia . Allrecipes has other Ambrosia recipes you might want to look at.

This was great! I've never made ambrosia before, but a family friend was having a luau and requested that everyone bring a 'tropical' type dish. With pineapple and coconut this fit the bill, and it was a huge hit! I used tropical fruit salad to add to the Hawaiian theme, and it was a hit. My father was devastated that my mom and I came home without leftovers. Thank you, Kimberley, this will be going into my regular rotation!!!

Per other reviews, I used 1/2 the stated amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, and coconut, and I'm really glad I did.  The spices make this different than other similar desserts -- not spectactular, but something new.  This is a pretty neat mix of flavors, and a good way to use up bits and pieces of leftover canned fruit!

Great Recipe, especially for a non-cook like myself!  Everyone Loved it!!!  Was asked to make this again for the 4th of July!  My only note to this recipe is to double the amount of cool whip or cut the coconut in half.

Many Thanks to Kimberley for sharing this recipe!

Always find it invaluable to read the comments BEFORE the preparation begins. 
This is a nice recipe.  Decided to try this keeping comments in mind with a few tweaks. Made this for 25 people. Left out the spices. Added a few big spoonfuls of sour cream.  Used the extra creamy CoolWhip but will use Mfg. Whipping cream next time, (no preservatives.) Added a dry pkg of Pistacio Pudding mix as well (light green color), cut coconut in half (a must), always use sugar free fruit in it's own juice instead of sugar water. Soaked for two or three minutes the multi-colored marshmallows in the fruit juice (from cans) prior to adding to the bowl. Speeds the softening of the marshmallows. Throw juice away. Chopped and toasted walnuts to add, just prior to serving. For presentation, toasted a bit of coconut to place in the center of serving dish and topped with a maraschino cherry in the center.  Refreshing, tasty, well received. Enjoy!

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve and I made a few alterations to it considering a few other reviews I read.  I left out the spices, added 2 fresh bananas, 2 fresh crunchy apples, plate of fresh grapes and 4 oz. of sour cream on top of the 8 oz. cool whip which was extra creamy, by the way.  While I was doing all of this I let the marshmallows soak in the drained juices from the canned fruits so they would soften quicker (got this tip from a reviewer).  I mixed everything together and refridgerated for about an hour.  This dish was gone by the end of the night.  Great recipe!

I also ended up making punch and added all the juices (including the maraschino juice) into the punch, it was delightful.  1 2 liter Cherry 7-up, half gallon of Hawaiian punch, the fruit juices and sherbet!

Happy Holidays!

I only gave this 4 out of 5 because I used this recipe as a starting point.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the coconut, cinnamon and nutmeg (great advice!).  Here's what I did different - and it's the best Ambrosia Fruit Salad I've ever had!  I left out the canned fruit coctail and instead added fuji apple, black grapes, bananas and extra walnuts.  SO wonderful this way.  I like the crisp, cool texture the apple and grapes add.  It would be pretty mushy without them.

This recipe was alright. I think i would have liked it better if there was no nutmeg but maybe thats just personal preference. I wasn't a big fan of this salad the day it was made (also the day i served it, although it did have a couple hours in the fridge) but it was way better the day after and days to come. If your thinking of making this, try making it a day or two in advance. it also tends to have more flavour this way.

As per the other reviews I altered the recipe some. I kept the topping to 8 oz., cut the coconut to 1 3/4 cup, and the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. Next time I will cut the coconut more. My husband liked it but thought it was a bit "granola-like"! All in all, very quick and easy and will make again!

Use a 16oz container of cool whip and cut out the spices or half them. The spices overpowered the fruit.

I loved this recipe. I  changed it a little bit by using about 1/2 cup sour cream along with the whipped topping. Instead of using the fruit cocktail I used canned peaches and added some apples and grapes. It turned out great after chilling overnight. I kept the walnuts separate and added them just before eating and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. Delicious. :)

Thanks Kimberly. I had never made Ambrosia before but wanted to try it for Thanksgiving. It was a hit! I did, however, but back on the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg called for. Delicious.

This was a very simple and tasty receipe.  I used multi-colored miniture marshmallows which made it very festive!  I left out the walnuts since some of my guest are allergic and it was still delicious!  They especially loved the maraschino cherries so don't skimp!

I think the nutmeg and the cinnamon are a must. They give it that nice pumpkin pie flavor. I tried it with just a half teaspoon of each, and I ended up adding more.

I tried this recipe as written, but was a little disappointed. My aunt used to make ambrosia every year for Christmas, and everyone loved it! So, when I found this recipe, I was really excited to make it...slight let down :( This recipe is similar to my aunt's version, except there is no fruit cocktail, cinnamon, or nutmeg, and instead of cool whip, sour cream is used...and that is the "ULTIMATE AMBROSIA" recipe. In fact, I guess I should post it, so everyone can enjoy this awesome recipe!

I doubled the amount of fruit, added bananas, and added 8oz of sour cream. I also didn't use any nutmeg or cinnamon-don't like either.  Wow, it was sooooo good! Everybody was asking for my recipe.

I liked this recipe very much.  I used only fruit cocktail, marshmallows, and cool whip, since that was what I had in the house.  I also added chopped walnuts for additional texture.  I didn't used cinnamon or nutmeg, since I wasn't sure I wanted that flavoring in this fruit salad.

Great recipe, omitted the coconut though - was too much.  Go a bit easier on the nutmeg too.  But otherwise very easy and very tasty!  Thank you for a great recipe that I will make again and again!

Loved this recipe! Family did too. The only thing I would do different is use a little less coconut and add cinnamon on top of individual serving. Tastes best the day its made, not as good the day after

The reviewer "Beautiful Tragedy" had the best revision of this recipe. My modifications were, instead of can fruit cocktail I used Del Monte Fruit Salad so the fruit would be  fresh like, along with an apple, banana, and fresh blueberries.  I also used sour cream.  With the spices I just sprinkle a little of both on top at the end to give it a pretty appearance which turned out to be just right.  I love coconut but my guy doesn't so I omitted that.  I made this at a pontoon party and it was gone in seconds.  Everyone wanted to know who made that dish.  I must say it is delicious...

I really like this salad combination using the cinnamon and nutmeg spices instead of jello flavoring.  I think it gives it a little more sophistication. Super easy to make and very yummy.  This will be a keeper in my family. Made it for Memorial Day dinner with hot dogs etc.

I made this on Thanksgiving as an alternative to the classic fruit salad, and it was well received. I was a little skeptical about the spices, but after trying this before and after spices, I think the cinnamon and nutmeg are essential. General consensus was that the dish was good, but that it might do well to cut down on the coconut. A suggestion I'll take when I make it again for Christmas!

This was definitely a hit at Thanksgiving this year!  I doubled the recipe to feed 12, but that wasn't necessary -- it makes a lot of ambrosia.  I did cut the spices in half, as others suggested, and cut down on the coconut, too.  The spices were just right -- any more and it would have been overpowering.  I thought the amout of cool whip was just fine as called for.

I love this recipe! I agree with the others about reducing the coconut. And, I used chopped pecans (I am from Georgia after all) instead of the walnuts. Everything else remained the same. I get requests for this all the time.

This was wonderful. I noticed a lot of the reviews thought the nutmeg and cinnamon was a little much but it just depends on your taste. If you are making it for the first time, I would suggest 1/2 tsp. of each and see how you like it. I used the full amount and no one had a problem with it. Experiment.

We had a family reunion where we had to bring potluck and I wanted to bring something geared more towards the kids since most things are for adults (potato salad, etc.); but even the adults said they liked this one.  I modified it slightly, using only 1 1/4 cup coconut, more whipped cream and I placed the cherries on top for garnish.

Everyone loved this from kids to Grandpa and it was SO EASY!  I have one kid who hates coconut & one who hates nuts and it was very easy to set aside portions before adding those items.  Also, I used the Fat Free Topping for a lighter dish.

I loved it I did change a few things though. I made this fruit ambrosia and added one can of m. oranges and the nuts and all of the coconut and 2 bananas and 10 oz of the cherries but I  put 8 oz of sour cream and 8 oz of cool whip and added 1/3  a package of dry cherry Jello to this it tasted awesome give it a try with any flavor of dry Jello.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone thought it was delicious. I agreed with the readers and cut back on the spices. I only added a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon and used a tub and a half of cool whip. The spices were very subtle and gave it a different kind of flavor but it was very, very good.

I confess I tweaked it some, dropped the spices. Again it was one of those recipes that people called me and begged me for. Good stuff!

I looked at the other reviews before making this recipe. I left out the spices, used a little less coconut, and added about  cup of sour cream. This was sooo good. Next time however, I will not use canned fruit cocktail, but substitute a can of peaches and a can of pears diced up as even the name-brand fruit cocktail on the market today is not at all like the stuff we used to get when I was a kid; it's mostly juice now with a some measly diced fruit. I will absolutely make this again!

DON'T use the spices! They colored the salad to a light rusty brown plus all we could taste were the spices instead of all the other great ingredients.

I substituted a 15 oz can of tropical fruit salad for the regular (mushy) fruit salad AND the pineapple chunks (the tropical variety already has pineapple chunks.  I also used 2C of Gingerbread Mallows (seasonal, unforutnately) + 1C regular mini-marshmallows, so it wouldn't be so sweet.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was such a hit for Christmas dinner, I was asked to make it again for New Year's dinner!  Good thing I still have some of those Gingerbread mallows left! ;o)

I made this for the first time on Christmas Day 2010.  Very disappointed.  Tasted horrible.  I should have left out the nutmeg and cinnamon and maybe it would have been better.

Simply delicious! I did change a few things. I just put 1 cup of coconut flakes, added another 1/2 cup walnuts, added frozen blueberries, and just used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I'll be making this one again!

Good recipe that you can add or subtract what you like and it always turns out well. I like to add more mandarin oranges and some sour cream to counteract the sweetness a bit. Always a hit with the kids :) Ok, and with Grandma too!

Excellent recipe, so easy!  I used the Creamy Cool Whip like other reviewers and also left out the spices.  I made 1 1/2 batch for a luncheon and it was almost gone when I cleaned up!  I will definitely make again!

This recipe always has the family fighting over any leftovers in the bowl.  I usually have additional do-dahs in this recipe; so to stretch out the dressing I add about 1/2c. reduced fat mayonnaise.  I then chop up 1 Granny Smith apple, slice 1 banana, cut back on the coconut, use BLACK chopped walnuts & colored mini marshmellows.  For more of a Calypso-style salad, you can use papaya, guava, mango, & poppyseed.  For those who don't like the nutmeg, try using some allspice instead (pumpkin spice).

Too many flavors in this makes it less satsifying for a sweet tooth fix and hard to use to feed a group of people.

This is an easy, flexible and delicious salad.  I sent it to my sister who lives out-of-town, who did not get the "cooking" gene. She made it and found it delicious - she is serving to her guests for a dinner party.  For all of the naysayers that are criticizing the use of certain ingredients, I say relax.  One of the joys of cooking is adapting and adjusting a recipe to your personal tastes and the personal tastes of your family.  Really good cooks know how to do that!

Salad was delish, but we used half the spices as was suggested in the comments and thought it was still a bit too strong. Will make again, but adjust the spices more!

I made this Ambrosia Fruit Salad.My family
and I liked it.I used a can of fruit cocktail.I didn't 
have any Maraschino Cherries.I added one Banana and some Blueberries.I also added the Cinamon and Nutmeg.The only thing I did different was to add some sugar and
vanilla flavoring which gave it a really good taste.
Next time I will use tropical Yogurt instead of
the Sour Cream.I will be making this dish again

Don't add the cinnamon and nutmeg, its way to nutty. Try it on a small portion in a bowl before you put it on the whole salad. Upside is..its super fast to make.

I love Ambrosia salad, however, when I make this recipe, I leave out the spices and use less coconut.  I always use Extra Creamy whipped topping too.  It is always a hit wherever I take it.

I halved the spices and it was still way too much.  I recommend putting only a quarter of the nutmeg and cinnamon.

I made the recipe with all the spices and it was "Superb!". I used the tropical fruit cocktail as it's hot & humid out, and this is the perfect desert for a day like this. I will be making this one a lot! Thanks for a great change to blander ambrosias.

Great salad!  Here are my suggestions-forget the seasonings, the fruit does fine on its own, use EXTRA CREAMY whip topping, use a little of the pineapple or cherry juice to add so it isnt on the dry side.

This was excellent--I'm not a big fan of coconut, so I followed the advice of others and cut the amount in half.  Also cut the spices in half.  Came out perfectly with a wonderful flavor and texture.  Made for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit!

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed was to add a couple of large bananas sliced up.  I also didn't thaw my Cool Whip before hand and just let it sit out for about 20 minutes... it came out perfect!  Nice and chilled... not runny.  My family who likes fruit salad raved about it.

Fantastic and EASY. I made this for 14 gals in our Club. Everyone loved it. Used only 1 cup of coconut, 2 cans fruit cocktail, 1 can pineapple chunks, 1 can mandarin oranges  and 1 jar of cherries. Added red seedless grapes, 2 tubs Cool Whip and walnuts. Thanks for this great recipe; I'll be making this again.

This was the recipe I remember from my childhood!  As I have a diabetic in the house, I made a few changes.  I used a combination of lite whipped topping and fat-free sour cream with the no sugar canned fruit.  I tried it with a touch of the pumpkin spice and it was excellent.  Thank so much!

The ambrosia was good, but the cinnamon and nutmeg were too much.  They over-powered the whole salad.  Next time, I'll just omit those.

I think there are far more spices than needed, and the recipe is also vastly improved by whipping some heavy cream instead of using pre-made whipped topping.

I was not a fan of this recipe.  WAY too much coconut, and the cinnamon gave it a dingy look.  It did taste okay.  Next time I will cut the coconut down, to probably 1/2 cup, skip the cinnamon and nutmeg, and add a little more whipped topping.  I'm hoping adding some more whipped topping will save this.  Basically by the time the adjustments are made to make this good, it will be a whole different recipe. :(

I was looking for a fruit salad to bring to our first visit to the lake in 2012. This recipe was great but I don't think anyone really enjoyed the "ambrosia/coconut." I loved it but I think I'll continue to look for a more traditional fruit salad.

This was pretty good.  I made it for a birthday party and it wasn't a hit unfortunately.  I did use half the seasonings per the many reviews that suggested that. I also used a little less coconut & marshmellows.

This is a good ambrosia salad.  I used less coconut and less marshmallows.  The maraschino cherries are a must for flavor and bright color.  There are cherries in the fruit cocktail, but are not of good quality.  I sprinkled a slight amount of cinnamon on top for garnish.  I'll make again, thanks.

This ambrosia almost brought me to tears.  My mom passed away a few years ago, and this salad reminded me of her holiday salad (minus the coconut).  It was easy, flavorful, and will be made for many holiday's to come (minus coconut and spice)

This was sooo good.  Unlike a lot of the other people, I used all the ingredients listed in the recipe.  However, I sampled it before and after adding the nutmeg and cinnamon, and I think I may leave those out next time. 

Awesome recipe!  My fiance loved it when I made it for lunch.

This was very good, however I would suggest skipping the spices. The nutmeg and cinnamon didn't go over very well. I do plan to make it again, just without the spices.

One star with the spices; think about it, 1 tsp. each nutmeg & cinnamon -- with this fruit combination?  Four star as a basis for a basic ambrosia, if you leave out the spices.  Of course, I never make mine with Cool Whip, only real whipped cream.  No one needs all those chemicals in a salad.

Not bad, but I prefer to exclude the nuts, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Also, I put a little bit less of cool whip and used fat free. In addition I added nata de coco (its like a coconut sqaures thats kind of like jel) and peaches.

I only used 1/3 of the coconut called for.  I doubled the recipe and used  can of fat free sweetened condensed milk.  Also, did not use nutmeg...  Very good!  Very sweet!

This fruit salad was incredibly good. I made it for Christmas morning breakfast (along with the Country Breakfast Casserole) and everyone wanted the recipe. As I was making it, I didn't think there would be enough "dressing". I thought that I would have to add more whipped topping, but it ended up being the perfect amount. Other than cutting the coconut to 1.5 cups, I followed the recipe exactly and was glad that I did. Thanks for the great recipe!

I can't really rate this recipe as it was written as I made changes as suggested by others.  I omit cinnamon and nutmeg and reduced coconut by half (entire amount would have definitely been too much for me).  Also used half amount of CoolWhip and added 8oz sour cream.  Final result was very good.

Turned out pretty good. I doubled the whipped cream and didn't bother with the nutmeg or cinnamon. It was a bit on the dry side, but I didn't care, and no one else seemed to either.

The Ambrosia salad was great.  Next time I won't use as much coconut as it says.  Lots of cherries makes it taste very good.  Great, quick, yummy!

Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was absolutely wonderful, I couldn't stay away from it!  The amount of nutmeg was a little strong for my personal taste, but I blended in a little extra whipped topping and that did the trick.

My grandmother always made this recipie for christmas adding a little green food coloring to the coconut and we still continue the tradition.  The only difference about your recipie and my grandmothers was she never put the nutmeg in it.  But from now on I will.  It gives it a nice taste.

I have been buying the pre-made at the deli.  Decided to make it myself.  I mix equal parts of this salad with a little container of Oikos Blueberry Greek yogurt and a handful of fresh blueberries.  It is delish!  Healthier than my Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Thank you for posting!

I made this recipe, couldn't find maraschino cherries at my local market, but added chunks from two kiwis.  I also use pecans since I am allergic to walnuts.  Awesome.  My church members are asking for more! thank for posting this one!

Great, easy recipe!  I used only 1 cup of coconut, and just shook in a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I think the spices made the difference, although I can see why too much would be overpowering.  Thanks for the recipe that my kids love!

I was looking for something simple yet yummy, and I found it!  I opted to forgo the cinnamon, nutmeg, fruit cocktail, cherries, and walnuts.  Instead I added canned crushed pineapple, and grapes.  The second batch I tried I added some of the juice from the pineapple (as suggested by my boyfriend) and it made this recipe twice as good!

COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE!!!! I followed the previous suggestions with halving the whipped topping and adding the sour cream. I also halved the coconut and the marshmallows and doubled the amount of walnuts. SO GOOD!!! :-)

Super easy and not just for the holidays! I made this to take to a potluck after church in "June" and it was a big hit -- there was only 1/2 c. leftover. Next time I may omit the coconut because I find that a lot of people do not care for it. Thanks for posting.

Super easy to make, and a hit at our 4th of July cookout.  I eased up on the spices, and a little on the coconut and cherries too.  Wonderful!

Sooo good! I've always liked stuff like this. But I did it quite a bit differently than the recipe, hence the 4 stars. I only put in 1 cup of shredded coconut, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg, and I didn't notice until after I'd already bought the cans of fruit that the recipe only called for 8/11-ounce cans. So since I love fruit, I ended up putting in a 20-ounce can of pineapple and 15-ounce cans of mandarin oranges and fruit cocktail. It turned out perfect that way! I even forgot to put the marshmallows and walnuts in before I started eating it, and it was still delicious without them. Will definitely be making this again and experimenting with fresh berries. Mmm!

I have never made this before.  But when your family tells you to bring a fruit for brunch I immediately thought of Ambrosia.  I read most of the reviews and made it with the variations suggested.  It was a big hit.  The family loved it.  My nephew actually wanted the leftovers.  What a compliment.

I did not care for the cinnamon and nutmeg addition to this recipe.  I halved it as suggested by other reviewers, but I just don't think these flavors mingled well together.

I've always loved the first ambrosia recipe I ever made. It calls for sour cream.  Adding about a cup to this recipe will give it a nice flavor.

If you do not like the taste of fruit then use this recipe.  All you can taste is the nutmeg.  I made this Christmas morning so could not get to a store to make something else for salad.  It was evident by my family and guest salad plates that they did not like this either.  Will never make again.

This recipe couldn't have been easier to make.  Very simple yet extremely deliscious!  I didn't have nutmeg, so I left it out and it still tasted great!  I'll make it again next time I need to bring something to a dinner/get together!

This was one of the best fruit salads I have ever had.  I made it for a potluck at my work and they loved it.  When I made for a family Thanksgiving, I replaced the cherries with sliced strawberries, since my mother is allergic to the red dye used in maraschino cherries.  It was just as good with the strawberries, and I used glazed walnuts to try something a little different.

My family did not care for this at all. It may be that we just don't like "Ambrosia" salads. I was turned off by the texture of the coconut in it. And, I particularly disliked the nutmeg and cinnamon flavor. Sorry!

I also used half the coconut and half the whipped cream.  I used the new "creamy" Cool Whip.  My family absolutely loved it and so did I.  Had a tiny bit left over and used it as topping on Dreyer's Mango ice cream - WOW!

Can't beat this for simplicity! I decided to add this dish to my Christmas dinner at the last minute and didn't have all the exact ingredients on hand, so I made the following alterations: no fruit cocktail, no maraschino cherries, no nutmeg. I skipped the cinnamon(thought it might clash with my "extras"). I used a 20 oz can of pineapple (considerably more than the recipe called for), TWO 11 oz tins of mandarin oranges, and then tossed in three pints of fresh blackberries, 4 small sliced bananas from my backyard and two lilikoi (passionfruit) also from my yard. I cut the coconut way back to maybe 1/2-3/4 cup. The blackberries turned the salad a bit purple, which looked very festive actually, and the combination was divine! We're going to try this without the coconut and the mini marshmallows next time for a fruit salad that isn't quite as sweet, though we won't call it "ambrosia". The recipe was super easy and everyone loved it.

Made this salad with my cooking class and they LOVED it. Okay, so it doesn't look that great but the taste is heavenly to say the least. We made one gallon of this salad and also added a lot of different fruit: 1 cup strawberrie, 2 mardarin oranges, 1 cup red and green grapes and kiwi fruit. Just add more topping to the mix and stir!

I leave out walnuts and use the fruit cocktail with the extra cherries instead of maraschino.  Proportions seem to be off in this recipe - I probably use about half the whipped cream and only a dash of cinnamon.  I usually throw in a splash of red food coloring to make this dish a little more fun.  None of my friends seem to like it as much as I do though.

It was very good and easy to make.  I made it for a picnic and everyone really like it, but go easy on the nutmeg.

Very very sweet. Needs more fruit for the ratio of marshmallows and coconut. I will add cuties, grapes and fresh pineapple - possibly Bananas next time. Either try that or another can of fruit cocktail. It definitely needs more fruit. Delicious it’s a keeper

This is yummy. I used only half of the cinnamon, nutmeg and coconut. Used half whip and added cream cheese. Froze it and took it out a half hour before. I also added a little pistachio pudding mix.

This was good, but I had to make way too many changes to the recipe to get it to my liking, so I gave 3 stars. I added some heavy whipping cream, a tbsp of sugar, halved the spices, and reduced the coconut to 1 3/4 cups. Next time I may leave out the spices altogether.

I made this salad, although I used crushed pineapple instead of chunk,  added extra whipped topping, and omitted the spices.  I also added one chopped apple.  It is really good.  I cut the marachinos cherris in half.

If I were to make this gain, I would NOT add the cinamon and nutmeg.  Especially the nutmeg.  It changed the whole taste of what this is suppose to taste like.  Had to re-do it without adding the spices.  Doesn't go with this dessert.

Make this every Christmas and it is yummy! My mom and dad made this all the time. Wouldn't be Christmas without it! I did leave out the spices though. I have never add them and I am from the south and have never add spices to it. Better without the spices

I also have revised this recipe a bit. I totally omit the cinnamon and nutmeg. I do use jello, usually 2 different colors, ie..red and green for Christmas, etc... Everyone loves the added jello in it. I use small marshmallow, pinapple, fruit cocktail, and use mandarin oranges for decoration on top along with cherries.

I omitted the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also use half the cool whip and add a small 8 oz sour cream it cuts the sweet. If I double the recipe I use the whole tub of cool  whip. Make it the night before and it's even better. Also frozen coconut for best results.

Marshmellows are very light and makes it fluffy with the whip cream. I used 8oz of real whip cream.  I used cinnamon, and only a tbsp. Did not feel any sugar rush.

I did this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and we had family that was in from out of state. I recieved and email from my daughter-in-law asking me for the recipe, she wants to take to work tomorrow for a carry in they are having. The things that I did a little different was that I did not use any of the spices, I added one box of instand vanilla pudding, and used crushed pineapple. I never used the nuts either for fear of allergies.It was a big success and will be at our table for most special occasions now probably by special request....

I agree on the spices and I only added 1/4tsp of each, omitted the cocktail fruit (used it only to decorate the top for presentation)  cut the coconut and marshmallows to half the amount and added a fresh green apple and pear and covered fresh fruit with a little lemon juice to prevent browning prior to added to mixture.

Loved this recipe. This is perfect for those who are lactose intolerant. I toasted the coconut flakes and put toasted nut topping and the coconut on top of one side for those who don't or can't have either. Everyone appreciated that I was thoughtful of different diet restrictions.

Good basic recipe. I like making my own whipped cream, 1 tblspoon vanilla and 1/2-2/3 cup powdered sugar to 9 ounces of cream.
I used half the cinnamon and none of the nutmeg. Toasted shopped walnuts already add to the rustic flavor.  Fresh very ripe pineapple and if I can, home made marshmallows, lemon or lime flavored.  Adding more cherries adds to the presentation, but not so much to the flavor.

Made this for 35 people and it was great.  Did mix Cool Whip with sour cream, left out spices, fruit cocktail and half the coconut but added fresh strawberries and grapes.  Next time will make just like recipe to see difference and will adjust from there if I want to.  Thanks for recipe cause I'd never made it before and was very afraid.  Ladies that never give out compliments raved about the salad and can't wait for me to make it again.  Woohoo!

I am not sure if it is personal taste but we thought there was just too much coconut in this.  1-1/2 cups would be plenty for us.  We will also omit the spices next time.

I loved this recipe. I added a fuji apple, orange, and a small grapefruit. I didn't put any nutmeg an I put 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I omitted the fruit cocktail because I don't like the mushiness - and fresh fruit tastes so much better. Overall, it was amazing - my family devoured it!

This is a very easy recipe. The only thing I changed was the spices. I know that Nutmeg can often be very strong so I just used a pinch...spiced it to taste. The family really enjoyed it!! Thanks!!

I made this fruit salad using 16 oz whipped topping instead of 8 oz and added the 1 tsp of spices to the whipped topping.  I think that this was a perfect blend of the spices and whipped topping.  Loved the spice touch.
