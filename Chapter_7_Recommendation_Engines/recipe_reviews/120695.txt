I've been making this recipe for years.  I love it!  It's the only meat loaf my husband will eat.  We make extra sauce to top our mashed potatoes.

Best meatloaf I've ever made. (I just realized I forgot the breadcrumbs. Oops!) I doubled up on the onion soup mix, and added a little garlic powder. I cooked it in the oven at 350 for about 45 mins. Good stuff. Thanks, Deb!

This is just an AMAZING recipe!  It is so delish!  I have served this many times for company, and i have had to send the recipe home each and every time.  It's such a different take on meat loaf, yet so unbelievably good.  I would make this every single week if i could!  YUMMY!  Also, i never buy the onion soup mix, so i never add it.  It doesn't take away from the flavor by ommiting it.  Enjoy!

Love this meat loaf!  My family did as well.  So moist and tangy. I did cook in oven for 50 minutes instead of microwave.    Will make again and again. Thanks:)

Excellent. I followed the recipe as is - only doubling it for a bigger loaf and serving the sauce on the side instead of pouring over the top. We also drizzled the sauce over our mashed potatoes - and that was fantastic! A very moist loaf that made great sandwiches the next day. Cooking it in the microwave was really a time saver. It was appreciated, although I think I prefer oven-baked so you can get that crustiness on the sides. Very good though, thank you!

This one is a keeper...the only thing that I changed was  that I added monterrey cheese. The first meat loaf that I've made in microwave.  Surprisingly delicious. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was Great and fast.  I didn't have all the items so I substituted.  1/2 cup diced onions for soup mix, 1/2 cup of dressing mix for bread crumbs and spicy mustard for regular.  I had everything for the Sweet and Sour sauce.  I have been wanting Meat Loaf, but didn't want to heat up the kitchen with the oven.  This did the trick, and the Sweet and Sour sauce was supper.

I am NOT a vegetarian but I'm just not familiar with cooking meat. This is so easy and so good. My husband says I'm well on my way.  Super quick in the microwave. I love the kick the vinegar adds.

This was delicious.  I will find it hard to wait 45 minutes to bake a meatloaf when this turned out so well.  My husband said this was the best meatloaf I have ever made---and he was right!!  It did not take me quite as long to microwave mine--5 1/2 minutes, I flipped the whole loaf over and then 3 1/2 min.  put the ketchup on (just used ketchup and br. sugar) for another minute. AWESOME

My husband has always been a fan of meatloaf but he REALLY loves this one. Whenever he knows we're having meatloaf he asks if itis the one I made last time (meaning this one). I use seasoned bread crumbs and sometimes add a 2nd egg.

Loved this! I forgot to add the mustard, but it was still great! My kids and hubby gobbled it up. Even my 2yo started chanting "More meatloaf! More meatloaf!" Great recipe, especially on top of a slice of bread.

great sauce. I used 3 tablespoons of sugar for the sauce instead of a 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons probably would have been perfect too. 
the meatloaf wasn't terrible either. Not a shining star or anything, with or without the sauce, it's good.
baked at 350 for about an hour, came out well enough.

I thought the ingredients sounded good and I made just like the recipe called for but instead of the microwave, I baked in the oven at 350 for an hour.  It was ok but nothing special. I think using a little less sugar would help a little.

Cut down slightly on the sugar as per other reviews, but otherwise followed exactly.  Very quick and tasty.  Will probably make again, but in the oven.
