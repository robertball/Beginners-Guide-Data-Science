Wow! Where has this little recipe been all my life? It's amazing how two simple ingredients that you have around the kitchen can come together for something that tastes so good. You definitely have to use REAL butter, (not margarine) that's softened and you'll get great results. I used this on bagels, but can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff and add-ins like orange zest.... Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummmmmm - I'm not a honey fan, but this is great on homemade dinner rolls!  Dinner guests always RAVE about this butter (little do they know how simple it is to make).  For easier mixing, be sure your butter (definitely not margarine) and honey are room temp.  Also, I like to use a bit of salted butter because it really does enhance the honey/butter flavor - I suggest half salted and half unsalted.  I tried just adding salt once, but it doesn't really disolve well, so go with the presalted butter.

Try it on toast.  It is to die for.  Equal parts honey and butter is exactly right.  I grew up eating this.  We lived on a ranch.  A bee-keeper kept bees on our land and paid us in honey (80 pounds a year) so we used honey in everything...but this was our favorite.

This stuff tastes amazing.  I only used 1/3 instead of 1/2 cup of honey.  It still tasted great.  I used them on the popovers (from this site).  Thanks so much for posting.

This is a good proportion in my opinion.  Although it's really, really sweet.  I think if you cut back the honey to 1/3 cup it would still be good.  But I'll stick with the 1/2 cup because I like it extra sweet.

Good with corn bread muffins, tho' a little sweeter than I would have preferred.  I only made a small portion for the two of us so I just mixed it by hand, but I'll bet this would whip up nice and fluffy using the original 8-serving recipe and a stand or electric hand mixer.

Very good butter. I just made some for Easter dinner tomorrow and I can't wait to eat it with the yeast rolls I'm making. I added some cinnamon to it to give a taste like the butter at Texas Roadhouse (we looooove their butter). I used unsalted butter because it's what I had on hand and I added the honey to suit my own taste.

We used to have honey butter with our honey bran muffins. I have learned how to make it and it's very fluffy when you have the right equipment to make it. I make it in my K-Aid stand mixer, starting out with the paddle beater and switching over to the whip beater to whip more air into it. I also use real butter and high quality raw honey. I also make a large batch and freeze extra in meal-sized portions (whips better when you have more in the mixing bowl). It's so yummy on hot muffins for breakfast!

Excellent!  I served this on a crusty black russian rye bread with a hungarian goulash.  The sweetness tied together the meal perfectly! Highly recommend.

So simple, but soo good. I've heard/seen suggestions for adding vanilla extract and or cinnamon. Haven't tried either, but I am sure they would both be good. Just remember to start with a little and build your way up until you've added enough! I made this butter and it was gone soo quickly. It was probably gone faster than was healthy, actually...

Way too much butter. Try using butter and honey in equal proportions to create much sweater breakfast spread.

Sioux Bee used to make honey spread in a tub when I was a kid in the '40s and '50s which I loved. They discontinued it and I have searched for it ever since. With a little tweaking and whipping this sounds just like it. Great on biscuits or croissants!! I have a huge bottle of honey bought on the mark down table (honey is the only food that NEVER spoils so buy it at a mark down if you ever see it).  I'll beat it until I get the proper consistency and store it in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe.

This brings back so many warm childhood memories. My mom and grandma used to make it all the time, but sadly I had forgotten about it until now, so my kids didn't grow up eating it at our house. Glad I stumbled on to this recipe. It's as good as I remembered. I'll try to start using this more often and for my grown kids and grandkids. It's never too late to revive tradition. Thanks so much!

There are a few variations of honey butter on this website, but I chose yours because it was a simple one to remember with 1/2 cup of each ingredient. My two daughters and me all decided that the honey taste was a tad overpowering, so I simply softened and added 2 more tablespoons of butter. Voila! It was perfect for us. The other recipes on this site seemed to try and complicate what should be a very simple recipe. This recipe is simply equal parts of the two ingredients depending on how much you want to make, then minor tweaking to adjust for individual tastes. Thank you for posting this.

I found the half and half a bit sweet. I used 3/4 butter to 1/2 c honey, then added a half tsp ground ginger because my husband likes it that way.

This is so good on honey wheat English muffins and on cinnamon bread.  After trying this you won't want to use plain butter ever again.

This is a WONDERFUL choice from serving standard butter for a meal or party.  I decided to make it for a bridal shower I hosted and everyone raved about how delicous it was - even those who were on a diet and didn't even want butter, got tempted by everyone elses comments that they too started eating it.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is a Keeper!

Following the exact portions here the real test is trying different honeys.  I made one with:  orange blossom, acacia, sunflower, chestnut and one with a heavy mountain "spring honey" (clear but thick and full of rich nutty flavour).  The conclusion is that it is an excellent ratio of butter to honey.  Each, using these portions listed, tasted well balanced and not too overpowered by either honey or butter no matter how delicate or strong the honey.  Creamy and delicious.  Highly recommended.

I can't wait to try this recipe with my homemade Oatmeal-Molassas Dinner Rolls.  ( food52.com).  The only change I make to the dinner roll recipe is I use 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of white and also always use bread flour for the white. (Also, do not put the extra oatmeal on top of rolls as they tend to fall off).  A very easy dinner roll and the dough is great.  This honey butter will go "super" with these rolls.

Simple recipe for honey butter, but the honey to butter ratio was off for me.  I should have listened to other reviewers and reduced the amount of honey from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup.  With that alteration, I think it will be perfect.   Good on hot cornbread muffins.

I had just made beef stew and needed something to go with it so I decided to make cornbread from my cornmeal box(recipe on box) 

I perused your website and found three recipes and decided upon this one.

Simple ingredients, quick preparation and very delicious. All five of us enjoyed it and it was a great addition the  beef stew and cornbread meal.

Anything you can do with butter you can pretty much do with honey or maple butter! The proportions in this recipe are perfect. However the main ingredient for the best outcome is time and patience!! With both ingredients at room temp, sit down, relax and prepared to beat. After the first five minutes or so, you'll notice small bits of butter "floating "in the liquid syrup/honey. What will seem to be 3 days later, the 2 will begin to catch (just like the transition you see when making whipped cream.) The time is really not three days, just 17 hours,33 min and 12 sec! {;-). Of course by then, you're half out of your mind with the scent of maple/honey. Don't worry, your salivary glands will get a good workout. Shortly after the the first signs of it catching,it will have caught. NOW taste it!! Remember, you just put in a lot of time making sweeeet stuff! So, rather than messing around with the ingredients, use just a dab, not a slather!! 
Now,what to put it on - popovers, peas, carrots, any winter squash and most root veggies. Then there are snow peas, green beans, sweet potatoes (of course) and most every bread product known to man. If you try to behave yourself re:sugar/carb consumption, I suggest you limit yourself to undertaking this adventure to twice or thrice in a decade.
{{;-))  remember, start with just a dab and go from there.  Good luck, Tish

I have been buying this for years & my spouse nudged me to make it myself.  Why did I wait for so long?  I mixed it in my small mixer bowl & it came out so creamy.  It is sooooo good!  Will definitely make it from now on.

This is just lovely as an accompaniment to 'Sweet Cornbread Cake' from AR. The only thing I'd add next time out of personal preference is a little salt or use semi-salted butter to balance out the sweetness.

Yummy and easy! Mine turned out kind of gritty but I used margarine instead of real butter, and mixed by hand since I'm still in the dark ages and don't have an electric mixer or beater. I'm sure once I adapt to new technology this will turn out perfect and creamy! It went perfectly with biscuits and ribs for dinner!

I couldn’t bring myself to use the entire amount of honey called for in the recipe.  I used just under the 1/2c and it turned out amazing.  I just smothered the tops of some homemade rolls with it.  Divine.

I had this in a restaurant once, and fell in love. Decided I could make it at home with homemade bread and found this recipe. It is delicious, thanks for posting!

Had honey butter in a restaurant and fell in love. This came out perfectly ....just like the restaurant. Now, if I could only figure out how to make the rolls the honey butter came on ....sigh.

Yum! I made mine in a mixer and it turned lit great! Add some cinnamon sugar for even better taste. Tastes great on sweet potatoes

Wonderful!!! I like to add a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, or orange zest to mine. And I prefer to start with salted butter - I think it enhances the flavor.

Next time I will use less honey.  I liked it, but it was a bit too sweet.

Here's an update to my prior review (I can't figure out how to add it to the first review). I figured out that I have to use an electric mixer to get the perfectly smooth, creamy, and slightly fluffy texture. No hand mixing. Now it is complete perfection and everyone loves it.

This is great! Now I don't have to buy that tiny tub of Honey Butter for almost $4. I make as much as I want for pennies!
