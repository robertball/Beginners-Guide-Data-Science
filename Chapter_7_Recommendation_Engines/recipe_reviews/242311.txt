I have seen recipes from Epicurious, NY Times, Food Network, and others.  This is the most impressive and delicious recipe for Tonnato Sauce/ Dip. Applause for Chef John. His recipe nails it!

This is great over cold poached chicken or turkey breast!  Also great as a dip for pita chips.  Love it!

A true classic in Italy. It's great for picnics or special lunches/brunches prepared beforehand and kept cold for up to 2 days in the fridge. Serve cold! The veal cut is usually "magatello" or the top round cut. Top with extra capers! Yum, yum! Thank you for sharing this authentic recipe!
