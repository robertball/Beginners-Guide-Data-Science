Five stars for the memories! MANY years ago when I was a little girl, my mom and dad would take us kids to the Milwaukee airport just to watch the planes take off and land. As a special treat we'd stop in the airport lounge. Mom and Dad would have their cocktails and we kids would have the "Kiddie Cocktail." Not only did we think we were "all that" because they served it in a big people's glass, but it tasted good too! This Shirley Temple is the "Kiddie Cocktail" I remember from my childhood. Thanks for the memories.

This served as a good base, but to make it even better add orange juice--it really intensifies the flavour and gives it a little more bite.

The best kid-friendly cocktail there is! I tend to use a combination of grenadine syrup and the liquid from the maraschino cherries. This is even better if you use a blackcurrant syrup that is slightly thicker than the grenadine. I've never thought of adding orange juice or trying this with ginger ale; may try those suggestions next time.

Great recipe - simple and tastes exactly how I remember it, brings back good memories!  I like it with the lemon-lime soda, but ginger ale is my favorite!

I'm 25 years old.  I still order Shirley Temples to drink half the time when we go out to eat!  I like it with Sprite or ginger ale, doesn't really matter to me.  I need to try it with a little orange juice like the other reviews say, what an interesting idea.

A very good drink, but maybe a little too sweet for some.  I like this best with ginger ale, and sometimes with a little OJ, as well.  If you're feeling naughty, add a splash of vodka or gin.  Enjoy!

Simple and delicious, yet something I'd completely forgotten about! My grandmother always took me to Ruttles (a 50's style diner) whenever she was in town and would always order me a Shirley Temple, b/c A) it was fun and B) because she loved the name! lol Thanks for reminding me about this drink! I will definitely be making this to share with my boys, and telling them stories of their great grandma! :)

A classic - so simple and yet my kids love it.  We didn't have anything to make our typical smoothie, so made these instead.  The daughter who "won the pretty picture glass" was over the moon excited.  Something fun to do with your kids.

Wow, this drink sure does bring back a lot of good memories! As a child, my dad worked as a bartender in a bar/restaurant, and when he worked nights my mom would take us there for dinner. I remember he would always bring me and my sister one of these and we just thought we were sooooo cool, lol! I haven't had one of these in YEARS, but when I took my first sip, it brought me right back to that time. Thank You for that! :)

We used 1 teaspoon grenadine per 4 oz of lemon lime.  The kids loved the cherry.... on a drink umbrella of course!

I loved this SO much as a little girl. I used to order it (extra extra cherries!)whenever my parents would take me to a nice restaurant, it made me feel very grown up! Now my 5 year old loves them and does the same whenever I take him out.

Been drinking these for over 50 years. Wonder if it is regional thing if it is made with gingerale or lemon lime soda. I thought restaurants only made it with lemon lime soda if they did not have gingerale on hand, but apparently not.  Introduced my 77 year old mother-in-law to them this summer and she wants them whenever she is at our house now.  Husband and kids love them too.
