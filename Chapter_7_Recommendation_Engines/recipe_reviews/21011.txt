I love pancakes and I love cheddar, so I figured I'd give this recipe a try.  Big mistake!  They tasted like omlets with flour!  I really can't stand eggs and maybe this recipe was made to mimic omlets ?!? if so it's perfect ~ that's why it's getting two stars. I could not eat more than one. They should be called Golden Penny Omlet Bites, they may look like pancakes but definetly do not taste like them.  Try the cheddar corn pancakes from this site, they are a million times better and not eggy.

I decided to make this because I had mistakenly mixed too much cheese into a recipe of egg and milk. Salvaging a cup of the extra cheese I made these. Unfortunately I'm not the best pancake maker so the first few were raw and then the next few were burnt. I liked the flavor though it wasn't really cheesy making me think the same as the other person who said that it was just adding more calories. I liked the sweetness though some thought they were better with salt and pepper , I did not. It may need something to top or dip them. I'm not sure if I'll make them again (since it was a fluke in the first place that I made it).

Update: Only used half the batter the first time around. A friend who makes pancakes well finished off the rest and we ate them with our hands as appetizers with salsa. Much better and have changed from 2 stars to 3 stars, possibly add more spice to pancakes for a savory taste (chili powder perhaps).

These weren't too bad, but they weren't too good, either.  They definitely need salt...when I added salt after the first batch I cooked, it improved.  I probably wouldn't make these again, though, as I like regular pancakes more.  The cheese in these surprisingly doesn't add much flavor so I'd just as soon save the extra calories.  Thanks anyway!

These pancakes were pretty good. I didn't have any cheddar on hand, so I substituted shredded American Cheese instead. The cheese brought out a nice flavor and we didn't use any syrup, but we topped it off with a tablespoon of gelato. It didn't come out fluffy, but its taste made up for that. My kids loved them and enjoyed making them with me.

This is one of the best pancake recipes I've had in a long time! Not only it's easy to make but it simply melts in your mouth at every bite. The only thing I changed is that I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!
