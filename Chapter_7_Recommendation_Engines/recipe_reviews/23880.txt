This was a hit for my son's halloween party. I couldn't find chocolate confectioner's so I used a bag of semisweet morsels instead- just melted it in the microwave and added the noodles to it. I used a fork to scoop out the noodles onto wax paper - you have more control that way!

Make sure you have enough of the chocolate coating as it will be hard to make these stick together if it isn't "wet" enough.  Also, you can pop the mix in the microwave if the chocolate starts drying too much as you make the spiders.
I used butterscotch chips (point side down) for the eyes.  My daughter said that they looked like spiders or mummy-babies, and I think if you used white chocolate coating, it would really look like a mummy head (I'd use chocolate chips for eyes with that one).  Very easy and popular.

I believe ECS's review is referring to a different recipe on this site called "Edible Spiders" so don't hold those comments against this cute and easy treat.

This was the easiest desert that I've ever made, and everyone LOVED them!  I thought that surely I would have to do something else to make these treats memorable, but I really didn't.  For a quick, easy, and delicious chocolate treat, these come highly recomended!

I made these with the Cupcake Graveyard on this site for a party last night and they were great. I did make dark and semi-sweet spiders and used the red mini m&ms for the eyes. Fool proof recipe. I also use this recipe for Easter time and make little nests out of the mixture in little custard cups, once they set up I fill them with Peeps and jelly beans. Kids love to help with this one.

This was a pretty cute idea -- I had a tough time getting the chow mein in for the legs, so I sprayed a fork with nonstick spray and used that to punch the holes first.

I tried the melted choclate, but it just wasn't quite enough so I bought some chocolate "Candy Qwik" dipping chocolate, melted that and used it in the same fashion.  They were a big hit because they were so cute - but marshmellows and noodles are a slightly odd combination!

Yummy!  But it is even better when you add 1/2 butterscotch chips and milk chocolate chips.  I also add peanuts in with the chocolate mixture before I add the noodles.  So easy and fun!  M&M's make good eyes also.  For Christmas you can use a red hot for a nose and two M&M's for eyes.  Rudolph!!!  :)

Adorable! First thing I learned was to use TONGS. I used ice cube tongs which helped "smush" the noodles together as well as easily scoop them out of the bowl. I used 1 pound 8 oz of semisweet choc morsels, one cup butterscotch chips (leftovers from another recipe) and a tablesspoon of shortening, melted on a double boiler. Once melted, I did in 2 batches by putting choco in a bowl then adding noodles. The wetter the better is true as they come out darker & noodles get covered more easily. Taped wax paper to counter, used white choc chips for eyes and black gel for big pupils. The closer the 2 eye chips are the cuter.

Easy recipe. I did tweak it a little bit though- Used a 24oz bag of semi-sweet choc morsels, melted in the mic and instead of using chow mein noodles (not really a fan) I used a 16oz. bag of pretzel sticks. I broke the pretzels up a bit to make the servings smaller- depends on how big you want your spiders. Had some leftover white choc chips I used for the eyes & dotted them with decorating gel. Made about 30-40 "spiders", they look more like monsters to me but they came out great!

I made these for a church harvest party and used white chocolate chips for the eyes and couldn't find the confectioner's coating so used semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were a huge hit! Adults as well as kids loved them! Thanks JSS for this delicious and super easy recipe.

Do NOT use ghirardelli it never melted, it is a huge mess, the noodles are not covered and I am going to a party in 3 hours, waste of money and time. If you know the chocolate melts, use it.

Made these for Teacher Appreciation the week of Halloween (See photo).  They are fun and easy to make.  I used 1lb of chocolate with a 12oz bag of noodles.  Made them last year for my Girl Scout troop.

These are so fun and easy! I make these every year with my son and nephews and we always have a blast. Sometimes while I'm melting the chocolate, I'll put a spoon or two of peanut butter in there...YUMMY! We decorate these w/ all sorts of sprinkles and edible decorations. Super fun for kids AND adults! :)

I have made these several times and they are always a hit.  I did make some changes. I use 1 bag of 12 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips and approx. 1/2 a bag of butterscotch chips.  Melt them together in the microwave (butterscotch chips melt at a little higher temp so you need to mix them in and "smoosh" them into the melted chocolate chips.) I can only find 5 oz. canisters of chow mein noodles, so that is what I use.  I use some of the remaining butterscotch chips (inverted) for eyes and black gel icing (smallest tube at the store) for the irises.  I'll upload a photo. Thanks JSS6801 for this great recipe!

I used half choc chips and half butterscotch chips. The butterscotch chips added a lot of needed flavor as the noodles are just totally flavorless. But they were easy turned out super cute! I think I will try these again at Christmas (minus the spider eyes!) and break up pretzel sticks. I think they would add alot more flavor (but also more work).

Super easy, super quick, super cute.  I made them for a family Halloween party and the kids loved them.  Like other reviewers, I used chocolate chips and melted them in the microwave.   I used white chocolate chips, point side down, for the eyes and put a tiny dot of black on them for the pupil (I had black frosting left over from sugar cookies).  The whole thing took less than 10 minutes.  I'm sure I'll make these every year!

Very quick recipe! I just melted semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave for a few minutes. I didn't have the chow mein noodles and didn't have time to go buy them so I used fiber one cereal! I got the same effect with a much healthier result! Mmmmm

I've made this before, but as a Christmas treat (I got it from my husband's aunt who called it "Reindeer Poo").  We make it with a bag of butterscotch chips as well as a bag of chocolate chips, which we actually just melt in the microwave and it always turns out great.  Don't be turned off by the butterscotch chips if you aren't a fan, I can't stand butterscotch on it's own, but it's delicious in this recipe.

These are very similar to a Yule cookie recipe that my daughter modified for Halloween, but she calls them "Haystack Monsters".  We melt semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of confectioner's chocolate - 10-second bursts in the microwave is easiest.  Candy-coated chocolates (we use M&Ms) for the eyes work great and easy - form them on waxed paper, attach the eyes, and let them set.

Fun idea! I used macadamia halves and mini chips to make eyes. These remind me more of Fry Guys than spiders, but they're pretty cute. :) Thanks for the recipe!

We loved these cute spiders! I made them three times this October for ourselves, work, and my son's preschool. I used one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and one bag of milk chocolate chips, melted, and mixed with one 12 oz bag of chow mien noodles (did it in halves). Then I used the mini M&Ms for eyes. Very cute and easy.

These spiders are too cute!  I remember this treat from my childhood, but couldn't find a recipe anywhere.  Thanks for brining life to a nostalgic treat!  I doubled the recipe & for the chocolate mixture I used 2 packages of chow mein noodles, 1 lb. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 8 oz. butterscotch chips, & 1 jar of peanut butter.  YUM-O!

i did the "mummy's".  i used white chocolate and then used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the eyes.  i sent these with each of my elementary children for parties in class, they liked them.  so then i decied to make them for the get together at work and, they were tasted, but that's it.  2 days later, i ended up throwing 15 "mummy's" away.  i was dissapointed in this, it was expensive chocolate also.

I normally do a similar recipe to make "haystacks" with only butterscotch, chow mein noodles & peanuts. So, this spooky variation was great! Totally easy to make and delicious. I also did a 50/50 mixture of butterscotch & chocolate morsels. I've already got requests to make another batch for a party this weekend!

An easy craft that anyone can do (especially kids.) Careful with the size of the spiders though, the chocolate likes to stick to all parts of your face while eating them!

Super easy, melted the chocolate in the microwave and used regular sized m&m's for eyes with dots of icing in the center. To make them set quicker, I put them in the freezer for 5 minutes and this did the trick, although the icing didn't set, so be careful if you are bagging them to bring somewhere.

These were great! So easy, my 2 & 3 year old loved them!!! I accidently grabbed peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch, but they came out great. I used the yogurt raisin eyes as some suggested. Just too darn cute.

A great enhancement to this recipe, however, is to add butterscotch and peanuts. Cut the choc in half and substitute butterscotch chips. Do the same for the chow mien / peanuts

I've used similar recipes to make these before (although not for Halloween), it's a nice twist on chocolate.  The noodles and chocolate combination sounds weird but really is a neat taste and texture.  I've also added nuts to them and used dark chocolate instead.  Dark Chocolate w/Cashews added is my favorite!  Also maybe you're not supposed to do it this way but I always melt the chocolate on 1/2 power in the microwave!

These were easy to make but they are messy. If you're serving to kids keep this in mind. I don't think I'll make them again because of the messiness.

This recipe was ok.  I did a trial run for my 5 year old son's Halloween party.  Neither of my children were crazy about them, after eating one or two they had enough and never wanted anymore.  We decided not to make them for school and it's not something I would make again.

Very easy and fun to make with kids (if you can keep them from eating everything before the chocolate hardens :)). We never put eyes on ours, but they were still great! 

This would also be great with white chocolate covering for easter.

I couldn't find chocolate confectioners coating, so I used 1 pound semisweet chocolate chips.  I cut miniture marshmellows in half for the eyes, and used little star sprinkles for the pupils.  Everyone said they tasted great!  Makes for a good Halloween treat!

I made these last night using mini m&m's for eyes.  They are inedible.  The packaged chow mein noodles I bought at the store were the problem. It was a waste of my time and food.  I would suggest getting noodles from an asian restaurant.  The store bought ones are just too gross.

These came out great.  I used a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chips and a tblspn of shortening because I had it on hand.  I used the suggestion of yogurt raisins with a dot of black icing for eyeballs.  Easy, tasty, and so cute.

Very cute and easy to make.  Didn't have any trouble with the noodles breaking.  I used a bag of Chocolate-Peanut Butter Chips and mini M&M's for the eyes.  Next time I would follow the recipe exactly instead of using the chips - they were a little messy to eat.  Kids loved them!

This recipe is wonderful.  Made it with my son for his grandparents, who keep running out and asking for more!  We have made three batches now, to share with family/friends - everyone loves these.  We've used combos of semi-sweet/butterscotch/PB that others suggested, as well as milk choc/butterscotch.  It helps to refrigerate the spiders if you use PB in the recipe - the PB makes the coating a tiny bit melty.  All were delicious and very fun to make.

This recipe is a family favorite for all of my aunts.  We use 1 part chocolate chips and one part butterscotch chips though.  It's great with nuts too.

These were neat-looking and fun to make although not as tasty as I had hoped.  But the kids loved them for the sheer novelty!

I whipped out two batches of these cute little guys in about 45 minutes this morning.  Good results and very easy - think they’ll be a hit at our Halloween party tonight.

These were really easy to make and tasted great. With a little imagination they really do look like spiders!
