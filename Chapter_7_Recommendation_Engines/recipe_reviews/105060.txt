The only recipe I could find using a purple cauliflower!  I used purple cabbage instead of green and added 1 tablespoon of hot chili sauce and 1 tablespoon of black bean garlic sauce.  It added some much needed heat.  Really good!

This stir fry was Great! I used shrimp,asparagus and yellow squash. Any vegetable you have available will be just right in here. Super fast I went to the local Chinese take out and bought some chow mein to go with it. I will make this again! Thank You Sarah.

the flavors of this particular stir-fry were decent, but it was a pain to collect all of the ingredients and i've had much better.  Easier sauces and easier to find veggies.

I enjoyed this except that I steamed the veggies too long.  My hubby wasn't as fond of the orange taste as I was , so I may just stick to using the teriyaki and oyster sauce without oranges next time...  Thanks:)

I though this was great. I am a fan of stir fry's with tons of vegetables and this satisfied me greatly. I got lots of compliments. I really like the hint of orange flavor, it was not overpowering and gave it an extra sweetness.  The only changes I made were using more Teriyaki sauce (I didn't think 1/3 cup was enough for all the vege's) and to reduce the cooking time when first steaming the vegetables.  I would use more like 5 minutes as I like mine still crispy. All in all a very tasty recipe.

This was good. I didn't really get much orange flavor out of it, and I think the veggies would have been good with half of the amount of steaming time. As is, just ok.
