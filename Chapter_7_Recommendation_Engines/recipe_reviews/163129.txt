Delicious! I love bagels with cream cheese and the addition of some smoked ham was a nice touch. I toasted my bagel first so I got some crunch along with the chewiness. Overall, very good!

This was tasty! I took the lazy way out and just used prepared honey mustard. I didn't measure anything, just did it to taste. This was a great, filling lunch and something just a little different from the norm! Thanks for sharing. :)

Just a tad too much honey for me. Frenches makes a great honey dijon that would probably go well on this. I put mine on broil for a few minutes to get everything warm. It turned out good.

Great snack, very filling. Choose your mustard wisely, it has a big impact on the taste! I used Colman's and the result was very savory (almost too much), so that I only needed to use a little on each bagel. I also toasted the bagels, perfectly complements the creaminess!

This is a very good recipe.  I toasted the bagel first and made them open-faced.  This would be good cold, I just didn't try it.  Didn't have whipped cream cheese, just used regular and it came out fine.  Also added chives.

I'm not a huge mustard fan, so I used 1 tablespoon of DM rather than 2 and ended up loving it! Tried it on an onion and asiago cheese bagel and both were great. The kids ate every bite.

pretty good. I took another reviewers advice & broiled it but the cream cheese got a little mushy which I don't care for. I did also add a slice of swiss. Maybe I would broil the bagel & the swiss with ham first just to warm it a little & then add the cream cheese mixture. Overall a good simple snack.

Really good!  I added tomatoes, onion, and lettuce and in this case, would not recommend it. I'll try these again by either broiling the bagel and meat and adding the cream cheese, or broiling the whole thing.  Something about these warm just seems like ooey gooey goodness. My additions knocked it down 4 stars, but I'm giving the original 5 for it's awesome potential.

My four year old son picked this recipe out for lunch this week, and we all thought it was really tasty!  I made six bagels, three ham and three turkey.  I used one block of cream cheese and 1 T. of Dijon and 3 T. of regular mustard (for the kiddos), and just whipped it all together till creamy in my mixer.  Toasted the bagels first, then spread with cheese and meat, the popped 'em under the broiler for 4-5 minutes.  Even the hubs was pleasantly surprised at what he thought was an odd combination of ingredients.

These are AWESOME!! When I started to make them, I realized I didn't have any dijon mustard, but I did have wholegrain mustard, so that's what I used. I only used about a tablespoon and a half and then added maybe an eighth of a tablespoon more of honey. Husband was wild about them. I toasted his bagel, but not mine. Great either way. A huge thumbs up on this recipe.
