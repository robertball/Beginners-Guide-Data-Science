My family loves this recipe. Have made it several times. I find it's just as good with or without the macaroni.

This was surprisingly good! I'm not even a big fan of sausage but I had some that needed eating and tried this recipe. Will definitely be making this again. I think the hot sausage is the way to go because I could see it being a little bland without it.

I really like this recipe.  It has been a big hit with friends and our young kids.  I throw in some extra pepper, salt, and some hot sauce to my bowl to give it a little zip.

A little bland but pretty good. It made alot more than I expected. We did add more sausage, next time we will try it with a flavored sausage.

This was so good...I turned it into a slowcooker meal.  I cooked up everything but the cheese in the slow cooker and then added 1 1/2c milk and a bag of cheddar cheese, because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a hot sausage.  It was great!! Thanks for this easy and good dinner.

This was just OK. I've never cared for canned cream style corn so that's probably why I didn't like this very much.  Gave the soup a "sweet" taste...

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out fine, I just wasn't big on the flavor. Maybe it's my fault for expecting something else.  My almost two year old who loves soup only took a couple bites.  My husband said it was okay but it was missing something.  I'm not good at just throwing things in but somebody could probably come up with something to make it awesome. Ended up throwing half of it away...
