Great hot chocolate, but like other reviewers noted, use whole milk rather than water. For Mexican hot chocolate, add a tablespoon of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of instant coffee. Gets very sludgy at the bottom so keep it stirred really well.

This was sooo good! I used 2% milk instead of water that it originally called for. My Bunco group really enjoyed every sip of it.

I used 4 c. milk and 1 c. water, and tossed in about 2 T. of creamy peanut butter for good measure.  Fantastic!

This was the best homemade hot chocolate I've made so far but it just needed to be a tad sweeter for our taste... the coco was the overpowering taste and without the whipped cream it just wasn't sweet enough. But everyone really liked it so I'm going to make it again but next time just use alittle less coco. I liked this much better than the store bought mixes that you just need to add hot water too. **UPDATE** I made this twice since the first time and I now make it with 1/3 cup coco, 3 1/2 cups water and 3 cups of milk... It's PERFECT!!! The kids keep asking for it. THANKS!!!

The first time I made this, it was WAY too rich...even for me, the chocoholic!! The second time I made it, I used sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, vanilla, salt, 1 can evaporated milk (not low fat) and 4 1/2 cups water, it made it really creamy and the cocoa taste wasn't overpowering. I'll definately make this from now on, with my adjustments!

This was very good and creamy and much easier than other recipes.  I will be making this again.  Just be careful and don't overcook.  I put it on low heat to keep warm and it changed the flavor a bit.  Next time I will place in a carafe to keep warm.  Delicious!

I copied this recipe down for future reference and ended up using it this evening. It's a nice quick treat when company pops up, but it does get very gritty. It took me an extra couple minutes to fix because as I poured it up I had to use a strainer so people wouldn't have grit at the bottom of the cup. I added a little whip cream when I finished and PRESTO! It was great.

Yummy!  Made this for dessert one evening at a dinner party... it was delish.  If anything, it was a little too rich... I added about a cup of milk to the recipe to balance the chocolate flavor.  It was da bomb!

Excellent hot chocolate here folks, but it needs a little tweaking for perfection!  I made two half batches and substituted 6 cups whole milk for the 6.5 cups water.  Previous reviews made it clear that you need the extra richness.  My expirement was to make one batch with 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa and one with half a 4 oz bar of Ghirardelli 60% cocoa bittersweet dark chocolate bar.  No doubt about it - melt that chocolate bar!!  I like it a bit spicy so I added some cinnamon and chilli powder as well, but it's fabulous without too.

I made this hot chocolate after cutting down our Christmas tree.  My boys loved it.  My husband and I added peppermint schnapps to ours and it was wonderful.  Will definately add to my collection.

This was very good and easy and will replace our usual recipe. I'd say this is much better than any I've had at any restaurant or coffee shop. Definitely use MILK instead of water.

Great recipe! Flavor is wonderful- rich, chocolately and not too watery. This will definitely replace the store-bought powdered mixes I've used in the past.

This is yummy.  We grew up with Nestle's and milk heated up, and I just can't deal with the stuff in a packet!  Never thought to use sweetened condensed milk, and I did use a combo of half & half and milk instead of the water.  Very tasty on a cold night with some whipped cream squirted on top!  I did also add 1/2 of a 4 oz bar of Hershey's chocolate, in addition to the cocoa powder.  For those of you who had a sediment problem, try using either an immersion blender or run it through your blender after it has blended, but before it gets hot.

This was absolutely, by far, the richest cup of hot chocolate that I have had!  I did make these changes; I substituted the water with unsweetened almond milk (35 cal/8 oz) and added cinnamon.  It was amazing!  I'm sure that I could have only substituted half of the water... I still can't get over how rich it was.

Made this tonite for the kids.  We loved it!  I did not put in the vanilla but followed the rest to a T.  A little sweet but next time I will do as others suggested and add some whole milk.
No need for packets anymore!

Really good! I made this for my kids after our local Christmas parade. I think some people are mistaking evaporated milk for sweetened condensed, which is what the recipe called for. I also used more liquid than called for, about 8 cups total, half milk and half water. I was also about 1/4 short on cocoa powder and so I used some milk chocolate chips. Didn't have the gritty-ness others mentioned but I also used a whisk. Served it with whipped cream-heavenly.

We made this just as stated, and it was perfect. The only thing I will do next time is to sift the cocoa. The lumps are kind of hard to get out. Milk would make it a bit richer, but I don't think it's necessary - just a preference thing. I added a bit of cayenne pepper to mine (I love spice!), but it would be great with a sprinkle of cinnamon, too!

Very good.  I put it all together the night before then put it in a crockpot for my daughter's class.  Simmered all day and was ready and creamy for the party.  I used water, next time will probably use milk.  Thanks. UPDATE: Used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 water - just delicious.  Recommend the substitute.

I've been experimenting with cocoa recipes for a couple of weeks now, and this is the best one I've found so far.  The sweetness is just right, and the "thick and creamy" quotient is perfect.  I would have liked a more intense chocolate flavor (but then again, I'm a chocolate snob); next time I will try a premium brand of cocoa powder and see what happens.

I made this recipe as directed with much anticipation (because I love the flavor of Eagle Brand Milk), but it was quite a disappointment.  I had to add creamer and sugar to even make it where my family would drink it.  I just expected it to be much richer and it seems so watery and I even used a little less water at first based on other reviews.  Maybe substituting milk is the answer as other reviewers have suggested, but I was out so I made it by the recipe with high hopes.  Oh well, they can't all be the best.

Very creamy...  Very easy...  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  I used 3 cups of water and 3 cups of milk.  I also topped with Cool Whip, marshmallows, and chocolate chips - which looked nice and tasted great!

Very disappointing. Made recipe as stated. It tasted watery. There was no depth, no richness in the taste. I would not make it again unless I substituted milk for the water. That might help.

use 2 cups half and half, 4 cups milk, and 1 1/2 cup water instead of 6 1/2 cups water--this will make it creamier.  Sometimes I double this recipe and pour everything back in the milk carton and refrigerate it as chocolate milk for my children.  In that case, I use the whole gallon of milk rather than water (and no half and half or cream).

This cocoa was rich and delicious.  I found that the sweetened condensed milk gave the drink just the right amount of sweetness and the recipe produced a nice large quantity of cocoa, good for when making this for more than just a couple of people.  We spiked our cocoa with Bailey's, and spooned cool whip on top.  So good...

It was so tasty, delicious.  Not too sweet at all.  So convenient to make this and leave the leftovers in the fridge.  I made it today since I wanted to taste it and if it was good enough, I would make it for my family on Christmas.  It will be on my menu for Christmas for sure!!

I made this last night for us to enjoy while decorating the tree. It was so EASY and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great. My daughter (the hot chocolate expert) loved it! I plan to make a triple bath tonight for family movie night at church. I love the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that it can be easily done in a crockpot.

Super-easy hot cocoa but it isn't hot chocolate, which has chocolate in it.  I didn't use the entire 6.5 cups water but put 2 cups water and 2 cups whole milk.  That was enough.  Next time I'm going to melt chocolate into the condensed milk instead of using cocoa. 
This recipe is tasty and fast.  I would make for sleepovers and brunches because it makes a lot and is simple and quick.

This was good hot chocolate.  Chocolatey and not over sweet.  It does get kind of sludgy and needs to be remixed before each serving.

I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk left over from earlier this week, so I halved this recipe and used it here.
I thought it could just just a little more chocolate flavor, it's just a might too sweet. I followed other reviewers lead and used milk instead of water. It's creamy, for sure.

VERY, VERY good and very soothing!  I did, however, add a bit more milk (sub. for water) than called for.  I found the overall recipe a little too sweet for my taste with the regular 6 1/2 cups of milk - so I added close to 8.  I found that was the right balance - BUT, that is/was just personal opinion.  I served some to my hubby after he got back from ice fishing and he RAVED about it.  Great recipe, will make again for sure!!

You can't go wrong with sweetened condensed milk, in my opinion!  Very creamy, very rich & chocolatey. I definitely went with the milk rather than the water.  I like that this is a large batch. It's plenty for my family of 6, and even leaves some to enjoy later. A very easy recipe, it's definitely worth a try - highly recommended.

Very sweet hot chocolate.  I made it with whole milk, and with the addition of marshmallows it is very creamy.  I would make again, but would like a deeper chocolate flavor.

Great recipe - I made as is - used fat free condensed milk- but only used 6 cups of water.  Delicious!

My husband and daughter really enjoyed this recipe. I followed everyone's advice and used half milk and half water. I served it with candy canes for stiring and marshmallows. I will definitely make this again.

Really good. I used 2% milk instead of the water, and Ghiradelli chococlate bars instead of the cocoa - one 60% cocoa and one 100% (unsweetened). (I doubled the recipe.) I did end up adding more cocoa powder, though, because it didn't seem chocolatey enough in color. I did it all in a crock pot for my caroling party and everyone loved it!

Absolutely YUMMY!!!  I made this the other night, and my entire family loved it!  I used the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and the hot chocolate came out so dark and creamy.  I did listen to other reviewers and used half milk and half water.  The kids enjoyed their cocoa with mini-marshmallows on top, and my husband and I enjoyed ours with a splash of vanilla vodka in ours!
An easy recipe that makes delicious hot cocoa!  I'll never go back to mixes again!

Easy to make and keep in the fridge during the holidays.  I put extra cocoa and a little cinnamon in mine and serve with icecream or whipped cream.

Kids loved it.  Made a lot so I served it to all the kids that gathered in my yard this snowy day.  I did use skim milk instead of water.

This is a great, quick and easy recipe...I agree with the earlier review...use milk if you want a richer taste.  When I made it with water, my husband and I agreed that it was a tad bitter and needed a little sugar.  Not much...but just a couple of tablespoons.  Great for making this ahead for large gatherings!

Made double batch for a Christmas party.  The adults enjoyed it as much as the kids (served with a bottle of Peppermint schnapps on the side for people to add if they wanted.) Also, used milk instead of water to make it richer.  One guest said it was like a dessert in a cup.  Use water if you want it less filling.

Very nice! We really enjoyed the recipe on this very cold winter evening. I may have added just a tad too much water. Next time I'll start with 6 cups and go from there. I was anticipating a little more creaminess. :)

Delicious and so easy! I made a large batch of this for a kids' holiday event. I used 5.5 cups of whole milk, instead of the 6.5 cups of water. I stirred the mixture pretty much constantly, and didn't find the finished product to be clumpy or sludgy at all. Once heated on the stovetop, I transferred the hot chocolate to a large slow cooker, and served from that throughout the event (leaving the slow cooker on "Warm"). It stayed smooth, creamy and delicious for over four hours, and everyone loved it. The next time I make it, I'll experiment with a batch for adults by adding salted caramel vodka!

My family was iced and snowed in for a WEEK! Having nothing else to do, they (obviously) played and sledded out on our hill all day. Of course, when they came in they wanted some hot chocolate to warm them up. I don't do hot cocoa mix - I believe in everything being cooked from scratch. After a week, however, we had run out of sugar and milk. I couldn't get to the grocery store for these ingredients, because as I said we were iced AND snowed in, so I went to my trusty pal allrecipes.com to help me out. OBVIOUSLY what I needed (and had!) was sweetened condensed milk! Why hadn't I thought of that? ;)
This recipe was just what my kids needed to warm right up and then to immediately get back out in the snow. Thanks, allrecipes!

It needs milk instead of water. I made it both ways and milk is the way to go. Very tasty, and very comforting on a cold snowy day.

I'm only rating 3 stars because I made some changes based on other reviews. I added a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and 2 cups regular milk then 3 cups of water.  It still didn't taste like anything special so I added some dark chocolate chips. Ultimately it was creamy and chocolates, all the things hot chocolate should be :) Also, if you slowly stir in the cocoa little bits at a time to the condensed milk, you avoid the "grittiness" or sediment that other reviewers complained of.

OMG this is by far the best hot coco I've ever made!(believe me, I've used a LOT of recipes) I've only made it about 2 times but then again, #11andcounting, so I'm usually not allowed to use the stove without adult supervision.(bummer??) But seriously creamiest, best, frothiest, hot coco ever.                                               Definitely must try

My aunt who lives with me drinks hot chocolate every morning like most people drink coffee and I just buy Swiss Miss from the store. We happened to be out this morning. So I decided I would make some although I have never made hot chocolate any way other than the powder and water before. This hot chocolate is amazing! Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make. My son and I made it in less then 10 minutes. I did however use whole milk in place of the water. My son added some marshmallow fluff and cinnamon to his and his sister's. It was pretty good that way as well. I definitely will not be drinking store bought anymore. Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Used whole milk rather than water. Also, chopped up some 60% cacao chocolate (not much) to melt in along with the cocoa. Topped it off with homemade whipped cream and some more 60% shavings. Turned out yummy!

I made as written with the exception of only using 1/3 cup of the cocoa. After reading reviews I thought I would go lower and add more if needed. 1/3 cup was perfect. I made in the crockpot as some others suggested. This is the best hot chocolate ever!!!!

As hot chocolate, it gets 0 stars; no one in my family like it. As an egg cream, it gets 5 stars, my mom says it makes the best egg creams she has ever had. When it's cold she fills a quarter of the cup with the chocolate milk (when I first make it, I replace half the water with milk) and the rest of the cup with sheltzer. As a result, this recipe gains 3 stars.

This is a MUST for holidays at my house! Everyone who attends our Thanksgiving and Christmas get togethers expects there to be a pot of homemade creamy hot chocolate on the stove already made and ready to pour into mugs. Thank you for giving us such a wonderful recipe to add as a tradition to our home :)

Kids and I rate this as the best hot cocoa ever.  We made the recipe as is, and it was thick and creamy, no milk necessary.  Perhaps the other users didn't heat the cocoa as long?  Easy and super yummy!!

One cold night we needed a hot chocolate fix but didn't have the ubiquitous brown squirt bottle in the fridge.  I'm glad because there is no looking back.  This is super yummy hot chocolate.

this is WONDERFUL hot chocolate!!!  i did the same as another reviewer and blended all the ingredients in my blender (except the water).  i used milk instead of water and i blended my last cup of milk to help "clean" the blender.  i don't know if this made it frothier or not but it was EXCELLENT!  the family loved it--we just had 4 snow days and they requested it everyday!  good-bye swiss miss!!  thanks eagle brand!

I like to make recipes the way they are written when I make it for the first time.  I shouldn't have done it with this recipe.  As it is written it tastes grainy and bitter to me.  I won't do this one again without major changes.

I tweeked this just a bit....I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 5 cups skim milk instead of water. I also used 1/8 tsp of real vanilla extract which ended up being a little too much vanilla flavor for my taste, but still delicious! I topped with whipped cream!

I made this with evaporated milk and 3/4 cup of sugar.  I put a little less cocoa in because it was strong the first time.  My family loved it.

So good.  Of course, now my husband says he ain't gonna drink that boxed  no more. My mom always made hot chocolate on the stove for us but she used canned hersheys syrup... It was such a special treat..  I served this to my son and husband on valentines morning in red heart covered cups and loaded with whipped cream and sprinkled cocoa on top...  Looked like a $5.00 hot chocolate...  Tastes great cold too!!!   ***** IMPORTANT*****  USE MILK!!!  NOT WATER!!!

This hot chocolate was very good. It was creamy and chocolaty and not too sweet.  The only thing is there was quite a bit of sediment at the bottom of the pan and in my mug despite a good deal of stirring, but it was tasty to sip up at the end (:

Very good.  I used half milk and half water.  If you don't use enough, it will be much too rich! I started with 4 cups (2 cups milk and 2 cups water) and added more until it mellowed enough for our tastes.  A perfect thing for a cold evening.

4 stars instead of 5 because I made adjustments to the amounts for my preferences. I really like this recipe with the following adjustments: I shorted the water--I used only 4 cups of water. I also added extra cocoa powder (probably a heaping tablespoon) to get a darker chocolate taste. I doubled the salt and added one shake of cayenne pepper. I must say I didn't try the recipe 'by the book' the first time--I tasted after each addition of 2 cups of water and stopped where I thought it tasted good. Using milk instead of water (all or part) would be a good sub, and I might use even a little more salt. If my husband doesn't like it this dark I might back off on that extra tablespoon for him, but I like it. :) The recipe was quite easy and pretty quick, so I might not bother making Alton Brown's mix anymore. :) Condensed milk tastes better than dry milk by a long shot.

My son requested hot chocolate and I wanted an easy recipe. This recipe seems a step above a packet of hot choc. mix. Which I like just fine. I did half water/milk because of other reviewers suggestions. I think it made it better. 
I would try this recipe if you want a simple and quick cup of HC.

I love this recipe and make it again and again.  It's great to keep made in the fridge, heat as you want it.  I add cinnamon and nutmeg to it sometimes.  Other times I add allspice or pumpkin pie spice.  It's good in so many ways.

I love this. It is very sweet though, so you can cut back on the condensed milk and then add to taste.

Excellent hot chocolate.. I made it with whole milk, no water.  Pretty sweet so I didn't add any marshmellows but it was exactly what I was looking for on this Christmas evening!  Thank you!

I made this as written but used whole milk instead of water. It was really good, I loved it! Hubby thought it was too 'dark chocolate' tasting (he really hates dark chocolate), but I thought it was fabulous!

Our family enjoyed this, particularly my 3 year-old son.  I set up a 'make your own hot chocolate bar' with toppings like whipped cream, marshmallows and peppermint sprinkles; he loved it!  I used skim milk in place of the water and also added 1/2 of a Ghirardelli semi-sweet baking bar for a litte more richness.  Wonderful - I will keep and use this recipe forever!

This was pretty good, I am a huge chocolate lover so I just had wished it was a little more rich.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought it came out wonderfully! Next time I will definitely use whole milk instead of water, but even with the water it was so much better than powdered cocoa mix!

I was really good after i added about 2 more cups of milk to it.  i was way too strong for us without it.  But besides that, it was very very yummy.

This was very good and easy to make.  Didn't notice any "chunky" quality to it at all.  It was very creamy and smooth.  I did follow the advice of other posters and then took it a step further by combining half and half with the milk, since I only had low fat milk- stopped at about five cups total, instead of 6.5 to increase the chocolate factor.  Yes, it was rich, but I like it that way!

So yummy! It took a little more work than the traditional hot chocolate envelopes we're used to but it is well worth the extra effort!  We made it with 1/2 milk and 1/2 water and it was very rich and creamy.  It reheated nicely the next day, too.

This turned out a nice batch of hot chocolate. I had some problems with little lumps of condensed milk and cocoa not melting in with the rest, despite constant stirring. I used the hand mixer for a couple minutes on low and that took care of it. My boyfriend dubbed it good, but not worth the trouble to make when some instant varieties taste better - I'd make again, but will continue on the quest for perfect scratch hot chocolate. Thank you for sharing.

Scruptious! This recipe caught my eye while looking for an instant powder mix. Tried a batch after the kids went sledding and what a surprise. It's excellent. Simple to mix up with ingredients I usually have on hand. It has a pleasing fudge like flavor without being too sweet or too rich. I'll be making this one often.

This was soooo easy and soooo good!  The only thing I might change is reduce the water to 5&1/2 or 6 cups of water.  This is a keeper at my house!!  I am going to try it with a dash (or 2!) of Peppermint Schnapps!

Its a good recipe for hot chocolate.  I used part chocolate milk and part water instead of just white milk.  It's extra sweet, so only for those of us with the extra sweet tooth.  I probably could add more water to balance it out a little bit.  But it is very chocolatey and pretty creamy.  Would be great with some whipped cream on to!  Good recipe!!!!

My kids were playing outside in the snow and I decided they needed something to warm them up when they came in.  I made this recipe and it got good reviews by all.  The only thing that I changed was I did half water and half milk to equal the amount listed.  Very creamy and very good!

I love this. We are snowed in and it was the perfect treat especially since it's made with pantry items we always have. I admit to using milk instead of water. It's rich and delicious a real hit.

Use milk instead of water and it's great. I like to add a little cinnamon and pinch cayenne. Stir well, can be sludgy like other reviewers commented

Very easy to make and tasted great. I made it exactly as posted and used a whisk the entire time. No sludge and everything mixed together nicely. Will definitely make this a staple for making hot cocoa.

I made this recipe as is, I love it,  exactly what I wanted. Make sure to sift cocoa so it doesn't have lumps. Next time I'll probably use milk instead of water for more creaminess. Overall great recipe.

I made my own variation of this. I used a medium sized block of natural bittersweet cocoa also, instead of the 6 1/2 cups of water I used two cups of half and half and two cups of 1% fat free milk. Be careful when melting this altogether, because I ended up with gritty pieces of chocolate all throughout the mixture. A quick blend in my blender fixed that though and this was the most smooth, creamy textured hot chocolate I've ever had!! Gave four stars because of the grittiness issue!

Made this for a Halloween party. Pulled this recipe out again for a Christmas party. Both times, I received rave reviews from adults, kids, and teenagers.  My only complaint is that if it sits and gets cold, it looks pretty gruesome and not appetizing.

Excellent recipe.  I made it the first time as is so my rating is based on the recipe and not my modified recipe.
Some people get confused between richness and sweetness, which is why I was weary of the reviews.
I did not find it to be too rich. In fact, I added a tablespoon more cocoa.  
However, I found it to be a tiny bit too sweet.   
As for the chocolate falling to the bottom and being grainy, make sure to boil the water so the chocolate dissolves. 
I boiled two cups of water.  I then added milk for the remaining liquid and the can of sweetened condensed milk. 

If the recipe included some milk and not 6.5 cups water, I'd say it would be a 5.

The first time i followed the recipe exactly. The next time, i made in a crock pot. Started high heat while mixing together then set to low for 2 hours and added 4 cups milk, 2 1/2 cups water. Then kept on warm for the remainder of the evening. It was perfect!

Followed recipe exactly. It's good but it needs something to eliminate powdery/grainy texture. I thought about using milk but that's a lot for the first time. I think milk would have gotten rid of powdery texture and made it smoother.

I adjusted the amount of hot water to get mine extra thick and creamy. This recipe produced a mug of rich, authentic hot chocolate for me and my guest, with plenty of extra stored for in the refrigerator for some delicious leftovers.

Good, but I used 4 cups milk and 2 cups water instead of just water.  Some of the reviewers mentioned it being very rich, but we thought it was pretty mild.  I will probably increase the cocoa next time to give it more of a dark chocolate taste.  The condensed milk makes it nice and creamy!

Best hot cocoa ever!  Rich and creamy, not watered down. Add fresh whipped cream and enjoy.

This was a great recipe. I used other reviewers' advice and used whole milk instead of water. My son is a chocolate lover, so I only used 6 cups of whole milk. It was delicious!

I've tried this recipe several times both with the microwave and over the stove.  It makes a perfect sweet treat for cold weather.  My best results came from cooking it over the stove using a molinillo de madera to work the chocolate and condensed milk in.  I have also tried tossing a serving's worth into a mug and microwaving it for a minute.  While it also tasted good that way, it was not as smooth as when I cooked it on the stove and really worked the ingredients together.  Either way, I definitely enjoy it!

Just had snow in Georgia!  While the kids were out playing, I realized I was out of hot cocoa.  Allrecipes saved me again.  I added about a cup or so of powdered milk to the water in place of whole milk, like was suggested.  I also added one chocolate bar as the sweetened condensed milk flavor was a bit overpowering.  Yum!

I made it with Hershey's Dark Chocolate Cocoa powder, and it made it much richer. I also added a few shakes of sugar to adjust the taste of the dark cocoa. Turned out really well!

This is the ONLY hot chocolate my family will drink!  No powdered hot chocolate in my house.  I serve it with marshmallow cream or real whipped cream sweetened to taste.  This is very rich and is a much demanded treat when company comes.

The syrup made by the cocoa & sweet cond milk is awesome! I will not buy Hershey's syrup again when I can make it so creamy at home.  However 6 1/2 cups of water I think was too much water and my kids ddin't not think it was creamy enough. I made a second batch and changed the liquid to 2 1/2 c. whole milk & 2 1/2 c. water.

I made this according to the recipe and found it bland. So I added about two squares of unsweetened chocolate (two T oil and 6 T cocoa) plus about 1/2 c extra sugar and it tasted better although a little too rich. I also added some mint extract as an extra. I think I'll be looking for a different recipe next time.

This hot cocoa is extremely rich and creamy.  I took the advice of others and substituted milk (1c.) for some of the water.  If I make it again, I will probably put a little less cocoa, as I thought it was a tad strong.

I absolutely love this recipe, and so does my husband, friends, and family!  I like to top it off with homemade whipped cream.  I definitely recommend this for any cool/cold day.
