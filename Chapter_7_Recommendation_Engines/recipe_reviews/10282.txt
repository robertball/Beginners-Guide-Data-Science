These bars are really good! I followed the recipe to the letter...except i only had a 9x13 pan, so I baked the bars for about 30 minutes, until they were golden brown on top and the center was set. These aren't too sweet and have a nice oat-y flavor and crumb. They beg for a glass of cold milk! Be sure to completely cool the bars prior to cutting...don't be tempted to try them early because they will just fall apart while warm!

This was just okay for me.  I would suggest adding a teaspoon of salt to balance out the sweetness of these bars.

As other reviewers suggested I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt to counteract the sweetness and the taste was great. Also, as another reviewer noted this is basically the recipe on the back of the Nestle Butterscotch chip package. I was looking to halve the recipe(didn't want 4 doz. cookies) and was able to recalculate it here. I would make this again.

The Bars themselves were very tasty, but the texture of the bars was very crumbly and messy.

This is a pretty good recipe.  Like others before me I added a teaspoon of salt.  The recipe is basically the same one off the butterscotch morsels on the Nestle package, so it is obviously a good start. I also added a little more vanilla and extra cinnamon to give it a little more.  I also baked at 350 for about 35-40 minutes because I used a slightly different pan size.

You will need to bake it twice as long as the recipe states.  
Very, very rich.  More for children's tastes.
Next time I'd use less butterscotch chips.

These were just ok.  After making this I decided it may have been better to use the batter as a cookie dough instead of bars.  I doubt I make them again.

Wow!  I was looking for an oatmeal and butterscotch chip bar and this was exactly what I wanted!  It was SO yummy.  I think I'll be making these much more often than regular oatmeal cookies!  Everyone in my house loved them!

Pretty darn tasty!  I'll make them again, but I think that I'll play with the recipe a little to make the bars more moist.

My family and I LOVE these, I have made these bars three times in the past month. I followed the recipe exactly except the cinnamon. I may have added a little bit more vanilla. The texture is chewy and almost melt in your mouth. Thank you for such a great cookie bar for a non-baker.

I LOVE this recipe.  It is my fall back quick cookie and I have been asked for the recipe over and over.  I usually don't even add the butterscotch chips.  I always add a little extra cinnamon and occasionally I will add raisins, chocolate chips, or trail mix.  The recipe stands alone!

I tried it today, but didn't have butterscotch chips... so I used white chocolate chips instead, and baked it for about 5-8 minutes in cookie shapes, and came up with something pretty sweet. :) We had guests over today and they loved it.

I did change these bars to gluten free  to take to church. They are moist and very tasty. I also added a very ripe banana to mix.
