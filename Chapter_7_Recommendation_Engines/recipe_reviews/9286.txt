A year ago, at this time, I was looking for something different to make for a friend and I found this recipe.  I started with one cake and ended with eight. This year it is my gift to all my dear friends.  My "secret ingredient" is actually a silicon bunt pan. ( I now own 3) Once the cake comes out and cools a bit, pour the glaze on and go to bed.  In the morning peel the glaze soaked cake easily out of the pan, wrap tightly and refrigerate for a couple of days to "cure". Put it on a pretty plate, and if you have the energy drizzle it with some melted chocolate.  I use dark rum in the glaze because my friends are so spirited. :)

There's no mistaking this for a scratch cake.  It's so obviously a boxed mix even with the rum.  If you want an authentic fresh tasting rum cake try the Brown Sugar Rum Cake instead.

This cake is FANTASTIC!  After visiting Grand Cayman on our honeymoon, my husband got hooked on the popular rum cakes they sell there made with local rum.  I wanted a recipe that recreated that cake, and this is it!  In fact, this cake is even better!  My hubby and neighbor raved!

Regarding the glaze, it's not supposed to be white, thick, or sugary like icing.  It's supposed to soak into the cake to give it that buttery rum flavor.

I used gold Tortuga rum and would recommend gold over white because it typically has more flavor.

Next time, I will let the glaze soak in longer than 30 min.  One side of the cake stuck to the pan, I think because it was still too wet where the glaze ran down the side of the pan.  Needs more time to absorb into the cake.

Ok licking the spoon and bowl of this cake is twice as fun as a normal cake!!!

This cake was amazing!!! 

Everyone liked it, even my mother... who is critical of everything!

I made extra glaze and concentrated it on the outsides of the cake so it would soak to the top. Next time I will take the cake out and pour some glaze in the pan and put the cake back in to glaze the top a bit more.

Next time I might add a bit more rum to the cake, not to the glaze... the parts saturated in glaze were fine, the parts that were just cake you couldn't taste the rum quite as much.

It was SOOOOOOOO moist! Everyone loved it. My sister almost ate half the cake!

This cake is very easy to make, and pretty good. It does need some flavor, and could use some ideas added to the recipe. I do recommend pouring half of the glaze into the pan first, and the other half later. The cake does taste good, and if you have already made a rum cake, and have special ingredients, try this quick and easy version!

I've made this recipe twice for guests...they love it!  It seems the glaze is a little thin, so the second time I made it I reduced the water to half the amount.  I've found that dark rum works as well as white rum.

I have made this cake twice now and it gets raves from EVERYONE. Usually, it's gone within the hour. Oh... one change I make is that since I don't drink rum, I just toss in the entire pint into the batter to get rid of it. It doesn't hurt the recipe in the least, it only adds flavor-- which makes it even delicious in my opinion! You'll have a hit at any party with this.

With the addition of a chocolate ganache on the top, this rates five stars.  I also made this in a 9X13 inch pan because I have trouble getting cakes out of pans (baked 40 minutes).  Before baking I put the nuts and some coconut on top of the cake mix (instead of bottom).  After baking, I let it cool then used the chocolate ganache recipe from this website.  Oh yeah, I also added some chocolate chips to the cake before baking.  The men at work really seemed to enjoy this cake.

Good, but a bit strongly flavored. The glaze was quite grainy and sweet.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving! Very moist, not too rummy, really pretty. I melted some chocolate to glaze it, though it really looked quite pretty as it was. Everyone was quite impressed. Thanks for sharing!

Not quite as good as the original version. It was still very good though, I made mine with black rum, figured the chocolate could handle the deeper molases flavor. Maybe would have been better with gold rum.

This makes a large, beautiful and delicious cake.  I highly recommend it.  Very moist and high in flavor.  I used chopped salted mixed nuts in the bottom of the pan.

So delicious and easy! I love the fact that this can be made with cake mix. It's so quick to make and tastes much better than any scratch rum cake I have ever made. I served it with fresh whipped cream and all of my guests oohed and ahhed over it...thanks for the great recipe! The only modification that I made was I used only 1/2 cup of sugar for the glaze, I don't like super sweet glazes and that was perfect. I let it soak for about 60 minutes before turning out of pan and that seemed to work well.

I made this cake as an alternative to the Bacardi rum cake. Followed the directions and it came out great. I mailed this cake to my sister to comfort her after surgery. It was waylayed by the post office (priority mail wasn't a priority, I guess)and it took over a week to be received. However, it still got rave reviews by sister and family. The rum had mellowed and it was still moist.  The rum saved it from becoming a dry ruined cake. The glaze was not grainy at all as stated in a previous review. Delicious recipe, let it set a day before eating for the rum to mellow.

I made this into a traditional "poke" cake - I baked it in a 9x15 pan - and left in there for serving!  I also used 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup walnuts to cover the bottom of the pan.  I also used macadamia nut oil, instead of regular oil.  For the glaze - make sure and use good quality, unsalted butter!!  Great taste - thanks!!!!!!!!      P.S. - we serve this cake as they would "over here" - by pouring a bit of "pouring cream" (heavy whipping cream, UN-whipped!) over the  top of each piece (make sure and warm the piece of cake slightly in the microwave first!)

I made it as the recioed stated and I would only give it a 4.  But it has a lot of potential, so I am giving it a 5.  I like a stronger rum flavor in my cake so I am going to add more rum.  I used a white rum in the cake and a gold for the glaze.  It was really good.  Non cake people went back for seconds and thirds.

I made it as the recioed stated and I would only give it a 4.  But it has a lot of potential, so I am giving it a 5.  I like a stronger rum flavor in my cake so I am going to add more rum.  I used a white rum in the cake and a gold for the glaze.  It was really good.  Non cake people went back for seconds and thirds.

This recipe has gotten a lot of compliments and never lasts long.  You can switch it up by changing the cake mix/pudding/rum flavor - Raspberry Rum makes a delicious chocolate raspberry rum cake!  I have also switched up with coconut rum and a pineapple cake mix and added some mandarin oranges for a tropical cake.  I think a dark rum with spice cake mix would be awesome as well.  So many possibilities with this recipe!!

This is an awesome cake!  I used the SuperMoist chocolate cake mix that has the chocolate morsels in it - this is a very dense, moist cake.  And, not too heavy on the rum flavor.
