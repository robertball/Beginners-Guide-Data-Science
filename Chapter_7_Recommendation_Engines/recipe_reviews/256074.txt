I sent these with my husband for his Thanksgiving potluck at work and now everyone wants the recipe. That makes for a pretty good recommendation.  

The ingredients list includes baking soda for the crust, but the directions never mention it, so I left it out and the bars were great.

These were rich, these were good. I made them as written and I would make them again and again! People couldn't stop eating them. 5 stars if not more!
