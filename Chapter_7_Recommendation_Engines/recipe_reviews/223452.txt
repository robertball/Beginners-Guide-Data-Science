Excellent! I made them exactly as directed- and put an egg wash on top. I will make these often!

I liked the taste but for me it needed a lot more pepper. I use fresh cracked rainbow peppercorn

Added more pepper and also cracked some on the tops before they went in the oven.  Didn't rise much...maybe I need some new baking powder? But the flavour and texture was awesome and will make again! Bisquits were so tasty the next day!

Tastes so good, I roasted my sweet potatoes in olive oil , cracked pepper and course salt. And still added more course pepper to the mix and again course salt. Then topped the biscuits with course salt:) not extreme amounts but man did they turn out delicious!! Totally recommend!!

Delicious light, sweet biscuits.  Would add more pepper next time as the pepper flavour was very mild.

The flavor of these is great.  I confess that I wanted all whole wheat flour so I use the baking powder measure from the "Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuit" recipe here on AR (4 tsp) to get a better rise and they still barely rose.  I post only to help others with similar inclinations.

I love it, it's so simple. I don't like sweet potatoes so I use Russell instead

These taste good, but they're sure dry and crumbly.  Good for dunking in soup, but not so good for a ham sandwich which was the intended purpose when I made them.
