Too much olive oil. Very bland.  Added more paprika, Italian seasoning, and fat-free feta to finally end up with something we wanted to eat for lunch.

This is great!!  There are so many ways to alter the recipe to your tastes too!  I use chunk light tuna b/c I prefer it to the albacore.  I have changed the pasta forms...depending on what I have available at home.  I've used regular vinegar and have used lemon-pepper instead of the paprika.  I've used onion powder, cut tomatoes if I did not have...the list goes on and on.  That base of tuna, vinegar, pepper, and garlic..it is a nice combo!

I turned this into quite a mashup with considering many of the recipe changes outlined in the comments. A splash of vinegar, half an onion, less than a teaspoon of paprika, no salt, a couple of shakes of pepper, quarter of a small bag of mixed veggies, small diced tomato, an enough Miracle Whip to make it look like a salad. Mixed that mess into the pesto noodles and we were good to go.

Loved it! I used Barilla Veggie Penne, canned tomatoes with a little of the juice and fresh parsley. I also topped with parm cheese. This is my new favorite way to eat packaged tuna. This would be great with feta cheese and black olives too. Yum!!

Very delicious - zesty and light!  But like others I had to make some modifications first: 
- used less oil
- added a few more vegetables (corn, green peppers)
- let the vegetables marinate in the oil/vinegar/seasoning (cajun seasoning is amazing with this) for a little bit then drained it (don't know if you need that much vinegar)
- mixed in the tuna
- sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and VOILA!!  
I had to have more than one helping!  Enjoy!

Just what I was looking for after traveling and craving real food with fresh ingredients, thank you. Like other reviewers I think it needs a little something to get it up to 5 stars for my taste, but the recipe is very adaptable. I added some fresh basil and parmesan. I will make this again and play around with the ingredients more. Nice to have a tuna noodle dish without the heavy ingredients.

This was ok, but I thought there was too much vinegar. I ended up using 3/4 teaspoon each of paprika, salt, and pepper. I used green onion instead red.

I followed the recipe. It was okay. I will use this recipe again but will change up the ingredients a bit for my own tastes! Not bad just needs more TLC.

I suppose I changed just about everything but the tuna and tuna. But the framework  is pretty much the same. I used much less olive oil, two large heirloom tomatoes, five large cloves of garlic, a handful of basil and cilantro from the garden, a pinch of black pepper and I tend to use a little more salt than most recipes call for.  I also used spaghetti instead of penne. And I omitted the vinegar, onion, and paprika.

I love that I was able to prep and cook everything while the pasta cooked. Super easy and fast meal. It tastes fresh and sits light on the stomach but is filling, and my son, the picky eater, ate two servings almost without coming up to breathe. Definitely a keeper.
