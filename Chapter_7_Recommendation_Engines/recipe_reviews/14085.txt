That previous recipe was really harsh. I've never made these before so I experimented with thickness and browness. I think it is all just personal preference. I did dunk in egg before breading just because that is always how I have fried anything. I would have submitted a photo, but my husband ate all of them before I could find my camera!

You failed to say that the tomatoes are best used while still green and sliced about 1/8th of an inch thick. Use VERY little sugar, salt, black pepper and Peanut oil or you will have burned grease and tomatoes. Drain thoroughly!!!

I tried this recipe but I added a little more sugar to counteract the bitterness. I am from the South and this is a great recipe

I tried this recipe because I didn't have eggs on hand. I tried a batch per the recipe, then a few more with milk. The bread crumbs didn't stick either way. I guess the eggs are just essential!
