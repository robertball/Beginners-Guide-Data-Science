I give this a top rating.  For a low-cal and low-fat dish, and yes, this is super healthy, it was loaded with flavor.  I do most of my shopping at Trader Joe's and this recipe, chicken included, cost me $15.00 to make (eight servings). I went with the original recipe and "tweaked" it to my families likings.  I started by cooking the chicken in a dash of Trader Joe's Garlic Oil (if you haven't discovered Garlic Oil -garlic infused olive oil- you are missing out) and held the chicken for dicing until just before the meal (this way the chicken keeps its juices and does not dry out).  Like others before me, I added many more mushrooms (one box of pre-sliced) and a whole diced onion.  I also added a diced yellow and orange bell pepper and some fresh cut basil.  Lastly, I added a ton of fresh garlic (almost a full head) and another can of diced tomatoes (Italian style).   Not only did this meal taste great, it presented fantastic as well.  All of the colors (red, orange, yellow, green) make a great presentation.  I topped off each dish with a teaspoon of both fresh grated parmesan and romano cheese.   If you enjoy eating healthy, don't pass this one up.  Next time, I am going to make this with some italian style turkey sausage.  I can't wait!

If you're looking for light and healthy, this is the way to go! I made several changes to the recipe to fit the tastes of my family. This is a great base recipe that leaves room for you to add your own personal taste!

I used basil, oregano, garlic seasoned diced tomatoes. I used tricolor rotinni. After cooking the tomatoes, onion and mushrooms for a few minutes, I added the cooked chicken (which I cooked in a little bit of butter and the italian seasoning)and allowed it to absorb the juices of the tomatoe. 

Garlic is KEY. I can't tell you exactly how much garlic powder I used because I was tasting and adding.. I did however use quite a bit. 

I really liked this recipe because it gave me the opportunity to make changes to suit our tastes. Since its just be and my husband, we had leftovers for 2 days. When you heat the leftovers up, it tends to be a little dry. Try adding a small amount of hot sauce OR Italian dressing, it moistened it up and gave it a little kick!

First, I rarely give a 5 star as that is "Thank God for this recipe!" food.  Like others, I used 2 cans italian diced tomatoes, left off italian seasoning, used 4 cloves minced garlic (cooked with chicken in olive oil), and 3/4 carton fresh sliced mushrooms.

Wonderful taste, even the kids gave it a 3 & 3 1/2.  Next time I may add 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning and an extra clove or two of garlic to give it a little more taste.  

This will be part of our rotation.  Thanks!

I loved this!  I added extra garlic (three more cloves), fresh basil, some sun dried tomatoes, and a zucchini that needed to be used before we went on vacation.  We ate half of it and I froze the leftovers, which were just as tasty reheated in a covered casserole in the oven.  Yum!

Very simple and delicious. I too used olive oil to grease my pan. I did add 1 clove of garlic to the chicken while it was cooking. Next time, I may use 2. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, more mushrooms, and some matchstick slivers of squash and zucchini. I think that 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning was too much, and when I make this again, I will use 2 cans of tomatoes with Italian seasoning instead.

It doesn't taste low fat, but (yay) it is! Even my boyfriend would eat it and he lives on tuna, water, and protein bars alone. I used Italian-style diced tomatoes instead of italian seasoning. It was easy and pretty quick. I don't see why kids who like spaghetti wouldn't like it.. it's great.

I grilled the chicken, added zucchini from the garden, minced garlic, and pesto for a little more flavor.  We loved it - even my picky 4 year old gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up!

This is one of those basic, versatile recipes you can add or subtract ingredients to your taste.  It's a great way to use up all your leftovers.  I used left over chicken and leftover veggies I had on had (bell peppers and broccoli).  Thanks, I'll be making this often :)

I cut the recipe in half and made it for hubby and myself for dinner tonight.  I used a couple of pre-cooked chicken breasts and cubed them, as directed.   I also used twice the required amount of tomato, 2 cloves garlic, chopped red pepper, and more onion and mushroom than required (I didn't measure), I substituted tri-color, twisted pasta for the mostaccioli.  The results were quite yummy.  Hubby had 2 full servings and  rated it 7 out of 10, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.  Next time I'll use even more mushrooms.  Definite winner!

I thougt this was a delicious dish! I sauteed 5 cloves of garlic and a whole small onion together with a little italian seasoning, then added a can of stewed italian seasoned tomatoes (i diced them up in the skillet).  Meanwhile, I grilled the chicken to cut the fat, then added the chicken to the tomato/garlic/onion combination. It was so good! I might even use more garlic next time.  Such a good recipe, thanks for submitting!

Very good! I added a can of Rotel.."milder" and stirred the parmesan cheese into the mixture instead of just on top. Just before serving I put some mozzerella cheese on top.

Delicious!! Used two cans of diced tomatoes and added zucchini, garlic, and sundried tomatoes as suggested by another member and it was great!  Make sure to saute the chicken in olive oil and use that same pan to cook the veggies - great flavor!

This was a great recipe - although I really think it may have been a bit bland if I made it as written.  Therefore, I added some garlic and mushrooms to the diced tomatoes - which were flavored with basil, oregano, and garlic seasonings.  I cubed the chicken right away and grilled it using the Spicy Chicken Breasts rub found on this site.  It gave it a nice kick!  Lastly, because I had no mostaccioli, I used penne pasta.  Yum!  Made a great lunch in a small amount of time!

Great. Instead of Mushrooms I used 3 Cups of Spinach. I cooked the pasta, and added the diced tomatos, onions, spinach, a pinch of garlic, garlic powder, and parsley. I did not cook this prior to adding to pasta. I cooked the chicken and diced it up and mixed into pasta mix and put back onto stove top until warm. Then used chicken breast to top the pasta. Also instead of Parmesan, we Love and only use pecarino ramano and grated ontop of dish. 5 stars!!!

I thought this recipe was quite delicious.  The only thing I would change is grilling the chicken first.  I tried it this way and I made a huge mess.  Next time I will just put them on the George Forman then cut them up.

This recipe was very good.  Very flavorful, but not over powering.  I loved it.  I added more onion than it asked for and used Italian style diced tomatoes, it was very good.  Will definitely make it again.

Very good base, but if I followed the directions for ingredients it would have been too dry (not enough liquid) and missing something flavor wise. First of all, I browned my chicken in Olive Oil which adds a nice flavor. 3 mushrooms is  nowhere enough, I just kept adding until I thought there was enough. Also added more onion and lots and lots of fresh garlic for flavor. 1 can of tomatoes is also not enough, I added 2, plus a little sauce because 2 was not even enough. I also like to use as many fresh herbs as I can which gives better flavor than dried. Maybe the next time a little white wine in the mix would be yummy.

This was wonderful!!  I used 2 cans of Italian flavored diced tomatoes as suggested (and I still ended up adding a little more tomato sauce), and added the zucchini and garlic.  Also seasoned the chicken with the rub from this site.  It was so good and healthy and filling!!  Next time I will add more zucchini and other squash.  Very, very good - a KEEPER!

This is such a great dinner!  It's very healthy and light.  I used rigatoni pasta, omitted the onions and added orange & green bell peppers.  I also added 2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms and fresh steamed broccoli.  I then cut the chicken in chunks before cooking.  This was very easy to put together on a busy weeknight.  My husband & I enjoyed this very much!

This recipe was wonderfully flavored. I used olive oil to cook the chicken instead of vegetable oil. All in all this was very simple and very refreshing.

Just made this tonight and it will be used again!  Husband and 2 year old loved it too.  After reading other reviews I added two cans of Italian diced tomatoes, a red and yellow bell pepper and a sliced zucchini.  Hubby thought mozzarella would be even better than the parmesan next time.  It's a great base recipe that you can really add your favorite veggies to and make it colorful!  I really like that it is a lighter pasta dish than standard pasta sauce.

I have been put on a low-fat, bland diet after finding ulcers, hiatyl hernia, and kidney stones. I have been searching for good recipes that fit the few things that I can eat. AWESOME recipe. I did add a little bit of tricolored peppers, extra mushrooms, and a little garlic. I cut back the salt and added low-fat parmie. Came out wornderfully served with farfalle pasta. This is a definite "do again" recipe!

This was great. Used salt-free canned mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms.

I can't believe how tasty this was! I followed others' suggestions and added bell pepper (red), 3 cloves of garlic, more mushrooms and used tri-colored rotini as well. Has anyone tried this with tuna fish? Might be yummy too! I'll definitely be making this one again and again!

YUM! For being so healthy, I was surprised at how much flavor this chicken had! The only thing I did different was I chopped the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking. I served over multi-grain penne.

Very good recipe! Based on other reviews I changed a few things though. I added 4 cloves of minced garlic, another can of Italian diced tomatoes, 2 leaves or fresh chopped basil, added a whole onion, added a diced yellow and a diced orange bell pepper, added a few more sliced mushrooms and I didn't add any cheese. The family loved it and I will definately make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a good, basic, light option for a chicken pasta. The only thing I did was add a handful of quartered fresh cherry tomatoes and some splenda to cut back on the acidity. I wasn't wowed but considered it a tasty easy dish. I will make again.

So good! I used italian tomatoes and used a chicken cutlet instead of the chicken breast. We had it with the cheddar bay biscuits, also on this site, and it was delicious. And, even better, healthy!

A very easy and delicious meal! I'm one of those people that rarely likes anything I make myself, but had be gushing! I even made it the next day for lunch. YUM! The second time I made it, I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of canned diced, and it was excellent! I will be doing it that way from now on. I think this recipe will make it's way into the meal schedule every week! I would consider this a heart-healthy recipe, as it doesn't much fat, cholesterol, or sodium. If you watch sodium consumption throughout the day, this will be a very healthy dinner. I added heart-healthy butter to the pasta after straining, and before adding spices and cheese--it was GREAT for coating the pasta in that yummy cheese! Kraft reduced-fat Parm is wonderful and nearly like eating air in regards to negative nutrition info.

What a great recipe. Subbed red and yellow peppers and spinach for mushrooms, as I had that on hand. Was very pretty to look at. Had to mix my own seasoning, again using what I had so simulate the Italian seasoning. Forgot to add parmesan, but it was so full of flavour, didn't miss it. I usually prefer the creamy type sauces, but loved this lower fat tomato version. Will definitely make again.

Amazing!  This recipe is wonderful and flavor packed!  I added a thinly sliced onion, red and green pepper to the mix and my husband adores it!  He's asked me to make it several times already.  I like the flexibility of the recipe...in the summer, I plan on trying it using fresh squash.

As a college student on a budget, this was a perfect meal. I used a pre-cut basil and garlic marinated chicken from Central Market. I also used 1/2 an onion instead of 1/4. To add some kick I added a dash of cholula but you could easily use some red pepper flakes or another spicy component. Quick, easy, and healthy.

After reading the reviews I also made several changes.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with s/p and garlic powder.  I sauteed 5 minced garlic clovesin EVOO to infuse the oil and then cooked the chicken.  I added way more muchrooms and also added additional onions and yellow and orange bell peppers.  Used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes and added additional italian seasoning and dried basil.  I used garden colored rotini and topped each serving with the cheese.  unfortunately, this lacked a lot of flavor and just wasn't what I expected.  I really thought b/c of the reviews it would be awesome but it really just tasted like a bland chicken/veggie pasta.

This was a good recipe base. I've modified my version with more vegetables and spices. I mixed the sauce, cooked pasta and cooked chicken together in a casserole dish and baked it in the oven with cheddar cheese on top.

This recipe gets high marks for versatility, and it's good for people watching their budget or their calorie intake.  But I wasn't wowed by the taste.  I doubt I'll make it again without a lot of changes - but this recipe does adapt very well.  This time through, I doubled the tomatoes and added a small can of tomato sauce and some garlic.  I stuck with just the three mushrooms since I'm not a big fan of them, but it seemed a bit silly to use only three.

Although this went over well with dinner guests, I did not care for it.  I felt it was over seasoned.  If I attempt it again, I will drastically cut down on the italian seasoning.

A good basic recipe that you can take to the next level.  I doubled all the veggies.  I seasoned my chicken and cooked in E.V. Olive Oil.  My husband and daughter both enjoyed the recipe.  It was very quick and simple to make.  A great weeknight recipe!

Very good!  I added garlic and fresh baby spinach to this and it was great! I think it would be good as it as well. My 1 1/2 and 4 year old ate it up! I will make this again.

Yummy... I added some leftover asparagus and 6 oz. chicken broth because I only had a smaller can of diced tomatoes... very good!

This was popular at my house.  It looked a little dry when I was mixing it all together so I added 1/2 cup of jar spaghetti sauce.

This was a great basic recipe!  I liked the flavor and if this is light eating, than I am thrilled!  However, I would have changed a couple of things.  It definitely needs more mushrooms -- three is nowhere near enough!  Less chicken, more pasta, and more diced tomatoes.  Also, real grated parmesean makes this dish great!  I will be making this one again!

This had such a great taste considering the very common ingredients! The only thing I changed was that we used shredded mizithra cheese instead of parmesan but romano or feta would've been good too. This was nice too because I only had 3 chicken breasts and didn't know what to do with them because you usually need 4-6 to make anything else! Thanks Mikandi!

This was a great, light recipe. I used Italian-style diced tomatoes, as well as one orange and one red bell pepper. Next time I will add more tomatoes and mushrooms to enhance the taste, but overall we really enjoyed this!

This recipe is very quick, easy, and healthy. I added an extra can of tomatoes and lots of minced garlic, it turned out great.

I just made this.   It was great with a few modifications.   I did add 2 cans of diced tomatoes and lots of garlic but after I put it altogether I baked it in the oven after  adding mozzarella cheese to the top.   Parmesan should have changed the taste.  I will definitely  make again !

I appreciate the healthiness of this meal, however my taste buds didn't dance. I added a bunch of garlic, and topped it off with parm cheese, but it was still just mediocre. My husband and son loved it though!!!
