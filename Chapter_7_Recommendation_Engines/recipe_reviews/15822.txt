Absolutely fabulous.  I used a pie pan that was too big, so I had extra filling, which I cooked on the side in a little dish.  I'm eating it as I type, and it's not even chilled yet.  I love it.  Thanks.

I'm surprised at the negative review.  I loved this.  It is certainly different from the typical mango dishes, but was very tasty.  I used mango from a jar and lime juice from a bottle, but it was still good!

After the mango has been pureed with the milk, it and all the other ingredients can be mixed in the pie dish-- a big plus in my tiny kitchen! I used a thick blueglass pie dish and no crust, which makes for a very moist custard. The bit of lime really enhanced the mango.
The flavor was a little milder than I was expecting, but still very tasty. Kids might want something sweeter, but this is just the thing for those coffee-and cravings.

So simple and easy to make - and it tastes delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.  In case you don't have evaporated milk on hand you can substitue cream or make your own.  I reduced about 2/3 cup of 2% milk to the 1/4 cup it called for by simmering it on the stove.  Just be sure to stir frequently.

Living in the kingdom of fruits, Taiwan, I am lucky to have sweet, fresh, and very good quality of mangos. Since the mango is so fresh, I didn't use any spice and hoped to get the original mango fragrance. Unfortunately the natural flavor and fragrance were gone after baking. The custard became very plain, I have to say. As a result, I topped the pie with more diced fresh mango and it turned out not bad.  It's important to keep this pie in the fridge at this hot summer. Or the custard will turn too soft, and the mango will collapse down.

Recipe as written makes enough for two pies. I poured mango puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove fibers. I subbed condensed milk for the canned milk. Really good flavor. Will be making this for the holidays.

OH Yes, but of course it was superb as any mango dish I have eaten. Simply delightful, the milk and lime juice reminds me of the south american drinks I recently experienced. I love cinnamon so the 1/2 cup cinnamon was a wonderful surprise. Thank you, Mrs. Evelyn

This was good.  I didn't use a crust (personal preference) and I used 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg because I didn't want the cinnamon to be too overpowering.  I found that it didn't set in 30 minutes.  It's probably my fault because I used mango pulp from a can.  Maybe pulp is thinner than puree.  Not sure. I had to keep mine in the oven for close to 50 minutes.  I ate it the next day, and I was impressed.  I think I'll make this again.

I've made this twice, once with mango's that were a little bland (turned  out great).  Then the second time was with mango's that had a lot of taste....(turned out horrible).  This was a very good recipe with the bland mango's, so I will give it 5 stars.

This was very good.  I love Key Lime Pie, so this was a nice tropical twist to one of my favorites.

To be fair, I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly. When it was time to eat, my husband and I couldn't even eat a forkful.  It had a horrible, strange smell.

Used a graham cracker crust instead of pastry, and it was great.  My non-mango loving children looked for seconds!  Easy to make, too.

Exotic and flavorful, sweet and tangy. It was nearly perfect save for the vague aftertaste of the flour in the custard. Maybe if you cut back on the flour in 3rd step? Otherwise very tasty :)

Yum! This is very good.  I think next time I may use less cinnamon though because I'd prefer my mango flavor as is.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making it a lot this summer.  :)

Very yummy. I didn't have and fresh mangos and only one can of canned, so I used a can of papayas as well. I pureed the two together in a food processor after I strained the juice. Personally I would have reduced the cinnamon a bit, but my boyfriend loved it. I also used a graham cracker crust since I don't really  like regular pie crust. The custard texture was great.

A waste of good mango! None of the three people who tasted it could eat more then one bite.  I don't think lime and milk make a good combination.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious! It's true that baking changes the flavor of the mangoes, but they still shine through and I liked the pie's subtle sweetness. I used Truvia instead of sugar.

This was just okay. Took several minutes longer to cook, and to me it had a weird flavor. My husband thought it was good, but certainly not my best pie.

I followed the recipe exactly. I have a mango tree and freeze a lot of the fruit.  Always looking for mango recipes. This was easy and good but I will make it without the cinnamon next time. It really doesn't need it and I'd rather get the full flavor of the mangoes. The cinnamon gives it a subtle spice flavor, kind of like a pumpkin pie. Otherwise, it was great ! Be sure to let it chill properly, it only gets better. Top it with a little whip cream.

Made this today and it was a hit. I used fresh mango and puréed with the evaporated milk. I will be making this again and next time I'll back the pie crust first then pour the mixture and bake for 30 min.

it was good, but it needed something more. I made it with canned mangos and fresh lime juice, will have to try adding more lime juice to it so it has more taste. otherwise it tasted like a key lime by but with a hint of lime.
