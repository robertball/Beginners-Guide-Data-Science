It turned out really well, but I made quite a few changes. I fried the cauliflower a bit first before adding anything else. I used shredded cheddar. I cubed the zucchini.  I toned down the adobo a lot, only using a tbsp. plus 1/4 cup Greek yogurt. I used a sunny side up egg. I didn't microwave anything.  DH loved it. will make again
