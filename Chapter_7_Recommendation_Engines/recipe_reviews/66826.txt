Sorry but I didn't like these at all... the mayo and sugar combo was too much for me and they were very sweet with 1/2 cup of sugar. I would recommend cutting the sugar in half.

Awesome, these were soooooo goood, my whole family loved them.  I really like carrots with brown sugar, but the rest of my family likes them plain, this was  a good combination, cause they were definitly sweet but not overly and the kids love anything with crackers!!!!  Awesome recipe,will be making it again.  Oh and the only change i made, was that i sauteed the onions in butter instead of steaming them, because i absolutely love sauteed onions!!!!

I was looking for a recipe to use up the last of my carrots, so they would not ruin. I tried this recipe and it was great!! Had the best taste! Now, I know just what to do with my left over carrots!

I loved this, but hubby did not, he thought it was too sweet and I even cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup.  I might try it again using even less sugar, but overall I thought it was different.

This was delicious!  Simple and so good!  The only change I made was to add more crackers on top with a little melted butter/margarine and then sprinkle on top, this gave the casserole alot of crunch.  Will definitly make again!

This was very good. I didn't use the sugar called for just sprinkled a little on but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was a big hit at our Easter dinner.

Was somewhat skeptical about this combination at first, like some of the other reviewers, but I have to say, it is AMAZING! My daughter even ate this and she hates cooked carrots of any kind! I did cut way back on the sugar and added butter and a lil less mayo, with a lil bit of onion and garlic powder. I will definitely make this again...it is AMAZING!

My husband liked this so much I actually made it twice in one week! For the mayonnaise, I used the do it yourself recipe from the "salmon deviled eggs and homemade mayonnaise" recipe on this site. I think that worked extremely well with the sweeter taste of this casserole dish. But I did only use about 1/4 cup of sugar, as suggested by other commenters. Also, it is really great right out of the fridge the next day--even better than when it is first done!

Delicious!  Based on previous comments and what I had on hand, I tweaked the recipe and it was very tasty! I only had 1 pound of carrots and to that I added  1/2-3/4 cup mayo, a TBS of sugar, 1/2 cup panko crumbs, and 1/4-1/2 cup French's Fried onions.  The hubby agreed, this is a keeper!

This was very good.  I did cut the sugar in half and it was very sweet.  I sauteed the onions in 2 Tbs. of butter then added to the drained carrots.  I also added more buttered cracker crumbs on top. Would make it again.

I wasn't out of white sugar so I substituted brown (maybe 25%) and used my home made Dijon mayonnaise. It came out fantastic

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my family enjoyed it.  I used regular carrots and made the home-made mayo as per one of the suggestions.  I also reduced the sugar as many reviewers suggested.  I will definitely make it again.

I've been looking for new & interesting ways to prepare veggies.  This was pretty good.  I didn't use all the recommended sugar...more like 1/3 cup instead of 1/2.  Tastes even better then next day!
