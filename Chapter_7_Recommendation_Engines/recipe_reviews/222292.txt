The combination of watermelon and raspberry with the mango created a weird flavor. Could have been the watermelon & raspberry, but maybe removing the lemon juice since both raspberry and mango both have a hint of "tangy-ness" might fix the "off" flavor. Will try this one again with just a hint of stevia powder to bring additional sweetness.
