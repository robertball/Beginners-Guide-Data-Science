My local grocery store does not carry Greek yogurt or onion soup mix so I substituted with 8oz of sour cream and a can of Cream of Onion.  Also, I was mislead by the list of ingredients...it has a bag of tater tots listed two different times so I thought it was a mistake and I only bought one.  It wasn't until I got home and reached the last step in the directions that I realized that I needed TWO bags of tater tots.  Make sure you have enough...you will need it.  

I suppose one day I may try this with the Greek yogurt and onion soup mix, but honestly..I loved it so much with my substitutes that I may just continue making it my way.  It was divine.

this was a big hit.  I used broccoli cheese soup (all i had in the house) and added a splash or two of white wine which really gave it a nice flavor.  I did not include the yogurt or the onion soup mix as the soup was pretty flavorful on its own - just thinned it with milk and the little bit of wine. I halved the recipe as I was serving only 3 people and we ate the whole thing. (I still used the whole can of soup). I will make this again!

This has to be the best Tater Tot Casserole I've made. I used sour cream instead of Greek yogurt, half the amount of cayenne, and used 1 bag of tater tots and ground chuck in place of the other bag since I didn't have a 2nd bag of tater tots. I also used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken since I was using beef in it and not just tater tots. I figure this recipe would've been just as great had I followed it by the letter

I used a can of cream of onion and a can of cheddar broccoli instead of the cream of chicken. I also added a pound of hamburger into this. My family loved it!

My family loved this. only thing we changed was we used ground chicken instead. ground chicken makes a difference in cooking to my family. it seems since we switched over to ground chicken food has a better taste. this is a wonderful recipe.

I would make this again although I would cut the tater tots in half and add more veggies.

The flavor was good but a little too salty and spicy (though we do love heat) so next time will eliminate the onion soup mix and use less cayenne.  I will definitely make it again.

A little too spicy, will make again for sure but omit the cayenne. I also added chopped carrots and zucchini for extra veggies.

OMG! Followed directions exactly and it was a big hit.  I added chicken and topped it with sour cream.  Also used Lipton dry onion dip (I think it has less salt then Hidden Valley).  I will cook the broccoli in the microwave for like 3 minutes next time because I like when it's thoroughly cooked.  This recipe makes a lot so plan for leftovers.  Soooo yummy!

I liked this, but found it too salty even though I eliminated the added salt. I'm thinking I'll add more veggies to it or mix it with scrambled eggs for a breakfast meal.  I'm also wondering if it can be frozen, as even though I halved it, there was quite a bit.  If anyone knows, please let me know.
