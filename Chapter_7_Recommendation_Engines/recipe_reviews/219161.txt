Coming across this recipe while looking for something different to do with asparagus reminded me I had black salt I brought back from Seattle I'd never used. Hard to tell from the photo I submitted, but the black salt is REALLY black - big flakes that almost look like charred bits of wood!  It looked  so cool!  Mild tasting, it complemented the asparagus, brightening its flavor.  But I didn't broil this - roasting the asparagus at 425 degrees for 12-15 minutes produced the guaranteed results I desired.

I've had a jar of black sea salt languishing in my spice rack forever so right away I have to thank you for the only recipe I've ever seen that uses it. And it works! I never use my broiler and didn't feel like turning on the oven so I sauteed my asparagus in some Kerrygold butter and a little water until tender/crisp. Sprinkled on the black sea salt just before serving and really enjoyed the unique flavor of the salt with the asparagus. One thing though, once salted, you should eat it right away. The salt starts to liquefy and turn into a very unattractive mess. I really think its best use would be on cold or room temp foods. Thanks for this one! :o)

I, too, purchased some black lava sea salt.  It's difficult to cook with because if you get too complicated the black seeps into the food.  This recipe is simple, easy, and delicious.  Loved it.
