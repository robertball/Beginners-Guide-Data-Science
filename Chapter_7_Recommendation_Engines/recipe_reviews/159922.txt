I was happy to find a rhubarb cobbler recipe here, and tried this one, and it tasted good.  However, the topping didn't have enough liquid in it, so I added more sour cream and a bit of water; otherwise it didn't even have enough liquid to mix the flour properly.  Next time, I would probably add some brown sugar crunch topping of some sort to add a bit of interest.  It was very easy to make, though, and everyone scoffed it up with whipped cream on top.

This was just ok. There was really no "pouring over the rhubarb". It was more like dropping it and spreading it, like a biscuit topping. I am glad I tried it, but I probably won't make it again.

Neither of us cared for this at all.  The fruit part was much too thick; no juiciness at all. Ditto on the topping. I had to add some milk to the batter not only to mix it, but even more to make it "spreadable" as the recipe directed.  The finished topping  part was, how shall I call it, almost rubbery.   Also, the ratio of topping to fruit was off - too much topping, not enough fruit.  Hate to rate it like this, but it just wasn't to our liking.

I made this with a few modifications and it was fantastic.  The first modification is that I used vanilla bean Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, and I also didn't have enough white sugar, so I used brown sugar in the cake part.  I also added about 1/3 cup of water to the batter because it was too dry.

 I also used two bags of frozen rhubarb, rather than fresh.

It turned out very well, and even the kids, who were skeptical at first, ended up loving it.

Thanks for sharing the recipe!  We'll definitely make it again.
