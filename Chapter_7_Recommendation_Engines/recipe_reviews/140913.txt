I agree with one other reviewer to add more onion, but aside from this - it was great! Just as I remember from childhood! Keep in mind that this recipe makes a ton. I cut it half and still had plenty for both hubby and myself for a couple of meals.

My recipe for this is almost as good, passed down to me from my German grandmother who grew up in Ellis County Ks. We don't puree the sauerkraut and trying it both ways I like it better not pureed. We make them into round balls held together with a toothpick instead of rolling into cylinders. Also try adding a lot more onion. This is so good! Especially when the weather is cold.

I really like the flavor....next time I will put together without cooking the meat first & just cook longer...the mixture was crumbly and hard to roll them with the mixture falling all over.  I love sauerkraut and that really adds nice flavor.

Made these tonight.  I've always been a big fan of Middle Eastern style cabbage rolls, so these looked like a nice change to a familiar theme.  I basically made the recipe as written with the only changes being the spices I added to the meat as it was cooking.  I added Nutmeg, Allspice, Garlic powder, Sage, and a small amount of Ginger.  Had I not added the spices, this dish would have been considerably more bland.  With the spice additions, and the accuracy of the directions given, I give this recipe a solid 4 stars.  In addition, I made a creamy mustard sauce to go with the rolls.

There was a lot left to be desired for flavor. Kicking it up on the spices would definitely help. The texture was great. The cabbage was cooked perfectly for working with.  I might try this again but definitely not as written, I will add typical sausage flavors to the mixture. Also, I might add a bit more sauerkraut.

In traditional German fashion (and midwestern in my experience, for that matter), there isn't much flavor. The taste of the cabbage is long boiled out, as is the flavor of the filling. Before I baked it, I was really excited about the stuffing, but after an hour and a half in the oven, it was pretty much a consistent flavor throughout. It was edible, filling, and rather healthy for the large amount of meat in it, but I wouldn't make this again.

I used 50/50 with beef and sausage. I also added additional spices.  I used 1/2 onion, 3 cloves garlic, paprika,  parsley and poultry seasoning. I cooked the spices  chopped  sauerkraut  with the meat.   I only steamed the cabbage until it was pliable and baked for 40 min @ 375. It was delicious and my family was pleased.  I served with applesauce.

Although I've never had these personally, all of my Russian friends around the counties of Ellis and Trego love them!

This was good. I can see why some people said it was a little bland though, just add a little salt and pepper to the top of the galuskies before serving. I might also add a little more sausage next time. It was very good though, thanks.
