I followed the directions exactly and I used a regular cupcake pan and regular refrigerated pie crusts that I rolled out and cut with a 3" diameter glass and then put 1 spoonful of pecan filling in each.  The recipe made 36 little pecan tarts.  I made these for a company Thanksgiving potluck and everyone raved!  They were the best tasting (and best textured) pecan pies I've ever made and they were the perfect serving size for a gathering with lots of deserts to try.  Extremely pleased and this recipe will go in my personal recipe collection to be used over and over again!

I made over Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit!  I made my own pie shells by cutting out the shapes with a biscuit cutter and putting these into a muffin pan.  I only had one type of corn syrup that  I used in this.  These were super yummy!

I made a whole pecan pie, instead of the mini pies. It was amazing! I usually don't rate recipes, but this one was phenomenal!

Made this instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, and served it with a scoop of pumpkin spice ice cream. Delicious!!!! I used the Never Fail II pie crust recipe which made it so easy to make in mini pans.

I did change a couple of things. I used a muffin tin and put in paper muffin cups. Put homemade crust in ,pressing against bottom and sides. Put in balled up aluminum foil and baked for a few minutes.
I didn't have enough syrup so I used what I had and finished off the amount needed using molasses.
They turned out great. They were loved by all more than Costco's pecan pie.
Too much work so will not make again unless I have premade  tart shells and bottle of syrup.

What a great idea for someone who has only one person that enjoys pecan pie and no other. My Step daughter was over joyed she could freeze the ones she did not eat.

These mini tarts were tasty. I used only light corn syrup as what I had on hand. I'll add some raisins next time. Thanks for recipe.

I used golden corn syrup (all I had in the house), and they turned out great.  They are a hit with the in-laws.  This recipe will be replacing all the others I had aside.

Won't make again. Filling was too sweet, even for someone who LOVES pecan pie. Also, it was runny when served, though I had cooked for 28 min. and let it cool thoroughly.

Also w/2 pie crusts I was able to make 12 tarts in regular size muffin tin + 6 in a “large” muffin tin. The large ones didn’t come out of the tin in one piece but the small ones did.
