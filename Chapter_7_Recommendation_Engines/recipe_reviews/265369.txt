We love this salad. I made it for a dinner party to go with my smoked ribs and everyone raved about the flavor. In the past 3 weeks I have made it 3 more times and my wife and I get into it all the time. It is one of our favorite dishes I make!

I also added cheese, black olives, hard boiled eggs and potatoes- couldn’t resist. I used more pickle juice in the dressing too. This recipe is a great base to add whatever you prefer in addition!

Well, it is ok. But the picture shows pimento stuffed olives and not dill pickles!

6.9.18  This is a nice pasta salad, the dill pickles are the star.   So many pasta salads taste too mayonnaise-y to me, but the addition of the red wine vinegar gives this some tang.  In the future, I’ll probably add a few chopped onions and cut back the basic salt, but increase the celery salt a bit, since that’s a nice flavor in this salad.  Garnished with some sliced olives for a little pop of color.  notimetocook, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it!
