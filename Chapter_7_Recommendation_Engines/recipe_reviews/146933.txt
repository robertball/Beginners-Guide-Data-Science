Yum! Weirdly, I had all of the ingredients for this except honeydew, so I used more cantelope. My peaches and strawberries were frozen. I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut, because that's what I had and its healthier anyway (this is plenty sweet without the added sugar). Next time I might leave it chunkier... Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was great! It paired well with a nice spinach and fruit salad. The nutmeg makes it feel more like a soup and less like a smoothie.

Wonderful way to get rid of excess fruit! Sometimes I buy too much and then have to figure out a way to use them up... I think, perhaps, I had too much of the melon fruits, because it came out just a tad liquidy. Taste, however, was excellent!

This is really good... if not a fan of the nutmeg...cut back the amount over all no complaints. This could become a staple dish for lunch for me. Great Gluten free dish and packed with wonderful fruit.

This was delicious. I was expecting it to have the consistency of a smoothie that you just ate with a spoon. Not so in this case. It was thick and delicious and you really taste the melon. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because of the nutmeg. I never remember the one spice it is that I hate until I taste it, and of course, it's nutmeg. I don't think I'll forget again. Next time I will omit it, but for those of you who have no problem with nutmeg, this will be a five star refreshing soup for you. Thanks for the great recipe.

this might as well be called melon soup, because that's all you can taste.  my only change was to sub coconut milk for the cream of coconut because that's all i could find.  i was very disappointed in the recipe -
