I usually make a double batch and freeze for a second meal, which might explain the "cut in thirds" and "use half" part that doesn't make sense. In a pinch, I also use canned French Onion soup and a Beefy Onion powdered soup mix instead of the beef broth and fresh onions. For less broth, you can drain the tomatoes first. The leftover meat, without the broth, became the filling in an experiment with homemade tamales one Christmas.

Very easy recipe to throw in the crock pot.  I think next time I will omt one can of tomatoes.  It had too much liquid for my liking.

I loved it!  My husband and kids said it was just okay. Ingredients list says cut flank steak into thirds, but in instructions it states to use half of steak.  No biggie, but it should be corrected. Served with white rice and black beans.

This is easy, but I only used one can of tomatoes and green chilies and added some green bell pepper and cilantro.  Even with these changes, it has a strong tomato flavor.  I'm not an authority on this dish, but I'm not sure I want more tomato flavor.  I think it works well with flour tortillas, maybe add some avocado slices or some sour cream.

Delicious.  I added red pepper flakes to give it more heat (I like food that requires a fire extinguisher be at the ready).

The beef seemed a little dry and bland, like meat boiled in making of a soup (I was hoping for something along juiciness of pulled barbecue).  I don't  know if that is  expected, never had a "professionally prepared" Ropa Vieja.
