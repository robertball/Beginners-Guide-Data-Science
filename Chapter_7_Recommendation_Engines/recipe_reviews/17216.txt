This is an awesome recipe.  We ate it for dinner two nights in a row, it was so good.
Having made this so many times, I've played with it a bit and here is how I make it now:
After preparing the beef/bean mixture and putting it into the bottom of the pan, I put on the olives, tomatoes, and cheese.  Then I bake it and put on the sour cream and green onions (subbed these for regular onion) when it comes out of the oven.  It is sooooooo much better that way.  The sour cream retains its creamy texture, and the green onions retain their bite.  If the sour cream is baked, it gets kind of curdled and we like it better the other way.  Very very good recipe!

Very good.  I left the onions out because my husband is not a onion eater and added sour cream after it had been cooked.  Next time I will try it as the recipe called for.

I love this version of layered dip.  It's definitely the best one around ... and I think I've made them all!  I use refried beans with sausage for extra flavor.

This is a fantastic dip recipe. Or should I say a good starting point?  Well, here's how I made it- I took the beef and bean mixture (to which I added the jalapenos) and spread it in the 9 x 13 pan and put the cheese on top of that and baked it. When it came out of the oven, I added the sour cream and all the fresh ingredients on top of that (after cooling for a bit).  The dip went fast!  To be honest, this didn't make nearly enough for the crowds we are used to.  Next time, I will probably triple. Thanks for the recipe!

We love Mexican and Tex-Mex foods and this is definately the best Taco dip that I have tried.  To eat right out of the oven I made it as directed, but to take to a party, I added the shredded cheese right before I left the house and covered the dish. It was just as yummy as if I had gotten it right out of the oven! And there were no leftovers, in fact there was good natured fighting on who got to scrape the dish clean!  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a big hit - no left overs.  If you have many people I suggest making two dishes, ours was gone so quick that many people didnt even get to try it.

I followed other reviewers advice and put the sour cream on after cooking. A good idea -- the cold sour cream was great on top. However, for the rest of the mix, I did some serious doctoring. The base recipe is bland, but I love the ingredients and will next time add a packet of hot taco seasoning to make it just right. I highly recommend this recipe as it can be easily suited to your tastes.

SOUR CREAM: TO BAKE OR NOT TO BAKE: I decided to make this instead of my standard mexican dips for a party since it's cold out and bc I wanted to try something new! After reading all the reviews I could not decide whether to bake the sour cream on the dip or 2 layer it after baking so I decided to make 2 smaller dips and taste both!! (plus I hate when people review a recipe after changing it!!!) The first I made almost exactly as stated (I spiced up the meat mixture some bc it wasn't quite spicy enough for us). I found layering cold sour cream onto the hot meat 2 be difficult. Next time i will sit the sc out &/or stir it while making the meat mixture. I did forget to put the jalapenos tomatoes and onions on b4 baking :( & wish i had done that. WIll next time. Result: Very good!! The other one I layerd the meat w/tomatoes green onions and cheese and baked it then topped it with sour cream mixed with taco seasoning (YUM) & more veggies. It wasn't as pretty but tasted even better to us!!!  My opinion is :  top the meat mixture with sour cream mixed with taco seasoning, layer jalapeno peppers (if you like spicy bc the over bring more heat out of the peppers) green onion and tomatoes, cheese then bake then top with more veggies (more jalapenos, tomatoes, green onions, olives etc) and serve with a side of salsa :) to sum it up.... Delicious dip whether the sour cream is baked or not and this dip will be put in rotation for mexican nights and parties! Thanks for reading my novel :)

I made it for a church gathering and it was a hit!  Gone in no time!  Someone was saying out loud "Who made the dip?"  Changed it a bit with what I had.  Used green taco sauce and green chilies, no jalapenos.  Cut down a little on all chopped ingredients.  I layered the dish and added the spices to the meat only.  Beans on bottom, than meat, etc.  Put a little can nacho cheese and shredded cheese on top.  When it came out of the oven it was piping hot and cheesy!

I made this dip for my wife's pot luck lunch for her work and she said it was all gone in less than 15 minutes. Only suggestion I have is not to put tomatoes and olives on till after it is cooked.

I have made this dip for every pot-luck & get together.  Everyone loves it.  I recently made it with TVP (textured vegetable protien) for my vegetarian friend & it was just as good.  My husband always loves the leftovers (although there rarely are!).

Tastes amazing but the sour cream curdles like cottage cheese so it doesn't look all that great. I used ground turkey and five of us ate this so fast. Next time I make it, and there definitely will be a next time, I plan on mixing the sour cream into the bean/meat misture before spreading into the pan to see if that helps the curdling.

Very good - even with fat free refried beans. By far my favorite taco or layered dip. I don't put the sour cream on until after the dip comes out of the oven to avoid curding. Def recommend trying this.

I made this for a bridal shower and it was by far the favorite dish!!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and topped it with a spicy peperjack cheese and left the jalepenos on the side. Absolutley delicious!!!

I serve this dip whenever I have company over.  I've also modified it with Morningstsar Farms 'ground beef' and vegetarian baked beans for my vegetarian friends.  Have also used 'fat free' ingredients but have found it to be runny and unattractive, but still tastes great.

This recipe is good cold not hot.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sour cream gets very funky when it is cooked.  It tastes good but looks disgusting.  However I add a layer of lettuce and serve the dip cold and it is wonderful.

Our family likes hot food but this was WAY TOO HOT for us. I reduced the serving size to 4 so maybe that had something to do with it. We probably won't try it again.
