The only thing I did differently was toast my pecans, and add a bit of orange zest, other than that followed recipe as written.  These were delicious, light and fluffy, with a wonderful flavor.  Will be making again for Christmas morning to go with our coffee!

Great scone recipe,  hubby and I went back for seconds. I used frozen cranberries instead of dried, walnuts instead of pecans as I had none, pastry flour as I am trying to use it up, and almond milk. I did need to add a splash of milk to get the dough to the consistency I wanted. We will be making this one again!

I added cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also added flaxseed, ground up, in place of 1/2 c flour.  Delicious!

Really yummy, great texture, easy to make and way too easy to eat! 
I made mine without berries & nuts, and they were terrific. Only (slight) change I made was to grate solid butter in rather than chopping it up, and I added some cinnamon in.
