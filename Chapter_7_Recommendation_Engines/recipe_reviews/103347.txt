New Mexico and California chilies work too. Look for LARGE dark red dried chilies **To save time, after roasting and cleaning the seeds out, lightly simmer the chilies for 20-30min in the broth. Once soft add the chilies and the broth you cooked them in to the blender and add 1/4-1/2 cup more broth to compensate for some cooking off. AllRecipes won't let me update the recipe to say this I'm sorry!! ****If you read the reviews you'll see those who stuck with the recipe as is gave it a high rating, those who tweaked it first with other options gave it a lower rating... My rule of thumb for ALL recipes is to try it how it's written first (unless I am simply SURE there is some ingredient I don't like). Once I try a recipe as written, then I will almost always tweak it the following times I make it. I don't think it's fair to change the recipe as written and then give it a poor review... Try my rule of thumb and make it 'as written' the first time before tweaking it, you will probably still tweak it to your liking, but probably in a totally different way than you expected.********

To the reviewer that had bitter sauce: that happens sometimes if the chilies get roasted too much, it only takes 30 seconds of over doing it to over roast the chilies. If you try again watch them VERY closely, they should just start to smell nice, the color really should not darken and if they look black at ALL then they are over roasted and will make a bad bitter sauce... done it too! Love, Christine

This sauce is easily the best I ever made.  I'm a Texan who unfortunately lives out of state and I CRAVE a real enchilada sauce- well this is it.  It's as good or better than any I ever had in Texas.  The description is accurate: smoky and savory... and I might add DELICIOUS!!!!!

I followed the directions exactly and this turned out really good.  I would recommend adding crushed red pepper before blending to add some heat to this as its very mild.

This is the BEST sauce we have tasted. My husband is half Mexican American and grew up eating authentic cuisine and he just raved. He is still raving this morning. I toasted my chilies in a dry cast iron skillet til they began smoking and slightly puffed. After cooling, I deseeded them and soaked them in simmering broth about 30 min. Then continued with the recipe. I only added salt at the end because broth contained salt. Served this with a side of corn with jalapenos, also from this site. That one is also 5 stars!! Thanks Christine. I have waited a long time for a recipe like this.

I tried the recipe as is and it was good, but very time consuming.  I decided to boil the chilies with a couple of jalapeños for about 25-30 mins.  Strained only the ancho chilies.  Then moved on to step 3.  Included the jalapeños and left out the tomato paste and did not add the broth until it was in the sauce pan.  I also used 1/2 a knorr caldo de pollo bullion cube with a cup of the water I used to boil the chilies.  Slowly added that to the sauce to make sure it did not come out too watery.  I only used about 1/2 of the broth. This saved a lot of time and still came out very tasty.

I LOVED this sauce...and I am Picky about my enchiladas (tend to prefer traditional sauce).  I couldn't find Ancho Chiles dried, so substituted dried California chiles.  I burned black the first batch, so put fewer in than called for (only 4).  I also added more tomato paste (my can was bigger).  My hubby said it was tangy (prob the extra paste) but liked it with sour creme on top.  At first I thought Oh-boy a whole hour to soak!  But, the time flew by as I was making the enchiladas, and the sauce was really quite easy.  Thanks so much!!!

I screwed it up.  I totally burnt the peppers while toasting them.  HAHAHA.  Watch the time!!!! Wah.  No more peppers on hand, but I really wanted the sauce so I just used a whole bunch of chili powder and a itty bit of paprika for a smoky flavor.  I'm still giving it five stars.  I can tell this recipe is awesome by the ingredients.  The only thing I was going to omit was the oregano because I didn't want even the slightest reminder of spaghetti sauce flavor but that's a matter of personal taste.  I soooo wish I didn't burn the anchos. My adjusted sauce was OK:  the chilis would have brought the sauce to perfection!  So thanks for putting me on the right track.  Next time!

Be very careful with those chiles.  I had to roast 12 in order to get the six I needed.  I had to substitute a different kind of dried chile, beef bouillon and water for the beef broth, and I only added 1 teaspoon of salt.  I don't like most red sauce because it's too salty.  I used the sauce to make Spinach Enchiladas on this site.  They were fabulous.

This is the real thing.  Very similar to a recipe I have been using for years.  You can roast the peppers in a little oil on the stove also, or even in a hot dry pan.  Your kitchen will smell very Mexican.  I have had enchiladas in restaurants done this way, but it was many years ago.

The first thing my daughter said was, "Why can't restaurants make enchilada sauce this tasty."  And I replied, "Score!"  Wonderfully smokey and full-bodied flavor without being too spicy for tender palates.  I was in a hurry and used fresh poblano peppers instead on rehydrating.  Roasted, peeled, seeded, chopped, then pureed according to instructions.  I'll definitely stock ancho chiles in my pantry for the next time the enchilada bug bites me.

Absolutely amazing!!! I've probably drank 1/2 c just tasting it. I will never buy canned sauce again. I didn't even attempt toasting the peppers, I used maybe 1/4-1/2 c ancho powder instead. I also added cayenne to taste. Next time I'll add another clove or two of garlic. You really should try this sauce!

Mmmmm...the best. Oh yeah. Not spicy at all but this had a nice flavor and it made enough to cover 2 9x13 pans of enchiladas. After eating this, I won't ever buy canned sauce again. My only addition was a tsp of sugar to cut the bitter from the peppers (my tweak). SO delicious, Thanks!!!

Wow... I really loved this and I made several substitutions based on what I had on hand but the recipe still stood up to my alterations. I didn't even add the garlic because I accidentally read over it and skipped it entirely. The garlic would be delicious though. Or even a whole head roasted and then pureed. I will certainly try different things. The first thing I'll try is the true way with the ancho chilies though! It seems great.  Instead I used one minced Chipotle Chili and some adobo sauce (like the combo comes in a can). Since chipotle chilies (smoked jalapenos) are 10 x as spicy as ancho (and 3 x as spicy as normal jalapenos) I only used one and it came out with some heat! I didn't have tomato paste I had a container of chopped tomatoes in juice so I pureed them til I had 2 c of liquidy tomato puree and added 1 cup of beef broth and 2 bullion cubes (to flavor the remaining 2 c of tomato liquid). I figured all that equaled 3c broth and tomato paste. I used less salt because of the bullion. I simmered mine until it was thickened to my liking. I also subbed 1 teaspoon marjoram instead of oregano and 1 pinch of oregano. I added a pinch of thyme (a nod to the chicken broth) and heaped my 1/4 teaspoon of cumin.   I served this smoky, rich sauce over potato and mixed vegetable filled enchiladas with sour cream on the side. They got rave reviews. I really can't wait to try this recipe again but I'm so happy it worked as a base for future times I won't want to roast peppers.

Everyone liked this enchilada sauce.  I used vegetable broth instead of beef, and I soaked the chiles in the broth for an hour then used that liquid in the recipe. I won't have to buy canned enchilada sauce anymore!

I can't wait to try your sauce recipe.  I grew up making this sauce with my mother and grandmother.  We didn't use an oven to toast we used a cast iron skillet/flat and to keep the sauce from having to much bitterness if you over-toast you change the water that you boiled the chili in and that will give you the great toasted flavor and not the bitterness of the burn.  Can't wait to try your sauce!!!

Amazing!!!  I have always been fairly satisfied with canned enchilada sauces but have longed for the more authentic sauces served in restaurants.  Snowed in, with a bit of time (and the ingredients) on my hands, I gave this recipe a shot today.  It was perfectly delicious!!!  Easy to prepare, simple ingredients, and it was a thing of beauty over a fresh batch of turkey enchiladas.    The only changes I made to the recipe was to go to more of a mole style sauce.  I added 3 dried cayenne (arbol) chiles to the anchos, and added a splash of cinnamon and 1 ounce of unsweetened mexican chocolate to the sauce as it was simmering.  Delicious!  You guys have got to try this one, you'll never dump a can again (or have enchiladas that taste like lasagne!).

This is a good sauce.  Because time was short, I didn't roast the chiles and just added some smoked paprika for the smoky flavor.  And I added a pinch of Mexican style hot chili powder, also, for a little punch of flavor.  I had to sub chicken stock for beef broth as I had none in the house, but it didn't seem to matter.  I served it over beef and onion enchiladas and when I ran out of room in the dish, I made some cheese ones and added the rest of the meat mixture to the leftover sauce and used that over the cheese ones.  They turned out to be our favorite!  This is much better than the canned sauce.

This is the best enchilada sauce I've come across.  Great consistency and taste.  I use it on tamales.

I've started substituting Guajillo chilis in place of the ancho and the flavor is even smokier and more complex.  If you try Guajillos, roast them for half the time as the anchos, as they are thinner and will burn otherwise.

Wanted to use up the rest of a smoked brisket that my hubby had made over the weekend.  This sauce made for the perfect enchiladas!  Complimented the smokiness of the meat wonderfully!  I've been making my own enchilada sauce since moving to South Florida.  Never thought about using dried chiles.  Thanks for the recipe Christine!

I made this recipe as is and it turned out AMAZING!  It was the best enchilada sauce I have ever had.  I used a food processor to puree the ingredients instead of a blender, but that was all I changed.  Thanks Christine for the awesome recipe!

Very very delicious...I bought a can of tomato sauce because I just knew this wasn't going to make enough sauce for my enchiladas....Boy was I wrong! Sooo good. I did end up using chicken broth instead of the beef, but I think next time I will use the beef. I literally could have drank this sauce! Very awesome recipe...thank you for sharing!

Excellent! I made the recipe as it was written.  Next time I might add one or two spicier chiles like chile de arbol, just for some variety.  Watch your chiles carefully while they are toasting because they will burn quickly.  This recipe was easy and I will never go back to canned enchilada sauce.

HOLY SMOKES!!!  This stuff is great!!  I used Dried California Chili Pods (because I decided at the store to make sauce and THEN searched for a recipe)  This stuff is the bomb...we want to drink it out of a glass.  I better hurry with the enchiladas or there will be no sauce left to make them!

This was very, very good! My sauce came out much darker than the photo, but I'm not sure that my dried chiles were anchos, and that's not a complaint in any event :) I used this on chicken enchiladas, and it was a hit! My brother in law even said it was better than my mother's, and she's an AMAZING cook who makes everything from scratch. No longer will I use nasty, sodium-filled canned sauce!

We couldn't find dried ancho chiles at our New England grocery store, so I used 3 tablespoons of Mexican chile powder and 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili powder instead. I also only used about half the amount of stock when reheating the sauce to thin it out. The results were fabulous--flavorful and spicy but not overwhelming--and I will definitely make this again. Variations could include cocoa powder and cinnamon. In fact I bet you could use this sauce as a good base for mole. Great recipe--thank you!

I took the suggestion to place the chiles in the beef broth to soften to save time. After that place the broth and chiles and add'l broth into the blender. Wowzers! I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. It is exactly as stated "smoky and savory". Will definitely use this again.

Having access to as much Mexican food as anyone could ever want here in southern California, I can say that this enchilada sauce is delicious.  Toasting the chiles adds a wonderful flavor (watch them carefully! they burn easily.) The balance and complexity of the sauce was excellent, and I know I'll make it again. Also, as another reviewer stated, it is also delicious with California chiles, if you can't locate ancho.   Well done, Christine!

Definitely an enchilada sauce worth the time. This doesn't require a whole lot of effort, but it does take time... that's OK though, just make it early in the day. 
Has a nice, smoky flavor from the dried peppers (which are usually smoked as well). 
As far as consistency, add the remaining 2 cups of beef broth a bit at a time after you put the pureed mixture into a sauce pan. I seemed happy with the thickness after using about 2 1/2 cups of beef broth overall.
I agree with reviewers who get upset with people rating a recipe after they have made their own changes to taste. That's not what this is at all! After saying that I did have to use peanut oil instead of corn oil, because I didn't have corn oil on hand and was too  lazy to go shopping. Other than that, stuck  to the posted recipe. 
I was worried that the skins would present a problem, but they blended up smooth with the rest of the ingredients.
A nice and mild, smoky sauce that will leave you putting the canned junk back on the shelf forever.

This was very good!  Thanks for a simple tasty recipe.  I did need to add a tiny bit of sugar at the end to help pull the "can" flavor out of the tomato paste, so I think next time I will cook the paste a bit before putting the rest of the ingredients into the sauce pan with it and then whisk it together.

Excellent sauce and very easy.  Only differences were that I used New Mexico chilis and didn't add as much beef broth as the recipe calls for since I thought at about 2 cups it looked thin enough.  I will never buy the canned stuff again.

I am from Las Cruces, New Mexico, 15 miles south of the Green/Red Chile capital of the world, Hatch, NM. This is a delicious recipe, tastes just like home! A few changes I used 5 medium sized fresh tomatoes from our organic garden. Also my partner is vegetarian so we used vegtable broth instead of chicken.

Christine, this was AMAZING!   I knew I was doing something right when the sweet lady at the Mexican Market asked what I was making with the chilis, and when I told her enchiladas, she smiled brightly and told me that was the best way to go.  I had a small dinner party so I made it ahead and refrigerated until I was ready to cook.  Doubled the recipe for 18 enchiladas and had enough to serve on the side.  Not a single drop left!    Thanks for the tips.  Was nervous about burning the chilis, but they were perfect.  Mine took 2-1/2 minutes.  Not sure why folks are concerned about  the oregano, I did exactly what you wrote and my folks raved as they gobbled!   I could hug you!!!!!!

Love this recipe.  TIP:  Find a produce/farmers market that roast chilies there on the spot while you wait (usually late summer).  You can buy 1/2 to a bushel of chilies and have them roasted for you.  Bring them home, let them cool, and bag up about 15 chilies, blackened skin and all, per quart freezer bag.  When you need some for a recipe then thaw a bag or two, then clean and de-seed them.  Roasted chilies goes great in so many dishes like this one.

loved this sauce. so easy. thick and rich, like a mole. for recipe consistency I just went with the whole 2 oz bag of ancho chili pods. I swapped olive oil for veg oil and used chicken broth. I toast my anchos stove top in a cast iron pan, that way I can keep a better eye on them, and I wasn't gonna heat up the whole oven for it to only be needed for a few minutes. I also seed and stem them before toasting when they are more pliable. I have tried New Mexico, ancho and guajillo chile pods. I like the guajillo flavor the best.

Really good! Followed directions exactly. Roasted chiles for only 2 minutes, as my oven runs hot. Used in enchiladas made with carnitas. Very delicious. Can use a generous amount of this sauce on your enchiladas, there is no "too much"! :)

This sauce is great!  I didn't have ancho chiles in my grocery store, so I used dried New Mexico chilies.  I think any large red chile would work!  It turned out great!  Not as much work as other enchilada sauce recipes I've tried but just as good or better!  Love it with the cottage cheese enchiladas from this site.

This is great, but I cheated.  I had Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning from this site already prepared.  It has chile powder, garlic, cumin, oregano,  and salt in it.  I just subbed that instead of bothering with the fresh chiles and other spices.  Turned out wonderful and a heck of a lot easier.

I didn't have dried ancho chilies, so roasted some fresh red ones I had on hand. Otherwise, followed the recipe as is.  The result was - for my taste - a bit salty, too hot, and a bit too runny, but that could be fixed by simmering longer.  The spiciness may have been because of my pepper substitution. In spite of this, I was pretty pleased with the result as it is definitely on the right track toward what I'm looking for and I base my rating on this. I'm guessing that the right peppers give it not only heat but flavor as well. The chilies I used had no flavor - just heat!  Later, I made some modifications on this recipe: added 1/2 TBSP cocoa powder, a medium pureed onion (since I had no onion powder), and 2 TBSP flour to thicken it some. I'm even happier with the results now and will continue making this with these additions.

I've been looking for a good enchilada sauce recipe ever since I moved from Texas to Germany 3 years ago, and this is it. Thanks, Christine! I used flour tortillas, since corn tortillas are impossible to find here, and used a mixture of Monterey jack and mild cheddar. Before rolling, I dipped each tortilla in the sauce on both sides, and drizzled more sauce and cheese on top after filling. They tasted just like the cheese enchiladas at my favorite Mexican place back home. I'll never buy canned enchilada sauce again! This was delicious and SO easy.

Definitely a 5 star rating in my book!  This red sauce was so incredibly good and really I thought it was quite simple!  I won't make enchiladas without this sauce ever again!

This really is the best enchilada sauce I have ever tried.  It's easy and I have also used Anaheim chiles too.  Way better than canned.

I followed Christine's recipe EXACTLY and it turned out great!! I didn't take any short cuts, followed all the measurements and my enchiladas were delicious. The sauce is smoky, flavorful, and not too spicy. I'm so glad I tried this out! It's a permanent addition to my rotation!

I normally don't care for red enchilada sauce, and favor green instead. But this sauce is really great! I LOVED how this recipe wasn't tomato heavy! The beef broth works perfectly with all the chili flavors, and the seasoning is spot-on!

After reading some of the reviews I got scared of burning the peppers, so i toasted them @350 for 3 min. I noticed that they darkened up a little bit, but definitely didn't turn black. Might be hard to tell if you burned them because the ancho chilies are already super dark, almost black already. 

I used 1 huge ancho, and 5 california chilies. Instead of covering the chilies with water, I used 2 cups of beef broth, and simmered them for 20-30 min. They really soaked up a lot of liquid, so I ended up still adding 2 more cups of broth. So total I used 4 cups broth, which happens to be an entire carton of beef broth. (perfect!) Once I got to blending everything, I also added one chipotle chili with a bit of adobo (from a can.) I didn't to that for heat, just to diversify the chili flavors. 

I added a little bit (1/4 cup) of caramelized onions to the blender, not that the recipe needed it. I just happen to be obsessed with onions, and can't seem to eat a meal without them.

This stuff is delicious and super fast and easy to make, not to mention very inexpensive. Like others I heat up a cast iron skillet over medium heat and lay the chiles in there for just a few minutes. They'll get toasty and soft, making it easy to remove the stems and seeds. They don't need to soften for an hour - maybe 15 minutes in the boiling water. Throw everything in the blender and POOF! Excellent red sauce you can make your own with any number of changes or additions. I just made an enchilada casserole that's in the oven now and I can tell you this sauce will be a staple here. Thanks Christine for a most excellent recipe!

Actually got the sauce all made and totally forgot the oil.  I think it will be fine without it.  It tasted great after it had cooked.  Going to use it in the cottage cheese chicken enchiladas on this website.  It is better than an enchilada sauce that I usually use off of eatingwell.com website.  I will be switching to this recipe from now on when I need red enchilada sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Don't use canned red enchilada sauce, make this instead!!!

I couldn't find ancho chiles so i used 6 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce added 2 tbl spoons of diced jalapanos and pureed them together.  I didn't use oregano but instead added crushed red pepper , chipotle chilli powder, chipotle chili flakes and anco chile pepper powder.  this gave the receipe a nice warm heat.  My family LOVED it!  I also did not put the oil in the recipe as didn't add anything but fat.  One last thing we were makeing chicken enchilada so i used chichen broth instead of beef.

Good recipe for the most part- I've found that all Ancho chiles, though I love them, makes for a bitter sauce- I use 2 oz. chiles, (1 Ancho and the rest red chiles such as California, New Mexico, or Guajillo) to 2 cups liquid (I use water with a bit of sherry or vinegar).  I also like some aromatics (onion and celery, sauteed) and definitely no tomato.  Kudos for not using starch to thicken- a common and counterproductive addition.

Terrific!  Doubled it and made 50 chicken enchiladas for a dinner co-op.  (5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thights). I used chicken broth rather than beef, and used about 3/4 c. less than recipe called for because the consistency was lovely; I hated to make it watery.  After cooking them, though, would have included all broth so i had more to pour over just before cooking.

This turned out pretty well... my store didn't have ancho chilies so I used Japanese chilies instead and I only used 4 because I was afraid it would be too spicy for my 2 and 4 year old.  I will definitely use this again! ;)

Very good.  Hubby said the enchiladas were my best ever.  I did use fresh, and not dried, peppers then roasted them myself.  The sauce wasn't spicy at all, so next time I'll kick it up a notch.  Just our preferance.  I had never used these peppers before, so I erred on the side of caution:)  It was a lot of work for just the sauce, but well worth it.  Thank you for sharing Christine!

Nice fresh taste. I messed mine up, halving the recipe but using 4 chiles instead of 3 (oops)!! After doctoring it up, it was great! I used fresh onion instead of the powder, and water instead of broth (didn't have).

I have made this twice and both times it was fantastic! I followed the recipe to a 'T' the first time and it looked red and beautiful!....I baked the sauce for enchiladas and it came out black but tasted heavenly! Whatever.  Live and learn. I heard that is what happens when you bake the sauce.  I made it again with different peppers ( ancho {  which are dried poblano I believe}  from the Mexican market the first time.... this time from another market,  they were slender and red, I'm thinking  dried serrano?) I did simmer them (lightly...) roasted peppers in veg broth (just making vegie enchiladas tonight) for about 20 min...then cooled for 20 before adding everything to the blender.  The sauce is once again, red and beautiful and tastes like an Angel kissed me. It is not spicy like the canned stuff, but thick bodied and bold. I will never go canned again, I don't care how  long it takes to make

Cannot wait to make it again! (But it will be a while because this made enough for 3 servings, I froze a couple bags for later use.)  I just made mole so I had some other chilies on hand and added a couple pasila peppers and a brown chipotle. 1/4 a cup of oil seemed a little heavy so I reduced it to 2 tablespoons. I really don't know that it needs the oil at all and am going to omit it entirely my next batch. After it simmered, I decided to add another 1/4 tsp of cumin and it really made it that much better. I'll never buy this out of a can again! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. As a native Texan living outside the country (USA not Texas ??)  this recipe was a godsend. I roasted dry red chilis in a medium hot dry pan until they released a nice aroma. Used chicken broth instead of beef with no issues. I like heat so I used extra peppers.

Delicious, authentic, healthy. I made as written, except, I used a vegan mock-beef broth that has a bit much salt, so I omitted the salt. I omitted the oil also, making this a very low calorie sauce.  
*tip: - I bought a big bag of dried ancho peppers at walmart, on an endcap in the produce section. They are not spicy, so if you desire heat, you'll need to add it.

The flavor was really good.  Thank you.  We added a can of tomato sauce to kind of round it out a little.  There was a nice balance of bitterness, smokey flavor, and salt.  The tomato sauce gave it a little sweet and tart.  We put it on spinach cheese enchiladas.  Yum!

Anytime I see someone use dried chilis in a recipe I know it is going to be more Mexican and less "Taco Bell". Authentic Mexican food is not sweet, and usually has more chilis and less tomato than Americans would think. I think this is a nice enchilada sauce. The dried anchos are integral. If you can't find a Mexican tiendita or a food store that sells them, it might be worth it to purchase them on line. They are dried, and last almost indefinitely in a sealed storage bag. Buen provecho!

I made this and followed the recipe exactly. It was too thin, too smoky, a little too hot, and I didn't care for the flavor. What went wrong? I just want a simple restaurant style red enchilada sauce, no weird flavors.

This sauce is awesome! I did not have ancho chilis, so I used a mixture of guajillo and chipotle chilis. Also did not have tomato paste, so I used a can of tomato sauce.  It is so good that we were dipping chips into the pan of sauce. We had about a cup leftover after making our enchiladas and decided to turn the leftovers into a salsa. I did burn my first batch of chilis and had to throw them out. They roast very quickly. This recipe has been added to our list of favorites

this is an easy, excellent enchilada sauce. i only had safflower oil on hand, and i used the simmer-in-broth-instead-of-soak-for-an-hour shortcut, and i threw all the beef broth in at once stick-blended it on the stove, and it came out juuuusssst fine on top of enchiladas made with leftover turkey and squash.

i followed the recipe exactly and its just gross... i think the beef broth overwhelms the flavor and the oregano does also.... now im trying to add things to make it at least somewhat taste like enchiladas for dinner...

This was so much better than canned sauces. Instead of steeping in hot water after roasting, I put the roasted and cleaned chilies in a pan with the rest of the ingredients and simmered for 1 hour. I added more broth to compensate for evaporation.  When done, I just took my hand held immersion blender and blended it though.  Everyone (even my picky kids) loved it.

I followed the toasting of the ancho chilis meticulously after reading about several others' burned pepper experience. That being said, this recipe was a huge disappointment. I had to massage the recipe every step of the way to make it palatable. From altering the salt (needed more than recipe called for) to sweetening it due to the bitterness of the chilis. It was a lot of work and I ended up thankful for my chopped cilantro, green onions, sour cream, cheddar cheese. There was little smoky, savory flavor from the dried anchos and I bought them from a highly reputable spice company. No, this sauce was too much effort for the result.

Good, not great.  Certainly not the best.  My first attempt at this recipe turned into a bitter mess that couldn't be rescued. The sauce tasted as bitter as non-chewable vitamin C tablets.  So I then did a little research to find that I likely burned the anchos.  I can't imagine toasting them for 3-4 minutes at 400 will do anything other than burn them up.  I took a second go at this recipe, this time toasting the anchos at 300 for 2 minutes and avoided any chance of burnage.  Then it turned out fine.

Ancho, Anaheim or Pacilla's.....basically the same chili. Very mild. I'm a lightweight with the heat and love Pacillas. Nice flavor and no heat. So, if a recipe calls for Ancho or Anaheim look for a Pacilla....vise versa. They are the same chili used for Chili Rellanos in Mexican Restaurants. Oh, can't wait to try this recipe. Sounds exactly like what I'm looking for!

This sauce is delicious!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is a bit time consuming.  I as intimidated by the chilis since I hadn't worked with them before, but stripping them of the seeds was easy.  toasting, easy, of course the soaking easy.  The blender works great to break them up and I love love the smokiness roasting the chilis gives to the sauce.  I will definitely make again!

This sauce was very good!  I made the recipe as stated, and it produced a dark, deep, smoky flavored enchilada sauce that was very delicious.  However, I like my enchilada sauce to be a little more "bright" in flavor.  Next time, I will use chicken broth instead of beef broth, which I think will produce the 5 star sauce I am looking for!

I hate it when people change recipes then rate them but I sent my son to the store for ancho chilies and he came home with a huge jalopeno pepper and 2 large red bell peppers.  I threw them in the oven at 400 to blacken, stuck them in a plastic bag to loosen the skins and then proceeded with the recipe.  I did add some cayenne pepper and a bit more cumin in an attempt to compensate.  I put the sauce on Chicken Enchiladas I from this site and they were awsome.  I have had to order anchos from the internet - Spice Inc - and can't wait to actually follow the recipe.  As good as it was with my forced substitutions, I can't wait to make this with the anchos.  I'll keep you posted.
Update July 28, 2010: Followed directions exactly and ended up throwing it out.  Maybe because I toasted the chilis the day before for 3 minutes, soaked them and put them in a plastic bag until I was ready to make the next day.  Never again.

Tastes a lot better than canned!  my store didn't have anchos so I used guajillos.  I reduced the salt by 1/3 and only had 1/2 can tomato paste at hand, and the sauce came out very tasty all the same.

Pretty awesome! Made something similar before but it didn't turn out as good. Only used two chilies because I didn't have any more. Didn't have any corn oil either. Used some homemade chicken broth instead of beef broth and it tastes great!

This was my first time making Enchilada Sauce; I had a can in the pantry just in case this didn't work out.  Um, I had to resort to the can.  I'm going to try to make one more time, with fresh ancho chiles when we get some...will update review.

This was a great basic recipe that I changed just a bit.  
I like the flavor of the Sofrito Tomato base, so I added 6 ounces of it and used fresh oregano since I have tons of it in the garden.  
And I used 3 Guajillo dried peppers, 3 dried Anchos, and 4 dried chipolte peppers.  All of these are used in our Pasole Soup that we love...........  Very good!

I really hope my review shows up. WOW! So delicious! I only had the New Mexico pepper (thank God I had something). Was planning on freezer food prep and needed enchilada sauce. I followed exactly, except having different peppers. Soooo. Goooood! Thank you!

This enchilada sauce recipe is the perfect enchilada flavor. I was short on time so I boiled the chilis for 5-10 minutes and tossed them in the blender with the rest of the ingredients. I feel like there was no difference in the flavor or texture. Thanks for sharing this recipe, definitely my new go to for enchilada sauce.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using 7 Pasilla Chili Pods since it was all I had. This turned out quite well. I also simmered the chilis for 30 minutes in vegetable broth since it was all I had on hand. After the blend, I simmered it for about 15 minutes and it was delicious. Better than sauces made with spices alone.

My Mexican mother in law never roasted the chilis, she cooked them in the broth until they were soft (she taught me this method for pesole).  She then took out the seeds and pulp and whirred the peppers in the blender with the stock.  After that, she strained it to get out the skins.  It works really well and reduces the bitterness.  It is also not that time consuming.

That being said, I did roast the chilis for a few minutes, and I liked the boost of flavor that the roasting provided.  I also rubbed just a bit of olive oil on the chilis prior to roasting.  Loved the hint from another cook to heat the chilis on the stovetop instead, I might try that next time.

I thought that the salt was just right, I don't tend to use too much salt.  The only other thing I added was a bit of dried basil and a little minced onion (personal preference).  I would have given this five stars, but I thought that the method of preparing the chilis was off just a little.  I'd really say 4.5 stars.

I wanted to add, I really love the opportunity to look at these recipes and then experiment based on others' experience and my family's preferences.  We all have different tastes!

Thanks for the recipe!  It is a good one.

The amount of time to "toast" peppers is too long. They will develop a acrid taste as mine did after 3.5 minutes. Only heat about 30 sec then turn and 30 more seconds. Tried to fix acrid taste w/baking soda, sugar, lime worked best.

9.4.18... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/103347/the-best-red-enchilada-sauce/ ... Minimal changes, not enough to make a big difference in the outcome.  I used 6T ancho chili pepper powder for the dried & one cup of the beef broth was actually water.  It did the job for sauce, but didn't wow us

Hi Christine! Your sauce is lovely though I never use recipes other than as guidelines. Two largely ignored secrets of nearly every savoury Mexican sauce I make are cumin (which I use much more of) and the truly obscure and astounding addition  of ground clove - maybe more than a tablsp or so. Then I use (or overuse) much more garlic, oregano, chile (the sweet sort; don't want to cause riots among non-Mexican taste buds, do we?) and slightly less oil. Grind your dry spices in a small coffee grinder and you approach Montezuman stature! As to roasted peppers, you can achieve the same results by drying out some of the varieties that come in jars and dry pan-roasting them until they are brittle. Then into your handy-dandy grinder they go! With love of food, David Peevers

I followed the exact recipe and my honest opinion would be it taste more as a pasta sauce than an enchilada sauce, I would personally add half of a garlic clove, and maybe less tomato sauce. My very first thought after tasting this sauce was a more Mexican style tasting Prego but regardless it was still good but nothing I would make for enchiladas

I made this recipe as directed. We loved it! I used it to make shredded beef enchiladas, so I used the broth from the roast. It was full of flavor!

I love this recipe. I am a wimp though so only used half the amount of dried peppers. I will make this again and again. I will never buy it from a can anymore. Thank you.

This was a very good red enchilada sauce and I will be keeping it for future use. It is a mild sauce and a bit smoky in flavor. A must try and it was very simple to put together.

Yes, this is a good recipe for enchiladas, in fact it seems more like a mole because it is thick and rich.  I have made this twice.  The first was as written the second using crushed tomatoes in an attempt to get more of a red chili sauce versus a dark, rich mole-like sauce.  I haven 't figured it out yet, perhaps fewer peppers and less oil.  Thanks for a simple and tasty sauce, it's given me a base from which to work.

All I can say is WOW!!! This is not a hard recipe at all. I think people get afraid of roasting the peppers fearing they will ruin the sauce. Follow the recipe exactly and take the chilies off your cooking sheet straight from the oven so they don"t continue to cook. The only 2 changes I made(personal preference) was to reduce the oil to 2 tablespoons and added 1 teaspoon sugar to offset the acidity from the tomatoes.  This is excellent sauce. try it....you won't buy the canned  again. Oh, Walmart sells the chilies bulk in the produce dept. Enjoy!!

I made a mistake by adding 1/4 cup extra of corn oil after simmering in broth instead of beef broth. I added 1/2 cup extra broth to fix my mistake and it tastes great!  Will only use this recipe & no more store bought cans!  Thank you for sharing!!!

Amazing! I'm from southern Arizona and this recipe is very very good. I presonally prefer to use New Mexico Red chiles. It's just the flavor more common in this part of the world. Roasting the chiles releases flavor and adds a hint of smoky to them. Please follow recipe exactly.

I did not change this recipe. I only went a little light on cumin, personal preference, I did want to reference that I did skim the top during cooking of most of the fat and other (stuff), I think maybe that was why the one reader said that the skin tasted bitter.  However, after cooking 50 years this by far is  the best enchilada sauce I have had or prepared, and SO simple if you follow recipe. Who cares if you have to wait an hour for chilies to moisten. Make it early or have another mojito! This is great stuff, if you don't make it, your missing out.

I'm not a huge fan of having tomato paste in my enchilada sauce but this turned out better than expected.  I didn't have time to roast the chilis so i used 2.5 T of ancho chili powder which seemed to be about the right taste.  Other than that i followed the recipe and the resulting sauce was a little more acidic than I prefer so i added about 15 semi sweet chocolate chips to the sauce which were a nice add.

Finally found the chilies,  (at WallyWorld of all places).  I followed this recipe except did not add oil.  I cooked it like Pati Jinich shared on her tv show...... Pour the blended chili mixture into a deep pot in which the oil is heated.  Be careful, the oil goes crazy but stir fast and cook until the desired thickness.

I've made this a few times now and my spoiled So Cal family loves this recipe. You absolutely cannot over roast the chilis!  Stop when they become fragrant and a bit soft otherwise you'll have bitter sauce. I've started improvising and found that a small amount of cinnamon (1/4 t) and sugar (2 t) as well as a bit more salt are great additions. I also strain and reduce the sauce after. Excellent recipe.

Fantastic!  I didn't bother with the chilies, just used Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning and New Mexico chili powder and it was most excellent!!!!! Used it on the butternut squash and black bean enchiladas, also on this site, to which I added shredded chicken thighs. :D

Sorry - I had to modify it at the outset for some vegan/vegetarian family members.
Instead of beef broth, I made a simple vegetable broth by simmering 4 C water with 1/2 tsp salt, a carrot, a quartered onion, and a stick of celery. I let it simmer until the peppers were done soaking, and then used 3 cups of the broth.
I also prepared the soaked chilies by processing them with a little of the broth in my processor with an 's' blade, since my blender isn't that great. This makes a beautiful, smooth, delicious paste of the peppers that had me salivating well before my enchiladas were done!
Other than not using the beef broth, I really made it as written, and it was superb. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Have made this as is. Sad I need to specify that. It is a 5 star on it’s own. It is also a 5 star for a base recipe to adjust. It can also be altered in preparation and stay pretty true to the main recipe. But anyone who cooks knows changing the tiniest thing really does alter the taste of the final product. Stick to this and you will be thrilled with the outcome! Or adjust it some!

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could. Easily the best I've had, homemade or restaurant. I made it just as written except I used chicken broth instead of beef because I made it for chicken enchiladas. (Well, and I only had chicken broth on hand.) I've been cooking for 40+ years and it's a wonder I got through without "improving" it like I usually do with recipes, but I'm really glad I did.  But ... I ended up with a couple of cups of leftover soaking water from the chilies which was rich with flavor, color and spiciness.  Not sure if I was supposed to have blended it in with the other ingredients. I'm saving it to use somewhere else, but I'm thinking that next time I'll do the soaking in hot broth instead and just incorporate it into the sauce.

Absolutely the best ever!! This recipe produces the BEST OF THE BEST TASTING ENCHILADA SAUCE IN THE WORLD!!!  I even make some to use as a dipping sauce for chips.  Also works great as a sauce on tacos, burritos, tostadas. and other Mexican dishes.  Folks, once you try this recipe, you will NEVER use any other !

I followed the recipe as written. It was okay, the consistency was good, the flavor was a little bitter. I might try it again, using chicken broth instead of beef broth, to get a little sweeter flavor.

I really wanted to like this, but found it too spicy with 6 chiles (and I like spicy food).  If I were to make it again, I would use less ancho chiles.

This is delicious. I didn't have tomato paste so I had to use tomato sauce. It really turned out beautifully. The Ancho Chilis did make it a little bitter, I am not sure if I didn't roast long enough but it gives it a rather authentic taste.  I did have to add a little extra salt and sugar to take the bitterness out but I will definitely make again.

I made this exactly how it said and it was bitter!! I watched my chilis in the oven very carefully then simmered for 20 min.  with broth. I'm thinking maybe this happen because a few seeds got left or maybe while simmering it got to hot? I'm not sure. I added a little sugar at the end to try and save it . It helped but can still taste a slight bitter taste. Really bummed

This recipe is the BEST!!! I have tried others and they didn't come close. Even though I didn't have the Ancho peppers on hand the first time I used dried serranos 3 small ones. Did not "roast them" but all else followed using home made beef stock. The deep red color and the awesome flavors were great! We used it for dipping chips too! I am thinking of canning some for holiday gifting!! that's how good it is...hope to never buy a can ever again!

Wonderful flavor.  I added 1/4 tsp of cocoa powder just because I've heard about adding chocolate to Mexican dishes.  Not sure it really made any difference.  Made a big enough batch to cover the Enchilada Quinoa Black Bean Casserole and still have plenty left over to make enchiladas next weekend.

I made this a vegetarian recipe by replacing the beef broth with an equal amount of water and a vegetable bouillion cube.  Great enchilada sauce.  After you have this, it is hard to imagine how you ever ate the canned stuff,  or could again...

I made this last night! It was so easy and so flavorful. I've roasted dried chilies before so I knew to watch them carefully. If you over-roast the skin will become crispy and bitter, which will translate to the finished sauce. I actually roast the chilies in my toaster oven on 300 degrees, turning frequently. This does a good job softening up the chilies and they puff up and become fragrant. 

Changes: I added a cup of hot broth to the soaking liquid and used the soaking liquid to puree the chilies and other ingredients. I used olive oil instead of corn oil. Not sure how it changed the flavor since I didn't do a side-by-side comparison, but my husband really liked the sauce so yay for me. I like my red sauce a little spicy and knew that the ancho chilies I used were very mild, so I used some red pepper flakes in the puree to kick it up a notch. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic. It has so much flavor and isn't spicy at all. I simmered the peppers in 1 can of low sodium beef broth instead of soaking them. I also cut down the salt and only used 1 tsp. It's a great recipe and an easy one to make adjustments to each individuals taste. It's a great recipe and super easy. Thanks Christine for sharing!

This was SO easy to make and to see it all come together was beautiful. My husband and I were not quite sure if we would like it because the ancho chiles don't smell the best when working with them but it turned out awesome! The color is a beautiful bold red and the flavors all come together so well. I don't normally keep "corn oil" on hand, but we went out to get the ancho chiles so I bought some corn oil at the same time. I think it would have been fine to use a different oil, however the corn oil definitely adds to the recipe! I also got three "cans" worth out of the recipe, so I now have enough for a later time! Thank you for sharing!

This is the best enchilada sauce I have ever tasted, from a restaurant or canned. Many people are unhappy with the one hour soaking time but my friend and I used that time to make chili rellenos and margaritas! I am so thrilled to never have to buy a can of unsatisfying sauce again. THANK YOU!

Okay Im from Texas also and its truly hard to find good enchiladas consistently. I can say absolutely that this sauce ROCKS!  I even bought the old (in the bag ) fiesta brand anchos from the hispanic food aisle. I did add crushed red pepper but then added a little buttermilk to smooth out the heat. Love it!!

So, So, So, So good.  I made cheese enchiladas with half of this and the other half went into a tortilla soup that called for a can of enchilada sauce.  I just couldn't stand putting canned sauce in my soup.  This worked great and gave it just the right amount of spice.

I didn't really care for this. It was way too thick and had a bitter taste. I use the same chiles for Mrs Espy's and it isn't bitter. I think I'll stick with her's.

Using roasted garlic and carmelized onions make this recipe absolutelly delicious. While I have an affection for ancho chiles, I found that dried jalepenos were equally sufficient to complete the flavor. Using rendered fat is a great way to add some robust flavors. The base recipe is awesome, but I would recommend adding a personal touch.
