The water is kinda off, place enough water in pot to cover ingredients. Also, I only add a couple of palms full of macaroni noodles because I like it a little on the thin side as opposed to thick stew style. With all those wonderful ingredients it will still be stewish, which I love. Great recipe though. I personally do not add cabbage, but read that is the actual portuguese style.  Here in the islands, I have eaten it many ways, with macaroni and cabbage, without macaroni and only cabbage, without cabbage and only pasta, but the basics are always in the pot and its always, onolicious!!!!  Enjoy

Yay! I was looking for a good portuguese bean soup recipe to remind me of home (Hawaii) and this one is excellent!  Really simple and perfect for colder weather.  Love it!

I loved this soup and so did everyone else who tried it. 

The only thing i couldn't understand was the water quantity "2 quarts wasn't enough". It even sounds ridiculous when considering all of the ingredients. I cut down on some of the ingredients and still needed about 4 quarts of water. I would have given it 5 stars if the water quantity wasn't so far off.

Too much macaroni.  I had to add another can of tomato sauce and another quart of water and it definitely is missing some type of flavor, but I can't pinpoint it.  My son added salt for taste because it was bland.  Will try it again with my adjustments

I too am searching for the perfect portagee bean soup as a taste of Hawai'i nei.  This is close. but not quite.  It is missing a middle maybe a green note...
I used regular not spicy sausage and 4 potatoes rather than 3. I also added an extra pint of water. Perhaps I added too much cabbage, a whole medium rather than a whole smal.l.. but needs garlic and salt and .... something that i havn't put my finger on. I added bay leaf.. perhaps a middle green, like oregano, or tarragon... but....  still havn't quite figured it out.

I will make it again, but I am still searching...

I used chicken stock instead of water, 1/2 lb of pasta, and chopped up a big bunch of kale and threw it in. 

Great recipe!!!

Left out potatoes because I like to serve it over rice. Added: 1 cup red wine, 1&1/2 cups stewed tomatoes, 2 cups pork stock from parboiling 1 lb. Pork loin, and the 1 lb. Pork loin.

This was delicious. Needed add more water and the pasta amount was a little too much. It ended up being a lot of soup, which lasted awhile. But overall it was good, I would make this again.
