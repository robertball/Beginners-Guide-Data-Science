I liked it, and will definitely give it a second chance, since I think I goofed it up by using a suuuper salty chicken boullion (didn't have chicken broth) and too much curry powder (didn't have curry paste).  This recipe has TONS of potential-- Loved the curry/cinnamon/apple mix.  Non fat Greek yogurt added a perfect consistency without the fat.  Plan on making it again soon and KNOW it'll be at/near a five star meal!!

I liked this but the taste was delicate, could use more spices and a little less yogurt.  Also, would be better if the chicken had more of a stewed texture and fell apart more, instead of in the browned slices.  Maybe could cook a little longer in the broth next time.  Will make again with a few changes.

Very bland dish...I will give it one more try using more of the red curry paste and perhaps more red pepper too.

I thought this was great! I used fat-free greek yogurt. I also used madras curry powder because Indian-style curry paste isn't sold in our grocery store (although Thai-style is). The flavors all worked really well together, and the apples were a nice variation. Even my three-year-old liked it. The one suggestion I have is to add the broth and simmer, then remove from the heat before adding the yogurt. Yogurt curdles when it's heated; still tastes fine, just looks sort of unappetizing. Other than that, this is easy, delicious, and healthy; we'll have it again! Thanks!

I have not cooked a lot of Indian dishes so I used this as a guide and used the ingredients I had, and improvised.  Instead of chicken I used a can of chick peas; I substituted a sliced carrot for one of the apples; I did not have a pepper so instead used 6 sliced radishes; and I added a clove of garlic, and more red curry paste. It worked so well that my partner said it tasted better than some restaurant dishes.
