Surprizingly good--even my husband, who is a french onion soup snob, liked it. I was surprized that a french onion soup could be this good from a crockpot. I used a quality brand beef stock, I added some fresh ground pepper when I sauteed the onions/garlic and I made my own homemade croutons. Next time, I think I would use all sweets and maybe add one more onion but that's honestly a personal preferance, not a reflection of the recipe. I'd make this again.

This was tasty! It was definitely easier than making onion soup the traditional way...I did feel that it was a bit on the thin side, though. I only used sweet onion and more than called for. The flavor was nice! This won't replace my usual onion soup recipe, but for quickness and ease, this was great! I may even try to use this method w/ my usual recipe, b/c the concept is just great.  I made my own 'croutons', using sliced baguette that I toasted on each side and then rubbed w/ a clove of fresh garlic, and I used swiss just b/c that's what I always use when I make onion soup. All in all this was good and I would def make it again, with a few minor adjustments! Thanks for sharing. :)

I cooked this on low 8 hours over night, prep it & put it in the crock pot before I went to sleep. Just woke up to this & had to try it. More salt! I added 1/2 a tsp & it still needs more. I skipped the brandy & did 3 tbs of beef stock & it worked out perfect cause that's exactly what I had left of it. My husband wont even let me cook with alcohol pregnant, Ive explained to him it evaporates, still big no. It tastes a lot better with the croutons & cheese, it has a better flavor I think from the seasoning on the croutons. I didnt do the oven safe bowl & all that I just put it in the microwave for 1 serving for myself. Im going to see how this freezes, keeping the croutons & cheese seperate untill re-warming it. Its good, Im eating it as I write this. Definately not the onion soup from Mimi's cafe but still yummy. If I make this again I will use baugette as apposed to crouton & season the soup up a bit with some herbs.

I had this for lunch today.  We had made it a few weeks ago and froze it (cheese, croutons, soup).  Had I known it would be this amazing, I would have had some way before today!! LOL.... The best Onion Soup I ever had in my life (and I've had/made quite a few).  Enjoy!!

I followed recipe exactly except with the brandy. I used lemon juice and cider vinegar in place of. Overall it was good, I tad too sweet for me, I think I’d almost skip the cigar vinegar or even the soy sauce. I’d make again!

My whole family absolutely loved this!! Made exactly as the recipe suggested but left out the brandy simply because I didn't have it in the house. Even my grand-kids loved it and they are pretty fussy eaters! Will definitely be making this again!!

This was my first attempt at onion soup.  I must say, I was very impressed!  It's delicious!  Only things I did differently was add a can of beef consumme, and cook it on low for 8 hours.  I wouldn't recommend that if you only made the three serving recipe.  I doubled it.  The liquid reduced quite a bit while cooking.  I also did not add salt or pepper.  The soup is salty enough on it's own.  This was a big hit at my house.  I will make this again for sure… and often!

I altered it to make it vegetarian so instead of beef broth, I used vegetable broth. I also added green onions to the recipe. This was so good. I will make it again.

Easy and delicious. I have made this several times.  I have made it with both croutons and French bread, and surprisingly I prefer the croutons for the extra seasoning.
