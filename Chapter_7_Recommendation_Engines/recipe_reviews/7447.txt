I just made it. I replaced shortenning with applesauce to make the recipe fat free. And instead of orange juice added the juice from the peaches can. IT IS GREAT. Thanks.

I read through all of the reviews first, and let me just say that: I used regular all-purpose flour, omitted the cherries, used the canned peach juice instead of orange, skipped the zest altogether and replaced shortening with 1/3c applesauce. [I have never used applesauce as a replacement in baking, this was my first attempt, and the cake came out delicious.] Also, I do not have a round dish of any sort so I used what I believe is 8x8 or 8x10 glass Pyrex dish.  This cake is not tough or chewy, but denser than, say, birthday cake, and it is sooo good paired with the peach juices, etc. I had canned peaches on hand and went looking for a recipe in which to use them. This is it! I am so happy because the ingredients called for are usually staples in most pantries. It was pretty simple to make, and can be a fancy treat for guests on a short notice! I did not find the recipe to be too sweet like others mentioned. I know that having cavities can heighten your discomfort when eating sugary foods, so I will just assume that some people will find this too sweet and others will not. This recipe is outstanding.. And I am bringing my leftovers to my co-workers this afternoon!

Cake was spectacular, everyone loved it. I noted that the reipe called for cake flour. Where I come from cake flour is self-raising, it has baking soda mixed with the flour. This could be why some folks are haing overflow problems. I used all purpose flour and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and the recipe was pefect.

I didn't have the zest or the orange juice so I used the juice from the can of peaches. The first time I made this, it overflowed all over my oven. I put some tinfoil under the next time and had no problems.

I initially thought that the batter would be insufficient. I used half peaches instead of sliced and the batter barely covered the peaches. I also used butter instead of shortening because that is what I had. I also used the peach juice as suggested by the other reviews.

After baking, the cake rose beautifully! The cake to half-peach ratio was perfect.

I will be bringing this to our next family pot-luck!

this was a very good recipe. use whatever juice you want if you dont have orange juice on hand. it is conveinent to use the juice from the can because it is exactly the right amount. thank you for sharing this recipe. it is not fancy, but tasty, soft, perfect texture and sweetness...very nice change from pineapple upside down cake.

Quick, easy, simple dessert.  I did sub applesauce for the shortening and reduced the sugar in the cake batter.  With all that sweet yummy-ness on top the cake didn't need to be sweet for me.  I'm sure I will make this again and will try another reviewers idea of adding some vanilla to the cake batter.

The real problem I had with this cake is that it tasted sweet, but didn't tase like anything else.  The brown sugar/butter mixture overwhelms the peaches and the the orange juice and zest in the cake is so sublte as to be nonexistent.  Basically, this cake tasted like nothing.  Cake rapidly overflowed the pan, but since I had a 9x13 underneath I didn't make too much mess.  The problem came when I tried to invert it onto a plate and it fell apart.  Still, we thought it smelled great so we tried to eat it anyway despite how it looked and were sorely disappointed.

This is a VERY sweet cake.  Toothachingly sweet.  Would cut back on both sugars next time around though am not sure how much the texture would be affected.  Used 1 1/2 cups flour since I read the recipe wrong and 1/4cup of that was bread flour because I ran out of cake flour -- how much that changed the texture from the original recipe, I don't know.  But it was a very moist, cottony soft yet dense cake, very good. Baked it in an 8in round pyrex deep dish, it was a lot of batter, though it shrank to a regular 8" layer when cooled a bit. Also added vanilla extract, unsweetened coconut flakes, and omitted cherries.

I'm normally not one to substitute when trying a recipe but I had no choice on this one. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use cake mix and this was it! My changes were: all purpose-flour instead of the cake flour, juice from the canned peaches instead of orange juice, skipped the zest. I didn't measure out the peaches either, just layed them in the bottom of a pie plate in a spiral pattern until they covered the bottom. After the recommended resting time, the cake came out of the plate perfectly. The texture of the cake is denser which I happen to love. As one reviewer mentioned, if you don't use the orange juice than the cake isn't that sweet. I tasted the batter and it was so dull so I added about 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I didn't mind the lack of sweetness in the cake but I think for more flavor, next time I'll add some almond extract and half the shortening with butter for more richness. This was my first upside down cake and it came out beautiful and everyone loved it! Good luck!

Simple to make, and what a great way to use all 
those cans of peaches I collect for this very reason.
I also used applesauce instead of lard. I also used
the left over peach juice, turns out it was 1/2 cup
exactly. Delicious cake.TY!!

I'm not a baker, so imagine my surprise when this came out great!! This was a lovely little cake that solved the problem my sweet tooth was having. I sprinkled some powdered sugar and slapped a scoop of homemade whipped cream next to it to complete the picture. Had I really been thinkin, I would've stuck a little mint leaf on top, like the pros do. LOL

Oka.  I thought this sounded great. But I did make some changes.  I don't use shortening, so I used applesauce and instead of orange juice and zest, I used 1/2 cup of the peach juice from the drained peaches.  AMAZING!! We loved it.  
I tried it tonight with canned apples and the juice from the jar, it is AMAZING!!  We love it.  Its fast and easy.

This is By far one of the best cake recipes I have ever used. Substituting the shortening with a no sugar added applesauce and substituted the sugars both brown and white with the spleda sugars blends. Having Diabetes, this was a wonderful treat.

I made this for my fiancé as a surprise when he came home from work.  It was great because I already had all of the ingredients in the pantry and didn't have to go to the store!!  It turned out great! The only thing I would suggest is if you are using the juice from the peach can instead of orange juice, you may want to add a bit more sugar.  Don't get me wrong, it turned out wonderfully but wasn't quite sweet enough.  Also, best eaten warm! Makes a great light cake/coffee cake! Enjoy! :)

Tasty, dense cake.  Definitely looked wonderful.  We made it in a bundt pan and arranged the peach slices at the bottom so it came out beautifully.  I was doing prep early for a big holiday party, and we took a chance baking it and freezing it for a week before the party.  We thawed it in the fridge overnight before serving.  It was definitely moist, maybe even looked a bit soggy with all that brown sugar topping, but the taste was great, and the cake held up to the freezer well.
