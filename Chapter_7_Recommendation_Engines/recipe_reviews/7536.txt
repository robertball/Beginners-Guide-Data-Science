I love this cake! I substituted applesauce for the butter to save on some of the fat grams and it was still very tasty and moist. I also added a cup of chopped walnuts and an extra apple. It certainly doesn't need any frosting but does taste delicious fresh out of the oven with some Cool Whip on top! (Now you see why I needed to cut out some of the fat grams!!)

I loved this recipe!! My friend and I discovered it one day when cooking, and it became an instant favourite of everyone that tried it! We used actual chocolate, cut up into smaller pieces rather than chocolate chips, and put a whole block in, which was fantastic. It is great warm, or cooled down with icing sugar sprinkled on top!

This cake is very very good. Make sure you let it cool completely in the pan on a rack before trying to unmold it. Loosen the cake in the pan with a knife and place a plate over the pan, then flip it over and tap a little on the bottom of the pan. Some of the chocolate chips stuck to the bottom of the pan, I just stuck them back on the top of the cake lol. I made a simple glaze out of powdered sugar, cinnamon, and milk and it was a great addition. This cake is very moist and delicious, although I don't know about calling it a "chocolate" cake, it tastes more like a spice cake with a little chocolate in it. Either way, the flavor and texture is great. Don't unmold while still warm!!! It will crumble and fall apart. This one is staying in my recipe box.

This was pretty good.  Didn't really taste the apples though.  It was nice and moist with a good chocolate taste, but I didn't "wow" me.  Probably won't make it again.

Very moist, almost too moist.  Recommend small chucks of apple for strong apple flavor.  Also recommend added extra cocoa, and perhaps a chocolate frosting, or some chocolate chips in the mix for the chocolate lovers in the crowd.

I tried this once, and when I saw that it was loved by everyone...I make it it all the time.  At least once a week, so there is always a little piecr to grab  :-)

I pretty well followed the recipe as written, although I did add 2 more apples, to try and get a more 'apple-y' taste.  Wonderful recipe!!

I made this recipe for my husband.  He liked it very much and gives it a 4 out of 5 stars.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use applesauce to make it non-fat.

Very yummy!  I have made this cake a few times and my family and friends love it!  I have even substituted the apple for a reduced amount of fresh pineapple and it's great!

This is absolutely delicious, moist and not too rich! A great way to use extra apples and chocolate that's sitting around. My family loves it!

Really tasty!  I diced the apples instead of shredding them, and it turned out just fine that way!

Very moist cake with a nice texture.  I just didn't like the taste of apples and chocolate together.
