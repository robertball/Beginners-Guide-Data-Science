I have tried this recipe twice, the first time exactly how it is written, the second time I skipped the sugar and it was far better. Sugar makes it too sweet for potato sald. Without it, it tastes just like a "loaded" baked potato. Terrific!

I loved this recipe, but altered  it slightly to give it more flavor.  I chopped up a few hard boiled eggs and added dill, garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard and a pound of pepper bacon (versus bacon bits).  I have been asked to bring it to several family get-togethers and my picky nephew called it "heavenly."  Will make it all summer for a variety of gatherings and events.  Thanks!

I work at a restaurant and brought this in for all the other "foodies" to try. They loved it!! I made 2 versions, one with celery and one without, celery won hands down. I did not add as much celery as I would for a traditional potato salad. I did not add the sugar. I substituted fresh chives for the green onions. The bacon was added at the very end to ensure it wasn't soggy. If you make it the night before, be sure to leave it out for a little while before serving, the sour cream makes the dish set up kind of hard. This will be made many times over. Thank you!!!

I cut the sugar in half and used regular baking potatoes. It turned out great and the level of sweetness seemed perfect to me.

A good jumping off point, but I had to jazz it up... With my additions, it is REALLY GOOD!!!  I added 1 ts onion powder, 1/4 ts paprika, 1/2 ts each salt and pepper, plus I cut the sugar to 1 TB.  Mixed the "sauce" first, then just added in the "solids."  10 minutes was too long to boil, next time I will do 8-9... I can NEVER seem to get the potatoes cooked right for potato salad for some reason, I usually under-do them but this time they were slightly over-done.  I also used 6 slices of bacon crumbled rather than the bits, and subbed pepperjack cause I have a brick of it right now and also thought it needed the kick.  With these switcheroos it was awesome, but I think without the addition of, at a minimum, SALT and pepper this would be rather bland, even with all the yummy stuff in there...  Bottom line, cut (or omit) the sugar, add seasoning and you've got a WINNER!!!

Wow - this potato salad is delicious! It's like eating a loaded baked potato. I used light sour cream and Hellman's light mayo and left out the sugar.  I also used a light Cheddar cheese and REAL bacon - a bit more than a Tbsp. This was very easy to put together, yet tasted great!

Fantastic!  I've made it twice... one time with sugar, and one time without.  I'd recommend leaving the sugar out... the added sweetness just doesn't taste that good in this type of potato salad.

Just made this for dinner tonight - This is an amazing alternative to traditional potato salad!  I added chopped celery as another reviewer recommended and the crunch was a great addition.  I didn't add the sugar (and don't think I would have liked it with the sugar) but did add salt and pepper.  I think I will make this again for a BBQ this weekend.  So yummy!

This was absolutely excellent. I made no changes besides doubling the recipe. It was a huge hit at our family reunion. I'm still getting calls for the recipe. WOW! Will definitely be making this often.

While I was putting this together, it didn't seem to have enough flavor as it was, red potatoes don't have a lot of flavor themselves.  I had to throw in a half pack of dry ranch dressing mix with the sauce ingredients.  That flavored it up alot!  It was delicious, had to leave out the onions as DB is allergic but I threw in celery leaves for some green and a little extra flavor.  Delicious!

This is my most requested recipes when I cook for family barbeques during the summer. What I do different is add about a half cup of bacon bits to the salad as well as sprinkling some on top. I don't add any sugar at all. I'll also throw in a bit of Tabasco with the sour cream/mayo mixture with some garlic powder, paprika and pepper. Sometimes, I add some crushed french fried onions on top, too. This keeps well for a couple days, if you make it for just your family. It's also great in Potato Salad Sandwiches.

I made some alterations to this recipe that suited our family and others have loved it!
I left out the sugar and used Miracle Whip instead, I too also used real bacon, and to give it a punch added cayenne pepper to the seasoning, just for a bit of a bite.

I'm not a big fan of the usual potato salad but this is definitely not the usual potato salad.  I didn't use the full amount of dressing - just added until it looked good - and then sprinkled some seasoned salt on it.  Used low fat mayo and sour cream but otherwise followed the recipe.  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Very good salad! I skipped the sugar and added seasonings such as garlic and onion powders and some dill. I loved the whole bacon, onion and cheese thing going on in this recipe. Different, delicious and devoured by all in a very short time! Thanks Kennedy!

This is a great way to fix potato salad for a change. Leave out the sugar. It is not needed. I feel it needs pepper, and maybe salt depending upon the saltiness of the bacon used. I use a nitrate free bacon, pre-cooked that I crisp up in the microwave, then cut into bits with my kitchen shears. To speed things up, I microwaved the potatoes. Would be good with celery and hard boiled eggs added, but then it wouldn't be this recipe. In a hurry? Serve warm. It's delicious that way and takes about 10 minutes from the time you peel the potatoes and do other prep work until it's ready to be eaten.
This would also be great with cooked cauliflower instead of the potatoes for a low carb version.

Hard to go wrong with bacon and cheese! I made it with the sugar, but agree with other reviews that it should be left out. That or add something to counteract it- vinegar or lemon juice?

My family really enjoyed this Potato Salad, except for the fact that it called for too much sugar. I feel that you could totally delete the sugar and still have a great tasting potato salad.

This potato salad is amazing!  I changed it a little by adding 2 hard boiled eggs and I only added about a teaspoon of sugar.  The family loved it!  I will definetely be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the advice of many and didn't put in the sugar.  Flavor was great!  But it was dry.  The potatoes soaked up the "sauce" and when eating  it was like having peanut butter stuck to the top of my mouth.  Will try again but with more sauce.

This recipe is awesome. I too left out the sugar. It just doesn't need it. This salad tastes like a loaded baked potato and is a fraction of the mess. We had it with burgers tonight; my family gave the salad 2 thumbs up.

SKIP THE SUGAR! I started adding the 1/4 cup of sugar and realized ahead of time, that's a lot of sugar! I used about 1/2 Tbsp and in the end, that was still too sweet. Other than a sweet punch every so often, it was yummy! I used Mexican cheese and added more bacon for texture

I don't like eggs, so am not a fan of most potato salads. This recipe is the first potato salad I have ever made. Like previous posters suggested I added Dill weed, garlic powder and ground mustard (about 1/4-1/2 tsp. each). It got great reviews at a family gathering!

I made this for a girl scout get together.  It was fantastic.  It is easy to put together and tastes delicious.  My seven year old daughter did not care for it.  I gave it 5 stars because I liked it.

Quick, easy, and YUMMY!
I actually turned it into a baked mashed potatoe side for dinner, and mixed all ingredients, threw it in the oven for 15 mins at 350 degrees, and voella!

I thought this was very good...i used regular potatoes instead of red potatoes though and i browned bacon ends to put in it instead of using bacon bits.  I am making it again tonight for a side dish. Its a nice change from regular potato salad.

Really good!  Didn't add sugar (just didn't seem to fit??), but did add some seasonings per other reviewers.  Try mixing a bit of dill pickle juice in...delicious!

Okay, 5 stars because I made a few changes. First off, forget the sugar all together! Blek..not necessary. Next off, double your sauce and add ins. Thirdly, I added a heaping tablespoon of garlic seasoning (from Costco) and then another heaping tablespoon of dill. Absolutely perfection.

LOVED IT! I also omitted the sugar and sort of eye-balled the other ingredients. I cooked my own bacon and mixed some in with the salad as well. Everyone really enjoyed this and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great starting point, but there are NO SEASONINGS as written -- How good can that really be?!?!  Added garlic & onion powders, dill weed, salt & pepper.  I like to salt & pepper the potatoes right in the strainer while they're still moist and hot.  Added about 1/3 c of diced celery for some crunch & flavor.  Use at least the full amt of green onion, cheese & bacon bits, then ADD MORE on top for garnish.  NO SUGAR!  Just doesn't really seem to belong in this one....if you add it, add a bit at a time and taste along the way.  Good place to start - but unless your tastebuds lean toward the bland side, add some seasonings for sure.

This potato salad was not what I was looking for. I expected it to taste more like the potato salad that you get in delis, but it tasted more like a dry baked potato and after serving it once to my hubby, he requested that I put some boiled egg and mayo in it because it was dry. I would not make this again, but just go for a more traditional potato salad recipe.

Loved it!  I skipped the sugar and was liberal with the onions, cheese and bacon bits (I used hormel- very good, tasted fresh).  I would definitely recommend this.  Hubby loved it too!

We loved the basic simple flavors in this potato salad.  I did back off on the sugar just a bit but it does add something special to the taste.  I used splenda and it was just fine.  Will make this again for sure.

I had high hopes on this based on reviews, and I'm really shocked no one said to add salt.  Totally needs salt.  I made this and added celery because it had no bite - which may be a southern thing but I thought a must.  Added salt and pepper, added 1/2 pound fried bacon crumbled.  It was good but will probably stick to my potato salad I've made for years.

I think it needs a bit of salt and additional bacon.  I will leave out the sugar next time as others have suggested.  It it pretty sweet, but still good.

I left out the sugar, added some powdered ranch dressing to the mayo/sour cream and added a 3 oz pkg of REAL bacon bits/pieces right into the salad (No Baco's)...I could eat this whole thing myself.  It tasted even better the next day, just add extra mayo/sour if your making it a day ahead since the sour will start to solidify.  Thank you Kennedy5976, I'd been paying $5.99/lb for this stuff.

Minor changes made it the best potato salad ever!  Used half a pack of real bacon instead of the bits and used sharp cheddar cheese.  Did not use the sugar and added: dill, ground pepper, and onions (which were cooked in the bacon fat left on the griddle).  I put the bacon, green onions, cheese and my additional ingredients throughout the entire mixture, as opposed to reserving half, etc. for on top.

This was outstanding! I was looking for something different to take to a cook out and this was definately what I was looking for.  As other suggested, I omitted the sugar. I had a busy weekend, so the day before the picnic, I did the mayo/sour cream mixture, added parsley, onion powder, and bell pepper/garlic mix, let that chill over nite so the flavors would blend.  Also, I used real crumpled bacon instead of the bits. Everybody loved it!! Thank you for this awsome recipe.

I made this as is but without the bacon bits (nobody in my family likes them) and with a little less sugar and it was a hit. I feel that it was missing something (dill or garlic or something but can't put my finger on it) so will experiment next time I make it. My father however loved it so just personal preference. Very good recipe!

Really really great potato salad. We crave this, and this is the only kind we make. I call it "Baked Potato" Salad, because it has all the toppings you put on a baked potato. This recipe does not need to be followed exactly in my experience.

As written, this is incredibly bland. I made it as stated, even though I was skeptical, and I was right. I added lots of salt and black pepper, garlic and parsley and it was much better. I ended up adding a splash of vinegar to offset the icky sweet taste from the sugar, even though I added way less. The idea was good, a 'loaded baked potato salad' but poorly executed by this recipe.

This is the perfect potato salad, I don't love traditional heavy mayonnaise filled potato salad. This recipe is just the right consistency and creamy.  I didn't add the sugar and followed some other reviews by adding 2 sliced stalks of celery and a sprinkling of dill. Delish!

Made this without sugar and it seemed to be missing something. Made it again and added 4 garlic cloves to potatoes while boiling, then found them after draining and chopped them up into the salad. Voila!! A great "loaded baked potato" salad! They ate every bite. Now I can say its the best!

I understood the concept a 'DIFFERENT' potato salad, and I was open minded to that, I ate it, BUT, would not repeat. The sugar just did not work. I felt it could be made into a great recipe with a little tweaking. Needed some salt for sure.

The potatoes weren't completely cold when I made this and it tasted amazing - a lot like loaded baked potatoes. Then I put it in the fridge and it's not nearly as good cold - the flavours aren't as strong. I did add salt, pepper and garlic powder when making it but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh, and eggs since I already had a few hard boiled waiting for the salad before I found this recipe. All in all, more calories than other salads with the cheese and bacon and when served cold I don't think it's worth it.

I liked the idea of this salad but I had to make so many changes (some mine and some from others) I cant give it a 5.
CUT OUT THE SUGAR ALTOGETHER.  I made it with half the suggested amount and it tasted weird sweet so I put some vinegar in and that balanced it out a bit but I suggest not using any sugar.

I added boiled eggs, lots of salt, pepper and some other seasonings.  I also used a whole bag of bacon bits and it tasted very good.

I would make this type of salad again but dont know that this recipe is the best one to use.

I made this according to the recipe the first time I made this, and then made some changes the next time.  Definitely leave out the sugar!!  I added salt and pepper, a good amount of dill weed, some pickle juice (yeah sounds weird, but good!) and some paprika.  I used a pound of real bacon, crumbled.  I took it to a party today and it was devoured!  Everyone loved it!  I think I may try adding some finely chopped red onion next time too!

Absolutely delicious!  Such a great change from the potato salad I usually make.  The only thing I did differently was to cut the sugar in half and sprinkled it over the cooked potatoes with a little vinegar as well.  They balance each other out and give it a great flavor!

I made this last night without ever seeing the recipe.  I thought I was being original and creative, guess not lol.  The only difference was that I did not use sugar, and I don't believe I would in the future.  Anyway, my advice would be to add all the ingredients to your own taste - more or less cheese, bacon, onions, etc.  I didn't measure anything.  An earlier post said they didn't like the mayo flavor, but I can tell you I originally used just sour cream and the potatoes just seemed to absorb it and make it very dry.  I added mayo (not miracle whip!) for moisture and texture, not necessarily flavor - so I suggest you don't leave it out entirely.  It also needs several good shakes of salt and pepper.  I chose to bake the potatoes in the microwave because I think boiled potatoes lose a little flavor.  Plus it's just faster and easier.  My 12 yr old hates traditional potato salad, but absolutely loved this.  UPDATE:  Hubby insisted I make traditional potato salad for 4th of July, but I chose to make this also.  By the end of the meal this potato salad was gone and the traditional was still half full.  I was asked for the recipe by several people.

Absolutely the best potato salad I have ever tasted in my life! The only "tweaking" I did was salt the potato water, use real bacon and lots of it, drop the sugar completely and add 2 more T of sour cream. I mixed all of the bacon, cheese and green onion in with the potato mixture, reserving just enough for topping. Outstanding recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Good salad.  I cut down on the sugar and added extra vinegar. I don't like my potato salad too sweet.  This was really good and I used real bacon that I cooked and crumbled.  Everyone really liked this one!

This was a great recipe. I didn't use the sugar, after reading other's advice on it. It was a HUGE hit at our Easter dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe, and people were still bragging about it days later. It was definetly a big hit, and I will used it again and again.

We loved this. I did use real bacon (all I had - about 4 slices)
It reminds me of a loaded baked potato. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful.  I think I liked this recipe so much becuase I abosultely love potato skins, and this is pretty much all the ingredients (except tomato).  I read the reviews about the sugar, and should have listened because I found it too sweet, but managed to tone it down with vinegar. I also added way more bacon then the recipe called for, and salting the water is a must.  I'm suppose to be bringing this to my stepdaughters b-day party tonight, only if I can stop picking at it in the fridge !!

Yum!  This is one of the best potato salads I've ever made.  We had leftovers the following day and it was even better than the day before.  A great salad and definitely a keeper with this family.  The only changes I made were to use real bacon instead of bacon bits.

I left out the sugar, added celery and used pepperoni in place of bacon bit (only because I had neither bacon nor bacon bits.) I made it with fat free sour cream and Miracle Whip. It was nice to finally see my husband eat a potato salad...this is a keeper because he actually didn't mind it. It needs more seasoning though, and next time I think I'll add broccoli instead of celery. This would be a nice one for a large family gathering because not having to peel the potatoes is a huge time saver!

This is a great and quick addition to your grilling meals.  I have made it several times, some exactly to the recipe, other times with no sugar. Both are great. Simple, fun and tasty. Must keep.

This recipe is amazing with only a couple of minor adjustments. I left out the sugar and used real bacon that I just cooked and crumbled. Also, the potatoes we kind of bland so I made sure to salt the cooking water to give them just a little bit more flavor without changing the overall profile of the dish.

Very nice for a change from the routine potato salad.  Only change I made was I used Hidden Valley bottled ranch dressing with the mayonaise for a slight ranch flavor and deleted the sugar.  We will make this again.

Oh my gosh, this was delicious!  I only added about a tbsp of sugar, and I also added garlic powder, dill, seasoning salt, and salt and pepper, and used real bacon, and I think I just eyed the cheese, so I am sure it was way more than the recipe called for.

Yummy....I used all low fat options here and it was still very good....low fat sour cream, mayo, and turkey bacon....green onions are key...so dont leave them out. I also decreased the sugar to approx. 2 tblspns....maybe a lil less....and could still taste plenty of sweetness....I think the 1/4c would be overkill. A tasty potato salad. Thanks!

A 10 star recipe!  I have never liked potato salad until now.  This is like eating a loaded baked potato, but only better.  The only thing I did different was to use real bacon, beacuse it is what I had on hand.  The leftovers are even better the next day as the flavors have blended even more.  I can't wait to take this to all the picnics this summer, as I know it is going to be a total hit.  Thank you Kennedy for this delicious recipe.

Leave off the white sugar.   Add a splash of Worchestershire sauce - heat in microwave until cheese melts - delicious!

This was great, but I did make a few changes. I only used 1 Tbsp. sugar as others had reviewed that it was too sweet. I sprinkled in a little onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed, salt, and pepper. I also mixed in a few bacon crumbles. This was a great alternative to traditional potato salad and everyone loved it.

This was OK but the addition of sugar was not really for us; will stick with my garlic based potato salad with bacon I cook myself because the bacon pieces are just too small to really enjoy the taste of bacon.

This recipe recieved rave reviews in my family. My father said it was the best he has ever had including his own mother's (which never happens). The only changes I made were that I mixed everything, I did not reserve anything to sprinkle on top. I also added 6 hard-boiled eggs and they added a nice texture and flavor. Definitely try this recipe!

I make this with no sugar and use lowfat mayo, lowfat sourcream and turkey bacon. I then add 2% lowfat cheese throughout and put in oven for about 25 minutes at 350 and it bakes soo yummy!

I made this for a cookout last weekend, and it was a huge hit!  I usually make potato salad, but wanted something different.... This was perfect! I only added about a teaspoon of sugar, just for personal preference.... And like other reviewers said, it tasted like a loaded baked potato (and who doesn't like that?!!) I cooked about 5 slices of bacon and crumbled it in.... and I added salt and pepper.... DELICIOUS!  Thanks for a great recipe--- I will be making this for picnics all summer long!  :)

Great recipe - just the type of potato salad I was looking for. But I think it needs salt and pepper to balance out the sugar.

I omitted the sugar and used a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses.  I didn't add any green onions since we didn't have any.  Other than that, this was a great recipe!  I think next time I will experiment by roasting the potatoes to give it a different flavor.  Thanks!

This was my first ever attempt at making potato salad and it was great. I left out the sugar and added diced celery and regular onions, salt and pepper.  Used oscar meyer bacon bits on top before eating.  Doesn't really need the extra cheese on top either, good witout.

I'm giving this a 3 only because I made several changes that I think the recipe would have suffered without.  As others have said, leave out the sugar entirely.  Really, do you sugar your baked potato?  I also used real bacon just because I'm a bacon purist (LOL).  I used more sour cream and less mayo than called for, and seasoned quite a bit more than listed.  Without these changes, I really don't think we would have liked it, but with them, we're having it again!

This was, by far, the most interesting potato salad I've ever made.  I made a double batch and took it to a party, and the bowl was scraped clean!  The best part about it is that it can be served warm, and my family prefers it that way.  The red potatoes got a little mushy during the cooking process, but that was great, because the final result tasted like loaded mashed potato salad. :-)  I mixed in my potatoes while they were still rather warm, which immediately melted the cheese.

I'm only giving the recipe 4 stars as is, because I read the reviews of others, and made a couple of changes for the better.  No sugar at all, salt the water before cooking the potatoes, added freshly ground pepper before the toppings, and mixed in some extra bacon bits in with the "dressing".  I could see this being a staple at our house; my boyfriend would probably add in some ranch dressing, just for a little extra kick!

This is very good. I used the same amounts of sour cream and mayo, as previous reviewers advised.  I omitted the sugar altogether, added about 2 tbsp. of fresh chives, and I halved the amount of cheddar cheese called for. I used 2 tbsp. of artificial bacon bits (all I had on hand), and I added about a tsp. of Nature's Seasonings.  I know that I did some major modifications, but this is a great base recipe that I will use over and over again!

I decided to try this instead of my loaded baked potato recipe.  I didn't like the mayo flavor with this and the sugar made it just a little too sweet for our tastes.  Although it was really good we still like our regular recipe just a little bit better.  Thanks for the post.

Wonderful potato salad!  Very flavorful.  I added more bacon (couldn't resist!).  When you want a potato salad that's a little different, this is the way to go.  Makes a nice change from the same old, same old.

I brought this to an office potluck and received rave reviews. Admittedly, I did not follow the recipe exactly. Personally, I am not fond of really sweet potato salads, so I subbed some salad dressing (e.g., Miracle Whip) for some of the mayo and added no sugar. I also added a couple of tablespoons of dry ranch seasoning. It was the only dish that was completely gone when lunch was over.

This is almost the same salad a store near me sells for $8 per lb. I did have to 'hot rod' it also: cut out the sugar, used real bacon, doubled the mayo (used Duke's-the best!) and added a tsp. of salt, onion, garlic, and chives. I also gave it two shakes of cheyanne pepper for a little depth. Then I let it chill for a few hours. Turned out great!

I thought this recipe was just a little bland and boring.  I only used a tablespoon of sugar after heeding advice from the previous reviews, and I used real bacon, but I think next time I make this dish I will use a little more sugar, more bacon and perhaps some freshly minced garlic and a lot of salt and pepper.  It was tasty though and a good, solid potato salad.  Just needs some spice!

LOOOOOVE IT!  I don't care for your regular run of the mill potato salad, so this was a REALLY nice change.  I've made it several times.

This is a great potato salad recipe. I used baked potatoes (cooled then skinned) chopped into chunks for this recipe and it was just like "loaded" baked potatoes. My family just loved it. This will be a regular at our family gatherings. (I didn't have enough regular cheese so I used half regular sharp cheddar and half parmesan and it was really, really good.)

This is SO GOOD! I have never made potato salad before and was asked to make some for a party.  I was thinking how sick of potato salad everyone must be by this time of the summer but this salad was different and everyone loved it.  Wouldn't change a thing in the reicipe except to add "salt the water when cooking the potatoes".  GREAT RECIPE!

I used light mayo and sour cream as well as lower fat cheese. Left out the sugar.  I did use real bacon. Excellent recipe for a summer side dish

Perfect when you are looking for something new and different from the regular old potato salad.  Super easy, this was the first time I've ever made potato salad!

I enjoyed this salad, and at a bbq our guests liked the fact that it was a different take on potato salad. But, it tasted a little bland to me. I added a hearty dose of salt and pepper and that seemed to help, but it still was missing a little something. Next time I'll definitely salt the water while boiling the potatoes.
I used mostly higher-fat ingredients, with the exception of light sour cream, but I am glad that I can make a healthy low-fat version by using only light sour cream (no mayo), 2% low-fat cheddar, and the bacon bits made from soybeans instead of real bacon.
The fresh chives really made this salad seem light and fresh and perfect for summer. Yummy overall!

EXCELLENT potato salad!  It won RAVE reviews from all of my guests at a recent lunch party!  Next time though, I will use less sugar--probably half as much or so.  It was a little more sweet than I would like.  Otherwise, I loved it!!

Made with 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo.  And fried and crumbled almost 1lb of bacon in instead of the Tbsp.  Didn't add the sugar.  So with MY changes, 5 star.  I will make it again.

As other reviewers suggested, I chose not to add sugar and thought it was good without. I also added a can of chunk chicken breast for more protein to make it a meal.

I made this today and it is so good!!! Instead of green onions I used bell peppers, a pack of hidden valley ranch seasoning, real cooked bacon, just a dab of sugar, salt, pepper, mayo, cheese, sour cream and a little ranch dressing!!!! My kids loved it.

Liked this! A different spin on potatoes salad. I think next time I will add some ranch dressing in the mix. If anyone is looking for something different, I would recommend this.

GOSH DARN' IT! 
I saw this recipe and got excited because it sounds like it might taste like the potato salad from my favorite hamburger place....  I was so sure it would be AWESOME that I doubled the recipe to bring to a big after wedding party for my nephew tomorrow.....And it is WAY TOO SWEET! I always read the reviews when I pick a recipe but I found this recipe a few months back and saved it and so if I had read the reviews I dont remember.... But most everyone is leaving out the sugar and I am wishing I did too.   Ahhh well.... Hopefully someone at the party really likes too sweet potato salad....  Other than the dreaded sugar I think it would be terrific.

This is absolutely delicious! Because of the reviews regarding the sugar, I started out with 1 tablespoon incriments. And stopped at the 1 tablespoon. Simple delicious! Putting in my favorites folder! (if it seems to be on the dry side for some of you, just add a bit more mayo or sour cream)

We too left out the sugar and at least tripled the bacon bits. WOW!!! This is just like a local deli makes and I have been trying to get the recipe for years!! Oh and by the way, we just mixed everything together.

So good with our burgers! I lightened it up for us by using low fat sour cream and subbing non fat yogurt for the mayo as I often do in my salad dressings and potato salads.  Added some garlic powder and cajun seasoning and cut the sugar to one tablespoon. I would like to try make this dish  warm next time as a casserole-bet it would be good!

This was a hit at the potluck we had a work. A lot of people commented that they enjoyed it because it was similar to a "Loaded Baked Potato". The only ingredient I skipped was the sugar and it came out pretty good, I think I might add more bacon next time though. Great recipe!

my friend pam says this is off the hook - a definate keeper for us. the only thing i did different was not cool the potatoes, put in the sour cream, mayo,added a little paula deen house seasoning, cheese, green onion and bacon right after draining the potatoes then topped with the extra cheese bacon and onion like recipe said put the lid on to keep warm until dinner (about 20 - 30 minutes) DELICIOUS....I will be making this often.

Excellent recipe as it is listed. I have made it several times in different ways.  My final recipe includes adding  1 each of red, yellow, and green bell pepper chopped as fine as you dare.

Very good!  My hubby loves loaded baked potatoes, so I was excited to try this recipe out.  It turned out great!  I did not use the sugar, but I did add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper.  I also salted the water to boil the potatoes with 1 1/2 tsp. koser salt.  I mixed in an extra Tbsp. of bacon bits into the salad as well.  Highly recommend!

OMG this is the yummies thing every.  I made this for a party on Saturday, however, i used about 7lbs of potatoes and changed everything accordingly.  We ended up coming home with probably more than 2lbs of potatoes and it only took us 2 days to finsh the rest.  Im making it again for a picnic in two weeks and cant wait for leftovers!!!

Made this for the first time, using my family as test subjects.  Everyone loved it! I didn't add as much sugar (only 1/4c) but did add garlic, dill & dry mustard as one reviewer suggested.  Awesome potato salad!

Very good and easy!  I too skipped the sugar.  Used regular russet potatoes (about 5) b/c that is what I had on hand and regular onion because I was out of chives.  Also used left-over turkey bacon.  Will make again - thanks!

I disagree with some other reviewers about leaving out the sugar altogether.  This is my go-to potato salad because it's fast and delicious and everyone loves it!  I go heavy on the sour cream and mayo because I use a 3lb bag of red potatoes.  I go a little light on the sugar, but I find it's better with the sugar, which balances the sour cream and mayo.  I use real bacon bits in the dressing as well as a garnish on top and it is wonderful and could not be easier (no boiling eggs, chopping celery, etc. etc.)!

Oh My Gosh, this was awesome and my hubby & I loved it! I did leave out the bacon & instead of sugar (for health reasons) I used 1/8 cup of Light Agave Syrup. It was great, thanks for a different take on potato salad, this is a keeper!

We enjoyed the potato salad, after reading reviews about being drying increased the mayo to 3/4 C ran out of sour cream but had french onion dip so added a 1/4 cup and it was still good.

This was ok. I don't have a scale so I just guessed at what 2 pounds of potatoes was. I think I used too many because it wasn't really creamy. Kind of dry. I think it would be better if I used the correct amount of potatoes. I'll try it again and re-rate it.

The salad tasted better warm and was a little dry once it had cooled.  I reduced the sugar to 1T, increased the bacon to 2T, replaced the onion with a dash of onion powder and also added a dash of celery seed, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  It was good and I will probably make it again, although I may add a little more sour cream and mayo next time.  Also, I used light sour cream and light mayo and it still tasted good.

I think what I did wrong was make this salad a day ahead.  It was pretty dry.  I even mixed another mayo/sour cream mixture before serving it  but it wasn't as good as when I first had mixed it the day before.  I omitted the sugar all together per the previous reviewers.  I also used red onion instead of green b/c I didn't have any.  My daughter also like the salad when it was still warm and not refrigerated.   I will try this again but I won't make it ahead of time.  I also added a ton of bacon bit far more than what it called for. Next time I also might add a dry ranch dressing mix to the mayo/sour cream mixture.  That'll give it another kick.

Historically, I have not been a fan of potato salad.  However, I recently had a delicious potato salad from a boutique market- turns out, I just don't like mustard-based potato salads.  This recipe comes pretty close to the salad I got from the market.  I left out the sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and I used real bacon.  I added a tiny bit of sea salt, because I was worried that the bacon would make the salad super-salty, but it definitely needed more salt.  I also added garlic powder.  Very good!  Even my potato salad-hating husband had some.

The first time I made this my family loved it. I kept in the sugar and it gives it an unique taste. The only thing is I left out the bacon bits and let those that wanted it put it on. But I will make this at every occasion at my families request.

I obmitted the sugar like others have suggested, added more cheese and some garlic.  I left out the bacon one time I made it (nitrate allergies) and it was still wonderful.  My guests kept raving and going back for more.  Really nice change from regular mustard potato salad.

Loved this!  Added more cheese, and put the bacon on top, because I was afraid it would get soggy if I stirred it in.  As per other reviews, I eliminated the sugar.  I forgot to add salt, but I don't like salty foods, so it worked out. Great way to have a "baked potato" taste in the summer time.

This is a very good recipe--especially if you don't like a mustard based potato salad. As others recommended, I reduced the sugar to only about one tbls. I also added salt and pepper to taste, extra bacon mixed in, and used light mayo and fat free sour cream instead of regular.

great recipe.  I wanted to try something new for the annual Father's Day BBQ.  I pureed some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added it for a little extra kick.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Otherwise, we followed the recipe as is.

I added 5 slices of thick bacon, crumbled. I used 1 cup of both sour cream and mayo. Added some extra spices: garlic powder, salt, and cayenne pepper. Everyone was wowed away by this potato salad. Everyone said they loved better than the traditional potato salad. I have made numerous times in the last few weeks and every time it is a winner. I also omitted the sugar.

Everyone thought this was really great, a nice diversion from regular potato salad. I did not add the sugar, just didn't seem to need it. For leftovers, I heated it, wonderful, just like a baked potato. Next time, I will make it as a warm salad. I did add equal amounts of sour cream and mayo, and added more bacon into the salad.  Really, really good.

I am always trying new recipes for potato salad. I made this for a party,
added extra bacon & cut the sugar in 1/2.
I was told it was rated A+ and that it
was the best potato salad they had ever had. I will be making this alot. Yummy!! Barb N.H.

Love this!  I actually like the sugar.  It's supposed to be a sweeter potato salad so I'd recommend trying it as is first to see if you like it.  My hubbie loves this one!

It was alright... But, seemed to be missing something that I couldn't quite nail down. Used equal parts lite sour cream / lite mayo.  Omitted the sugar.  Used 2 Green Onions and some Red onion.  Added in a lot more cheese, and GOBS more bacon bits.  Also tossed in garlic powder and chives.

This was good, but I was really hoping it would taste similar to some potato salad with a sour cream base that we enjoy from our local NC BBQ restaurant. I thought the flavors were too obvious and it was too sweet (I even cut the sugar down to 1 Tbsp).

Four stars because I modified it a bit to make it more to my taste (thanks to the reviews). Doubled the mayo, omitted the sugar, used more cheese and green onions, added salt and pepper, and used a whole package of bacon that I fried and crumbled. Turned out so good! Tastes like it's from a local deli. I did mix bacon, onion, and cheese in the salad and saved some to put on top as well for presentation. Simple recipe that's wonderful for me now.

My husband thought was too bland.  I added salad olives which helped.  I think it needs to have equal amounts of sour cream and mayo. I will not make this again.

Was very good. Made a few modifications. Only used about 1/8 of cup sugar, used one package of oscar meyer pre-cooked bacon in packagand NOT bacon bits. mixed bacon, cheese and grn onions throughout the whole thing. Whisked mayo, sour cream and sugar, w/1 tbsp of vinegar. I brought it to a pitch in and it was all gone! Those who leave out the sugar, are missing a very important element in the taste of this. It was yummy with a reduced amount of sugar!!!

I usually hate potato salad but this one was sooo good. I always add a little bit of lemon juice and leave out the sugar and it is perfect. Thanks!

The sweetness from the sugar was great. I seasoned with whatever I had on hand.  Salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  I will definitely make this again.

......this was o.k...reminded us of a cold baked potato with the works...I ended up warming it in the oven and we liked it better that way.
