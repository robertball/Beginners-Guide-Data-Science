Made with 1/2 bottle Angry Orchard hard cider and put the other half to good use washing it down later :-)

Started later in the day, cooked on low for 4 hours, and on high for the final hour. Perfect.

Made recipe as is.  We totally didn't like the flavours and found it dry and bland.

If you like sauerkraut, this is a great dish. The pork was very tender and the juice on the bottom of the crockpot  was tasty.   I added some chopped apples as suggested by another reviewer.    This is a keeper!
