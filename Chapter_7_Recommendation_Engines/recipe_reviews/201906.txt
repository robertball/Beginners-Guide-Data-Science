I'm glad I scaled this back to 4 servings.  The flavor was extremely murky with nothing shining through.  I tried adding various ingredients to salvage, but gave up.  Perhaps someone would like these, but not in this family...sorry.

I loved the smell of these!  I omitted the bouillon, and changed the onion to onion powder. Excellent flavor! I will be making these again soon!

Every year I make at least 3 different kinds of Deviled Eggs; these were the BEST! Great flavor - I didn't use the poppyseeds though - I will next time.

These were a hit at Christmas!  I began w/ 12 eggs instead of 24 and then added a few extra yolks, made the flavors pop even more.

I will make the curried deviled eggs again. My 16 year old son did most of the work as we cooked side by side for a St. Patrick's Day party. My guests thought that they were delicious, and we ran out.

this was delicious.. i used this recipe to dress my tuna for tuna salad wraps.. i cut the recipe down to 6 servings (my math) and left out the poppy seeds and chicken bouillon.. subbed onion powder (half the amount) for the dried minced.. i used a jamaican curry blend and am wondering if Emily Tisdale maybe used a different kind of curry powder causing her not to like this.. i think it tastes fantastic.. i'm looking forward to making deviled eggs or maybe egg salad as this recipe was intended for.. ty for submiting
