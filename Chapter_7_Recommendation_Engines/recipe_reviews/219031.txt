I used Frank's instead of Tabasco and left out the green onions. I topped with Muenster cheese. It was a hit at my house.

Oh my, this was fabulous! And it's good for you, which is a huge bonus! I eyeballed the ingredients, adding a bit more worcestershire and hot sauce, and I had to use sandwich bread, as I didn't have any buns on hand. I will DEFINITELY be making this again and again, thanks so much!

I thought these burgers were GREAT.  I put a little twist on them however.  Instead of bell pepper I diced one jalapeno, and I only used approx. 3/4 medium onion in total.  Lastly, I seasoned with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.

I broiled them as I do not have a grill and found that 6 mins on each side was best.  I topped with American Cheese and 1/4 avocado on each burger!

Will totally make again and very soon!

I only gave this 3 stars because it just tasted ok to us. I was expecting much more of a "wow" factor. But they pretty much tasted like my regular turkey burgers I make with out all of the mess of preparation. They also fell apart very easily. My turkey burger which taste very similar are so much easier. I just make up the patties and put them in the pan, throw in a few onion slices on top (easier to pick out for my kids who don't want onions), and top with a very small amount of Kikkoman's reduced sodium teriyaki marinade & sauce. And...they don't fall apart so easily. Probably won't make again since the flavor is not much different than mine, and mine are easier.

Made the turkey versions & they was very good.  Added some fresh jalape√±os since we rarely have tobasco sauce.  Baked fries on the side & dinner is served.  Avocado too.

These were pretty good, but not exactly what I expected.  I should have chopped up the onion and pepper much more finely than I did and I would add much more spice next time!  I will definitely try this recipe again with these tweaks!

My husband liked these, but I thought they were rather flavor-less. We both agreed that calling these burgers "cajun" is a sin, as the flavor is far from cajun. I have left-overs. I'm going to try putting hot pepper cheese on them to provide more flavor.

Awesome!!! We doubled the tabasco and worcestershire sauce to give it a little more "tang". Served these on buns with a slice of tomato and onion and lettuce. They were so good, we didn't even need mayo, mustard, or ketchup!

this was really good.  Next time I will make and then use maybe a 1/2 measuring cup to portion it out then use spatula to shape and flatten onto broiler.  Ground chicken is very sticky, won't soley rely on my hands for mixing and forming into burgers again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Although these burgers were very juicy, I found them to be a little bland and certainly didn't taste anything "Cajun" about them. They're not spicy at all. Next time I'll find a Cajun seasoning recipe to add to the burgers.

I added bread crumbs to hold it together, and the burgers turned out awesome.

We made this one awhile back, but just noticed I didn't review it. Very delicious for a chicken burger (which I usually hate). We tried the same stuff except with beef and it's just as good.

These weren't bad, they just weren't good either.  They smelled amazing while they were cooking, but the end result was bland- and that was after I added about 2Tbsp of Sriracha to the meat mixture.  Won't be making again.

I thought these were excellent. The only thing I recommend is to chop the peppers extra small, otherwise the meat has a hard time staying together and the big chunks are not good.

This is a great way to use ground turkey. I fallowed the recipe but just added more Tabasco. We loved it.
