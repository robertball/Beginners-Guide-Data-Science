Very yummy!  Quick and super easy to make.  The oreo cookies add a nice subtle crunch to the bark.

This was fantastic, I used some milk chocolate, some white chocolate, and some dark chocolate. I left my cookie pieces a little too big so the end result was thicker, but everyone liked it. I mixed my peanutbutter into the white chocolate, and I put the pan outside. Since I live in Alaska the chocolate was hardened in just a few minutes so this recipe took almost no time at all. I put the pieces in christmas colored chinese take out style boxes and gave them as gifts. They were very pretty and a big hit!

This was easy, fun, and when you break up the bark you are thereby forced to eat the little bits that break off!

This recipe is very good but not really extra special.  Great if you just want something easy.  I did not care for the peanut butter taste.  I may make again someday but will leave it out.  Again, good, but you can search and find something better.

The word "heavenly" doesn't even begin to describe how delicious this is! Oh, my gosh, there was none left over at the Christmas party! It was a huge hit and I adore it! I couldn't keep my hands off of it!

I made this today and it is DELICIOUS!  And so very easy!  I used Trader Joe's chocolate sandwich Jo Jo cookies, half a bag of semi-sweet choc chips and half a bag of white chocolate chips.  The peanut butter adds such flavor.  I am looking forward to adding it to our holiday gatherings!  I'm sure everyone will gobble it up.

This is really, really good. And the best part is that it's so easy to make!
It's best right from the fridge. Definitely will make again.
