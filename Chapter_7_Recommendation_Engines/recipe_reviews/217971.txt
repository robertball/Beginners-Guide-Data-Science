I am enjoying a solitary evening of "recipe roaming", and planned on having a glass of wine. However, I came across this recipe, and decided it looked too Strawberrylicious to pass up. I cut the recipe to serve one (ok, two), and am enjoying it now! I'm a big fan of strawberry & pineapple combinations for smoothies, and let me tell you, the lime juice really adds a lot to brightening up the flavors in this daquiri. I did use some  frozen pineapple in addition to the juice, as I had just a bit left over from something else. I elimitated the ice since the frozen fruit served that purpose. Mmm! Strawberrylicious is right! Enjoy!

These were fantastic, but with the sweetened pineapple juice, I omit the sugar to keep them from being overly sweet!  If I'm out of juice, I'll just use frozen strawberries and a banana for some sweetness.

Excellent!  We do not do drinks or cocktails very often, but this frozen concoction was a great treat during the summer months.  We'll be having it again this summer, I'm sure.

I thought this was just ok, but my husband really enjoyed it. I will probably stick to my traditional recipe.

Really wanted to like this but it just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I added extra sugar and it still didn't turn out like what you get in restaurants.

This was awesome.  Drank while floating around in the pool.  Only change...we added ice to fill the blender for a frozen taste. Yum.
