Mmmm!  This recipe is perfection!  I knew it would turn out well just by smelling the batter.  I deleted the butter-flavored extract because I don't like having to use artifical ingredients (plus I didn't have any!) :-)  I also added about a cup of raisins.  The tea bread came out dark, spicey, moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Careful, though! Test it well before taking it out of the oven.  I had to bake my two loaves for 65 minutes.  Perhaps because the temperature was 325.  Nevertheless, it is a delight! Oh, yes...I also used my leftover jack-o-lantern to make the puree for this tea bread.  I'm glad I still have some puree left.  Think I know what I'll do with it! :-)

This is a great bread/cake, and I sometimes substitute boiled sweet potatoes for pumpkin, in the same amount.  I also use only one and a half cups of sugar and leave out the mace and butter-flavor extract entirely, as I cannot get either of those ingredients.  This recipe makes a great spice bread that stays moist in an air-tight container.  Everyone who has tasted it loves it.

Looked and smelled good but probably my least favorite pumpkin bread recipe. Had a slight metallic aftertaste, which might be because of all the spices or extracts.

This is a great recipe for fresh pumpkin, however I think the spices should have been in teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  That said, I reduced the spices, added fresh chopped cranberries, chopped walnuts and 1 ripe banana for a thicker texture, and it was delicious!  It's not too sweet - perfect for afternoon tea or coffee or an evening snack with some decaf!

The bread was tender and moist, but there was too much cloves for our taste.

Something tastes ''off" but I'm not sure what. My oldest likes this so I will continue to make it until I find something better.
