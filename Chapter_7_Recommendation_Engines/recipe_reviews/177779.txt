This is really good! I grilled the chicken in season all season salt, pepper, and garlic salt, those flavors really mixed well into the sauce. Also I cooked it in a tablespoon fat free butter spray,instead of the Vegetable oil, cut down alot on the fat. Saving fat from that I added some cheese on top of the chicken and sauce then covered for it to cook, or be super healthy and leave it off, it's still low fat with the cheese and super delicious!

This is really good!  I used olive oil instead - and used 2 T.  I also seasoned the chicken with lawry's season salt and a little garlic powder.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth.  This is going in my collection of recipes!

I sauteed strips of chicken in olive oil and some garlic. Seasoned it with Season All. This was good with some steamed rice and made a great hot lunch for my family. And hubby was expecting a cold sandwich. LOL. Great quick meal.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish!! I also seasoned the chicken with season all, garlic salt, and ground black pepper. And my fiance is now a huge fan -- I may need to make it again pretty soon!!

Great overall recipe, endless potential for variations!  Only thing I changed was to add 1/2 ts. fresh minced garlic into the mushroom sauce for the final 5 minutes, since the hubby loves garlic.  Fantastic!

Wonderful, fast and easy.  Just the meal you want for a busy night.
I used olive oil instead of vegetable and sauted one tablespoon of garlic before adding my chicken.
I left my chicken on low in its sauce for about 20 to absorb the flavor.  It was tender and quite tasty.
My family as well as myself enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.
Thank you for sharing.

Excellent and fast! I only made a few changes first I cooked the chicken in Olive Oil then I seasoned it with Lawrys Salt and Garlic Salt. Also it only made enough to feed my husband, 3 yr old and myself so I would definitely recommend doubling.

My husband loves this! Asks for this at least twice a week. I make mash potatoes or rice with it and we use the remaining gravy from the chicken for the side. It's wonderful!

Loved this! I cut the chicken into really small pieces after cooking it.. I added a can of mushrooms while the chicken was cooking and also instead of using rice I mixed penne noodles in with it! Delicious something I will be making in the near future my kids loved it. So simple and pleasing!

Not a bad recipe.  I sliced the chicken breasts into strips, dipped in egg, and rolled in gluten-free bread crumbs.  I fried them in olive oil first, then returned them to the pan and added gluten-free Cream of Mushroom soup and simmered on low for five minutes until the soup started to thicken (no need for milk with g-free soup).   For seasoning I added garlic powder, paprika, and white pepper and then served it over jasmine rice.  A quick, filling meal for a working mommy.

I make this all the time when I"m in a pinch for dinner. If you use low-fat CoM soup, it's actually not that fattening. I season the chicken with some cajun spice and Old Bay to give it some extra kick.

Great recipe! Made some changes as others have. Sauteed onions and mushrooms then added the mushroom soup and milk while chicken was browning.  Used garlic salt and more pepper than specified.  Good flavor and quick and easy.
