This was AMAZING.  I had a party for 100, and got most of my recipes from this site.  THIS one was a huge hit - there were many people coming up to me asking me what was in them.  I almost felt guilty for them being so simple!!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this.  A little fiddly, but worth every minute spent!  (lots of off-cuts left over too for nibbling on whilst you do other stuff!!!)

Instead of cutting them into wheels, I simply cut each roll in half for a new twist to traditional salami roll ups. I too chopped up the green onions, making the roll ups much easier to bite into. Adding a dash of crushed red pepper to the cheese/cream cheese mixture gives added flavor!

very quick and easy...the onion certainly adds to the flavor, however, next time i will chop it up as the other reviewer suggested.  my two year old kind of had a hard time biting all the way through. tasty!

Yummy.  I added pickles rather than onions to mine.  I had a similar recipe that tasted good but the look was off.  When I combined with this one I had much better results.

These tasted ok.  Nothing really wrong with the recipe - I made exactly as the recipe stated.  The cheeses made it very heavy and I had other appetizers on hand that were finished while I had quite a bit of the Ham Roll Ups left over.

This recipe did not bowl me over, and I noticed
that most of my guests had one but didn't take
seconds.  It was my own opinion that the green
onion overpowered the ham.  If I made this again,
I might use less onion.

A very easy recipe to make and my entire family loved it. I think the green onions make the difference.

I am asked to bring these rolls to every party I go to.  I use Carl Buddig Honey Ham.  I soften the cream cheese and throw in the whole bag of shredded chedder (not melted).  I add at least a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and red pepper flakes.  I also dice the green onion.  Very good.

Yum. I varied this by using tortillas to extend the servings. Fresh red pepper, diced, was yummy in the filling when I ran out of ham.

These are always a big hit when I make them.  sometimes i add dry ranch dressing mix,  the kids love them this way.   They are also very good if you omit the onion and use vegetable cream cheese instead of plain.

I use dill pickle spears sliced in half lengthwise in place of the onion (tried onion once...pickles are much better) and now this is my most requested recipe.  Tip: freeze the rolls before cutting and it becomes much easier.

I made this for a party at work, and the rolls were all gone before I could turn around...and everyone wanted more!  I didn't melt the cheese together, just mixed it in, and I only used one bag of cheddar cheese.  However, if you like your ham rolls thin you may want to either reduce the cream cheese or buy another pack of ham, because this makes a lot of filling.

Everyone always loves this recipe. I only use 2 blocks of cream cheese. I also add Mrs. dash for a bit more coloring. I haven't tried these 'naked', I always roll them up in sundried tomato basil wraps.

I like these with sweet gherkin pickles rolled in the center instead of green onions. They give a nice crunch and a bit of a flavor surprise. Maybe I spread my cheese thinner than everyone else, but I found I had way too much filling.

I made 80 servings of these for a wedding reception this weekend. I exchanged the onion for Claussen kosher dill slices (cut into strips) and I added a little dry ranch dip mix for extra flavor. They were attractive and tasty!

I tried this recipe for a house warming party, and everyone loved it.  I diced the green onion so that it wasn't over powering for some people.  I also didn't melt the cheddar cheese, I just added it to the cream cheese.  It was a big hit!

I made this dish for an office pot luck and everybody loved it. I'm the one in the office who usually brings soda, so I was quite proud of myself.  One thing that I changed was I only used 2 8oz packages of cream chese and one of them was reduced fat. It was great!

I made these for a 4th of July party. I used a 1/2 lb. of ham, and a 1/2 lb. of hard salami instead of a full lb. of ham to mix things up. The guests at the party said that they enjoyed the flavor very much, but that there was too much cheese filling in each one. I just sort of slathered it on while I was making them, so I'll be more careful next time with how much filling I use.

Very easy!  If you're a garlic lover, add a clove of minced garlic to the cream cheese mixture.  Yummy.  We made them as an appetizer for my in-law's retirement party at our house, everyone liked them.

Easy to make, however I used sour cream and chive cream cheese to give it a little more zip, and finely chopped the green onions.

These were tasty and easy to prepare.  They really need to chill for a few hours in the fridge to bring out the flavors.

Look Great!  Very salty, next time I'll purchase low salt ham.  It would also help if on a no-salt cracker.  
-My cheese mixture wasn't smooth & melted after heating in microwave for 45 seconds.  I headed in 20 second increments attempting to get it smooth.  Unfortunately I heated it to much and had butterfat separate and needed to drain off.  Next time I would heat no more than 45 seconds more.  
-I only used the greens of the green onion (I used whites only in shrimp-macaroni salad).  It was perfect.  
-Refrigerate the logs to harden before slicing.  If not on a cracker, need to be a bit thicker, closer to 1/2 inch, to be able to pick up.

Krakus ham worked well because it's uniform in shape. I used 2 bricks cream cheese softened, mixed with 1 package dry Ranch mix and finely chopped onion.  Skipped the cheddar cheese.  Rolled with a pickle spear or roasted red pepper in the center.  Refrigerate for 1-2 hours before slicing. 

Also made a few flour tortillas rolled with the cheese mixture, turkey slice and roasted red pepper.

My ham was sliced too thick to roll and the cheese spread squished out.  I added chopped chives and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the cheese spread.  I spread it on tea sandwiches with a slice of ham and a sliced dill pickle on each one.  I got many compliments and requests for the recipe.

These are awesome. My mom has been making them for years. Super yummy and easy! We always use flour tortillas though. Tortilla, spread cream cheese, sprinkle chopped green onion, lay ham, and roll. Wrap up, refrigerate for a while, then slice and put on a serving dish. Don't forget to eat the ends ;)

This was such a hit I made it for a church meeting!  The only changed I made was I took suggestions off the comments and I added the chopped onions to the cream cheese mixture. This was a real crowd pleaser!

This recipe has never failed me. If you want to change it up a bit. try adding pickled asparagus instead of the green onions to the ham roll-ups. It's a nice change. When I make these, I usually do some of each. I've always had compliments. If you cut them into bite sized pieces, you can roll up the whole green onion inside the ham.

This was very bland for my tastes. I added some Ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese mixture and finely chopped black and green olives, before rolling all of it into flour tortillas and slicing them. They turned out very good that way!
