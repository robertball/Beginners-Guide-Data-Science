Thank you. My Thai soups lacked the depth of flavor I wanted, and this cured them. It never occurred to me to alter they way I made a broth out of the chicken. I typically make a broth out of whole chicken (and much more Western aromatics) once or twice a week for whatever I need stock for that week.  Now, if you could just post up a recipe for that yellow curry sauce (often served with chicken and potato), my life would be complete!

Amazing!! I couldn't find Kaffir lime leaves in time, so I subbed in lime zest.  The broth turned out fabulous and made my Tom Yum soup delicious.  The chicken itself, was also amazing! I used half of the chicken in my coconut curry recipe and saved the other half to use later.  It was very tender and flavorful, great just to munch on.
