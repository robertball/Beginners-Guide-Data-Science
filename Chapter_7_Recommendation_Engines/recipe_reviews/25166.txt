I absolutely love this dish. I have had it a few times on trips to Rome when I'm getting desperate for a vegetable dish. Veggies in Rome are so expensive we usually do without.  When I fix this dish I do as the Romans do; saut√© a small minced onion in butter for a few minutes, remove the onion  and save in a small bowl. Add another TBS of butter to the pan, then add your other ingredients and only cook for about a minute and a half, strain into a colander, dip it quickly into cool water for just a second to stop the cooking but not really cool it, return it to your pan and add the onion and mix together. Keep it in a warm spot on your stove uncovered till ready to assemble with your Radicchio leafs just before your ready to serve your meal so the leafs will remain crispy.  Please don't over cook the any of the peas, the dish will be spoiled! The peas should all "pop" slightly when bitten into. Perhaps this is why the dish in Rome is so expensive about 8 EU, it must be monitored to come out right.  Well worth the effort!

This pea combination is exactly what I had in mind to accompany salmon for Valentine's Day dinner. The edible bowl is such a nice touch for the presentation. I will go with the fresh peas this spring, although I didn't want to wait, and it is delightful with frozen peas and fresh sugar snaps even before spring arrives. Thank you!

I made this as directed except I used frozen peas that I added frozen so they'd stay crisp. The sweet onion gave the dish a nice flavor without being as strong a typical onion taste. The dish didn't sweep me off my feet, but it's a nice sort of "backup singer" for a stand-out main dish.
