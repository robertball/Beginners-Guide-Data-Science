I think it would have tasted better had I made it correctly. I followed the recipe religiously, so it wasn't that I missed out, added or changed an amount of any ingredient. It could be that the recipe is flawed, but I think it more likely my novice baking skills are to blame. The lemon flavor didn't shine through and the cake turned out very dense. It sounded so good!

Never baked a mochi cake before and even with a blended flour (we had Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 Baking Flour) this was delicious and very reminiscent of mochi to us. Had to sub lemon juice for extract as I don't typically stock extract; seemed to work overall, just milder lemon flavor.  Will make again like this, just with  extra lemon juice & fresh zest next time.
