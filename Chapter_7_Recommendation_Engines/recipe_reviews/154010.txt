There is something special about this chili!  I just made it tonight, and it might be my favorite chili recipe I've ever tried!  I followed the directions almost exactly with the exception of substituting Morningstar Farms soy crumbles for the beef, and I omitted the beef bouillon to make the chili vegetarian friendly.  It was so easy to make and was low maintenance once it was simmering on the stove.  The potatoes added such a nice texture and flavor to it, and the pinch of nutmeg + sugar added just enough complexity to it without making it fall into a Cincinnati category of sweetness.  I served it with shredded cheddar cheese and multi-seed flatbread crackers.  It will become a staple recipe in my household!

I just tried this recipe and I feel like something was left out - liquid.  Once ingredients were drained, it turned out looking more like goulash than chili.  I decided not to drain the diced tomatoes and after cooking with a lid on for an hour, it became moist and delicious!  Will definitely make again.

This is good soup.  Very very close to my grandmother's recipe.  She used fresh potatoes and diced them, but otherwise its the same.  They often cooked this in a dutch oven hanging over a fire when they camped.  Yum!

This was very good. But, don't expect it to taste like regular chili. We ate it with sour cream and cheddar and I only wished that I had made more. The kids and hubby loved it.

We accidentally bought 1 pound of beef chuck... but not ground. We cut it up into small chunks and it was really good. I liked the texture it added. Wonderful!

This is fantastic, comfort chili! My family of all ages loves it, including babies and toddlers. Instead of plain canned diced tomatoes, I use Hunt's Seasoned Diced Tomato Sauce for Chili which really gives the flavor a punch. I also make an enormous batch to freeze and take out as needed, because it does defrost with out losing integrity.

So for everyone who said it needed more liquid, you are right.  The recipe was altered a bit after I uploaded it.  The only thing that should be drained is the potatoes.  Everything else, yes including the beans, should keep the liquid that is in the can.  I mash the light red beans with the liquid.

Even with that, I'm glad everyone has enjoyed the recipe!!

This was a hearty dish and we were very pleased with the results.  The only change I made was to use fresh new potatoes instead of canned since I had them on hand.  Will make again.

Made this for my company Christmas party and it was a smash hit with my coworkers.  They're used to me making my regular chilli, but I thought why not change things up. Love this recipe

This was OK. My office had a potluck for St Paddy's day and the only item on the list nobody signed up for was chili. I doubled the ingredients, and used fresh peeled and thinly sliced russet potatoes. I did not use oil, as ground beef produces its own fat when sautéed. I seasoned the meat, onions and garlic with McCormick all beef seasoning and sautéed them until the meat was brown then put all ingredients in a crock pot ( I scooped them out of the pan with a slotted spoon to drain the grease). I left it on low overnight, and stirred it a few times before bed to ensure the bouillon and other flavors were evenly distributed. I did halve the sugar, per other reviews. It was ready to bring to work in the am. I added quite a bit of salt to the meat and also the crock pot (4 or 5 big pinches of kosher salt). I was first worried about not having enough liquid, but then realized the canned tomatoes are not to be drained and that sufficed. Nobody at work knew that I made the chili but everyone was raving about it. I personally thought it was kind of bland and not spicy at all. Bland even though served with garlic/butter ritz crackers, green onions, shredded cheddar and sour cream. Next time I will taste it before serving (I was in a hurry) and probably add more chili powder or some sort of seasonings to enhance the flavor.

Loved the recipe, but made a few minor changes to make it more like a chili and less like a stew. First, I doubled the meat and dry ingredients (spices, sugar etc...), while keeping the wet ingredients the same. I did drain the beans, potatoes and tomatoes, though. On a side note, the picture above seems to show the light beans not mashed...in my version I thorougly mashed them. On a whim I entered my version of this recipe into my office chili competition and won first place. Everyone loved it.

This is a good chili, but as mentioned elsewhere not if you're craving a little heat. I didn't drain the tomatoes (I used herbs and spiced diced) and didn't drain either of the beans, and that was plenty of liquid for this dish. Used ground chicken in deference to the non red meat eater in the house. Also used a large russet and would use two next time, liked the potatoes in the mix. Good eats. Served with grated cheddar and a big dinner roll.
