A very saucy sauce! We tried this with grilled salmon. I followed the recipe to a T. We thought the sauce was sassy and bright. It definitely fulfills that need for zip which salmon produces in the mouth. We liked it. I don't know if it will become our #1 for salmon, but it was definitely good and something different. Thanks!

I was a little unsure about this one, but it turned out great - the flavors really complemented the salmon. I found that scaling the recipe down to 4 servings was sufficient for 2 average sized filets. Thanks!

Really wonderful!  Had to use it with chicken as I did not have any salmon. It turned out just wonderful!

One would look at this sauce and think it sounds horrible but let me assure you that this is one of the best sauces to pour on your barbeque salmon. Just not the same without it now.

Some leave the skin of the salmon on as they grill to maintain the integrity of the fish while on the grill cooking it 4-10 minutes on the one side.  I took the skin off and used a grilling basket basting both sides with the sauce and cooking 4-5 minutes per side.  Like others when I first looked at the ingredients I didn't see the wonderful flavor produced by same.  This is a keeper!

We scaled the recipe down to 4 servings for two salmon fillets and grilled them, my only change was Dijon mustard in place of the yellow.
