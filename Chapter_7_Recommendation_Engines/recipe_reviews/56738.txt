Oh my goodness! These things are amazing! I had my doubts at first but...wow. I made a bunch of them ahead of time and kept them in my fridge overnight. ( I found 1/2 brick of 8oz. cream cheese covered one pita bread.)I then cooked them in my toaster oven the day of my party. ( I had other things baking at the time so I couldn't use my oven) I baked them longer than called for in the recipe, as I like my bacon brown and slightly crisp. I accidentally forgot the last batch and the bacon burned....but even that didn't hurt these things! They were still delicious! Thanks Machenzie!

Very, very good. I partly cook the bacon before making so it comes out fully cooked.

I also agree that this recipe only needs 1 package of cream cheese. Something my husband and I have done with this is to add food coloring for holidays. So, when the Colts played the superbowl, we dyed the cream cheese blue, and for Halloween, we dyed it orange, etc. It's a fun way to make these really festive!

I substituted the spreadable (garlic and herb) cream cheese that comes in a tub.  Before rolling up I placed a hot pepper ring in some and a little salsa in others.  OMG delish!  Also, place roll-ups on cookie rack over foil covered baking sheet.  (You can easily turn them over and they wont be soggy with grease. Easy cleanup too)

I also pre-cooked the bacon. I added freeze-dried chives and onions to the cream cheese and it added some flavor. I baked the pieces in the oven on 425 for about 5 min on each side. (I like my bacon crispy.) Do a test first to see what works best for your oven.

SO SO SO GOOD,I added a bit of fresh chives to the cream cheese and it was wonderful just a little extra flavor. And I agree with others to cook the bacon part way first.

I have been making something similar to these for yrs, but I use 1 loaf of Wonder white bread, and 8 oz. cream cheese left at room temp. Cut all of the crust off bread. Spread each slice of bread lighly with cream cheese. Cut slice of bread in half and roll up. Wrap a half of pre-cooked bacon around each half. No need to use toothpicks, just place on baking sheet with seem side down, and bake 5-10 min., or until bread starts to brown. Absolutely delicious :)

Everything tastes better with bacon. I make something similiar, with jalepenos, sliced in half length wise and seeded, stuffed with the cream cheese, and then wrapped with bacon. So good and spicy.

These are so FANTASTIC!  I had pitas I wanted to get rid of, so I made this.  I used thick-cut bacon and they were to LIVE for!  Thanks so much!

I have also made these for years and and like one other reviewer use Wonder Bread instead of pita.  Also use pineapple cream cheese which is so good.  Using a broiler pan (I use the disposable)  allows the extra bacon grease to flow away from the roll-up.  These are a #1 hit whenever made.

These were alright. Nothing fancy and the bacon was the best part. I did pre cook the bacon a little and used 2 wholemeal pitas from the freezer and 1 pkt bacon. I think these would be better to bake in the oven and also the cream cheese needs SOMETHING in the middle of it - like a swirl of sweet chilli sauce to cut throught that thick, plain flavour, plus pepper (no salt because of the bacon). I used sweet chilli to dip them in. Dh said they were kind of strange, but most of the family ate them, except for bubs and 3 yr old. If you soak your bacon in water to defrost, you'll need to add salt as soaking it leaches out the salt. Wouldn't make again, simply because they tasted a bit strange --- they were actually a lot better when they weren't broiled, but with just the half cooked bacon wrapped around them.

this was lunch for me and the hubby today while we watched a movie. i wanted something kinda light since i work a different shift than usual today and i didnt want to be tired. i made 2 batches of 8 of these the first ones to the recipe and they were good but the bacon wasnt quite as crisp as id like. for the 2nd batch i just chopped the bacon and added a handful ( maybe a scant 1/4 c) and mixed it into the pita slices and baked it. i liked it better this way because i could get my bacon really crispy and the onion added something i thought was missing. very good both ways depending on what you like.

I really really loved these. I added some jalapenos on a few of them and really enjoyed that as well.

loved it! but the bacon should definitely be partly cooked before hand, I did it both ways & the bacon is a little mushy if you dont pre-cook a little! but otherwise a really fun snack!

Too much grease from the bacon.  I added fresh chives to the cream cheese mixture, too.

It was a good recipe, but I think next time I would probably add more seasonings to the cream cheese. I did dice up green and red peppers plus onion and sauteed them. Sprinkled on the cream cheese layer not too thickly since rolling these up. Maybe mixing them in the cream cheese would work better. But overall tasty, but you have to love bacon because that was the predominant taste.

I used two large pitas and 1 tub of herb and garlic cream cheese and 1 pound of bacon and that made 30 roll ups! Pre cooking the bacon a little is a must for me,  these are always a hit!

I made 4 other bacon appetizers for the holiday and this one turned out just okay.  I think it would be better with a flavored bread (cheesy, onion ect..) to give it more flavor.  Easy to make but not high on my remake list.

So simple and So delicious.  Served at a dinner party, using vegetarian bacon.  My husband, who is a meat lover, loved them along with everyone else.  Only after his third did he find out I used fakin bacon!

Here I go to make some more right now.
