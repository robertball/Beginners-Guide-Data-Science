MARVELOUS!  I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It gave such a nice presentation.  I crushed the vanilla wafers by putting them in a zip lock bag and using a rolling pin.  When I dished the dessert out, I sprinkled the top with extra crushed vanilla wafers I had set aside.   It was the hit of the night.  Thank you CNM CATERING for such an awesome recipe!

A user recommended this one to me on the recipe board and since it was her recipe I couldn't resist giving it a try. Boy and am I glad that I did. I couldn't find the banana pudding flavor so I bought the cheesecake flavor and it still tasted light and delicious. This is one of those desserts that is great just the way it is but I think you could modify to suit your own tastes. I would love to see what might happen if I added a can of well drained crushed pineapple. Fantastic. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is so tasty! Family loved it! I used a 16 oz pound cake because that was all they had at the store and hey who doesn't like a little extra pound cake? This was simple and very delicious. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Not a huge fan of banana desserts, but this recipe changed my mind. I made it for a company cookout and the bowl was smoking.......... Thats how fast everyone ate it up. A couple changes made mine a crowd favorite. Use french vanilla pudding instead and slice bananas into medium bite size cubes. You can also use coolwhip and chess cookies to make it easier.

I substituted vanilla flavored pudding mix and the recipe was very delicious -- everyone raved about it and wanted more... There was one problem with the assembly process. No instructions are given as to what size trifle bowl is needed. I have an 8" trifle bowl and I ended up with far too much whipped cream using the recommended amount in the instructions.

I quadrupled the recipe for a church dinner, and I thought it tasted good, but I would recommend using vanilla pudding mix instead of banana flavor, which to me has an odd taste. I used Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream, and I did not use the vanilla wafers. It was an easy dessert to serve to a crowd, and I liked the pound cake as a base. I added caramel sauce to the layers of pound cake and drizzled it on top.

Delicious! I forgot to buy vanilla wafers so I built the dessert without them. I powdered the top with a little nutmeg. It was SO good. I'll be keeping these ingredients on hand in case I need to throw together a quick and easy dessert!

Made this for a potluck and was a real hit!  I used a 16 oz pound cake and sliced the bananas on top of the pudding (3 total).  Instead of vanilla wafer crumbs, I used toasted pecans which were good, will try it with the crumbs next time.

As I expected, this was SOOO yummy!  We all had seconds and my husband is talking about getting more.  This was very easy to make and would also be good (in my opinion) with vanilla pudding.  A great way to use leftover pound cake.  This will be made again in our house, I think it would be great for parties.

AWESOME and soooo easy! Not too sweet but flavourful and delish! I used a marble pound cake. I did use way more bananas (3-4) and had a layer of sliced bananas instead of mixing into the pudding. Next time I would like to try with a drizzle of chocolate inbetween and on top. It would also be yummy using strawberries and chocolate pudding/ cake as a variation!

needed more fruit - I added 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1 cup raspberries. 2 cups of heavy cream whipped up was plenty and added 1/2 of the powered sugar.

Was a great recipie! I made my own pudding though instead of using the packages of instant! I put the whip cream into a big ziploc and snipped the end of it and pipped it into the trifle, so I would get the perfect layers from the outside! It was the best looking trifle I've made yet! yum!

Sinfully delish!  Loved the combination of pound cake and vanilla wafer cookies.   I used vanilla pudding, but added extra bananas.  It is a good thing I had  family dinner to take this to for sharing or I would inhale the whole thing myself!   Thanks for sharing your recipe, CNM!

Great recipe!! Not a banana dessert fan but this was superb! I do agree with the others though, it makes a lot of whipped cream so next time i will only make half of what it calls for. Very yummy, family loved it at thanksgiving dinner.

best trifle ever, the cream makes all the difference.  I used french vanilla pudding as that's what i had on hand, and added a bit of cinnamon to the cream, rave reviews.  this recipe doesn't need any tweaking at all, cinnamon is just a preference i have.

I make a very similar version of this trifle.  The only real difference is that I substitute spice cake for the pound cake.  It brings out the banana flavor and gives the recipe a kick!

When I saw this recipe I thought: 'oh, not more bananas, but it is five star. Okay, I guess I will try it.' And that was the best decision I had made all week! Even if your not a banana person, one bite of this amazing trifle will take your mouth on a journey,  and change your mind about bananas, as it did with me and my family.

Great recipe. I think it needs some chocolate though! But what recipe doesn't? My daughter and I liked it. My sons did not. I just had a dish on day 2 and it wasn't soggy like I had feared. However, I probably wouldn't make it too far in advance. And make it to share because it is very banana-y. And it makes a lot.

This was super easy and delish with a few changes!! I used 1 box of vanilla pudding and 1 box of cheesecake pudding. I also used 3 bananas and a 16oz pound cake. The whipped topping could be cut in half as it would not all fit and I had half a bowl left. Everyone raved and asked for more!! Would even be good with a can of crushed pineapple added I think. TY for a GREAT recipe!!!

Ok I have to say this dessert is awesome. I made it for 2 different pot lucks during the holidays last year and it was the first dessert gone at both events. I even won a contest at the second one for best dessert. Lol, I didn't even know we were having a contest. I won $50.00 WooHoo

Just OK, followed directions exactly. It's fine as long as there is no chocolate cake around as an alternate.

I love this recipe because it is so good and simple.  I am always asked to bring this to our FRG meetings.  The only problem I have found with it, is that I cannot get the whipping cream to form stiff peaks! I have tried and tried, but couldn't get.  So I substituted the whipping cream for Cool Whip. Any tips for the whipping cream?

really really good- warning: eat right away---the whipped cream gets runny when left overnight.

I didn't have time to make whipped cream so I used cool whip instead. I also omitted the wafers because I thought they would get soggy. I only had vanilla and cheesecake pudding mixes (mix-up at the store) so I used those....it was delicious! Not too sweet-just perfect! Thanks for the simple recipe!

I did make a few changes. Used 3 bananas 1 pk vanilla pudding and 1 pk banana. I think it would have been too much banana flavor. I put 1/2 cup grated TOASTED almonds in the pudding mixture. I didn't use all the whipping cream. I used about 3 of the 4 cups as listed. I will make again the same way.

Holy cow!  This was amazing!  I made it for the first time today and brought it to work.  It was a big hit.  So simple to make.  I used angel food cake instead of pound cake because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I'll probably whip the cream longer to thicken it up more, but the taste can't be beat.  Very nice trifle :)

it was good, the poundcake sort of took the sweetness and richness a bit over board. i think i'd like it better without the poundcake. you definitely have to add atleast 3 -4 banana's though.

This has become my signature recipe to make for family functions. Instead of the vanilla wafers, I switched it up for crushed graham crackers and made the pound cake from scratch. (Simple butter cake recipe) Coworker of mine had another person's banana trifle and called theirs an imitation of mine that wasn't very good! So proud!

I made this for Mother's Day this year for dessert...AMAZING -- Everyone went back for seconds (and there were other desserts to chose from)! 
It held up nicely for a 20 minute car ride as well (in a closed cooler, where it couldn't slide around that much, that was packed with ice aroun it), since we were celebrating MD at my brother's house this year! LOVED it! Thank You!!

Made this for an Easter dessert for a family gathering of 24. I used two small boxes of sugar-free vanilla pudding (I went by serving size, not by weight), and I used 3 sliced bananas due to the size of my trifle bowl. I used "bite sized" store-brand vanilla wafers, and they weren't much smaller than normal size. The only thing I would change is to add a note to "trim off all brown sides of the pound cake before cutting into cubes," becuase in my opinion, I prefer to see the brown vanilla wafers, and I prefer the pound cake to be a nice yellow color, but I'm my own worst critic, and nobody complained. This was very well-received, and it's on my "keeper" list for potlucks. Next time I'll make my own pound cake a day or two in advance, since the saralee brand contains high fructose corn syrup, which isn't good for anyone. Thanks to CNM for a wonderful presentation!

I used vanilla pudding instead of banana pudding.  Used the large tub of Cool Whip instead of making whipped cream.  I also used a loaf plus 1/3 of store bought pound cake.  It was amazing!!  Will definitely make again.

Outstanding!  Made for a holiday open house and those who like banana LOVED this. Four cups of cream was way too much for my standard-sized trifle bowl though; next time I will use three cups with about a 1/2 cup of sugar. Also, I'll put most of the vanilla wafers on the first layer; I had too much left over after covering the top.

I  thought I would try something different for the holidays.  I have my own banana pudding recipe that everyone loves.  The family did not care for this as much.  They said it was OK, but the pound cake in it was over the top.

Followed recipe exactly and it was easy and well liked.  Makes a lot, more than fit in my trifle bowl.   Homemade whipped cream is easy and elevates it. If you use store bought whipped cream, it's just instant pudding and cool whip with some cake.

This recipe was so easy to make, created a lovely presentation and was delish!  My trifle bowl went missing so i split the recipe in 2 glass bowls.  I also used Cool Whip to save time and avoid chance i would  mess up the cream.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this but used store bought pound cake to save time and added crushed health bars along with the crushed vanilla wafers which i did with a zip lock bag and rolling pin.  It was delicious and the homemade whipped cream versus using cool whip or redi whip made it even better and was easy to do.  Looks fancy but not hard to make.  Got many compliments and will definitely make again.

I didn't make any changes.   It was very delicious as it is.  And it looked good too!  I made it for Thanksgiving as no one likes anything pumpkin in my family.   So, after reading Allrecipes, I decided this looked good and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  So I made it.  But I didn't have a Trifle bowl so I used a plain glass bowl which worked out fine.  Like I said, "it was DELISCIOUS!"  FIVE STARS GOOD!

I love to make trifles to take to get togethers, because their presentation is so fun! Everyone will try it, because their so pretty! Well, this was the hit of the UFC fight party!! Most everyone went back for seconds! I followed the directions exactly, except for the pound cake. I purchased a cinnamon sugar loaf from Costco from their bakery (in a pack of 3, so I can make this two more time!). The cinnamon made it especially yummy! Oh, and I used 3 bananas instead of 2, and it wasn't too much. Definitely one of my favorite trifles ever!!

I make this recipe every 4th of July and its a big hit. I Jello French Vanilla pudding, and 2% milk. I also use Nilla Wafers instead of pound cake and Fat Free Cool Whip .. I also cut up a can of pineapple in its own juice.

The recipe was a hit! I followed it mostly, only varying when it came to the Nilla Wafers. I put a layer of them around the dish and in between whipped cream and the second layer of pound cake.

to save time I used 8 oz cool whip instead of whipping my own cream. I sliced 3 bananas and layered them on the pudding rather than mixing it in. I used 13 oz of pound cake because that's the size I had. It was fantastic. Next time I'd crumble the cookies instead of crushing them... I think they were too fine this time.

Fantastic! I'm famous for Nilla wafer banana pudding recipe. I have now replaced it with this. I used the Publix vanilla pound cake. It was delish!

Very easy but makes a lot!! Next time I will cut the recipe in 1/2. While this turned out great, next time I will change the flavor of the pudding, possibly using vanilla pudding, while adding walnuts and possibly pineapple tidbits, but this is a great recipe that can by changed-up to whatever flavors you like.

I have never rated anything, but this is WORTHY!  This was a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party.  YUMMY!  The whipped cream is TO DIE FOR
