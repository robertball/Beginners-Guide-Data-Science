This was a great recipe!  The chicken was excellent.  I  cooked it without the mopping sauce but I will definitely try it with the mopping sauce next time

Make two of these for Thanksgiving--- excellent results! Very moist, nice light citrus/garlicky taste- very moist. Sort of a crazy recipe stuffing all those limes and lemons into the chicken- but it worked great. The mopping sauce is highly recommended. If you are only doing one chicken you could cut the mopping sauce recipe in half and you would still have plenty of stuff to mop on the ole bird. Follow the cooking directions and you will have perfection.

Beer can chicken is awesome and I make it all the time. Today I found we were out of propane on the grill so I decided to use my infrared (NuWave) oven to prepare it. I also wanted to jazz up my normal recipe which is usually just rubbed with simple spices due to my picky kids. 
I used an almost 8 lb chicken so I doubled this recipe. Instead of putting lime/lemon in the cavity I squeezed the juices into the can and also put some spices into the can. I placed the fruit wedges next to the chicken in the oven. I cooked it slow & low on 50% power for about 3 hours. The meat was SO juicy and tender and FULL of flavor. I highly recommend this recipe and method for beer can chicken!

Meat was very moist, but not very flavorful for the amount of work involved in mopping sauce. Would not make this again. Too much work for a regular tasting chicken.

I chicken was moist it lacked flavor.
The next time, I will rub the dry seasoning between the skin and the meat.
