Made it as shown except used old fashioned oats (preferred). Perfect!
I grew up with a smaller pan, but liked the 9 X 13, which made it thinner.  Next time I may try it at 375 because I like a crispier crunchier topping.

The extra flour on the rhubarb ended up at the bottom.  The topping became more of a very thick batter and did not add that crunchy top that a crisp should have.  I will not make it again.

This is so good! Just like my grandma used to make. The only thing I would do differently is cut back the white sugar just a bit because I had a lot that sunk to the bottom and hardened.

Easy and great. Sweet enough with half the sugar it asks for in the rhubarb. I mixed in a bit of rolled oats in the topping.

Very nice dessert. Perfect blend of sweet and the sour Rhubarb.  If I was to make this again I would add a tbsp or so of water to the rhubarb before adding the topping just to make it a little juicier.  Personally, I prefer a topper that has rolled oats in it but having said that, this was a nice change.
