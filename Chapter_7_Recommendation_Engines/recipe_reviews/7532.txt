excellent!  I did cut the sour cream in half and cooked it for about an hour, then just shut the oven off and walked away from it until 5 hours later.  No cracks and very firm.

Next time I will omit the almond extract, it was a little overpowering for my family's taste.  I followed advice and used only 1.5 cups of sour cream for a thicker cheesecake, which worked beautifully.

Wow!  Great cheesecake and so simple.  I did cut the sour cream in half as I prefer a firm cake.  Decorated with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle-no one believed I made it!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

After baking for 35 mins at 375 it still looked way too soft, so I cooked it an additional 10 mins.  Let it cool, then chilled overnight.  When it was cut into the following day it ran - it never solidified.

I tried this and i'm thirteen years old. It was easy fun and the best cheescake recipe for a plain cheesecake easy to follow, but cut the sour cream in half for a lest tangy but just right sweet cake!

Actually I goofed on the recipe.  I didn't have a 9 inch pan (someone else had made a cake and was using it) and cut out the sour cream totally.  However, the end result was a smaller, but delicious cheesecake.

This recipe is one of the most delicious cheesecakes I have ever tasted, either made by me, or purchased anywhere!

THIS IS A FANTASTIC RECIPE, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. DO NOT BAKE AT 375 OR THE CAKE WILL CRACK. BAKE AT 300 IN A WATER BATH FOR 2 HOURS. THEN SHUT OFF THE OVEN AND LET SIT FOR ANOTHER HOUR. THEN LET COOL OFF ON COUNTER TOP. TRUST ME, THIS WILL WORK. I BAKED 3 THIS WEEK AND NOT ONE CRACK.

I made this recipe for my son's 21st birthday dinner.  It turned out fantastic - everyone raved!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews - 2 C of graham cracker crumbs and doubled the butter as well as increased cooking time by 10 minutes.  The filling was a little creamy rather than completely firm but the taste was great!

This recipe was yummy! After my boyfriend had some, things got pretty hot and heavy faster than a New York minute ;-). The cakes didn't firm up quite as much as I would have liked, and we used a premade crust instead of the one in the recipe. Overall, this recipe was fast, simple, and just the right pick-me-up for my party!

Good, although it is hard to get all the clumps out of the cream cheese with muscle only... I would recommend electric mixer for any cheesecake... Overall, though it is as rich as it should be... I love the walnuts in the crust!

I bake almost daily but this is only the third cheesecake I've made. The other two set perfectly (different recipes) but this one did not. I read reviews and also cut the sour cream in half and cooked longer. It still came out like soup but the edges were browning. I did spoon a little out to taste and it was yummy but obviously couldn't be eaten like that. I can't give this a higher rating if the recipe I'm rating needs extensive changing. I will definitely look for a new cheesecake recipe.

I have been making this cheesecake for 10 years. I printed this recipe when the site was still separated into cakerecipe.com. I've been looking for Ms Eleanor Johnson and the recipe again so I could review it properly: **************IT IS PERFECT!!!************** I will note that for this Christmas, I included little mini cheesecakes in my cookie tray gifts. I mixed the recipe as directed and lined a mini cupcake pan w/the mini paper liners (holiday themed in this case). I used a measuring teaspoon of the crust mix pressed into the bottom of each cup & then roughly 1/8 cup of the cheesecake batter. Baking time is greatly reduced to about 10 min - even rotating midway is a good idea. Some of them still sink a little in the center; nothing a single blueberry & compote won't cover (or strawberry or whatever). It made about 72 mini cheesecakes; not counting the spoonfuls my husband swiped while i wasn't looking.  Just my two cents. Wish I could issue more stars. Thank you thank you thank you.

Very glad I listened to other reviews and used half the amount of sour cream called for... this worked out great.  Also added just a little almond extract (maybe 1/4 tsp) and am glad i did that as well, tasted great as is.  Also recommend cooking 15 minutes at 400, and 45 at 200, cooks much better.  Overall though, a nice cheesecake recipe, family enjoyed it.

This recipe was wonderful. Not only to make a good NY cheesecake, the recipe is interchangeable with other flavors. For instance I made a WONDERFUL lemon cheesecake from this recipe by just cutting out the cinnamon and walnuts and just replacing the almond extract with lemon. You can do that with pretty much any good extract that you like. Although I suppose root beer extract would not be to good...but you never know. For the lemon cheesecake I also did a crust of graham crackers, it was lovely.

DESCENT. Recipe is easy. I only used 1 cup sour cream; that is all I had. It still turned our pretty good; I'd say descent. Topped it with blueberry filling/topping (Comstock) and without tasted good too. It did crack even when I used the mixer in its lowest setting. (You can't tell with topping.)

I did not change any of the ingredients. I did bake it for about 45 minutes, turned off the oven and left the cake in there for about 5 hours. AMAZING cheesecake! The texture, the flavor, everything was perfect. Okay, it cracked in the center. But no one noticed or cared.

I have a gluten allergy, so I omitted the crust alltogether. In Florida I had a gluten free cheesecake from Publix that was superb, but they don't even make them gluten free around here. This cheesecake was too sour. I probably should have cut the sour cream in half. I did omit the almond extract too, because I wanted a regular cheesecake. It tasted way to lemony for me. I think the lemony taste came from the sour cream.

this cheesecake is unbelievably creamy and delicious.  i did follow everyone's advice and used less sour cream and baked it a little longer, instead of 3 cups of sour cream i used 16 oz and i baked it for 45 min, and the middle still fell when cutting into it.

I'm not a cheesecake eater myself, and this being the first baked one I've made, it did not turn out properly...  It definately needs a longer cooking time.  My friend thought it was a no-bake cheesecake until I corrected him.  He said the flavour is there, but definately needs to be cooked longer.

This is a very smooth cheesecake.  The crust is delicious.  If you follow the recipe exactly, you won't go wrong.  Always comes out perfect - no splitting on the top.  I've recommended this recipe to my co-worker, who now makes this cheesecake for the office every now and then.  Great tasting, might be too rich for some people, but perfect for me.  Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe. The cooktime was not nearly enough, and there is something wrong in a cheesecake when it calls for more sour cream than cream cheese. It was sour and too runny. I would definetly not try this one again!

This cheesecake was excellant!  It was smooth and rich.  I used a mixed berry topping which was a great addition.  I have already been asked for the recipe twice.

great cheesecake. Served it to friends and it was gone! Only used 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of sugar (used sugar for fruit topping, so I didn't want the extra sweetness). I also used chopped almond nuts for the crust and worked really well. And baked for 50-55 minutes.

I used only 1 1/2 cups of sour cream as suggested, but it still tasted too "sour creamy" to me.  The crust was tasty.  Not bad, but overall not a great cheesecake.  I think I'll be sticking with my own New York cheesecake recipe.

Yummy. I prefer the filling a little firmer so I only used 1 cup of sour cream.  Everyone had seconds!

I chose to not make the crust. So, I bought one. It still tasted wonderful. I also only used half the sour cream and upped the baking time by about 10 minutes. My 18 month old wouldn't stop eating it!!

This is a good cheesecake. However, I did cut the sour cream down to 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find no cracks after baking!  Great topped with fresh strawberries!

I made this cheesecake with fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese and low fat Blue Bonnet maragarine.  It made it pretty tart, but it still tastes great with under half the calories of the original recipe!!  However, it makes enough for two 9in pie pans, so make extra crust.  Also, you have to cook it way longer than 35 minutes.  I would suggest about 50 minutes.  Otherwise, it's a good recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful.  The only change that I made was using 2 cups of crumbs for the crust and doubled the butter.

This is definitely a "New York style" cheesecake.  It was a hit for everyone that ate it

The walnuts and cinnamon add a great taste texture to the crust and the cream cheese mixture is very smooth and creamy.  I always get great reviews when I make this for my office treat day.

I LOVED this cheesecake!  My friends made comments like "best ever."  I used cinnamon graham crackers and cinnamon in the crust - a great result.  I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than specified because it was kind of soft.  Topped with fresh strawberries, mangoes and blueberries - an instant hit!

I've made this cake at least 25 times, usually with a fruit topping. This time I made it with a chocolate ganache. After I baked it, I left it in the refrigerator overnight. Then the next day I made the ganache and left it in the refrigerator overnight. The cake came out great. The people at work loved it.

I made this last night and followed the other reviews, and used half the sour cream. It turned out awful! I don't know if it was me, or the recipe but it just didn't taste right. I think perhaps the almond was too strong. The filling just wasn't the right consistency.

I have to give this a 4 only because the top cracked and the middle was very soft even after baking an additional 5 min.  I chilled it for several hours before serving and the middle was still very soft. I would increase cooking time but be careful the outer area doesn't dry too much.  The taste however was excellent and it was very easy to make.  12/13/03 Made a second time-cooking time seems to work at 55 min.  Texture was very good and cooked through.

This is delicious! I cut the sour cream to 1.5 cups as advised by other makers. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light sour cream with no problems. Mine cracked but I don't really mind- I eat cheesecake for the taste! Mmmm.

I really enjoyed this cheesecake.  The one I made should have probably been baked an additional 5 min. or so.  The center looked set when removed from the oven, however, when cut and served the center seemed a little too soft.  It started to collapse and cave in in just the middle.  I topped it with strawberries and was liked by all that tasted it.

I have made this twice. Followed the recipe exactly except I did have to bake it for an additional 10 minutes. I let it sit on the counter for about 20 minutes and then in the fridge all day. (About 7 hours.) Rave reviews each time. More of a light and airy cake versus a dense cheesecake.  DELICIOUS!! I may eperiment next time based on the reviews but is amazing as is.

I changed the recipe a bit,  like everyone else apparently did as well.  

The batter is DELICIOUS, but I added 1 pkg of cream cheese and used 2 cups of greek yogurt (I vanilla, 1 plain) rather than the sour cream.  I increased the cook time to 45 minutes.  Wow, it's beginning to look less and less like the original recipe.  I also used a shortbread crust rather than graham crackers. 

It's cooling off now (in the oven) and there is a small crack in the top.  It seems to have set up fine however.  Tomorrow's desert after dinner will be the real test.  I'm giving it 4 stars based on the batter.  If it sets up well when cooled, I'm sure it will be delicious and creamy.  If not, I'm reluctant to take any stars away because I made so many changes to it, it now barely resembles the original recipe.

This cheesecake was pretty good, however I did follow what the other reviewers were saying and put the sour cream in half and reduced the crumb crust a bit. Baked at 300 for a little over an hour.

I followed the recipe as it was exactly. I baked it for 60 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 6 hours and then i let it cook in room temperature for like 10 minutes and then i put it in fridge for about 7 hours and we cut the cake the cake was not solid at the from the middle to the bottom of the cake. The top part of the cake was good but for some reason the cake did not cook all the way. I thought it was because the cake didn't set in so i put it in the fridge overnight and the next day in the afternoon i check on the cake in the fridge it stayed the same as it did last night. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?

I was looking for a simple cheese cake, and this is the BEST!! This is my go to cheese cake!! I have made this one many times and get tons of compliments on the crust. I love the fact that there are walnuts and not just graham crackers in the crust, sets it apart from all others!! Not too rich with just the right taste!! This is a keeper!

Great! Makes me look good.  I did only half the sour cream and I reserved 1/4 the batter on the cheese cake and added 1 teaspoon of butter nut vanilla flavoring! OH YUM! Great recipe that is super easy!

I get raves and raves whenever I make this recipe.  I do improvise it a little.... 1 cup sour cream and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I also put pecans in the crust when I want to add a special touch.  Tonight I am using it to make mini cheesecakes with my muffin pan and muffin cups.

Quick and easy to make.  Not quite as dense as I usually like it, but still tasty.  Maybe a little less sour cream would help.  I baked mine an extra ten minutes because the middle was way too soft after only 40 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!!

Overall this was a very good cheesecake. It was my first time making one, and I was pleased with the results, although I thought it had too much of a sour cream taste and the baking time was off (perhaps my oven?). I baked it for an hour, instead of 35 minutes.
