Quick easy recipe with great flavors. I used fish sauce and beef broth to create the cornstarch sauce.

Pretty good.  I used pork since I didn't have beef, and created a sauce with fish and hoisin sauce since I didn't have oyster sauce.  Hubs really enjoyed it and we ate it over rice with egg rolls.  thanks for the recipe!

I liked it but the meat lacked flavor.  Next time  I'll marinate the meat in fresh minced onion, garlic, soy sauce  and some fresh minced ginger root, for at least an hour.  I'll also cook it first - good meat doesn't need 10 minutes.  Stir-frying over reasonably high heat for just a few minutes is enough, then set the meat aside and do the vegetables, add the sauce ingredients, then I'll add the meat back to the pan to heat it.  I will give it another try with the above changes.

The flavor is there after I marinated the steaks overnight, but the meat is way overcooked using these instructions. At this point it's basically overcooked pork. Nothing special, it's really just stir fry.

I used fresh onion, garlic, mushroom and added fresh ginger.  I did not have the flavor in the meat that I hoped for.  Next time, I will marinate in the oyster sauce overnight.

Apparently this is a versatile recipe, as I was missing several of the vegetables and forgot to add the soy sauce the second time and it still turned out great.  I used low sodium soy sauce on the meat and skipped thickening the oyster sauce.  My kids and husband ate it up.  Looking forward to following the recipe next time!

This was good but it was really salty, and I used reduced sodium soy sauce.

I used strips of boneless rib, minus mushrooms and red pepper.  Loved it!  I added sesame seeds for flair.
