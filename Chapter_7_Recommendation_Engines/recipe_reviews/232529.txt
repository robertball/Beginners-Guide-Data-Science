Couldn’t detect the addition of wine, even tho’ I used (substantially) more than the recipe called for. Therefore, if you’re a white wine drinker (and I am not) I would suggest you drink it instead and enjoy.  Still, this was quite nice, both in flavor and in eye appeal.  To keep feta-detesting Hubs happy I substituted ricotta salata  (I’ve psyched him into thinking there’s a HUGE difference).

This was easy to make while juggling a couple of other dishes.  I used a chardonnay and could taste it fine.  It did make a difference.  Overall, it was quite good and I will make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe! My 3 year old cannot get enough of these beans. I omit the bell pepper because he wouldn't eat it if it was in there. Sometimes when I don't have white wine or chicken stock, I just use water for the liquid and it still turns out great.

I used vegetable broth instead of white wine because that is what I had on hand. It was yummy, and the kids ate them, too!

I doubled the recipe to take to a Christmas gathering.  I'd been instructed to bring a vegetable and thought the green, red and white would be festive and the ingredients tasty.  It got many compliments for taste and appearance.  The wine couldn't really be tasted, but I'd be reluctant to leave it out because without it this recipe might be lacking that extra something..  I was worried that covering and cooking the green beans for the time allotted in the recipe would make them overly cooked and spoil their color.  That didn't happen.  Worth making again.

Like one other mentioned you can't detect any addition of wine. However it has a good taste. My husband loved it. And I don't really like green beans but I liked them this way. So it passed my taste test.

Thrilled to find this recipe...it is great AND bonus factors...it's very attractive to serve AND it's very quick & easy!  What do you want from a recipe??  The green beans, red pepper & feta really were wonderful combo!

I did use the wine and could certainly tell I was cooking with wine... but could I really taste it when eating...not really.

This was pretty good.   I used queso fresco instead of feta since it's another crumbly cheese and that's what I had on hand.  I also added some garlic powder cause I wasn't picking up the wine so it needed some flavor.

Really yummy! Roasted the green beans and tomatoes and added some fresh thyme, we’ve made it 3 times this week, that’s how much we liked it!

Great flavourful recipe: colourful side dish for spring or summer.  Beans needed longer to cook, but the combination of garlic, wine, red pepper and feta complimented the beans perfectly!

I started the Red peppers with garlic for about 30 seconds, then added the green beans; the rest followed as given.

Followed the recipe and loved them! Used a Chardonnay and loved the flavor it adds. Made them again a second time without the red bell pepper (didn't have any) and they were still delicious.

Delicious!! I had this once in a locally sourced deli and it was out of this world. This recipe is on point! The white wine and feta together are delicious. Used fresh green beans from the garden. AWESOME. Will continue to make this!

I skipped the home made dressing and used a bottled zesty Italian to save time. Saved time and tasted fine.
