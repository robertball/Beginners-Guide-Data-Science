Very tasty.  Strongly recommend cooking on LOW 10-12 hours instead of on HIGH for a shorter time.  That's just the best way to cook a pork tenderloin to insure it coming out tender.  Most of the prep is making the sauce but that's very easy.

This is definitely not your ordinary “slow cooker pulled pork”. It’s sweet, spicy, smokey, tangy and oh so delicious!! All of the components really come together to make this recipe a standout, for sure! I made the recipe as is and wouldn’t change a thing! This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe!
