Oh my goodness, this bread is excellent. I changed it a bit to suit my tatstes. I added sundried tomatoes to the top instead of plum and added a bit of romano into the dough. Delicious!

This was great! I made it in the breadmaker on the dough cycle & then rolled it out. I used all whole wheat flour in place of white flour. Also, I didn't have any olives, so instead I used some homemade tapenade I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again. I'd like to try it w/ fresh thyme either in place of or in addition to rosemary...

The perfect blend of spices and flavor.  By using fresh grated Parmesan cheese, there was a nice moist layer of cheese that is very delicious.  A good side to any Italian meal.

I was expecting a fluffy, thick focaccia. This was not that at all. It was tasty but not what I was hoping for. My kitchen is pretty cold so maybe it would have risen more in a warmer kitchen ... who knows? Thank you for the recipe but I'll keep searching.

A very nice recipe...I too had not needed to change a single thing in this recipe, very fragrant tasty bread!! I served a bit to my husband straight from the oven with some fresh butter and his eyes instantly rolled back into his head, he loved it...made my house smell fabulous! With the rest I cut it up into large squares and wrapped them in plastic and stored them in the fridge over night as they where needed for a lunch the next day....the foccaccia was still great (although much better straight from the oven) Nice recipe!!!!

This recipe was great.  I don't care for rosemary so I substituted 1 tsp of italian seasoning and also mixed 1/4 cup of romano cheese into the dough.  This turned out wonderful....sinful...irresistible.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! This came out soft and very flavorful.  I added some dried basil and grated parmesan to the dough, but otherwise made as written.  My kids are on their second piece each already!

don't change a thing!
use the best olive oil for the best bread
I baked mine on a round pampered chef stone (lightly oiled) and it turned out perfectly, simple enough, and good as a meal starter with soup and salad (try the winter salad with poppyseed dressing on this site).

This was wonderful. I omitted the olives b/c of the kids but was able to get my olive fix by eating mine with an olive salad mix that I bought at the deli. We also tried it with different combinations of salami, pesto and hummus. Very good with butter too!  It's a keeper - thanks!

Really not a fan.  I would prefer the olives on the top.  The flavor wasn't great.

Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. I topped mine with blue cheese and carmalized onions and it was devoured within minuets.
The Focaccia recipe alone is a great base for a multitude of toppings and is even good plain with a little olive oil to dip it in.

I felt I had to review this because I've made it so many times. I absolutely LOVE this recipe and so does anyone who eats it. Oftentimes I use dried/crushed rosemary because that's what I always have on hand (use 4 tsp dried instead of 1/4 cup fresh). Sometimes I consider using different ingredients to make a different kind of focaccia, but I always come back to this exact recipe. The rosemary, olives, tomatoes, garlic and parmesan are perfect.

So easy and delicious!  Yeast breads can be intimidating, but this was fantastic and simple.  I substituted sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil for the black olives in the dough.  I also topped the entire bread with grated Grana Padano cheese.  My husband and I ate almost the entire thing for dinner!  Great recipe!

This recipe was delicious. The bread was light and crispy. I didn't change the recipe, but I used regular canned Parmesan cheese..fresh would have been better..my bad.

Turned out great.  I add dried Herb de Provence instead of Rosemary and used Kalamata olives instead of black olives.  I used Vegan Parmesan and no tomatoes.  It’s delicious especially when dunking in oil and vinegar.

I'm just waiting for the dough to rise, but am a little worried because the olives were hard to knead into the dough, which was pretty oily when I set it aside to rise... But if it works, I'll be thrilled and will return to add stars!
It worked beautifully and I served focaccia as I would pizza to friends who watched a foodie movie with us. 5 stars from everyone! Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but the bread dough itself needs some salt.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to chop the olives up or halve them?  Any way I chopped them up and wish I would have halved them to get more of that big olive flavor.  Seems like a lot of rosemary but it works nicely.  Nice texture too!

This is one of my favorites! Very easy to make and I have made it several times. I honestly don't notice a single difference with or without the olives, except color - so i just stopped adding olives. Super easy to make just as written and comes out great every time.

I tried the recipe exactly as stated, I found it to require way too much rosemary.  I would suggest cutting the rosemary in half (at least), because you have to put it in the dough mixture AND on top.  The other thing that I found odd was that you add the olives to the batter last, but it changes the dough consistency, making it wetter, so I wasn't sure if I had to add flour to even out the imbalance?  Also, you really only need one tomato.  A good base recipe, but I would play with it a bit. 
Thanks

Seemed just OK to me. The bread was a bit too dense for my liking - not fluffy at all. This may have been my own fault. However, the ingredients (olives, rosemary, Romano and tomatoes) were delicious enough to make this bread palatable anyway. I'll probably incorporate them in a different bread recipe.

I put the olives on top instead of mixing them into the dough. I also put sundried tomatoes on the top. This was my first attempt at making bread and it turned out really well.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!!

Mine came out nice and thick. The 2nd time I tried it, I used a bigger pan so it wouldn't be quite as dense. Not a huge fan of rosemary, I used it, but about half as much. Perfect! Makes a fantastic meal with soup and a salad.
