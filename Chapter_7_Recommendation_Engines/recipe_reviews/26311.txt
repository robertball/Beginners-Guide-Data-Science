I first found this recipe on this site in 2002, and made the dish for my then boyfriend, and now husband. It's still a regular on my home menu. I made some initial changes, which perfected the recipe for us and which I've kept all these years: 1) I omit the lemon juice altogether 2) I add about 1/4 cup chopped parsley which adds beautiful color, scent and a slight lemony flavor that makes up for the missing lemon juice and 3) I always saute shrimp or chicken in the pan with garlic and olive oil FIRST, then spoon it onto a dish and set aside, before using the same pan to make the sauce. This will add a lot of flavor to the sauce. Then after the sauce is made, add back the shrimp/chicken along with cooked pasta, mix and then dish up and serve. GREAT!

To truckerdoo--the sauce curdled because you used milk and not heavy cream as the recipe indicates.  There is not enough fat in milk to keep the sauce from breaking.  If you're trying to make the recipe lower in fat you'd need to experiment with a combination of heavy cream and milk to keep the sauce from breaking.

From reading the reviews that others had posted, one would gather that these were submitted my inexperienced members...milk?  (8^D)

I tried your recipe, and my friends and I were extremely pleased with the results.  Not too difficult; not too time consuming.  The cream came out very rich and flavorful, and I believe that by estimating the amounts of wine, garlic and lemon juice, I was able to achieve a wonderful balance.  (I try to use recipes as a foundation for creation rather than direct instruction - this allows me to experience how different amounts of ingredients will effect the end result and to adjust for different tastes geographically...)

Thank you for providing a wonderful foundation for a memorable dinner with my closest friends.

An absolutely great basis really for your own recipes.  For  example try adding bacon when frying the garlic.  My only complaint was that it was too runny.  So I'll use slightly less wine next time.  But it's definitely a keeper.

Followed this recipe exactly and the flavor was good but the consistency wasn't the best.  Be sure to constantly watch the sauce because the wine reduces super fast - I moved away from the pan and when I returned the shallots were almost ready to burn!  But the flavor was excellent, and I'll probably try this recipe again with a constant eye on the pan.

I thought the sauce was a little sour, but that's maybe because of the white wine, that I used. Next time I will be more careful when adding the lemon juice.
I would suggest adding smoked salmon, fresh basil or bacon to the sauce.

Quite tasty. Although next time I will cut the lemon in half. I found it a little overpowering 
for my taste. I also added a tbs of flour to the sauce, as I found that it didn't 
thicken at all. Other then that it was quite good. Will make again :)

Excellent flavored sauce. I didn't have a lemon, so I used 2t of bottled lemon juice. This sauce really tasted good over scallops and chicken breast. Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. Did use less lemon (just do it to your own personal preference) and added more fresh minced garlic per the other reviews. I also didn't bother with having the heavy whipping cream at room temperature.

I followed the recipe with the exception of two things: after adding the wine to the shallots and garlic and boiling to reduce it, I strained the liquid, then added the cream; also, I thought that the shallots, garlic and wine added enough piquancy to the sauce, so I left out the lemon juice.  I plan to serve this with roast lamb at Easter dinner.  This is a delicious sauce and I'm filing the recipe among my other favorites.  Many thanks to Claire for her recipe and inspiration.

MUCH too much lemon juice, and I'm a lemon-lover.  The sauce was just sour from all the lemon juice. I was expecting a nice creamy wine-tasting sauce, but what I got was a runny, sour-tasting sauce.  I do not recommend making this as written.

Followed recipe exactly, minus the shallots and garlic. Never thickened and way too strong on the lemon.

My 2nd time making it I decided to use a larger pan so there was more surface for evaporation. This unfortunately meant the wine almost completely evaporated, but mixing it in w/the cream did make for an incredible flavour. 

I also doubled the amount of cream b/c of the lack of wine left in the pan. Fabulous.

This really is good... but you have to do some work first! Less lemon is RIGHT! I started with a tablespoon and worked up, finally ending at about 2 1/2 T. I think it would have been too much otherwise. Also, I never cook with real onion - I used dried minced onion and it worked great. The description on this said it's thick and creamy, which wasn't the case with mine, but it worked out fine. We made this fantastic by using it to top lightly breaded chicken, then served it alongside linguine alfredo. The lemon and alfredo blend together beautifully... there's a chain restaurant I used to go to in NC called Ragazzi's, and they have a dish called Chicken Limonata, and this is a lot like it. SUPERB!

Great sauce, I did add a tbl spoon of flour to thicken. Other than that it was very good. But next time I'm doubling the recipe, I like to have sauce to dip in.

I would have given it 2 stars but I must have done something wrong, so am giving 3. It sounded like it would be very good, but mine ended up just tasting like heavy cream.

Unless you're cooking for two, I recommend doubling this recipe.  And as others, I also only used half the amount of lemon.

I had to make emergency alterations to this recipe, which I made tonight.  My heavy cream went BAD so I used ladle full of spaghetti water, whole milk + melted butter for the final step and then stirred in 2 tsps white flour to thicken it up.  I also added a can of drained mushrooms and a bunch of finely shopped fresh italian parsley.  Topped with parmesan and it was GREAT.  Horribly fattening no doubt but it was a big hit.  I'd make this again no question.  OH, also I used cracked black pepper instead of white to add a bit of color as well.

Served this with wild mushroom flavored linguine. I did not use the lemon. This turned out delicious, but it was more runny than creamy. Also, I will cut back on the shallots next time, because they dominated the make up of this sauce. I will probably try this again. Good with French bread.

This is a delicious sauce -- phenomenal actually!  I did not give it 4 stars, however, because it lacks a precise measurement for teh lemon juice -- start with 1 tablespoon and then increase to taste.  I failed to do this this first time I made the sauce and added sugar to taste to compensate for the tartness.

This was the pitts! The wine made it awfully sour, and when I added the milk, it curdled 
terribly. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I tried three times (wasted a whole bunch of 
ingredients) and in the end just had to go with an entirely different recipe. Plus, this yielded SO much sauce that it was more like alfredo soup than sauce.

If you want to taste anything else than lemon, put a teaspoon at best. Juice of one lemon is way too much. It is all you will taste.

This was so good!  My husband even loved it! made a couple small changes (dont you hate it when people say its good and then say they changed it??) I didnt use shallots, doubled the garlic (cause you can never have too much), and after I added the cream; I added basil, salt and a cornstarch mix to thicken (1T cornstarch, 2T water). Like others mentioned, I also cut the lemon in 1/2. I added shrimp that I had sauteed in butter and garlic and served over fettuccine noodles. This is a keeper......

Loved this recipe, really easy to figure out, cooked it for about 5 friends after moving them into a new apartment. Didnt use as much garlic, but I did add fresh cut basil, oregano, and cilantro, added good color to the sauce and really boosted the flavor. I served it with penne, and sauteed red and orange peppers, red and green onions, and roma tomatoes, a really great way to do this for my vegetarian friends!

I cut this recipe in half, and it was still fantastic. Be sure not to cook on too high of a heat or all your liquid will evaporate.

I just made this as a pizza sauce over a whole wheat crust with mozzarella, proscuitto, roasted eggplant, and tomato. It was fantastic! Definitely use half the lemon juice (maybe quarter depending on your taste). Use a good white wine--one you would actually want to drink. And don't add the cream until the wine is almost entirely evaporated. Thanks for this recipe!

So made as written but then doctored so we could eat it. 

If I was to do this again:  I’d choose a very mild wine or use 1/2 chicken broth. (I added bullion to fix mine as the wine I used was tart/bitter and overwhelmed the sauce). I also ended up using some grated Parmesan cheese and a wee bit of flour to thicken it (although adding al dente pasta and heating through prob was enough).  My wine was tart.  I cannot imagine adding lemon.  A sweeter wine though might have needed it.  This really depends on what wine you use.

Oh my gosh you guys I have made so many cream sauces in my life and this one is incredible! I always follow it to a tee and it comes out exactly what I want every time. Tonight I’m mixing it with cavatapi noodles with cherry tomatoes and fresh spinach and baking it with herbed bread crumbs. So good. Last time I breaded a chicken breast and pan fried it, then put some of this sauce over the chicken and wow!!!

I love lemon wine sauce and this one is easy and good. I'm not sure why the recipe says it takes an hour to make, it took nowhere near that. Maybe thirty minutes. I didn't have shallots so I used half of a large white onion. I also didn't have a fresh lemon so I used 2 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice. It was a strong lemon flavor but I like that. I wonder if reviewers complaining about it being too tart have ever had chicken picatta. This is basically that sauce, it's supposed to be tart. I didn't use any meat, I just coated bow tie pasta with it and topped with capers. I think next time I'll add asparagus or broccoli.

This is a great base recipe, some changes though- omit the lemon all together and cook the shrimp separately in a pan with lemon then add the shrimp to the finished product.

This sauce is really good! Absolutely delicious with lobster ravioli! Playing around with different white wines changes the flavors, but it’s never come out bad. It does kinda seem like there’s not much of it though, I’d recommend making one and a half or doubling the recipe (maybe except for the shallots) if you’re making it for more than 4 people.

I also thought it was a bit sour and I used a cup of cream (not 3/4)C.  I used Sauvignon Blanc. It's also not a thick sauce. It came out better after I added freshly grated parmesan cheese. I made bowtie pasta, grilled chicken, sliced mini yellow/red peppers and spinach.

This does not match the original which used no wine at all. The flavor was good but not what I expected. The texture (for me) was also off. I used this recipe with pasta and shrimp. Here is what I did different
Par cook the shrimp in garlic butter clarified) and set aside. To make the garlic butter i fine sliced garlic and sweat'd it for about 30 minutes, strained through a strainer in order to reuse the butter.
Next i par cooked the shrimp in this butter, set aside.
I added a little more butter to what was in the pan and cooked the shallot (2 instead of 3) 
and garlic similar to the instructions.
Using the same pan I combined all of the wine. I used sauvignon blanc for this as it has a little less bite. I did not use any lemon juice as the wine provided more than enough acid.
Keeping the heat on high I reduced the wine to almost au sec (dry).  If i dragged a wooden spoon on the bottom of the pan there was a trail that did not collapse upon itself until the spoon was halfway across the pan. It is impossible to go by time here. There was maybe a 1/8 inch of wine left in the bottom. I did not follow the above directions and ended up with too much wine and had to add more cream.
After adding the cream reduce until the back of a rubber spatula is coated.
At this point I added the shrimp (to finish cooking) and the pasta to warm back up.

Flavor was good. I did not care for the amount of shallot in my mouth. Next time I would puree and then add back in to make a smoother sauce. Fo

I substituted heavy cream for a milk/butter/flour mixture. It made the sauce VERY thick. I also added sliced mushrooms during the last 5 minutes of the 10 minute boiling. I would definitely make this sauce again, hopefully with cream next time!

I had guest coming over to dinner one night. About 2 1/2 hrs before they were to arrive, I received a call telling me one of the guest could not eat any red sauce. I turned to Allrecipes.com found this recipe. It turned out fantastic. Then everyone wanted a taste it. I was asked for the recipe from a few of my guest.

Great sauce, I made this with a pino grigio, I added bell pepper (just because I had it laying around), and I added bacon per another reviewer's suggestion.  I don't mind sauces that aren't super thick, because the pasta will soak up the extra liquid in no time.  The wine reduced almost down to nothing, and the flavor was big and bold.  If you want the sauce thicker, don't add flour!  Just pour it over your pasta and let it stand 10 minutes, then stir.  Beware that if you add bacon like I did, cut back on the extra salt addition.

Loved this.  Used evaporated milk,  scallions instead of shallots, added parmesan cheese once the cream part was added. Used only a slither of limon acido, and at the very end, added the shrimp I had cooked separately with a bit of its buttery liquid to the sauce  and fresh chopped tomatoes and it turned out perfect. Delish!

I prefer to pretty much stick to the recipe as written for the first time.  I did so with this too, though I did put very little lemon in, as we don't like strong lemon in a dish like this.  So, though I wondered about the amount of shallots called for, I went with it.  They did cook down a lot, but the "sauce" was still more like shallots with a bit of cream over them.  I had been looking for a garlic cream sauce, and this was horribly disappointing.   That said, I think it might be good with far, far less shallots.  And/or if you want a strong onion flavor.  Oh, and I would at least chop the shallots, as opposed to just slicing.

I used this as a base for a lemon garlic cream sauce for chicken.
I omitted the cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and added 2 tsp of cornstarch that I had mixed in 4 tsp of cold water. I then grated the rind of I lemon bs the lemon juice,  let simmer till thick. Tossed in a handful of chopped chives at the end and served over chicken. The family LOVED it and are asking for it again already!!

very good for how i use it.....as a sauce to put my cracked crab into. Consequently, the lemon flavor is very appropriate and needs a less thick consistancy. Must use a dry wine, great to incorperate another herb or fish flavor but more than one is too much.

This was a good base but needed a few changes. Only used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Any more would have made the sauce too tart. Once the cream was added I reduced it for about 10mins as I like a thick sauce. Served it with some Veal Ravioli.

I've used this recipe a number of times as a foundation; I then add in mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and chunks of sauted chicken and serve over pasta. Delicious...Thanks for a great sauce.

This was AMAZING!  I had a bottle of white wine that I friend left at my house that I had nothing to do with.  This was the first wine sauce I have ever tried to make.  My family was very happy with it!

The flavor, in my opinion, was great. However, when following the recipe it ended up quite water-y. I would probably add something to thicken it. I actually used about 3/4 of the lemon and it worked very well. I also love the small ringlets that you can cut the shallots into.

The base for a good meal is there but the lemon destroys an otherwise good recipe. Possibly exchange the lemon juice for s small amount of zest or leave it out entirely.

It didn't taste right... I would suggest trying it without the lemon first to see if it is better that way.

Too Much Lemon, not thick enough, not enough garlic, and not "creamy". You may also want to chop the shallots. I ended up having to doctor the sauce quite a bit to even get it close to tasting ok. I used it with the basil pasta recipe that is on this site, and the contrast between the green pasta, and the white sauce was nice, but don't waste your time. The white pepper also isn't the best idea. Cracked black pepper worked better. Overall, I was sad that I wasted a half bottle of wine on this sauce when my dinner guests and I could have sipped it with a good sauce.

I agree with using less lemon - I hadn't read the reviews beforehand and used 3/4 of a lemon (it's what I had), and it was too lemony.  I didn't have shallots, so I used chinese chives and added a premix of 1 Tbsp of cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp of water after stirring in the cream to thicken up the sauce (I only had heavy whipping cream on hand).  I used it over pasta and it came out nicely (except for the lemoniness, which I'll change next time).

This recipe is good but only used 1/4-1/2 of a lemon a whole lemon over powers it and make the sauce taste like one big lemon.

I agree with others that say it is a bit sour.  I used half the amount of lemon it asked for and next time I will use even less maybe a couple of teaspoons.  Other than that it was excellent and so easy to make!

I found that the shallots over powered the garlic, and the lemon left the sauce bitter and the sauce was thinner than I had anticipated.  I think I could be good with a lot less lemon, a bit less wine and a little thickening.  I think it just lacks a little balance.

The taste is superb but it came out a lot thinner than what I had expected.
