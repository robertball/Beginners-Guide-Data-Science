Followed recipe as written.  Everyone loved it!!  For those concerned about crock pot times and newer crock pots, my crock pot is a newer one for which I usually have to reduce cook times.  This recipe did not require that adjustment.

Amazing BBQ pork. No need for the smoked paprika - I added more of the dried chipotle in place of it since it has a smoky quality to it and a bit of a kick.

I got rid of the liquid smoke- not a fan. I subbed part of the water with white vinegar, added pepper, a splash of lemon juice, garlic, onion, bell pepper, and a bit of brown sugar.

I made this ahead of time and took it with us camping.  My picky kids loved it  I will definitely make again.

I halved this recipe and cooked the roast and ribs on low for 7 hours. Came out perfect!

I'm not sure why all of us here didn't like it, but I won't be making it again. Thank you anyway.

Easy, with the 10 hour slow cooking time, it took two days to finish, but well worth the time. Moist and cooked to perfection.
