These were very good.  At first I had a difficult time coating the balls with chocolate.  I offer the following suggestions:  1.  I used a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and melted them in a double-boiler.  2.  When the chocolate was almost melted, I added 3 Tbsp. of shortening and stirred until it was fully melted. (Doing this helps the chocolate set-up firm and dry, and you don't taste it a bit.  3.  I dropped the cookies into the melted chocolate mixture.  4.  I used a fork to roll them over gently.  5.  I slid a fork under the cookies to lift them out, tapping off excess chocolate gently into the pot of chocolate.  6.  Finally, I used a toothpick to slide the cookie off the fork onto a sheet of waxed paper.  It was really easy to do, and the cookies looked gorgeous and tasted great!  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion, and melted white chocolate chips, which I died orange with food coloring, and piped the colored cholate on to the top of the cookie.  It really did look like something you would buy at a candy store.

Ok, I just made these, and this is the suggestion I have to appease those cooks who say the mix is too sweet. It started out as my mess up, to which I added too much orange juice, as my can was a 12 oz. can, and it calls for a 6 oz. can. Instead of doubling the rest of the recipe, and more sugar, I added a box of precrushed graham cracker crumbs until my mixture dried out and was easier to handle. I also bought mini paper cups and before rolling out 3 dozen cookie balls that didn't fit the "1/2" ball, I measured against my paper cups, so they were just a little smaller than ping pong balls. Now, that adjusts the sweetness and size issue some folks had. As for the dipping just follow the other cooks and use a fork or a skewer to get them dipped and add a little shortening or oil to the chocolate. I adorned mine with little sprinkles I bought that were snowflakes. How cute they are. And the mix isn't too sweet at all, in fact it has inspired me to do more with canned orange juice! Thanks Vicki!!

WOW! These were so delicious. Unlike another reviewer, I thought the orange flavor was very subtle and not overpowering. Here are some things to consider for ensuring the least mess and the most efficient way to cover with chocolate: line a large jelly roll pan with parchment or waxed paper;transfer melted chocolate to a plate or shallow dish; push a 5in bamboo skewer (get them several to a pkg at the market) down thru the top of the ball;place a good size amount of melted chocolate on a rubber or metal spatula; use a combination of rolling and patting action to coate the ball;place coated ball onto prepared jelly roll pan to chill; If you're a perfectionist, you may want to dab the hole made by the skewer with a dab of chocolate. Next time I make these I will cut the sugar to 3/4lb and add about 1/2t salt to cut the sweetness a bit. I made the balls approx 1/2-3/4" round rather than an inch for ease of handling and eating.Judging by the moistness, I will probably let them "set up" in a 175 degree oven for a half hour or so. Most people would probably find this recipe perfect as is, but I am striving to make a similar product that is less messy to eat, especially when serving them for the holidays or to guests.These are very rich and delicious so keep serving size in mind.Thanks Vicki.

To make the chocolate coat easier add a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil to the chocolate mixture.  The first year I made these I nearly pulled all of my hair out while trying to coat these.  The oil makes it much easier.

These were so good! My family loved them.  The orange flavoring is just right in them. I made them a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving and they freeze wonderfully.  They make alot more than 16 though!!!  Please try these; you will not be disapointed!!!

These are very rich and delicious.  I solved the chocolate dipping problem by using the kind of chocolate designed for dipping and coating rather than baking chips.  Since they're so rich, I suggest you roll the cookies small.  Definitely more of a candy than a cookie.

I was disappointed with these, too.  The orange taste is too strong, like cheap candy, and they were VERY hard to coat with the chocolate.  They're too big for mini-cupcake liners and too small for regular ones, so I ended up with a bunch of unattractive chocolate lumps crammed into the smaller liners.  I'm a big fan of orange and chocolate candy, but I couldn't even eat these.

Absolutely wonderful!  The orange taste is intense, and yet natural- not like orange flavoring at all.  These got rave reviews, and were really simple to make.  For all of those who had chocolate-dipping issues: drop the ball into the chocolate, lift it out with a fork (but don't stab it!) and gently shake off excess.  Then use a teaspoon to roll the ball off of the fork and on to your tray to harden.  I only needed about 2/3 of the chocolate- but I drizzled the rest on a batch of biscotti...

These were absolutely delicious!  I bake anywhere from 15-20 different kinds of cookies every year for Christmas.  Not only are they no bake but, as mentioned in another review, very addictive!  I save some of these for myself!  If you like the chocolate/orange combination - this is your cookie!  They will become part of the "regulars" I make every year!  :-)

Had to give 4 stars as I have not made yet but with they sound like they should be great. Just a note about them being hard to dip. Use the best cholcolate you can find not cheap chips. I like Giradelli chips they melt to a great dipping chocolate. Invest a couple dollars and get a dipping spoon from a craft store wilton make a plastic loop one and also a fork. I like the loop best it make the job much less work

These were very sweet.  I found that they taste better after a few days...gives the flavors a little bit more time to blend that way.  I loved them, just the same!!!

I was disappointed in this recipe:O(  My guests liked them, but I prefer the baked cookies.  The chocolate was impossible to put on, so instead I dripped the chocolate over the tops of the cookie.  I was so excited to make this but I won't bake them again.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe opened a whole new world of kitchen fun for me.  I have used different frozen juices and different chocolates but the end product always thrills the taste buds.  Thanks!
I place a bunch of balls into the chocolate and swirl them around, then take them out with a tooth pick.

I liked these very much, although I'm not so sure my friends and B&B guests did.  This recipe makes A LOT so be prepared to have a lot of time to make them and get them dipped and set (if you want to do it all at the same time).   I do suggest having the paper candy cups (buy them at Michael's) ready for a nice presentation.  All in all, I will make these again, but won't do it every year, too time consuming.

Thanks for all the great "helps" I added 3 tablespoons of shortening and used the fork method. Which really helped coat all 50 of my orange balls very nicely. I wish I had used that method on my peanut butter balls I made the previous day.  It is a little sweet, but generally a nice flavor. Next time I will add grated orange peel or perhaps some orange flavored liqueur to jazz them up. I coated with milk chocolate chips, next time I think like others suggested I will use a darker chocolate i.e less sweet. I did add some toppings while the chocolate was setting. Some with colored sprinkles, some with grated dark chocolate and some with finely chopped walnuts.

I made these yesterday afternoon and I'm glad I didn't rate them at that time, or I would have only given 4 stars. These are much better after they sit for a day. The flavor mellows and they aren't so sweet. I froze them, as a test, and they freeze very nicely. Per other's suggestions I added some shortening to the chocolate coating and they were simple to coat. I just put them in the choclate, lifted out with a spoon and used my fingers to transfer them to waxed paper to dry. The chocolate kind of melded in and covered my fingerprints. I also substituted pecans for walnuts. Very yummy and I'll be giving some as gifts.

When making the "dough" for these, I tasted it and it was so familiar, but I couldn't figure out where from.  A confrence with my mom sorted things out - growing up, she'd made the exact recipe only rolled them in powdered sugar.  I think the chocolate was a welcome change and the whole family agreed.  Thanks for posting this!

These taste AWESOME but... the texture didn't do it for me. These were more cake like balls than cookie balls. I put them in the freezer for a couple of hours to firm them up before I coated them, that made it a lot easier. This makes a lot more than what the recipe says.

Great flavor, but I prefer a firmer consistency. Next time I'm going to try adding a cup or so of Rice Krispies for texture and to firm it up a bit. I also recommend freezing the mix for 30min. or so before dipping in chocolate, as well as adding a 1/4 tsp. of orange zest for kicks. TGFC (Thank God For Chocolate!);)

Very easy and tasty.  Kept well in freezer.  Flavor improved with age.  This recipe made about 36 ping-pong-sized cookies.

I didn't actually make these but gave the recipe to my mom since she loves the choc/orange combo. She made them and I thought they were awesome. Lots of flavor. She said they weren't too hard either. Will definitely try on my own sometime.

What a waste of ingredients. Way too sweet... couldn't even eat them. And very very messy. Won't make again.

These were good and a nice change from the usual cookie/candy.  I dipped them in semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate.  My boyfriend loves them!

These had a wonderful orange taste. I also had a very difficult time coating them. For that reason alone, I will not make these again.

These turned out very well and were simple to make, except it was time consuming to dip into the chocolate.

these were really good, but really sweet.  Everyone liked them, and they had a genuine orange taste, not fake like some orange cookies.

I made some with semi-sweet chocolate.  Delicous!
I found that 12 oz. chocolate was enough to generously coat these balls.  I got about 48 from the recipe as printed.

i did not really like these. The orange taste just was not good. My husband on the other hand loved them. Maybe I'm just not a chocolate/orange person. I doubled the recipe and it made 10 dozen balls! So the servings listed is way off.

These were okay.  I coated half with semi-sweet chocolate and half with white chocolate.  I didn't get the raves that others received.

I had no vanilla wafers, so I used oreo cookie crumbs instead. The dough was a bit sticky, so I added a bit more cookie crumbs which worked out nicely.  I used bittersweet chocolate instead of the milk chocolate.  Although they were a bit tedious to make, they were worth it.  These cookies have been the season's hit.

The mix doesn't set properly and the cookies themselves  have a horrific bite to them.  I wouldn't recommend the recipe at all.

Our family really loves these.  Nice orange flavor, not too strong and have a nice texture.  It was a great suggestion to use skewers to dip them in chocolate and I let them air-dry over night.

Fairly easy to make.  Thought the orange flavor was overpowering.  Might be interesting to do as another rater suggested and try another flavor of juice concentrate.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. They looked lovely, but I thought they tasted kind of average.  I took them to work - a couple of people just RAVED about them and a couple of people just despised them...I was somewhere in between.

This recipe is fun as well as easy and has been a hit amongst my family members and friends. I jazzed them up by drizzling them with melted white chocolate tinted orange. They look wonderful and are a festive addition to any dessert tray.

I made these without the nuts and used the others' recommendation to add some oil to the chocolate (thanks).  I agree with others that they are not very tasty for the first couple days then they mellow considerably and are quite nice, but still sweeter than I prefer. My family liked them but I am not sure they meet the "make it again" test.  I may like it better with a touch more vanilla flavor  and/or less OJ. Overall a nice easy recipe.

I was a little skeptical about these at first, but they were a huge hit at Christmas.  I will say though, these balls a decadent and very sweet  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  When it came to dipping the balls in chocolate I let some dry according to the recipe and froze other balls since I had used that technique when making peanut butter balls.  Surprisingly, the dried balls were actually easier to dip.

All together a good recipe.  I did have to add more orange juice for my taste but all together very good.
