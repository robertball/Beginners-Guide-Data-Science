These muffins came out dry and not too flavorful.  I definitely will not make them again.

I wasn't sure why these were called Mocha Muffins if they didn't contain any chocolate. Anyway, I didn't have any malted milk powder, so I substituted cocoa powder. I added 1/2 cup oil at the suggestion of the other reviewers. When I tasted the batter, it didn't seem sweet enough, so I added a little cinnamon to the batter. The second time I made them, I cut the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup and used my own mixture of chai spices instead of cinnamon. Now that's a Mocha Muffin!

I thought the recipe was very good. I added some yogurt and some oil as recommended.  I think they would have tasted even better if I had remembered to add the topping!

These don't remind me of cupcakes at all. I agree with the other reviewer that these could use some more taste; next time I will add toffee chips I think. I like the idea of using malted milk (no particular reason except that I really like malted milk); that's why I tried these. Maybe next time I'll add more of that too.

I liked these muffins but they were rather dry. I added a half cup of oil and they were still dry so I would have hated to have used the exact recipe. I assume that the writer just forgot an ingredient or two. Also, this recipe has no chocolate so Iâ€™m not sure how the term mocha fits. I used two full eggs, had no malted milk powder so replaced it with a quarter cup of cocoa. Next time I might put in a bit less coffee, add some extra moisture, omit the sugar crust and put on a nice chocolate icing. But all in all, these were still okay.

I read the reviews and modify the recipe for what I had on hand. I used hot chocolate powder in replace of the malted milk, used 1/4 cup of brewed coffee instead of instant coffee and water; Add 1/2 cup of oil to the batter. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Its not dried and its not overly sweet. I like it very much and will try applesauce next time in replace of the oil.
