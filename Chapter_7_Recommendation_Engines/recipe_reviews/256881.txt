OMG these are so good.  They are so indulgent, the whole time you are eating them, you tell yourself they must be bad for you. They're that good. But, thankfully, they are good for you so Buon Appetito, piatto pulito! I used whatever veggies I had on hand; eggplant, zucchini, hot and sweet peppers, and carrots.
