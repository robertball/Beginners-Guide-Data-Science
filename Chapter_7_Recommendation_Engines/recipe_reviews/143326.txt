A word of caution: the longer it sits, the hotter it gets! When I wrote this recipe, I had just made a batch of this stuff. By the next day, the heat levels had nearly tripled. I would strongly suggest you eat what you make that first day! And I would definately seed the peppers!! That's why I gave my own recipe 2 stars.

YUM.  I love hummus, and I like it hot.  I want to eat this all day, but I'll pay for it tomorrow...I don't even care!  I spread it on slightly warmed whole wheat pitas and topped with chipotle salsa and a dab of sour cream.  Wait, I'm drooling again...gotta go

I'm not a huge hummus fan, but this was excellent. I love my food very spicy. I agree with the fact that it seems to get hotter as it sits. I loved it the way it was, but made another batch without any pepper to mix with it to tame it for my family. If you love spicy, then you'll love this.

this recipe taught me that i can't handle hot foods, even though i thought i could...fiery means fiery.
