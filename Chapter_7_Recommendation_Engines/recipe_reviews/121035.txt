just tried this recipe and like everyone else I changed it somewhat. The biggest thing was that I sprinkled a little more cheddar and crumbled bacon on top and it added alot of eye appeal as well as flavour. One thing no one mentioned is using paper muffin cups. It didn't work for these as they all stuck to the paper. Best to stick with greasing the muffin tin.

Update #2: tried this again using 2 cups flour, 4 cups shredded cheese, 1 egg and a big of eggbeaters, 3/4 cup milk + 1/4 cup veg oil, and 3 massive sausage links & it worked out great!! Update: I can't believe this recipe hasn't been more popular - I made a batch and gave some to the neighbours and they went nuts. Everyone thinks I'm an incredible chef now haha. Please take some of my changes into consideration, especially if you like cheese! The second time I made this, I made it the same as the below listed changes except instead of onion powder I used 1/2 cup diced onion and 6 slices of bacon rather than 4. My family loves them! -- I wanted to just do half the recipe but it ended up making 10 muffins for me. I used 1 cup flour, 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese (my parents are cheese lovers), 4 bacon strips and threw in a bit of real bacon bits, 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk & the 2 tablespoons veg oil, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, some salt, some garlic powder, some paprika, some onion powder; only baked for 13-14 min. Thanks!!

Has to be one of the tastiest recipes I've ever made.  I used cooked, peeled and diced smokies (I managed to burn the outsides on the BBQ and didn't want to waste them).  I used grapeseed oil (it has a light flavor and is 'good-er" for you).  I omitted the onion powder and replaced it with minced fresh onion in one batch, Italian seasoning in the other batch.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 Tablespoon.  With a lightly greased muffin pan these basically slid themselves out of the pan and look so nice baked up!  Our neighbour thought they were wonderful, she showed up just in time for them to come out of the oven.  My husband RAVED about them, he went on and on about the flavor and how filling they were as a snack.  I prefer them warm so you might want to microwave them when you take a leftover from the fridge.  These muffins are definitely going to be a staple in our house. A great way to use up leftover meat too.  Next time I'm going to dice leftover chicken and add chopped sundried tomatoes.  Ohhhh, and after that time I'm going to try crispy bacon with little nuggets of herb and garlic cream cheese (freeze for an hour or so before chopping)!  And after that I want to try diced ham and jalapeno flavored cheese!  And after that...well, you get the point!  VERY versatile, very simple, very delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I am a high school Family and Consumer Science teacher.  I looked for new muffin recipes for our muffin lab.  For all the various muffins, the kids liked these best of all!  Very good and very flaky.

I added some chives, sausage, bacon, cheddar & mozzarella cheese, as well as a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also added sour cream and an extra egg to the mixture. They came out sooo moist and not dry at all, but unbelievably delicious!

I have been making these for several years for morning social time at my church. Everyone loves them. To increase the flavor measure your bacon drippings after cooking the bacon and use as part of your needed oil.

Wonderful as a breakfast muffin to take on the go.  I added two sausage rounds, cooked, crumbled, and drained.

Just made these for the first time. Came out great and are awesome when they are still warm out of the oven and the cheese is still gooey when you pull them apart. I did use suggestions and made a couple variations to the recipe. I used an egg as called for but added an extra egg yolk just for moisture. It worked great! I also took someone else's suggestion and used only half the amount of vegetable oil and replaced the other half with bacon grease which I reserved from cooking the bacon. I also used about double the amount of bacon and cheese as all these things enhanced the flavor. I added a little cayenne pepper for flavor and I think that it is somewhat necessary to add some spices as I read that they can have a "floury flavor". I could see how that can happen without extra spices. Finally I reserved some chopped bacon and shredded cheese to put on top of the biscuits before baking them which enhanced visual appeal, added flavor, and also gave a nice contrast of texture as the bacon got extra crispy on top of the biscuit to add some crunch. Hope these variations help!

These were very good but seemed to be missing something.  (I did leave out the lemon pepper because that just sounded gross to me.)  I used more cheese and bacon than called for-should have used more! It did have a flour taste.  I think I will make them again but use buttermilk and use cayenne pepper instead of garlic powder.  I think it is the garlic taste throwing them off...maybe garlic salt instead?  Anyway, they are almost outstanding just needs someone to find the trick!

Made exactly as written with the exception of using real bacon bits. Very nice, basic, savory muffin. (Recipe does not specify - I used 1% milk)

These are awesome!  I had one to check for doneness and one to snack on not long after.  :D  I added in some onions and, lacking shredded cheddar, chopped my own monterey-jack.  Noting the reviews reporting a floury taste, I subbed about half a cup of cornmeal.  I seasoned with some cayenne, rosemary, thyme, garlic salt, and pepper.  With the extra content from the onions, I also compensated with a touch more of the dry ingredients and a splash more of milk to make them fluffy.  They turned out great and sat in the freezer overnight.  The boyfriend and I each grabbed one and nuked it for breakfast, and they are still good!

These muffins were pretty good.  My picky toddlers gobbled them up.  I made the recipe as written except using 1 c. diced ham in place of the bacon.  I will make them again, but I think I will cut the sugar and up the garlic, just to suit personal taste.

These were good but they seemed to be missing something. They are a little too dry and tasteless for being bacon cheese muffins.

Really good and really easy.  I only used half the bacon, as that's all I had on hand, and fresh herbs from my garden.

These are TASTY! I also made a couple of adjusments, including cooked diced onion, changed the lemon/pepper herb for an italian spices herb mix, cut the flour down to 1 1/2 cups, the sugar down to 1 tbsp and the cheese up to 2 cups. Then I sprinkled some parmesan on the top cooked them until they were nice and golden on the top (about 20 mins).

Perfect! I used aged provolone cheese instead of cheddar and sprinkled the top with dehydrated garlic - parsley.

fantastic breakfast alternative to sweet muffins! i followed the review about adding extra cheese (maybe 3 cups?), omitted the lemon pepper and salt in exchange for seasoning salt, added some dried, minced onions and put cheese and bacon on the tops for looks. reheats well, too!

These muffins were tasty, very easy to prepare, and took almost no time to bake. I omitted the lemon pepper (didn't have any) and just used black pepper instead. I used thick-cut bacon from the butcher but next time will go for the thinner stuff that crisps up a little faster. In mixing the ingredients together, I first mixed all the dry ingredients in one bowl and all the wet ingredients in another. I tossed the bacon and cheese in the dry mix to coat. After that, I dumped the wet into the dry and used a wooden spoon to combine until just mixed. Keeping the stirring to a minimum kept my muffins light and fluffy. Would make again with more cheese and more bacon! Yum!

Just made these and I agree with most that they need more bacon and cheese.  I also sprinkled cheese on the top with some bacon bits.  The cayenne gives them a boost and the chopped onions as well.  Very good.

Fantastic! The smell that came out was heavenly. I will add more cheese and maybe change to buttermilk part milk, more bacon so that it's less batter. I used fresh lemon and fresh onions. I'm going to heat these for breakfast and serve with hollandaise sauce!

Great recipe, even for some one like me who isn't great at baking!  I followed others advise and used 1 cup flour, 2 cups sharp Cheddar cheese (my parents are cheese lovers), 6 bacon strips , 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk & the 2 tablespoons veg oil, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, some salt, some garlic powder, and some paprika.  I grated about half an onion in, and since I was out of veggie oil I added some applesauce and butter.  I only made 6 muffins, but filled them to the top so they came out giant.  I gave them away as gifts in Christmas baskets, and they were a big hit!

I must have screwed up. I subbed turkey bacon, 1/2 ww flour and 75% reduced fat cheese- very dry and bland.  so i am rating it as a great recipe anyway; Others can learn from my errors. DH will try to salvage them by making a sausage gravy...hmm

Pretty good! I used diced turkey ham instead of bacon, and plain pepper instead of lemon pepper, because I didn't have any. Great idea!

This was good.  I was in a hurry so I just made loaves of bread.  That worked just fine.  I also omitted the salt and baking soda and just used self rising flour that I had lying around.

These muffins were a good, quick breakfast for my kids.  I did substitute chopped up fried pork roll for the bacon, and I left out the lemon pepper seasoning.  I made these at night, and the next morning I popped them into the microwave to warm them up.  They reheated nicely.  My kids enjoyed them, and have requested that I make them again.

These tasted too much like just flour to me. I think a little cornmeal might do the trick.

These were very good with added bacon & cheese. I also did some with bacon & sausage and those were delicious as well.

A nice change from the normal sweet breakfast muffin.  I didn't have bacon, so used chopped ham instead, and shredded sharp white cheddar cheese.  I took a few recommendations of other reviewers and used a little more spice - they were well received at the B&B.  These will be on the regular rotation w/the noted changes (without the additional spices, I think they would have been a bit bland).  I plan on trying the bacon - that sounds tasty!

My bacon loving daughters went crazy over these muffins.  They were great the morning that I made them, but also kept very well in the fridge to reheat days after.  These, with an egg on the side, made a great breakfast for my kids.

recipe was very simple and easy to follow. It had a nice flavour, however i found that the muffins didn't rise as much as i would have liked and was a bit small.  so will probably double the amount of batter per pan next time.

only fair, I think they would be better with onion in them and I will probably leave out the lemon pepper and sugar.

I'm not quite sure why when other reviewers made this, that they had a floury taste because mine didn't.  These were pretty good although I will add more garlic next time and either reduce or eliminate sugar and maybe use cooled melted butter instead of the oil.  Could someone please explain why this recipe calls for sugar anyway?

These taste pretty good warm out of the oven.  However, they were not really a family favorite. I had no lemon pepper, used oregano instead. I would make these again, though.

These are so good!  I omitted the sugar and increased the garlic powder to a generous teaspoon.  I also used 1/2C. of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese in addition to the chedder! Amazing...Every one enjoyed them.  My daughter cut hers in half (once cooled) and put deli turkey in it and had a interesting muffin/sandwich!  Thanks!  A keeper!

I didn't have any bacon, so I used two Aidells spicy cajun sausages that I minced. I also like my food a little spicier, so instead of cheddar cheese, I used pepper jack. These were unbelievably good and very easy to make! Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins were sooo delicious. I did make some changes though. I used 2 cups flour, 2 cups shredded cheese, 1 egg, and used 1.5cups canadian bacon. I love the taste of onions so I sprinkled a decent amount of dried onions to the mix. Next time I will add more! I also did not use lemon pepper seasoning. They came out so good! Can't wait to make more!

I would not call these muffins at all.  They were baking powder biscuits.  I did not put them in muffins tins but cooked on a baking sheet instead.  They did cook nicely but as others reported very floury and I am not sure why.  The family also agreed so therefore I will not be making again.  Sorry.  I will keep looking for a better cheese muffin recipe.

I just made these and they turned out okay. They made slightly more than 12 muffins in my tins (I ended up with 15). I think the next time I made these muffins I will add more cheese and more bacon than is called for.

I omitted the sugar & milk, added more garlic, a teaspoon of onion powder, 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 of water.  Next time I will add 1.5 cups applesauce (didn't have enough today) and omit the water. Muffins were moist and flavorful.

Good texture...but definitely something missing!  The flavor was off.  I will try to make again ~ but I want to play around w/ the spices as this just didn't work for us.

These muffins went perfectly with the soup I made tonight.  They were hearty, but not so rich that it overpowered the meal.  It was a nice accompaniment to the robust flavors of the soup I made this evening.  These muffins made a great meal the perfect meal.  They were also completely convenient and easy to make!
