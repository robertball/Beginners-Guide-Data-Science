Wow! For those of you who put in 2 cups of peanuts, you must really like a lot of nuts! 
I put in about 1 & 1/4 cups and stopped there. 
I didn't even attempt the fork idea. I kept my cookie sheet warm in the oven while the candy was cooking. When I poured the mixture onto the warm pan, it stayed soft long enough for me to then tilt the pan to spread the candy out.

This recipe turns out great. I've made it several times. I use a digital candy thermometer for accuracy. It must reach 300-degrees F. to be crunchy. Baking soda adds an "easier bite" to the peanut brittle, causing it to break when less force is applied. It also causes the sugar base around the peanuts to be opaque. It does this by "foaming up" and introducing small bubbles in the sugar syrup. If you desire a clearer almost transparent sugar base around the peanuts and a "harder bite", reduce or omit the baking soda. If you use roasted peanuts instead of raw, be careful not heat the mixture above 300-degrees F. or the peanuts may taste burned. Roasted peanuts can also be added at the end of cooking to prevent burning.  If you use salted peanuts, omit the salt in the recipe.

Great Brittle. A few tips: Be sure to have butter and baking soda measured out beforehand and waiting, (and butter softened) stir them in well to mix, but dont stir it to death. when it is foamy and pale, stir a few times more, and then stop. I doubled the recipe (a single recipie for a single household, double it to share with anyone) and used a half-sheet size (read: about 17"x13" with a lip on it about an inch tall. I covered the pan with extra-wide aluminum foil and buttered the  foil, and the sides of the foil. As soon as you are done stirring the stuff in, pour it onto the foil, and spread it out. I did this by picking the pan up and kind a shaking it around. If you try to spread it around like frosting, you'll end up breaking all those beautiful little bubbles that make it crunchy but light. Have fun!

This is my first time making candy, and it was awesome!! I added the teaspoon of vanilla as suggested, and almost 2 cups of peanuts. The only thing I would do differently is less peanuts. My sis-in-law liked the extra peanuts. So of course, I think it depends on what you like more, the candy or the peanuts. Very easy. By the way, have a pot of BOILING water that you can place your utensils in immediately to help with clean up.

Fabulous!  This stuff tastes just wonderful, and was very easy to make with very little cleanup afterwards.  Since I live in a country where corn syrup is not available, I had to substitute light molasses for the corn syrup, which worked just fine.  

A couple of suggestions--even though the amount of liquid is originally not very large, be sure you use a large pot since the extremely hot, sticky mixture foams up to many time its original size when the butter and baking soda are added.  Also, don't dump out the mixture onto the cookie sheet in just one place and expect you'll be able to spread the peanuts around evenly afterwards--you'll crush all the bubbles.  A better tactic would be to pour the mixture out onto the cookie sheet in a circular pattern so the peanuts are evenly distributed to begin with, then tilt the pan to get the liquid spread evenly.

I'd give this ten stars if I could!  I made many batches of this and gave out for Christmas gifts and received RAVE reviews.  You definitely have to have the ingredients ready to go while you are making this, but don't let that scare you off.  Once you have done one or two batches, you definitely get a "feel" for the process.  Here are a couple of notes that might help.  First, USE A CANDY THERMOMETER.  I can't imagine being successful without this.  While stirring, the candy takes quite a little time to get to the desired temperature, and CONSTANT stirring is not necessary.  But WATCH OUT...once it gets to around 250 degrees it RAPIDLY shoots up to the 300 degree temperature and you need to be right on top of it.  I learned to let it stay at the 300 degree point for a bit to brown the candy and the peanuts.  It gave it a GREAT flavor, but BE CAREFUL!!!  Also, I added from one and a half to two cups of peanuts, and liked the consistency.  This mlay well be an annual tradition!

This is the recipe my family has used for 30 years and always gets rave reviews.  Certainly a candy thermometer would be helpful but we've never used one.  I was taught to cook the syrup until the stir spoon held about two feet above the pot has a long thin thread going down to the pot - then stir in the peanuts and cook until the peanuts are tan.  Mix in the rest in one quick motion and spread on WARM cookie sheets to help it spread. 
Yummm.

LOVED IT! I took some of the advice from other reviewers and waited to add the peanuts at 250 deg.(Not one scortched peanut!), cooked it to 305 deg. and added 1 tsp vanilla. It was so easy! I also couldn't wait to try it so I popped it in the frezzer for about 20 min. until it cooled off.

This peanut brittle is delicious! It is fairly simple to make, even for a novice candy maker. I  did change a few things as per other peoples suggestions. I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar (which gave it a nice colour and taste) and I had dry roasted peanuts so I waited until my thermometer read 250 to add them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla when I added the butter and baking soda. Everyone was right, you do have to wait a while for it to get up to 250 but once it hits that it goes really fast. And you have to work fast at spreading it on the pan. I had my pan in the oven before hand as well to help. And to make it go even faster I put the pan outside in the cold air and it cooled in no time! I will definitly be making this again!

I just finished tasting my first batch and wow it is awesome! My husband is a brittle expert and told me this beats all he has ever tasted! I even loved it, I am not usually big on brittle but this I like. I did add the teaspoon of vanilla and added 1 3/4 cups of peanuts with skin on. Heated pan too which helped, also made sure I hade last ingredients premeasured out for quick throw in when reaching right temp, I went to 310 degrees, I also used pure white corn syrup but close to the end I added 2 tbls of dark syrup and gave it the perfect colour!Kudos to the sudmitter of this awesome easy recipe.

This is a good recipe, but it is not specific enough.  Making peanut brittle can be tricky and the recipe leaves out some important information.  Peanuts are listed as an ingredient, but the type of peanuts to use, whether raw or roasted is not specified.  Since the recipe indicates that the peanuts should be added once the sugar is dissolved, it assumes raw peanuts will be used.  However, if roasted peanuts are used at this point, they will burn since they’ve already been cooked.  Other peanut brittle recipes recommend using raw Spanish peanuts.  I used roasted unsalted peanuts and added them with the butter and baking soda.  Since the nuts were already cooked, they just needed to be mixed in with the sugar mixture.  Also, some reviews indicate that the sugar mixture doesn’t need to be stirred constantly, but in my experience it pretty much does.  I once made this and didn’t stir continually and the sugar mixture burned.  The third and best time I made this, I lightly stirred very frequently, almost constantly.  I’ve also used different combinations of sugar types (all white vs. half white/half brown) and I prefer the color of the brittle when I use half brown/half white.  Spreading the brittle works best on a pan that’s been kept warm in the oven.

Ok I just made this brittle after reading through many many helpful reviews. I wanted to add everything I learned in one place - The peanuts in the recipe can be cooked or raw. If they are raw follow the recipe instructions. If they are cooked add them right before you finish. I mean right before you hit 300. I added them at 280 on my first batch and all of my peanuts burned. Use a wooden or metal spoon so your spoon won't melt in your brittle. Heat your cookie sheet up to 200 degrees and put something under one side to tilt it up. This will help spread the brittle. Put parchment paper on your cookie sheet so the brittle won't stick and won't be all oily from a non stick spray. Have a buttered spatula or spoon ready to spread the brittle out. And last but not least have everything measured out in advance. Hope this helps everyone :)

I have made several batches of this now after spending over an hour reading all the reviews and comments. Mine turned out fantastic and I followed the recipe exactly (and I've never made brittle before in my life!).  Don't be intimidated; you can do it!  I didn't add or change anything (I think adding more peanuts would have been way too many). I used raw peanuts with no skin. Here are the tips I got from the other reviews that worked well.  First, definitely use a candy thermometer. Try borrowing one if you don't want to buy one. Second, heat the tray!!! This made it so much easier (mine was 170 F). Third, I stirred almost constantly and never had any burning problems. It took roughly 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Fourth, have everything pre-measured and make sure your butter isn't cold or hard. If it was I found it took too long to melt and by the time it did the mixture was already getting too firm. Fifth, when pouring the mixture onto the cookie sheet, pour in a circle or back and fourth over the tray; don't just dump it in one pile. I tried using forks and spoons to spread it and neither worked well. I found shaking the tray back and forth spread it the best, but this probably wouldn't work unless your tray is WARM.    That's it. Hope this helps. This was a wonderful recipe and easier than it might sound!

So good, should be illegal. Let's make it easy:
All ingredients carefully measured in individual containers. Use 1 1/4 cups of peanuts. 
Heat oven to 200 degrees, using a large cookie sheet with parchment paper=no excess oil.
Patience/MEDIUM heat only/always! Water needs time to evaporate. Use a wooden spoon.
Add peanuts at 250 degrees. Container with butter and yes, include 1 teaspoon vanilla...place them close to the boiling pan so it is soft and ready to rumble to the right time.
You need to know: the level boiling is low: the thermometer is barely registering the proper temperature. Relax. It takes about 18+ minutes to get there...the peanuts need to brown a bit, as does the sugar/corn syrup. Let it come to you...look for the carmel color. Add butter/vanilla mixture, stir until incorporated, (relax, you are almost there)...add baking soda. Stir until mixed. Don't worry it. Take off heat. Take cookie sheet out of oven. Quickly, but you are in charge, empty the pan onto the parchment paper in a waving motion. Put the pan on an unheated part of the stove.
Using the wooden spoon, just flatten the brittle like you know what you are doing. Sprinkle salt on top. 
YOU ARE DIALED! 
Take a moment and reflect: "Wow, this is so beautiful and I made it!" 
Let it cool...you will burn the roof of your mouth if you try it now. 
Boiling water=easy/queezy cleanup. 
My first try was a disaster=too high a heat. I call it the "Hindenberg". Now I play music. 
Such great gifts!

It's wonderful seeing this recipe.  This is the same recipe that I've used for almost 40 years.  I've always judged the doneness by the way it looks and feels.  The syrup will get very thick and when it turns a dark amber color it is done.  I have won various awards for this recipe and have shared it with many, many friends.  Have very hot water ready to soak the pan and utinsels.  Soaking in hot water for 15 to 30 mins will make clean up easy.

ok, I have made this 3 times, twice with peanuts and once with cashews. the first time I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a burned-peanut flavor. yuck. so the second time I added the peanuts before the baking soda, and added a tsp of vanilla. spot on peanut brittle. amazing. so today I made it with cashews, bashed it up into 1" pieces, and coated in chocolate for a baby shower favor. wow. so good. now back to the kitchen I go to make 4 more batches! p.s. don't make this when humidity is above 55% or it won't set.

Perfect! Definitely use a candy thermometer and add peanuts around 280 degrees so they don't burn. (The color was still a pretty golden tan.) I added 1tsp vanilla at the end, used lightly salted peanuts, and left out the salt. I also placed parchment paper on my granite counter and then poured the mixture right on top  with much success. Sets up very quickly! My 4 kids loved it! I'll be making this for years to come! Don't pass up this recipe! UPDATE: I made about 10 yummy batches for Christmas gifts. I learned to completely stir in all the butter at the end or the brittle won't have a pretty sheen. Also, DO NOT DOUBLE the recipe. The result is burnt peanuts. You can wait until 300 degrees to add the peanuts too. I found this made it easier to stir the mixture up until this point. My average for the recipe to reach 300 degrees was about 10-11 min.

I just made a batch of this for the first time and wow, it's good! I've never made peanut brittle before and so I read all of the reviews first. There are some good suggestions there. I had dry roasted nuts, so I took a reviewer's advice and put the nuts in at the 250 degree mark. That worked well, but be sure to keep stirring hard after you add them or the nuts will scorch. I also kept a jelly roll pan lined with Reynolds release foil in a 200 degree oven until ready to pour the brittle in. Be sure to pour it all over the pan, don't just dump it all in the middle. I used a warmed offset spatula to spread it a bit. It looked pretty thick on the pan but the soda (which makes it bubble up) keeps it light and tender as long as you don't play with it too much once you pour it. Don't fear the brittle! Now I'm off to make another batch for my neighbor!

This is the best recipe for peanut brittle. I would give it 10 stars. The clean up is so much easier if you have a pan of boiling water available. I also added a 1t of vanilla. I made this over 10 times over the Christmas holiday. Everyone loved it. I used fresh raw peanuts that i found at my local nut store. Thanks for a great recipe. revised Dec 2007....my family said this is the best peanut brittle they have ever tasted. I can't make enough for them. December 2010 still making this recipe. I found another good hint is to have soft butter. It melts faster. Just finished making 5 batches of it. It takes me about 18 minutes to get to 300 degrees.

Do not alter this recipe, except to add more nuts if you're utterly crazy about them. My only qualm with peanut brittle involves pulling the brittle at the end because it cools so quickly, but other reviewers addressed this topic by suggesting that you put the pan in the oven before pouring the mixture onto it. Therefore, parchment paper (which can go in the oven) trumps wax paper and foil (which must be buttered and leaves a greasy side on your cooled brittle) for this recipe.

Love it!  I've never made candy before.  I was ready to just guess at the right temperature. So glad I bought a candy thermometer cause it took a lot longer than I thought to reach 300 degrees.  But I followed the recipe (actually doubled it).  Came out great!

I followed the advice of other reviews: Wait until 250 degrees and then add in your peanuts! Cook until 305 degrees, remove from heat, stir in your butter, ADD 1 tsp. Vanilla *it's bland without vanilla!* Stir in the baking soda just until combined, don't over stir! Those air bubbles make the brittle light & airy. Also: warm up your greased cookie sheet in the oven, makes it easy to tilt the pan to spread the hot brittle mix evenly. I didn't even use forks to spread, just the spoon to get it out of the pot and tilting the heated pan. I also always DOUBLE the entire recipe, it fits great in my heavy duty lipped cookie sheet (inside pan measures 12 x 17" w/ 1" lip.) If you are doubling the recipe use a larger deep pan when you are making the brittle on top the stove. Doubling the entire recipe makes perfect brittle about 1/3" thick when cooled & set.

One of 2 very similar recipes on here.  Combine the instructions together for best results.  I used 1C of peanuts and would use more next time.  When you add the peanuts the temperature will drop, resist the temptation to crank up the setting on your stove.  Mixture will shortly return to temp and begin climbing.  I think where most have problems is they cook on too high of a setting.  Until water initially boils off, temperature will climb rather slowly (this is NORMAL for all candy making), just have to give it a few minutes.  Other recipe says to cover for 3 min. but I don't see that matters.  Certainly recommend a candy thermometer for best/most consistent results since that ice water method is very imprecise unless you have extensive candy making experience.  Would also be great with other types of nuts (i.e. almonds or cashews).  Pour hot mixture on lightly buttered aluminum foil, let sit until cool then break into desired size pieces.

Fantastic recipe!! I found instead of greasing up your cookie sheet, cover it with parchment paper, pour your finished peanut mixture on top, and cover that with another layer of parchment paper. At this point take a rolling pin (or whatever you can use) and spread it out. Once cooled, brittle comes off easily!

Thanks for the recipe!

This stuff is a 10 all the way.  I recently tasted see's brittle(i know where have i been)and it was the best brittle i had ever had.  So i tried this, but i looked at the back of the see's package and they used milk, so i sub'd the water with milk,  OMG!!!! soooo yummy, i followed everything else exactly, ok i didnt i added the nuts until 250 degrees and i added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Next batch i will add more nuts and ill add more butter cuz i know what taste i am going for.  Anywho this is great thanks again.  Going in the christmas baskets this year.

Just made 4 batches while my toddler took a nap - wonderful!!! And I'm not really a peanut brittle fan. Anyway, I definately recommend adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and an additional 1/2 cup of peanuts, otherwise you'll have relatively large patches of candy without any peanuts.

Made this yesterday and it was so easy and so good.  Thought my hand was gonna fall off from stirring until it hit 300*F.  But it was so neat....i couldnt smell anything from the pot until about 3-5 degrees from 300*.  Then BAM the wonderful smell of brittle hits you.  Two to three seconds later it hits 300* and is perfect.  Easy to follow.

this is a super recipe which turned out perfect using a few reviewer's suggestions.  i used all light brown sugar which resulted in a beautiful brown color, hence avoiding the light color comments of others. it was fairly brown which i liked, but if a slightly golden brown color is desired, i would think you could use 25% white sugar.  i also doubled the recipe which was no problem and used 50% more nuts which i substituted medium pecan pieces for peanuts and added the in at 250 degrees which resulted in no burning of nuts.  i added the suggested addition of vanilla (one teaspoon for doubled recipe) with butter and baking soda mixed and used a candy thermometer to 300 degrees. what i can suggest myself is when buttering the pans, use the absolute minimum as possible, as the brittle bottoms when cooled are greasy and i had to set them on paper towels to dry it off.  i am wondering if if the hot mix is too hot to use parchment paper, but the paper toweling part was easy so i may not try it for fear of sticking.  i would say that 50% more nuts is the maximum increase in nuts, as the candy nut ratio was perfect for me, but any more would make it difficult to stir and not enough candy part. i did heat up pans in the oven at 300degress and because of the increased nuts, i needed to spread with forks, and fast to avoid popping the foamy bubbles that makes the brittle fluff and easy to eat.  the boiling water for cleanup makes cleanup totally effortless.  this recipe is definitly a k

Very good basic recipe!  I only have a couple of suggestions.  It's a little light in color and flavor. If you like the darker, more caramely tasting peanut brittle, cook it a little longer than 300 degrees.  You might want to add a little more salt depending on the saltiness of your nuts.  Also, I thought it needed more peanuts.  I'm making a second batch now and will add 1 1/2 cups of peanuts to this one.  Great recipe though.  Thanks Amanda!

I have always been too afraid to make this being told it was so difficult, but after my grandmother passed away and several years went by without her special once a year treat, I decided to try to carry on her tradition.  I had my pan greased, butter at room temp. and baking soda ready. I used Spanish peanuts instead and added them at 280 degrees like someone suggested. Had hot soapy water ready, stirred pretty much constantly, had difficulty reading my candy therm. cause candy was shallow in pan. (Note: double batch) It took a lot longer then I thought to reach that high and someone was right about keeping a close eye on it after 250 degrees because it does jump. I was sweat'n bullets toward the end, there was no color forever and I wasn't sure what it should look like. Thank you to the person who explained what the soda does and that not to stir too much or pop the bubbles after pouring because that's what gives it it's perfect light, crunch. I reached 300 degrees so not to be chewy, and at honey color, took off the stove, thru in the butter and soda, stirred as fast as I could to incorporate and poured onto cookie sheet. The fork thing did not work and it hardens to quickly to mess around, just lean side to side and shake a little.  WOW! I had over 50 people try this and all couldn't believe the crisp, perfect texture. It was so light (even those with dentures could and did enjoy this) the flavor was great and my family said it was the best they'd ever had. Thank you!

I took advice from others, and used 1/2 brown sugar,and 1/2 white. I added a tsp of vanilla, and I waited to put the peanuts in until my thermometer read 250 so they would'nt burn. This was so yummy! It was my first time ever making peanut brittle, and it was easy to make. It is time consuming though, but worth it!!

This was my first time making brittle and this recipe was super easy. I didn't have a candy thermometer so had to guess at the temperature. It took about 25 minutes for the brittle to turn dark gold and pass the water test. Tasted great but will add more peanuts next time and also try an almond version.

Easy to follow, and simple to make.  Make sure you let the temperature get to 300 - it took longer than I thought (10-15 min. or so).  Also, shaking the cookie sheet afterword side to side helps spread the candy without deflating it.

This was superb!  HOWEVER, duly note: USE THE WOODEN SPOON!!  My first batch was looking perfect as I stirred it around with a high-temp rubber spatula--until the end, when I added the baking soda and butter and kept stirring, I realized my red spatula had melted into the brittle and at the last second...it was ruined!  Not to be outdone, I immediately started a second batch, added a little brown sugar, a little vanilla (at the end) and used a wooden spoon the entire time and VOILA!  PERFECTION!

This is the recipe I used to make my first batch of peanut brittle and I took the suggestion of warming the pan beforehand which helped it spread easier.  It spread nice and thin, which I find more enjoyable to eat, and probably the best brittle I have had!

I've tried quite a few brittle recipes and this is our favorite.  In terms of the ingredients, I wouldn't make a single change.  After reading most of the posted comments I would offer the following prep advice:  watch your thermometer closely after 250 degrees because it goes quick, make sure your thermometer isn't resting on the bottom of the pan to get an accurate read, and don't worry about the fork method -- just keep your greased baking sheet warm and you can tilt the pan causing the mixture to spread to the desired thickness.

Very good recipe, turned out great the first time though not enough nuts for me, I used 2 cups of salted mixed nuts, I heated to 310 then put in the butter,baking soda and then added the nuts after that since they don't need to be cooked. You have to stir real fast and get it out of the pan and spread because it hardens faster, But it turned out great. I clean my pan by boiling water in it as soon as i'm done, It makes cleaning up easy.

This was my first time making candy that required a thermometer, so I was nervous about making this.  I was always told it was hard to get a recipe right when a thermometer was involved.  Well,  this was the EASIEST recipe and the results were out of this world!  I made it for gift baskets for Christmas and literally everyone asked for more!  I followed the advice of previous testers and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I upped the peanuts to 1 1/2 cups (although I might throw in an extra 1/2 cup on this next batch to make it 2 cups), and I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used roasted peanuts, so I didn't add them to the sugar mixture until it reached 250 degrees and then continued cooking until the mixture reached 305 degrees.  Perfect!!!  Thanks for this recipe! I'm ready to try some new candy recipes now!

Best peanut brittle I've ever had. We followed the instructions to a T, and it turned out wonderfully. We did wait and add the peanuts at 250 degrees, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. It was my first time making peanut brittle, and I'm just ecstatic at how great it turned out!

I just made this, adding 1 tsp of vanilla and it is indeed wonderful. I agree with one of the reviewers, next time I will cook to 305 as it is slightly chewy.  Thanks for the recipe! (Consider yourself warned, cleanup is challenging) ;0)

I've found that adding more baking soda makes the brittle lighter and not so chewy.  Try using about 1-1/8 to 1-1/4 teaspoons of soda.  Also, to help prevent the peanuts from burning, instead of cooking them in the syrup the whole time, put them in a baking dish and warm them in a 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes.  Cook the sugar, corn syrup, salt and water until it reaches 275 degrees, then add the warm peanuts.  Stir constantly so the nuts don't burn, and continue cooking until the candy thermometer reaches 300 degrees.  My husband loves this so much he can consume a batch in a day or two all by himself!

Perfection..... I'm a really good cook and my husband is a peanut brittle critic and SERIOUSLY this is the best brittle he's ever had. He had a group of men over last night for a poker party and I made this thinking it would be a yummy finger dessert, well they all said that it was the best they have ever eaten. Even better than See's Candy.  I do suggest, like the others, to have everything measured out and follow the directions exactly. I generally never follow directions, but I thought I would on the first try. It was PERFECTION!!!! No need to improve it. I will be making this as holiday gifts for our friends and family :) It's simple, inexpensive and FABULOUS!!

I made this yesterday and it is great ! I have never made penut brittle before,but wanted to try something different. I took someone elses advice and added the peanuts when it reached 280 degrees and left out the salt as I used salted nuts.I also used 1 1/2 cups of nuts.
 I used non-stick aluminum foil to line the pan, and very lightly buttered it.Also warmed the pan in the oven before pouring the brittle. I found it to be easy to get the brittle to spread over the pan without having to stretch  it or anything. Very good recipe and I will be making this again ! This batch is going to be sent to a niece that loves peanut brittle. I think I will experiment with different nuts next time.

Yum!  Super easy.  I agree that you need to have your butter and baking soda ready to go, and I heated the pan in the oven for a bit to make it easier to spread out.  Great brittle recipe!

This was my first time making peanut brittle. It turned out great! My husband wanted another batch to take to work. I'd say he liked it too.

I just finish making this and have to say it is the very best.  I did what the other reviews did and added 1 tsp. vanilla, had all the last minute ingredients readys to go at the end.  I also cooked it over medium high heat and did not rush it.  The clean up was a breeze with a pot of boiling water as another reviewer suggested.  I can't wait to use this with cashews.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made this last year for holiday gifts. The first batch was a bit so so until I perfected the process. 

I made peanut brittle, almond brittle, cashew brittle using this recipe and all were a big success. Definitely a keeper.

I looked at many recipes for peanut brittle and this one appeared to be pretty straight forward. I used all organic ingredients. I had great results. It probably took me longer to get the hardened candy cleaned off the pan and thermometer then actually cooking the brittle. I used an organic light corn syrup that had pure vanilla in it and it tasted great. I stole a tip from a Betty Crocker recipe that suggested warming the cookie pan to 200 degrees to keep the product soft while spreading. I did have one problem in that I couldn't seem to get the peanuts spread to the outer edges once I poured the mixture into the pan. No loss, these areas were like tasty toffee. I also saw a tip elsewhere about concern that adding the peanuts too fast could reduce the temperature so you should add 1/2 wait a minute and add the second half. I didn't do this but I noticed my temperature stalled and possibly dropped below 212 degrees after adding the peanuts and then shot up quickly which caught me off guard. I noticed that during that quick rise of temperature the mixture showed signs of getting darker so I caught it just in time and removed it from the heat. Time and attention to that thermometer reads is critical and the idea here in the reviews of a digital thermometer is probably good as it would be easier to follow the increase in temperature. But that's not vital and I am happy with the results. Photo included before I cracked the brittle.

I made this for Christmas last year and it was a BIG hit! I added unsalted roasted peanuts when the temp reached around 280. I poured the candy onto a greased cookie sheet and spread it out using the spoon I was stirring with. A great addition to this, is adding your favorite chocolate (mine is milk chocolate). Sprinkle the chips over the brittle just after spreading onto the cookie sheet, wait a few minutes, then spread it out. You do have to let it sit out longer, before breaking into pieces. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! I didn't follow the recipe's instructions to add in the nuts (I used walnuts and pecans) at the beginning. Instead, I toasted the nuts, put them on the baking sheet (which was lined with parchment paper) and poured the syrup on top of them. The result was picture perfect: crunchy, brittle, and had a trace of caramel flavor. Will make those again and again!

OMG so good, it's light and easy to bite! I sent this out with our Christmas cards and already received several outstanding complements. My family is requesting more =) This was my first time making brittle.
Following several reviewers suggestions and some of my own I'll sum up the helpful tips to improve the recipe which I used. I boiled a separate pot of water to clean with after cooking. Got all ingredients measured out ahead of time.  I doubled the recipe (worked fine for me) and added 1 tsp. vanilla with the baking soda and butter. I used roasted peanuts so i added them in after 250 degrees. I warmed the pan ahead of time in the oven, and didn't use forks to manipulate the soft brittle, i just tired to pour over pan evenly using a circle motion (where possible). This was to keep the bubbles from popping which make it light and easy to chew. I sprinkled chocolate chips over it (about 1/2 - 1 bag =) while still warm. Then stuck it in the freezer to cool. It was a little greasy and after making this twice, I'll consider trying a parchment paper lined pan to pour onto. Also, it did seem a little sticky after drying, it would be great to know how to prevent that. Perhaps the chocolate made it greasier? All in all very easy to make, and better than anything from the store. I can't wait to make more!

I made five batches of this in the last few days.  They all turned out just great.  I do have a suggestion.  If you love coconut like I do, try adding some coconut extract instead of vanilla.  I use two teaspoons.  Also, add about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of coconut with the peanuts.  I increased the ingredients by 1/2 on everything else.  I thought it might be too thick, if I didn't.  I also spread one cup of real milk choclate chips on top after it set for a minute or so.  Let them sit on top for a few minutes.  Take a spoon as spread them out all over the brittle.  This is the best Peanut Brittle that I have ever tasted.  I used roasted peanuts and I put them in around 280 degrees like others suggested.  I also put the coconut in right after that.  I think two teaspoons of the baking soda works best.  Thanks for all the helpfu hints.

Excellent recipe. Always use a candy thermometer when making candy. It's a good idea to wait until the thermometer reaches 250F before adding the peanuts to prevent them from burning.

AWESOME!  The plate of peanut brittle disappeared before the Oreo and Layer Peppermint Barks.  Even my Grandmother is asking for the recipe!!!  Only change: used 1 1/4c salted (blistered) peanuts and did not add any additional salt.

Just excellent! I wondered living here in the very humid Pensacola if this recipe would work, and it DID!!  I may have had the heat up a bit too high as a few of the peanuts charred, but the taste was not hurt and I stirred them well from about 250 to a 300 degrees.  Next time I will stir them more frequently so they won't burn.  I spread them by using a silicone spatula and it worked just right.  Thank you for this easy yet delicious homemade candy recipe!

This turned out really good!(despite my lack of thermometer.)

I highly recommend it, even for the not so experienced candy makers.

(Warming the tray in the oven prior to dumping the mix on it helps to spread it around before it hardens)

I made two batches of this brittle this afternoon. I put peanuts in the first one and broken cashews in the second one. Ordinary nuts from the Bulk Barn - salted. 
I used too many peanuts (maybe 2 cups) so cut down to 1 cup for the cashews - not enough nuts. Probably 1-1/2 cups of nuts would be best.
I lined the cookie sheet with aluminium foil and buttered it. If you leave it until completely cold, the foil will peel off. Otherwise, you need to pick off some bits of foil that stick.
All in all, two very good but different results. I like the taste of the cashew brittle best I think.
Incidentally, used my candy thermometer and boiled to Hard stage - about 250 to 260 degrees F.
I'll make this again next Christmas! Certainly is economical!

Pretty darn good....and yes I would agree, bringing the sugar mixture up to 300 degrees is essential!  I opted to lightly use PAM Cooking Spray on my cookie sheet and that seemed to work perfectly - the brittle pieces lifted instantly.  I also added a dash of vanilla extract and used cashews instead of peanuts.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wonferul! I had several people test the first batch before I make it for gifts and all my test batch was gone the night I made it! Tip: Don't use an airbake sheet. It holds too much heat and you can't stretch it properly. I didn't try the vanilla like the other reviewers but I think I will try it in the next batch tonight! I can't see how this could POSSIBLY get any better tho....and I don't even like brittle normally!!!

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe, but it did not come out.  I have to admit this was my first attempt at a hard candy, but something went wrong.  Can anyone tell me if the temp, makes a big difference?  I geussed because I don't have candy thermometer!  Thanks!

When you are pinched for time, try the "microwave peanut brittle" on this site....it is so easy, particularly when you are pressed for time.  No standing over a hot pot...just in front of the microwave!!!

Awesome and easy!  Need I say more?! :)  I burnt a few peanuts, so next time will add them later and make sure to stir more.  I also changed it up and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular and added 1 t. vanilla.  Thank you!

Tried over 10 recipes before I found this one which I like best.  The butter at the end is key, it makes the brittle less hard and adds flavor.  I usually use more than 2 Tbsp butter, closer to 3 Tbsp.  I also use pecans instead of peanuts.  Near 300F, it starts to go very quickly to a burn smell and flavor.

OMG this is good stuff.  I had some trouble with the fork thing, in the end I kind of smushed it around with the buttered back of a wooden spoon.  You have to work really fast as it hardens almost instantly (you can put the cookie sheet back on the still-warm burner to loosen it up if necessary). I made it exactly per the recipe and it was wonderful.  My S.O. thinks it's even better than store bought.  Scores high in taste and ease.  I've already made 3 batches.

this is an excellent recipe. I've made it 4 times and each time it comes out great. the first batch i made my family thought it needed more peanuts. the next time i used 2 cups and they were right. i also took the advice of one of the reviewers and used a ziz-zag motion to spread on cookie sheet. since i used 2 cups of peanuts and a ziz-zag motion i did not have to spread the brittle. i used dry roasted peanuts. the brittle was on the dark side but it was still excellent. since i never made candy before i was amazed on how long it took to reach 300 degrees. this is a keeper. thanks

I Love Peanut Brittle, but I never did have a recipe to make it. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe. You need patiences to make great candy. If people are in a hurry and they want to make great candy, the only thing I can say is don't do the homemade candy. You would be better off buying your candy. No one can hurry Great homemade candy. It was a hit here at my house. I really love the recipe and I really did enjoy making it. Awesome THANK YOU THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!

I had never made any candy before this recipe. I chose to take a chance though and double it. It still turned out great. One half I used the fork pulling method and one I just shook the pan a little bit. The one I used the fork on was flatter and darker in color. The one I shook was thicker and a foamier color. This was very easy to make and not as intimidating as I thought. My only tip, don't spill your premeasured baking soda as you reach to add it. Oh yeah, and get your pan and utensils soaking in hot water right away. It made clean up a breeze.

This recipe is awesome! I cooked it to 297 degrees (the hard crack stage on my digital thermometer only goes up to 295 degrees so I didn't want to exceed this by too much). I agree with other posts that pulling the candy with forks is more trouble than it's worth. It's much easier to shake the pan a little, then let the candy settle on it's own. This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe!!  I will use this for a long time to come, I used the dry roasted peanuts, and accidentally forgot the salt, and it still turned out wonderful!!  Took this with me for our Thanksgiving gathering and it was gone before no time!!  I did not use the fork puling method, I tried it in one corner and it started to deflate so I just tilted the pan back and forth til it spread out!!  Thank you for the great recipe!!

Fabulous! The first time I made it, I didn't use a candy thermometor and the consistency was all wrong. Later, when using one, it came out wonderful! I sent some to my Dad for his birthday. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a first time candy maker and found this recipe easy to make.  I did invest in a good candy thermometer and had all of the ingredients ready to go. The peanut brittle was PERFECT-it looked and tasted great. My husband and I were both very impressed. This is going into my recipe box!

This was amazingly simple and easy, and makes the BEST brittle.  I read a bunch of the reviews and followed several tips (all consolidated here, so you have all the info in one place!)
-Heat your buttered cookie sheet.  It helps the mixture spread out, especially if you pour it in a circle or a zigzag, and not all in one place
-add 1 tsp of vanilla to your butter/baking powder mixture (yes, I put them together.  I melted the butter too.)
-use a candy thermometer, and be sure that the sugar mix goes over 300 for a few minutes before adding the butter/baking powder/vanilla
-add the peanuts after the thermometer reaches 250.  It keeps them from burning.

I finished mine with a sprinkle of flaked sea salt on top, as I used unsalted peanuts that were nice and dry.  Those little bursts of salt really pull it all together!

Works much better if you put the butter in at the start and heat all the ingredients to 300. Then put the Baking Soda in and the nuts. Pour and spread very quickly.
You get a far better flavor and consistency. Use whole unsalted Almonds....Yum.

This really is very good.  It wasn't as crispy as I'd like it to be, but I stuck in the freezer for a few hours (after allowing it to cool all night) and that did the trick.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  This was so good!  USE A THERMOMETER and all will be good!  I used roasted and salted peanuts and added them in at 250F to prevent them from burning.  Next time I will try it without the baking soda...to me it was a little TOO light and crispy texture, rather than being crunchy.

This came out great!  Was even better a couple of days later. It took about an hour to reach 300 degrees.  I used dry roasted peanuts and added them at 250 (per reviews).  I also added extra nuts and I'm so glad I did. My first time making candy, doubled the batch (was probably too much).  Made one on a non-stick pan, the other on a regular pan.  The non-stick was much easier to take the candy off.

This is a very easy and delicious brittle recipe. I used split raw cashews instead of peanuts and threw in a bit of vanilla extract with the butter and baking soda. The vanilla plays well off of the buttery cashew flavour. I will use this recipe next time (with pistachios? almonds? hazelnuts?).

Great recipe! Try it with Cashews. Use the "Halves and Pieces". Press them between paper towels to absorb excess oil. Want more working time? Pre-heat the sheet pan and use an offset frosting knife to spread out the candy. I use parchment paper or foil sprayed with cooking oil. Be careful! Everything is hot! I've also tried chopped Almonds and Macadamia nuts. It's all good!

I've experimented a couple of times with this recipe with whole, blanched almonds which I keep in the freezer.   The first time I added two cups of almonds at 275F thinking more toasted nuts would be great. Result: hard, but tacky sheet of uncooked nuts (ewe).  The next time I added exactly one cup of almonds after the sugar completely dissolved. Once the syrup reached 300F, I stirred in the butter and soda but thought the syrup should be darker and made the mistake of leaving the mixture on the hot (but turned off stove). The mixture did get darker BUT...Result: granulated, opaque, brown-sugar-looking candy which tasted like brittle but had the consistency of a sugary praline (not-so-good).  Lessons learned: follow the instructions precisely and in order. Leave the mixture on the stove top until it's just about the right darkness THEN take it off and add the butter/soda.  I'm still trying to get the "spreading" action down in order to have thin planks...

No need to try another recipe! This was my first attempt at peanut brittle and it came out absolutely perfect!!! I can't think of one thing I'd change.  I did put in an extra half cup of peanuts per other reviewers' suggestions; however, the next time I make it I will follow the original recipe and only use one cup. I really like the taste and texture of the candy "in between" the peanuts.  One cup will be just right. I definitely know what I will be making and giving away for Christmas gifts this year.  FYI: I used a candy thermometer (purchased just for this recipe) and 300 degrees was right on. I used cocktail peanuts because that's what they had at Target, and they worked great.  Because they weren't raw, I followed the advice of other reviewers and added them at 280 degrees to make sure they didn't burn. Again, I ended up with perfect results.

My first try did not go so well- over cooked it. So I went back and read some reviews Second try- the results are AWESOME!  I cooked the sugar mixture first- you need to watch closely after is reaches 220 degrees - immediately pulled pan off of heat once the temp reached 300, stirred in  peanuts at the end because I used roasted/salted Spanish peanuts (skin on)then added butter, baking soda and 1tsp vanilla.  Yum, yum, yum!!

I am only rating it a four because when I think of homemade peanut brittle I think light and crispy.  The first time I made this it was really thin and had a chewy layer.  The second time I held it at 300 for a couple of minutes and before I put it in the pan I sprinkled the bottom with a little extra baking soda.  It was perfect.  Just note if you are going to sprinkle the bottom make sure the pan that you are dumping it into has tall sides, it will foam up a little more!!

This could not have been easier. I made my very first batch last night with peanuts and I got up and made another batch today with cashews and both are great. I kept my pan in a warm oven at 170 degrees and when it was time to pour into the pan, I slid the oven rack out and poured the candy in, so my pan would not cool to quickly before I had it spreaded from corner to corner. I did not have to use foil or wax paper at all, the cookie sheet I have is non-stick and I gave it a twist and it loosened from the pan. I covered with wax paper used a meat tenderizer to break.

I love this recipe and have made 5 batches in the last couple of weeks.  I do add 1 tsp vanilla when adding the baking soda and butter as well as warm up the pan in the oven so I just have to tilt it around to spread the candy instead of stretching with forks.

This is one of the best/easiest brittle recipes I've tried.  I only changed it by adding 1/4 to 1/2 Tsp of Cayanne pepper because I like some kick.  I used 1/4 for the batches I gave out to family and 1/2 for my own.  They all loved it.

Very delicious! Make sure to have all of your ingredients ready so that your peanuts don't burn.  Also to prevent the burnt peanut taste, make sure to stir the peanuts continuously and very well.

Pretty good recipe. Will make again. When you get close to being done cooking the candy things move pretty fast, so be on top of your project or you'll wind up with a scorced mess!

This is a great recipe. Mom has used it for years. Now that she is getting on in years we are making memories by making this together. We use the raw peanut you have to shell, we measure, and while she cooks or while I cook the other gets the last few steps ready. We pour ours into 3 metal pie plates, making sure to get peanuts into all 3 plates. It cools faster, you can put 1 pattie into a gallon zip-loc bag, it will keep the brittle dry and crisp, and give 1, 2, 3,ect. as Christmas Gifts. This is a great way for her to remember her friends and not cost her much money. We also enjoy it so much together. We only make it on a bright sun shiny day. Never try this on a day when it is damp or raining. I hope every one tries this recipe.

I have used this recipe many times. I gently stir the mixture constantly during the final cooking phase to keep the nuts from getting too overdone. For a neat change, use cashews instead of peanuts. My family and friends fight over this stuff when I bring it to a gathering. It is always the first thing to disappear. And break it up into small bite sized pieces. Everyone is going to grab several pieces and it will last longer if it is in smaller pieces.

Easy, easy & delicious!! I didn't have peanuts so I used 2 cups of pecans added in at 250. I also took the temperature a tad over 300 to be on the safe side. Followed suggestions & kept the cookie sheet warm. I also sprayed it with Pam-but do it VERY lightly on a non-stick sheet; it can make the bottom of the brittle greasy. I didn't use the forks-just tilted cookie sheet. Each batch gave me 3 medium cellophane gift bags 3/4 full. I saw on M. Stewart Show-for a "nicer" gift you could put this on one of the smaller cookie sheets, wrap with cellophane and attach a small hammer to crack it. Enjoy!!

This is a GOOD brittle. I used cashews instead of peanuts and it was great. I added an extra 1/2 cup of nuts because we like more nuts and less candy. I don't have a candy thermometer so I had to use the test method in water and it was easy.

This is a great recipe.  It is just like my dad used to make.  He used 8 inch round cake pans to make nice round patties that they wrapped in saran wrap and tied with a ribbon to give as gifts.  It needs the vanilla and be sure to get it to 300 degrees, but BE READY when it gets there.  You really need two people to make the patties because one needs to shake them out in the pans while the other pours it in. Great candy.

I'm sure this would be good but if it's your first time don't make this unless you have a candy thermometer. I learned the hard way. If It's your first time try Microwave Peanut Brittle it's just as good

Great brittle.  I made a few changes.  I used 1.5 cups pumpkin seeds instead of peanuts.  Just needed a change from the usual roasted seeds after pumpkin carving! I made it with dark corn syrup instead of light as that was what I already had.  Also, I did mine in the microwave for about 9 minutes and not on the stove.

HOLY MOLY is this good!! I have made it 3 times now. The last 2 batches I made with cashews instead of peanuts. It is delicious! I read on another site that you should not add your nuts until 260 degrees. I have done this all 3 times. I also add 1 tsp. of vanilla when I put in the butter and baking soda. I'm afraid this won't make it out of my house.

My husband absolutely loves this candy!  He has taken it to work and it disappeared, and he didn't realize he had any left and he took some today, and he just forwarded me a co-workers email asking for the recipe!

It was amazingly easy, with a wonderful light and airy crunch. It has also held up well for a couple of weeks in an airtight sandwhich bag. I took some other poster's advice and kept the pan warm in the oven, and just spread the candy out with a knife instead of using the forks, so much easier!

I have never made any kind of candy before and I'm very impressed at how easy this was to make and how good the taste is. I did use cocktail peanuts instead of raw because I couldn't find raw anywhere in my little town and just left out the salt in the recipe. It came out fine but it does have a slight taste of almost burnt peanuts though, which I think is because they were not raw to begin with which is my fault not the recipes. I also cooked it to 305 which was the Hard Crack stage on my candy thermometer and did this only because some reviews had stated that theirs came out chewy and not hard and crunchy. It came out the perfect consistancy after it cooled and broke up into beautiful chunks! My husband told be that he will never buy it at the store again because mine was better. Thank you so much Amanda for posting this recipe. It's a new Holiday Tradition!

This is really really good!  I used two cups of raw peanuts and it was perfect; I think any less would have been a mistake.  You have to be patient, because as others have said, it takes a while to get to 300 on the candy thermometer.  It's well worth the wait, though. I added just a little bit of vanilla in with the butter - maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  And you really needn't bother with the forks, just tilt the pan to get it spread out like you want (but work fast!) Everyone loves this brittle and it is simple to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy, results are consistently good.  You need a candy thermometer, because testing the candy for readiness is tricky and best left for the experienced candy-makers.  And heating the ingredients to 310 degrees as opposed to 300 degrees may leave it a little burnt tasting.  Try modifying the types of nuts used for some very nice results.

I've made 5 batches, and each one is perfect! Candy thermometers are essential to success, and I've found that raw peanuts make the best brittle. I highly recommend this buttery-tasting brittle!

Great recipe.  Made this for the 2014  Christmas holiday and  it didn't make it through the first visit from the kids.  Will have to make more tomorrow.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing.  Update:  This Christmas (2017) I had to make this candy over and over again as it disappeared very quickly.  I have also found that the pouring texture is better if the peanuts go in after the sugar has dissolved instead of waiting until 250°.  (Use a candy thermometer) Making sure the burner temperature isn't too high (I found my electric cooktop works best at med. high) and constantly stirring the mixture will help avoid burning.  I also used half dark and half white Karo syrup and the flavor was even richer.  Next time I'll throw caution to the wind and use all dark.  Maybe if I hide it I'll even get a piece.

Excellent! Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I made a double batch for a Holiday party I was hosting with other goodies to set around to nosh on. This was one of the very first things to go. Everyone was asking me for more! It was easy to make and clean up wasn't bad. Hope you enjoy as much as my guests did!

I followed the recipe exactly and used a candy thermometer. The candy part was really chewy.  Just stuck to all of your teeth.  I'm sure that I did something wrong, but I don't know what.  I really love peanut brittle and was looking forward to enjoying this homemade version.  Too bad!

My first time ever making peanut brittle and this was so easy. I took all the advice; lined pan with foil, kept the pan warm in a 275 oven, had a pot of boiling water ready to put the thermometer and spoon right into for easier clean up, had the butter & baking soda ready, used 1 3/4 cups salted peanuts and put them in at 250, omitted the other salt and added 1 tsp vanilla. It was so easy and is so delicious!  I will keep this recipe for years to come.

This was the first time I have ever made peanut brittle. This is a pretty easy recipe that yields good results. I made two batches. After reading the other reviews, I concur that this recipe was written for raw Spanish peanuts to be used, otherwise you need to add the peanuts to the sugar later than called for in the directions.  I added the vanilla in the second batch I made as suggested by others, but liked it better without. A good candy thermometer is helpful to have when making this.

I've made this about 5 times now using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 packed brown sugar along with 1 tsp of vanilla, also using salted Spanish Nuts. It was all excellent but I wanted the brittle to be thinner. To get it thinner I doubled the water. It came out much thinner and more delicate and I was able to spread the peanut brittle to almost 3/4 of the cookie sheet, which I couldn't before. I also heated the cookie sheet with parchment paper in the oven at 250 while I was making the brittle. By heating the cookie sheet, it gave me a few more minutes to get it spread. I also used a Spoonula (fantastic silicone spatula).

I've been searching other methods of cooking Peanut Brittle and found something I thought was helpful. Use a cast iron frying pan underneath the pot you're cooking the syrup in. This helps to spread the heat more evenly and keeps your pot away from direct heat.

Other tips were to rub the sides of your pot with a little vegetable oil, bring the sugars, corn syrup, salt (no salt if using salted nuts) and water to a boil on med high to high heat stirring occasionally to mix the ingredients. Once it comes to a boil, cover with a lid for a minimum of 3 min, remove lid and reduce heat to medium and wait for the syrup to reach 300 up to 350 degrees. Do not stir after you remove the lid. Remove from heat and add first the vanilla then the baking soda (it will bubble up), then the peanuts and last the butter. Then mix fast and crazy. Dump and spread. Worked out great!

Love it!  Made a rosemary and pine nut  brittle with it.  Chopped up about 2 t. of rosemary and then added in pine nuts.  It tasted just like the original peanut brittle (I've made this many times before).  But then I get to brag to everyone at Thanksgiving and say that it a "rosemary pine nut brittle" in my best English accent.

I've made this recipe 4 times in the last 2 days. Except for the addition of vanilla, I've followed the recipe. For those that are saying it won't harden, I suggest you get a new thermometer. It's a scientific impossibility for it to be soft if you cook the mixture to the hard crack stage. I've read suggestions to check your thermometer regularly... they do go bad. I've had it happen to me.  Note to self: do not use a plastic/nylon spoon. It will melt.    Another note, while at the grocery store I happened to look at the peanut brittle. Store bought has nothing on this. Hardly peanuts in the store bought version.

This was my first attempt at peanut brittle and it came out perfectly!  I followed the directions exactly with one exception.  I did not add the peanuts until the very end for fear that they would burn.  Once the sugar mixture hit the 300 degree mark, I turned off the heat, added the peanuts, gave it a quick stir to blend the peanuts into the mixture and then added the butter/soda which I had waiting in the same dish.  It started to clump up immediately and I had a difficult time spreading it on the cookie sheet.  I used a cake icing "knife" to spread it, and with some work I got it spread out sufficiently.  It set up perfectly, broke apart with ease and tastes SO YUMMY!!!  

You really need a candy thermometer for this unless you are experienced at candy making.  The chemical makeup of the sugar mixture will change at the 300 degree point and I imagine it would be difficult to see with the peanuts in the mix.  If it doesn't hit this temperature the molecules in the syrup will not bond properly with the fat (butter) when you add it, and it will not set properly.  Also, It changes dramatically immediately upon adding the butter/soda so I recommend having them in the same dish ready to go when the syrup is ready.

I have never made peanut brittle before and was a little nervous about making it as I have had some candy disasters before.  But I shouldn't have worried because this recipe made the best peanut brittle ever!  Following the advice of some reviewers I didn't put the peanuts in until around 250 degrees because I didn't want them to burn and I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla along with the butter and baking soda after removing it from the heat.  These changes made a wonderful tasting brittle that is as good or better than any I have tasted before!!

This is a five-star keeper if ever there was one. Once made, it is addictive and often disappears soon after being made. I made the recipe exactly as listed with one exception -- not only did I butter my cookie sheet before pouring the brittle, but I also buttered the brittle once it was nearly set. I then blotted off the excess butter before it got ugly looking from cooling. It gave the peanut brittle just enough of an extra bit of salty/buttery taste so that eating it was PURE HEAVEN. On the whole, I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe.

Tried to make it the first time and promptly burned it as per my cheap candy thermometer.  Decided not to let that beat me and tried it again. It came out wonderful.  I used a little less baking soda, 1tsp vanilla, and 1/2 peanuts, 1/2 almonds because I ran out of peanuts.  It hardened beautifully.  Husband said it was better than his mom used to make.  Do yourself a favor and invest in a good candy thermometer to save yourself a lot of trouble.

easy and delicious!  I've used raw peanuts in the past which are nice, but I prefer using roasted/salted peanuts and stir them in after the sugar is at least at 280 degrees or they'll burn. :)

Turned out perfect! Was my 1st time making it, (besides in high school Homec!) and I was very pleased. I got lots of compliments from people that have tried making it before. Just be sure to watch it carefully or it will get too dark and get a burnt taste. My 1st batch had a little burnt taste. Second batch had a beautiful color and taste.

I burned the first batch because the candy thermometer wasn't in the proper place. Second try was perfect. Just make sure the candy thermometer doesn't touch the bottom but that it's submerged in the liquid.

Is my candy thermometer broken?  It took FOREVER to get to 300 degrees,  and when it did, the candy was the color of milk chocolate.  It was burnt through and through,  although I was very very careful to take if off BEFORE it got to 300 degrees.

This is good, but I was a little disappointed because it was not as good as most reviewers said. It really just needs something else. I added the vanilla as many people said this was needed and it still was a little bland. Maybe a little brown sugar will help? Also, everyone is right about having your ingredients ready to go, this definitely makes the process much easier. Lastly, do not put the peanuts in until just before 300 degrees if you are not using raw. I put mine in at 275 degrees and some of them have a slight burnt taste. I would like to give this 4 1/2, but since I can't, I will give it a 4. I will definitely try this again.

This came out so yummy... I will make it again for sure. I had no problems...the tip about having everything measured out ahead of time was great. Next time I make this I will add some vanilla or almond extract just for some deeper flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

1st time I've ever made peanut brittle and I'm so glad this was the recipe I found.  It was so good I almost ate the whole pan just tasting it.  I have to make another batch just to give some away which was my original intension.

first attempt at peanut brittle for me and it worked perfectly!!! I did NOT have a thermometer on hand so I did the "drop in the water test"....then boiled for an extra 5 minutes, added the butter/margarine, then the peanuts, then the baking soda. I forgot about the vanilla but will add next time. You have to work VERY fast once you take it off the heat, overall I am very with the recipe and will use it again, thank you!

If you are making this and you live above sea level, adjust your cooking time.  I live at 6000 feet elevation and I got brittle threads at 276 degrees.

This recipe was fantastic! I was looking around for something to give to my seceret santa at school, and came across this.         Right after i added the butter and baking soda it turned a much more creamy-yellow color which scared me at first, because it didn't look anything like the picture. However, after i stirred it some more, poured onto the pan, and cooled it down i turned back to a good looking color and it was just great.

I have made Peanut Brittle many times before and this was the simplest recipe I have ever used. ALWAYS use a candy thermometer, and make SURE it reaches 300, you CAN'T cheat this and it WILL take a bit of time. If you do, don't complain cause it WILL come out CHEWY. (This is true of ALL candy recipes :D) also I added a little vanilla and cinnamon! PERFECT!!!!

If you do not have a candy thermometer, A. Go buy one before you make this recipe and B. Do not try to make this recipe and rate it one star when it does not turn out. I made this with a candy thermometer, and it is WONDERFUL. The BEST peanut brittle I have EVER made. SO GOOD!!!

Fantastic recipe! I made one batch with vanilla and one without and I prefer NO vanilla. It tastes more like traditional peanut brittle. And I did one batch with 1 cup peanuts and one with about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups, and I preferred just 1 cup of peanuts. It's plenty and they didn't overpower the candy part, which I happen to like. Great recipe! This will become a staple for holidays and gifts!!

Simply fantastic- I am now the designated candy maker in the family thanks to this recipe. I use pecan pieces instead of peanuts, and they give this recipe a wonderful hint of praline.  Definitely make sure to have all your ingredients measured out before hand! Also, I put a large sheet of parchment paper on my tile countertop and spread the brittle on top of that to cool.  It makes clean up a snap and there is no chance of the brittle sticking to any surface.

Just finished making my very first batch of Mom's!Seems to be a raving success as I used every suggestion.I actually started out using another recipe and decided to check allrecipes for helpful hints and lo and behold here I am! My recipe was a bit larger and I used pecans but, it didn't included salt and it didn't offer advice about how long it took to heat up initially(I thought my thermometer was broken at first)and yes,after 250 degrees it does shoot up fast. I made sure to really watch and not stir overly much at the end. I had everything premeasured ready to pour and stir. I also used over a teaspoon of butter to grease the pan(warm)so the brittle spread all by itself as I poured. I am writing this as I wait for it to cool so I can have some. I broke of some off the wooden spoon I used. Delicious! Now I need to know how do I clean this pot?!!!

I doubled the recipe and wouldn't recommend doing that.  The peanut brittle is good, but very hard to spread.  Also it took a very long time to get the mixture to the right temperature, but it did eventually get there, so be patient if yours takes a long time.

This was the first time I have ever made peanut brittle and it turned out very good. I only had salted peanuts, so I omitted the salt and didn't add them until my candy themometer reached 280. I was impressed.

Great flavor.  Made two times, the first time it was perfect but the second time it was too chewy.  Not sure what I did because both times I followed the recipe exactly.  Don't give up if it doesn't turn out the first time, worth the second shot.  It is the best peanut brittle when you get it right.

If you can get this recipe JUST RIGHT it is the best you can make. KEY TIPS- Cook slowly over medium heat. It will take forever- but it will not be right otherwise. Also- make sure you reach 300 before taking off heat-better to go a little over than even 1 degree under-believe me! Good luck!

3 stars because it has potential but as written I had problems.  I followed the recipe exactly--the peanuts taste scorched and it's not as clear and pretty as I expected.  Glad I tried this in advance of the holidays cause this wasn't a winner for me.

This recipe is one of my favorites.  I have made this over 20 times and it always is perfect.  I have sent quite a few people over to this site just to get this recipe.  The only change I would suggest is to make a few batches because it does not stay around long.

This, by far, is the best peanut brittle ever!  I have made this recipe for 2 years now, and it is fool proof and so popular!  

Put the peanut brittle in a festive tin, and it makes a great Christmas present.  The only complaint I get is there is never enough!

This turned out great! thanks for the recipe.. The only thing I couldn't get to work was the "pulling forks".. so as soon as I poured it into the pan I picked it up tilted it back and forth until the brittle evened itself out!! Worked pretty good. I will have to practise with the "fork" thing! Thanks again!

Tip: make sure all baking soda gets into pot.  Put it on a little plate or in a bowl.  Don't leave it sitting on the stove where someone like Joe can spill it all at the crucial moment.  It was great peanut brittle and we have already made three batches.
YUMMY

While the taste was delicious, I could not get the candy to set. I tryed SEVERAL different batches and it always turned out light colored and similiar to taffy. Using real butter did give the candy a very nice though.

I made this recipe as directed, stirring every few minutes. I accidentally let a few extra minutes pass and my temperature went up to 305 degrees  (302 is hard crack).  It turned out to be a great accident as the brittle was hard but broke easy, and didn't get stuck to your teeth. I will cook that long every time from now on. Tip: don't use too much butter it will leave the brittle greasy.

This is a great recipe.  Made two batches in less than an hour and my family LOVES it. 
  My wife doesn't like peanut brittle bought from the store.  She says it's to hard on her teeth.  I let this come to a rapid boil once proper temperature was reached. Then quickly stirred in the butter and baking powder.  Poured it on the cookie sheet, spread it and put it outside.  That left a lot of air in it so not as hard to chew.

I have done this several times, and it either came out perfect or didn't harden/set then I realized that the times that it didn't set was on rainy days so those of you that gave a 1 star and said it didn't set all I can say is was it raining that day? If it was, maybe that was the problem not the receipt. I don't know if it's the humitity in the air or the drop in barometric pressure but it does seem to affect it in my experience. So if it failed, try again on a sunny day.

Wow! I don't know how it could be better. I doubled the recipe and added raw peanuts(2 1/2C) when the sugar and water 1st boiled. I used 1C white and 1C light brown. Stirred frequently until 300* hit on candy thermometer. Added 2t vanilla, butter and baking soda. Poured on warmed cookie sheet lined with parchment. Shook, tilted and spread with wooden spoon and let cool. Really fantastic! Here's a tip from Julia Child's television show.  Boil 2c of water and add 3T baking soda, throw in the nuts and boil for 4 or 5 minutes, rinse with cool water and the skins come off the peanuts easy.

Nice Nice recipe! I used this to make a few batches of sugar free brittle for my father at his request. I did make the 1st batch as written before making the changes to suit my diabetic father. Both ways were rather good. And I'm sure he will be most satisfied being able to enjoy his batch that was made with Splenda & sugar free honey alternative...note, agave doesn't work well as I have found. However, this recipe should be well received as my children liked it both ways.

I have tried this a few times.  This is a hit with everyone who have tasted it.  I use mixed nuts to give it a little flair and also add a dash of vanilla.

Super easy!  Used 1 1/2 cups peanuts instead of a cup.  Preheated the cookie sheet and the brittle spread easily.  Thanks for the tips about having the baking soda and butter ready, cause you need to move fast!  Also, the temperature moves quickly after it hits 250 so watch carefully!  I will be making this one again and again!

This was really good! I had never made brittle before. I was terrified to try it because it's one of those things that's really easy to make... and really easy to ruin :P So I manned up and tried it with chopped pecans instead of peanuts. I surprised myself and DID'NT burn it and everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great IF you do not put the peanuts in until the end.  Every time I put them in when it said, lots of them sank and burnt.  But when I stir them in at the end, right before the butter and soda, it works great.

I made this as the recipe said and it was delicious! I also too the advice from another reviewer and kept the pan in the oven, just to keep it warm. The brittle spread very easily with no mess. I will definitely make this again. I think I may buy a Candy thermometer that hooks to the pan for the next time.

Hopefully the third time will be the charm. I made two batches that did not turn out whatsoever. They never got hard or a good color. Have never made this before so it was a stab in the dark, also I didn't have a candy thermometer. BUT I WAS JONSE'IN FOR BRITTLE! Pretty sure I got a winner this time, stirred for 12-14 minutes, thats the trick. I'll let ya know how yummy it is. Thanks for sharing.
UPDATE: Ok, they're done, one outside for a few minutes and one straight into the fridge for a few. The first batch I did was good, hard and crunchy with a little stick to the teeth going on. Batch 2 OMG!!!! This batch I let get a little darker carmel color while still on the stove. Was a little faster with the soda and butter, mixed up quick and poured onto  sheet. WOW!!!! Finished product is a little darker than batch 1 and 1000 times better!!!! Dinner is served!

A good recipe, but to make it great use salted mixed nuts.  I made two batches, one with unsalted nuts and one with salted mixed nuts since that was all I had left, and the mixed nut batch was amazing!  The saltiness was a nice balance to all of the sweetness and the mixed nuts give a nice contrast of texture.

My mother always spread the peanuts on the tray and then poured the candy over it, but I trusted this recipe and put the peanuts in while it was cooking.  Ruined.  The peanuts taste like burnt fat. What a waste.

I really didn't want to say I screwed this recipe up badly because of pregnancy brain, but I may have to after all.  The first word of the directions is most important.  GREASE.  Do not underestimate the power of GREASE.  I'm sure the end result normally is fabulous but I was only able to get a tiny piece off the cookie sheet to enjoy before throwing it out.  (Yes, I tried putting it in the oven to loosen it but I left it in too long and it ended up on spilling over creating a lovely cloud of burnt brittle through out the house while being serenaded by the sound of my smoke detectors.)  Also somehow my sneakers make that sticky sound when I walk in the kitchen.  Maybe I'll try this again another day, a day after May of next year.   To the next reviewer:  Please don't destroy me for my day of stupidity.

Delicious!!!  After reading ALL the reviews I too added the vanilla to it and the flavor is amazing.  This is better than any store bought I have had.  I will be making tons for Christmas gifts this year; thank you for sharing.
Do yourself a favor and buy a candy thermometer; I got mine at Wally world for 3.50, a small price for something so easy and delicious and it is well worth the small price.

I used roasted pumpkin seeds instead of peanuts ( due to allergys in classroom) and added 1 tsp vanilla to the water. This worked great! YUM!!

I usually don't ever give 5-stars to any recipe but this is an exception.  Awesome peanut brittle.  It's so much better than the grocery store versions, of course, and it also beats other peanut brittles at specialty shops that I usually fork out the money for.  

I made the first batch using the recipe above, adding 1 tsp vanilla and increase salt to 1/2 tsp as I like it a bit salty.  Perfect!  The four of us finished the whole batch in 15 minutes.

So I made it again, same day, an hour later, but this time i doubled the recipe and increase the peanuts to 3 cups.  This batch is not as great as the first one I made because:
* the peanuts are not as roasted / toasted as the first batch, either because I increased the amount of peanut more than what the recipe called for, thus it didn't toast as well.  Or maybe the peanuts of the second batch are of inferior quality (not as fresh) thus causing the problem of the peanuts a bit under 'cooked'.  Next time, I think I will roast the peanuts to perfection, and add them in right before the 'hard' stage.

* I used the 1/2-sheet for the double batch and it makes the brittle very thick.  Unless you like to make thick brittle, you might want to use two of the 1/2 sheets.  The first batch spread on a 1/2 sheet beautifully.

I think this will be my weekly routine now, making peanut brittle every Sunday.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first time making peanut brittle & I was very nervous but it turned out wonderful. Every time my husband ate it, he said it's the best he's ever had. I'll now be using this recipe every Christmas.

I do not have a candy thermometer. Maybe my test didn't work right, though it had 'brittle strands' in the water, because I've even had the brittle in the freezer for two days and it hasn't hardened. The kids have enjoyed it, but it's a big sticky mess. I'm not sure if I'll try this again or not.

I've never attempted a candy recipe before, and I must say that this turned out PERFECT on the first try!! So yummy!! I gave it to friends for Christmas, and I'll probably do it every year now!   *A tip- I warmed my parchment-lined cookie sheet before pouring the mixture onto it. Spreads easier, and you won't need to grease the pan! =)

I'm working on my third double batch.  I had never made brittle before, but it really is very simple.  Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I put foil-covered pans in the oven while the brittle is cooking and pull them out at about 280 degrees and spray them with butter-flavor non-stick spray.  Also, I've got a bowl of water boiling in the microwave to dump in the pot when I'm finished and cleanup is a snap.  The hardest part is pouring a double batch and getting it spread out before it starts to harden.  I suggest recruiting help for this part.  Good brittle, thanks for the recipe!

Perfect! Added in the peanuts and a bit of vanilla at the end like some other users and it turned out great. Also I replaced the corn syrup with Golden Syrup as we don't have corn syrup in the UK.

My boyfriend & I tried this recipe last night! We had never made peanut brittle before & boy are we happy with the results! We made sure to measure everything beforehand because you do have to move fast once it hits 300 degrees! Also, this would have been impossible without a candy thermometer so make sure you have one! We used dry roasted unsalted peanuts & that's what we'll use again next time..it turned out PERFECT. Thank you for this recipe! It's a keeper!

I'm sure this recipe is great if you have a candy thermometer....I, however, did not. Thus, I ended up with very gooey caramel covered peanuts lol... I'm gonna freeze it and see if eating it frozen might make it a lil easier to chew...oh well...lesson learned....

This was my first time making peanut brittle and I had a bit for trouble with the temp because I did not have the correct size pan. Other than that it turned out good. I did add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.

I made this using whatever nuts we happened to have (almonds, mixed, honey roasted peanuts, airline peanuts) and it turned out AMAZING.  I've never tasted a nut brittle that tasted so much like nut and so little like tooth-sticky-sweet.    Thanks for the clean up tip of having boiling water on hand-- whoever wrote that.  I had the teapot ready to dissolve whatever residue was left in the pan.

I was a little nervous at first because I wanted it to be perfect.....just like my grandma used to make. I followed the directions exactly  and when I took that first bite all the memories of my grandma came back to me! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will make it every year during the holiday's from now on.....just like Grandma used to!

Amazing, one of the best successes I've ever had in the kitchen.  Making candy sounds so intimidating, but the directions were so easy to follow, and the most complicated thing I had to figure out was how to attach my brand new candy thermometer to my pan!  I followed the advice of several reviewers and added a teaspoon of vanilla; I also used raw peanuts with the skins still on, because I think the presentation is better when a little more "rustic".  While I didn't take the extra step to heat my pan beforehand time, or even grease it, I DID use a silicon mat on my cookie sheet.  No sticking, and easy clean-up!  I couldn't live without my silpat, and I know that next time I make this recipe (probably tomorrow), I'll break it out again.  Yum!

Great recipe, get items ready because it moves fast.  Don't like peanuts so used almonds.  Also added Vanilla Extract capfull and changed the Corn Syrup to Agave Nectar for a healthier choice. Agave processes better and corn sensative people can enjoy the Brittle.  Added 1/2 cup more almonds, like nuts and am trying it with coconut (unsweeten) flakes soon.  Almond/Coconut Brittle-sounds good hope it turns out.

This is very good! I made a few adjustments, though. Just minor ones. First of all, I used pecans instead of peanuts. (Tastes the same, though.) Secondly, I doubled the recipe. And instead of greasing a pan, I lined a baking sheet with tin foil and greased that with butter. It's easier clean up, and it's easier to break apart. The only thing that's keeping this from getting 5 stars is how buttery it is. I used another recipe where you cook the nuts in butter before you add them to the sugar mixture, and that's all the butter you use. This just seemed way too buttery. But besides that, it's excellent!

Hands down the easiest and best peanut brittle recipe I've ever tried.  I used dry roasted peanuts AND honey roasted (added at 275) and they both tasted amazing.  I did prewarm the cookie sheets at 350 degrees and it spread like a dream.  This is my new standard...thanks for the great recipe!!!

Awesome and easy recipe! Like everyone else said, be prepared to move fast at the end!   I used both raw Spanish peanuts and salted roasted peanuts and had no problem with the peanuts burning. I put the nuts in at the beginning and all turned out fine.   This recipe is great and easy for even the beginner. Get that candy thermometer though!   Total time from start to finish is about 15 mins. Right after I poured the brittle, I set the pan in some hot water which made cleanup easy.

This recipe was great!  As a candy maker, I've tried many recipes.  I lost my recipe and thought this one looked similar to mine.  Come to find out, it was even better.  Only difference I made was I added salted peanuts and put them in at the end right before the butter and baking soda.  I then spread it with the back of my wooden spoon that I used during the cooking process.  Again, great recipe!

I have never made peanut brittle before.  Extremely easy and excellent taste.  I have made 3 double batches, all perfect....everybody LOVES it.  I found it easier to set my cookie sheets at a 45 degree angle and pour, letting it slide on down, rather than forkin it. It is very important to have everything ready in place.  Thank you, thank you!!!!! Artsy

I made this for my Grandma and she loved it.  Said it was the best peanut brittle she'd ever tasted.  I used the warm baking sheet method as another reviewer suggested and it worked out great.

Wonderfully easy recipe!  No changes made...only poured onto buttered, foiled cookie sheet and pulled with a fork.  Yum!  Will make again and again.  You will have to work very fast before sugar sets.  Stick with regular peanut - I tried with cashews and that batch was not as good.

Awesome.  I've never made peanut brittle before, but my husband said his mom loved it.  And since I was making goodies for Xmas I gave it a shot.  Very Easy, Very Tasty.  I made it just as it said.  Thank You.  My mother in law loved it! And so did everyone at my husbands work.  I smell a new Xmas tradition.

This was the first time I have made peanut brittle. My family thought it was excellent, and when asked what they would have changed about it, they said there should have been more! Also a tip I found really useful (since I didn't have a candy thermometer on hand) was holding the spoon 2 feet above the sauce pan, and when the mix is one continuous stream, you know it has been cooked long enough. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely use this again!

This recipe is so yummy, and pretty simple to make. Always make sure to have everything measured out beforehand, because once it reaches the right temperature, everything moves lightning fast. If you grease the pan with butter, the peanut brittle tastes even better. Also, it takes a long time to reach 300 degrees, but don't get discouraged.The end result is worth it!

Pretty good - all batches I've made have turned out right (that is, not to runny or anything). The first batch wasn't peanuty enough for me, so I added more.  Also, I found the best flavor was obtained when I used Spanish peanuts instead of the regular ones.

I made 2 batches and it is wonderful.Like others have said reaching 300 degrees is a must.I thought I burned the first batch by the smell but after it hardened my children & I could not stop eating it.I tried the microwave recipe from this site and it never hardened.

GREAT recipe !   The only 2 changes I made was I used Parkay Butter Spray (fat free & calorie free) instead of butter& doubled the peanuts....Then of course I double the recipe, as my husband loved it the first time I made it.  Thanks for the great recipe

I made this for my mom she was looking for a good peanut brittle. This came out really good. I also did as others and did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, which gave the candy a nice color without having to cook it a longer. My mom was very please with the texture of the candy, Not to hard where you need a hammer to break apart.....Thanks Amanda

Great! First foray into making Peanut Brittle. I pulled mine off at 285 degrees and it was great. The forks were more trouble than they were worth. I ended up just spreading it out and letting it cool that way. I'm not too much of a fan of Peanut Brittle (made it for family and friends), but I even think it's good and have caught myself snitching a piece here and there.

Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I’ve now been making this recipe for 8-9 years.. I’ve had SO many compliments on it, the best being “I don’t like peanut brittle but I love yours!” - only real changes I’ve made over the years are to add in 1 tsp of vanilla when I add the baking soda/butter, and use 1 1/2 cups of peanuts. I do keep my buttered foiled pan in the oven at 200 degrees (recently discovered Reynolds Grill Non-stick foil which is AMAZING! Probably doesn’t even need to still butter it but I still do it, it‘s even better than regular non stick cause it’s wide enough to cover my whole pan since it’s a long roll). I very very gently spread it out with a spatula while sorta tilting the pan so it thins out but I try not to break it up too much— want those precious air pockets in tact. I always use a candy thermometer and ALWAYS check it’s accuracy by boiling water first (if it says anything but 212F at a rolling boil, add or subtract accordingly). Anyway thanks for the amazing recipe!

Yay!! Everyone loved this brittle. It was very easy and has a light crunch that we love. I hate a hard brittle. I used sweet and salty Spanish peanuts that I got at Costco. So, I didn't add the peanuts until it reached 250, like others had said to do when you don't have raw nuts.
 It worked perfectly. 
 But, the second batch didn't come together because I decided to try waiting until it reached 300/305 like some others had also did. Nope, that didn't work at all and I was left with a greasy hard batch. 
I also tried heating my cookie tray so it could spread further and I didn't like doing that because I felt it made the batch hard. 
I also decided after making 3 batches that I prefer to pour the candy straight onto the cookie sheet without using forks. The texture stays fluffy therefore it keeps a light crunch instead of getting harder. This will be a yearly holiday candy I will continue to make.
 We Loved it so much! Update: I didn't throw out that 'bad' second batch. After, a few days we decided to eat it, greasy or not. It turned out delicious. I can't believe it. Very light crunch and really not very greasy.

I added 1/2 tsp. baking soda and only 1/4 tsp. salt since I used salted butter. This recipe was very easy and worked perfectly. Tastes like traditional peanut brittle and set up just as it was supposed to. Thanks for an easy, awesome recipe! :)

This peanut brittle recipe is a bit dark for my liking. But am amazed at how many  people burn their brittle. Cook while constantly stirring is the only way to make good brittle. A thermometer is a must and the humidity needs to be 40% or lower. I use a dehumidifier here in Florida to get the humidity down so it isn't sticky. Put nuts in pan at the soft ball stage and by the time it reaches 305 degrees they will be thoroughly toasted but not burnt.

This recipe worked very well for someone new to candy making (Me). The only thing that surprised me was it is a small batch. It is more than enough for one person, but I don't think it would be enough for two. (Because it tastes good and you'd have to share. LOL)The candy thermometer is a must for new candy makers like me. Set up the greased pan and ingredients as this recipe dose cook fast and you have to be ready when it is at temperature.

I made this recipe for my grandad for his birthday and he loved it! He has been asking for me to make more every couple of weeks! It's super easy to make, just make sure you have a candy thermometer. When adding the peanuts, I wait until the thermometer is around 290 degrees because it can be difficult to stir through when the temperature is at 300. Great recipe! Thank you!

This recipe is the best! I brought it to my friends and he literally yelled out this is AMAZING. Thanks so much. Btw i have found it takes about 17-18 minutes to get to 300 degrees. I also add 1/4 more peanuts and it turned out great. Thanks so much i would give ten stars if it could!

I have made this recipe several times, always with great success.  I make it for my husbands work friends, who often request it.  It doubles well... I also add extra peanuts (like 1 3/4 C. per recipe), and a dash of almond extract for extra flavour...  The key is to make sure the brittle gets to 300* or it will not be crunchy.  A candy thermometer is a must!

This is definitely a fabulous récipe. The only thing I changed was the corn syrup. I used dark waffle syrup and it still turned out perfectly. I felt so proud when I broke it up and placed into the container. This récipe is the most perfect thing I have ever made. You're awesome, Amanda!

Silpats work great with this!
I had no problems with this recipe.  I forgot the salt but it did not matter.
I read many of the negative reviews and for all those who complain of taffy-like consistency; you simply did not get it hot enough.  I think some of the problems reported stem from not having a heavy enough pan.
Even using an infrared thermometer there is still some guesswork about the "right" temperature.  It will show hotter near the sides than the center.  For this candy you are looking for the sugar to be as hot as it can possibly get without getting a burnt taste.  Color is as good of an indicator as a $40 thermometer.  When you first start to smell burned sugar and it has a light brown color you're done.  It takes quite a while to get to this point but once it is done it is done and you need to be quick about spreading it.
The burnt peanut problem is probably from using roasted peanuts instead of raw.  Look at the back of the bag when you're buying peanuts.  Bags of raw peanuts usually have a peanut brittle recipe on the back...

It's my mom who goes into the peanut brittle making business every year for Christmas so I'm reviewing and photo'ing her creation.  She ends up making about 10 batches for various family members and friends.

This is the best!  Perfectly crunchy, packed with peanuts and hopelessly addicting.  I kept eating it as I was trying to take the picture :)

WOW!!! I did have a parchment paper lined pan, with the parchment sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, in the oven at 200. That helped the candy spread evenly. No problem with burning. I used unsalted peanuts and added them at the end. I did add 2 tsp of vanilla extract just before the butter and soda went in. Oh, it is perfect.

Perfect recipe!  I love pecans, so I used those instead of peanuts.  I accidentally let temperature raise to nearly 350 deg, but still turned out delicious!  Perfect color, sheen & crunch!

This recipe is tasty and fairly easy.  

I would definitely recommend adding the peanuts at 250 degrees, as they seem to scorch quite easily otherwise.  I also started using about 1 1/2 cups-2 cups of peanuts, otherwise you get a fair amount of brittle at the edges without peanuts.  


Not the best recipe ever, but certainly much easier than many of the tastier one's I've tried.

This recipe is awesome.  It was my first attempt at making peanut brittle and I could not believe how easy it was.  I used cashews instead of peanuts and it turned out so great that I immediately made a second batch.  I used a silpat and sprayed with Emeril's butter spray and no problems with setting up or lifting off.  Can't wait to make more, although it's quite addictive.  Hated to tell my Mom it was better than hers but wanted to share this recipe with her.

It turned out pretty good, was hard and breakable until you started chewing it and it began to soften and stick to my teeth. Maybe I didn't cook the corn syrup enough?

Perfect!  Super easy to make and set up perfect!  To those who have had problems getting it to set be sure to use a big enough pan and use a candy thermometer.  Candy making is science and if even one variable is off it can cause inferior results.

This is the yummiest, easiest recipe ever. I tried it when I needed some for another recipe and I couldn't find any in the stores. Now I prefer this over any other. Simple ingredients, easy steps, and ready in no time. I recommend NOT buttering the pan. It's not necessary and just makes the brittle greasy to the touch.

Wonderful...made the recipe as stated, and they turned out fabulous.  I agree with previous reviewers in that I put my sheet pan in the oven to warm it up before putting the completed mix on the pan, and by having the pan warm, it gave me additional time to spread the mix out.

Yum...Yum

My first time at making peanut brittle was a success, thanks for such an easy recipe.  I did read some of the other reviews and follow their suggestions. I used a 1 1/2 cups peanuts and it was about right, I used parchment paper on a large sheet cake pan that I had kept warm in the over and I added a tsp of vanilla with the baking soda, also added a 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I didn't add the dry roasted peanuts until candy thermometer reached 280 degress and brought it up to 300 before I added the baking soda and vanilla

OMG!  So amazing. I've never tried anything like this before, but this recipe seems fool-proof! I took the advice of some of the previous posters and added a tsp of vanilla as well as adding the peanuts once the mix reaches 250 degrees. I also lined a cookie sheet with tin foil and ran a stick of butter over it. Made clean up so simple! I popped the cookie sheet in a warm oven while everything was coming together. It gave me a little more time to work with the mix once I poured it out.  I started with a single batch to make sure I could do it...ended up making 2 more. 5 Stars++

This is good, but next time I will use dark corn syrup instead of the light one to give it more color. Since I used salted peanuts, I omitted the salt. Add the peanuts at the end. I also warm up the cookie sheet lined with silicon liner. I forgot the vanilla as suggested by other reviewers but still taste very good.

BOOYAH!!! This brittle is off the pan! First try....perfect. I took the advice of others and added the peanuts at 250 degrees F, 1 teaspoon of vanilla with the butter and baking soda, and kept the well greased cookie sheet warm in the oven until I was ready to pour the mixture.
Thanks for posting this amazing recipe.....everyone at the bus stop enjoyed the first batch....of many to come.

This is great!  First time ever making peanut brittle and it turned out GREAT!  I used 2.25 cups of peanuts and still could have used a few more nuts!  Also, I had the cookie sheet warming in the oven, and then when I had it spread out, I put it back into the oven to let it smooth out even more!

Had to make it a second time to get it right. Didn't have a thermometer so you have cook the candy until it drizzle off the spoon. Drizzle a little off the spoon into some ice water and its HARD then its ready. I must admit the first batch I used roasted peanuts and when I did the ice water test it, it looked hard but was kind of soft to the touch. hen it cooled, I microwaved it for about 3 minutes then put it back in the fridge. When I tried it, it tasted exactly like a payday candy bar or a snickers without the chocolate so it was still good.

I have never made Peanut brittle before. This was an interesting experience.
I used 1 1/2 cups of unsalted roasted peanuts instead of just 1 cup of regular.
I also added about a teaspoon of real vanilla. Also, I did half white sugar and half dark brown for extra favor. It turned out great. My wife could not stop eating it. It was not too hard. I was very impressed. I waited until the temp hit about 200 to 250 before adding the peanuts because I was a fit apprehensive of burning the nuts. Seemed to work very well

This is a pretty good recipe, but I have to admit, I didn't follow it to a T.  First of all, I didn't have raw peanuts on hand, so I added them just as the caramel browned perfectly, instead of at the beginning.  I also don't have a thermometer, but once you've made a handful of brittles you kind of figure it out.  Also, instead of adding the 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the caramel, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the peanuts along with a generous pinch of cayenne and shook them in a container.  (I don't trust too many ingredients in a pot with caramel--sugar gets jealous and crystallizes the whole darn pot.)

This was my first experience making peanut brittle, so I spent some time reading the reviews. I opted to add 1tsp of vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup of peanuts. Well, it was a huge success!!!!

I like to substitute the 1c peanuts for, 1/3 c peanuts, 1/3 c almonds, and 1/3 c cashews.  Excellent combination.  Everyone says this is the best peanut brittle they have ever tasted!  Thank you!

Made a double batch.

Used already roasted unsalted peanuts and took others suggestions and added them at about 260-270 degrees.

Also warmed pans with silpat liners in oven at 250 degrees while candy heating.

Pouring mixture into silpat lined pans using two oven mitts was easy and tilting pans using silpat allowed mixture to spread beautifully. Set outside on the patio for a 1/2 hour or so to cool. Easy to peel off mat and break. Very little mess. There were two burnt peanuts I removed with a pair of tongs before mix set.

I was going to use a bit of molasses but forgot, so added 1-2 T during cooking process to give color. Worked well for me.

One of my kids friends said it was better than her favorite peanut brittle recipe, so there you go.

Note on peanut amount - I used just over 2 1/4 cups for double batch. Plenty of peanuts and shouldn't believe I would ever want more than that (I'm a peanut lover!)

very good!! I did add 1/2 teaspoon extra of baking soda. next timemight add alittle more. to make a nice airy brittle, I took someone elses idea, kept my pan warm and once poured onto the pan, just tipped the pan to spread, not touching it. worked great. also added 2 cups nuts. could have used even more. but I like the peanuts.

Thank you so much! I have tried other recipes and have failed on all! This one was perfect. I turned up the heat in Incraments until I reached 310. 310 becauses is seemed a little crispier but I have to say the humidity was high this day! Thank you! I am proud to share it with my mother!!

I'm fairly new to candymaking, and really enjoyed this recipe.  I added the vanilla as suggested.  I was going to a bacon-themed party so added a 1/4 cup of minced pre-cooked bacon (although next time I'd do 1/2 cup) at the end.  Peeling it up immediately didn't really work for me (just broke apart), so this time (I just whipped up another batch) I'm leaving it in the pan to cool.

Excellent! Thinner the better. We made a lot of batches of this for christmas this year. If it turns yellow, it is done! haha. The yellowing stage is just a little bit higher than posted, but it will still turn out. Just be sure to pull it off of the heat when it gets to this stage. Colouring stays the same. So if you don't have a candy thermometer, this could work as an indicator.

This recipe is absolutely perfect!  I've made it twice and it turned out great.  It is so much better than store bought peanut brittle.  The only change I made was using 1 1/4 cups peanuts.  Also, you can spread the hot peanut brittle on a parchment lined baking sheet and it works really well.  Some reviews commented on theirs coming out too light.  You can heat it to 305-310 degrees for a slightly darker color & still have great flavor.

My first attempt at Peanut Brittle....and it came out awesome.  I do need to pass on to NOT use plastic spoon to stir.......it melts. A wooden spoon worked great.  AND when it says "heavy saucepan", believe it. When I made my second batch, I used a "not so heavy" saucepan and it burned around the bottom edges before it came up to temp. Actually still tasted pretty good, with more of a molasses taste, but not the typical peanut brittle flavor.

Excellent flavor and very easy to make.  I made a few changes, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla with the butter and added the nuts, 1-1/2 cups of cashews, at about 280 degrees.

I'd never made peanut brittle before, but this was pretty easy (except for spilling a bit on my finger while pouring it - OWW!).  It was a much lighter color than brittle I've had before, but tasted awesome.

I haven't eaten it yet, just finished making it. I used a thermometer and let it bubble FOREVER. It never reached more than 250. So finally I tried the cold water test and bingo. I'm hoping it hardens enough....  Looks good, could've been browner, but one it was spread and thin, it looks good.  Fingers crossed....

This is a very good brittle recipe.  I heated the sugar mixture to 305 degrees, added butter first, then nuts, then baking soda.  I quickly poured this mixture on a hot pan that I had kept in the oven and shook the pan back and forth to spread the mixture.   My first attempt was a failure because I used raw peanuts.  Yuck.   My second attempt was better once I used unsalted dry roasted nuts.  Next time I will use salted dry roasted nuts because I think the combination of salty and sweet will be really good. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to my recipe as others recommended but didn't like it. I doubled the recipe so that I could share with coworkers.

First attempt at peanut brittle. Success!! Easy recipe to follow. I used almonds  because that's what I had on hand. I followed reviewer's advice and did not add nuts until over 250*, especially since my nuts were roasted. If they are raw, earlier would probably be okay. I also cooked until almost 300* before adding butter, soda and used vanilla for more flavor. I'm inspired now to try different nuts and maybe give this for gifts!

I did not care for this recipe! Way too many peanuts and I didn't use a thermometer. I should have because the consistency was like taffy and then it all melted! It never set.

Great recipe!  I followed other reviewers' advice and added vanilla, increased nuts to 1.5 cups, and added the nuts at 300 degrees.  This was a perfect amount of nuts and I think if they were in any longer they would have burned.  Really great, though, I am making them again for Christmas goodies :)

Don't you hate it when someone changes the recipe all up?  LOL... I used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown and I also added a couple of tablespoons of molasses to my corn syrup because I didn't have quite enough.  I read the reviews and added the peanuts at 230 and the butter, vanilla and baking soda just before I poured the brittle in the pan.  After the nuts were added at 250 very quickly it started smelling too hot.  I was using a candy thermometer, but went ahead and dropped a couple of drops into cold water and it was ready to go.  My husband says he thinks it's a bit bland, although I'm not sure what I could do to add more flavor~ maybe a couple of teaspoons of vanilla instead of one?  We will be remaking this again in a day or two and we will be cooking it just a little bit longer.

Very easy and very good brittle.  Please use a good heavy bottomed saucepan - it heats much better.  I used to wonder why it took so long for the temperature to reach 300 degrees when I used the old wobbly pan I had before buying a good one!

Really Good!  I love the flavor of the butter and peanuts.  I didn't have a candy thermometer (guess I should go out and finally buy one) so I used the bowl of ice water method.  I didn't cook it long enough, but it gave it a really good crunchy first couple of bites and then it melts into this gooey caramel.  I almost prefer this to the crunchy counterpart.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper!

I am so PROUD of myself! I have NEVER made candy before, but this was soo easy! I messed up my first batch by pulling it off the stove BEFORE it reached the hard crack stage (300) It tasted great but would get stuck on your teeth. I decided to try it again. I waited for 300 exactly, and It tastes better then store bought, is perfectly crunchy, and a beautiful amber color! I left our the salt in both batches, and it still tastes great! GO ME!!!

I gave this three starts because, while the "Brittle" part of it is delicious, the peanuts tasted burned. I followed the directions exactly and do have experience making candy but this batch was a waste. I made this a second time and added the peanuts at the end when I added the butter and baking soda. It was delicious that way!

Sorry to say, mine did not turn out. Mine was more like taffy than brittle.  I followed the recipe to the nth degree.  The taste is good but it never became brittle.

I had used my mother-in-laws recipe for so many years until I stumbled on this hightly rated recipe.  Peanut brittle is my husband's favorite homemade candy, so I figured he would let me know right away if this wasn't as good as he had had growing up.  It was even better.  This recipe uses much less butter, which I like, and is fairly easy to make if you have a candy thermometer.  This is now the recipe that I always use.

Superb! Freakishly delicious! Gentle on the teeth! What more can I say? Yes, yes, yes, use a candy thermometer! This is total peanut brittle perfection. I like to use lightly salted peanuts. I'm going to try roasting the peanuts as someone suggested too.

I used 1/4 cup light corn syrup and 1/4 cup molases just because I ran out light corn syrup. And I use silicon liner and sprayed it with oil. It turn out wonderful. Crunchy but doesnt hurt your mouth with dark golden color. The only thing I would do differently next time is not to spray the silycon liner with oil. It was kind of oily and I had to blot it with paper towel.

Fabulous!  Best peanut brittle I've ever tasted.  This was my first time attempting to make any candy.  I read all the reviews and made lots of notes before starting.  As recommended, I had everything assembled before I started cooking.  I used a candy thermometer.  I used half white and half brown sugar, and salted cocktail peanuts.  Omitted the salt, and did not add the nuts until the very end.  I also filled my sink with hot soapy water so that when done I could put my pot directly into the hot water.  Cleanup was a breeze.  I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper and put it in the oven at 170 degrees until needed.  I used the two fork method to spread the candy on the sheet.  Everything worked perfectly.  I will certainly do this again.  Thanks Amanda, and all the reviewers who helped to make my first attempt such a good experience!

delicious! (and easy.) i had never made candy before, and this came out WAY better than i expected. i used all the peanuts, as per the recipe, but i did add a bit of vanilla, as suggested in one of the reviews. this panned out really well for me.  so, i made two double batches. the first batch was without the use of a candy thermometer. i tried the cold water test, but i think it will form brittle threads LONG before it reaches 300, so i don't think this is trustworthy. i just trusted my gut, and when the color turned caramel and the consistency thickened up, i figured it was done. it turned out GREAT. my boyfriend came home w a candy thermometer in time for the second batch. i figured i'd be more precise, so i made that batch according to the reading on the candy thermometer. guess what? the first batch actually tasted better! :)

Not super impressed; my friend and I made two batches... The first batch the peanuts burnt because I guess we wern't stirring enough and then the whole thing tasted burnt.  The second batch we waited to add the peanuts in when the candy thermometer reached 300 and the end result was light yellow in color; when I poured it out it was so thick that we couldn't bite into it once it cooled!..  I would also add a little more peanuts since there was too much candy imo...  I'm taking fault for most of these mistakes since it was both our fist times making peanut brittle or I would have given this a lower rating!...

A good classic peanut brittle. I added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla (as per another reviewer). Already in a gift box and looks tasty! Next time I'll try cashews!

Thanks for the rater's suggestion to have everything measured for the second step after reaching 300 degrees.  The only thing I was not prepared for was the length of time it took to go from boiling to 300 degrees.  I would estimate 30-40 minutes, so just be aware.  I stirred pretty much the whole time.  The flavor is great.  I doubled and poured on to two cookie sheets.  Came out great.  Reminds me of my grandmother's peanut brittle.

I made this for the first time last night and it turned out wonderful! I tried making a microwave peanut brittle, but it was super chewy and got stuck to my teeth so I had to throw it because if I gave that out in my Christmas goodie baskets I may have a couple people coming after me with dental bills. I will make this recipe again. In fact, I am going to make another batch today so I can make sure I will have enough for everyone! Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was amazing!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.  This is the first time I have ever made peanut brittle but it certainly won't be the last.

Great recipe and everyone loved it but I do recommend purchasing a candy thermometer if you don't have one.  There's just a very narrow window to hit or maybe I'm impatient but I consistently make one bad batch (too soft or burnt) and one good batch.  Do have all of the ingredients ready like everyone else has said.

An excellent, fool-proof recipe. My first batch turned out great. I wasn't sure what kind of peanuts to use (raw v. roasted)until I read into the reviews, though, but that's what the reviews are for.  Next time, I think I will add a tablespoon or so of Islay Malt Scotch to give it some kick and a hint of peat smoke flavor. I did that with some pecan pralines a few years ago and it really sent them over the top.

This is a great recipe to make around the holidays for a homemade gift.  Make sure to use raw peanuts in this recipe, or else the it might end up tasting a little burnt.

I made 14 batches of this recipe 3 months ago to give away at Christmas. Of course I made a batch for us also. This is the VERY BEST EVER!!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will be making every year for now on.

Delicious!  I broke my candy thermometer as I was making this, but just kept cooking it until it developed the right color.  Turned out perfect!  I used cup and a half of sesame honey cashews (from Trader Joe's) instead of peanuts: the sesame seeds went all through the brittle and created a to-die-for texture.

This peanut brittle turned out perfectly the first time. I followed the recipe exactly and when the temperature reached 300, I turned it off and added the butter and baking soda. (make sure to have it measured and ready to add quickly) I did double the batch, and the only thing I would do differently is pour it into two different pans and not try to fit it all into one. I used a 17 X 12 Jelly roll/sheet cake pan, and it was still too thick to try to add it all on there and it took a long time to cool and then it was difficult to break as it was really too thick. It still turned out delicious, but next time I make it I will either not double the recipe, or use two pans for it to set up.

This is delicious, easy, and if you line the cookie sheet with buttered foil there's practically no clean-up.  I've never made anything like this before and wouldn't have had a clue what to watch for without a candy thermometer, but with one, it turned out perfectly.  I was planning on messing up at least the first batch if not the first two, but the very first batch is suitable for giving as a little xmas present.  Try it: you won't be disappointed.

This was awesome!!!!  I had never made peanut brittle before and was a little nervous, but this came out great.  I did follow others suggestions and waited to add the peanuts until 280 degrees.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract at the end.  Fantastic!!!  Everyone was eating it.  I had to make more!  Thanks.

Awesome! This is the first time I've tried to make peanut brittle and it is delicious! I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1.25 C peanuts. I lined my cookie sheet with non-stick foil. Brittle peeled off easily and no clean up. Definitely going to be a Christmas favorite!

Ok so here's the scoop...Im  a single Mom on a tight budgie, giving this as Christmas presents in pretty tins. Never made brittle before and suddenly I'm an expert LOL. This is awesome, I followed the suggestion to watch consistency and color along with temp and never burned a batch (275* for me) added a splash of vanilla and BEAUTIFUL results. I'm thinking about drizziling a bit of chocolate on top before I break this batch, cuz chocolate never hurts anything LOL. Cannot thank you enough for this recipe my Dad is gonna love it!!!

This brittle is delicious! The only thing is... be sure to grease the sheet with butter, you taste the grease otherwise. I made this twice. The first batch burned at 300 degrees but the second one was beautiful at 225.

Followed directions to a T but put it on a warm cookie sheet at the end.  The brittle easily spread over the sheet and cooled perfectly.  It didn't last long in this house so if you want to share with friends you need to easily double the recipe.  If you really like peanuts I would recommend adding another 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup to the recipe.  Oh, I did use a candy thermometer and it took awhile for it to reach 300 degrees.  still did the water test to make sure, but it took about 7 minutes of boiling to reach the right temp.

When I was growing up, our church ladies would make peanut brittle every year in the fall to sell and raise money for needy families.  I have hunted for years for a recipe that replicated the same taste, and this is almost it.  The only thing I did different is to add just a tiny bit of vanilla flavoring, but otherwise it is perfect.  YUMMY

Very simple! I was surprised at just how easy it actually was. I would not, however, attempt it without a candy thermometer. It changes temperature very rapidly and you would probably miss that. I do not even typically like peanut brittle, but this tasted fantastic. Will definitely make again.

This was so easy to make!  And delicious!  The only thing I am going to change next time is the amount of nuts put in.  It wasnt quite enough nuts.  Other than that, bringing it up to 300 degrees takes quite a long time so dont get anxious.

This is a great candy!! I made it and everyone loved it. I did not find it very had to make at all and the directions are clear and well written. 

One batch I did sprinkle with chocolate chips that I let melt for about 2 min then using a spatula I spread a thin layer on top. You have to wait for the chocolate to cool all the way before breaking but this was a yummy variant.

perfect perfect perfect This came out so good I put 2 of everything because I had guess over and everyone likes peanut brittle. But I didn't have any butter so I used  2 1/2 tablespoons of plane shorting and added 1 teaspoon of butter extract and it came out perfectly everyone loved it I will make more just to keep for when I have more guess over. Thanks PS. I WOULD GIVE THIS 3O OR MORE STARS IF THEY WOULD LET ME....

I made this with a high school culinary science club, and it is a very easy and nearly foolproof entry into candymaking.  I would like to try it with different nuts - macadamias, especially.

This recipe was great, except for the butter...  This had the taste and texture of toffee more than what I consider true peanut brittle.  My daughter loved it, though.

I used peanuts for the first batch then used a can of mixed nuts (because that's all i had) for the seconds batch- both were excellent.

FYI, I used salted roasted peanuts for this recipe. Perfect.

Wow! Is this awesome! Soooo yummy!! I gave this as gifts for family and friends for Christmas and Devali and got huge rave reviews. 

This recipe is not difficult to make, but it does take a really long time for the mixture to reach 300, so you're standing over the stove for what seems like forever stirring the darn thing. (20-25 minutes frequent stir time???) After quite a bit of time stirring the mixture, I finally removed it from the heat when it had reached only 275 F, HOWEVER it *DID* pass the ice water test with flying colors (a sample from the pot turned to glass-like material in ice water). (I only removed it from the heat b/c it started giving off a slight burt smell (although it tasted perfect) 

Having said this, the peanut brittle is definitely worth the wait, I'll make it again when I want an impressive gift (I leave it in huge bark-looking pieces for gits...so pretty) Also, I added more peanuts (1/8 cup..although it didn't need it, I just like a lot of peanuts)

Thanks "Mom"!

This was my first try at brittle.  I used salted mixed nuts instead of peanuts and it turned out awesome!  It never reached 300 degrees on the candy thermometer but checked out good in the water test at 260.  It has the perfect crunch to it, not too hard like some brittle gets.

I tried doubling the batch but came out to chewy as it was too thick.  Once I did a single batch, it came out too perfect!!  I drizzeled some dark chocolate on top after cooled and in pieces.  YUM!  I did follow others suggestions about cooking it a bit longer and adding vanilla to the mixture and nuts at the right time.

This was my first time making peanut brittle, so I was a little apprehensive. However, it turned out awesome. I couldn't have asked for better results - absolutely superb. The only change I made was to use two greased spoons instead of forks. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've tried to make peanut brittle so many times & have failed however now I've found a recipe that works!
I did add extra peanuts from other people's suggestions (i used 1 1/2 cups) otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I was surprised how long it took the mixture get to 300 but it was well worth the wait.  great recipe, thanks!

Delicious peanut brittle! The tips that I used from other reviewers were as follows: I used Reynold's non-stick foil to line my 1/2 sheet pan; placed sheet pan in a 250 degree oven (having a warm pan greatly aided in "spreading" the candy out); Used 1-1/4 cups of raw shelled, skin on peanuts. As the submitter and many others mentioned, you do need to have everything measured out and ready. This turned out fantastic, and is a recipe that I will use again and again!

Fantastic recipe!  Get yourself a candy thermometer, don't leave anything to chance.  This tastes great, and I look like a badass for having made it.  Terrific recipe for gifting.  Pull it out as thin as you can, people like it better when they don't feel like they're breaking their teeth to eat it.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup regular + 1 1/2 cups peanuts.  I also added in vanilla at the end.  Learning experience so hopefully i will do better next time.  Still turned out good!

Very good, very easy. But you really do need to use a thermometer because it’s simply impossible to guess unless you’re very, very practiced. I kept the cookie sheet warm as one reviewer suggested, and didn’t need to spread it with the forks. Be sure not to spread it with a spatula or you'll mess up the texture.  I also added another handful of peanuts because that’s our favorite part.

First time I’ve ever made peanut brittle. Followed the recipe exactly. Just the right peanut to candy ratio. Had a great crunch, then melted on the tongue. Peanuts cooked perfectly. Had that nice roasted flavor. I did take one reviewers suggestion of heating the pan in the oven and tipping the pan for more even distribution. I used the lowest setting of my oven 170F. Next time I will use more butter to grease my pan since it stuck in spots. All in all, not bad for a first timer! Thanks for the recipe!

5* This is the best peanut brittle I’ve ever made - light and airy, perfect color, spreading to fill a jelly roll pan at just the right thickness if the pan is warm. I made exactly as written except adding raw peanuts at the 300F. degree mark. This is the point at which threads will spin off the stirring spoon when mixture is dropped from a few inches. I lowered the heat and stirred the raw peanut mixture about 2 minutes to cook the nuts. Next time I will line the pan with parchment or aluminum foil because I think it would aid in breaking the brittle into larger pieces.

Perfection. I’ve made this recipe for years and give it out for presents. Everyone loves it. The trick is to WATCH that thermometer. Remove from heat at EXACTLY 300 degrees. Take it off too soon and it will stick to your teeth and will be difficult to break. Too late and it will have a burnt taste. I’m also very generous with the baking soda. The fluffier the better.

64 year old man's first attempt at making brittle for Christmas after Mother's recent passing; After reading most of all the reviews I adopted those recommendations that were somewhat a consensus. 1/2 white sugar + 1/2 brown sugar; upping to 1 1/2 cup of peanuts and adding at 280, preparing a warm cookie sheet and using parchment paper;  pour  in circular motion and move cookie sheet around to get a evenly spread;  have large pot with boiling water to dip finished utensils/sauce pan for easy clean up. Close to Grandmother's & Mother's recipe: Thanks for the Holiday memory now my Grandchildren will have a special treat.

I doubled the recipe and increased baking soda to 2 teaspoons and added 1 teaspoon cayenne for just a little kick. Mother-in-law who doesn't like spicy foods said it was very good and not too spicy.

I made this recipe today and it is amazing.  I'm not one to make changes to an original recipe, but I have to admit I forgot to buy the light corn syrup at the grocery store yesterday.  I only had dark corn syrup on hand.  But corn syrup consistencies are the same no matter the color in my opinion, so this recipe is delicious, easy, and it just works!   I love it, looking forward to surprising the family after dinner tonight!  This is going into our Christmas candy recipe book.

Will absolutely make it again! (already have - several times) I added 1 tsp vanilla, increased peanuts by 1/2 cup for a better ratio peanuts to brittle.  I prefer Honey Roasted Peanuts, but all are good - blanched, salted, not salted. Didn't try Spanish Peanuts with the skins.

Only problem I had - and took several attempts to fix it - was the temps before removing from heat, dumping on cookie sheet.  Brittle continued to heat after removing from heat source, so I had several burned or too well done batches before I was happy.  May very well have been pan I chose to use.  So I suggest making a 1/2 batch 1 or 2 times, get your timing and temps down before proceeding with full batch.

Gave as Xmas gifts, sold at Farmer's Mrkt, rec'd RAVE reviews from all.  So the 4 stars are because of my fussing to get end product and method I was happy with.  Ingredient wise - The vanilla and my choice of peanuts.

I read a lot of the reviews (which I always do before trying a new recipe) and here are the slight adjustments I made:  I warmed the cookie sheet in the oven while making the brittle. And I added the nuts (which I used about 1 1/2 cups) when the candy thermometer read 280 degrees then continued cooking until it reached 300 degrees. I also tried it with cashews. It was terrific!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Very quick and easy to make.

Since I'm not a good cook I thoroughly read through others comments, which I believe helped tremendously.  Added the peanuts at 250 (1 1/4 cup), added 1 tablespoon vanilla to the butter, had the softened butter w/vanilla & baking soda standing by.  I warmed the cookie sheet with parchment paper at 200, took it out when the brittle mix was at 300, took the brittle mix off the burner at 305 to add butter & baking soda.  I had a buttered spatula ready to help spread the mix. The parchment paper made spreading and removal very easy.  It came out great!

My dad is 91 years old and showing signs of dementia. He asked me to make him some peanut brittle because he hadn't had any homemade brittle since my grandmother used to make it for him as a child. I NEVER made it before and was extremely nervous about it but this recipe was so incredibly easy, it came out PERFECT! He said it tasted just like his mother's!

I live near Denver.  We are at 6,000 ft elevation.  For you high altitude cooks, remember to lower your hard crack temp 2 degrees per 1,000 feet in elevation.  I found mine at about  288-290 degrees.  Another tip, use unsalted peanuts and you can split sugar into 1/2 white and 1/2 brown for a darker richer mix.  Both work well.  When you think you have reached hard crack stage, wait just 10 seconds longer.

The best peanut brittle ever!   To ensure this recipe is reliable, I put a sheet of aluminum foil on a sheet pan and heat it to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.   Pour the brittle onto the warm foil covered pan.   I also mix  the softened butter and baking soda together evenly before mixing into the melted sugar so that the bubbles it makes when added to the brittle are all the same size.   

I add the peanuts (use Spanish peanuts they are crunchier) once the sugar mixture reaches 225-250 degrees instead of earlier - no burnt peanuts.  I also allow the sugar mixture to get to 305 before taking it off the heat because it allows the sugar to get brown enough to add to the nutty flavor of the peanuts.

When manipulating the brittle after stirring in the butter/baking soda mixture, do not use forks to move the mixture around - it ruins the bubbles.  Instead, try to pour the mixture evenly and tilt the pan to encourage an even brittle thickness.  
 Then cool as quickly as possible and store in an airtight container, since the brittle is hygroscopic and sucks the moisture right out of the air and gets sticky if you don't keep it in an airtight container.  

Awesome brittle.

I have never been able to make candy, fudge etc. This is the first recipe I have made that actually turned out. My only advice is to make sure you have a sink full of hot water to place utensils in because clean up is a lot longer than making. I also used a wire scrubber to get out of cooking pan. Thank you for this recipe, my first to succeed !

I made this as gifts for Christmas, and I was told "You make THE BEST peanut brittle EVER!!!" It is time consuming to make, a lot of stirring, but is totally worth it. I don't use a candy thermometer, just the cold water test and all 4 batches came out beautifully. The only thing I changed was an extra half cup of peanuts!

Just made this! I followed everything and it's fantastic! My stepdad's mom used to make this every year in her care packages and he loved it so much. She passed away 6 years ago, and he hasn't had a care package. So, this year I'm making him one. This was my first time making hard candy, and I really appreciate the recipe! Merry Christmas!

I've made this two years in a row and now my husband says I must add it to list of holiday baking.  It's very good and I do 1 1/2 cups of peanuts (we like peanuts) and I also add 1 tsp of Vanilla. I don't add the peanuts until temp reaches 250 so they don't burn. I also use Trader Joe's salted Blistered peanuts. Very yummy.

The taste was good but it didn't quite get to the brittle stage even though i cooked the brittle to 300 degrees.  It may be because I live in a high altitude climate.  I would make it again but raise the temperature to 305 and see if that makes a difference.

I doubled the corn syrup and peanuts, used 1/3c water, 2 1/4 c gran sugar, added unsweetened wide flake coconut. Salt, butter and baking soda was left as recipe called for. If you like coconut, this is very good! Does not last long when set out for the taking!

A friend of mine came to me one day and asked me to make him a batch of bacon peanut brittle. Okay, says I, who has never made a batch of peanut brittle ever before, surely the Internet will help me! After scouring the reviews, this was the one I went with. Here's the modifications I made:

1/3 c. each of white sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar (instead of 1 c. sugar)
1 c. lightly salted dry roasted peanuts
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
Approx. 2/3 c. chopped, cooked bacon, with some fat trimmed

All other ingredients used as listed.

What I noticed with this recipe is that the candy thermometer recommends it be submerged in at least 2 1/2" of liquid for accuracy, and this recipe only made enough to cover the little bottom bulb. I used a combination of the thermometer, the cold water test, and sense of feel and smell to bring the brittle to temp. The sugar/corn syrup/salt/water mix will significantly thicken as you stir, and it will get dark. I used the water test method at about one to two minute intervals to monitor whether the sugar was creating brittle threads as it hit the cold water. I noticed the mix started to smell like it was beginning to caramelize/burn, even though the thermometer read 250 degrees F. At that point it passed the brittle thread test, so I hurried up and stirred in the peanuts and the rest of the whole darn works, and stirred like mad until it mostly mixed thoroughly, then spread it on greased foil and let it cool. Worked out great!

I have tried many, many brittle recipes over the years, having a brittle addict for a husband. He has declared this one the best yet. I made it for Christmas using a few suggestions from readers, such as using half white and half brown sugar, adding the raw peanuts at 200 degrees to avoid scorching, adding a teaspoon of vanilla with the butter and bsoda. Warmed the cookie sheet to help the brittle spead out. The family just raved!

Came out great and easy to make. I prefer to use peeled halved peanuts. I think it looked better.

OMGosh! This recipe was fabulous! I never made peanut brittle before and this turned out better than I had ever hoped. I have heard horror stories about too thick and too hard when making peanut brittle, so my expectations were very low and this was better than the most wonderful in any shop I ever bought from. Making it again this year to go in my neighbors goodies boxes. Now you know that it has to be good to do that! :)

I used this recipe and the candy was just awesome. I used shelled raw Spanish peanuts and added them just before I took the pan off the burner to keep that raw peanut flavor. I also added 1t of vanilla. Best brittle I've ever made. Everyone loves it.

I thought I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't pull and stretch the brittle so that it was thin and it came out too thick and chewy. I will try it again until I get the hang of it.

I had no candy thermometer, so I took a guess,  I added some vanilla and a little more peanuts, then it did not turn out fully cooked so I put the pan into a very hot oven for a few minutes and it turned out wonderful. I would do it again .

This was so easy to make.  You are right, it seems to take forever to reach 250 deg but once it does it shoots to 300 quickly.  I went with more peanuts but that is just a personal preference.  So yummy.

I have made this several times and it is delicious!  The main problem is it's highly addictive and you can't stop eating it!  I used cashew nuts because that's what I had.  Have all the ingredients measured out and ready because you have to move fast!

My sister loves peanut brittle and she adored this recipe. I wrapped up a pile of this for her Xmas present. However, I thought it was a little bland. I would add vanilla or almond extract to the recipe as another reviewer suggested. Likewise, I agree to have everything together at once because it comes together FAST. Finally, make sure your thermometer is completely accurate. If in doubt, go pick up a new one.

This is the worst peanut brittle I have ever made.  After putting in the baking soda and pouring it out to cool, it had the consistency of taffy.  It never harden, it was a horrible disaster.

This is a great recipe, I just made peanut brittle for the first time using this recipe, and it was a big hit. It was very easy to do for those of us who actually use a candy thermometer. Although I did change one thing I added a tiny bit of vanilla that sounded good from another recipe, and I waited until the brittle was exactly 300 degrees to add the peanuts, butter, and baking soda.

This is THE BEST peanut brittle recipie! RAVE, RAVE, RAVE compliments on it from family and co-workers (and these co-workers are men). My husband thinks I should take orders and sell it. Everything about it is perfect. Crisp and light...not tooth-breaking hard. I will certainly be making this a tradition.

This was my first attempt at a hard candy type recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except doubled it. Helpful hint - raw peanuts are in the produce aisle, not in the nut aisle! The taste is great, I couldn't stop eating it. I took some to work, and everyone loved it. It did take almost 25 minutes to hit 300 degrees, so be patint and use the candy thermometer.

This is the best peanut brittle I've ever had!  I live in Virginia, so I've had tons of brittles, but this one was perfect on every note--not too buttery, not too sweet, not overly airy or crumbly, and since I did a rounded 1/4tsp, the saltiness was perfect for me too!  

I don't have a candy thermometer, so I used the cold water test.  However, I must say that you can really just go by color.  Once it gets to the color that we all know brittle to have, go another minute and you're done.

I forgot about the fork tip and I spread with a rubber spatula, which was less than ideal, because I ended up with 2 small holes.  Not bad, but not perfect on my part.  I spread some Godiva semi sweet baking chocolate and a touch of dark chocolate on half and did a light sprinkling of table salt on top.  Yum!!!

I think that this is actually better in a 9x12 pan, rather than the suggested one.

This recipe is perfect! I used Planters Dry Roast peanuts for it and it turned out so yummy! This was my first attempt at making candy. I blew it the first try because I didn't have a candy thermometer and relied on the alternate testing method, and misjudged that it was done. It turned out chewy rather than crunchy. The second attempt was perfect. Get a candy thermometer like I ended up doing - it's so worth it!

I made this peanut brittle last year and again this year, and I can't believe how easy it is to make and clean up.  Last year we made peanut brittle every day for a week because it was SO easy and delicious, we just kept making more to give away!  I don't usually write reviews but this is such an easy gift for the holidays.  ANYONE can make this.  I made a double batch; these were my variations based on the reviews: used 3 cups of peanuts for a double batch, added the peanuts at a little over 250 degrees to prevent burning, added 1 teaspoon vanilla with the butter and baking soda.  I'm a good cook but not a candy maker and my peanut brittle has been flawless every single time.

What am I doing wrong? I've tried this twice (and I'm a great cook but I have never made peanut brittle) and I followed the recipe and each time it doesn't hardden right and it gets what seems to be too foamy :( I cook it till it seems a nice carmel, sticky consitancy. Though I have no problem spreading the mixture (in a cold or warm pan) 

Am I just not cooking it long enough!?

I've never made candy before. This recipe was simple and easy to make. For the first batch I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Having a candy thermometer was a must for me. The next time I made it I tripled the batch. I was so nervous that it wouldn't heat up quickly enough that I cranked up the heat. It still turned out well but not as good as the first batch. 

I just made another triple batch and kept the heat on medium the entire time. I didn't add the peanuts until the temperature hit 275 to prevent them from burning. I poured it onto three greased cookie sheets. It turned out great! It looks and tastes like the 1st batch. Hooray!

I'd recommend this recipe to anyone!

Love it! This was the first brittle recipe I'd ever made or even attempted, and won't go looking for another. I did a test batch to see how it would go, and the entire bag disappeared in an evening. The second 'batch' was a triple batch, and the first seemed to turn out better on its own. The next time I make it, I'll be doing no more than a double at a time, and will see how it goes.

I have made peanut brittle before but this seemed to take forever to get to the 300 degree hard crack stage. I would add the peanuts after that stage because it smelled like it was starting to burn. I had the butter and baking soda pre-measured as suggested and that helped. 
I topped it off with semi-sweet morsels and spread them after they melted.

My first time making peanut brittle, and I was rather leery.  My worries were for nothing as this recipe turned out beautifully.  In fact, my husband said it tasted just like his mother's!  Seemed like it took forever to get up to 240 degrees but after that the temp went up rather rapidly.  The parchment paper on the cookie sheet, heating in the over, worked great.  Only problem I had was the parchment moving around as I rotated the pan to distribute the brittle.

I just made this brittle and it is now cooling. I am SO happy right now!!! Fantastic recipe!! I don't have a candy thermometer, so I went the old school way with dropping the sauce in cold water every now and again until it was turning into hard droplets. Also having all of the ingredients ready  so you can work efficiently is very good advise. Thank you!!

My daughter and I made this for the first time, to ever attempt peanut brittle.  We found the first batch disappointing.  We used all white sugar & added clear vanilla flavoring.  The batch was clear, no coloring.  The second batch, we added 1/2 brown sugar, dark vanilla and included the roasted nuts at 250 degrees to enhance the flavor of the nuts.  Perfect and we completed 10 batches.  Thanks for getting us started.

Hubby and I don't care for Peanut Brittle but decided to try what I made for Christmas gifts anyway.  Well...had to make a second batch because we ate it ALL!  
I've never made this before and thought it was very easy despite needing exact temps and timing.  I'm sure you could put a variation on this but why mess with something when it's perfect the way it is?

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it came out great the first time. I was using roasted Spanish peanuts, so I added them as soon as the temp got to 300. Like it was mentioned in some of the reviews, I would add some dark corn syrup to give it a deeper color. Plus, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and thought it could use a little more, so I'm going to bump that up to 1-1/2 tsps. Easy and good!

Delicious and very easy peanut brittle recipe.

I substituted pecans for the peanuts and tried two variations:

1. Subbing orange juice for the water and adding 2T orange zest
2. Adding 1/2 shot of bourbon after the butter but before the baking soda.

This is a nice peanut brittle.  I doubt that it is going to last the day because people seem to alter their course to walk by the bowl.

In the past, I've added the peanuts just as the mixture began warming.  It was better to put them in at 250 degrees.  Warming the cookie sheet was very helpful too.

The proportion of the sweet ingredients isn't crucial.  More or less corn syrup doesn't change things much.

I had very little corn syrup today, but the recipe came out fine.  Caramelization involves the breakdown of sugar.  At about 300 degrees the sugar crystals in table sugar break down and begin to caramelize.  If new crystals form, the candy can turn very grainy.  Adding corn syrup introduces a glucose that is slightly different from the glucose in table sugar.  The mix of sugars isn't pure enough to crystalize.  If I had not had a little corn syrup, a little vinegar or lemon juice would have prevented crystalization by breaking down some of the table sugar to create an impure solution.  

I used my infared thermometer so I didn't have to juggle the candy thermometer.

Completely deserves the 5-star rating! Don't be scared off by all of the comments stating how careful you have to be - get it off the heat when it hits 300 degrees and you're good. Ran out of light corn syrup for my third batch and guess what? Dark works just as well, only deepens the flavor a bit.

Very good. This isn't as sweet as the stuff you buy at the store and the peanut taste really shines. It's helpful to have an extra pair of hands to help move this from the frying pan to the dish, and putting the baking dish in a warm oven makes it easier to spread the brittle.

Best ever. If you like "thin" peanut brittle, this is perfect. I live in a high altitude area and made this per directions and it was wonderful. Great flavor, does not break your teeth! Family requests more. I tried to make a double batch and that did not work. It's a lot of work to make one batch at a time, but the end result is worth it!

Made this for Christmas gifts for this Christmas (2010).  Had several people tell me this was the best peanut brittle they have EVER had!  Very easy and simple recipe.  Just remember to stir the cooking sugar so it doesn't burn!

Very good recipe. We have made this several times over the holidays and everyone raves about it! Try adding a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little kick in the flavor dept!!! It leaves everyone guessing!

I have always wanted to make peanut brittle, but was unsure about it for a long time.  This recipe made it so easy. I made sure to have all of my ingredients measured and ready before starting.  I cooked the syrup to the firm ball stage, or 250 degrees, then added the nuts (raw peanuts) and finished cooking it to about 305 or the hard crack stage.  I used a rimmed cookie sheet lined with a Silpat that had been warmed in the oven at 200 degrees, and poured the candy onto the Silpat immediately after mixing in the butter and baking soda.  It turned out perfectly.  This tastes just as good as the peanut brittle a local church sells at the farmer's market.  Wonderful!

One of my friends made this and brought it over tonight. I have to say that it was the best brittle I've ever had. She did say that her first batch burned at the temp. suggested so she made it again and brought it to 225 degrees. It was crisp, light, and perfectly seasoned. =)

Don't hurry when bringing the candy mixture up to temp. That way it develops a deeper flavor and better color. Great recipe, super easy!

FIVE STARS! This is the best Brittle recipe! It is sooo good. Not too sweet, a little salty, and crunchy! I didn't have any problems with this recipe. The trick is a candy thermometer... without it, it would be really hard to get it to the hard crack stage by eye balling it. Now... I'd like to try making a mixed nut brittle with this! Yummy!

Absolutely Fabulous! This recipe is a definate keeper!!! After reading the reviews I would like to offer my advice. First...don't leave this to cook on its own, you must stir it the entire time or it will burn! Also, a warm cookie sheet covered in foil definately helps to spread the brittle out. One last thought, I would NOT attempt to make this without a trustworthy candy thermometer. You really do need this to heat up to 305 degrees or you will never get it out of your teeth! P.S. I also waited until 250 degrees before I added the peanuts. It turned out so good that I am going to go make more right now....but I really should be cleaning my house for my company tonight!

I made this for the first time to try before Christmas, and it is FANTASTIC.  I am a Toffee maker and everyone is WOWED with my Toffee, I think this Brittle will surpass the Toffee.  Plan to add it to my recipes to use as gifts.  LOVE this Brittle, it's awesome when you use pecans instead of peanuts.  I think I'll try it with pistachios next :)

Love this recipe....reminds me of home. :) The second time I made it though, I doubled the batch, did like it said but it's much harder than the first time I made it the day before. What would cause this? How do you get it light & airy? I also sprinkled a little coarse salt over the top when poured into the pan.

Used recipe with no changes except I doubled it. Everything went great until I poured it in the pan and my pan was not big enough.  LOL had peanut brittle foaming over the edges and running everywhere!  Finally grabbed a lid and let the excess run over into it.  But it still tasted great. If you double it use a pan larger than 10 1/2 by 15 with small edge :)

This recipe is great, but you can make it even easier in the microwave.  Check out the recipe "Microwave Peanut Brittle" by Joyce.

Easy and delicious! I used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar - and a little less baking soda than was called for. No complaints at all - this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have made this twice now and love it.  It's so easy and everybody raves about it.  Thanks for making me look good.  ;)  I added just under two cups of nuts each time and the second time I used half peanuts, half almonds...very tasty!

I made this for Christmas for family and friends.  It was my very first time ever attempting peanut brittle!  It was so easy--and I def. recommend using the candy thermometer.  I got so many raves about this--literally 8 people told me it was the best peanut brittle they had ever had!  Thanks for sharing your great recipe and for making me seem like Martha-Stewart in training!

This was a great recipe. My candy thermometer broke in the middle of making this, but I was able to use the cold water test and it turned out great. My only word of advice is to make sure you spread it thin. I made mine too thick (which was my own fault, not the recipe's) so it was a little different--but the flavor was still good!

I'm not a candy maker and mine turned out perfect. I used a recipe almost the same as this one except that everything was doubled for one batch and I only used a tablespoon of butter (not 4 like this recipe would use for a double batch) and one teaspoon of baking soda (not 2 tsp if i followed this recipe). As far as making the btillte these are the instuctions I got: Cook mixture (of sugar corn syrup and water and salt) over med-hi heat stirring occasionally until it forms a hard ball in cold water.(260F) Add: 2 C raw unshelled peanuts, 1 heaping tablespoon . COok until syrup turns a light color of brown, about 4 min while stirring contstantly. Turn off heat. Then add 1 tsp baking soda. Stir QUICKLY and pour onto buttered cookie sheet, spread it out to cool. I used my cake froster to spread it around on a large jelly rool pan that I sprayed with PAM. I also sprayed my cake froster with the PAM. When soda is added it foams up so be really quick. Let cool and break into pieces.  I made my brittle in my dutch oven and it worked well. The way that I cleaned my oven was by running scalding hot water in the pot until the sugar dissolved (note; my building has extermely HOT water so i'm not sure that would work in a regular house)

I must say I hate making peanut brittle. But I make it every year for my dad. This recipe is very easy and tastes good. I don't think it needs as much butter at the end, maybe half. Otherwise it's just too greasy and I know my dad won't like that, so I'll set it out on paper towel after it's cooled before I break it up.

Super easy!  I highly recommend warming the cookie sheet before pouring the mixture on it...and don't over-grease it!  Tastes great and easy clean up!  I will definately add it to my cookbook!

My husband requested peanut brittle when I began making candy for Christmas.  I have never made it before so I started with this recipe.   First batch, did not turn out, but was my fault, I did not let it boil long enough.  Second batch turned out PERFECT.  Boiled until 300 degrees on my candy thermometer.  As suggested I had all ingredients measured before I started and now I can see why.  You must be able to work very quickly because it immediately begins to harden.  I  used party peanuts so I omitted the salt and added them at about 250 degrees so they would not scorch.  First and last recipe I will ever use!  Super easy just make sure to follow directions carefully.

Delicious!  All the advice helped a ton.  I put a bit too much brown sugar in by mistake and they turned out great.  I like that the brittle isn't light like other recipes I have tried.  Looks store bought!

I don't know brittle & I don't understand what it has to be like. I used golden syrup, bc corn syrup isn't available in my country. I got three different textures! Chewy part, crunchy part and a part which was like fudge. I like the taste very much. Will try again when I can buy corn syrup somewhere.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was easily the best peanut brittle I've ever had.  (I used salted peanuts).  The only thing I would do different is add an extra 1/2 to 1 cup of peanuts.

Excellent, easy & delicious! What more could you ask for? :)  I used a 9 ounce can of cashews in place of the peanuts.  Would definately make this again.

i made two batches and both tasted good but very different!  i think i may have let the peanuts burn the first time a little bit so i added the peanuts a little later on the second one and had a very nice color with a lighter texture. very fun to make :)

This was my first time making peanut brittle and it was great!  This recipe is a keeper.  I followed everything exact and it worked out perfectly.  I honestly didn't read any of the reviews before I made it, but I think next time I may add just a little bit more peanuts.  I will keep this as one of my recipes for Christmas gifts. Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to add a teaspoon of vanilla and put it in with the butter.  I made another batch this morning and doubled it up!  Perfect =)

This was an easy and very tasty recioe, althought the britle was kinda chewy instead of brittle. Maybe fault of my own, but very good. I added pecans instaed of peanuts and only 1 1/2 cups.

Excellent. Didn't change a thing. I've done many others but none had me put the peanuts in while the sugar was coming up to temperature. This is a nice touch and makes it taste that much more of peanuts.

This gets five stars, but it did take quite a while to get it to the 300degrees. None the less, it was delicious and my Dad enjoyed it more than he should have. Thanks for sharing!

I had always thought that peanut brittle was hard to make, but this recipe is not only easy, but it does not take a lot of time! My boys loved it!! I did not have a candy thermometer, but it was still very easy because of the instructions at the top of the recipe.  This will be added to my Christmas goodies baskets every year!!

This stuff is amazing! Soooo easy too. I have never made any kind of candy and I whipped two batches of this up and they taste great! I made two batches and put green food coloring in one and orange in the other (for Halloween of course!) and they came out great!

This was an easy recipe to follow and it came out great too. Mine came out pale though, while my Mom's always has a nice deep amber color, toasty colored. I read another reviewer said theirs was light too. I used raw shelled peanuts, some still had skins on. We liked this and it is good, but like my son said, "we should call Grandma and get her recipe". I wish this made a bigger batch. I wasn't able to get it to stretch out with 2 forks as stated, so I just left it as it was to cool. I am still a beginner candy maker and have plenty of errors, but this actually turned out great and I didn't have to toss it! My microwave attempt failed, so I went back to old fashioned way Mom and Grandma always cooked theirs, stovetop and a candy thermometer. Thanks for saving my day with this sucessful recipe!

I don't know if it's because I'm a newcomer to brittle-making, but mine didn't come out looking quite the way I expected (the color was a little too light).

However, the brittle was SO yummy, that the color didn't matter after a couple bites :)

This is amazing peanut brittle!  It's buttery and crisp.  I used roasted peanuts and just waited to add them in when it reached the proper finished temperature.  Highly recommend!

Perfect!!!! I love that this recipes is clear to use a candy thermometer or follow the crack stage.  So easy anyways that it is hard to mess up.  Do not grease a parchment sheet, it will be greasy on the bottom.  I also used party peanuts from wal-mart and added them after the sugar mix was done.  Just enough salt and great flavor. Will keep this one in my paper cookbook.

I have had nothing but compliments on this recipe.  I have tried it twice so far (and will be making it again).  The first time I undercooked it and ended up with toffee which had lovely flavor and was entirely edible.  The second time I ended up with perfect peanut brittle.  I would make two observations:
1.  this is MUCH easier with a candy thermometer (unless you have lots of candy-making experience)
2.  Even though I used raw peanuts and stirred constantly they still wanted to burn (which resulted in undercooking & hence the toffee).  Make sure you don't use too big of a saucepan (especially if you have a gas stove!) as I think that contributed to burning the peanuts

This recipe was good, but next time I think I am gonna try some brown sugar or vanilla or something in hte recipe, it was sweet, but didn't really have the distictive flavor I am used to, may be my error, but I think you could play with this recipe, maybe throw some candy flavoring oil in it and have a much better brittle. Good for first timers!

WOW!!! This is the easiest I've made and best I've tasted.  Followed recipe exactly except used broken cashews instead of peanuts.  After spreading brittle on cookie sheet, sprinkled milk chocolate morsels on top and spread when melted.

Oh my! this was wonderful and easy. But I did have to make 2 batches. With the first batch I took it off at 285 degrees, mistake! I am now feeding that batch to the squirrels, they love it. Second batch was gone in one day. One more thing, don't stir the butter and baking soda too much. Thanks for a family keeper.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I followed everything exactly & ensured that the temp. reached 300 degrees.  I think I'm going to try dipping the brittle pieces into melted chocolate for a twist on the original recipe.  Thanks, again.

This was not difficult, even though I'd never made candy before. The keys are constant stirring and the use of a candy thermometer. Fair warning: it takes quite a while for the candy to reach 300 degrees, and it's hot work standing over the burner! The incomparably divine smell, though, is completely worth the trouble. Oh, it's also delicious. I thought the specified 1 cup of peanuts was just the right amount.

The first time I made this recipe, the peanuts burned.  The next time I added them after the sugar mixture had past the 250 degree mark and closely watched and stirred until the 300 degree mark.  The results were good enough, though not exceptional as I was expecting after reading the previous reviews.

If there were more than 5 stars, I would give it more lol. This was wonderful, just like gramma used to make. Thank you so much. I had to make several batches because my husband loved it so much I was afraid there wouldnt be any left for the holidaylol.

This is great peanut brittle.  The only time this didn't turn out for me was when I tried to double the recipe.  I learned that from now on I'll just make multiple batches.  It's also pretty quick to make.  I made a batch to take to a friend's house while my husband walked the dog.  Then I put it outside on our snowy steps to cool.  It melted the snow and cooled the candy!

I loved this recipe - very easy for this first timer and easy to double up the recipe.  I made 2 double batches one with the baking soda and one without - it leaves a wonderful contrast for the holiday platters - chewy and crunchy!

THIS IS SO GOOD!! I already made it twice in the past 24 hours. I followed the directions exactly.. with a candy thermometer. One warning though, they're extremely addictive. They were supposed to be for gifts but I can't stop eating them!

Awesome brittle, and very easy to make.  One suggestion just in case, grease the forks to pull the brittle, or else it just sticks to it.  I used toffee flavored peanuts, and my husband was trying to get into it before it had finished cooling!!  Very good recipe.

Great recipe and easy to make! You really have to watch the heat and make sure you stir after the peanuts are added while the mixture boiling toward  300 - I let it sit for too long and had a few scorched peanuts. Making a double recipes seems to help avoid difficulties.

This is the best!!!!  My husband and father loved it.  We liked it so much that I put some in a large decorated mason jar and used it as a Christmas gift.  I also added 1 3/4 cups of peanuts instead of the 1 cup but I left everything else the same.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Superb! The key is to let the mixture get up to 300 degrees, or you end up with soup or it re-crystalizes! I tossed in 1/4tsp each cayenne pepper and cinnamon, The spice is nice!

I made this for Christmas gifts for friends and family instead of a traditional gift, the next visit everyone was aking for more. It was a big hit, this recipe is a little time consuming, but it's well worth the trouble, I can't stop eating it myself. The next time I make it, I'm going to try subbing the peanuts with cashews. overall great recipe, easier than most

I've never made peanut brittle before today, and this was a good recipe to learn how with.  I didn't have a candy therm, but I did have a meat therm that I just held in the goo.  I took the brittle off at about 289 degrees or so and it turned out great.  I need to go buy a candy therm b/c my meat one died after this candy making experience.  oh well,  I only wish the recipe made MORE of this delightful concoction

My whole family liked this peanut brittle.  The recipe is excellent and makes a nice amount.  I will be making again soon.  No changes made or needed. Just make sure to remove from heat at 300 degrees, also used parchment paper on tray for easy cleanup.

This was a great recipe. Easy to make and tasted great. I didn’t use peanuts though, at then end, just before adding the butter I added pretzel pieces. It is peanutless Peanut Brittle! (We have two peanut allergies in the house) It turned out great and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Yeppers! My first try at anything like this and it was absolutely amazing. My first batch turned out beautifully, my second batch not so great, but we could still eat it. For some reason it cooked hotter and burned a bit. had the taste of coffee. Not bad if you like eating coffee.

This brittle turned out exactly as I was hoping. I didn't have corn syrup so subbed pancake syrup (maple flavored corn syrup) and it worked great. I added roasted, salted peanuts at 250 F as others recommended. I had no problem to pour out the mix onto the baking sheet.  The ratio of soda and butter gives a nice texture that is just airy enough to bite.

Actually the best peanut brittle I've ever had. 

My grandpa is a big fan of peanut brittle and I always do my best to find a good brand locally to give as a gift. This year, no luck at all. It's like nobody sells peanut brittle anymore, so I resorted to making it on my own. 

Made this 3 times. The first did not go so well. I'm not using a candy thermometer and my first concern was getting this hot enough to set. I read a review that said wait for a dark amber color then mix the baking soda, butter, etc. I waited too long and it tasted burnt. 

Anyway, dark amber color actually is way too long. Once you have a light amber color, keep stirring and waiting for it to darken up slightly. The tip about dripping some of the mixture into cold water worked for me. A light to medium amber color is perfect. 

If you use roasted peanuts, add it in with the baking soda and butter to avoid the burned taste. 

Overall, fun recipe to make. Had boiling water ready to help with clean up.

I did add a bit more peanuts (Total 1 1/4 cup) but it is delicious and set up beautifully. I did keep my pan warm in the oven before pouring the peanut brittle in and it did help to spread it out.

I followed the directions exactly and it never got crunchy. It stayed soft and the color is white instead of brownish tan. What did I do wrong? I made it last year and it was perfect. I must have used a different allrecipes recipe

I have been making this peanut brittle for three years, it is the easiest recipe. The only change that I make to it is that it’s a little greasy when you finnish. I use a silpat instead of a grease pan. Once it’s cold  I put it on paper towels to absorb the butter once it’s cooled.  My friends and neighbors love it.  I kept it a little longer then 300° and it became a pretty caramelized brown color. I also used multiple nuts in the third batch. I can’t figure out how to do pictures because I would.

This is the same recipe my mother-in-law gave me over 50 years ago with one exception. She uses raw peanuts and so do I.   I make it every Christmas for gifts and everyone raves over it! It’s really fantastic!

Awesome recipe. I cant make enough of it since I  shared with friends and family. Only thing I added or changed was I use Spanish Peanuts and leave out the salt. I also use a good capful of Pure Almond Extract as well as half white sugar and Brown sugar as it gives it a mor caramel flavor. Now excuse me,  I've got to start another batch. You know, Christmas and all. Bob appetit!

Loved making this. Easy recipe to follow. This was my first time making peanut brittle. Will definitely be making it again. Only wished i would have spread it out to make it a little thinner. Mine came out about a 1/2 inch thick. Either way I was very happy.

First time making brittle, not a disaster but could have been better. I took recommendations from the comments and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, added a tsp of vanilla extract and waited to add the peanuts with the butter, vanilla and baking soda at the end. I don't have a candy thermometer and I'm not sure my laser therm was measuring the candy right. After at least 20 minutes of boiling, and gradually increasing the burner temp, the therm read 278 degrees and I noticed a slight burning smell. Decided to finish the recipe and see what happened. To my surprise, the brittle hardened just right and tasted great!

I first made this recipe for a coworker who loves peanuts, and it quickly became a favorite that I take to fall and Christmas potlucks because it is so impressive yet secretly easy. The tip about having everything measured and ready to go is no joke. Things really speed up as the thermometer starts reaching 300 degrees F.

I’ve used this recipe now for years. I once made a mistake and added the 2 Tablespoons of butter when I added the peanuts.  It turned out to make aTo make it easier to remove from the cookie sheet I just get some Crisco on a paper towel and put a thin layer on the empty cookie sheet. Once it set, crack and remove.

I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out perfectly. The candy mixture comes to a boil quickly, so be ready with the butter and soda at the end. I tried the test of dripping a bit of boiling candy into cold water, and it worked great. Easy to make!

So I’m learning that this is a science but still ultimately comes down to skill. The first time I made this it didn’t go so well and it was more toffee than brittle. I learned how to save a batch and how to judge the color and not use the thermometer. Hover around the temp but it doesn’t have to be exact, add the peanuts at the end for the last few minutes if they are roasted, keep cooking till you have a nice caramelized sugar color... then cook a bit longer. Once that baking soda is in you have like 30 seconds to dump and spread, if it’s way too light throw it in the oven at 310°F till it gets a darker color, don’t use butter to grease your sheet. It’s was one of my first attempts at brittle so it was interesting, now it’s pretty easy as long as you research how to save your batch and have everything laid out before you go.

I added 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract...yum!!  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of peanuts.

I made it a second time and made a double batch... Don't Do It!!!  The stirring made my arm hurt!!  But, it came out just as good as the first batch!

Sooooo easy and sooo yummy!

Excellent!  Doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp vanilla and  1/2 tsp maple...best ever!  Texture was spot on.  Have everything measured out and ready before starting and be sure to heat to 300 stirring constantly to avoid scorching.  Added nuts at 260.  Will definitely make it again!  :-)

Loved this.   Added a few tips suggested by others.  I kept cookie sheet in low temp oven til needed then left cool for almost an hour.   I am wonderful if I could make a double batch of this at a time?

First batch I was afraid it was burning. Didn't get it hot enough.
Didn't brown and solidify as I hoped. 2nd batch perfect.
Went on a whim, put the first batch back in pan with a 1/ 8 Oz of water. Let it go to 250. Seemed to reach golden brown color took off stove and poured in pan. Started to set immediately.
I did not add more butter or baking soda. So far color, set up and taste a success.

I made several batches using this recipe.  I adjusted the level of salt to 1/2 t. for our family's taste.  Make sure the temp goes at least to 300 degrees or it will not be "brittle";-) Yummy!

Very Good. And easy. I've made it twice. The second time I doubled the recipe. I dont recommend doing that. You have to be fast pouring it out and spreading it before it starts to set. The more you have, the longer it takes to spread. enjoy.

Best peanut brittle ever!!! I followed other reviewers’ advice and added an extra 1/2 cup of peanuts. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract with the butter and baking soda. I packaged the brittle as holiday gifts, and it has been deemed “the best ever!”

It was easy to make!  It tastes delicious too! Problem is, I just moved to Florida and didn’t realize the humidity is such an issue so now I have delicious but tacky brittle!  I waited overnight before I sealed it up. 
I won’t make that mistake again...

Followed this recipe exactly but did almost double the nuts cause I like lots of peanuts in my brittle. Delish!

Plain and simple . . . YUM! I made it exactly as recipe directed the first batch. The second batch I split the sugar with half white and half brown. I’m liking the first batch better for sure but my husband likes the darker brittle. This recipe is a keeper. ??  Merry Christmas!??

This was the first time making peanut brittle and it turned out great. I added more peanuts, but otherwise followed the recipe. I was worried about cleanup after pouring out the brittle to cool, all the residual mixture was hardening on my pot and utensils. To clean i added water to the pot and put on medhigh and stirred with my utensils until mixture dissolved again.
Will makw this recipe again. Thank you

I have been making this recipe for 5 years now. It is fantastic, even been offered to be paid for some of my coworkers. I use about 1 1/2 cups of raw peanuts and add them as soon as everything starts boiling.  Will continue to make these every year beginning at Thanksgiving....to continue my grandmother's tradition. Enjoy all!

First time making peanut brittle. I looked away for a moment and when I looked back, the temp was above 300*! Yikes! But guess what? It turned out great! It didn't spread out as much as I wanted it to, but it's not burnt. And the butter gives it a really yummy taste!

I doubled the recipe and used about 2 1/4 cups of peanuts in doing so, but it turned out fantastic. Will be making it again once my glycemic index comes down.

Pretty easy to make. I did a double batch and took someone's advice and added peanuts around 250 degrees. After that I added about a tablespoon of molasses and 1 tsp vanilla just for fun. It turned out to be delicious! I plan to hand this out as Christmas gifts this year along with some other candy I'm making. ?

I doubled the recipe, used raw nuts, and a full teaspoon of salt to compensate for the unsalted nuts. I split the batch between two pans lined with silicone mats. Next time I will increase to 2 and a half cups of peanuts as there were some pieces that didn't have any nuts that I threw away. One note of caution... the thermometer increases slowly, then those last few degrees creep up very fast. Really watch it because over 300 degrees will be burnt.

I had a hanging for some brittle and decided to try this recipe.  Having a candy thermometer is a must.  I used to keep a glass of ice water to test the stage of the candy while cooking but it was a royal pain.  
I added vanilla extract with the butter and baking soda for a little added flavour.  Excellent recipe and a keeper!

This was really easy.  Haven't made candy in a while, but I was able to follow this.  Mine is a little lighter, I'm hoping because I used lite corn syrup.

Super easy people love it! I read a lot of reviews of people saying it didn't harden. It is a softer peanut brittle and it should still have a snap when you break it.

I like this recipe a lot better than my first brittle attempt.  To the people who added 2 cups of nuts: you got talent.  I wanted more than a cup because I love peanuts, but it’s harder to stir at 1.5 cups, so I will quit there.  It turned out great - just the right mix of peanuts and candy.  I couldn’t find raw peanuts, so I took the advice of another reviewer and added the peanuts towards the end (at about 140 Celsius) - that dropped the temperature, so keep an eye on that.

Search no further — this Recipe is perfect. I used raw Spanish peanuts 1.5 cups tossed in once the sugar dissolved. Could probably have stirred in the butter at an earlier stage (?).  I poured the candy out onto plain, ungreased parchment.

Protect your eyes when breaking the brittle. Shards may come off when breaking and get in your eyes. Thanks to my quick reaction to close my eyes it landed on my eyelash when I closed my eyes.

I made this peanut brittle tonight and it didn't get hard enough because I cooked it for less time because my microwave is 11oo watts.   Then I cooked it another 2 minutes in the microwave and it still didn't get hard so ........ since it was on a metal cookie sheet, I just put it in the oven (not microwave) at 250 degrees and cooked it some more until it looked a bit brown.  When it cooled I was able to snap it into pieces and it really tastes good.  I thought I might have to throw it out so if you have the same problem, try this.

Great recipe! Tasted amazing and was super simple to make! Just be careful about the temperature when on the stove, it can burn very quickly... maybe speaking from experience. I found that once you put the butter in it is less likely to burn up on you.

Easy recipe!  The only problem I had was that I used my largest cast iron skillet thinking it would foam up alot.  This is a small batch so the skillet was just too big and hard to get the tempature.  Next time I will make a double batch or use a smaller pan.  I am thinking of also making a batch using pecans instead of peanuts.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Great! Also I added a few dashes of vinegar hot sauce which reacted with the baking soda. It made it a little lighter and bubblier.

First time making peanut brittle.  Followed the quantities per recipe.  However, next time, I will add 1.5 cps of nuts, and reduce the butter to half the requested amount.  Overall great recipe!

Came out perfect my 2nd time. First time I had bought wrong thermometer (didn’t go to 300degrees) and the store didn’t have a “candy thermometer”, so it came out too soft like a payday candy bar but definitely gone in one night between my husband and myself! 2nd time I bought a cheap candy thermometer at Walmart and it worked perfectly!

I had to make this twice to perfect it, but in the end it was great! I just added a little cinnamon for taste. To the people whos brittle isn't hardening, make sure that when you drop it in cold water it is hard and snapable.

Great recipe! I added a total of 1 1/4 cup peanuts and it was perfect. The peanuts burned a bit. Next time I'll put them in the oven with the metal pan I pour the sugar into when it's done.

I've not made peanut brittle since I was a kid. This recipe was wonderful and super easy!
 I doubled the recipe to share plus followed the tip to butter the foil for easy removal, I'm so glad I did.

Whatever you do don't spread this with utensils, move the pan around to even out otherwise you end up with an ugly brittle.  (I started to use a fork to spread, and quickly stopped as it left ugly streaks.  I then just swirled the pan around to let it settle on its own)
This has a faint buttery taste which made this just perfect. 
Thanks for the wonderful recipe, it's a keeper!

really easy and turned out perfect, only change i did was i didnt bother adding peanuts (never have been much a fan of them) but i love the candy itself. to those that never had it harden - you have to get it to the hard crack stage, if you don't get the temp fairly exact, it will turn out wrong. basically if the consistency is off, it was your fault, not the recipes.

I omitted the salt since i used salted, roasted spanish peanuts.  I also didn't add the peanuts until the very end - after it reached 305 degrees.  I added the butter, baking soda and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla in all together and stirred for about 45 seconds before pouring onto the buttered cookie sheet.  I poured it in a circular motion, so the peanuts and liquid would mesh more easily rather than try to push them around much.  I did use the forks, but it was easy.  I doubled the recipe and added an additional 1/2 cup of peanuts.  I did find that the brittle was difficult to break - ended up sliding a metal spatula under one corner and lifted up - only in one place did it stick to the cookie sheet. Next time, I'll line the cookie sheet with foil and then butter that.  Clean-up was easier using boiling water.  I did this on a gas stove and used a flame tamer until the syrup reached 230 degrees - then it just stopped progressing, so I removed the flame tamer and it went much faster. All in all, it cooked for about 30 mins. rather than 15.  I'll definitely do this again.

This is soooo good. It's easy to make, but be patient when waiting for the temp to come up to 300°. The only thing I changed was the "nuts" I used. This time I roasted some pumpkin seeds and used them instead of nuts. I poured it out on a sheet pan with a Silpat mat, no mess, no sticking. I spread it with buttered offset spatula. Wonderful recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.

Used brown sugar instead of white, eliminated the baking soda and add a smidge of vanilla. I made it twice, once with a candy thermometer and once without. I definitely recommend a candy thermometer.

I've made this recipe 3 times, twice adding 2 table spoons of a Thai Dipping sauce along with the first ingredients giving  it a sweet and spicy twist. The last time just added a teaspoon of vanilla. Each time it came out great with a nice snappy break and an easy crunchy texture.... love, love, love this recipe...  Thank You!

I think you need to make sure you watch the temperature -- 300 degrees means 300 degrees.

And the one who posted this recipe is absolutely correct -- you can't be mucking around measuring butter or baking soda when it gets close to 300.  Those need to go in INSTANTLY and then you pour.

But it tastes SOOO good!  I can't believe I actually made this stuff myself!  Woo!!

Made this and included it with all my Christmas Baking giveaways.  Everyone that got some messaged me after to ask for the recipe and said it was the best Peanut Brittle they'd ever had!  It is pretty deadly.  I took the advice from the comments and had everything ready to work quickly.  I also continually stirred the mixture the entire time.  I don't know how you could make this correctly without a candy thermometer.  Definitely a must!

This was PERFECT! I used 1-1/4 C blanched, salted peanuts, kept my greased pan in a warm oven until it was "go time" and everything came out beautifully! Having never made peanut brittle of any kind before, I was unsure of what kind of peanuts to use but took an unofficial survey of friends and the overwhelming response was blanched. I made this 3 times in two days, it was THAT good. Thank you!

We used caramel salted peanuts and it was fantastic.  It was a little lighter than I had expected, but the flavor was just like what I have purchased at candy stores.

I added 1/2 t chipotle chili powder with the salt for a kick. Delicious! Will add even more next time. My peanuts were salted and roasted spanish peanuts and it wasn't too salty.

I used pecans and used more than the recipe called for so that the candy was very nutty.
I put the candy out of the cooking pot onto a silicone baking mat on my counter to cool. Sprinkled small amount of sea salt on top.
Did NOT spread with fork-- allowed the candy to remain frothy and puffy, drying crisp and light and airy.
Next time I am going to roast the pecans separately while the candy is cooking; then spread the roasted nuts onto the silicone mat, sprinkle them with the sea salt, then pour the frothy candy on top of the nuts.

Delish! Make sure you cook it long enough, as the first time I made it, it wasn't quite brittle enough, and it was more the consistency of popcorn ball. Still tasty, though, so I was prepared when I made the second batch. I live at 300m altitude, and I found the candy temp is lower than specified here, though.  I love this recipe, and use it with deluxe mixed nuts, or sometimes just plain Brazils (which I love!). Yum!!

Very easy and tastes great. I'm going to add some toasted coconut to my next batch.  I do recommend you use a candy thermometer versus water when checking for doneness.

This is a easy recipe and it always turns out perfect. I use a candy thermometer and always go to 300 degrees, and I like raw red skin peanuts for best results. I pour mine out on greased cookie sheets and spread then pull. My family and friends love these as gifts.

I followed the recipe, using the candy thermometer but it didn't harden... reheated twice to try to save it...heated in oven to 325 for 30 minutes stirring but still no luck... it's gooey! Well I can't serve it to anyone so I have to eat it as is for a snack!

My mother used to make homemade peanut brittle all the time because we grew spanish peanuts in our huge garden and my Daddy loved fresh roasted peanuts or anything made with peanuts. This recipe turned out just like my Mother used to make and my Daddy raved about.  I did put a cup and a half of peanuts total instead of the cup listed, other than that no changes.. Delicious..

This recipe was outstanding!  I used the roasted Spanish peanuts.  I followed others advice with sugar; half white and half brown sugar.  I added the peanuts at 250 degrees and followed the directions at adding baking soda and butter at 300 degrees.  I also added vanilla to it.  I placed a Silpad (silicon sheet) on the bottom of a cookie sheet.  I didn't have to do any spraying or tilting of pan.  It worked perfectly!  This is the best recipe ever.  I would use roasted Spanish peanuts over raw ones.  You just have to make sure to stir frequently when adding.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is the one & only brittle recipe I have made.
It's the best I have ever had & so simple.  By far the best homemade brittle I have ever ate.
It's so good that I won't give out the recipe to
anyone, I tell them it's a secret recipe.

Great recipe. My first go was as it is written. My second go, I left it simmer at 300 degrees for a couple minutes then I added a Tablespoon - rather than a teaspoon - of baking soda. Super light and airy and dissolves on the tongue nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

Comes together quickly and easily, stirring the nuts in from almost the beginning really imparts that peanut flavour.  My second time making it, I added half a tsp of cinnamon, and a scant half a tsp of cayenne during the butter/baking soda phase for a spicy brittle.  I pour it onto a silpat lined baking sheet and it works beautifully.

I followed instructions, and it  turned out perfect. I used almonds, pecans, cashews, pistachios, chia, sesame seed, flax seed, coconut, dried cranberries, pepitas, sunflowers, and toasted rolled oats, and I added Allspice along with hazelnut extract instead of the vanilla extract.  Delicious!

Do not follow the recipe. I should have known better myself, but when you put the butter in at 300 degrees the mixture thickens so quickly that not even the Flash could whip it fast enough to combine the butter. I was left with peanut brittle, floating in a pool of butter. I will try this again some time but I will be sure to add the butter with the initial first four ingredients, allowing it an ample duration to combine.

I followed the instructions pretty close but  changed the peanut quantity to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and it came out great.  I will change the way I add the butter next time even though it came out good I think that should have been added after the mixture was boiling and just prior to adding the peanuts.  I think there should be only one final step and that should be to remove from heat at the appropriate time and add the baking soda and stir very well before pouring onto the baking sheet.

Way too easy to make... I didn't use a candy therm. however, I used a laser therm.  Got it up to 290 F.  felt like it was going to burn if I left it to 300 so I called it done at that time.  I just hope it taste good....  It doesn't look like the picture on the recipe, as mine looks a little cloudy.... any suggestions?

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy.  Never made candy in my life and the family agrees, "I really shouldn't have done it now."  Yet another thing we all need to stay away from lest I gain back the 130 lbs I just lost.  I waited on the nuts until 250 degrees, added some vanilla like others suggested but other than that basically followed the directions.  Will try different combinations of nuts next time.  As for now...I'm taking it in to work tomorrow hoping coworkers will devour it before I do.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and everyone loved it. I did put the cookie sheet into the oven at 225degree f until ready to pour mixture. I also tilted the cookie sheet back and forth after I poured the mixture to spread it.  I also really suggest you pre measure the butter, and baking soda.

Good, easy recipe. I wish I would have cooked the mixture a bit longer. My attempt was a little lighting color.  I was nervous about over cooking.

This recipe is easy to follow and outstanding when finished!  I could honestly sell what I made it is THAT good.  I read all of the reviews and made the following adjustments:  1)  blended the softened butter and baking soda together for consistent bubbles  2)  added vanilla during the butter/soda stage  3) warmed my greased baking sheet and then spread the mixture on the warmed pan.   For those other novice candy makers - it took about 15 minutes from when I added the peanuts to when I took it off of the heat.  (I sat there with the thermometer - but next time would wait about 10 minutes before I checked.)  This recipe is PERFECTION!

It needs more peanuts. Also, if you don't have a thermometer  boil the mixture until it becomes foamy and slightly brownish. The idea is to boil off all the  water, as the water will boil off first. Once the water is gone, the rest of the mixture will rise in temperature and you can achieve 300 deg F. I reduced the sugar a bit  and the next time I will reduce it even more. I would suggest another half cup of peanuts, as that is what I will try next time.

Excellent recipe. The only ingredient I added was 1/2 tsp. Epicure Cinco Pepper blend to give it a bit of a kick.  I invested in a high quality candy thermometer, and I'm glad I did.

My grandma would make my dad peanut brittle for Christmas every year. This year I decided to make him some in her memory. This was my first time making peanut brittle and it turned out beautifully. I used dry roasted peanuts (lightly salted) and added them in at 250*. I also had a warm, buttered pan on standby. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract with the butter and baking soda. This recipe was very easy to follow and the resulting treat turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again!

Added the vanilla. Used buttered tin foil on the cookie sheet, worked like a charm. Boiling water ready to clean utensils is a must!! Double the recipe, one does not make much at all!!

The is my first time writing a review but the recipe but so good that I have to leave a review. The recipe was fantastic. I started to make it and I told my mom the ingredients. She had me add 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 and 1/2 cup more of peanuts. The brittle melted in my mouth when I tried it. 10/10 would make again

Made exactly to recipe. Peanuts are fresh unsalted roasted peanuts that I had to shell. Corn syrup was a fresh bottle which is always the trick in making peanut brittle. You have to use fresh ingredients. I used candy thermometer. When it reaches the 300 degrees, I took off burner, added my butter which was at room temperature, mixed it up good. I then added the baking soda separately. Turned out perfect.. Just my tip is everything is new and fresh ingredients.

Very easy to make. First time I made it I used raw peanut, but I should have put them in at the beginning because they needed more cooking time. Next time I made this I used dry roasted salted peanuts, did not add the salt, and added them in at 250 degrees.  Perfect.  Loved it

Next time I think I will use a larger pan to dump it into.  I like the thinner brittle, when I made it this time it was in a smaller pan, just a little to thick.  All tastes the same.

My boyfriend LOVES peanut brittle, so I scoured the internet for the perfect recipe, and this is it!  The only thing I added was some vanilla extract for both color and flavor. I will try half white and half brown sugar next time just to see if it makes a difference.

Thank you for the perfect recipe!  I think it's ring shopping time : )

Made two (double) batches of this today. I must say, it was pretty easy. I did not have candy thermometer so I made sure to   boil and stir until the color turned amber and I could smell the peanuts cooking.  I did keep the cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven until I was ready to put the hot peanut brittle on it so it would spread out easier.

I am a novice when it comes to candy making, but I found this recipe easy to follow, and the end result is buttery and delicious, with just about the right amount of peanuts for me.

I stirred the mixture constantly until the sugar was fully dissolved, then gave it a good stirring about every 5 degrees after that (so I stirred it at 250 degrees, then 255 degrees, etc.). I added the peanuts when the mixture reached 250 degrees F, as recommended in another recipe.

I gave the recipe four stars because it isn't terribly clear at what point to add the peanuts: once the mixture has reached a boil, or once the sugar is dissolved.

It's been my (admittedly limited) experience that issues with texture usually have something to do with an unreliable thermometer - candy that is over- or undercooked by even a smidge will turn out poorly.

I was pleasantly surprised how easy this recipe was. This was my first time with brittle and have received rave reviews. The only tip I would give someone who hasn't dabbled in candy making is to heat slow-and be patient. After reading other reviews, I will add a few more peanuts, maybe addl 1/4 cup. This was such a hit that I need a double batch for my Christmas baking.

Came out great. I made five batches last Christmas, and it was a big hit with everyone. Cashews substitute well if you're concerned about a peanut allergy, and I also made a spicy batch that good. Start with a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and add to your taste.

Never made candy before but this turned out great. Took about 10-15 minutes to get to 285 deg. I used a candy thermometer which had a "soft crunch" mark at 280, and a hard crunch mark at 300. I also used roasted peanuts with light salt, and stirred almost constantly. Everyone raved. Will make this again.

Make sure you have a good candy thermometer and if you're using pre-roasted nuts, don't add them until close to the end of the cooking cycle or they may get burnt-tasting. Even with raw nuts, I don't add until temp is around 250.

I made this for a fundraiser we had. At the last minute I added crispy bacon. Then when it cooled and I broke it, I dipped one end in chocolate and then added a tad of sea salt!! I put in it a cute jar and it sold for $15!! I am making it again today minus the bacon and doing almonds instead of peanuts!!

Thank you previous reviewers!  Because of your suggestions, my second batch of brittle tasted way better than my first!

The first time, I followed the directions as were.  Had a funny burnt peanut taste and I really overdid the greasing on the cookie sheet.  I was so nervous about it sticking!

Second time...light Crisco on a warmed cookie sheet.  200 degrees in the oven.  Waited to add the peanuts (a bout 1 1/2 cups) until right before the baking soda.  Added 1 tsp vanilla.  Brilliant!  Delicious!  Yummy!  But really didn't need the extra peanuts.

Had hot hot hot water ready to soak used items.  Also had all ingredients pre measured for a quick mixing.

All in all, it is an easy recipe and I don't have a candy thermometer.  Found tips online to help with that.  Again, easy to follow.

Looks like I have a new treat to give out at the holidays!

Love, love, love this! I have been making this for the past 2 years like the previous reviewer. It's definitely a timing thing. I can't imagine making it without a candy thermometer. I add 1 tsp. of vanilla right from the start.  I use 3/4 cup of peanuts when the temperature reaches 250 degrees exactly!  I also make sure that it absolutely, positively hits the 300 degree mark before taking it off the heat to add the butter and baking soda. When I pour the mixture onto the buttered cookie sheet I just use the back of my wooden spoon to spread it out. This was a Christmas Holiday treat last year and now my kinfolk are begging for more this year!  Thanks Amanda for a great recipe and a new Holiday tradition!

I followed directions but for some reason the butter didn't mix well with the sugar mixture, it seperated once I poured it out on the sheet.
They were greasy at the touch and very hard. But tasted allright. I wont be making these again.

I made a Thai Peanut Brittle using this recipe. Instead of water I used coconut milk, which needs to be stirred a lot at first, it seems to want to boil over in the beginning. I didn't add the salt. I added roasted/salted peanuts when the temperature hit 300-350 degrees. I took the pot off the burner and added the butter, baking soda, a big pinch of fresh, diced lemongrass and kafir leaves, and a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce. A really good, spicy Thai brittle!

I've been making hard candy for years now and decided to give this a go. This recipe tastes amazing. I added 1 tsp vanilla and otherwise would only change the amount of baking soda to 3/4 or 1/2 tsp the next time I make it because it sticks to your teeth really badly and perhaps wouldn't be so chewy were there less baking soda.

This is a wonderful recipe! As someone who has never made peanut brittle before, I found this recipe to be quite simple. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used sea salt instead of kosher salt (I was out of kosher salt) and walnuts instead of peanuts (I was out of peanuts too!). I also only used 1 1/2 cups of walnuts instead of two. The brittle turned out to be very delicious, much better than store-bought brittle. I will definitely use this recipe again.

really easy to make.  I used salted nuts instead of peanuts so I omitted the salt.  I also did not add the nuts until the very end.  Adding them in when the recipes states caused the brittle to have a burnt taste the first time I made this recipe.  Great overall recipe and will be saving this in my special occasion file.

Very, very good! Made a mistake and let it burn a tiny bit at the end. It wasn't burnt enough to deter anyone from eating it. This was my first time making peanut brittle and even tho' I was a bit apprehensive about it, I feel it came out pretty good, will definitely make this again.

For the people who complain that the brittle does not harden, it's most likely because you are not cooking the brittle until a full 300 degrees F.  That is critical, otherwise you get gummy, teeth sticking taffy.  I have made this recipe for years and it always comes out terrific (except for the time my candy thermometer malfunctioned and I ended up with taffy).  Also, I leave out the water, it's really not a required addition.

I have been using this recipe for years. It is easy to do and everyone asks me to make it year after year! I put the candy on a wax sheet on a cookie sheet to easily lift it from the pan and break it to pieces after it hardens.

Great recipe, first time ever making peanut brittle, and turned out perfect. I used blanched peanuts, so less of a chance to scorch. Added at about 240 degrees. I heated the baking sheet to 275 degrees so brittle wouldn't set up too quickly while being spread out.

I made 2 batches of this. Super simple since I never made peanut brittle before. This is a great recipe for the novice candy maker. I like more nuts, so I added aprox 2 cups of peanuts instead of just 1. I will be doing this recipes with other nuts too. Pistachios and cashews.

OK. But I use pure Mexican vanilla. I do not use a thermometer. My mom kept braking them. So I learned through smell, and the ice water method. Cast iron skillet I think works the best. Distributes the heat very well. no need to edit.

Fantastic recipe! I also use cashews instead of peanuts sometimes. The only thing different I do in this recipe is I add the nuts in when the candy thermometer reaches 300 degrees, then wait until the thermometer reaches 310 before taking it off the stove and adding the butter and baking soda.

This is great!  Made per recipe except for adding extra peanuts (about an extra half cup), and a teaspoon of vanilla.  We prefer our brittle with bubbles, so I just poured and let cool; did not lift and pull.

This is amazing brittle. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. To me, the molasses in the brown sugar was a little stong,so next time I will use all white sugar. Will keep this recipe forever. Thanks for sharing.

On Christmas Eve I thought I'd make peanut brittle for the family gathering tomorrow. All was going well but my therometer wouldn't go over 240 degrees so I turned up the heat and within no time my mixture started to turn very brown so I poured it onto my baking sheet.
It was more of a caramel cream instead of brittle.
Am I supposed to keep the sugar bubbling the whole time?
I left the 'brittle' at home.
Happy Holidays,
The Brittle Disaster

The first time I made this it was a disaster - it actually tasted burnt but I just made it again today (nothing beats me!) and this time followed the other suggestions and voila!  Delicious!  Can't wait to have my mom taste it - she's the ultimate test!

Loved this recipe and I actually made a few variations to it that I enjoyed... for "spicy" peanut brittle, as 1/4 cup diced Serrano peppers to the batch and you will have a deliciously surprising treat!  I also made a double batch with 1/2 cup peanuts and substituted for the peanuts, 2 cups shaved natural unsweetened coconut and added 1/8 cup of Indian (from India- bought at Costco) dried crushed red peppers..... spicy peaco brittle :)

Very easy to make.  Had made without a candy thermometer before, but with one makes it easier and takes out the guesswork.  Added 1tsp vanilla at end as suggested by others.

Delicious.  However, like other reviewers have noted:  Unless you WANT to stir constantly, add the peanuts toward the end of the boil.  I was making dinner at the same time and ended up with a few scorched peanuts.  I need to learn to trust my instincts when it comes to strange recipes...

I am new to making this.  I learned it was very easy.  You HAVE to have a thermometer!!  I used Planters Dry Roasted nuts from Sam's Club.  I did the recipe exactly.  I did take advice from other post and had a pot of boiling water going for the used pot and utensils. And have everything measured and waiting because it will need to go quick.  What I used to spread my brittle on, was a new cookies sheet that doesn't need any greasing.  Don't be afraid to spread it around, I was the first time and it was to thick.  It will spring back and look nice.  Once the brittle was hard, I just gently twisted the pan and the brittle popped off.  And the back wasn't greasy.  I will use this every year during the holidays.  Thanks to whomever put it on here. --- Karen

This holiday, tried 5 other recipes.  Even used Alton Brown (Food Network) recipe.  Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon...........whoa.  This is the BEST recipe as a base.  Might try 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper with the cinnamon for just a little kick.  If you are looking for a fool proof, quick, easy peanut brittle recipe........this is it.

My first venture with peanut brittle and this is an easy recipe with great flavor. I like my peanut brittle to have those little pockets of air in it and so it's important to not over stir the brittle or "pull the mixture into a rectangle about 14x12" as this recipe suggest.  Instead I just pour it into a greased 9x13 pan. If you don't like the air pockets or like a flatter texture brittle, follow the recipe instructions.  I will make again.

I've made this recipe for Christmas gifts every year for the last three years, and it is absolutely fantastic!  I use a good quality digital candy thermometer and it turns out perfect every time.  I have never made it with peanuts, but instead use toasted pecans.  I follow other reviewers' advice and I don't add the nuts until the candy reaches 250°F so that the nuts don't burn before the candy is finished cooking.  The list of people who request I make this for them grows every year.

This is very easy and simple. Turns out perfect every time, even when I make a double batch! Making this for my step son's wedding because his fiancee loves peanut brittle and was blown away by it's flavor and the fact that I made it for her from scratch. Like everyone else, I stress the importance of having the peanuts, butter and soda ready. For those who say the peanuts taste burned, the only reason I can think is too much heat and inadequate stirring. For those who asked also, temperature IS extremely important. If it doesn't reach the 300 degree mark, it won't crack and break. Also try not to overhandle as the brittle has a more airy taste that way. Its a great recipe and around here if you want it you'll have to move fast, it doesn't stay around too long!

Great, easy recipe.  The only things I did differently was using 1 1/3 cups peanuts and followed the advice of another reviewer and kept my cookie sheet warm in the oven and used a greased spatula to help spread it on the pan instead of using 2 forks.  peanuts.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe turned out great --  I used 3 different kinds of nuts to add variety -  Be careful to cook it SLOWLY and always keep stiring  or it will burn!

This is the first time I have ever made peanut brittle, it was so easy to make and is so yummy, that its also so easy to eat!  I did a 1/2 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, 3/4 cup peanuts and 1/2 cup pecans (I like it a little chunkier).  I used salted roasted peanuts so I did not add the extra salt and I added the pecans right after the mixture began to boil and I added the peanuts when the temp was just above 250 so they would not burn.  I took the advice of another review and put my pan in the oven on warm while I was making this so it would spread a little easier.  Also after I let it cool for a few minutes I topped it off with just a little chocolate sauce and caramel sauce (makes it a little sweeter so do not add to much unless you decided to add the salt that 
I omitted).  Then I set it in the freezer to harden the chocolate and caramel.  It came out so good that I already have people asking me to make it for them for Christmas!

Great flavor! I've never made any kind of brittle, but I made this three times yesterday - one with peanuts, one with cashews, and one with almonds. It worked perfectly for all of them, and easy too!  The key is to stir constantly once you add the nuts, I found it helpful to clip the candy thermometer to the inside of each pot.  I can't wait to make this again and drizzle some melted chocolate chips over the almond brittle!

This was so quick and easy to make. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and substituted almonds for the peanuts. Delicious! The hardest part was waiting for it to cool enough to eat!

This was quite nice. This is the third peanut brittle recipe I've tried, and I'm still a bit nervous about this stuff. I made it almost exactly as written, using unsalted peanuts, and a little more corn syrup since I was polishing off a bottle. I did use a candy thermometer and I was a little worried about the mixture burning, so I stopped at maybe 290 degrees or so. The results were quite tasty, but I did learn a little lesson. I didn't spread the brittle out as much as the stated 14x12 inches, and I did notice that thick brittle is not nearly as good as what I'm used to. So I may make this again soon - I enjoyed the results anyway.

Yummy!  I used whole natural almonds (with skin on), toasted slightly in the oven ahead of time for better flavour and chopped in half so they wouldn't be unwieldy.  I also used coconut oil instead of butter so it would be pareve (kosher, non-dairy) and the oil didn't blend so well with the sugar mixture, but I've had the same problem with butter in the past, so I'll have to work on that.  I have used this baking soda technique to make sponge toffee, so the basic method was familiar already.  You definitely have to spread it quickly - in future, I may spread the nuts evenly on the pan and then pour the mixture over them.  Easy and delicious last-minute treat!

This is also my mom's best peanut brittle, she made it several times a year.  Some stores carry more raw peanuts at Christmas and reduce the price after the holidays. They can be stored in the freezer for a year. Recently my mother died and for her memorial luncheon we are making her peanut brittle and other goodies along with printed copies of the recipes.

Easy to make and tastes delicious.  As suggested by other reviews, I added 1 tsp vanilla and I warmed my cookie sheet in the oven to help it spread better.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  I've made several batches to give away as gifts.  It's a keeper!

I added vanilla like a lot of you, and I added about a tablespoon of molasses for color.  It looks too dark when before you add the baking soda, then it's perfect.  Mine never really got to 300, and I was very patient, but it's nice and brittle and tasty.  With my second batch, I used a much bigger pan and it went much faster.

It is excellent. I followed the recipe exactly except I added another half cup of peanuts. I made it again and replaced the peanuts with 1 1/2 cups of roasted sunflower seeds. It also came out very good. My husband liked it better than the peanuts.

I hate to admit it but this did not work for me. It came out very soft and the color was off.It had a creamy appearance instead of the traditional brown look. I doubt if I will try this one again, it just did not work for me.

i think i did something wrong, i didn't notice that i was supposed to add peanuts before bringing the mixture to a boil, so although the temperature was right, the candy turned out softer than it should have and all stuck together in the glass container i put it in to store it.  i'll try again and hopefully next time it will come out the right way...

Now I know why you should test your candy thermometer.  Mine is brand new so I didn't bother and the peanuts came out black and the candy surrounding the peanuts looked like teak wood.  I then tested the thermometer.  It should read 212 degrees in boiling water and my new thermometer read 180 degrees.  I can tell the recipe is great and if I would have stopped when it looked right I would be eating some right now.  I gave 5 stars because I could tell how good it would be.  I definitely will use this recipe again when I get (and pre-test) a new thermometer.

This is a really simple recipe. Seriously, if you have everything out and ready for the next step, there should be no problems. Just don't walk away while your thermometer is reading 250, or you'll only have yourself to blame. 1c of peanuts is plenty, so I agree; if you're adding 2c you must like nuts much more than caramel. Very tasty, cools fast, and all the family members are getting pieces of this brittle for Christmas this year.

I was given a reciepe from a friend and I tried it but it came out way to gooy and chewy. So I got online to look for P.B. reciepes and Ill tell ya, this takes hardly anytime and it comes out perfect each time. make sure to not over cook the sugar and corn syrup and Instead of adding the vanilla after taking it off the heat I put in for the last few minutes while I cooked the syrup part. Love this reciepe and am proud I did it! Its got the perfect crunch versus that chewyness which I dont like.

This was my first time making any kind of candy so I followed the recipe exactly.  The taste is excellent but the candy didn't really get as hard as expected.  I live in Hawaii so I'm not sure if the humidity is the culprit.  I did cook until the temp. was 300...maybe the thermometer is off.  Will try again.

This was really easy to make and I am a first time brittle maker. :)  I used almonds instead of peanuts and love it!  I also added a bit of vanilla extract at the end and it gave it a nice hint of vanilla flavor.

Absolutely amazing!!! Very simple to make also, this was the first candy I have ever made and I had no problems at all with it!! Keeping the pan warm in the oven is a GREAT tip. :)

Oh Boy! This was easy and yummy! My only changes were to add 1tsp of homemade vanilla extract and use 1.5cups of salted mixed nuts (omitting the salt/peanuts called for in the recipe, of course). Will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

Positively the best peanut brittle I've tried!  I put the brittle in a ziploc bag and it was better the next day - still plenty brittle but not quite as brutal on the teeth!

Made this for my family who loves peanut brittle, & they said it was some of the best they've ever had. The 1 cup of peanuts was plenty and I think if I was to add anymore, the peanut flavoring might be a little too over powering for my tastes. But this is a definite do-over!

Terrific - I followed a couple suggestions I read in the other reviews.  I lined a large cookie sheet (13x18) with aluminum foil after I put the sugar into the pan to dissolve, and put it the sheet in the oven at 170F for a few minutes; once it got warm I flipped the oven off.  I buttered the aluminum foil.  No mess at all.

This turned out absolutely perfectly the first time. It was easy, buttery, and peanutty. I did change the peanuts to 1 1/2 cups and crushed 1/4 c. of the nuts. Next time I will play with flavors like cinnamon and chili. Excellent recipe - thank you!

I was AMAZED at how this turned out.  This was my first time making candy.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I added a teaspoon of vanilla) and used a candy themometer.  It was incredibly easy.  If you can work relatively quick, there's no need to heat the cookie sheet.  I threw mine into the freezer for a couple minutes to cool it.  It turned out PERFECT!  Thank you Amanda, this is a great recipe and it's going directly into my recipe box!  BTW, have a sink full of hot soapy water, this stuff is like super glue!!!

Looking forward to trying this recipe, sounds delicious.  One thing to suggest that my Aunt used to do is change up the peanuts with different nuts like cashews, pecans or almonds

I really like this recipe although I doubled the peanuts and only cooked to 280° it turned out perfectly. I have a propane stove and it is very difficult to make candy on because it gets so much hotter than a traditional gas stove. The next time I make this I'm going to try adding additional baking soda to see if I can make it lighter. I doubled the recipe and it turned out perfectly too!

I goofed and used 1/2 cup of water for the first batch I made. Like others, I added 1 tsp vanilla to the butter, and also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. I spread it out using the spiral technique from other reviewers.  The brittle turned out really well!  Tasters here in our kitchen thought it was not too sweet and really good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I am by no means a candy-making expert, but it turned out great.  I followed the recipe as is, except I used roasted, unsalted peanuts and added them in around 250-260 F.  I also used the tip mentioned by previous reviews to poor onto parchment paper on a heated cookie sheet (about 350 F) and tilt it around to spread it.  This worked great!  After a few minutes of cooling, I snapped it into pieces.  I got numerous compliments on this; people telling me it was as good as store bought and requesting that I make it again!

I'm giving 5 stars for the taste but I found that the directions were not quite clear.  I never accomplished what the recipe told me to look for and I'm pretty sure I over cooked it but the taste and texture was perfect!

Easy to follow and beautiful results!  This was my first ever brittle attempt and I had zero trouble following the directions and everything turned out exactly right.  I did add a handful or so more peanuts and will be trying this with other nuts in the near future.

This is great peanut brittle and easy to make. I use salted peanuts and omit the salt in recipe. I add peanuts in at 250 degrees. I also add in 1 tsp. vanilla extract. I have made it with 1/2 brown sugar/ 1/2 white sugar and all white sugar it is great both ways.

Excellent! This was my first time making brittle. I did not have a candy thermometer but it turned out PERFECT! You can tell by the smell (it gets a rich, syrupy smell) when it is done. I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar to give it a nice look and it tastes great, too. Also, I added dry roasted peanuts right at the end. My family loves it and I will definitely be using this recipe again!!

I followed this recipe exact except for adding vanilla like some people did. It was just ok. I have tasted much better. Plus it was too soft. I followe directions and brought it to 300 but still too soft. Too many peanuts and not enough butter. Also next time I won't add vanilla. It is good if you want more of a toffee flavor. My search for a yummy recipe goes on.

Fabulous recipe! Like others, I added a dash of vanilla. I also noticed that if you wait to add the peanuts later in the cooking process, the brittle comes out much lighter in color. I like the caramel color, so I make sure to go ahead and add the nuts in the beginning. Just keep stirring frequently so they don't scorch on the bottom of the pot! I also found that using a Claphalon cookie sheet works great for no-stick, easy breaking and clean up!

I have tried this recipe 3 times.  Not sure if my candy thermometer is off, but I even let it get to the point where I though the sugar was going to burn, and it is still a soft crack.  The thermometer isn't touching the bottom of the pan, and it seems very thick, but I'm disappointed either way.  Followed this to the letter, but yet, still a soft crack...

I have never made peanut brittle before....I did it without a candy thermometer and it turned out pretty good.  It was a little underdone so it came out just a touch chewy.  I will use this recipe again but with a candy thermometer!  I used cashews.  YUM!!!

Very good. I made this today with no clue as to what I was doing and without a candy thermometer and was surprised at how easy it was. I used mixed nuts in place of just peanuts because that it what I had. Will defiantly make again.

My fist batch was terrible but I've never made brittle before so I kind of expected it. By the second batch I had the hang of it, the only change I made was using 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It gave it a nice color and it tasted delicious.

Easy and sooo good!  After the temperature reaches 250, watch it closely.  After that point it climbs to 300 faster than you'd think!   And using a candy thermometer is so much easier than trying to get there with a glass of ice water.

This recipe was great!  Perfect for holiday gift-giving.  Make sure you keep an eye on it though.  It seems to go from 280 degrees to 300 very quickly.  My first batch got to almost 320 degrees before I could remove the candy thermometer and get the saucepan off of the heat.  It was very brown and not very good.  But batches 2-4 were perfect!  I used a little less than a cup of peanuts and warmed my pan in the oven while I was cooking the brittle, as another reviewer suggested.  I will be making this every holiday season!

So tasty! I made this for my husband and my in-laws tonight and they loved it! It's also very easy to make. I won't buy store bought anymore! Do have your ingredients ready and I used a buttered spatula to spread it in the pan. Came out perfect!

I've made this recipe 3 times and it worked twice.  The third time I added the peanuts after it reached 300 degrees and it cooled it off too quickly.  It ended up a ball of goo and nuts.  If you follow the recipe exactly, it turns out perfect everytime. Be sure to have the butter and soda ready beforehand.  You have to work fast after you take it from the heat. I was always too chicken to try peanut brittle, but with this recipe, it's a cinch!

Perfection!  I followed the recipe, being sure to have everything at hand and ready; it turned out awesome!  I only made one batch to be sure it turned out okay-I'm going back to make another right now-it won't last long, I'm sure!! I did use more peanuts and added a teaspoon of vanilla, but that's the only change I made.

So simple and yet so delicious. I JUST finished making my 5th batch this week. I agree with other reviewers about tilting the pan instead of pulling with two forks. The fork thing could get ugly since the brittle begins to set right away. Makes a great inexpensive christmas gift.

This came out great!  My boyfriend and I made it for his Holiday potluck since he LOVES peanut brittle and always secretly hopes for leftovers.  Not having made peanut brittle before, I was a little nervous when it didn't heat up as quick as I expected, but it soon got up to temp and no burning.  We sampled a few pieces and were so impressed with how delicious, and so easy!  We plan on making this again next week for Christmas.  Thanks!

turned out okay but the bizarre color was a bit of a turn off to many. Not sure why it doesn't resemble typical brittle. could use a bit more salt to balance the sweetness.

I guess I just might not be a peanut brittle type person, made it for my husband and both him and one our neighbours couldn't keep their mitts out of if so it must have been pretty good

I made this recipe for our annual cookie day.  However, since I do not like peanuts, I made it with cashews instead. It was a very delicious and easy recipe.

First batch I didn't cook long enough and it was taffy instead of brittle:)  Kids now think that brittle should be chewey.  Had great flavor.

Made this peanut brittle for my Christmas candy trays, my first batch was really sticky (course it was the first I had ever made) made a second batch which turned out perfect. Recieved many compliments on it.

My first try at 'candy making' and I'm happy to report it was a lot easier than I imagined. 

I popped the pan outside where it was 40 degrees or so for about 10 mins to cool it down so I could speed up the process. Worked like a charm!

Awesome! I made two batches, one substituting 1/2 cup sugar with dark brown sugar, and one true-to-recipe.  Both were delectable.  This'll be a permanent recipe in my collection, THANK YOU!

This recipe didn't turn out well.  Although I think it might have been me who messed up.  I'm not exactly very good with making candy.  But I will definetly try this recipe again in the hopes that I can do it!

Thanks Amanda, for this great recipe.  We had used a microwave recipe for the past 30 years or so and this is much more dependable.  Our first batch was great and would only change the amount of peanuts to at least 1 1/2 cups or more.  We use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as another rater had suggested and it comes out a nice color brown.

This is a funky recipe at the end. Not sure what the baking soda does but it sure was weird! Also the pulling apart with forks thing had me baffled. Instead I just tried to pour it thin and, as a result, I probably ended up with a slightly thicker peanut brittle but it was absolutely delicious!

I made this for my teachers, and they loved it! They keep asking me to make it for them. But you definitely have to work FAST when you pour it on the cookie sheet. The first time I made this, I did the cold water test, and I didnt wait until the strans were brittle, so my brittle came out like taffe...love this recipe though!

Great and a keeper for sure. It is a little timely to make but well worth it. The only change I would make is to double the recipe the next time for by using a 14 x 2 inch pan it turned out a little to thin.
