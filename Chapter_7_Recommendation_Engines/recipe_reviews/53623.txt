After doing the recipe as directed, I found there was not enough volume to it for my needs. So I added eight ounces of soft cream cheese and served it with a sliced baguette. There was still plenty of the smoked oyster flavor and it made a tasty spread. So if you want to increase the recipe don't add more smoked oysters just cream cheese.

This is delicious and extremely easy to prepare. No dirtying a mixer, just mix it up in the bowl you plan to serve it in.  Not the most attractive appearance (brown in color), but I couldn't stop eating it!  You must like the flavor of smoke and oysters, however.  As for the 24 servings, it doesn't make much. There is enough to probably top 24 small crackers, but if each guest eats 4 crackers, that will only serve 6 people. I managed to eat the whole thing all by myself as a snack, so you might want to double it for gathering! Ingredients can easily be kept on hand for surprise guests.  A keeper!!

This was unbelievable!  I love smoked oysters and this was fantastic!  Like others said it has a kind of pate like quality and is wonderful served on sliced french baguette.  I took the advice of others and did not mash the oysters just roughly chopped them and I also added a little of the oil from the can.  You must love smoked oysters for this spread and if you do you will be addicted to this!  I would give it more stars if I could.

This recipe makes a nice quantity if you have a taste for pate but don't want to get stuck with a lot leftover. Next time, I would not mash the oysters up too much since they continue to fall apart after the remaining ingredients are combined. Instead of the smooth consistency, you'd get small chunks of oysters in every bite!

This recipe is surprizingly quite good. As someone else mentioned, it has a pate-type taste. The recipe did not indicate though if the oil that the oysters are packed in should be used in the recipe or not. I dribbled in only a few drops of the oil at first and then only added enough until I got a taste I liked. Too much of the oil cancels out the smokey oyster taste. Also, did not mash up the oysters too fine. I prefered getting substantial bites of the oysters.

THIS TASTE EXOTIC AND IT IS ADDICTIVE.  I USED 6 OUNCES OF CREAM CHEESE AND MASHED THE DRAINED OYSTERS WITH A FORK.  I SERVED THIS ON BAGUETTES SLICES.  THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WILL REALLY LOVE OR NOT.  CRAVING IT AGAIN TODAY.  IT IS SO EASY TO MAKE.  LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT TO BRING OUT THE BEST FLAVOR!!

The oomph that people are lacking is a package of ONION SOUP MIX.  Add a little olive oil to loosen the mixture, mix in the soup mix with the cream cheese and the mussels/oysters.

You also need 2 cans of oysters/mussels per block of cream cheese and soup mix.  Refrigerate for a couple of hours and KABOOM!

This was very good and extremely easy to make.  I've had it twice now and people really enjoyed it.  I would say its a bit thick to "dip", but we just used a knife...yummy.  I look forward to trying it with hot sauce.

Not being a smoked oyster fan, this looked disgusting to me, however, my SO thought this was one of the greatest things he had ever ate.  I did make some minor changes.  I used 8 oz of cream cheese, 2 tsp worchersire sauce, and about 15 drops of hot sauce, as another reviewer has suggested.  I was told this was 5+ stars, and that I could make this at least once a month. He ate the whole thing in two settings, spread on crackers.  Thanks for a great recipe MollyB111!!

Tastes wonderful. Love the smoky taste. The seafood taste of the oysters reminds me of a salmon pate. ty for the wonderful recipe.

If you like smoked oysters, you must give it a try. I used 3 can's of oysters and 1 -8 oz. light pkg. cream cheese and left the other ingredients as listed. They ate it all. If you don't like smoked oysters, pass on it but we love them.  Thanks.

I made this for a last-minute party and my husband actually thought I was making cat food. But, it turned out great, and he had to eat his words. I put in a little extra Worcestershire because it seemed a little flat at first. Just a note – ½ the people at the party loved this (including me) and ½ hated it. It’s really a love-it-or-hate-it dish. But definitely worth making again!

I added a bit more worcestershire, and instead of lemon pepper I put seasoned salt for a more smokey flavor. I also made mine kind of like an oyster bake, putting shredded cheese and crushed crackers on top. Then I set the oven on hi broil and let it cook until the crackers were brown. I thought it was amazing.

To make the dip softer add about 1-2 tablespoon of sour cream, depends on how much cream cheese you use. This will make it soften up. I used 8ozs of cream cheese,1-2 cans of smoked oysters chopped, 1 tablespoon sour cream and little bit of hot sauce.

This definitely needs 8 oz. of cream cheese.  I just cut the oysters in half, don't like smashed.
Also, I used an additional can of oysters.  Very good.

I love smoked oysters so this went over very well. I think I will add some sour cream to it next time as it is quite thick. I am glad I had a sturdy cracker to serve with this.

Yumm..  Made this for a quick lunch.  Added a little mayo as suggested by another review.  Also added a chopped scallion and used Tamari soy sauce rather than worchester (because of allergy)

I also found that using my small food processor made this a snap to make and the texture was just perfect for my purpose.

I love oysters and always keep a can or 2 of smoked ones in my pantry for those relaxing evenings when I can indulge and just eat smoked oysters and hot sauce on a saltine for supper!  But today I was looking for something a little different.  Tried this recipe and was not disappointed.  Added a little hot sauce, but that was all I changed.  Yummy dinner!

I just made it tonight for a party, but I like it.  Some changes: I added 1/2 tsp of salt and juice of one lemon.  Also added 1 crushed cloved of fresh garlic.  It does not look very pretty when mixing so to make it look more appetizing, I cleaned off the sides and sprinkled some ground peppercorn and dry dill.

This is an excellent dip even with just crackers.  I added some of the oil to give it a little more of a smokey flavor, as suggested by other reviewers.

I'm a huge fan of smoked oysters, so this was a hit for me.  Followed the recipe, including lemon pepper, and added about a half teaspoon of sriracha, and I'm hooked.  After the first several bites, I added a small pinch of Sitka Alder Smoked Sea Salt, and a dash of lime juice, and liked it even more.  The citrus tang and extra smokiness along with the lovely oyster flavor are to die for.

LOVE THIS!! It doesn't look pretty and you don't like smoked oysters you won't like it. But it is SO GOOD! I use 8 oz cream cheese, 2 cans of smoked oysters, 1 tsp lemon pepper, 1 tsp worcestershire, and several drops of tabasco. 
YUMMY!

I love this dip, though I would hesitate to make it for company, because the oyster flavor is certainly strong and probably not for everyone. I like mine with a dash of hot sauce.

Super easy! Used 1/2 cream cheese, 1/2 sour cream--it's what I had on hand.  Also, sub'd Ms Dash original for the lemon pepper.  Excellent on water crackers. Yumm!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  Having no Worchestershire sauce, I used a substitution recipe I found online of pepper sauce, soy sauce, lemon and salt.  I had them with sesame melba toast, it's pretty good.

I've always eaten cream cheese and smoked oysters on crackers but never even though about combining them into a spread. Love it!

This is amazing. I used a little bit of Louisiana Hot Sauce and it was delicious. Really killer on sourdough walnut bread.

LOVED this recipe.  I never really thought about how else to serve smoked oysters...I had always served on a dollop of mayo with a saltine.  WOW...this was so amazing.  My husband likes to take a tin of oysters and crackers to work for lunch sometimes but will now bring this.  I have also passed it on to my oyster loving friends already! I served it on tiny melba toasts and topped with a sliver of cucumber and sprinkle of lemon pepper.  I liked the consistency after adding a tiny bit of the oil from the tin.  BE CAREFUL not to add too much or else it will be much too oily.  Served alonside olives, grapes and chopped veggies.  What a hit!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

It's true you have to like smoked oysters to like this recipe. I just couldn't get into it. I took the spread to a patient of mine who I thought might enjoy it, and now he has me making it for him all the time! So, for the smoked oyster lover, it's a winner. Note: he tops his off with a little hot sauce.

I loved it, the flavours blend perfectly. I doubled the recipe and add a few drops of Sriracha, perfection!  There's no need to mash the oysters  as they will break up when blending in the cream cheese. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made it with about 6 oz. cream cheese, excellent!  I put sliced green olives on top, also excellent!  Wife who probably wouldn't eat smoked oysters loved this spread.  We only had pita crackers, worked great!

This is rated as is after sitting overnight in the refrigerator.  I found it a little lacking after that and added finely diced whites of 2 small green onions. Topped with the greens and roughly cracked pepper and returned to fridge a couple hours before serving. Extra star!!  Guests ate a double batch! 
Double onions accordingly.

I made this with regular oysters packed in water. I wish I had smoked oysters. I  added red pepper flakes that gave it a zing. I didn't have the lemon pepper. It was very good and I ate it for lunch on Triscuit's.

Pretty good! I used 8oz of cream cheese and 1 tin of oysters. Did not change much - used lemon pepper, and also added a little bit of minced onion and a sprinkle of cayenne to zip things up. Next time I would leave out the lemon pepper (added a weird aftertaste) and the hot sauce. Instead I would put in more worcestershire sauce to play up on the smokiness of the oysters. I would also chop up some onions (very very fine) or some chives. Oh yeah - I also added a little bit of olive oil, as someone suggested, but I didn't think it made a difference. I LIKE the thickness of this dip!

I, too, use 8 oz of cream cheese and it has plenty of smoked oyster taste.  I love the Worcestershire sauce flavor so I always add a bit more.  I've made this recipe for years and don't know why I didn't review it sooner.  It's something that can be put together at the last minute and served.  It's not the prettiest dip, but it works on flavor!

I add mayo to this to make it more of a dip.  My husband loves it.  Also, add some tabassco, just a few shakes is all it needs.

This was very simple and tasty, but the look was not so appealing.  It was left alone at a recent party when all the other food was gone.  I would make it again, but for a small, intimate group that loves smoked oysters as much as I do.  Thankyou for the recipe.

Delicious recipe!! I love the flavor of the smoked oysters!  The first time I made this I only used 1/2 a package of cream cheese and found that I prefer a more of the oyster flavour so the second time I made it I only used about 1/2 cup cream cheese and 1/2 tsp worcestershire.  It was yummy!! I have also used a cream cheese replacement (Tofutti better than cream cheese) and it was really even better!!
