I used this on wild duck and found it to be fabulous. Thanks for the recipe. We will be posting pictures on our website.

Interesting for sure. I used it for pork and liked it but I didn't love it. It has a unique flavor for sure. I think I would like it better for wild game. I plan on trying this again on either wild duck or venison and will post an update when I do.

Interesting flavor, but not great.
