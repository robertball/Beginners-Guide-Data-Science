The sandwich turned out quite well. I didn't have potato bread or paprika so I used sourdough and a dash of chili powder. The mustard and the avocado go together really well and the green onion adds the perfect crunch. I will make this again in a heartbeat.

I decide to make this and got halfway through only to find out I had run out of potato bread so I toasted some sour dough. This has the texture of an egg salad sandwich but the creaminess and flavor of the avocado makes this a hit. The mustard paired well with the avocado. Makes for really good sandwiches.
