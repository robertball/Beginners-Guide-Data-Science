HELPFUL TIPS: First off, oh my gosh!! I'm not a caramel fan AT ALL, but tried this b/c of the 5* rating.  So glad b/c this is out of this world!  I love the idea of lining your 9X13 pan with foil. This allows you to just pull it out of the glass dish after it's cooked AND COOLED & cuts down on crumbling. Makes slicing easier. ...just don't rush the cooling process in fridge or caramel will harden!  This is a recipe where eyeballing is your best bet.  You MUST double the flour, oats, sugar, baking soda & salt, but TOTALLY not necessary to double the chocolate chips & walnuts (sweet overload). I found 1C of butter to be perfect to make the crust stick together.  In fact, the second & third time I made this, I didn't bother using a small portion of the crust b/c if you put too much on top, it just falls right off (as excess crumbs).  To solve this, when I put the top layer of crumbs on, I press gently into the caramel layer as if I'm making another crust.  Makes everything stick together nicely!  Used an entire bag of Kraft caramels (14 oz) OR already unwrapped bag (11oz) & 7T of heavy cream was the perfect consistency and enough to cover a thin layer.  Caramel takes a little while to melt, so be patient if it's your first time :)  Oh, I've baked this for 25-30 min. depending on oven.  Just take out once the top (crust) turns a nice golden brown.  Update: I noticed someone said not to use 1min oats. It's ALL I use & everyone always LOVES THIS!

I'm a professional baker and was searching for a recipe for a die-hard caramel lover, this one was a huge Hit.  These had to be shipped overseas by the way and were fresh tasting to the end.

The adjustments I made worked perfectly for me.  I used one 9" X 13" pan and one 8" x 8" square pan.  I tripled the oatmeal mixture. I doubled the caramel/cream mixture, adding 12 extra caramels plus 2 additional Tbls. of cream.  I omitted the nuts because the person receiving them doesn't eat nuts; instead, I added more chococate chips (dark choclate, their favorite).

I added about 8 minutes to the final baking time; the top turns a nice, golden brown when the bars are ready.

Don't bother trying to cut these until they're cool. 
The 8" X 8" pan yielded 16 bars.
The 9" X 13" pan yielded 24 bars.

Simple recipe, rich taste, great with coffee. I wrapped each one individually and they made a delightful presentation in the giftbox, very homemade appeal, buttery taste. 
This one I will use again in gift assortments, very well received.

Kraft now makes a bag full of pea sized caramel bits which work great for this recipe, rather than unwrapping the squares..

Great for people who like caramel. A few tips:


Double the oat/sugar/butter/flour/salt/bkg soda mixture.  Then it will fit in a 9x13
Don't melt butter all the way, just soften.
Use about 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.
Microwave the cream and caramels - cuts time.
Super Easy and Super Delicious.I cut it when it was half way cooled and it was fine but don't cut right away because it will fall apart.

This recipe would be five stars with modifications. I lined my pan with foil to begin - I wanted to make a 9x13 pan, so after reading some of the reviews, I doubled the oatmeal mixture (using 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup milk, instead of 1 1/2 cups butter) and used exactly 50 caramels (one Kraft Caramels bag) with seven tablespoons heavy cream. The oatmeal mixture was a little sticky, so instead of "crumbling" the remainder on top, I pressed out small pieces and laid them over the top like a puzzle. Then I baked for twenty more minutes, until golden brown. To cut them into bars, I lifted out the foil with the whole dessert and partially froze them. They cut perfectly - I can't imagine trying to cut them warm from the oven - that would be a mess! When all was said and done, they were terrific - absolutely the best bar cookie I've ever had. DEFINITELY a make-again!!!

Jordanna thank you!!  I was recently at a Christmas party where these squares were served and I rushed home to find the recipe on allrecipes.com and there they are as big as life. I do believe these may very well be the best thing I have eaten in the sweets dept in a very long time. 
I have however made 1 major change. I put them in a 8x8 pan. They turned out terrible in the 9x13 and absolutely perfect in the 8x8. They are thicker googey and cooked to perfection. One other change I made was to put pecan pieces instead of walnuts as they are as soft chewy nut like the squares. It is great that these are so fast and simple to make and so yummy. Your cooking times and ingredients are exact for an 8x8. I am so very happy to have this recipe Jordanna, nice of you to share.

I have made this recipe for years, exactly the same, but my baking dish calls for an 8x11 glass pan. The recipe fits it perfectly. I am amazed to see it on here. I sold Tupperware in the 70's, one of my hostesses had this at her party, I got her recipe and have made it since that time.

Delicious and chewy! Everything you imagine in a caramel bar. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 inch baking pan. When bars are warm, fresh out of the oven, it is almost as if they aren’t completely cooked. But, as they cool, next day even, they become this moist, chewy, cookie like bar. I can see where reviewers have suggested cutting back on the melted butter (next time I make these I will try cutting back 1/2 cup). Also used another review…pizza cutter used while warm really works well. Very yummy!!!

These are delicious! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it calls for too much butter. I made them again and only used 1/2 a cup of melted butter and just less than a 1/4 cup of milk to make up the difference. It was much less greasy and just as much flavor.

I did a trial run of baking these before I make them for my kids Teachers Holiday Cookie Party.I made this in a 9x9 pan and added about a 1/2 cup more oats. It was perfect! I also forgot to buy the heavy cream so I used regular milk and it was fine. My husband and kids gave it 2 thumbs up. I will find out next week if it passes the Teachers test. This is one I will keep in my recipe file. Thanks!

I actuall think it would not work as written.  Thanks for all the advice.  However it is one of the best bars we've made after doubling the flour, oats, baking soda and salt and using 1 c. meled butter.  We put 3/4 of that mixture in a 9x13 pan that was lined w/ tin foil and sprayed w/ cooking spray.   We melted a whole 14 oz bag of caramels (50 pieces) with 7 T of milk (to save a little on fat content).  We used pecans vs. walnuts.  Made this way they were delicious!!!  We put in the fridge and cut after they cooled for about an hour.  Someone should re-write this recipe the way it actually works and call it something else.  Thanks to all for their comments so ours turned out great on the 1st try!

These are really good and rich!  I found the Kraft brand caramel bits, which worked great and used milk instead of cream.  I weighed 32 regular caramel squares and found that they weigh 8 ounces.  So I used 8 ounces of caramel bits (~1 1/4 cups).

This recipe is great....almost gave it four stars because I can't imagine making it without doubling the flour/oat/sugar mixture. I use one entire flour/oat/sugar recipe for the bottom crust, then follow the recipe quantities and top it all off with another round of the dry mixture. I agree that you do not need to use heavy cream with the caramels....half and half or even milk work just fine. I am asked for this recipe every time I take it somewhere...and I always give them the adjusted version. This is a big favorite in our lives.

Took these to a work potluck and was asked for the recipe many times. Very simple recipe to follow. Used caramel ice cream topping in place of caramels. Next time I will add more chocolate. Good recipe will make many times!

I LOVE these! Perfect brown sugar/oat crust and goey caramel. I think they actually get softer after a day or two. So easy, so good!  Take the advice of other reviewers and double the flour/oat mixture, but not the caramel mixture (I used one bag of caramels and 7tbls cream).   Lining the pan with foil is important, otherwise the caramel will stick pretty stubbornly. Plus, it makes it so much easier to cut! But WAIT until they've cooled before you pull the whole thing out of the pan.  I also reccomend using 3/4 of the mixture for the bottom layer and the remainder for the top, just because the bottom layer will get baked longer and that way it won't get too crunchy. Be sure to press the top layer together a bit so forms one layer. I baked the bottom for 12 min and the top for 15.  I've made these once with chocolate chips and once without. I prefer without (and I never use the nuts).

I've died and gone to heaven!! Here's an easy way to deal with all those changes/suggestions.  Change the yield to 36 servings and change the quantities - basically 1-1/2 the recipe.  Then I just used a 14 oz bag of caramels, only one cup of butter (should I really say "only") and added more choc. chips, just eyed it as I sprinkled on, and used pecan instead of walnuts - just a personal preference.  Anyways - worked well for me.  There is no way the original recipe would fill a 9x13 pan without the crusts being so thin.  Enjoy - these are sooooo good.

These are really good the first day and only improve with age. I have just started using heath bits instead of nuts and they taste like little candy bars. I find them easier to get out of the pan if you grease it first and don't pour the caramel to the edge.

I love caramel and after I read this recipe I just had to try it.  I tweaked it a little bit, though and it turned out fine.  I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and I doubled the entire recipe.  I used milk chocolate chips and walnuts, but I used pecans in half of the pan and I think I like the pecans better.  Pecans go well with caramel and chocolate, just like turtles candy.  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the melted butter and poured it over the flour mixture.  I took a pan to my job and they were a huge hit.  Remember to spray the pan with a little Pam and they'll come out a little easier.  Let the bars cool before cutting them.

Oh, yeah.  Yum.  Ooey-gooey, crunchy-chewy.  It's gotta be healthy with all those oats, right?  And, all that protein in the nuts?  Well, there, I've justified this wonderful little snack for you so you can make these fabulous bars.  As others suggested, I doubled EVERYTHING except the carmel - I will use the whole bag next time though.  I used a professional 10"x10" pan and baked the base for 15 minutes and the bars for 18 minutes.  They were perfect.  I cut them when cooled.  I actually made two batches at the same time and made one with pecans/chocolate chips and the other with walnuts/no chocolate chips.  You should try this recipe if you need a ooey-gooey-chewy-crispy-crunchy fix.  I really wouldn't decrease the butter as others suggested - come on, it holds the oats and nuts together!  :)

Geat tasting bars!!  But the recipe is a little off.  Pull out a square pan as well as the 9 by 13 in. pan and see which one works best for you.Use less nuts and double all the ingredients except the cream and caramel (you will have leftovers but its better then not enough.

This is one of the best Caramel Bar recipes I have made. These are simply delicious and easy to make. I would suggest not spreading the caramel mixture clear to the edge of the pan, as it bubbles over the crust and becomes a bit harder. I had to trim about 1" of the outside crust, where the caramel was tough.

This recipe was incredible.  I used milk chocolate chips, semi sweet chips, AND Heath Toffee bits.  I did make them in the 9x13 pan, which works well. It does make the topping a little scattered on top, but it's OK, it just shows you the ribbons of caramel and chocolate that lie underneath...yummy!  Thanks for a keeper! :)

Boy O Boy these are GOOD!!!  I made these as part of a V'tine's day goodie giftset.  YUM-O!  I ended up using flax seed flour b/c I had no all-purpose on hand.  Worked out WELL (plus I felt less guilty). :p  Next time I'm going to replace the chocolate w/carob.  The chocolate and caramel were a bit sweet to me.  Like others I doubled most ingredients, but not the nuts.  I just used a bag of chocolate chunks and bag of packaged caramels.  

Yummy thru and thru.  These keep well in the freezer if wrapped individually in wax paper and placed in a sealed container.  Wait until they have firmed a good bit before trying to cut.  Makes it less messy.  A good spray of oil would probably help them release a bit better.  Easy recipe that I'll make time and time again I'm sure.

This recipe earned 5 stars for taste and appearance but there is no way it will fit in a 9x13 pan unless the dough ingredients are doubled.  I made this recipe in a 11x7 brownie pan and the thickness was just right.

Fantastic.  I thought that there wasn't enough oatmeal base so I added about a cup more of oatmeal and about a half stick of butter.  It makes the base a bit more thick and easier to cut.  I am swamped with requests for the recipe!!

These are DELICIOUS. The only reason I'm giving the recipe 4 instead of 5 stars is that it really does need to be made in an 8x8 pan; 9x13 is way too big. So glad I read the other reviews first!! I used a little more than half of the oat mixture on the bottom of the pan, and I also added 6 minutes to the second baking segment (18 minutes total), so that the caramel was beginning to bubble up around the edges. I also left out the nuts, since I don't like them and didn't know if anyone was allergic. I made these for my company's holiday cookie exchange, and I've gotten rave reviews!

Okay, these JUST came out of the oven and I can reasonably assure you that the life span of this pan is about 12 hours.  I did as others and doubled the flour, oats and brown sugar. I increased the butter to 1 cup and that seems to give the crust a good consistency.  I reserved 1 1/2 c for sprinkling on top. Allowed a few extra minutes in the oven to account for the added volume.  These are really really really good.  If my family doesn't want these again, I'll be quite surprised.

I go with the recommendation of doubling the dry ingredients for the top and bottom with only 1 cup of melted butter.  I use 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts with a 14 oz bag of wrapped caramels melted with 7 tbspns of heavy cream all baked in a 9x13 foil lined glass pan.  So so delicious!!!  Thank you Jordanna for this awesome combo!

5 stars for the taste. However, I wish I had read the reviews more thoroughly.  I would have reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and doubled the oatmeal mixture because otherwise the proportion of caramel is too much and they come out too soft.  Used 9x9 glass dish with no problem.  Don't know why they suggest to cut while hot. Much easier to do this after they cool.  In fact, I kept thinking they weren't done because they were so gooey in the middle - I finally figured out this was just the caramel that needed to be cooled and set.

These are SO AWESOME!!!  I absolutely love them!  I do agree with other reviewers said about it not being enough for a 9 x 13 pan.  I put it into an 8x8 and it was perfect.  When I wanted a 9x13, I doubled it.

I used an 8x8 pan, which makes for a much nicer bar.  These were excellent, everyone loved them.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Very good!

OOEY-GOOEY YUMMY!!!  I decided at the last minute to have a sweet treat for after dinner.  I had 45 minutes before our guests arrived and in that time these were baked and cooling. I did cheat and had to use a jarred caramel topping since I had no time to go get, unwrap and melt caramels.  But it worked out just fine.  I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in the 9x11 pan making 24 squares(really do not see how the recipe as stated would fit).  I do think I may have used too much caramel because mine looked nothing like the pictures, the caramel and chocolate were oozing out when cut (still delish though).  Also, when doubled, it calls for 1.5 cups of butter...WOW!  I used it, and they were great, but ohhhh...the guilt!! I think next time I will cut back to 1.25 cups of butter and use the recommended caramel sauce and see how that works. A definite must try!!!

I saw this recipe at 5 p.m. and had it made by 6 p.m. Served it for dessert at 6:30 and my husband said to give it 5 and 1/2 stars! We really enjoyed this bar. I made it in an 11 X 7 and reduced the butter to 1/2 C.  It was still rich and gooey, but not too greasy. Thanks, Jordanna.

I'd like to try this recipe, but there's no way I'm unwrapping all those caramels, jeez what a drag. If you have to buy heavy cream anyway, and dirty a pan to do the caramel part anyway, why not make the caramel from scratch? It'd be so much easier.

This is an absolutely wonderful bar cookie.  I have made it numerous times for friends at work and we all love them.  But I find if I double the crust ingredients to make them thicker they are even better, not so rich that way.  I rated them a 4 for quickness and easiness because it is an  effort to unwrap all the caramels and little messy to melt them.  The kids love to help unwrap but I'm not sure about them helping with the melting.   BTW the kids love to eat them too, if grown-ups would only share!

We made 1-1/2 times the oat mixture, which turned out perfectly in the 9x13 pan.  Absolutely love it!  We made a 2nd batch without the walnuts, but it wasn't nearly as good as the one with walnuts.

Great for a bake sale.  I skipped the chocolate chips only because I was out of them.  The walnuts I substituted pecans for.  I used a 7x11 inch pan and they were great.

I definitely give this 5 stars! I doubled the crust part and instead of melting the butter, cut it into cubes and pulsed it all in my food processor. I then put 2/3 of the mixture into the bottom of the pan and was able to sprinkle the remaining 1/3 over the top of the bars which I found to be easier and give it a crumb topping look.  In a pinch, I substituted the caramel and used some thick homemade caramel sauce that I can and it worked perfectly!  I tried to keep the caramel away from the outer edges and didn't have much problem with the sides sticking to the pan.  Next time I will try using the caramels, I was just in a pinch and needed something to take to an activity for my children and made due with what I had.  All in all, an excellent recipe that I am sure I will be making over and over again!

These are so sinful!  I made mine in a 9x13 before I read others reviews about making it in a smaller pan and I'm glad I did.  I did have to use more than 1/2 the oat mixture for the bottom, more like 2/3.  With the reserve oat mixture I added 1-2 more tablespoons of flour to make it more crumbly.  My bars held together great.  This one is definitely a keeper!

So yummy! I did make some adjustments due to what I had on hand - and it turned out great! In place of heavy cream, I used 5 T. of Hazelnut-flavored coffee creamer, and it totally added to the flavor of these bars! I highly reccomend using flavored coffee creamer, like hazelnut, French vanilla, Southern Butter Pecan, Amaretto, etc. Also, I didn't have any choc. chips - but a bag of Hershey's Kisses - so I chopped some of those up and used pecans in place of the walnuts. Oh, and I only had 26 caramels and it was perfectly fine. Great recipe, Thanks!

I've had people tell me these are the best bars of any kind that they've ever had, and I agree!  I double the recipe for a 9x13 pan and they are a perfect size and thickness.  I use two bags of the already unwrapped caramel pieces (usually in the baking aisle) and those save a lot of time.  Thank you for a great recipe--these are so good!!

Tasty! I found them difficult (gooey)to cut out at first so I just scored the pcs, set the pan outside for little while to harden, then brought them back in and let sit to room temperature before cutting them out.

These were SO good!  Everyone that tried them loved them!  The only thing I changed was that I used milk instead of heavy cream with the caramels, and it turned out fine, less fat too!  Next time I will double the oatmeal cookie part so I have more to cover the top.

After reading all the reviews about what to change on the oatmeal mixture for these bars I decided to double it, but only use 1 cup of butter.  I used half the mixture on the bottom, but held back about 2/3 cup on the top.  I had my 7 grandkids, ages 3 to 13, helping me bake for the weekend.  They all thought I should make about 10 of these to take to the Labor Day Party we're going to.  In their words--these bars rock!  They also talked me into baking the extra oatmeal crust mixture until it was crunchy and melting the extra caramels with a little milk, so they could have that combination on top of some vanilla ice cream.  I did.  It was great.

This is my new favorite recipe! I've made it about 4 times in the last month. I would definitely recommend doubling the recipe for a 9x13 pan though. I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and omitted the nuts. I even added a little cinnamon. I found that the better quality chocolate you use, the better it comes out. (I used the Gheradhelli choc chips). Everyone I made this for loved it!

Excellent-  I followed the exact suggestions made by the professional baker on April 16, 2007. Perfect changes.  Making 1 9x13 and 1 8x8 since my kids always come by to take some home. Very rich and delicious.

Wow. Sugar overload! You get that sick to your stomach feeling after you eat one of these.  Too many modifications needed to make this workable.  Cut them into bars while still warm?!  Uh, I don't think so.  **UPDATE:  Boy, did I ever jump the gun on this one... I rated this prematurely and I'm sorry I did.  After allowing these bars to sit covered overnight, they were just as described; albeit decadent, the flavor was wonderful. I would definitely make them again.

I used an 8 x 8 inch glass baking dish.  Also, I used real butter & increased the final segment of baking by 6 mins. The bars turned out nice & golden brown and absolutely perfect!  Be sure to let the bars cool completely before cutting.  This is a keeper!

The first time I made this I screwed it up, but I made it again and the portions are right, for an 8x8 pan.  But even when I screwed it up, people forbade me to throw it away, after having a bite.  I don't know how anyone else can use anything bigger (than an 8x8) unless the recipe is altered.  I left out the nuts - it tastes just as good!

Sooooo good!! The bars turned out even better then I expected. To avoid running short of bottom crust I used a 8x12 pan ; pressed and spread 2/3rds of the crust mix with the back of a wide spatula with veg. spray. After baking I sprinkled without measuring choc. chips and nuts; poured over the caramel (I melted together the cream and caramels in the microwave); then sprinkled over top the remaining crust. I wouldn't alter the recipe accept maybe a little less buttter. Just writing this review makes me want to make them again.

I had my 10 year old open all the caramels while he was watching t.v. so that was no sweat for me.  The result is fantastic.  I gave one to my 18 year old who is somewhat picky on desserts and he said "this is the best thing in the world".  That has to be worthy of 5 stars!  They were gone by the following day.  Update: I had to come back on and update this review.  I've made these many times now and even packaged them up and mailed them to my son in college.  They were still moist and fresh when he received them 2 days later.  Great!

Amazing!  I used milk instead of the heavy cream and omitted the walnuts (because I didn't have either on hand, LOL!), and they turned out just wonderful.  I love the crust and the combination of the flavors is unique and delicious.  A definite make-it-again.

Holy molly these were amazing...........too good (I ate the whole pan.)  
I followed the recipe as stated but used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9 x 13.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  But as written - it really should go into an 8x8 or 9x9 pan - not a 13x9.  If you want to use the larger size pan, do as others suggest and double to base ingredients (1 cup butter is enough).   There wasn't enough for the topping if you don't.  The flavors are wonderful together!

These are good.  A nice chewy bar cookie.  I, like others, doubled the crust.  I ended up not using 1/4 of the doubled mixture, but that's just me.  I also used one 14 oz. package of caramels (I really like caramel) instead of 32.  It was somewhere around 50+ caramels.  I also didn't use double the amount of butter.  I ended up using 1 cup in total instead of 1 1/2 cups.  That again may be a personal preference but I didn't want the base to get too greasy.  

All in all, I didn't change the recipe (just used more of it) and they turned out great.  If you were to make as directed, I would opt for an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 to make sure you have enough base.  I will definitely make again.  Quick and easy.

These were yummy!  I took the advice of some other reviewers, and doubled all of the dry ingredients, and used 1 cup of butter.  I also used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of walnuts instead of a1/2 cup each.  I will make them again.  I bet they will be awesome straight from the fridge or freezer!

Followed reviewers' suggestions: 1) lined the 9x13 pan with foil for easy removal; 2) doubled the flour/oats/sugar/baking soda/salt; and 3) increased melted butter to 1 cup and heavy cream (milk also works just fine) to 7 tbsp. Cut when cool. The caramel mixture does take a bit of time to form, but patience! The end result is completely worth it :)

Interesting dessert.  Cook this in a 8X8 pan.  I used a 1/2 cup of chopped  cashews instead of walnuts.  I also mixed the cashews and the morsels in a bag before adding it to the oatmeal crust.  I'm not sure if I would add nuts again; you can barely taste them in the bar.

Based on reviews from others, I doubled the oats, flour and baking soda.  I increased the brown sugar to 1 cup (thought doubling that would be too sweet).  I stuck with the 3/4 cup of butter as the recipe says.  I found that this made for too much crust which overpowered the caramel, chocolate, walnut mixture (I made this "fillling" as recipe states).  Next time I will make 1.5 of the recipe for the "crust" and use the whole bag of the caramels (50 caramels), and possibly reduce the amount of chocolate chips as I also found those to be a bit overpowering.  Also, I used half whole wheat flour.  DEFINITELY bake in a foil lined pan and DO NOT attempt to cut until cooled.

My sister is in the Air Force and currently deployed in Iraq.  I made a double batch of these and sent them to her and her crew, she said they were a HUGE hit and were all gobbled up within 10 minutes of arriving there.  I quadrupled the crumble mixture, and doubled the caramel, nut, chocolate filling, and divided in two 9x13 baking dishes. (made MANY bars)  I cut into squares, individually wrapped each square in plastic wrap, and placed the wrapped bars in tupperware containers before packing.  These took 7 days to arrive in Iraq and my sister said they were still amazing.

These truly do live up to all the fuss AFTER the recipe is modified a bit: As written there isn't enough oat mixture for both layers so DEFINITELY double it, but the butter is a little excessive so when I double the oat mixture I only use 1 cup of butter. Also I use the whole 14 oz. bag of Kraft caramels (which is a little more than the 32 individual caramels called for). I've used milk when I didn't have heavy cream and I've used rolled oats and quick oats and I've never noticed a difference.  I recommend adding in salted peanuts instead of the walnuts, the saltiness cuts down on the sweetness (and these ARE super sweet).

I get SO many compliments on these and everyone asks me to make them again and again. They are VERY rich, a small square will do you :)

These were really really tasty without being wayyy too sweet...perfect for a sweet tooth. Since I saw this bar was hard to keep together, I made 1.5 times the crumb recipe, and used the half recipe for the crumb topping, using all of the original amount for the bottom of the pan. I also melted a little extra caramel to cover to the sides. It also helped to spray the sides of the pan with cooking spray to keep the caramel from sticking afterwards. Also, you can score the bars while still warm, but wait to cut them until they have cooled completely, to avoid a gooey mess. I ran a knife under hot water and cleaned off any gunk after each cut, and that seemed to help out a LOT. Great recipe! I'll be making this again!

I followed Chef Joy's advise and doubled the oat mixture but used 1c butter plus 2T so the dough would not be dry and crumbly.  It worked very well. I used 3/4's of the mixture for the crust and the remaining 1/4 for the crumb topping. Again following others advice I did not double the filling and was pleased with the results. I also used CookinginFL's advice and used a hazelnut coffee creamer in place of the cream. It added a very nice subtle taste to the bar. Baked in a 9x13 pan I cooked the bottom crust 15 min. added the filling and topping and baked another 18 min.

Use all the other reviews about less butter & double the crust. I noticed some people said they didn't Like the chocolate being overbearing. USE THE CARAMEL SWIRL CHIPS. THESE ARE MAGNIFICENT !!!!!! You can NEVER have too much caramel.

These have potential, but I think they need a little work. Tasty and rich, but the bottoms were greasy from so much butter. I thought the caramel flavor was lost in the chocolate. Next time, I would lessen the butter, leave out the chocolate and probably add a bit more nuts. Also, I would use a smaller pan to get thicker bars.

GREAT recipe!!!  I took these to work and they were a huge hit.  I did double the oatmeal portion because there was no way it was going to fit (saw this in the reviews after also) in a 9x13 pan, next time I'd do 11/2 as a double batch was too much.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of my new favorite desserts. The recipe is very good but I made several changes based on reviews I read and my personal preferences. First, I used pecans instead of walnuts and skim milk instead of heavy cream. I used a 9x13 pan, doubled the crust/crumb mixture, used more chocolate chips and pecans (just enough to make sure there would be chocolate and pecans in every bite), but did not double the caramel. To lower the calories, for the crust/crumb mixture, I used only 1/4 cup of butter, about 2 Tb of margarine, and about 3 Tb of applesauce -- yes applesauce, I wasn't sure if it was going to work, but it did. I basically added the applesauce until the mixture was wet enough to be pressed into the pan. The result was a non-greasy, chocolatey, gooey caramel bar. DELICIOUS! Next time I will add a bit of vanilla to the caramel mixture, since it seemed like it could use a bit more flavor.

Oh my gosh, these are great. I used about 40 caramels, just because I had them. I left out the chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts. I used a 9x9 pan and it was perfect. My co-workers flipped over these!

These are awesome!  Pretty easy to make too.  I took them to a church dinner, and 4 people asked me for the recipe before I left.  My husband doesn't like caramel (crazy!), so if I make these just for us, I eat the whole pan...and savor every bite.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I cooked these in an 8x8 pan. I left them in the oven too long because they looked to runny to me. Word from the wise: don't worry about runny because the caramel will set up as it cools. That said, my husband really liked these and wants them again some time. It's a good recipe and you can count on just about anybody liking these.

Great recipe!

My suggestion:

Use caramel dip (usually next to the apples in the grocery store) instead of unwrapping and melting caramel candies with the heavy cream. It's less expensive and does not make a mess of a pan. Just microwave it in 10sec intervals until easy to spread!

This was excellent, but don't let the 5 stars fool you, I definitely had to make some changes. I should have initially listened to my conscience and left out the semi-sweet chocolate morsels. As other reviewers have said, the chocolate takes away from the caramel. I used milk chocolate morsels, and just spread them lightly over the "crust".

Secondly, you must double or even triple the oat/flour mix. Seriously, double/triple the entire thing, because if you want to get the results like the photos, you need a lot more mixture.

The taste was great though. Addictive.

I gave this 4 stars because it was just a little too rich for me.  They were great bars though.  I doubled the oatmeal mixture and it really needed it.  I left out the walnuts so my son could try the bars.  Over all a good bar recipe, I will make it again to take somewhere, but not to have around the house.

This was wonderful!  I had trouble filling a 9x13 pan so I used an 8x8.  I used 4 whole Hershey bars instead of the semi sweet called for in the recipe which really put this over the top!  I had to put it in the fridge to set up a bit.  But I love this recipe and will make it again.  I can't stay away from the pan! Thank you!

After all of the raving, I had to make these bars.  I left out the chocolate and nuts because they aren't my favorites and I wonder if that had a big impact on how they turned out.  First, I doubled the crust recipe like most of the reviews said and used a 13 x 9 pan.  I wasn't clear on how long I was supposed to bake the crust with the added ingredients.  I also didn't know if we were supposed to press the top mixture into the caramel.  At any rate, the taste is pretty good (although I can barely taste the caramel and they actually taste like shortbread) but mine are so messy.  They're crumbling every where.  Any ideas as to what I did wrong?

Took others advice and cut the butter to a cup and doubled the oat mixture. I added 1 tbl of instant french vanilla coffee to the milk before melting. I also used a 9x13 pan lined with foil and sprayed with Pam to make removing easy when cool. Quick tip(use a pizza cutter to cut bars)

Loved these!  I used a 9x9 pan but followed all other directions exactly as stated (actually I think I used more chocolate chips than recipe called for) and they were awesome!  Using a smaller pan I still didn't need to adjust the baking time at all.  If you use a 9x13 I think you'll have a difficult time spreading the crust across the bottom.

I made this for my flatmates last night and they loved it!! I made mine in a 9x13 after doubling the crust mixture as per earlier suggestions. I think it turned out really well. I served mine warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I had a few caramels left over in the package so I made up some more sauce and dribbled it over the top of the bars and ice cream, I am happy to report that it tasted even better than it looked! Thanks for the great recipe and all the great tips!!!!

These are amazing!  My second batch is baking in the oven right now. All I had was a 9x9 baking pan and as some of the other reviewers said, there is barely enough of the dough to cover the bottom of the pan( and I used a smaller pan than called for) let alone reserve half for the topping.  So after I used up all the oat mixture for the pan, I divided the recipe in half and made an extra batch of batter to crumble on top.  It was the perfect amount and they came out amazing!!!

These turned out great! I followed the advice of other reviewers, doubled the oatmeal mixture and added 1 cup of butter to it. I used 50 caramels to 7 T of heavy cream. Baked in 9x13.

Really good!  But, following the advice of others, I used an 8x8 pan, and only half a cup of butter.  Press the top layer gently in.  Next time I will use mini chips, because the whole ones are a bit chunky in the bar.

Definitely making again.

Followed this to the letter and served it to a slew of high schoolers.  They all loved them.  NOTE:  the dough doesn't look like it's nearly enough to cover the pan but be patient.  It will cover it!  Oh, and I did spray the pan with PAM before assembling them.  It didn't say to but I thought I should.

These are dangerous! You can't help but be tempted to eat all of them. The only reason I didn't give this recipe a 5* was because I can't imagine making these in a 9x13 pan! And why would you want to double the crust mixture of these CARAMEL bars to make it fit in a 9x13 pan? That doesn't make sense to me. Just make them in an 8x8 pan and wala, perfection! I think there's plenty of topping mixture, I used a whole bag of caramels (might use a few extra text time) and also used a little extra nuts, but other than that I made them in an 8x8 pan, baked as directed, and they were amazing. I pressed the top crust onto the caramel mixture and I had no problems with it falling apart. I really think this recipe was made to be baked in an 8x8 pan. I'm adding them to my Christmas gift boxes this year.  I yielded 12 nice size bars…in my 8x8 pan!:)

Wonderful. I always make a 12x18 size pan of these, because they go so fast. Followed alot of the suggested changes.  I increase the oat mixture by 3 times, reducing the butter to 1/2 cup (for a total of 1 1/2 c.) Keep the chocolate chips at 1/2 c, and chop them up.  Double the caramel mixture and sprinkle it with kosher salt before putting the remaining oatmeal mixture on top.  Salted Caramel Oatmeal bars. Soooo good

I have to express to you HOW GREAT these are! I'm not joking. I ate these instead of lunch. I think I had 10 of these bars. If you like caramel, you have to make this. This is going to be my new go-to dessert thing for a long time. ***UPDATE*** I just made these AGAIN!!! Here is my tip: double the crust/topping. These are insanely good!

SOOOOOO GOOD!!!  I doubled the crust/oatmeal though, half of 1 batch didn't even cover the bottom of my 11x13 dish.  I lined the dish with foil and sprayed with Pam and let the bars sit overnight, made removing and cutting a lot easier.

Almost all of the five stars in this recipe changed all of the proportions.  I wish that I had read through them before making this.  We changed the walnuts to pecans but left the rest the same.  We wanted a caramel treat and did not want to wait the hour it takes to make caramel popcorn.  In the end, I regretted that decision.  This just wasn't worth the dessert calories for us.

Awsome!! The only thing i did do differently is I put it in a smaller pan. The 13 x 9 pan is just way to big for this recipe. If you want to make a thick bar use a smaller pan. Overall this recipe was very tastey and the kids love them.

Definitely cut down on the butter.  If you follow the recipe using the amount of butter it says to, it gets too greasy. Definitely make this in a smaller pan too Otherwise, I think this might be ok. I probably will not make this again though.

I always get rave reviews from this recipe.  I prefer a thicker oat:cara-choco-nut:oat ratio, so using the same size pan; I double the oat layer dough, cutting back the butter by 1/4cup (to 1 1/4 cups total) and use 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 2 cups of regular flour. I've also tried adding a little bit of cinnamon to the oat layer and mixing and matching chocolate chip/nut mixes which have also turned out great! Very recommended :)

These are awesome.  I've made them a few different times and tried a few different suggestions.  I left out the heavy cream and subbed a splash of skim milk in the caramel mixture, turns out great.  If you cut down the butter to 1/2 cup, the crust part is a bit more crumbly before it is cooked, but perfect when finished.  I tried adding a bit of milk to the crust mixture when leaving out the butter, made for a much more gooey texture of the precooked AND cooked bars.  Either way tastes delicious.  These have been a hit every time I've made them and with each variation as well.

These are amazing!  I made an 8x8 pan, otherwise there would not have been enough crust in my opinion.  However, this left me with too much caramel so they were REALLY gooey!  Oh, well, we just had to eat them with a fork.  I got raving reviews when we had my parents over for dinner.  :)

Mannnnnnn oh man. I HATE how good these bars taste, mainly because I cannot seem to control how many I eat. I have a large 11 X 15 baking pan that I use to make these. I make 2.5 times the flour, sugar, oats,  baking soda & butter. I make double the caramel sauce and eyeball the chocolate chips. I also use pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone loves these bars!!!

These were delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 cup butter and a 1/4 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup butter.  I even used a 9x13 in pan and they came out perfectly without doubling the ingredients for the crust/top layer crumble mixture. Wonderful recipe!

Very easy.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so throwing these together was quick.  The only thing I changed about the recipe was to double the amount of the crust to produce more of a layer on the top.    Took them to a bbq and they were a hit!

These are very good!!!!  I did use an 8X8 pan and it works better in my opinion.  Our family loves rolos so instead of the caramel mixture the recipe calls for I used them instead and it was even better!! Just used 3 packages of the candy instead of the individually wrapped ones and cut them into pieces. I did put some chocolate chips in too.  Very ymmy and soft!

OMG!!!  I made these for a party but can't stop eating them!  I am going to have to make another batch haha.  So so good and very easy to make.  I put a layer of foil down like others suggested they just came right out.  This recipe is my new favorite!

These really were lovely. I too doubled the crust recipe and used 1 C of melted butter and am very glad I did. I can't really imagine having only half of that crust! I sort of lightly pressed the top crust on top of the caramel. Had to cut off the ends where the caramel seeped out and got sort of burnt/crunchy. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Amazing!  I did make a few modifications.  I doubled the crust mixture.  I used evaporated milk for the caramels and added 1/2 cup to the crust while reducing the butter to 1/2 cup.  I used oat flour too.  This is great since it is allergen friendly, no eggs and I can omit nuts as needed for other family allergies.  I lined my pan with foil and sprayed with non-stick.  MUST let cool completely before cutting to get best results.  I put it in the fridge but could not wait long enough.  Edges were cold but center was warm.  For the topping I placed it in the fridge while the bottom was cooking and then flattened in my hand to form small pancake like disks and placed on top, pushing it into the caramel.  Excellent-already put in my permanent file!

Oh, My Yummy Goodness! These bars are delicious and a must try. I didn't have heavy cream and used 4 tablespoons of milk instead and I drizzled some semi-sweet chocolate chips on top.

Fantastic rich caramel bars!!!! The quality of the caramel plays a huge role in the rich flavour! Made it twice for office functions and dinners at my house and it is a smash hit each time. Will definitely be putting this in my personal recipe vault!!

Oh my gosh, these should be declared illegal LOL! I took tips from others and doubled the crust ingredients. Saved a bit of time by using the microwave to melt the caramels rather than doing it on the stovetop. Baked in a 9x13-inch pan lined with foil lightly sprayed with PAM. I used about 3/5 of the crust on the bottom and sprinkled the remainder over the top. Once they were cooled completely I cut them with a pizza cutter which was also sprayed with PAM. Then I made the mistake of trying one... and another... and another... These are so rich and delicious and go great with a cup of coffee.

I gave this recipe a 4 for flavor, but mine is just a big gooey mess.  I'm not sure what I did wrong.  Great with ice cream, maybe, but there is no bar form to them.  Really tasty flavor though!

This is so good! I'm glad I made it! I gave 3 "flavors" to the bars. One third of the crust was covered with nuts, another with chocolate chips and the last one with both. Great for different preferences!

I made these to take to a family gathering and they barely made it there! I had to hide these from my husband-twice (he found them the first time)! I doubled everything and used a 9x13 pan. I used cashews instead of walnuts. They should be cut while still slightly warm, but not completely cooled.

I wish I had read ALL the reviews. I did double flour,oats,b.sugar,baking soda,salt. Did add a few more carmels about 40 in all and 6 T.Heavy cream used 1/2 C. pecans and 1/2 C. s.Choc.Did have to bake crust longer 18 min, the final baking is were I mest up,just cook until top is  lightly toasty,still will be soft to the touch,but will harden when cool,(wish I had read that)Still great, So bake  about  25m and check. I cooked mine about 35-40Min  It was still soft   THEN realized the carmel would stay soft until hardened.  Enjoy!

I made these with high expectations based on all the wonderful reviews but they just weren't all that great. They weren't bad but I probably wouldn't make them again. I found them to be too gooey and the caramel flavor was just so-so.

Took other reviewers suggestions - doubled the "crust" part and chocolate chips; used pecans, cut down a bit on the butter and only cut after chilling the fridge.  I really liked them and got great reviews from others on them.  Definitely keeping the recipe.

These were just okay...not worth all the five star ratings in my opinion.  I agree with the previous reviewers that these were too sweet.  Won't make again.

Love these bars!  I found that I preferred baking them in an 8x8 pan.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, as we are not fond of walnuts.  Delicious!

Oh my gosh. I want to marry this recipe. Seriously. The only thing I did differently was to omit the chocolate (don't like chocolate), substitute cinnamon-spice-flavored coffee creamer for the heavy cream, and I sprinkled 2 chopped peeled apples on the baked crust with the nuts before topping with the caramel. (swooning in delight)

Very good and gooey!  I made them in a smaller pan and they were perfect.  Definitely had to wait until they were cooler to cut into bars!

I followed the recipe exactly and initially thought that bars would be way to thin.  However, they are knock-your-socks-off rich so thinness is not a problem.  I made a batch and sent to work with my hubby.  Five women (on diets!) at the entire batch!  I got several requests for the recipe.  These are wonderful and I will definitely be making them again!

Oh so Good! I only added a half cup more flour and oats.The only problem I had was I should have made two batches, they did not last every long everyone ate them up! Thanks for the recipe.

YUMMY! These were absolutely wonderful. The only thing I did differently was I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I make them - and trust me there will be a next time - I will either double the recipe and use the 13 X 9 inch pan or keep the recipe the same and use a 9 X 9 inch pan. I think it will thicker and gooier that way! THANKS for the recipe!

These were great!  I baked in a 8x8 glass pan and used pecans as per another reviewer; they meshed well with the other flavors.  The carmelly-goodness was very unique compared to other cookies I make.  
I thought the cookie itself was a little greasy, especially after the first day I made them.  This didn't stop anyone from eating them (myself included!) but I thought it made them a little less appealing.

These were awesome!  I used skim milk instead of heavy cream since that was all I had, but it turned out fine.  I also omitted the nuts, added more chocolate chips and substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of all-purpose flour.  I will definitely make these again!

The taste was very good, and the recipe was easy to make. I microwaved the caramel which was easier than on the stove. Be sure to use a metal pan- the first time I made this, I made the mistake of using a Pyrex glass pan- with bad results. Also, soften the butter, but do not melt it.  The butter should form a crumble and 1/2 cup softened worked better than 3/4 melted.
Good taste, but may take a few tries to perfect this in the convection oven.

Soooo good! I used a 9x13 pan, and I not only doubled the flour and oats, but the butter, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Doing this will make the mixture wet, not crumbly, so I used a rubber spatula to press out the bottom layer, then for the top layer I sort of pressed flat pieces with my hands then laid it over the top. Also, I used a whole 14 ounce bag of wrapped caramels(52 caramels) and melted it with 8 and a half tablespoons of milk- just as good! Because I did not use walnuts, I took another user's advice and used a half cup of coconut. Using extra caramel helps to not let the chocolate drown out the caramel flavor. I had to bake my bottom layer for 11 or 12 minutes and my top for 15 to 18 minutes. It will be nice, brown and a little dry looking when done. Try these, they are great!

These are really good.  Really easy too.  I bought the bag of pea-sized Kraft caramels (no unwrapping required) and used that, and I also used half and half instead of cream.  The only problem with the recipe is the pan size.  There is no way that this would work in a 9x13.  In fact, I had my 9x13 greased and ready to go, and made the "dough".  I looked at the dough and realized there was not nearly enough to form two layers in the bigger pan.  So I used a 9x9 pan and it was just perfect!  (I hadn't read any reviews before starting, but I did after, and realized many people did the same).  I brought these to a Christmas party and they were all gone.

oh my...these will ruin a diet (with a smile, though). definitely double the oatmeal mixture. Chocolate overpowers the caramel for me, so I used butterscotch chips (about 1/2 cup). The combination boosts the caramel flavor. I might try chopped walnuts on top next time, too.

Amazing!  These are SOOO good warm and even better the next day.  I also doubled the oatmeal mixture, used a 9x13 and used about 40 caramels...received rave reviews!  Will definitely be adding to my recipe box.

These are great. Wish I would've read the reviews before I made them, because I was confused as to how half of the oatmeal mix was suppose to fit in a 13x9 pan. Next time I'll try an 8x8 pan, less butter, and more caramel. I use about a cup of choc. chips too! :)

I love this recipe. I am a huge fan of chocolate but a bigger fan of carmel and these sinful things hit the spot. They're great for a cookie swap because a 13 x 9 pan will go very far. They are so rich that I cut them into more than 24 pieces (about the size of a bite size candy bar). Thank you for the great recipe!

Very good, very easy.  The most involved step in unwrapping caramels, and the rest is simple and quick!  Very yummy...especially after they have totally cooled.  I made them in an 8x8 pan, which made a nice, thick bar.  Seems like a 13x9 pan would make them much too thin.  I added about a half cup of coconut to the crumble mixture - excellent!!  I've already made them again.  They disappear VERY quickly!

Yum!!!  So easy and so good.  I did add more chocolate chips, though, b/c I LOVE chocolate.  So good!  I also mixed the crust ingredients right in the 9x13, and then I took out 1/2 for the topping.  That worked just fine.

Crumble the ingredients over the top of the caramel layer?! - really??? Mine was rather sticky and I measured exactly.  Also, I unfortunately didn't read the reviews before I began so I didn't make the pan adjustment everyone suggested.  Recipe has potential with a great mix of ingredients, but needs too much tweaking to consider it 5 star.  My result turned out good, but I'm not convinced it's the way the recipe intended.

Although these were very sweet, we enjoyed them.  My son especially loved them and wants me to make them again.  I made them in a square pan, and it worked great.  I think I'll let it cool more before I cut and take out of pan.  Doing it while still warm made them a little more difficult to get out.

Scaled to 32 servings, substituted whole wheat flour for white, and used jarred (Mexican, goat's milk) caramel.  Otherwise made as directed-- delicious!

These were fantastic.  I used 4 (56gr) boxes of Macintosh's Toffee (8 oz total).  I doubled the crust/crumb recipe but only used 1 1/4 c. of butter.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent!  Got rave reviews at our potluck picnic.  Used milk, not cream, and tasted great.  Also subbed pecans for walnuts and think I will keep it that way (tho you could probably use about any nut).  I wasn't sure if it would actually cover the bottom of the pan, but JUST made it.  For thicker bottom/more topping, you may want to use a smaller pan.  Everybody LOVED this recipe.

Can I give these more than 5 stars?  I have already made these 3 times.  I have to make double batches because they don't last long!!!  I love Turtle Sundaes, so instead of walnuts, I added pecans.  These are SO good!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are fabulous!  Like others have said - use a smaller pan.  I made them with cashews (instead of walnuts) and peanut butter chips (instead of chocolate).  I like the idea of making the dough with more flour (or less butter) to make it less greasy.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at my brother-in-laws college graduation.  I did use all of the crust for the bottom and ended up making more for the topping.  I used about 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 c.flour, 1/2 c oats and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  I did end up adding more flour to the crust so it was a little more grainy then doughy.  I also ended up cooking it longer then the recipe states as my bottom was thicker. It was very good though.

So unlike everyone else in here,  I made them exactly as written and they were perfect.  No issues with the top crumbling and there was plenty for a 9x13 pan.  They come out thinner but are super gooey.

For those who won't wait until the end for tips:
1. double the crust
2. A little vanilla extract or cinnamon  can make this crust even better
3. I cooked this for about 30 minutes (you can tell how done it is by the brownness of the crust)
4. You can also try adding a layer of melted chocolate before adding the caramel (make sure it cools before)
Anyways this recipe is great! I haven't met a person who doesn't like it. It lasted less than 24 hours in my house and workplace. If you like caramel and oatmeal cookies then you've just met the best duo since PB and J.

Definitely use a smaller pan, like 8x8, otherwise you need to double the recipe. They are sooooo yummy!

Great recipe and the flavor is amazing! They however do not fit in a 9x13 that has to be an error, I tried putting them in a 9x13 and it used all the crust just to cover the bottom so I switched it to 11x7 and still only had about 1/3 of the crust for the top, which was good but 9x13 is WAY TOO BIG!

I knew before these were even done that it would be one of my more successful recipes.  They came together beautifully, smelled heavenly when baking, and were completely obliterated by the recipients.   I followed the tips to double the cookie part but use the same amount of filling. I lightly pressed the top layer into the caramel before baking, just so they wouldn't get crumbly.  Finally, I let them rest overnight before cutting with a pizza wheel, and they were perfect.   I am not always good about remembering to purchase eggs, so I will probably be calling on this recipe a lot!

Very simple to make and tasty. Had to cut my 4 year old off after he scarfed down two pieces. Next time I think I will try to find unwrapped caramels though because unwrapping 32 of them is not much fun!

Since making these yesterday, I've been fighting the urge to devour all of them. This is a fabulous, chewy cookie bar that makes me so, so happy. The only change I made to the recipe was to use Almond milk in place of the heavy cream. I will definitely be making these again and again!

I thought these cookies were just ok.  I made more crumble for the top but they still fell flat.  Not sure what would make them better, it seemed like they should have been good.  Maybe some vanilla or cinnamon?

These are REALLY good. I made them exactly as called for in the recipe only baked them in a 9x9" pan. Cooled them, as suggested, and took them out of the pan to cut into bars. I will definitely make them again. Yum! BTW, my husband is still raving about these bars!

It tasted okay but I would advise adding NO chocolate whatsoever to keep them tasting like caramel. The chocolate sort of dissolved into my caramel layer and didn't taste that great and a bit too sweet. Also, double the rest of the ingredients (other than the caramels and cream), otherwise you will end up with very flat bars (mine were less than a centimeter thick).

Great recipe but really it only makes a 8x8/9x9 pan. I substituted a half cup of Smucker's caramel ice cream topping for the individually wrapped caramels.  This was much easier and already in liquid form. Also added a half cup of shredded coconut for another twist.  Overall, a great recipe to take as is or tweak a little to make your own!

Sorry, I don't like to give a negative review, but I just didn't get this recipe.  The amount of flour and oats for the crust was not nearly enough (split in half) to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan. I had to double that portion of the recipe.  Because of what one reviewer said, I lined the pan with foil thinking it would be easier to remove the bars when done.  It was easy, the problem was the caramel that leaked out the sides stuck to the foil which tore up the edges.  The result was a gooey mess that I felt I couldn't serve to my group.  I won't be making these again.

Oh wow these are good!! I seriously couldn't quit eating these, which means I probably shouldn't make them very often. :-0 I didn't change anything. I probably would add a few more (1/4 - 1/2 cup) walnuts if I made again. YUM. Also, I read some of the reviews that said if you use a 9 x 13 pan, you should double the crust. I don't agree. I put down parchment paper and the crust didn't quite reach the sides when I pressed it on the bottom, but I made it anyway, and the end result was perfect and just the right thickness in my opinion.

This was really good.  I used a 13X9 pan, doubled the crust (using a cup butter), omitted the walnuts and used 1 c. chocolate chips.  Instead of melting caramels, I used my own recipe with ingredients I normally have on hand.  Melt 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. corn syrup over medium heat.  Bring to boil.  While stirring constantly, boil for 3 minutes or until your caramel starts to thicken.  To test, dip a spoon in it.  Let cool.  It should still be a little gooey because you cook it longer in the oven.  The longer it boils, the harder it gets.  Once it gets to the consistency you like, add 1/2 tsp baking soda and boil an additional 30 seconds.  Dump on top of the chocolate/oat mixture.  Yummy!

These bars taste delicious. However thay are very sweet and filling. In my opinion they taste better cold, than straight out of the oven. It was a challenge to press half of the crust into a 9x13 but it made for more bars. Next time I make this I may double the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. I also may put them in a smaller pan for a thicker bar. Tastewise these bars were awesome. They were also very easy to make. It makes a great dessert that everyone will love. It can be made in advance. It doesn't have to be cooked right there. I made this without the walnuts because my brother has a nut allergy and they still tasted fine. Half and half can also be used in place of heavy cream. I will definetly be making these again!!!

WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW YUMMY!!!

I made this for the heck of it two nights ago because it looked so delicious! It is the most amazing thing I have ever had made from scratch and I am making it again tonight for my work! I love this recipe. 

When I put the bars back in the oven for the second time I put it in for about 18 minutes because 12 didn't do enough for me.

These were nice, but they tasted MUCH better the day after making them. After reading other reviews, I tripled the dry mixture, used 32 caramels and extra tbsp. of cream. Used a 9 x 13 pan. Next time I would probably try only doubling the dry stuff.

Way too delicious. I don't dare make them again because I can't control myself!!! :) I doubled the crust recipe and didn't quite double the filling, and used a slightly bigger pan. Seriously delicious.

Great recipe, easy to make. Have made it a couple of times, and everyone loves these bars. I think I may try to double the recipe next time, make a thicker bar.

OH MY! These are to die for...  I mean these are now my FAVORITE desert. I did just what the recipe said, except I forgot whipping cream, so I used milk, and I left out the nuts. These are so good! A HIT!! =]

The only complaint I have, is that they were tough to bite into. I prefer to bite in a soft bar. I baked these, and another on this site for a PTO bake sale. If I had extra ingredients, I would have made the other recipe  instead.

OMG! This bar is amazing.  Anyone remember Carmelita bars @ Starbucks?  I followed suggestions from Chef Joy, March 27, 2008...  Perfect.  I did not add nuts and used Ghirardelli Carmel Sauce, which I already had on hand, and milk chocolate chips.  Oh, I did find that mixing the crust with my hand helped achieve the right consistency.  A real treat with Easter dinner.

These are pretty good.  I did as other reviewers suggested and made it in an 8x8 pan.  This seemed to be just the right size.  I also did pecans instead of walnuts, pressed the top layer of oatmeal in, and microwaved the caramel and cream and it only took a couple of minutes (stirring after each minute).  I used Kraft caramels and they tasted great.  I would go ahead and use the whole bag of caramels next time and drizzle some extra on top of the top layer of oatmeal mixture as I kind of like that chewy burnt caramel part.  I'm not sure if it would work, but I would like to try it.  I waited about 30-45 min then cut so they were mostly cooled but still warm.  The pizza cutter idea worked great, but so did the knife.  I ended up cutting these in pretty small pieces as they seemed fairly rich and since they are kind of crumbly, I thought it would be better to be "pop-in-your-mouth" size to avoid a huge mess (I have kids).

These were very well recieved by my coworkers. I'm not much for carmel and chocolate. I didn't add the chocolate chips and they tasted so good!! I don't see the point of adding chocolate chips, it will take away from the carmel. I didn't have to use foil or anything wither... just spray the glass pan good, and let them cool before messing with them :-)

Delicious! My husband loved these. I also doubled the oat mixture, and used about 2/3 on the bottom, the remainder on the top and pushed in well. I didn't have a problem with them crumbling. Also increased the amount of caramel by about half. Be sure to cut into smaller pieces, these bars are rich! Beware, these are addictive...

DO double the crust, but DO NOT double the butter when making it.  Use 3/4-1 cup of butter.  Like other reviewers I used foil to make removal easier.  These just get better with age- they are much better cooled and last a LONG time.  They are to die for.  I love them.

WOW!!! These are awesome. Made them and took to a Christmas party and they were a huge hit! Followed the advice of others. I doubled the oatmeal mixture, except the butter. I used 1 cup of butter. Did not need to add any extra chocolate, nuts or caramel. When I crumbled the top layer on I gently pressed it into the caramel layer as someone else suggested. I think this was a good idea so the bars held together. With these changes it fit in a 9 x 13 pan perfectly. Also lined the pan with foil which made it super easy to pull them out and cut once cooled completely.  Very yummy & chewy. Can't wait to make again!

I was a little disappointed in these, they fell apart and were a gooey mess.  The taste was good but I don't know if I would try these again.  I do have to say that I had some the next day and they did firm up and taste much better than the night before.  Maybe if I  make these again I will try doubling the crust part and making them earlier in the day to allow them to get a little firmer.

These were really good! I kept going back to the pan to take "just a sliver more"! I followed most of the recommendations of ChefJoy.  Lining th pan with foil saved a lot of clean up!! The caramel would have been cemented to the pan!! I doubled the crust/topping mixture, but not the caramel filling (for which I used one bag of Kraft plus 7 TBSP of cream).  I used a total of 1 cup of butter.  I now notice that others have recommended adding 1/4 milk (or should it be 1/2 cup with the doubled amount of crust?) to replace the decreased butter.  I think I should have done that because it was a little bit on the dry side (but still delicious - I'm just notpicking to perfect the recipe for future reference!).  I omitted the nuts and just eyeballed the amount of choc chips added.  Will be making again!  ETA: Made again, adding 1/2 cup milk to replace the butter I took out.  They turned out very gooey (vs kinda crumbly as the last time).  Both were good, just different.  I think 1/4 cup milk will be how I make in the future to get the best of both worlds.

I've made these before and everyone loves them.  I double the recipe and use a jelly-roll pan.  Also, I omit the walnuts, and sprinkle on ~3/4 cup of mini-m&m's during the last 5 minutes of baking.  It helps to gently push the m&m's in a bit so they stick

OMG!!! Fabuuuulous!
I made them a little thicker by doubling the dry mixture and putting 2/3 of it on the bottom.   I omitted the nuts since my son doesn't like them. He thought this 1st batch tasted just like samoas-the girl scout cookie. With samoas in mind, the next time I made them I sprinkled coconut over the chocolate, before spreading the caramel.
I also increased the flour and oats by a 1/2 cup each since I thought the 1st batch came out too greasy. The cooking time needed to be increased due to the thickness-not sure how much longer,I just kept watching them. WOW! Its our new favorite! Unwrapping the caramels was a little painful, I will try caramel sauce the next time...Thanks so much!

With the suggested changes of reviewers -- double dry ingredients and cut butter down to only 1/2 a cup -- this was absolutely wonderful!! Chewy and rich. Remember to spray foil if lining pan, otherwise caramel will "glue" the bars to the foil. If you only have caramel ice cream topping, you can add a few TBS of flour till it's the thickness of melted caramel squares (about 2 TBS of flour for every 6 ounces sauce -- but varies depending on thickness of topping/ sauce).

This recipe worked great with caramel dip for apples (thinned with some milk).  I made them in cupcake for easier single service.  As suggested by others, I doubled the flour/oat mixture.

These were a huge hit and really easy!  Next time I would consider increasing the oatmeal mixture, just because it's so good!

Updated 12/10/2015: I continue to make these as a quick go-to for pot lucks or company and am always complimented on them.  I haven't changed a thing from the recipe (other than omitting the walnuts).

These are really good and very rich. They really are like eating candy.  Read the reviews and then doubled everything except the caramels (I used 50 caramels), baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on-hand.  Took to church function.  People begged me for the recipe.

I made the following adjustments at the suggestion of some of the other reviewers:  I used an 8.5x11 baking dish, doubled the oatmeal mixture, and used the whole bag of caramels with 7 Tbsp. of heavy cream.  If I could make a suggestion, it would be that when you pour the caramel over the chocolate chips and walnuts, let it sit for a few minutes to harden a bit before putting the rest of the oatmeal mixture on top.  When I put the mixture on top, some of it sunk into the caramel.  They still came out good and my coworkers LOVED them.  I will definitely make them again.  This is a great fall recipe!

The dessert was awesome! My new favorite! But the recipe makes an 8x8 portion, not a 9x13. THANKS!

These are absolutely sinful. I took the advise of others and doubled the crust and they came out perfect. Made them for girl movie night and now I HAVE to make them for every girl night.

Great, easy to prepare and delicious!  I followed a few tips from Chef Joy (thanks!)and used a whole bag of caramels, 7 tbsp of heavy cream, doubled the crust  and used 3/4 of it on the bottom and 1/4 for the top.  I lightly pressed the topping on with the back of the spoon and none of it came of after cooling.  I also baked the crust for 10 minutes and the rest for an additional 25...I also lined my glass pan with foil which made it so easy to remove and cut after they cooled.....This will now be a keeper for the Christmas baking tray!!!

Fantastic! I made this last evening for a baking contest today. I made two batches because I couldn't bake and not leave some home for my husband! Anyway, I prepared the ingredients just as listed, but used an 8x8 pan instead. This made the bars a little thicker, meaning I adjusted the baking time by a few minutes for each of the steps. Everyone who tasted these delicious creations raved about how great they were. They were simple and I had most of the ingredients on hand at home. And...I won second place in the contest! I definitely recommend this recipe!

Made these for after my son's swim meet.  The boys loved them.  However next time they will be served cold, they are delicious but messy when warm at poolside.

This has become one of son's favorite bars. I think it tastes better when you use the Kraft Caramels that need to unwrapped rather than the bag of caramel nuggets that are in the baking aisle.

I am usually not a huge fan of bars like these...but these have changed my mind.  There were very enjoyable.  Once you eat one you are drawn back for more and more.(so that leads me to make them for parties only.hehe..because I think I ate the whole tray in 3 days..SSHHH)  I did double the crust since other reviews stated they didn't have enough..and I would say to make 1 1/2 the crust instead of double would be perfect.  I did find the little caramels in the bag which made that lots easier..and I did add in a handful extra just to make sure they were plenty caramely!  Will be adding these to my X-mas cookie list.

These ended up tasting great!  However, I would highly recommend doubling the crust in order to cover the top fully.  It's also better if they have loads of time to cool...otherwise they will be gooey.  Good, but gooey!

Great bar cookies! I followed the recipe except for using 3/4 of crumb mix for bottom and pressing top layer down slightly with bottom of measuring cup. I love them and can barely stay away from them. I may try pecans some time, to kind of get a turtle taste. I thought the caramel taste was great with just a bit of the chocolate and walnut coming through. By using a 9 x 13, you end up with more cookies to go around and can afford to eat a few more. Thanks!

Wow!!!  Love these!  I have long since sworn off those wrapped caramels for this site's "Chewy Caramel" recipe, which I just happened to have a bunch of in the freezer and they made this recipe absolutely decadent!  Will make again for sure!

I didn't change a thing and this is the BEST recipe! I live at high altitude and still didn't have to do anything different! Well, I used pecans instead of walnuts because our family doesn't like walnuts. I will cherish this recipe!

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe, as they turned out much much too sweet for my tastes (and I have one extreme sweet tooth!).. 
However, this may be down to the fact that I couldn't find any plain caramels in supermarkets here in the UK, so used chocolate-covered caramels instead.  But nonetheless I'd recommend it and maybe even make it again someday.

I made this for a birthday at work. Everyone loved them. Nice and chewy with a good caramel flavor. I did use the package of caramel pellets that Kraft makes. That sure was nice and easy! I used rolled oats, not quick. I think if there's any difference between the two it would be that they're not as refined, resulting in a more full grain texture. Of course I haven't made them with quick oats yet. I could be full of it!!! I also baked mine in a glass pan that I have that measures 8.5 x 11. The end result was a really good bar. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good, very rich.  I did as others suggested and doubled the flour mixture. I also used milk instead of heavy cream which turned out fine and left out the nuts.  I think next time I would do about 3/4 of the flour mixture on the bottom and put the rest on top just to help them stay together better.  I also lined the bottom with parchment paper which definitely helped with getting them out of the pan.  These are definitely a keeper!

Love, love, love these! I too love a thicker bar and took the advice of several others and baked in a glass 8 x 8 pyrex. I ended up baking the bottom layer for 8 min longer than the recipe calls for or until it looked like the layer had set. This allowed the bottom layer to really hold all the rest of the ingredients - yes, I used almost the full amount of walnuts and chocolate chips. yum! Don't make the mistake I almost did and use 1 minute oats. They will not have the wholesome texture that cuts the richness of caramel, chocolate, and walnuts. By the way, they are worth the wait - don't cut them for about 30 min. 
The were fighting over them at work.

These turned out great!  I made the recipe exactly as is - no changes.  They are definitely too soft to cut when warm, so you need to wait until they are cool to make bars.  You can eat them warm with a fork, however!  :)

These are really good.  I used a smaller pan and it turned out great.  I had to wait until it cooled down some to cut the squares.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  At first my husband and I thought they were too sweet.  So, I sliced them all up and sent them to work with him. I tasted them the next morning and they were perfect.  My husband text me from work telling me how all the guys at the fire station thought they were awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this, but I agree with other people who increased the crust (I increased mine by 50%, not doubled). I made them with butterscotch as some people suggested, but I like them with chocolate best. Do use less chocolate chips than suggested, though, if you want the caramel flavor to really shine through.

This recipes needs lots of tweeking. I didn't think it was all that great but would make changes if I made it again. I doubled oatmeal/flour/brown sugar mix as most suggested. I also used butterscotch morsels instead of choc. I would use 1 full cup of morsels and 1 cup nuts and sprinkle coconut on caramel layer.

These were really good, very sweet.  They went over great in holiday tins.  
I used a smaller pan than stated in the recipe because a 9x13 seemed too big.  
I suggest *cutting* the squares when they're warm, but don't try to remove them from the pan until they're cool.  I cut mine then put them in the fridge to help them set.

This is just excellent.  I doubled the oatmeal mixture and it made it ten times better too.  I just don't think there is enough oat mixture in the original recipe.  Enjoy the compliments as they come in though!

Yum!  This was delicious. At a buffet table full of desserts I am proud to say that my plate of goodies emptied first.  I did use the 9x13 dish and they still turned out very chewy.  I just cut the cooking time by 3 minutes to ensure it stayed moist.  I honestly can't imagine using an 8x8 dish because they are very sweet and having a bar that is over an inch thick might be too much for some.  But I suppose you can just cut them smaller.  All in all I highly recommend this recipe for you caramel ooie-gooie lovers.

These bars are really great tasting.  I modified the recipe a bit - doubling the oat mixture as other reviewers suggested.  However, I also reduced the amount of butter by 25% and found that it came out just as good (and still very buttery).  I made the mistake of using wax paper to line my baking dish because I was paranoid that it would stick - well it did - but to the wax paper! The bottom was fine and came away from the paper easily, but the sides stuck to the wax paper and so I had to cut away quite a bit of the edges of the bars.  This was a bummer - but now I know better.  Very tasty and very rich!

These were delicious. I made them in a 13X9 pan and they turned out fine. I cut them into very small squares since they were so rich so the thiness of them worked. If I was going to make larger square, I would have wanted use a 9" square pan to make thicker cookies. You could really vary these by using differnt nuts, different chips, even dried fruit. Nex time I am going to try this with brown sugar splenda

Oh man! Talk about chewy sweet goodness! These caramel bars are awesome! I made mine in an 8x8 baking dish..make sure to grease it well because they're a little tough to get out of the pan. Had to bake it longer since the bars were thicker than they would be in a 9x13, about 10 mins longer for the second session. When I pulled the pan out of the oven it seemed mushy and liquidy and I got nervous! Later that night I tried them and they were too gooey and crumbly but tasted good. After keeping the pan in the fridge overnite..wow..the next day they were more firm, chewy and solid. I would put the pan in the fridge as soon as it's cool to the touch so the bars solidify. Yum! Will use a little less butter next time, but other than that this recipe rocks!

Do not make these if you are addicted to caramel because they are YUMMY, YUMMY GOOD and you won't be able to leave them alone!  I too only used 1/2 cup of butter and made the bars in a 8x8 pan.  This will be something I will make when I want to impress people with my cooking skills (but they won't know how easy they are to make!).  Make sure you cut after they are cooled.

I made this for a Bake-off, and won two prizes -- Best in Class and Best in Show. I added a little extra chocolate, a few more walnuts, and about eight more caramels, and baked it exactly as the recipe describes. It was a real crowd-pleaser.Two sticky thumbs up!

Very rich!  Just a few bites of this will satisfy a sweets craving!  I agree with the other reviews: a smaller pan is ideal(9 by 9 inch).  I will probably make this recipe again, but it will not be a dessert that I make regularly.

I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan.  Next time I think I will just double the oat mixture and see how they turn out.  I cut them warm and they fell apart.  By next morning they had firmed up and you could actually hold one and it keep it's shape.  Very good and rich.  Think I will cut back a little on the chocolate chips and see how they are.  My husband made himself sick on them and he took the rest to work so we wouldn't eat them all day !

These bars are to die for! I doubled the oatmeal mixture, and used 1c of butter. I only had pecans on hand, so I used these instead of the walnuts. Baked in a 9x9 pan.  The bottom took 13min and the top took 18min. Using a pizza cutter to slice the bars was a great suggestion!! Will definitely make these again. I might possibly use more caramel squares (perhaps 45?), but they came out great as is.

This is very very yummo!  I baked it in a 8x8 pan though because there wasn't enough mixture to spread in a 9x13 pan.  Either way.  Let it cool completly before trying.  A put mine in the freezer because I am inpatient.:)

WOW! Couldn't stop eating them.  I highly recommend using a 9x9 pan for this recipe unless you double it.  The cookies are deliciously rich and they can be cut into small squares.  I am making them for thanksgiving!

These were truly awesome...I brought them into work a couple weeks ago and everyone is still talking about them and asking for the recipe.  I added a little more flour & oats to the second half of the dry mixture to make it a little more crumbly for the top, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was ok.  The caramel was a little too runny.  I did double the oat mixture and used a whole bag of Kraft caramels, I also used 1c of mini chocolate chips.

I have to agree with most- this recipe is fantastic!  It was quick and easy.  I didn't find there to be too much butter- but I like buttery treats.  I don't usually melt down caramel, but make my own so it seemed like it took forever to melt them down!  I took a pan to a work picnic and one to school and both pans got rave reviews.

Great caramel bar.  I did reduce the amount of butter to 1/2 cup, and used a little larger pan.  Will not use a larger pan in the future without doubling the recipe.

I brought these to our church picnic, but forgot to get a piece of it my first time around. When I went back, I noticed the pan was empty! So I asked around because I wanted to know how people liked them. I got raving reviews from everybody who had a piece, or two, or three! Looking forward to making some more just for me and my husband!

Followed the recipe almost exactly - skipped the nuts and used a 9x9 pan that I sprayed with non-stick spray 1st - they come out of the pan prety easily, next time I'll double the crumb topping.  I also used dark chocolate - they are really rich.

Fantastic!  I doubled everything and put it in a 9 x 13" pan.  Reducing the butter a bit was not a problem.  They are still rich and delicious.

These were sooo good. We had an event at our store and we got some food trays and I made these. These were by far the most thing gone. We wouldn't have had any left over but we grabbed some for ourselves before they were all gone. Super Yummy!

I listened to the advise of a few of the other posts and these bars turned out wonderfully!  I added another 3/4 cup of oats, reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced the butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick) and added 1/4 cup milk to make up for the difference. This made the batter a nice consistency and allowed me to spread it easily into a 9x9 pie pan (it's all I had available).   Other reviews said the bars were too sweet and I think reducing the sugar helped.  They are still very sweet and decadent! Also, instead of 1/2 cup of chocolate chips I chopped up a 3 oz dark chocolate Scharffen Berger bar.  As others suggested, I refrigerated it first and then cut it into 1 inch cubes too so we can eat a little at a time without feeling too guilty!

Absolutely heavenly!!!! I used an 8x8 pan, and it fit perfectly. I can't imagine this fitting into a 9x13! Thanks for an awesome, sinful, divine recipe!

Others LOVED them, but I just thought they were alright. I didn't have caramels on hand so I made the chewy caramel recipe from this site and doubled this recipe--proportions were right for a 9x13 pan.

What a great recipe!  I did make a recipe and a half of the oatmeal mixture as I like my crust a little thicker, same with the crumpled topping.  The results were wonderful. This is a one of the best caramel bars I have tried.  Thanks!

These are GREEEEAT! Only thing, I left out the nuts, but it didn't phase the taste any. I could make these WAY too often! These are definately not for sharing when they are done! HAHA! I could eat these constantly all day long! But, I know, you must pass on the sweet delights for others to rave upon. Thanks for the recipe.

I hate to go against the grain, but I really didn't think this recipe worked. It could, however, be my fault. I followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the mixture of the oats. I put half on the bottom and half on the top. It just tasted too much like, well, oats! This is the first bar I've made that called for oats, I guess I am just more used to cookie or brownie like desserts. I am going to try these out on people tomorrow, we will see what they think! Thanks anyhow!

These are DELICIOUS!  Make sure you use the right sized pan otherwise the proportions will be off.  (I did that the first time.)  Great for cookie tin gifts.

I added an extra cup of oats as the dough was very very buttery and didn’t seem to be enough to cover the pan. It was plenty sweet enough. I melted the butter in the 9x13 pan while the oven preheated so I wouldn’t need to grease the pan or dirty another dish. It worked really well and the bars did not stick. Also, didn’t have cream so I just used 3 TBSP of milk instead. The bars came out really good!

Very good. I used Trader Joe's salted caramel sauce. I think I will cut the sugar more next time. Also mixed in some almond flour too and a bit extra butter. Used toasted pecans and dark chocolate chips. Yum.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe (except for the chocolate chips, walnuts, and caramel). These bars were pretty good - a little salty for my taste so next time I am going to omit the addition of salt altogether. Not sure if I am going to make them again though.

Fantastic recipe, it's a standard in my holiday baking. Lining the pan with foil definitely makes it easier to release and cut, as others have said. This is truly such an easy yet impressive recipe, thank you!

these are so good, very rich, and easy to make.  However, I used an 8x8 pan and am glad I read the reviews first.  I don't see how the recipe proportions would be sufficient for a 9x13.  You would have to double the recipe.  The most tedious part was unwrapping the caramels. :)  I used a combination of chips including butterscotch.  subbed the walnuts for peanuts.  I liked the addition of the butterscotch flavor as well as the chocolate.  I will make again but as a tip, try to either push the bottom layer up on the sides just a bit so the caramel doesn't hit the sides of the pan.  It didn't stick badly but was a little harder to get out where contact was made.  I cut them when they were slightly warm and they cut nicely.  thanks for the recipe; nice easy one to have in the rotation.

This was fantastic! I needed to make and egg-free, gluten-free dessert, so just substituted King Arthur’s gluten free baking mix for the flour and it was great! I toasted the walnuts and pecans (I used both) and used a few extra nuts and chocolate chips, and it turned out yummy. The whole 8X8 pan disappeared quickly. Will definitely make again!

Great taste but 4 stars for too much butter in crust and doesn't make enough crust for 9x13 pan. Next time I will use a 8x8 pan and cut the butter in half in the crust oat mix. Melted the caramels in the microwave and stirred in milk for ease.

These are one of the cookies I make that people want the recipe.  These are a real crowd pleaser!  I double the recipe and bake in a 13x9 pyrex pan.  I have made these for countless school events and parties.

I doubled the oat mixture and used 40 caramels and 7 tbsp of heavy cream.  Super good and my guests loved it.

Absolutely love the taste but I should have read the reviews about doubling the flour etc., it was hard to thinly spread the bottom layer but they are sooooo yummy.  Next time I will take the advice make them a little thicker.

I finally made these caramel bars. They turned out great. I doubled all ingredients for a 9 x 13 pan. Next time I will change the butter to only 1 cup. 500 grams (18 oz) caramels with 7 tbls  heavy cream (used milk this time was ok so cream will be better). This will be on the Christmas cookie list. So good and so easy

Made these for a potluck and the consensus was: AMAAAAAZING!!! Based on feedback I doubled the crust, for the caramel layer used 50 caramels and 7TB heavy cream.  Nice 9x13 but I might try the recipe as-is in a smaller pan the next time.  Highly recommend!

Had to use steel cut oats as they're all I had, so mine were very crunchy. I made my own caramel sauce, doubled it for a 9x13 pan (lined with foil was a great tip) and used dark chocolate chips. As other reviewers said they're sweet so the dark chocolate was a nice contrast. Rich but very tasty!

I used people's  suggestions and increases the dry ingredients but just did the 1 cup of butter. This was a mistake. It was too crumbly. I ended up pouring more butter and chocolate chips on top of it which worked ok. 4 stars because the original recipe probably would have been great.

Made it twice, it's better with double the amount of crust, but delightful either way. It's worth making the whole recipe just to get to lick the caramel off the spoon while cleaning up!! Yum.

These bars were great.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the flour, sugar, oats, salt and baking soda.  I increased the butter to 1 cup and did not melt the butter completely.  I used the entire bag of caramels and 7 Tablespoons of heavy cream.  Because we have pecan trees I used pecans in place of Walnuts.  I increased the amount of pecans to 3/4 cup and did not increase the chocolate chips.  I lined my baking dish with parchment paper and that works wonderfully!  I baked the crust for 15 min and the after adding the topping baked an additional 10 or 12 min.  They turned out soft, chewy and delicious!  I will definitely make these again!!!

Wonderful recipe!  I just added the rest of the caramels in the bag and increased the cream to 7 T.  The recipe is great as is though - no need to change a thing.  Thanks for sharing it!

I doubled the crust and topping (flour, oats, sugar salt) and used 1 cup of butter.  3/4 of the mixture went for the crust, the rest for the topping.  Cooked for approx. 22 minutes.  Lined the pan with nonstick foil.  Husband didn't realized there was caramel in it, he mostly just tasted the chocolate.  Wonder if one could double the caramel too?  Didn't use nuts cos kiddos don't care for them.

Great recipe with recommended changes from other reviewers.  I doubled the dry ingredients, and used 1 cup of butter.  I also subbed ground Cheerios cereal for the oats and it turned out great.  I put the extra chocolate chips on top.

Delicious. I added 1 and half flour and 2 cups of oats, and more butter too. And it worked. 

I also put melted chocolate over it, made it extra good. And it is tasty with ice cream

Delicious!! I used parchment paper so they wouldn't stick to the pan. I also doubled the flour/oats mixture as suggested by other reviews and I'm glad I did. I only had 1 c of oats so I just doubled the flour and added a little more butter. I also only had whole milk instead of heavy cream, but I just used about 3 tablespoons instead. I made the recipe on a whim knowing I was making several modifications and they turned out AMAZING! My husband can't stop eating them!

I've made the Kraft Caramel Bars version of this recipe on Cooks.com for 5 years and just tried this last night.  Instead of doubling the crust mixture, try dividing the crust mixture into quarters and press 3/4 in a 9x13 pan.  Bake for 10 minutes in 350 degree oven.  Pour caramel mixture over baked crust then sprinkle 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts (not 1/2).  Then sprinkle the remaining 1/4 of crust mixture and gently press into caramel.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Perfection!  Everyone loves these exactly as I have made them.  I get tons of requests to make these around the holidays (saving it just makes them more special).

This is my absolute favorite, hands down.  Found it about a year and a half ago and I make this whenever the mood strikes.  To those who rate it 1 star because it's too sweet and too much butter! come on, it's caramel! what caramel isn't sweet? and as for the butter, you can add as little as 1 stick.  I think it's unfair to rate it a 1 star just because you didn't like it, doesn't mean it's a bad recipe, could just be that you don't like sweet things.  Whoever came up with this recipe, thumbs up all the way!

YES. This is absolutely amazing! I would caution that one review says to triple the oat mixture - THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH. I would encourage you to double the mix, though. I used about 1.5x the butter and it came out a little dryer but is still amazing (and better for you!) My version tastes a little more like graham crackers instead of a brownie. I am thinking maybe incorporating pretzels or apples in the future. Regardless, I have had nothing but rave reviews and will definitely keep making!

These are great! I have been making a similar recipe for years, but mine called for cutting in cold butter (time consuming!)I used the melted butter with the same results. I also doubled the crust ingredients, used 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1 cup of pecans. I use a 12 oz. jar of caramel ice cream topping mixed with 1/4 cup flour. These are always a hit! Especially for those who don't realize how much butter is in them!

Meh...these were just ok. IF (most likely not) I were to ever make these again I would probably omit the chocolate chips. It totally drowned out the caramel flavor

Hi,
This is the "cookie" recipe that my friends and family request the most. It is decadently delicious! I have used this recipe several times. I increased the ingredients by 50% and used an 11 x 7 pan. Also, I do not melt the caramels until I put the crust in the oven the first time because they melt very quickly. If you love caramel, this is it! Laurie G.

I read the reviews about needing more oatmeal mixture for the crust, so I doubled the quantity and then had TOO much.  I agree with those that said you can cut back on the butter however.  Overall, these bars were a huge hit.

This was amazing. I brought it in to the office and even the hardcore picky eaters were crazy about them. I did double the crust, as I like a thicker crust on cookie bars. I'll make this frequently.

Delicious. I doubled the crust ingredients and it made the just enough for an 8x8 dish. I have absolutely now idea how the recipe as written would fit in a 9x13 dish. I've deducted a star for this. Also, make sure to bake the bottom long enough to firm it up. Otherwise the caramel just melts into the bottom and isn't a distinct layer. For easy, neat application of the top layer, let the top crust dough harden in the refrigerator for a few minutes while the bottom bakes. Then you can put the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and roll out like a pie crust.

As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the oat mixture but only used one cup of butter.  Worked out great for a 9 x 13 pan.  I lined it with parchment to make removing/cutting easier.  I also used the caramel bits instead of individualy wrapped candies.  These were delicious and very well-recieved at work!  Delicious!

MAKE IT IN A 8X11 PAN!!!! These are so good, but the 9X13 pan is just too big.  That being said, I made it according to the recipe (only subbing pecans for walnuts - personal preference) and it turned out great.  Super easy too. The one drawback is that they are very fragile and gooey, so I have also modified the recipe in order to add them to my Christmas cookie list.  I took a cookie base (similar to chocolate chip cookies) from another recipe which is baked on a 10X15 cookie sheet, upped the caramels to a whole package (50) and cream to 7 tablespoons and increased the nuts and chocolate chips to 3/4 cup.  The oat mixture was perfect to cover just the top of the large sheet. My sweets eaters (husband and 20 year old son) both said they like it better with the cookie base, but they raved about the original too.  Fantastic both ways.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  Pretty good, but I will make changes next time.  First, more caramel, definitely more caramel!  Second, a thicker oatmeal base.  I will double that part of the recipe.  Third, I was really able to taste the little bit of salt in the recipe.  I haven't seen this complaint in the other reviews, so maybe it is just me.  I seem to be really sensitive to salt when it is in an oatmeal recipe.  All in all, a quick, yummy treat!

It was a hit! Only issue is that there didnt seem to be enough oatmeal/flour mixture to effectively cover the top of the bars. They were still yummy but they probably would have looked better if I could have covered the entire top as opposed to just spotty crumbles. I will use this recipe again!

Love em! Made changes as recommended: cut butter down to 1/2c., and made them in a tin-foiled & sprayed 8x8 pan. They took a few minutes longer to cook than recommended during the second round in the oven... maybe about 15 mins or so, but just keep an eye on them. Amazingly tasty! My tummy is happy, thighs not so much!

Fabulous! I used milk chocolate chips and left out nuts (kids' preference.)  Used about 1/3 more caramels and 7 T of whole milk. Doubled the crust and made ina  9 x 13 pan. Buttery deliciousness!

These are very good, but two things. 1 - there is a lot of crust/topping compared to the other ingredients. The predominant flavors were this and the caramel. The chocolate was less so, and the walnuts were so lost I didn't taste them at all. 2 - the bars were somewhat difficult to remove from the pan. Some of the caramel leaked to the sides, which crusted over hard. I had to use a metal spatula to pry them from the sides and I can only hope to remove the hardened caramel from the sides of the pan after soaking it overnight. Overall, a very good recipe. Will probably make again with some modifications.

Yummy!  I left out the chopped walnuts because my nephew who was visiting is allergic to nuts.  I used an 8x8 pan and increased the cooking time.  If using a 9x13 you would definitely want to double the recipe.  The kids liked helping unwrap all those carmel candies.  The carmel and heavy cream takes a while to melt over low heat so get that started first and then do the rest.   The recipe says to cut into squares while warm, definitely let them cool for a while or they will fall apart.  I stuck mine in the freezer for a short time and that definitely helped.  Great recipe!

Very good.  I made this recipe because I had a half a jar of caramel topping that wasn't going anywhere, so I used 4 oz caramel topping instead of the caramel mixture and they turned out great.  They were a teensy bit thin for my taste, so next time I'll probably use an 8x8 pan.

these are so yummy!!  I made these for a funeral........I was glad it made a 9X13 because I HAD to have a try:)  I followed the recipe exactly but used milk chocolate chips instead of the semisweets.

I took the advice of others and doubled the amount of crust, so it would better fit a 9x13 pan.  Good advice, as if I had half that amt, it would have been too little.  Since I was omitting the chocolate and walnuts due to an allergy, I doubled up on the caramel filling, as well.  Many other reviews said this wasn't necessary, but I figured it was needed since I wasn't adding the other ingredients.  It turned out delicious, but a little too soft and hard to cut into bars, since there was too much caramel.  Next time, I will just double the crust and not the filling.  That being said, I would just like to add that this was INCREDIBLE, and I have already eaten two pieces!  The combination of salty, buttery crust against the sweet and creamy caramel is absolutely delicious.

These are delicious!  I followed previous reviewers' advice and lined my pan with foil sprayed with vegetable oil and doubled the amount of the oat flour mixture-kept the butter and filling amounts the same.  These needed to bake for about 30 minutes total with the changes.  I also waited for them to cool when I cut them which made it easy.  I will definitely make these again!

Excellent. I doubled the crust ingredients and it was fabulous. I also let it cool in the fridge before I cut it. Made it easier for me :)

These bars are delicious, a great caramel treat, although I must admit berry bars are more delicious for me. You can omit nuts and chocolate and they are still very good.

Best of all worlds, sweet, chewy, gooey and a subtle bit if salt...best bars and worth a bit (and it's just a tad bit) of effort.  If you like caramel, chocolate and buttery goodness, this is a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  I follow the recipe exactly, except for one thing - and that is using milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet - just because I prefer the taste of that.  These are so very yummy!

We just made these for our Halloween party and they were a huge hit. Everyone loved them and they were gone in a flash. Really easy to make as well. I highly recommend them. Even good if you add some thinly sliced apples.

These are delicious!! As stated by other members, I did double the crust mixture except for the butter, only used 1 cup. I always line my pan with foil with any bar type cookie. So much easier to cut in smaller squares! And with these, since they are soooo rich, a little goes a long way! I'll be making these VERY often. Thanks!

After doubling the crust mixture, this would be a 5 star. This recipe as is though is only a 4 star. I also used pecans instead of walnuts just because of personal preference. I'm already getting requests to make this one again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Truly delicious, gooey, and great with unsweetened carob chips instead of chocolate (makes it less sweet, too). Happy to have followed the suggestion to increase the flour and oats to 2 cups each. What a thin and soft bottom crust- couldn't imagine how it would hold together on just 1c flour-oats each?? Also, replaced 1/4 c flour with ~3Tb ground flaxseeds for a fiber/nutritional boost, and sprinkled 1/2c coconut over the caramel. Lovely. I AM Grateful.

I made these last night and now half of them are gone!  I used more than half of the oat mixture to cover the bottom of my 13x9 pan and I doubled the chocolate chips, but other than those changes, I made the recipe as written and they turned out really well -- nice and rich and chewy and the perfect consistency.

UPDATE TO BELOW REVIEW:  I made this in a loaf pan last night (standard size).  I then refrigerated overnight.  Much easier to cut and eat and still way delicious.  Would probably be great also nuked for 15 seconds and served with ice cream, but the loaf pan really did it in my opinion.. now, back to my earlier review....In the words of my daughter.. OMG!  much easier and yummier version of a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie with the added yummy caramel.  I did use the advice of other posters: line pan with foil limit butter to 1/2 cup (one stick).  I also substituted cream for the milk suggested (about a tablespoon or so) and cooked in a pie tin.  It is sooooo good.. a keeper!  Thank you for posting this!

This is not bad but nothing really special.  The pan size in the recipe is wrong.  I used a 7 x 11 Pyrex pan.  8x 8 would be fine, too.

Try the original recipe as written first! I used reviewers suggestions the first time and doubled the crust, but after trying again, I really like the original version better!  More gooey and yummy.  I may have mismeasured something in the doubling process, but I will now always try the original recipe, and THEN add suggestions as needed.  The foil in the pan in very helpful. I also used pecans because I like them more than walnuts.

Except for subbing another 1/2c of chocolate chips for the walnuts, I made this exactly as it says. It's only getting 4 stars because, while it's delicious, there was not enough crust for a 13x9 pan, not quite enough caramel, and there probably wouldn't have been enough chocolate (I sort of overdid it on that). The crust was so thin that cutting it at all (much less when warm) seems impossible, and it sort of has to be eaten out of the pan with a spoon--which is fine right now, since it's just for eating at home!

When I make this in the future, I will double the crust portion of the recipe, and perhaps throw a few extra caramels and another T of cream in the pan. Rest assured, it's delicious enough to try again!

These are fabulous! I took others advice and doubled the dry goods (and butter) but I honestly think it just makes too much. These are SO rich, you can cut them into small servings, and so if you are making them just as a treat for your family, you only need to make them in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan and not double anything. On a side note, I used "Nut Topping" from the baking aisle, instead of chopped walnuts because I wanted a little taste of the walnuts, but not have them take over. I also melted the caramels in batches (with the cream) in the microwave.. saves so much time! I will make these again and again!!

These bars were AWESOME!!! I made these for a fundraiser at my office and everyone loved them.  I tweaked the recipe a little by adding a few more chocolate chips and caramel then the recipe called for.  I can't wait to wow others with this recipe.  Thank you!

I thought this was very good. I kept the recipe as is and used an 8x8 pan and cooked it the second time for 15 minutes; however I'd try a little longer the next time, maybe 17 or use a 9x13 pan. It was very tasty. I greased the pan and didn't have any trouble getting the bars out of the dish.

Without the changes I made, it's only a 4, but with some changes it's easily a 5.

-Doubled the oatmeal layer so it's thicker and added 1/4 c milk so it was a touch softer
-Used 50 caramels and an addiional 2T cream
-Used 1/2 c choc chips, 1/2 c butterscotch chips and about 1 c coconut

I also had to bake it longer, but it turned out AMAZING!

Very good bars.  I did use 1.5 dry mixture as others suggested.  Turned out great!  Will make again.

I made these as a snack, for our volunteers for a fundraiser we had this past weekend. Everyone said they were good and didn't have any jump out reactions. I had not tasted them yet and decided I would try one more person before I tried it. I handed one to a lady in our group that is very vocal and would tell me the honest truth. She started saying oh, oh, oh, and then I thought she was gonna throw up....she didn't, she was trying to get outta of her chair!! She ran over to her hubby, said HONEY OH MY GOSH YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS, and he said "NOW That's some good stuff!!!" She said ya know... I don't need that but man that is good!!! So I tried it, wow...it was yummy. I didn't change anything but I think I will add more crust next time! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I brought this to a barbeque and it was gone in minutes.  I couldn't believe how fast it went.  This was real easy to make, the most time consuming part was unwrapping the caramels!!

Delicious! I doubled the oat mixture, and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  The second batch, I used flaked coconut & dried creanberry instead of nut & chocolate chips. They're even gone faster. I used caramel ice cream topping for both of them. Thanks.

Amazing! Delicious! A big hit at a going away party. The only change I would make is using an entire bag of caramels rather than just 32 individuals, but I really like caramel!

OMG!! The best bars i have ever had the pleaser of making. It's a must to double the flour,oats,sugar,baking soda and salt. My 9x13 pan was gone in a few hours. This recipe will keep in my family for a long time!
Thanks for sharing

Followed recipe except for use of a 8X8 and a super small square pyrex.  I'm eating them out of the oven with a spoon.  I have a feeling they will cut best when cooled, not hot.

Very good recipe but very, very sweet!  I took someone's suggestion on using caramel apple dip instead of the caramels/cream and it worked like a charm!

This was wonderful - but I can't imagine how it would work in a 9X13 pan??  

I made it in a 9X9 square pan.  I lined the bottom with parchment paper, and I used almonds because that's what I had on hand, and they came out great!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks :-)

This is SO great! I didn't add chocolate chips, because i didn't want any, and i didn't have any nuts to put in, and this is still amazing! I will have to make it again with some sort of walnut or pecan in it. This will be a regular!

I have now made this several times and get several requests for it!  I did make a couple of changes.  I made it in a smaller pan (9x9 sq)... and I used 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 semi-sweet choco chips.  My husband took them to a potluck and 10 people asked him for the recipe!  It's the #1 request when they begin planning another potluck.

Amazing!  The recipe does need some modifications...  Like others, I doubled the oats/flour/sugar/baking soda and used a 9 x 13 baking dish.  I lined the baking dish with foil and used a pizza cutter to cut into squares.  I also pressed the top layer into the pan instead of crumbling it on top.

OH MY!! I ate the whole pan minus a bar or two!!  I used a cup of chocolate chips instead of any nuts... DELICIOUS! Unfortunately it IS best to wait until the bars cool completely, otherwise, you'll just be eating a warm gooey mass...which is still DELICIOUS! :)

5 stars for the taste.  Yum.  My only complaint was with the directions.  I followed most people who commented to use a smaller pan.  Also, my oven times typically vary from what is written, so I wasn't sure if they were done in the first step.  They turned out, though, so I guess I can't complain too much!

Yum.  Everyone at work loved them.  The first time around I baked them in a 13x9 pan and it turned into goo bars and didn't keep it's shape.  The second time I used an 11x7 pan and it turned out much better.  Both times it tasted sinfully delicious!

These were pretty good, but extremely sweet. Also, I am giving it 4 stars because with some changes it would be better. Next time, I will definitely cut down on the caramels, there was wayyytoo much, and either double the crust or bake it in a smaller dish. In the 9X13, it is impossible to cover the bottom with half of the crust mixture. I had to add more, and so less was available to crumble on top. Also, to minimize cleanup, I lined the panwith aluminum foil, and sprayed it with PAM. If lining with parchmint paper, no need for spray. Flavor was good though, and with the changes, would be perfect!

These bars are a little slice of yummy heaven! They are rich and delicious and could satisfy any sweet tooth.  The crust needs to be doubled for a 9x13, but other than that...perfect.  I tried to use whole milk instead of cream - the caramel was way too thin.  Made for an ooey gooey caramel bar. Next time I'll go for the real stuff!

Really good recipe!  I double the flour/oatmeal mixture and used hazelnut creamer since I didn't have cream on hand.    I sent some to my son at college and the rest of the pan disappeared quite quickly.  I will be making these again!

These are amazing! Five stars for taste and the compliments I received, but four stars for having to alter the recipe. I followed others' examples and doubled the dry mixture. I don't know how it would fit in a 9x13 the way the recipe's written.

I followed the advise of others and doubled the "crust" mixture and baked in a 9"x11" pan.  Yummy!

I followed others advice and doubled the oat part of the recipe. When I put it together I put 2/3 of the oat mixture on the bottom of the pan. I used caramel pieces and chocolate chunks. Then I sprinkled the remaining oat mixture on top. Heavenly! I took it for my son's snack to share at preschool and his teacher asked me for the recipe when I went back to pick him up.

The best caramel bars I've had! Thanks for the tips on making them in an 8x8 pan, it worked out great! They are a little sweet so I cut mine really small, but other than that they are perfect. I'll be keeping this recipe :)

These were absolutely delicious!  A good break from normal cookies and rich, but not too sweet.  I used a little more oatmeal and less butter as other reviews suggested.  I also added some white chocolate chips since I had them on hand.  Would definitely make them again!

Everyone really liked these.  I thought they could have been better without the chocolate.  I was hoping for more of a caramel flavor.  They did taste better the next day.

These were good but I thought they were a bit too dry and crumbly. 
Maybe it needs more butter with the crumb topping. I will try again next time with more.
I used the caramel chips because it is so easy not having to unwrap so many wrappers.

These are fantastic!  I can hardly keep out of these things once they are made.  I get a scoop right after it's come out of the oven and then chill the rest for easier cutting.  Everyone keeps asking me for the recipe!

This recipe is the best!  I doubled the oatmeal mixture and used 2 TBSP of milk chocolate chips to sprinkle over the baked bottom layer. I ran the chips through a small food chopper until they were dust-like and sprinkled that over the bottom layer- a little chocolate taste but didn't overtake the caramel. I sprayed the 9x13 pan with Pam for baking, which has flour in it. I had no problems with sticking.  An easy and great recipe!

I loved this recipe. I do not like nuts so I did not put them in.  I thought it was best a little warm so the carmel was melted a bit.

These were HEAVEN! I did some alterations though. Omitted the chocolate & doubled the crumb mixture, and started with a graham cracker crust along the bottom of my 9x13 pan (pre-baked at 10 minutes before the first crumb layer was added). I replaced the walnuts with chopped almonds, but I would not recommend doing this. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SUBSTITUTE THE NUTS MAKE SURE THEY ARE SOFT. Pecans or something would have worked great but the almonds were too hard of nuts combined with the amount of chewiness in this cookie (rough against my teeth to chew so much!) Still, this recipe is superb!!!

Holy  this was good. I ommited the nuts because I dont like them. Honestly, I think it could have held together a little more (it was tough getting out the induvidual peices) but I just put them in muffin paper tins and served them up. I cant give it less than 5 because it tasted THAT amazing.

This recipe was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I recommend a few adjustments if you are to make this one. If I made these again I would either use an 8X8 pan or I would double the oat mixture.  The 13X9 pan yielded a very thin bar, not at all like the picture.  These are very rich, they remind me a lot of "magic bars."

Incredibly addictive!  I found they were too sweet when I tried them warm.  Once they cooled, I couldn't keep my hands out of the pan!  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  They would make a wonderful Christmas treat.

I made these last night and the flavor is fabulous!!!As other suggested I did double the recipe because all I had was a 9x13 pan. Thanfully I greased my pan as it was extremely difficult to get them out of the pan even waiting until they cooled. The only other trouble I had was getting the caramel to melt. It took them about 45 min.   
But when my extremely picky coworker said they were great I knew it was all worth it!
Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm only giving this a 3 star because mine looks nothing like the pictures. I even used a 7X11 pan instead of 9X12 and it was still really thin, like 1/4inch thick. It also stuck to the pan even though I greased it. From what I did get out of the pan it was ok but maybe if I make this again I will do a double batch and use parchment paper so it doesn't stick. I will also use less chocolate chips as it tasted way to much like chocolate and hardly had any caramel.

I took the advice of M-JVZ to make it in a 9x13 pan and an 8 inch pan.  They turned out perfect!  So delicious, really rich and decadent!  I'm sending a bunch to my husband's office party tomorrow and am quite sure they will disappear really fast!  Will definitely be making these many times to come in the future.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

These were incredible!  I did use the 9 x 9 square pan and they turned out perfect.  Next time I may not put the chocolate chips as it overpowers the taste of the caramel, but still, they were amazing!

A hit with everyone.  However there wasn't enough oatmeal mix for the size of tray so I used all the oatmeal on the base then sprinkled the nuts and chocolate over it, finishing with a layer of caramel.

Made this recipe for a bake sale, cut into 6 large pieces.  It was one of the first things sold.  They were delicious.  I made a 9x13 pan and an 8 x 8 pan, using the suggestion from another to triple the oatmeal mixture, and doubling the caramel mixture.  I think I will try without chocolate chips next time, I tasted more chocolate than I would have liked.  But was still great.
