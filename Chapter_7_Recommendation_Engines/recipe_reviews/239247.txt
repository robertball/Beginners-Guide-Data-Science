DBF loved this one. Had to leave the nuts off his bowl, but was so glad I went to the trouble of toasting some for me! The dressing is AmAzInG. Make this, it's awesome!

Made recipe to the T except used olive as I didn't have corn oil.   We really enjoyed the salad.  The dressing is very good.  I do love sugar coated pecans, so I might do those next time to raise the bar.  I also would add a few fresh raspberries when in season.

This is a wonderful dressing.  A friend just asked me for the recipe.  I use olive oil as corn oil will most likely be made with GMO corn.  Olive works beautifully! Or you could use organic canola.
