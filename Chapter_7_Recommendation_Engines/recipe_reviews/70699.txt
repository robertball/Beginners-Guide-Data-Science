These were great - I didn't pre-boil, just put the rounds in the oven without the toppings for approx. 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Lowered oven temp to the 350 the recipe calls for, added the toppings and finished them.  We all loved them.  I did add a little garlic powder, sliced green onions, and pepper to the rounds.

We love these at my house. I rated them a 4 because they need alittle more spice to make them flavorful. I used 3 baking potatoes sliced. I melted 1 stick of butter and added 1/2 packet of dry ranch, and that makes them phenominal. Dip the potatoes in the butter mixture and throw them in the oven. They are so good and so easy to make. Add your cheese and bacon, I used real bacon bits and sharp cheddar and you have one tasty appetizer or side dish.

Really tasty! Basically like potato skins. I like to cook the potatoes for a bit untopped until they start to get a little brown, then take them out and add the cheese and bacon. Don't forget to garnish with sour cream!

I had to tweak the recipe for flavour.  I tossed the (raw) sliced potatoes into a mix of olive oil, italian seasoning and granulated garlic.  Baked at 420 degrees for about 25 minutes, then dropped the heat to 350 degrees for another 20 minutes.  I added the bacon and cheddar during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Very simple side dish and yummy as well!!!

I dipped the potatoes in a garlic salt/butter mixture, added green onions and more cheese and bacon, topped off with a dollop of sour cream.  Without these additions I think this recipe would have been a little bland and dry.  Nice idea, but I missed the potato skin taste, you just donâ€™t get much of that taste prepared this way.

This was good, but definitely needs a little help.  I brushed the potatoes with garlic butter first.  They needed a lot of salt - I would suggest salting them before you put the bacon and cheese on.  Might also be good with new potatoes.  I was worried that the baking potatoes were going to fall apart, but they didn't.

I love the idea! I can have a "baked potato" without actually eating one! I'm not kiddin, if you can exercise some self control, two or three slices of these, savored, can take the place of the real thing. :o)

10-15-11:  These were pretty good; good enough to refrigerate and reheat for a snack the following day.

LOVED THESE THINGS!!!  They were pretty quick to make.  BEWARE: they're addictive!!!  I drizzled each round with a butter/garlic salt mixture before putting the bacon and cheese on.  They also needed a light salting after coming out of the oven.

This was a quick potato dish that I was looking for.
I will certainly make this again, but will go a little heavier
with the seasonings next time.
This is a keeper!!

This came out so good with a few changes. I melted a stick of butter and mixed half a package of powdered ranch into it. I dipped the potato slices into the mixture, baked it at 400 for 20 minutes then lowered the temp to 300 and added the bacon and cheese to it and cooked until the cheese was all melted. I served each one with a dab of sour cream on top. Soooo good!

Delicious!  I did brush with a little meted butter before the bacon & cheese but that was the only change (besides using real bacon bits to save time). Some reviews said there wasn't enough flavor-I think you need to use a gold or red potato for this recipe.  Russet or bakers would not have enough flavor.  Will definitely make again!!
