Easy to make, smooth and great tasting!  I did not have butter flavored powder so I substitued 1 cube real butter for 1/2 cup of shortening and it worked great.  One handy note: 1 16 oz box of confectioners sugar is equal to 4 cups.

If I had the option of giving a recipe 6 stars, I would do so for this recipe. Very easy, very successful, very nice pure white, lends itself to color additions, sets well. . . Really perfect in every way. Exactly like the frosting on a professionally decorated cake.  This frosting saved a cake made from a mediocre recipe: the cake itself was dry and crumbly, but this frosting made it acceptable for serving. I have been commissioned to make a wedding cake this summer, and I already know I will use this recipe for the frosting. A million thanks, Amy! (By the way, since I had no butter flavoring on hand, I did follow one reviewer's suggestion of replaceing 1/4 cup of the shortening with unsalted butter. Perfect!)

I have been looking and looking for a GREAT White Cake Frosting and this is it. I did not have any powdered butter flavoring and I could not find any at the store so I use butter extract and the frosting was still great. I made the frosting again with butter flavored crisco and it was still great. When using the butter flavored crisco the icing came out a light yellow color which was what I wanted. Thanks Amy for sharing this recipe.

With the exception of the powdered butter flavoring, which I didn't use, this is a fairly standard, basic and reliable buttercream frosting.  Use all shortening, all butter or a mixture of both, depending on your preference.  I didn't need a perfectly white frosting so I used half butter, half shortening, regular vanilla, and enough water for piping consistency.  This falls short of 5-stars in that it should be beaten till very light and fluffy, a good several minutes, not just "until well mixed."  It WILL make a difference.

I made this for my son's birthday cake it it turned out great!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of butter because I didn't have any butter flavoring on hand.  I also used regular vanilla since I didn't have any "clear" vanilla and it still came out fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is everything it says it is; Easy, yummy, and white. I used it on white and chocolate cake. With a little water I was able to smooth it to look like fondant on a 3 tier wedding cake.

Even though I ran out of powdered sugar at the three cup mark, this recipe was still excellent! I think I'll leave it that way for un-fancy icing for my cakes.  I absolutely love it!  So simple, light, fluffy and sooo good!  The only thing that threw me was the "powdered butter flavoring" until I finally figured out that you meant "Butter Buds".  Would rate at 100 stars if I could!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used 1/2 C butter and 1/4 C shortening.  While the consistency was great for icing, I didn't like the flavor.  The different ingredients didn't meld well and the flavor of the powdered sugar was prominant.

Excellent! True professional results, flavors perfectly with extracts, and readily takes icing colors without compromising its body or texture. I have tried many other white cake frosting recipes with hit and miss results. This recipe is consistently the best. Have also tried with 1/4 Cup butter to 1/2 Cup shortening with same outstanding results. Thanks APARSONS!

For those having trouble with the frosting separating: I was told that since Crisco is now trans-fat free it does not mix well with water.  If you are using Crisco you will have to substitute the water with milk.  If you can find a store-brand shortening that has trans fat (not healthy, I know :-) then you can use that shortening with water and it should work fine for you.

This was just way too greasy tasting.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, tasted, and then started the necessary tweaking.  I would start off with only 1/2 cup (or less) shortening and just adding more water when needed.  By the time I got the flavor and texture right, I ended up with tons of frosting.  Do yourself a favor and just start off with much less shortening and taste as you go.

6.6.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7488/white-cake-frosting-i/ ... No, I didn't try it as listed because ... Well, because I'm just like that :D ... I have done the all shortening recipes before & they do the job of staying white, but just don't taste good.  Look pretty, but don't taste very good.  
Soooo, I tried the 1/4c butter, 1/2c shortening combo - & subbed half & half for the water, omitted the butter flavoring.  VERY GOOD job of concealing a chocolate cake, which is hard to do.  Only thing, not even a complaint since I will take blame for adding half & half (think it may have turned into butter with the whipping), is that it wasn't white - just a shade or two under.  Also my shortening wasn't white-white either - used store brand & it works fine just notsowhite.  I wanted white clouds.  
Also something obvious, but not until I got to adding liquid coloring did I think of it - Add less water/half & half/milk when coloring so you won't have to add more confec sugar to be able to pipe it on.  
This is a good tasting frosting that pipes well AND tastes good with subbing butter.

I have to admit as a chef in the industry as a pastry chef and cake decorator I was very impressed with this recipe. Taste very good. I also used butter flavored Crisco and added an extra Tbsp of water to thin out a little more and it spread so easily. Froze cake for half an hour and enrobed it in fondant and decorated it was awesome. Tasted very good. Nice recipe.

I'm an admitted frosting snob and am not a fan of shortening-based frostings. There, now that that's out of the way :) - I used this recipe in a pinch and thought it was a good one. I changed the flavorings and used 1 tsp. clear vanilla, 1 tsp. liquid butter flavoring, and 1/2 tsp. almond; the results were great. I'm looking for a wedding cake frosting, and I found this too soft to get good sharp corners on the cake tiers. It's still a good recipe; just not what I'm looking for.

My husband loves French Vanilla cakes. For his birthday I baked him one and was looking for a quick and easy frosting recipe to go on it.
After looking at the reviews I wasn't too sure about this recipe but decided to give it a go.

I will admit that I made the following changes:
First I replaced all of the shortening with butter and left out the butter granules.
At this point, it was quite tasty but I like a little more creamy flavor so I 
Added 1/2 stick of Philly Cream Cheese and just a pinch of salt with 1/4 tsp of butter flavored extract.
It was a complete hit. My hubby raved about it and my 4 year old grandson gobbled it right up.
I usually scrape the frosting off of my cake but this time I ate it all. Much to the demise of my already expanding waistline.

I was looking for a true white frosting to top my rainbow cupcakes, and this one was perfect.  Because I don't have clear vanilla, I omitted that.  The frosting was perfect for piping on the cupcakes and held its shape nicely.  Thanks!

I didn't have powdered butter flavoring, but I will probably never use that anyway. Instead of 3/4 c shortening, I used 1/2 c shortening and 1/4 butter. I was afraid that the yellow color of the butter would ruin the whiteness of the frosting, but once it was all whipped up it was still perfectly white, and the taste was delicious! We've made it three times in only 2 weeks! Also, very easy to color. We made a red and yellow frosted cake for Disney/Pixar's Cars theme for my son's birthday. Good and firm and perfect for decorating, we used it again to top off cupcakes in ice cream cones (to make look like ice cream) and the frosting held tight, never dripping. Thanks for sharing!

This was great-tasting, with the changes previous reviewers made.  I used 1/2 c. shortening with 1/4 c. butter and omitted the powdered butter flavoring.  Next time I make it, I'll add in some more water or milk to thin it out a little as it was a little too thick to spread on my cupcakes.

I can't give this exact recipe the ratings, but after leaving out the butter powder and substituting it with the real stuff, this buttercream was pretty good.  The texture was light and fluffy and STAYED fluffy, not turning stiff when exposed to the air for a while like buttercream without the crisco added. But in my opinion, there's too much shortening in this recipe.  The icing had a greasy quality.  I made it again using 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco and it was perfect.  You can see how it looked in the photos...(the cake with the Island theme)

I have been looking for a GOOD white frosting recipe, and have tried several.  I tried this one expecting it to be like the rest and was completely blown away!  It's so quick and easy, but PERFECT!  Exactly what I was looking!  Sugar and sweet, perfect consistency.  I blended it for about 5mins, I think those who had consistency problems probably didn't blend it long enough.  I had no problems putting it on cooled AND warm cookies, no melting whatsoever.  It taste very much like that yummy frosting you get at a bakery, I will probably never use another recipe again!

WHY do people insist on rating recipes when they've screwed around with the ingredients & amounts? You can't give this recipe a poor rating when you've substituted half the shortening with butter & then complain about the consistency or greasiness! This recipe is perfect for decorated cakes with a good, traditional birthday cake flavor.

Fabulous and exactly what I was looking for! I, like others, used 1/2 shortening and 1/4 butter. Piped and spread beautifully! This combo was also a beautiful WHITE for my Hellow Kitty Cake. :)

I thought this frosting was terrible.  I made it to decorate my daughter's birthday cake & it was way too runny to use with a decorator bag.  Didn't keep it's shape at all.  Very disappointing.

I agree... this should be called ICING, not frosting. 
I used 1/2 c shortning, and 1/4 c butter instead. Liked the taste ALOT, but the consitancy was WAY TOO THIN. Seemed like it was "melting" off the completly cooled cake. I think the 1/4 water was a bit too much. Totally couldn't decorate the cake with any designs. Did not hold at all! Im going elsewere for frosting recipes. 
If you looking for a simple frosting recipe, just to slab it on a cake, and dont plan on "decorating" the cake, this is it! Otherwise, click the next button and search elsewere.

I was not impressed at all.  I followed the directions exactly and found it to be VERY greasy.  It did turn out a perfect white and was smooth, but other then that, it was not good.  Would be great with butter or even half butter and half shortening, but with all shortening, it was not good.

Great recipe! Thank you very much. Super easy to make and tastes great! I had to double the recipe for a sheet cake I was making, and did not have powdered butter, so I used 1/4 of a stick of room temperature butter as a substitue and it came out fabulous! Not too light...not too sweet, and still very white. It tastes great and will use this recipe all the time now!

A great frosting recipe.  Not only does it look great and taste great, it's a cinch to make.  The texture and consistency is perfect--Firm enough to hold shape, yet fluffy enough to work with ease.  Did I mention it tastes great, too!?  The only problem I had was with my husband who wouldn't stop eating them before the festivities began!  

Just FYI--I was able to moderately decorate 24 cupcakes with this recipe.  

Will definitely use this again and again.

Great and easy recipe. I don't like white frosting but this is the exception. I substituted butter for shortening and it was superb! Can add cocoa or peppermint to make differing frosting varieties.

This isn't the tastiest icing ever, but it will fulfill your white cake frosting needs. I used a stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 1/4 shortening because I didn't have enough shortening on hand. I had a lot left over after Frosting the Frog Cupcakes from this site.

Really wonderful, I made a chocolate version. !/2 c. crisco, 1/4 c. unsalted butter I used my kitchen aid mixer and beat this on med speed for 20 mins, it makes all the difference. I sifted together 4 1/4 c. powder sugar, 1/4 c. dutch cocoa 1/8 tsp salt.  I added this alternately 2 TBS whipping cream, 4 tsp strong brewed coffee, 1 tsp vanilla. Beat this till everything is nice and fluffy (adjust the liquid to your desired consistency) Wow this made enough to frost a two layer cake split into 4 layers just barely, I really wanted another cup. super yummy and sooooo easy. Rave results from your guests and family.

Great frosting thank you. Instead of using 3/4 cup of shortening i used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup of butter instead of butter flavoring. Very tasty.

I used the White Cake Frosting I recipe for my daughters birthday cake. The frosting was perfect consistency to spread, as well as decorate. The taste was no different from any bakery. The recipe called for vanilla extract, but I only had almond. It was a little strong with the after taste. If I have to use almond again, I will use half of what it calls for, but I will make sure next time to try to have vanilla on hand. I also used a stick of salted butter, a 1/4 cup of shortening, and just a pinch of salt, in place of the 3/4 cup of shortening and butter flakes. After reading through just about all the reviews on this recipe, I made sure to mix it for a full 5 minutes. Any negative reviews on this recipe are either taste preference, or user error. It came out beautifully, I couldn't have asked for a better frosting!!

This frosting was a huge hit!  I substituted the shortening with 1 stick of butter and 1/4 c. butter flavored shortening (which kept it from being a pure white color). This was easy to make, easy to spread, was not overpowering in any way.  It was not too sweet and it complimented the cake and did not overpower it.  I frosted the Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake which made a fantastic combination.

This was sooo good! This was my first time making home made frosting and I will never use the store bought kind again. I did change a few tiny things per suggestions of others. I substituted 1/4 cup of the shortening for 1/4 cup butter. I also used almond extract instead of the vanilla. It did yield a lot of frosting and I only used about half of the amount to put on top of a bundt cake. I wanted to just glaze the cake with the frosting, so I took half of the frosting and put in the microwave for about 25 seconds. Once it came out I gave it a quick stir with a fork and then poured it over the top of the cake. It came out beautifully and tasted as good as it looked.

I tried this recipe about 3 years ago and it quickly became my favorite white frosting. I've made it well over a dozen times. The only changes I make are substituting butter for half of the shortening amount and I use real vanilla extract (I never use imitation). I absolutely love this frosting (it's incredible with coconut on it!)

awesome! great consistency, very easy to make and tint! i also used the 1/2 cup of stortening and 1/4 cup of salted butter. (just because i hate the taste of shortening.) no need for the butter buds or dash of salt if you do it that way. way to go amy! thanx for the great recipe. i'll never use store bought again!! :)

YUM!!  This recipe yielded plenty to generously frost an 8"-round layer cake.  I'm not a big fan of shortening aftertaste, so I substituted with 1 stick of butter, (1/2 c.), and only used a 1/4 c. of shortening.  I also opted out on using the butter powder since I didn't have any, and also since I added real butter in the first place.  Instead I used 1/8 tsp. of dried lemon rind just to give the frosting a slight zing.  Really great, really yummy, really easy ... just make it and enjoy!! ;)

WOWEE is all i can say! I went to the store to get the things to make a cake and forgot frosting! It was home made so i thought I would look on here, this site hasnt let me down yet! THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING AND SO EASY!!! I will NEVER buy frosting again. Listen guys, All I did was mix the powdered sugar and used ALL butter! (my shortening smelled funky so i tossed it out..) I used sugar, real butter, real vanilla extract, and the water. It was so good, my husband loved it too. Its easy to spread and tasted amazing. I just let the butter warm at room temp before whipping it with the mixer. thats it! if i could give 6 stars I would!!

I have tried many home made icing recipes and this is the best.  Using butter flavor crisco did give the icing a slight yellow tint, but I was using food dye to color the icing so that did not matter.  This is the best icing recipe, thanks

I used this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake.  AMAZING!!!! Everyone thought that I bought her cake at the bakery.  It was even easy to add color to.  I have tried before to imitate a store bought cake, and this is the only recipe that worked. I bet it would even work great for a wedding cake!

I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup unsalted butter as I did not have any powdered butter.  I did not use the full amount of powdered sugar as it turned pretty thick.  I had to add a little milk just so I could smooth it onto the cake to make it look good.  This was good but not so awesome that I will try it again.

Easy, easy recipe!!!  I do not keep powdered butter flavoring so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup hard shortening.  This will be the frosting I use all the time.  I love it much more than cream cheese, butter or cooked frosting.

This icing worked great for the candy land cake I made for my daughter's 6th birthday party.  I doubled the recipe, but used one less cup of powdered sugar.  I also used 1 c shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  Nice flavor, and stiff enough to decorate with.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

WOW! This recipe for frosting is my favorite. It tastes just like my favorite bakery's frosting, maybe even better. My sister wanted a white cake with white frosting and I am not a cake fan, but I ate all the frosting off my cake! Everone at the party seemed to enjoy it as well. It is very sweet, so if you don't like a sweet frosting, then what is the point of frosting, right?
I LOVE this recipe and I will use it for now on. I am thinking of making cup cakes just so I can lick the frosting off!

This was a great recipe! However, I'm only rating four stars because I made it per other users advice with 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar per batch, and that was plenty. The frosting came out PERFECT for decorating my daughter's birthday cake.

This turned out well.  I'm not into making frosting but hate the premade kind.  This was pretty easy and actually the best spreading frosting I have ever worked with.  I was pretty happy with the end result.  I put extra vanilla in it and this would be great with other flavors.

I'd say it's a good basic white frosting. It didn't ring my bells any, but it will pass. I substituted the 1/2 shortening and 1/4 butter and found the frosting to be to "blah" in flavor, so added 1 more teaspoon of vanilla, which helped it to be a smidge more flavorful. I think it needs some kind of flavoring, but I'm not sure what else to do to it without taking a chance of ruining it, so I think I'll leave it be. It's ok as is.

Didn't have powdered butter flavoring and used butter shortening instead and it turned out fantastic!  I frosted the Heavenly White Cake from this site and it was delicious.  I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla since I like a bit more flavor in addition to the sweetness and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This frosting is incredibly easy to make, colors well, pipes easily, and tastes great! I used Wilton liquid butter flavor instead of powder. I will be making this again (and again, and again).

I omitted the powder butter flavoring because I did not have any. This frosting WAS PERFECT! Fluffy, easy to spread and delicious (had a vanilla flavor to it).  Add some food coloring to be festive. I will be making this again! PERFECT!!!

Absolutely delicious! I also used 1/2 cup crisco and 1/4 cup salted butter. I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract just for my taste preference. I will not buy store frosting again!!

I used this frosting on the Anniversary Cake and it worked beautifully!  I used 1/4c butter and 1/2c crisco shortening and it tasted great.  I skipped the butter flavoring & used real (brown) vanilla extract and it did not discolor the frosting.  Between the layers of my cake I used 2/3c raspberry jam mixed w/ 2t Grand Marnier and it gave the cake some added flavor.  Great frosting recipe - thanks!

Super delicious!  This is my second time in making this frosting and have made a few alterations: omitted the butter flavored powder (didn't have any on hand), substituted milk for water, and used only 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.  This one goes into my book - thank you for sharing!

Learning to make frostings by hand, was blown away by the thought of shortening, but now it makes perfect sense.
Absolutely wonderful, fluffy, gently sweet frosting. Same flavor and texture as u would find in any professionally made cake...
Suggestion double the ingredients, one can never have enough frosting!!!

I'm not a huge frosting fan but I'll eat this frosting all day long.  I couldn't believe how good this tasted...much better than the stuff that comes in the can.  Everybody commented on how good this was.  This was a good consistency for decorating too. I used this for my 3 year olds birthday cake and had no problems.

So good!  Very easy to make and tasted great.  I followed others reviews and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  Also used real vanilla because it was all I had.  Even with the changes it was still white enough to call it white.

I used butter instead of shortening (yep, replaced all the shortening with pure sweet butter).  It was delicious and creamy!  Just call it a "butter cream" icing instead of white.  Easy to make, and easy on the taste buds!

Great!  This tastes terrific and is easy to make.  I used the suggestion of spliting the shortning with 1/2 butter and it was great.  Now I just need to learn those decorating skills!!!

Just like lots of others, I didn't have powdered butter flavoring so I used 1/2 cup shortening & 1/4 cup butter and it turned out great - I got lots of compliments. I did find that I had to mix it by hand at first to incorporate the icing sugar and then use my hand-held mixer to keep the sugar from going all over the place.

Great recipe! Like some other reviewers, I didn't have powdered butter. So I took the shortening down to 1/2 cup and used 1/4 cup softened butter. I also didn't have clear imitation vanilla, and I didn't want to use regular vanilla extract cause I was afraid it would taint the nice white color. Instead I used just 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract (since it's clear) and it turned out AMAZING! The almond flavor was not overpowering and it this frosting went great on both my white and chocolate cake. Thanks!

Definitely use the butter powder or do as other reviewers have said and use some butter in place of some shortening. I didn't have either on hand after making the cake so just omitted it. Just tasted like sweet shortening. Seemed a little greasy to me as well which wouldn't change with the butter powder. Easy though

Delicious and so easy to make.  I didn't use any butter flavoring and it still turned out fantastic!  Highly recommend trying this one.  Also, if you don't have any powdered/confectioners sugar, you can use a blender to grind up regular granulated sugar and turn it into powder sugar.

I used this recipe for an 8-inch, 3-layer white raspberry almond cake. Layers were spread with Smucker's raspberry jam instead of icing. After assembling, I iced the sides then pressed sliced almonds into the icing and piped the top and bottom edges of the cake. It was a perfect amount. My only recipe variation was using 1/4 c. butter and 1/2 c. butter-flavored shortening.

Delicious!  Like so many others, I did not have the powered butter so I followed suggestion to use 1/4 cup of unsalted butter at room temp and only 2/4 cups of shortening. Came out perfect.  This recipe is a total keeper!

Just used this frosting to make Pinkalicious cupcakes- perfect!  It was very easy to use with a large decorator tip to make cupcakes.  I took the great advice and used 1/2 cup shortening, 1/4 butter (instead of butter flavoring.)  Used regular vanilla since I wasn't keeping them white.  I'll be sure to make this one again!  Thanks!

This is a really good frosting and perfect for coloring and decorating.  I used 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla for a different flavor. I also subbed milk for the water. I frosted Grandpops Chocolate cake from this site with it for my daughter's birthday cake.  Yummy!

I love this frosting! I used vanilla extract instead of clear and butter instead of the powdered butter flavouring and it still came out white and yummy! It was so easy to work with and I piped it out onto my son's first birthday cake using the Heavenly White Cake from this site as well. What a fabulous cake this turned out to be!! This is the icing & cake receipe I will be using forever!

This was such a good recipe! I replaced the shortening with butter instead since the shortening would be too powerful, and it tasted great! I used just regular vanilla extract instead since i didnt have imitation handy on me and it tasted just fine! But make sure to mix it at medium speed for around 2-4 minutes so that the butter can melt and if you're worried about the white color, it comes along when you mix the icing for a bit! Other then that, i will definitely use this recipe again in the future

I thought this was an excellent recipe. It turned out perfect on my 1st attempt. Me & my daughter are bigtime frosting lovers and this tasted like it came straight from the baker. Very easy to make and so tasty, we raced out to buy a cheap decorating kit w/ a couple of tips and the kids had a blast trying their hands at decorating. It turned out pure white and was easily dyed w/ a few drops of food color and we made some great creations.

This was a very simple recipe and pretty good.  A little too sweet for my taste (and I have a big sweet tooth)..Didn't use the full amount of sugar either.  As per other reviews - 1/4C shortening and 1/2C butter and was still pure white.  I beat the 2 for a few minutes, prior to adding additional ingredients. Omitted the butter flavoring and added a small amount of milk.  I have never made homemade frosting that spread as well as this one. So easy to frost my cake!! Will definitely keep.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved the texture and the taste of this icing.  I also added a bit of Almond flavoring as well as the vanilla.  This is a perfect icing for decorating or just to frost a cake and it is simple to make.

I made this to cover a birthday cake I was making for my son's first birthday party. I already had some baker's clear liquid butter flavoring in the house so I tried using that instead of the butter flavored flakes, and that was probably a big mistake. It was overpoweringly butter scented, yet still tasted mostly of powdered sugar. The good part was that the frosting spread very well and crusted nicely, so decorating was easy. I think I'll try again, but swap out half the shortening for butter, as other reviewers have suggested. Hopefully that will take care of the flavor while still leaving a good consistency for decorating.

I like my icing only moderately sweet, not super sweet. Because of this, I only use 2.5-3 c. of confectioner's sugar; alternatively, you can use the recommended amount of sugar and keep adding shortening until the icing is palatable. Better than buttercream in a fraction of the time!

Excellent icing, light and fluffy, just like you get in the store bakeries. I used butter flavor extract and regular (not clear) vanilla. I'll definitely use this again!

This was SUPER DRY...I made a 9x13 sheet cake and had to add some milk to the frosting to have enough to cover the cake.  It was overly sweet as well. Not a good recipe.

Excellent, excellent!  Used to make my husband's birthday cake.  Very easy to make.  Followed some reviewers suggestions and cut the shortening in half and substituted an equal amount of butter (dropping the butter flavoring).  Really not that much difference in color.  Frosting was still a brilliant white.  Tasted quite alot like frostings in the tubs sold in the stores.  Used it on the Strawberry Cake from Scratch recipe on here.  Wow, so good together.  Frosting not cloyingly sweet, and heightens the strawberry flavor of the cake.  My husband loved it.  Going in my permanent repertoire.

I was making this at 8:30pm at night and was too tired to run to the store for shortening.  I used all I had on hand which was I can't believe its not butter.  That worked OK.  The frosting was really sweet!! What I really liked was how fluffy it was.

I'm very impressed with this frosting recipe!  I make home-made cinnamon rolls every week for my cafe (Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls by Debbie - excellent!!!) and store them in an unrefrigerated bakery case over the weekend.  I needed a good frosting with no dairy (no spoilage).  This fits the bill!  I use butter-flavored Crisco instead of regular shortening & Butter Buds - I like the flavor better - but then it's a little more yellow.

Made the frosting to go with a cake.  My shortening wasn't totally mixed correctly because it ended up with way too much a shortening taste, blocking out the other flavoring, so I remade it and tasted great.  Very yummy!

Great and simple! I have used this for my last 5 birthday cakes!!! When I don't have butter buds, I just spray 2 or three spritzes of parkay butter spray and it always turns out great. I get lots of compliments every time. Thanks Amy! Roswa

I'm not sure how important the powdered butter flavoring is for this recipe because I didn't have any. I tryed the recipe anyways and found that it was runny and pretty sweet from all the sugar.

I put this frosting with a not so great yellow cake and maybe that was the problem. What ever it was the two didn't mix well.

I made this frosting to use as the creme layer in sandwich cookies - it was awesome!  I will definitely use this the next time I need white frosting...  Delicious!

I made this frosting last night and it came out perfect.  I prefer almond flavoring to vanilla flavoring, so I used almond extract instead.  I also used butter instead of shortening, as some had suggested.  It turned out delicious and with the right consistency.

This has a great consistency for decorating and the texture and appearance also were great. The taste on the other hand was a "WOW" for sweetness.  I guess I was hoping for a frosting that wasn't four times sweeter then the cake itself.

WOW!!!! This is fantastic. I wanted an icing for my son's Elmo birthday cake that would be easy to dye and better tasting than store bought. Everyone thought I bought the cake at a bakery, it was so delicious. I used clear butter flavoring instead of the powder. I also added a small amount of milk because the icing was a bit too thick for the desired consistancy. Thanks for the recipe! The cake was a hit!!!

This frosting is FANTASTIC!  It was simple to make and fast too!  It beat up so smooth and creamy I couldn't believe I made it!!  I didn't have butter flavoring so I substituted 1/3 butter with only 2/3 shortening and it still came out delicious!  It's a dangerous recipe though because I could eat an entire cake with this frosting on it!  Not too sweet either. I received only complements on it and will most definately make it again!  Thanks so much Amy!

This frosting is absolutely excellent!! It is not sickly sweet like other recipes. Plus, the taste is very close to the kind the grocery stores put on their sheet cakes they sell.

Great texture for frosting a cake - very spreadable, good flavor, and you can sweeten it up by adding additional powdered sugar.  I used butter-flavored Crisco because I wasn't obsessed with keeping the icing white-white-white, and it was just fine.  You can also add a little [fill-in-the-blank] extract to give it some kick.  I added about two drops of pumpkin pie spice extract (it's fall!), and it was fantastic.

Very creamy and super easy to make.  Never heard of powdered butter, so did what many suggested and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  Beautiful white color.   Good flavor, but actually a bit too sweet for me,  Can't believe saying that  :o)

I omitted the shortening, salt, and butter flavor powder and used real salted butter instead. I beat the frosting well. It was a very good product, tasted great, looked white, and held its shape. I would make again.

This was great.  I didn't have the powered butter flavoring on hand so I took the suggestion from another reviewer to substitute one stick of butter for 1/2 C shortening.  The flavor was good, but it was too thick so I added milk while mixing to thin it out a bit.  This was for my daughter's birthday party and was a hit with all the children!

I left out the butter powder and salt. I added 3 teaspoons of imitation almond extract and 6 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to decorate a chocolate cake. It turned out quite well and added just enough sweetness. I live in a hot climate, so I have to use shortening based frostings to avoid refrigerating every cake I make.

This recipe was delicious! I added a little more water than it called for because my first batch of icing was a little too stiff for piping. The second batch with more water worked perfect. It tasted great and lots of people that tried it thought it was done professionally. Love it! Will definitely keep this one in my recipe box for future birthdays and special occasions!

I put this on a white cake. It was beautiful. I followed the suggestions for using part shortening, part sugar. Next time I will go w/ 1/2 c butter & 1/4 c shortening; hoping for a better flavor. I did not have the butter buds on hand. That may be the key in the flavor.

I wanted a frosting that tasted like bakery frosting.  This one tasted slightly half sweet and half crisco.  It went on the cake well and didn't "deflate" even though the party was the next day. I think next time I'll just buy a tub of the Betty Crocker frosting from the grocery store.

This is the best home made frosting I have tasted.  I have tried other recipes, but just not the same, perhaps the secret is using the electric mixer for a long time.  The only thing I did different was use 1/4 c butter and 1/2 cup shortening (and omitted the powdered butter flavoring).  I used the electric mixer for 5 mins to get the right consistency.  Taste great on a chocolate cake.

I used butter flavored crisco as some had said.  My husband liked the cake and icing but I did not.  He says it is just me but it didn't taste sweet enought and it tasted a lot like shortening.  I am sure that the problem was with me as the cook or the taster.  I have a tendency to be quite critical of food.

This is almost exactly my mother-in-law's recipe from the bakery.  I finally found a recipe that includes the butter flavor, and not butter!  The butter flavor (and clear vanilla) keeps the icing pure white.  This is perfect, and I'm so glad to have found it!

I think that it was a good recipe but I  would make a few changes.  I think that you should use powdered sugar instead of reagular baking sugar like it says. And I suggest using heavy cream or half and half to make it thicker, but other than that I would make this recipe over and over again!

Really good! Whips up very light.  I cut the butter.  Instead of water, next time I will use milk to make it creamier.

Anytime I see 1 star when others rate the recipe highly, I figure that person must have done something wrong, and I admit, I probably did. This frosting never mixed properly. The fats were always separate from the rest. After I added food coloring it was most apparent because the fat would not accept the color. Perhaps I should have creamed the shortening/butter with the sugar and then added the other ingredients, but it didn't say to do that, so I didn't. I don't think I'll try it again.

I just tried out this recipe and it came out great!  I used regular vanilla, the 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup shortening substitution, and used cream rather than water, and it came out very white, smooth, and creamy.  Tasted great and it was just the right consistancy for spreading.

This was an awesome, easy recipe.  I used it to make many different colors when I made my son a train cake for his birthday.  It was exactly what I needed.  Yummy, light and fluffy, and it took colors well.

This is just like the while frosting from the bakery or grocery store. Does a great job when you are decorating birthday cakes. 

The only recipe that I use!

Great recipe.  I didn't have any powdered butter flavoring so I used 1 TBSP "Buttershot" a liquer from my husband's liquor cabinet.  It was yummy and easy to work with.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was too sweet for me.  I was however impressed how well this frosting held up and it looked really nice on my chocolate cupcakes.  I will still continue to look for a recipe that might be a bit fluffier and not so sweet.  If any one has any suggestions I would love to hear about them.

This is an amazing and simply easy recipe!  I have never made homemade frosting  before trying this recipe. I did not have the butter flavor, so I added a tblsp of butter instead.  I also added a 1/4 cup of milk to make this a little lighter and fluffy!

This is very sweet.  I followed others suggestions and used 1/4 butter and 1/2 shortening and creamed on low for about 5 minutes.  To give a little more flavor added almond extract.

It was fluffy and easy to spread.  I used butter-flavored shortening, which made it an ivory color instead of pure white.

This was a great frosting.  Very easy.  I used the suggestion of substuting some butter for shortening.  It turned out great.  Enough to frost a double layer cake and have enough left over for some decorations.

This frosting is great! I didn't have shortning so I used salted butter instead. I added just a dash of salt because of the salf already in the butter, used regular vanilla extract and didn't use butter flavouring. This frosting tastes way better than the store stuff. Next time I make it I probably will add a touch of lemon juice to give it a lemon flavour, or even maybe orange juice and rind.
