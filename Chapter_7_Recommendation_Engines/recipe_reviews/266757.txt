Excellent dish with great flavor. Mine turned out more like a layered casserole (lasagna) since I didn't cut my zucchini thin enough to wrap but even in casserole form I highly recommend!

This is the perfect way to use up the excess supply of zucchini we get at this time of year.  It very healthy delicious and hubby love it (always a good test).  The only thing I would do differently when I make again is to use the zucchini as a lasagna noodle and not try to roll cause I did have some problems with that.  BUT as I said great new way for me to use zucchini.

I made an enchilada lasagna instead of tolling them up and used thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken. Also found red sauce from Trader Joe’s so I used that. It was super good. I will definitely make again. I made it with some cauliflower Mexican rice. Avocado and sour cream. So freaking good.

This was great! It was a little tough to manage the rolling, as my "thin" setting on my mandolin slicer wasn't quite thin enough. Now I'm tempted to get a vegetable sheet cutter to make these more frequently, LOL!

I followed the recipe exactly, using a vegetable peeler to slice the zucchini very thinly.   These were really good, and I think it made more like 6-8 servings, because I  made 1 small cookie sheet plus another small casserole dish full.   I have almost a whole pan of leftovers.  My only negative comment is that they took me a really long time to roll up into the "enchiladas", and I'm an experienced cook.   I may try just layering them next time into a casserole.  Otherwise, I will certainly make these again, and I'm taking the leftovers to a friend's house this weekend to share.

This was so easy; and so yummy! Not to mention; guilt free!! Slicing the zucchini with the veggie peeler was so much simpler than I ever would have thought! I recommend doing it while they’re whole. The assembly; even simpler!! The zucchini are so much more durable than your standard corn tortilla (the most challenging aspect of traditional enchiladas in my opinion). Followed the recipe verbatim; boiled my chicken to shred it and only used 3 zucchinis with some to spare. Only modification was I added a little salt and pepper to the meat to taste before rolling it up into these yummy enchiladas!! Will definitely make again!! Thanks for posting :)

So healthy and really easy. I threw in some extra tomato, poblano and yellow pepper. Reading the other reviews, I just made a layered zucchini and chicken mix and it was very easy. Tasted fantastic! Will make again. Hubby and I loved it.

I thought it was ok I may make it again and I layered rather than rolled it.
