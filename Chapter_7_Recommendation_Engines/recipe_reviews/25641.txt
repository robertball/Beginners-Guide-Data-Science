i love this recipe! for those of you who have tried it and could not get the tunnel of fudge, i suggest you experiment on the baking temperature and the baking time. the first time i did this, i followed the recipe to the letter. the result was a very small tunnel. the next time i did this, i used a lower temperature for baking and 55 minutes baking time. the tunnel was perfect!

WARNING!!!!   This cake should only be cooked for 45-50 minutes!!! Those are the directions on the Pillbury website and who should know better.  I baked mine for 45 minutes because my cakes are usually done by the lesser time given on any package directions. Everyone loved this cake and I used chopped almonds instead of walnuts.  It looked just like the picture. A toothpick should NOT be inserted into the center and it should NOT come out clean.  It's supposed to be goopy!!!  The Pillsbury website says check it instead by making sure the top is set and that the cake has started pulling away from the edge.  Good Luck! It also says to cool in the pan on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours. Then cool 2 hours before frosting.

Oh Thank You Annie! I used to make this cake back in the 60s but my recipe called for boxed frosting mix. After the introduction of frosting-in-a-tub the boxed mixes disappeared. I made this cake yesterday and it is fabulous. I'd been having a terrible day and I needed an extra chocolate buzz so I doubled your frosting recipe and added 1 tsp of vanilla. OMG! This cake is to die for!!! Thanks again Annie!
******************
TO ISLANDREST: I guess the word fudge is a bit confusing. It's more a 'fudgey-like' layer about 2/3 of the way down inside of the cake. I'm going to make this cake again today!

I made this on Januray 1st:) It was very easy and it looked beautiful when ready. I reduced oven temperature to 300F and time of baking to 50 minutes ( my oven gets really hot!) It came out perfectly. Taste was ok, not great. I think it was too dry, so did my husband. My daughter liked it. I've never had this cake before, so I believe this is how it is suppose to be, as everything worked out fine. I might try it again, maybe increasing the butter a bit? I'll take to the office tomorrow and post my co-workers opinion later. Thanks:)

Ok! I'm back.. I didn't take to the office, and after two days it tasted really good. Me and my daughter kept eating it:) I think it needed time to seat..I'll be doing it again:) Thanks!

FANTASTIC.  Followed the directions exactly, cooked for 45 minutes at 350.  I greased the pan heavily based on other reviewers' comments about it being hard to get out, but I'm wondering if those folks didn't let it cool for an hour and a half like the instructions say.  I did that and it plopped right out clean as a whistle.  I was nervous because I was serving dinner to my husband's friends, but it was a HUGE hit!  The only change I made was to the glaze, because I wanted it creamier.  I added about 2 T. butter and melted in a handful of chocolate chips.  The tunnel was perfect, the consistency was perfect, and I will definitely make it again!

I have this same recipe from a book "Cakes from Scratch in Half the Time" and it bakes at 400 for 35 minutes (using a shiny pan)  It gives a nice tunnel of fudge.  I have never used a glaze, just a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

This is really wonderful!  The prep time is fast, the cooking time is somewhat long, but worth the wait! I didn't have enough icing sugar to make the glaze so I just took a sieve and sprinkled the icing sugar on top and it looked great!  The people at work loved it!

This is a fine recipe!  I followed it exactly, except based on the other reviewers' comments I baked it for only 55 minutes.   The tunnel of fudge was just perfect - soft and buttery and delicious.   I took the cake to a party yesterday where there were both adults and kids.  The adults LOVED the cake, but the kids didn't think it was sweet enough.  I think it would be delicious served with whipped cream!     I would have given this recipe five stars except for the fact that the non-tunnel portion of the cake was somewhat dry.   However, this might be the fault of my oven, and not of the recipe.  The next time I make it I will cut back on the baking time by another five minutes and see if it makes a difference.  Other than that, it's easy to see why this is a prizewinning recipe.

SORRY- I followed this recipe to a T and it was DRY!!!!! It tasted more like chocolate bread with good chocolate frosting. I crumbled it and put it into a trifle. I'll keep looking for a better recipe!

Nope...went in the trash.  Dry, crumbly, no tunnel of fudge.  It looked great out of the oven, came out of the pan like a dream but the party goers were left without dessert...gonna keep looking....

This cake certainly looks beautiful. I made the cake this morning for an Hors D'oeuvre and Dessert party tonight. However, after reading the reviews, I decided I had better try the cake first. I am disappointed in the dry crumbly texture of this cake. There was no tunnel of fudge, only a few moist morsels in the crumbly mess. It tasted quite chocolatey and rich, but I will have to dream up some plan for a presentable serving of this cake.

Did not turn out for me but I still give it 5 stars because the fault is mine. I baked it at 325 for 55 minutes and let it cool 1.5 hours. Did not come out of the pan well, large chunks stuck which had to be scooped out. I used the baking spray, should have used my quick release coating mix. I had my doubts that this would turn out well when I took it out of the oven and it cracked and collapsed in the center. I taste tested an edge which was crunchy and tasted like a brownie edge. I don't know that I will attempt this again. If I do I will try the recipe that uses a cake mix. Most of this will be thrown out I'm sure and that is too wasteful of time and ingredients.

Wish I had read all the reviews first.  I cooked it longer than I should have and didnt get the fudge tunnel I was hoping for.  everyone loved the taste but now I know to only cook for 45 minutes.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and baked it at 325 for 40 minutes, just until the cake pulled away from the sides and looked kinda done on top. I let it cool in the pan a bit, then flipped it over. No icing necessary. Delicious, moist, and a goopy fudge at the bottom. Rave reviews from kids ages 2 to 60!

Delicious, old-fashioned, "clean" flavor -- BUT ... would absolutely not come out of the pan.  I followed the recipe to a T ... but it was glued in place, despite my having appropriately greased and floured the Bundt pan.  It was still quite yummy, scooped into serving dishes ... but alas, it could not be served as a cut cake.  Luckily, I had very gracious (and hungry) dinner guests, who didn't care.  But I was disappointed.  (It was also a little dry, which is why it gets only two out of five stars).

This recipe was okay. My family liked it but I wasn't fond of the uncooked center part. Also, the bundt pan needs to be very well greased. My cake fell apart when I was trying to get it out of the pan and then the inside goo went everywhere. I probably won't make this again.

This is one of my favorite recipes... a little time consuming but worth it! I followed the recipe pretty close, except for the baking time: 55 min, and I used chopped pecans... Soooo good! Oh... I had to add an extra Tbsp of milk for the glaze also...

i actually used the original pillsbury recipe, & it was a big hit. i will put it up as soon as i have more time, but it is very similar to this. they stress that you must use the walnuts & don't skimp(i was going to skip them, glad i didn't), also, just bake until top is set(i went about 55-60, thinking 50-55 should be enough). anyway, there was a tunnel & the cake was a big hit with the 17 year old birthday boy & his dad :)

I made this for my sweetie's B-Day and even though I over cooked it, he loved it! He said it made the perfect brownie cake. I plan to make it again, but bake it about 5 minutes less next time.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I'm going to change the cook time to 50 minutes. At 65 mins. Very little tunnel . I ended up using the recipe from Pillsbury website. Came out just as I remembered. Delicious!!

I made this exactly as stated. It's like an OK brownie with a semi cooked inside. This is the second tunnel of love recipe I've tried. Everybody on this site raves about how all the recipes are absolutely fantastic. They are not. This was edible but not worth making a second time.

I followed the recipe for the cake to the letter but since I'd gotten the recipe from a Bundt pan cookbook I hadn't seen all the reviews prior to making it. I wish I would have known to decrease the baking time because the cake part was really dry-surprising too since had so much butter and eggs in it! I guess I'll try it again baking for 45-50 minutes (I baked it for 58 I think) I allowed the cake to cool for the required time and it came out of the pan beautifully. . I used the recipe for the glaze but found it needed more milk-otherwise didn't run down the cake at all. I ended up almost tripling the glaze recipe since I couldn't get it to cover the whole cake. If...if I make it again I will cook for a shorter time and possibly skip the glaze and just use powdered sugar over the cake. I'm going to pick up some vanilla ice cream to have with the rest of this cake-think it will help with the dryness.

I have been making this recipe for years.

This is not a cake but a nutty brownie with a center of soft flowing chocolate---think of it as a brownie lava cake!

I cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, removing it from the oven just as the cake is starting to pull away from the pan.  The top of the cake is set.

I used Hershey Dark Chocolate cocoa for a richer flavor.  

I frost the cake while it is still somewhat warm, with a chocolate frosting recipe that is on allrecipes. I serve the cake still warm.

If you want a firmer cake, cool as instructed and frost.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. I should have read the reviews beforehand. As directed it was dry and there was no tunnel of fudge. I'll try it again with a lower temp and/or shorter baking time.

Really not hard to make. I used fresh eggs, as I have chickens who blessed me today with a dozen. The fresher egg made for a bit longer beating after each one, but otherwise the cake is simple to make.

This recipe was very disappointing. I baked the cake for approximately 58 minutes and it was dry! Very disappointing, no tunnel of fudge there, It was overbaked by at least 10 minutes, too bad and I'm very sorry that I used this recipe, it was a terrible waste of alot of money on a dry cake. Disappointment!:(

I give this a three star because it tasted amazing but there was no tunnel or difference in texture in the cake. I baked at 310 degrees for an hour... till the cake was set up on top. Well, it sure tasted good but nothing really special about it.

6 whole eggs, 1.75 cups of butter and 4 cups of sugar -- can't be good for you at all. Tasted the batter and it tasted of sugar only with a hint of chocolate in the background. Didn't want to come out of the pan when completed cooking. When flipped onto cake platter, the fudge center oozed all over the place. Believe I'll try the recipe that uses chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding as ingredients for the next attempt at this recipe.

Here's the deal... you definitely have to play with time/temperature based on your own oven.  I have this exact recipe based on measurements and ingredients, but my version said to cook at 350 degrees for 45-50 min and wait a full hour and a half before flipping the pan.  While the flavor of this recipe was amazing (my husband described it as "death by chocolate"), I could not take it to the party like I had planned to because it turned into a puddle of fudge!!!  I think if I would have let it bake the full 50 minutes in my oven it would have been perfect.  I knew I was in trouble when I came into the kitchen to check on the cake as it was cooling, and the cake was cracked and I could see the ooey gooey fudge inside had not set enough.  I prayed that when I flipped  the cake, the cracks would seal and everything would be OK.  Well, when I flipped the cake, the center was definitely not done and what I ended up with was cake around the edges holding a literal pool of fudge.  Yummy mistake for us, but certainly couldn't take it to a party!  My only change was I used pecans rather than walnuts.  Everything else I followed exactly.

This is really a brownie recipe that's not cooked all the way through (tunnel of 'fudge' = raw dough).  Its good, but its main feature is ruined if you bake it too long.

Well, I should have known better than to deviate from my mom's recipe, but I thought I would give this one a try.  Who knows, maybe I did something wrong, but this cake did not turn out like I thought it should.  There was a tunnel of fudge, but the cake fell considerably when cooling and was very splotchy looking.  So the appearance was a negative to me.  Also, the cakey part just wasn't as sweet as I thought it should be.  I know the glaze adds sweetness, but it could have been better.  I probably won't try this recipe again.
