It sounds like it would be too sweet, but in the end it is just perfect.   Great for the upcoming fall and winter seasons, fantastic aromas you can use up to 3 lbs of short ribs, with this recipe.

I would definitely sear the ribs first next time and would also leave the water out of the sauce.  The flavor was really good, but we prefer a thicker sauce.

I bought pork ribs and went to prepare them for the slow cooker in the morning when I realized that I did not have BBQ sauce! I never made BBQ sauce from scratch before so I checked Allrecipes.com like I always do.  I chose this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was VERY good! I doubled the recipe...and I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a little spice with the sweetness. I would do as another poster said and omit the water. It was too liquid for me, I like a thicker sauce. Oh, I also added some honey. Its not too sweet at all. I would actually add more brown sugar next time, and honey, along with the cayenne pepper. This is a great base BBQ sauce to tweak however you like! I also broiled the ribs first like I always do. And I added a large onion to the crock pot. Cooked it on low for 7 hours and it was delish! =)

I was going to give this recipe a 5 star rating but realized that wasn't fair considering I had to make several changes. Like other reviewers I removed the water. I also seasoned the ribs and threw them on the grill to get a nice caramelization on all sides. I like to call this dish my "everything but the kitchen sink ribs." I have done this recipe before and it turned out great! This time I used brown sugar, molasses and honey (since they were all in the cupboard). I added the juice from 1/2 an orange (because it was in the fridge). I used 1 can of tomato paste and 1 can of tomato sauce (I doubled the recipe and didn't have 2 cans of paste). I threw in some garlic and used apple cider vinegar (becuase I think it gives it a better flavor). This recipe is a great base recipe like other reviewers stated. I recommend you get creative and see what you have in your cupboards or fridge and change it up a little. Last time I used wasabi mustard instead of regular and it was delish!

This recipe came out terrific. I seasoned the ribs with salt and pepper then seared them on all sides before adding them to the Slow Cooker. The searing made for a nice, caramelized crust on the outside of the ribs. Cooked these for 7 hours on Low. There was some grease so I simply absorbed it off the top using tongs and a paper towel. Super!

My family loved this.   I did make some changes based on previous reviews:  Seared the beef short ribs in olive oil.  Beer instead of water,   Added:  honey, cayenne pepper, dried onion.    Toward the end, I thickened the sauce with some flour/cornstarch.   Served it on some rice.

This was super easy and super good!  The only change I would make for next time would be to NOT add the water, because it really thins out the sauce.  I took the advice of other reviewers and seared the meat for a few minutes before adding them to the slow cooker.  Also, I would trim the fat beforehand, because it was messy to try and do it afterwards. Yummy, thanks for the recipe!

There was way too much sauce and I even used 3 lbs of ribs instead of 2.  Good flavor, just too much. Also, I don't know if it was just the ribs I got or if all beef ribs are this way, but there was no meat on them!  After they cooked, there was about an inch of fat in a wide six qt. slow cooker and maybe a bite of meat on each rib, if that.  Very disappointing.

I prepared the sauce in a sauce pan before adding it to the ribs. I simmered it a bit to reduce the liquid. I seared the ribs first, then poured about half of the sauce on the ribs in the slow cooker. The rest of the sauce we used for dipping. I actually cooked the ribs on low for over 10 hours. They fell right off the bone and were excellent. The flavor of the sauce on the beef ribs was terrific.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. I eliminate the water and use apple cider vinegar.  I also sear the meat beforehand.  I'm not the best cook but I get this one right every time.

Simple, easy, and tasty. Definitely a winner!  I didn't have an oven to work with where I was cooking so a number of the other slow cooker recipes that required pre-braising and the like didn't work for me.  I made it pretty much exactly as written except for cooking on high for about five hours. Everyone enjoyed it and I'll be adding it to my regular repertoire.

Delicious. Made it 2 days in a row! Yesterday, I pretty much followed the recipe, except I didn't have vinegar so I substituted it with apple juice. Today, instead of 2 lbs. I made 5 lbs. using the same measurements. There was plenty of sauce and the beef ribs were fantastic. My husband, his brother, and mother all loved it!  Thank you!

I’m realistic and realize that slow cooker ribs are not going to be as good as grilled, however these are so easy, tender, moist and tasty, they are very, very  respectable and well worth the effort.  I used bison ribs and it worked out extremely well.  Next time I’ll sear them on the grill before serving just to get a little of that char flavor.

Delicious!! Per others' advice, I seared the beef before hand and omitted the water.  I actually used 4lbs of "short ribs." (from my experience back ribs yields little meat with a lot of fat). I first seasoned the beef with some salt and black pepper. Then I seared it. I used the same amount of sauce and there was still plenty for all the meat.  I did try to remove extra fat from the meat before getting started. Yummy

Awesome! I followed the recipes exactly, except I only added about 1/4 water, bc I like thick sauce. I cooked these on warm for about 10 hours, bc my crockpots low setting stil sometimes gets too hot. Next time I may use pork ribs, bc beef ribs arent my fave- too much fat and hardly any meat. Served over rice with extra sauce, super yummy!

Nice recipe. I gave the short ribs a short roast to brown on the gas grill, because it was a hot day.Used my own BBQ sauce recipe. Then, added to the crock pot. I did more ribs than indicated in the recipe, so it wasn't too much sauce. In my "slow cooker" it took about 1 hour on high and 5 hours on low to achieve tender perfection, without over cooking.

I added half a onion and used apple cider vinegar instead (because thats what I had). Cooked it on high for two hours and then on low for about 4.5 hours. The sauce never thickened, in fact it was more of a liquid. Definitely had a more tomato taste then BBQ. Still good though!

Great beginner recipe. The BBQ sauce can be tweaked in many different ways to suit many different tastes. I added some liquid smoke to mine and it turned out fantastic, even my picky 5 year old loved it and kept telling me how great my dinner was!! However, I like a thick BBQ sauce, so next time I will be leaving out the water or at least cutting it back. I doubled this recipe and made 5 pounds of ribs, there was a ton of leftover sauce, so I kept it to play around with and use on some other meals. Served with baked potatoes, pork and beans, and rolls.

This was delicious! I only did a couple of things different. I used apple cider vinegar because that's what we had, added a little pepper and garlic powder.

This was my first time to cook BBQ ribs. I was looking for an easy recipe to use in my slow cooker and ran across this one. I followed the recipe to see how it would turn out. It turned out to be a breeze to make and tasted terrific. Highly recommend this recipe.

Just made this recipe, and it was superb! Even my finicky husband said it was a "keeper". We had very fatty ribs, so when the meat was ready & cooked, I de-boned and scrapped as much fat off that I could then scooped up the grease. By the time I finished, the sauce had thickened and I served it over rice- yum, yum! Next time I might experiment with reducing the sugar a little, to cut calories. I can see adding pineapple chunks, bell peppers, and even orange to this. Thank you so much for a wonderful BBQ sauce base, just as it is! Love it!

I love the recipe but I added apple cider vinegar instead of whit vinegar. It adds a much needed kick to the sauce. Give it a try. Cheers.

This is a really good method, next time I make this I will be sure not to let the leftovers sit in the sauce.  The taste was too strong, next time I will remove from sauce and place in a separate bowl.

Very tasty!  I made this for dinner today and my whole family loved it! I seared the ribs first but otherwise followed the recipe.   Yes, it is is fatty and I skimmed the fat off but we are using ribs so that's to be expected. The sauce is so good that I will use it as my go to barbeque sauce for other dishes as well.  Thanks fir the recipe.

Recipe was ok. I followed some recommendations in reviews. Leave out the water and sear before putting in slow cooker. Even without the water sauce was a little too watery for my liking.  I also added about 1tsp of cayenne (could've used a little more) to add some spice. I used balsamic vinegar. I didnt season ribs but highly recommend it.  Someone else said it perfectly, " recipe is good base to start from." Will try it again with some additions and see how it comes out.

Not the recipes fault by any means, but bought 1/2 beef & ended up with odds & ends not sure what to do with-aka short ribs. Looked up recipes to make them & this looked pretty good. Would have probably cooked longer to get more tender. Way too much bone, fat, gristle, etc on the meat for our taste. A lot of waste on this cut of meat. Next time I'll tell the butcher to keep or throw away. Like I said, not the recipes fault, but absolutely won't touch again with a ten foot pole.

I made this for a potluck and it was a hit. Even better the longer and slower you cook it- don't be afraid to go up to 12 hours on low heat.

Was it a Grand-slam...almost but not quite!  My wife and I enjoyed it and would probably make again.   I took the advice of others and left OUT the 1 cup of water, which was a wise decision, TY all for that tip. But I am wondering if they would be even better if one substituted the 1 cup of ketchup, with 1 cup of BBQ sauce?  Overall it was very good, but I just wanted them to be a tad better, but I can see why soo many do enjoy them, as everyone's tastes buds are different....We ate all the ribs, so we did not suffer,lol

Delish. I too would omit at least half the water and maybe add some garlic. I used 3/4 Dijon mustard and 1/4 hot English mustard. I might make it half and half next time. Also I'd recommend making it the night before and skimming off the fat the next morning as the ribs are very fatty. I served it with green beans and rice since it needed some vegetables.

I loved the simplicity of the homemade bbq sauce!! I did change the mustard for honey mustard and used beef broth instead of water, instead of regular vinegar i used apple cider vinegar. It was a sweet kind of bbq sauce. Maybe next time some paprika would be so tasty!!!

Delicious. I used a bit over 4 pounds of ribs (8 ribs total). I used red wine vinegar and subbed coconut palm sugar for brown sugar. Delicious even my picky eater liked it!

I just tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out fantastic. I think next time I may cut back on the mustard or use Dijon instead. I am not a huge fan of mustard and you can definitely smell it and taste some of it. There is a touch of bitterness to the BBQ sauce but nothing that would overall ruin the dish. I would definitely make this dish again.

Fantastic--don't look any further for another home barbecue sauce!!! I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 rating because of the modifications I made reading other reviews. I used 1/4 c water (the crock pot generates enough water during the cooking process and it would water down the yummy sauce if more than this amount of water is used), I added 1/4 c onion and 2T honey.  I also seared the ribs first.  It took 7 hours on low to cook and I got raves!!!!!!! It is absolutely delicious.  I used pork and beef ribs.

I also, as others did, omitted the water.  I added half white vinegar and half apple cider vinegar to make 1/2 cup. Made the rest as written, and heated on the stove to melt the brown sugar (it was a rock). I also added some honey, but then it tasted too sweet and ketchuppy, so I added salt, pepper, two capfuls of liquid smoke, and a few shakes of cayenne pepper and smoked paprika.  Perfect.  Oh, and I also browned the ribs first in olive oil after seasoning with salt, pepper, and Montreal steak season.  Yum.

Thanks Sharon! While this is a great recipe as is,  I made a few minor changes that I believe improves on the original. First, I never use the water; it comes out fine without it. Second, add a little Worcestershire sauce, a sprinkle of liquid smoke, and a diced onion. Third, quickly brown the meat  before adding to slow cooker.  Go for the long haul with the slow cooker, 8-10 hrs on low.

I also  smoke a lot of meat and often baste some of what I cook the last hr or so with some of this sauce. I just cook the sauce down  for about half an hr  and it  works great. Sometimes I make it a day in advance. The sauce is good served along side smoked or grilled meat.

Tender as a mother's love! We didn't have 8 hours to wait, so we went 4 hours on High. Perfect over rice, with sauteed green beans on the side. We will definitely make this again.

The only change I made was to drop the ketchup to 3/4 of a cup then add 1/4 cup of Ketchipolte. Then went with Apple cider vinegar. Added a perfect spicy bite.

Simple and delicious! I added a bit more sugar and a little less vinegar because I love a sweet bbq sauce. Serve with rice and its a great meal.
**Best to cook on low, so the beef can fully absorb the ingredients and tenderize properly.

I have no idea where all these other reviewers are coming from.  Have you ever found an old ketchup packet, opened it and the first thing that hits you is that obnoxiously strong vinegar smell?  Yeah.  That's what this is like.  I followed these directions to the letter, and it tasted like warm vinegar and ketchup.  This was no resemblance of BBQ sauce.  Pungent and runny.  Wasted perfectly good  boneless beef ribs.  Just goes to show you, some recipes and reviews just can't be trusted.  I'll definitely find a different recipe next time.

This was very bland. There is no seasoning, basically the only flavor that it had was a ketchup tomato flavor. In no way at all can or should this be called BBQ anything. I tasted the sauce before I started cooking and then tried to season it up to resemble a bbq sauce but it did not help. It was edible but I will not make it again. We were very disappointed.

Absolutely loved this dish. Used a bottle of hard apple cider instead of water and seared the 4 lbs. of beef.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. My husband had seconds and there's enough for leftovers today!

So I did NOT like the sauce. I did as others said and seared the meat and omited the water. The meat was perfect and tender. However, the sauce was awful to me! It tasted like brown sugar and vinegar, which it basically is! Next time I will just use commercial BBQ sauce.

Cooked for the holidays and some serious ribs fans loved them.  Like many other reviewers, I made several changes to the basic sauce.  We like thicker sauce that's more sweet than savory, so I cut down the liquid by over half and used chicken stock instead of water.  Even though I doubled the sauce recipe for about 7 lbs. of ribs, I still used only 1/2-c chicken stock.  Substituted apple cider vinegar for regular and used only 2/3-c for the doubled recipe.  Used 3/4-c brown sugar and added 3/4 -c honey (sounds super sweet, but it wasn't). Other additions (few dashes each to-taste) -- cayenne pepper / garlic powder / onion powder / cinnamon / Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked down the sauce to thicken it and set 1-c aside for dipping before adding the rest to crock pot with ribs.  Finally, I cooked ribs on low for 6 hours, let the pot cool and skimmed off fat before reheating to serve.

OK, it came out great, I would cut water back to 1/2 cup, I also added 1/4 cup Texas Pete hot sauce, 1 TBS liquid smoke, and 4 TBS honey barbecue sauce. I cooked on high in slow cooker 3 1/2 hrs then 3 hrs on low, meat fell right off bones, regular beef ribs (2 Lbs)

I would start the ribs on the fire, then move to the slow cooker.  But I thought the sauce was WAY too sweet. Not a recipe I will do again.

This is great for back ribs but short ribs require much less cooking time so just be aware of that.

Made this with beef short ribs. Too much liquid and too sweet I seasoned the raw ribs with salt, garlic powder and pepper then seared in the broiler until just caramelized before putting them into the slow cooker. To the  pot I reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup, swapped water with 3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar. I added 1 large sliced onion, 2 Tbsp hot sauce and 3 gloves of minced garlic and 2 tsps. of liquid smoke. Let cook for 8 hours and they were delish!

I am a Senior (really senior) woman, and just like good food, but love EASY.  I made the short ribs, followed the recipe,however, put in 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup.  The raves were sensational, just couldn't reveal to my guests how easy it was.  Thank you for sharing...

I loved the flavor and tenderness of the meat.  I was low on ketchup so substituted Webers BBQ Real Molasses sauce for ketchup. I had lots of sauce left over so probably could have added another half pound of ribs.

This recipe is great! The ribs came out so tender. I made a few changes though. I used apple cider vinegar because that's all I had. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I reduced the water a little. I also added 1 onion, 1 apple, some carrot peelings, cayenne pepper, paprika, crushed red pepper, a few cloves of garlic, and veggie seasoning.  I think the sauce was a little sweet for ribs for my families taste, but we ate it the next day  on home fries and it was fine. A few days later we had it on chicken and it was great. I will reduce the sugar more next time to make up for the water reduction. There is a lot of sauce, but that is great because you can freeze it and use it later.

OH MY GOSH... Is all I can say. I generally stay away from crockpot recipes bc they don't always turn out great. This is an exception. Super easy to make and fall off the bone delicious!! I only added 1/4 cup of water bc we leave it in the crockpot for 10+ hours and I didn't want it to dry out. Really really good!!!

Very good!  I omitted the water based on the other reviews.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I used tomato sauce.  The sauce was a little too ketchup-y for me so I added another 1/4 cup of brown sugar and that helped a lot.

I only kept mine on for 7 hours and the ribs are SO dry. 

Taste was good... Will do like another reviewer and set my slow cooker to warm for 10 hours. 

I also only used about 1/4 cup of water and also added some cayenne pepper. Taste was great, but the ribs were so dry, so it kind of ruined the meal for me. 

Will review again when I try it the new way. Thank you for posting the recipe.

Horrible Ketchupque!  We followed this recipe to the letter.  The results were awful.  The odor is nauseating, a miasma of oily meat and Heinz ketchup.  The sauce leaves a sickly-sweet aftertaste that coats the tongue for hours.  The meat was dry and initially shocked the tastebuds with an unpleasant sweetness  that finished with a disagreeable vinegar tang.  Overall, the dish is more like bad Sauerbraten than barbeque.  What a waste of good beef ribs.  We won't be making this one again!

Sharron I'm sorry, but this "bbq" sauce is terrible. I was skeptical about adding the tomato paste, and boy was I right. However the ribs were nice and tender. Will not be using this again.

I like back ribs and normally prefer to do them on the smoker. One day the weather was just too miserable and I started looking for an indoors-type recipe. I came across this recipe and found it different enough from the regular oven/slow cooker recipes that I decided to give it a try, and am really glad I did. This recipe is the closest version to any ribs I do on the smoker. Chef John has some other very good recipes that I use, and he nailed this one right. My only modification is that I use my own rubs that I normally use in the smoker. Stick to the procedure, temps, and times, they’re all good, and you won’t be disappointed.

Good recipe made as written except added liquid smoke. At the end end I put the sauce in a pot and reduced it to a glaze and brushed it in the ribs before serving

I will definitely make this again!  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 2tablespoons  of honey to the bbq sauce.  They came out delicious.  You may want to remove the layer of fat on the inside of your ribs before cooking tho.

We seared the meat and used less beer. Tasted good but still had excess sauce.  We think putting your favorite barbecue sauce in it would be better.  The meat was very tender.  We used bone in ribs.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought the sauce was not good at all.  Not only that but the ribs were drier than expected and I cooked them on low for 7 hours.  Thoroughly cooked but dry.  I definitely will not use this recipe again.

Delicious and definitely a will-make-again recipe. Following advice of other reviewers, I omitted adding water and also used apple cider vinegar rather than white vinegar. I also used about 1/4 cup store bought bbq sauce and 3/4 cup ketchup because I ran out of ketchup, and rough chopped an onion and added. I think next time I will add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add a bit of heat but otherwise loved this!

We never had any success cooking ribs before I found this recipe.  Did it exactly as the recipe called for, except left the slow cooker on high between 6 and 8 hours, depending on the time we got them ready.  We found that by cooking them on high for a longer time, the meat just falls off of the ribs as we take it out of the slow cooker,   So no chewing it off of the bones and not as messy to eat.  They have a great taste.

Very nice recipe! Love the idea of being able to let it cook all day in the slow cooker.  I made a few modifications but basically stuck with the original recipe (without water though). 
Family loved it!

I don’t have a picture of this because it went so fast! My picky eater 6 year old even loved its. Simple and easy to throw together. I used beer instead of water, and actually used Guinness, which was awesome. I’m not sure how the video can feature a rib with meat on it...every rib I pulled out of the crock pot came out without any meat! So tender and good, definitely making this again and soon!

The sauce is really delicious. However I followed the amendments recommended by others. Omit the 1 cup of water. For the 1/2 cup vinegar I used apple cider vinegar. I added a chopped onion (cook until softened in a pan beforehand). I also seared/browned the short ribs in a skillet for a couple minutes each side before adding to the slow cooker. Now, if I was using 3 lbs of short ribs instead of 2, I would add the 1 cup of water. All in all, with amendments this is a great recipe. It can also be served with mashed potatoes for a really hearty meal.

I know how good slow cooker ribs are, they fall of the bone and this is a great for I have dentures. I was interested in the sauce so I tried it with chicken breast and thighs. Chicken also fell off bone and easily pulled out the bones. The chicken and sauce turned great for chicken sandwiches. I like  to follow recipes exactly but some people like to tinker to doctor receipes, and this real good to start,

The only reason is did 4 stars is because I don’t eat Red met anymore (beef) but Hubby loves it so I made it for him. I did have one and I must say it was very good and tender. I didn’t use water though, I substituted a little beef broth I had on hand but stuck with the recipe other than that. It was super easy and dinner was done then I got home from work. Assembled it all the night before and just popped my removable crock into the crockpot.

So, as many reviewers stated, this is a great starter recipe.  I did change it up a bit to suit my own tastes and it came out AMAZING.  Here's what I used:
6 oz. beer
1 cup ketchup
1 can tomato paste
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1-2 Tablespoons honey (I didn't measure)
1-2 Tablespoons mustard (I used up what I had left)
1 shot of bourbon (cuz, why not?)
10 drops mesquite liquid smoke

I added a small bit of kosher salt as I don't really salt things too much.  I put all of this in a saucepan and heated it up and made sure it was all mixed very well.  Took off of the heat after that.  I had 4 pounds of boneless beef ribs and this was still quite a bit of sauce.  They were also quite large so I cut them down into pieces about the width of my hand, seasoned with salt and black pepper and seared them on my griddle for 3 mins per side, depending on size.  The ribs all had a thick slab of fat on one side so I lay them all fat side up in my slow cooker (a new Ninja non-stick one my mother got me) and just poured all the sauce over top of the ribs, making sure that all sides were covered.  Did I mention, this is a lot of sauce??  10 hours slow cook on low and they fell apart when I tried to stick a fork in them.  DELICIOUS.  My first time cooking these boneless ribs in a slow cooker and it'll forever be my go-to method.  Enjoy.

When it was done the meat fell right off the bone so good. The sauce needs a bit of spice for me so next time I will have to adjust.

I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the meat was falling off the bone. The beef and sauce was delicious over white rice. I would have preferred a thicker sauce so maybe next time I'll try something different. You will have to drain the fat off the sauce.

This is darn tasty. I thought it was gong to be sweet,  but it is just right.  I added I dried chipotle pepper  to give it a little kick.

The sauce was very good but, I would recommend trimming excess fat from ribs and removing membrane on the back before cooking.  Other wise you end up excessive fat in sauce.   I will try it with a lean meat cut like London broil and then shred it.

My husband LOVED it.  He didn't think it would be that good because it was made with beef ribs instead of port.  He was pleasantly surprised.  :)

I really was not impressed with this meal. I salted and braised the meat like other reviewers suggested. I skipped the water and added onion, garlic and cayenne to the sauce. In the end it was just okay. I was really looking for something with a little more flavor and we seemed to have more grease then beef. Very disappointed

Made it as is (with pork instead of beef, btw).  Used ~5 pounds of ribs, so I doubled the recipe.  Ended up adding some corn starch (mixed in water, of course) to thicken the sauce.  Was a hit, but I think it can be better.  Will make again and use some cayenne and Frank's hot sauce in the mix.  Also plan to use beer instead of water next time to make it richer.

These were really good. Would have given it a 4.5 star if I could have. Wasn't a "to die for," but was definitely good for crockpot ribs. Made as called for, except I had 6 lbs of ribs and used all of them (some bone-in and some boneless). I did NOT make additional sauce. It gets very thin as it cooks so not very BBQ-y but the ribs were tasty.

I'm a BBQ lover, and I will make this recipe again: the sauce was delicious and the ribs were very tender. Like others, I omitted the water. I'm glad I did because the sauce was barely thick enough for my taste. I did add 1tsp. of Liquid Smoke. Next time, Imight add 2 tsp.

Tasty but that papery quality that slow cookers give meat was a little unpleasant.  I cooked on low for 7 hours, maybe cut this back to 5.5-6 hours next time.  Produced a ton of grease, so be sure to remove the meat from the slow cooker when done.

Just as it is, this has become one of my family's favorites! But next time I will add less water just to get a thicker sauce. But as it is, it is near perfect! Flavor is absolutely delicious!

The sauce was pretty good, the meat, not so good after 8 hours. Some stringy and still a little tuff. Will try it again one more time.

Easy recipe with tasty results. I bought beef back ribs that had been marked down  at Walmart . . .  Decided to give this a try. Only changes were to reduce water to 1/4 cup and to sear ribs in EVOO before adding to crock pot. They cooked while I was at work. My husband and I enjoyed them with noodles.  Not a healthy meal, but a good comfort food for a cool evening. I saved the leftover sauce and will skim the fat off the top before serving with another meal.

This is my 2nd time making it.
I have added: 
1/4 cup of Virgin Olive Oil, 1/2 chopped sweet onion, 1/2 Yellow and Orange Bell Peppers chopped , 1 head of fresh Broccoli sliced, 1 Shallot and garlic chopped, 1 tbsp Sherry, and 2 slices of fresh ginger root chopped. Also added Chipotle Chile seasoning. I switched from sugar to honey, vinegar to Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, and ketchup to low sodium/sugar Hienz Ketchup.

OMG! I have loved beef ribs elsewhere but never made them. This was my first attempt and they turned out so scrumptious!!!  The sauce is absolutely perfect and ribs turned out fall-off-the-bone tender! Delicious delicious delicious!!!  Please try this recipe...you will not be disappointed.

Amazing!!  No oven because we're in the middle of relocating so decided to give this a try. Only change I made was no water, because you don't need it in a slow cooker and these were SO good. Fall off the bone and full of flavour. Thanks for a great first recipe in our new home and one that will be used again and again.

This was incredibly tender and fell right off the bone I did go by other reviewers omitted the water and there was still plenty of juice to it I used apple cider vinegar but it was a little too strong so after it was done in the crock pot I put them on a pan covered in sweet honey BBQ sauce and broiled them for a little crisp OT was delicious these would make great pulled sandwiches definetly will buy buns next time

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and no salt.  I figured the ketchup had enough salt.  Picky son says "you can make this everyday, forever".

Very little experience with beef ribs. Tried once before to do on grill- similar to pork ribs- and didn't care for them.Tried this recipe and loved them. Did not alter at all for first attempt - but next time will 1/2 the water ( think some helps to make meat tender). Also will add a little more spice as we like a little heat and spice. Meat very tender and falling off the bone!!,

These ribs turned out great! The sauce is excellent. I did follow other members advice and sear the meat first and also left out the water because I prefer a thicker sauce.

I was so nervous when i cooked this yesterday. This is the first time i make beef ribs,  I dont have slow cooker and only cooked the meat on stove for 5 hrs.  on top of that,  i was fasting and i didnt know how it taste.  I scaled down the recipe for 2 persons and thank god its turned out great.  Its so easy and i definitely will do this again.  Thank you so much!!

For 3 years we have tried many recipes for ribs, all with mediocre results. Either too dry, no flavour or too tough.
Well all that changed with this recipe. Here are a few changes that we made. Added 1 teaspoon of cayenne, 1/2 cup molasses, 1 teaspoon of chipotle chili pepper and used malt vinegar. 
The end result is ribs that just about fall off the bone!  We then  BBQ'd then at 500 deg. for 2 minutes each side, and served them with a creamy coleslaw, with a drizzle of the sauce over them. Wow finally success!

I made it for the first time and my husband and kids loved it! It was silence at the table (music to my ears because I know everyone was busy eating)!!

Keeping it in the crock pot for 10 hours made the beef so tender that it fell off the bone...just the way I like it!
The only thing I'd change is putting less brown sugar (it was a bit sweet for my taste), otherwise it was a major hit! Thanks!!

This is my first time ever making ribs! The recipe is very easy, but I took other's advice and left out the water... And im glad I did. The sauce came out a nice thick consistency. I did brown the meat for about 20 minutes maybe less (I lost track of time). But cooked them in a crock pot for 6 hours.... Then left it on the rest of the time on warm.... I made these the day before I was serving them... Just because I wanted the meat to absorb the flavor!!!! They came out really really good!!!

I added pepper and garlic powder.  The sauce had a really good flavor, and the meat was really tender. I  cooked it on low for 5 hours.  Definitely will make this again!

Thank you,

These were SOOOOO good!  My husband said they were better than a restaurant.  The sauce is Great! 
I did use baby back pork ribs instead of beef, and I seared them first.   I didn't add the water like many reviews said, but I wish I would have added 1/2 cup.  I'll do that next time.  
I'm making these again this weekend!

These were very good.  I used pork ribs since that was what I had on hand.  I only had 4 hours, so they were not as tender as I like, but I will definitely try them for the full 8 hours next time.  The barbecue sauce was amazing!

Excellent recipe that is a solid starting point for personal alterations for taste and texture. I think the liquid is a little too much water and I took the extra step of broiling the beef on each side for about 7 minutes. Also added a bay leaf to the cooker. The only other addition was to skim off some of the fat towards the end of the cooking process. This will be a keeper in our house!!

Good flavors but deleted the water, used deli mustard along with  1 Tbs. Demitri's bloody Mary seasoning to the sauce to kick it up a notch. It was fantastic with the changes. I took others advice and broiled on high 3-4mins on each side of the ribs before placing in slow cooker for 8 hours.

This was AWESOME!!!  Definitely a keeper!  I was worried that is would be soggy because it was not braised before it went in the crockpot.  When I took it out of the crockpot you would never know it was not braised!  So very good!

I made this the first time as its listed here, and my rating is based on that. Great recipe to use as a base to tweak to your tastes, comes out sweet but not too sweet, a nice balance of flavors. I've come up a few tweaks that make this really good. For one don't add any water. Increase the brown sugar to one cup, and add two tablespoons of honey, comes out perfect this way. I shred the meat after 8 hours and put it back in the sauce for at least another hour and it came out really sweet and delicious. I get a half a beef every year, and with that I get these huge beef back ribs that aren't like your traditional rack of ribs. This recipe works great for them, cooks them through nicely and the meat comes out really moist and tender.

I noticed a review that complained about the fat. That's an issue with your ribs. I made this with bison ribs, which are very low in fat. Having left them in the slow cooker for about thirteen hours on low, I was worried, but the meat was succulent and had literally fallen off the bone.

This is a winner in our house. Followed the recipe to the letter . I did sear the ribs first as suggested by others.

I first seared each rib then slow cooked on high for 3 hours then low for 3 1/2 and finally broiled them for roughly 10 minutes. I also excluded the water. These had rave reviews from everyone...after they started talking again. Around our house dinner time silence = the sign of a great meal!

I followed the receipe  except for not having any tomato paste.  I set the slow cooker timer for 6 hours at low, then had to add 3 more hours to get them to the point the meat would fall off the bone.   Part of the timing problem was the quality of the meat, plus my not having dentures.  I need extra cooking.  Next time out I think I'll toss in a good dose of Jim Beam,  It certainly improves almost any meat dish.

Great recipe.  As others mentioned, reduced the water to a half cup. Seared the beef ribs. I seasoned them with Snyder's Roast Beef seasoning, which is great. 

Also added a pinch of cayenne, as another recommended.

This recipe was perfect. The only things I changed was putting 1/2 cup water as per others recommendations in their reviews and I added a bit more brown sugar. I let the ribs marinate over night before putting them in the slow cooker in the morning. This was a hit with the whole family and made the house smell delicious. It wasn't too sweet or too watery. Will definitely make this again.

Super easy and soooo tasty!  I replaced the mustard with some ground mustard, since that's all I had in the house - about 2 tsps, and cooked mine on high for about 5hours until they were falling apart.  Awesome!

Oops!  I forgot the water and ketchup and it was still wonderful!  Adding water would dilute it too much for my taste!  I've made this several times and it's always fall-off- the bone tender!

It was good but too much sauce I double the recipe for 6lbs of beef instead of 4lbs and thought there was still too much sauce .  Next time I will try 4 lbs for the single recipe.  I also used 1/2 regular ketchup & 1/2 spicy ketchup, and added some ground pepper.  Served it over rice.

I didn't  add the water as we like saucy ribs and these were great! I did have a touch too much sauce left over but I think it will come in handy when warming up the leftovers.

This is a great recipe, lots of flavor in the sauce....but it's too much sauce and I only used a half cup of water. But I also added the honey, cayenne pepper and onion flakes. I also seasoned and seared the beef ribs first.  I also cut up onion and carrots over it and added flour to thicken the sauce the last hour. I slow cooked on high for 4.5 hours and the ribs are VERY tender. I'm serving with homemade mashed potatoes, corn and muffins!! Either use 3 lbs of beef or NO water. It will still be full of sauce!

Definitely making again!! My husband loved itit!! He licked his plate clean that's how much he enjoyed it!  Didn't make a lot of changeschanges, added a few spicesspices; garlic powder, salt,  black pepper and a little bit of crushed red peppers for a kick. I diddidnt add water like some of the comments said (husband likes his sauce thick) I did add a little bit of honey and some baby rays BBQ sauce to give it little smokey taste and let it cook on high for the first few hours then put it on low!! Delicious ??

Definitely didn't taste like bbq to me. It was still good just not what I expected. The cook was perfect though, I couldn't even get the ribs out of the crockpot without the meat falling completely off.

I read the comments of others who have tried it. The water is definitely NOT needed. I seared the ribs slightly in olive oil and also added some minced garlic, a couple dashes of Tabasco and an onion.  Cooked on low for 8 hours. The meat fell off the bone!

This is a very good recipe. Honestly, the only reason I made it was because I had beef ribs in my freezer. I didn't expect to enjoy it at all and it turned out my husband and I both loved it. I also took the advice of others and browned the meat, used only one half of a can of tomato paste, and one sliced onion.  I trimmed as much fat off as I could and you definitely can double the meat there's plenty of sauce.

I braised the ribs, while still on stove top I cooked the tomato paste into the ribs so that the tanginess was more smokey (Chef Ramsey trade secret). Used beer instead of water. Served with mushrooms and cabbage salad to offset the richness of the beef.

I was caught low on ketchup so I had to substitute with a natural BBQ sauce, it was slightly sweet too so it blended in well.  I used apple cider vinegar  and the whole thing turned out perfectly.   It's a special holiday here in Key West so I served this as an after hours treat around 4am and it was devoured.  Really works well with the plain white rice base.

I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and used a spicy deli mustard instead of the prepared mustard. These were amazing!!! So tender and the BBQ sauce was delicious. I thickened it slightly with corn starch before serving

I have made this recipe twice.  Once with beef short ribs and the next time with a beef roast.  It was delicious both times.  I love the flavor of the barbecue sauce it makes.  I wonder if it would be as good with a pork roast?
