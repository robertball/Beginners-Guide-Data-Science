We thought this was amazing!  I am already dreaming of making it again.  The only thing I did differently was I forgot the parmesan cheese & I used chopped up Genoa Salami instead of the pepperoni.  (only because I thought it would be similar & I didn't feel like going back to the store)  I thought this tasted like a silky, pizzaish soup.  DELISH!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have a couple of suggestions for this recipe that I think will be helpful. First of all I was extremely impressed with how much flavor came out of something I put so little effort into. To make things more simple, there is no need to dirty up 3 pots and it can all be done in one. Brown your sausage in your soup pot and then add all other ingredients except the pasta and the parm. Add your pasta to the pot in the last 10-15 minutes cooking time and there you go. One thing I highly recommend is to skip the butter altogether. The sausage and pepperoni yield plenty of grease (almost too much) and the butter is simply not needed. While this is SO simple and effortless for all of the flavor it packs, I think adding some fresh herb such as parsley, basil, oregano, etc. would step the flavor up even that much more. If you were so inclined to chop up some green bell pepper I think that would work nicely too. I used Ditalini pasta because that is what I had but imagine any dry pasta would work just fine. If you like pizza and you like soup that appears you have fussed over it for hours, give this one a try. Thanks for sharing FISHINLYN!
