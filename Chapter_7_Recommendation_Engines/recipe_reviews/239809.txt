Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I intended to buy wonton wrappers, as per the recipe, but the grocery store was out (shocker, lol), so I ended up using mini fillo cups, which worked great! These really do taste like mini BLT's. I could even see just using this as a dip w/ crackers or toasted bread pieces or just on toasted bread for a sandwich. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Doesn't get much easier than this.  I sprayed the mini-muffin tins with cooking oil and decreased the amount of mayonnaise because I did not want the wonton cups to become soggy. Shredded cheese and jalapeno peppers would add a nice kick to these. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Raquel! This was the Buzz Recipe Group Selection for November 1, 2014.

Recipe Group Selection:  01, November 2014 ~ Who doesn't love a BLT?  I made up a small portion to have as a side with our soup and DH gobbled them up.  I then took the leftover shells to school the next day, along with the toppings in one container and the mayo/mustard combo in another container.  At lunchtime, I quickly assembled the ingredients and had a delicious treat for our lunch.  Everyone LOVED them and it was very easy to transport and whip them up in under 10 minutes.  Thanks Raquel, for a fun hors d'oeuvre that was enjoyed by all.

Made for Recipe Group. Easy to make, and can't go wrong with a mini BLT! I just sprayed the pan with Pam. You need to make sure you get the wontons crispy or they will still be chewy. Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic I love these. I used regular sized muffin pan and put three wonton wrappers in each mold. Turned out great

The BLT mix was a good idea, but I had trouble with getting the Wonton wrappers to crisp, per instructions.  I have used wonton wrappers many times for other recipes and found that to crisp them, you have to brush them with oil , both sides and add some cooking time,  or they get chewy, not crisp.  The bubbles on the wontons in the picture, indicates to me that  someone else did the same thing.

These are easy, tasty treats.  I used Old El Paso Mini Soft Tortilla Taco Boats instead of the wonton wrappers, because I couldn't find any at the store.  I've also used small flour tortillas (fajita size), pressed into a muffin tin and baked until crispy.  The taco boats definitely sped up the process and they tasted just fine.  I took these to a football party and they disappeared quickly.

The filling spent a few hours in the fridge before I assembled and served the appetizers. Unfortunately, everything was sort of soggy and limp by then and they were definitely not a hit.
