Quick and easy! This was simple and delicious for a nice weeknight meal. Plus it was a perfect way to use up some leftover pork bbq I had on hand.  I served this with "Mom's Coleslaw" and "Seasoned Potato Fries" from this site.

These are pretty tasty and make a good Super Bowl appetizer. I have to admit though, I am not so sure if I threw this together I would neccessarily call it a printable recipe. It will give me a handy sheet for appetizer ideas, in the future, anyhow. I made a homemade coleslaw on the site. I bought the rolls suggested, instead of making my own which saved a lot of time and I appreciated that. Although, the rolls were super tiny. These are mini sandwiches. I usually make my own pulled pork, in the summer, but being as it is Super Bowl and winter I just bought some plain smoked pulled pork at Costco. I added in some Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce, from a bottle, and it worked fine. It took all of 20 minutes plus the time to cut the mini rolls in half, fill them, and hold them together with a toothpick. They tasted like they were from scratch to me. I liked the warm rolls.
