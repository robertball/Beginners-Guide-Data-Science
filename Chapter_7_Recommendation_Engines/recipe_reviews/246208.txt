Very yummy. Did not measure but I know I used a lot less milk than called for. Will be making again and again with different jams every time!

Although I thought the flavors and the idea of this recipe are wonderful, but there were definitely some issues with mixture.   I made one batch exactly as the recipe stated.  The milk to egg ratio was way off and left me with soggy bread After spreading the cream cheese on the hot french toast it completely slid off and was a big mess.   I made a second batch using the same milk, egg, cinnamon, vanilla listed in the ingredients, but, used four eggs and 1 cup of milk since I was making multiple sandwiches.   I also let the french toast slightly cool before spreading the cream cheese mixture.  I think in future I would spread the cream cheese on the bread and then dip in the egg mixture before cooking.  That way I could serve the french toast hot without the filling running out.   I used orange marmalade and it worked perfect in the cream cheese filling.   I think this is a great recipe idea, just didn't work as is for me.

Very tasty and decadent, all whilst being pretty healthy.  I first had this at an Oregon restaurant called The Original Breakfast Place. I was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe, which is spot-on!

Really good for a quick and easy breakfast! The ingredients given were enough for 1 serving. I had added a dash of icing sugar powder and cinnamon sugar on top of the French toast and it gave it an added taste. Adding fruits on top also complemented the jam inside with the French toast. Would recommend making this again ??

Wow! This was a really impressive breakfast and would be great to serve to guests! I used thick sliced cinnamon raisin bread and raspberry jam. This tasted like a delicious French toast cheesecake!

3.17.16  Waaaaay too much milk.  I just eyeballed the amount of milk (not even close to 1-1/2 cups) and used Egg BeatersÂ® for the egg.  I did 20 seconds in the microwave, and the cream cheese-jam mixture was runny.  I put the cream cheese mixture in the freezer to firm up while the bread was browning which I think kept it from oozing out of the sandwich.  I thought preparation of this recipe could have been better, and my rating is based on the flavor of the french toast sandwich, not on how the recipe is written.

All the ingredients sounded like this was going to be great, but the end result was unappealing.  It calls for way too much milk. I used 1/4 cup, which is plenty. Any more and the bread would have been falling apart and you'd still have leftover mixture.  I microwaved the cream cheese and jam, for only 20 sec, and it bubbled, became runny, and I had little chunks of cream cheese in the jam.  Then when I poured the jam mixture on the French Toast for the last minute, it started to spread everywhere in the pan. I think this would have turned out better if I cooked the French Toast slices first, then spread one side with jam, the other side with cream cheese, and put the two slices together. The recipe is a nice concept. I'd like to try a method that works better for me.

We used Triple Berry Jam and cream cheese.  I really can't consider this a sandwich, but more of a stuffed french toast.  No additional syrup or powdered sugar is needed. Added fresh fruit is great. The milk seems excessive.  We made for 2 people using 2 eggs and enough milk to equal 1 1/2 cups of liquid.  it was plenty.  This is quite easy to make and goes together quickly.

Cream cheese, jam, French toast? All delicious, and just as delicious cooked together! The milk did seem like an excessive amount, so I cut it considerably. Sprinkled it with just a little  powdered sugar and added in some berries and bacon, and you have a gourmet breakfast!

This reminded me of my love for toasted bagels with cream cheese and strawberry jam.  I did enjoy them and wasn't sure that I would. The milk to egg ration was off, too much milk and it won't cook properly. Other than that I would make again.

No changes made and while any jam may be used, to me it makes more sense to just use a strawberry cream cheese spread if you prefer strawberry jam and cream cheese together.

Really, what's not to love?! I did reduce the milk b/c that seemed like a lot to use for only one sandwich, so I only used about 1/2 cup or so (didn't measure). Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fruity on the inside. I served this sprinkled with powdered sugar and thought that was great. I will def be using this simple, yummy recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)
