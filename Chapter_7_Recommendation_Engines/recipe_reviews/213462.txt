This was delicious! Rave reviews from my family! I made a few changes to suit my tastes. 

First, I made it into a marinade in order to grill my steaks.  I know T-bones are tender already, but this made them even better!

For 4 steaks, I added 3/4 cup red wine, 1/4 pomegranate balsamic vinegar. This added a slight fruitiness that was yummy! I'm sure any fruit vinegar would work. I reduced the broth to 2 cups total. In addition to the other ingredients I added a heaping spoonful of garlic. Marinated the steaks for 6 hours or so then grilled.  I also boiled the remaining marinade and added a cornstarch-flour mixture to thicken.

I had some left over t-bone meat, and used this recipe for the sauce.  When I tasted the sauce in the pan, it was a little strong for my taste, but drizzled over the meat, it added some really nice flavor.  Would use again.

This was a very good recipe and very easy to make!  My t-bone may have been a little thicker but it took longer than the time on the recipe to get to medium-rare.  I will definitely make again.

AMAZING dish. It poured on my anniversary and I'd planned to cook my hubby some steaks outdoors, so last mI inute a friend suggested pan-searing it indoors. I've always used a grill for steaks. She pulled up this recipe for me and I twirked it with what I had on hand. Delicious.  I altered the recipe to feed SIX, but didn't have the amount of broth needed. I had maybe 1/2 cup of ham juice (frozen) on hand, so that's what I used. I was really unsure of how this would turn out because ham and steak just doesn't sound like it would mix, but I'm glad I tried it. It's a new family favorite and was SO easy to cook. My t-bones were big and it took them about 10-15 minutes per side to get them medium-well. The 3-4 minutes suggested would have left them rare.

My fiance and I received two steaks from his brothe-in-law and decided tonight that we wanted to make them. So I looked up recipes and this one came up. It sounded good to both of us, so we decided to give it a try. My fiance was adament that he be allowed to make the steaks so I let him. 
Neither of us really cared for the sauce. He didn't like the rosemary and I thought there was too much mustard. So I did some revising to better suit our tastes. After that I thought it was just fine. But all he tasted was the rosemary. So if we make this again we just won't put the rosemary in at all. 
After fixing the sauce, I believe I really would've enjoyed eating this. Except my fiance over-salted the steaks so I couldn't even eat it without the sauce. 
Overall, I didn't find it that great. But if we decided to make this again, I'll definitely be the one cooking it.

This was really tasty. The only thing I'd do different next time is to use a corn starch slurry instead of the flour. I ended up with lumpy sauce due to the flour, and had to pass it through a strainer to get it smooth. Flavor was great though!

Wow this was AMAZING! I hate writing reviews and saying it was great but, I changed stuff. So, I don’t usually write them if I have. However, I think this would’ve turned out fantastic no matter what. The first thing was, I hate rosemary. I try to like it but I can’t get into it. So, I used fresh, minced basil and dry oregano, (would’ve used fresh but my store was sold out). The next thing I did different was my wine sauce also had plum sauce added. This is because I was trying to use up some sauce I made from the night before. Everything else, was followed to a T. I used all the ingredients listed for the sauce and my goodness, it was a hit! I will definitely be making this again!

I've used this recipe many times with dried rosemary and loved the way it turned out.   Today I used fresh rosemary and loved it still.  This is the only recipe I use for pan-fried T-bone steak.  Thanks for the recipe.
