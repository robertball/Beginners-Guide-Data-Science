My mom is moroccan and I always wanted her recipe for what she called her cous cous.  I decided to try this recipe just to see if it would come close.  This recipe is almost exactly her recipe.  I doubled the spices (except the cinamon and salt) and added about 1 tbs of corriander.  I eyeballed the olive oil and I added a bit of beef broth to the mixture near the end because I like my curry more runny.  You wouldn't want to add the broth in the end if you don't.  I sauteed lamb pieces in olive oil and cumin prior to putting in with the veggies.  I served over basic cous cous and it's almost exactly her recipe without taking 2 full days to prepare.  Thank you so much!

I think this is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire existence. I've made it 4 times in the last month! I despise eggplant, so I added an extra sweet potato and an extra zucchini, and it was fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. I do not add salt, and I used canned low-sodium garbanzo beans to cut back on the sodium. My neighbors smelled this cooking from next door, and ended up staying for dinner. The smell is indescribably intoxicating, not to mention the TASTE! This is definitely a keeper. Yes, you will be chopping until your arms want to fall off, but so what? The end result is worth it, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This was a very hearty, colourful curry.  We noticed a few errors in the recipe:  The description says carrot-ginger but nowhwere in the ingredient list does it list ginger.  In the Directions section, the ingredient cayenne is missing - should be added.

This is a very tasty North African dish.  I added a bit more spice and garlic to the the mixture because I don't like bland.  
This was served true Moroccan style over couscous....my husband loved it and said it brought back memories of his time in Casablanca.  If one didn't want the vegetarian and wanted to keep with the Moroccan tradition, lamb cubes could also be added.  I think I will try that next time.

Found this recipe by ingredient searching for something to do with eggplant.  So glad I did.  It was excellent.  I did make a few changes.  Forgot to get a sweet potato, so I used red potatoes.  Doubled curry powder and cinnamon using 1 TBSP sweet curry powder and 1 TBSP spicy.  Lessened salt to 1/2 tsp.  Doubled almonds.  Added 1/4 cup finely diced ginger.  Next time would increase raisins to 1/3 or 1/2 a cup as they provide a pleasing sweet element.  Next, to account for people saying some veggies were too hard while others were overcooked I started my Dutch oven with 3 TBSP oil and the spices.  Next added carrot, onion and potatoes cooked 3-4 min.  Added OJ, raisins, and chickpeas.  Cooked 10 min.  Then added all veggies except spinach.  Cooked 10 min. while I made couscous.  Stirred in spinach and cooked 5 min.  Added 1/2 a lemon juiced at end to brighten as curry powder always has a base flavor to me that needs an acid to contrast with it.  All veggies were perfect and it was delicious.  This way the eggplant sucks up all the good juice and spices rather than just oil.  Added extra 1/2 cup of OJ as it needed more.  Must say spinach was from the farmers market and made a big difference in taste.  Definitely will make again!

Excellent flavours in this recipe, but it needs a little tweaking. I doubled the spices and found it to be quite zingy, however I can't imagine having how mild it would have been with the original amount of spice. This recipe serves 6 as a main course or 8 as a side dish. I used carrot orange juice and grated fresh ginger, which worked well. This is not a pretty dish to look at, but close your eyes and the flavours are beautiful!

great flavor-be careful not to overcook te vegetables. the vegetables are best just a bit crisp. Add spinach just before serving up the dish.

Really flavourful, and easy to make I served over Basmati rice.  I made this exactly according to the recipe except I used carrot juice with some fresh ginger and it was really good.  The almonds are important to the texture, I really reccomend trying this recipe.

Fabulous recipe! I served this curry over Coconut Rice (from this website) and made it for a group.  Raves all around from my young kids, my husband, our friends and even their teenagers.  This is a new favorite--thank you for this recipe!

Fantastic flavor! I juiced the one cup of carrot juice along with about 3" of fresh ginger, which made the dish. I don't care for eggplant or spinach, but didn't notice the eggplant and the spinach was actually delicious! I might double the almonds next time. I learned you can blanch them by boiling about 1/2 cup water in the microwave and then add the almonds. Let rest about 30 seconds and then pop the skins off using a paper towel to squeeze them out. THANK YOU so much!

We loved this recipe.  I added more spices, as we prefer things really spicy, but the basic recipe was easy and delicious.  It really impresses guests, and makes the house smell wonderful.  I also used a white potato instead of sweet, and left out the raisins.

Have made this curry twice now and can strongly recommend it. I find I like it better with double spices except the cinnamon and cayenne, as some others have recommended. When you increase the spice amounts, it produces a curry bursting with flavors and spice. The cinnamon ties the entire dish together. Aside from the spices, I did find that some of the veggies -- the eggplant in particular -- wound up too soft when cooked for the recommended amount of time. But that's a small complaint and overall it's an excellent dish I'll make time and again. Thanks so much!

So yummy! I love the mixed taste of sweet and spicy, and this is a great balance. I'm hot-spice-averse, but it could even use a bit more curry to better cover the veggies. Will definitely be making this one again...

This is a delicious change from my staple recipes. As recommended, I doubled the spices. Next time, I will saute the garlic and spices in the dutch oven, adding the veggies in order of the amount of time it takes them to cook. The carrots were just right but the peppers, eggplant and zucchini were overcooked.

I really liked this recipe, but I think it would have been flavorless if I had not followed other reviewers advice to double the spices (I did not double the salt or cayenne). Even with the extra spices, it was only mildly flavored. I also followed the advice to use only 1 pot, start with the oil and spices (I used on 3T oil), then cook carrot, onions and sweet potato for 4 minutes; add OJ, raisins, and garbanzos and cook for 10 min; add all other vegetables except spinach and cook 10 min; then finally the spinach and cook for 5 minutes more. That way the vegetables do not get overcooked.

You would think from all the reviews calling for added spice, this is a bland recipe. Therefore, I AM REVIEWING THIS RECIPE FOR COOKS LIKE ME WHO LOVE CURRY BUT HAVE A WIMPY PALATE AND PREFER LESS HEAT IN THEIR DISHES.  While I enjoy cuisines that feature spicy foods, I don't like any dish to have too much heat. In restaurants which offer an option about spicing, I am always a 2 or 3. Despite that handicap, I LOVED this curry. It is the first curry I've ever made and it turned out perfectly. I knew enough to cut back on the cayenne pepper (I used 1/4 tsp) and it was still too hot for me. Next time, I will omit it. And there WILL be a next time. WHIMPY EATERS--don't shy away from this recipe: just adjust your spices.

Tasty, but may require more than 20 minutes if you don't chop your sweet potatoes small enough.

This was excellent. Hubby said he'd definitely like this on the menu again. The house smelled SO GOOD for two days after cooking it. (There's something about heating the spices in the oil that really releases flavor and aroma.)

I really liked this and had no idea it would make so much.  I used extra zucchini because my sweet potato was small and I could only get a baby eggplant.  I also used one red and one green pepper (hubby doesn't care much for red pepper).  As suggested by others, I doubled the spices.  It was almost too much for me on the first day, but mellowed and blended the next and was gorgeous.  I used slivered almonds because it's what I had.  Overall I loved it and thought it was a great way to get veg.  I don't usually care for chick peas but they were really nice in this.  My husband wondered where the meat was....  I don't like lamb (which from reviews I gather is traditional), so I may add chicken or beef next time, just to make him happy.

This is an amazing vegetable curry.  My entire family including teenagers adores it.  Just the right blend of hot and sweet.  Freezes very well.  With all the chopping required, I triple it while I'm chopping and freeze it in family sized portions.

Very delicious.  I'm crazy about trying to make things lower in fat so I may try using chicken broth instead of so much oil.  I will also use frozen carrots next time because I had a hard time getting the carrots to cook all the way through.  Some of my other veggies got mushy because of it.

This is one of my favorite dishes to make. It is super healthy and honestly delicious. I like spicey so I always double the spices (except for the curry) remeber to add about 1 tsp. of fresh ginger as it's missing from the ingredient list. I serve it with basmati rice and naan bread. For those who can't have a meal without meat, add a side of chicken tandoori skewers for the perfect dinner!

I used apple cider instead of orange juice because thats what I had. I also didn't have a sweet potato, which I missed. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins again thats just what I had on hand. I like my curry a little on the sweeter side so I added a little brown sugar. I also skipped the spinach. Kale seemed to lend better this version for some reason. It was a fantastic dish. I'll make this again for sure!

WOW. This dish was so delicious I created an account just to review it. Not only is it healthy and filling, but it's also very adaptable; I cooked the garlic in black coffee and added thinly sliced apples to the curry to add flavor, and it came out tasting AMAZING. The sweetness of the curry goes amazingly well with the nuttiness of quinoa, so I've been eating them together so far. :D Yummm~ I thought I wouldn't have enough sauce at first, but once the vegetables simmer for a while, they release juices into the mixture (and they shrink) and you wind up with a perfect level of liquid. :) Next time I would definitely like to add mushrooms, and maybe try the dates (or fish!), but I think it'll taste amazing no matter what you put in it. :D Definitely try this recipe if you like curry!!

I really like the sweet and spicy taste of this dish! I followed the recommendations of other users and doubled the spices and it turned out great. Though, the curry tastes much better the next day after absorbing all the spices.  I also used dry chick peas. I heated the spices in the oil and cooked for 3 minutes. then I added the chickpeas, added enough water to cover them, brought to a boil and then simmered for 1.5 hrs. then I added the sauted veggies in a separate pot and added them after an hour of cooking the chick peas. DON'T add salt, and the orange juice early on to the chickpeas as they will have to cook longer. Wait until the very end to add them. served over bulgur as I had no couscous. Came out great!

I made this with the carrot-ginger juice, and it was very good. With just a few tweaks, it could be 5 stars: omit the eggplant (we didn't think it blended well with the rest of the flavors); increase the spices, or add garam masala (which is what I did after tasting it); add cashews and more raisins. I didn't think the almonds would add much, but they gave the dish a nice texture. A definite keeper! UPDATE: I made this again and roasted the eggplant at 450 for 30 min. before adding it to the pot, and it was MUCH better in both flavor and texture.

This recipe is fantastic!  I just modify to include cauliflower (my favorite). The spices make the cauliflower look a beautiful bright yellow:) I can't wait to serve this to our visitors!

Phenomenal!  This tastes delicious, is fabulously healthy, beautifully colorful, and makes your entire house smile divinely fragrant!  I make it at least once a month.  Plus, it makes enough to feed my family of four for two meals (and the two kids are teenagers with good appetites).

Wow, this has flavor!  I probably ended up with more veggies than the recipe intended so I added another 1/2 portion of the spice mixture.  I used an expensive curry and it added just the right amount of heat. The orange juice is an important part of this so don't skip it! I overcooked it while  trying to insure that the harder veggies were softened. It didn't matter, it's so good!

A lot of flavor for a vegetable curry!  We used orange juice, but I'll definitely try the carrot-ginger if my health food store carries it.  I used frozen peppers, added a few minutes before the spinach, and frozen spinach; both worked well.

I thought this recipe was excellent, and even better the next day! I used carrot ginger juice and I actually used 2 cups instead of 1 cup because I threw in some extra veggies (I added a yellow summer squash, an extra onion, and a couple extra carrots). I did double the spices and it was great, but it's really spicy if you double the cayenne. I'd recommend doubling all the spices except the cayenne. Otherwise it's a great recipe. I served it with quinoa instead of couscous.

A super easy one pot dish to make! I doubled the spices as well and it was very tasty! The flavours are very bold and exotic.  I also agree that over cooking the veggies takes away from the texture - make sure to leave them a little crunchy.

I make this all the time and constantly adapt it to suit what is in my fridge at the time.  I wanted to give out my latest adaptation since, I noticed there is no ginger called for in this recipe when it would really work.  So I tried adding about a teaspoon of dried ginger and it really helped by adding a warm, mellow depth.  I like to serve this with couscous cooked in vegetable broth for a real taste of Morocco.  I served it to my Moroccan friend, and she thought it was pretty authentic.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was very tasty, but I did overcook the veggies.  The flavors were wonderful, but since it was overcooked it was not very attractive on the plate.  Served with white rice.  Will try again and watch the pot more closely.

FIFTY STARS!!  After my arm fell off from chopping, I doubled the spices (WOWZERS it was spicy!!!), and served over brown rice with Indian Flatbread (from a local restaurant).  Next time, I'll double or triple the raisins (I used plump golden raisins), as they were the calm of the storm in my mouth!  This curry dish was unbelievable!  Thanks so much for sharing!

So very yummy! I doubled spice per comments and used grapefruit juice instead of orange because that is what I had. Scarfed down with some whole wheat tortillas Ethiopian style with my hands. Very full, happy tummy and already looking forward to leftovers.

I agree with many of the other reviews, this is phenomenal!!! I cut the cayenne in half since I don't like foods that are too hot. My husband found this recipe when I was out of town and he wanted to cook something tasty yet easy for himself. He definitely found a winner! We've made this dish for family and friends and they have ALL asked for the recipe!

Delicious recipe!  Made a few small modifications:
about half the peppers; cut down the oil; increased spices a bit (omitted cayenne); 1/2cp orange juice + 1/2cp carrot juice; added some ginger (in addition to ginger in my curry). also didn't have blanched almonds so just chopped up some regular almonds I had on hand.

I've made this for years and would only make one suggestion. Start out with 1/4 tsp. of the cayenne then taste and add more a little at a time. This is one of my favorites.

This was delicious!  I omitted eggplant (didn't have any) and added milk (soymilk) at the end as others have suggested to make it bit creamier.  I was worried it would come out too orangey tasting because of the OJ (it didn't taste/smell very good at first), but after simmering, the strong orange taste was gone, and it ended up being wonderful.    Serve over couscous, rice, or quinoa with a flatbread such as naan.

This was fantastic!  I made it as is to give it a whirl.  The flavor was really good and all the different textures were wonderful.  Next time I'll probably add a it more onion and more curry just for an extra kick in flavor.  A wonderful vegan dish that can easily turn into a meat-eaters dish if you're looking for that.  We left it vegan though.

I made the dish as the recipe stated but without zucchini or carrots as I didn't have any. Substituted chili powder for the cayenne, and used half as much. Also reduced the cinnamon. I have to agree the sauce had no substance, and it really just tasted like curry powder. We threw the leftovers away, which is rare for us.

This curry was delicious, and fragrant!  I love that it combines many different sources of protein and nutrients!  Although the eye appeal may diminish after the initial serving, this made for great lunches---even without the rice.  I really appreciate this contribution to All Recipes!

I had to give this 5 stars because it is the best curry I have ever eaten. My house still smells good today. I read all reviews before making, and also doubled the spices, except for cinnamon and cayenne. I used a combo of mild and hot curry powder, so the extra heat was not necessary. I also added about 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and coriander. This dish blew us away, it was so sensational. I did not have zucchini and left it out. I could have subbed a yellow squash but decided it didn't need anything extra. Also, please use dried chickpeas if at all possible. The canned ones, even when drained and rinsed, just don't compare. We had Lundberg brown basmati rice on the side and will always use this combo. Enjoy.

Fantastic and I didn´t even fry the spices separately; I just browned the veggies and dumped everything else on top, including some fresh grated ginger. I would suggest adding more raisins because I just love it whenever I got a bite with a  raisin once in a while and wouldn´t it be nice to get one in every bite?

The first time I make this I found there was not enough sauce. I added a can of coconut milk and increased the curry the second time and found it much better.

I have been looking for some meatless recipes that would satisfy my meat eating DH.  He enjoyed this.  I am not much of a raisin fan, but they add something to the dish.  Don't leave them out! Will make again.

One of my alltime favorite dishes... have made this many times. You can switch up some of the veggies, although I always use the sweet potato and spinach. Usually the carrots, have also used fresh green beans and zucchini. I use craisins instead of raisins...personal preference.

Outstanding! I used 2c carrot-ginger juice mixed with a TBsp of cornstarch at last 10 minutes to make it saucier. I serve this over coconut jasmine rice and with chicken in a basil sauce.  This recipe is so easy versitle that every vegetable or bean substitution I've ever made has worked well.

tasty veggies, a excellent sweet accompaniment to hotter dishes but may need a little more heat itself, visually stunning if spinach not over cooked.

I feared this recipe would be as bland as so many other mixed veggie dishes I've made, but I tried it anyway - and am I ever glad I did! This is my new favorite recipe. It has a wide variety of ingredients for interest, and the flavor is wonderful. So tasty and just spicey enough with a touch of sweetness. I love it.

Outstanding! I had to use carrot-orange juice, because I could not find carrot-ginger, and I omitted the raisins. With a little sea salt and cooking the vegetables to a crisp-tener, this recipe was out of this world. When my wife was coming up the steps she said that something smelled good. When she came inside the fragrant aroma knocked her socks off. She couldn't stop commenting on how good the place smelled. She loved it, and now I have to give the leftovers (that I planned for myself) to her, to take to work. Great stuff!

DEEELISH! I'm not a vegetarian, but this was my favorite recipe of the week.  It is so wholesome and filling...real comfort food.  I was afraid it would be too spicy, so I only used half the cayenne called for.  It was a bit tingly on the lips, but definitely not hot.  Next time I'll use the whole amount.  And I had thought of leaving out the spinach because my pot didn't look like it would hold it, but I'm glad I didn't.  It definitely added somehthing.

Great recipe!  I did add more curry to make it spicier and I served it over rice. I love that this is so flavorful with just veggies and spices (and a little juice). I also think this is such an easy recipe to adapt.  I followed it exactly this first time, but you could totally just throw whatever vegetables you have around in here, and I think it would taste just as yummy.  And of course you can serve it with naan or couscous or some other grain to change it up, too.  This is a keeper!  My husband didn't love it (he doesn't love curry like I do) but he appreciated how healthy this is.  One last comment:  I didn't chop the veggies too finely, so this needed to simmer for like 45 minutes until it got soft and liquidy enough to eat.

Highly recommend this recipe. It was absolutely delicious!

I did not add the roasted nuts due to allergies. I also chose this recipe because it was vegan and dairy-free. I doubled the spices called, and incorporated half at the beginning. I then sprinkled more (to taste) throughout the simmering process. I used veggie stock with my brown rice, and ate leftovers the next day with cous-cous. There could have been more raisins to compliment the spices and carrots.

Again - highly recommend this fast and easy recipe!

We received some veggies in an imperfect produce box - the dreaded green bell pepper was one I was not looking forward to eating. However, in this dish, I couldn't even tell it was a green bell pepper! Hubby cooked and kept the general recipe - added fresh ginger, less OJ, omitting a few things due to preference and not wanting to make more than we could eat (red bell pepper, zucchini, eggplant, almonds, raisins) and it was a hit. Next time, I'll make more and add either a zucchini or eggplant and try almonds, too! We ate it with some naan bread. Yum!

I have been making this recipe for years - I can't believe I never rated it... It is superb. One of my all-time favorites from this site. I follow the suggestion to double the spices - even the cinnamon but not the salt. I plop the spinach in while it's still mostly frozen and cover it with the hot stew - it melts quickly. This MUST be served on couscous; I used to serve it on basmati and while I love basmati it has no place with this amazing curry dish. Use golden raisins as they get nice and fat during the cooking and halved almonds for full crunch impact - it is a true party in your mouth!

I don't understand all of the reviews that say "tastes great," or "really flavourful!" - I doubled the spices (as others suggested) and still thought it was bland. It needed far more liquid as well. If I make this again, I will use my own spice blend so that it actually tastes like a curry. I will try to find a more intense curry powder to use as well. There is no reason why you would have to make this in a dutch oven, since it is all stovetop a normal pot works fine.

This is an awesome recipe. I made it since I was having an Indian friend for dinner and I knew she was vegetarian. She loved it, which made me very proud! You can change around the ingredients, but it's just fine as it is!

My husband and I loved this.  I only used 1/2 the oil and didn't have spinach so used kale. 2nd time I made this without zucchini, almonds, and spinach, and added cauliflower, roasted peanuts, and 3 T raisins.

We've made this a hundred times and it's wonderful. I'm sure it's great with eggplant but since I can't stand eggplant, I always sub a squash of some kind and it always works. Making it again this week :)

My husband and I LOVED this! We had almost all the veggies on hand, except zucchini, which I replaced with butternut squash. I only had 1/2 small onion, so I used spring onions and added them in Step 3. I also used sliced almonds and didn't blanch them, and based on the recommendations to use carrot and ginger juice, added fresh ginger in Step 2. I agree that the sauce was a bit thin — I ended up cooking it about 5-10 minutes longer that suggested to reduce the sauce a bit more and cook my potatoes through. Served this with quinoa and it was excellent. We fought over the leftovers!

This was AMAZING!  I did as others suggested and used carrot juice and a bit of fresh ginger in place of the orange juice.  I was hesitant about the raisins and almonds, but they were the BEST part!  It's great over rice or couscous.  Next time I will make more sauce.  I can't stop thinking about how delicious this was!

Cooked this dish yesterday and made a few modifications just based on what we had on hand, but nothing significant. It was delicious!  My brother-in-law has a very narrow food repertoire and is very suspicious of new flavors. He ate his whole serving and enjoyed it - just said "Don't tell me what's in it."  I really like the flavors and will make it again.

It's true. It is that good. The cinnamon adds something special. Precooking spices is important. Also added fresh coriander. I had been looking for a generic veg curry because I had turnip, potato, green beans, celery, green peppers and zucchini on hand from the garden and of course the onion and garlic. It did not seem to matter.  It was delicious. I added a tablespoon of honey (sweet freaks) and 2 chicken bouillon cubes for salt.

A beautiful dinner!  We found it VERY spicy, so next time we are eliminating the cayenne - but I do not like spicy in general.  I'd also like a little more raisins and am going to add some pineapples to it.  THanks for another fave!

I am trying to expand our meal variety and this was delicious!  My husband said he was shocked it was so good!  I have to say, it doesn't get very high presentation points, but the taste and combination of flavors was amazing.  We don't like it too spicy, so I only added a bit over 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  Will definitely make again!

This was good, but I guess I expected more with all the five star reviews.  I thought it was good, but not my favorite of the curries I have made.  Maybe that is just our personal preference, as I didn't find anything wrong with the recipe.  Perhaps the flavor combo isn't our thing.  If you chop everything ahead, it goes together very quickly.  I served this with Israeli couscous.

This was really easy and very tasty. I baked it for about 1 hour at 350 to 400 degrees since I did not think the sweet potato would be cooked well enough by just the stove top. I also reduced the portion of cayenne to 1/2 tsp. since we don't like food too spicey/hot. It was perfect. I served it over quinoa. Excellent recipe! I might add that I am VERY adverse to cooking but found making this easy and enjoyable!

I thought this was a very good curry dish. I read the other reviews and doubled all spices except cinnamin and salt. I will double the cinnamin next time! My husband is not a big fan of curry but he liked this alot! I served it with whole wheat couscous and Nann bread. It makes alot and I also added firm tofu for protein. I used carrot juice instead of orange juice and grated in about a tablespoon of fresh ginger. The heat was not enough for me, I even added extra cayenne. The flavor overall was really tasty!

This turned out AWESOME!  Very authentic flavor.  I had several dishes going at the same time and forgot to include the squash - never missed it.  I also left out the carrots because I'm not fond of cooked carrots although in this dish they probably would have been great.  Otherwise I cooked according to directions.  DELISH!!

woah. this is delicious. i doubled the spices, as per suggested, and i would add that it might be wise to NOT double the cayenne when doubling everything else.  It's definitely edible with doubel cayenne, just have some water close by.  Also, I love the little bursts of sweet from the raisins, so I will add more next time.  Overall AMAZING dish. YUMMM!!

We did not really like this. The flavor was okay (we doubled everything except the cayenne and cinnamon) but a little too sweet for us. Also, we really did not like the spinach in this dish at all.

followed the recipe as directed, but doubled the spices except salt and cinnamon.  I agree with another reviewer that it is just a pot of flavored vegetables.  "Flavored" used loosely.  Nothing special about this dish.  I didn't enjoy eating this nor did my husband who will eat anything and say it's good.

This is exactly what I have been looking for. I omitted the spinach and almonds cause I did not have any. Just the right amount of spice and sweetness. I will make this a lot. Mu husband loves it too. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty, great texture, goes well over brown rice or couscous.  I added extra golden raisins, grated ginger, and used kale instead of spinach.  Because I ran out of curry powder I added a bit of garam masala and cumin to the spice mix.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for my sister and her hubby (who usually does the cooking) on vacation last week, and we all loved it! I followed the recipe almost to a T, but bumped up the seasonings just a tad. Served it over couscous with a side of hummus and pita. I also was intrigued with another reviewer's mention of carrot-ginger juice in place of the orange juice, so what I did was peeled and sliced a knob of ginger (about 5 or 6 thin pieces) and sauteed it with the ingredients in step 2. Poured the carrot juice in on step 3, and added a little more to the finish, as it got a bit dry. Dee-licious! I'm going to share it with my Weight Watchers group next week, points or no points. ;-)

I just came back from Morocco (Marrakesh included) and wanted to serve my family an authentic Moroccan meal. This was perfect! I came home with a mix of spices from the Medina so I used that and added a little extra curry powder for flavor. Served over saffron couscous and I was in veggie heaven :)

I made this for my veggie-head friend.  We were both gushing over the deliciousness!  Only alteration was doubling the curry and turmeric as suggested by others ~ it was perfect!  I would not hesitate to serve it for guests.  It looked beautiful served over couscous in bowls with small wooden spoons.  Thank you!!

I love this dish and have made it several times. I've made it exactly as the recipe states and it is great but I have also tweaked it for our preferences. I double the spices (except the cinnamon)and add cumin and garam masala. I use 1 cup orange juice plus 1/2 cup coconut milk. At the table my daughter likes to add a little soy sauce to hers while my husband and I like a little Thai chili sauce. It is a great recipe - thank you!

This curry was very good. I give it a 4 only because per reviewer suggestions, I doubled the amounts of curry and turmeric. I can not imagine having less spice than that to keep it good and flavorful. Just because of personal vegetable preferences, I did not put in spinach and subbed potato for sweet potato. Next time I will cut cayenne to 1/4 tsp because it was too spicy for our kids even with just 1/2. May add a bay leaf and cloves as well...

This was pretty good, but a tad bitter.  I added some brown sugar at the end and that got rid of the bitterness.  I also doubled the spices as other reviewers recommended and I halved the oil.  I cooked the vegetables in 1 tbsp of oil and the spices in 2 tbsp of oil and that seemed to work fine.  This recipe was similar to the Delicious Chickpea Curry and I liked the chickpea curry better (sweeter with a stronger cinnamon flavour).

I made this very hearty meal without the spinach.  My husband loved it but the kids wouldn't eat more than a few bites.  Next time I'll make less since there was WAY too much left over (not very good reheated).

Wow! I was really intimidated to try cooking this having little experience with this type of food (had a frozen pizza on standby as backup!).. but it was super easy and super good.  Made it more or less exactly like directed except used carrot-orange juice and added about a teaspoon fresh minced ginger since I couldn't find carrot-ginger juice.  I was afraid the amount of cayenne called for was too much but it was actually just about perfect when served over white rice.. a nice kick without burning your lips off!  For anyone who is interested in trying a recipe like this but isn't sure what to try.. highly recommended.  I'm only sorry I was chicken (figuratively) for so long :) -- This will be a staple in my house now..  PS.. don't leave off the raisins -- even if you're not normally a big fan.

I didn't put in eggplant or zucchini, I used 3 sweet potatoes. I added a coconut curry sauce to it at the end. Delish!

I made this for my book group of 8 women, and everyone really liked it and had seconds.  I doubled the recipe, but that turned out not to be necessary as there were a ton of leftovers.  It actually was a bit challenging to double the recipe as there are so many cut-up veggies that it required two large Dutch ovens.  Only change I made in cooking was to cook the sweet potatoes, carrots, and onions first, as other have suggested, and then I added the rest of the vegetables after about 5 minutes.  I would also be sure to stir in the spinach at the end since it won't cook properly otherwise.  The recipe worked perfectly served over plain couscous.  I recommend cutting up the veggies the night before--it makes the recipe fairly simple when you start cooking.  This is a very tasty, healthy, and filling winter stew for a crowd.

I read the reviews and doubled the all the spices but it still came out bland. I was hoping for the full rich flavours like you get in the Indian restaurants. Next time I will add some curry paste.

This is the best thing I ever ate but I despise all the ingredients so I substituted a frozen pizza for all of them.  Yum!  Will def. make again.  Pro-Tip:  Do not thaw pizza before placing in oven.

We really enjoyed this, and I'll make it again (along with coconut rice from this site).
As per others' suggestions, I doubled all the spices EXCEPT salt, Cayenne, and cinnamon. I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp but will reduce it to 1/8th tsp next time. I also added about 2 Tablespoons fresh ginger, and increased the garlic to roughly 2 Tablespoons. I also added about 1/2 Tablespoon cumin. I made this dish early in the day so that the flavors could meld before dinner time rolled around. It smelled and tasted wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

Omitted the eggplant and added 1 extra sweet potato and 2 extra carrots.   Loved it.   This is a great recipe that is adaptable to the veggies you have on hand.   Loved the spices.   Make sure you use a quality curry.

I enjoy the reviews and helpful tips, especially from those who are of Morrocan descent. I needed to cook this for 30 min, mainly for the carrots. Even at that time, they were not really soft. I did not have eggplant (or zucchini) on hand, so I doubled the sweet potatoes and left out the almonds (personal preference). I can't imagine cooking eggplant that long; it would turn into mush. I also doubled the spices. The raisins added a nice touch of occasional sweetness which helped subdue the spicyness. I liked and used the tip of adding beef broth towards the end of cooking for a more runny curry. I had this with Coconut Rice from this site. Great recipe NIBLETS, and one I'm sure to make again! Congrats NE Patriots on a great Super Bowl win yesterday!

I don't care for spicy food, but I tried this recipe because I like all of the other ingredients except the cayenne.  That said, however, I DO plan to make it again, cutting back on the cayenne.  Excellent combinations here, and it's worth another try.

I love this dish! I saw that a lot of the users used one dish to make this dish so I did the same. I needed extra protein so I cubed one and a half chicken breasts to add to the dish. After heating up the oil, I added the spices and the chicken and cooked for a few minutes.  I doubled the curry, turmeric and garlic to start with, about a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and added a splash of cinnamon and about 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala from another reviewers suggestion. I then added the vegetables including an addition of some acorn squash and let them cook for a while. After adding 1 1/4 cup of orange juice, I threw in more turmeric, curry and garam masala to taste. It was really delicious. I didn't have raisins or spinach to put in this time, but this is definitely a recipe to keep and try again when I do have them. I also recommend cubing the sweet potato smaller than you would think. This made about 7 very hearty servings.

This was good and I would make again. I cut up all the veggies and threw them in a large pot that had about 3-4 tbsp of olive oil. Then I minced 4 cloves of garlic and added the seasonings, doubling up on the curry and added more cayenne. I used garam masala in place of cinnamon. Also added about a half cup more orange juice. Maybe would use veggie broth next time. Also would use more raisins and almonds. Thanks for the recipe.

Even with the added brown sugar, the kids complained about it.  Dad and I liked it. Served over brown rice.  A lot of chopping, but if it can all be done in advance, this would be pretty easy dish.

This recipe was so wonderful I cant wait to make it again. The contrast of textures and flavors were to die for. The only change I made was I added about 1 cup of vegetable broth to the pot to make it more juicy. Served it with brown jasmine rice. My house smells like a morrocan market now!

I doubled all the spices except for the cinnamon, added about 1 tsp of minced fresh ginger and omitted the bell peppers because I don't like them. Used about 1/2 cup of almonds and the same amount of raisins. I served everything over couscous and thought it was good, but I never had vegetable curry before so I have nothing to compare it to. I followed SYLEDA B's method of cooking: Started my Dutch oven with the oil and the spices. Next added carrot, onion and potatoes cooked 3-4 min. Added OJ, raisins, and chickpeas. Cooked 10 min. Then added all veggies (except spinach), almonds and raisins. Cooked 10 min. while I made couscous. Stirred in spinach and cooked 5 min. All veggies were perfectly cooked.

Well I do a lot of vegan cooking but somehow this sort of missed the mark. I think my eggplant and sweet potato were larger than intended because I ended up with so much veg that I couldn't use my Dutch oven and needed the wok instead. I think the second problem is that the eggplant, sweet potato, and carrot need to be cut maybe half the size of everything else or cooked a lot more upfront. I like crunchy veggies but really not undercooked eggplant. At the end it really just tasted like a lot of curried veggies so we added coconut milk and quite a bit of salt and pepper (I try not to use much salt in general but this really needed it) overall I'll probably make it again just with some tweaks.

really delicious. Needed just a tad more flavor so added a dash of cumin and powdered ginger. Added 12 oz of orange juice instead of the 8 it calls for so it would be a bit saucier.

This is so good!!! I do cook mine a bit longer so the vegetables are cooked...that's just my personal taste. I prefer my sweet potato soft. I have to omit the cayenne pepper to keep my mouth on earth,lol, but otherwise is to just fabulous!! I eat it on rice (warm) or alone (cold) the next day for breakfast. I've also frozen small containers of it. Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent flavour!  I love the many vegetables in the dish. It's an easy way of making sure one gets the required amount of fruits & veggies in a day, plus some!  Very healthful which is a big plus. This recipe makes a lot. We consumed it over the course of a few days - sometimes with basmati rice, other times with tandoori chicken and couscous.   It would make a great dinner on its own. Thanks for the recipe.

It was very good. I added a jalepeno to give it a kick and I used Hungarian paprika for more heat. I'm not a big fan of sweet dishes, this seemed a bit sweet to me but was still good. I served it on a bed of couscous.

I just had a group over and made this for everyone.  I doubled the amount of veggies, and I tripled the spices and garlic (except for cayenne pepper, which I used 1 tsp).  It was a hit!  I used OJ as the recipe calls for.  I made this specifically because we were having a couple of vegans, but this will be used again for vegans and non-vegans alike!  Thanks.

Great & simple recipe. One thing if you re watching calories, cut down the oil to just a single teaspoon for each. it doesn't impact flavor and cuts out 600 or so calories from the finished meal. Really good flavors!

Like other folks I also doubled the spices.

Tripled the spices but was still not as flavorful as a curry ought to be. With a few tablespoons of sriracha, and a little extra salt it was good. I'd make it again with a bit more raisins, even more spices, and some ginger. I used extra zucchini in place of eggplant and black beans rather than garbanzos but would try it as written next time, although I did like the black beans.

I cut my sweet potatoes too big (about 1") and had to let this cook for closer to 30-35 minutes for them to soften up.

Other than that I was really pleased with this dish!

Fabulous and delicious vegan dish. I have been making this dish several times a month - and freezing the left overs for quick healthy/frozen dinners. Freezes and re-heats  in microwave great! The only change I make to the original recipie is to use less olive oil (I use usually between 3-4 Tbs total).

WOWZA! My husband can't stop raving about this dish! I used the veggies I had on hand since I couldn't run to the store that day, so I ended up not adding the peppers and subbing a russet potato for the sweet. And I didn't have any spinach. But I'm looking forward to making the recipe as written. I will be making this again and again. Delicious. PS I didn't add the almonds so that my daughter could eat it, and it was still great :)

We LOVED this dish and will repeat it many times I'm sure.  I didn't use almonds because I didn't have them and I added some ginger.  I also increased all of the spices a little but don't think you have to to make it good.  I served it over Israeli coucous and it was DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe!  Used carrot juice instead of orange juice with good results.  Left out almonds because of husband's allergy, but next time I'll add some on top of my serving.  Used brown jasmine rice underneath.  I will keep this and make it again.

It is with great sadness that I give this recipe only three stars. I loved it myself (after reading the other reviews and adding extra spice), but it was not a big hit with my family. My partner is averse to savory dishes with raisins and cinnamon, and my 5-year-old liked it until he got "something mushy," at which point he began to cry.  
But I thought it was quite tasty. A nice blend of flavors, and a beautiful array of colors in the vegetables. Oh, and I substituted raw pistachios for the almonds, which I thought was really good.

wonderful as is and still versatile enough to add/ omit vegetables as per availabillity. The orange juice turns the dish sublime. Dont forget to add some fresh ginger in. complements the OJ wonderfully. Served it with some couscous that had been soaked in veggie broth and tossed in EVOO. yum!

AMAZING. I doubled the spiced except for the cayenne. I would say this makes more like 10 (1.75 cup, 240 calorie) servings. SO YUMMY!! Will be making again, SOON!

I literally licked the dish after I finished my portion.  So it was a good thing we didn't have company over. Made it with only one substitute - cannellini beans in place of the garbanzo.  Amazing blend of flavors!

This curry was deeeeeeelicious. I omitted the sweet potato and spinach simply because I didn't have any and replaced cayenne with paprika (it's what I had); also I added a little chicken broth so it'll be more saucy. This curry was devine - ever so slightly spicy but very flavorful - who needs meat when veggies taste so good? I served this over cous cous with a little bit of yogurt on top. Try it NOW!

So delicious!!! Followed the recipe with only minor changes (celery and chick-pea instead of zucchini and garbanzo beans as this is what I had on hand), doubled the turmeric, curry powder but did not add almons because of allergies in the family.
Let it simmer for about 35-40 minutes. Served over jasmine rice. Yummmmy!! 
This recipe will be definitely added to my regular recipes even though we are not vegetarians! Thank you Niblets for your recipe.

Thanks! to all the reviewers out there and NIBLETS' excellent recipe, our MVP was a triumph. Doubled turmeric and curry powder, used just a sprinkle of salt, substituted zucchini with cubed calabaza (yum), used chopped figs instead of raisins and carrot juice and fresh-grated ginger (1 tsp).  Added ginger to Step 2, eggplant to Step 3. Served with brown rice, oat bran pita bread, and plain Greek yogurt on the side. Nuked the squash and sweet potato on high for one minute each, just for ease in cubing. However you prepare this fragrant dish, you will surely enjoy it. Can't miss and sooooooo healthy!

Tasty! A great change up from regular curry, although a few things hold it back. Like many reviewers, I doubled the spices, which made it nice and flavorful, but I've found it doesn't keep all that well. My batch has been in the fridge for two days and is getting really mushy. It doesn't really work for me as a main course, but it's a great side dish.

This was just okay. The consistency came out very strange, and the flavors didn't work especially well together. We didn't throw it away, but I definitely won't be making this again.

This dish was lovely!  A little bit of work but well worth it.  I served it with rice & naan bread.  
A few changes I made: cut way back on the oil, using only about 1 1/2 tbsp in the spice mixture, added a bit of diced beef, and, best of all, used FRESH turmeric.  If you can get your hands on fresh, do it!  So much better than the dried powder.  I also added a touch of fenugreek and left out the curry powder and cayenne (family members who don't or can't eat those spices).  Delicious and would totally make it again!

This had some interesting flavors, but I'm not sure if I loved the orange juice with curry. It blends well enough, but didn't blow me away. My husband and I both thought it was good, but then the leftovers didn't get eaten, so I think that says it all.

Have made this many, many times with great success.  Double the spices as many have mentioned (except the cayenne), add ginger (dried or fresh) as well.  When on hand I add some coconut milk at the end for additional flavor.

This was really really good as a healthy vegetarian dish, but for us, it was definitely not spicy enough, I think next time I would, at minimum, triple the cayenne and the curry, other than that we all enjoyed it!! Thanks for a wonderful healthy recipe!

My husband and I loved this.  I made a few additions, chicken thighs (boneless, skinless), fresh cut up tomatoes.  McCormick has a new (to me) spice, roasted ginger, I added that with a bottle of fresh carrot juice instead of the oj as was suggested and served it over a bed of cous cous and topped with roasted pine nuts (didn't have almonds)...delicious

I served this with Basmati rice and a flat bread that I put in the oven for 4 minutes at 400 degrees to imitate naan bread and WOW, this was AMAZING!!!  I have tried to make curry twice before and both times the end result was not very good/bad. I was hesitant to try this one but I had all the spices and wanted to give it a last try. Third time's a charm!  I have had amazing Indian food before at restaurants and this came so close to the authentic stuff, GREAT recipe - thank you!!!

So yummy.  When I brought this to work, people walked in to the lunch room wondering who's food smelled so good.  I made this with lamb and it was a nice addition.  I usually always add more of the spices as well.....I like it flavorful.

Delicious! the first time I prepared this recipe was on a Coleman stove while camping. I have made it several times since then. I omit the spinach-- I have found that it keeps/re-heats better without it. Also, I am not a big fan of yellow raisins so I skip those too. I found it was unnecessary to blanch the almonds, they soak up plenty of liquid while simmering. Sometimes I add a little ginger into the mix. All in all, this recipe is well-loved and I'd recommend it!

This was really good. I used the suggestion to double all the spices except the cinnamon and added a Tbsp. of cardamom. I ended up using two cups of OJ instead of one because I wanted sauce for the rice. I missed that the salt unit of measure was a tbsp. and ended up adding extra. Will make again.

Smells great, tastes great, and we love making it when the weather starts getting chilly! I think I should start making larger batches and freezing it for those days when I don't feel like cooking dinner.

I thought this was very good - I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp - it was still plenty spicy for me, almost too much, as the heat kind of overpowered the other fragrant flavors of the dish.  I had no spinach on hand and no orange juice, so I used half vegetable stock, half coconut milk and as an afterthought added a tablespoon of orange marmalade.  I also added a heaping teaspoon of grated ginger to the spice mix.  That worked great - I had a nice subtle orange undertone without the dish being too sweet, as others had mentioned.  I'd love to try it with the carrot-ginger juice, as the submitter suggested, as I think that would be excellent!

This is absolutely delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be great as is.  I wasn't in the mood for something too spicy today, but as I usually enjoy my food really spicy, I'll probably double the spices as others have suggested the next time I make this (there will absolutely be a next time).  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was really hoping that this would be better, it was ok, just not spectacular. I prefer a little more sauce with my curries to put over rice. I'm not 100% what was missing in this.

I loved this recipe, I left out the zuc and used some frozen veggies so it prob would have been even better had I stuck to all fresh. I would use more spices next time but this dish was really great and it made my kitchen smell amazing even if i did make a bit of a mess :-p

This is delicious, i've made it according to the recipe and also made other versions and it takes many substitutions quite well. My favorite sub is to replace the raisins with dates though, extra bursts of sweetness that keeps with the moroccan theme :)

I've made this a couple of times and it has always turned out good.  Last night I decided to try it with the carrot-ginger juice as I just got a new juicer and it turned out even better than usual! I would definitely recommend trying it with the carrot-ginger juice!

I really loved this. It was very filling for a meal with no meat. I used an extra sweet potato instead of the eggplant, used yellow curry paste instead of curry powder and added more raisins than called for. I make the whole recipe and used the leftovers for lunches. The leftovers tasted just as good as the original meal. This is something I'll be making often.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  So good for dinner and the leftovers were even better the next day!  We did substitute the eggplant with 1/2 head of cauliflower because I don't like eggplant's texture.  We also increased most of the spices by 50% because we like things spicy.  This will be a regular in our rotation.  So happy to have found it!!!

This gets high marks for nutritional value, but I wasn't wowed by the flavor.  Some of my family members liked it a lot, but others just nibbled.  I think it was a bit too spicy for some of them.  Also, doesn't two tablespoons of raisins seem a bit silly?  I added more to my portion.

This was a wonderful recipe. I made some modifications based on what I had (I was cooking during the blizzard here in DC) and left out the peppers, spinach and almonds. I also added an acorn squash. I also cooked the curry for longer (probably about 1.5 hours) under a low heat. I served it on whole wheat couscous and it was delicious!

Way too much cinnamon.  It overpowers the taste of this dish. Did not like.  Tasted better when mixed with sour cream.

I've been eating mostly vegetarian fare for about two months now and was excited to find a new recipe that incorporated sweet potato (the sweet potato minestrone from this site is out of this world).  Sweet potato is one of those very healthy veggies that I can't stand...at least cooked in traditional ways:)  This recipe was fabulous!  I wanted a little more crunch so I doubled the almonds and I think I may add a little more raisins the next time I make this.  I didn't substitute anything for the orange juice but I did add 3/4 tsp. of ginger which gave it a fair amount of zing...plan to heat up the leftovers tonight and serve with cous cous.  I would recommend everyone gage the spices according to their own likes and dislikes...it won't ruin this recipe...promise;)

Really, really good!  I omitted the eggplant (didn't have one on hand) and increased the curry powder as others noted.  I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans.  So flavorful and made a lot!  It reheated well for lunch the next day.  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good stuff...maybe the best Moroccan curry I've had yet. I took other people's advice and nearly doubled most of the spices, except the cayenne, and added a teaspoon of coriander.  Served it with couscous.

Wow, this was amazingly good.  I multiplied the recipe by about 5x and cooked this for a big party, and got rave reviews from everybody.  I threw in a whole cauliflower and some regular potatoes.  I also got confused at the store and bought yams instead of sweet potatoes, but that actually worked with it quite well.  The almonds are key for texture.

Fun fun FUN recipe! Really pretty to look at! If you like spices, than this is your dish. I loved it, as I love many different styles of cooking and I love curry.  My husband was not as crazy about it as I was because he "could not taste the veggies" due to the spices. If you like to be able decipher your flavors, than not for you... but if you like the mix and spice, that give it a try!

This is an excellent dish!  I made it with more cayenne than called for and it was super hot.  I also substituted portabella mushrooms for the eggplant (the bf does not like aubergines) and added a bit more of the other veggies to compensate for the lack of zucchini (the finicky bf hates them).  Didn't miss either a bit.  Also, I threw in some cubed tempeh for a meatier consistency.  I am very happy with the results!  Thanks Niblets!

GREAT!!! I made this for myself and my Moroccan in-laws and it was absolutely true to the original.  I didn't have carrots or orange juice.  But I substituted the OJ for a few generous splashes of lemon juice.  I served over couscous.  This is going to be a definite repeat.

We love this recipe! Have been making it for years. We don't like things too spicy, so I use paprika instead of cayenne, and we love it. I also usually omit the spinach, as it seems a bit too much. We LOVE the carrot-ginger juice - that's the best way to make it. And the raisins add this really cool sweet and juicy hit at the end. I love to serve this at dinner parties - it's always a delicious surprise, and it makes the house smell good for a long time! Oh, and I use a large, deep electric fry pan to make this, since I don't have a dutch oven. The electric frypan works great for all the steps - it simmers well too.

This was quite tasty, however, it makes a ton. I don't do frozen leftovers, unfortunately, so next time maybe I'll half it or invite a bunch of friends.  I don't think I could eat this more than one meal a week.

A bit too sweet for my tastes... maybe less cinnamon next time.  I expected to have a flavor explosion based on all the ingredients but didn't get what I was hoping for... still an enjoyable meal and will probably try to make again with some changes to the spices

Delicious!  My first foray into making this sort of cuisine and it turned out much better than I expected.  I couldn't find any sweet potatoes at the farmer's market, so I used a yukon gold.  Also omitted the nuts.  Aside from that, I made as is.  Ate with some whole wheat tandoori bread for dinner and will eat the leftovers with brown rice.

The only thing I'd change is that I wish I would have made a double batch.

OK, I'm impressed.  I don't usually like sweet main dishes, but I tried this because I had the ingredients available and the reviews were good, and I am very glad I did!  I subbed regular potato for the sweet, cauliflower instead of green pepper (cauliflower is a must in curries for me) and since I didn't have turmeric I just used more curry powder (plus extra).  I only  put a small pinch of cayenne. Oh, and I forgot the spinach.  This seems like a very flexible dish to me, and it was yummy.

I was very impressed with this dish. I doubled the spices except the cinnamon & cayenne and I only used 1 teaspoon of salt. I also added 1 tbsp minced ginger and a 1/2 tsp each of cumin, coriander and garam masala. I didn't add the zucchini until the last 10 minutes of cooking and I only added the almonds to my portion instead of adding in the cooking. My husband said he was surprised that it tasted so good - he was prepared not to like it because it was meatless. I will make this regularly, it was very very good. And all the chopping was actually quite relaxing for me!

This was fantastic!!!  I eliminated the raisins and substituted vegetable stock for the OJ, but it turned out wonderful.  Next time I will increase the spices and decrease the cayenne pepper (the hubby is a light-weight when it comes to spicey) but I can heartily recommend this!!!  Thank you!!!

Delicious! Used cashews instead of almonds, fresh carrot juice and ground ginger instead of orange juice, and added a splash of coconut milk just for fun. Turned out great! Will definitely be making it again.

I didn't have a dutch oven so I ended up cooking the veggies on low, in a frying pan, until tender. I then added the spices and OJ and simmered for 15 minutes. I didn't have zucchini so I substituted it with asparagus and fresh peas.  I thought it was really healthy with the right amount of sweet and spice.

This smelled great until I added the orange juice; it was a little too sweet for me. I was hoping for something with more taste. I might try making this again, with some changes. Thanks for posting!

I really like this but it's too sweet, so I will try the carrot/ginger juice instead of the orange next time.  I omitted the onions & eggplant.  Be sure to cube the potato and carrot small as it doesn't cook as fast as the zucchini.

Good!  Of course I made some changes - 1) I didn't use the red pepper, almonds, raisins, OJ, or spinach. 2) I used 1 cup of water w/ a bouillon cube instead of OJ, 8 cloves of garlic, and doubled the spices (except cayenne & salt). 3)Instead of sauteeing for 5 minutes, I let the veggies simmer for about 15.
Then I skipped separate step of sauteeing the garlic w/ spices.  I just threw it all in the pot w/ the veggies & mixed it up. I then picked up from there, adding the garbanzos & zucchini, followed by the water & bouillon cube. I then simmered it for about 30 minutes instead of the 20 because the veggies just didn't seemed cooked enough at 20 minutes.

This was very tasty.  I only used one green bell pepper, added ginger, used pine nuts in place of almonds, doubled the raisins, ommitted the zucchini, totally forgot the spinach and instead of orange juice had to use Capri Sun!!!  It came out great.  Pretty quick to make even with chopping up the vegetables, which really isn't THAT time consuming.  Nice combination of flavors.

This is a new favourite. we love the eggplant and sweet potato, but we leave out the spinach. I play with this one alot. i like adding coconut milk with the OJ, and also i sometimes put about a tsp of brown sugar in with the spices. It's so yummy :)

Wonderful served on top of the Saffron Rice. I didn't have sweet potato, and substituted white potato.  Skipped the eggplant because I don't like it, and substituted another green pepper for the red pepper, since they are out of season.  Also, I added the liquid from the garbanzo beans (chick peas) so I would have more "sauce" with the veggies to serve with the rice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great.  It also went really well with some pita on the side instead of the rice.

This dish was flavorful and very nutritious. I added more spices to suit my own tastes and served with basmati rice and pita bread. My family apprehensively tried it and was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely make it again.

Fabulous! I added a wee bit too much salt, but that was easily counteracted with sugar and cinnamon. I know others have said that the preparation of this recipe was too time consuming...but I found it to fit perfectly within a very tight schedule. My advice to them: peel the veggies faster.
This recipe will become one of my regulars. Great one-dish meal.

I tried this out for our friends last night.  We all agreed it was good, but was a little bland.  Also, the prep time was more than I expected, I would have done all my chopping before my guests arrived!  I used orange juice and red pepper flakes (didn't have the cayenne).   I would season it up a bit if I make it next time.  It was a very healthy vegetarian meal.

Amazing! Substituted dates for the raisins and bok choy for the zucchini and spinach (basically cleaned out our fridge). So, even if you don't have everything in your fridge and pantry, get creative!

Wonderful combination of flavors!  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the spices, but next time I won't increase the cayenne.   I like spicy, but not to the point where I have to gulp water after every bite.  One problem I had was not enough orange juice (subbed half with chicken broth) and that would have helped tame the cayenne.  I'll make sure to have plenty next time.

Not gonna lie, I was very scared going into this. This was my first time ever trying an African recipe and boy did it exceed my expectations. Sweet, citrusy, with a tad bit of heat. I followed others advice by doubling the spices. This will be a dish I make again.

Great and easy.  I am making it the 2nd time this month. I followed other recommendations. 4 tsp curry pwd, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 3 tbl raisins.. I had cashews so I used them instead of almonds for a good result.

I took this to a potluck. served as a casserole (over a bed of rice) and it was loved by everyone who tried it. I wish I snapped a photo, but people dug in right away.

The only change I made was omitting the eggplant because we're not fans of the texture. I used two small sweet potatoes and one large zucchini to make up the difference. Funny thing... once I told people there were raisins in it, they were glad they didn't know because they might not have tried it - so, I guess you can put them in or not. 

Overall, I would definitely make this again. It was great the first time or as left-overs.

Kudos to the purist---but I used yellow curry paste instead of cooking the spices separately.  Will definitely make again.

I thought it was great! I included some fried tofu  chunks for added protein. Just let them simmer in the sauce so they can absorb the flavor.. (I suggest making extra sauce !)

We were looking for recipes that would help us incorporate more vegetables into our diet.  This recipe is just the ticket.  It takes some time to prepare the vegetables, but once that part is done, it's easy-peasy the rest of the way.  We aren't bell pepper fans, so we left those out.  We added a bunch more raisins since we like that little bit of sweetness.  We add more almonds too.  We felt like it needed more salt, but that's purely a personal preference.

My husband accidentally bought a cucumber instead of a zucchini which turned out to be a happy accident.  We liked the firmer texture of the cucumber.  Both are equally good, though.

This will become a regular recipe in our monthly meals.

I wish I could give this dish 100 stars!  Spices and vegetable amounts were the same but I substituted zucchini for the eggplant and kidney beans for garbanzos.  I strongly suggest keeping the broth in this recipe down to the orange juice and spices, as is.  It a refreshing soup-stew.  Bright with flavors!  Next time I will caramelize some tofu and serve it poured over that for protein.  This dish is just so scrumptious. UPDATE:  It has been 30 minutes since I starting eating this wonderful soup, which was when I posted the review.  Everybody has gone back for seconds already, and there's hardly any left in the pot.  :(  Oh well...

This was soooo much work, but it was the BOMB!!! I served it over a mix of wild rice and quinoa.  I worked on it through out the day cutting up various parts of the recipe.  That really helped, so I didn't have to do it all at one time.  I would like to make it again,  and cook  the special rice they show in the video.  After making the basic recipe, I just didn't have the energy to do any extras.

Really good, except I did follow the exact amount of spices to use and it was a bit too spicy for me. Also I used Orange-raspberry juice because I didn’t have any orange juice and that kind of ruined the whole flavour, so just a heads up to not do that.

This was EXCELLENT! I'm so glad I found this recipe and tried it. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I used orange-carrot juice instead of plain orange juice (which probably didn't make much of a difference). The curry had such a wonderful flavor that was a mix between sweet and spicy (but not too spicy). I love that this dish is so healthy, with so many different vegetables in it, and so low in fat. It is something I would definitely serve for company, especially if anyone was a vegetarian or vegan. I served it with basmati rice, but I think it would also be good with couscous.  It does require some time to chop the veggies, , but in the end, it is most definitely worth it! I couldn't stop sneaking bites from the leftovers in the fridge the day after I made it. :P

Delicious! (Eaten 1+ days after making it) Used 2 green peppers, forgot to add the spinach, and added 1 cup chicken broth and about 1 cup of Trader Joe's carrot-ginger soup to make more broth. Crushed some dry roasted almonds in place of blanched almonds. I served this over quinoa. I plan to make this regularly, so good!!!

I followed another comment and added a lot more spice to it.  It's a flexible recipe and I eat it with rice.  Everybody who's had it with me has enjoyed it!

I've made this three times, and quite happily so.  Every time I've followed the advice of the user who doubled most of the spices, and I couldn't imagine doing it any other way.  Absolutely stellar curry, especially with the suggested coconut rice pairing~

Pretty much stuck to the recipe, with a little extra seasoning.  The aroma was captivating and the taste, delicious.  Served it over some Jasmati rice with naan.   Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic dish! I substituted another sweet potato for the eggplant and used water instead of orange juice. It was not hard to make, and the flavor was wonderful.

Delicious - Had to substitute white potato for sweet, lemon juice for orange because that's what was in the cupboard and fridge.  I liked mine with a teaspoon of plain yogurt.

Very tasty and colorful dish. Only 4 stars because we like more heat, so I will amp that up next time.  I omitted the nuts and raisins due to allergies, and used Chinese eggplant since we like it's milder flavor. Otherwise, followed the recipe and was very pleased with the results. Served with coconut rice and tandoori spiced chicken skewers and got rave reviews.

LOTS of ingredients.  A very good, sweet-ish curry.  Does need some salt to taste when serving.  Also, seems to freeze quite well (which is good, because the recipe makes A LOT).

This was a pleasant surprise, I was expecting a rather  mildly spicy taste but it was robust and well balanced. I used Sun brand Madras curry powder and Penzy's Vindaloo curry. Total I used 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons total.

Excellent recipe. I made it without eggplant and doubled the raisins. It was very dry so I ended up adding about 2 cups of water at the end.

Highly nutritious and a great way to use a lot of veggies. I substituted black beans for the garbanzo beans, and they worked just fine. I used water and a little ginger to substitute for the orange juice. I doubled the spices, except the salt, but I probably should have left the cayenne pepper as originally specified because the final dish was a bit too spicy. The cinnamon was excellent. This was a good recipe, but the chopping of the veggies took much longer (20-30 minutes in total) than expected.

I suggest covering and cooking the veggies for 10 min before adding the spices. Keep covered for 45 min on medium heat one all ingredients are combined.

So, I didn't have spinach, almonds, raisins or orange juice (which I substituted with a cup of stock), so I can't claim I made THIS recipe exactly, but it was still very good. All of the spices give it complex savoriness, which probably would have been tempered from version I made by the addition of sweeter elements like the orange juice and raisins.

Yes I will make it again!  I left out the chick peas because we were haveing it with chops but I will make it again as a vegetarian entree with the chickpeas.  I also added some chopped preserved lemon which is a common Moroccan condiment. A nice addition.

As many have mentioned, the smell of this cooking is wonderful.  The taste is just as good.  I did have to make a few changes based on veggies I had on hand but basic recipe with spices (doubled) was the same.  I served this with coconut rice and salad with avocado. Everyone enjoyed it

I enjoyed this recipe, but did make some modifications based on other reviews. I didn't have an eggplant so I substituted one large red skin potato.  I used the "one pot" method that others suggested, adding 3 TBS olive oil to the dutch oven and toasting the spices for a few mins before adding the carrots, potatoes and onions.  I sauteed those for about 10 mins before adding the rest of the veggies, garlic, garbanzo beans, raisins and liquid (I used a carrot/orange juice blend that I had added about 1 TBS of grated ginger).  Turned the heat to low, covered the dutch oven and let it simmer for about 20 mins before stirring in the fresh spinach and about 1/4 cup of raw sliced almonds.  I did have to add about an additional 1/3 cup of water so that there was enough liquid for the dish.  This was served over some brown basmati rice.   It was a tasty, vegetarian dish that I will most likely make again!

Made this last night and loved it - so did doubting boyfriend.  Next time I will up the amounts of the spices, but not too much. I toasted whole, unblanched almonds for about 50 seconds in the microwave and that added flavor and instead of salt I used Better Than Bouillon vegetable base, about 1 T.  Used craisins instead of raisins and served with sriracha sauce. Awesome recipe.

This is so good, but the prep time for me was much longer than 15 minutes. However, this dish was worth every second spent. I served it over basmati rice and it made me want to slap my mama! I highly recommend this combination of sweet and spicy. Delicious!!!!!

I made this for supper last night. Everyone loved it and says "Put it in the "keeper" book. I only made one change because I didn't have any orange juice on hand.  I substituted a can of coconut milk for the juice. It made the dish creamy. Otherwise followed exactly and it was excellent.

Loved this recipe! Followed the advice of others and doubled the spices, except for cayenne pepper. I also added about a cup of water to give it more of a sauce. It was excellent served with coconut rice.

Wow! I made this for the first time tonight and it turned out really well (especially for a first time)! I made this exactly as the recipe described. It was pretty easy, even for someone who is inexperienced/unskilled in the kitchen! I will add this to our regular rotation for sure! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is excellent!
I like hot but the 3/4 tsp cayenne was a bit too much. 
The recipe doesn't indicate at what point to add the cayenne (I added it to step 2).
I omitted the cinnamon.

Much better than I expected. I didn't use the sweet potato, since I didn't want to go to the store for just one thing, and I didn't use the spinach just because it seemed like overkill.  This will become a regular on our summer menu.

I doubled some of the spices except the salt and cinnamon.  I will probably not double the cayenne because was a little too spicy.  I served it with couscous.

This was a really yummy dish! I'm not a cook and this wasn't too difficult to do, so that was promising. Plus this recipe made a huge huge portion. Next time I make this, I'll be sure to split it in half and safe it in the freezer. Also, instead of blanched almonds I used cashews since I really didn't want to blanch my almonds nor pay for them, plus I think that cashews were super good in this dish and ills do it again.

Yum - really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I left out the almonds because I didn't have them.  The spices burned a little bit - next time I'll cook them 3 minutes on medium-low rather than on medium.

This is a great recipe and so very close to the Moroccan food I love so much. I have added lamb sausage with Harissa and other spices. Great with hot naan or pita bread. Over couscous or quinoa. Delicious.

I thought this was a great dish overall, nice balance of spice without being overwhelming.  The only problem was the garbanzo beans - which was my fault.  I soaked dried beans overnight, but they never got soft.  Otherwise, would cook this dish again!

Wow, I really love this recipe! Of course I made a few changes, as most folks do. I didn't have any spinach so I left that out. I don't like eggplant so I doubled the zucchini. I added more Cayanne pepper because I like my curries spicy. The largest addition was that I used this as a stuffing in an acorn squash. That really sent this over the top for me. Again, I really love this recipe I plan to make it again many times.

This is amazing, both smell and taste. I guess orange juice is the secret ingredient that gives some sweetness to this dish. Add greens just before serving to preserve the nutrients.

Preparation time took much longer than indicated. Good enough flavour once cooked, though.  I increased the spice levels based on other comments here. I also had to add a lot of liquid in order to cook the vegetables - I used chicken broth as I had lots on hand.

I did not include eggplant. The blanched Almonds were tedious.  The prep work took twice the amount of tine.  Will absolutely make again. I'll probably top it with uncooked raisins for added texture.  It is not too spicy.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Making it and eating it. I didn't have zucchini, but added califlour and wax  beans. I  think you could add any type of  fresh vegetables,  and it will still be good. The flavor comes from the seasoning.

Loved this recipe!  The only change I made was to decrease the olive oil, and first sauté garlic and spices in a large pan, then just added veggies, stirred well, sautéed for an additional five minutes then proceeded as written.  Saves a pan and I feel accomplished the same result.  This also allows one to decrease oil by a tablespoon or two, making it a bit healthier.

Love, love the flavors in this dish! Added ginger based off some comments in the reviews, and about a cup of beef broth at the end of cooking during simmering. Big hit with the whole family, I served over simple white rice and it was a great, complete meal.

I made so many substitutions, I'm not sure that it should even qualify as the same recipe.  But it was absolutely wonderful; this spice blend can handle just about any combination of firmish leftover vegetables you happen to have around.  I used carrots, zucchini, miscellaneous potatoes, yellow and red bell peppers, plus the onions and garlic as directed.  I also used mostly lemon juice plus some "tropical" juice, as we were out of orange juice.  I omitted the almonds as we have a nut allergy, and skipped the spinach as we didn't have any.   I did have all the specified spices, and those are clearly what make the dish.  I decreased the cayenne and the salt a tad for the children, but otherwise left the spices as they were.  Needless to say, I'm keeping this one around -- it'll be my new "what to do with a whole bunch of leftover veg" curry dish.  I happened to have some leftover tumeric/cumin/black sesame couscous from yesterday (weird coincidence - totally different recipe), and it was terrific over that, but also very good over plain old brown rice.

I've always wanted to work with these spices and it was wonderful to fill the house with these rich aromas. I've never tried a recipe that called for warming the spices separately in olive oil - tremendous

This is worth every minute of prep time. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices. I served over couscous with lamb chops. I am looking forward to the leftovers.

I made this when my daughter, who is vegetarian, visited.  I used red curry, doubled all spices, threw in some grated ginger & added lamb cubes for the non-vegetarians.  VegHeads & Carnivores both gave rave reviews.  Will definitely make again, thanks much!

What I liked about this recipe was the variety of the vegetables as they provided different textures; the smooth and spongy eggplant, slight crunch of the almonds and the other vegetables each having their unique feel in the mouth.  I was a failure preparing this as directed though.  I only had some of the vegies, threw everything in a pot and added a can of coconut milk.  Welcome to my world.

Lots of chopping but a very flavorful and colorful vegetable dish. My husband would have preferred if I had peeled the eggplant, but I did not find the skin offensive in the least. We ate this without rice or couscous

Super yummy! I only gave it 4 stars because my husband wasn't that into it (and he loves this sort of stuff). But I couldn't stop eating it! I didn't have any oj on hand so I added 2 tablespoons of sugar for sweetness. I can't wait to make it again with oj!

This was a very filling and nutritious meatless meal.  I like the fact that my children loved it and asked for more.  I omitted the almonds due to allergies and the raisins because I didn't have any.  I used kale instead of spinach because that's what we had on hand.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe and I liked the finished result.  This makes a lot.

I've tried this recipe tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  Easy and healthy.  The flavors really pack a punch.  It is a little sweet because of the yam and carrots. It's a thicker soup which is what I prefer and I also added an additional can of chick peas.  Based on other reviews, I really kicked it up with a lot of the spices.  After I added a lot of the spices and I tasted it, I added even more.  Next time I make it I will add crumbled up hot italian pork sausage or half hot and half sweet.  Since I'm a big fan of quinoa, I cooked some up on the side and added it to the soup.  Delicious and healthy (maybe not with the sausage, but hey we have to indulge once in awhile).  Substituting the spinach with kale would be a killer.  Enjoy!







































  Enjoy!

So delicious! It got absolute rave reviews, even from someone who doesn't enjoy curry very much... it's a keeper. The flavours are incredible, a little spicy and sweet, and a bit creamy from the sweet potato texture. I used fresh orange juice and added a bit extra to make more sauce, and I'm very glad that I did, because the sauce was out of this world. I made this a meat dish by adding some chicken breast pieces (sauteed separately with powdered poultry seasoning, salt & pepper in olive oil), and did not use eggplant or almonds because I didn't have them available. Still a 5-star dish. Served over fragrant jasmine white rice. Super-yum! And amazing served the next day (it does make a lot! I halved the recipe to serve 3 people, and it was way more than enough).

Excellent! Instead of 2 cups of OJ I used 2 1/2 cups of OJ and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. I also substituted the red bell pepper with a small yellow squash. So much flavor and this makes a lot!

What a fabulous receipe!  I cut all of my veggies ahead of time, which made the actual peparation of the dish a breeze.  I served this with a side of freshly made quinoa - great compliment to this already wonderful dish.

Delicious recipe with lots of flavor! I took the advice of others and added some extra spice. I liked it that way, though it would have been plenty flavorful without it. I would suggest adding a little more almonds - they added such a nice texture contrast, and I wanted a little more of that. Wonderful meal!

I made this exactly as stated and I enjoyed it. The season sauce mix and the cup of OJ are the staple behind this recipe. I feel that the spice mix was a perfect blend. After having made this I think that the vegetables could easily be interchangeable with other choices, i.e. what is available on hand. Some of the more expensive elements, such as the almonds I found were entirely unnecessary and I couldn't tell they were in there after having cooked.  Bonus to this recipe, the leftovers taste better than it does fresh.

This dish had terrific flavor--it got better each day I ate it as leftovers!  It's so flexible, too; I don't like raisins, so I left them out, and I used walnuts instead of almonds.  Varied the veggies, too.  Just the right amount of spice for us.

Fantastic dish. The seasoning was fantastic. I didn't have a dutch oven so I cooked it in a 5 gallon stainless steel pot. It took a bit longer to cook but it came out great. I served it with couscous. All around a fantastic recipe.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I will definitely make this again and maybe change the vegetables a little. I  cut the sweet potato into a small dice since someone mentioned that it takes longer to cook than the other indigence and I'm glad that I did.  I put it a slow cooker (just for serving) which worked out very well.

I had nearly all of these ingredients in my fridge & was trying to find something to make with them before they went bad; stumbled across this & it's very good! my only issue was that the sweet potato must not have been cut small enough b/c it took forever to cook relative to everything else in the pot.

I was disappointed considering all the favorable reviews.  It wasn't bad, just lacking in any real flavor.  I like the combo of all the veggies so maybe I would consider it again and up the spice level.

The flavors were too complex for my family and kids. I might try it again in the future, but minus a few of the ingredients - such as the raisins.

Speechless!! It was so delicious. My sister in law is vegetarian and we selected this dish for our Thanksgiving dinner. We are going to make it pretty often. No changes or substitutions were made.

Very tasty and flavourful! My favourite part was when I froze a good portion of it and reheated it, it tasted exactly the same. I'd love to know where all the fat in this recipe comes from. The olive oil and almonds I guess? Also, I used pecans instead of almonds as it's what I had on hand. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious if you like curry. I do, but think I will add about half of what's called for next time. And there will be a next time! Another great thing about this was that I was able to use many ingredients fresh from the garden... Eggplant, zucchini, onions, carrots, all picked fresh for this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This was very tasty, and a nice change. I did not have spinach, so I used arugula. And I had to skip the zucchini as I did not have any, and skipped the cayenne because the kids can't handle the heat. I also had to use navy beans instead of garbanzos. So lots of substitutions. I wish I'd had some ginger, that would have been lovely. I did not double the spices, though I could easily have done so I suppose. I didn't really feel like they needed to be doubled necessarily, but it would have tasted good that way too.

Deelish and even better the next day! Other than adding more of the spices, I made the recipe exactly as written.  The almonds added a nice crunch and the sweetness of the raisins blended perfectly with the spiced veggies. Very simple, will make again!

As a caterer, I utilize Allrecipes very often. I had occasion to find Morracan recipes for a fund raiser we did, and I came across Marrakesh Vegetable Curry. It was very well received by the guests, and surprised a few at how delicious it was. We followed the recipe, as is our custom with first time recipes, and in the future, we will not change a thing! It was delicious from the start.

I used the recommended carrot/ginger juice, omitted the chopped carrots, used cashews instead of almonds, and coconut oil instead of olive oil.  The complexity of flavors was awesome!  My husband loved it, and he's normally a meat-and-potatoes man.  He couldn't believe this was a vegan dish.  We will be making this again!!

Love this! I made it almost exactly like the recipe instructed. The only changes I made were that I was out of carrots, so i used an extra sweet potato and I used blanched peanuts instead of almonds- again, because that is what I had on hand. It was so yummy! Even my kids enjoyed it. Will definitely make again- it is perfect vegetarian comfort food!

I took the advice of others. I doubled the curry, turmeric and garlic.  I also put 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I served this over rice.  Is good as a stew as well

I've made this curry 3 times in the past week!  The great thing is that there are so many vegetables in this recipe that if you don't have one of them on hand it won't be missed.  We have found that we even like the leftovers served cold.  Had to make substitutions and omissions as we can't easily get red bell pepper or spinach.  So just left it out and used the local green leafy vegetable that is regularly available. I am having to use dried chick peas, so it takes a little longer but they really are good in the dish.  Make sure to simmer in the orange juice with the lid on!

Awesome! I like mildly spicy and this was perfect seasoning.  Definitely would make again. My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes so I only used half of one and then he admitted I couldv'e used the entire potato because the taste is all blended into one. I used thawed frozen spinach and just rung out all the liquid.

This is the first curry dish I have ever made and it was a huge hit.  It is such an interesting, delicious mixture of flavors and textures.  Prior to making, I had some reservations as we are generally meat-eaters, but it is so hearty and satisfying you do not feel you are missing a thing.  My whole family loved it !!  I will definitely make again!

I made it with a few things missing that I didn't have on hand, but despite my fears about the orange juice and raisins, it was just delicious.  I'm going to make it again with as many ingredients I missed before as possible.  I can't judge its authenticity but we sure liked it!

This recipe was amazing! It's very rare that a recipe I read online ends up having the taste I want. But this curry was exactly what I was looking for. However, I only gave it 4 stars because the other reviewers were right in that the spices needed to be doubled. I also added a tablespoon of powdered ginger. Other than that though, all the correct curry flavorings are there.

I agree that this recipe is a "keeper" I followed the instructions--with the exception of adding an extra sweet potato and an extra eggplant--just because I wanted to get rid of them. I served Israeli Couscous with it. I thought the spice level was fine; Spicy and sweet. My husband doesn't like chickpeas but he went back to the pot 3 times!!

Tasty, but next time I will definitely double the spices, because they are a little unnoticeable. Need to add water or more orange juice, because the liquid evaporated quickly. Overall, this is a great way to prepare vegetables.

Made a HUGE amount.  Need to at least double the spices for my taste.  Sweet potatoes were a bit under done but that could just be the size I cut them. Would probably make again.

Great recipe!  all my roommates loved it!  I added some veggie broth to make it a little saucy-er-- doubled the spices to make it a little more intense.  Great flavors!  Served it up over a bed of spinach and cilantro with toasted pita on the side for dinner and it was great served cold the same way the next day! I will definitely be adding this to my repertoire!

Also threw in tempeh!  and it gave the recipe a little bit more umf!  Also, used 8 oz can of tomato sauce and mixed it w/ the spices, as well as some sour cream, just to give the curry a creamier texture. That and I love curry w/ tomato :)  Great Recipe!  Thanks :)

Yum!  My teenage daughter made this one evening for dinner and we had it with rice on the side.  We didn't have spinach but it was fine without, and we only had half the curry powder but it was still wonderfully tasty.  My dear daughter says next time we add more raisins!

very healthy, somewhat bland. Keeps well and good for meals at home, not elegant enough for a dinner party.

Very nice, though my sweet-tooth husband added a pinch of sugar while it simmered.

Very good.  I didn't use the yellow pepper, beans, or spinach and added a tsp of chopped ginger.  Otherwise made as is.  While there is a lot of chopping involved, it is a pretty quick dish and very flavorful.  Would make again.

I really liked this recipe! To me this curry had very authentic taste. I am sure it can take many substitutions in terms of vegetables and beans used without adverse effect, so you can use veggies that you have on hand. Chopping them up wasn't that hard or time consuming. I did not change the amount of spices or oil and it wasn't bland or greasy at all. It was just right. It really makes a ton. Will definitely make again.

My family absolutely loved this!  I needed to use up a lot of vegetables since we'll be going on vacation and this was perfect.  I also added mushrooms and jalapeno peppers but sweet potatoes aren't in season so didn't use those.  I'm sure I'll be making this a lot!

Excellent!  This was my first experience making any type of curry and everyone loved it, husband included.  We mixed it with thin spaghetti for dinner and the next day it was great alone as a sandwich filling.

Good, and really really healthy, too!! I added more of all the spices listed, and added some coriander and mace as well. As with all the curries I've tried making at home, it improves overnight. Try this the next day made as a sandwich between two slices of warm, slightly buttered bread. Thanks for the recipe!!

I like it. but my husband did not. And since i'm not a converted vegetarian yet - (what? my husband just said... and i say - the Lion and the Lamb shall lie down together... in the future it's veggies and chick peas for us)... anyway, i'm not vegetarian yet... so i won't be making this one anytime soon... but i did like it.

i halved the cayenne as im a wimp, but think i will put entire amount called for next time i make it. also i didnt have blanched almonds but would blanch and rub off the skins next time for the recipe.  I used the entire amount of spinach called for, but next time i would chop it up instead of leaving the leaves whole, maybe into one inch strips. It just wasnt appetizing after reheating it especially. I would definitely still add it for the vitamins and nice green color! Even a non veggie person in this household ate his entire serving ;) i made this over basmati saffron rice. the curry lover in the family said he'd eat this everyday. Be wary of the curry spice paste, it even stains silicone spatulas fluorescent yellow!

Loved this recipe.  My vegan husband was very happy with this dinner. :-)  I made brown basmati rice and put the veggies over it.  This dish was so flavorful!

Thanks Leah--Love it! I really wanted to leave out the raisins, orange juice & almonds but I'm so glad that I made the recipe as is!! The heavy OJ flavor faded as it simmered and everything worked well together. Of course I left out the garlic & added extra spices especially curry and also ginger. I will definitely try it with carrot ginger juice next time.

Even my non-vegatarian meat and potatoes roommate loved it.  I hate eggplant but gave it a try and it turned out so good I make it often.

This recipe was great...I would definetely have been pleased with it at an Indian restaurant.  I would, however, recommend multiplying the spices by 1.5 times, doubling or tripling the raisins (I used golden raisins and they got wonderfully plump!)and maybe adding another can of garbanzos.  The chopping didn't take as long as I thought it would, but recruiting a friend or family member to help isn't a bad idea!  Leftovers were wonderful the next day as well.

I loved this recipe!!  It was amazing how well it turned out.  It is even better the next day because the flavors mesh more into the vegetables.  The flavor of the spices are wonderful.  I didn’t add raisins because I don’t care for them in my dishes but, honestly, I felt like I was eating at an African restaurant.  I live in San Francisco and I have been to many African restaurants.  Believe me-this is a great recipe!

Wonderful flavors, and so easy to make! I don't understand why everyone's complaining about chopping some vegetables, it's not that bad! All of my guests loved this recipe, and I have already passed it on to a couple people.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is because it's the first thing I've cooked from this website.
The combination of differently colored vegetables was beautiful and the taste of the tumeric, curry, and cayenne combined was delicious (but a little spicy for the untrained mouth).  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that's looking for a simple, filling, tasty, especially vegetarian meal.
