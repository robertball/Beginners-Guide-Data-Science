I made this exactly as it is written. Delicious!  I added 1 tblsp of soy sauce the second time I made it like someoneâ€™s comment suggested and it was even better.  Perfect for my low carb diet.

The flavor of this was good except the "hot" was missing. After tasting it I added some chili and garlic paste. Sriracha or crushed chili flakes would work too. I used can shiitakes instead of the dry and next time I would just double up on them and leave the cloud ear out altogether unless I could find fresh. For me, dried shrooms taste what a band-aid smells like. Overall good recipe but I think you need to add some heat.
