This was really surprisingly tasty! I used plain ol' bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean), browned it and then just added the veggies at that point rather than removing the sausage or adding additional oil. I 1/2" diced both the sweet potatoes and two LARGE red bell peppers, and boiled the potatoes 10 minutes -- anything more would have been mush. It makes a lot more than 4 servings in my opinion. Pita bread worked well with it, and I could see leftovers rolled in whole wheat tortillas as well. I might try a veggie sausage next time as this is so close to being a very healthy vegetarian recipe.

i thought this was good. i will make it again. however, the type of salsa you use makes a huge difference in the recipe. so be warned use a good salsa, it makes and breaks the recipe. period.

I was looking for a recipe for peppers and sausage because my girls really like those ingredients but when I saw this recipe I had to try it because I am not as fond of peppers.

I really liked this.  I liked how the salsa brought everything together.  I used "Gimme Lean" vegetarian sausage.

My dh used chorizo for his portion.  When I asked him if it was 4 or 5 stars, he said "10!"

Awesome dish! I roasted my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them as I find boiling them tends to take away most of their flavour. This was great the day of, but leftovers were even better.

The adults at the table all loved this recipe. So different and yet so good! Even with the peeling and chopping of the potatoes this dish was ready in 30 minutes- my idea of a good meal. The children were less enthusiastic. But that's because they believe all sweet potatoes should be mashed and very sweet. To get them to eat it, I wrapped theirs with sour cream in tortillas, burrito style.

This was a great recipe. I boiled the sweet potatoes for 11 minutes and they were perfect. Instead of italian sausage, I used italian seasoned turkey sausage to make it a little bit healthier. I used spicy chipotle salsa in mine. (I used a 17.5 oz jar...8 would not have been enough.) Chipotle goes really well with sweet potatoes. It wasn't terribly time consuming and it was really easy to make. I added a dab of reduced fat sour cream to the top-delish. I also felt that it was more than 4 servings; more like 6. My friend who had never had sweet potatoes before really enjoyed this dish. I will absolutely make it again.

I really wasn't sure what this was going to be like, but I had sweet potatoes, red bell peppers and leeks in my CSA box last week.  I used the leeks instead of the onions and garlic and I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave,otherwise as written.  It is one of the most colorful dishes I've ever made and was a nice mix of sweet, savory and spicy.  It's fall in a bowl!

Very, very tasty! I used the pre-packaged 'seasoning blend' of veggies (onions, bell peppers, celery) which made it that much easier. Will make again and again.

This was truly delicious! And as my husband said, very colorful and beautiful for a fall dinner! It is a nice, if surprising, mix of flavors that is very satisfying. We served it with a green salad and it was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Made this dish last night for dinner.  Only had green bell peppers on hand, so I used that.  I diced up and boiled separately while cutting up rest of veggies.  I also added some garlicand used turkey sausage (not the crumbling kind).  Maybe that is what turned it a bit.  My 5 yr old thought it was too spicy (even with the mild salsa).  I somewhat liked it, esp over rice.  I might make this again, but only if I'm not the one who has to eat it all.  Chances of that in my house is very likely since no one else likes salsa.

This was awesome! I've made this several times for friends and family. Everyone loved it. There is always a lot of food at the table but this always manages to take the spotlight. My older sister is pretty picky when it comes to food but she is always begging me to make this. I left out the salsa, cumin, garlic, salt and pepper. The sausage gave it all the flavor it needed. I really enjoy this recipe and look forward to making it again.

Interesting blend of flavors.  Savory and sweet.  I tried to heed Suze's warnings of less time for the potatoes.  I cooked them less than 10 minutes and still had mush!   When the weather cools off I might try roasting the potatoes instead.  Thanks Trinity for the recipe !

Very nice and easy to make.  I used new potatoes as I didn't have any sweet potatoes and it was very tastey.

Not as tasty as I thought it would be.  The sweet potatoes do not seem to go  well with this dish.  I would have liked it with rice instead.

Very good! I saute the onions and sausage, then add the sweet potatoes.  When the sweet potatoes are tender, I add the peppers and salsa. Truly one-pan!  Today I used chili-seasoned tomato sauce in place of the salsa, and added a few black beans.  A versatile,  forgiving, tasty, pantry-friendly, and healthy recipe. (I use turkey Italian sausage.) Who could ask for more?!

Made this for dinner tonight and everyone liked it! I always make recipes exactly as the recipe states the first time thru, and this turned out very good. I served it over plain white rice. I think the only thing I will change the next time I make it is to add one more red pepper and a bit more salsa. This is a very good recipe!

This was ok overall. Purchased a good gourmet salsa to go with it so that helped. The sweet potatoes could have used a little help/seasoning. It wasn't the best way to present them palate wise in my opinion.

I am sure it would be wonderful as is, but I used roasted red pepper turkey sausage. It tasted great and was very easy to make!

I was looking for something hearty and nutritious, and this easy "throw it all in" recipe surpassed my expectations for something so simple. The flavors worked together really well. I didn't have salsa, so I just used diced tomatoes and added chile powder and paprika to enhance the Mexican flavor of the dish.   Colorful, delicious, satisfying, and easy. What else could you ask for??

I roasted the sweet potatoes (much more flavorful!), added some black beans, and instead of salsa used Mexican diced tomatoes then put the mixture in a wheat tortilla with some rice to make a yummy burrito. The hubs loved it!

Loved it! I did however, used regular potatoes. I didn't have sweet potatoes...but still delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I followed the recipe pretty close. I went ahead and diced the potatoes into the size I wanted...boiled them 10 minutes like someone suggested so when I drained them they were ready to put into the skillet with a dash of oil for browning before adding the sausage, onions and peppers back in. A definite dinner...over and over! Thanks!

I was looking for a receipe for the sweet potatoes that were getting old in the fridge.  This worked out great.  I had frozen hot italian sausage in the freezer which gave it a great kick.  I didn't have cumin so I substituted chili powder and all I had was red onions.  I really love the flavors - hot from the sausage and sweet from the potatoes.  Great comfort food not good for the diet though...I wanted to eat the whole skillet.

Followed one person's suggestion to roast my sweet potatoes instead of boiling, and I think that made all of the difference.  Also chose roasted red pepper chicken sausage and Mrs. Renfro's roasted salsa. The combination, along with a little shredded cheese on top was delicious.  Definitely going to make again!

Good recipe but could use more ground sausage.  I used 1 lb but 2 lbs would be better.  I am not a big fan of peppers but my husband is so he liked it more than I did.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I happened to have some brussel sprouts in the fridge so I threw them in with the peppers and onions, and they were a fabulous addition to the recipe.

Definitely, try this recipe!  A very nice recipe. I hesitate to rate it down because I don't care for the Salsa in it.  Sweet Potatoes and salsa is a strange combination.  The first night I made it, I forgot the salsa and preferred it that way. The second night I added the salsa.

I thought this was pretty good.  Definitely use a salsa you like--the salsa is the predominant flavor in this.  I didn't see the need for oil with the sausage or after the sausage.  Even after making sure the grease of the sausage was out of the pan, there was just enough left to ensure that the peppers and garlic didn't stick (I didn't use onions).  I do have a non stick pan, so with another pan some oil might be necessary with the pepper mixture, but I would argue the sausage doesn't need oil to cook at all in any pan--it's already greasy.  The sweet potatoes were definitely done at about 10 minutes--they would've turned to mush after that.  Other than peeling and dicing the sweet potatoes (always a workout for me!) this was a relatively quick and easy dinner.  You could always prepare the sausage and sweet potatoes ahead of time, which is what I did, then put everything else together 20 minutes before you want dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe had a lot going for it but when it came time to serve it I ended up having to make some additions. It really needed some extra spices. The cumin just wasn't enough. I added brown sugar and ginger on top before I served it. It made the flavors really pop and it wasn't so bland.

Excellent.  Be prepared for a lot of chopping.  I used Aidele’s Italian Link sausage. Cooked as directed on package and then sliced.  Be careful not to over cook sweet potato.   May use more than 8 oz of chunky salsa, so the dish is not too dry.   A nice blend of flavors.

This was pretty good as written.  However the sweet potato was overcooked even at 10 minutes.  The addition of some fennel flavor in some form would be good.

This dish is really good and my husband, who is a picky eater, really loved it too.  I use a peach and mango salsa which adds a little sweetness.  I either use pork mild italian sausage or chicken italian sausage.

Pretty decent. I wasn't keen on the idea of salsa, so instead I added black beans as someone suggested (great idea!) and diced tomatoes (as someone else suggested (another great idea!) and sweet corn. I also roasted the sweet potatoes and uses spicy Italian sausage. Created a bit of a stew. It's good. Next time might add some shredded cheese on top. Agree with one person's comment that sweet potatoes could use some help flavor wise. The cumin wasn't quite enough.

We used a full pound of sausage and baked the sweet potatos for 30 minutes, to make peeling and chopping easier.  Also used a mixture of red, yellow and green peppers, since we didn't have enough of just the red.  SO good.  Next time, we will add some corn!

We found it to be too gooey in its texture. Followed the directions exactly, but the sweet potatoes were way overdone. Daughter didn't like it at all.

Really loved this recipe! The flavors were delicious, and it was so easy to prepare! Didn't really change much although i did find as some others did that I needed more salsa than the recipe called for.

An interesting side note, the day after my boyfriend made an omelette and filled it with some of the leftovers, I tried some and it was truly amazing!!!  I think that will become the standard thing to do with these leftovers!

I was surprised by how much I liked this dish. Would not have thought to combine sweet potatoes + salsa + sausage. I used frozen sliced bell peppers/onion mix so there was very little prep work required. I will probably roast the potatoes next time for better flavor. I slightly overcooked them when boiling the first time and they fell apart in the final dish. This was even better leftover the next day. Will definitely make this one again!

This is really yummy!!!   I made 1/2 the recipe and it was plenty for two.  I also made my own salsa in my Magic Bullet.  Oh and I used sweet italian chicken sausage instead of italian sausage.  I think whether you follow the recipe or use your own creativity this is delish.

This is really good! We used Jack's Thick and Chunky salsa and had used a slotted spoon to get rid of some of the liquid before we put it in.  Also took some Tostito's Multigrain Scoop chips and ate it with those and it was great to get some crunch in there! Only boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes and that was plenty.

I made this last night but tweaked it a bit.  I am gluten intolerant so I made it with organic chicken sausage (spicy) and instead of the peppers I used diced red delicious apples (skin on).  I added a little cinnamon into the apples before I threw them into the pan.  It was so good.  My honey even went back not only for seconds...but for thirds!

Has an interesting combination of flavors.  Would do without the salsa next time.  Perhaps I would substitutt with a can of diced tomato instead.

The combination of flavors was a little weird but I expected that. My husband liked it and I was shocked! We wrapped this mixture in warm tortillas and added cheese and sour cream to make a fajita like meal. Overall it was not bad but not great. I probably won't make it again.

Wow, this meal was supposed to be one made with random bits from the pantry, and I did not expect to fall in love with this dish the way that I did.  Great job on this recipe. Works well with white potatoes (cooked a little longer) too. I LOVE it.

This was good.  It was quick.  My husband requested the next time I use link Italian sausage cut up into chunks rather then the ground sausage.  He's a real meat eater and the ground sausage makes the meal almost seem meatless.

I was really excited about this recipe until I added the salsa.  Then I really doubted it and I was sure it wasn't going to be good after all.   And then I tasted it and couldn't belive how delicious it was.  It's a new favorite and it's really so easy!

Pretty dang good. Its different and very flavorful, and fun to make and eat! We ate it over rice with sour cream, and later I tried parmesan on top- I preferred that. My family loved it and I will make again.

This turned out great and was super easy to make. I cut down prep time by cooking the sausage and dicing the peppers& onions while I was waiting for the potatoes to boil and then threw everything in together. It turned out great.I used green peppers in stead of red since that was what was on hand and I left out the cumin since the salsa was pretty spicy on its own. I served it over white rice since we had it on hand and it was great. Some people ate as a stand alone the meal with out the rice. The left overs were great the next day for lunch, it reheats in the microwave well. Will definetly be making again!

I was nervous about the combo of flavors, but this was really good. I used Vegetarian Italian Sausage by Tofurky and cut the salsa in half because the sausage is already so spicy.

So, this was such an odd combination of flavors, but it was still good. I sliced the hot Italian sausages and cooked them separately trying to keep a portion veg friendly. I used leeks for the onions because they needed to be used. Per reviews saying the salsa was an odd mix, I used a sweet corn salsa, but added a bit of cayenne pepper to keep the heat factor. Added the sausage to half, topped all with chopped cilantro and white onion....then had shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on the side, which was a good addition. Contrary to Mom's starch teaching, I served it over rice...per reviews...and it was a hit!  Afterwards I remember I wanted to add black beans, but I'll save that for next time! Thank you for a cool, unique dinner!

Made this in a in about 30 minutes plus. Great taste. I did substitute green beans for the sweet potato. My picky eater loved this for dinner.

We loved this - just want see regular pork sausage and it made a wonderful fast dinner.  The salsa really makes it - I used Pace brand.  Leftovers were excellent with eggs for breakfast.

This recipe doesn't sound appetizing at all.  But, based on the reviews, I made it.  It was delicious!  My husband went back for seconds and said he'd like to have it again.

I added mushrooms only because, like bacon, I believe mushrooms can be “a Food transformer”! But, I must say, even without the mushrooms this recipe is a keeper!

I enjoyed this dish. Lots of healthy ingredients and pretty quick to make from start to finish.
* I will say, I did not like it with the salsa * 
I will make it again but use something else to tie it all together. It gave it a weird taste in my opinion.

I had everything but salsa. so I diced up a tomato and squeezed a lime onto it. Fantastic! Love the sweet potato ,instead of my usual egg noodles.

I made this for my very picky, veggie hating husband, a teenager and my 2 year old son (and myself who has a gluten allergy). A tough crowd to cook for. Everyone cleared their plates! I never reviewed a recipe before but this was so well received, easy and convenient that I just had to. I did make a few changes: I roasted the sweet potatoes and cooked up a pound of bulk italian sausage, left the juices and added frozen pepper and onion mix just before the sausage was fully cooked. Once cooked, I removed the juices to mix in a small amount of cornstarch and added the mixture back in along with the roasted potatoes and salsa. I didn't add any extra salt since the potatoes were salty enough. I served over black rice cooked in broth, making sure to add some he thickened juices. Yum!

Liked it! Substitutions bkz of lack of ingredients were a can of petite diced tomatoes for the salsa and sliced sausage instead of crumbles. To keep warm, I just put everything in the oven at 350.

New favorite!  I found this recipe while searching for something to use the only ingredients I had on hand.  I diced the sweet potato fairly fine and just cooked it in the pan with the sausage drippings (adding a few splashes of beef broth when it started sticking).  Then I threw in a bag of frozen grilled peppers and onions (red, yellow, & green peppers) which made it super easy.  Used Frontera roasted corn salsa to finish, but it tasted great even without that.  Served it over rice for the family, and no rice for me for a lower carb version.  Can't wait to have the leftovers with a fried egg for breakfast.

Delicious! I used mild Italian sausages and baked and sliced them (instead of using ground sausage). Served this on top of rice with a dollop of sour cream and couldn't be happier.

Followed the recipe exactly. Easy and delish! Since you have options about spiciness level (kind of sausage, kind of salsa), I opted for mild sausage and a mix of mild and hot salsa. Wee bit of a runny nose. Just how we like it!

This is one of my go-to recipes at the fire station. Everyone loves it paired with a southwest salad.  I follow the recipe as written. Don't use plain Jimmy Dean sausage with this. Use Italian sausage for the best flavor.

Baked the sweet potatoes.. took advice from a few of the comments. Easier to peel skin off after baked also.
Used Mild Salsa
Used alot more garlic  ( when u tell an italian to use 2 cloves,  we use 10.. or whole bulb! Ha!)
A beautiful fall dish.
High protein, low fat! 
Didn't use salt.. the salsa and italian sausage had enough.. 
This will be my lunch all week..
Thank u!

I made this dish and it was great!!  The only substitute that I did was I used Chef Bruce Aidells Italian style with mozzarella chicken meatballs and cut them in half as they are pretty large.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I made jasmine rice to go with the meal.  My family loved it, definitely a keeper??

Simple and easy.  I used a mix of Sweet Italian chicken sausage and Sweet Italian pork sausage.  Very good!  Really awesome as leftovers.

Next time, I will add more sausage.  Perhaps 1.5X recommended.

Love this!! I used chicken sausage w tomato & basil (no pork eaters in my house), medium organic salsa, yellow & red peppers, & left out the salt & pepper at the end. I'm always looking for different ways to cook sweet potatoes, and this recipe is awesome!! Definitely a keeper, & possibly perfect for potlucks! Thanks for posting!

This dish was really, really good! I made a few changes like roasting the sweet potatoes, using a medium-spiced salsa, and used both a green and red bell pepper. I will definitely make the dish a 2nd and 3rd time. Thanks for sharing!!

First time I made exact,  2nd time because we realy liked it 
We  thick sliced to the potatoes, added onions and red peppers in a foil pack with a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and oozed them on the grill until the potatoes were just tender about 10 in, as we love foil pack grilled sweet potato this way we thought why not and added the peppers and onions as we suspected the smokiness from grilling added to this dish  DELIOUS

This recipe is so delicious and easy to make! My husband requests it every week. Every time I make it the dish comes out a bit different, mainly because I switch up ingredients every now and then. 
The first time I made it I added a little bit of green pepper and did not put in salsa. It was a bit dry but still yummy. I added paprika, extra garlic, Italian seasoning and lots of cheese!
Today I'm trying it with green and orange peppers (cannot find red ones anywhere!!)

I substituted ground turkey for the sausage and added one green pepper. Over all really good, I definitely recommend larger cuts for potatoes and shorter cooking time.

I accidentally bought kielbasa sausage so I cubed it and threw it in with the veggies at the same time and cooked them altogether. We loved it!

I swapped out the salsa for a cup of chicken stock and threw some chili powder in there. Pretty good!

I thought this recipe was very good. I used coconut oil intead of vegetable oil because my husband is paleo.  I thought the flavors married well. I did get the sweet potatoes too mushy, even though I had read the reviews and tried really hard not to.  I will make it again.

No one in my house would eat it. It has potential. I put it in pita bread and it was ok.

My family loved this!  We put the mixture in soft corn tortillas, my son wanted his in a burrito with a flour tortilla.  I used a 1 lb. Jimmy Dean sausage and used the red, yellow and green mini bell peppers.  I used yams that I had and prepared them according to the directions and they were just fine, not mushy at all.  Definitely will make this again.

Delicious! Made this for my family last night and it was absolutely delicious! Only change I made was to make the potato ingredients into a side dish so it was a complete meal.

Made this dish last night and it was pretty good. I boiled the sweet potatoes and then tossed them in my cast iron to brown them a little before adding in the veggies and ground meat. Nice dish to make during a busy week.

Awesome recipe!  Per other reviewers, I left out the cheese.  I ended up changing up the veggies based on what I had on hand (1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, yellow sauash, zuchini and onions).  I will make again with whatever is fresh, the spices and texture would go well with a wide range of vegetables.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was, okay. Boyfriend gave it a B+.  My Problem with it was the sweet potatoes became extremely extremely mushy and just ruined the texture of the meal. I would STRONGLY suggest to just add the potatoes right before serving, if you time it right the potatoes will still be hot when you add them to the bowl. Also ran out of Cumin so I used Chili Powder and Coriander.  Overall was a good meal.

I really enjoyed this meal and it tasted even better as leftovers.  The only problem I have with it, is that it wasn't very filling.

We used a bit of spicy salsa with the chunky salsa to give it that extra kick! This was delicious as the main course and as a microwaved lunch the next day! I found it a bit mushy, but we added extra salsa so that's probably why - it didn't take away from the deliciousness.

Delicious!  I used vegetarian sausage (found at my local grocery store) to turn it into a vegetarian recipe!  The whole family loved it!

We really liked this recipe.  I think that next time, we will substitute a green bell pepper for one of the red ones.  Also, I will probably increase the amount of sausage that I use.

It took me a while to peel, cut, and dice everything. The potatoes cooked in 8 minutes. I cooled the potatoes before cutting them into 1-1/2inch squares. I also thought there was something missing. I added 2TBLS Sofrito, 1/4 can of diced tomatoes with chillies and the liquid from that can. Still, something missing, so I added some duck sauce-- 3TBLS. PERFECT! Thanks for the interesting combination of ingredients.I'd have never thought of it on my own.

This recipe was easy to make, and delicious!! I made just a few tweaks, just because I wanted to use up some ingredients I had in the house...I only used 1 large sweet potato (and definitly 8 minutes boiling was plenty), boneless breast of chicken chopped (it was good, but I'll try the sausage or boneless chicken thighs next time), and 1 red pepper (again, just because this is what I had in the kitchen). There was plenty of potato, but another pepper (even yellow or green) would be good. I used Newman's Own Pineapple salsa, which gave a very nice hint of sweetness. Makes a nice looking dish!

This was absolutely delicious.  All my guys liked it too.  We're a family that has to have some spice to our dinner and so I used a very hot salsa which made it a hit for us.  I served this with rice and the only drawback was that it wasn't saucy enough.  I do recommend though to have this as a side dish...say like for "Thanksgiving" .  I will experiment a little to see if I can find a way to make it a little saucier (maybe some tomatoe juice?)  Definitely worth trying!!!!

Am giving my son a few cooking lessons -- we made this for dinner tonight -- a good "beginner" recipe and very tasy.
