I used caramel not caramel sauce and cashews; it was great. Carmel sauce would have made a gooey mess. Leaving out the caramel would have made microwaved cake batter. It's important to follow directions

This isn't the traditional fudge, and I chose to leave out the optional caramel and cashews. I had no problem with the batter consistency, but this isn't a recipe I would make again.

Made as directed, and it was a gooey mess. You can't even cut this into squares.
