I loved this.  After chopping, I put the items in the blender, but wish I hadn't.  I chopped everything small enough to work out fine and should have left it as is.  After blending slightly the color turns to a hideous shade of greeny-brown.  however, the taste is delicious, nice and spicy and the flavors go well together.  Had it with baked goat cheese and mmmmmm, good!

This recipe is great!  I wasn't sure what to expect mixing the taste of salsa with fruit- but what a great mix! Everyone that's tasted it has asked for the recipe!

The salsa came out delicious. My son,12, who usually won't touch anything hot, liked it. And the adults couldn't have enough. Definitely a winner.

My guests couldn't believe the ingredients to this one; the flavors combine for a surprisingly wonderful taste. I prefer chunkier salsas so didn't leave it too long in the food processor. It's a great recipe!

I was a little puzzled at how the ingredients would come together at first, but received such rave reviews!  It's just the right amount of sweet + kick to make for a refreshiing variation on the old, overdone salsa standard.  This is a great summer salsa recipe that will be sure to break the mold at your picnics and parties... It's also easy and quick, to boot!

I made this for a salsa competition and we came in 2nd place!  I just chopped up everything tiny and put the orange slices and kiwi in a blender (separately) and pulsed them a couple times to get them to a mush.

It's a favorite at every party I take it to!  One recommendation, add one jalapeno first and then the 2nd a little at a time.  It's pretty spicy with 2 jalapenos.

What a surprise! This salsa is wonderful with a kick! I add a clove of garlic and puree into a thick liquid. I have also found that the flavors meld better if allowed to sit for a couple hours before serving.

This is delicious!  I added the juice of a lime, red pepper flakes (for more kick), and salt/pepper.  I tripled the recipe for 6 people and almost all of it was eaten!

I made this for a potluck at church and everyone loved it!! I did the recipe exactly as written except I chopped everything instead of using the blender because we like our salsa chunky. the colors were much better than the blended verson that turns out greenish. I went to the store after church and we made another batch for just the family. I love how you taste the refreshing kiwi/orange and then the heat of the jalapeno at the end!  AWESOME!

A hit at the party. I didn't use the cilantro because I don't like it. I doubled the recipes except only used one large jalepeno pepper and it was delicious. So many asked for the recipe and couldn't believe the ingredients. I was dubious, but now I am a believer. Try it.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit!  I loved the spicy against the sweet tastes.  TRY IT, it's fun to feed to people because no one can guess the ingredients.  Fresh and light.

Love this salsa. The name implies more sweetness than you get. So the flavor was not what I expected, but truly delicious.

Everyone LOVED this salsa!  I halved the cilantro, cut back a bit on the onion and added an extra tomato and also mango to make it go a little further (to keep up with the demand!).  This recipe sounds like an odd combination of flavours but it works!

Unique salsa recipe.  The flavor is interesting (in a good way).  Downside is color - kind of gray/green.  Just be sure not to chop it too fine.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  It seemed that the avocado really overpowered the taste of it all (maybe it wasn't ripe enough?).  Would not make again.  Disappointed with this one - usually everything I make from this site is fantastic.

This seemed like a strange combination of flavors, but it really makes a wonderful salsa...complex-tasting with no unpleasant clash of flavors.  Very creative and delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! I made it for a group function and still get asked to this day where I got it! The thing I like most is it is so easy and you can scale the spicyness of the salsa by adding more or less Jalepeno that it calls for!

this is SO GOOD that we actually made it two nights in a row!  use sea salt instead of garlic salt.  :)  oh, and hand-chop your ingredients, then pulse HALF in the processor, for a chunkier, fresher flavor.  THIS is summer-in-a-bowl.  now to perfect my homemade grain-free tortilla chips...

My whole familty loves this salsa.  You need to add more garlic salt than you would think to get the combination sweet, spicy and salty.  Eat it like you would any salsa with your favorite tortilla chips.

This is excellent! I like the crunch the onions bring. I didn't have any kiwis so I used strawberries instead. Delicious!

Wonderful and colorful! Took to work for a "Fruit Party" and everyone loved it! (I work with alot of vegetarians and health conscious types so I made sure everything was organic...) Use lemon juice over the avacado slices to prevent their turning brown. Used a mango instead of kiwis (no kiwis in store) and even diced up watermelon slices and rasberries because I had bought them for another dish but decided to do this dish instead. I took it easy in the blender, preferring to leave everything is bit chunky for better presentation. Of course I also brought along organic Tortilla Chips. Easy, tasty, colorful and fun when everyone asks what's in it and want the recipe! I just send them to allrecipes.com!

This was amazingly delicious!  I made it with coconut shrimp tacos. I didn’t have any avocado or cilantro but it still turned great. If you don’t like spicy, maybe just add one jalapeño or leave them out altogether. I loved the spice but hubby had some issues with it.

No blender!!  I think chunky is better.
