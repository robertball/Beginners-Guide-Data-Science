I make this recipe for potlucks and it is a winner!  People always ask for the recipe and some will freak out when you tell them that it has cottage cheese in it!  lol

This was fabulous corn bread!  I substituted one can drained, whole kernel corn for the broccoli and added about one cup of grated cheddar cheese.  It came out very moist and tasty.  I think it would be good also with the addition of jalepeno peppers also.  Cook have cooked for probably another 5 minutes or so, I cooked for 30 minutes, but it was great!

This bread is tender, moist, and delicious.  I used onion powder in place of the onion, and also used fat free cottage cheese.  I will definitely be making this again.

Love this recipe!  I had lost the previous recipe I had for Broccoli cornbread, but this was better than the old one!  My daughter's both RAVED over it & my 19yr old wants it the day she returns from college to visit!

I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of cottage cheese, fresh broccoli, and one half cup butter.  Delicious, family raved!
