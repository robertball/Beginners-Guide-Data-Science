My kids loved this beef, I made tacos and they inhaled them! I added a whole can of Chipotle and pickled onions to balance out the flavors. I'm off for the summer so I let the meat go low n slow in the oven from frozen stew meat. This is gonna make Great Machaca to tomorrow morning for sure! Thank you Karie, you have a winner here!

Great recipe! I followed it exactly but used a bit more broth to get the right coverage in my crockpot and I also used a 7 oz. can of the chopped green chiles. We ate it on corn tortillas with pickled onions, cilantro, jalapeños, and lime. It was a huge hit and the best is there is plenty left over. Super easy to make. Thank you for sharing.

Made my own adobe sauce, and used jalapeños in substitution for chipotle peppers. This turned out to be a mild heat compared to what I expected. This would be great for teen children, and of course the parents! PS, definitely make the pickled onions to go on top. Delish!!

Made this recipe twice and both times it was great. I used bottom round the second time and it pulled much easier. Nice and spicy and a great easy grab and go part of most meals!

This needs more reviews!  It’s really good!  Has some heat to it.  I strained the meat before serving because it leaves a lot of broth, but that can be used for a soup later.  We ate it with burritos, sour cream, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, rice.

I make this recipe quite often and everyone always loved it.  I leave out the chiles in adobo sauce.
