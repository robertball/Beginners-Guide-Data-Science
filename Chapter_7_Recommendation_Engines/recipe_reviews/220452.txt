The raisins make it very sweet.  It's like a giant biscuit.  Perfect with corned beef and cabbage.

Wonderful St. Patty's Day treat! I made no changes to this recipe and it came out great. Although, I baked my soda bread for 55 minutes in the oven and the bottom was a little burnt. I would recommend cooking it for, maybe, 45-50 minutes.

This is delicious! At first I thought I did something wrong because it was my first time making it and the dough was a little crumbly. It tastes so sweet and perfect. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

It is so easy to prepare with basic ingredients. I seen earlier posts of it not cooking through, so I halved the dough in two and made 2 loaves. 

I didn't have buttermilk but I made my own with 1 cup milk + 1 tbsp vinegar (or you can do lemon) and let it "curd" a bit (5-10 mins) before adding to recipe. I didn't use raisins (personal choice) although it would've added the right amount of sweetness. I wanted it plain to serve alongside beef stew. 

Your hands are your best tools. The dough seemed so crumbly but it turned out perfect. Serve leftovers the next day with butter + honey!

I made this recipe twice this weekend and it was a big hit! A lot of people at the party commented that they usually don't like irish soda bread and that this changed their mind! I have never made it with carroway seeds, so this recipe was perfect. Even the breakdown and directions were easy to follow for a beginner baker such as myself. Thank you! ETA I won an Irish soda bread contest with this one!

Made it a few times and it seems to get better! Only thing I do differently is I use real Irish butter (Kerry Gold) and I broil the soda bread on low for about 2 mins to give it a nice crispy touch to the outside.

I have made this recipe several times now and it comes out exactly the way I want Irish Soda Bread to taste....this makes me so happy because I had lost a family favorite recipe for Soda Bread and this recipe is just the same as the one I lost. Thank you for posting! I usually do have to add a bit of buttermilk to a make the dough come together, but the finished product is always great!

This was good. Very dense. I used currants instead of raisins, and I definitely had to add buttermilk to make a cohesive dough.

I  used a cast iron skillet and left out the raisins but will try them next time.  The middle was gooey but that was my fault. What a simple and delicious bread, even our picky seven year old loved it.

I know we shouldnâ€™t modify the recipe but I couldnâ€™t help but add a few things. I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, as well as using the suggestion of using red wine vinegar and 1cup of shredded cheese,  it turned out lovely! Thank you!

Delicious, but sweeter and flakier than traditional Irish soda bread, more like a scone. I will make this again for my family

I wish St Patrick's day came more than once a year.  Delicious and authentic soda bread.  I made it with dried cranberries instead of raisins and it was a hit.

The only change I made was to add a tiny bit more sugar and milk.  (Maybe 2 T each) Next time I make it I will either cut back on the flour or add more buttermilk.  Soda bread is always dry, but this one is particularly dry.  However it does have a wonderful taste.  We ordered soda breads from two different bakeries we have used in the past, and this one tasted better than either of them.  I too, ended up with a heavy bottom crust.before it was completely baked.  Next time I won't worry about a soggy middle.  I did use raisins since we both like them.

I'm not a fan of Irish Soda Bread, nor is my son. My husband, however, looks forward to buying it in the grocery store each March.  This year I decided to try making it myself and I'm glad I did.  Both my son and I loved this crusty version of the bread, and my husband ate his fair share as well.  I had to substitute cranberries for the raisins since I didn't have any of the latter but I prefer cranberries anyway.  The taste is slightly sweet and the texture is a little dry but not overly so. I'd describe it as a large biscuit more than a bread.  I'll definitely make it again but not too often because I'd eat way too much of it!

It came out very nice, the raisins added a nice bit of sweetness.  I will be making this again, but will add caraway seeds to give it the taste I remember when growing up.

Delicious! I have always used a different recipe, which included caraway seed and used MUCH less butter and less sugar. This bread was different, sweeter and softer, but absolutely delicious and a great change of pace. I'll make it again, possibly adding caraway.

I made this exactly as written, save for altitude changes (I live at 6,000 feet).  We love it!  It was ready for the oven in no time and baked up beautifully, with a nice crispy crust.  This will surely be part of my regular rotation of weekly quick breads.

This is a delicious recipe for Soda Bread, with two exceptions.  1.  I had to add another 1/4 cup of melted butter to make it look like crumbs.  2.  One cup of buttermilk is NOT enough.  I made it gluten-free yesterday and had to add an additional cup of buttermilk.  I thought maybe it was the unusual flour, so I made it again tonight with regular bleached white flour.  It was STILL TOO DRY to make a ball.  So I added the extra 1cup of buttermilk and it was perfect!  3.  I like caraway seeds in mine, so I added one teaspoon of caraway seeds to the buttermilk/raisin mixture.
