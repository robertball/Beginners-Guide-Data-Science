I used Philadelphia Garlic & Herb because I couldn't find the Laughing Cow.  I also had Cheddar Cheese Slices so I used them in addition to the grated cheese.  It was excellent & my husband loved it.

It was delicious... I had to use Alouette Garlic and herb cheese, after it was finished baking I placed on a bed of rice... Next time I make this recipe I think I will just slice the chicken breast and stuffed with mixture instead of rolled it... thank you for the recipe!

I mostly used it as inspiration.  Instead of the laughing cow cheese, I made a bechamel sauce with garlic and parsley.  Instead of cheddar I used mozzarella.  Instead of frozen broccoli I used fresh and blanched briefly before chopping.  I had no toothpicks, and it really, really helps to use them.  Other then that I pretty much followed the intent and timing of the recipe.  Dee-Lish!

Itâ€™s simple and tastes good. I think the seasoning could be improved on but the time and instructions were spot on.

This is a really good recipe.  I prepared it as written, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, I found it a little salty for my taste.  Next time I will not salt the breasts prior to browning.  The cheeses have enough salt.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a good recipe, I made it as directed except didn't find laughing cow cheese so I substituted alouette garlic and herb cheese spread, fresh broccoli rather than frozen, I'll definitely make it again.

This will definatly be a regular dinner at my house! It was so quick, and easy, and even my picky eaters ate it they didn't even realize there was vegetables inside. Lol

It turned out great! I had to use garden vegetable cream cheese instead of the cheese wedges but it was still unbelievably good.
