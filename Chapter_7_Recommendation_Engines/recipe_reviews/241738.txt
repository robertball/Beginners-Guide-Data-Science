I have been wanting to try out this recipe ever since Chef John uploaded it to YouTube. I finally got around to making it a few evenings ago. This is my first time making bread and may I just say how simple it is to make! I got so excited seeing it rise in the oven... And boy, when it came out of the oven and I tried a slice (after letting it cool, of course), the flavor is unparalleled. My family and friends loved it...and with a bit of butter and jam...too delicious!! All I can say is that I won't be buying Irish soda bread from Whole Foods anymore...I'll be making my own!!! Please hurry and make this bread now! Your family and friends (as well as your own taste buds) will thank you later!

Followed the directions exactly, and it had a great crunchy crust while remaining moist on the inside. Flavour-wise, it was the perfect balance of subtle sweetness with refreshing orange tanginess. A big hit with the fam!

For the all star Canada Cooks event I made Chef John's Irish Soda Bread using yogurt instead of buttermilk which made it very moist and delicious. I think this is a good bread to have at a luncheon or with tea.  If you are looking for bread sweetened without sugar this is the one to try with honey and raisins for extra sweetness.

I've been obsessed with Irish soda bread since getting some from a local bakery around St. Patty's.  This recipe was outstanding, even with a few modifications. I love oats, so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures  the same.  I only used whole wheat  flour,  not all-purpose for part.  This created a lovely brown bread.  I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest, and I highly recommend this.  Finally, I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper, so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf.  My husband and I already ate half with dinner!

This will be my go-to recipe for Irish Soda Bread. The orange zest is a wonderful addition! I used King Arthur's White Whole Wheat Flour in place of the all-purpose flour, and it worked great.

I don't bake much, just started making a few loaves of bread this year. And I don't recall eating Irish soda bread anywhere recently so I can't compare my creation to anybody else's. That said, this recipe came out marvelously! Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own as per Chef John's blog. But the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee. Warning; if you're late out of bed you'll likely find it already gone!

First of all, what a surprising taste! Although it had raisins  (no currents out here in rural America) it had an overall lovely, sweet taste. It was super easy to make and Chef John's suggestion of having Irish Butter on hand was "the icing on the cake" - pardon the pun!
I make a practice to view Chef John's video's more than once to try perfect his methodology.
I recommend this easy bread to all levels of cooks!

I frequently make traditional Irish soda bread for a daughter who got hooked on it in Ireland.  This bread is very unlike traditional Irish soda bread.  However it is a delightful tasting bread...perfect for breakfast or brunch.  It tastes more like a moister scone!  I made it with all the listed ingredients except substituted steel cut oats for the rolled oats (steel cut oats are the secret ingredient for true Irish soda bread).  Can't say I really noticed them in this bread.  Also used 1/4 cup Craisens because that is what I had.  Baked the loaves for the time stated but did so in a metal roaster pan with parchment in the bottom.  Took off the lid to brown the last 10 minutes.  They were baked perfectly.  I bake my artisan bread in the roaster pan to keep them moist....works very well!

I made this yesterday and it was so good I made it again today.  Super easy and yummy.  Who knew I could bake bread like this?  Gave 2 loafs away to family members. They loved it!  So different and not too sweet.  I used lemon zest because that is what I had on hand. and used all  yellow raisins . Perfect!

Used dark karo syrup instead of honey, no orange zest, and split the flour to 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 wheat.  Not having buttermilk, I did the old lemon juice trick and used 1/2 whole milk, 1/2 half and half.  Great crunch on the crust, soft and tender inside...I doubled the recipe for a group dinner tonight and made 12 small loaves for presentation purposes.

This was great and easy.  I know it's wrong to change Irish Soda Bread but I really like cranberries better than raisins. So I added cranberries and dried apricots.  Super Good.

I just made this. It’s a really good recipe and very easy. Delicious with just a smear of butter. I’ve never made a quick bread with such a crispy crust. What a treat!  I made it exactly as written, using just a couple of quantity changes for altitude (I live at 6,000+ feet). This will be a staple in my breakfast bread rotation.

Yum! Best Irish soda bread I ever made. Great taste and texture. The honey and orange zest really made this shine. The video was worthwhile for useful tips and, of course, Chef John’s signature style humor. Thanks Chef John!

I made this with my grandkids today. I divided the dry ingredients in half so they could each make their own, one with raisins and one with cranberries. They were very patient until we could smell the bread baking. My grandson's verdict was-"this is better than chocolate"!

I made this recipe as written except I used dark raisins for the currants. I baked it for about 40 minutes and it turned out great! It's a simple recipe and quick to make. I will certainly make this again. Thanks Chef John!

We have very much enjoyed this refreshing bread!  I made only one substitution - cranberries for the currants because local groceries only carry them seasonally.  Next time I will try to find the currants.

My husband loved it.  He wants more.  I did not have dried currants or buttermilk.  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2  & dried cranberries instead.  It was my first time making and tasting soda bread.  I liked it.  Easy.  Next time I may try adding chopped walnuts.

I followed the recipe exactly and had very good results.  The flavor of the bread and aroma was even better the next day.  I'm not sure how it compares to traditional Irish Soda Bread, but I will definitely make it again.  It reminded me of a Simnel Cake that my mother used to bake for church during lent (midway through).  Adding some almond paste in the middle would not only add to this similarity, but would also be delicious.

I've never had Irish Soda Bread, so I have nothing to compare it to, but his bread turned out delicious and can stand on its own.  It's especially tasty toasted, with butter and honey--great for breakfast!  I used all All-Purpose flour, 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup Golden Raisins, and made my own "buttermilk"- added 1/4 cup lemon juice to half-and-half.  Loved the orange zest--very subtle.  I didn't particularly like the wetness of the dough (hard to clean-up), but the final product was well worth the work--tasty and pretty, with a moist crumb.

Followed the directions completely and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  It was a beautiful color.  I had to try it and I'm glad I did because it was far from done.  I cooked it another half hour ... a total of one hour 15 minutes.  Still very moist inside.  I've had no other problems with my oven.  I've never had Irish Soda Bread so I don't know how to compare it, but it's very good.

This is a delicious Irish Soda Bread.  The orange zest and honey really make it special, a bit different from other recipes I've made.  My family loved it.  But I did make one change--inadvertently: I left out the butter.  I totally panicked when I realized what I'd done because I was afraid the bread would not have a good texture without the butter.  But it was still delicious (and lower in fat!)  Next time I'll add the butter and see how much difference it makes.

For St. Patrick's Day, I used Chef John's recipes for both corned beef and cabbage and this Irish soda bread. I don't know what soda bread is supposed to taste like so I have nothing to compare this bread to. I didn't have currents or enough raisins, so I used the raisins I had (1/4 c) and chopped up some dried apricots (1/2 c). Easy-to-make recipe for a biscuit-like bread that is not too sweet.

I did not have any currants so I used all golden raisins.  I made it in muffin tins and got 14 muffins.  Delicious and moist.  I would add caraway seed the next time to give the flavor a little kick.

Great recipe everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use different fruit. I am highly allergic to grapes so no raisins(currants are closely related to grapes so to be safe I don't eat them either) I used dried cherries, blueberries and pineapple.

I made the recipe pretty much as written. I increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups. The dough was so wet and unmanageable. I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands.  So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  That is why it has a 3 star rating.  On the upside, I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.

I was excited to find a Chef John recipe that I could make for my St Patrick's Day celebration, since he makes such great food.  Unfortunately this one wasn't for me.  I followed the directions exactly, but mine came out bland and a little bit dry.  Probably won't make this one again.

Best Irish Soda Bread I’ve ever eaten. I “veganized” it using 3T applesauce for the egg, and maple syrup instead of honey. For the dried fruit, I used raisins and goji berries.
Superb!

It's exactly how I recall Irish soda bread should be like. Nothing fancy, but yum.  And for once the soda didn't leave those strange pockets of yuck -- I think it might be the buttermilk? the right proportion?

I used dry cranberries and currants instead of raisins.  I did not use the oatmeal or whole wheat flour -- only all purpose flour,.  My dough was little too dry.  Next time I'll adjust the dough with a little more liquid.

This was so awesome. My husband loved it! The first time I like to follow the recipe to a T if I can. This time I didn't have any wheat flour so used all all purpose and didn't have golden raisins so used regular.  It was a hearty bread, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.  I took Chef John's advice and bought some Irish butter. Not sure I could tell any difference but it was very good on the bread. 

I never had Irish Soda Bread before but I don't believe that the orange zest is traditional. It was so good though! I plan to eat this for breakfast. There's no sugar in it so it's healthy , right?

It's a fast and easy recipe that I've prepared for the past few years on St Patrick's Day.  I've served it along with other Irish breads and this is everyone's favorite.  Next year it's going to be the only bread on the table.  The recipe can be followed without any alterations and it will turn out wonderful.
Thank you Chef John!

I followed the recipe almost to a tee, except I didn't end up having oats (next time) so I added an additional 1/4 cup wheat flour and one more tablespoon butter.  I didn't have currents so I used golden and regular raisins.  The bread is moist and sweet. I'll try this one again to see if I can get it better than it came out today.  Very good!

This was an instant hit. Texture and taste were tops. I will adjust the cooking time or  rack position next time as the bottoms of the loaves were a little too browned. Every oven tells a different story!

Yes I made it with some changes.  Added an additional tbsp of honey, caraway seeds (2 tbsps), and half a cup of wheat flour substituted for half a cup of white flour.  An additional tablespoon of butter too -  Used dried cranberries instead of raisins too.  Came out great!

Great, simple recipe. I don't know if it's truly Irish, but I probably made it even less so: I used all spelt flour, goat yogurt instead of buttermilk, no dried fruit. The result looked gorgeous and tasted great toasted, not that tasty untoasted. But will definitely make it again.

Easy to make, just follow the instructions. I swapped out regular raisins for the currants and dried cranberries for the golden raisins. Cranberries worked really nicely with the orange zest.

Will definitely make again... just the right amount of soda to rise but no bitter aftertaste. Great crust and moist inside. I forgot the add in the zest, but sprinkled on the loaves before baking. It worked nicely and adds a wonderful citrus note when it turns up in an individual bite.

High Altitude Variation - I live at 4500 feet and dough rises faster at this elevation. I omitted baking soda and used 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder instead. Also I switched to whole milk instead of buttermilk.  Baked at  400° for 40 minutes and an instant read thermometer read above  200°.  I  also used half a cup of raisins and half a cup of Craisins instead of golden raisins and currants because that is what I had on hand. The bread comes out a bit sweeter that way.

I liked this receipe even tho I forgot to add the quarter cup butter I put in the freezer. I'm sure it would have been even better. I added 3 tbs honey...next time 4.

Great video! Convinced me to try it myself. Easy to make & tastes fantastic! My changes: I used all white flour (4 cups total), all raisins (1 1/3 cup total), and 1/2 tsp orange extract instead of orange zest (I don't like the texture of zest). It is wonderful to smell & to eat! I will never buy another dried out Soda Bread from a store shelf again. This is too easy & delicious. Ty, Chef John!

I made it and was pleased with it. Just right in my opinion.
