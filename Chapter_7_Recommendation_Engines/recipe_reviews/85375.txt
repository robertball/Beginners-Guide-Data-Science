This was VERY good!  Because of the previous review that said this was bland, I added some chives and cayenne pepper to the sauce and it was awesome.  I also added some chopped garlic, about two cloves.  I loved this and will definitely make it again.

Really yummy and the kids gobbled it up.  I did change it a bit to make it a tad healthier.  I cooked the chicken with garlic and onions.  I used 8oz light cream cheese and almost one whole can of chicken broth and 3/4 finely shredded cheddar cheese for the sauce, It was super yum.  You omit the milk, water, and cream of chicken soup.  It was GREAT

Glad to see so many of you tried my recipe. It's a good basic beginning. Adding personal favorite spicing will only make it better. When I have little ones to feed, I keep it simple --when it's for older palates, it's nice to add the garlic and cayenne pepper and whatever else you enjoy. (I'm encouraged to add other of my favorites to this site now.)   ;)

I liked this, but there is something missing. Next time we are going to replace the water with white wine or chicken stock. Looking foward to it...
Update-used Pinot Grigio instead of water and it helped a lot with flavor. I had no cream cheese so used sour cream instead.

This recipe was delicious! I added more cream cheese and some colby jack cheese into the sauce, seasoned the chicken with oregano, salt, and pepper, and cooked it with garlic along with the onion. Defiinitely would do it again!

Well, after reading several reviews about this recipe tasting a little bland, I decided to add some more ingredients.  I also put garlic while cooking the chicken and the onions (great idea reviewer!), but I also added a small can of green chillies (I'm Mexican) but it didn't make it spicey, just flavorful.  Instead of water, I mixed a tablespoon of "Caldo de Pollo" which is a Mexican version of Chicken broth powder, and added it to the water.  It came out awesome!!! Thank you...and was super quick to make!

Very good but like others I altered it a bit. I used fresh garlic along with the onions and chicken broth instead of water and I used extra cream cheese and extra parmesan. Overall very good. Aslo very filling. I would make again my boyfriend and his son loved it.

I also read the reviews saying this was a rather bland dish so I added garlic while cooking the chicken and used "Better than Bouillion" chicken base instead of the water.  I used 6 oz of cream cheese and sprinkled black pepper on top with the parmesan cheese.  The house smelled wonderful although the overall taste was still lacking.  I will try it again, maybe with a pinch of salt added.

My husband made the recipe prior to reading the reviews. I agree that it's bland and needed some spicing up. If he makes it again I'm sure he'll be adding some roasted garlic, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.

This was great. Basically it is an alfredo sauce with chicken poured over broccoli and pasta. I do feel it was pasta heavy and will either double the sauce or only use 1 lb. of spaghetti next time. This is an easy and enjoyable dinner.

This was quite bland, unfortunately.  I even seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder, same with the sauce, but still there wasn't any flavor to it.

This was very yummy! I listened to the others about it being bland so I marinated chicken breast in house italian dressing for a couple hrs before cutting it up. Added 3 cloves of fresh garlic in when cooking chicken. I also added about 4 oz cream cheese instead of 3 and added about 2 heaping tablespoons of garlic and herb speadable cheese (usually use for crackers..but why not). Added maybe 1/4 c more milk(used half and half) and a splash more water (which I added 2 bouillon cubes to and put in microwave to desolve). I also used italian seasoning and a little season salt to flavor. (the bouillon has alot of salt, so only add a little to taste if you think it needs it)These changes made it taste WONDERFUL. I think the addition of the garlic herb cheese spread makes it xtra yummy. Everyone at it up! did not dry out overnight like some pasta either.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I used rigatoni instead of spaghetti.  I added the parmesan cheese during the "toss" at the end.  This was awesome and one I'll serve again and again.  I wanted to grill the chicken, but a storm prevented me from grilling....look forward to trying that next time!  That would make it pretty close to "Macaroni Grill"-worthy!  Enjoy!

I also made some changes I added chopped garlic and a lot of Italian seasoning to spruce it up.  I added it to the chicken at first and then added to the drained pasta.  I couldn't believe it but I should have added more seasonings to it.  It was very good and I can't wait to taste it cold tomorrow after it sitsover night.

This was really good. My kids loved it. Although, I did make some modifications to it. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken. Cooked the broccoli in the chicken instead of the water with the noodles and added 1 small can of italian diced tomatoes. I also upped the parm cheese to 1 cup instead of 3/4.  It was not bland at all after these adjustments. Will definitely make this again.

I made this and yeah it need salt and a bit of garlic powder but a real cook knows to put salt and other spices in when the recipe lacks a littel. Overall this is a very easy and delcious recipe. I will definately make this again.

The recipe was great and very easy to follow. I used clear chicken soup and some tomato soup instead of Cream of Chicken. The result was a love tangy, cheesy flavour whih my husband loved.

Husband not a big fan of chicken breast, would have rated higher w/o chicken. Great as side dish.  Added lots of spices to flavor it up. I loved it and the kids did too!

This recipe was really good. I added some whole garlic cloves that I slowly sauteed in olive oil.  I also omitted reduced sodium chicken broth for the water.  Added a whole cup of the chicken broth to thin out the sauce. Also added italian seasoning to the chicken. The kids ate it all.

This is the first time that I make a pasta and I loved it. The instructions were very easy to follow and it was a very simple recipe (this is the first time I follow a recipe too) haha I also had to add some garlic, pepper and cayenne pepper to the chicken to add flavor, and chicken broth to the sauce and the results were wonderful. I will definitively make this recipe again! =)

very good. I cooked the chicken (breast half, not strips) seperate from the sauce and lightly breaded it in salt, pepper, garlic and flour. I served the pasta and broc together and the chicken on the side with a little sauce poured over it. Everyone loved it! Thanks.

This recipe was so good and loved by everyone in my family.  Very adult and kid friendly recipe.  I sprayed the skillet with PAM instead of using the butter/margarine.  My daughter is already asking when I'm making this one again.

I did some tweaking given what I had on hand, and it was delicious!  Instead of cooking the chicken with margarine, I sauteed it with some light Italian dressing.  For pasta I used a box of mini penne.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and I threw in a can of mushrooms to go with it.  It turned out so good and the kids LOVED it.  We'll definitely have this again!

Great and so easy.  I appreciated the warning about blandness so I added to the chicken granulated garlic, dried basil and 2 tablespoons of dry ranch dressing mix...... fussy 5 year old ate it up and the grown ups too..... Will definitely make again... Thanks

This was pretty good, my husband ate it all up! We added some extra seasoning: Italian, Garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to give it some more taste. I probably could have added more to that!

Very tasty - excellent re-heated.  I often leave out cream cheese and add in a bit of sour cream.  I've also added a handful of fresh spinach, used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and added fresh minced garlic as others suggested.

We make this dish at least once a month!

This recipe was absolutely yummy! I tweaked it slightly by using egg noodles to make it more "creamy" in texture and I also finished the sauce by using a half of fresh lemon juice. The lemon juice gave it just the right amount of citrus to liven this dish up. I also used fresh garlic pressed and added when I cooked the chicken.

Very good. I used cream of chicken with herbs and left over grilled chicken. Other then adding cracked pepper it was really good. I used penne pasta and sprinkled shredded parm over top before serving. My kids loved it!

I make a similar recipe (though I call it alfredo) and I use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and I use 1/2 cup of milk and no water. I also add some ground black pepper.   Everything else I use the same and it's very tasty.

This was delicious!  I made a little extra sauce based on other reviews and added garlic to the chicken as it cooked and the sauce before adding it to the skillet.  My husband asked that I make it again.  I didn't have a box of spaghetti so I made ziti...I think its one of those that can be made w/ any pasta!  Delicious...thanks!!!

this was great! just made it and it will be a hit w/ my picky kids!  i left out the water and carmelized the onions (a whole one) and it gave it the extra zing it needed flavor wise!  i used rotini noodles and it looks great!  thanks for the new idea w/ chicken and pasta!

I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti, cutting it in half to 8 ounces, while following the rest of the recipe as stated.  I also added garlic, salt, pepper, used chicken broth instead of water and used fat free half and half instead of milk.  I know I made a lot changes, but I read that is was very bland. My husband really liked it, although it reminded me of a lean cuisine meal.  I am not sure if I would make it again.  I thought it was good, but not to die for.

LESS IS NOT MORE HERE! great base as it seems from all the reviews so, I went for it and altered it up.  these are my changes and additions that went with the original  recipe 
cream of mushroom vs cream of chicken ( i would add fresh mushrooms to the onion, garlic, chicken  sauté next time)
1/3 cup white wine (i usd pinot but i think a drier wine like Chardonnay may be better) and
1/3 cup chicken stock ( these were in lieu of the 2/3 water)
walnuts
Pappaedelle noodles vs spiaghetti.  This sauce deserves a thicker, heartier noodle
This was so good! My family loved it. the great part is it doesn't have the crazy calories like fettuccine does due to the small amount of milk and cream cheese that is used vs heavy cream.  Enjoy!!

Very good. I did finely chop some garlic and cooked them with the onions. I also used a chive and onion cream cheese. I’ll try to add a little heat (spice) next time but this was good and easy enough. Great job!!

Two thumbs up from single dad and hungry teenage son! Followed advice to spice up the chicken and the suggestion to cook broccoli and diced Italian tomatoes with chicken. Also used chicken broth instead of water for sauce. Next time, we will use 1/2 the pasta.

I'm not much of a cook but this pasta was super easy to make and it came out great!! I did make a few adjustments because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used non-sweetened almond milk instead of regular milk, green, yellow and red peppers instead of onions and Fit & Active Neufchâtel Cheese instead of cream cheese. I also cut the chicken into smaller pieces and seasoned it with garlic powder and pepper. I'd definitely recommend this recipe to everyone. Simple and delicious!

I thought this recipe sounded too easy to be as good as it was, the family really enjoyed it.  Seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and added a little garlic and followed the rest of the recipe to the T.  Thank you for sharing!

Yum! I put all 8oz cream cheese in and seasoned a bit more. Instead of Spaghetti noodles I used wide egg noodles. Thank you for this delicious staple meal! I will be adding it to my monthly menu! There are so many yummy adventures in store for this recipe in our home!!!!

Made it as directed but added garlic salt for seasoning and used whole wheat linguini. I thought it was quick and easy and so much better then eating a canned sauce. This will become a regular recipe.

Great pasta dish! Because I had limited ingredient options, I browned two cans of chicken with the onions in two tablespoons of margarine. I added some garlic powder, salt, pepper, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and some Italian blend shredded cheese to the sauce before mixing it into my chicken. It was a hit for dinner, and the kids loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I tried the recipe as is and agree that it is a good place to start, but needs some kick to it.  The sauce is a really good base, but adding a little spice, I think, will make it better.  Next time I will add some garlic, more onions, less pasta, and more chicken.

Should have read the previous reviews about being bland, will def try again and use some different spices/cheeses. I used spaghetti squash and it worked very well as a pasta substitute

This was very good and very easy. I did change some things up. I used chicken that I had already cooked( I roast several chickens and cut them up and put them in the freezer for meals)I cooked the onions and margarine and added a pinch or two of cayenne pepper and garlic. I used 8 oz of cream cheese 1 can of cheddar cheese soup 1 and a half cans (10.5 oz) of chicken broth. Omit water milk and cream of chicken soup. My hubby really liked it and he is very picky. I will add mushrooms and more broccoli next time. A keeper for sure.

My family and I really really enjoyed this recipe. I used lasagne pasta sheets instead of spaghetti and added a whole lot of spices, and it came out brilliantly. I cant wait for the opportunity to make it again!

Made this last week, left out cream cheese and ran out of parm.  Substituted jack cheese.  Added frozen peas, strips of ham and plenty of Italian seasoning.  Used bowtie pasta and it came out lovely. The whole family loved it.

This was just missing something, love the broccilli in it, but had to doctor it up with some garlic and other spices.

We all liked this except for one daughter who doesn't like broccoli.  I think that it would be better with only 12 oz. of pasta, it seamed a bit dry.  I think garlic and a little salt would improve the flavor.  When is the parmesan to be added the directions did not say.  I added it at the end.

After reading some other reviews, I substituted water with chicken broth seasoned with garlic.  I found the dish to be quite yummy, easy to make, and inexpensive.  My only criticism is that the meal was quite large (12 servings) however serving size can be altered so there's no real problem if I choose to make this meal again.  All in all, good stuff!

Not much flavor. However, I think this would be great for kids since they are picky eaters. I think it would be wise to maybe add some other cheese like asiago that has some flavor and maybe garlic with the onion. Just very plain.
