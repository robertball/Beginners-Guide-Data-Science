This was really good.  The only thing i changed was i didn't drain the liquid, i like creamier mashed potatoes, and added a little half and half at the end instead of butter.  Turned out amazing.

This was okay...not great, just okay.  The flavor was kind of bland and we ended up dumping the leftovers instead of eating them. I thought the gravy mix would give it more of a kick, but it didn't.  This recipe did perk up my interest though for making potatoes in the crock pot...great idea...just need to tweak the recipe a bit for our family's taste preferences.  Thanks for sharing the idea.

Followed the recipe (for 10 servings).  It was tasty.  I did add some shredded moz cheese and used white pepper instead of black pepper.  The family LOVED it!  This is easy and worked well with our Christmas family meal.

I used chicken broth instead of milk, and they were delicious!

These were easy to make and tasted great. Crazy idea to add the gravy mix while they cooked. The consistency came out perfect.
