I've made this recipe several times now... mostly at the request of my wife.  When I say 'several times', I mean about twice a week for a month.  This was my first cedar plank recipe and I was very pleased with the results.  What an incredible flavor!  Thank you.

This recipe was delish!  Note that the spice mixture is not for marinating, but it's more of a thick sauce for topping the salmon during cooking.  We did ours on the grill and served with the leftover sauce.  Very good.

Awesome!  I opted to include all of the option ingredients.  I should have added the soy sauce at the very end, my sauce got a bit runny.  I didn't even need to add water after adding some lemon juice and the soy sauce.  Delicious sauce and perfect moist, flakey salmon.  It's a cooold February here in Wisconsin so no grilling - worked great in the oven.  Looking forward to trying it on the grill!

I used fresh dill and wild caught salmon.  I'm not sure a farm raised salmon has the strength of flavor to stand up to the flavors in the sauce.  Also, I think make sure to plank it--I think the cedar adds to the flavor balance.  Next time, I might reduce the sugar--salmon as a fish doesn't generally need it.  This is my go-to recipe for planking, and I think suits NW caught wild steelhead salmon very well.

This was an absolute hit! I made it for my boyfriends family out at the cabin. We all loved it! I changed a couple of things. I made the brine and marinated in a large tupperware container for 2 days before grilling and I also added 3 gloves of fresh garlic minced - I'm a garlic lover :)We always soak the cedar plank for at least 8 hours before using on the BBQ

I don't eat fish - but my husband loves it - so I'm always looking for good recipes to suprise him with. This one is now his favorite! We've made it several times since I stumbled across it and he loves it!!

I have made this recipe so many times, I've lost count.  It is my families favorite Salmon recipe.  I have never made it on a plank, however.  I just grill it on a piece of foil.  A real treat!!!

Meh.  It was decent at best.  Needs more flavors.  I marinated the fish for an hour and it still didn't pick up enough flavor.   Maybe fresh dill next time?

I love cedar plank salmon. Didn't have a plank so...I baked this in foil packets in the oven. In my opinion, a good quality salmon should not be dressed up with such strong flavors. It was good a good flavor combination but somewhat overpowering.

This was good, but not great. We felt like it was "missing something" and while we liked it, our kids wouldn't even eat it without us wiping off the sauce. Maybe it was the dried dill... So, I'm not sure we'll try it again with kids.  Glad others have found it delicious.

Wow!  I think this may be the best salmon I ever tasted ... I can't believe I made it! Thanks Nicolette505  :) Turned out tender and moist with a delicate, smoky flavor that enhanced rather than overwhelmed the fish.

Delicious! I do not care for dill so used freshly grated ginger and crushed garlic instead - it was fantastic.

I had never done this before but wanted to try it. It was very good and my guys don't like fish but can do salmon once in a while. They enjoyed it. It's cold outside now and I'm tempted to try it again in the oven.

This was excellent.  Fast, flavorful, and very moist!  I have only used cedar planks on the grill, so using it the oven was new to me but a great one to try.  With the heat lowered, really helped to retain the moisture - I was out of brown sugar and used Turbinado as a fast substitute and it worked - but will use brown sugar next time for the benefit of carmelizing.

Thank you so much! - sarahcf

Not a huge fish fan but this recipe did the trick.  Followed it pretty closely, triple recipe because I had a big piece of salmon, and thought there would be plenty of leftovers.  Not so, ate it all up.

I tried this Planked Salmon recipe with my family and they all raved about for the whole evening! I added some more garlic and a lemon wedge. It was fantastic! I'll be perparing it for my family very VERY very soon! Thank you!

Excellent recipe - everyone loved it. Added in all the optional ingredients (which I don't think are actually optional for this recipe). Grilled the salmon with cedar planks soaked in water with soy and lemon juice overnight. Note that the success of the recipe will depend largely on the quality of the cut you get. I recommend getting a slightly less fatty and very "dense" steak. As others noted, the sauce is not a marinade it is to dribble on at time of cooking.

Very mild, sweet flavors and easy to make.  I followed the recipe, with soy sauce as the only optional ingredient.  The sesame seeds add a nice crunch.

This was nice.  I substituted 2 tbs coconut water instead of water water.  I think I will cut some of the soy next time to decrease the sodium.  I prepped the salmon with blackened redfish magic for some kick. Tried to talk the wife into serving with boiled sweet potato honey fries and grilled scallions, but she only allows me to improvise on one menu item per meal, and the salmon won out.

I did not like the flavor of this dish. It was sweet and also bland. I would not make this again.
