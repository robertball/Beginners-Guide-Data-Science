It is a good recipe, but if you like medium rare, need to take the rib out at internal temp of 130 and let it come up to 140 while it is resting and not let it cook until 140

I rub my seasoned roast with flour.  This seals the juices in the meat.  Cook at 450 for 30 minutes to sear, then reduce heat to 325 until inner temp reaches 120 degrees.  Let it stand covered in foil for 30 minutes.  Medium rare.  You can put away the steak knives, all you will need to cut this piece of meat is your fork.

This is the most awesome roast you'll ever eat. Another option is if your camping do it in a camp oven (cast iron pot put on the coals of an open fire). The meat just melts in your mouth & you can put your vegetables in the pot with the meat.

I made this for our New Years Eve gathering last evening and the carnivores went wild!! I can't comment on the pudding because we used the rib for sandwiches. My family and my guests like their meat rare so I took it out when it reached a temp of 130. Simple recipe yet absolutely delicious Elissa and thank you!

This recipe was awesome.  I adjusted the yorkshire pudding down to one cup of each ingredient and three eggs and it was the perfect amount of batter for 12 muffins.  The au jus was outstanding.  I added half a teaspoon of garlic powder to it but otherwise followed the recipe.  Will definitely do it again!

These were fun to watch in the oven. I used 9 eggs. The puddings were yummy with the meat juice. This recipe will make about 20. Do NOT overfill muffin tin. The smoke billowing from the fat that overflowed was not appetizing.

Made this recipe last night for guests and it was wonderful.  The meat came out perfect!! One of the guests always makes Yorkshire pudding and I never have until last night.  It was so good  she asked for the recipe.. It does make more than you need to fill a 12 place  cupcake tin.  Thanks so much... I will continue to use this as my favorite Prime Rib.. Now I am not hesitent to make the pudding.  so nice to have the batter made up ahead of time.  So good and easy!!!

I've been making my mother-in-law's delicious recipe for 30 years... tried this one, which is a little different and WOW!!! It's a new favorite!  And about the egg thing... if you are familiar with Yorkshire, you know egg quantity can be adjusted to individual preference!   YUM!  Thanks.

It was good, and I was glad for the advice to not overcook.  I added all the garlic peices, and I think that was wasted time and work.  I could not taste the garlic in the meat, and I was afraid I was going to bite into a large garlic sliver as I was eating.  I was serving this to adults and children, and I think it would have been easier and just as tasty to omit the garlic.  

I thought the puddings were a little too "eggy". Next time I will use half as many eggs about 3-4.  I made 6 puddings in a popover pan, and 12 more in a muffin tin-more than enough.

The au jus was very good.

I used the recipe for the yorkshire pudding and found that it was very eggy. Not sure if it's suppose to be like that but no one really like it.

OMG this was one of the best roasts I have made besides the foolproof rib roast recipe on this site, the only thing I didn't do is put the garlic in the roast because I don't like that much garlic in my meat, I will never make a roast any other way, thanks for the great recipe

I mixed the salt, pepper and some thyme in olive oil, covering the roast with the mixture.  Then I sealed it with a light coating of flour.  I roasted it at 450 for 30 minutes, reducing the temp to 325.  I roasted it until the internal temperature reached 130.  The meat was perfect!  The au jus was great!

I made this for New Years Day, it was wonderful, everyone enjoyed it. The one thing I would change is putting the pudding in the oven to warm up the muffin's.  There was a lot of grease splattering so be careful when you are following this process.  I did not let them warm for 10 minutes, I left them in for only 2 or 3minutes.The pudding came out great.

I'll admit I only used this recipe for the Yorkshire pudding - I have my own recipe for Prime Rib (horseradish + whole grain mustard). However, I really enjoyed the Yorkshire pudding, I made this for our Christmas dinner. I couldn't get 1/2 cup of drippings so I filled out the amount with oil. It was yummy!

After reading previous reviews, I adjusted the meat temperature to 125 degrees before lowing the oven temp to 325 and let it cook for 1 hr. Afterward  the roast was totally covered for 30 minutes on top of the stove.  I did the 3 eggs with the rest of the ingredients to 1 cup for the flour and milk to make 12 muffins.  My husband and son-in-law advised this was the best Prime Rib  ever and to make it again.  My SIL thoroughly enjoyed the Yorkshire Pudding and watching them in the oven. It was great!

OMG, I just happened to have the exact size prime rib so I chose this recipe. FANTASTIC! Came out PERFECT!  I didn't have white wine, so I used a red, so the au jus didn't come out so good, but not horrible. That was just my own fault. Otherwise, this was my first time ever having or making yorkshire pudding and we were delighted!  I agree with the other person who said to take it out at 120 degrees, as I prefer mine on the rare side. I did that and wrapped it in foil while I did the pudding and it was delightful.  Thank you for such a great recipe. :)

I'd never roasted a rib roast before last Christmas, and have always wanted to try Yorkshire Pudding, so I used this recipe from start to finish.  The only thing I didn't do was stud the roast with garlic.  I was SO pleasantly surprised at how easy it was, and in fact will be doing another one for Christmas this year.  Thank you for a great recipe!  (Garlic mashed potatoes made this a very special dinner!)

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I would advise is cooking to temp of 125 and letting rest will give you rare/medium rare.  Cooking to 130 and letting rest will give you medium rare to medium meat.  140 mentioned in this recipe is too done for my family, so we just decreased the time according to our taste.  The Yorkshire pudding is heavenly!  It seems like there will not be enough pan drippings to make, but I was able to make 22 puddings total from a 5.62 lb standing rib roast.   We did not get any crust on our pan for Au Jus, but really, we did not miss it at all as the meat is super moist and flavorful without it.

I make Yorkshire Pudding all the time. I use 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk and 2 eggs with a pinch of salt for 6 puddings. So 4 eggs for 12 puddings. We have a joke that it isn't Yorkshire Pudding unless you set off the smoke detector! To prevent this use less fat in the pans and use less of the mixture in the muffin pans. This also works well in a cast iron skillet if you don't have a muffin pan. My family loves these so much that I have to make three per person! If you are making these and don't have the drippings use bacon fat or shortening.

My grandmother and mother both made this dish for special occasions and I made it for the first time 50+ years after my first taste! 

A few changes: I generously salted and peppered the roast, using probably at least 2 teaspoons of salt and pepper.  I cooked the roast as directed although I turned it down the event temp to 350 after 25 minutes, instead of 30. Watch the roast carefully after 45 minutes at 350' as it gets to 140' quickly.  

Also I loosely wrapped foil around the top and sides of the roast.I did not wrap it tightly in foil as shown in the video.  The roast was a nice medium rare. 

For the Yorkshire puddings, I used my Kitchenaide to whisk the eggs and milk, and then I whisked the batter for 2 minutes after adding the flour.  I rested then batter while the roast was cooking as directed (apparently that's important.) The Yorkshire puddings were beautiful, tasty, and done after 20 minutes.  I watched them carefully.  Make sure everything's ready to go when the puddings come out as they are best fresh out of the oven.

I will make this again!

Love, love, love it! I wouldn't change a thing! I served Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables with this. It was a huge hit! Everyone said it was the best meal they had in a long time! Then, after serving Caramel Apple Pie for dessert, they were almost floating off their seats with satisfaction!

I like medium rare steaks and good roast, but this one was too bloody, raw and the fat part inedible.  I roasted it about 30 more minutes and the color was good...pink to red, but the roast was not succulent nor tender and the inner fat added nothing to the meat.  It could be me, the cook, the oven thermostat, or anything.

It cooked longer than recommended time since my M-I-L doesn't like rare meat however, it was only cooked well done on one end so the middle was still rare and it retained all the flavor and juiciness described in original recipe. The Yorkshire pudding was perfect with it and very easy to make.

Turned out great...again.  Although I keep forgetting to half the Yorkshire Pudding ingredients since I could have easily made 24 instead of 12.

I used this recipe for my sons family birthday party and I can't thank you enough!  It was a smashing hit!  I've never cooked one before and I do wish a note would have been made in regards to not putting anything in the bottom of the roaster when cooking.  I did not thank goodness but for beginner cooks that may think they need something in the roaster to prevent sticking it is unnecessary.  Because the fat renders down at such a high heat nothing is needed at the bottom of the roaster like say a rump roast.  Anyway I wouldn't change a thing my whole family enjoyed every bite!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this one!!

Superb dinner. Did not like adding the beef fat to the Yorkshire pudding. For medium rare cook to less than 140 degrees.

The prime (really choice). Turned out perfectly.  The butcher suggested that he cut the ribs off then tie it back together which  in hindsight was a godsend.  The recipe called for a 5 lb roast, but because of a large family and desire for leftovers, I had him cut a 10 lb roast.   The directions were perfect as I monitored the thermometer carefully and took out the roast at 130 degrees.  While it rested, prepared the Yorkshire puddings, au jus and mashed potatoes along with a veggie.  It was PERFECT!!  Thanks Elissa.

I generally follow a different method for a rib roast but thought I would try this with the au jus (I didn't have the time for the Yorkshire pudding - maybe next time). This turned out beautifully! Moist, tender and the au jus was the perfect complement to the meal. I added herbs de Provence along with the salt, pepper, and garlic. Will definitely do this again.

I made this for our Christmas Eve dinner, and it was the best ever. I did not change a thing except cooking it a little less so it was a nice medium rare. The pop overs turned out perfect too. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank you!

Excellent recipe! My family was reminiscing about the past and my father was going on about his mother making prime rib and Yorkshire pudding and how much he loved and missed it. I decided I had to make this for him. He absolutely loved this dish, it came out perfect! Just seeing how happy he seemed transported back to his childhood made me feel great that I was able to find a recipe that was exactly like he’d been missing made that time with him that much more special.

I followed everything exactly (including pre-heating the muffin tins) and it came out perfect!  Oh yeah, I did do what one reviewer suggested and took it out when it got to 130 degrees.  Perfect rare to medium-rare.  (i used 3 lb rib roast).  The yorkshire pudding was eggy, but it was similiar to french toast without all the sugar.  The Au Jus sauce was spot on!  Will keep and use again.

This is a fairly basic recipe.  Season the outside really well.  The problem is the size of the roast and meat doneness.  With my family, not everybody likes their roast the same way; rare to medium well.  Sometimes, you can achieve the desired doneness by where you slice it.  In my case, I prefer the crispy and medium-well doneness from the end where my nephew and brother-in-law prefers rare.  So, the idea of completely thawing the roast and taking the "chill-off" will not work.  So, throw the roast in the oven cold; right out of the fridge.  Basically, start-off "hot and high"; about 450 to an internal temp of 100 to 105. Then, turn it down to 250 and roast to an internal temp of about 125 to 130.

As to the Yorkshire pudding, if you do not have enough roast juices or fat (which is usually my problem), you can substitute melted beef tallow or, in a pinch, melted butter.  Also, substitute Wondra flour for the AP flour, add an egg and an additional cup of milk, and add a couple of scrapings of nutmeg.  The mixture will be thin, but I have never had a bad result.

For the au jus, if, like mine, your family is not a wine drinker, just use beef broth or stock to deglaze the pan juices.  Season to taste.

I'd always fantasized about making prime rib with Yorkshire Pudding. This recipe made it work! 

I rubbed the meat with kosher sea salt, pepper, and some thyme to make an herb crust. Then I followed all the directions.

The meat was heavenly. We like ours very rare, so I cooked it to about 120 degrees using a meat thermometer. Rave reviews all around!

Yorkshire Pudding was much easier to make than I thought it would be. The instructions are clear except I used two eggs instead of 2 cups eggs. 

The au jus was excellent. We used almost all of it between the meat and the Yorkshire Pudding, but we have enough left over for our prime rib sandwiches!

This recipe is going to be a staple for our Christmas dinner.

Great recipe. The Yorkshire pudding was wonderful and easy to make. Very easy for such a tasty meal.  One change I made was something I learned from a chef I worked for many years ago.  I used pickling spice generously along with plenty of kosher salt and pepper as the seasoning for the prime rib for world class flavor.
