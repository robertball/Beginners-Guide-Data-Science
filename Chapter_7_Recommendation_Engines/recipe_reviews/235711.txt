Since our three year old's favorite dish is chili(we eat it at least once a week) and my husband is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan; I thought this recipe would appease both of them and change things up a bit! I didn't have Cheez Whiz (which of course would have made it more authentic) but I did use a condensed cheddar cheese soup and softened cream cheese whipped together to get a similar consistency, tempering/blending them both in towards the end of cooking. I also used diced fire roasted tomatoes as opposed to the spicy tomato sauce cause the three year old can handle some heat, but I didn't want any crying during dinner :) Thank you Dan for sharing this recipe! My husband has already put in requests for this dish more often during football season.

I used london broil steak, since it was on sale.  But I also added dried chilies and cayenne pepper to kick the spicy up a notch.  But overall really good!
