Great recipe! The shiitake mushrooms were fantastic. I also added a bit of goat cheese that I had lying around and needed to use up. It was a good idea!

Very good! The spinach has a distinct flavor from the rest of the quiche. I had to cook it 10min longer

This was fabulous! My husband gave high praise, too. The directions for cook time and method were just right-- no guessing or worrying about an overdone or underdone quiche. And the flavor! I did substitute regular bacon for turkey bacon (it was what we had) and kale for spinach (preference). I can't wait to make this one again!!

The first time I made this, I unintentionally altered the recipe. Not owning a pie plate at the time, I bought a pre-made pie crust that came in a shallow pie plate. As such there wasn't enough room for all the spinach the recipe called for. I made it and it was awesome. 5 stars!

After making this for a while, I decided to get a real pie plate and make it again. The result... 4 stars. The spinach was a bit overpowering compared to the taste that I was now used to. The way I make it now is that I double the onions, bacon, mushroom, broccoli, and mixed in cheese. The result... 5 stars again. :)

I also tried using non-baby spinach once and that was a mistake. Baby spinach is the way to go every time. Bon appetit!

This quiche was awesome and I will be making it again. The cooking instructions/times were spot on, which was nice. The only thing I suggest is a deep dish pie crust and if I was to change anything it would be to add a little more bacon.

I have been making quiche for years, but this recipe took it to the next level.  Restaurant quality.  A must try.  Only changes I made was used real bacon, only thing I had on hand, added a little ham and used a mixture of raw cheese with the cheddar to give the flavor a little more depth.

Terrific!! Didn’t want to buy a package of turkey bacon to use 1 slice called for in this recipe. Instead, added a heaping teaspoon of bacon grease to give this some ‘bacon’ flavor, and eliminated the 1/4 cup butter. Stirring the egg mixture into the vegetable mixture after it was placed into the pie shell seemed like an opportunity to damage the crust. Poured about 1/3 of the egg mixture into the vegetables, and then spooned the combined mixture into the pie shell with the remaining egg mixture poured into the shell. The last ten minute baking time increment, with the quiche foiled, had to be extended an extra 6 minutes to get a clean toothpick. Will make this again soon as the hungry clan devoured this quiche in a flash.

Great recipe. I was able to fill two deep dish pie crust with the veggies and made an extra batch of the egg mixture to have two beautiful, colorful quiches. I didn't add the bacon, instead used extra mushrooms. Will definitely make again.

This was an easy recipe and I added/changed ingredients. I used baby bella mushrooms, some pork breakfast sausage sliced in small rounds, and a dash of cayenne for spice. Baking at a mile high, once the dish was covered with aluminum foil, I ended up extending the cooking time about 15 minutes to get a toothpick to come out clean. My wife loved it!

I love this recipe and use it all the time. I rarely follow the recipe exactly... switching out veggies or using mandolin sliced potatoes par-baked in the pie dish instead of a crust... but I never make a quiche without pulling this recipe up for the ratios and spot-on cooking directions/ technique.  It’s delicious made as-is, but a great recipe to get creative with too.  Thank you!

Loved this recipe! I made it as directed, but used regular bacon and instead of broccoli I used frozen peas (personal taste). Also I used a combination of cheddar cheese and shredded Parmesan because it was what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe that leaves room for substitutions. I think the secret to the success of this quiche is the fact that you cook the spinach and mushrooms before putting them into the crust. I recommend using a slotted spoon to do so, in order to avoid putting the water that cooks out of the vegetable mixture into the crust—that will ensure the crust doesn’t get soggy while cooking. I also put the first 1/4 cup of cheddar onto the vegetables after putting them into the crust (not before) so that it didn’t get mixed into the water. Crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms work well in this if you don’t have shiitake.

I've made this twice now and have yet to fit it into one 9" single pie crust. Today, I made it without the vegetables and it still filled one crust to the rim. 

My recommendation is TWO DEEP-DISH crusts, 10" if you can get 'em, and skip the broccoli. Use "real" bacon. 

One 9" crust will hold THREE eggs, 1/2 cup milk, the onion & garlic, and maybe--just maybe--some mushrooms without spilling over. 

The first time I made it I had fully half the eggs left over, and that was with none of the bacon or broccoli. 

It will likely take me at least one more experiment to figure out exactly what WILL work--which says to me that the poster did not test the recipe with the instructions as written here.

This was an easy recipe and the kids loved it. I substituted a mixture of gouda and swiss instead of the cheddar and used Morningstar bacon to make it vegetarian, it turned out great!

This was the best quiche I've ever made at home, and rivals those I've had at my favorite French restaurant.  I omitted the turkey bacon because we are vegetarians, but made the rest of the recipe exactly as directed.  Do yourself a favor and spring for quality aged cheddar.  The tanginess will add a lot to this amazing dish.

This was a great recipe. I made several changes based on ingredients I had on hand and to make it more savory. I used coarsely chopped kale and onion instead of spinach and broccoli. I sauted the veggies with basil butter, savory, and thyme. I did not mix the cheese with the vegetables. Instead I sprinkled feta and cheddar on top of the vegetables. The feta made the flavor more complex and intense. I mixed chives with the egg/milk and used half the salt and a little less milk. I didn't cover the quiche for the last 10 min to allow the crust and cheese to brown and crisp. This was the best quiche I've ever made and I'll definitely use shiitakes again.

Delicious. If you don't have a deep pie crust add one egg and a little more milk to fill two store bought pie crusts.

Make sure you use a deep dish pie crust or you will have extra egg mixture. I ended up throwing out the pie crust and putting the egg mixture over crescent roll dough in an 8x8 baking dish.

I didn't have any bacon, so I skipped it. I guess I made it vegetarian then, right? I add five minutes at the very end after I took the foil off so that it firmed up a bit. It was delicious!
Next time, I'm going to sprinkle some seasoned salt on the top for a spicy kick. 
This recipe could not have been easier.

Loved it!! Wonderful and easy recipe that actually took me the amount of time it designated for. It was quick, easy and delicious. After I took my first bite, I found that there was something missing. For my own taste buds, I added some tomato sauce to mix up the texture and add a little more flavor. It was a struggle to find sides. I added green beans with onion that i bought from a local grocery store. In the end, a very good basic recipe that I made my own.

WOW! This came out absolutely perfect. I thought all the 10-minute baking increments was weird, but I followed the directions and it was just perfect; not too moist, not too dry. I even used frozen spinach instead of fresh and I was afraid it would be mushy. I didn't have bacon or green onions, either, so I can't wait to make it again with ALL the ingredients. YUM!
