Great recipe - worked really well.    I do wish that people would stop rating a recipe badly, when they haven't actually followed the instructions, or even used the ingredients as recommended

I was in a hurry so I used about 2 Tablespoons of prepared lemon grass (not the stalks). Also added a pinch each of white sugar and salt.  Used a rice cooker, but did not treat the coconut milk as liquid since it usually absorbs quickly without cooking the rice.  Therefore, I still added the usual amount of water.  Also don't use curry powder, tumeric has a much stronger flavor, but I doubled the amount stated here. I skipped the bay leaves since I was out of them, but wonder how they might have changed the flavor.  The rice was fragrant and all flavors worked together wonderfully.

This was fabulous. Was going to take a picture but it was eaten up rather quickly!  It was my first cooking experience with Lemongrass and I love the subtle flavour.  The bay leaves were perfect too. My only other comment is I either just plain forgot the salt altogether or a "pinch" is not enough. Whichever, I added a bit more to enhance the flavour. I love the coconut milk and rice combination. There was not a grain of rice left anywhere. I also used the 'low fat' version of coconut milk.  Thank you MrsE - this will be a permanent addition to my recipe box. UPDATE TIPS- Do not use brown rice and do add  extra salt. Don't forget to pound even the jarred lemongrass. Add water to the coconut milk to 2 cups liquid, remember most rice needs a 2 to 1 ratio. Use a diffuser under your pan if your heat is still too high for a gentle simmer. One day I'll remember to take a picture!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I had problems cooking rice in coconut milk with another recipe I tried, so I cooked the rice with water and 1/2 tsp of salt as I usually do, along with the rest of the ingredients except the coconut milk. When the rice was done, I added in the coconut milk. This probably made it have more of a creamy texture then the original recipe, but it was delicious.

I had a hard time with this recipe! The cocomut milk was very thick, I used curry powder instead of turmeric,which I think would have been OK. It cooked much quicker than the recipe suggested, even at a very low heat and  it was very dry because the moisture was gone before the rice was fully cooked. I had planned to take it to our church Christmas party but ended up throwing it out, even after keeping it overnight, thinking I might be able to doctor it up a little. I love lemongrass and coconot milk together as in Thai food so I might try this recipe again.

I was very disappointed by this recipe. It was very bland overall. I could taste the lemongrass but not the coconut milk. Just like another reviewer described, the rice cooked way too fast even at a very low temperature and stuck to the bottom of the pan. I had to add 1 cup of water for the rice to finish cooking w/o burning.

This is really good, but I had to add a significant amount of salt, and I added some fresh cilantro once the rice was finished cooking. Next time I'll add extra lemongrass.

Very appealing and fragrant!  I love trying new tastes and foods so this was even more of treat.  I'm hooked on lemongrass now.  I did change the recipe based on comments and a friends' advice.  I used one tin of coconut milk and two cups of instant rice.  Not a fan of instant anything but this may be the first time this stuff turned out perfectly.  Also, I can't stand bay leaves and left them out.  This is definitely a pot luck dish.  Thank you MrsElaineous!

This has potential. I found that the tumeric was not quite strong enough so I added 2 tbsp of curry powder. The rice would just not soften. It was burning the bottom of the pan. I kept having to add water which made it eventually lose taste. Next time I think I will try having pre-cooked rice and then adding the ingrdients.

I followed the recipe except I used brown basmati (with more liquid) and cooked it in the rice cooker.

The color and aroma were lovely but the finished dish was a disappointment.  It wasn't distinctive at all and with the additional fat and calories from the coconut milk I wanted bigger flavors.  I might try it again with less coconut milk and more water for the brown rice, or use jasmine rice.

Great with homegrown lemongrass. Just use the whole can of coconut milk, toying with the idea of using coconut cream. It was a very versatile recipe if you use the exact ingredients mentioned  And then add  things

Very good recipe!  Much more flavourful and interesting than plain rice.  I put all ingredients in my rice cooker and it turned out great!

We loved this, but I did make some changes, after reading the reviews...I used 1 cup of coconut milk (I used lite), and 1 cup of water to cook the rice in and added extra salt, to taste. Also, I didn't have fresh lemongrass, so I used some dried (not exactly sure how much b/c I didn't measure it).  I loved the color and we thought it tasted nice. I had no issues with the rice sticking and being underdone, but I'm sure that's because I cut the milk with water. I would def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was really looking forward to this and was sadly disappointed.  I followed the directions other than using 1 tbsp dried lemongrass instead of the fresh because that's what I had.  The texture was fine (I added about 1 cup extra water per other reviews) but the taste was pretty bad.  It somehow had a bitter undertaste.
