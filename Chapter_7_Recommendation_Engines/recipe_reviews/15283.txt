I've had several requests for this recipe! If you press a few of the dried cranberries onto the top of the cookies before you bake them, it makes it a very pretty cookie. I also like to use Orange-flavored Craisins instead of the regular flavor with this cookie.

These are fabulous!  Don't skimp on any of the orange ingedients--I even used a little extra zest.  And I also splurged on the dried cranberries from the produce department, which really seemed to make a difference.  I doubled the recipe to and got about 40 nice sized cookies.  Used them in a cookie exchange, everyone thought at first glance that they were chocolate chip, but were very surpised once they tasted them.  And everyone asked for the recipe!  These are going to be a Christmas tradition from now on!

these are delicious - though I agree with some of the reviews that said that they are on the sweeter side. next time I'll use a little less sugar (white, the brown stays). They are also a liiiittle cakey, but that's why we love them so much. Oh and I used orange-flavored craisins, and skipped the essence - worked just fine.

Yummy, I really enjoyed these cookies.  I rolled my cookies into balls and then sugar.  They baked up beautifully.  I always use a chilled baking sheet - easy to do in the winter and the bottoms don't get too brown.

A refreshing, light, and easy to make cookie.  The orange flavour is wonderful. I placed one or two dried cranberries in the center of each cookie just before baking to make them look even more festive.

Very good recipe! I doubled the recipe, used the juice and zest of one orange and no extract. I put the cranberries in the orange juice/zest and let them soak for about 15 mins. and added them with the egg mixture and then the flour mixture. I made them into dough balls and froze them so I can take out what I want, when I want some. I did a quick roll in sugar and baked for 11 mins.

These cookies were great!  I followed the advice of some of the others and left out the orange extract.  I also bought the orange flavored crasins.  Great flavor!

I made these for Christmas. Everyone enjoyed them. They basically are a chocolate chip cookie dough with cranberries and orange flavoring. Next time I will chop the cranberries.

They're a little too sweet to me. I'll cut down on sugar next time. I used more orange zest and a little pulp from the juiced orange. Very refreshing and tasty. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These were very good cookies.  I used thawed frozen canberries and chopped them small. I had no oranges, so just added the juice, but also chopped up about 1/4 cup white chocolate and added that.  They ARE cakey and scone-like, but that is the charm!  Very unusual.  Kids liked them alot - I will reduce the white sugar to 3/4 C (sweet-probably because of the chocolate)  No need for the icing.  Thanks for the new Christmas cookie!

I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the amount after reading some rave reviews. However, my cookies turned out to be more cake-like than cookie-like. It could be me ... I don't think anyone will touch it!

These tasted great. We use an orange liquor in place of the orange extract. I love the two flavors together. I will make these again.

You might as well bake cranberry bread because that is what the consistency of this cookie is like. It baked more like a muffin than a cookie. Ok taste, nothing spectacular. I made some orange icing for the top that made them tastier.

These cookies were really good, a great way to use up leftover Craisins from Christmas! I used a 1 tbsp scoop and got 37 cookies, my batter was dry so I had to add more juice, I omitted the orange extract because I used orange flavoured Craisins. These cookies really stick, I used a silpat lined pan and even then had to use my bench scraper to remove them or the bottoms ripped, definitely use silpat or parchment paper and a spatula to remove them.

These were really good! I made them with half WW flour and I also added some cocoa powder to the flour mix which really complimented the organge flavour. I didn't have any orange essence but it was fine without. I made 2 batches, baked one for 9 mins and the other for 11 mins, the 9 min batch was definitely better. I'll make these again!

These are the best cookies!  I doubled the batch and took them for a cookie exchange.  Made them for my neighbors too.  Substitute Chocolate chips for the Cranberries and you have another great cookie!

This is really fruity and delightfully zesty!  As another review commented, this cookie is a bit cake-like, but I used 1/2 of the baking soda and the cookies turned out less cake-y. Also, make the cookies really small to make it chewier.

Made these for Thanksgiving day munching, definitely an any occasion cookie!  I think they taste similar to the "scones" that are sold in the grocery bakeries, really great with a cup of tea or coffee. I added some almonds and white chocolate chips too, definitely a keeper!

These are absolutely wonderful! Moist and fragrant, these are perfect for the fall/winter season. I didn't have orange extract so omitted it, but otherwise did not change a thing. Delightful. Thank you for sharing!

A very tasty recipe, though I didn't get anywhere near 36 cookies, and mine weren't really large.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, which went very well with the cranberry orange flavors.

These were pretty good.  I did change the cranberries for chocolate chips, the only thing mine didn't puff up like in the picture.  They were flatter but still tasted yummy.

YUMMY!!!  Had just a little bit of OJ leftover and some cranberries that nobody seemed to be eating, so I made these today.  They are delicious.  The combination of orange juice and orange extract really brings out the flavor.  The cranberries add just the right amount of tartness.  I finished off mine with a glaze of OJ and powdered sugar, but they are delicious without. 8/29 Made these again today without the glaze, but threw in some white chocolate chips, yum!

Yum!  Used gluten free all purpose flour, doesn't rise well but still tastes good!  Left out orange zest, too lazy to grate.  1st time I forgot the orange extract.  Teens all said needs more orange flavor.  2nd time forgot it again & added more orange juice & cookies were really flat because too much liquid.  Also used dried cranberry-cherry-blueberry mix instead of just cranberry.  Delicious even though the cookies were flat, they were like crispy orangey wafers!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I doubled the recipe, but kept the cranberries to single amount and that was plenty for me.  I also iced them with powdered sugar, creamed with a bit of butter, thinned with orange juice to frosting consistency -- very tasty!

Gave it 5, 'cause it comes up to the decription, the picture, and the comments.  Doubled the recipe with no problem.

these are lovely and very forgiving. I mistakenly added 1/2 tsp soda, so I reduced the baking powder to 1/4 tsp and they came out beautiful. not cakey, but like a toll house consistency. used Trader Joe's orange flavored cranberries, and just added the zest of one orange, with the extract as specified. beautiful flavor. also added some walnuts. so refreshing. love them.

I made these without the orange extract and used the zest of one orange. I think they are delicious and will definately be making them again- they are moist and chewy with just the right balance of flavors.  I actually ended up with about four and a half dozen small cookies, and everyone who tried them has loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

omg. i was making a batch for my boss and wanted to make sure they were PERFECT so i followed the recipe almost OCD exactly (actually sifted flour for the first time, used fresh-squeezed oj, and zested an orange on a grater?!) the one prob was i didnt have orange extract, so i just subbed a 1/4 tspn of pure vanilla extract and added an extra tblspn of orange juice. im not sure if the extra oj was to blame but the dough was pretty sticky.. so i popped it in the fridge for a bit to harden it up. baked for 12/13 mins... smelled amazing, burnt my mouth on the first bite. and i regret sampling them bc now i want to eat them all. also, maybe i made my cookies too big but there's no way i see more than 24 coming out of this amount of dough...

3.5 stars, if I could. They aren't bad, they just aren't a recipe I'd make again. I used all the zest of one orange and then the fresh orange juice from it - no extract (blech). They are decent cookies - and they are cookies, not cake, like some reviewers said. I thought about making a glaze with fresh oj and confectioner sugar, but decided they aren't worth the extra effort... it may help a tad, but I just don't feel like it. We'll see how they go over with the coworkers tomorrow. :)

4 stars unmodified - 5 stars with a few changes. First, reduce the sugar. 1/2 cup brown UNpacked sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar is pleeenty. Second, if you don't have and don't want to buy orange extract, use 3 T of orange juice concentrate in place of the orange extract and orange juice. And lastly, the cookies do tend to burn on the bottoms (as another reviewer said), so use another cookie sheet under the one your cookies are on to insulate them a bit better. I used an airbake sheet and still had to double them to avoid burning them. Excellant fresh natural flavor in these cookies!

I doubled the batch first off. I cut back the white sugar to ¼ cup just for snicks per batch and the sugar content was ok. This cookie was a cross between bread and cake like. I used dried cranberries and I could not find the orange cranberries so I used the ones that were cherry cranberry so I used a cup of each. I use a heaping tablespoon of orange zest, which was really nice could have even taken more. Also in the picture there seems to be a drizzle on the top of the cookie which I do not see in the recipe I am assuming it is just powdered sugar and milk I also did not use the extract. These are ok the will not be a staple for me but it was a change and everyone seem to like them well enough

My mom's new favorite cookie. I just made them a couple of days ago and she's already asking for more. I added more zest than stated as suggested in others' reviews. Turned out great!

Perfect and very tasty!!!! Will make always from now on, it just became my favorit cookie! This remineded me of the orange cranberry loaf from this site which is also very good. Mine did flatten out when baking but were still soft and cake like in the middle and cruncy on the corners. I'm not sure why this happened but I will experiment with the heat the setting next time. Thanks for the recipe.

After reading the reviews, Mom & I eliminated the orange essence.  Didn't miss it at all.  The cookies turned out well.  Next time we'll try it with orange craisins & cocoa.

Simple and pretty cookies, but a little dry.  Would have been good with some type of icing sprinkled on top.

I am making these to go on my holiday cookie trays and I am afraid that I am going to have to make another batch....they are never going to last that long! Very nice delicate orange flavor with a tart bite from the cranberries. I found that I had to bake them a little longer than the recipe called for, about 14 minutes, and they were more flat than in the pictures, but that may be because I am in Florida and it's 80* today and humid. They are delicious though!

These were a HUGE hit this Christmas. I made them for everyone and attached a few with each gift. Everyone loved them and talked about how unique they were. The orange flavor perfectly compliments the cranberries.  I added chocolate chips to one batch, but wasn't crazy about it. The chocolate overpowers the other flavors. Stick with the original and you'll be happy!

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time the cookies came out a bit too "cakey" although they tasted delicious.  I adjusted the recipe when I baked them again, doubling the amount of orange extract, adding another 20 grams of flour and reducing the amount of dried cranberries to 85gr.  The oven temperature I reduced to 180deg.C as (like a previous reviewer) I found the cookies browned just a bit too quickly when cooked at 190deg.C.  The second baking with adjustments had the cookies turn out perfect!... delicious, crispy outside but still a little cakey inside.  A definite "keeper" recipe

... I wasn't too thrilled about these. Neither was my guinea pig (hubby). I wanted something different to add to my array of Holiday cookies, and this one I found to be more of an everyday cookie. Not very festive in taste or appearance. These cookies are light and airy so I can see why some others have said they were indeed cake-like. My sister liked them, but I thought these weren't good enough to add to my cookie swap recipes. The orange flavor was barely noticeable although I added the zest of 2 large navel oranges (in leiu of the orange extract), orange-flavored Craisins and the orange juice specified. These seemed more suitable for a brunch or teatime treat, but then again, they weren't that impressive or memorable. Okay, I'm venting... perhaps I'm a bit than disappointed. Sorry :(

these were really tasty! they werent outstanding or anything, but were a very good soft and chewy cookie. i was a little nervous because it only had a 1/4 cup of butter, but it turned out great! i didnt have any orange extract so i substituted it with more orange zest. these cookies are awesome for when your having a sweet tooth and dont want something too fattening.

I followed the recipe to the T and mine didn't look like drops at all, but flattened out a la choc chip cookies.  I even refridgerated them so that they would look more like drops because the batter seemed too soft.  Even though they didn't look like how I thought they should look, husband still liked them saying "I don't usually like fruit cookies".  They are yummy, maybe I should add some more flour or use concentrated OJ instead of prepared stuff.

enjoy!

These cookies were good.  Nothing I would rave about but nothing was wrong with them.  They certainly weren't "beautiful".  They looked like chocolate chip cookies with cranberries.  They'll be good for filling up a cookie tray but won't make it to the top.  The flavor is good for a holiday cookie.

Great recipe!! The tartness blends so well with the orange, but I used frozen cranberries and the juice as they cooked made them so chewy. A hint, if using fresh cranberries..push them into each cookie to make sure they don't slip out. Plus my 12 year old son made it totally by himself and all the children enjoyed them as well...and they are actually eating fresh frozen cranberries--who would have known.

I enjoyed the recipe but I added another 1/4 tsp of salt to pull out the flavors. Everything else stayed the same. I'm guessing the people who ended up with cakier cookies used a stand mixer or electric mixer because that happens when you overbeat the dough after adding the egg or they used a larger size than standard large egg (which is go to egg in baking).

This recipe has quickly become one of my favorites! I am generous with the orange zest and the dried cranberries, too. I strongly suggest substituting more fresh juice from the zested orange instead of the orange extract. The taste is fresher. And you should probably go ahead and double the recipe. It will save you having to make another batch the next day!

I am the known baker in the family, so when I was asked to make cookies for my Grandpa's memorial, I began looking for new recipes.  I made this recipe, and I was told that ALL of the former cookie recipes could be tossed, and this is the one they want from here on out.

I didn't add any Orange zest and I think it gave it more of a subtle hint of citrus.

Loved these!  Orange, cranberry, and spice are a great combo and were a really big hit around holiday time, though they'd be great year round.  Easy to make.  This cookie recipe is now one of my standards, right up there with chocolate chip!

Cut down the white sugar to 1/4 cup, cut out the extract, and increase the orange juice (freshly squeezed) to 1/3 cup.  Also I replaced the cranberries for chocolate chips.  Excellent.

Mine looked nothing like the picture, they turned out flat and chewy, not cakey at all.  I have no idea why but they were still fantastic!

Overall this is a good cookie.  The only alteration I made was not to use orange essence as I didn't have any.  I added a bit more zest instead.  I didn't not find these overly sweet at all and I didn't mind the "cakiness".  What I didn't like were the dried cranberries.  It might have been because I could only find sweetened dried cranberries but there was no cranberry taste (that tart/sour taste).  I think you could easily sub fresh cranberries (because of the cakiness).  Also these cookies are very plain and would be great with an orange flavoured icing.  I did add some coloured sugar to mine to make them more festive.  Will make again but with the alterations.

I made these yesterday for the first (but definitely not the last) time yesterday, following the recipe exactly. These tasty little morsels are a great change of pace from so many of the typical holiday cookies - the tang of the orange and cranberry combination is wonderful with a good cup of coffee. I did get the recipe yield of 36, but they were quite small. Next time I'll do a double batch and increase the size of cookies a bit. I used regular Craisins but next time will try this with the orange-flavored ones. Overall, a real hit with my husband and me. Will definitely make these a holiday cookie try tradition.

These is one of my new favorite cookies.  I left out the zest and added two tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate (straight out of the can) and lowered the liquid to 1 tablespoon.  I have used both regular and orange flavored craisins.  Both were yummy!

So good! I've made these three or four times in the past few weeks, and they disappear quickly each time! I added about 1/3 cup of walnuts to the batter, which gave the cookies a nice crunch. I'm a kid at heart, so I also made a quick orange frosting for these too using the orange extract. If you're feeling ambitious, a little orange food coloring in the frosting can echo the flavor! Don't go heavy on the frosting though, since this is a sweet cookie to begin with. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved it.... I used orange water (persian/arabic) instead of the essence, I also cut the white sugar to 1/4 of a cup and instead of having all cranberries I put equal parts of chocolate chips, cranberries and pecans.... delicious!!!

Ohh what a smell!!
I doubled the recipe right off the bat, except for the sugar I only added 1 cup raw sugar and 1/2 cup orange marmalade. I also used 1cup of spelt flour for some of the flour, then added 1 cup white chocolate chips. For 1/2 the batter I also used some walnuts and drizzled all of them with unsweetened chocoloate.
Will be making these again.

My husband can't get enough of these. Did not change a thing but to double the recipe. I am now on my second batch in as many days. Very moist and chewy cookie. Picked up some dried cranberries from the Amish. Big and pump. As far as beautiful, i guess that is in the eye of the beholder. The taste is definantly there. Very good cookie for the holidays and as gift giving.

These cookies are amazing.  I was a bit hesitant at first, but saw that it was rated high, and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did.  They are wonderful, and everyone who has tried them has raved about them.  I stuck to the original recipe.

I increased butter to 1/2 cup and added more orange zest. After they cooled, I added an orage glaze (powdered sugar and orange juice). The tart and citrus combination is delicious!! All of it was gone in less than an hour!

AMAZING. I didn't have orange extract, so I just used some extra zest and juice. Also, I soaked the cranberries in the juice before

These were nice, especially topped with orange flavoured icing, but man that is a lot of cranberries. I doubled the recipe but only increased the cranberries a little (I had about 1.25 cups on hand so used that) and found them plenty. Can't imagine having the whole lot in there. Aside from the masses of cranberries, these were good.

If you like the Pittsburgh holiday treat called Farkleberry cookies, just add some white chocolate chips, dust finished cookies in confectioner sugar and enjoy!!

I first started baking these in 2005 and they became a family holiday favorite.  When I first started baking them they looked like a drop cookie (similar to the second photo). However, the last two years they come out flat  and sticky (similar to the featured photo). I cannot figure out what is causing them to turn out flat and how to get them to turn out like they did the first  several years.

Has anyone else had this problem?

Edited to add solution.  

After researching what could cause this outcome, I followed David Lebovitz's tips found on his website "Tips to Keep Cookies from Spreading." I was over creaming the sugar and butter.  I implemented his tips and they came out perfectly again!

The taste was great, really loved it. Maybe the problem was me, but didn't get the consistency right - turned out more scone-like than cookie-like. That's the only reason for not giving it the fifth star.

Wonderful cake like cookies; I substituted Grand Marnier for the orange juice and vanilla extract. Also used all dark brown sugar.
Added simple lemon glaze with little Grand Marnier added to it as well...  Intense, grown up flavor... It was very hard for my boyfriend and I not to eat the whole batch warm out of the oven!!!! Definitely added to my favorite cookie recipes of all time

I followed the recipe (aside from adding a little extra zest as the reviews suggested). These cookies are awesome!! Depending on how they mail, I'll make them again! 

Update: these mail well and I have loads of requests to make them again!!! Definitely a 5 star recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly and applied the pictured glaze.  My cookies were cake-like.  Next time I will use self-rising flour instead of the regular flour, baking powder, and baking soda so they will be more like cookies than mini-cakes.

These were very refreshing. I didn't add orange extract and there's plenty of orange flavor. They flattened out a bit which was fine but in the future, if I want them fluffy, I will put them in the fridge.

These are absolutely fantastic. I love the tangy sweet orange flavor conbination. I just can't stop eating them.  The only change I made was to omit the white sugar.  Still delicious!

Very refleshing cookies.  We all loved the flavor.  I accidently missed the orange extract, but the orange flavor coming from the zest was good enough.  This recipe is a keeper.

Even my son who likes to make cookies but really doesnt care for sweets liked these. They were a hit. I only give four stars because I did have to add alot more orange zest and juice to give them flavor. But this is a fantastic base recipe.

This is a really great cookie recipe.  I made it for the first time along with other traditional cookies, candies, and bars. But this cookie is the one that everyone keeps asking for more of!  It is so chewy and flavorful.  We used the fresh squeezed juice from the orange we grated and it was so good!  I definitely agree with the suggestion to press some of the dried cranberries on time. I really think they add something to the overall appearance/taste of the cookie.  WARNING: These cookies will go fast!  I went through 6 dozen in week!

I did not change the recipe and my cookies came out flat. I use no salt butter and measure all ingredients accurately.  I use stoneware and use parchment paper so I can remove the cookies easily. I rechecked all my ingredients and nothing was omitted.

A nice change from the traditional cookies.  Make sure you don't over melt the butter or over beat the dough.  I did both on my first batch and ended up with flat cookies.  Also go ahead and add the orange juice instead of water.  If you were expecting a lot of cookies, just start by doubling the recipe b/c I found it didn't make that many as is.  Happy snacking!

The intense orange smell from these cookies make them irresistible to me!
As some others mentioned, I used half white, half wheat flour.  I also did not have orange extract, so I substituted with almond.  I figured that I love oranges, cranberries and almonds in my salad, so why not in a cookie?!  Oh, and I threw in a few chocolate chips just for fun.

Very good cookies! I used orange flavored cranberries to enhance the orange flavor. Also, I decreased the amount of white sugar and they were planty sweet. Crisp on the edges, and cakey in the middle.

I loved these!! I made exactly as described and they were a hit at my cookie exchange.
 I think when the holidays are over I'm going to try them with chocolate chips instead of the cranberried. I love orange and chocolate.

Cookie would be great as it is.changes I made was to use Smart Balance marg. and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I also used only 1/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c br. sugar. Another addition I made was to chop about 1/2 cup fresh cranberries in additon to the dried ones. Just trying to make it a little more healthy.

These are delicious!  Didn't have orange extract, just used orange flavored dried cranberries.  Great for Christmas.

These were quite cakey rather than a crisp or chewy cookie but they were delicious. I followed advice from others and reduced the sugar, also added a spoonful of marmalade. Will definitely make again!

A few comments..
These were very "orangey". I was hoping for more of a sweet tart contrast with the cranberries.
The recipes yield says 3 dozen. However, it made just over 2 dozen. I had to make another batch because I really needed the entire amount.
I agree with those who said they are rather plain looking cookies. I also added an oranage glaze.

These cookies are delicious. I don't know why others think they are unattractive(?). I used a melon baller (one of the handiest gadgets I have ever bought) and I think the cookies look just fine. :-) I drizzled an orange glaze on them which gave a nice finishing touch.

These cookies were wonderful. My kids love them. I agree with previous reviews, that they aren't the prettiest cookie. But they taste and texture more than make up for it. It could use a garnish like what is in the picture, however, I think a glaze on the top would make it too sweet. Will definately make these again.

Not much to look at, but delicious, with a lovely, chewy texture, and very easy.  My eight year old loved dipping them in his milk.

These cookies were very good.  Not my favorite, but still good.  I think they would taste best with a glaze or icing on top.  I liked the spongy consistency.

Although I get about half of the recipes I try from Allrecipes.Com, this is the first review I have submitted.  These cookies are wonderful! My husband won't eat cranberries so I brought them to work and they are getting rave reviews this morning! Definately a recipe I will use often!

These cookies were very good. I doubled the recipe adding more cranberries. I also found the dough to be a bit sticky, so I may add a bit more flour the next time. To make them even better, I topped them with an orange glaze(powdered sugar, OJ and orange extract) YUMMY!!!

These cookies are the best!  I made so many batches of these over the holidays...family & friends just couldn't get enough.  The citrus combined with the cranberries give it such wonderful flavor.

These tasted really good, but had a strange spongey consistency that I wasn't too sure about.  Not my favorite cookies of all time, but I had no complaints.
