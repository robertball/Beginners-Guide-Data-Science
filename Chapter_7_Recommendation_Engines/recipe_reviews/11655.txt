Tasty.  I used only once cup chips, and that was plenty.

I got mixed reactions for these cookies, but they were generally positive.  The general consensus seemed to be that people loved them for being so different and yummy, but there is a lot going on at one time (apricots, white chips, and almonds).  When I made them, I chopped up whole almonds and toasted them before mixing them into the dough, so they were super fresh.  After reading some of the reviews, I tried using a cup of diced almonds, but I think if I ever make them again, I'll try to reduce it to 3/4 cup.

I have to agree with some of the reviewer's who said there are too many chips and not enough apricots.  I love apricots, so to make these again I'd double them and 1/4 the chips.  Or, I'd do less sugar and 1/2 the chips along with doubling the apricots, as this dough ends up too sweet for my tastes.  I even halved the white chips on this first batch--so glad I did.  White chips tend to be sweet, so it's important to watch the amount you put in.  Otherwise, though, these are easy and basic cookies that are worth another shot.  Thanks for the recipe!

They're good cookies with nice texture, but I think they're too sweet even though I cut back on the white chocolate chips.  They have some crispness when they're first baked, but then become soft because of the apricots in them.  I didn't like them as much after the first day simply because I prefer a crisper cookie.

A nice combination of fruit, sweet, and nut flavors. I love almonds so I used small whole ones and toasted them at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes before adding them to the dough. I also read other postings and used only 1 cup of chips. The consistency and dough-to-filling proportions of this recipe weren't to my liking in the first batch, so I upped the butter to a full cup, added an egg and increased the flour to 2 1/4 cups. this makes more substantial, slightly cakier cookies, and a whole lot more of them. my cookie-connoiseur friends don't like white chocolate much so next time I will leave out the chips and apricot and use dates for fruit AND sweetness.

It's hard to rate this recipe since I'm no fan of white chips - but  white-chip enthusiasts will be delighted, because the dairy/vanilla chip flavor dominates the finished cookie. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, 1 cup of chips is plenty. I also used 1 c diced apricots and 1 c sliced almonds instead of the 3/4 c. called for in the recipe. The cookies were still quite sweet. Be sure your oven is not too hot - if the chips melt  they make the cookies spread out and get oily. I had to be vigilant about rotating the sheets around my oven's hot spot.   (This happened with Nestle chips - other brands may behave differently).  This would be a good cookie for an event where other people are also bringing cookies, since it's a bit unusual yet quite easy to make.

I thought this recipe had too much butter! The cookies came out kind of greasy and I don't like greasy cookies. The combination of flavors was great though and everyone enjoyed them. When I make next time I will use only 1/2 c butter. Thanks for an interesting recipe!

These were a huge hit in my holiday gift tins. I found that two full cups of white chocolate was way too much. The ratio of tastes worked better for me with 1 cup of chips and 1 cup of apricots. Also turned out quite nicely using dried cranberries instead of apricots.

I only used half a cup of butter, and I had no brown sugar so I substituted white. I would do brown next time though, as the white chocolate and apricots are sweet enough as it is.

Deeeeeeeeeelish!

I have always had a weakness for white chocolate and cranberries.  This recipe pieced together my two favourite trets in one cookie.  I loved it, and my entire family loved it!!!  I even, for xmas, gave away some jars with all the dry ingrediants and attatched a little card to it with directions and wet ingrediants...I gave one to my mother in law...to my suprise, the most hard-to-please-woman was impressed with this gift....NOW THAT EXPLAINS ITS GREATNESS!!!   I will be making these cookies far into the future!

These are nice cookies, but I am rather disappointed with them. Figuring out how long to bake them was a problem because they needed another 5 minutes or so in my oven (electric)to get to a point where they didn't fall apart when taking them off the cookie sheet.  I followed the recommendation of several reviewers to use only one cup of white chocolate chips, which was good.  These are sweet cookies anyway & with 2 cups they would have been way too sweet for my taste.  I also found that I do not get as much of the apricot flavor as I would have liked.  If I make them again, I would increase the dried apricots to at least one cup, consider leaving out the white chocolate chips altogether.

I also have friends who don't like white chocolate, so I made these with 1 cup of apricots and toasted chopped almonds.  They came out great!  Didn't seem greasy at all using 3/4 c butter. The greasiness probably comes from the white chocolate.

thank you Suzanne, these cookies are really something.
I discovered only too late that I hadn't got apricots enough and I put also some candied cherries and it was a good solution.
I can't find the white chips and had to chop the chocolate, but it 's been worth while!
definitely a keeper.

Followed the recipe as written. I did make the dough into balls and froze them on a baking tray, once frozen I store in a ziplock bag until needed.  I find this helps stopping all cookies from being flat, but also a good way to control portions.

I gave this 4 stars because I modified it a bit.  First off, I used the ingredients as a base and they went very well together.  These adjustments were more to our liking (less sweet) Waay too many chips, white chips are very sweet!  Here is what I did - 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c white chips (I can't imagine what 2 cups of chips would taste like), 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1/2 c sweetened coconut. Placed into fridge for 10-15 min and made into small (1 inch or so) balls and flattened slightly.  I only got a little more than 2 dozen due to using smaller amounts.  These cooked about 13-14 min.

I seem to be in the minority but I just didn't like these cookies at all.  The texture and look were fine, but I didn't care for the flavor.  My husband got generic white chocolate so maybe that was part of the problem, but these were the last cookies to be eaten.

This recipe was wonderful. Since I had already baked apricot bars, I substituted the dried apricots for dried cranberries. Yum! The white chocolate went so well with the cranberries!!

I had to write a review about these cookies.  I had a little extra time today and tried the recipe.  Both my husband and I love them, and it will be a recipe to make time and time again.  Absolutely delicious.  What a winning combination.

I loved these cookies.  I thought the cookie base was soft and chewy with great variation of texture from the dried apricots and chips.  I used cashews instead of almonds (personal taste) with only 1 cup white chips and 6oz of diced apricots so they weren't overly sweet.  Not the most popular cookie I take into work.  I think they're perfect for the right group, but maybe not so much for the masses

I was looking for a cookie recipe using dried apricots and found this one.  I do like sweet things, so amounts in this recipe were perfect.  I did use pecans instead of almonds because of preference, but I think I've found "my cookie".  The combination of flavors was a delight and difficult to express, just to say, loved it!  Thanks for having the recipe available.
