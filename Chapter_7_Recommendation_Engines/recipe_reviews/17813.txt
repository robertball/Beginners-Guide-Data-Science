It's a refreshing new taste that I hadn't had before; I thought I'd try it out, and well, my rating says it all :)) This one is a keeper. The easiness rating is 3 coz you need a blender to make the marinade, but apart from that - superb!

Very tasty!  I marinated these overnight to let the flavors really seep in.  They weren’t so much spicy as they were tangy from the lime and cilantro.  They are very good served with the honey mustard sauce that can also be found here at All Recipes.  I think that I will use less breading next time because it didn’t really crisp like I thought it would.

My husband loved this one. I sprayed some olive oil on top, but they were still not as crispy as I would have liked. (I'll have to work on that.) I served it with nice green salad with spicy thai peanut dressing. Very good together.

wow, I really don't know what to say about this one, I really didn't care for it at all, but the people who ate it just loved it, 4 people finishing off 7 servings (I made some plain breaded chicken for me).  It defintly takes longer than 20 minutes to bake, the breading was a little slimey at the end so I brought my oven up to 400 for the last little bit of cooking

Fancied a little something different.  Was very pleased with results.  Couldn't find Cilantro in local shops so unfortunately had to make do without.  It still had a nice tangy but spicy flavour as we decided to UP the chilli quantities.  We served with Spicy Thai Noodles.  Yummy!

Awesome! Husband and I loved this, but it definitely needs a dipping sauce. I used leftover marinade and added same amount dijon mustard to make my sauce.

This rating comes from hubby and the kids. I'm not a lime person, so my opinion doesn't count here. My kids pretty much love almost everything I've ever made from this site, but hubby tends to rate most dishes one star lower then they do. Tonight, however, he raved and gave this dish a full five stars! Due to allergies, I omitted the lemon grass and subbed with a little rind and juice of a lemon. Due to hatred of cilantro, we eliminated that and used parsley. I added garlic and onion powders to the breading and sprayed the chicken with olive oil. I marinated the chicken overnight which resulted in an amazingly moist breast. Family thanks you Shabern!

Tastey and unique.  I used chicken thighs instead. Only had time to marinade for 2 hours, could have gone longer.  I boiled the leftover marinade and added some coconut milk and sugar to make sauce. It did not brown properly, next time I would try the olive oil on top suggestion.

Good. Not great. I'd recommend doing the olive-oil trick for crispier coating, and go easy on the breading. Don't crowd the breasts in the pan or it gets kind of gunky on the bottom. All in all, not very "Thai-like," so if you're looking for a really good Thai recipie, this isn't it. Might be a good intro for someone not experienced or even familiar with Thai food.

Yummy!  I'll be making this one again.  It was a bit time-consuming with all the chopping but it was worth it.

This was good, but it takes some time to make the marinade.  I made mine in the blender, which worked fine.

My husband and I were looking to make a treat and found this recipe. It was great! We followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. A nice change from just straight chicken strips and dip. We used some sweet chili sauce for dipping.

This recipe was a great way to spice up chicken! I served it with the Thai Rice Salad from this site and it was a very satisfying meal.

quite good, very juicy and nice thai flavors. I don't know about the mustard and parmesan in there, I reduced the amount used of those. And I used "shredded" oats instead of bread crumbs to make it a little bit healthier. All in all tasty and fast dinner. Served it with basmati rice and salad.

Very good... I brushed olive oil on the chicken after half an hour and turned up the temperature to 400 degrees for an extra ten minutes for crispyness. Served with a side of white rice and salad. Guests loved it!
