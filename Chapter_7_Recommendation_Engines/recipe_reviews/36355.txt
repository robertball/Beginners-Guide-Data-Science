Such a glamorous treat!  
I actually searched every grocery store in the area and could not find cinnamon chips, so I used Hershey's toffee bits instead... Still - such a success!
These scones literally melt in your mouth and I'm told they're beautiful enough to sell!
I recommend dividing the recipe into 8 pieces instead of 6 - they're still huge!

FYI To find the cinnamon chips in ur area, go to the Hersheys home page, on the left side of page hit the product locator, in less than a minute u will have a list of stores that sell the chips in ur area.  Like others I didn't know that cinnamon chips existed so I will be going shopping tomorrow.

Wow, these are sure to impress anyone who sees them or tastes them!  This was my first time baking scones, and they turned out perfect for my best friends baby shower!  I used pastry flour and chilled the dough before rolling it out, and I used my pizza cutter to cut out the wedges.  Additionally, I sprinkled the tops with some course sanding sugar crystals, and then drizzled the melted cinnamon chips and chocolate!  Honestly, these were better than scones I have bought from the local bakery!

These were wonderful! I made them for my husband because he loves the cinnamon scones at the bakery and he liked these better.
I too could not find any cinnamon chips so I used Toffee pieces. I also used white chocolate chips because the market was out of Hugs. I added a TBL of cinnamon. 
Next time, I would make eight scones, as they were very big, and I would omit the drizzling on top...just because my husband prefers them that way.

I have never taken this recipe anywhere and not been royally reamed for not bringing more.  Even my husband asks me to make this recipe and he doesn't like very many baked products.

This is the best recipe.

These scones are not only tender and moist, but also very flavorful. I have never been a fan of scones since I always felt they were too dry, but this recipe has changed my thought on that! I substituted white chocolate chips for the hugs since it is what I had on hand. I melted them with one teaspoon of butter, and gradually added the sour cream mixture to the melted chocolate. I increased the lemon zest to 1 tablespoon. In place of the cinnamon chips I chopped 1/2 cup of pecans and placed in small bowl with 1 teaspoon of butter and then sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, mix well before microwaving for 30 seconds. Mix again and cool slightly before adding to partially mixed dough. The secret is to not overmix the dough or the scones will be tough instead of moist and tender. I cut the dough into eight scones, brushed with the cream and  then sprinkled with raw sugar for an added crunch, and baked for 20 minutes, Do not overbake.  For the topping I melted 1 cup of white chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon of butter and the juice of 1/2 lemon. I added 1/2 cup of powder sugar and enough milk to obtain the right consistency, frosting hardened nicely on scones.   The lemon flavor with the chocolate is a nice combination. Wonderful recipe!

Wow.  I have never had a scone before but I had cinnamon chips and wanted to make something different with them.  I didnt have lemon zest and maybe it adds something to the recipe but it didnt sound good to me to be honest.  I didnt have cream either so I just brushed the tops with good ol whole milk.  I drizzled melted hugs AND the cinnamon chips on top.  For those of you who have never had a scone, it is somewhat like a biscuit but oh so much better!  I am definitely keeping this recipe in my file.

Absolutely amazing! I couldn't find cinnamon chips at 4 different stores so I just used Heath toffee bits and they worked just fine. This was my first time making scones and they turned out just right! I also made this into 8 scones, they were plenty big enough.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the texture of these turned out like chocolate chip cookies.  They were very good though.  Just not a scone texture.  I would like to try again - see if I get a scone texture, if not I will make cookies out of them.

Awesome.  I couldn't find cinnamon chips so I substituted butterscotch.  Also opted to use Hershey's Bliss white chocolate, Hugs seemed like a weird combo.  I loved the lemon zest flavor. I drizzled the melted butterscotch only on top.  This was so good with the butterscotch I don't know if I would even switch to the cinnamon chips next time.  Definitely a remake!

This is a family favorite.  I am requested to make it every year for Christmas morning, but nobody complains if I make them more often.  These make a good-sized scone, so I cut the wedges in 12 and reduce the baking time.

I made these using toffee bits for a mother's day brunch (I was able to find cinnamon chips, but was already making cinnamon buns also, and decided I didn't want to make two things cinnamon).  I was most disapointed with these because the perfect little triangles of dough I put in the oven came out twisted in all sorts of shapes.  They looked very rustic, and that was not what I was aiming for!  They weren't very popular at the brunch, either.

These are amazing scones! I couldn't find cinnamon chips and didn't want to buy Hershey's Hugs, so I used white chocolate chips in the batter, added 1 1/2 tsps. cinnamon and drizzled melted white chocolate chips on top. Turned out great!

I doubled the recipe and shared with my sister, mom, dad, brother-in-law, boyfriend and even my 14 month old nephew, they all loved these.  I was getting calls the next day asking when I was going to make more.  These are a little time consuming because I had to unwrap all the hugs but well worth it!!

I made these for a potluck scone lunch at work.  I could not find the cinnamon chips, so I used crushed cinnamon candy.  Also used white chips instead of the Hugs.  I was able to get 8 scones, and they still were pretty large.  Everyone loved them and they do look so pretty. Thanks Sally Sibthorpe for posting.

I made these for my mom and she loved them.

Here is a tip, however, don't bake them on a dark colored cookie sheet, use a lighter colored metal cookie sheet.  I forgot and used a dark colored sheet, which made the bottoms of the scones bake up very dark quickly while the rest was still doughy and raw.  

I had to then turn the oven down to 300 degrees to finish baking the top part.  This made them taste too dry but they were still really good, we all ate them in a day.

Also, another tip, the chips melt better in a pot on the stove than in the microwave.  Melting them in the microwave can sometimes turn them into dried hard flakes.

Next time I make these, I will try peanut butter chips instead of cinnamon.  I think these would be great with peanut butter chips and melted peanut butter chips on top.

Made these for Coffee Clutch at a nursing home.  They turned out great and were delicious.  Using the Hugs, though, the scones are not white as shown in the picture, because the Hugs contain chocolate.

These are perfect! Way better than cinnamon Panera scones. Texas bakers can find the cinnamon chips at HEB. I will make these again but cut each scone in half. They puffed up great and came out huge. Very easy to make. I used Nestle white chocolate chips instead of Hugs.

Really, really tasty and a bit unusual. I just made my third  and fourth batches yesterday. They are delicious. Before baking and after brushing with cream, I added a light sprinkling of sanding sugar on top. That little crunch was a nice addition.
