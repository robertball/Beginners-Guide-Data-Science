Wonderful! The kids loved it! I added sauteed onion, garlic, cumin, and chili powder to the sweet potatoes. Other than that, it is a great recipe. Thanks!

I was skeptical.  But the combination of flavors was delicious.  A resounding hit with the whole family and we don't even like sweet potatoes!  Only change I made was corn tortillas.  Great!  Easy, cheap, nutritious:  five stars!

I caramelized a yellow onion to add to it and included the salsa and it was SO good.  I served it at a dinner party last night and all of my guests really enjoyed it.

These were great, I added some cumin and chili powder for a little spice. My kiddos ate them up-always a plus!

I made these last night to use up left over mashed sweet potatoes and they were so good. Even my husband who isn't a bean person liked them. I used regular tortillas as it was what I had on hand and instead of salsa I served them with sour cream

Carmelized a small chopped onion, and added between 1/8 and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon along with cumin and a sprinkle of cayenne.  We didn't need the salsa, and used multigrain tortillas.  Great for the vegetarians among us!

Delicious!  I followed others suggestions and added sauteed onions and cumin.  I don't like the texture of beans, so I mashed them in with the potatoes.  So yummy!

My kids absolutely love these. I've made them multiple times, now. Be creative-- cut out a triangle, put a bean on top, and call it Pac Man!
A great way to use my seasonal sweet potatoes.

I cannot believe how absolutely simple and delicious these are.  My four year old could not stop talking and raving over them.

Cute that the quesadillas are orange but they don't taste anything like sun dried tomatoes! There are jalapeno flavored tortillas that are orange, maybe they're tastier!

I swear sometimes the simplest things turn out to be the most yummy!  I was looking for an easy filling little snack for our October potluck at work so I made the filling of mashed sweet potato with a little garlic salt, cumin, and chili powder, then stirred in the beans and about 3/4 cup of salsa to thin it out a bit and piped the filling into scoop shaped tortilla chips.  So perfect!  I roasted double the sweet potato because I didn't know how much I would need so the next time I made the same filling and served it as a side dish with some creamy chipotle chicken thighs.  Amazing!  Thanks for the inspiration.

Yummy! As well as many of you, I added some sauteed onion as well as some cinnamon to the potatoes.  And along with the beans, I also added a couple spoonfuls of sweet corn kernels (just steamed a frozen bag). And we dipped them in a sweet creamy sauce: plain greek yogurt sweetened with some brown sugar and cinnamon. That tasted awesome with this unique blend of flavors!! Will make it again for sure! ~BFogie

These were very good!  Everyone, including the kids, loved them.  I followed others' advice and added sauteed onion and cumin to the mashed sweet potato.  I also simplified the assembly-I put the tortilla in the pan and added a thin layer of cheese.  When it melted, I layered on the sweet potato, beans, more cheese, and another tortilla. By then the bottom tortilla was almost golden and ready to be flipped over.  I initially stacked the quesadillas to keep warm, but the ones on the bottom lost their crispiness, so I recommend laying them separately on cookie sheets until serving.

I was skeptical of the ingredients but I prepared it exactly as written with the exception of the tomato tortillas (I used plain flour tortillas instead). They were delicious!! I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing a simple, yet tasty, recipe.

I wasn't so sure my kids would like it because they're iffy when it comes to sweet potatoes. They loved it. It was very good. I didn't have the tomato tortillas but I used flour and corn. It was AWESOME! I'll be making it more often.

This is super simple and super tasty just as written! You could certainly spice up the sweet potato mixture with caramelized onion, sauteed garlic, and any number of spices / seasonings - however I really enjoyed the simplicity of the texture and flavor of the mashed sweet potato with the black beans and some salsa to top them off. I will definitely make these again! Yummy!

Good and super easy.  Microwaved the sweet potatoes which made the prep time really short!  My 2 year old gobbled them up along with the adults!

I love this recipe!   Super healthy for vegetarian and others ; filling and delicious.  Used garlic as well as onion and found it easier to put the ingredients on one quesdilla and top with another instead of folding the tortilla once filled.  It is now a big time hit!!

This has become one of my go-to recipes for a fast healthy meal.  The combination of sweet potatoes and black beans is really tasty! I usually cook several sweet potatoes so I can scoop out the flesh and store in the fridge to make this an even faster meal later in the week.
