this is an excellent pina colada recipe! it tastes just like a virgin pina colada, and it is very easy to make. I used Coco Lopez cream of coconut and my pina colada turned out great. :)

I wouldn't call it a slush, but it was very good.  My husband loved it and added more coconut cream (I used Coco Lopez, too).  Very good will make again!

I thought the recipe was a five star, but my husband rated it a three, so I met in the middle with a rating of four. We added very fine unsweetened coconut flakes, and that made it even better.

This is a wonderful recipe!
It also works as a good base recipe..we've used different fruit, juice and no sugar added ice cream in place of the listed ingrediants.

The recipe was alright.  It didn't taste like the ones at the restaurant.
