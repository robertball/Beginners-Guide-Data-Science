Very good flavor but very rich. I would either have it thinner on a 13x9 pan or use less sugar. I would make it again though. Great coffee flavor over brownies.

I love the flavor! Mine turned out very creamy. I substituted 2% milk for the half-and-half but otherwise I made exactly as directed.

This is a winner! Everyone that tasted it raved about how flavorful is was. I did mix it it for an extra two minutes to get it really smooth and fluffy.
