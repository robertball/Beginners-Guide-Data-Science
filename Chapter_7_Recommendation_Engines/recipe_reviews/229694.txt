This is a great recipe and super easy to make. I did make a few changes though. I too dusted the blueberries in flour to help prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the pan. I also didn't fold the blueberries in but instead poured some of the batter in the pan, then dropped in some blueberries, poured more batter in, and so on. Lastly, to cut down the fat and cholesterol I replaced the oil for applesauce. I used 1/2 of applesauce instead of 1/4 of oil.  It came out perfect. Wonderfully moist and fluffy and way less fat!

I found this recipe good, but it didnt make enough batter for my loaf pan...I recommend using a small one. @ Sarah, give your blueberries a quick rinse and get most of the water off, then put about a rounded teaspoon of flour in a bowl, pour in your blueberries and coat them in the flour. This should keep them from sinking :) I also do not fold in my blueberries, I add 2/3 batter to the pan, then pour blueberries on and then top with remaining batter.

Not really sure why there were any issues with this. Made as written, regular loaf pan, fresh berries, 50 mins. I do sprinkle a little sugar on top of any loaves or muffins I make (before baking). It gives a crispy, sweet crust to the top.

This loaf was out of this world! It was the quickest, easiest breakfast bread I've ever made.. even the cleanup was minimal. I used canned bing cherries instead of blueberries.

everything turned out good, except all my blueberries ending up on the bottom of the loaf :( so the rest of the bread lost out on the flavor... but the bottom is delicious! so is there a trick to keeping the blueberries up off of the bottom? does it make a difference if they are fresh or frozen?

This is a great recipe, only change I made was to substitute a half a stick of butter for the vegetable oil, because butter is delicious and vegetable oil is just there being all bland and neutral tasting.

This is so delicious! Both my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it. Perfect moist, almost cake like consistency. Frozen berries worked great. Definitely recommend it.

I've made this twice now: and it's very good. I used only 1/2 cup sugar, as it's sufficiently sweet that way. It makes a very small loaf, so if you're wanting a nice high bread, it's best to double the recipe.

Using this recipe as is, with only less sugar as mentioned, I found that it cooked perfectly in 50 minutes, as it's a small loaf.
A good note to beginners to check after 50 minutes, otherwise it might be overdone.

So I made this as is and it turned out great.  I did double my batch so it would fit my loaf pan and it worked perfectly.  I also dusted my blueberries with flour so they wouldn't sink.  Worked like a charm.  Next time I may omit a little sugar, like 1/4 cup or even try honey.  Overall a very good loaf and a keeper.  Even my husband who doesn't care for blueberry loaf/muffins loved it.

I followed someones review on here and instead of folding the blue berries in I made a layer of batter and then layer of blueberries and then the rest of the batter. This made the middle of the bread mushy and the blue berries all in the center. Next time I will fold them in like the recipe states. Otherwise good flavor and easy to make.

Very simple and quick to prepare.  I added applesauce (1/2) unsweetened and 1/4 old fashioned oats.  I didn't omit the oil due to using oats and reduce the dryness.  I did add some white sugar to the top to give it the crisp.  I added the blueberries on top as we'll in the mix.  I also used frozen blueberries.

i went strictly by the recipe but also listened to a comment about dusting my frozen blueberries with flour before i added to mix.  it worked perfectly and berries were all through the loaf.  i personally would like a little sweeter.  maybe i needed to add sugar on top,

A nice simple recipe that didn't require a trip to the store for specialty ingredients.  I made mine with Saskatoon berries from the backyard and it was declared yummy by all the members of my family.

I just made this. I added some honey as a substitute for some of the sugar,  added lemon zest and dry ground orange peel. Also I used small blueberries which helped them not fall to bottom. Added some to top as garnish. Oh and I only needed 40 mins. Cook time. Easy recipe!

Very good. I understand where people are coming from when they say this makes a small amount. I have two sets of metal loaf pans for baking and one Pyrex loaf dish that I use for meatloaf. If I used the Pyrex, or even my larger metal pan this would make too little batter. However, it was perfect in my smaller pan. I used frozen blueberries and I sprinkled Demerara sugar on top for a nice crust. Mine was done in a much shorter time frame, about 45 mins. Will definitely make again due to quick prep, minimal amount of dishes to wash, and simple pantry ingredients.

Followed recipe for the most part just substituted oil for 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, and added 1 tsp lemon juice. I did toss the blueberries in a little flour to keep them from sinking. I also sprinkle the top with a little bit of sugar, maybe two teaspoons. My bread was done at about 47 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

Yes, I made it since it seemed so easy.  It turned out beautiful! I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 a cup.  I also used 1cup of oat flour and half a cup of white flour to make up for the 1 1/2 cup of white flour.  Thank you for a nice recipe.

I love this recipe!  I added 1/4 teaspoon of butter extract to give it an extra buttery flavor.  I also only cooked it about 45 minutes and it was really nice and moist.  Will definitely make this again.  Next time I am going to try strawberries or peaches!

I'm just learning to bake, and this is the first thing I've made that I can brag about. Very easy recipe. After the first (successful) try, I made some changes. I added an extra egg, a touch of cinnamon, and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, which is sweet enough. I added at least a cup more berries (it's hard to exercise restraint), including raspberries (I use frozen berries). The result is a loaf that's still got that cake thing going for it, but loaded with fruit. I'm getting requests, lol.

will definitely make it again. followed recipe exactly, and followed recommendation of sprinkling a little sugar on top. moist, delicious and full of fruit. next time will grease and add parchment paper on bottom. despite  greasing loaf pan, juice from fruit can/will make the loaf stick.

Went by the recipe might have added a smidge more sugar, and I tossed my frozen blueberries in flour.  Didn’t want to chance them sinking. This is the 3rd time I’ve made this recipe and it’s always a hit! Next time I’d like to use apple sauce or butter instead of oil. I sprinkled sugar on too after I took it out.  Does need something extra.

The only changes that I made were to add 1/2 cup more milk, and 1t of ground cinnamon. The next time I make it, I think that some Nutmeg, would make a nice addition too.

Nice flavour and easy to make.  Loafs aren't popular here so I made this into 8 large muffins that I cooked for 35 minutes. Should I make this again I will add more vanilla. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent bread.  Followed recipe using frozen berries.....next time I'll use fresh berries because these berries may have been frozen a long time....no flavor.  Bread was light and moist.  Put cinnamon sugar on top before baking 60 minutes.  Will definitely yes this recipe again.  Easy.

I’ve made it a couple of times and it turned out delicious - but the first time it seemed like there were too few blueberries.  Second time I used two cups of fresh blueberries - and both times I used only 1/4 cup sugar and added in natural unsweetened applesauce.   Came out plenty sweet, and more tart - which I love.

No changes needed.. i used frozen blueberries which i assume is why it is so moist and beautifully textured. I have already made it 3 times. It is delicious and everybody loves it! [I always add a couple of tbsps of pulsed seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, buckwheat) for added nutrition and extra protein, as with all my cakes]. This one is a keeper!!

I made this gluten and dairy free. I altered the recipe to use gluten-free Bob's red Mill 1-1 baking flour, unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, I melted the coconut oil to measure to 1/4 cup. Same oven temp, same 60 to 70 minutes, it was so moist and sliced beautifully. My family loved it! We topped it with lemon glaze (powdered sugar and lemon juice)

This recipe makes a delicious moist blueberry bread. I had an accident with the vanilla and probably put in an extra teaspoon but it didn't do any harm. I used frozen blueberries and they came out just fine.

I made this with only 1 cup of blueberries as I didn't have the two cups on hand.  I added I/2 cup of ground pecans (not real fine) and it was very good.  Next time I may try to add some mashed banana instead of the second cup of blueberries.  I will definitely make it again, as it is not real sweet and I like a berry loaf that is not too sweet .
Thanks for a good recipe and easy to make.

This recipe is a keeper! It is an easy made from scratch loaf bread. To reduce calories I swapped out the oil for unsweetened applesauce and to brighten the blueberries a little I added lemon zest. Good base batter for other breads also. I decided to make this in a 9 loaf, mini loaf pan and reduced the baking time to approximately 25 min until golden brown on top. They turned out very moist and a big hit in our house and no one but me knows that there is healthy applesauce in these yummy mini loaves. :)

First time I made it, turned out fantastic. I made it today following the same recipe and not near as good as the first time. It was more like cookie dough this time. Both times there was no way I could "pour" it in the pan. Also this time it did not "rise" so it was 1/2 the size as the first time. Not as moist. Does frozen blueberries have an effect or the fat content in the milk. I'm really confused on what happened. I will of course try again as  it was so good the first time. Any ideas what went wrong this time?

This was very easy to make and it tasted nice.  I followed the recipe to the T.  I didn't find it very sweet, which my husband liked.  Next time I will only use 1 cup of blueberries, 1 1/2 cups was too much.

I followed the recipe exactly and the finished product looked good when I took it out of the oven but my first piece I realized it was dry and not sweet enough. Plus the baking time was way off. Mine was done in less than 30 minutes -one more minute and it would have been too brown. My oven temperature is correct.

My son is a vegan so I used almond milk and left out the eggs. This is a great recipe that is simple and you can modify easily. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top before I baked it. Then once baked and cooled down slightly I sprinkled icing sugar on top. YUMMMY!!  One note to make ... cut back on the amount of blueberries you use if your blueberries are large. ??

Really yummy and quick and easy to make! I used slightly less sugar than what it called for an it tastes sweet enough. Love that I can use frozen blueberries in this. I’m wondering if I could use whole wheat flour or add in some oatmeal to make it healthier...?

I followed the recipe to the letter, and it is amazing. I especially love the texture of the top of the crust-- a bit crisp, sweet, golden brown... It makes me wanna quit my job and become a baker! :)

This is the second time making this bread.  The first time I used just blueberries and made a double batch, which made enough batter for three small loaf pans.  It was delicious.

This time around I also added some strawberries in with the blueberries and cooked it a little longer as the strawberries add a little more moisture to the mix.  I cut and served it warm with cool whip for our desert.  Again,  Delicious!!

Very disappointed! Made no changes to recipe exc to roll the berries very lightly in flour so they wouldn't sink to bottom. They did anyway.  Fairly high rise in over quickly collapsed. Biggest complaint: Despite following recipe exactly ended up with incredily stif batter--so stiff it follopwed the whish around the bowl. More like dough. No way to 'fold' berries in--maybe shoot them from a gun. In the end added maybe 1/2 cup more milk and that made the batter foldable.

Very simple and light. I guess because there's little oil and only 1 egg. I didn't have quite enough blueberries so I added an overripe banana I had on hand. I also did the "flour on the blueberries" trick. That really works. I also didn't have vanilla so I used almond extract and that tasted really good. Oh and this wasn't too sweet either. Even with the banana.

I lightly sprinkled granulated sugar on top added 3/4  cup or so of walnuts chopped coarse to batter and flour to coat my blue berries so they don't sink to the bottom of the batter.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious! I would probably use 2 smaller loaf pans next time as it was rather shallow. Moist and old-fashioned tasting, my husband and I are loving it with tea. Thank you, Meg!

I did make a couple of changes, however, over all easy and DELISH!!! :) 
(1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil and 1/4 cup egg subs.)  AND I also dusted the blueberries in flour to keep them from dropping to the bottom.

I’ve made this several times, using frozen blueberries I picked over this summer. The only changes I’ve made other than using frozen berries, I added a tablespoon of unsweetened coco and 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar ( it was all I had on hand) it always comes out delicious, even without the changes.

The bread is good but what I found out it was very hard to get out of the loaf pans. I used Minnie ones and I think the fresh blueberry were very juicy because the bread was wet under neath making it fall apart even when I cooled them to turn them out. I had a hard time with that but over all was very tasty.

Delicious!  I can't eat white sugar so I had to substitute coconut sugar.   I beat the coconut sugar with the wet ingredients before adding wet ingredients to the other dry ingredients.  I also substituted 1/2 cup organic, unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I agree with other comments... Mix about 1/2 tablespoon of flour in the blueberries before folding in the blueberries.  I had plenty of batter for my large loaf pan.    Fabulous for a breakfast bread or dessert!

I just made this....yum! I followed the recipe besides fresh blueberries cuz all I had was frozen. It was really thick so I was worried I screwed something up. No way could I have added more blueberries. Came out great! Full of blueberries everywhere...no sinking or anything. Took about 55 minutes. Very good! I will for sure be making this again!

Super easy but so tasty and delicious. I put in more blueberries than the recipe suggests but I love blueberries - I used frozen blueberries and my only tip is to act quick with the dough as the frozen blueberries started to freeze the mixture cos I got slightly distracted with the kids and it made it a little harder to place into the tin, also it took about 20 minutes longer to cook however that could just be my not so amazing oven.

Delicious!  My container of fresh blueberries measured exactly 1-1/2 cups.  Was concerned because the dough was so thick, so carefully folded in the floured blueberries.  Put it in a 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 Pyrex loaf pan which turned out to be the perfect size.  The loaf raised up nicely.  I checked it at 50 minutes, then gave it another 8 minutes.  Could have stopped at 56 minutes per my oven, but it still came out wonderful.  Only thing I might possibly do the next time I make this - and there WILL be a next time, is top with a little sugar/cinnamon mixture before baking.  But it is certainly not necessary - just my preference.  Super good recipe as is.

7 15 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/229694/blueberry-loaf/ ... Reallyyy good!  This is lighter than typical quickbread, but more dense than most cakes.  I increased salt to 1/2t, decreased sugar to 1/2c.  'Best blueberry loaf I've made.  8x4 loaf ... I have too many blueberries - always looking for a way to use them.  This recipe ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/223015/alices-easy-blueberry-cake/... is nearly the same as Blueberry Loaf.  Differences are surely unnoticeable in the finished products.  Meaning, Alice's is good, too.  :) ... Next day,  I think the sugar could be reduced further.  Top is getting sticky.  :(

I added less oil and sugar. Instead I added applesauce. The loaf is like I wanted it low fat and sugar.
However it's a little hard and dry.

It's really good. I go through reviews to see what I should change. This is what I did: I kept the recipe the same except I added 2 cups of blueberries (a good amount), I added nutmeg and cinnamon. I baked it for 65 minutes. I also floured the blueberries to make them not sink (I recommend two teaspoons of flour per cup of blueberries)

Great recipe!  I added a 1/2cup extra frozen blueberries.  Also baked 70 minutes is perfect.  Very delicious, good texture.  We made it twice in 2 weeks.

Since I did not have vegetable oil, I substituted with apple sauce.   Worked out perfectly.  And I took the advice of others and used my smaller loaf pan.   This is a keeper.   Mary Ellen

Easy to follow, used fresh blueberries and added a little sugar to the topping.  Texture is cake like and very tender.  I would suggest letting it cool in the pan rather than try to remove it right away.  Wait until it is well cooled to cut otherwise, it will fall apart.

This was super easy, quick and my family loved it. Lots of blueberries and we ate it all warm so I have no idea how it is when it is cold. Next time I would double it.

I have made the blueberry loaf twice already and I remembered I had not rated it. It is perfect! The first time I made it with raspberries and blueberries, and the second time only with blueberries. I will stick to the first option, with more than one kind of berry at a time. I will sure bake this one again.

I was a little disappointed with mine as the blueberry flavour didn't really come through- despite me using more than the quantity stated in the recipe. But it is very quick and easy to make!

Although I was tempted to add some grated lemon peel, I made it exactly as written and it turned out very good and very moist. Floured my blueberries and folded them in. I took it out of the oven a little too early and wished I would have kept it in for 60 min. (bottom was a little wet).  Very easy and a beginner friendly recipe.  Next time I will add some lemon peel for a little more flavor and a crumb topping. Standard loaf pan works just fine.

what is the perfect constancy for the butter, it looked very thick to me, is that the way it should be  ? also it went flat after it cooled I should say I`m just starting to learn how to bake. What am I doing wrong? but it tested very good

Excellent recipe! The few changes I made. Used 2 cups of fresh blueberries (had that much left so figured why not) and replaced vegetable oil with coconut oil (new to all the uses of that oil!). To be honest, I realized later, when I weighed out the coconut oil, an orange was leaning on the scale so didn't use full amount. Very little batter as others mentioned, but I left as is. Did as others have suggested and coated blueberries in a bit of flour, added about 2/3 of the batter, added blueberries, then the remaining batter. This bread was BURSTING full of blueberries!!! Very good, very easy, two thumbs up. Very pleased with end result. Thanks!!

Made this loaf for a Bible study group, they totally loved.  I tossed the blueberry in a little flour to keep them from sinking. I also added a crumb topping. It turned great. Very easy to make.

Made this last night and it is sooo yummy!  It first appeared to not be enough batter for a regular size loaf pan but it rose to fit it once done.  I made a double batch for two loaves....yum!  The only thing I changed is used coconut oil in place of veg oil and it made it that much tastier and healthier.  Definitely recommend this loaf!

This is one of my most favourite recipes. I hate how people here modify its perfect the way it is in my opinion. Ive tried it with other fruits and even chocolate chips and its not the same. I bake mine in 2 mini loaf pans. Made it for parish council and it was a big hit. Thanks Meg for the great recipe

We found this very bland flavor wise.  It's a good base but really needs cinnamon.  Also I found for my oven 60min is a little too long.

I used this recipe, but we didn't have any blue berries so I cooked some apples in a pan with a bit of honey, maple syrup, cinnamon, sugar, and used those instead of blueberries. It came out okay, a little bland, so next time I made it I used 3/4c brown sugar, 3/4c white sugar, then put nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon in the batter, I'm not sure how much I went on feel and taste. Oh it was sooo good! My family ate it all so fast and asked for more! It's a great recipe!
