Excellent made as written!!   Restaraunt quality I agree.  This went together quickly since I had done all my slicing and dicing before I started and was just dropping things in to the pan.  I don't know about anyone else, but I am dreaming of how good shrimp would be in this and I also think I will add 3-4 freshly sliced mushrooms next time. Thanks HungryJohn!!

Delicious! I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease. The rest was exactly the same. This is soooo good. Much better than what I get at the "chain restaurant" where I get a dish very similar to this.

Very good! I did find the recommended porportions of pasta and alfredo sauce to be quite off but it was an easy fix. Serving just the two of us, I halved the pasta and doubled the alfredo. I also used fresh garlic and sauted it with the onion in the butter, then proceeded as stated.

This was really good! I did tweak it a bit for our taste, but overall great! I did as others and cooked the chicken in some of the bacon fat, skipped the butter. Used FF 1/2 and 1/2, added some extra and instead of reducing it down thickened it up with a little flour and milk. Also added a can of peas. Yum!! It's a keeper!

This recipe is fairly involved, at least when I did it.  My kids love eating penne pasta, because they can stick their forks in the hole... so I used penne instead.  And when I went to the store, I forgot to buy parmesan!  Luckily I had some mozarella, which ended up working nicely.  I would definitely make this dish again.

Used leftover chicken instead of adding raw - did not have asiago so I used parmesean instead (proabably closer to a half cup, same with the heavy cream)- cooked bacon in a seperate pan to save time and once complete I added it to the onions, tomato etc. that were already cooking - added Hot pepper seeds because we like everything spicy - came out excellent, great quick work night dinner, 15 minutes tops, I work in an italian restuarant and this is very close to several recipes we make - make the same thing another night but skip the bacon and add fresh basil and you have a whole differnt dinner

We had turkey bacon instead, which I used and it was AMAZING! My husband said it's his new favorite. I've also cooked the chicken in the spices instead of adding it with the veggies, made the chicken more tender and juicy.

Really good. Not very saucy though, which is what I prefer. I think next time I will add a little extra cream, tomato, and alfrdo sauce. I will definitely be making this one again.

Wow, this was good. In fact, DH said this is the  best thing I've ever cooked! I didn't have any alfredo so I just used about 1/2 c heavy cream and added 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese until the sauce was creamy. It was a super easy way to use up some leftover chicken.

Very tasty and will make this again however I did have to alter the recipe and will probably tweak it some in the future.   1.  I did not cook the chicken in advance.  I sauteed the veggies and then threw the raw chicken in to cook.  2.  I ended up having to add ALOT more salt, even after including a tsp or 2 of bacon drippings.  I think I will add more onions and tomatoes and less garlic (and I love garlic).  Also, I will try to add a few more herbs and spices.  While creamy it seemed to lack "something" will update when I decide what.  Also, while this is being picky, the picture is misleading.  Mine came out a creamy white color with only a barest hint of red while the picture seems to indicate the tomatoes will play a bigger role in the sauce.  We didn't even notice the tomatoes at all.  I think you need at least an entire Roma tomato to raise the acid levels and cut through the richness of the cream and Alfredo.

Tried this recipe last night with hubby, and I felt like it fell short of its potential.  I used a whole wheat pasta, which changes the flavor, but this is normal for us so I didn't expect it to make that big of a difference.  I feel like where this recipe fell flat was using the bottled alfredo sauce.  I sampled the dish after step 2 and it was very good, and then after step 3 it was only mediocre.  My gut tells me that if you make a yummier, homemade alfredo sauce it would step up the recipe by at least 1, if not 2 stars.  Will try it again sometime.

Delicious! I had no bacon so I omitted it from the recipe but in retrospect I really should have just ran to the store for some.  I think that the bacon would have been nice for that extra saltiness and texture but even without the bacon the dish was wonderful!

This was Great! Everyone loved this recipe. I doubled most of it since I needed more and it was still very good. The only thing I changed was I used a yellow onion instead of red and milk instead of cream since that is what I had.

This is a great recipe! Like another reviewer, I too sliced my chicken thin and cooked it in the bacon drippings, wiped the pan and continued on with the recipe. I also doubled all the cream/sauce ingredients because it was just too thick for us. We usually don't like any store bought Alfredo sauce but used Barilla brand and this turned out so much better than I expected. I will prepare this often. Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful!  I felt I was eating at Macaroni Grill (Pasta Milano).  My husband enjoyed it also.  I had some mushrooms that  needed to be used so I sauteed them (sliced) in a little butter.  I only used 2 slices of bacon as that is all I had and did it in the microwave (less mess).  I had changed  the serving size to 4 and the recipe called for 1 1/2 lbs. of pasta.  I only used 1 lb and that was almost too much.  I ended up using the entire one lb. jar of alfredo sauce and also added more half and half which I had substituted for the cream.  I will definitely make this again and plan to use sun dried tomatoes as I believe that is what is used at Macaroni Grill.  I had been looking for a recipe similar to theirs and this is so similar that I doubt that I would be able to tell the difference.  Thanks for sharing!  I do have leftovers so will enjoy again. YUM!

This was very good. I thought it tasted very close to what I get in the restaurants. I did not remove all of the bacon grease from the pan just some of it, since I had to cook my chicken. I sliced it into strips and threw it in the pan with the left over bacon grease. Also for some reason my grocery store didn't have red onions so I just used a yellow onion. I did leave out the salt and used garlic instead of garlic salt. I don't really like adding extra salt to our food. I will be making this often. Thanks!

So good!  The only thing I did differently was omit the tomatoes (cause I can't eat them),  I used a little bit more bacon than what was called for and I used a whole jar of Alfredo sauce because I didn't want to waste it.  My daughter absolutely loved this and she's not a big fan of bacon so this was a win!

I really liked this as a starter recipe, but there were some things that I thought weren't right.  There definitely wasn't enough sauce.  I would at least quadruple the sauce.  Also, wait to add the tomatoes, cooked chicken and bacon until step 4.  You don't want to overcook the chicken and the bacon will become soggy if left to soak in the cream/Alfredo mixture.  If the tomato is cooked too long, the skins will peel and the tomato will break down into the sauce.

I added a little more cream and alfredo sauce to make it a little more saucy. Otherwise, I followed perfectly and it came out fantastic!

My whole family liked this (which NEVER happens)! I didn't have asagio cheese and didn't want to use jarred alfredo sauce so I made it exactly as posted through step3 except I used a combo of  parmesan and cheddar instead of asiago and more of the cheeses and a total of 3/4-1 cup of cream to replace the alfredo. Turned out great! Not too heavy but plenty hearty. Will be making this again soon but I think I'll melt the cheeses in the cream separately then add in the prepared bacon/onion mixture to make the sauce. Then stir in the pasta.

I made this for my fiance 5 years ago as part of a romantic dinner. Neither of us care for onions, so that bit the dust, and we both love cheese, so I added extra. I absolutely loved it, and she... well, we've been married 4 years now, and I'm pretty sure it had something to do with that dinner.

Excellent recipe, thank you so much for sharing! I followed the directions of others and sautéed my chicken strips in the bacon grease. This way, there was no need for butter. I also doubled the heavy cream and Asiago cheese. My husband LOVED it. He thought the addition of mushrooms would be great, and possibly even lobster instead of chicken. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for the first time when I had house guests over. I know not a good idea to try something new with guests but everyone raved about it! I tripled the recipe and there was only enough left for two lunches the next day! I used chicken tenders and cooked them in olive oil and garlic. It's a seriously yummy recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made it for the guys at the firehouse and they loved it.  Instead of using thin sliced chicken breasts, I just cut up a regular chicken breast into small strips.  I doubled the recipe and had plenty of for for four people and leftovers.

Must admit I was little skeptical especially since I am not a novice cook. But, this recipe is super easy and turned out really well. I definitely recommend if you're into pasta dishes.

We liked this.  Made it as written but added a little more cream so it wouldn't get dry.  Great leftover too.

this was sooo good!  I fried the chicken in the bacon grease as other did (although I did drain it a bit).  Used two tomatoes, added mushrooms and fresh basil.  Will definitely make this again!

I was looking for something new for my kids and this was GREAT!  They gobbled it up, but I think I will add more diced tomato and maybe some mushrooms and I switched onions to sweet onion instead of the red.

It had very good flavor.  However, I wanted to make 4 servings, so I doubled the pasta.  The meat was tripled, as I added extra chicken and some ham I needed to use.  This required the sauce ingredients to be quadrupled.  It made way too much, but we now have more than enough leftovers for another meal.  

Next time I will use 10-12 oz of pasta (which is the amount I use when making spaghetti) and possibly double the other ingredients.  It's a very good base recipe.

this was really good!! i also did as others and cooked my chicken in the bacon grease. instead of using 1/4 cup of roma tomatoes, i use a whole one. i used parmesan instead of asiago. i also added spices (a little bland without) and 2 carrots (grated) to add color.

Very good recipe, the sauce is very rich so you don't need a lot.  The only thing I changed was cooking my chicken in the bacon drippings.

I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease, omitted the heavy cream since I didn't have any and sauteed some baby portabellas with the onions.  It was magnificent!

This was really good, but I like a little more flavor to a sauce.  I may try adding some Asiago cheese next time.  It is very similar to one of my restaurant favorites!

Oh, this was excellent. I did not change a thing, I used the jar of alfredo sauce and penne pasta. My family loved it, great for garlic lovers. Worth any extra effort.
