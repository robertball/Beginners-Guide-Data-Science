Turned out great! I skipped the salsa over the top. When I ate it, I used some Louisiana hot sauce to spice it up further.

Pretty good. Put more salsa and sour cream on top to give it some more flavor. Overall good easy meal.

These were delicious!  The rice was creamy/cheesy and the flavors mixed well with the broccoli and beef.  The pan I used was slightly too small, but I was fine with that because the edges of the tortillas crisped up nicely.  We'll definitely make this again.
