Lots of people in the South eat pinto beans as a meal, but I had only eaten white beans this way. I chose to follow this recipe as a guideline rather than following it exactly. I decided to make this late in the day, so I did the quick soak method where I brought the beans and water to a boil and let them sit covered for an hour. I then poured off the water and used 2 cans of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. I omitted the ham hock because it makes food greasier than what I prefer. I did have to add more water as the beans cooked. When the beans were just tender, I added chopped onion, ham pieces, the brown sugar, and tomato sauce. I could not find a 6.5 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I used all of the 8 oz. can I bought. I cooked it all for another hour as the recipe states. I ate this for dinner accompanied with cornbread and green onions.

Easy and Tasty!  Soaked the beans overnight.  No ham hock, but had a 8oz package of Salt Pork. Cubed then browned the salt pork in a pan, then added the pork and fat to the pot.  I like my beans peppery, so I added a Tablespoon of black pepper.  Served with some fresh skillet cornbread....YUM!

Mine came out too watery. Not sure why. I cooked mine in a crockpot.  I'm from OK and remember my mother cooking this.  She would use salt pork only.  I put raw onions in it and love the taste and crunch.  My husband put ketchup in his. I like beans and cornbread. My mother would also sometimes pour the beans on top of the cornbread. That was good, too.

This was my first time making pinto beans, and these came out great.  I added ground meat because that is how my mother used to make them, but I followed the recipe for everything else.  I will definitely make these again.

I love into beans and these were very good, I used smoked jowl for the meat and it worked well. For me there was not enough salt in the recipe that was an easy fix.Thanks for the recipe.

Omitted the ham hock and added some chopped onion, garlic, and bay leaves.  Very homey and satisfying. Also used to make nachos!

I used 2 ham hocks, plus I added the skin and fat for flavoring, which I removed from the pot along with the bones, once I cooked it down. I also used the juice from the ham. After I cooked the meat, I soaked, and added the pinto beans, plus white onions, and bell peppers, and also added tomatoe sauce and brown sugar, then cooked it for a few hours, checking and stirring occasionally until it was done.

As a fellow Okie I can relate. Love the side of greens all followed by a piece of hot buttered cornbread in a tall glass of milk for desert. I must be feeling nostalgic.

I didn't add the brown sugar, but to the smoked ham hock I add a pack of bacon (cut)  I use a small can of tomato sauce with roasted garlic, 1 green pepper and 2 onions or 1 big one. Chili powder and cumin, pepper and salt (at the very end otherwise the beans don't get soft) and some of my family members sprinkle some Tony chachere on top of their plate. If I make more beans I'll double all ingredients for a large Slowcooker.

It is quite delicious for what it is: ham and beans.  I really like the addition of the tiny bit of brown sugar and the tomato sauce.  The brown sugar doesn't sweeten it at all (from what I can tell, it still tasted like a hearty bean soup), and the tomato sauce just adds another yummy flavor.  I actually didn't have smoked ham, so I just threw in a pound of pork burger and a tablespoon of salt and everything turned out just right.  Good stuff!

Love this recipe! I use an 8oz can of tomato sauce, three or four ham hocks, and a couple of cloves of garlic. Throw it all in a slow cooker and dinner is done. So easy and inexpensive, and great on a cold winter day.

I had red kidney beans on hand with a smoked ham hock. I followed recipe but used tomato paste with some diced tomatoes for texture. I used double brown sugar for my 3yo and 2 tablespoons worcester sauce. We all loved it and will make it again with pinto beans and no changes just to taste.

I made it but without the ham hock.  I used a link sausage sliced in 1/4 pieces that I added when the beans were almost done.  Really, really good.

Made it just the way it is written except I probably used a little less water and I soaked the beans overnight. This is so simple yet so flavorful and satisfying. I may play with it in the future like add some onion or celery but am more than happy with the leftovers for now!

Used a smoked turkey leg in place of the ham hock.  Also used vegetable broth in place of water., added half an onion, two garlic cloves and a bayleaf.  I thought it was lacking in flavor a bit.  Next time I would add more herbs and spices.

Incredibly good as made per recipe, unless you want to add more salt to taste and maybe a touch of red pepper. Yep, better than Grandma made I'm sure.

I love this recipe. I grew up on pintos, it was a family favorite on a cold winters day. My mother made it without the tomato base. I used a can of tomato paste, added three cloves of crushed garlic and a tablespoon of BADIA  pinto beans seasoning to my pot. I really enjoyed the outcome! I’ll be Adding this recipe to my favorites

Never made with pinto beans always navy beans. Had to add a little more brown sugar so they weren't so bland.

The first time I made these beans I followed the recipe to the T and they were great.  The second time I made these, I switched it up a little.  I used cubed ham that was marinated in liquid smoke for 3 hrs. and I also added a hint of BBQ seasoning.  This was done to just put a little spin on this recipe, which is already a great recipe.  Love It.  Thanks.

I fixed this as the recipe is written, and it was GREAT! This is now my go-to recipe for brown beans. (My husband is a huge fan!)

These beans were great, I substituted lamb bones (neck maybe?) and added some carrots

My family loved this recipe.. I can honestly say I didn't use the ham hock but sautéed garlic and onions in the bottom of my pot with olive oil and use an adobe seasoning and added one tablespoon of brown sugar in the beginning of the cooking process ...

I added pepper because I also like peppery flavor.  I'm wondering if I should have kept the lid on the whole time???  It would have made it less liquidy.  I will try that next time.  I made mine with my son's 4H ham hocks!

My first attempt at homemade beans. I added more brown sugar than the recipe called for, maybe just because Im so use to canned baked beans. I think next time I will skip the ham hock and just use veggies like another reviewer suggested, or maybe bacon ;)

Kosher salt and ham hock? This is a great recipe! I use salt and pepper for seasoning and they turn out great. I have used beef or chicken bouillon.

I have made these several times now. My husband and picky kids love them and ask for them to be made often. I didn't change a thing!

Love this recipe! I've made it several times. I soak the beans overnight and I also use the drippings off the ham (skim off fat.)

First beans I made but can't imagine making anything better. Used a package of smoked ham hock but the extra meat was a good addition. Also accidentally used tomato paste instead of sauce but that just made it so thick we had to eat it with a fork. This is great paired with "grandma's cornbread" from this site.

First off THANKS for the recipe, really enjoyed the beans. I'm a bean and pea lover and will try all types. But, i require modifications in seasoning, reduced sodium. Only change made was not adding salt the ham was enough.
