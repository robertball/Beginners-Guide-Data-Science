This ended up being very good but it needed some help. I cooked two chicken breasts instead of using a rotisserie chicken. I seasoned the chicken with McCormick Southwest Seasoning (a new blend from the gourmet collection). I followed the recipe as indicated but found the dish to be bland. I loved the seasoning that I used in the chicken so I went ahead and added that same seasoning to the pasta dish until it tasted right, probably about 2 teaspoons. I garnished with avocado, tomatoes, chives, red onions and strips of baked corn tortillas.

Good, easy and quick. Used hot diced green chiles in place of regular diced green chiles. Garnished with diced tomatoes.

My family really liked this, it was simple and quick. Didn't change one thing. And didn't have any left at all. I guess this made my family super happy!

This was a good, quick and easy meal that would be great on a weeknight.  I used penne pasta because that is what I had on hand.  Since I didn't have taco flavored cheese I used shredded cheddar and about a tablespoon of taco seasoning.

It was ok - but really bland, and I think it needs a bit of a healthy improvement.  I added in a bag of frozen spinach, and spiced it up with some Hot Shot (a black and red pepper blend).  I think hot sauce, tomatoes, broccoli...all could be added to make this more interesting.

The cheese sauce made the pasta taste sour.

Very easy to make. I ended up using ground turkey instead, because when I went to the store the rotisserie chickens had another hour to cook so I said forget that. I browned the turkey in a skillet and cooked the pasta in a pot according to the directions on the box. I added several spices to the ground turkey: onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, ground red pepper, and red pepper flakes. I have never tried any of the Progresso starters before so not sure if this recipe would be too bland. I drained the pasta and added it to the skillet and followed the rest of the recipe. I think overall it was good, but needs more spice. Maybe some hot sauce would help at the end. I will try again when I have a rotisserie chicken and maybe the flavors from the chicken will make it perfect.

Made this with ground turkey instead of chicken.  Thought the flavor was OK...a bit bland...but easy and quick weeknight meal.

I really have to admit I went into this recipe not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised!  Of course I tweaked it to my tastes.  I didn't have any cooked chicken so I used chicken tenderloins and pan fried them with taco seasoning.  I then added the Progresso Starter and the 2 T of chopped green chilies (didn't want to use a whole can!) and boiled it a bit to thicken the sauce.  I was really afraid of it being more like soup so I only added about 2/3 of the can of Starter.  Then added the cooked mini penne.  Stirred that up and grated some  colby cheese on top, topped with chopped tomatoes.  I am pleased with this recipe and may be making it again.

This dish was ok. For a Southwest dish I felt that it wasn’t spicy enough or didn’t have enough flavor. I added jalapeños to mine for a kick at the end.

DId need some spice. I used a Northwoods Seasoning from my restaurant supply store on a huge chicken breast. Grilled it in a pan with garlic oil. Chopped it up. Used a fancy Italian Campanelle pasta. Added broccoli crowns and a can of Herdez salsa Verde.  (I live in New Mexico and the canned green chiles don't do it.) Next time I think I will add some garlic and chopped onions. Very quick and yummy.
