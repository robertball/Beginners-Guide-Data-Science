Our second batch we substituted salted peanuts for the almonds and they were the hit of our family gathering.  Thanks

Delicious! This is a 'must try' recipe for all of you who have a sweet tooth. I'd like to make a version with white chocolate and see if it tastes like a Zero candy bar (my favorite). 

Thankyou Saundra for the recipe!

These were yummy.  I think they would be a ton better with home made carmel.  I wish the nouget was  a little heavier but over all, they were yummy!

I used pistachios instead of almonds which were great. Still the candy texture just wasn't quite what I was expecting. Flavor was okay though, but probably won't make again. Sorry
