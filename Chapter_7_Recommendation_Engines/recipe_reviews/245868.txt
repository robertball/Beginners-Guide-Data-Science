These turned out well after adding a little more flour to the batter. The first few I made were too thin for me. They tasted fine--I ate them with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. I probably won't try them again--the champagne really didn't add that much more flavor than regular pancakes. I would rather just drink any leftover champagne. However, they were worth trying, and they tasted good.
