I couldn't agree more with the description. These surely satisfied my sweet tooth. But what truly attracted me to the recipe was the fact that it only made 2 individual servings. The chocolate filling is so light and creamy, I loved it! Very quick and easy to assemble as well. Definitely a keeper for me!

I was recommended this recipe and decided to give it a try. By the time I was ready to make it I realized I forgot the cookie that goes on the bottom. So I decided to just put the filling into 2 dishes, let it set, and then top with some lite whipped cream. 1 oz of chocolate chips is equivalent to 3 Tblsp. so I just used that and I also used reduced fat cream cheese. This really does only yield enough for two really small desserts. I don't know how it is with the cookie, but the filling is thick and like a combination of cheesecake mixed with chocolate mouse.
