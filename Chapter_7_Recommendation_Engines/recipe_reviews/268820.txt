I was so intrigued by this recipe, but did not want to make 2 pies to try it out, so I halved it. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I am sorry to say this was a disappointment. The bottom crust did not cook and the pie was very wet. There was a sort of chalky, raw taste to it, I think from the cornstarch. I am not sure I would try to make this one again.
