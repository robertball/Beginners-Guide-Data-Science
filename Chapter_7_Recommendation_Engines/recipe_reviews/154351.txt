I always make my pasta salad this way (minus the red bell pepper). Ususally, I also add black olives and garbanzo beans. Sometimes I'll make the packet of italian dressing and add a little Salad Supreme for something different. Either way, this a really wonderfully tasty and filling pasta salad! :)

Proportions are just right!  We skipped the onions (don't like them raw, IMO they get overwhelming in dishes like this) and used celery instead of the green pepper.  Also good with Ken's Greek dressing instead of Italian with a handful or two of chopped black olives tossed in.  This is going into our regular summer rotation!  Thanks!

What a easy awsome pasta salad! Use pepperciones and poblano pepers instead of green pepper.

I made this for our Father's day bbq, thought this sounded like more of a manly pasta salad with the meats in it =) and it was a huge hit.  My husband, who never eats pasta salad gobbled it up and ate leftovers the next day.  My dad brought a big bowl home with him too.  Will absolutely make again, thank you!

I had to adjust this recipe to suit what I had on hand because I am on a tight budget this week. I used elbow macaroni, mixed half italian/half ranch dressings (I literally squeezed everything out of both bottles to have enough to go over the salad) and only half of one large red onion. I also did not have salami, I left it out. I did throw in two diced roma tomatoes and one diced cucumber for added vegetables. The kids and I thought it was good but my husband REALLY liked it. He ate two bowls and took the rest for lunch today. NOTE: This salad was a little on the salty side.

This was a really simple salad to put together since you are using a premade dressing and very flavorful.  My husband really liked the addition of the pepperoni and salami.  I do think this salad will be a hit or miss depending on the dressing you use.  Be sure to use a good italian dressing.

This tasted great. I didn't have red pepper, so I used all green pepper and added some grape tomatoes for color (and I like tomatoes). I used probably 12 oz of salad dressing for our tastes. I didn't have much red onion left, so I added green onion too. Nice colorful and flavorful salad.

Good recipe as is, but would also be good with variations.
Lettuce instead of pasta.  Cherry tomatoes, olives, etc. could be added.  I will make this again!

Easy to make.  Well received at picnics.  I tend to not put as much dressing in as it calls for.  I like it less dressed.  And, you can try assorted veggies, olives, whatever you like.  Just keep it colorful!
