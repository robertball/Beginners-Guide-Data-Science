Love this soft chewy recipe!!!!  EASY!!!  A quick way to make balls is to oil a cup(measuring cup works well) ans stuff coated popcorn in. A tap to the bottom of the cup onto waxed paper leaves beautiful balls!  Yum!! I've made them a few times and love them but add 2 teaspoons of vanilla to flavour  Remember to butter hands before playing in coated popcorn or it'll stick!.

Very easy to make & yummy! I made them for my child's class. 3 microwaveable bags of popcorn was sufficent for 20 servings. After popping, I placed them in 2 large casserole dishes & set them in a warm oven while I cooked the topping. Then poured it over the popcorn & stirred until well coated. Latex gloves sprayed w/Pam helped while forming the balls! Hope this helps!

Quick & easy! First time making popcorn balls, will definitly make again. I made them for my son's class~they loved them! A couple of tips that worked for me was using the gloves sprayed with Pam, break the popcorn into three or more batches(much easier to work with plus you won't have to work as quickly),forming the popcorn in the muffin tins (quick and gave them a place to set up), for the clean up I boiled water in the saucepan to melt the corn syrup mixture then poured that water into my mixing bowl to help clean up that bowl. I was able to make 36 popcon balls out of this recipe.

I have never eaten nor less made popcorn balls, ever!!  I know, I was pretty clueless, but I wanted to make some for a church function today. My husband informed me that he really liked them so I made an attempt. I must say these were awesome!! I read previous reviews and they were correct on adding the vanilla. I added 1 1/2 tsp., used 3 bags of lightly buttered popcorn in microwave. NOTE: Have popcorn already popped and kernels removed a colander works great. Being organized helped too. Using the insert for crock pot sprayed w/cooking spray and 1 1/2 bags of popcorn, used 1/2 of hot syrup mixing w/sprayed spatula and 1 measuring cup for shaping balls as well as spatula. I just sprayed one hand and rubbed hands to help further shape if needed. The syrup mixture was then reheated and process was repeated. It came out perfect, little bigger than baseball about 22 servings. Used zip sandwich bags to hold and give out.

I was searching for a popcorn ball recipe that did not involve using a thermometer. I needed something quick and easy. Luckily, I found this one. I made two batches. The 2 batches made about 40 baseball sized balls. I'm sure they'll be a hit at the charity sale. It was so simple to make these. I would suggest making your popcorn before starting the sugar mixture. I went through my 3 bags(6 bags all together for the 2 batches)of popped natural microwave popcorn and got all of the unpopped pieces out before tossing it with the sugar mixture. A 13x9 baking pan and a dutch oven held 3 bags and there was room for tossing. I used a cooking sprayed coated spatula to mix and it worked great. We then rolled the balls using our hands. Be sure you spray your hands with cooking spray first. I then let the balls firm up and cool a bit before wrapping them in cling wrap and using a twist tie to close them. The scent and taste of them brought back memories of Halloween and the fall carnivals I went to as a child. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. I highly recommend it.

So easy! I used marshmallow fluff instead of just marshmallows. This is the first time I made popcorn balls and it took me a little while to realize that you have to press REALLY hard on the balls to make them stick together. Thanks Kelli! I'll definitely make them as an autumn treat for guests!

Sweet and chewy.  I liked these very much.  They didn't get hard like most of the others do.  I used microwave buttered popcorn. I used almost 6 bags.  Buttery sweetness..mmmmm!  My kids LOVED them.  I'm gonna make them for our church bake sale and for my son's school party's.  What kid doesn't like to get popcorn balls?  Once again....mmmmmm!

Bingo!  I don't ever need to try another popcorn recipe again.   After reader reviews and a few modifications this recipe turned out absolutely SUPERB.  It's a classic!  I didn't rate it 5 stars because a perfect recipe doesn't need to be tweaked.  Here's what I did: Reduce confectioner's sugar to 1.5 cups Add 1/2 tsp salt Add 1/2 tsp Maple Extract  Sweet & Salty, but not too sweet and there is flavor other than just sugar!

This is the ideal popcorn ball recipe because it is so adaptable.  I've made the recipe as-is, and everyone loves it.  Vanilla for a bit of extra flavor is nice, but what really makes this recipe a keeper is how many ways you can add to it.  For example, my daughter and I made popcorn balls for her Girl Scout troop.  Since it's almost Halloween, we added food coloring to the sugar mixture to turn the popcorn balls orange.  We also stirred roasted peanuts, candy corn, and M&Ms into the popcorn.  By adding a pretzel stick "stem," we had yummy popcorn ball pumpkins!  We've made them for Christmas using holiday M&Ms, too.  The kids love them, and even the grown ups can't resist.  I pop the popcorn in a plain brown bag in the microwave with no oil or salt.  About 1 cup of kernels makes enough for these popcorn balls, a little less if you're adding other candies or snacks to the mix.  Using rubber gloves sprayed with Pam makes shaping the balls simple, and they set up on wax paper at room temperature pretty quickly.  Individually wrapped and tied with ribbon, they are great for gifts or bake sales.  Have fun!

We made these for my daughter's 1st grade class.  She helped wrap them in colored plastic wrap.  The next day, they were fresh and soft - the kids loved them!

OMG!!!!! these are the best popcorn balls ever!! I do have several suggestions that I took from other reviews that made my popcorn balls PERFECT! so this is what I did I used three bags butter microwave popcorn..that I pre popped and picked all of the seeds out of than I followed  the directions exactly as is says except add 2tsp. Vanilla extract...the only other suggestion I used was to do the mixing in two separate batches which really helps..Also when your ready to form your balls use a 1 cup measuring cup and pack the mixture into the cup firmly (believe me you will b e glad you did this)other than that I had wonderful popcorn balls! this recipe made 12 one cup balls!

Simply delicious!  I read other reviewers comments before trying this recipe.  Thank you all for your suggestions, it made the popcorn ball experience for my 8 year old daughter and I flawless!!  We used 3/4 cup of unpopped popcorn, used a hot air popper, which made just a little under the amount we needed for 20 balls.  The one tip I would make in addition to all the others is to place plastic wrap over a metal 1 cup measuring cup, place coated popcorn in it.  Gather up plastic wrap, shape it into a ball and viola you have a popcorn ball with out much mess on your hands!!  ENJOY!  We are!!

These are good but I felt it needed about 7 quarts of popcorn, there was a ton of the coating.  I got 9 2.5 to 3 oz. balls (about 3 inches).  I added vanilla (right at the very end) and even some salt. **UPDATE** The second time I did use 7 qts. of popcorn and liked that better.  I added 1/4 t salt and 3/4 t vanilla (vanilla at the end).  I forgot the water the second time, not sure what it did but it's fine without.  I got 14 baseball size balls.  With the changes I've made this is a 6 star recipe.  I like these so much I can't seem to bring myself to give them away, I want to eat them all.

These were easy and delicious! I read through all 181 reviews before I began. I followed the advice to use buttered popcorn, I did add popcorn salt. What I cut down was to use just 2 cups of powdered sugar. I left the rest the same, and did add 1 tspn vanilla after the syrup mixture was ready to come off the burner. I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn, and divided it up 1.5 bags for 1/2 the syrup mix to make it all easy to handle. For those who had a hard time making it stay in a ball, I wonder if you mixed it long enough and had let it cool down some, so that it was easier to set. ? Anyway, easy, easy for me. I did have a hard time getting the M&M's to stay put, so instead I made the popcorn balls and put different cookie-decorating type sugars in individual bags, and shook the decorations onto the ball, that worked great! I set them all out on wax paper, and wrapped in colored saran wrap. Very easy, and really delicious recipe. Not to sweet at all - I stayed away from the kettle corn, just because there was already so much sweet going in.

These popcorn balls were fantastic!  I've never made them before but needed some for a bake sale & am SO glad I found this recipe.  My kids & husband loved them so much that I did not leave the house with as many as I made for the bake sale!  The only change I made was to use kettle corn instead of regular popcorn.  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I've been tinting the glaze with food coloring - makes it SO much easier to see if you've evenly coated all of the popcorn.

For me, this recipe is very good.  However, you have to wait till the mixture comes to a soft ball stage. -Very soft if you want them to not be too hard! Soft ball stage & then mix with popcorn.  Many times if the recipe says to just bring to a boil & then mix, it won't form balls & you get that big gooey mess I hear about.  Hope this helps.

Oh yum! This recipe is PERFECT as is, but considering how stable and beautiful the topping is, if you prefer a gooier popcorn ball, it would definitely work to decrease the popcorn to 3 or 4 quarts. To those who would rather your popcorn ball not be smothered with butter or oil, dipping your hands in cold water and shaking them off before forming works wonderfully (you can usually form 2-3 balls before needing to re-dip).

I have been making these for a few years now so I finally decided to add my two cents here in the reviews. I have never tried another recipe because they all sound so difficult with the candy thermometers and the crazy temperature requirements and whatnot. I use this recipe and simply reduce the amount of sugar because the suggested measurement makes them too sweet for my taste. I add about 1 3/4 cups of sugar. Then I add 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 2 teaspoons of sea salt and 2 teaspoons of vinegar because I like the sweet and sour combo. I made them to the recipe specifications and everyone thought they were too gooey and too sweet but my modified versions are a hit every time.    Oh, and I use bags of pre-popped corn from Trader Joe's.

This was my first time making popcorn balls.  I made them to add into my Christmas gifts for my family.  I popped four bags of light butter popcorn (four because there are always a lot of left over kernels in the bag), and followed reviewers recommendations by adding in 2 tsp of vanilla to the sugar mixture.  It boils fast so definitely have your popcorn ready and the kernels all sifted out.  The best thing I took away from all the other reviews was to spray Pam on your hands before forming the balls.  I sprayed my left hand front and back and had to have my husband do my right.  I'm glad I did the backs - if I felt I was running low and the mixture was starting to stick I could get some more Pam from the back of my hand.  I'll have to make another batch tomorrow as it only made 18 what I would consider to be small popcorn balls.  I wanted them small - about 50% bigger than a golf ball, so I thought it would yield more, but it was less!  It was easy though so all I have to worry about is cleaning my cookware to reuse.  Washing with near scalding water immediately after took the stickiness right off - and then you can worry about them later!  All in all - super easy and delicious!

I made these tonight for my daughter's 4th grade Halloween party.  Take it from someone who has suffered through making traditional popcorn balls several times--this was a fun, quick, easy recipe.  It reminds me of Rice Krispie squares.  You'll have lots of time to make the balls, so don't panic--but DO squeeze them hard when you make them.  I'll try these again with some changes...these were too sweet and gooey for my tastes, I'd cut the powdered sugar by about half and cut the marshmallow back about 1/3. The sweet and marshmallow flavors overpowered the popcorn, it should be more balanced. I used 'Homestyle' microwave popcorn which gave it more of an 'old-time' taste, I think--but next time I'll salt the dry popcorn a wee bit before mixing it with the cooked syrup.  Popcorn balls NEED that salty/sweet quality.  Sorting out the 'old maids' (unpopped kernels) is a MUST, as is keeping the popped corn warm in the oven.  Buttering the bowl before mixing the popcorn & syrup keeps things from sticking.  I got 35 baseball-size balls out of this recipe.  An easy way to package the cooled & ready popcorn balls is to turn a ziploc baggie inside out, insert your hand into it, grasp a popcorn ball and then pull your hand and the ball back out, turning the baggie RIGHT side out again as you do--viola--no mess on the outside of the bag!

Excellent and too easy to make. I had these done in 15 minutes. I bought a huge bag of popped popcorn. 4 cups equal 1 quart. I filled up my 5 qt crock pot that I had greased. The mixture came to a boil in no time. I did add a bit of vanilla. I am not normally a popcorn ball eater but these were great. I let them cool for a couple of minutes and then formed them with my greased hands. Pat them lightly. Do not crush the popcorn. I passed them to my 6 yr old who had sandwich bags open and ready for me. They held together well. No need to grease the bags. Will make again.

I made these last year, and will make them again this year. They are YUMMY! Tip: These are not as good the next day. Day one they are a gooey ball of goodness, but they get hard on day two,so if you want to serve these at a party, I'd make them that morning.

These were great! Nice and chewy but not too gooey! We used 3 bags of microwavable popcorn and it was perfect. This will be my go to recipe for popcorn balls!

These are tasty and easy to make. You have to be VERY CAREFUL when you mix the marshmallow into the popcorn because I decided to dive right in with my hands and gave myself 2 blisters on my pinky finger. Instead, stir it together with a big wooden spoon and then let it sit for 5 minutes before you form into balls. You will think the popcorn will start setting, but don't worry, it won't...you'll still be able to make balls with it. Also, clean your marshmallow stove pan with hot water right away or you will have a hard clean up job later.

Made these for my family for New Year's Eve. Very easy and oh so good. Nice and chewy soft and unlike other recipes, won't break your teeth biting into them. 5 quarts of popcorn came out to 20 cups.

Boy these are good!  I bought popcorn just to make this recipe.  On accident I bought kettle corn, but no matter, I just decreased the sugar by a tad since it's slightly sweet on its own. What I did do with the mixture is keep it on low to medium low and wait til the marshmallows melted all the way through, then bumped it up to medium to start a boil.  The mixture was so creamy and delicious on its own (I may have snuck a taste from the tiny bits leftover ;D) and it held together so nicely.  I had a little assembly line of plastic wrap already set up and it was a breeze!  I had my husband taste, to which he said, "omg this is awful!" then gave me a wink and ate like half of it in one bite, lol.  It was so tasty, easy and super fun to make that I can say this will be made again!

These are awesome! I put a chocolate kiss in the middle of each ball, then put them in a small bag and tied with ribbon.  I gave one to each kid at the party and told them there was a surprise inside.  Of course I had to eat one and I must say it was the best popcorn ball I've had since I was a kid :)  I'll change the colors and hidden candy inside many times over for a variety of holidays to come.

In terms of ease I say a 4 and flavor i would say 3.5
I was able to make 40 in about 45 mins in two seperate batches.  I used other suggestions and added vanilla and popped 3/4 air popped pocorn all together.  This way they weren't too sweet or gummy.  Also added food coloring to make orange.  Made these in the morning before work to pass out to the daycare costume parade and will probably use again for son's Harvest Party.  TFS

I’ve made these for Cub Scouts and a second time for a Halloween party.  These are quite messy to make, being organized truly helps. .  I started by making 3 regular bags microwave popcorn per batch sorting out the hulls as I went, then making the syrup. I found double boiling the syrup easier than microwaving.  I double boiled the syrup in a medium stainless bowl and added small amounts of syrup to the popcorn working the syrup in.   When the syrup began to set up, it’s easily reheated. I mixed the popcorn and syrup in a large stainless bowl, when this began to set up, it could be put atop the boiling pot and reheat the entire concoction.  As a result my balls were evenly coated and turned out beautifully consistent.  I used my wrist to spray my hands with an aerosol vegetable oil spay.  I did find the recipe only made about 12 smaller than tennis balls.  Kids love them, and they are a huge hit.  Kelli, thanks for sharing.

These popcorn balls ROCK!  Made them today for my son's 4th grade class. I got 21 baseball size balls using 3 regular size bags of butter flavor microwave popcorn (that's what I had onhand) and added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and only 1 tsp. of water. I also used red & yellow food coloring to make them orange.  Keep the popcorn warm after you pop it for easy mixing. I left the bags sealed and put the in the oven (at 275 degrees) until I had them all popped and the marshmellow goodness was melted & ready to go. Put the bags one at a time in a colander to get all of the unpopped kernals out! (they will go to the bottom, just scoop the popcorn out of the colander carefully!) I mixed it all at one time in a large stockpot and wore latex gloves sprayed with Pam to shape the balls, then just put them on a baking sheet to cool before putting them in treat bags. A huge hit!  I will be making tons of these for Christmas treats for all and will make them look more festive by adding red & green m&m's, gumdrops, whatever.  Super easy and so yummy. Truly this is "pocorn balls 101" so don't be afraid to give them a try!  Happy Halloween!  :-)

This is the most fantastic recipe EVER!!!!I used microwave kettle corn. I adjusted the portion size down to 5 and instead of the 1/4 c of marshmallows, I changed it to 1/2. Then made 8 batches of greatness in less then 2 hrs!! It perfectly coated every where!!!!!!! Im no Suzie Homemaker for sure (I prefer to not cook anything at all) and this is the best and most tastey ever! If I could figgure out how to upload a pic you would see!! It took no time at all, and clean up wasnt bad. I did read other reviews about the powdered sugar being overwhelming, but I really cant tell at all! This recipe certainly makes this gal who burns everything look like a fantastic cook!!! Thank you very much!!!

Tasted great, but mine were flat globs of goo.  I used the butter on my hands to make them not stick to my hands, and even when I got them into semi ball shape, once I put them in the surran wrap and tied them up, the next day the bottom of the individually wrapped popcorn balls had a gooey mess in them, as the filler pooled at the bottom.  Very tasty, but do not stick together at all.  May try again sometime when I have some assistance to help me with the mess.

My MIL used to make popcorn balls in the sink (once they got indoor pumbing on her farm.)  This solves the "I don't have a bowl big enough" problem.  DH says that clean up is easy--after you have put the leftovers in a ziplock, then fill the sink with hot water and put all the pots and utensils in it.  When it is cool enough to put your hands in, the sugar has dissolved.

Ooey, gooey, sticky, tacky, messy job. kids loved them. I found waiting for the mixture to cool made them easier to form into balls. I also made them golf ball size, considering the sweetness I thought that would be big enough.

I love popcorn balls, especially gooey, chewy ones but I've never attempted to make them myself until I found this recipe.  It was very easy and for my first attempt I am very pleased with the result.  I ended up with 18 small-medium sized balls that are are definitely gooey, chewy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again!!

I thought these were ok, not much flavor even with vanilla and salt added.  I should go through my Mom's old Betty Crocker cookbook.  These pale in comparison to the ones my Mom used to make.

I took some great advice from reviews. I used three bags of popcorn and did in three batches. I used a one cup measuring cup sprayed with Pam to make the balls and then tapped them out on wax paper. Then when they cooled I wrapped in plastic wrap. Very easy and very yummy!

I had never made popcorn balls before and figured it would be a fun activity for my sons' birthday party. All the kids loved it. I used parchment paper to grab a good chunk out of the pot and had candies in bowls across the table for the kids to add and their parents helped them roll it into a ball.  Everyone had a great time making them and that was their treat to take home.

These were great! I made a different recipe the day before I made these and they stuck to your teeth so bad you couldn't even eat them! These don't do that. They taste great too! Also placing plastic baggies on your hands when shaping into balls is a big help..otherwise..ouch!!

I used  3 bags pop secret homestyle popcorn. Removed all old maids and put each bag in a separate bowl. I changed the powdered sugar to 1 3/4 cups and added 2 tsp. of vanilla for flavor. I separated the syrup mixture into 3 pans after it was done and kept one white and added green food coloring to the 2nd pan and red food coloring to the third pan. You have to move quick so it doesn't cool. That way I had red, green and white popcorn balls for Christmas! They turned out really good and so yummy!

I made half a recipe using one bag of Orville Redenbacher microwave popcorn. It was very easy to make and came out great. I sprayed my hands with Pam before forming the balls. Be sure to pick out all the unpopped kernels before you add the syrup mixture. Good, fun recipe!

Wow, these are fantastic popcorn balls!  I used my largest mixing bowl to put the popcorn in to mix with the syrup mixture and it was plenty big enough so I didn't need to mix this in two batches.  I think that as the mixture cooled it was much easier to get the popcorn to stick together as I made all the balls and then went back again to squeeze each one tighter together and as they were cooling that worked much better than when the mixture was so hot.  Be sure to oil your hands and I kept my Pam spray right there and sprayed a couple of times while pressing the balls.  Will defininatly make these again!

These are so yummy! Fun, and easy to make...but messy! I packed them loosely and placed them in a muffin pan to dry. Using this method, I made about 32 popcorn balls. Would make again!

These were delicious.  Thanks, also, for the hint of using rubber gloves. They made it a lot easier to form them into balls.

This is a great recipe and comes out perfect.  I didn't have light corn syrup so I substituted flavored syrup (usually used to flavor coffee and itallian soda).  It is a little runnier than light corn syrup so I eliminated the water.  The flavored syrup added a hint of flavor (I used vanilla honey syrup)  It worked great.

Awesome and extremely easy!! My kids were amazed at how fast they were ready. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla to it. My husband ate more of them than the children did!!

WAY TOO SWEET. The sugar needs to be cut way down in this recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that it should be a combo of salty and sweet and not just sweet. The marshmallows with the sugar and then corn syrup=sugar overload.! They stuck together great, but the flavor was over the top sweet. I used bagged kettle corn, which has a tad of salt but since the sugar was so overpowering, you couldn't even taste it. I will try again, using less sugar. P.S. for an easy and safe way to handle the popcorn mixture I lightly sprayed 2 sandwich baggies w/PAM, put my hands inside of them like gloves and the popcorn mixture was easy to handle and mold and no chance of burning your fingers.

X-lent!  I've been married for 18 years, and this is the first popcorn ball recipe I have found that lived up to it's hype.  It's wonderful, simple and simply delicious.  I got exactly 12 huge perfectly round treats; and to top it off found another use for my Tupperware onion saver, just grease the inside and use pressure to mold the popcorn rounded!

Great Recipe! I used a good nonstick pot to melt all of the ingredients together, used 4 bags of microwaved popcorn, substituted the marshmallows with fluff.  I also used the ceramic insert of my 12 quart crock pot to mix the popcorn together.  I used pam on my hands and was done in no time.  Thanks! This one is a keeper

I have to agree, they're the best ever!  I was craving my grandmother's Halloween popcorn balls (an old family tradition), and found this recipe.... I hate to admit it, but these are better than Grandma's!  They're super-easy, delicious (I added vanilla extract for flavoring), and fun to make.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Just made these for my son's pre-school Halloween party.  WoW, very yummy!  I did add some food coloring to it while boiling to make it orange, and a little bit of vanilla.  The recommendation to use latex gloves was helpful - the trick is to keep spraying on the Pam while forming the balls.  I used almost three bags of microwave popcorn and it made 16 balls.  Very messy, but well worth the effort.  I have not had such chewy and tasty popcorn balls in years, and have missed them.  Thank you so much Kelli!

Love this recipe. I made them and I added nuts (Planters deluxe lightly salted mixed nuts) and plain M & M's ( I added these right before I started to form into balls cause they will melt). They turned out really good, I will be making these again and again.

Just did a batch of these.  Fantastic!  A couple things... 1 cup plain white sugar works if you are out of powdered.  More than 1 cup is too sweet in my opinion.  Our local Aldi is getting rid of halloween stuff, so I grabbed a few 10oz bags of Pumpkin Spice Marshmallows for .15 ea.  10 drops of red food coloring makes a deep candy red color that works great for the holidays.  I will also do green.  I also added a few dashes salt and a little bit of vanilla extract.  I also picked up Almond and Peppermint, so I'm sure those will work good also.  If you go too much on the Corn Syrup, the balls will be too gloppy at the bottom.  Too little, and it won't bind when you ball them.  I also found five minutes for cooling was not enough, as they started to fall apart once balled.  8 to 10 minutes leaves plenty of time for them to still warm enough for balling, and they form much nicer.  I found that I could tear off a small sheet of cellophane, and drape it over the top of the ball, scoop it up, and wrap it all at once.  I didn't see any point in using a cup, or trying to place sheets down first.  Wetting hands in small bowl of warm water for each ball, let you pack it like a snowball firmly, each time.  It didn't seem to dilute or wear off any of the coating.  I may try the oil or shortening method just to be sure.  This recipe is quick and easy.

Fantastic. These really are the best ever. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, but they would have been great without it, because it was the chewy and crunchy texture that made these the best popcorn balls I've ever had.

these taste great and were so easy to make, I made enough to give to all of my students (3 batches around 60) and it took me less than an hour. One hint is to make one batch at a time so you have enough time to form them.

Very good, however I used real butter and after removing the pot from the stove, I also added 2 teaspoons of Vanilla. Make sure you take all of the unpopped kernels out first! Try this savory add-in: 1/2 cup crisp crumbled bacon. (just stir into the corn syrup mix before pouring onto the popcorn)

Great and easy! My corn syrup was old and so were the marshmallows (not hard). So I made 1/2 a recipe. Following other tips this is what I did for 1/2 recipe: added vanilla (instead of water), salt and used 1 cup powdered sugar. Simmered mixture 2 minutes after it came to a boil. Spooned it into a 12 cup sprayed muffin tin. Sprayed my hands once and formed into balls (next time I will make 10). No problems! Tastes great too!

These were absolutely wonderful!  I had my husband pop the popcorn on the stove and he added some salt without thinking.  I think the salty/sweet combo was great.  We all loved them at our house.  Thank you for the recipe!

If you are looking for your mom's popcorn ball recipe from when you were a kid, this is not it. However this is a great recipe. I have noticed that many people who give this recipe a low rating are complaining that they are not setting up. You have to let the candy mixture cool quite a bit. I used four bags of home style popcorn and it was the perfect ratio of popcorn and candy mixture. I made this in two batches, with two bags of popcorn and about 1 cup of mixture per batch. If after you mix the popcorn and candy mixture you find it too hot for a child to handle safely then you need to let it cool because it will not set. My four children, ages 10-3 were able to easily form these into balls. I also added vanilla instead of the water. Will definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe in its simplicity.The only thing I would note is it is worth it to try to pick out the unpopped kernals before you make and add the syrup. It is not any fun to chop down on one of those!

This was my 1st attempt at making popcorn balls.  Made them with my kids for my daughter's Halloween party.  Thought it would be fun to stir in some Halloween candy to make them more festive, but the M&M's melted and turned the whole batch kindof 'muddy'-looking.  To save the day... my daughter came up with a gross sounding name 'Black Cat Hairballs', we put them in plastic bags, made up some cute tags and tied the tags on with yarn.  They ended up looking pretty cute and she was proud to hand them out to her classmates.  One of the teachers even asked for the recipe.  They were surprisingly easy to make and turned out soft & chewy.  Would make again.  Thanks for the submission!

I loved this recipe and thought it was very easy. I did make a couple of changes - I added 2t of vanilla and cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups. I mixed the popcorn and the sugar mixture in a dutch oven and let it sit covered for about 10 minutes before I tried shaping the mixture into balls. It didn't burn my hands and it still stuck together nicely. I did go back after shaping the balls and compressed each one a little more so they wouldn't fall apart. All in all, a very easy and tasty recipe!

Pretty good, but not my favorite.  I wanted to try this recipe since it's a little different than others I've tried, but I didn't like how the flavor of the confectioners' sugar came through.  Thanks anyway, it was worth a try!

This did not work out well for me at all.  Forming them in to balls was almost impossible and the end product was not edible.  Not sure where I went wrong...and I really did want this to work.  Sorry.

These are great popcorn balls! Gooey, delicious and not difficult to make. My only concern is I did not know how long to wait to make the balls and ended up burning my hands a couple of times. I did not want them to cool off too much and miss having the opportunity to put them together. I really like how simple this recipe is and reviewed it on my blog where you can see pictures of me making them.

Mmmm... Soooo good!  I finished making them about 20 minutes ago and I've already eaten 4!!  My kids really enjoyed watching me make them.. and eating them too!  I added some vanilla, seperated my popcorn into 3 batches, reheating my sugar mixture each time and I formed the balls in a muffin tin.  They were so easy!  I highly recommend!

I will be making this recipe. Sounds great but I wont add so much sugar/corn syrup.  I made popcorn balls a few yrs ago for a party. After forming the balls and letting them come to room temp., I wrapped them in different color saran wrap(blue and red/pink) and tied them with a ribbon. They looked and tasted so delicious. The kids and adults loved them!

made these for my son's 4th grade "Harvest" party on Halloween and threw everything into a crock pot to melt, popped the popcorn, mixed all together and had the kids' put on latex gloves sprayed them with PAM and they made balls.  They were fantastic!  Even us parents liked them!  Not too sweet, just right.  no sticking either with the glove and spray trick!

EXCELLANT RECIPE!!!  I have NEVER made popcorn balls in my life, and my husband said that he would like some, so I decided to try it.  I was very nervous and when I found this recipe it seemed pretty easy, and boy is it ever!!!  I two batches of 10 the first batch I added M&M's... REALLY GOOD!!!  The second batch I left plain... they are both really good!!!  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe... PERFECT 10!!!

I've never made them before, but this recipe was very easy. 3 bags microwave buttered popcorn. I did add vanilla for flavor and I used colored mini marshmallows for a little color. I used a muffin tin sprayed with pam to shape them, a 12 muffin tin made 36 balls. I shook them out over waxed paper, it was very fast and made it easy for my daughter to help.

Quick,easy and delicious!  Very gooey and soft, held together perfectly.  Used ziplock bags over my hands when making the balls - worked perfectly!  Three bags of popcorn worked well.

Good stuff.  I made a half batch and still got 15 baseball sized protions.  That was plenty for us.  I can't imagine trying to do a full batch.  Would need a really big pot to stir it all in.  Next time I will wear some sort of gloves so that I don't burn myself trying to put them together.  These really weren't any more difficult than making Rice Crispy Treats.

I made these as a present for someone. He raved to everyone how fantastic they were. Of the others I gave them to, no one had a sour note to add. They went over so well, I think I had 5 or 6 ask for the recipe! Fun, easy, and extrememly good!

these are really easy to make and taste great! there is no waiting for the syrup to harden like other popcorn balls and they are sweeter and not as dry as others.

This recipe reminds me of the popcorn balls my grandmother used to make.  They were much easier than I expected and everyone thoroughly enjoyed them.  The only drawback is that they get kind of messy!

I liked this recipe. I changed it by adding Maple flavoring instead of water. I cooked my popcorn on the stove top and added salt to cut the sugar in the recipe. So it had sweet and salty flavoring with a maple taste. Perfect.

This was perfect and not messy at all. I used gloves as well as Veg Shortening. I only used 2 cups of the conf. sugar and I promise you it was not too sweet. I will probably make this at least once a month if not more.

First time ever making popcorn balls.  It was sooooo easy and they were sooooooo so delicious, the best I've ever tasted.  They were buttery and sweet and just a ball of total scrumptiousness.  I used buttered Pop Secret microwave popping corn.  Soft and chewy, not dry!  So yummy!

These are not real popcorn balls at all! They are like round rice krispie treats but made with popcorn, and it's not good :( The recipe is easy, but they are pretty gross. I am very disappointed.

This is a great recipe! I made these to surprise my daughter after some really good projects at school. Make sure you get out all the unpopped kernels before getting started or your teeth will get a surprise. I topped mine with chocolate (I just got the dipping chocolate you melt in the microwave and drizzled it over).  i also used kettle corn so it had that sweet/salty thing going for it. Taaaaasty!

These were soggy.  The flavor (with a teaspoon of vanilla) was awesome but if you're looking for a crunchy snack, this is not the recipe.

These are basically rice krispy treats with popcorn instead of rice krispies.  If you like that, it's a fine recipe. I'll be looking around for another.

The mixture tasted good but I was disappointed in how soggy it made the popcorn. Guess I just prefer a crisper popcorn ball. Probably will not make again.

Sticky and hard to put together. Don't hold together well after putting together either.  Seemed a bit too sweet. Prefer the simple recipe I've used for years that just uses butter and marshmallows just like I've always made Rice Krispy treats.

I added the vanilla, as another reviewer suggested, I think it added a lot to the flavor.  Has anyone ever tried adding salted peanuts to these?  Seems like it would add a little salt to the sweet..kind of like Fiddle Faddle.

Delicious and easy to make we used marshmallow cream and hot air popped popcorn. I enjoyed doing this with my 12 year old.  This recipe is soft and yet crispy the perfect popcorn ball.

I received a lot of compliments on these but they were hard to make because of the volume of popcorn.  I did not have container large enough hold and stir the popcorn.

I have been making pop corn balls my whole life and these were way too gooey and way too sweet. I ahve never used powdered (confectioners) sugar in making pop corn balls, nor have I used marshmallows so I wanted to give it a try. I'm going to place them in the oven and bake them so they are crackly and not so gooey. I couldn't taste anything but sugar and air popped corn - they really need salt and vanilla. This was disappointing to me but I can see how others love the ease of not having to use a candy thermometer. I'll stick to my old trusty recipe from now on!

My Husband, (The Baby), loved these popcorn balls. My Grandkids went crazy for them.  The biggest surprize for me, was when my Father-in-law ate four in a row. Since everyone was so happy, I didn't change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe That's so quick & easy to prepare, with such a happy ending.

I had never tasted popcorn balls before but the pictures everyone posted looked so appetizing! I thought it was at least worth trying, so I made it. I ended up with balls of popcorn that were chewy, soft, and a bit too sweet. Mostly though, we didn't like the way it stuck in our teeth.  So, I made candied popcorn with this recipe. I preheated my oven to 250 degrees and broke up the popcorn balls. I baked for 45 minutes, taking it out of the oven every 15 minutes to toss it and break it apart. I let it cool for a few minutes before I tasted it. It was DELICIOUS! I liked how the sugar hardened around the popcorn, making it crunchy like I thought popcorn should be.   I plan on making it again in this way, but I think it needs salt. I air popped my own popcorn, so there were no other flavors besides airy popcorn. The contrast of sweet and salty would be perfect. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made these for my niece's 5th birthday party. Make sure you don't put too much sauce over the popcorn or it'll be too sweet. This is messy, but if you have everything set up before you start and use plenty of Pam spray, it's easier.

I made this with my kids.  It was really easy to make and they loved them, especially knowing the marshmallow was in it.  One quick note:  measuring out 5 quarts of popcorn is kind of difficult.  Definitely use three regular size bags of popcorn or you'll have too much sauce keeping them together...and instead of being lightly sweet, it's over powering and gets a cheesy taste.

I have never made popcorn balls. I attempted to once but it was a disater!!! this recipe was AWESOME! I read some reviews before making them and it helped. I added 2tsp.of vanilla right before i put the sugar mixture on the popcorn. I also added some cinnamon it added a little spice. salting the popcorn when its warm helps alot also. 3 bags of buttered popcorn was perfect. made about 20 balls. I made these for bunco, my boyfriend kept coming and eating them!! luckily it made more than I neede "). I highly recommend this recipe. its fast easy and super delicious!!!!

This one was too sweet for me, and hard for me to make the popcorn balls stick together quickly *even following everyone's kind advice*. Only try it if you have a reeeaallly sweet sweet tooth.

I made this recipe with my son and niece, it was easy and delicious! The only thing I noticed is..if you add food coloring, you may need to add more than normal to get the correct coloring. We didn't use enough red and we got pink instead. But other than that, easy and yummy!

These are great! I'll use mini marshmallows next time because it took too long for bigger marshmallows to melt, and I think my syrup cooked a little longer than I wanted. Didn't matter! We all loved them. Oh yes, make sure to add vanilla like others have recommended too!

It was very fun to make. It was nice and chewy. I decided to go with Kettle Popcorn.  I took them for a bake sale. And it went well. But ...my reason for only three stars. I thought it tasted too sweet. Any ideas on how to de-sweeten this treat??

Easy, fun & yummy!  They're hot so heed advice of using gloves.  I added food coloring to make them orange.  Microwave popcorn works great-- I but 1.5 bags in a huge mixing bowl and then poured in half the mixture and made some balls.  Then I used the other 1.5 bags & the remaining mixture-- this made it easier to toss & get all the kernels.  They were a huge hit at our Halloween party.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time making popcorn balls and I'm ready to make my 3rd batch of these! I used 3 bags of kettle corn and added 1 tsp of vanilla. SO easy and SO good!!  I bought more popcorn tonight so I can take more to my son's school party.

I must have done something wrong - these were very mushy and goopy and never set properly. I ended up throwing them away. I wish they had worked for me, but I'm not sure I'll go through the bother to try again.

I made these for a Halloween party.  They do have the tendency to come across like a rice krispie bar because of the marshmallow, but I do like that they are not like rocks a few days afterwards.  I'll make these again.

These were great and easy!  I took them to my boys' preschool Christmas party, and the kids (and the teachers) just loved them.  I didn't use quite all of the sauce; I poured it over the popcorn a little at a time until I thought it was enough.  My cheat tip is to use cooking spray on your hands to form the balls--easier to put on than something solid like shortening or butter.

Wow do you know how much 5 qts are? That was way to much popcorn! Next time I will only pop 3 bags. This was my second time making popcorn balls, I know the kids will love um. I liked them and will make them again. I did use green food coloring, what a great idea for Halloween, with orange ribbion for the tie. My husband said I did not ball them up tight enough.

Very good recipe! I made them for my daughters class christmas party and they were a big hit! They also stayed soft and chewy longer than I expected. I used butter flavored crisco to grease my hands and it added a good hint of butter.

This recipe is wonderful!  The popcorn balls are soft and chewy. I doubled the recipe and used 6 bags of plain microwave popcorn.  I also used margarine on my hands, instead of shortening, for rolling.

The only tip I would give is to sift out the kernel's before you make the syrup coating and before your ready to form the balls. I put 1/2 of the popcorn into a large bowl and shook it. Most of the kernels will fall to the bottom. I picked up the popcorn with my hands and transferred to another large bowl. Once I got to the bottom it was all kernels and threw them out. Then, all my popcorn was ready to be formed. I then made the syrup covering.

Mixture seemed thick.  I would've preferred a thin coating.  But I don't know how to mess with the recipe without taking a chance of messing it up.  They were very tasty.  My 3 year old was hesitant to try one, not every seeing one before.  He loved it!

These were delish! We made them last week "just because". This week we will make them to hand out as Birthday treats for my soon to be 10 year old girl. She liked them so much she wants to share them with her class! :) I split the recipe into 2 big bowls while mixing.

Thought this would be like the popcorn balls I had as a kid, but after eating it, don't believe those had marshmallows and they just made it too sweet.  Was very easy to make though

These turned out perfect.  I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the marshmallow mixture just before pouring over the popcorn.  I also coated them in a large paper grocery sack so clean-up was easy.  The kids loved them.

First time making popcorn balls and they were a total success. It was fun getting sticky hands and chasing the kiddo around the house. This recipe is super sweet which is the reason for the four stars. But if you love over the top sweet you would rate these little suckers a five. I remember as a kid getting really burned from the mixture my mom used and I have never wanted to try this with my own kid because of that. This mixture cools pretty quickly and doesn't have the hard crack candy temperature to dabble with.

These did turn out great!  Make sure you let it cool a little before shaping the balls, it sticks better and you won't burn yourself.  I made 18 tennis ball size.

Really liked these!  As other suggested, I added about 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and oiled my hands before rounding them into balls.  Because I made them a little bit on the smaller side, I was about to do about 30 for my son's Halloween party but a bigger one would certainly do 20 as stated.  I didn't find them too sweet.  I did break up the batches in 1/2 so it would be easier and was a little light handed on the first batch with the sugar mixture so I probably put a little bit too much on the second batch but I'm sure they're still great!  Would make again but doing them by myself took hours since I wanted them to look pretty for the class.

I just wanted some sweet popcorn, as I am a popcorn fanatic.  I did have the confectioners sugar on hand, but not the corn syrup or marshmallows.  I used butter and not margarine.  It turned out tasty.  I used three bowls to combine the mixture with the popcorn.  I wish I would have read the reviews first, because I would have added the vanilla flavoring.  Be careful, the mixture is hot and will burn your fingers.  I did add salt after the corn was popped.  I would suggest that you don't use microwave popcorn, but make the popcorn from scratch on the stove.

I made these for my children's Valentine's Day party and they were a disaster!!  I read many of the suggestions/comments beforehand and used many of the ideas (i.e. greasing your hands to form the balls, adding vanilla, etc.)  I ended up with a BIG gooey mess and once the balls were formed they were either very hard, crumbly or too soft.  I made the recipe based on 20 servings and I'd like to see the person who can cook and assemble 20 balls in 20 min.  It took me 1 1/2 hours for this project.  Needless to say, I won't be making these again and they didn't go over at all!

Tasty as anything - but I think I "squished" the balls too hard because they are rock-hard and barely edible.  Even the kids were disappointed these were so hard to eat.  If we make them again, I think I'll squeeze them less tight - and maybe bump up my review to 5 stars!!!

These are properly named for certain.  Second time I have ever made popcorn balls. I ended up making 2 batches and plan to make a couple of more.  They look pretty and taste good.  I am very excited to give these to my children and grandchildren this Christmas.  A big Thank you!!

These really were great...and unbelievably Easy!  As suggested in comments, I substituted vanilla for the 2 tsp of water.  The whole family loved them and I worried whether there'd be enough left for trick or treaters.  Then I realized they'd been so quick and easy to throw together that, heck, I could just make more!

Loved these! I made them with 4 bags of microwave popcorn which gave them a sweet/salty kettlecorn kind of taste ~ delish! :) I mixed up the popcorn and coating in two separate batches, keeping the coating just warm on the stove until I did the 2nd batch. Forming the balls is made very easy by wetting your hands just slightly with cold water. I let them to set up on parchment paper, then wrapped in plastic wrap. With the 4 bags of microwave popcorn, the recipe yielded  24 generous sized balls. Thank you tabkat for a new favorite treat recipe! :)

I made these for my neice for Halloween.  I added approximately 2 cups of Honey Roasted Peanuts and enough green food coloring to make them a dark lime-green color.  They were awesome!  Everyone loved them, kids and adults alike.  I will definitely be making these again for other holidays.

Great recipe for those of us who like soft popcorn balls. Similar to the kind with just marshmallows and butter, but does not get  soggy like those.  And it only took a few minutes to make!

Very easy to make just follow the recipe. I suggest when forming the balls to wear rubber gloves as it is very hot on the hands. I just sprayed the gloves as I went with bake ease. I also used strawberry marshmellos and they were very yummy

I've been looking for this very recipe for years. Remembering as a small child the chewy, but smooth texture of them. They too can be very addictive, hard not having a second one.

I'm just on day one, but these are the best popcon balls I've ever had! I don't really even like popcorn balls but now I do! The flavor and texture is so delicious.  I did add vanilla though.

I just made these for my little guys and their friends and they all loved them! I followed the recipe except I mixed a cup or more of M&M's in with the popcorn right before forming into balls. They were GOOEY and SOFT and VERY SWEET, I think next time I will try adding more salt to the popcorn and some swiss trail mix, maybe that will give it the sweet/salty flavor I was looking for. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made these yesterday for my daughter's class. They were super simple to make and are very delicious!  I did take the advice from some of the other reviews and added 1 tsp vanilla and used (4 bags) microwave popcorn. Other than that, I followed the directions and they turned out great!

Everyone that I make these for loves them.  The only change I make is putting a hershey's kiss in the middle when I make them.  I tried to put M&M's in the mix, but they melt and don't look pretty.  I have also used the strawberry marshmallows in them and they are very cute that way too.  Great recipe!

Too sweet for us.  I cut the recipe in half, used 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 bags of light butter popcorn with some plain almonds.  First melted the ingredients together and removed from heat before it boiled.  Then popped the popcorn and removed all the un-popped pieces.  I added some plain Almonds to the popcorn and a bit of vanilla to the melted ingredients, then put the melted ingredients back on the burner until it boiled.  Then poured it over the popcorn.  Mixed it up with a spatula heavily sprayed with Pam in a heavily Pam sprayed pan.  Had no problem with sticking, formed the balls with my hands also heavily sprayed with pam.  To clean the dishes, boil some water in the sauce pan, then pour that into the mixing pan and wipe with cloth.  Not too messy or difficult and pretty tasty too.

First time I've ever made popcorn balls. My 3 kids and I made 2 batches. We used microwave buttered popcorn, 3 bags per batch. It cut the sweet a bit. We rolled them in orange and black sprinkles for Halloween. We'll definitely make them again. Clean up wasn't too bad either!

I just made these for my son's Hallowe'en Party @ school tomorrow, & I found them unbelievably simple to make, & seriously yummy, with just a few minor changes.

1st: I used just a smidge under 2 c. icing sugar

2nd: I'd say I over-poured the mini-marshmallows by probably 1/3 c.

3rd: Added the 1 tsp vanilla & splashes of food colouring as suggested by others, made it really easy to see that all the kernels were coated.

4th: Used buttery microwave popcorn intentionally, so as to have that savoury/sweet thing going on (I found the other suggestions of 3 bags just perfect)

And lastly, I added salted roasted peanuts & shredded coconut (mine was sweetened, but only because that was all I had - unsweetened would have been great too).  My son is lucky to not have any kids with allergies in his class this year, but of course these absolutely don't need the nuts to be delicious. I actually only did half the recipe with the additions, the other half I left just popcorn, some kids might prefer the simple ones.  I got 32 balls, so I didn't ever get to keep one for myself!  I'll have to make another batch!

WAY TOO SWEET!!!  I like the taste and the fact that they are marshmellow and soft (no hard ball stage), but has anyone tried cutting down the sugar?  Next time I don't think I would even put a third as much in.  I also added the vanilla for more flavour and added M&M's.

Wow!  I made about 5 batches of these over the holidays--EVERYBODY loved them!  They're easy to make and absolutely yummy! Much faster to make than the traditional corn syrup version.  I added red food coloring and peppermint flavoring to make my "Holiday" version.  Yummy!

These were great!  I followed the recipe exactly, using 3 bags of microwave popcorn.  This yielded 16 baseball-sized balls.  I used the sink to mix, my crockpot would only fit half the recipe.  I had to spray my hands with cooking spray between each ball.  I added two drops of food coloring, hoping to get that pastel green shade like one of the pictures posted, but although the syrup looked quite green in the pan, by the time it was mixed with the popcorn, you couldn't even see the green.  I'll use more coloring next time.  I also had a bit of difficulty getting the plastic wrap to stick around the balls, since they were coated in cooking spray.

I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla...compared to the  dry popcorn balls I remember from childhood, these were very tasty!  These would be fun to "doll" up for holiday treats. The kids had a blast helping roll the balls.  I suggest making small ones for easier consumption.

This is a great and super easy recipe! I used Kettle Corn instead of regular plain popcorn. Much Much tastier!!! I also added a bit of vanilla and some paste coloring towards the end of the melting process. Yum

These are GREAT. Although next time I will add some vanilla extract for additional flavoring. I used disposable kitchen gloves greased with a little bit of shortening and placed the balls on wax paper after forming. Clean up was a breeze.

I made mine with just butter and marshmallows, vanilla and salt and they were delicious.  I put the pop corn in a brown lunch bag and microwaved it, no trans fat that way!  These tasted GREAT. I WETTED my hands with water and making balls was Super Easy. Not sticky at all.

This was just what I have been looking for!  A trick I used was to mix marshmellow mixture with popcorn and spread it out on cookie sheets for about 10-15 minutes then I shaped them into balls.  I was able to shape the balls without greasing my hands and clean up was easy with just soap and water.  I also replaced marshmellows with fluff. Thank you Kelli

Absolutely the best popcorn balls my family has ever had.  I reduced the popcorn down to 3 microwave bags and I used butter to grease my hands instead of shortening.  I also lightly buttered the bowl that I put the popcorn and mix in.  I have already passed around the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe.

These are absolutely the best popcorn balls ever.  My mom used to make the kind with just the kayro syrup and bring it to soft ball stage.  THey were too hard and stuck to your teeth.  This recipe is perfect.  I would give 100 stars if I could.  Name should be changed from Best Ever to TOTALLY AWESOME !  I will make these over and over.  Perfect with 1 tsp Cinnamon oil.

I really enjoyed making these. My dad used to make us popcorn balls when my brother and sister and I were kids. He always used a candy thermometer, but I don't have one so I was glad to find  a recipe that didn't require one. Very Yummy. I didn't have light corn syrup so I used dark and thought they turned out quite good. I also used butter on my hands to make the  balls instead of shortening. That's what my dad used and I find it gives the popcorn balls even more yummy flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Unfortunately, this didn't work out as well as I had planned. I thought it was going to be easy, but it turned out to be a sticky mess. The flavor wasn't anything special, so that didn't even justify all the trouble I went through. My only recommendation: Don't attempt to make this unless you have someone else there to help out! It takes more than two hands!!!

Unless you have a really big mixing bowl, I would divide this recipe in half and make two separate batches.  They taste awesome, but it was hard to deal with in that big a quantity.

Excellant popcorn balls. My daycare children helped make them. The parents loved them too. I divided them in to bowls so each one of the children could make their own. we made some red and some green in the same batch we made 24 nice size ones.Make sure u spray hands and measure cups with spray grease. Thanks so much!!!!

Wonderful!  These were so much fun to both make and eat!  My husband and I made these for our son's kindergarten Halloween party.  We had a great time...like a throw-back from our childhoods!  We added orange food coloring.  We used permanent black markers to draw Halloween images on the outside of clear saran wrap, then wrapped the balls up.  There was enough caramel sauce for about 30 fair sized balls.  Fun, fun, fun!

The reason this recipe appealed to me was because it used less butter and I wanted my popcorn balls to be very white. I'm happy to say tha they were and they also were very good, easy to make and an absolut hit with my kids.

Not a fan at all. Decided to make popcorn balls for the first time in at least 30 years for my daughter's birthday treat at school. I grew up making popcorn balls and loved them. These don't taste anywhere near as good as what I'm used to. They're too sweet, even for this sugar addict. The flavor just isn't good. And, worse than that is the completely UNcrispy popcorn. It's really gross and I'm so embarrassed that I sent them to school with my daughter.

I didn't think I liked popcorn balls, but I really enjoyed these! I used salted butter instead of margarine. Because butter has less sodium than margarine, next time I'll add a little salt.

The texture of the sauce was too gooey and it made the popcorn too chewy for my taste. I like a crunchier texture. I will not make these again.

This was the first time I made popcorn balls and they tasted great.  I did make the recommend adjustments from others by adding 2 tsp vanilla, cutting back on sugar, and adding 2 tsp sea salt.  I did not give 5 stars as I thought it took a bit more time than given in recipe.  I felt it was cumbersome to mix all the popcorn with the coating.  I did use food handling gloves which helped.  I ended up working with 4 large bowls to stir and coat properly!  So a bit messy, but worth it.  I would make again.  I added candy corn and took these to a Halloween block party tonight and they were a definite hit, especially with the kids.

I made these two days ago and they turned out great. I added 2 tsp of caramel flavoring instead of vanilla and they were delicious. I couldn't believe how easy they were to make. I used a small bowl of cold water to dip my hands in to keep the balls from sticking and it worked perfectly. My 6 year old loved them and they were a hit at her school Christmas party. We will definitely be making these again.

Loved this recipe.  The video said to heat until marshmallows are melted, but the instructions say to heat until a boil.  I followed the instructions and the mixture came out fantastic!  I also used organic coconut oil on my hands to mold into shape and that little hint of coconut flavor really tops it off.

I tried the popcorn balls because of the wonderful reviews. I followed the recipe to a T. I felt very uneasy after I read the popcorn ball recipe on the popcorn bag. Well, no one like the popcorn balls. They were rubbery not crispy at all. The recipe made around 14.

I adjusted the recipe to 10 servings, and didn't tweak a thing. They are easy to shape, chewy, and waay too sweet! I say 1/4 cup of powder sugar would've been just fine (for 10 popcorn balls).

This is a great starter recipe for popcorn balls. I had never made popcorn balls before, so this was simple. I made a batch by using the exact recipe. It was way too sweet. I then made a second batch using buttered popcorn and adding a touch of vanilla and salt. This batch was much better!

Easiest that I've ever made popcorn balls.  We used PAM to coat our hands and scaled the recipe back to only serve five (one bag of microwave popcorn, 3 T. corn syrup, 1 T. butter, 1/4 C. marshmallows and a little more than a 1/2 C. of powdered sugar), so everything was very manageable--putting them together was a fun and sticky activity for my 5-year-old. They were tasty, but too sweet for my taste.  Five stars for simplicity, four for taste.

I really like this recipe. I use it often, however, I use a little less popcorn than called for and add a small amount of vanilla for added flavor. These are almost fool proof. Gooey and addictive!

Great recipe with one easy modification:  use butter flavored popcorn (I used light butter bagged popcorn) because it gives great flavor.  If you use plain popped, it will be very bland.  These were chewy, sweet, and delicious, just like I remembered them from my childhood!  The simplicity of the recipe allows the popcorn flavor to shine.  Adding other flavors like vanilla would take away from that.

super easy. Here is a Holiday suggestion. I made these for a  Halloween party. I only had Chocolate marshmallows (monster poo's) - the color is a little bit gray....so they made awesome looking Monster Brains. Wrapped them in baggies- kids are going LOVE them.

This truly is the best ever popcorn ball recipe! It was easy to make. My 3- and 5-year old sons were able to help me. I'm going to make these and add little tags to them for Christmas treats.

I made this recipe as it is stated and they came out really good! I made them really big so I didn't get quite so many out of it and I air popped the popcorn instead of using microwaveable.  This is my go-to popcorn ball recipe! Thank you for sharing!

It was a huge hit!  I was asked to bring popcorn balls, but I had never eaten or made them before.  I made them exactly like the recipe.  I only wish I had followed others suggestions and mixed it in a flat/shallow dish like a casserole dish and not a bowl.  Messy.

I cannot give these five starts because they were a little too chewy for me and my family. I think I will try them again because the flavor was delicious but with less "syrup" mixture or more popcorn. I used 3 bags and there was just too much goo for the amount of popcorn.

This is my first attempt at making popcorn balls.   I tried very hard to keep the uncooked kernels out but some did make it into the finished product.   The worst thing was almost burning my fingers trying to form the balls.   Not something to do with children!   They did taste good though.

Extremely easy! I used air popped popcorn, about 2 run throughs with the 1/2 cup of kernels each.  I sprayed our hands with the butter flavored Pam spray, and made about 1/2 cup balls instead of 1 cup.  Delish!

So easy to make and they are pretty yummy! My son loves them. I added butter instead of margarine as well as a bit of salt to cut the sweet. A little orange food colouring and they are a halloween treat!

I am not a fan of popcorn balls, but I can say this- my kids loved them and the balls are not all dried and hard, they are more chewy and do not crumble all over the place when bit into. Thanks for this recipe!

After trying several recipes and raising quite a few blisterss, I tried this and loved it. I added wilton paste coloring and also tried a batch with liquid food coloring, and both worked well. I also put a gumdrop in the center of some and mixed candy in with others. Also added a tsp of vanilla after took it off the stove and added the color. Helped to let the formed balls dry out a little before packing in zip bags. Thanks for this treat!

These were super easy to make.  I added a tsp of vanilla, as had been recommended somewhere else and they tasted great.  The key to getting them to stick together is definitely the shortening on your hands; I tried cooking spray first and it didn't work. I will definitely make these again!!!

Great recipe.  Used two and a half bags of light popcorn and a tsp. of vanilla.  Coworker's words, "I give the popcorn ball an A plus plus."

I made these for Halloween to share with my family. They are delicious!! I did add in the vanilla and threw in a couple of handfuls of peanuts. My niece and I will be making them for the Christmas bake sale at church. We will be adding dried cranberries and M&M's to make them look like ornaments. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

I made these and accidently left out the powdered sugar.  I did add the vanilla and as I posted earlier I also added cashews and halloween cookie sprinkles.  They were awesome.  I'm going to try it again using peanuts, mini chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and some Thanksgiving spinkles.  They may end up too busy, but what the heck.

After about 1 week of telling my kids I would make popcorn balls , today was the day.   The preparation was simple and took very little time and the balls looked great. Yet , a few hours later when I gave them to my kids they refused to eat them. The balls are WAY too sweet and too gooey , you can barely chew them . Next time I will use A LOT less Sugar.

Very good recipe. I made these for my daughter and her friends and added some red food coloring to make them pink. Very cute, easy, and tasty. I am planning to make them in orange for my daughter's halloween (fall fest, to be politically correct) party at school.

This is a very simple and quick recipe that tastes pretty good. It's also a good way to get rid of extra popcorn however I think the ingredients should be cut in half because there is twice as much as there should be if you are going for one bag of popcorn.

Just wanted to mention that even if you're tired and misread the directions (I mixed up the amount of powdered sugar with the amount of marshmallows) these are still incredibly delicious!  I can't wait till I make them correctly!  Yum!

Much easier than carmel popcorn as far as preparation goes.  Easy to make, very sweet.  Flavor is similar to rice crispy treats.  I doubled the recipe and made it into 12 snowmen.  If you want to make snowmen, you can use icing or mini M&Ms for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons.  If you plan to use little candies (of any kind) you will need to put them on the snowmen ASAP, because they have to be really stuck on the snowmen before it cools too much.
I greased my hands with Pam cooking spray because it was much easier and faster.  Great recipe.

this recipe gives some basic guidelines, but I checked the comments before I went ahead and was glad I did.  I reduced the amount of flavored gelatin powder to a 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet enough.  Two bags of marshmallows, however made them a bit too gooey.  I tossed in some pieces of chopped candy corn for my son's Thanksgiving party at preschool.

These were a big hit for my boy's Halloween party at school.  They were just as easy as promised and very tasty.  I added 1 tsp vanilla (as suggested by others)and drizzled the finished treats with melted chocolate, then scattered orange sprinkles over the tops.  I think I'll make them again for the school Christmas Bazaar bake sale!

Very very good. It was hard not to eat to many! I did what others suggested and when forming the popcorn into balls I put my can of crisco on the counter, rubbed a small amount on the palms of my hands and fingers, grabbed a big handfull of popcorn and firmly packed the popcorn in my hand into a ball. No problems with falling apart!

These were a big hit for the 6th graders (and adults).  Added 1 tsp vanilla to the marshmallow mixture to enhance the flavor.  Also added orange and black food coloring to the mixture for a subtle color variation.  Stuck in some spider rings into each bag to give the effect of spiders crawling on the balls.  Used sandwich bags over our hands coated with Pam - worked like a charm!

I made these for my daughter's Brownie troop with the vanilla added and they LOVED them.  I am making them right now for my son's class and made some for my partner's work.  I was careful to catch the mix at the softball stage and just used shortening and my hands...at first a tad warm but fine after a bit.  Thanks!

These called for a lot of extra ingredients that did not add an extra to the recipe.  The taste was pure sugar, no real flavor.  I added candy to the recipe to help out, at least they were pretty.
I wouldn't make these again.

Great recipe!  I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn and mixed 1/2 the popcorn and 1/2 the gooey mixture to make it more managableand then mixed the other half.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is great tasting and easy to make.. they only problems i had was you have to watch how long you cook it. my balls wouldn't stay formed and i tried using the glove technique others talked about.. didn't work for me.. just used my greased hands. But don't give up. I'm not going to try again Friday for Halloween

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making popcorn balls and it was so easy.  I'm making them for a Halloween party, but i wanted to test out the recipe so used the servings calculator and cut the recipe to a fourth.  I think I will do this when i make a whole batch because the 5 cups of popcorn fit in a regular sized mixing bowl and made it very easy to coat all of the popcorn.  

1 bag of popcorn was just about 5 cups.

Pretty good, I added 2 tsp vanilla, gave it  a nice underflavor, but otherwise, it didn't have one.  I made slightly smaller balls than most people and got 30 out of this recipe.

These are very sweet and perfect popcorn balls... and easy, too!  I added a tiny bit of vanilla as I've read a couple of reviewers had done, and I would also add more popcorn next time.  I had quite a bit of leftover mixture, that I wish I could have used, but if I put too much on the balls become goopy.  If using microwave popcorn, I'd suggest almost 3 bags. YUM!

Yummy! I made them with butter flavored popcorn though. We put them on sticks and dipped half in chocolate and sprinkles for a halloween treat :) 
I used olive oil on my hands, because I am out of cooking spray. 
Easy recipe.
Easy to make.
Yummy!

The flavor was great, the recipe was easy to follow but the popcorn was too hard and chewy to bite in to. I made this for a school fund raiser and I couldn't even give them away for free after some of the other kids tried them first and complained. sorry.

I have tried many times to make pop-corn balls and failed miserably but was able to make these without any problems.  I also added a little vanilla and used marshmallow creme instead of marshmallows.  They taste good, nothing to go crazy about but I will still serve them at my Halloween party this year.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe.  However, I would definitly put some sort of flavoring in it next time.  I drizzled icing over mine to make them a little more decorative.

Yummy and easy!! This was my first attempt to make popcorn balls - something about the start of fall makes me crave them!! These were really easy to make and surprisingly not too messy. I used butter to grease my hands and found that I needed to re-butter every couple of balls I made, otherwise they stuck to my hands and pulled apart. I will probably wait until the mixture cools a little before I try and form them next time...ouch!

These really were the best ever!  Even two days later they were just as good as the first day--still chewy and delicious.  I mixed everything up in a big brown grocery bag which made it easier to handle.

I made a perfect batch of popcorn balls for Easter with this recipe! It was quick and easy, and the popcorn balls remained easy to eat even after a couple of days. Not like my memories of practically breaking my teeth on mom's popcorn balls!

This was a fun and easy recipe to do with my granddaughter for Halloween. I found that my roasting pan was the best to use to put the balls together and letting the mixture cool formed the best balls. I added vanilla to one batch and colored two more orange. I let my granddaughter and her friend form the last batch. They had great fun.

I made these for my husband, and he said they were by far the best popcorn balls he'd ever had.  He's quite the lover of them so I I'd take it as a compliment, and if he didn't like them he'd say so.  Easy to make, and great to eat.

These popcorn balls were easy to make and quite delicious.  They didn't stick to my teeth nearly as much as I thought they would while eating them.  I used microwave kettle corn instead of fresh popcorn, but I thought the sweetness of the popcorn added to the taste.  I will definitely keep this recipe around.

These definitely are the best! Easy to make - the shortening is a must when forming into balls. I added green food coloring to the syrup mixture and then wrapped the balls in cellophane and tied with orange ribbon for a Halloween party. This could very well be a yearly tradition!

These are great!  I made these for my aunt who loves popcorn balls and she said they were the best she has ever had.  Now she calls me every couple of weeks wanting me to make her some more.

I wanted to make something fun for easter for my nephews who both love popcorn.  My sister found this recipe and it seemed much less complecated than others on the web.  All of the ingrediants were in the pantry and there was no need for me to purchase a candy thermometer.  Instead of using bulk popcorn, we used "Pop Secret" extra butter microwave popcorn, and oops...I forgot the water.  They were done in moments, and taste great,in fact the two year old kept stealing the balls off the counter they were so good. This recipe will become part of my "you spoil the kids with treats " action.  What could be bad about buttery popcorn and chewy sugar!!!

I added walnuts to one batch...turned out good, but I added m&ms to another, but they got crushed rather easily.  These turned out very tasty and were fun and easy to make.  I will make again and be more experimental.

I also added vanilla. They turned out great! I accidentally found a great way to keep them from sticking to your hands while forming them. Liberally coat your hands with butter then run them under cold water but do not dry them, just shake off excess water and form your popcorn into balls. As soon as it feels like they are starting to stick,  just run them under cold water again and repeat.

These came out great! I scaled it down to 6 cups of popcorn as a 'trial run', and I was happy with the results. I also used butter and added a little salt and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the corn syrup mixture. I'll try it with some maple extract another time. I also added a handful of mini candy corn to the popcorn, adding a few more to the outside of the balls. They came out soft and chewy, but I'm wondering how long they'll stay that way. Thanks for the recipe!

As others suggested I added 1/4 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp vanilla extract at end of melting marshmallows. Yielded 14 balls sized slightly bigger than a baseball.  Like that these are soft and slightly chewy.

OK. Not bad, but not really what I think of when I think of popcorn balls.  This turned out closer to rice krispie treats.  In fact, on the last batch I ran out of popped corn, so I made a separate small batch of rice krispie treats.

I made them for Christmas.  I tinted the sauce with green food coloring to make them a seasonal color.  Then I wrapped each one with plastic wrap and tied them shut with thin ribbon.   I hung them on the Christmas tree like decorations.  They looked really cute, plus when your ready for a treat, you can just pick one from the tree and eat.  YUM!

While this is an easy recipe in that it doesn't require boiling syrup until the soft ball stage, the popcorn is soggy and pretty tasteless.  I won't make it again.

I made this the day before and they were quite soft and chewy unlike any popcorn balls I have had. I didn't like the flavor. It could have been the popcorn or the marshmellows. It tasted stale after 1 day. I  made it and put in baggies.

Loved the recipe!  I made it with my daughter for May Day baskets.  Easy enough for a 9 year old to shape into balls.  We  rolled them in sprinkles. They stayed soft for 4-5 days with saran wrap.

Really very good! It has the "taste" I am after with a popcorn ball. I cut back a bit on the popcorn so I can have more "goo" to it. As suggested by others, I cut back the powdered sugar to 2 cups, and added 1 Tbsp of vanilla at the end after it all heated together and prior to the popcorn.

Eh, they were just okay.  I added some green and red MnM's to make them a bit more festive.  For cuteness, I give them 5 starts.  For taste, 3 stars.  Next time I'll use less popcorn so there's more goo to kernel ratio.

Theses are great and unlike traditional popcorn balls they don't break your teeth once set. Make sure to wrap them well or keep in an air tight container as the marshmallow part that keeps then soft will get hard if exposed to the air for too long.
A few things were a bit different since I just used what was in my kitchen. Butter instead of margarin, buttered microwave popcorn and regular corn syrup. I think regular corn syrup is actually better to use as it gives the coating more flavor. You don't need a muffin tin to set them, you just need to squeeze very tightly when forming the ball. In regards to the measurement for the confectionery sugar. 2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons is easier for people than 2 5/8 cups.
Overall a great recipe. Sweet, chewy, salty and buttery.

Great, quick, easy recipe for a soft chewy popcorn ball. It didn't make nearly as many as I expected though, only about 15, & I didn't really think I made them all that big. I'd hoped to try the maple flavoring others recommended, but couldn't find it. Maybe next time! Overall, my family enjoyed these, but I think I might try a recipe for crispier, crunchier popcorn balls next time.

This made 8 soft ball size popcorn balls.
Delicious!!

I liked this recipe, but as others said it is pretty sweet and didn't have a lot of flavor, even with the vanilla. I wonder about adding orange or raspberry flavoring, or even a packet of kool-ade to give it some fun flavor.  I filled a big plastic bowl with hot air popped corn ( which can be a little soggy/stale on it's own) I thought the bowl was about 6 quarts.  I used a 1 cup measuring cup as a scoop, and tapped it out on waxed paper. I didn't have gloves but read someplace else to use 2 plastic bags. I coated them with Pam spray just once. Then I grabbed the clump of popcorn squeezed it pretty firmly and got 15 larger popcorn balls. I made them for Halloween night for my grown kids, so I added orange food coloring. I like the soft marshmallowish popcorn balls. But they just needed more flavor. They did come together pretty fast maybe 30 minutes including hot-air popping the corn.

These were great! My first time making popcorn balls and they turned out amazing. I added some ground ginger and some pumpkin spice. My family ate them up!

Super easy & delicious!   First time ever making popcorn balls. I read the reviews, and made a few changes as suggested by others. I used 2 cups of confectioners sugar, deleted the water and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, at the end, instead.  Used vinyl gloves,  sprayed with Pam to shape balls, 1 Cup measuring cup, sprayed with Pam, to measure amount & cooled in sprayed muffin tins. I also added orange food coloring for Halloween.  I will definitely make them again!

Adding a little more butter as well as some cinnamon and vanilla extract made this recipe AMAZING. I think drizzling some dark chocolate over it or adding some nuts would be delicious additions too. Basically, it's a good base recipe, however it needs some additions or else it will be bland.

Yum! To help take away the burn when shaping I put a pair of winter "magic gloves" (REALLY thin gloves that don't keep the hands warm) and a pair of non latex gloves over them. NO BURNING AND NO STICKING!!!

This was my first time making popcorn balls. I thought it would be harder but it was so simple! I followed the recipe as is, just added some vanilla. They were perfect! My nieces helped me, and after about a minute of mixing with spatula, they were warm enough to touch.

This was a fabulous quick treat for New Years--popcorn balls while we waited for the ball to drop. My kids were begging for dessert and we had run out of Christmas cookies...this was the perfect solution! It is very quick and they were delighted.

These were very good.  I'm giving them 4 stars because they were so difficult to work with.  I tried spraying non-stick spray on my hands but was not successful.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and forced the popcorn into a measuring cup, but it was too difficult to get it out.  Then I tried butter on my hands...after much maneuvering, this finally worked.  After forming the balls, I noticed they were falling apart on the sheet I had placed them on.  So, more shaping was required.  I quickly wrapped them in plastic wrap hoping to help them retain their shape.  Whew!  It was quite a fight to form these into balls.  But they do taste good.  Because tomorrow is Halloween, I added Pumpkin Spice Candy Corn to the balls...very festive.  I may make these again, but do to the difficulty, probably only once a year for Halloween.  I didn't want too many popcorn balls, so I halved the recipe...it yielded 6 medium-to-large popcorn balls.  UPDATE: 10/30/17 Made these again and had no trouble forming them into balls because I did as written and used some shortening (Crisco) on my hands.  Not nearly as much as the video displays, just about 1 teaspoon for every 3 balls.  I don't know why, but this time I got 11 popcorn balls approx. the size of a large baseball (not quite a softball).  I varied it this year and added a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, roasted peanuts and milk chocolate chips...tinged them orange and enjoyed festive and very tasty Halloween popcorn balls!

pretty easy. Just once you pour the mix on popcorn stir it up and let it sit for a bit then it will be easier for u to make them into balls. ANd keep butter close by for your hands

Made these on Halloween.   I didn't have vegetable shortening, so I sprayed my hands with Pam cooking spray as suggested in the "video tips".  Did NOT work! I ended up just scooping the popcorn onto to squares of plastic wrap and forming them into balls that way.  Was much easier, and cleaner!

This recipe was so great! It worked so much better than any other recipe I've ever used to make popcorn balls. It works best to let the mix cool just a bit before shaping it - it shapes MUCH better once the "goo" has set up a bit. What a great recipe!

This was so easy and so yummy.  Took me back to those childhood days during Christmas when we would find popcorn balls in our stockings.   Didn't modify a thing, but I used dark corn syrup instead of light because it was all I had.  I like the darker color of the popcorn balls anyhow.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Delicious. Easy. Quick. I popped 3 bags of popcorn while the ingredients were heating on the stove. I added a few tablespoons of homemade vanilla extract and BOY did it hit the spot! 

I used only 2.5 bags of popcorn and it is quite sticky and very well coated. I greased a large baking pan with butter and poured the popcorn and heated sugar mixture into the pan, stirring as I went. I did not form these into popcorn balls, but left it as a casserole of sorts to be chipped off and cut into---mainly because I figured out I didn't have saran wrap until after I started making this! 

Really a delicious recipe.

This turned out great.  I did add the vanilla 1 1/2 tsp which is perfect.  Seems as though you have a little more time to work with making the balls before it gets hard vs the old way of doing it.  I put them in baggies right after and they stayed nice and chewy, not hard to eat at all.

So yummy and so easy! My 4-year-old daughter and I made this after tasting a prepackaged popcorn ball she got in her Halloween bucket, yuck. We cut the recipe to use the last bag of microwave popcorn on hand so we wouldn't have to go to the store first. Just 1 1/2 marshmallows for the bag of popcorn, and we still wound up with 6 tasty half-sized balls. Perfect for our family of three, and a great kitchen activity to share with my kiddo!

These were SO easy to make and they reminded me of the popcorn balls my mom used to make for Halloween years ago.    I made two batches and took them to work.  They were a big hit with everyone.

These were very, very good.  I was trying to find a recipe similar to some we tried at a Halloween party last weekend.  These tasted pretty close.  I used 3 bags of light butter microwave popcorn and was able to get 20 popcorn balls.  I will use this recipe again.

Very yummy but a lot of hardwork!  Too sticky.  I tried to follow a few reviews and tried gloves with Pam but this didn't work for me.   I won't be doing this again.

Sorry, didn't like this at all.  It was a mess and then some.  Understand that popcorn balls can take time but even with suggestions of oiling hands and using muffin tins-still was a pain to shape into balls.  I was not impressed with the flavor either but had several people say they liked them.
Won't be attmepting this one again.

This recipe was sooo easy and delicious!  I really don't understand why people had popcorn balls that were not sticking together.  I boiled the mix for a couple of min. longer and used half of the mixture for one color and half for the other.  I made 2 batches so that I could make baseball sized balls with the neon colors as stated before me (green, purple and orange).  I did use the white rubber gloves and sprayed them with cooking spray (p.s it also keeps the food coloring off of your hands!), sprayed the spoon and sprayed the insert from crockpot.  It was so so easy that way!  I really don't understand why some think it is too sweet..unless they are used to the dry bland ones from the olden days.  I too used microwave popcorn. Very easy and fast that way with hardly any kernels left over.  I will definitely make these again! Oh..and don't forget the vanilla!!  Happy Halloween!

This recipe was very good and very fast. My daughter and I whipped these up in about 15 minutes. These are nice and soft and not hard, we added a bit of vanilla for flavor. This will be our new recipe for popcorn balls.

I did not care for this recipe. 
Maybe I didn't have enough popcorn.. but I was not impressed.
The goo got everywhere and it was hard to shape the popcorn into balls. 
I tried to make these to give away as party favors but since they were such a mess it didn't work out.

maybe it was just me, but I thought these we are bit too "powdered-sugary" for my liking.  they did keep soft though, can't complain about that.

I totally forgot to add the vanilla as other reviewers suggested, but they still had a nice subtle sweet flavor.  I popped a couple of batches of kernals on the stovetop and the ratio of syrup to popcorn turned out great. I had some disposable latex gloves which I washed well and used to form the popcorn.  DEFINATELY use Pam on your hands otherwise you have a sticky mess!  Both of those tips were GREAT! Thanks.

Yummy!  These were so easy to make and soooo good!  My only complaint is that handling the popcorn to form into balls is a little difficult because of the temperature - it's hot!  But no pain, no gain!  Next time I make these (and there will be a next time) I will add a bit more popcorn to even out the mix more.  I got lots of compliments on the popcorn balls!

Great recipe! I took one reviewer's suggestion and combined the popcorn and syrup mixture in  a clean sink.  This made it super easy to evenly coat the popcorn mixture and clean up was a snap by filling the sink with hot water.  In one batch, I added candy corn...very cute for Halloween.  Will definitely add this to my collection of favorites!

These were so easy and so much fun for the kids.  They tasted great!!! Just be sure and wait a few minutes after pouring the sauce over the popcorn...it can be extremely hot.

What a fun and easy recipe.  This is my first time making popcorn balls and they turned out perfect.  Kids loved them.  Tip to spray PAM on my hands to form the balls was a *big* help.  Thanks!

Great treat! They were just like the popcorn balls I used to get from my neighbor every Halloween. Exactly what I was looking for in an old fashioned flavored treat.

The popcorn balls were very good. I had never had any with marshmallows in them and I loved them. I had to make two batches because by the time I got home the next day they were all gone.

These are so good and very easy!!  I added red food coloring for this first batch and will be making both a red and green batch for a Xmas party next week.  With this being the first batch I halfed the recipe.  I gave these to Japanese exchange students and they were a huge hit.

Excellent!  To bring up the flavor I combined vanilla extract, butter extract (and food coloring for the appropriate holiday.)

Fun to make, especially if you have a partner. Stays chewy and sweet.
