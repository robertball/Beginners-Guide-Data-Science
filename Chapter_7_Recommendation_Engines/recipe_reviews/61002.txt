If you leave the potato dough in the fridge overnight after mashing it makes it much easier to work with

I live in Germany and the proper spelling of these would be Kartoffel Kl√∂ss, I would omit the nutmeg and add bacon bits instead.

My very German family has been making a ariation of this recipe for years. We add the onion to the potatoes, do not use nutmeg and only butter browned bread crumbs on top. This variation was good although we prefer the recipe my grandmother brought from generations in Germany.

I found these easy to make and faster than I expected.  My first batch didn't hold together well, but I found adding another egg white fixed it.  These were a very big hit, especially with my son's darling girlfriend.

I grew up on a variation of this. Boil potatoes, cool, peel, salt, pepper, nutmeg. Cut potatoes and cube onions. Put through grinder on rough setting adding onion pieces. Add seasoning as you grind. When done mix with eggs and flour. THEN make snowball size balls. Boil a little longer after they rise. One layer per bowl. Best with sauer braten but also good with rouladen though I cheat and add vinegar to my part of the gravy.  About two large yellow onions worth of onions. No bread or crumbs.  Just grind pieces as you grind the potatoes turning bowl as it comes out of the grinder to dispurse evenly.

They tasted great! I let the potatoes  cool off completely before I mixed up the batch. I omitted the nutmeg and added some onions instead. The flavor was great when I poured on my pork/wine gravy.

I was given a recipe for Kartoffel Kloss by my mother-in-law who received it from her mother-in-law.  I have lost the receipe so I have used this one with some variations.  Works great with the Sauerbrauten! Still looking for my original German receipe!

These took much longer than I had anticipated in making.  (Shamefully, I was used to the boxed version and did not expect such a messy dough!)  I had to add an incredible amount of flour to be able to work with it at all.  I used Sauerbraten gravy over them, not the recommended gravy.  My husband liked them very much.

5 because memories of sauerbraten and KartoffelGlase, as Nan called them, are priceless. I lost her recipe years ago. She made hers larger, about the size of a small potato and they were oblong, about 3 1/2". She also put a crouton in the center and rolled them in browned/ buttered bread crumbs when done. My fondest memories are of slicing them the next day into potato pancakes and frying them. Add apple sauce for breakfast. SOoooo Good. Thanks for this, with the few changes, these were very close to Nan's. I've come to realize that each region of Germany has their particular variation of these. Your reviews would bare that out. Just make and tweak them to your families version.

My Oma always used to make these too and we all loved them as kids. These dumplings were wonderful but the only change I made was replacing the nutmeg with garlic and onion powders. So good SlimCooking and thank you!

Delicious!  Not only did my family like them, but my neighbors daughter, who was visiting at the time and very picky, liked them.  I served them with Sauerbraten and red cabbage.  Yummy!!  I added a little more salt so they wouldn't be too bland and cooked them in some of the juice from the sauerbraten.

It's a good inexpensive thing to cook, but if you follow the recipe straight, you better hope you like a lot of butter and onion flavor!

My mom used to make a version of these with pork roast and sauerkraut when I was little-it was the meal I requested every year for my birthday dinner even as an adult. Unfortunately she got dementia before I got the chance to learn how she perfected the recipe. I followed this recipe as it contained most of the same ingredients she used but my dumplings didn't hold together well, really got mushy and fell apart when I boiled them.  Should I have used more flour? They rolled well before boiling. I would love to perfect them to then prepare them for my siblings-any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

A little plain, but could be seasoned according to taste or done with a gravy.

My mother is German and she boils the potatoes, peels them lets them sit either all day or if you cook them in the afternoon overnight (whole).  The next day she grinds them in a meat grinder and makes her mixture, rolls them in a ball and cooks them.  She does it this way so they are not as sticky while working with the mixture.  Just a tip.  This is how my grandmother made Kl√∂√üe.

I made these to go with Sauerbraten and I did like them. When I lived in Germany I loved these and this recipe was very similar to the ones I was used to. I think a bit more nutmeg to the potato mixture. I was not overly thrilled with the sauce since it was basically butter, which while delicious is not really a sauce. I did add some nutmeg to it to add some flavor but I still felt it was unnecessary. Since I served this with Sauerbraten I put that gravy over it.
