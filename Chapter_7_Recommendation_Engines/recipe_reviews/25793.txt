I like the taste and blend of the crust ingredients.  However, the topping was too thin and would not set after baking.  I would suggest baking the crust/chocolate chips, p/nut butter chips first then after cooling add a cream cheese topping, maybe Cool Whip and cream cheese/sugar blended together.  Maybe shave some chocolate on top for ganish or sprinkle w/mini-chips.

I just made this for Easter.  It was not a big hit. I hated the crust since I hate box cake mix. I had to bake it longer like the others said.
Sorry it was not good.

I did an ingredient search for a few items I had on hand and this recipe came up. I was shocked how much XXX sugar it asked for, so I used only 1/3 of a box when other reviews said it was so sweet. I also took their advice and used only half the chocolate chips. My only problem was I had no cake mix, so I used a packaged muffin mix, and it did fine. The cooking time and oven temp is not right, and I bumped it up to 325 like the others did. The consistancy is good and I had no problems with runniness. But would have liked a denser cream cheese -- this is a bit spongy. I am giving this only two stars because I had to change the recipe for it to come out right, on the advice of the other reviews. Taste is okay but nothing special-- won't make them again.

I followed the recipe  as written except I used one 10 ounce bag of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips and I baked at 325 for 55 minutes.  Yes, these are very, very rich and sweet but my family loved them.  After cooling for about one hour these still required a fork to eat, but overnight they firmed up very nicely and could be cut into neat little bars. Next time I will make them the day before I plan to serve.

This was very good, but we thought, (even the kids), that there was way too much chocolate chips and it took away from the taste of everything else.  Next time I make I will cut the chips down to 1 cup.  Did take other reviewers advice and baked at 325 for about 35 minutes.  Consistency was great!  Thanks Lana

YUMMMM!!!  I made this the other day because I had all the ingredients on hand and it was delicious!  It is very rich, but oh so good.  My hubby and son loved it, I took a piece into work for a girl, and she loved it.  Next time, I may add peanut butter chips to it also, and try to cut back on the 10x sugar, but I do know this is a keeper!

Really easy to make. I kept them in the fridge and every time that I cut a piece I would microwave for 25 seconds and top with a dollop (or two) of whipped cream. Alot of chocolate which was more than okay with me. No problem with the cream cheese being runny. Came out great. Finished last crumb in bed last night.

I chose this recipe while looking for something special to make with my boyfriend's son. He loves to help me cook and I love teaching him! This was easy and we had fun making it but he ate very little of it all weekend. It is very rich and sweet. Almost too much chocolate. His sister loves it so I cut some in very small squares and sent a plate home with them! Not sure if I will try this again and cut back a bit on the chocolate chips.

Excellent!! Very sweet & rich just the way I like it. I baked it on 325 instead of 300. The cream cheese top will remain gogey even if refrigerated.

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes!  Every time I make them, people ask me for the recipe.  Like other reviewers have said, they are very sweet, but that's the way I like them.  If you don't, I would recommend cutting the sugar back by 1/3 or 1/2 and only using 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Baking them at 300 for 50 minutes is definitely not enough time (and I've tried in 3 different ovens).  I usually do 300 degrees for about 1 hour 10 minutes or 325 degrees for an hour.  You can bake them a little longer for a firmer cream cheese topping (and a harder crust) or a little less for a gooier topping.  In my experience, after cooling overnight, the cream cheese topping is firm enough to eat without a spoon/fork but is still soft.

Delicious. I accidentally bought milk chocolate chips instead so I used those. I had a french vanilla white cake mix in the cupboard so I used that instead of yellow. I used reduced fat, not far free cream cheese too. For the topping I ended up using about 2/3 -3/4 of the amount of sugar listed and 2 eggs instead of 3. I also baked this for ~45 minutes at 350. The hardest part of this recipe is cutting the bars and yes you do need to wait until this is really cool before you cut them.. would be a mess otherwise. Very rich and yummy and I am glad I am getting them out of the house tomorrow morning because I want to eat them all myself. :) I made the bars smaller and ended up with anbout 55 bars from the pan.

These were without a doubt the richest bars I have ever tasted!!  Would be great for family gatherings since one piece is all you can eat.

Taste good, a little gooey even after setting all night; hard to cut into even pieces.  Added 2nd egg to crust, was more like crumbs...increased temp to 350°F and baked the entire 50 min.  
Not something I'd make often cause it's really rich...

I've been making these for several years now.  They are my son's favorite. He asked for these for his last birthday instead of a cake.

They are extremely rich. I agree that the sugar and chocolate chips can be cut back, and I also reduce the butter in the crust. Cooking time is longer for me.

This recipe is similar to my Cream Cheese Bars (or Ooey-Gooey Bars).  The only difference is that this recipe calls for the chocolate chips and an extra egg in the top layer.  This is very good...rich and sweet.  Don't eat too much or you'll get a tummy ache.  My only complaint with this recipe and my own is that the crust doesn't keep very long.  It gets a stale or old taste after just a day or so.  Definitely try this recipe.  It's easy and good!

I baked these at 350 for 45 minutes.  They were a little gooey but when cut with a hot knife not "uncuttable".  They were rich and yummy and tasted like I had slaved all day over them!

This recipe tastes good but top is gooey so I took the other reviewer's advice and turned the oven up to 325 deg. Some other changes I made to the topping was to use 16oz of Cream Cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 TBSP of corn starch, 2 tsp Vanilla. This gave it more of a cheesecake consistency.

YUMMY - It did take longer to bake.  Will be upping the temperature next time.  The thing I love is being able to tweek this.  I used a devil's food cake mix and threw in some peanut butter chips, too.

The consistency of the cream cheese mixture was too runny and it wasn't enough to cover the 9x13 pan.  The taste was average.  Disappointed...

Ok, I think this the trick:
1. Use a 17" x 11" pan (then the cream cheese egg layer isn't too thick)
2. Use only 2 eggs for the top layer.
3. Bake @ 350 for 40 minutes.
4. Omit vanilla
5. I used less choc. chips

These were a huge hit at our holiday potluck.  I baked for 60 mins at 300 and chilled overnight before cutting and they were perfectly cooked.  They are very sweet and the sugar and chips could both be cut back.  So many possibilities for flavor combinations between the cream cheese and the crust

Amazingly good and so easy to make. Everyone loved it. Will deff keep making this. The best part is the ingredients are normally something u always have in the house so no need to go shoping to make a dessert.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It reminded my husband and me of chess cake with chocolate chips. I do agree though that there is a problem with the baking time and/or temperature. I wound up going with 350 for 30 minutes. The dessert actually came out a little too overcooked so next time I'll try using 325. Otherwise, the recipe was easy to make, very tasty and kept well in the freezer for future snacks.

Very, very VERY rich bars. I liked the chewy-ness of the bottom layer, but the topping was  too gooey for our tastes. I MIGHT make this again and use only two eggs and less sugar in the topping. Also, the cooking time was off...I baked it for 50 minutes at 300 as directed and it was still a runny mess.  I ended up increasing the oven temp to 350 for a bit longer and it finally got cooked through.

Very yummy!  Not too rich for our family!  I thought it would have been helpful to know how long I would have to mix the top layer before it got "fluffy".  Mine never seemed to get to that point, but it still tasted great!  I also had to bake it longer than the recipe said--more like 1 hour.  I took this dessert to two different gatherings and got compliments both places!  Thanks, Lana.

Thanks, Lana! I had lost this recipe and you have restored it to me. It is always a big success, because it tastes so rich, people think that you slaved over it. My children have always liked them, even though it is rich and you can't eat much at a time. To my mind, that is an advantage that keeps you from overeating! Thanks again!

Rich!  Kids didn't like them, nor the husband.
