I won't cook veal, so I used chicken instead. Added garlic and onion powders to the flour and used more sherry than suggested. This is a lovely, company worthy dish that my whole family loved. Thanks so much Patti!

While there shouldn't really be any extra oil after flash saut√©ing the full 2 pounds of Veal..... if there is, you can certainly remove it before proceeding.  I also frequently prepare this with thinly sliced or pounded chicken breasts.

My favorite Veal recipe!!... you have to season the meat well before putting on the flour mixture, otherwise the Veal doesn't have a lot of flavor--An all-purpose spice works extremely well!

Great Dish. The only change I made was to deglaze the pan after browning the veal with the 3 Tsp of sherry and use that to prepare the sauce.

Love this recipe.  If you are a cheese lover, this is a must!  Very decadent.  The only thing I would advise is you must use good veal, and if it is too thick, pound it thin.  A keeper for me, thanks!!

This was great but I agree it was a bit oily.  I decreased the olive oil, and did deglaze the pan with the butter, but next time I think I'd drain the excess oil out first.  I also halved the butter, substituted sliced provolone for the mozzarella, and added mushrooms.  Served over rice, and with wilted spinach (cooked in the same frying pan I used after making the sauce, with a little garlic) it was yummy!

I didn't have the veal so I used chicken. When trying to make the sauce, it was way too thick, so I had to add more sherry to try and make it more of a sauce than an odd crust. The problem was, once the meal was done and on my plate, the sherry was too much. Overall, with less sauce, this recipe could be a good one.

I have to say this recipe is far too oily.  I wiped out the pan and cut back on the butter but it is not a healthy recipe and one I would never serve again.  Sorry.

This would have been a whole lot better if the sherry was taken out of the recipe.  I thought I would try one more dish with sherry, but now I know I can't stand the taste of wine in my food.  But, I don't even like wine without it in my food.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever gotten off this site. I prepared it exactly the way the directions were outlined and it was absolutely scrumptious!

LOVE THIS!  Just make sure you don't overlap the veal pieces. That way each piece gets enough sauce and cheese!

Iain's mom loves this receipe.

I cut some of the oil, and since I'm not a fan of wine in my food I only put a small amount of wine, just enough to deglaze, and substituted stock for the rest of the liquid in the sauce. 

Delish!

I found this to be very salty, and very oily!! DO NOT ADD SALT TO THE SAUCE!!! I also threw out the first sauce I made according to the recipe. I used 1/2 the amount of butter added chiken broth and white wine. I would also say to add garlic to the butter for taste. Not something I would make again.

I had trouble making the sauce. It kept coming out too thick and the flour went chunky, so it didn't do anything good for the dish.

Made this recipe twice- once just because my son wanted veal (I know...strange, but his grandmother made it for him!), and it was so good, I made it again for Father's Day. It was a big hit, although there was a bit of a problem the day before. I had ordered Veal Cutlets, but ended up with the patties. There were was no breading on them, and it still turned out good. But I did prefer it with the Cutlets- a little leaner. I served with a green salad, fresh bread, and with angel hair pasta. Very decadent for a special day, and my husband got a break from grilling!!

I thought this was a good recipe, but not a great recipe.  I think I found the cheese a little overwhelming. My husband liked it a lot though and has requested that I make it again.  So I will try it again, adjusting some of the ingredients to my taste.  Thanks.

Decadent is an understatement for this dish.  Taste wise it was great, but I needed CPR after dinner.  If you are on a health kick, make this a once in a blue mooner.  Sherry is such an awesome ingredient though.

This recipe was great!  I didn't have veal so I used pounded chicken and Jack cheese instead of mozzerella.  Turned out great and will try it with veal.  Next time I may add a little bit of broth or something to the sauce.  It sure went great with hot french bread!

This was okay.  Did not like the sauce at all because it was way too buttery but the kids loved all the cheese on the veal.  I thought it took away from the veal. Would probably not make again...Thanks

Tried it and loved it.  I had to try several attempts at the roux otherwise it separated and I had greasy clumps.  Third time was a charm.  Very tasty

This was delicious. Made a couple of changes - veal blade chops instead of cutlets, thick slices of mozzarella instead of shreds, added sliced baby bella mushrooms - and served with some artichokes to dip in the extra butter sauce. So very unhealthy, and not so easy on the budget, but once or twice a year? Oh yeah.

This was very bland.. I do not understand why the recipe does not deglaze the pan, which I did, I also fried some garlic in the butter before browning the veal. I added basil, a little oregano, onion powder, parm cheese and garlic powder... Even with all the added ingredients the dish was still bland. I am sorry, I will not make it again

Wonderful!  Loved the sherry with the veal, and cheese only made it better.  Yum!
