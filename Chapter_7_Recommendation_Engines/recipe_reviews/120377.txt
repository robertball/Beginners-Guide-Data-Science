This soup was incredible! Instead of using regular half and half, I used fat free, and it tasted great!  And, another change I made was to put all the vegetables in the food processor, instead of dicing everything.  My husband thought it was my "finest work ever"!!  I thought so too!  Try this soup, it's amazing!!!

Excellent soup!  I roasted the turkey carcass in the oven for 30-45 minutes at 400 degrees (turning frequently not to burn) before boiling it to give it more flavor.  I also added brown rice (healthier), minced garlic, fat-free half & half, and corn.

I made this soup with a left over breast carcus that I cut filets out of.  I added an additional carrot and used non fat half and half ti lighten the recipe a bit.  I recommend that you make this soup 2 days ahead of time as it gets better by sitting.  Serve with a loaf of hot crusty braed and you have a great cool weather meal.

The BEST Turkey Soup I have ever eaten in my life.  I actually hate turkey soup, but I needed to do something with leftover turkey I had.  So Fixed this one.  I didn't have any half and half so I used get ready Whipping Creme!  If you like Turkey Pot pie, well this is better than that!  My whole family loved loved loved this!  Needed more salt for sure and I did add a pinch of garlic powder, around 1/2 teaspoon, in it as well.  This will be a keeper in my house! Loved it thank you so much for sharing it with all of us!

Excellent soup. I cut way back on the butter, using approx, 2 T, and did not add the flour or the cream (trying to atone for my caloric sins) and it was perfectly fine without.

REALLY EXCELLENT soup!  My husband was kinda "iffy" on it but he's not someone who considers soup to be a meal.  Previous reviewers were right when they say this actually tastes better a day or two after you cook it.  It seems to get thicker and richer.  I don't think I would make this with just turkey stock if I didn't have a turkey carcass to make it with because I think the simmering of the soup with the carcass really makes the flavor of this soup.  This will definitely be a recipe I make after every turkey I cook.  I'm already looking forward to making it again with our Christmas turkey!  Great recipe!

A good recipe.  Not exactly sure how much stock I began with...I had a huge stock pot full to begin with, but ended up with a huge dutch oven full of soup with leftover stock to freeze... I did add one large clove of crushed GARLIC and two BAY LEAVES to the stock.  I cut the butter WAY down to about 3 tablespoons, dissolved 2 bouillion cubes in a cup of water and added it with the flour, to the onion/carrot/celery mixture; used 1/2 of a very large onion; used only 1 cup of fat free half and half;  I did add a bag of frozen vegetables, a small container of leftover STUFFING, (broken up), and used pastina instead of rice; did not include salt in my soup.  Came out exceptionally well.  My husband loved getting the tidbits of stuffing in his soup...and raved about the broth.

This soup is the bomb!  Wow! Just made it today for dinner and it was delicious.  I never usually do anything with my leftovers from Thanksgiving, but this soup gave me an excuse to try.  I followed the suggestions of alot of people and used fat free half and half, and it turned out great.  I also used a can of cream of potato soup to cut down on the amount of flour.  It was amazing! Now I know what I will do with my leftover Christmas turkey.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This not exactly a review...rather a hint...I have made turkey soup for many years and put the carcass in a large square of cheese cloth and tie it up.  So much easier to take it out of the pot and you do not have to strain the broth.  when cool smiply open the cheese cloth and pick through the bones and put the pieces of turkey back into the broth.

i'm not very experienced making soup and I found this pretty easy to prepare.  I used barley instead of rice and cut back a bit on the butter and it turned out quite good.  thanks for sharing.

My whole family was disappointed with this recipe.  I thought it was so blah... maybe too much flour??  (and I even cut it in HALF, along with the butter).  I was so excited to make it, I really had high hopes.  I even added some garlic, and some poultry seasoning in the end to try and liven it up!  We added LOTS of pepper, and still didn't help. Maybe we will try again next year, with some modifications.  :(

This soup tasted very good while it was cooking, but once it was done it was the consistency of tapioca pudding.  1 cup of flour????  I wish i hadn't used ANY flour.  If you are thinking of making this recipe PLEASE read the alterations people have made and follow those.  It seems many of the people who rated this so highly changed up quantities and did some ingredient switching.  I'm disappointed.

Edited 9/25/2019:
I've been making this stew for the last eleven years (holy smokes where has the time gone!) and it is still something my whole family looks forward to anytime I say I'm roasting a turkey.  Since I've had a decade to work out some tips and tricks I want to mention a couple of small improvements I've made.
First, I remove as much of the cooked turkey from the carcass as possible BEFORE I boil it.  I've found that the meat retains much more of its flavor if you don't boil it.  
Second, I boil the carcass for much longer - I give it about two hours (enough for the bones to get soft), then I pull out the large bones and cut/break them to get to the marrow.  Back into the pot and boil the dickens out of them for about another hour.  It takes longer but oh my goodness the flavor cannot be beat.
Third, I never seem to add enough salt to this recipe.  I've got a note on the recipe to up the salt to two tablespoons and I don't even recall now if that is enough.
Fourth, I've gotten to where I now saute the onions with a few cloves of garlic in butter until nice and browned before adding it to the mix.  I have also, on occasion, added a can or two of sundried tomatoes to the pot.  It's a nice difference but not for everyone.  And it turns the stew pink.  
Anyway, I only got on here to get the ingredients so I can buy them and make my stew!  Pictures coming soon.

I made this soup last year out of our leftover Christmas turkey and never did review it.  Well, i

Excellent soup - Used only 1 stick of butter and a little more than 1/2 cup of flour.  I boiled 2 diced potatoes and 1 cup of rice separately and added after soup had cooled down.  This way you end up with soup instead of goop.

This recipe is great but extremely caloric. By making the following changes, I saved the whole pot 1887 calories, or about 118 calories per serving. Instead of 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of butter, I used 1/2 cup of flour, 2T of butter, and 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Potato Soup. Instead of 2 cups of half and half, I used 1 cup of skim milk and 1 cup of fat free half-and-half. Brown rice instead of white rice (but keep in mind that you will have to cook it longer if you do this). Also added some lima beans and green beans, white pepper, thyme, and parsley. Next time I'll cut back on the salt and maybe replace all the half and half with skim.

Excellent, but if you prefer a lighter soup as I do sometimes you can drop all the half & half and the flour...just add 2 cups of water and some parsley and this soup is just as good this way.

Perfect!  I did make several changes though.  After I made the stock, I halved the recipe.  I doubled the carrots, and added some corn, green beans, garlic and sliced leeks.  I also stirred in leftover Thanksgiving day gravy.  I had heavy cream on hand so I didn't add as much as called for.  Also used brown and wild rice.  I seasoned the soup with a little thyme, rosemary, a bay leaf, and just enough lemon juice to brighten the flavors but not to add lemon flavor.  I cut down on the butter as other people mentioned, but I just want to point out that the amount of butter and the amount of flour together are a roux and changing the ratios affects the thickening strength, so you can change accordingly.  This was great, thank you!

I didn't change a thing except using fat free half and half...it was wonderful.  I think next time I will use some wild rice along with the white rice and maybe a little white wine.  We loved the soup in it's original form and it has so much potential to be played with when you have extra ingriedients!  Our house smelled like Thanksgiving all over again!

Really good soup and I would make it again with some tweaks. I found the flour to be way too much. I had cut it down by a few tablespoons but next time would easily cut it in half. I added freshly chopped parsley and corn. Overall a strong recipe but not quite worth 5 stars without some personal touches.

AMAZING!  I have never made a turkey soup/stew before and it was SO easy!  I like thick, creamy soups and this was excellent!  The ONLY thing I added was a few more spices, garlic and some thyme and boiled down my turkey with a bay leaf! This is a keeper for me! Thank you!

YES! Finally a delicious and SATISFYING turkey soup!I followed the instructions to the letter EXCEPT:

added some leftover fresh cauliflower to the vegies and threw in about 3 handfuls (my hands are small) of uncooked egg noodles instead of the rice. Only had to simmer it about 10 minutes to cook the noodles.

I like my turkey soup to be more brothy so I do not use flour or cream in my turkey soup.  I also use a couple of packages of Uncle Ben's original wild rice instead of regular long grain rice and I add fresh mushrooms.

Yummy! Tastes sort of like the inside of a turkey pot pie. I used olive oil (instead of butter), 2 Tbsp of flour, 1 cup rice, and 4 cups turkey broth and 4 cups vegetable broth.

Only change I'd make is put less flour in. It was a bit pasty flavored and I had to add some backup broth. All around YUM though.  I also dumped in the leftover Awesome Sausage Apple and Cranberry stuffing from this site. Believe it or not, apples and cranberries in this soup are pretty good!

This soup was delicious. I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I changed a few things. I didn't have carrots, so I added potatoes. The potatoes were perfect, but I'll definitely add carrots next time also. I used whole milk instead of half & half. I also didn't add the remaining broth, I added maybe 3/4-1 C. of remaining broth, but I like my soups a little thicker. And instead of rice I added noodles. If you have leftover turkey, try this soup for sure. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This was my first turkey soup from scratch. This is a great recipe and it came out great. I left out the cream. Tastes great without it.

Made this a couple times and really loved it.  Added a little cheddar cheese to it once and it was a nice compliment.  Also added it to a pie crust and served it like a pot pie.  EXCELLENT.

Soooo comforting and satisfying!  This is a new after-thanksgiving tradition in our house.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Make sure to stir the soup quite often though, as the rice has a tendency to stick to the bottom.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars simply for the idea alone!  I make chicken stock all of the time out of the carcasses from the rotiseirrie chickens that I buy from the store.  I made the turkey stock yesterday and today I started the soup with the Cream Soup Base Recipe found on this website.   I also added some leftover gravy as opposed to the bouillon granules.  I also added garlic granules for some flavor, although my family seem to think it was missing something probably the salt!  I don't use a lot of it.  I thought it had great flavor just from the stock and the gravy.  I also used brown long grain rice, which was great!  Thank you for this wonderful idea.  I have been discarding turkey carcasses for over 15 years and I am so sorry that I have!

So good! I actually didn't use any cream, flour or butter. Instead, I added a cup of leftover mashed potatoes to the soup to thicken it up. And of course added extra veggies! The turkey carcass is what gives this soup great flavor.

I will tell you first that the soup is very tasty, but it is awfully thick. Half the flour, half the rice, and half the cream would have been sufficient for a nice creamy soup. As it is it is a bit gelatinous. I would also adjust the instructions since it says set 3 quarts of broth aside, but then fails to explain that all 3 are to be used, but added in gradually to the other ingredients. As an experienced cook, I filled in the blanks, but it is easily confusing.

We added bacon and garlic to our soup and reduced some of the liquid so that the soup was thickened by the rice. Delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written (as people really should do if they are going to rate, otherwise you're rating your own recipe not the posted one).  This soup is absolutely delicious! Whether or not to use the amount of butter listed is mostly a matter of taste and diet preference. Remember though, the butter+flour is part of what makes this so thick and creamy.

I only gave this recipe four stars because I agree with some other cooks on the following changes:

* use 1/2 of the flour called for
* use 1/2 of the butter called for
* add other spices to it like thyme and sage.

With the changes I made my whole family LOVED it. This is a good recipe and deserves four or five stars.  I just did not want to have a "chowder" and adjusted the amount of flour called for.  Try this recipe, you'll probably love it too.

We all loved this soup.  You can make it anytime by using 3 cartons of chicken broth and a bit of leftover turkey or chicken  instead of needing a turkey carcass, it is just as good.

This was excellent.  I didn't add rice or noodles or even the flour.  My 19 month old who tends to be fussy loved it, so did my husband.  I didn't have half and half, so I used whippping cream.  It was amazing!  I also added thyme and bay leaf to the boiling water, and used sea salt.  I also added a can of corn.  Yum, will make again.

Served this to 10 people tonight and everyone was pleased with this soup. Made it as the recipe was written with the exception I ended up with 4 qts. of broth. I added an extra 1/2c of rice to offset the extra qt of broth. If you make this up more than an hour before it is to be served, hold off on adding the rice until about an hour before the soup is to be served so the rice doesn't get too mushy. Truly a great tasting soup and was served with Mama D's Italian bread sliced and toasted with garlic and butter! Mmmmm!

This was wonderful! First, I broke up the carcass into big pieces and roasted in the oven at 350 for about 1 1/2 hours turning occasionally.  Once the carcass was cool enough to touch, I broke it up even more and put it into a large stock pot.  Next, I covered the carcass with water (about 2-3 inches above the carcass), and added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and let sit for an hour. ( The apple cider vinegar pulls out more nutrients and flavor from the bones).  I Then added carrots, celery, onion, and a few fresh herbs (Thyme, Rosemary, Parsley) and let the carcass simmer covered on med/low heat all night.  By morning I had a rich, savory broth. I filtered the broth through a fine mesh strainer.  I picked all the meat off the bones and reserved both the cooled broth and turkey in the fridge.  Later I made the soup with the reserved broth and meat following the recipe almost exactly.  I used Wild rice from Trader Joes and added two cups organic mixed cut veggies (carrots, corn, green beans) along with the fresh ones in the recipe.  Awesome!

To me, a good turkey soup starts with a good turkey. We made the Perfect Turkey from this site, and the drippings were so incredible. What we didn't use for the gravy on Thanksgiving, we saved and added it to the stock that this recipe made. We had some dark meat leftover also that we chopped up and added, since the carcass was pretty much picked clean when we started. SUCH a good soup -- hearty with lots of flavor! I've never had such a good turkey soup. We will be making this every year!

Using the turkey carcass I made a stock the day before, adding bay leaves, peppercorns, onion, carrot, garlic, celery and salt.  I strained it and picked the bones clean, throwing away all the other stuff.  I followed the instructions of sauteing onion, celery and carrot but with only 2T butter then I poured in my stock; I added diced potatoes instead of the rice, simmered until they were tender.  Added some fresh parsley since it needed some color.  Thickened with cornstarch and cream mixture... :)

This soup is very very good.  Been making it for a few years now after Thanksgiving so  I thought it was time to write a review.  The carcass has to be cut up to fit in my dutch oven.  I followed the suggestions of others and used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons.  Also used something less then a whole cup of flour, maybe about 3/4 cup.  The taste and consistancy of the broth was wonderful and the seasonings are just right.  Thanks so much!!

Very enjoyable soup. I picked all the good leftover meat off the turkey before I put the carcass in the pot. This is my least favourite part of any turkey meal but having this soup as the end result was worth it. I followed the directions and found the consistancy just right.The amount of carrots and celery were good and although I thought that 3 onions might have been to much, it wasn't at all. I may try adding egg noodles instead of rice next time but that is just personal preference. This makes lots so I plan to freeze some to enjoy over the cold winter. Thanks so much.

This turkey soup is fabulous! I had never made turkey soup from the carcass before.  We had turkey noodle soup from the carcass as kids, but this cream soup is so much better. I didn't change a thing! Thank you Valorie for sharing!

This is our family's absolute favorite soup.  It's so good, that I am now that odd daughter-in-law who asks to take home the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving dinner!  We even buy whole chickens that we roast rather than chicken breasts or drumsticks, just so we can make this soup.  It's super creamy, rich and so flavorful!  The directions are also very easy to follow.

With the extra turkey or chicken stock, I make another soup, usually vegetable soup.  I put a bunch of peeled and roughly cut veggies into a big stock pot and cover with the broth.  After bringing to a boil, I simmer for about an hour, with seasonnings.  I then use an immersion blender to puree the whole thing, and add cream or milk until I get the desired consistency.  Works great with a selection of veggies like potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, pumpkin, etc.  Give it a try :o)

We always make Turkey Soup after thanksgiving, but it's really...regular.  This is still traditional tasting, but has so much fullness (I think it's the butter).  We added broccoli and spinach for more iron.
It's a new family tradition!

Delicious soup recipe!! Easy to follow and it was delicious. I altered the recipe, like I always do. I didnt add as much onion and I used half evaporated milk and the rest half and half. My husband just loved the flavor and we had it for about three nights straight. Awesome recipe, look forward to doing this recipe again next year.

This is a nice change from your 'regular' leftover turkey soup.  As someone else has mentioned, do not add the 1/2 and 1/2 until after your rice has cooked for a while.  You do not want to boil this soup after you add it.  I made that mistake (because I was making it in a rush), but I knew right away afterward!  I took it off the stove and the next day left it in the crock pot all day on low and the rice cooked and it was perfect. Oh, I also threw in about a 1/4 cup of cooking sherry!

This is delicious soup! I took the advice of reviewers and used half the butter, half the flour, a rosemary sprig and bay leaf in the stock,  and twice the vegetables (half to make the stock the other half to add texture to the soup). Fantastic!

this soup is awesome!  i didnt add the boullion but it didnt matter, i added some herbs and salt and pepper and it was amazing.  i like chunks of carrot, but not chunks of onion or celery, so i sauteed the onion and celery seperately and then pureed that.  i sauteed the carrots, added the pureed onion and celery, and then added the flour and broth.  i also used jasmine rice instead of long grain and it still came out great.  after regrigerating, it does get very thick, but once its reheated its back to its creamy delicious texture again.  
the only negative is that it took forever to pick all the little bones out of the meat that fell off the carcass.  anyone have an easier way to do this?

great recipe - will be a new thanksgiving tradition!

I've never considered cream in my turkey soup before. I decided to give this recipe a try and what a pleasant surprise! It was delicious. The flavor is worth the extra calories from the half and half.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  The only things I did differently was to throw in some corn left over from Thanksgiving dinner and change the chicken bouillon granules to two vegetable bouillon cubes crushed.  Big hit with my husband!

Uh....delicious. I feel this could work with any kind of poultry, or even other meats if you have bones and feel adventurous. Make the broth think enough and you could easily turn it into pie filling. So versatile!

This soup is a definite keeper. It's a nice change from the usual brothy version. The addition of the butter and flour makes it a very rich but not overpowering texture and taste. My family loved it! You do have to use butter, though, not margarine.

I have made this soup several times and it is always a hit at our house. We don't wait until Thanksgiving to make it. I like to cut this recipe in half and use broth made from boiling the bones of a deli rotisserie chicken. Yummy!

I adapted a turkey soup recipe that I had made from a carcass the day before, to make this cream of turkey soup.  I sauteed mushrooms in the butter (the soup on-hand had the other veges already), added the flour as directed, then the cream and my original broth/veges/noodles soup.  It was fabulous and a nice way to have a change from the original.  Hubby loved it!

Great recipe.  Have made it four times now, each time trying something a little different.  My last go I think I got it.  The original recipe is great, so thank you for sharing. We used this recipe with a whole chicken as well.  Tastes just as good. 
-I use a food processor for the vegetables
-Also add a can of sweet corn and 10 oz baby Bella mushrooms

Enjoy and thanks again for sharing the recipe.

I think this recipe needs some spices for better flavor. I ended up adding some thyme, parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic powder, and sage. I also used up some leftover mashed potatoes to thicken the stock - worked beautifully. I used half of the butter/flour amounts and just thickened some of the stock with the mashed potatoes in the blender and threw it in the pot with everything else. Worked out great!

This soup was good, but I agree it was too bland.  Also, it would have been helpful to put the 3 quarts of broth as a note into the ingredients, as I halved this recipe (under "calculate servings"), but it, and I didn't half the broth.  I had to make up the difference with the full ingredients.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I messed mine up by using too much turkey stock (I had had to use too much water to cover my bird). So mine never thickened up like it should. But I've made soups like this before, & I know that there's nothing wrong with the method here, so 5 stars. If you wish to use brown rice, you'll just have to cook the soup longer, or pre-cook it before you add it in. Add your cream at the very last so it doesn't burn or curdle while the rest of your soup is boiling. I personally used more veggies than called for, because I like them, and like any soup, you can adjust those to your taste. This soup may require more salt for some tastes or depending on your stock. We liked this, it makes a very generous amount, thanks for posting! EDIT 12/4/10: Made this soup again this year and used the correct amounts of liquids this time -- it still didn't thicken like the pictures show. Maybe because I'm using brown rice? Still 5 stars!

5 stars with the following small changes: reduce to 1/2 c flour and 1/4c butter. Used skim milk instead of cream or 1/2&1/2...and it came out just fine! I also used brown rice instead of white. Added more celery, carrots, mushrooms. Added extra turkey than what I took off the frame. I thought It turned out to be an excellent soup, and even low fat with the above changes. Yum.

This was an awesome soup.  I did not use fat free half and half and it was so creamy.  I also did not add celery since my son doesn't like it, but it turned out just great.  I also added a 1/2 cup more of rice - it just seem to need more rice.  My family thought this was a great soup.  Even my son, who isn't a big fan of soups, loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe - this one is definitely a keeper.

This is a terrific base recipe that can be tweaked in many ways in order to suit a variety of tastes.  It was my first time making turkey soup and I really enjoyed it.  I used this recipe as a reference and then modified it to suit my own tastes.  I scaled the recipe down a little, cut down on the butter and flour, reduced the amount of rice, replaced the half and half with cream, and added about 2 tsp. of salt.  Other than modifying the amount of the ingredients used, I didn't try to deviate from the original ingredients.  The soup had a great comfort-food sort of taste, similar to pot-pie filling.  I think I may omit the rice next time.  My sister commented that it gave the soup the consistency of rice porridge.  It didn't hurt the taste, however.  Another bonus to this recipe is that while cooking, it fills the house with the lovely aroma of roasting turkey.  Yummy!

I used the turkey dripping plus some extra broth, but the soup came out so oily and salty.  I actually had to throw it out...you may need to make some modification for it to come out well.  Best of luck!

This was really good.  It tasted like the filling of a turkey pot pie.  I made this a few days after Thanksgiving so I didn't have the turkey carcass lying around so I used chicken broth out of a can.  I halved the recipe and used 2 cans of chicken broth plus one cup of water with a chicken boullion cube.  Added some leftover corn and this was delicious.  Thanks for a great way to use up all that turkey!

This is a terrific (if not the healthiest soup option...) recipe!  I didn't measure out any liquid from what I used to get the turkey meat off the bones.  I just added more brown rice to soak up the extra liquid.  There were onions from the cooked turkey already, and I only had one in the fridge, so one onion, only a few baby carrots (not a huge fan of carrots - makes soups too sweet for me), 2 cups brown rice, 1/2 a bag of frozen peas, and 1/2 a bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  1 can of condensed milk.  I used a vegetable flavor cube (didn't have granules), quite a bit of black pepper, a 'southern style blend' spice mix and another garlic-based spice blend (didn't have any poultry spice or celery salt) and used quite a bit of Beau Monde Seasoning.  I  put what I had left of the stuffing in there (about 1 cup), and didn't put a whole lot of salt -- better under salted for folks to add their own is my soup-making motto. I let it cook and simmer all day -- and YUMMY!! DH tasted it and thought it was good, and he's really picky.  Thank You For this different take on a favorite Holiday Leftover!!

I made this today with my leftover carcass.  My initial concern was that the recipe does not say what size carcass it was based on.  I made it with the carcass of a 10 lb turkey.  The initial bowl that I tried had plenty of turkey in it.  I hope that the last bowl does as well.  My second reaction was that it called for a LOT of butter.  It might be good with less, but the taste was great as made.  I ended up adding broth with the flour because the roue became too thick.  That worked well.  This soup was too bland, but better to "season to taste" than to make something too salty or peppery.  It is easier to add spices than to remove them.  I will be playing around with spices for this.  Perhaps a bay leaf and some oregano or herbs de provence or poultry seasoning.  Something...  Overall, I like it.

made this last night since I was looking for a new use for the turkey carcass, other than the same old turkey noodle soup.  This recipe is delicious, but I used a slightly different technique.  After cooking/draining the carcass, I put all of the vegetables and rice in the broth and let them cook.  When done, I added back in the turkey, a can of cream of chicken soup, and about 1/4 cup of gravy flour mixed in with water to thicken.  Oh, and I put in a bay leaf when I'm cooking the carcass.  This recipe has now replaced the old turkey noodle soup one.  Very delicious!

The first time I tried this recipe, I made it as written.  Very tasty!  I brought the left overs to the deer lease and all of the hungry hunters gobbled  it up(excuse the pun).  I made it again this weekend and used a ham bone instead of turkey carcus.  I added more salt, corn and red pepper flakes.  Oh so good too!!

THIS SOUP IS SOO GOOD

I took it to work and as I was heating it up a coworker asked me if she could have some...She ended up eating half of my soup.  When it's time for the Easter Potluck, I've already been asked to bring in this soup.

I have made a version of this soup for 26 years and have loved it. We had a half cup of green and black olives. I also use a can of fat free evaporated milk instead of the cream.

OMG!!! excellent recipe!! very simple and tasty. i made a few adjustments. i added 2 cans of mixed vegatables to boost the veggies and i also boosted the seasoning it was a little bland at first. if i chose to use rice again i will cook it by itself before i added it into the soup it takes WAY too long otherwise but i think i'll be definetly be using noodles from now on. i made some pillsbury grand's biscuits to go with it and it was awesome!!

This soup was fabulous!  I did use low sodium chicken stock as I didn't have the carcass to make my own. I also cut the butter in 1/2, added chopped thyme and sage to the celery/onion/carrots, and used brown rice instead of white. My whole family loved this soup (including one picky eater) and I definitely will be making it again!

This was very good.  I didn't saute the vegetables in the butter.  I just put them in the broth and let them cook that way.  Next time I am going to add some fresh herbs.  And here I always through the carcus away.  Little did I know what wonderful soup it would make.

The only changes I made were to use 2% milk, blended the carrots, potatoes, rutabaga and onions just a bit. Followed the recipe for the rest. It is superb. Best turkey soup I ever tasted. Actually, best soup I ever tasted. Can't wait to share with friends.

Very nice and Very easy!  I didn't have any bones, etc. to boil make broth so i used 2.5 - 3Qts water, one 10oz can of chicken broth, 10oz can of Turkey gravy and chicken stock mix to taste, and it has turned out great!  I'll definitely be making this every year.

This is the second time I've made this recipe, and I'll continue to make it every time we have a turkey.  The first, time I made it as written, and it was awesome.  The second time, I used fat free half and half, only 1 onion, just a tiny bit of celery, and 1 clove of garlic.  It turned out even more awesome.  

This recipe is even better as leftovers, and is able to be enjoyed for several days afterwards.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a filling, delicious way to use their turkey leftovers.  YUM!

I left out the half and half and the rice.  The soup is flavorful without it.  I did add some poultry seasoning.  Great starting point to add extra stuff if you want.

Incredible!!!  I was going to share this with a friend, but I think my family would get mad.  I put in extra veggie and think I'll try potatoes the next time.  I did step 3 in a crock pot as suggested, but the rice gathered together and was clumpy.  We still loved it! ********update*****december 2007
Was going to try this with fat-free half and half, but read the ingredients.  It's full of corn syrup and chemicals, so I went with the real half and half again.

This really was fantastic and EASY!  I added double celery and carrot and another 1/2 cup of rice (Royal rice blend).  My husband literally raved all night and made me freeze all the extra in small containers so he can take to work.  I'd give it 6* if possible!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I didn't need to add any spices as I used the herbed turkey recpie from this site as my holiday turkey.  I also added some cut up white potatoes which added to the heartyness.  Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic turkey soup recipe. If you like Byerly's wild rice turkey soup--this is a close second if you add slivered almonds to the recipe. I would also suggest reducing the number of onions to 1 1/2 or 2 at the most and adding some garlic. Yum. My father, husband and two year old son all loved it.

This was a nice creamy change to a traditional turkey soup.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and adapted it beause I didn't boil down the carcass.  Even cutting it down by 1/2 made more than enough for my family of five.  Definately a "comfort food" soup!

We added corn, it was great! We also substituted low fat milk for the half and half to make more healthy. This will be a new tradition.

I made the broth using legs from a wild turkey, and then I chopped up some of the breast (which we had smoked) and added it to the soup. I added garlic nd cut the butter and flour back by 1/4 cup each, and I also added a 10 oz bag of frozen peas. Without them, I think the soup would have been rather one dimensional. It had a nice flavor, but if I were to make it again, I would do a bit more tweaking (add more carrots and maybe some mushrooms, etc).

I chose to make this because I had most of the stuff on hand. I didn't have half and half and chose to use evaporated milk, this was quite tasty and I like that I can adjust it the next time I make it to my families preference. It was tasty and good use of leftovers!

This is not only the best turkey soup I have ever had, it is the best soup I have ever had. My first taste I thought it needed something. I added my leftover gravy and it instantly transformed it to a 6 star recipe. Now when I make it, I just toss in anything I have leftover from Thanksgiving: cream corn, stuffing, green beans. This is a can't miss recipe. My roommate is a soup connoisseur and he said it was the best soup he's ever had. He begs me to make it for him.

Love this recipe -- nice and stew/soup thickness with great flavors.  As many others did, a few small tweaks -- but the base recipe stand solid and worthy of becoming a part of any family meal rotation.

I had the turkey leftover, but had already used the stock (was a gigantic bird). I used plain ol' chicken broth and it turned out AMAZING!! I am, by no means, a fantastic cook and sometimes I struggle with following directions... Great recipe - thanks SO much for sharing!

This soup is excellent.  It is the first time I have tried a "cream" turkey soup and other than adding a little minced garlic and fresh rosemary, I changed nothing.  A real keeper

We thought this was good but lacked a little flavor. Will add more flavorings (poultry seasoning or more salt) next time.

Best turkey recipe EVER!!  I renamed it Turkey Stew. I cooked the whole carrots, celery and onions with the carcass then snipped the carrots and celery into the soup with a small handfull of dried minced onions.

I read a review that said if you like turkey pot pie you will love this...that is because it is very similar to that. I would actually call this cream of turkey soup. It would be excellent served in a bread bowl like clam chowder. I stuck to the recipe verbatim, except I needed to add a little salt. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was hands down one of the best soups I've ever had.  The only change I made (out of necessity) was to use soy milk for the dairy product.  I bought another turkey just so I could make this soup again!!  The whole family loved this, it will be a repeat throughout the winter for sure.

Excellent!!  My family loved it....eventhe teenager.  Great taste and texture.  I added some left over corn and a bit of montreal chicken seasoning.  I also added dried parsley to add to the visual appeal.  This soup is hardy and sooooo good!

Delicious! Very thick, rich and filling soup-- I can't decide whether it reminds me more of chicken pot pie or chicken and dumplings (both of my favorites).  I used turkey stock that I made on my own and left out the chicken bouillon.  Next time, I think I will leave out some, if not all, of the flour to make it a bit thinner.  Oh and I had run out of celery, so I substituted celery seed.

This was fabulous! I had two minor variations - I added a pint of tomato stock I had after canning all those tomatos this past summer and I used 1% milk instead of half-n-half.  Excellent soup, the family loved it.

If you are willing to take the time this soup is absolutely worth it.  I gave a huge bowl away to two luck folks and still had a pot in the fridge and one in the freezer for later.  I made no changes to the recipe and I can't express how delicious it was.  We served it over warm biscuits as it has a great stew quality to it.   Absolutely fantastic!!!

This was one of the best soups I've ever made!  The only addition was to put some chicken paste seasoning (it's in a jar by soup stock) in with turkey carcass and towards the end I stirred in some leftover mashed potatoes which was creamy and goooooooood!  Very filling too!

This soup was excellent.  Only used one onion and fat free half and half and didn't change anything else.  It was also easy to make.  Will make it again the next time I have turkey.  Might try this recipe using chicken.

really good! my only complaint would be that as the soup cools off, it got a little curdled looking...possibly I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe.  However, regardless of that fact, the taste was really good and not at all like a typical soup that I would normally make.  My kids and my husband all loved it.

Our family absolutely loves this recipe...it's our favorite by far of all the turkey soup recipes I've tried.  In fact, thinking about it, I want to make it right now!!  I used only 1C of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 C of milk, didn't have any celery either time I made it, and used barley instead of rice.  Barley is so nutritious and great in this soup.  Also, I really cut down on the amount of butter as suggested by another post.  Even still, 1C of 1/2 and 1/2 and barely any butter and this s a delicious, rich soup.  Try it, you'll like it....really.

Turned out fantastically.  I used Potato Flour and heavy whipping cream as an alternative...  And added Semmelknoedle (bavarian bread dumplings) which a recipe also available on allrecipes.  Was a great combo, will definitely make again next year!

Very, very good soup! I was out of chicken bouillion powder, so I just skipped it....was still yummy! I also added some frozen peas and mushrooms, and a little garlic powder. Reviewers are right....like the inside of a pot pie!

I have to make this every year....I look forward to it almost more than the turkey itself! It has become our new tradition making this soup. I don't really change anything about this recipe except I may add some corn to it, but that's it. I love love love this soup!!!

I really liked this.  I was looking for a soup to make with  my turkey stock and this was perfect.  I already had the stock from thanksgiving so I skipped the first couple steps but it turned out great.  I also agree with the other reviewers that it is even better the next day.  It thickens up and is delicious.

YUM, YUM and YUM with plenty leftover to out in a pie. Because I did not keep the carcass to boil done into broth. I used 3 cans of Turkey Broth - whiched equaled 6 cups. It just seemed 3 quarts was to much. A definate keeper. Already placed in permanent recipe box.

Excellent soup. This was the yum. Plus, I felt so practical using up my turkey carcass instead of throwing it away like I usually do! Really rich and hearty soup.

i love this soup...instead using of half and half cream, i used 1 cup fresh milk. and 1/3 flour, it turns out so creamy and my husband and my 20months old daughter loves it. I put a little bit of italian seasoning , pepper and salt , 1 chicken cubes while boiling the turkey... and put hard boiled eggs on top of the soup.

This is mug your grandmother good. I followed the outline of this recipe, but I needed to clean the fridge from fattening foods. So instead of cream I used a 1/4 of an industrial size tub of real sour cream, instead of butter and boullion I used leftover homemade turkey gravy, and I also added a fresh diced red bell pepper and some sliced leftover cocktail wienies which made up for the fact that I only had basmati rice instead of wild rice. Super yummy.

this was SO good, couldn't believe all the turkey that I got off the bones.  Followed exactly but used light margarine and half and half and milk.  Makes a ton which is great with us!

My husband is NOT a soup person, and doesn't usually have more than 1 serving of the soups that I make, but after tasting this last night, he told me not to bother freezing the leftovers because he planned on eating it for the next week or two. It had a great taste to it, and the creamy texture really made it pleasurable. Other than adding a lot of leftover turkey and a touch of garlic powder, I made it exactly as written and will definitely keep this recipe for future Thanksgivings. Delicious.

OMG!  It ought to be called "Death By Turkey Soup"; it's so rich, creamy & full of flavor!  This is the first time I've made homemade turkey soup. I made this last night out of the turkey carcass from our Thanksgiving turkey.  I'm going to share it with some friends because I could eat this everyday until it's gone.  Total comfort food - right here.  I added some chopped zucchini (just to give it some color contrast) and basmati rice.  I'm adding it to my recipe box - it's a keeper.

This is an excellent soup. I made this for 10 servings. Had about 3 cups shredded turkey. I did not use carrots so I used 2 stalks of celery and one huge sweet onion. I used 1 cup of butter(2 sticks). Which was good because if I had used the amount called for there would have been way to much flour to make a paste. I didn't use rice this time,but will try wild rice at another time. I used a total of aprox. 5 cups of turkey broth. I used 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 1/2 evaporated milk. I didn't use salt because my broth was plenty salty and buttery because that is how I prepare my turkeys. I didn't use the chicken granules. I eyeballed the pepper. This soup is the ultimate!!!! It was very fast to prepare because I already had my turkey off the bone and in the fridge.We will also try it with chicken and will use the chicken granules. try this anytime during the winter. It is the bomb. thanks so much for sharing.    We had to have this soup again. This time we made the 16 servings because there just wasn't enough for left overs.I have found that 4 heaping cups of torn turkey is a good amount for the 16 servings. I still didn't add the carrots so I added extra celery and onion to take the place. I used 2 cups of butter to work well with the cup of flour!!! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh my goodness this was delicious!  I would give it a 10 stars if I could.  I didn't even use half and half but instead used skim milk and it still turned out fabulous!  I will use this recipe for years to come whenever I make turkey.  Thank you for the awesome recipe, Val!

My husband and I really liked this. There wasn't much meat at all left on my turkey, but it still worked. I didn't give it five stars only because I don't like how thick it was. I thinned it with extra chicken broth and next time I will cut down on the butter and flour significantly.

The only changes I made to this recipe was cutting the butter in half, and using whole milk instead of half & half.  The soup came out very, very thick - I added extra broth to try to thin it down.  There was also not much flavor - very bland.  It just didn't seem like soup to me - it looked like a chowder, but didn't have the flavor of a chowder.  I won't make this again.

This was amazing!  I was always scared of carcass soups, but when it's this good, who cares how weird or scary it is!  I followed the advice of some reviews and cut down the butter.

1 cup of flour is way too much for this recipe....1/2 cup is more than sufficient.  I used the 1 cup and the consistency is more like stew than soup.    Flavor wise, very good.  I didn't add the half and half.

My family loved this.  I did a bunch of cooking in one day, so we ate this the second day.  Most soups taste better the second day.  I didn't use as much butter and substituted a little olive oil for the butter too.  I also used 1/2 brown rice and you couldn't tell the difference.  Make sure you add enough bullion and pepper and the flavor will be great.  Also added garlic to the initial veggies.  My kids like the veggies chopped fine so I use a food processor for all of them.  Kind of weird when you mix in the flour, but it all works out.  You may need to add more stock if it's too thick, but if you have a big turkey carcuss and a large pot you can make a lot, just don't use it all for this recipe.  Save some for a second batch.  The soup freezes great too!

A delicious way to finish off those Thanksgiving leftovers.  Very tasty.  A nice alternative to the usual broth soups.  The only change I would make is to add a little more rice next time.  But otherwise, this soup is wonderful!

This was fabulous! Great use for too much turkey after Thanksgiving. I didn't have a carcass, so I just used chicken stock. I used one sweet and one yellow onion, 4 staulks of celery, 4 carrots and a rutabaga. The rutabaga added a nice flavor and color to the soup. I processed them in the food processor and this made them a nice size. I mixed heavy cream and 1% milk because that's what I had and it turned out well. I used reduced sodium stock and only added a tsp of salt, that way you can add more if you want it. It is very good and I may cook a turkey again soon, just to make this recipe again! It makes a ton!!!

YUM! I didn't have a turkey carcass, so I used a whole chicken. Also used bulgar instead of rice (personal preference), and added in more half and half just because I wanted to use up the bottle. Delicious! I ate two bowls. It does make a lot, so I froze about half of it.  I can also see making this with leftover chicken and store-bought broth.

Wow... really good!  I normally run away from "turkey soup" because usually it is a weak turkey-noodle soup that I'd rather skip dinner than eat.  But this is SO good!  I couldn't even wait for the rice to finish cooking before I was dipping french bread in the soup to taste.  I will be making this a lot!  We no longer had our turkey carcass, so I just through some of our leftover turkey meat in some chicken broth and went from there.  I also didn't have any bouillon, so just added about a half teaspoon of poultry seasoning in instead.  Loved it... eating it right now!

Good base recipe, but I had to make a lot of changes. This recipe has a high rating, but if you'll notice lots of the 5 star ratings include many additions - read them! 1) Simmering the turkey in just water isn't enough, it needs seasoning. I tossed in some white wine and lots of chicken broth. I sauteed some garlic and onion and tossed that in; as well as rosemary, sage, thyme, parsley, and oregano. I was afraid to over-season, but I could have seasoned more and it would have been better. 2) The original recipe calls for WAY too much butter and flour. I used a tiny amount of light butter, and maybe a tablespoon of flour, if that. I used fewer than 2 cups of fat free half and half, I think 2 cups is too much. 3) I cooked the rice separately to the consistency I wanted then dumped it in, rather than letting it cook in the soup. 4) I chopped my veggies finely in the food processor and added some garlic. I think that worked better than big chunks. 5) I tossed in some stuffing crumbles - why not? It added some flavor and a little thickness. Overall, this has a lot of potential, but definitely needs some tweaking to be really good. Don't be afraid to generously season. Even with all I added, I could have added more and the flavor would have improved. It does taste better the 2nd day because the flavors have meshed a bit better. I'll try this again, maybe with some chicken and some extra seasoning. Definitely not a lost cause!

This was excellent.  I only used half the butter and half the cream (but used the same amount of flour).  If I had thought about it ahead of time, i would had used condensed milk instead of the half and half.  I also used brown rice and served with whole wheat Italian bread.  Delicious!

Excellent, creamy, post-thanksgiving problem-solver! I'd even rate it over my dad's version, but don't tell him I said that. Tip: try adding rosemary and sage to the carrot/onion/celery mix, and substitute lentils for rice! Makes for a slightly healthier option, and delicious to boot. Thanks for sharing!

I have to say I am not really a soup lover, but this recipe changed my mind. Very good soup, the only change I made was to use orzo instead of rice. Even my picky son liked it.

Whoever submitted this deserves a big pat on the back.  Don't go by the awful picture shown, because this soup is a real show stopper.  The only thing I change is adding more chicken bouillion and other seasonings to taste.  I also add fresh rosemary and I think that really sets it apart from the ordinary.  I know your tired after cooking Thanksgiving dinner, but believe me this one is totaly worth it.  This freezes well if you are not able to eat all after it is made.

Good stuff.  I used a LOT of turkey to use up leftovers...  Nice flavor and color, a little bland for our tastes.  Lots of salt and pepper seemed to do the trick.

This soup was great! Easy to make and everyone loved it. I did use fat free Half and Half to cut down on the calories. When I make it again I will cut back on the butter, as 1 cup was not really necessary.

This was the best Turkey soup EVER!  I followed it exactly except added two large onions instead of 3 small onions.  I found that I had to add chicken broth to it the next day because it was too thick after sitting in the fridge overnight but tasted just as good.  Even my picky 7 year old loved it.

Excellent recipe!! I followed it almost exactly...used fat free half and half. Wish there was the nutritional chart for this recipe - well, then again, maybe not - what with all the butter, etc. I just may not want to know!!!

My family loves this soup! We have made it three years in a row now. The only thing I do differently is to ad a bit less flour and I use a Greek seasoning. We like our soup very well seasoned. An excellent way for us to use the dark meat we usually don't enjoy!

Was just ok, it lacked flavor, I tried to add more bouillon, and pepper, and also some thyme and dried garlic. Still missing some kick. But a pretty good soup.

Delicious!  I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning and increased the salt & pepper by 1/4tsp each.  I also added noodles instead of rice.  Good with dumplings!

LOVE this soup, I shared the recipe with everyone! Substituted cream of mushroom soup for most of the half N half, and added some roasted garlic (both additions were leftovers from the other Thanksgiving dishes I prepared. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good. It did make a lot of soup, so it took about six days for the three of us to finish the pot, but it was good. I added lots of extra kosher salt (it needed it), I only used around 2 TBS butter, I omitted the flour and used potato flakes to thicken it up, and I used around 2 cups of uncooked bow ties in place of rice. It was so yummy, especially with a spoonful of sour cream mixed in! Thanks for sharing, Valorie!

This recipe is really good! I haven't made soup before so I'm not an expert but based on other reviewers and what was in my fridge, here's how I altered it: I simmered my turkey carcass with rosemary and thyme for about 5 hours (enhances flavor).  I didn't really want to put rice in it so I roasted a rutabaga at 375 degrees, cut into small cubes (with olive oil, rosemary, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste) until just before it was done.  Set it aside.  I had previously cooked a small pumpkin for something else and probably had about 1/2-2/3 cup remaining, so I pureed it.  Then cooked the onions, carrots, and celery in about 3-4 T butter with 2 cloves of minced garlic and chopped fresh sage and fresh flat leaf parsley.  Then continued with the original recipe per the instructions, adding the pumpkin and rutabaga with the cream (I used only 1 C half and half and 1 C 1% milk).  My husband and I think this soup is super yummy!!

Restaurant quality! This is THE best! I added a bay leaf when simmering the carcass. Cut the butter in half and added a little olive oil to cook the vegetables (used 1 onion, not 3). Used only 2 quarts of broth instead of 3 (kept the rest for use in other recipes) and added extra seasoning including an extra tsp of salt, thyme, sage. Simmered for several hours using wild rice. Wonderful!

made my turkey broth with onions,carrots and celery and then strained.  cut recipe in 1/2 which still turned out to be alot.  only put 3 tbs butter and a tsp olive oil to cook veggies.  added the salt and pepper plus thyme then.  i used wondra flour which must have kept soup from becoming to thick. we really enjoyed it and my husband said it's a keeper.

Great soup recipe.  I used a little heavy cream and a little nonfat milk instead of half and half.  It needs a little more flavor; and maybe a little more acidity.  Next time, I might add some lemon juice or lemon zest and some more herbs.  But a great start for a great soup!

Great soup! A real hit with my family! To the original turkey stock I added sprigs of fresh sage, parsley, rosemary and added 1 carrot, 1 rib of celery and 1/2 large onion.  And I cheated a little and added a can of cream of chicken soup as I wanted it thicker, as mine seemed a bit thin, but I think that was because I used my mini chopper to chop the vegetables and that created more water in the vegetables/soup.

Fabulous soup! I was looking for a way to make the most of my turkey and found it. I did make some changes to suit us. I only used 1 1/2 onions, about 5 Tbsp. butter, 1/2 c. flour, 2/3 c. rice, added 2 cloves of garlic and about 1/4 tsp. basil. Turned out very well. I only cooked the rice mixture about 20 minutes and that was plenty. I also added the half and half at the end. We were all very pleased with it. I will try the peas next time.

This recipe is great, but I wanted to let you know about a few changes that really added flavor to the soup.  First, I didn't have any half and half ao I put milk in, then as a thickener I added some prepared, leftover mashed potatoes. I also added an 8 oz. bag of cheddar cheese.........delicious!!

I used a turkey carcass that had been slowly smoked over charcoal. I only had 2% milk so in addition to the onion and celery, I added some of my excess green bean casserole and leftover corn. Instead of rice I minced my cornbread dressing and added it to the soup until it reached the desired consistency. Topped with green onions and served with crusty buttered French bread. YUM!

WOw this was surprisingly good.  I used fat free cream and it was just as tasty.  If it looks too thin, don't worry...it thickens as it cooks.  I got worried and added more rice to mine and it came out too thick after that.  Also, top with fresh parsley to make a pretty presentation.

Oh YUM !  This is definitely a keeper - a fine way to use home-made turkey stock and all those little "schnibbles" from the turkey carcass.  Will make this every year!

I love my turkey so am very picky with what I do with the leftovers.  This had  so many good reviews I had to try it.  I changed a lot.  I'm sure it would be very good as written but I just couldn't go for all that butter. (Yes Dr. I am listening.)  I did the carcass and broth a few days ago and let it chill and removed all the fat.  Today I just warmed up the broth, added in the carrots, onion, celery, (didn't saute first) spices, and added a dash of cayenne and a pinch of curry for more depth. I didn't use any butter and used maybe 2-3 T. of Wondra to thicken.  No salt but did use some better than bouillon turkey flavor (No Dr. I'm not totally listening) and used fat free half and half.  Dd does not like cream soups but just ate 2 bowls. The down side is that it's so good you just want another bite, then another, then another. LOL Will look forward to this soup after every turkey.

Great recipe.Had to modify a little as my sister threw out the turkey carcas!I used the legs,wings and a couple tablespoons of leftover fat and pan drippings to make the stock.I also used half rice and half barley and no boullion, used chicken base instead.Other than that I followed it the way it was. Great flavor.Next time I think I'll try it with fat free half and half as others did.I ate so much of this soup I gained a few pounds!Thanks for a great recipe.

This is good but a little TOO thick and buttery for me.  I used 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of flour and I think I could have gone much less.  Maybe 1/4 each. It is definately worth trying again.  Maybe I will give it another shot after Christmas dinner.

Fantastic!  Highly indulgent.  I skipped the chicken boullion, and had cream on hand so I used it in place of half-and-half.  I also pulled the meat off the turkey and continued cooking the carcass over several hours.  This is an unbelievable cream of turkey soup.

Great comfort soup!  I made the broth from leftover fried turkey legs.  I also used low fat half & half and added some great fall spices like rosemary and thyme. I also hadded cubes of sweet potatoes.

Very Very good and tasty!! We will probably opt for less rice the next time around and substitute the long-grain white rice for wild rice or brown rice, but never-the-less the soup was GREAT! and easy to fix.

Very good.  I changed ingredients to 8 servings but used all the turkey carcass.  I added 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/8 tsp all spice, 2-3 drops cayenne pepper.  Did not have cream so used 1/2 cup evaporated milk (left over from another recipe) and 1/2 cup skim milk.  It was a nice change from the usual left over soup recipe.

I have made this soup a few times. It is always good. I follow most of the directions with a few modifications.
I only use 1/2 cup of butter
I add - 1 tsp Thyme, 1 tsp Marjoram, 1.5 tsp Pepper, 2 tsp salt, and 2 tsp curry powder.
I only use one onion.
I saute veggies in butter and then add the rice. Saute till the rice is white. Then I add my seasonings and flour. I let that cook for a few minutes before adding the 1 quart of broth. Then the remaining broth and cream.

Delicious!  I make this every year!  We leave out the celery because we don't like celery.  I always pre-cook the rice because it doesn't get fully cooked in the soup.  This is wonderful and keeps frozen very well!

This is the first time I've made a creamed turkey soup, and it is delicious. I had no chicken bouillon granules, so used a bit more salt instead. I'll be cooking another turkey soon just so I can make this.

Loved this.  Great comfort food and a great way to use up the Thanksgiving turkey. I used turkey stock instead of chicken bouillon, but other than that i made it as written.  I make this every year and it's always a hit.

Made with a couple of changes... 
Used barley instead of rice and because we like spicy I added some red pepper flakes and a bit of salt. Was very yummy but will try it with the rice next time to see if it comes out with a creamier consistency.

I made this recipe 'as written' the first time. It was very good. The 2nd time,  I added extra carrots, celery and onions and montreal steak seasoning. I also used orzo instead of rice. I didn't realize until after that I accidently left out the half n half. It was outstanding! I have also made this recipe with chicken. Yummy.

This soup was very good.  I used fat free half & half and it was fine.  Next time I will use half the butter and add a little more salt and/or more chicken bouillon.  I added a tiny bit of tarragon too.  UPDATE:  11/2014 - made this again, used 1/2 the butter and again FF 1/2 n 1/2 and it was very good.  No tarragon this time but did mince a clove of garlic.  We give this 4 1/2 stars.

I have made this soup for two years now and am working on my third. It is so good, it never lasts past the second day, just like my other Thanksgiving leftovers!

Superb. I've made this twice now, after Thanksgiving and now days after Christmas. This time I subsituted 2 chicken breast, cubed & skillet cooked. Also added some thyme and sage, used 7qts chicken broth, a bit more salt and white pepper. Made a delicious cream of chicken & rice soup too. My loaf of homemade herb bread went perfectly too! I love this very delicious and versatile recipe!

Thanks for a great recipe. My picky 10yr old even asked for more. It's good even for "non-soup" eaters. Anyone who likes chicken or turkey pot pie will like it. I made minor changes just to use what I had on hand. Had no carrots, used mixed frozen veggies, used brown rice, half a cup only, and cut both cream and butter in half,but added in a cup of leftover mashed potatoes. It was wonderful, and as others said, it improves the next day.  This will be something that I make again and again. I do think it would be wonderful with wild rice, and another reviewer mentioned using broccoli which I also think would be a great variation.

I omitted the celery (personal preference).  At the end, I threw in bits of leftover stuffing/dressing crumbled up.  It was like 'Thanksgiving in a bowl'!

This was good! I roasted the carcass and added garlic like someone else did here! However! It did taste like something was 'missing'. So, hubby and I kept adding poultry seasoning and salt at the end. Then the last add...I added more garlic powder. Hubby LOVED it! Will make this in the future! Maybe trying chicken.

Unbelievably good!  I had been avoiding all the soup recipes, but I had so much leftover turkey that I ran out of other ideas.  But this was by far the best meal I tried with my leftovers.
I had thrown away the turkey bones a few days earlier, so I used a large can of chicken broth (for a half-recipe).  And my husband doesn't like celery in things, so I skipped that.  I added chopped up mushrooms instead.  To be a bit healthier, I substituted olive oil for half the butter and milk instead of half-and-half.  I'm sure it's even better with all the butter and cream.
I will be sharing this recipe with all my family and friends.  And I can't wait until we cook a turkey again someday just because of this soup.

Fabulous! I'm sorry, but I did change a few things... I used 1/2 the butter; 1/2 the flour (used quinoa flour); added a parsnip. Used an organic wild rice/brown mix. It was delicious! Hubby said it's so different from my usual turkey soup - said to keep the recipe! I am! Thank you!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I followed it exactly, except for the following changes:  only 2 onions (all I had), added about 1/4 lb chopped baby bella mushrooms when sauteeing vegetables, and added fresh thyme.  A nice creamy and hearty soup.  A keeper!

Great soup! I didn't have half and half so used 2 percent (healthier) and I threw in a bag of corn which gave the soup nice texture/flavor.

I tweaked the recipe a little with less flour and half/half. Also added a box of uncle bens chicken with wild rice, made the flavor perfect with the rest of the stuffing, yummy.

I love, love, love this soup!  I look up this recipe every time we have a turkey carcass!  I do buy a marinated turkey breast, saute it in pieces and then grind it up to add to the soup, I just love it with extra meat!

First time making this one. So far as I'm tasting during the cooking, Awesome! I like the creamy flavor for a nice change of pace. I added a bit of sherry. I wanted to add cream sherry but didn't have any handy. I think this is going to be a keeper. You do have to season to taste or it could be bland. I'm going to cook the rice as a side so I can freeze the leftovers and try with pasta for the next meal.

This soup reminds me of shrimp etouffee (but without the shrimp). Since I developed a shell fish allergy, I'm unable to consume my once favorite dish (shrimp etouffee). This soup is a great alternative and was a hit with my family. The rice sticks  to the bottom, so make sure you stir well before serving.

I made this today (day after Thanksgiving). It was awesome. 
I altered the recipe a bit though. I used only 2 onions, about 7 stalks of celery, and a bag of baby carrots (cut in half). After sauteing the veggies, I followed the directions although I did subsitute whole milk instead of Half/Half. Added my remaining turkey stock and some chicken stock. At this time I added the turkey and seasonings along with 3 zuchinni squash (this put it over the top in taste!!) and let it simmer for 30 mins. 
It was so yummy!! I would make this again.

This was really tasty!  My husband isn't normally very enthusiastic about my leftover turkey soup efforts, but he loved this one.  The only changes I made were to add some diced potatoes (about 25 mins before it was done) just because I love potatoes and to add the cream when it was done so that it didn't separate.

Very good.  I boiled a roast chicken carcass with 2 bay leaves, poultry seasoning, onion and carrots.  Removed them when I deboned, and made a tasty broth.

Awesome soup recipe. I make it regularly because my toddlers eat it up like candy.  I usually add a bag of frozen brussel sprouts to the sautéing veggies.

I've also experimented with using a variety of lower fat replacements for cream/butter. Pretty much anything works - you just might get a thicker/thinner consistency. Taste is always amazing.

Really good.  This hits the spot, and as Valorie said, our family looks forward to the soup more than the bird.  Works equally well with a leftover chicken carcass.  I usually add a wild rice blend, and generally double the rice for a more hearty soup (I usually end up with more stock as well, so it probably evens out in the end).

Thank you for saving my soup.  I had two turkey legs from the deli that I bought to make soup.  It was terribly gamey smelly to the point of I thought I'd just have to chuck it.  No rice or flour so I added a little cornstarch.  I used your butter and half n half idea and added more onion--sauteed this time.  It smells GREAT!  I had also added bits of keilbasa.  I will never eat turkey or chicken broth ever again!  :-)

i've been making this soup once or twice a year for a few years now.  it's my FAVorite soup!  i make a giant pot of it, we eat as much as we want and i freeze the rest in mason jars (use the kind with the straight top so the jars don't break during freezing).  thank you so much for sharing, valerie!

My family & friends loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I added a little penne pasta & used smoked turkey.  It is now a favorite.  First time I am actually buying a turkey to make soup!

I'm not a big fan of turkey soup but feel guilty throwing out the carcass, so I decided to try this cream soup.  To my surprise it was pretty good.  However, next time I will reduce the onions to half and saute some fresh mushrooms.  This time I also added some thyme which gave it a better flavor.

This soup is superb! I used milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and it was still outstanding. Creamy, buttery, delicious.

Hmm. this soup really has no flavor whatsoever. I added salt, garlic salt, garlic powder and turkey seasoning (sage, etc) and it was still bland. It makes a ton too. So now I have soup that won't get eaten and I have no idea what else I can do to it, to make it better!

Fabulouso!!! I only used 1/4 c butter, added about 1 1/2 cups of homemade turkey gravy from the day before instead of the flour, and some mashed potato and green bean leftovers...added a cup of cream instead of half n half and basmati rice....so good and creamy!!!

Very good hearty soup! Cracks me up though to read how some have changed it (minimal butter, no half and half, no flour...) and still rate this recipe! Really good as is!

Amazing! This was my first attempt at turkey soup and it turned out great! I'm not a fan of soups with clear broths, so when I came across this I was happy, even happier when it was just as good as the reviews described. I didn't have any half-and-half cream, so I used homo milk instead, and it worked excellent. I will be making this again!

There was a few things that I changed.  I had no bouillon so I added a cup and a half of leftover gravy, and added 2 cups of rice instead of 1.  I would call this recipe a 5 star stoup.

Amazing recipe....with some changes :) I used half the butter and the flour which significantly reduced the fat and calories without a noticeable difference.  I also subbed 1 cup of barley for the rice.  I skipped the bouillon to reduce the sodium and added a teaspoon of sugar and it was perfect!!

With all the butter and onions, it helped cut down on the turkey smell that I was getting tired of. This is so hearty.

This soup was a huge hit!!  It made a lot, so I put half in the freezer, thinking it would go bad in the fridge.  But by the 2nd day, we were defrosting the frozen ones!!  I didn't have enough half-and-half, so I replace the rest with just milk.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic, pressed.  I'm not sure how much of a difference that made, but OH MY GOSH!!  This soup was to DIE FOR!!

My hubby really liked this. I was spending the day in the kitchen so I had several things going at once. My friend, who has cancer, had spent Thanksgiving at relatives so she didn't have any left-overs. I asked her what she would like, and she said chicken salad. So I stopped at Costco and bought a rotissere chicken and croissants. After I made the chicken salad (chicken breast, apple, celery, candied sliced almonds & mayo), I still had all the dark meat on the chicken, so I decided to make this soup. I boiled the chicken with a turkey leg, adding an onion, carrot & bay leaf. Now I was ready to put the soup together. After picking off all the meat, I decided to make a double batch. Next time I'll cut the rice and flour by half; it was too thick, but oh, so delicious! While that was simmering, I made bread pudding with the remaining croissants. I started with the Cherry Chocolate Almond Croissant Bread Pudding recipe, but omitted the almonds, cherry & chocolate, and added apple pie filling and cinnamon. I doubled the custard part and added about a cup of brown sugar. All in all, a great day in the kitchen!

Excellent! This was actually my second year using this recipe with Thanksgiving's leftovers.  Last year I didn't add the half and half, but added it this year because I had some left over from another recipe.  Its good with the half and half, but I did prefer the taste of last year's soup without it.  Also, I used less onion and butter. I've passed along this recipe to a few friends and will be making this after every Thanksgiving!

This is a great recipe! I had to make a soup for our PTA Teacher Appreciation Lunch @ my daughter's school & had an extra turkey in the fridge for Thanksgiving. I wanted to do something a little different & this was perfect. I admit I did add more seasoning than was called for, but I thought it needed a bit of pumping up in the flavor dept. I added garlic, poultry seasoning & basil. My husband thought it tasted like chicken & dumplings & said we should do dumplings next time instead of rice.

This is the 2nd time I have made this soup after Thankgiving and it is awesome! I made a few changes this time that turned out great..I added more carrots and celery and only added 2 onions, my boyfriend suggested noodles, so I added egg noodles after it had already simmered for about 30-40 minutes and cooked until they were tender (about 6 or 7 minutes).  I also put 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half to make it not quite so thick. This soup is a go to..I don't even know if I'll try another!

Yum! I had way too much broth, so I set 1/3 aside to freeze. Even then, I had to make 1.5x this recipe! I added frozen peas, and used mostly fat free half and half, and a little full flavor half and half. Delicious!

This soup is better than the Thanksgiving Dinner itself and easy enough for a guy like me to make!  Be sure you use a stock pot with a thick bottom, to help prevent the rice from sticking and burning on the bottom.

This was terrific (and we don't usually LIKE turkey soup).  I followed the recipe exactly (less one onion, since I only had 2) and it was perfect.  Highly recommend.

Pretty good.  Was kind of bland but at least my very picky 11 year old ate his bowl full.  And that says a lot in his case.  Will definitely make again when the turkey craving hits the family.

This was very creamy and very good, although a bit heavy for after Thanksgiving. I found the leftovers to be even more flavorful for lunch in the days after I made it.

LOVE IT!  I make this every time I bake a turkey.  I always brine my turkeys, so this soup gets all that seasoning too.  It's delicious.  I usually cut up the white breast meat for the soup, and save the stringy carcass meat for enchiladas.  I only use one onion and add lots more celery and carrots.
***UPDATE... Made again with a rotisserie chicken.  Very bland.  It looks like the flavor of this soup is all in the preparation of the carcass as well as the broth.  SO... TASTE the broth before adding in Veggies and Flour.  If its too salty, you will probably want all the flour.  IT if its bland... add very little flour.

This was good on the day I made it, but on the day after I made it once the flavors had more time to meld, it was wonderful! I used about 1/3 of the butter and added a can of creamed corn. Definitely will make this again the next time I have leftover turkey!

We LOVED this recipe! I halved it, and used chopped up leftover turkey from Xmas dinner! I used leftover gravy for part of the broth, also! I did not have celery, and it definately needed it! I used half heavy whipping cream, and half 2% milk, since I didn't have the half and half. I also added chopped/minced garlic to the onion and carrots, while they are cooking in the butter! It was a great recipe, and I look forward to taking some to work! I definately rate it 5 stars!

I didn't save my turkey carcass so I just used broth instead. It was a bit salty so i would probably not use so much next time or use low sodium broth. My husband loved it!

Used leftover crockpot turkey breast with chicken broth. Subbed whole milk for the cream. Cooked rice ahead of time to assure doneness. Left out carrots & added frozen brocolli. Added garlic powder, but next time will add poultry seasoning or something to jazz it up a bit. It was a thick, thick chowder so I added more & more chicken broth. Dh & I agreed that peanuts sprinkled in top would help it. Once it cooled down it got real thick & I will add more broth to serve again. It was not a "soup" recipe by any means.

I really wanted to give this recipe five stars but does it really need a cup of butter!? I used 2 tablespoons and used fat free half and half with the full amount of flour and this was a fantastic soup. Actually its more of a stew but it is fantastic. My husband, who does not eat leftovers, ate this for 3 days!

I had already boiled some leftover turkey and added mixed vegs and celery before I found this recipe.  Now wanting to make a tomato-based stew, I stumbled on this.  I cooked onion in butter and added flour, blended in some broth and added back into the pot.  I then added some heavy whipping cream (I had it on hand), salt, pepper, seasoning salt and rice and bouillion.  Cooked for 20 more mins and it was perfect.  Can't wait to eat tomorrow for lunch.

Made this with my leftover turkey carcass and it came out perfectly! I made a few small changes based on previous reviews- 1/2 the amount of butter and flour and added extra veggies and a cup of frozen corn. Also added dried thyme, sage, and a bay leaf to the simmering stock. Next time I will use fat-free 1/2 and 1/2.  My husband and I love this soup! Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this soup several times and it always comes out great!!  Instead of rice, I use narrow egg noodles because that is what my family prefers.  I also sometimes add frozen peas or corn just to give it some more color.

First time I’ve ever made turkey soup - this was easy and delish! I love the versatility of it. I used egg noodles instead of rice and lots of carrots but left out the celery and onions (personal preference). I had no problem with it being too thick as some reviews mentioned. It made a lot but I sent some home with family and friends. My husband didn’t think I should keep the turkey carcass as he isn’t a big fan of soups, but he liked it as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good use of the T-day leftover turkey!! The bites I had out of the pan were amazing and smelled so good while cooking.  Only thing I did different was to use turkey base rather than the chicken bouillon because I had some leftover, haha =/. I stuck this in the freezer to eat later this week when I have to work late.

I made this soup for the first time today.  It was good thick soup and a great way to use my leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  But I have to say that it took me alot alonger to prepare than the 2 hrs. on the recipe.  Maybe because I had a carcass of a 22 lb turkey? I also added mushrooms and peas to mine.  I had so much soup that I had to divide it into 2 pots.  I'm not sure if I would go to that much trouble again.  I think it was alot of work.

Best soup I have ever made.  The consistency was excellent and even became very thick which was wonderful for saving and diluting later with chicken broth.  I did use evaporated milk instead of cream and it was still WONDERFUL.

This is the best turkey soup ever! The next time I make it I will add a little more celery and carrots but other than that it was amazing. I cooked all the bones in water for 1 hour and strained it all then put in fridge for 2 days cause I was so busy but when I went to make it wow it was so good. I did use 1/2 and 1/2 cream instead of milk and Jasmati rice (which I love the flavor of) but I can't say enough good about this oh except that the next day was even better! Made for a crown of 100 and they all lovvvvved it!

Delicious!  It really doesn't need any butter.  I only added 1-2 tablespoons at the end to just give it a more rich flavor - but could easily go without.  The soup was very very dense, so I added more stock.  Next time I will also reduce the amount of flour to only 1-2 tablespoons.  Added rosemary, chopped parsley and thyme.  We all loved it!

The absolutely best soup; very rich and yummy.  I followed several reviews and added a little stuffing, a little rice and a little pasta.  Didn't have any fat-free half and half and cut back a little bit on the butter.  The crusty french bread which someone suggested was a great idea.  My husband doesn't usually like cream-based soups but he has had two big bowls of it and I just made it last night.  A winner!

I've made this twice now (exactly as per the directions) and it just isn't that great consistency-wise.  I had to add extra cream and a couple cans of condensed soup just to even out the thickness even AFTER adding more flour.  I'd take this as a base ingredient list only and then continue to play with the recipe until I find something more to my liking.

Very flavorful and easy. I used yolk-free egg noodles due to kids' preference. Remove the meat from carcass b4 boiling, else it will be tough. Makes plenty to share.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted orzo for rice, just because I prefer pasta.  My family loved it.

Had to change proportions a little bit because I elected to add a turnip, a whole bushel of broccoli, and more of the main ingredients. Didn't have have half/half so I mixed 1% w/ whipping cream, also flavored with some fresh herbs to give it a little more of a "earthy glow". Otherwise, it tasted great, and any of my alterations were on account of preference...Oh yea I also added a ball of the leftover stuffing, cold, into the bowl and poured the hot soup over to conceal.

Perfect recipe for leftover turkey meat and carcass; even tasted better and got thicker each time we reheated it...Yummy.  Used fat-free half & half like other reviewers and glad I did.  With so much butter in it already, I would think the full strength would be overpowering.  Trust me, save the calories, it's excellent with the fat-free.

Awesome!  I used half the butter and flour that the recipe called for.  I think it would have been too greasy with all that butter.  I also uded 2 onions but I will use 3 next time.  I made my stock the day before and kind of freaked out when I pulled it out of the fridge and it looked like jello.  It was perfect though once it was warmed up.  Will definetely make again with turkey or chicken.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe called for with the exception of 1/2 the Flour and Butter based on the other reviewers recommendations.  I agree that 1/2 the Butter was a good suggestion.  A whole cup of butter would have been far too much.  I actually think you could reduce the butter even more and the recipe would be fine. Based on following all other instructions my soup was VERY watery and bland.  In order to improve the recipe I ended up adding 1 heaping tablespoon of corn starch to thicken, FOUR tablespoons of Chicken Boullion granules, One Teaspoon of Garlic Powder and 1/2 teaspoon of Onion Powder.  I used Egg Noodles instead of Rice.  After I added the extra spices and corn starch I think the soup turned out very well.  My step-kids who are very picky eaters really liked the soup!

Very good.  I had to use evaporated milk as I did not have any half and half.  I found the soup to be quite thick and had to keep adding milk to try to thin it.  It does have a very good flavor, though.

This was delicious! I felt like using my slow cooker and letting the aroma fill the house.  I put the carcass, some water and chicken broth in the slow cooker and set in on low for about 8 hours - the meat fell off the bones and the broth was amazing.  Next, I followed the instructions with the veggies, but I added garlic, peas & carrots.  We are still eating the leftovers!  Turkey pot pie tonight!

We enjoyed this recipe.  The broth was a little thin (this could've been our fault), so I took some broth out and made separate pot with bisquick dumplings (added 2 cups water and a buillon cube) and it was fabulous.  You can even doctor or experiment with this great recipe.

I have been making turkey soup like this for years, after every turkey we cook (which is about 9 times per year), we love turkey. Sometimes I will add potatoes, turnip and whatever other vegetable I can find. Either rice or pasta work in this great soup.

I used whole milk instead of half and half because that is all I had, it would probably be better with the half and half. Also I used olive oil instead of butter.  It was really good.

This soup was wonderful...very creamy and decadent. It is difficult to believe a soup so sumptious was made using a turkey carcass, something I used to throw away. I won't be tossing another one.  I put the carcass into a bag and freeze it immediately after dinner. I make the soup on a cold day when comfort is needed.  Thanks so much for the post.

OMG.  I can't get enough of this soup!!!  DH isn't real big on rice, so I leave that out.  But, I do add corn and potatoes, to make it more hearty. Penzey's Poultry season, garlic, bay leaves, etc...  I leave out the half and half.  The flour/butter roux is enough creaminess for me.  Most the time, I end up tossing in NO YOKE noodles, too!  I end up breaking it into three Tupperware - one for NOW, and two to freeze for later.

I add vegetables when cooking the turkey frame for more flavorful broth. Then, they get discarded and new vegetables added according to this recipe.

This is one of those recipes that I would rate off the charts. I never felt like dealing with the turkey carcass before, but always hated to just throw it away. Trying to stretch the dollar I decided to try this soup. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! Everyone loved it! Even all 6 children! (especially with oyster crackers) Thank you SOOO much for submitting this recipe! I will always make after turkey days!!!

we used this recipe to get rid of our left over turkey, but since my hubby had already carved and threw away the carcass we just used the meat and made a broth with it. also since i used rosemary, citrus and basil on my turkey I added it to the soup. The soup came out more like a chowder, but it was fantastic, our new after thanksgiving tradition. Thank you so much

This soup was great. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, since I think it needed a little oomph. First off, I reduced the flour and butter by half. I added 1/4 cup Turkey soup base (I get mine from Penzeys), 1 TBS of Hungarian Chicken Rub (any rub will do, as long as the main ingredient isn't salt) 2 tsp poultry seasoning, and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I also added the cream after the rice was cooked, so it wouldn't get glopy.  At the very end, I added 1 cup peas and 1 cup corn.  It was very flavorful.

Delicious!! Ive made this for a few years now and this is the first time I didnt add Half&Half(I never added flour) and I like it even better. I also add diced garlic,corn, some basil and parsley. I leave out the celery inless I already have it. I like to use pasta but have had it with rice. Also I would say eat this the day you make it. The rice or pasta gets mushy.

This soup was great to use up some after-thanksgiving turkey remains. I took some other reccomendations from prior reviews and added the following: 3 bay leaves to the stock while simmering the carcass, substituted skim milk for half the cream, added an extra carrot and an extra celery, substituted 1/4 cup olive oil for half the butter, and added 1/2 tsp of sage during the last 30 minutes of simmering. This recipe has to be one of the heartiest soups I've ever eaten (my wife could only finish 3/4 of a bowl), and will definitely be a post-holiday staple for my family.

My whole family really enjoyed this soup. I substituted noodles for rice since I knew my girls would like it better. I also had to add more broth--which I had plenty of. Really tasty. My teenager, who is finicky, really liked it. She said it tasted like "a turkey pot pie, but better." Cool. :) No particular reason I didn't mark it with 5 stars--just a solid recipe, no subtle flavors that would make it "gourmet"--just good! Definitely a keeper. I'll use this one again.

This is a keeper.  Very good and creamy.  Cut down on the flour, butter and cream and was perfect.

I just made this and so far I'm pleased. I did make some adjustments though, I cut the flour down to a 1/2 cup, and added more broth than recipe called for, but onlty to thin it out a little, It was fine before I added the extra broth, but it would have been more of a chowder, which would be great without the rice. But I wanted to add the rice  so I needed it more brothy than chowder like. Sprinkled with a little chopped fresh parsley on each bowl when I served, a hot roll on the side and it's a good and hearty meal.
11/09- I just made this recipe again, and did somethings different this time. I used evaporated milk and added my leftover gravy from Thanksgiving. Added some poultry seasoning and bay leaf to the carcass while it simmered for an hour. Turned out really good!!!

No offense, but I really wasn't that impressed.  Don't get me wrong - it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't give this a 5 star rating (sorry).  Tastes kinda like a starving student meal I used to make with cream of chicken soup & instant rice.  I'm sure my granddaughter will like it ...

I made this soup and it was sure yummy. I added fresh sage, and ground dry thyme. I also added potatoes as well as the rice, and corn. I didn't have enough flour on hand so it is a little thin for my liking but that is because of lack of my ingred. I will say that I added more salt to the recipe, but I add more salt to most recipes. Oh and I used a smoked turkey for this recipe.

This was very good.  I made it using the leftover turkey meat from making the "Make Ahead Turkey Gravy" recipe from this site.  The only thing I did different was substitute 3qts. of chicken broth, since I had used the turkey broth for the gravy.  Since I was using the chicken broth, I also only put in 1 tsp. salt and it was perfect.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is just that it is very rich.  Next time I would definitely use fat free half and half (the neighborhood market I ran to today didn't have any).  Definitely a great recipe for leftover turkey.

This was quite good. I had to make some changes. I didn't have boullion so I added 1 cup chicken broth. I only used one of every vegetable exept carrots. I added 1 cup corn and 1 cup potato instead of rice. I add 2 tsp celery salt and 1 tbsp garlic powder.

This is just great! Like a previous reviewer who heated the carcass up in the oven first, I did that. It did improve the taste. Also, only used 2 onions, not 3. But, using 3 would be fine. Also, if you do want some more kick to it, add some garlic.
We didn't add anything to it. Use lots of ground black pepper, otherwise you could think it was bland.
It is so quick, and so easy.
P.S. With the leftover Turkey broth, pour into icecube trays, when frozen pop out, and store in a ziploc freezer bag. When you need some Turkey or some other stock, voila!!

Great recipe. I dismember the turkey as one would a chicken and boiled the back. Next time I will boil the wings along with the back for additional meat.  lso I used only half the butter. Still was very delicious. Will never throw away the back again.

By far one of my favorite soups! (And I like a lot of them!) The only thing I do different is while my carcass (okay, the turkey's...not mine) is boiling I add some italian spices to boost up the broth. I've also made this soup with chicken breasts and canned chicken broth (just dice the chicken and boil for a few minutes); and it's just as yummy!

Definitely a keeper.  This is so good I have made it again and again.  I buy a turkey before Thanksgiving so I can make this soup to serve and I use the legs and wings to make the Make ahead turkey gravy from this wesite.  A timesaver for sure and soooo good.

This soup was YUMMY! I didn't have any half-n-half so I used regular milk...and it turned out just as great! This wasn't difficult and it took very little time. I recommend boiling the turkey in salt-water for extra flavor!

This soup is very tasty and fool-proof.  I didn't even follow the recipe accurately and sort of did my own thing and it still came out great.  I would use noodles instead of rice though, like pasta shells.  Great way to get rid of all that leftover turkey!

Very delicious! I did not have any half and half on hand so I omitted that and used milk instead...nor did I have celery but used celery seed for flavor. Still, the soup turned out incredibly tasty and makes a wonderful, warm meal that is filling and simply delicious.

We're ready to cook another turkey, so we can make this soup again! A few changes based on what we had in the cupboard/freezer: homemade broth that had carrots/onions/celery/bay leaf/thyme simmered in the water with the turkey; can of evaporated milk in place of the half-and-half; wild rice dehydrated soup mix (no extra seasonings in it, but some extra veggies like corn, leeks, etc.). This soup was so yummy!! Perfect for a cold day and very easy to do if your stock has already been made and your turkey meat shredded/reserved.

This was fabulous!  Cleaning up after the Thanksgiving meal I threw the turkey carcass right into the pot and boiled the broth & finished making the soup next day--so easy.   The only changes I made: I only used 1/2 c. butter (couldn't bring myself to use a whole cup--I'm sure the extra butter makes it richer) and only used 2 chopped onions.  Good the first day, but, even better the second day!  It is not a spicey soup...very mild with the cream.  This recipe will be part of our day after turkey tradition!

This recipe was excellent!Even my very picky 8 year old liked.  I didn't tell him there was rice included, and he didn't seem to notice.  I added some chopped pieces of potatoes and some broccoli.  My husband can't wait for Christmas to have it again!

I thought this was a very good turkey soup. The only differences I made was that i added diced red potatoes to the vegetables and omit the rice. I let it simmer for much longer to soften all vegetables and then I added the cream at the very end.

A big hit at my house and a great way to make sure nothing goes to waste! Everyone loved this and my 4-year-old ate 2 good sized helpings of leftovers today! Excellent recipe and nice and easy, too!

I LOVE this soup, and have made it for several years! After T'giving dinner, I boil the carcass and pick the meat, then freeze the meat in one container and the broth in another. Sometime in the middle of winter, I bring it out to thaw in the fridge for a couple of days, and then "whip up" a rich and flavorful turkey soup. You might want to start with less than the suggested salt, and adjust to your taste.

I’ve been making this soup for years and family gets more excited about it than they do about the turkey on Thanksgiving.  I see other reviews where they  add vegetables and garlic, but I think the simplicity is what makes this recipe so delicious.  The only change is I leave out the bouillon granules  ( and add a little sea salt) since my turkey stock is so fresh and good.

I have used this recipe for years.  It is truly the best.  I actually make it super thick and put it in pie crusts for turkey pot pie.  It is one of my favorite recipes and approved by countless others.

I wonder why the nutrition information is omitted in this recipe ?! Could it be because that would have scared off some cooks ? When you think about it, 1 cup of butter, 2 cups of half and half and so little veggies ..
I had to make few changes to make this little bit healthier. For the turkey broth, to the whole carcass of the turkey I added 2 quarts of water, 1 onion, 1 celery, 1 clove of garlic and 1 bay leaf. For the soup, I used 1/4 cup of both butter and four, 1 big onion, 3 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 1 1/2 quart of strained turkey broth, 1 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of brown rice. Salt and pepper were enough to flavor this soup ( no need for chicken bouillon granules) because the broth was concentrated and very flavorful.
Now, I can serve this soup to my family without guilt.

This is the best turkey soup I have every had. Made a double batch for my sister and she took it to a church soup supper. It was gone and people wanted the recipe. I always look forward to cooking a turkey just for the carcass to make this soup! It also freezes well   - just thaw in frig. and do not bring to a boil when reheating.   Update:  Brother just called wanting to know if he gave me the turkey carcass if i would make this soup for him. My family saves the carcasses for me to make this wonderful soup.

OVER THE MOON!  I have made this the last 4 times we have had turkey.  I made it in early Oct and have requests for it again with Thanksgiving leftovers.  (they turned down Southwestern style for this.)
I did not do the rice.  I use Chicken Stock as I feel bouillon is to salty (or at least I have no control over the salt) added turnips, parsnips, carrots and celery.  DO NOT cut them to small.

Best Soup Recipe ever!!!  I don't like to add cream to anything so instead of that I used the leftover turkey gravy (that made it so there was something in it to add a little thickness.  Other than that substitution this was a great EASY and tasty recipe to follow, and best of all EVERYONE loved it!!  :D

I have made this soup after each Thanksgiving dinner for a few years now. We have a tradition with friends called "Soup Friday" for a day after Thanksgiving get together. This soup always gets rave reviews by kids and adults alike and I am asked to make it year after year. The only thing I change is the amount of onion as too much can overpower the flavor of the soup. Otherwise... one of the best recipes I've ever made!

This is absolutely my favorite soup recipe.  We look forward to making this after every Thanksgiving, and we use the leftover carcass from two deep-fried turkeys.  The cajun rub my husband uses to season the turkeys puts this over the top.

This is an awesome recipe. I also substitute chicken. I boil a whole chicken and save the broth for stock. Vegetable can be added whole instead of chopping for heavier texture.  This soup will not disappoint.

Great recipe,my wife and kids love it.I use 1 large onion instead of the 3 medium,I also add 1/4 - 1/2 cup leftover stuffing.Gives it great flavor, and instead of rice I use fettuccine noodles broken into 2" pieces. And if it needs it a pinch or so of poultry seasoning. I hope this is helpful to some of you, enjoy.

My whole family loves this!  I tend to simmer the turkey 2hrs and I do use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour, but other than that it is perfect.  My son-in-law thinks we should make turkey often so he can have this soup.

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe, but had to take the time because we all LOVED this soup!!! I was intrigued by the cream and flour in turkey stock, had never heard of it, let alone tasted it! I followed the recipe exactly except to add the salt and pepper in the begiining to the carcass and added a few bay leaves. I really wanted to make dumplings and cook them at the end, but my husband is not a big fan of dumplings, so I skipped them (this time!)
 Thank you for this recipe... A really different, but delicious twist to traditional turkey soup! Or shall I call it "turkey chowder?!?)

The soup prepared as is was very bland.  I found that I had to add onion powder, garlic salt, Old Bay, pepper, celery salt and worchestshire (sp?).

Made it with home-made turkey broth.  First sauteed garlic, onion and celery. Carrots were added when the first three were soft.  Added about 3 or 4 Tbsp of flour.Then added leftover gravy and slowly added the turkey broth. Finished by adding the turkey and the rice. Good with either brown or white. Season as required.

I followed the recipe exactly and the soup has close to zero flavor.  I'm really surprised that it got such good reviews.  I added garlic powder as one review suggested, but this didn't help much.  If I had it to do again I might use half the roux or add white wine and lemon.

Super yummy. I only gave 4 stars because I had to add rice/noodles. There just wasn't enough. I did cut back on the flour to keep it a little "soupyier"..don't think that is a word :) I froze my turkey carcass and leftovers after Thanksgiving and pulled it out the other day. While it was boiling away, it smelt like Thanksgiving day all over again. Was really great.

This soup was amazing!  I just made it for my inlaws and they could not stop raving about it.  I did make a few changes to add a bit of flavour and based on our taste preferences.  I added a bit more carrots and celery (3 of each), 1 tsp of sage, used fat free creamer, a pinch of garlic powder, reduced to 1 large onion, only 3 tbsp of butter, used barley instead of rice.  I added one cup of chicken broth and ommitted the flour.  This soup will only improve in flavour as it is reheated and made at least enough for 12 bowls.  We felt the creamer really added a nice flavour. Thanks so much for this recipe, it was my first attempt at turkey soup and I will be making it for many years to come!

I tell you, this is so great, my husband, my kid and I ate all this by ourselves, (in two meals).  But we craved for this the next day and we are not big on that.  You could add a little more bouillon granules if you like.  We did.  But thats the ONLY change me made.  This is perfect!

I first came across this recipe about 15 years ago, in a recipe book produced after the movie, "Home for the Holidays", with recipes featured in the movie.  My three extremely soup-phobic kids all devoured this soup, and I have been dreaming of it ever since.  Thrilled to find it again, and will definitely be making this for years to come, once again.

I agree, this soup is delicious.  However I do not like thrice cooked turkey (once in the oven, second in the broth, and third in the soup).  So I opted to buy a roasted chicken from Costco and used all of the meat from it.  I added it with about 10 minutes remaining.  Just the right amount.  This is good comfort food.

Love this soup! Followed all the ingredients and also followed some recommendations from previous reviewers: added more carrots and celery, used egg noodles instead of rice, and added more herbs for flavor. Also added in a can of peas! Ultimate comfort soup, definitely on my favorites list :)

My son made this soup today and it came out excellent.  My turkey soup is made with broth, but using the 1/2 and 1/2 made it nice and creamy.  This is one soup the whole family likes and will be made again.

This soup is amazing. I made it using chicken broth as I already thrown out my turkey carcass and it still turned out great. I added  some crushed garlic with the vegetables and about about a half left over gravy. Pure creamy delight!

I quite liked this recipe however I only added 3/4 cup of butter, and I found even that to be a tad bit much. Also I added about a cup of water since the rice absorbed most of the liquid. Overall very tasty and a great way to use up some of those leftovers:)

Great recipe.  Added peas and used gluten free flour and as other reviewer, a little garlic powder. My rice was already cooked, so I was able to cut back on the stock.  Didn't use the boulion as I had already made a turkey stock.

Delicious!  I made the recipe almost as written, but added a few more veggies, half the butter, and fat free half and half.  Added the half and half after the rice was cooked, because it didn't seem like a good idea to boil it. Also added the meat at the end so it didn't shred while stirring.  Thanks for the good recipe.

This is a good soup recipe. I use potatoes (add them in with the carrots, etc.) rather than rice, but that is just a personal preference. If you are concerned about the flour being too much, add only half of it and then add more (mixed with cold water) if you need it at the end. The 1 cup worked fine for me, both this year and last.

I have to join in and agree with most posters - This is excellent soup.  I'm not a huge cream soup lover, but this is an exception.  My whole family loved it and it felt good to use up the rest of the turkey!  I made exactly as recipe directed and wouldn't change a thing!

This is just outstanding.  I started with a turkey roasted after brining overnight using the "Turkey Brine" recipe you can find here at AllRecipes.  This soup is an excellent way to use up the leftover carcass.

This is a fantastic basic soup!!  I would suggest more spices because it does seem to end up bland and would add potatoes rather than rice and and also add more vegetables such as corn.  This is a fantastic foundational soup!  I will do this one again!

This soup is exceptional. It has great flavor and is a great departure from that same old same old leftover turkey soup. I love the cream addition! I modified in that I did not have a bag of long grain rice, so I added the box of long grain wild rice mix that I had in the cupboard. I added the seasoning packet as well, just for grins. I also substituted a teaspoon of Bragg's liquid aminos for the salt. Came out terrific. My teen boys,who are not big soup eaters at the best of times, ate three bowls. Thanks! This will be our leftover turkey soup recipe from now on!

This soup is fantastic!  It taste so rich and fattening but it's really not.  My hubby loves it and so does my 17month old daughter!  She says  "mmmm good momma" everytime she takes a bite!

I've made this soup four times and each time I'm always surprised at how good it is.  I add some garlic powder and a little more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for, but other than that, I follow it exactly.  And let me add...it tastes so much better on day two!  So good!

My kids aren't big fans of onions so I only used 1/2 an onion and 1/2 the butter.  I substituted medium curry powder for the black pepper and it turned out to be the best soup I've made yet.  Both kids asked for seconds.

This soup is always a winner!  I cut down on the flour and butter as well and it turns out great!  I sometimes add a bit of poultry seasoning to it and extra salt and pepper.

This is the best after turkey dinner soup I have ever tried! I used only 1 cup of half and half and added more stock for a rich and creamy, delicious turkey soup!

We LOVE this soup! I make it more often than we have a big turkey dinner though ... I usually use a couple of turkey drumsticks - simply boil them as you would the carcass (I boil with 2-3 whole cloves of garlic and an onion for flavor), then shred the meat off the bone. It's one of our rainy day favorites! :)

I love this soup :)  I feel guilty throwing away a carcass because we never eat the dark meat, so I freeze any turkey or chicken carcass until I'm ready to make this.  I always add more chicken bouillon and frozen egg noodles and it comes out just perfect!

This soup is awesome!  My family loves it so much that even when Thanksgiving is at someone else's house I either have to beg for the carcass or still cook a turkey at home.

YUMMY! I had some whipping cream so I used 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup milk for the half and half. I have a big stoneware bowl so I cooked it in that in the oven and it was super easy and I didn't have to worry about scorching the cream. I will be making this again.

This was the best tasting soup I have cooked to date.  The turkey I used was brined from the "Out of this World Turkey Brine" on this site which was also incredible. The next time I make it I think I will omit both rice and turkey meat chunks and puree the veges.

My family loved this recipe, but I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup, I couldn't bring myself to add 2 cubes of butter to the soup kettle.  I always add a box of chicken broth when cooking a  turkey or chicken carcass instead of using all water.  I also added a can of creamed corn when I added the rice.  It was delicous.

Very easy and definately delicious. Most people make the old broth turkey soup after the holidays, but this is so much better. After every holiday, when we treat ourselves to turkey, this is what I will be making with the carcass. Thanks.

Wonderful flavorful, but quite rich. I followed a lot of previous suggestions, cutting some of the cream with light cream, adding a variety of rices and even put in some barley. I also cooked the broth with a bouquet garni of herbs.

I had already made turkey broth and was just checking recipes for some soup ingredient ideas. I took the idea of adding half-and-half, fat free, and flour to my own broth along with the sauteed carrots, onions,and celery. I also added some chicken bouillon and pasta (no rice in the house). This was so good!  Part of what makes this such a great recipe is how much it can be altered for different needs or tastes.

I'm a college student, and this recipe was great!  I will def. cut down the butter next time.. and  I used egg noodles instead of rice-- so I let it simmer for 30 minutes after adding everything (excluding egg noodles) and then added the noodles so they wouldn't be overcooked.

Best turkey soup ever!  We modified it to substitute egg noodles instead of rice.  If you add enough egg noodles it takes on the consistency of a stew more than a soup, although it tastes like chicken and dumplings - yummy!!

LOVED IT! I made a double batch and invited another family of six over, her kids are really picky eaters so I said that they could eat rolls with PBJ if they didn't like it, but all but one ate more than one bowl.  My husband had three bowls and we still had some leftover for later. Definitel a new family tradition!

It's a very tasty soup. I used less butter and milk instead of half and half cream. I added a little bit of thyme, rosemary and sage. It was thicker the next day, more like chowder. Nomnomnom!!!

This was yummy!  The only thing I changed was to add another stalk of celery because I like celery.  Also, I was afraid to add the full 2t of salt because I thought it might be too much, but since I used low sodium bouillon it really did need it so I added a bit more at the end.  Very good!  Made it at camp and everyone enjoyed it.  Definitely not a low fat dish but nice to splurge on once in a while.

very good soup.  I added a a little more salt in the end for my own personal taste but I loved it.  I only used 2 onions and I added a can of cream of corn but mostly followed recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great soup recipe, but I also made a lot of changes to make it healthier.  I used quinoa instead of rice (cooks much faster, is super nutritious), eliminated the bullion (enough salt already!), used olive oil for sauteing the veggies but not more than 1/4 cup (the turkey broth, even when skimmed, has way too much fat already!).  I also stirred in some grated Parmesan when serving.  Delicious, and healthy!

This is an absolutely fantastic soup.  The only change I made was to use Jasmine rice.  Didn't have any long grain rice.  I also only got 2 1/2 quarts of the broth.  It did not detract from the taste at all!

This is a fantastic recipe but needs some tweaking. First off, as suggested, do NOT use the flour or butter! This soup doesn't need it. Second, I used only 1 cup of cream and it was lovely. Too much will dilute the nice turkey flavor. I also used chicken broth for some of the water, therefore eliminating the bouillon. I added 2 bay leaves as well. Also, I cooked 1 cup of uncooked brown rice. If u do not cook it first, you will end up with a thick, starchy mess! With these changes, this recipe was wonderful.

Absolutely the best homemade cream of turkey soup I have ever made. It tastes just like my favorite restaurant’s version. My family and friends really enjoyed this soup and asked for the recipe. The only change I made to this recipe was I added more carrots and celery. Thanks for sharing!

This soup was really easy to make.  The flavor was rich.  I made a huge pot (without rice) and was able to freeze a lot for later.  Great recipe.

Delicious! I did not have to add half and half, though may tomorrow if it is really thick. My family loved it and I will add this to my recipe box for leftover turkey in the future. One note of advice. Make sure to mix flour completely and add broth slowly to flour mixture or soup will have lumps. As I mentioned before, the soup was thick and delicious even without the half and half.

This was so good!  I actually threw the carcass away (shame, shame, I know), so all I had was leftover gravy.  We used that, added some water and more salt and pepper, along with some cilantro.  I didn't add in the half and half because I don't eat dairy, but I didn't miss it.  Really thick and rich and so yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

One of the best cream soup I ever had. For added flavor, I added some fried bacon bits with a tablespoon of the bacon fat as a substitute for the some of the butter. The whole family couldn't get enough of it.

This was very, very good.  I made this according to the recipe.  However, I used brown rice and whole wheat floor...my family doesn't know the difference.  Maybe I am just a slow cook, but this took me significantly longer than the time listed, a little over 3 hours.

So delicious! I skipped the cream and it was still very thick and rich from the flour and rice. When preparing the stock, I added 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 tsp of black pepper and one rough chopped onion to add more flavor. Excellent soup. This is going in the Thanksgiving recipe collection for sure.

Amazing! The only change I made is that I cooked some celery and carrots with the carcass to flavor the broth a little more. Also, I cooked a couple of dumplings in the soup instead of making biscuits on the side.  My 9yo son (who doesn't like ANYTHING) said that this is the best soup he has ever had.

This was crazy good and very easy. I made a few changes of my own. When I boiled the carcass, I added salt, pepper, some green onions and celery I had left over from stuffing, and two chicken bullion cubes. I think you have to make the broth tasty by itself before you can expect your soup to have good flavor.    After sauteeing the veggies and adding the flour, I did half evaporated milk and half of half/half. I then added more salt and pepper, and two more chicken bullion cubes. This made the soup so tasty and rich.     My husband was surprised that a "first time recipe" turned out this good! My teenaged son declared it awesome, and my mom wanted the recipe after she had the first spoonful. Yum!

This was delicious!  For those of you who live in the NYC vicinity and have gone to a local Diner on Sundays for Cream of Turkey Soup, this is just like that!  I've been looking for a recipe like this for forever!  Extremely thick, more like porridge than soup.  Did change up a few things based on what I had on hand.  I was already making turkey stock from the carcass and had onions & carrots in there, strained it when done and so I used that and then used brown rice instead of white &  I omitted the bouillon.  I added salt & pepper without really measuring, just did to taste.  Just make sure you cook till the rice is done, nobody wants to crunch on uncooked rice!

The flavor of this soup was pretty good, however, I felt like there was WAY too much rice. If I make this again I will probably cut the rice by half.

This stew/soup was sooo good.  I only used 1 large onion, but other than that followed recipe.  Best soup I have ever made, could not stop raving about it.  My husband loved it!!  Try it, you will not be sorry,  the most flavored turkey soup ever!!

I have made several "after-Thanksgiving" soups before, but this one is by far the BEST.  Whole family enjoyed it.  Apart from simmering the carcass for 4 hours instead of 1, I stuck to the directions.

This soup is awesome!  I made it almost as is.  I grated the carrot because I hate chunks of carrots! :-) It is so yummy.  It is like a clam chowder, but without the clams!  You must try this soup!  You will not regret it!

I made a couple of changes...only used 1 C of 1/2 and 1/2 and added another C of stock.  I also added 2 extra bouillon cubes because the stock was not very flavorful.  Before I served the soup, I added the juice of 2 lemons, which transformed the soup and was delectable!  It was not a "stoup" but a nice "soup" as a result of the changes.

Well, done. I added more turkey and broth as I let it cook but it was outstanding. I was afraid the roux would be too much but it was great. Thanks!!

This is my second year of making this soup. It seems to be a family favorite after the holiday. In fact, I think my husband looks forward to it as much as the original roasted turkey! We use homemade noodles instead of rice, but it's just a preference. Delicious.

Wow! This is the next best thing to do with leftover turkey after the sandwich. Didn't change a thing on this recipe. Will most definitely do this again!

Wow ..My DH said this is  his favorite.  Our Granddaughters asked for seconds.  MY daughter said it is to die for. But I did make a couple of changes because I had a  very small turkey Carcass with hardly any meat on it.  (My niece gave it to me when we  had TG at her house) I used 6 cans of Chicken broth instead of water. I also used wild rice  which I cooked  35 minutes before adding it to the soup to finish cooking, because Wild Rice takes about 60 minutes total. When the soup was done I added the cream because I don't like to boil it that  long and I also added the turkey at that time.  I also added a cut up chicken breast because I didn't have enough turkey for the soup.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.   This is  a  keeper without a doubt.  My husband just said he  hates to see it come to an end.  I can't imagine how some gave this a poor review.  The  must have done something different.

Delicious!!! I will never again throw away a turkey carcass without making this soup.    I pretty much made the exact recipe exept I doubled it and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and some dried Thyme.    I also added much more salt and pepper to taste.   This is some of the best soup I ever had. I put in a little over 2 cups of rice and it made my soup a little on the thick side but that is ok, tonight I am going to make homemade biscuits to put the soup over. It will be EXCELLENT.   I ate 5 bowls of this last night, and I had it for lunch today and will have it for supper with the biscuits tonight. Very rich, creamy and ohh so good!   I wouldn't skimp on the butter or the Half & Half, that is what makes it so rich and creamy!!

I just made this again this morning...it is a family favorite.  The only advice I have is to add additional carrots, celery, onion, bay leaf and whole peppercorns to the carcass and water when making the broth...adds another layer of flavor.

Wow. This soup cannot possibly be good for your arteries, but it was sooooo tasty!  It was by far the most delicious turkey rice soup I've ever eaten!  It made a ton so we gave some away and froze some to eat for later...which might get eaten tomorrow.  Wouldn't change a thing when making it next time...thank you...it's a keeper in our house!

YUM YUM YUM.  I added potatoes when I added the turkey and then threw in some cranberries for the last 10 minutes.  I also sauteed the veggies with some cooking sherry.  It was out of this world.

This soup was fantastic. I always wanted to make turkey soup but since I haven't been real sucessful with chicken soup was afraid to try. I used regular half and half but will try fat free the next time.  I had a large turkey carcass so used my largest pot.  I had already been cooking the carcass before finding the recipe so cooked it hours until everything fell apart.  It did take some real thorough going through for small peices of bone, well worth the effort, but once done I had enough for 2 big pots of soup which was a good thing because I was able to give quite a bit away to family who all loved it. I still had some for us and froze the whole other pot for three other meals in a pinch. Next time I will use more rice probably jasmine which we love.  My husband wants me to try this with ham and chicken.  I haven't yet but will.  I am curious how it will do with out a carcass. Thank you for a great recipe.

You can substitute leftover mashed potatoes for the cream for a slightly different flavor and texture.

This recipe is a gem!  I changed the half and half to regular milk and had omit the celery (because I didn't have any).  It was so yummy!  I want to make it again.  I had used this soup to contribute to Christmas Dinner.  We ate some at home and 15 people ate it and there was still alittle left over.  I was asked for the recipe by my niece.  Love it.  It's a keeper.

Excellent turkey soup.  Made with carcass from Christmas dinner and simmered for 3 hours, meat fell off bones easily.  Used canned whole green chilis and just gave a chop (bigger chunks) , added Ro-tel tomatoes, cumin and chopped cilantro. I did not use the flour or the half-and-half as didn't want creamy soup but did add torn up flour tortillas the last 20 minutes cooking for texture.  This is the third day we're eating it and it's better each day.  Will always make this recipe for turkey soup in the future.  Very tasty, you can make to suit your tastes very easily.

I had a bit of trouble adjusting seasonings (Thanks for the tips) and wound up adding more rice to make it thicker.  But it turned out great and made huge pot.  Great with hot crusty rolls.

Excellent soup. I had never made turkey soup before and this is just what we were looking for. I made it two days before we were going to have it and the flavor was incredible. Mine did come out a little thick so I thinned it out with some organic broth. My family loved this soup. I will be making it again and freezing it. Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe just as given, and it is delicious.  The only thing that I will do different next time is less flour, to make it thinner.   I had to add chicken stock the second day to thin it out.  But I loved it. It will be the only turkey soup that I will make from now on.

We had a Cajun fried turkey for the holidays.  The spices from the turkey went great with the creaminess of the soup. My 3 yo and my 13 yo loved it.

This recipe is so economical. I was able to stretch one more meal out of this turkey by using the carcass and making this awesome soup (So important in these hard economic times)  I made this exactly as stated and it turned out great, no changes necessary. I served this with leftover rolls from Thanksgiving and there will be enough soup leftover to feed lunch to my family of four tomorrow. 5 stars!

I hate dark meat, but I didn't want to throw it away from the Thanksgiving turkey. My mom-in-law lives with us, and she loves dark meat. So I decided to make some turkey soup, even though I never had done so before. I tasted it, and it's actually really good.  The half and half helped me a lot. I lvoe creamy soup.  I used cornstarch instead of flour, and I probably only used about 1/2 cup or a little less. I also sauteed 2 tsps of minced garlic with the vegetables. Instead of salt I used garlic salt, and I added parsely flakes. I also used organic brown basmati rice.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is THE BEST soup. I made a few modifications and it was a big hit with all my holiday company.  I used 1/2 cup half & half and the rest was skim milk = still rich and tasty.  I used "better than bouillion chicken soup base" so I"m sure that increased the flavor. This recipe is a keeper. Excellent !!

This is so yummy and so comforting!  I didn't have a turkey carcass so I just boiled a chicken and otherwise followed the directions.  We've been pelted w/a tropical storm for 4 days now so we needed some comfort food.  Added a bit of cornstarch to thicken up to stick to our bellies.  Thank you!

This soup was absolutely delicious!  Very chowder-like, thick and creamy.  Wonderful flavor.  I did add a little bit of garlic powder and some frozen corn, which made it a very hearty and satisfying meal.  It made a lot, we ate it for three days, but never got tired of it!  Will make this again when I have turkey leftovers, great recipe!

Unbelievable! Nobody likes soup in my house...much to my disappointment. But when the mother-in-law brought over a free turkey, I decided to try something new. I whipped out the interweb, found allrecipes, plugged in turkey and voila! My entire family (including the in-laws) could not get enough of this wonderful soup! This is true comfort food. I used chicken stock instead of making my own since I hadn't done a stock before - no problems! (will try it from scratch next time) Do not hesitate - try this recipe!

For those of you who watch Rachael Ray, you'll know what I'm talking about when I call this a "stoup" (it's too thick to be soup, and too thin for a stew).  Initially, the flavour of this soup was really good; I made a few minor modifications: I followed the recipe for " Hearty Turkey Soup with Parsley Dumplings" from this site to make my turkey stock.  I also reduced the amount of butter/flour to 2/3 cup and used 1.5 cups of half and half.  The flavour was good, but the soup was very rich (you couldn't eat a lot of it) and the rice gave it a weird thickness that I didn't care for.  I might make it again and reduce the fattiness further and use noodles instead of rice.

I thought this soup was perfectly decent, but nothing fabulous. I might make it again. But then considering that we only have two people eating it. I have plenty to freeze and may not ever desire it after the four meals it will make us. Easy to make and cheap extras to use up scraps, so that is a plus.

Great soup!  I had TWO turkey carcasses to work with, and they made for a very flavorful broth!  I cut down the butter (and flour) by half and it didn't affect the decadence of the soup at all.  I added some broccoli and peas as well.  This is definitely a repeat, though I'll keep on tweaking it to make in more heart friendly!

This soup is AMAZING!! It is so nice to have a different turkey soup recipe. Most of them are just a broth based soup not cream. My husband and sister loved it. Perfect for those cold New York nights after Thanksgiving.

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't make my own broth from scratch, I just used chicken broth and it tasted wonderful.  Made a lot of soup and froze some for later.
Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recently using the carcass from my Thanksgiving turkey. I read previous reviews and added several vegetables: frozen broccoli cuts (16 oz), 4 cubed potatoes, and frozen sweet peas (20 oz). I omitted the onions (picky eaters), used skim milk in place of cream, didn't use the chicken bouillon granules, and added minced garlic. Anyway, great way to use up those turkey bones!!!

My family loved this soup. I would put in less onion and the carrots were still alittle too raw but other than this recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe and it was like eating white sauce - waaaay...too thick!
I had one bowl when it was finished and I had the worst indigestion ever.  To salvage this, I split it into thirds and added more sauteed vegetables(onions and celery and red pepper for color) and then let them "sweat" for 20 minutes in  chicken stock with herbs added for flavor.  I then added the soup portion to make a thick, but more soup like consistency. I also had to add salt to bring out flavor.
I had many compliments, but this adjustment made for THREE TIMES the original amount.  I would NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.

This turned out yummy, but I was tired of turkey by the time I made this. It's probably 5 stars...

Delicious!  I halved the recipe.  Since I had taken the meat off my turkey and frozen it, I had to make a few changes.  I used three 14-oz cans of 99% fat-free chicken broth instead of the broth from the turkey carcass.  Then I used about 4 1/2 cups of turkey meat.  We ate the soup in homemade bread bowls.  Next time I make it, I'll probably quarter the recipe (there's just the two of us, so it's a lot!).  I'd also add some spices and some more salt and pepper to give it some more flavor.

This soup was fabulous!!!  I figured it had to be with so many 5 star ratings, and I was right!  I cut the recipe in third because I only cook for 3 people.  A third of it makes about 4 good-sized servings.  The only substitution I made was whole milk for the cream.  The taste & texture of this is just perfect!  You must try it!

This was very good but I definitely will not add rice next time...made it gummy! I did add frozen peas and that was good. Husband had seconds and seemed to like it, but I was disappointed in consistency.

Great recipe!  I made changes others had suggested:  used part half & half and part 1% milk.  Medium pasta shells instead of rice.  Was making it for someone who can't have onion, so left that out and used extra carrot and celery.  Added a can of corn (drained) when I added the pasta.  It's a rich, full-bodied soup, more like a stew!  My husband liked it, too.

A wonderful hearty and comforting soup!  I finally decided to use my frozen Turkey carcuss from Christmas today and WOW  we are really enjoying this soup. Like others I had no half and half- so I just used 1% milk and it is still rich and yummy.  Thank you for sharing this. I served it with warm rolls and even the 5 yr old loves it!

This is the best turkey soup I've ever made.  My family loved it!  The only thing I did different was, my family is awful at eating veggies so I chopped all the veggies nice and small in a chopper and everyone loved it.

The best soup I have ever made!  I wasn't too sure about a creamy version of turkey soup but it was outstanding!! I added alot more celery as well as celery salt, garlic powder, sage.....just threw some stuff in as I went but season how you like, or not and this soup will knock your socks off!  My hubby and 3 picky boys complimented me after every bite!  Seriously yummy!!

I made this soup after Thanksgiving, using my leftover turkey carcass.  Mmmm, mmmm, good!  My whole family loved it, including my husband who doesn't care for soups.  He remarked that I could make this soup for him anytime!  I'm holding onto this recipe.   Thanks!

This recipe is very, very good. I highly recommend trying it once. My changes are slight. I was out of half and half so I used whole milk. I sauteed extra celery, carrots and onion in butter, added the flour, added the milk and mixed well. I then added the broth and it thickened nicely. I left out the rice (personal preference), and added the turkey. It was great and I will make again. My family loved it.

This was awesome - we loved it, even me that rarely enjoys soup.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, but added a few more spices.  I made it one night but kept it in the fridge until the next night and it turned out very well.

This is a great soup recipe!! My kids love it and ask for it often.  I did omit some of the butter and used some olive oil to saute the onions, carrots, and celery.  Definitely the best thing I've done with the leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

This was great, but ABSOLUTELY cut back on the butter & cream or you'll have the makings for a great turkey pie filling. I used 1/2C of each & it could have been less.  FLAVOR WAS GREAT.  Be creative - I used egg noodles & added peas.  YUMMY!  I highly recommend.

This was a wonderful way to make yet another meal from the leftover thanksgiving turkey. This soup was really yummy. I put homemade noodles in it instead of rice, which took more time and effort, but my family raved over how delicious it was.

It was very good however I think it came out a little too thick because of 1 cup of rice. When I told my friend what happened,he suggested to cook rice first and rinse the starch off in order for the soup not to get too thick.  I think  I will try that next time.

I thought that this was a really tasty soup and a great way to use up turkey from Thanksgiving.  I usually get tired of leftovers pretty quickly but I ate this one for lunch every day for 7 days and never once got tired of it!  The flavors are subtle but I find this kind of soup to be comforting.  It got better as leftovers and thickened a bit since the rice absorbed some more of the liquid.  Even my three-year old liked this and requested it the next day.  He never eats soup so that's really saying something!  I did make some changes to make it a little healthier and to suite our tastes.  I used a little bit of olive oil to saute the veggies instead of butter, fat free half-and-half, and brown rice.  I only used one large onion and added an extra carrot and an extra celery stalk.  When I make it again, I will add another carrot since I like alot of veggies.  I should note that I tried at first to cut back on the salt to one tsp since I had brined the turkey and was afraid that it might be too salty.  After tasting it, though, I felt that it needed the other tsp.

This was very good.  I added my left over gravy from the brined turkey and wow!  My husband said this was the best soup I've ever made.  I'll definately make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe was described and it was delicious!  
It is not too thick at all, but rather light for a creamy soup and a past reviewer must not have added enough broth.  I did add extra salt for my taste.

This recipe was definately a keeper with my family.  They were not at all excited about having Turkey ANYTHING after last week, but this really pulled it off.  I used Old Bay seasoning instead of Salt and Pepper, a tsp of crushed red pepper, and amish egg noodles instead of rice.  It was almost like a dumpling with the long and thick noodles.  I'll be using this recipe again next year!

Good soup!  And Philip - boil/simmer the carcass...remove it before adding the other soup ingredients.  Shred off as much turkey as you like for the soup.

Great soup, added ff half/half at the end.  Had to watch/stir it as rice wanted to stick.
My family including kids 12 & 8 loved this and had seconds.  We will make again and again.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe definitely improves 1-2 days after cooking.  It almost reminds me of a turkey a la king or a thickish gravy.

Because of that, the second day we had this soup overtop the leftover mashed potatoes and stuffing.  It was sheer heaven and I would definitely recommend it that way for a new option to the recipe.

My son said that this was the best soup I have ever made! I did, however, sprinkle some ground sage and thyme leaves as others suggested and doubled the rice. It smelled wonderful but to me it lacked something. I will make again but try adding something else.

Awesome soup!  Make it just like it is and it's great.  Add extra veggies, use less butter if you like, low fat half and half, whatever you want to do.  You can't go wrong with this one!!!
Chef quality soup made in your own kitchen!

This soup is delicious!!  I used fat free half and half, small bag of no yolk noodles, omitted the celery and added in peas as well as 1 garlic clove and granulated garlic.  My husband is not a soup eater, he could not get enough of this.  We ate it with beer bread.  2 2/3 cup of self rising flour and 12 oz. beer.  Mix till moist and bake at 375 for 55min.  Yummy.

I have not cared for turkey soups I have tried in the past. I tried this recipe. It is so thick and creamy and was the best turkey soup I've ever eaten. Hot buttered french bread and bowl of this is wonderful! It was well worth the effort.

This soup turned out wonderful.  My family was shoked at how good it tasted they said it tasted like a professional chef made it.

I made subs becuase I had no cream I used 1c. skim milk and 1c. of turkey gravy.  I also eye balled a lot of thing like the butter, veggies, and flour.  I used less butter and decrease the flour the same.  I increased the veggies and everything worked out great!

wow! this is my go-to soup for turkey leftovers. The thing I like most is that the cream base hides the cloudy soup and sometimes "stringy" turkey.    

The next time I make this I will however add an extra carrot and a celery stalk.  
I made a few modifications. 
I added  a few pinches of thyme, a shake of poultry seasoning,  some more chicken bouillon,  about a cup of peas and a cup of corn. Gives it some extra taste and colour.  
I reduced the flour to 3/4 cup.  
The rice measurement is perfect. 
(I sometimes don't measure the rice and freehand it, and usually over-do it which makes it overly thick and takes away from it so measure the rice accurately).
 Oh, and I also use 35% whipping cream instead of half and half. Yum. 
And add the cream at the end when everything is done, and gently heat- do not boil the cream with the veggies. 
Thanks you for this winning addition to my recipe box.
