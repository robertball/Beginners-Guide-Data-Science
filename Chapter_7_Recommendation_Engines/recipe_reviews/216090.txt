This is a delicious recipe with several changes.  We do not have the stomachs to be able to handle 9 tablespoons of chili powder!  Three was all we could do!  In addition, I used only about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I did use Ranch Style Pinto Beans with Jalapenos, though.  And THEN I followed the rest of the recipe.  We really did like it!  I will definitely make it again.  I need to--I have a boatload of masa harina to use up!  Thank you, Karen.  I salute you!  I admire anyone who can use that much HEAT!  :)

Karen, thanks for the recipe.  I also won first place with this chili.  How fun!!  I did alter it just a little.  I only put 7 tablesoons of chili powder and did not add extra salt.  I thought the pork was salty enough.  I also have tons of the Masa flour so will be making this chili agaiin!

Sooo Good... The only changes I made were only 3 tsp of chili powder and i add 1 tsp of brown sugar (brown sugar add a savory element).

At last! A recipe that is actually hot. Well done Karen, I've spent years looking for recipes from all over the world that are hot and spicy and this is the first one. Normally they say it is hot and it is not and I end up just adding more spices/chilli's/curry masala etc.  Highly recommended if you like the heat!

Very,very good recipe.  I added 1 red bell pepper, 1 green bell pepper, and 2 habanero peppers, and 4 jalapeno peppers as well as increasing the red pepper to 1 TBS.  Also added 1 quart of water.  We took this to a neighborhood chili cookoff, and it was the unanimous winner.  The heat was not overwhelming, but rather an afterburn.  A bit too hot for timid eaters, but for the spicy food fans, it was perfect!!!

We liked it less than some milder recipes, I enjoyed it with cheddar and sour cream over noodles, but my kids found it too hot.

This recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH CHILI POWDER AND SALT. I was thoughtful enough to only put 6 T chili powder, I wish I had been more thoughtful with the salt. I put 1 Tablespoon salt and we couldn't eat the chile! I will try the recipe again w/ 1 tsp salt!!

A tablespoon of salt? I only used 1 tsp and the chili was so salty we couldn't eat it.  Also very greasy, even after draining fat.  I did like the spice level though.  Might try again using no salt and 93/7 ground beef.

I entered a contest with 9 chili's and it took 9th place.  My suggestion would be omit the salt if you use the pork or add it only to tast it was the only thing I could taste was the salt.  I believe the chili powder could also be reduced because the receipe only makes 8 servings so 9 Tablespoons is to much which adds to the salt taste.

I didn't get first-came in 3rd :)  I changed only a couple things.  I left out the salt(personal preference) and added more chili powder, and cayenne pepper.  I added a few more tablespoons of corn bread mix.  Even though I only came in 3rd, people kept commenting that the thickness was great.  Next time, I want to experiment a little more-maybe with other beans.

This recipe was a hit at a Halloween party.  I took advice and only used half the chili powder and used a little pinch of red pepper. It was awesome. Had enough heat from that and the green chilies. Will make this again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My husband and I won second place in his fire department's chili cookoff!!  I had never made chili in my life!

Thank you for a recipe that wasn't too hot, yet had a little kick.  Everyone who tried and rated it said "This is how chili is supposed to taste, MEATY!"

I thought this was good.  I didn't make it spicy.  So only added 3 Tbsp. chili powder and not hot peppers.  For those who do like some spice I topped with some jalapeno peppers.  
I used this chili as a topping for french fries and cheddar cheese curds.  Chili poutine.

One of the few chili recipes out there with ground pork like my Mom used to make.  I did make 1 simple change to keep with Mom's traditions.  I traded out the tomato sauce for tomato paste and added a bottle of amber beer (minus a few gulps)!

It's good as is, but I added more heat. I grow ghost peppers and dehydrated a bunch. then I ground them up and put in a shaker. A few shakes and it was fire lol!

I've made this recipe several times and it is perfect every time! The only 2 changes I made was: omit the salt, as the chili powder is salty enough...and I use 3 tablespoons of chili powder instead of 9. Three is enough for my husband, and he loves hot food.
