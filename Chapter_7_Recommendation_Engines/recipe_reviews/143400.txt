We have been making our own vanilla for years. This recipe is a variation-we use 2 vanilla beans split and a bottle of brandy (we use a lot of vanilla!) When the bottle is finished we take out the beans and reuse them along with 2 new vanilla beans in new bottle. Once the old beans are 'finished' -whenever you decide they're finished- dry them out and cover them with white sugar and you'll have a jar of flavoured sugar. Forget the vodka-brandy is the way to go!

I have been making my own vanilla for about 3 years now but this is the first time I make it with something other than Vodka. I do not remove the vanilla beans I just keep adding to the bottle. I did use fresh beans in this bottle since my other ones are soaked in Vodka. This is good but I prefer using Vodka over the slightly sweet Brandy.

I have been making this for about 5 years. I use 2 beans and a bottle of brandy. I prepare about 99% of our meals from scratch am a pretty good cook. This combo has my vote.
