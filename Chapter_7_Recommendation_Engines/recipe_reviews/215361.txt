These cookies are very delicious, I make them for my boys who love chocolate chip cookies (trying my best to feed them healthier alternative to regular cookies).  The first time I made them, I didn't know that Elana's recipes don't come out right if I use "Bob's Red Mill's Almond Flour" and the cookies came out very greasy and crumbled all over.  They tasted good but they were not very pleasant to look at.  Since then I got her cookbooks and found out that she cautions people to not use Bob's Red Mills almond flour because they are courser in texture and don't work with her recipes.  She has recommendations on her website on which flour to use.  Since I switched my almond flour, they come out great.  Thought people might want to know since Bob's Red Mill is the most common brand in supermarkets.

This is great for people with multiple allergies. My friends like them when I skip the chocolate & almonds and make them like Thumbprint cookies with strawberry preserves!!

WOW! these cookies are delicious. Just found out I have gluten and diary intolerance so I have been looking for some good Christmas cookie recipes for me to enjoy. These are lovely. I cooked them on 350 for about 12-14 minutes, which gave them a chewy texture but kept them from being too fragile.

These cookies were even more delicious the next day! I am going to try and "tweak" the sweetness the next time I bake them, but my husband loved them and he doesn't even have a gluten intolerance! This recipe gives me comfort that I can still enjoy sweets.

These cookies have a wonderful flavor!!  I baked them for 9 minutes (the edges started to brown) at 350 degrees.  The recipe doesn't give a temp?  Anyhow, they seem gooey and  fragile so I'm wondering if a bit longer in the oven would do it?

Love the cookies!  I subbed 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  Glad I did not add the sliced almonds since these were very tasty with the omission.  Cooking time was @20 minutes.   Just sweet enough!**update - left out the choc chips and added cinnamon. delicious!

I had a hard time finding almond flour, so I substituted gluten free oat flour.  Worked perfectly and they turned out great!

Love the recipe - the first batch didn't even last 24 hours in our house.  Deliciously moist and so simple to make!

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of adding Â½ cup the grapeseed oil, and I kept thinking "this can't be right," but they came out PERFECT!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is my new favorite cookie! :)

This is a very tasting choc. chip cookies recipe using no sugar and no wheat flour.  I have a friend who is gluten intolerant and doesn't eat sugar and loves these.  I did bake them a tad longer (12 minutes).  Thank you for sharing this recipe, these cookies will take the place of regular choc. chip cookies in our house from now on.

This was okay and many got eaten, however the texture was very oily resulting in a delicate floppy cookie.  I will make them again and work out the kinks, love the idea behind the recipe.....just not great or presentable as it.

These did not work for me... It was the first time I had worked with almond flour so maybe I messed up, but it wasn't good.

These tasted good but were WAY too oily.  I would make them again, but next time I'll probably use half oat flour or something.  The almond flour just has too much fat.

nope, won't be making these again.  dough was way too thin and they spread out all over the pan. had to eat them with a fork.  imo, waste of expensive ingredients.

Not impressed with this recipe.  The taste wasn't too horrible, but it wasn't good enough to get me past the weird, gooey texture.  Probably won't be making this one again.
