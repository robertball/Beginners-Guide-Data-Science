Pretty good base recipe.  I did add about a 1/2 cup of salsa to spice things up a bit.  Also, instead of stirring in the cheese, I decided to throw the mixture into a baking dish and top off with monterey jack cheese.  I baked until the cheese was golden brown.

It was very tasty but I did add half a bag of frozen carrots and half a bag of frozen chopped broccoli to add some veggies to the dish.  The veggies did add some more flavor that went along great with the taste of the dish.

Very good!!  I added black beans, mexican, and jalapenos to add flavor and it worked out GREAT! I also added a little more rice then it called for but that is depending on if you like it kind of soupy or not. This was a great recipe and will be sure to use it again!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this. I added some frozen roasted peppers right before the rice and it really added to the dish.  It wasn't spicy so if you're interested in that you should definitely add more chili powder

I diced the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking.  In addition to the chili powder I added 1 tsp each of garlic & onion powders.  I also put in 1 can each of corn & green beans.  When finished cooking, I put everything into a 9x9 or 8x8 square baker, topped with cheese & baked @ 400 degrees for 15 minutes or so.

good but could use a little something. Would be good in a tortilla shell for a burrito.
