These recipe sounded interesting, so I thought I would try it. Except that I knew from the ingredients list I would have to "tweak" it quite a bit if anyone in my family was even going to consider eating these (definitely not intended to disparage either the recipe or the contributor, just my own family's idiosyncratic eating preferences). So I left out the stuff that we don't like (olives, skim milk, yogurt) and substituted stuff that we do like (celery, some green and red peppers, whole milk, reduced fat sour cream) for them. I also used 2 tbls. of applesauce and 2 melted 2 tbls. butter instead of the vegetable oil for shortening and I tossed some parmesan cheese and paprika into the batter, too. The result: The muffins turned out wonderfully in that they baked up nicely, were attractive in appearance and had a nice texture. Flavor-wise? I thought they were kind of "they are what they are; good, but nothing great". My husband's initial reaction was a quizzical expression and "strange" as a comment. And then he proceeded to eat 3 more muffins. My daughter said: "Wow, these are GOOD! Are we having them for dinner tonight?" And my son actually brought a friend over and told him: "You HAVE to try these things! They're great!" (and his friend agreed) I actually wound up making 2 more batches before dinner. I served these muffins with a tomato based soup and a tossed  salad, but make no mistake -- the MUFFINS  ruled the meal. (I gave this recipe 5 stars. Even though I tweaked it,

I love these! My daughter liked them as well. I substituted whole wheat flour for white and used white onions instead of green. I don't like olives so I added celery instead, so they were not salty at all. These will definatly be a keeper! 
Thanks!

I love tuna sandwiches, but I couldn't eat these muffins. I don't know if I did something wrong, but the muffins came out soggy, and if I had cooked them longer they would have been overcooked. 
I really wanted to like these, but they did not taste good.

A little salty, but if you like tuna you will like these muffins.  I doubled the recipe and got just 12 regular sized muffins.

I like the idea of this "muffin" and i usually make most recipes exactly as written, but this one just Screamed for graded cheddar on top (big plus) AND that help make them a little browner while cooking. I didn't put mine in muffin pans, i just scooped them onto a baking tray like scones. I would say the flavor is a little bland and could use a little seasoning...?? not sure what yet....?? any ideas? overall, a good start, but could use a bit of help still.

I really don't like tuna, but my husband loves it so i decided to try this recipe. He wasn't crazy about the muffins-he ate three of them because he was hungry but said it didnt think much of them. I was scared to even try them but they actually werent as disgusting as I thought. They reminded me of tuna casserole. So all in all, a so-so recipe. The best part of it was that my 1 year old really liked them, so i froze the leftovers for a quick, healthy lunch for her.

This is a great concept, and a good basic recipe to fiddle with.  I did not use olives, instead I used some finely diced green pepper and celery. I also added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I also used whole wheat flour. They came out really good. I can't help but think that there's SOMETHING missing, I just can't put my finger on it. I'll definitely make these again, and play around with the recipe more.
EDIT: I have now made these several times, tweaking it in various ways. Here is my favorite variation: Make according to recipe except: Use whole wheat flour, and toss in 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. For special effect, in the last 10 minutes of baking, sprinkle on some shredded cheddar cheese and paprika! I love these muffins!

To be honest, I didn't have high expectations of these muffins.  However, they did turn out pretty well.  I used whole wheat flour and had to substitute sour cream instead of yogurt, as that is what I had on hand.   I was impressed - and will make them again.

This idea was too fun not to try.  I reduced the oil to 1T and subbed sweet relish (my favorite part of tuna salad) for the olives, added a bit of dill and lemon zest and served with a bowl of roasted veggie soup.  After a few strange looks from my boyfriend he ate 6.

These turned out great! I didn't have olives, nor am I much of a fan, so I took Dawn's advice and used celery. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt (out of convenience). I was surprised at how flavorful they were and the texture was surprising as well. I wasn't sure what to expect, but they came out of the muffin pan very nicely and were dense, moist and had a very balanced flavor. Nice meal compliment or lunchbox snack. I'm gonna try them cut in half with a little bit of mayo. Thanks!!

These weren't a hit unfortunately. They turned out very dry, dense and heavy with not a whole lot of flavor. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

these were pretty good - and I hate canned tuna and olives. My only complaint about them is that they don't brown hardly at all.  I'll try making them for a potluck tomorrow and see what the reactions are then.

This is a recipe I will be doing again. Hubby was very complementary. I don't particularly like tinned tuna but found the muffins very palatable. I served them as a main meal with salad. I did change the recipe slightly. Instead of using tuna in water, I used tuna in a savoury onion sauce and that worked well. I also only cooked them for 15 mins.

This is for Karlee: I added different things to different "muffins" on the second try. I totally agreed with your cheddar cheese idea (thanks ;-)), but also the "needs seasoning" comment. Some experimental ones were REALLY good, the nasty bad idea ones I just won't mention... Your cheddar suggestion made me think about tuna melts, so I thought 'tangy tuna melt'. Added a few drops of liquid smoke & a dash of worcestershire. Another  w/the liquid smoke alone. Another w/just steak seasoning "McCormick Spicy Steak", & 1 w/smoke + McCSS. Another w/garlic salt subbed for the regular + couple dashes cayenne. Another with a few drops of sriracha. Another w/bacon pieces(precooked, Hormel). Made a gravy dipping sauce (I'm Southern, biscuits & gravy) w/ the tuna drainage. 1-2T unsalted butter, 1-2T ww flour. Make roux, use tuna "broth" to thin. Used whole wheat flour, splenda (blend,1/2&1/2) sugar, and rf cheddar. The calories are the same, even w/the gravy. All were fantastic and super filling. Healthy except for the butter...

If you want 12 you need to use a cupcake pan and not a muffin pan. Muffin pans yield 6. Made as stated except that I use reduce fat sour cream instead of yogurt. They are dense but I like that in a muffin but it does need something extra (maybe more salt or grating cheese). Just keep in mind you need 3 bowls for this recipe. If you don't mind the clean-up then this is a pretty good recipe, although not my favorite on this site.

I've made these three times now, the first time was VERY bland. No flavor. So the second time I added LOTS of onions, green peppers, etc. Still tasted bland. I made them one more time the same way, and thought about putting cream cheese ontop of them, my & my boyfriend absolutely love them that way! If you find them very bland you should try doing that!

Not very tasty. I read the reviews about it being bland and added a bit of pepper, some extra garlic but just didn't dig the texture.

it was very good! i made some of the suggestions the reviewers made and i was very satisfied.. and i'm kinda glad it didn't have a very strong fish taste :)  it really just tasted like herbed bread ..but the tuna kinda dried out in the fridge so remmeber to flake them completely!! but definatly a keeper though :)
