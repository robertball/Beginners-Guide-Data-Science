One small change: baked slightly covered at 350Â°F for 20 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 10 min. (too afraid to broil fish). Turned out PERFECTand is a definite keeper for my family!

This recipe is delish!  I added a dash of extra red chili flakes because we like spice.  Served with carrots and rice, and it was definitely a hit.

Great recipe! Not too heavy but enough for an evening meal.  We served it with egg noodles in a stir fry with springs onions.  Added a hint of tabasco as well to give it a little kick as didn't have any red pepper flakes.  I did find it difficult however to get the right balance between the soy sauce and the red wine vinegar - one kept overpowering the other, but the tabasco did seem to offset this.  Nonetheless a great recipe, perfect for salmon!

My family loved this simple salmon recipe.  The glaze gave the salmon excellent flavor without being overpowering.  I only needed to cook my salmon 10 minutes total, so be sure to keep an eye on it. I added glaze at 5, 7 and 9 minutes.

Yum Yum! I don't usually like fish, but this was really good. The leftovers are even better too as they've had more time to marinate in the sauce. I personally didn't notice the red pepper at all. Mine turned out really sweet, but that may be because I used dark brown sugar and not light and I didn't have any red wine vinegar (nor did the store), so I used red wine instead. This is a very easy recipe too, just prepare ahead of time and pop it in the oven when you get home. I had mine with mac'n'cheese. Not very classy, but yummy and pretty good for a college student ;)

I doubled the red pepper, and excluded the salt & cilantro b/c I abhor cilantro & rarely use salt.  I'm not sure that broiling would be my first choice as the fish came out a bit tough. However, I don't have a broiler with a low setting, only an oven with a broil setting. For that circumstance, I'd suggest 10 min or less total cooking time. I think it might worl well on a grill as well. The marinade was excellent & I'm thinking of trying it with beef or other fish as well.  Dirtying a blender is unnecessary. I got a whisk & was able to dissolve the sugar in the bowl I mixed it in in just a minute.

Made this w/ King Salmon..Yummo!  I added a little maple syrup (the real kind) & additional brown sugar.  (The soy smelled overpowering until I did that.)  This would also be great grilled, too.  It's a keeper but can be altered to suit tastes.

We tried this with Tilapia, we've never really made fish before so didn't know what to expect. My husband really liked it, I thought it was great right out of the oven but after a few bites didn't care for it very much at all.

This was delicious! Quick and easy to prepare and the marinade is fantastic. I did use fresh garlic as suggested by another reviewer and used the leftover sauce for bread dipping. Huge hit at my house and will keep this at the top of my repeat list.

I broiled the salmon as the recipe suggested but I found that the fish burned on the outside.  The inside, however, was delicious.  I think next time I will try baking the fish instead of broiling it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the cilantro as I don't care for it.

So delicious!  I doubled the recipe for a 3# salmon, and it was the first dish to be finished at our Christmas dinner.  Everyone commented how flavorful it was.

This was simply amazing!  Exactly what I was looking for in a great salmon recipe, and the pairings suggested were great.  I ate mine with quinoa prepared with garden vegetable broth and raw carrots, and it was filling and very tasty.  I made mine with a teaspoon of syrup instead of the brown sugar, spicy oil, and a splash of Pom juice.  Mine still had the skin, and I broiled it on High for about 10 minutes skin side down, and re-glazed it twice.

Simply ah-mazing!  Can't wait to do it again.

This is a great dish. My husband, who's not the biggest fish eater loved this and had seconds. Sure sign of a keeper recipe.  I marinated the salmon for about 1.5 hours and the flavor was great. We cooked the salmon on the grill in a pan with sliced baby portabella mushrooms (which we also marinated with the salmon). Was delicious!

This was so great! I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic, I think what makes this so delicious is the cilantro, olive oil, and the red wine vinegar. I was also very pleased with the broiling technique, great way to cook salmon! I think I will try a glaze and broiling technique similar to this for steak.

Absolutely delicious!  I cut down on the brown sugar and doubled the crushed red pepper because we like things extra spicy, and it was perfect.  I did the set up on my lunch hour and let it marinate for about 5 hours until I got home.  It turned out great!!  I served it with Japanese Style Sesame Green Beans also from this site.  Perfect dinner! Thanks!

Oh.My.Gosh.  This was delicious!!  I love the idea of cooking down the marinade to make a dipping sauce - it was wonderful.  I didn't have cilantro so I left that out.  I also left the skin on the salmon and marinaded it skin side up.  Absolutely a keeper.

This was just OK for me. I followed the recipe exactly (except I subbed pure maple syrup for brown sugar), and I thought the onion powder was overpowering. Plus I wasn't crazy about the cilantro with the salmon--and I love cilantro. I didn't find it to be spicy at all. Despite all my negatives, it wasn't bad; it just wasn't great. Thanks, anyway.

Our whole family loved this easy salmon recipe - even my picky eater LOVED it!  I baked it at 425 for about 20 minutes instead of broiling.

I have been looking for a healthier glaze for my salmon to try to get away from the high sugar teriyaki baste I have used for years. This was perfect. I actually subbed maple syrup for brown sugar and used fresh garlic and grilled the wild salmon on foil. Thank you!

This is one of the best recipes for salmon with salad, hot or cold it covers all the bases of texture, flavor and temperatures.  Sweet, tangy and earthy greens, we love it.

I did not use the cilantro, not a fan.  Outstanding flavor.  Used the marinade for pork and was just as good.

This recipe was great! I loved it! The sauce was just the right amount of flavor for the salmon, which I paired along side some mix veggies! With steamed white rice.

This is fantastic! I used a whisk instead of a blender, and the marinade still come out really good! I added a dash of cayenne pepper, because I really love spicy food. Also, my salmon filets were really thick, so I decided to bake them for about 15 minutes before I broiled. It came out perfectly. Can't wait to make this again.

I used a Thai Chili instead for a fresher spice. One gave it a very subtle bite. I prefer spicy, so I'll use 2 next time.

I liked this. Instead of garlic powder I added three cloves of garlic and instead of onion powder I added 1 cup of chopped onion. I reduced the water to make up for the water in the onion. I used agave instead of brown sugar.  I blended it up in a blentec using the sauce setting. I poured the mix into a pan and placed the salmon skin side up. I let it sit for about twenty minutes and put it in the oven. After about 25 minutes I turned the fish over and covered it with sauce from the sides of the fish. The sauce thickened up a bit  which was nice because it didn't run off the fish.  I baked for about 13 minutes longer and the sauce sort of carmelized a bit on the fish. I took it out to let it cool a bit went to check my email  (10 minutes) and when I got back it was completely gone, devoured by husband and hungry kids.

This was really easy to make. One of my favorites for salmon now.

We eat fish about 1 to 2 times per week, and I have made this recipe about seven times because my family keeps asking for it!!! Incredible flavor and just enough sweetness that the kids love it too. I put mine on the grill outside, but other than that make the recipe as is. Yum!

What a wonderful, and quite easy way to make salmon! It comes out tasting much different than your usual lemon/butter/garlic salmon, but still equally delicious. I did not have soy sauce on hand, so I used balsamic vinegar in its place (the closest thing I had to soy sauce in color, haha) and the salmon still turned out delicious. I will be using this recipe again after I buy some soy sauce and probably rating it 5 stars again :)

I was short on time, so I only marinated for 30 minutes, then baked this at 450F for 20 minutes because I didn't have a broiler pan.  Spoon the extra juices onto the plate for added flavor.  Serves well with sauteed spinach.

SO good! Flavor was perfect and the glaze was easy and light. Small changes: I used apple cider vinegar, didn't add the onion powder because I thought the garlic powder was enough (IT WAS), and baked covered for 20 mins at 350 and uncovered for about 10 mins. One of my favorites meals so far and I will definitely stick to it.

This was a fantastic recipe! The spicy/red pepper flakes didn't really kick in until 3rd or 4th bite, which made it very subtle and even more delicious. The major players (soy/vinegar/brown sugar) worked really well with the salmon - I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, but omitted the onion powder, only because I was out.  Served the salmon over cooked Basmati rice and broccoli and drizzled the remaining marinade over all on each serving.  This is a KEEPER!

Great glaze. We added cayenne pepper for the spicey factor and sesame seeds to the glaze. We sprinkled sliced almonds on top of the salmon before baking. We will use this recipe again.

I made a modified version of this. My wife has leaky gut so we  have to eliminate  and replace some of the ingredients.  .

We added some fresh ginger and ginger powder for extra flavoring.

I made extra sauce to cook some fresh broccoli and cauliflower in.

We added some imitation crab meat to the fish pan and then when we got down to finishing broiling the fish we added some vegi-cheese on top. Turned out so great!!!

This salmon was awesome and so flavorful.  I used parsley as I did not have any cilantro on hand but the taste was still very good. My salmon pieces had the skin on but again no change to the taste as I marinated the pieces top side down.  I automatically broiled on high and it cooked in about 8 minutes.  Making again today and will use cilantro and broil on low. I had this with Portobello mushroom/spinach sautee (side dish also from this site).  Together they were excellent. 
 Definitely a keeper!

I roughly followed the marinade (I eyeball things like this) and the flavor was excellent. Family loved it. I made it in a cast iron skillet, with the skin on. First I browned the salmon skin in olive oil, then added 3/4 of the marinade. When salmon was done, I removed it, poured in the rest of the marinade, and simmered til thick. Then I strained the sauce and drizzled over the salmon, then topped with a little chopped cilantro.

Cooking it this way was just easier for me. I didn't feel like heating up the oven. I also didn't marinate the salmon at all, but I will next time.

So my rating is for the flavor of this marinade/sauce. It's excellent!

Loved it! I didn't have time to marinate for 2 hours, but I put the salmon in a casserole dish and poured the mixed ingredients over it. Loosely covered with foil and baked for 20 minutes. Removed foil and cooked for an additional 8 min. It was amazing! The best part was the juice that I spooned over the salmon and jasmine rice! I'll definitely make again- hit for the whole family!

I halved this recipe because I only had .8lb fish. Added some fresh ground ginger (~1 t) X'd the onion powder. Used fresh garlic. Added extra sugar. TASTED JUST LIKE HIBACHI!!!!

Tried this tonite.  While I liked it,  unsure if I'll make it again or not.  Gave the salmon a zesty flavor.  Only thing I'd change is to use less vinegar.  I thought it was a little "biting.".   Best part was that it smelled wonderful while it cooked!

I ended up grilling the salmon about 5 min per a side on medium.  It turned out very well.  My picky eating children loved it.  I will make it again for sure.

I made it once with the cilantro and once without, and I will definitely not use the cilantro again.  IMHO the cilantro muddied the flavor.  Otherwise this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Best marinade yet for salmon.  I thawed Simply Balanced skinless wild keta salmon fillets in the marinade in the refrigerator all day and we grilled them for dinner.  No fishy type taste, just delicious!

Loved it!  Made with amberjack, I think this would be good with all kinds of fish.  Reserved half the marinade to brush on fish after roasting because I don't like using the same marinade used for the fish.

My husband and I loved this.  The only thing I did different was to not use the cilantro.  Didn't want to buy a bunch for just a small amount.  I like cilantro and may someday try it with that.

Wonderful and easy recipe! Added a bit more red pepper flakes for a tad bit more spicy flavor. Served this with arugula dressed in a red wine vinaigrette and mini San Marzano tomatoes with cubed avocados. Tasted delightful!

Really great recipe, I marinated it overnight, just left the lemon juice out until an hour before cooking as I didn't want to cook the salmon while it was marinating. Letting it marinate for 24 hours really brought out the red wine vinegar flavor. Served it over brown rice with some steamed broccoli and it was a delicious, healthy dinner.

This was a simple marinade that worked really well with Salmon. It didn't overpower or mask the taste of the fish but added a nice flavor. We will use this recipe again.

Very tasty, even my son who isn't too fond of fish found it to his liking.  I subbed out the cilantro for fresh grated ginger and elected to bake it rather than broil, as one of the other raters had done. Served it with rice and steamed fresh vegetables from our garden. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Great grilled! If you're tempted to throw out the marinade instead of using it as a dip too, don't.  it was excellent!  We can't wait to have this again.  This time I'll try it broiled.

This recipe was delicious the only thing I changed were the ingredients I didn't have so I used rice vinegar, sage, and minced garlic. The only thing I would change is the amount of oil...definitely will be making this again!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  Everyone I have ever made this dish for has loved it.  This recipe is great just the way it is, but you might want to add extra red pepper flakes if you like a lot of spice.

This is the best Salmon recipe I have ever tasted! It was fast, easy and everyone raved about how good it was. We just had salmon at a well know restaurant and paid a lot for it and this was sooo much better! Thanks for posting it
