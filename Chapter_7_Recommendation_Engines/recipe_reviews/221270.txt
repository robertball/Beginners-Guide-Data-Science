This was DELICIOUS!  Lots of flavour!  I googled "red curry powder" and made my own.  Into my favourites...

This is INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!  I love the spices so I add extra garlic and double the cilantro and curry. I've only been cooking for the past year and I'm still blown away every time I prepare this dish.  My friends love it when I share with them; This recipe makes me look like an amazing chef!  Thank you so much Chef John!!  More healthy recipes like this please!!

I loved this recipe.  Have made coconut curries many times before, but this was particularly good.

I used skinless thighs to reduce the fat. I also used coconut oil to fry them in beforehand.  I chose green beans for the veg and they were great.  I also used a popular curry paste.


Making it again tonight. I will be using a green curry paste this time.  And cod and shrimp instead of chicken.  I will also include Sweet potato with the green beans.

Because we like it hot, and the kiddo does not, I make the curry sauce saving about a cup.  I blend this with the jalapeños and heat in a small pan separately.  When serving we just add a big spoonful of this superheated sauce for heat and flavor.

This was one of my first attempts at curry and it was delicious! I used 15 chicken legs and left out the sweet potatoes and eggplant.  I didn't increase any other of the ingredients and it was plenty of sauce. Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh cilantro, so I substituted a tsp of dried coriander. My super picky 8 year old even asked for seconds! After the chicken legs were gone, I cubed a few sweet potatoes and a pound of boneless, skinless  chicken breasts and made a soup using the remaining sauce. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank you Chef John!

Made this tonight for my family of four including a picky 5 year old and 1 year old - everyone liked it.  I only added one jalapeño so it wouldn't be too hot for the kids.  I couldn't find McCormick's red curry powder, so I used a tablespoon of red curry paste (Mae Ploy brand), and I didn't add any basil leaves.  For veg, I used 2 white potatoes, a can of baby corn, brown mushrooms and sliced red pepper.  I used cane sugar, just because. I'll make this again, the sauce is such a good base. I served it with jasmine rice. I think next time I'll use chicken breast or chicken thighs. Just a preference, because even after crisping it, it ended up soggy in the final product and I don't enjoy picking skin out of my bowl.

This was the best recipes I've made from this site. Amazing!!! We love the green curry beef from the local Thai place and we've been craving it. Well, no need to crave again. I followed the recipe pretty much all the way except: I used 4 legs and 4 thighs (still had plenty of sauce), my store didn't have Thai basil so I had to use regular. What I'd change: we like it spicy so I'm going to leave the seeds in 1 or 2 of the jalapeños, more ginger (I wish the amount noted in the recipe was more specific)  I'd change nothing else. The sweet potato and eggplant were delightful. I'm going to try this with beef next time. Definitely a keeper

FANTASTIC flavor!    Took longer than 25 min on prep time.  So next time I'm going to triple the recipe and freeze!    My husband couldn't stop eating it. Next time skin needs to come off!

I think the eggplant and sweet potato kind of stole the show, and the red curry made the dish look a lot less green. I may try this again and modify it a bit. Wasn't bad, just wasn't as great as I was expecting.

This was very good!I used 2 jalapenos because I was concerned it would be to hot for my kids. It was perfect for them and the hubby really liked it too. We had it on brown rice, next time I will use Basmati.

This was excellent & I would make it again.  I couldn't find red curry powder at either of 2 markets, so I used the same amount of red curry paste (Thai Kitchen brand) instead.  I also cut back to 1 jalapeno because I wasn't sure how spicy the paste was compared to the powder.  I would probably try 2 jalapenos next time to get a little more heat - we generally go with "medium" spicy at Thai restaurants.

This was delicious!  I used chicken thighs because it's what I had on hand.  I think when I make it again I'll take the skin off just to reduce the fat.  I used low fat coconut milk (even though the video says not to) and did not have any jalapenos on hand.  Still, it was really yummy and I'll definitely be making it again.  Next time on a warmer day when I can open the windows because this is definitely strong smelling when cooking but don't be put off by the smell, the end result is fantastic.  The flavour is really complex, a must try!

I made it as is but used chicken breast instead of legs.  Wonderful, will definitely make again!  Should double the sauce next time to have enough for rice or rice noodles.  Thank you!

This recipe is delicious! I substituted the chicken breasts for chicken legs and a red pepper for the eggplant. I also added 1/2 of the suggested amount of cilantro. Turned out great!

Disappointed. If I were to make this again, I would completely leave out the sweet potatoes and the eggplant.  They add nothing to the dish but instead clash with the rest of the ingredients.  Also would not add water.  I felt that it was too diluted.

Loved this dish as someone else mentioned I used the red curry powder recipe from the sight.  Used diced chicken breast and regular potatoes and 1 Tbls of mined Jalapeño from a jar. This recipe has great flavor for those who don't like eggplant u really can't taste it in this dish!

I love this recipe and use it all the time. Thank you Chef John. I used boneless thighs this time and it was amazing. I used a serrano and 2 jalapenos with seeds as we like it very hot. Wow was that good. I will be having some for lunch today...cant' wait.

Very Good. My boyfriend doesn't like spicy so I substituted a milder pepper and could not find the Red Curry powder so I added 1 rounded TBSP of red curry paste. I would also use boneless chicken thighs next time. I used zucchini, sweet potatoes and Jasmine rice and it worked out great. Definitely a repeat!

It was definitely good but not amazing.
This might be because I used red chilli paste instead of red chilli powder, which apparently have very different tastes. 
Also I put zucchini instead of eggplant since my boyfriend doesn't like eggplant, not sure if that changed the flavouring too?

I had a lot of eggplant in my garden so tried this.I would not recommend using  3 jalapeños. Mine came out way too hot and i think one would be better or add more after tasting . Other than that, great recipe
with lots of flavor.

This was an interesting melting pot meal. I think I'm finished cooking. I started about three hours ago, but it's all worth it at the end. Very unique and flavourful. I kept trying to make it work without the red curry, but it wasn't right until I gave in. Resistance is futile. Good job!

Loved the wonderful flavors of this dish.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and used a Tablespoon of the squeeze ginger and 2 heaping tablespoons of the minced garlic in a jar....yeah, yeah, I know.  I nuked the sweet potato chunks and eggplant to soften them up before adding them in to the mixture.  I could live off this dish!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe.  The chicken seemed plain and everything else was just okay. I would suggest trying with sliced chicken breast.

I used boneless / skinless thigh and poblano peppers. My sauce was on the brownish side, but I think it's because I browned chicken and the onions in the same dutch oven. Outstanding dish!

This dish was ok. I was expecting more flavor in it. This was the second Thai dish I've made that didn't really have much flavor in it. What I will say though that it tasted better the next day after the flavors merried. I most likely won't make again.

Mine tasted so bland. Next time I will probably keep the seeds from the peppers in the mixture for more spice.

I'm literally a young cook and I love exotic (non American or European) food, this by far was one of my favorite. I ended up skipping taking the fat out when boiling the chicken with the green mixture as to not miss out on so much of the floating girth of the mixture. I also added a little extra eggplant and also I added fresh cod from the downtown fish market. Couldn't have turned out better! Kudos chef John!

As always, Chef John does not disappoint with the flavor profile created by this dish. It has just enough of everything to meld together and make up a wonderful taste that keeps going way after you finished your last bite. I used chicken tenders instead because we're a bit fat conscious right now, and even though I know the flavor of the dish would have been enhanced by the extra fat and the meat on the bone , it still came out delicious because of the amazing sauce.
