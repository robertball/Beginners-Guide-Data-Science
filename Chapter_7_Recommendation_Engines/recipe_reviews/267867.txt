It was a good idea, however the apples split too much and did't hold together.

This was delicious!!!  I made this for breakfast and then added ice cream. ha!  I had smaller apples
So wasn’t able to get the fan effect because I would have cut all the way through the cored part. Because I was afraid I’d break the apples in half- I  wasn’t able to stick the raisins inside so I added them to the topping.   Instead of the apple juice I used cranberry lemonade that I had on hand.  The streusel is delicious.  With ice cream it goes over the top!   I’ll make this for dessert.   It’s a winner.
