I found this recipe on January 11, 2018 as I was looking for an "old fashioned" sourdough bread recipe. I had begun a starter on January 1, before I found Chef John's starter recipe, and have used that starter.  I have already made this recipe four times using bread flour, and twice using a combination of whole wheat and bread flours. Each time turned out great, and I live above 5,000 ft. I do not have a bread form, and have used a bowl sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with corn meal. I like the looks and taste of corn meal with this simple bread, so no problem for me. This is a lovely addition to an "interesting breads" collection. Thank you for a tasty, simple recipe.

This recipe is so versatile.  Sometimes I add oats for half the flour and it still works out GREAT.  I have  added dry orgino and or basil, still perfect.  Today I'm trying adding CHIA SEEDS.  I have made this recipe as is many times I can't count.  I do like to hold back on the salt to keep it from being too salty for my taste.  Other than that, aside from the time it takes to make, it is a wonderful bread that everyone who has tasted it so far loves it.  The aroma from the bread is mouth watering!

I first made this, starter first, when chef john first posted it.  And I must say the starter definitely improves with age. The bread itself is great, but over the year or so I've been experimenting and found that substituting 100 grams of the water with buttermilk produces a much more satisfying bread for my taste. This may have to do with the youngness of my starter, or the area I live in, who knows. But I'd give the recipe as stated 4 stars and the adjusted recipe 5 stars.

I finally got bread with lots of holes in it ! I even folded some raisins in. Other than that I made this recipe with the exact measurements. I used a steel bench scraper to manipulate the sticky dough. I didn’t refrigerate it but let it stand in the banneton overnight in my cold kitchen about 55-60 F. It looked like it hadn’t risen at all. I put it in a warm toaster oven for 30 minutes. I heated my ceramic pot with lid on in a 450F oven. Placed the dough in the hot pot scored it like # a hash tag and replaced the hot lid. Quickly placed the pot in the oven. Baked for 20 minutes at 450F (although temp wavers with opening of oven door. ). Lowered heat to 400F baked for 20 minutes more. I got a nice ear on the dough too.

Really pleased with how the bread turned out. Nice crust and very tender insides with perfect holes. We ate half the loaf in one sitting. Followed the recipe exactly except did an extra “folding” (did it twice instead of once during the first rise). Easy to make, you just have to plan your time.  Definitely will make again.

I tried following the recipe but kept ending up with a much too wet dough. It was more like making slime than bread dough. So added flour, a lot more flour until it got back to being a dough and let it slow rise in the fridge. the bread comes out super creamy the first day.  The second day it becomes much, much denser. So I toasted it.  It was better than those quick sourdough recipes, but not yet where I want it to be.

This is the best bread I have ever made.  I had been experimenting with sourdough for over a year before I tried this and had lots of failures.  I like using a bit less water than he uses so the dough is a little bit sturdier - not much though, the moistness of the fresh loaf depends on it.  I tried something different last time and came out with a nice dough.  I made the dough before bedtime, and let it rise overnight on the counter, then shaped it and let sit in the fridge for several hours and baked as directed in CJ's  recipe.  Maybe it was a great sourdough day, but it was the best loaf I've made to date.

Love it, made several times.
Made a tomato bread off this site using the starter, also  cinnamon rolls. Love the sourdough  tomato bread  ( include paste, basil and Sundried tomato) the sourdough taste with the sweet cinnamon rolls was not something we like. Like my cinnamon roll recipe better. We really enjoy this recipe for bread.

The longest part is just making the starter!! Now that I have that I make this all the time.

Very easy directions to follow. Weighing the ingredients was great and the recipe turned out just like it should. I cook mine for 32 mins and it turns out nice and crispy.  25 mins was like, JUST cooked. A baker friend of mine suggested using a cast iron pan lined with parchment if you have it available.

TIP 1: if you're going to substitute the banneton with a kitchen cloth make sure that it is VERY tightly knit fabric. Nothing like towel fibres  or else  your bread will stick. Think more like a handtowel or tablecloth fabric.

TIP 2: Its important to shape your loaf into a ball by pulling the sides into the middle as you turn the loaf. Watch YouTube. This will create tension on the surface of the ball and help it rise really well.

Awesome!
It's a sloppy, messy dough but it makes an amazing loaf of sour dough I am proud to serve. With wet hands I have found it easy to work with.
Thanks Chef John

Sometimes if i want a stronger sourdough flavor, i would add some extra sourdough starter, and I have also added herbs for flavor.

Absolutely worth the wait! This was my first time making sourdough bread out of a bread machine. We devoured half of it in the first day. I did make one small change. I used 250grams of starter and 150g of water because my starter is fairly new still. And it turned out perfect!

I'm a newbie to sourdough but thanks to Chef John, I've followed his video and have now made this bread multiple times. So good! I've also added some garlic powder, onion powder and fresh herbs such as rosemary and thyme to the dough for a bit of a different taste.  Great for dipping in an olive oil/garlic mixture!

You’re the man, Chef John. Eventually I’ll  get the hang of it. By the way, golf score cards don’t have a picture on them? I can’t figure that out. Thanks for making the video.

Good recipe, and very little work.  I used my own starter that I've been feeding for months.  It's made with just all purpose flour.  I'll probably start feeding it some bread flour and some spelt if I come across some.  I was afraid it might be a little too dry because my starter is not 50/50 by weight, but the bread came out very good.  I'm about to make it again.  I'm wondering if it matters if the starter is cold from the fridge when starting the bread.

Update:  I've made this three times so far, and it seems to me that each loaf is better than the previous one.  I'm going to keep my starter feedings at 50/50 from now on.  This recipe is forgiving too.  If you take it out of the fridge planning to make it that day and something comes up you can put it back in the fridge again and make it the next day, and it's still fine.  I've made minor screw-ups every time and it's still great bread.   I still haven't bought a banetton or rice flour but this bread is deserving of the expense.

Great crust.  Beautiful loaf of bread.  Texture of the bread was fabulous.  I have a young starter and the bread was a little mild.  (My personal preference would be a little more sour, my 15 year old daughter is still talking about about the bread two days later.  She LOVED IT.)  Now, I am just trying to make my starter a little more sour.

Loved it.  Nice flavor from a simple dough.  Chewy crust.  Soft, tender center with a light airy crumb. 
 I went looking for a recipe for my 1st sourdough starter that didn't have a lot of ingredients and didn't call for commercial yeast.  Why would I go through the trouble of nursing a starter just to hurry it along with the store bought yeast?   I used APF, like I do for all my breads, formed it in a parchment paper lined bowl and baked it in a Dutch oven using the parchment paper as a transfer tool.  Gotta get a couple more loaves made.  The grandkids are coming over and all 3 of them are bread lovers.  Thanks Chef John.

My sourdough culture took 3 weeks to mature, more than 10 days. But once it got there, this is a great basic recipe. I just learned I needed to wait until the oven is hot until I take the bread out of the bowl, otherwise the bread spreads too much. Also I don't have rice flour so I just used AP flour. It was fine.

I am fairly new to sourdough bread but i have made chef Johns sourdough bread several times.The flavour is great but i find that the dough spreads out too much when i use a sheetpan.I cant wait for my new Emille Henry bread baker,hopefully this will make the bread keep its shape better. I do proof my bread in a banneton but as soon as it comes out,it loses its shape.

excellent sourdough recipe.  I used our Dutch Oven to bake ours, and it came out with lots of holes and excellent texture

I was very worried because I keep my house cool, and we have serious humidity right now, but I think it came out great! After waiting 2 weeks with the starter, then beginning to make this last night, I’m dying for a slice!! The cool down is taking FOREVER! pretty easy recipe. I only made one because I wanted to see how it did, but I see multiple loaves in the future!

I made the starter and the bread over the course of about two weeks. The bread turned out fantastic, however it was really dense and doughy. When I pulled it out of the refrigerator to warm to room temp and rise it did t really change at all. So the flavor and texture is there but the bread is super dense and heavy.

Best sour dough bread I have ever had & it was worth the four days it took to make it from beginning to first bite.  Only changes were using a stainless steel bowl in place of a Banneton, baked it in a stainless steel large skillet lined with parchment paper, bottom sprinkled with cornmeal.  I looked at a lot of different recipes and this seemed to be the best and it was.  I will definitely be making it again ....

Great recipe! I formed the loaf and put it in a buttered loaf pan to sit in the fridge over night. Took it out at 7am and let it rise at room temp. until noonish. It made a great sourdough sandwich loaf.  I'll try dry cured olives in the dough next time.

I started off being a little intimidated by the amount of time, as well as number of times this dough has to proof, but it wasn't as bad as I first thought, and it turned out well.
I made it just as directed, and I will make it again.

Awesome bread, and a much easier recipe to follow than several others I have tried. Takes a bit of advanced planning to get the timing to fit a busy schedule, but so worth the effort. Thanks Chef John, once again you’ve posted another winner,

There is nothing better than fresh baked bread.  For me sourdough is the ultimate in delicious bread.  This recipe provides a beautiful chewy crumb and a fantastic crunchy crust.

This the first time I’ve tried making sourdough bread.  Given the positive responses to my effort my only regret is that I didn’t make two loaves.  It takes time to make this but not much effort as the bread “babysits” itself.  It works well and we are all pleased with the results.

I have searched for a sourdough bread that was not a dense as others with better holes.  I had almost given up but decided to try one more.  Why not?  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the finished loaf looked just like the bread pictured.  Success after God only knows how much time, effort and flour.  Chef John, you are my hero!!

As I live in a tropical climate, getting the first 4-hour fermentation at 22 C was not easy.  Next time, I plan to leave it at room temperature for a shorter duration, but leave the overnight refrigeration period and the second rise period as is.   The bread was flavorful, although slightly more sour than expected.  I need to figure the temp / rise times out.  The family loved it though!

This came out wonderful! I used Einkorn flour so my bread was a little more dense and didn't rise very high. There were still lots of bubbles and a lovely chewy texture. I had to add more flour, Einkorn can be persnickety, but will continue to practice until it''s perfect! I had to add about an extra cup of flour.

I followed the recipe exactly. I had to make two attempts on the starter but mine is crazy active now. 

I’m a beginner bread maker so the feel of dough is not intuitive yet. I was surprised how soft the dough was after proofing in the baskets. 

Still, I got great crust and a really open, bubbly bread. 

The sourdough taste was not as strong as I expected but I think that’s because I started after only 6 days on the starter. It’s noticably more pungent two days later.

Tastes like sourdough! I only let it do the first fermentation and let it sit overnight instead of 4 hrs.  I couldn't wait the next risings bc I really wanted it tonight.  I made loaves not one loaf, thus it does not look like much. Texture is nice and chewy outside. My in-laws loved it!

All was going well until I put it in the fridge overnight. It never rose again. Total failure. I should have just baked it after the 2nd rise.

This sourdough was simply great! I’ve made it a total of 3 times and found you neither need to fold or do any of the steps following the mix of ingredients as long as you let it proof at room temp for basically a whole day. I took it out in the morning before work and cooked it the following day after work so 32 hrs? Tasted just the same as following all steps. Thanks again Chef John!

The recipe was ok. The only thing I did different was I forgot the salt and I cooked it in a dutch oven. I had an issue with it being too liquid when baking and it spread really bad and my score marks weren't even visible when it finished cooking. It was very dense beforehand so there was no indication it was too wet. I don't think that'd be from the lack of salt. It didn't really rise much either. It was bread and it was edible, but I was disappointing with the recipe.

I followed this recipe almost to the T and experienced a great loaf of bread. My only variation was to use my existing starter which is fed with equal parts water & AP flour.  Many sour dough bread recipes are very fussy with too many intermediate steps. This recipe is low touch and simple to follow.  I appreciated Chef's demonstration of applying a generous amount of rice flour to the banneton. I have had other sourdough recipes stick to the banneton even though I used rice flour - now I realize it takes more than a dusting of rice flour to have the dough release easily.  The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is that it does not have a pronounced sour dough flavor. But the texture is great and flavor is great.  Thank you Chef John.
Dec 3 - I made this same loaf a 2nd time with two changes. This time used 10% rye flour and 90% KA bread flour. Once again the bread is great. The rye caused the crumb color to be a little darker with minimal improvement on flavor. Also I don't think that the bread rose as high with the rye flour. The first time I made this loaf,  I overlooked spraying the crust with water . So I did include that step this time but I did not notice any change to the crust.  Next time I will go back to 100% AP flour and eliminate the water spray. But this loaf will  be part of the  recipes we use on a regular basis.

This was a fun project. I enjoyed observing the starter transform from the nastiest foot odor sludge to quite sweet and pleasant.  The resulting bread was good, though not the best I've ever had.  I will chalk it up to our inferior Midwestern yeast.  Glad I tried it.

Began with my own starter.  Interestingly I did not feed it before starting this recipe. Followed the directions to a T and the entire loaf was eaten instantly by thieving family.  
 Great crust. Great chew.  Overall a superb bread.
