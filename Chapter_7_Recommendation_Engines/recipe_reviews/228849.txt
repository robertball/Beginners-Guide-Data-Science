Very good recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and it went over well with my company. However, I didn't need to throw the potatoes in a slow cooker as my cooking plans changed and a holding pot wasn't necessary. Now, I have a question. Why do people have to leave such cranky reviews about a good recipe that they might not have even tried?? The poor reviews really knocked the rating down unnecessarily, and I'm really sick of reading snide, "know-it'all" reviews wherever I go on the internet. This recipe was intended for those who had too much cooking to do and needed a way to make it ahead without having to reheat the dish. Who cares if I have to wash something extra? If a recipe doesn't appeal to you, please just move on to something that does without ruining it for those who might want to try it. This was a wonderful idea and a good recipe. Thank you!

I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I did also add a good amount of fresh snipped chives. I served these with salisbury steak--the family ate almost the whole thing in one sitting. Delicious!

I like making a big batch of mashed potatoes like this because I freeze some of them in qt sized freezer bags. Thaw out a bag, put in a sauce pot over a very low flame and stir a few times and you would think they were just made. I also add a couple of bay leaves and black pepper to the salted water when boiling them. I scrub mine well and leave the skins on before cutting and boiling then mash with a hand masher because I like chunky skin on mashed potatoes. Also I swap out the chicken broth and use half and half. I know, rich but what the heck, very comforting and we don't eat them every day. Whenever there is a family get together I always get asked to bring "your" mashed potatoes.

I made these for our Thanksgiving in September gathering and well, let's just say.....what is not to like? You obviously don't make these if you are counting calories - you do make them if you are looking for a great make ahead, full of flavor, delicious side dish to any special meal.

Perfect for Thanksgiving. I used yellow potatoes instead of red,and I should not have. Next time I will use the red, or a firmer potato. They came out a little runny because they just weren't firm enough.Overall the dish was really good and a huge stress reliever because I didn't have to boil/mash the potatoes and try to get the turkey out all at the same time. I will make them again for next Thanksgiving.

I have been making a version of these potatoes for years. I use french onion soup dip instead of sour cream and do not add chicken broth or so much butter (just a few pats on top of potatoes when they get baked). I also have never tried them in the crock pot. I just make them ahead and put them in the oven with the rest of the side dishes. I have also made them frequently without the cream cheese and just added some milk to make them creamier and somewhat healthier. If you have the room in your oven, I don't know why you'd dirty another dish to put them in the crockpot.

Made mashed potatoes for the first time ever using this recipe for our thanksgiving dinner.  Had to make them the day before and then take them to my mom's so the slow cooker worked out perfectly.  Some other comments made me worry about getting too watery so I only used half the chicken broth figuring I can add more the next day if needed, but it wasn't needed.  I only cooked for about 2 hrs the day they were made then day of high for an hour and low for an hour, adding the melted butter after turning to low.  Good news was they turned out great, bad news is now its my job every thanksgiving from here on out.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written and used the towel under the lid trick, but after putting these into the crock pot, they turned to thick soup.  Delicious soup, but still soup.  No one complained, and in fact, they all complimented me on how delicious they were.  The only deviations I made from the recipe was to mash the potatoes with a manual potato masher instead of whipping with an electric mixer, so they were more chunky than whipped.  Plus, I prepared the potatoes the night before Christmas and refrigerated them overnight.  Maybe that is where the excess moisture came from. This is a total winner taste-wise as a mashed potato recipe, so I'll continue to work with it.  The benefit of last minute prep prevention is worth further experimentation with this recipe.

Made this tonight, and it turned out pretty good.  You can taste the cream cheese and sour cream, which makes it yummy. I only added 1 cup of chicken broth and doubled the butter, I put it back on the stove top on low heat after I used the electric mixer, for about 30 minutes, and it turned out the perfect consistency to go alongside our meatloaf :)

I used this recipe in 2013 for Thanksgiving, trying to make my dinner-making easier for me. It was a HUGE help and everyone absolutely RAVED about the potatoes! Remember the paper-towel trick, though. It made the day simpler and yielded fantastic-tasting mashed potatoes.

This is a good recipe for mashed potatoes but I made a few changes. I  used the low fat cream cheese and fat free sour cream to save some calories. Make sure your cream cheese is room temperature and cut it up into chunks which makes it easier to mash into the potatoes. I used vegetable broth to make this dish vegetarian and only ended up using 3/4 cup (half the amount in the recipe). I also only used my manual potato masher and it worked fine. For the butter I only used 1/4 cup and cut it in pats to put on top of the potatoes in the crockpot. Delicious!

Meh. Not bad but definitely not the best mashed potatoes I've ever made (hubs agrees). I much prefer BWAYE's slow cooker mashed potatoes. Even after adding a LOT of s&p, these were super bland and had absolutely no garlic flavor. I think I'll stick with our favorite recipe from now on. Thanks anyways Alley.

Easy to follow and really, really creamy.  Everyone at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner gobbled these down.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.

I made my usual make ahead Sour Cream Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes (from allrecipes.com), which is very similar to this, but did the slow cooker thing per this recipe.  Somehow only managed to get in slow cooker 2 hours ahead but it needed 3 hours.  Will definitely keep this in my Recipe Box!

We added granulated garlic to increase the flavor.  Everyone loved them.  We used leftovers first for the crust of a turkey potpie and later for mashed potato patties simply by adding eggs and flour.  So good.

Excellent & easy to make. I don't use as much sour cream or chicken broth as it called for but only because we don't like our potatoes that thin.

The only thing I changed was to leave the skin on the potatoes. Red potatoes, especially have a great flavor with the skins, plus when you serve it with prime rib, the color and texture are perfect! These have become a large crowd favorite!

My family loved these amazing potatoes, and I definitely will make again at Thanksgiving.  Followed recipe as written, no changes!

I didn't include the sour cream and had access to white baking potatoes.  Great reviews by all. Served with grilled steaks and balsamic glazed carrots.  Will certainly use again and again for company dinners. Love the ease of making ahead then re-heating a few hours before serving.

Delicious! I always make mashed potatoes with russet potatoes, so I did that this time, as well.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I used "Better than Bouillon" refrigerated chicken base along with some water and no added salt.  I forgot to add the margarine/butter at the end, but it was still yummy.  I loved that I could make the mashed potatoes ahead of time, since we had dinner guests.

Will make these again and again.  Just mixed them up today ahead of time for Christmas day and they taste awesome!   Family tasted them too and they are a hit.  Made as per the recipe.

I made this exactly as it is written except I used only a manual potato masher.  I added the broth gradually and mashed and stirred after each addition until the broth was thoroughly incorporated.  The potatoes were delicious and perfect.

I made these last Thanksgiving because I was so short on help and cooking space. Left out the garlic, but otherwise did pretty much exactly as the recipe said. They were a huge hit. My dad refers to them as the best mashed potatoes ever.  I don't think we had many leftovers!
