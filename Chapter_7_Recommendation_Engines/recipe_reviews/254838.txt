My local stores didn't carry the spicy marinara, so I used regular marinara instead.  I increased the amount of marinara to two jars of the Barilla brand.  I added shrimp to it.  The Sriracha sauce was spicy enough without adding any more spice.  I cannot see this being a great recipe for kids, unless the kids like super spicy food.  Overall, I really didn't like the recipe and would have liked it less with the amount of marinara indicated.  I believe this would be better with sausage or something other than nothing.  Even the shrimp I added just acquired the taste of the spice.  I love spicy foods, but this wasn't a great dish in my opinion.  I believe it could be made to taste a lot better, but it seemed like a cross between an Italian dish and an Asian one, and it wasn't quite cutting it for me.

The amount of pasta indicated requires 2 jars of sauce for sure. So I used just half the pasta, my partner doesn't like mushrooms so I left those out. I used some sliced squash , zucchini and chicken.  The sriracha drizzle mixture was great! We ended up drizzling several times lol. I will make it again, next time I'm going to try it with sausage.

We really enjoyed this dish. I used about a quarter of the honey and next time, I will leave it out altogether. We enjoyed the heat from the spicy marinara and the tang and spice of the Sriracha. I used snow peas because I didn't have snap peas. Thank you for the recipe.
