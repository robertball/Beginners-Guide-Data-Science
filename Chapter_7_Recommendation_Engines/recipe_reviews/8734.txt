I'm giving this 5 stars even though I changed the recipe somewhat after making it as written the first time. I agree with others that the butter should be cut in half. When I made it as written the first time it was just too greasy for me. The reason I'm keeping the 5 stars is because of all the recipes I've tried from this website THIS is the recipe my family keeps asking me to make. It is simply delicious! Except for cutting the butter in half I keep the ingredients the same. I found that it bakes best covered in foil at 350 degress for the first 30 minutes. Then foil is removed and chicken is basted, basking for another 40 minutes or so until nicely browned. Served with roasted red new potatoes and mixed veggies. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

FABULICIOUS!  Who knew you could mix honey, mustard, and curry to create such a marvelous flavor? Now I know!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut the butter in half, used ½ teas. regular salt and ½ teas. garlic salt, doubled the curry powder, and added ¼ teas. cayenne pepper.  I also poked holes in the chicken and let it marinate in the sauce in the fridge for at least an hour before baking it, then put in the oven - 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then 20 minutes uncovered.  I paired it with brown rice and garlic roasted asparagus, for an amazing meal.  Bless you Gretchen!

I had to make this chicken three different times just to make sure it was good, and guess what? It was fantastic all three times, one point, is to cover the chicken in the beginning with foil so it won't burn, so just before it is done, uncover it and cook till it is a nice brown. Hope it helps.

Excellent flavor!  My husband asked me to make it TWICE this week!  I made the following modifications based on other reviews and personal preference:

I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, used spicy brown mustard, and upped the curry powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I also added one large clove of garlic, minced, a scant 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and half and onion sliced very thin.  I used chicken thighs, and there was enough sauce to do a dozen between two casserole dishes.  I coated them well and baked them covered at 350 degrees for an hour, turning halfway through.  I then removed the foil, basted them again, turned the oven up to 400, and baked them skin side up for an additional 20 minutes.  The skin got nice and brown and crisp.

After baking, there was a lot of fat from the chicken.  I separated the fat and ended up with a nice sauce.  I served the chicken on a bed of long grain/wild rice topped with the sauce - which was really excellent on the rice.  The changes I made resulted in a mildly spicy background flavor that really complimented the sweetness of the honey mustard.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Wow, this was surprisingly delicious.  I used 4 skinless, boneless breasts and cut the butter to 2 tablespoons.  I also eliminated the curry and marinated the chicken for about 4 hours in the sauce mixture.  It was so tender and delicious, everyone was pouring the remaining sauce on their chicken.  I didn't even baste it during cooking and it was great.  Very easy meal- Thanks!

I have been using a modified version of this recipe for more than 20 years.  It is best with chicken thighs.  I have also used turkey breast tenderloins cut into serving pieces and had it turn out very well.  My recipe calls for 1/2 c honey, 1/3 c mustard and 1/4 c butter, 2 t curry powder and no salt.

This recipe has been a family favourite for as long as I can remember.  As much as I hate people who completely change a recipe and then rate it, I'm going to do just that.  I make this with chicken breasts cut up into bite size pieces.  Drop the amount of butter down to about a tablespoon and increase the curry powder to a tablespoon.  Then I add dried fruit (apricots, raisins and craisins are my favorite).  Throw it in oven and bake it until the chicken is cooked.  The mustard/curry/honey sauce gets all gooey and thick and is delicious over rice.

We had this for dinner yesterday and it tasted and looked great! Changes I made to the recipe: I skipped the butter - figured the chicken skin would impart enough oils during cooking. I used dijon mustard instead of yellow for a little more spicyness. Added a teaspoon of garam masala in addition to the curry. I also used a knife and cut little slits in the chicken to ensure more flavor would get into the chicken. Very good .. definitely a keeper!
One thing I should mention is that I'm normally pressed for time in the evening, so I made this in the morning and let the chicken and sauce sit in the fridge until I was ready to put in the oven - this marinating probably helps with the taste as well.

Excellent chicken!!  I did cut the butter in half as recommended, instead of regualr salt, I used Lawry's, and instead of regular mustard, used dijon.  Used a pack of drumsticks instead of a fryer chicken, since that is what I had on-hand.  I dipped each drumstick in the sauce, and placed on a foil lined pan - I like easy clean-up.  Covered the pan with more foil and baked for 30 minutes.  Then uncovered and poured the remaining sauce over the drumsticks and put back (uncovered) in the oven for 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.  Served over white rice and poured the yummy cooked up sauce over the rice too.  Both my husband and I loved it!!  He's already planning on trying it out on the grill.  If you like honey-mustard, this is a sure winner!!

I honestly was a little hesitant about using curry since I haven't cooked much with it before but we have found we like it very much in this recipe and it wouldn't be good without it. I mostly always cook with boneless/skinless breasts and it was great. I doubled the sauce recipe but left the butter at 1 stick still because I wouldn't have any natural grease from the skin. We also prefer to use a dijon mustard. Cooked about 9-10 breasts in 9x13 pyrex (kind of piled them in there)at 400 degrees for 1 hour. I turned them over in the sauce 2 or 3 times while cooking. I made myself a note that there wasn't much left the times I have cooked this so I might want to consider doubling again:)

I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars as written, four stars with my changes. I used 6 good sized chicken thighs (with bone-in and skin on) which I parboiled for 15 minutes first. I only used 1/2 stick of melted butter since I was decreasing the amount of meat used, but stayed with the 1/2 honey. I did up the amount of curry powder, since a teaspoon is such a small amount for the mild curry I had on hand. I kept the salt in the recipe, but did sprinkle some black pepper on at serving time. I am a fan of curry - all types and flavors from Indian to Irish. Don't expect a high powered spicy sort of curry with this dish unless you use one of the spicier curry blends (like African or Malaysian) that has more hot pepper flavor. With a mild yellow curry blend, combined with the honey and mustard you will get a nice mellow curry dish.   I sliced up some potatoes and carrots and baked them along with the thighs, basting them and the meat every 15 minutes for one hour at 350. I did cover the pan with foil for the first half and then uncovered it, which did the veggies a favor in their cooking, but left the skin on the thighs slightly less crispy than I would have liked.   This is one of those recipes that you should try and get creative with as there are so many things that you can do with the basic guidelines here.

Very easy and delicious chicken recipe. Not all my family liked it and it was a bit greasy. Wish I had read the other reviews, I would have decreased the butter as well. :-)
Will definitely make it again though with a few tweaks.

I've wanted to try this recipe for a long time, but when I saw the calorie content for 1 serving (over 1000 calories- are you kidding me!?) I said forget it. Well, I never forgot about this recipe & I thought I'd try it anyway because of the great reviews. I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup & used skinless, bonless chicken breasts.... for all of you who claim your chicken breasts are dry and gross- try this recipe next time you cook the breast. I reduced the cooking time to 45 minutes to ensure that they wouldn't turn out dry. It was so tender & moist! I believe I used a little too much curry though b/c our kitchen smelled like curry for 2 days after I made this lol. This was delicious & a few healthier changes made this dish worth eating.

Thanks to other people's reviews, the version of this I made was truly terrific.  The changes are:  half the butter (1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c.), 1-1/2 tsp. curry powder instead of 1 tsp., and the addition of 1/2 tsp. cayenne and 4 minced garlic cloves.  My husband said it was "super yummy," and the "zinginess was great."  (The cayenne is important.)  I wrote my strongest compliment on the printout:  "Make again."  I did, and it was just as terrific the second time.  A keeper for me, and I don't have many of those!

I thought this was an easy, delicious recipe. I did not use a whole chicken, though, as I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to cook up some chicken breasts I had. It was the perfect amount of sauce to cover the 5 large chicken breasts in a 9x13 pan. 

I covered it with aluminum foil and baked it on 375, pulling it out after 40 minutes and flipping the chicken over. I re-foiled it and baked for another 20 minutes. 

For personal preference, I removed the foil and broiled the breasts for 4 minutes, flipped them over and broiled the other side for 4 minutes.

It was perfect. Delicious. Moist. Hmmmmm. My 16 year old son was home and I had him taste it. He loved it. I then had my husban stop working on the yard and taste it. He said it was delicious. My 15 year old (super picky) daughter took a bite, said she did not have enough to really taste it and asked for more... (twice), at which point I knew she liked it. Over all, I was extremely pleased with the chicken.

WHEN I make this again, I will definitely omit the salt because I thought it was too salty. That was the only downfall. I will probably use another 1/2 tsp curry since I really like that flavor.

I loved the underlying sweet flavor of the sauce and turned it into a gravy by adding some cornstarch and cooking it up in the microwave until it was bubbly (3-4 minutes..) The grease from the chicken rose to the surface and I just carefully tipped my glass measuring cup until it drizzled out into the sink and only

WOW! Very easy to prepare, simple ingredients- my kind of recipe.  My kids & hubby loved it.  I did cut the salt & butter to 1/2 of what the recipe called for & doubled the curry powder (our family happens to like curry).  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and lined the bottom of the pan with sliced onion (I highly recommend).   I covered with foil for 1/2 of the cooking time and removed foil to brown chicken for the remainding time while basting every 15 min.  It does make plenty of sauce which is terrific on just plain white basmati rice.  This recipe definitely stays in my recipe box!!

We liked this one a lot.  I did reduce the butter as others suggested and I used boneless, skinless thighs.  Because I used boneless chicken, the cooking time was only about 40 minutes.  After 20 minutes, I turned them over.  I'm thinking of using peanut oil rather than butter next time.  Not sure yet. :)

wow! was this an amazing dish or what! Love the flavor and the simplicity of the recipe. followed other reviewers suggestion and reduced the butter by half, cooked with foil on top for 40 mins, later up the oven temp to 250deg C and baked for another 20-30 minutes. I used boneless chicken thighs and they were soooo soft and tender. What I did with the remaining juice was that I added some heavy cream and thicken it with a bit of flour. Dip the chicken in it and absolutely YUM! Oh, and I used Dijon Mustard here. Will make this again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Turned out pretty good, my husband and I both enjoyed it. Changed a few things based on other reviews...added 1 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/8 tsp chili powder, and I topped the chicken with sliced onions. I used chili powder instead of cayenne because that's what I had! I also used chicken breasts instead and covered with foil for 30 min, then uncovered for 20. If you feel ambitious like I did, spoon sauce over chicken a few times in the last 20 minutes. I served this with rice and green beans on the side. Will make again!
TIP: Do not taste the unlabelled chili powder to check...my tongue almost fell off!!

I must admit that I giggled when I saw this recipe.  My family has been using this exact recipe for twenty some years!  I also cut the butter, use spicy dijon mustard, and use extra curry.  Everyone I serve it to loves it.  I always make extra and then cut up the leftovers into a wok with any kind of rice pilaf recipe! The spices and honey make the second dish great as well!

This chicken came out very good! Even my two young girls loved it.  My only change for next time will be to start the chicken off skin down for about 30 mins then flip it over and cook skin up for the remanding time.  I really liked how it browned on top, however, the bottom of the chicken had all the flavor since it sat in the juices the whole time with only the top being basted.  If it doesn't brown as well next time when I flip to cook  with both sides in the juice, then I will turn the broiler on for a few to get the caramelized look.

I have been making a this recipe for years! It is one of my go to, tried and true. I use 1/3 cup melted butter, 1/3 cup honey, 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, and 4 tsp. curry powder. Served over rice, it is super easy and always a hit with my family.

The chicken was delicious! I'm making it again tonight! This time though I added a dash of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp ground ginger and I sprinkled the chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. The sauce goes great on rice or vegetables on the side!

This one goes into our weekly menu plan. So easy, I love to burn the edges of the chicken. Also slice a whole onion and add to  the bubbling sauce. The onions candy nicely and it's war with my hubby to see who gets the most.

Love it!  Followed recipe exactly.  No need to cover the chicken as long as you baste every 15 minutes, as the recipe directs.  I do suggest that you check the internal temperature of the chicken after about 45 minutes.  I baked mine one hour, and it was slightly overdone.

I used 8 chicken thigh bone-in and used about half the butter and added no salt.  I did double the curry powder and cranked my oven to 375 degree F for 65 minutes.  I basted every 15 minutes and did not have to cover it at all.  It came out perfect and delicious!  This one's a keeper.  Thanks for posting!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I wanted to make a nice dinner for my parents on Mother's Day, and I had baked chicken on the mind (My parents' favorite). I decided to try this recipe, and I felt bad that I hadn't made more! It is one of the best things I have ever made and eaten! I'm normally very modest about my baking and cooking, but this is one of very few dishes that made me go, "Holy cow, that tastes amazing!" My parents loved it, and my friends tried the leftovers I took in my lunch and exclaimed it was really great. I used pre-cut pieces of chicken (Legs and thighs), but followed the rest of the directions precisely and it turned out perfectly.

A must-try for all chicken-lovers!

I follow the recipe as written. This is a staple in our house, I have to make it every other week or so. I do not recomend covering the dish while baking as per other reviews. The sauce needs to caramalize and thicken, it will turn a beautiful golden color and coat the chicken!

I followed other reviewer suggestions and only used 1/4 cup melted butter and then used 1 1/2 tsps curry powder. (We had all chicken thighs) What a great dish!!  DH ate 3 pieces and then finished off the chicken for lunch the next day- he doesn't do that!  I will definitely be making this in our normal rotation and will send the recipe to my daughter!

YUM YUM YUM.... FOR LOW CARB DIETS!
I just substituted 1/2 cup sugar twin brown sugar for the honey and it has just the sweetness my hubby desires on his low carb diet (he's lost 45 pounds since January)! Quick and easy and very tasty! Thanx!

YUUUUMMMMYYY! My entire family LOVED this recipe (including my 4 yr old who doesn't like anything new). I used Dijon mustard and left out the curry. I also used skinless drumsticks and thighs.

This was absolutly fantastic. I only needed to cook 4 chicken breasts so I had a lot of sauce left over. We served it over the chicken and poured it over the rice too. We served it with sauteed asparagus. My husband actually said "I can't get enough of the sauce." And with 4 chicken breasts it only took 20 minutes to cook!

My husband is not a curry lover & I am so I have been trying to find one that he'd like....THIS IS IT ! In fact the whole family & ANYONE else I've served it to LOVES it....simple & delicious. I use the melted butter when I use breasts but I most often use thighs which are much tastier & don't need it. Made it again last Sat night for friends & served with a vegetable fried rice. Thanks for the recipe:)

I was really surprised with this recipe. Needed something to do with leg quarters and came across this recipe. Had everything on hand and I have to admit, this was absolutely delicious. Added a special black and red pepper combination and cayenne just to give it an extra kick. Removed from pan as soon as it was done and it was tender, moist with a very crisp skin..Excellent and easy dish.

I love recipes that have minimal ingredients, one's you usually have and it tastes this good. All the while i was enjoying it I was thinking what a great sauce this would be for buffalo wings. Right off the grill, tossed into a bowl with this sauce and a little ceyenne pepper or Franks red sauce with some ranch dressing for dipping and it would be amazing.

Loved it!  I did make some make some changes though.  Like everyone else i cut the amount of butter to two tablespoons.  Minced 3 garlic cloves and added them on top of the chicken (2 chicken breasts) along with 1/2 onion, sliced.  To the mixture of butter, mustard, etc., i added a teaspoon of chipotle adobo sauce and 1 chiplotle chile- because my bf and i love spicy food and i thought the mixture would be too sweet.The chipotle does not take away  from everything else and it actually didnt make it spicy at all but it does give it a yummy kick. I covered the chicken with aluminium foil for the first 30 minutes, uncovered after and started pouring the mixture every 5-10 mins after for ~35 minutes.  When served the chicken was very juicy and by far the best ive had!!! I served the chicken with red potatoes, carrots, and cauliflower which i also had put in the oven (on a separate pan) and added parsley and 2 teaspoons of the mixture.  Also made rice.  Ill be making this recipe again, loved, loved, loved it! =)

Enjoyed this recipe, but must agree with other reviwers about the butter. Next time I will cut it down to 1/4 c. Also will cover the chicken for a while so it doesn't burn the tops. For some reason, I didn't read reviews on this before making and for that I am at fault for the chicken swimming in butter.

I've been making this for years!  I use margarine and only 1/4 cup and add 2 T. lemon juice.  I also use garlic powder rather than salt.  Served it over white rice to soak up all the yummy juices!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce but decreased the butter. I should have just left the butter out though. I also added paprika, thyme, basil, garlic and onion powder and pepper for some more flavor. My 8 yr old son even dipped his cauliflower in the sauce and said it was great.

Following Colleen's suggestions, I cut down the butter to 1/4 cup, used Dijon mustard, upped the curry powder just a bit, added a few drips of tabasco sauce and added some minced garlic.  I put my chicken pieces in a zip-lock bag and allowed it to marinate for several hours.  Then I poured the whole thing in a flat casserole dish, covered it and baked it at 350 for over an hour.  Then I took off the lid, increased the oven temp to 400 for another 30 minutes, the chicken pieces turned out very tender, nicely crisped and tasted wonderful.  My teenage son is a very picky eater and he loved it!

Maybe it's a matter of taste, but I absolutely loved this recipe and the curry in it.  I added onions and some garlic and halved the butter and it's already a favorite.  I've made it three times - each time perfect.  I also used the glaze on a whole chicken with the same success.

This is a really easy and really delicious chicken recipe that I will make again. I used dijon mustard and I also added 1 teaspoon of rooster sauce (sriracha) and when my husband asks if I'll make this again, rest assured, it is a superb recipe!

Holy Cow this was EXCEPTIONAL!!!!  I did make a few changes...added 3 cloves fresh minced garlic and doubled the curry and decreased the butter to 1/4 cup.  I covered this for the first 30 minutes and then baked uncovered for 20 minutes.  The taste and flavor mingling was un-freaking-believable!  I served the remaining sauce over white rice and it was absolutely incredible.  This deserves 10 stars in my book!  Thanks for sharing!  I served this with a side of cauliflorwer, garlic and rosemary.  Exceptional dinner!

This is an excellent recipe that anyone can do!  I agree with the previous suggestions to cut the amount of butter in half and add some more curry power if you like food a little more spicy.  Instead of basting, I just flip the chicken every 15 to 20 minutes and cook it about an hour.

Wow!  Fantastic!  I tried this for a "company" dinner in which I was using two chickens.  I doubled the ingredients, but cut the total butter in half at the suggestion of others. Cooked it for the full 75 minutes. There was a lot of sauce while cooking, so I think next time I would perhaps multiply the sauce mix by just 1.5 for two chickens and see how that works.  Even though it was very saucy and didn't carmelize to a great extent (although it did brown a little), it was absolutely delicious!  My guests raved and my younger son, who hates everything, said I should make it again.  This was so easy to make, I'm still amazed how good it was.  A total winner!

I added NO butter at all, and used thighs with the skin still on; I just made sure to spoon some of the sauce underneath the skin before cooking. I baked for 65 minutes at 350 with the chicken covered with aluminum foil to retain tenderness, and then another 15 minutes with the foil off. The flavor was wonderful, and the sauce turned to a nice glaze. Next time I will marinade before baking.

The only thing I did differently was to use boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, cooked at 375 for 35 minutes.  The rest of the recipe I followed to the letter and it was fantastic!  THe whole house smelled so good while it was cooking.  The curry was definitely not overpowering as some have suggested- I put the chicken on top of rice and poured the sauce all over it- I will most certainly make this dish again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed suggestions and used much less butter and did not use the curry powder.  Instead of basting, I followed the suggestion to just turn the chicken every 20 minutes.   My husband loved it, and when my kids came over the next day they were sorry that there was only enough for one piece each for them!!!  Definitely a keeper.  
Thanks!!

I made this with my sister last night and was so pleased with the outcome! I listened to the reviews and only used half the amount of butter, and double the curry powder called for. I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes baking, then removed the foil for the remaining bake time. I also just used boneless skinless breasts cut up. Served with white rice and roasted vegetables :) I'm giving this five stars because it was so easy to make and was absolutely delicious! This will definitely be something I make time and time again!

Doesn't look like much but this chicken was awesome.  I made slight modifications by reducing butter, salt and curry (1/3 cup butter, scant on the salt and curry).  Wife said it was the best baked chicken she has had!  Winner for sure!

Need to add some oomph - extra curry? cayenne? garlic? Made almost double sauce, using about this amount of butter, and served w/ rice pilaf made with orzo (Sarah's Rice Pilaf from this site). Made the Curried Cashew, Pear and Grape Salad - also from this site and absolutely fantastic. Terrific meal!

Yum!  Used 2 tablespoons of butter and added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Turned out fantastic.  Family loved it - will be using this again!  Make sure you let the chicken get all crispy and sticky...

I used this as a glaze on chicken drumsticks and it worked really well - the whole family enjoyed it.  When I went to make it I couldn't find the curry powder (whoops) so I added paprika and cumin instead.

Loved this! So simple, yet so tasty. We want to eat this again for sure. We agree with the others who rated this for using 1/2 the butter in the recipe and cooking some time covered and some open for browning. We thank the cook who shared this.

I've made this several times. Reduced the the butter by half and used EVOO instead, S&Pd the chicken before tossing with the glaze. This last time I tossed in some mini carrots onto the same cookie sheet to roast with the chicken. Delish!   Next time I will try some potatos on there too.   Only thing with this recipe is that I don't have an hour and a half to wait for dinner to be done, so I crank up the oven to 450 and cook it for about half an hour, basting twice. Works out great.

WOW! This is absolutely delicious!!!  It is probably one, if not THE best chicken recipe I've ever tasted.  My husband and I loved it and I will definitely add this to our recipe box. I want to make it again this week.  My husband and I were fighting (nicely) over the leftovers the next day!  :-)  I used bone-in chicken legs and thighs. Basting it every 15 minutes is important and I covered the bottom of the metal pan with foil for easy cleanup.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

My mother wants to introduce curry into her diet because she learned that doctors believe curry and cumin may fend off Alzheimer's (Indian people almost never get Alzheimer's). This is a nice recipe to introduce the flavor of curry to those who may never have tried it before. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts but didn't marinate mine as suggested by some reviewers. I don't think you need to marinate when baking. I increased curry to one tablespoon and added garlic powder. Left out the onion because I was short on time and cut the butter in half. I bet this sauce would work great for grilling, but I would recommend marinating in that case. Would probably work well with chicken or even fish on the grill. I forgot to put the mustard in the sauce until the last 15 minutes of cooking when I added honey mustard to the pan juices; turned out great. I don't think you can goof this up if you try! My husband really liked the dish. Served it with pine nut couscous but will use rice next time. Nice recipe; thanks.

A very nice/SUCCESSFUL recipe. I made it with Chicken Thighs ($0.79/lb.). My husband and my sons gobbled up 3 thighs each. My daughter (who really does not like chicken all that much) ate her share, too. I served it with heapings of Instant Mashed Potatoes (next time I'll be better, I promise), fresh carrots (cooked) and canned peas (heated).

I will DEFINITELY cook my chicken pieces this way many times again.

This was excellent!  I added closer to two tsps. curry and sprinkled some thyme over the chicken before baking.  I also marinated it overnight and it was superb; moist and delicious and smelled great while it cooked!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made it for my boyfriend one night and he loved it so much. I had a dinner party and made it again and it was a hit! It is so easy to make. I have to say i am kinda new at this hardcore cooking thing and I can whip this baby up like a champ. I highly reccomend it.

Excellent with a little less fat!  

Excellent with boneless skinless breasts, with these changes: used 4 breast halves, 1/4 cup butter, half dijon and half plain yellow mustard, 2 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, two inch deep square glass pan (the chicken pieces were almost touching).  Cooked at 400 for about 40 min. basting now and then. Sauce never carmelized but the color was good, lots of sauce, chicken was moist, and hubby (who thinks the hates curry) loved it... did not know there was curry in it.  Will do again.

with a few changes this is a 5 star-the main thing is cut the butter in HALF! I halfed the curry and added a few shakes of hot pepper sauce. I also did as others have stated and just turned the chicken every 15 minutes. My husband had 4 pieces!!! (I had three-but we will keep that between us SHHH!!!) LOL! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I thought this recipe was excellant. I used it with chicken thighs and followed the recipe exactly. The chicken came out nicely browned, sweet and flavorful. I will definiately be making this again. Whenever I make it, people lick their plates and the pan. I sometimes use a little garam masala as well and I cut down the salt. This recipe was also very easy to follow. I took the skin off of the chicken and I reduced the butter by half. You can really get by with less butter, especially if you use chicken thighs which are already moist since they ar dark meat.

Wow, this was great! I used half the butter and left all other sauce ingredients the same and it was perfect. I used 6 large chicken breast and put them in a foiled lined roasting pan and poured the sauce over them an hour before baking. I baked them an hour with the foil closed and then opened it for another 1/2 hour. Done to perfection. My guests were so impressed and I can't wait to make this again. I served this with baked squash and popovers and whipped cinnamon butter. Yum!

I love this recipe!  Actually this is pretty much my recipe for anything when I entertain...  Just dumping a bunch of fat and sugar over whatever sounds good for dinner before you bake it generally makes it come out awesome, but the secret to successful recipes like this one is to overcook the hell out of the dish...  It puts the food over the top.

We found this recipe in a cookbook called Cooking Plain and Fancy put together by the Women’s Fellowship of the Upland Brethren in Christ Church 1976 submitted by Jan Harmon and have loved it sense that time.  The recipe in this cookbook is identical to this rendition with the exception that it calls for two fryers.  I hope you enjoyed knowing the lineage of this wonderful dish. A lot of the recipes submitted to this book are Pennsylvanian Dutch.  It would not surprise me that this dish originated in that area of the country.  Thank you for putting it up on-line so that many more people could enjoy it.  Thank You.

Great flavor, easy to cook. I cut down the cooking time & the fat. I preheated my oven to 425 degrees. I used 8 bone in, skin on chicken thighs, 3 tbs. of butter & the other ingredients. I removed the skin on 4 thighs, salted/peppered the chicken on both sides. I melted the butter w/the honey & added the mustard & curry powder & poured over chicken. I turned over to coat & baked skin side down covering my dish w/foil. Set timer for 25 minutes. Take out of the oven, turn chicken over while basting & bake for another 20 minutes uncovered. Can broil for 3 minutes if not brown enough. The sauce is great on rice & next time, I might add another tsp. of curry powder to bump up the flavor. Yum!

Delish!!  Really easy and so good!  I can't eat dairy right now so skipped the butter and used olive oil instead.  Served over brown rice with steamed carrots and sautéed zucchini.

My husband did not like to smell of this when it was baking but loved it when he ate it! It was very good! Chicken came out very moist. Used half the butter it called for...could use even less. Did not cover while baking either. Will make this again.

AWESOME and FAST!!  Here are the things I did differently:  1.  Used 1/4 cup melted, unsalted butter-  so basically half the butter.  2. Increased the curry to 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls because we like the flavor.  3. Sprinkled my chicken pieces (breasts without skin and legs with skin) with kosher salt and coarse pepper and then let rest until room temp. 4. Put them in a 9X9 dish, covered with sauce, pierced chicken with a knife to increase flavor, sprinkled with cayenne pepper, and covered with foil.  Baked for 30 min then uncovered and cooked until done.  5.  Served with rice the first night.  ROUND TWO:  Make sure to save any extra sauce or consider making extra!  Reheated chicken and sauce the next day and used the sauce as a salad dressing.  MMM warm chicken and dressing over fresh salad greens!!

The only thing I did not have on hand was curry otherwise I followed the recipe and the family loved it. I did not cover it and just baked it for the recommended time.

My boy friend and I just devoured the 2 thighs and 2 legs that I made. It was delicious. A great change to our usual recipe, is my boy friend's happy comment and I couldn't agree more. 

I also took the other reviewer's advice and reduced the butter and covered the first 30 minutes and opened the last 20 minutes. The chicken was perfectly moist and cooked through. Wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again!

This was pretty good. It's great for a barbeque chicken substitute because it's sweet but the seasoning gives it a nice twist.

Very good. Tasted alot like the Honey-Mustard Baked Chicken I made last week. I used frozen, skinless, boneless chicken tenderloins. Put them in the pan with the sauce and covered it with foil,  baked for 35 minutes at 375. Then took the foil off and baked for another 10 minutes until chicken was thoroughly cooked. The sauce was great over the whole wheat rice and green beans.

This is simple and yummy.  Made it as is and whole family liked it.  I've made this a few times now and cut down on the butter a bit last time and it was just as good.

This was a great recipe!  My family loved it and it was so easy.  I used chicken thighs and removed the skin (just my preference).  I used a little less butter, but otherwise followed the ingredients as listed.  I covered the pan for about half the chicken from drying out, and then basted just once.  Turned out perfectly and was a huge hit with my family!

I liked it but my kids did not. I think they were put off by the curry flavor. My teenager only ate half and he is usually the disposal for the rest of the family.

Delicious the first time, and reheats well, makes for great leftovers (if there are any). Instead of basting every 15 minutes, I covered it in foil for 30 mins, flipped the chicken, recovered for another 20 mins, and then broiled for 15 minutes on each side for extra crispiness.

I was skeptical about this recipe because I do not like curry.  My husband does however, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did, because it was really good!  I would not add more curry like some people suggest, for me it was strong enough.  Good recipe for those like me who aren't big fans of curry.

Nice flavor, especially good over couscous, but way too much butter! I'm not normally a low-fat fanatic, so I'm a bit surprised to say I don't think this recipe needs butter at all. If you're using skin-on chicken pieces you'll probably have enough fat rendered from the chicken to enrich the sauce, I don't see the point of adding butter. If you're not using skin-on chicken pieces, you still don't need as much butter as this recipe calls for. Use a couple Tablespoons, at most.

Loved this! I used chicken breasts. Also followed the others and used less butter, dijion mustard, more curry and minced garlic. Cooked for 20 min. covered with foil and 20 min more uncovered. Had all most 2 cups of sauce so I took out the breasts, kept them warm, added the same amount of instant brown rice as sauce and baked it for about 20 min or till done. Went great with the chicken breasts. I'm putting this one in our family cook book.

One of the best chicken recipes I've ever had! It was incredibly flavourful and the leftover sauce was perfect for serving with rice.  I also halved the butter and I added garlic, cayenne pepper, some dried pepper flakes, and a splash of soy sauce.  Thanks for a great dish!

Without even telling my husband about the rave reviews, he said this one is the best ever.  Served skinless cut up chicken with green beans over jasmine rice.  As directed, and added a bit of cayenne pepper for zip.  Mmmm!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though it was too sweet for my son.  I thought it was fabulous.  I used skinless chicken breasts and it turned out moist and tasty.  Served it with Harvest Rice and french green beans.

My families favorite recipe of all time. Although I've never added the curry or salt. I use skinless boneless chicken breasts. I've tried with legs and thighs or breasts with skin, my family gets upset. So I keep it simple.

I made this last night for my extremely picky family - used the boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cooked under foil for 20 minutes, then removed the foil and cooked another 15 minutes. The chicken was succulent and the sauce addictive. Everyone raved about it and asked for it to be added to the rotation!

The whole family loved this! As per other suggestions, I cut the butter in half, and increased the curry; I ended up using about 2 TBSP since we love curry flavors. The only complaint? I didn't make enough! This will definitely be made again, and I will cook more chicken!

Fantastic flavor!  I followed the reviews and cut the margarine in half and added a bit more curry.  I actually boiled the ingredients and then I let the chicken marinate overnight.  I baked it uncovered at 300 for 2 1/2 hours and basted it every so often.  It was sooooooo good and looked perfectly golden! Even my 3 year old loved it.
Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic! Made a few minor adjustments. Filled a measuring cup 3/4 full of honey and topped it off with good spicy dijon mustard as I never buy the cheap yellow stuff. Also added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Other than that, followed the recipe and cooking instructions and the chicken turned out juicy and sticky and buttery and flavoful and DELICIOUS. I will definately make this again! Thank You for the recipe!

Love this recipe.  Tangy, sweet, delicious over mashed potatoes.  My whole family enjoys it - including an excessively picky 2 year old and a husband who doesn't like potatoes.  Perfect on a winter's night.

Made this for a friend and her family and for my own family... got RAVE reviews. I cut the butter in half and added some garlic salt and very light sprinkle of suger over the chicken once coated. I also marinated the meat for several hours before cooking. 
My very picky husband asked me to make it a part of our weekly meal plan! This is a big deal. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and used 2 tsp madras curry paste.  I also used 10 skinless chicken thighs.  I baked it at 40 minutes at 300F on convection, basting often.  It was excellent, I may use even less butter next time.

This is probably the recipe I make the most frequently out of all the great recipes I've found on this website. My husband requests it, company requests it, and relatives beg for the recipe. I make it as written, except I usually make it with chicken thighs so I cut down on the butter. With basmati rice and naan it is a great meal. Thanks for a super recipe!

Delicious and very rich !  Followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  I do plan on cooking it again and I'm going to try a little more curry, but was excellent if you follow the recipe exactly.

I had super high expectations after reading the reviews, and I'm sorry to say I was a little let down! You could taste the honey, and maybe a little mustard if you thought hard about it, but i tasted no curry (2 tsp worth), or the cumin and garlic that I added!  It was a sweet, mellow chicken dish, but not at all what I was expecting.

Made as directed except for covering with foil for most of cooking time and using honey mustard instead of regular. Used mild curry due to feeding small children. Marinated chicken in sauce overnight, then baked as directed the next day. We all loved it, but the flavor did not penetrate the meat very well.  Next time I will remove the skin and/or use cut up breast meat. May try cooking in slow cooker.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I saw this recipe and thought "it can't be that good,  It's just chicken...."   Well, it is!  This is a perfect Gluten Free, Dairy Free (if you use a butter substitute) meal that will please the entire family. My butcher cut up a whole chicken for me and I found some wonderful local honey.  I cut the butter amount down, taking advice from previous reviews, used a Honey Dijon mustard, green curry paste (don't have curry powder), no salt was necessary. Baked at 350 for 30 min and 375 for 30 more min.   I even threw in a sliced onion..  everything came out carmelized beautifully and delicious.  I served the chicken with Jasmine Rice and fresh corn on the cob (baked the last 20 min.with some sauce brushed on, then rolled in foil)

Love it! I used chicken brest. I did what others have suggested: I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, I chopped some onions and sliced some garlic and sprinkled it on top! I left every thing else the same. I will continue to make this over & over.

I love this chicken! Everyone always eats every drop! I make it at least once a week per the family request I also cut down the butter to 1/4 cup and always use chicken breast because they always dip the chicken in the sauce that is left over. I did not think they would like it but I was wrong! Thanks to all recipes I am the best cook!

I was very hesitant on making this chicken as the ingredients didn't seem to be able to work together, I was so wrong. This is fabulous. My whole family liked it. I did cut the butter down some though.

I was a little apprehensive about this recipe because I have never cooked with curry before. I was still unsure whether I would like it or not based on the aroma while the chicken was cooking but once I tasted it....WOW! The flavor is amazing. I cut the butter in half as many other reviewers suggested and used boneless skinless breasts which I cooked covered in foil for 30 mins and uncovered for 20. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I might add a little cayenne pepper next time as one cook suggested because I always like a little kick but it's pretty perfect as is. The boyfriend is quite picky and usually finds chicken boring but he loved it too! Definitely one of the best chicken recipes on this site!

Easy and very good. I also decreased the butter by half and will try even less next time. Sauce was great over rice. Stir fry if there are any leftovers!

You just have to try this recipe if you haven't already!  It is one of my favorites here on Allrecipes.  I discovered this recipe in late January and since then I've prepared it 4 times.  I can't get enough.

One tip: save your leftover honey mustard mix to drizzle over the leftover chicken later, or over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

I asked my hubby to rate this and he gave it a 4+.  I followed the recipe exactly.  By not covering the chicken for some part of the cooking time (as some suggested) the chicken skin developed a beautiful golden lacquered look that was very appealing.  Covering was not required because even after 75 minutes in the over, the chicken did not become too dark.  The basting sauce was really tangy and sweet.  This would also be great for just chicken wings.  Next time I'll take the skin off the chicken before cooking.  On the pieces with a whole lot of skin, I hated discarding that wonderful lacquered skin -- but I couldn't bring myself to eat too much of it.  BTW, because some commenters said the chicken was dry, I brined the chicken for a couple hours beforehand.  Viola, juicy chicken every time.

Wonderful recipe!  Normally mustard is one of the foods I cannot stand, but this dish intrigued me and I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!  I prepared everything exactly as the instructions said and the chicken turned out juicy and bursting with flavor.  I wasn't disappointed by a single bite!  I will definitely be making this again.

This is really, really good as written; however, if you add approximately 1 Tbsp Sriracha chili sauce and make it a marinade, you can make it amazing!

I cooked this in the slow cooker. It was good. I am sure it would be much better in the oven all golden and caramelized on top. But I just didn't have time for that.

OMG this is one the best chicken recipes that I have tried in a long time. My DH was hesitant to try it but one bite and he was loaded with compliments. Went back for seconds and asked when I was going to make this again.  I made just a few of changes. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I only used a 1/2 stick of butter and only had zesty brown mustard.  I covered the chicken the first 1/2 hr with foil and then removed and basted as directed. The chicken was moist flavorful.  If you don't try this recipe it is your loss. OPTIMO!

I have made this twice now and the whole family loves it, especially my husband.  I follow the recipe exactly as written with the exception of reducing the butter to 1/4 cup. Its just too much butter as written. This one's a keeper, thank you for sharing!!

This was a huge hit and will definitely be made again.  The one drawback is the amount of butter. I used half the amount of butter and there was still a thick layer of oil floating on the top.  Will try 1/4 of the butter next time (1/8c).  Not sure it is needed.  I had lots of sauce with 8 boneless, skin less thighs.  Cooked 30 mins covered and then 5 mins uncovered so it would brown.

My only change was to cut the butter in half.  I spread the mixture over the chicken and really didn't need to baste as it stayed on the chicken.  It produced very tender, moist chicken that everyone at my table enjoyed.

This is a great "go to" recipe when rushed for time or just lazy!!  I've used it for years - but I use BBQ SAUCE (nearly a whole bottle) drizzled and then the honey and that's it!! I cover it for about 30 min. and then leave it open to brown another 15 or so..  I just use bone in chicken breasts.

Good base - you can really do anything you want with this but here's how I did it: make the marinade from 2 TBSP mayo, 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and 1 TBSP curry powder. We grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the grill (I marinated for 30 min first - the longer, the better!) and we brushed extra sauce on the chicken while grilling. Then I set a little extra sauce to the side and spread a spoonful on each chicken breast just before serving (it melts down on the hot chicken). Delicious sauce, tender moist chicken!

The flavor of the chicken is fantastic. Used bone in chicken thighs with the fat and skin removed. Cut the butter in half used French’s Yellow mustard and doubled the curry. Marinated the chicken over night.  I covered the chicken for the first 45 minutes of cooking so it would not burn. Everyone loved it and served it over Jasmine rice and topped it with grilled fresh pineapple. Would make this again only next time develop a sauce to pour over the chicken.

I adopted the following modifications and it came out very nicely.  Drop the butter down to one tablespoon. Increase the curry up to one tablespoon. Score the chicken so that the sauce penetrates. Cover with foil for 1st half hour.

Beautiful recipe!  This is now a regular part of our family menu. Like others, I have modified this a bit. I don't like chicken on bones, so use 3-4 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces.  I also only use 1/4 cup butter - and I'm a big fan of butter - but the extra butter just isn't necessary and doesn't improve the flavor at all.  Not using the meat on the bone, it takes less cooking time.  I put foil on for the first ten minutes, baste with pan juices and then 20 minutes with the foil off...and it is done.  Beatifully golden and delicious. Thank you for this recipe!!

Oh yeah!  I could eat this twice a week.  I think I liked it better than my husband 'cause I was like "Man, this is so good!  I love it." Over and over.  He just kinda rolled his eyes and agreed.  I served mine over wild rice with a package of steamed mixed veggies thrown in.  The sauce was great!

My family LOVES this recipe - and so easy!  I always pound my chicken breasts flatter so when placed in the 9x13 pan, the sauce covers completely.  As it bakes, it will reduce some, leaving the chicken golden.  Also, I use 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup.  Yummy!!

This was an incredible dish!  So yummy and easy.  Only suggestion is to cut the butter in half.  You can also cook it on 400 degrees for an hour with the chicken dish covered in foil.  Just stick it in, let it cook and enjoy eating it!!!

Very yummy and sweet dish. Definetly cut the butter in half (at least). If you've already made it with the orginal recipe, I used the excess butter on top of the chicken dish and put it in my mash potatoes. Instead of adding more butter to them. It worked out great. I also added sweet corn. I made too much so I layered it mash, corn, chicken and extra sauce in little portion containers for lunches the next day. I will make again.

Instant family favorite.  I was worried because my husband does not like ethnic food at all and I was hoping the curry flavor wouldn't overpower the dish. It doesn't taste like a curry dish at all, though. It has just exactly the right balance of sweet and spicy. Even my 8-year old -- the world's most finicky eater -- loved it.    Per others' suggestions, I cut the butter in half.

I use chicken breasts and pan fry them instead of baking. therefore I skip the butter. Taste good. Spiciness is a very personal thing and the original recipe gives only a very very subtle flavor. Can easily double the mustard and the curry powder without overwhelming the dish.

Reduce the butter by half and this is a 5 star recipe.  I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts in 1/2 the sauce for about 2 hours and cooked them in the sauce on the stove top.  It was a huge hit.  Served with coucous and veggies.

FABULOUS! Made this with two large boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into strips. Still used the same amount of butter in the sauce. Used spicy brown mustard. Also added (as per others suggestions)1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, one clove garlic and about 1/4 cup onions, thinly sliced.  Baked 350, covered for 30 min. Then turned it up to about 410, uncovered and they were finished in 25 min. The extra sauce was great over some steamed white rice. 

Wonderful recipe.

This is an absolutely tasty chicken, I love it. I recieved nothing but compliments.
In the recipe, instead of using a whole chicken I used 3 chicken breasts instead. Plus I added a teaspoon of Garlic Powder because I thought that it would taste wonderful with the honey. The Garlic powder really did give it that yummy kick. Next time I'll double the recipe to make more.
I'd recommend this recipe to all my friends.

I made this twice and it was a super hit! Here are my slight modifications. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and used the recommended amount of butter since I didn't have the grease from the skin. I cut them into small pieces, about 2 inches wide to 4 inches long, and they were a bit dry the first time, so I just cut the breasts in half for cooking the second time and they were succulent. I baked for an hour total at the recommended temp, covering it for the first 30 minutes with aluminum foil, then uncovering it for the last 30 and basting every 15 minutes. Enjoy!!!

Unbelievably good!!! Hubby exclaimed after the first bite, "It's nice!" lol. He then rated it 4 1/2 stars, which is kind of a shock because this was so easy. Dd rated it 8 stars, and I loved it. The taste after the chicken comes out of the oven is spectacular. I halved the honey because I'm used to dh saying he doesn't like very sweet foods when they're normally savoury, but other than that, no changes. I used boned chicken thighs, marinated for 1 hour, covered with foil for 40 mins, and basted every 15 mins after. I cooked until the tips of the chicken turned golden brown. I served this with vegetable chop suey. I lined the bottom of my tray with foil so all the drippings were easy to clean up. Thankyou!! UPDATE: I make this all the time now, using 1/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup mustard and 1/4 cup of butter (I double the butter if I have extra chicken to 1/2 cup), it's so simple and cheap as I buy the huge tubs of honey and huge bottles of mustard which last me like 6 months and buy blocks of butter and put them in the freezer. I serve this with a cruchy asian salad or vegies. My dd adores it.

This is a very good change over the same ole chicken. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and took others' advice regarding cutting the butter in half, adding a little more curry and covering with foil. It turned out great. Next time I will use small dishes to put the remainder of the sauce in so we can dip our chicken in it. Thanks!

This was surprisingly great. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and I doubled the amount of curry and garlic to give it more flavor. I'll definitely make this again but next time I think I'll marinate the chicken for a bit before cooking.

This was really, really good; it was easy and kept the chicken moist and flavorful. The only thing that cost a star is that it really didn't need an entire half cup of butter - the sauce eventually had a very oily buttery layer sitting on top of it. I used boneless, skinless breasts, covered the pan with foil, and baked at 350F for about 45 minutes, turning at about 40 minutes and basting occasionally (they were in a pretty small, deep dish). Baked uncovered at 350F for the last half hour or so. Served over rice, and used the pan drippings as a sauce for the rice. Very tasty! Will probably experiment with more spices in the future, too.

So easy! And for us, something different! I used about 1lb of chicken breast halves instead of a whole chicken. I also upped the curry to 1.5teaspoons. Like other reviewers said, I added sauteed onions to the top of the chicken in the pan. The first time I made this I baked it for 75 minutes as the recipe calls for, but the chx came out dry and overdone. I reduced cooking time and covered dish with foil the second time, and it was great! Served it over white rice.

This was excellent. My husband and I both enjoyed and it was great for leftovers at work the next day. I hate curry and I used the amount called for in the recipe and it was perfect. It gave it a little bite but didn't overwhelm the sauce.

I used half the amount of butter called for and next time I will use just 2 tablespoons. It really was swimming in butter since the butter seperates from the sauce during baking. I just spooned most of it off, whisked the sauce in the pan and served it over the chicken and rice. Steamed sweet peas made an excellent side item.

The sauce was really good. I will be making this again (probably this week!). I love that it is so good, easy, easy cleanup, and uses items that are easy to keep on hand!

This is almost exactly the same recipe that my mom used to make from the "More with Less" cookbook. The proportions of some of the ingredients were just a little different: 1/3 C. margarine, 1/3 C. honey and 2 T. prepared mustard, but more sauce is always better. It's really great over plain white or brown rice. DELICIOUS!

This was awesome! I used chicken breasts. I used honey dijon vinaigrette instead of mustard. I didn't have any curry powder so I made a mixture of turmeric, garlic powder and pinches of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cayenne pepper. I also sprinkled bread crumbs over the chicken. It was so good!

Using boneless/skinless chicken thighs, this wonderful dish only baked for 40 minutes and the flavor was delightful.  As always, I did use a brine on my chicken during the thawing process.  My brine consisted of fresh chopped garlic, S/P, and 2-3 T honey and water.  Per recommedations from others regarding the sauce, I modified by using only 1/4 c butter and 1/4 cup of honey. I used a dijon mustard and also added about 1/2 t of cayenne pepper for some zing.  Bon Appetite!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! It was so easy and it made for a great dinner with my hubby. I poked holes in the chicken in order to let the sauce soak in and it was really moist when it came out of the oven. I think that next time I might follow Colleen M.'s advice (bake covered at 350 for an hour, turning halfway through. Remove foil, bast again, turn oven to 400 and bake skin-side up for an additional 20 minutes) to get the skin a little crispier. All in all, it was very good and I'm certain I'll make it again.

I made this using boneless chicken strips, and just did not cook them as long. Came out great and was a nice change of pace.

This chicken is outstanding and so easy to prepare!!  I had to use 1/2 regular mustard 1/2 Dijon because I ran out of regular. This made more than enough to cover 2 large boneless chicken breasts and 4 bone-in thighs. I kept the chicken covered until the last 15 minutes and it came out a gorgeous color, not burnt-looking at all. The meat was not spicy AT ALL so if you enjoy a little kick, I'd recommend using the spicy curry powder, possibly adding a little Tabasco to the mix. My picky mother-in-law actually complemented this chicken several times -  I will definitely make this again!

This is delicious!  It tastes much better than I had even hoped, we love it!  I made it with dijon mustard and added a pinch more curry and it was perfect!  If you are cooking boneless skinless chicken breasts I would recommend cooking with the lid off part of the time so the sauch thickens.  This will definitely be a family favorite.

This recipe is delicious!  I have made it a couple times because it was so good the first time. I used chicken breasts, which came out juicy and tender. I did add garlic and sliced 2 small onions very thin with a mandolin and draped them over the whole top layer of the chicken. I served it with basmati rice. Again, Delicious!

This is a very very very great recipe. My husband LOVED this. Its sort of a sweet sauce that goes over the chicken. The best we have had in a very long time. I rate this #1 so far! I would highly recomend this to everyone!!!!!

This was good...I made it a little healthier. I used chicken breast, and I browned them on the skillet with a little olive oil and minced garlic. Added salt & pepper, added some oregano, and basil for a savory flavor. I then made the marinade with the honey and regular mustard. I saw that Dijion mustard had a more sweet flavor/aroma. I then added a couple of shakes of paprika and cayanne as someone else suggested. I omitted the butter all together. I flipped it twice, and before it was done I added some cornstarch & water directly to the dish in the oven & it thickened the sauce up, and put this over the chicken when I plated it. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I marinate the chicken in the ingredients first - really added to the flavor. Chicken is tender and flavorful and comes off the bone quite easy. Just yummy. I added a little fresh garlic and extra curry, as suggested and it was well worth the change. Next time I'm going to do this in a crockpot. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great.  Made minor modifications, based on previous reviews:  used only 1/4 cup of butter, spicy mustard, Accent (instead of salt) and poultry seasoning.  This was very tasty.  I will defintely implement this dish into our family rotation.-----UPDATE:  I usually make this using legs or thighs.  The last time I made this recipe, I used chicken breasts cut into small pieces.  The chicken cooks faster and is great served over rice.

We loved this!  My husband always said he didn't like curry, so I've never cooked with it but thought it would be a great match with the honey and mustard, so I sneaked it in.  He has certainly changed his tune about curry, now!  This will definitely be a keeper around our house.    Great sauce over rice - I used both yellow and honey mustard because that's all I had.  Also did it with bonelss, skinless, chicken cutlets and kept them covered most of the time.  I'll definitely marinate it next time. Thanks!

Five stars for this one.... actually I used thick pork chops instead, but this seasoning blend is what makes it special. If anyone wants to try the chops, I baked them less time and about 325 degrees... Then softened some apple slices in the microwave, laid them over the chops (drizzled with the pan juices) for the last 15 minutes... Oh Yeah!

I didn't know that there would be so many juices.  I will use this recipe regularly, but will use a deeper dish.  I didn't have curry, so I used garlic powder instead and it turned out yummy.

This was delicious.  Used boneless-skinless  thighs, cut into bite sized pieces.  Took about 30 minutes to cook.  Served over a green salad with gr. onions, shredded carrots, tart apples, walnuts with  honey-dijon viniagrette.  Scrumptious!!

I was good. Took the advise of others -400 for 40 min & half dijon half yellow mustard.  Sauce was very thin, chicken was tender w/ a nice crunchy glaze, but way too messy.   I would have liked a better sauce. May try this recipe again, because it was so easy.

My entire family ate this up!!  My 4 & 2 year old cleaned their plates.  I used 6 chicken legs, about 1&1/2 lbs, and had the right amount of sauce to just about cover the chicken.  I baked at 400 and turned every 25 minutes three times and the sauce nicly glazed the chicken.  Based on other reviews I halved the butter.  I put two large potatoes in the oven to bake at the same time as the chicken and dinner couldn't have been easier to prepare.  I think next time, and there will be many next times, I will line my pan with renolds release to make clean up just as easy.  I think this would work well on the grill if it was marinated first.  THANK YOU GRETCHEN!!  For an extra kick try using red curry powder.  Very nice!!

This was really good. I was looking for something very simple for our Rosh Hashanah dinner, that both adults and kids would like.  This was it.  I used chicken breasts, left out the curry (knew the kids would hate it), and used Dijon rather than prepared mustard. It smelled wonderful when it was cooking, and the end result was delicious.

I cut way back on the butter, used a hot/sweet mustard (double the amount called for) added lots of minced garlic, fresh ground pepper, & used boneless chicken thighs. The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking! Served over rice with steamed broccoli, it was a great dinner!

This is a very good recipe. I have never used the curry in it. Whenever chicken thighs are on sale, I buy them and use this recipe with them. I've tried it with boneless breasts, but it's better with pieces with skin on. My four year old loves this recipe. It's also very easy.

My dishes are still soaking, but I HAD to stop and write this review! When your husband looks at you after one bite and says, "This is really good!"  All three kids, 14, 12 & 10 clean their plates and ask for more and I scraped every last stuck on drop of the sauce up after dinner I thought I should just sit down and write my review. One word - YUMMY!! 
Based on other reviews I cut back to 1 Tblsp of butter and will probably omit it altogether next time. I used Dijon mustard and upped the curry to 2 tsp. I cut up 2&1/2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes. I flipped the pieces 1/2 way through and re basted the tops. Served over rice w/steamed broccoli.. What a hit and SO easy to make?? Thank you Gretchen

This was MUCH better than I imagined it would be. After reading the reviews, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and kept the other ingredient amounts as written. I did use sourwood honey, as that's what I had.  Baked @ 375 for about 40 min.,and covered after about 20 min. Then, I turned on the broiler and broiled each side of the chicken. Be sure to spoon some sauce over each piece of chicken before serving... you don't want any of that good sauce to go to waste! HaHa!
Thanks for posting the recipe!!

Easy although I think 1 hr is plenty.  Would like to try again in the slow cooker.  This might work for a crowd.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Read some of the reviews and only added dry roasted garlic about 2 tsp to the mixture. Baked at 350F for 1 hour turning after 30 minutes and basting 2X in 2nd 30 minutes. Removed foil, increased temp to 375F, turned skin side up and baked another 20 minutes. Perfectly crisped and sauce reduced to great consistency for pouring over chicken on a bed of basmati rice. Will definitely use this one again!

The taste was out of this world. Even if you aren't a curry person, it's not overwhelming at all. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 was all the basting. Getting up every 15 minutes to baste got tiresome very quickly. Especially since i had to use a spoon. Very yummy otherwise, pretty simple too! (except the basting)

I have never really had curry before but my husband really likes it so I thought I would try this recipe out! OMG soooo yummy!! I used skinless chicken breast and I did what other reviewers mentioned and cut back on the butter and doubled the curry. I placed the chicken breast in aluminum foil for 30 min and opened it up for 20 min and it came out perfect and juicy! This will be my new go to easy quick recipe! Thank You!

This is my go-to recipe when I can't think of something to make. It's quick and easy but still tastes absolutely amazing. I changed up the recipe a bit since I didn't have all of the ingredients. I basically did equal parts honey and butter. I then added in some cajun seasoning (I didn't have curry) and used just chicken breast. I have yet to try it with mustard but it turned out wonderfully without it.

Made this last night. I let it marinate for an hour and used 6 chicken breasts, left out the curry and cut the butter to half. It was delicious! Made with white rice and peas and carrots. Turned them over half way through cooking. Recipe was great

Loved this!  I did decrease the butter and increased the curry like some have suggested.  I added carrots and potatoes to the pan, and covered it with foil for the first 40 minutes, starting with the pieces skin side down, then turned them over after I removed the foil.  I loved the carrots with the chicken, but will try serving the chicken with rice next time.

I can't even believe something this simple is so delicious.  We used chicken drumsticks, and the whole family went crazy.  I added a touch more curry because we love it.  Thank you! We'll make this over and over.

I've made this recipe as written a few times and it is great!!! As with most recipes that I love, once I am comfortable with the dish I like to tweak it a bit to make it my own. Here are the changes that I have made and found to be wonderful...
1. I use chicken breast, parboiled in chicken broth or sauteed in butter (depending on my mood) then drained. This prevents the flavor and consistency of the sauce from being diluted by the chicken juices.
2. Mix together 1/2 cup of melted butter, just under 1/2 cup of honey, and just under 1/4 cup of mustard. 2 tsp curry powder (as others have suggested) 1/2 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp salt.
3. Pour the mixture over the chicken in a casserole dish, cover and bake 10-15 min til sauce gets nice and sticky.
4. Spoon over rice and top with crushed walnuts and dried cranberries.

***I recently served this with butternut squash sauteed in butter and sprinkled with brown sugar.

This recipe is awesome. I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and doubled the amount of curry spice. It was one of my favorite ways to cook chicken. Will definately do again.

Wow. Such simple ingredients and a great taste! Giving four stars because I did modify the recipe a bit as per others' comments. Did 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup honey and 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. I used Madras curry powder (I'm Indian myself) dijon mustard, and I didn't make a whole chicken, I used chicken tenders. Baking time was 30 min uncovered, 15 min covered. Then the chicken was still a bit watery, I transferred the chicken and the drippings into a pan and fried it until the water dried up and the chicken was a bit browned on both sides. Superb. I do feel like the recipe is missing a tang, perhaps the next time I make it I'll sprinkle some lemon juice on top. As far as the curry flavor, I felt like the honey and mustard gave most of the flavor and the curry was a smoky backdrop.

Super easy to make and extremely tasty! Hubby and I enjoyed this with steamed garlic and his 'smashed' taters. I used cumin instead of curry powder (didn't have any!) and it was definitely a great substitute. WILL make again. Didn't chop the chicken into pieces though, I just cut through the breast portion and flattened it out a bit. I baked it in a round Pampered Chef baking stone and ladled the 'sauce' over top every 15-20 minutes or so. Absolutely a staple in our house now.

Absolute best honey mustard chicken flavor! The curry is what makes this dish. I did use 1/2 the amount of butter and it was plenty. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I've been on the hunt for a really good honey mustard chicken and this one is it!

This was fantastic! I would agree that the butter needs to be a little less and curry a little more. But I am in love with this recipe. Curry lovers will enjoy this!

Wonderful!  I made this for dinner to night.  It takes just minutes to throw together.  I followed the recipe as is except for halving the butter.  Honestly, I think it could do with even less.  I was using boneless chicken thighs, so I covered it for the first 45 minutes and then basted it periodically.  I served it with Harvest Rice Dish, also on this site.  Both were a big hit with my family and will work well for company, too.

I hate to give any recipe a bad rating but i thought this was awful. I did use spicy brown mustard, not sure if that had something to do with the bad flavor. I was able to save the sauce by adding about 1/3 cup of brown sugar, garlic and soy sauce. then it tasted great.

I made this out of desperation because we were running low on groceries and I had all the ingredients.  I figured my husband and I would like it okay, but didn't hold out much hope for my 15 year old son because of the curry.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the curry powder - other than that I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I served it with basmati rice and green beans and we all loved it!  My son even shocked me last night and asked if I would make it again!  He really loved the sauce.  This is a keeper!

Great dish however the cook time I found to be way off..  Chicken was not done... I would add at least 20-30 more minutes ..  We had everything done but had to wait on the chicken to finally be done.

Followed recipe except used skinless breasts and thighs and cooked for a little over a half hour (used a meat thermometer to verify doneness).  Was juicy and very flavorful. Will make again.

I tried using this for chicken wings and it was delicious, reviewers are right that it is too much butter.  That's the only reason for four stars.  It's definitely five stars with the slight moderation and I can't wait to try this again!

Okay, anything  this easy should NEVER be this good. I was shocked at the robust flavor. I used boneless breasts because that is what I had. Plated with long grain and wild rice and Asian vegis with a little cinn and ginger... hubby said GREAT! ( I took the advice of other reviews and cut the butter in half or better.)

I omitted the curry powder, but didn't skin or marinate as was the suggestion by another reviewer when they did so. That was a mistake. Also there was far too much glaze. I probably could have halved this.

While my picky 5 yr didn't like it, i thought it was great.I covered the chicken in the beginning with foil so it would not burn.  Will make again.

This is a very simple recipe. It takes a while to bake but no time to make. A little bit similar to Teriyaki Chicken. Good! It was very good to use over rice.

This was so good! The whole family loved it. I served it with quinoa and broccoli. The sauce was so good on both. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts, otherwise made as written.

If I could have given this more stars I would have!  It was fabulous.  As with the other reviews, I was so surprised at how well these ingredients tasted together.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I used boneless chicken thighs and cooked for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  This will be a staple in my house although I think next time I'll reduce the butter by half just to see if it tastes as good with a little reduced fat/calorie combination.

I just made this dish and I thought it was very good.  To be honest I just guessed on the measurements and added more ingredients as I thought they were needed.  The sauce had a great flavor and this was a very simple dish to make.  I will make this again.

I loved it! I can barely boil an egg but this was so easy to cook!! I'll be making it again! The only difference was that I used boneless skinless chicken breasts to make it healthier.

Great! We used drumsticks and cooked for 10-15 minutes longer than the recipes says (I always get nervous with dark meat! haha).  The outside of the chicken was crispy and sticky and sweet and the inside was moist.  Will make again for sure.

So good!  I took the advice of a review and added extra curry and sprinkled on some cayenne peper.  After my picky husband gave me the go ahead to make it again, I told him it had curry in it.

This was soooo yummy!  I used drumsticks and doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the butter.  I wanted extra sauce to spoon over the brown rice I also made. Basting the last 30 minutes is definitely a must to get the meat nice and browned. This is a keeper!!

YUM!! Stop looking you've found it!! We love this chicken and I hate curry (the smell is not for me). I made this 2 times in the same week and I rarely make the same meal 2 in a month. I like to double the sauce and I use chicken thighs.

Dijon mustard and nix the curry (for which we do not care).   I used split breasts and trimmed much of the skin to eliminate some  of the fat.  I used a deep pan to eliminate the splatter in my oven.  It was great---no mess, easy, tasty.

AMAZING chicken!  Wonderful recipe!  I added a few touches...a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a shake or 2 of cayenne pepper for a little heat.  Plus, I used 75% dijon mustard and 25% yellow mustard....fabulous taste and everyone was asking for seconds!  Tonight I am cutting the chicken into small bits and making it the same way but will be using it as an appetizer and served with toothpicks.  Don't hesitate making this recipe....uh...YUM!

We loved this chicken, it's easy to make and full of flavor. I did however brown my chicken on top of the stove to give the skin a little crunch. Will continue to use this recipe.

GOOD- I used a ceramic baking dish. took a whole chicken, seasoned it with some salt, then poured the butter mix over the chicken. I basted it every 15min or so, had it at 350 covered for 1hr, then cooked it uncovered for 15-30min until skin was golden...basting as needed of course

Yum! Definitely use only 1/4 c butter. The honey, mustard, and curry combination was a delightful dance on my  tongue. I keep asking my husband to make this dish for me. It smells delicious baking in the oven. Definitely a keeper we will go to again and again.

This was not bad.  I halved the butter, used boneless, skinless breasts, and omitted salt.  Baked 30 min with foil, 30 min w/o.  Served with brown rice and peas.  Would likely make again, but it wasn't one of the recipes I drool over until I make again

This is a great recipe. Thanks Amanda!! My husband is a very picky eater and he took one bite and said "this is really good". I made extra so that we could have some leftovers---but between me, my husband, and 2 year old daughter we ate it all and there was none left. I did as others suggested and only used 1/4 cup of butter. I will definitely be making this again. Soon!

Spectacular as written.  Don't change a thing.  I used 3 lbs. of thighs and drums.  Ok, I guess I did change a thing.  I removed the skins to make it healthier.

Our family favorite! The first few times I made this exactly as the recipe directed and it was really good. Now I made it with a few adjustments and its AMAZING. First I use 2.5 tsp of curry and I totally eliminate the butter and in its place I use 2 tbs of olive oil. In addition I crumble up one of these 4oz tubes of goat cheese with herbs, usually the brand President, and add it to the mix. I add my clean/washed chicken to the mix of curry, salt, honey, mustard (I use Grey Poupon Dijon) and goat cheese and put in all in a Ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight. Then I put all the ingredients in Pyrex dish and add cubes of Feta cheese, about 100grams. I make sure to poke the feta down into the sauce so they don't burn. I like to have enough of the honey-mustard mixture so that the chicken is almost covered and there is enough sauce to add on top of the rice or couscous when serving.

This chicken was excellent!  As with other reviewers, I made the following modifications: 1.  Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs 2.  Cut the butter to two tablespoons 3.  Cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I put the marinade on the chicken in a baking dish the morning I was going to use it.  I let it marinade all day and then baked it at 375 covered with aluminum foil for 20 minutes.  Then I basted the chicken and removed the foil, cooking the chicken for another 20 minutes.  I basted it again a second time about 10 minutes before it was done.  The chicken was super moist and flavorful and delicious!  My preschooler loved it and asked for more.

I'm a fan of honey-mustard and enjoyed this recipe. I used skinless chicken breasts and baked it in a covered corning ware dish.  The chicken came out very tender and the sauce is really good. I think the next time I make it, I will slice the chicken breasts so that the sauce can permeate the meat better.  Might also consider marinating the chicken in the sauce before baking it.

My whole family loves this recipe, even the kid who refuses to eat meat...  I used 1/4 c butter as suggested, also added a lil garlic & black pepper to the sauce before pouring on chicken.  I also omitted salt (always do). Cooked covered for 30 min, uncovered for 30 min at 350.  Will definitely make again & again!

Good but can be improved upon. Maybe adding something to make it more savory next time like garlic or other spices to up the flavor.

This was pretty good considering I am not a fan of mustard.  I do wish I would have used bone-in chicken with the skin on instead of boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

This is a great, easy recipe to throw together upon getting home from work.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, cut the butter in half, and used about a tablespoon of curry powder (we like curry).  I don't baste every 15 minutes, just flip the breasts over half way through cooking.  Everything always turns out great, and the sauce tastes wonderful over rice with some vegetables.  Have made multiple times, and still really enjoy it.  Thanks!

This chicken was awesome, very savory, it definitely makes your mouth water. My only complaint was that it was slightly greasy,so I will just have to adjust that next tome.

Really good - even my picky 7 year old ate seconds.  I cut the butter in half as suggested by so many other reviewers, and I'm considering using olive oil next time around.  I also threw in dried apricots as someone suggested.  I might add more seasonings next time (garlic powder in particular) but it was plenty good just like this!  The sauce was delicious over rice.

Update - March 2015... still wonderful!  Butter probably could be cut down to 2 tbsp instead of 4 (which was already half!).  Have to make this again SOON!

EDIT - 9/18/15... Adding raisins tonight as I don't have any other dried fruit on hand.

Good weeknight recipe and easy to prepare. There are only two of us, so I used a package of four chicken thighs.  We like a little zing, so I used half dijon and half grainy mustard.  I also used half butter and half olive oil to cut down at least a little on the fat, and was heavy handed with the curry because we like it alot.  Served with heirloom wild rice blend and steamed green beans.  Will probably put into the dinner rotation once or twice a month.  Also, this is a great recipe to play with and experiment with the flavors in the glaze.  I think I might add some chopped, fresh thai basil next time.  I think the basil and the curry will compliment each other and make it even more "thai-like" in taste.  Thanks!

This really was the best chicken I've ever made.  Everyone at dinner couldn't stop talking about how flavorful and moist this was.  I used 2 large bone-in breasts and 6 large bone-in thighs since these are our favorite parts of the chicken, and left the skin on.  I think the bone and skin are essential to this recipe's success. The meat literally just fell off the bone when done. The basting sauce is simple to throw together and gives the most wonderful taste to the finished product.  I think I will try this on chicken wings next.  I wouldn't change anything in this recipe.

My hubby who hates mustard loved this chicken.  I only used 2 TBS of butter which was plenty.  I used chicken breasts which I split to stuff before cooking.  Marinaded split chicken for an hour then stuffed with blue cheese and slivered almonds, rolled in bread crumbs and drizzled remaining sauce over chicken.  Baked 350 for 30 min coverd with foil then another 10 without foil at 400 to brown the crust.

The only change I made was to reduce the butter down to a 1/4 cup.  I served it with roasted vegetables.  They family enjoyed this meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was really good and SUPER easy.  I used 1/2 the butter and added a couple tablespoons of chopped garlic.  There was a lot of sauce at the end of the cooking time.  Next time I will remove some of the sauce and reduce it on the stove top.  Good stuff!

OH MY GOSH. I made this the 2nd time in 2 weeks. I made it for friends last night, and they wanted the recipe. I DON'T CARE IF THERE IS A STICK OF BUTTER IN THIS RECIPE - it's worth it for the fabulous taste! Thanks much, for this wonderful, easy, luscious recipe!

I baked covered for 30 min. and then uncovered for another 30--served over rice, and perfect!

I did this out on the grill and it was absolutely awesome! I did as others suggested and only used 1/4 cup butter, and I increased the curry to 1 tablespoon, I also used chicken legs. I added some garlic powder,paprika,and a teaspoon of sesame seeds.  I wrapped it all in heavy duty foil on the outside and used my non-stick foil to make a tray with sides to hold my chicken legs and sauce for the inside of my packet. I wrapped it up tight and cooked then on low heat for a half hour, then cranked the heat to a medium level and opened the foil.  I flipped the legs 2 times and basted the sauce on them for about another 35 minutes ( until the sauce was thinkend nicely and the chicken was browned) and they turned out incredible. TRY THIS RECIPE, you will not be disappointed.

This was very good. I used chicken breasts cut into pieces. As per many other reviewers suggestions, I cut the butter in half and doubled the curry powder. I will probably add even more curry powder as it will still quite subtle. Delicious served over rice.

Really delicious! I will try to marinate the chicken in the sauce the next time to enhance the flavor, but every person I've made this for (especially my family) already loves it.

Rave reviews.  I used "Smart Balance" instead of butter and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It came out great.

great flavor and smell! I just cut the butter in half-the extra is only adding useless calories and fat. The thing I really like about this marinade is it's thick enough to actually stick to the marinade while sitting instead of just dripping off the sides. ********UPDATE******** There was a bunch of leftover marinade one the bottom of the dish after this came out of the oven, so I put it in a pan, added about a tbsp plus 1 tsp of cornstarch mixed with about 2 tbsp water and added to marinade to make a slightly thick, almost barbecue sauce texture to dip it in-it was absolutely fabulous!

Love! Love! Love this recipe! It has become a family favorite and when ever my husband is in the field or gone training, he begs me to make this for him as soon as he gets home. He used to ask me to make his mother's ribs, but this has taken it's place! Thank you so much!

This is a great and simple recipe.  I just used leg quarters and it was great.  I made it for my parents when they last visited and they immediately copied the recipe.  One change I did make was to use less butter - just a couple of tbsp.

I've made this recipe twice, once with the curry, once without. Do not leave out the curry! It makes such a difference. The first time it was amazing!! Everyone could not stop raving, even my difficult to please brother. The second time it was still delicious, but no raves. The curry really adds something special.

This recipe was phenomenal.  I used brummel and brown, agave nectar, and honey mustard.  I also sprinkled a little chicken seasoning salt on top.  My batch was small, so I decreased amounts and just eyeballed it, but the flavors were delicious, and the house smelled good all night long.  The result was beautiful and flavor-filled.  I paired it with basmati rice.

Very Good!  No changes are needed.  I skipped the curry powder only because I didn't have any.   I used 2 chicken breasts and cut the recipe in half.  It was very moist and flavorful with  a very pleasant aroma.  Will be making again.

I didn't have a whole chicken, so I made this recipe with boneless/skinless cut chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise (cut cooking time). I used Dijon mustard and cut the butter down, as others have suggested. I baked it at about 375 for 20-25 minutes and it was perfect!! Very tender and flavorful. Great, simple, throw in the dish and cook dish!

This is very good.  I give it a four-star for two reasons:  1.)We're not "WOW!  This is fantastic!" about it, but everyone gobbles it up (13 and 11 yr old included).  2.)I make a few changes, so that alone merits less than 5 stars.  Changes: Half the butter, double+ the curry powder, a wee bit more mustard, a generous spoonful of minced garlic, and perhaps a 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  I taste and adjust as I go along.  For note, I cover for first 30 minutes and uncover for last 10-15; although I have only made this with thighs - white meat might need adjusting (and I have a gas oven, not electric - also a probable factor).  This goes into my regular rotation box, but isn't a "wow" five-star.  More of a good, solid meal that satisfies.

Way too much fat when using skin on chicken,and cut up chicken certainly doesn't take 75 minutes to cook through at 350 degrees. Either use skinned chicken and cut back on the butter (just a couple of tablespoons will do) or omit the butter altogether if using skin on chicken. I prefer skin and deboned chicken breasts for this recipe, and just a small amount of butter for flavor. I've even used just a couple of tablespoons of olive oil instead of the butter. Cook the breasts for no more than 30 minutes. They should be cooked through in that length of time at 375 degrees, but always use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. Don't rely solely on time and temperature.

Great flavour works on roasting a whole chicken and wings too! I'm giving it a 4 star because of the necessary adjustment required for the amount of butter. Thank you for suggesting using only 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.

I hadn't been eating chicken for a while now because I am always afraid that I will feel that weird smell or taste that sometimes comes out of chicken. This recipe was so flavorful and delicious, my kids and I really loved it! The chicken became caramelized and did not dry out. I used skinless boneless chicken legs. sooooo easy and sooo yummy! One of the best baked chickens I've had in a looong time!

This has been a family fav for years. I do use a bit more curry, and I use breasts. 
 
It's also an awesome chicken recipe to use  for chicken salad--combine chilled and chopped chicken with mayo, green onion, diced red onion, diced apple, quartered grapes and golden rasins. I like to bake the chicken the night before so the flavors get more intense, then chop it and mix the salad together in the morning, again to let the flavors blend.  

Serve on bread for a sandwich or in small lettuce or Belgian endive leafs for a savory/sweet appetizer.

Excellent flavors but of course, being asian, i am used to slightly heavier spices so i added a dash of cayenne pepper and paprika. Will definitely cook this dish again.

I roasted a whole chicken instead of cutting it into pieces and it turned out very good.  I suggest filling the roasting pan with baby carrots becaus you end up with the best glazed carrots ever.  I chopped up leftovers and made chicken salad the next day with mayo, celery, and a little bit of extra curry.  It was super yum.

Wow! This was SO good that my 11 year old son asked me to make it every night.  I used 2 chicken breasts, cut them into cubes, put in a skillet, mixed all of the remaining ingredients in a bowl and poured over.  Cooked for about 30 minutes on med-high heat and it was done.  So easy!  I also made rice and used the extra sauce to pour over the rice.  This one is a keeper!

Wonderful!  I used skinless, boneless chicken tenders (one-pound pack) and with half the butter and they still came out succulent and moist.  Wonderful way to get a great meal using things I already have at home, so I am a big fan!  This recipe is a keeper:)

I not only halved the butter, but used butter-flavor margarine instead, and even substituted some of THAT with olive oil. Just to make the melting easier, I ended up making all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan, so they all melded together nicely.

I baked two cut up chickens with the sauce (it made a LOT of sauce) at about 375 for 45 minutes, then uncovered, basted with a bit of reserved sauce, and they were done in about another 20 minutes. I ran the broiler for a couple extra minutes to get them brown and pretty.

The sauce is fatty enough that you can remove the skin from the chicken pieces with impunity. Even the white meat stayed fairly moist.

I like curry, and I like honey mustard, but I didn't ADORE this particular combination. I think chopped onions would have enhanced it. My guests and husband were happy though. Recommend mashed potatoes or rice or something on the side to help soak up the extra juices. Am looking forward to the leftovers making great chicken salad.

I have been making this exact same recipe for 38 years or so.  My kids loved it when they were 10 or 12.  The sweet honey was the attraction for them I think, but the curry and mustard introduced their little palates to more exotic flavors.  Which was great.

made a combo of the suggestions here. i used 3 boneless, skinless breasts. i reduced the margarine by half and used smart balance. i used dijon instead of regular mustard. i used one teaspoon of curry and 1/2 a teaspoon of garam masala. i omitted the salt. baked 30 mins covered with foil, then 20 uncovered. it was fab! served with brown rice and a salad.

I love this recipe for its ease of preparation and very good taste.  My children ate it and said it was delicious chicken.  Serve it with steamed rice and peas for a super easy dinner; any green vegetable will also work.

This is very good! I added ginger, black pepper and a dash of garlic powder mainly because I was out of curry. I will make it again after I replenish my supply of curry. It's a keeper!!

Oh Man!! This was sooo good.  I used the recipe as a base and went from there by adding cayenne pepper to give a little kick and I think I doubled the curry powder. The only other modification I made was I used half the butter and that was plenty for me... this will go into the favorites folder for sure!!

This recipe is perfect for the family
that appreciates a welcome change to the weekly menu. Curry flavours are not over-powering. Adds excellent dimension to ordinary chicken. (in fact we used boneless,skinless,chicken breasts and they were extremely tender!) We served it with Jasmine rice and steamed veggies. We doubled the curry powder to 2 tsps and it was still not too spicy or overpowering! Loved it and will make again...
Pass it on!

This is a great recipe. I have to admit I was worried about the curry, but it tasted great with the butter and honey. I didn't change a thing and the chicken came out golden brown, tender and juicy! I think it is very important to baste the chicken every 15min. or else the skin may burn.

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't give it a full 5 only because it seemed to lack enough salt. I had to sprinkle more on my chicken. That may just be my own preference. What I was most impressed with is that even my 4 little picky eaters devoured it! This never happens! I used spicy brown mustard and some honey mustard since I did not have quite enough Honey. I also slid some sliced onions underneath the chicken while cooking. Very good!!

This turned out great! I learned out to cut a whole chicken. Then I made the sauce, using 1 cup of honey 9i thought was the perfect solution for the not enough honet problem people have been referring too. I figured two cups would be too much. I added already cut adried onions, and alrewady minced garlic gloves, 1/4 water, some vegtable flakes, almost 1 cup of spicy mustard. (I was running out), and 2 tablesppons of curry powder. It turned out perfectly! Poured over the chicken, and let it bake under foil, as suggested. What I recommend with the chicken is rice. A good way to do it is add french onion soup, I used brown rice, and like 1/2 cup of water. I turned out good, if only I didn't burn it! Remember keeop an eye on your rice, and stir continuly! Honey chicken sauce taste good with rice! Thanks for thev recipe! It was delious!

My family loved this recipe.  Even my eight year old who is a picky eater asked for more.  I used olive oil as opposed to butter.  I also cooked it in an electric skillet as opposed to an oven which cut down on the cooking time, and it turned out great flavor wise, and tender.

I LOVE this recipe! Like everyone else, I reduced the butter and added a little more curry. Because I had a busy day scheduled, I put my chicken in the crock pot and poured the sauce over the top of it. I cooked it on low all day. Then I served it over rice.  Everyone in my family loved it. One of my teenage daughters even declared that she wouldn't mind having it again for dinner the next night. Thank you!

Excellent flavor, and the chicken was very moist. I baked for 40 min with foil and 25 min uncovered. I used 3 T butter and 1 1/2 tsp curry. Everything else was the same. My husband loved it. We will be having this again.

Made it as is.  Fantastic - basted often enough to keep the chicken from overbowning.  Served with Rest. style fried rice also from this site.  The pickiest eater in the world had 2 servings - his twist was to cut up the chicken into the rice and wrap in a tortilla. -- Mr. Picky loved it.

I just made this tonight and it was really good, both my kids, 4 and 7 year old, gave it two thumbs up! The only thing i changed was that i added more curry powder and will probably add 3 tsp next time. I think you could decrease the amount of the butter by 1/2, making it a little bit healthier. The long cooking time keeps this recipe in "my days off" list of supper ideas though.

I just made it last night and it's not exactly what I expected but it is very tasty. I used the recipe changes the other reviewer did-cut the butter in half, more curry, and added onions. Its very sweet. I used dijon mustard cause thats all i had so I think thats why it was a tad more sweet. Id probably use spicy brown next time and add a lot more onions to add some more flavor because the curry is very potent. This might even be good with a little coconut milk! The chicken was juicy and I paired it with brown rice and green beans. I also had a little bit of left over sauce to use again. I put it on some Garbanzo beans with the chicken and that was really good! Personally, I felt like it needed a little something extra not sure what but overrall yummy and totally easy!!

This recipe was amazing. I doubled the curry and added a little cayenne as others have suggested. I used the full amount of butter, I think it made the chicken very juicy.  I cut the recipe down to 1 serving and used 1 chicken breast. I baked it covered with foil for 30 minutes and uncovered for 30. At the end I skimmed of the extra fat and poured the sauce over the chicken. Incredibly delicious!

Great quick dinner option. I was very unsure about the honey, mustard and curry combo, but it was great! My picky husband enjoyed it as well.  I used the 1/2 cup butter and next time will cut in half at least. I used chicken thighs and they only needed to cook for an hour at 350, turned half-way through, and it just fell apart! no knife required!

I love this recipe. My husband went crazy for it; and for the first time my 3 year old didn't ask for ranch dressing with his chicken.Lol. The only thing I changed is that I use chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. The second time I made this I used Old Bay instead of Curry Powder, it was awesome.

The chicken had a rich flavor and smelled wonderful. My only complaint was that the skin was very soft. I'll try it again baking on 400 toward the end. Thank you!

I love this dish, since it's so easy and really yummy. I only make the simplest recipes! I make it just according to the recipe. My husband finds it too sweet for his taste, and he likes things spicier than I do. But he still enjoys this a lot.

This is a great recipe - I've made it 3 times now in the past couple months! I love it because it is super quick to prepare, and all of the ingredients are things I already have on hand - no trip to the grocery store required. I did as the others suggested and cut the amount of butter in half and doubled the curry powder. Delicious and inexpensive to make! Definitely deserves 5 stars.

This was DELICIOUS!! My husband and I really REALLY liked this dish. I can't believe how it easy it was. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the amount of curry powder. Since I cook for just my husband and myself, I used 2 piece of boneless skinless chicken breast. I put them in a baking dish, poured the sauce on top, covered it, and baked it for 30 minutes. I did take it out after 15 minutes to baste the chicken to prevent dryness. When it was done it was incredibly moist and tasty. I highly recommend this recipe!!

Super easy and unbelievably tasty!  Not your run of the mill recipe. One note is to consider a shorter cooking time for boneless/skinless chicken breast. It was an excellent dish!

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband isn't a fan of baked anything, but ate seconds and made sure I kept the recipe!  The only thing I did a little different was use a brown-sugar pecan mustard vs. standard mustard.  Delicious!

I made this last night and used 4 leg quarters.  It was fantastic!  I live at a high altitude so it took really long to cook - I would turn up the temp to 400 the entire time because I was always opening the oven to baste it.  I did the foil over the top until the last 15-20 minutes.  Has a great flavor and I served it over jasmine rice. VERY GOOD!!

I liked it pretty well. Not 5 star in my opinion though.  My dad and SO liked it but my SO wants you all to know that you should add raisins and almond slivers to it :) My dad and I didn't add them but still enjoyed it.

This chicken is exceptionally good! Ive probably made it 5 times, and the only thing Ive done different from the original recipe is maybe put a little extra curry powder... my husband LOVES this chicken! I serve it with brown rice and roasted squash and zucchini

This was so good & so easy!  As suggested by several reviewers, I doubled the curry (we love curry!) and only used 1/4 c. butter---added garlic. I had some skinnless/boneless thighs and breasts I needed to use--they both came out moist and tender. Served with rice & squash.

GREAT flavor. We like to dip, so we reserved some of the 'sauce' in little cups for dipping.  I used half the butter as well and used Lawry's season salt (in place of the salt) and garlic powder. My hubby thought it would be even better using chicken wings.

I really enjoyed this :) I cut the butter in half as suggested and used Lawry's Salt and used chicken breast. I dipped each breast in the sauce and placed in the pan and covered with foil. Baked for 30 minutes. Then poured the remaining sauce over the chicken and baked for 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes uncovered. Served it over white rice. Super good!!

I didnt measure any of the ingredients, I just threw them all in :) and it came out gooood! I used chicken strips (and 3 or 4 diff. kind of mustards and accidentally spilled in atleast 2-3 x's as much curry as I should have) and they were still juicy, yummy, & verrry tender! :)

According to my husband this is the best chicken ever! I serve it with rice to soak up the yummy sauce. At first I considered reducing the sauce when I saw how much was left. But realized that would be a mistake since, I'm  sure the reason the chicken stays so moist and is so flavorful is because it simmers in the sauce.

This recipe is easy to make and an excellent dinner choice!  I followed the instructions to a T, when I made it for the first time this week.  And my family LOVED it.  My three yr old daughter requested a second piece. So, I will definitely make it again, maybe for a dinner party next time.  Nice place to show off some talent.  I am recommending it to others.

Family loved this one. Modified it for the slow cooker. Just floured the chicken pieces, browned them off then slow cooked on auto setting for about 6 hours. Also halved the butter and used wholegrain mustard. Very nice.

delicious.  I used Dijon mustard, half the butter, a heaping tspn of curry.  Next time I would like to try regular mustard.  I would like less curry but my husband loved it the way it was.  Used skinless thighs and legs.  Just rinsed off for the baby and the kids and they loved it too.  A new staple for us.TRY #2- made w/ regular mustard this time and we liked it even better!

Very good and very easy.  I will make this again. I had all the ingredients for this dish in my pantry.  That's a bonus too.  I also didn't use any butter.  It doesn't need it.  It was delicious without it.

I loved it! I used drumsticks and it got messy but the chicken was very tender and flavorful.  Like most, I used half the butter and more curry.  Everything else the same.  I think next time I will use skinless boneless breasts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. It's wonderful!! I make exactly how the recipe reads (although, I use a heaping spoon of curry). I love the flavor and how tender and juicy the chicken is. It's so nice to have a different way to cook chicken! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was very good.  I changed the recipe as others suggested.  Halved the butter, doubled the curry, and used Season-All instead of regular salt.  I also used deli (spicy brown) mustard.  The chicken was perfect and juicy.  I used "pick of the chick" as sold in our supermarkets here and it was just right for two adults and two small children.

this chicken was delicious.  i followed other reviewer's advice and used much less oil, but i didn't have any curry at home and used garlic and some dried thyme to give it more dimension.  the dijon mustard also gave it a nice kick.  i'll definitely make this again!  chicken tops cook to perfect juicy-ness at 350 for 45-50 minutes.

i followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  i used chicken thighs and the skin was flavorful and nicely brown and crispy.  the chicken was so tender it practically fell off the bone.  my boyfriend couldn't stop saying how good it was.  he was still thanking me for dinner the next day!  this one is going in my book of recipes!

Excellent!  This chicken was beautiful and delicious.  Served with white rice and leftover sauce (after skimming the oil off the top of sauce.)  As we prefer strong-flavored food, I made the following changes as suggested by others:

Used 2 chicken leg quarters, skin on
Baked covered for 40 minutes at 350 degrees
Uncovered and baked 35 minutes at 400 degrees
Saved half the sauce for use when basting
Used half the margarine
Doubled the curry powder
Used spicy brown mustard
Used Creole seasoning instead of salt, and sprinkled half of it directly on the chicken before covering in sauce.  Put the remaining seasoning into the sauce.

Made this way, I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make this again!

Absolutely Wonderful...I'm not a big fan of mustard and thought it would overpower the dish but it doesn't at all. I cut the margarine in 1/2 and had a lot of liquid left over. I'll probably omit the butter or use even less the next time I make this. Thanks....

My family LOVED this recipe!!!  I tend to make chicken a lot and they groaned when they heard we were having it again, but they raved about this recipe and gobbled it up.  My son smelled the curry while baking and imediately had issues (he doesn't like it) but ended up having seconds. Very easy to make.  I did cut the butter by half, and I added a tsp. of chopped garlic and used Dijon mustard.  I baked it covered at 350 for 30 minutes and uncovered for about 40 minutes more, basting every 15 min during the uncovered time.

I'm often one ingredient shy of a recipe, and this time was no exception.  I had no honey, but noticed in a similar recipe, a woman had used corn syrup as a substitute, and it worked, so I altered this recipe a bit.  I did have some honey mustard in the cupboard, so I used:  1/4 cup corn syrup, 1/3 cup honey mustard, 2 tsp curry powder, two dashes cayanne pepper, 1 tsp salt, and about 6 tbsp of butter.  It was really good, but next time I would double all of the above, and reserve half the sauce to pour over at the midway point.  I also used 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts, and the timing was fine.  Put this over white rice, and double the sauce.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy, and the chicken turned out golden and moist.  Instead of using a whole chicken, I halved the recipe and used 4 chicken thighs.  I also added minced garlic and black pepper. I think next time I will skip the curry powder and see how that tastes.  The flavor was good, but I'd like to see how it tastes without the curry.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum, yum, yum, yum, YUM!  This recipe was EXCELLENT.  I loved the flavor!  I don't like a whole lot of curry in a recipe , but this sauce gave the chicken just enough curry to make it taste good.  I also used only 1/4 c. of margarine to save on the calories and Dijon mustard instead of the regular prepared kind.  Delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this dish.  I'm not sure what I like more - the wonderful taste or how easy it was to make!  I used chicken legs and didn't think it was greasy like some other reviewers.  As soon as it was done, I took the chicken out of the pan and onto a serving dish.  If you leave the chicken in the pan, it will become greasy.  I added a little bit of the pan drippings to my rice and that was delicious!  My husband does not like mustard or curry powder in his dishes, so I didn't say a word about this having BOTH!  He could not tell and liked the chicken.

I have to give this recipe 3 stars only because of my love for baked chicken... I was sooo disappointed in this sweet greasy chicken, I can't believe it got such great reviews!!! I think that anyone can find a better chicken recipe here...Try Apricot Chicken I submitted by Shirley Rickey for a wonderful sweet baked chicken... Sorry to be so negative!!!

WOW!!!  This dish was soooooo good!!  I can't wait to make it again for company!  I halved the butter and used 2 tsp curry powder....next time I'll cut the butter down even more and add another tsp of curry, since we love curry.  Served it with basmati rice.

With all the great ratings, I thought this would be delicious... but I was dissapointed. I only used drumsticks and maybe that was the problem. All the butter made this gooey and fattening.    I don't think I'll be making this again.

The sauce was great. I used it with chicken thighs (will try chicken breasts next time though because Im a white meat fan). I added extra curry and doubled the sauce over all. After chicken was cooked, I put the drippings in a saucepan with water, a bit of flour and a bit of milk and made a thicker sauce which we served over couscous!! It was perfect!

This recipe was ok...not great!  I too cut down on the butter, but still lots of grease even though I skinned and cut off all the fat off the chicken.  Flavor was pretty good though and I should have thickened the sauce to put on the rice I also prepared to go with it.   Really don't think I'll make this one again.

Loved this recipe!  I only used 2 leg quarters (2 thighs, 2 legs).  I slashed and stabbed the chicken before putting it in the casserole dish to make sure th marinade would permeate the chicken.  I used about 3 pats of butter instead of the recommended amount and used maybe a tablespoon of mustard.  I also  fried a sliced onion and added it to the marinade.  I basted the chicken a few times while it was cooking and raised the temp to 400.  It was done in an hour and tasted so good with basmati rice and cinnamon, honey and brown sugar flavored carrots!!!  My picky 2 year old loved the rice with gravy mixed in and asked for more.  I think this would even taste great with wings too!

This recipe is great. I have never done a whole chicken. I usually use 2 lbs. of thighs or breasts cut in half. Then everything else by the recipe. Don't try to cook over 350 because it gets dried out. Great recipe if you have 2 hours to cook it.

This really rocks!  I cut the butter in half, added some crushed red pepper, baked at 400 for an hour, turning every 15 minutes or so.  Great glaze, spicy, sweet and tangy. We'll have this often!

This was wonderful and turned out very well with a few changes.  I used boneless thighs and decided to cook this on the stove top.  I browned the thighs with a bit of garlic and had the sauce prepared to add in the pan.  I also added some cubed potatoes....poured the sauce in and added some water.  I cooked it on medium heat for a long time until the sauce reduced and became thicker.  The curry flavouring with the honey and mustard was fabulous.  Served with salad ...and voila...a great meal.

I thought this was good, but I really love curry powder.  My dog apparently loved it - I heard a big *crash* in the kitchen while my husband and I were watching a movie after dinner... found my dog face-first in the leftovers after he had knocked it off the kitchen table :-)  I will make it again, but probably I will use cubed or strips of boneless chicken baked in the curry sauce over rice.

Absolutely Wonderful!!!  I used dijon mustard instead of the curry and regular mustard. I also used half the butter. Instead of basting I turned the chicken about every 20 minutes or so. There are only three of us and we cleaned up an entire chicken! That's how good it was,not a scrap was left. I'll be making this at least once a week and maybe more often. Next time I'll do two chickens. You must try this!

Whole family loved this!  Easy, no-fuss recipe with great flavor.  The house smells wonderful as this is cooking!  Could use any chicken pieces and just adjust cooking time accordingly.  Especially loved the crispy skin the glaze gave the chicken.

This was a good dish. My dinner guest loved it. It was so easy to put together. You do have to do regular check-ins to baste it, but other than that it was easy and delicious. By the way, I used "ice-glazed" chicken quarters which you do not  thaw before cooking, so I extended the cooking time by approx. 1/2 hr.

This one is a must have!!  It mixed up quickly and easily.  I used half the butter, and only a pinch of curry.  I also doubled it and poured it over 13 chicken thighs.  Baked 50 min and it came out beautifully.  You MUST try it!!

This was an excellent flavor combination. I made baby potatoes and carrots with the chicken and it was a hit! I will definitely make this again.

I made this with bone in thighs and it was really, really good ( my husband ate 3 pieces). The only thing I did different is added  fresh garlic and doubled the recipe for the sauce. I coated the chicken with 1/2 the sauce and baked covered for 45 min, then brushed on the other  1/2 every 10 min until cooked and the tops were crispy. Will for sure make this again!

Family ate it up! I made a few of my own changes. Used all bone in pieces and left skin on as suggested. I choose to use  less butter, increased the curry, (love curry) mixed dijon an prepared mustards. Added pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Key to a beautiful tender piece of chicken...Its all 'bout the baste, 'bout the baste! Paired it with an Asian salad!

The taste was great! Next time I will take other reviewers suggestions to use only half the butter and will also use a bigger pan to spread the chicken out more and hopefully achieve a thicker sauce

Really tasty :) I followed the recipe exactly asides from a couple small changes: I cut the butter in half, even that amount was pushing it. I added 1tsp of soya sauce to the mix instead of salt and that boosted the flavour as well. I cooked with foil on for half an hour and removed it.

This is one of the simplest, most delicious chicken recipes I have ever made. It is also so tender. For those that don't like mustard it does not overpower the flavor of the chicken. The honey adds a beautiful sweetness that balances out the tang of the mustard. It's so yummy, and a family favorite! Neither of my kids like mustard, but they devour this chicken!

This is the best baked chicken recipe I've ever made. My 3 kids loved it.  It is easy and cheap too. The 1st time I made it I used a whole chicken without cutting it up. It still came out perfect. And I also cut the butter in half. Tonight I'm making it with skin on, bone in chicken thighs. I'll just keep an eye on the time. It may not take as long.

mmm... I don't usually have curry powder on hand so I used half garam masala, half cumin. used bold spicy-ish mustard and yellow. halved the butter. This was just to suit my personal taste, but I can tell even without these changes this recipe is a keeper. I marinated mine for 6-8 hours because I had the time, next time I will try without marinating. as others suggested, I covered and then bumped up the heat to 400 and uncovered for 15-20 mins.

It was way better than expected.  I would  half the butter, covered with foil for 30 minutes then uncovered and basted till done.. Nice over rice.  I will thicken the gravy a bit next time.

Very good.  It's a versatile recipe that I will be playing with next time I make it.  1/4 cup butter is plenty as other reviewers have noted.  I will double the curry because we love curry and also add a couple of cloves of crushed garlic.  Sprinkle green onions on top.

As other reviewers have said, this recipe can be used with most any chicken 'parts'.  I used skinless thighs just to be a bit healthier but I bet that skin would be delicious!  Maybe next time I will splurge with that extra fat.  Just that once of course...:-).

It was okay for something that didn't take much trouble to make, but very bland. I think it needed marinating or something first.

Great recipe!  Its fast and easy, and I like making it for potlucks or guests, or just the family.  It also doubles and triples well. These are my changes: 
1. Instead of adding salt, I brine my chicken in salt water a couple hours ahead of time (this helps the chicken retain some of its juices better).
2. I use some of the butter and brown the chicken on the stove first (takes 10-20 minutes of cook time, but reduces the bake time and makes for more tender chicken)
3. I bake the chicken for 40-50 minutes, covering part time, and uncovering for the last 20 minutes.
4. I mix up the sauce in the fry pan after I remove the chicken pieces, then pour it over the chicken pieces in the baking pan.
5. I use 3 pounds of drumsticks in place of chicken pieces.

Everyone loved this recipe! I tweaked it a bit. Half the butter and even there probably could have dropped it a bit more. Doubled the curry, used sweet and spicy prepared mustard, 1/4 chopped onion, 1 clove of garlic and baked at same temperature but covered with foil for first 30 minutes and then uncovered and basted every 8 mins or so. Finally broiled for last 2 mins.

I cooked this last night and wow!!!  I did find a couple of the reviews helpful. I halved the butter and the honey. used creole mustard, Louisiana spice, a dash of cayenne, and garlic.  I cooked the chicken as suggested covered for thirty minutes and then removed the chicken.  i added four large sweet potatoes sliced thick and cut in half spread across the pan and then put the chicken in and among the potatoes. Not a morsel of anything left!   My daughter used bread to clean the dish!!!!  So with this in mind, I will double the sauce next time and cook two 9x13 pans of this.  This is truly one of the easiest and best chicken dishes I have ever cooked and eaten!  Rave reviews from all.  I actually can't wait to cook it again….and again… Thank you Gretchen!

Rich flavor with few ingredients.  My family enjoyed it.  I halved the butter portion, doubled the curry, and added pepper, garlic, onions, and seasoning salt to satisfy our palate.   Marinated thighs, drumsticks, and wings in the honey sauce for 2 hours, then baked covered with foil for first 30 minutes, then uncovered for the rest as recommended by some raters.  However, in the pursuit of the perfect brown finish, I prolonged the bakery time, and unfortunately over cooked it.  Family still enjoyed the flavors without even realizing the  over baked state of the chicken like I did.  I will try it without the foil next time for a more tender quality to final chicken product.  Thanks!

This really is a simple and good recipe and just like the other reviewers said you would need to add more curry than required or you would just have honey mustard sauce... I also think you do need to add cyannne pepper and most def decrease the butter.. In fact you can substitute the better for EVOO. Add some garlic powder & slice onions over the chicken before pouring the sauce over it.. Cover with foil for the first 40 minutes of baking .. then take the cover off turn up temperature to 400 degrees .... OMG the taste is great I did this over to big leg quarters.. The next time I do it I will let the chicken marinate in the sauce in a ziplock bag overnight. Also poke holes in the chicken for a full marinade . I also suggest using a Dijon mustard or Spicy mustard ... just so you will not have THE TYPICAL HONEY MUSTARD flavor.. Also adding Gram Marsala will put a good twist on it.

This was a great recipe, and so easy to make! Next I am going to try some of the other variations I have read such as using dijon mustard and adding garlic! My family loved it though! Even my picky, 73 year old mother, who normally doesn't like chicken, ate this and liked it!! (I made one boneless breast just for her! The rest was legs and thighs)This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

Wicked good.  Used combo of oil oil/sunflower oil but only 2 Tbsp, increased curry to 1 1/2 tsp, decreased salt, used spicy honey mustard and added minced garlic.  Marinated chicken legs, bone-in, overnight (hence using oil instead of butter).  Also per suggestions, cooked 37 min covered, then rest uncovered.  Really yummy.  Thank you for sharing.  10 yr daughter LOVED it!

oh WOW!!! Could not get enough of this!!!!! The entire family loved it. I would add at least twice the salt (for my taste) but that's a minor quibble. In my case I used a "Jamaican style" curry. Amazing flavor! I can't wait to make it again!!!!

I guess I should have known that since I'm not a huge curry fan, I should not try a recipe like this. I used two boneless-skinless chicken breasts, and then for the rest of the 3 pounds I needed, I used some tenders. (I had this frozen chicken on hand). I used brown mustard, and used about 1/3 cup butter. Also chopped up an onion and baked along with it. Really just okay, I wasn't super impressed.

My family loved!!! this recipes..it went over really well in our home and we were all scrambling for the left over pieces..now I used chicken wings instead b/c the market doesn't sale what i needed but they were still a hit..I simply seasoned before hand with salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder..let that sit for a while..I then made the sauce but kind of free handed b/c I knew I would need/want extra..so I kept the amount of butter the same (1/2c), but used 3/4c honey, 1/4 +1/8 (half of 1/4c) mustard, a sprinkle or two of fine salt and used 2tbs curry, plus a sprinkle (eyeball) onion & garlic powder and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper..brought all these to a boil (which also thickened as it cooled)..I basted the chicken, covered it and put it in the oven to bake..after about 45mins i took off the foil, basted my wings and continued to baste till they were done and I was out of sauce..plus It made its own juice in the bottom 
:-))..thanks to the other reviewers for their comments..it helped..

While the sauce had good flavor, it was too loose for my liking.  Also I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and I cooked it for the 75 minutes listed in the recipe. I thought that seemed too long, but I left it in the oven anyway.  The chicken breasts turned out very dry even though there was sauce.

I loved the idea of the simplicity.  I used this as a base for my chicken. 1/3 c of honey, 2 tbls butter, 2 tbls orange infused oil (wonderful stuff!)and since I didnt have curry I used a Penzey Spice called Mural of Flavor.  I didnt feel like cutting up the chicken so I put the mixture under the skin.  Everyone loved it.

Pretty good. Used all chicken legs instead of a whole chicken. Not really into honey by always like to give it a chance if the recipe sounds good enough. Probably wouldn't make again.

My entire family loved this, I used bone in thighs, it was very moist. My eleven year old said it was melt in your mouth.  I made the recipe as is with the exception on half the butter. Cooked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 40, basting twice. Definitely a keeper!

I made this with boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Instead of curry powered I added about a tablespoon of green curry paste, I also replaced half the amount of honey with agave nectar….The butter I kept at half a cup and then just added some sea salt and a squirt of dijon mustard (I didn't have any mustard powered).

The result was amazing…..I also poured off the sauce from the pan and reduced on the stove for about 10 minutes then drizzled the thick sauce (it looked like caramel) over the chicken before I served it….

There was no leftovers and I can't wait to make it again!

This was so so good!  I used boneless, skinless thighs and baked them at 300 for 35 minutes covered, then took the foil off, raised it to 325 and cooked them another 35 minutes. I took other people's advice and used only 1/4 cup butter, which was perfect- not greasy at all- and added about 1/4 cup minced fresh red onion (only because I had it and needed to use it) My son didn't like it because he's picky so I think next time I might add some spice.  Next time I also might try using dijon instead of yellow mustard (Only because I'm compelled to change recipes!)  It went perfectly with basmati rice and steamed broccoli, using the sauce like a gravy.

Made this last night, and it was delicious!  My family loved it!  I used 7 chicken thighs with the skin on.  I halved the butter, doubled the curry, and added 1 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Even after cutting the butter in half, there was enough sauce to ladle over white rice and the chicken.  Also served a dinner salad.  My family requested I make it again!

Enjoyed this but wish the flavors would be more absorbed within the chicken. Still pretty good and will probably make this again someday.

I made it for the first time tonight and served it to guests; they just raved about it and I could tell that they meant it! Not only does it taste amazing - it also makes for a mouth-watering presentation glazed in that honey mustard curry sauce. The mustard that I used was Dijon.

I am a chicken lover in a house of red meat men. Those boys were speechless when I served this baby up! The flavors were amazing and so perfect! I have made it 3 times since I first discovered it and have not been disappointed! I did cut back on the butter after the first time to about 1/4 a cup and I added the dash of cayenne to give it a little extra kick. Overall, a wonderful recipe that is now a part of my routine meals!

I've done this recipe for years. you can even leave out the butter and just spray the pan with non-stick spray. It turns out the same but less fat.

All I had on hand were drumsticks to use. My family loved it, they said the flavour was amazing and have asked for it again. I'm not a fan of chicken with skin, or eating off bone so wasn't as thrilled with the turn out as the family was. I found the chicken didn't get crispy enough for me. However, the flavour WAS amazing. I am going to make this tonight using skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I didn't make it exactly as written, I followed another reviewers suggestions and cut back the butter and added a couple minced garlic cloves and a pinch of cayenne powder. But overall, this is an amazingly flavourful recipe that I will be using again and again. Thank you Gretchen!

WOW! The only thing I changed was the cooking time, I left it 15 more minutes in there. Also next time I'll put a little more curry powder in the butter mix but this was really really good.

I read the reviews first (ofcourse)and cut the butter and salt by half. Everything else I kept the same. I used (4)bone-in chicken quarters,so I baked it 30 minutes covered with foil and 40 minutes uncovered, basting every 15 minutes. I checked it with a meat thermometer and it was very done by then. The skin was nicely carmelized and the chicken was moist. My son raved about how much he loved it. I will make it again and use boneless breast just to see how that works. I covered the pan with aluminum foil for easy clean up.

It was great, the only thing is I wanted those flavors to be in the chicken also. Maybe should marinate the chicken overnight. My pieces of leg quarter so I just used more and added few more spices. I loved it

This was very good and will definitely make again. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and increased the curry to 1 1/2 tsp. Otherwise everything else was the same. Would be very good on tenderloin too! Going to try that next! Thanks for the recipe!

Yum.  My husband and 3 year old loved this too.  I only used half of the butter, added some minced garlic, doubled the curry and added a bit of corn starch (1 Tablespoon) with water so that it could thicken a little as it cooked.  It was eaten all up!

Awesome!  I also doubled the curry and added some minced garlic and ginger.  The sauce is also great when mixed with veggies (potatoes, carrots, peas, cauliflower) and baked.

make something very like this all the time - I use 6 - 8 chicken thighs and find that with the skin on the chicken you DON'T need the butter - cover the baking dish with foil and take it off for the last 15 min basting once or twice

I have to say that for a spur of the moment recipe, it was a hit with my family. I have to say that I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken and my 7 year old which is very fussy about her meats ate it all in an intstant before even touching her rice. Next time, I will try marinating it before putting it in the oven.Great recipe!

Yum! I followed brown sugar girl's tweaks and used 1/4 c coconut oil liquid that I had on hand (found at whole foods) instead of butter.  The flavors were amazing!

The chicken came out great.  I halved all the ingredients and didn't have any curry so I left that out as well.  I loved the way the sauce came out and next time will make just the chicken wings with it.

Wonderful taste! my whole family liked it even the picky 3 year old. I reduced the butter and since i made it in chicken wings I added a bit of cayenne pepper to half! gave it a little kick that complemented the flavor, definitely will make more!

This recipe was surprisingly good.  This is my first time cooking with curry since I have always been a little afraid I wouldn't like it, but it was very good!  I used boneless chicken thighs and only about 1 tbsp of yellow mustard since I'm not a big fan of the stuff.  Everything else I followed exactly and it turned out great!

Very tasty recipe.  Instead of a whole chicken, I just used whole bone-less/skinless chicken breasts.  I think the recipe would have been  better had I cut them into pieces instead of leaving whole.  Very easy to make and very tasty.  It would be good served over rice or some noodles.

Excellent! For two large bone-in breasts, I used 2 TBs butter, honey, and mustard, and 1/2 tsp hot curry. Well-seasoned with s&p, I baked them covered for 1 1/4 hrs, then uncovered with the glaze for another 45 min. Fall-off-the-bone tender and very moist. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful, simple recipe. I did half the butter and used garlic powder instead of salt.  Baked 375º for one hour, turned at 15 and 30 then basted at 45 and 1 hour.  Lastly, broiled each side for 2 minutes and rest for 10.  Fall apart yummy! Thank you sharing

This has become a regular dinner menu item at our house.  I've made it a couple of times now and really find that it calls for too much butter. I've cut it in half it thought that it was still too much butter, so I will only be using 2TBS next time.  But the sauce under the butter is so delicious.  My 4 & 2yr old love this chicken.

Was 5 stars with changes. Used dijon mustard, cut butter in half, scant honey, lots of onions and 1 clove of garlic. Next time will try adding potatoes and carrots and top with green onions.

This was awesome! Like the other posts mentioned, I cut the butter, doubled up the curry powder, and added cayenne pepper! Tastes like something you would have at an Indian restaurant. We loved it and will be making it again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I would recommend using the drippings to make a gravy.  I served over rice and the meal came together nicely.

I really liked this - I cut the 'marinade' in half (didn't realize I only had 1/2 a stick of butter left!) and used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Served it with brown rice and crescent rolls.  I tossed some milk and cornstarch into the sauce after the chicken was done to thicken it up and poured it over the chicken and rice.  My husband unfortunately was not a fan, which is disappointing because I thought it was very good!  The reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because it didn't blow me away, and it won't become a staple in our household, but I think it was definitely worth making and I personally would love to have it again.

This was FANTASTIC!!! I was a little unsure because I have never cooked a whole chicken before, and my chicken, was actually two- three pounds bigger than what it says to have in the recipe. It was very sweet, but not too sweet. It was just right. Will DEFINANTLY make this again!!! :D

This was good. Definitely too much butter and that's coming from someone who's trying to gain weight....it just separated from being too oily....but other than that, it was a good meal. It's basically a jazzed up honey mustard chicken, but I like the flavor curry lends and that the sauce forms more of a glaze. It was perfect served with white corn on the cob and broccoli and cheese.

great flavor - hubby loved it! the only issue is that if you do not baste it religiously, it will blacken and the picky youngsters in your house will fuss.

This was sooo good!  I am not crazy about cooking with so much fat and sugar but it was delicious.  Even my 4 year old son ate it and he only eats chicken in the form of nuggets. It was not to overpowering my 1 year old also loved it.  YUM YUM YUM!  And, so easy.

This dish was a hit with my family! I took the suggestion of others and cut the butter in half. I also covered the chicken with foil the first thirty minutes then basted the chicken several times the remaining forty five minutes.

I love this chicken!! We've had it twice in 2 weeks and it never gets old. Definitely used the 2 tbsp of butter and 30 minutes covered, 40 minutes uncovered. This is a great dish!

This recipe has become a favorite in my family and part of the regular rotation. I use half the butter and cover during the first 30 minutes per the recipe reviews. I serve it with rice because the sauce is a perfect topping. Really love this!

OMG YUM. This chicken was superb! I even left out the salt, didn't sound like it would need it for whatever reason, and it didn't! This was super easy and quick. I did use about a tablespoon of curry powder and really only notice a nice hint of it in the chicken. Awesome lunch, thanks!

This was absolutely delicious! I used chicken wings only and not the whole chicken. Next time I will fry the chicken first, maybe with some flour, and then add the mixture and put in the oven.

Excellent flavor. Who would have thought adding curry to this would give it the perfect zest? Like others, I too halved the butter and increased the curry.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's fabulous. KID friendly too. Instead of prepared mustard I use dijon and it adds a little more zip. This dish is a staple in my house.

Definitely one of my regulars!  Cut butter in half, double the curry powder, and only cook for 1 hour.

I thought this recipe was delicious and easy. Per the other reviews I cut the butter in half and it was more than enough. I also added more like a Tbls. of curry. I think next time I would add even more curry! I personally think you can't go wrong with curry. I used drumsticks for this recipe (skin removed) and I did let the chicken marinate for a few hours prior to baking. I always cut a few slits into my chicken when marinating. I baked covered for 40 minutes and then uncovered for approx. 30-35 minutes basting and turning the chicken every so often. The chicken came out perfectly moist and so flavorful. I served with basmati rice and a carrot and pea medley with some Middle Eastern spices. My husband and I loved it! We even have enough for lunch tomorrow! Thanks Gretchen, for a simple and yummy recipe.

Mixed reviews with my family but still give it a 4.  I already knew I would love this recipe because I love honey mustard & curry. I did not cut the chicken into pieces, instead, I did the spatchcocking way (fancy word for butterflied lol), followed some suggestions and covered for the first 30 minutes, halved the butter, & doubled the curry.

Where to begin.  I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients.  While it was cooking, my husband began asking when it would be done.  He LOVED the smell.  My son in law ate it and loved it and he is so picky.  My daughter loved it.  I loved it.  I only had five chicken thighs to work with.  I cut the butter in half as others suggested.  I covered the pan with foil for thirty minutes, then let it cook uncovered the rest of the time.  I was surprised how it browned up so nicely.  Basting with the juices is definitely key.   I served it with brown rice and steamed fresh broccoli from the garden.  This is definitely a keeper!  Just an FYI... days later and family members are STILL commenting on how good this was.

Not sure why there is so much butter in this dish, because really it just sat in a ton of butter and cooked. I would like to try it again but with MUCH less butter and honey so the curry can stand out a little more.

Very yummy!  I cut the butter by 1/2 and next time will cut to about 1/4 of suggested recipe.  Other than that this was delicious!  Everyone likes it!  I served it with quinoa and sauteed bell peppers.  The sauce was ecellent on the quinoa!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed the advice to cover for 30 min with foil and then bake another 40 min basting every 10 or so and they turned out perfectly cooked and nice and brown on the outside.

This dish was so delish!  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of pieces.  I also added a minced clove of garlic and used dijon mustard.  When I tasted the sauce alone I was disappointed, but then with the chicken and potatoes it was so good!  I never had curry before and wanted to try something different.  So glad I did!!!!!

Real tasty, glad I tried this recipe.  I of course had to make it my own, and love spicier foods, so I added some sriracha hot sauce, turned out perfect!  Anyone reading reviews, pay attention to reducing butter qty in half, unless using skinless chicken.

This is one of the best baked chicken recipes I have found.  It is absolutely delicious, the combination of flavors combining to make something so much better than you can imagine.  I was afraid it would be too sweet or that the curry flavor would be too strong but no one ingredient takes charge of the taste.  I was pleased as punch with the results and will be making this again!

This is easy to put together.  The only thing is that I wish the curry had stood out a little more.  I would add more curry the next time I cooked it, and some heat a dash of hot pepper sauce.

I used Grey Poupon mustard (because I use it rather than yellow in EVERYTHING that calls for mustard) , decreased the butter & increased the curry. My kitchen smelled fabulous & my dad (whom I made a portion for) actually called from his home state today just to say how good it was.

Delicious and tender!  Very easy to prepare.  I removed the skin from the chicken to make it a bit healthier.  I also used only half the amount of butter, spicy brown mustard and Madras curry powder.  It was perfect. I served the chicken with Basmati rice, steamed broccoli and a salad (butterleaf, red grapes, thinly sliced Gala apples, shaved sharp white cheddar, and a light vinaigrette made with white wine vinegar).  Hubby loved it.

I've made this twice now and its officially a staple that's going in our regular rotation.  We love it!  I cut the butter in half, baked covered with foil for 30 mins, then uncovered for another 40.  Comes about fabulous!  I served it with white rice and poured the sauce over...so simple and tasty, thank you!  Edited to add that I've made this so much this past summer that I got lazy and ditched the foil, comes out perfect every time.

Very good. I like to let it marinate for a few hours. I used 1/4 cup Smart Balance and 1 tblsp curry powder. I also added some cayenne and garlic. Very good.

This chicken was just superb!  I tend to be leery of a lot of sauces for baked chicken because the flavor only tends to stick to the outside but this sauce bakes right in and you can taste the flavor all the way through in every bite.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  It will definitely be a long-standing favorite around here cooked often! :)

Very good - gives the chicken a distinctively sweet and subtle curry flavor.  Chicken is moist and perfectly cooked.  (My version - 1.5 lb chicken boneless thighs with 3 handfuls of chopped potatoes with halved ingredients for 30 min covered and 45 uncovered)

delicious! I used boneless chicken thighs, just a small amount of butter and grilled them instead of baking - but it came out great. Will definitely make again - maybe add a little more curry.

AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly- I only changed the cooking method. I threw 4 frozen thighs into my slow cooker and cooked it on high for 4.5 hours. It was fall off the bone, moist perfection! Oh and by the way. . . . I don't do honey mustard ANYTHING and I thought these were amazing! I did remove the juices from the slow cooker and put it on the fire with flour to make it a gravy. I used the gravy not just on the chicken but on the brussels sprouts we had with the chicken. I Highly recommend this recipe AS WRITTEN!!!!!!!!

This recipe was okay.  I think it would have been better if only dark meat was used.  The chicken breast was a little dry.  Definately needs to be eaten right away, doesnt taste right the second day.  I bet cooking it in a crock pot would be easier and make the meat more tender.

YUM - this honey/mustard/curry mixture is divine.  Don't be afraid of the curry - this doesn't taste like a 'curried' dish.  It just gives the honey/mustard mixture an outstanding kick.  This is going in the regular roster!

I have made this recipe many times and make it as the recipe states. It is like comfort food, it is that good. And the best thing is that it takes 5 minutes to put together. The only thing I have to say is that it doesn't keep well. I tried eating it the following day and it just wasn't the same, the punch of the contrasting sweet and savoury flavors just didn't stay. It is however, so good that leftovers probably won't happen.

I made this with 1/4 cup butter, and had to use honey mustard.  I also had to use a little agave syrup as I only had 1/3 cup honey.  Used same amount of salt and curry.  This was so good.  This will be made again and again!  I want to take the excess sauce and toss it with rice.  Yumm....next time!

This is an amazing sauce! I sauteed the sauce using a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins cut into bite size pieces.  It was amazing! My wife and mother in law both loved it! I used half yellow and half stadium mustard-next time will use slightly less butter and will saute in some onion and possibly peppers! Added some crushed red pepper for some extra spice!! Will continue to tinker since I love curry and love hot!

Spectacular recipe!  I am guilty of making a few minor changes, but I am convinced that it would have been worthy of five stars exactly as written.  My only changes were to replace most of the butter with olive oil, and add more curry, along with turmeric (already in the curry, but I added more), a touch of paprika, green onions, minced garlic, and fresh ginger.  It's now tied for first place among all of my chicken recipes.

This turned out remarkably good!!  I used a 3lb bag of frozen chikn breasts. It turned out to be 6 breasts and there was plenty of sauce! I put some butter on the bottom of the dish, laid the chikn then poured the sauce all over. I didn't use a whole stick of butter or all the salt it called for. I used regular mustard. My husband is NOT a mustard fan but he said this one is his new fav. I made Rach's broccoli casserole to go with it. Delish!

I used this recipe with 5lbs of drumsticks and thighs for a youth group dinner (about 12 teens). At the end of dinner only one thigh was left!  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe!  *Only modification I made was to marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight.

WOW! YUM! This was super delicious and easy to make. I followed this recipe using 4 skinless chicken breast halves and only 2 tablespoon of Smart Balance butter. Also, since I didn't have any curry powder, I used about 2 tablespoon combination of chili powder, cumin and coriander. I marinated the chicken for 3 hours then baked in a closed foil for 30 mins. The remaining 40 mins, I opened the foil, added chopped carrots and potatoes then basted the chicken and veges every 15 mins. The chicken came out very tender and flavorful. I poured the sauce over the chicken and veges and served this with brown rice. I would definitely make this again and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Gretchen for sharing this wonderful recipe. =)

Was skeptical at first but it turned out delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed. My son who never eats anything gobbled up the chicken. My daughter liked it as well.  This is one I will keep and make again. Very easy and smells wonderful when cooking.

I made this with chicken thighs and it was the BEST curry dish I've ever had. The curry isn't overpowering which is nice. My husband even enjoyed it and swears he hates curry.

I had chicken breasts on hand so I used those.  Probably would be better with bone-in chicken since it came out a bit dry.  Sauce was very good but I was a bit surprised how sweet it came out so next time I may decrease the amount of honey.  I did add minced garlic and cut down on the butter.  I do wish the sauce was thicker.  I would make this again with some minor changes!

Delicious! I used thighs and followed the suggestions to use foil for the first 30 minutes then remove and baste for the remainder of the time. I also used the suggestion to half the butter and add cayenne pepper and garlic. It turned out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again!

Wow this was DELISH!! Very very simple too, definitely something that the non-cook in the family could easily throw together in a pinch. I used grey poupon mustard and orange blossom honey and skinless chicken thighs. I loved the flavors used in the recipe, not a combo I would have come up with on my own but so perfect!  Thanks for sharing.

Amazing sauce.  Used only chicken thighs but will also use chicken breasts next time.  Don't change a thing - the house smells unbelievable and the taste very light.  As others suggested, covered with foil first half of baking time and then uncovered for chicken to get golden brown.  Definately a chicken recipe that will be used over and over.

I also cut the butter in half and did not miss it.  Otherwise the glaze is the same.  I used chicken thighs and ended up wrapping the casserole tightly in foil and leaving it in the oven at 200F for a few hours because I had to leave the house.  It was moist delicious!  The sauce is great over rice.  My 3 year old loved it.  Will make again.

I made a few substitutions, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and coconut oil in place of butter. I also shortened the cooking time by less than half, so my chicken didn't dry out. I served over seasoned rice, with steamed fresh broccoli on the side. It was delicious! My family can't wait for me to make this again!

Didn't change a thing, it was delicious.  I even used it over frozen chicken breasts without marinating, and it still turned out very flavorful.  Only thing is, it makes a TON - we had enough sauce leftover for two more dinners after.

This is a new family favorite.  I use half the butter (and sometimes sub olive oil for half that) to cut down on saturated fats.  My picky 9-y-o daughter ate four pieces last time I made it.

This was very good.  I covered the chicken with foil 1st as recommended, and am very glad I did, because covering it for 30 min. and baking uncovered for 45, it still got a bit too crisp.  I only used 1/2 the butter too, and didn't miss the extra at all. Served with rice, and the family loved it.

Excellent!  My husband cleaned both our plates.  Halved the butter & salt.  Added cayenne pepper,used gulden spicy mustard & a little honey mustard. marinated in fridge for about 1 hr.  Covered w/foil & cooked on low heat. Last 10 min uncovered and raised temp.  Next time might throw some peanuts in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent.  I used chicken breasts, just a small amount of butter and instead of curry I used cumin and some horseradish.  I made sure to marinate overnight and baste while cooking.  Super tender and great flavor.

Fantastic!  The honey mustard sauce was perfect, with the nice sweet flavor.  I also marinated the chicken in the sauce for a few hours, causing the chicken to be tender and flavorful!

made it for dinner - it was delicious - I used a grainy mustard as suggested.  Did not have curry powder - used garlic powder.  that is why I didn't give it 5 stars, since I did not use curry.

trying to be healthier i used 2 boneless chicken breast and sliced them length ways into 1 inch thick strips.  I mixed the ingredients up in square glass dish  and layed the chicken in the dish. covered and baked for  1 hour, then uncovered and baked for another 10 minutes.  I served with white rice and peas.. this was delicious.  the sauce was dribbled over the rice and the curry just made the recipe a 7 star. it was yummy.. I did make one change.  I used half the butter asked for and it was plenty buttery.

I made this using 5 chicken breasts still with bones and skin. I cut the butter in half and used half salt, half seasoning salt. I covered it with foil for 45 minutes and then basted and cooked the last 30 minutes uncovered. It turned out very moist!  Next time I make it I will make the sauce ahead of time and let it marinate first. My husband ate another piece the next day and commented on how good it was and how it really soaked up the flavors.

WOW!!!  This was phenomenal!!!  The only changes I made were halving the butter and using boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  We don't typically have the same things over and over but I can definitely see having this every week or two!

Awesome recipe! Another recipe idea with this would be to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts, double the curry (for my taste, and I would omit the salt) and marinate overnight.  This would make a great chicken sandwich!

This is one of the very few recipes each of my 3 children love and ask for! It is so simple and easy to make. I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut it into pieces which shortens the cooking time. Other than that, that is the only revision I make. Perfect for busy moms with picky eaters in the house!

I made this tonight and it turned out good but not great. I did everything the same but i covered it for the first 45 mins and left it uncovered 15 mins and basted it 2 or 3 times. The only thing I was disapointed in was how thin the sauce was. I tried added 2 ts of cornstarch when it was done but that just gave it a powdery texture which was not horrble but not good. Overall, I would make it again but try to figure a way to thicken the sauce when after its done.

Absolutely incredible!  We made this with Salmon at the last minute, this was the most succulent honey-mustard sauce you have tasted!  The curry powder is not overwhelming and hardly noticable for those who do not like "curry".  It gave a faint cinnamon aroma and added very little to the taste which was EXCELLENT!

I made this for Xmas dinner and it came out wonderful! I didn't cut the chicken into pieces. I just placed the sauce on the chicken and added some chicken stock and onions at the bottom of the pan. Then I basted the chicken every 15 mins. It was so delicious and the chicken had a very lovely golden color. The meat was also very juicy and fell right off the bone.

MOUTH WATERING RECIPE! My husband took his first bite of this chicken (free range) and said "oh my God" this is delicious! It was so good, I was thinking of making it two nights in a row. It's a keeper. P.S. I only used 3 chicken breasts, so I cut the butter amount in half and added a little more curry. YUM

This was really good.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and half the butter called for.  I used spicy brown mustard instead of plain yellow.  I baked mine at 375 for 40 minutes and it was tender and delicious.  Will make this again.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site!  I use chicken breasts rather than whole chicken pieces.  As per previous reviews, I cut the amount of butter in half.  I also usually don't have curry, so I substitute an equal amount of cumin and coriander with a dash of cinnamon.  Everything else is the same.  I bake it covered for 45 minutes and then uncover for the remaining baking time.  My husband and kids love this.

Excellent - better than I expected. I'm glad that there were so many good reviews to temp me to try it. I used about 1/4c butter, 1/4c honey, 2 TBSP mustard, dash of apple cider vinegar, season salt, some mustard powder, some garlic powder and the curry. I thought it was the right amount for 1 whole chicken, quartered. Also, I made it up at lunch time then put it in for dinner, so it marinated some - that probably didn't hurt. Yum! I'll make it again for sure - and may even try the original recipe exactly.

This chicken recipe was GREAT! I had 4 leg/thigh pieces, halved the sauce recipe, and marinated it in the fridge for a day and a night. In baking, I covered the chicken for the first 30 minutes and uncovered it for 25 minutes more, basting a few times. The chicken browned beatifully and the flavor was wild! I didn't have curry powder so I put together my own curry blend, mainly cumin and turmeric with dashes of chili powder, cardemon, cinnamon, black pepper, mustard, corriander, and ginger. Thank you Gretchen!

This was a very easy dish to prepare.  It was very good and the chicken was quite tender!  I served with brown rice and poured the extra sauce over the rice.  I did cut the butter in half.

This is sooooooooo good! My husband loves it.  I cubed a potato, steamed it for a few minutes, and then added it to the pan with the chicken. I used half of the butter. I also doubled the curry and added a pinch of cayenne pepper.   Cauliflower would also be great with this -- I will try adding that along with the potato next time. I served with CousCous mixed with peas, which made for a very pretty presentation!

Yum! I can't say enough about this fabulous chicken. It was perfect. I never crave things that I just ate, but I wanted to make this two or three nights later. I used four chicken breasts because that is what we had.

Very mild curry taste. Make sure to trim all the fat from the chicken thighs or it becomes too oily. Tastes great with chicken tenders and chicken breasts also. My mom even loved this dish and she hates chicken. Sh e even called and asked for the recipe on this one!!

I modified the proportions a bit: I halved the butter and doubled the curry but kept everything else the same and I used Dijon mustard. It came out delish!  So easy and tasty!!!

I made this with Boneless Chicken Breasts each cut  into 4 equal pieces. I marinated the chicken in the mixture over night. I transferred it to a baking dish and cooked as directed. It was fabulous! I had never cooked with curry before and this was so good. If you use boneless chicken breasts you have to adjust the cooking time to about 30 minutes or it will be too dry.

I gotta try this on skinless chicken breasts because unless you eat the skin you lose a lot of the flavor, but overall these are very juicy and tender especially if you keep them covered most of the cooking time.  You can also serve the chicken with drippings over rice. Yum!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because my husband really enjoy it.  I followed the recipe as written and I felt it was very bland. I really couldn't taste the sauce which was delicious by itself.  Next time, I will omit the butter all together and cook the chicken until half way through without the sauce.  I will baste towards the end of cooking but will leave a little extra sauce to be used as a dip during dinner.

I really loved this recipe. It's easy and delicious and you really could use it with any chicken.  The first time I used boneless chicken thighs and the second time I just used a whole chicken.  The sauce is great and yummy.

I topped with honey roasted sliced almonds for the last 10 minutes - looks great and it's delicious!  Serve with couscous for a different, easy and healthy side dish.  Foil line your dish for easier clean up.

Yum! Made this for dinner last night, we loved it. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut back on the butter, used dijon mustard and added some garam masala with the curry powder. Served it with brown rice and mixed steamed veggies. The whole family  enjoyed this meal.

Pretty good...I don't think I used quite enough honey.I had to adjust the measurements a bit because I had a little less than a 1/4 cup of mustard left. I think I might try again with boneless chicken.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out horrible. No one in my family would eat it and it ended up being thrown away. This was surprising because the recipe is so highly rated. The sauce was way too sweet and very thin. I tried to doctor it up but it just got worse. We ended up going out for burgers. I do not recommend making this. I realize now that all of the reviewers made major changes before reviewing but this turned out so bad that I can't imagine these changes making that much of a difference.

This is really easy to make and very delicious. I did cut back on the salt. Next time I am going to skin the chicken and see if it doesn't have more of the flavor in the meat. But my husband did love this as is.

This was very good! I pretty much followed the recipe. I removed the skin from the chicken pieces and seasoned them with Tony Chachere's original cajun seasoning. I pretty much season everything with Tony's before I start. This was a good recipe and I will make it again.

Loved it!  Cut the butter in half as most suggested.  Served this with boiled baby red potatoes and used the leftover sauce as a "gravy" for the potatoes.  Yummy!  :-)

My husband loved this recipe. I doubled the curry, and used only about 1 Tbs of butter. I also used honey dijon mustard. I cooked two boneless skinless chicken breasts and covered them for the first 30-45 minutes, still basting every 15. I only basted them real well before putting them in instead of pouring all the sauce on them, and basted them with the sauce that I hadn't used,  until they were done. They were tender and very yummy. I had even cut slits in the chicken to help it soak up the flavor.

This is an awesome recipe.  Really simple to make and tastes awesome.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast, cooked at 350 for 30 mins and it was done perfectly.  I think I used a smaller/deeper dish than instructed as there was no need to baste (added to easiness). I served the finished dish over white basmati rice with steamed carrots.  The sauce was really nice over the carrots too.  I think I will add some to the dish in the oven next time.  The other small change I may make next time is add a little flour or cornstarch so the final sauce is thickened a little bit.  Definitely going to make it into my regular rotation.  Thanks Gretchen!

I love it when I find a recipe that's this simple but tastes fantastic.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of a whole cut-up chicken.  Didn't change anything else, other than to cover it with foil for first bit as suggested by someone else.  This will become a regular in our kitchen.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Absolutely amazing. I halved the butter as previous reviews suggested, and used a combination of chicken breasts (cut in half)for my husband and myself, and drumsticks for the kids. SO delicious. I found myself sipping spoonfuls of the sauce as I was "cleaning" up after dinner...

It was easy and everyone asked for the recipe.  It was a little something "extra" (curry) that just made this a treat for a potluck.  I will definitely put this in my recipe box to make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night for Mom, granddaughter and her boyfriend, and DIL. I always use a squeeze of lemon before other seasoning on my chicken. Otherwise made per recipe. Had to take the chicken out of the pan and squeegie off the butter and honey, as I forgot to add the curry. Mixed that into the pan and re-coated the chicken. None was left over.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good but I am giving it 4 stars because it wasn't at all spicy.  I was expected some sort of heat to go with the sweetness and it just wasn't there.  However, it did taste good and went good with white rice and green onions.

So good! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and half the butter. The whole family loved it.

Absolutely delicious, the only things i did different was, i just bought a pack of chicken cutlets instead of a whole chicken and cut them up in to pieces (a heck of a lol easier) i didn't add the curry powder because my husband and i are not spicy food people, i did put tin foil on it like other reviewiers and didn't have to bast it, i took of the tin foil 10 minutes before the end of cooking time, delicious! husband LOVED! so easy to make, will keep on hand!

I am not a very talented cook, but I made this and it was delicious.  The whole family loved it.  The only variation i did was to half the butter as the other reviews say to.  This has become a favorite dish.

This recipe is wonderful.  It's in my favorites list.  I followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of butter.  I also seasoned the chicken (I used boneless, skinless breasts) with Beau Monde seasoning.  Honestly, I don't work or have any stock in Spice Islands, but everyone should have Beau Monde close at hand as a salt substitute, or seasoning.  I used Dijon mustard, as I much prefer it over yellow mustard.  Compliments to the chef!

I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, as other reviewers recommended, and added a couple dashes of cayenne and garlic powder.  I used skinless chicken thighs and covered with foil for the first 30 minutes, then baked uncovered for 40.  Basted every 20-25 minutes.  Voila-beautiful presentation, simple, and deeelicious.

Sorry, but we just did not care for this.  I was really disappointed - the sauce was really tasty before I added it to the chicken and baked it.  Once it was cooked, however, not so good!  In all fairness, I have never cooked with curry, so maybe that was it.  I'm surprised though because I like Indian food and I like all of the spices that comprise curry powder.  Anyway, I was almost embarrassed to serve this meal because I knew nobody would like it - I mean I wasn't even willing to eat it.  I served it with BBQ sauce on the side and that helped get it down. Three stars for ease of preparation and to compensate for the fact that maybe we just don't like curry.

Was looking for a baked chicken recipe to use with thigh quarters.  I came across this and had all the ingredients.  I have to say this recipe gives the chicken a truly delicious flavor.  I used a bit more curry than the recipe called for.  My husband loved it and I will definitely be making this one again.

I found it very easy to prepare and yummy for the whole family. While I was waiting for the oven to preheat I marinated the chicken and instead of butter I used margarine and added garlic powder.

Would give this 4.5 star if possible - used the other reviewers advice and halved the amount of butter.  Also mixed both dijon and spicy brown mustard (most reviewers used one or the other instead of prepared mustard).... another modification from other reviewers was to increase the amount of curry and add seasoning/garlic salt.  Overall a great recipe with a surprisingly unique and tasty combination of ingredients. With the changes, easily a 5+ star recipe!

This is a very good and easy chicken recipe.  I reduced the butter to a quarter cup, used Dijon mustard, substituted seasoned salt for regular salt and added a tsp. of garam masala (in addition to the curry powder).  I used three cut up chicken breasts and cooked it - covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for another 25 minutes.

I did not like this recipe. I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs. It really lacked flavory. I would at least recommend not leaving the skin on.

Wow!  My entire family liked this recipe.  That's pretty rare.  I had to modify the cooking because I didn't have an hour and a quarter to bake it.  So I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, seared them and then fried them to almost done in a skillet, poured on the sauce, and simmered them covered for about 20 minutes.  That was probably a little too long, the sauce nearly caramelized, but it was oh!so-good! I did make a couple sauce substitutions, as well: garlic salt instead of plain, and spicy brown mustard instead of yellow.  Thank you, Gretchen, for sharing this.  It got an enthusiastic "Make this again!"

I thought this was pretty good.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts so adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  I used a bit less butter then what was called for and substitued stoneground dijon mustard for regular.  But, the big plus was that my 3 year old ate it so it was a good way to introduce her to curry which she hasn't been keen on previously.

Great recipe for chicken breast.  I made a few changes/additions due to personal taste.  I used a little olive oil instead of butter, added cayenne pepper, a touch of brown sugar, and black pepper.  I marinated the chicken all day, cooked it covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes.  The outcome was a deliciously flavored moist chicken breast.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very good recipe. I baked in a casserole 7 chicken thighs, marinated 1 hour in the honey sauce, on a bed of slices of potato, carrot and onion  (30 min closed and 45 min open). I made the sauce without the butter (and 2 tsp of curry) with great success (thighs have already a lot of grease). The baked chicken had a nice color and pleasant taste. BTW, I added a pinch of cayenne in each thigh for an additional kick.

mixed feelings about this..yes, it tasted good..family liked it alot..how could they not? with loads of honey...but the truth is it uses a cup of honey which is pricey, a cup of butter which is super fattening, and not enough curry to really taste..if i make it again, i will definately use saucy susan or a honey marinade already made and just add curry to it..just wasnt worth all of that honey..

Yummy. What a delicious smelling dish! Although I could see the layer of fat in the baking pan, the chicken itself did not taste greasy. I used skinless chicken and halved the butter. But maybe next time I will keep the skin and skip the butter. Also, I used a convection toaster oven, so the chicken was done much sooner than the 75 minutes.

This is delicious, but I rate it a four as is, because I definitely think cutting the butter does the trick to step this up to a five.

I'm new to the site and my husband and I loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and were both talking about who gets the little bit left over.  I made the recipe exactly as written but used curry flavored mustard instead of curry powder.

I marinated a whole chicken in this and the roasted it in the oven. Yummy! I think next time I'll inject some of the sauce into the bird too.

Sorry... my husband and I didn't think there was anything terribly special about this recipe.  Maybe we did something wrong or had our hopes up too high, based on all the great reviews.  But it just wasn't very flavorful.

This chicken has such a great flavor.
I used breasts cut into small pieces and fried them, rather than baked, over medium high heat until chicken was cooked through.  I followed the recipe exactly on measurments and it was perfect!  I did add 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1/4 small chopped onion.  I used brown mustard instead of regular mustard in hopes to avoid the bitter taste I feared regular would create. I did not have extra sauce left over after frying. My husband does not like mustard and did not care for this dish.  I do like mustard and I loved this one!!  I served it over chicken rice.  It is just as good reheated.

My ultra-picky husband loved this chicken and requested that I make it more often. I did reduce the butter to 1/4 c. I also reduced the cooking time by baking for 30 min. covered with foil and then an addtl. 20 min. uncovered. I used frozen, boneless, skinless chicken thighs since that is what I had on hand. It was perfect. Thanks so much!

This was really good.  I used leg quarters and less butter as other reviews suggested.  Instead of pouring the sauce over it I brushed it on with a basting brush and added more a couple of times throughout the process.  I also covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes or so and then took it off for the remainder so that the skin would crisp up.

This was just okay for me. My kids liked it better than I did. The chicken didn't seem to take on enough of the flavor, but the sauce it made was really good over rice. It was good enough to try again to see if I can make it more to my personal preferences.

The whole fam agreed that this was really tasty! My only suggestion would be to cut the butter dramatically. Otherwise Great! I used a whole chicken, cut up but with skin still on. It was tasty, tender with crispy skin. Mmmm! This will be made regularly in our house!

Only thing I did different was in the baking part.  I did not baste every 15 min.  Instead, I covered w/foil and baked for 60 min then removed the foil and baked uncovered for 15 min.

After the first bite, I thought it was just ok but then it started tasting better and better.  We had this with rice and green beans and it was oh so good.  Our favorite part of the meal was the sauce on top of the rice.  Yum!  I cut the butter down to 1/4c as suggested.

My husband has named this his favorite meal yet. So easy and delicious. I made rice to pour all of that yummy sauce on. Don't use the full 1/2 cup of butter it's not needed. I used 1/4 cup like other reviews suggest and I don't think it made a difference to half it. Fantastic meal the meat just fell of the bone. Super easy. I'm letting my family members know about this one.

This recipe was good; we had all the ingredients on hand which is nice.  I used Heart Smart Butter and it worked well.  I would still make the recipe even if you don't have the curry, I don't think it really adds that much taste.  I made with chicken tenders and paired it with rice and a salad.  The honey mustard was good but not great; the honey mustard on this site's Aussie Chicken recipe is the best honey mustard.

I scaled back the butter like the other reviewers, but also threw in a tsp of cayenne pepper and 2 tbsp of sweet onion mustard. I roasted at 350 for 1 hour, had it covered for only 30 minutes of that, then at 400 for 30 min and 425 for 10 min, to get it crispy. I basted it every 30 minutes and poured a little of the uncooked, thick honey mix over the chicken right before serving. It was yummy!

Yum yum yum! I loved this recipie! I did not use a whole chicken, just three chicken breasts, and it turned out fine. The suace did not bake completely onto the chicken, however.  The excess sauce was delicious over rice.

I just have to add this note to this wonderful recipe!  I modify this when I need a quick meal & won't be home.  I put the chicken breasts in the crockpot to cook all day.  In the am before leaving, I make rice & the sauce.  The sauce can be made entirely in the microwave & then just poured over the meat later.  Quick, easy & delicious!

Awesome.  My toddler, who NEVER eats chicken, devoured this.  My husband did, too!  One of the top Allrecipes I've tried, and it was so easy!

We followed the suggestions by Brown Sugar Girl.  (Reduced the butter by half, added garlic salt and increased curry powder.)

We had five of my kids friends over and I was a bit concerned as to how they would enjoy this due to the fact that one of the kiddos was the pickiest of chicken connoisseurs.  She loved it and asked me to give her mom the recipe.
I adapted according to a lot of the substitutions the other reviews recommended.  Such as, garlic salt and dijon mustard.  I also double the recipe and only used 1 1/2 t of curry.  Will make again.  GREAT RECIPE!

The chicken came out fantastic.  I followed the recipe in its entirety.  I basted every 15 mins as the recipe says and the skin was nice and crisp and the chicken was tender and juicy. (was done in 1 hour and 10 minutes).  This was quite easy and will feed a lot of people.

I'm giving this recipe a 5, to be fair because i did combine this recipe with another on this website (Honey Baked Chicken I). I made mine with a roaster, rubbed it with garlic, salt, and pepper, and then basted with the honey mixture. I did not use curry powder, but the mustard added a delicious kick to the honey. I basted mine every 15-20 minutes and it turned out perfectly. The next day i used the left-over chicken to make sandwiches - delicious!!!

I am rating this one for my mom.  I have not tried making it yet, although I did get to eat a little of my mom's; it was awesome.  I read a review by "Erin" (which is also my name, incidentally) on how curry and cumin are thought to prevent Alzheimer's, as Indian people almost never get it.  I emailed this recipe to my mom, whose mother had recentally passed (and had Alzheimer's), and suggested she try it.  I didn't really think she was going to...I also thought she would scoff at the cumin and curry being able to prevent Alzheimer's.  Instead, she said she had indeed heard that before, and she ended up making a bunch of this chicken, and inviting friends over for dinner.  My mom said that my father made fun of her for making so much chicken but that she ended up only having a tiny bit left over, for me; everyone loved it and it was a huge hit.  My mom still raves about this one, and her friends told her to thank me for recommending it.  I know that she mentioned reading reviews beforehand and making adjustments based on others suggestions...for instance, I know she just used boneless, skinless, chicken breasts.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm looking forward to making it myself!

I made this using slightly less butter, but the other ingredients to a tee. I also used a whole chicken that I cut into pieces. I had full intentions of cooking it the same day I had prepared the ingredients, but alas, that did not happen. So I put the chicken in the pan, poured the stuff over everything, covered it and let it marinade for almost 24 hours. It was a nice change from the normal chicken, and the leftovers made GREAT tacos and quesidilas [spelling]. The only thing I disliked is the butter aspect. I still feel it was too much even though I reduced it, so I'll have to try it again and see how it works.

I used chicken drumsticks since that is what I had available. I used the recipe exactly as stated otherwise. There was more than enough sauce to cover the 8 drumsticks that I had. I put them in a baking dish and the sauce seemed to get pretty runny. They didn't have to cook as long (about 45 min at 350) The flavor didn't get into the chicken as much as I'd like. I may try it again and marinate it for awhile first. But no one complained...all were gone!! Thanks...

I use this recipe as a marinade for grilled chicken. It is a fairly quick marinade and the honey caramalizes and gives the edges of the chicken a little crunch. It's definitely become a household favorite! For anyone who likes it baked, I recommend you try it on the grill.

Great, easy recipe. I make this often using boneless skinless chicken breasts. Add more curry if you like! Cutting the butter in half works fine. Make wild/brown rice as a side so you can pour extra sauce on it - yum!

I might be in the minority here, but we thought this was pretty bad. I was hopeful in the beginning, but the taste really wasn't good and was lacking any real flavor other than sweetness. We threw out the leftovers.

I used half a stick of butter, doubled the mustard (3 varieties) and had no honey, so used real maple syrup instead (probably used double the amount called for but I wanted lots of sauce). My husband loved it and the kids ate all theirs! Forgot the salt but it was great. Probably will use syrup from now on since honey is more expensive where we live.
I served it with sweet potatoes, carrots, and zucchini pan-fried. Saved the extra sauce and used it on sticky rice for lunch.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and found it to be a very bland way to prepare chicken. (I always like to prepare the recipes as written the first time, then make adjustments as needed thereafter) We like spicy, thick flavors and this just do it for us. Had lots of leftovers.  Will not make again.

I followed the advice of the other reviews and kept the chicken covered until the final 20 minutes. This dish is very good and very easy to make.

This is a wonderful recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp of garlic and chopped onions. I also upped the curry powder to 2 tsp. I melted a boullioun cube with half the butter and covered it with foil until the last 20 minutes. You do need to baste this chicken.

The chicken was delicious. My family really loved it. I'll be making this again.

Tip: If you make the sauce as it is, it makes a wonderful dip for fried chicken nuggets and fingers. Just tweak the mustard and honey to your taste.

Very good and easy.  I would try it without the skin next time but that is just a personal preferance.  The flavor was still good taking the skin off after baking.

This is just what I needed to get out of the same old chicken rut we've been in around here.  I used boneless skinless, cranked the oven to 400, baked covered for 30 min, uncovered for 15.  I cut the butter and honey in half, and doubled the curry.

Delicious and easy.  As another reviewer suggested, I also poked holes in the chicken with a fork to absorb more of the sauce and marinated it for several hours.  Instead of using plain salt, I used Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  I also used chicken breast and made enough so I had leftover cold chicken to slice thin and add to a toss salad.  Really nice recipe.. Thanks!

Reduced the butter to at least half the stated amount.  Delicious even when I only had french's mustard on hand, made 2nd time with grey poupon, even better, forwarded to a few friends and they all rave about it too.  Make the meal healthy by serving with brown rice and a green vegetable.

This is literally my daughter's favorite recipe. I snatch up chicken legs when they go on sale and make this almost every week, but she probably wouldn't mind if I served it to her every night! The sauce is just wonderful over rice, and the recipe is extremely quick and easy to prepare.

Great on the grill, too! I was pressed for time, so I used the sauce in place of barbecue sauce on grilled chicken breasts. I divided it and used half to baste the chicken as it cooked, and poured the other half over the chicken for serving. It was delicious. I used Dijon mustard and added a tablespoon of whole mustard seeds to the sauce as well. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks.

I made this with a whole chicken and placed an onion in the body cavity and it was so easy and very, very delicious and even quite healthy. I served it with stuffing, a very good combination. This will stay on my favorites list for sure!

Excellent Excellent Excellent.  I modified it a bit, I used boneless skinless chicken breast and only used 1/8 of mustard.  Yum Yum Yum. My husband and 19 month old son LOVED this.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that was all I had.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and halved the amount of butter.  To me (and my family), the amounts of mustard and curry powder were just right!  I'm keeping this recipe, for sure!

This recipe was excellent. Very easy and very flavorful.  I did like some others suggested. I cut the margarine in half and added 1 tsp of minced garlic. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing such a good recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and liked the taste. It was a very subtle sweetness, with not much spice. 
When I make this again I'll probably use a bit more curry powder (an extra tsp.) and maybe a spicy mustard for a little zing. 
The recipe itself? Worth trying. Yummy chicken! :)

I love this recipe- very easy and wheat/gluten free.  Great with tortilla chips.  I only used one can of corn, because that's what I had- and it came out so good the first time, that I continue to make it with just one.

Excellent! AS this was a last minute choice for me and I had no curry I used "Durn Good" spice for some heat and added that to 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown mustard and the 1/2 cup honey and garnished with some green onion when I served it.  It was a hit!

This was fabulous.  I took the suggestion and made the garlic asparagus with it.  One thing I did do was leave out the butter.  It came out just fine!

This was very good and extremely easy.  A definite tasty meal in a pinch.  I think that grilled chicken parts, as the recipe suggests, would really make this stand out.  We used cutlets but will be doing it again shortly.  Added chili powder as others suggested also.

WOW!  Super yummy!  Doubled the sauce, used boneless chix thighs (BTW- these cook much faster).  Sauce over some jasmine rice was divine.   Jasmine rice- use coconut milk, and juice from small can of crushed pineapple, instead of water- and add pineapple to rice after cooked.  DH loved it!

I didn't have the amount of time available that it called for in the recipe, so I cooked it in a grill pan on the stovetop and it was done in less than half an hour! I have always loved honey mustard chicken, but this recipe turned out more moist than any other I have tried. Highly recommend!

I think if this had been marinated overnight it would have been even better. The smell while it was cooking was good but the flavor wasn't anything spectacular. I would make it again, though! **EDIT** I marinated boneless, skinless chicken for about 5 hours with the mustard, honey, 2 t curry powder, 1/4 t red pepper, and 1/2 t garlic salt. I cooked it for 30 minutes covered in foil and 20 minutes uncovered - turned out GREAT!

Fabulous dish. I made a few minor adjustments due to lack of/other ingredients on hand. I left out the curry, instead opting for a sweet/spicy bbq rub spice I had in the pantry; added some fresh parsley on top before baking; baked at 350 for 45mins and 200-250 for 2 more hours (the chicken was so amazingly tender). Since I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I cut them into about 5 chunck (looked almost like little pork cutlets). Again, amazing.

This is a great base recipe; it turned out very good, but I did make several alterations based on reviewer suggestions. I used split rib bone-in chicken breasts with the skin, and I cut the butter to 1/4 c., although I think I may leave it out altogether next time because you really don't need it with the fat of the meat. I upped the curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp. but I think I will add more next time, and I also added a little minced garlic and 1/4 tsp. chili powder, but will probably up that too next time to give it more of a kick. I cooked it for 1 hour covered with foil at 350, turning once, then turned again and cooked uncovered at 400 for 20 minutes longer, basting a few times. This will definitely go into our regular meal rotation because it's a great way to use other less expensive chicken parts outside of the boneless, skinless breasts I normally buy, and it is so easy and delicious! I served with rice too and used the remaining sauce.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!!  I only gave it 4 stars because it was a tad bit too sweet for me.  I cut back on the butter and only used 1/4 cup.  Next time I'll also cut back on honey.  I used spicy brown mustard and added a pinch of cayenne per others' suggestions. I used about 3 whole boneless skinless chicken breats. My oven was giving off fumes so at the last minute I decided to cook it on the stove.  I seared each side for 2 minutes, then poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked on low for 20 minutes.  The breasts were tender and juicy.  The ingrediants made a great flavor.

This is a really good recipe! My kids practically inhaled it! I cut the butter and honey by half; it was plenty sweet that way. Since I was short on time I cooked it on the stove, simmering the chicken in the glaze. This cut the cooking time to 15-20 minutes. This recipe will be make again and again! Thanks!

This was wonderful.  The chicken was so moist and tender.  I think I will add more spices to it next time.  I did let it marinate in the fridge for about 5 hrs before cooking.  It was very simple and a good base recipe for many flavors.

I love it....and most important my husband loves it!! I use boneless skinless chicken breast and I do marinate it about 1/2 before in a zip lock bag in the fridge. I also cover it with foil for the first 30 mins then 20 mins uncovered. and I use dijon mustard and more curry. It's easy and wonderful!!!

This is super easy and delicious. Everyone loved it, including my pickiest eater. Another reviewer commented on the way her house smelled so good while cooking it and I agree. By the time the chicken was ready, my entire family was in the kitchen and circling the stove. I served it with white rice and corn.

I combined a few other suggestions and used olive oil rather than butter and used this to make a chicken stirfry (oh, and used garlic salt).  It was great!! I just eyeballed the amounts, but it came out so good.
We licked the plates clean!

I hate mustard, BUT this tasted really great.  I was apprehensive about trying it but I would definitely use this recipe again.  I followed the recipe exact but used chicken cutlets.

This was truly a great recipe for chicken. However, next time I will cut down on the amount of honey, just a tad too sweet for us. But we all (the kids too!) snarfed it up!! Made the house smell great. :) I will make this again for sure.

This was a big hit at my house. Read all the reviews and followed the tips. Marinating was great, as well as cutting the butter in half.  Chicken makes grease so why cook it in so much butter? I used chicken thighs and cooked with foil the first half then basted as suggested. The sauce was wonderful on rice and although I made two packs of thighs so we could have leftovers for lunch the following day, nothing was left! Excellent recipe.

I made this with chicken leg quarters for my husband and his friend and chicken breast tenderloins for me. It was really easy and delicious. My husband and his friend both really enjoyed it, especially with the extra sauce to dip with.

I marinated chicken breasts in half the mixture for an hour or so, and then baked it covered with foil, basting every 20 minutes or so.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  Great blend of diverse flavors.

T turned this into a stir fly.  just threw all ingredients into a flying pan (a little less butter) and stir-fried it up.  I served it over wht rice and it was great.

Based on other reviews, I seasoned the chicken first with salt, garlic powder, and a little paprika.  My family enjoyed the chicken and I will make this again however, we thought they were a little overly sweet and I will cut back on the honey next time.

This is my new 'default' recipe. I use it all the time, because it's so easy, and yummy. I use 1/8 cup olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier, and it's still yummy. A definite classic in my kitchen!

This is one of my husband's favorites. I changed it up a little bit and used about 10 drumsticks instead. I cover and bake the drumsticks for 30 minutes. Then I pour the mixture over the chicken and bake it uncovered for another 50-60 minutes. Great recipe!!!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic, I make it regularly.  Two things I do different: one is I remove the skin from the chicken, the other is I cut the amount of butter in half.  I also usually season the chicken beforehand.  This chicken always comes out so flavorful & tender, and the sauce is awesome, delicious over rice!

Excellent chicken. I too, cut the butter in half and upped the spices. I used boneless/skinless thighs and breast tenders and laid them over a bed of sliced onions before saucing them. Served with rice and vegies.

Rates a 4.5 - very good, easy and you probably have all the ingredients in your kitchen.  **Would've been way too sweet for us with that much honey,** so I cut the honey down by half. And, as others have pointed out, you only need half the butter that the recipe calls for.  I used regular French's mustard - same amount as in the recipe; 1.5 tsp of curry instead of 1 and added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne, 1/2 c. diced yellow onion and 3 large cloves of diced garlic.  There was plenty of leftover sauce.  I cooked 4 large boneless, skinless, half-breasts. Thanks for the helpful comments and to the originator for the great recipe!

Tasted great.  I ran out of honey so I didn't use as much as the recipe stated.  I also didn't have curry powder.  Though, this tasted great and my husband thought it was delicous also.

If you love curry, you’ll love this dish!  I cut the butter in half as recommended and instead of regular mustard, used dijon. I cut up a whole chicken, but next time I’ll just use chicken breasts since I don’t care for the skin. I put all of the sauce and the chicken in a dish, covered the pan with foil, and baked for 30 minutes. Then uncovered, rebasted, and cooked it for another 10 minutes. I served this over couscous.

Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing with us.  Like many others, I also added garlic and onion but then I reduced the curry powder.  Next I added a bit of Asian Fine Chili Sauce which was a good counterpoint to the sweetness of the honey

I wasn't sure about this one at first. I'm not bug on honey & my boyfriend doesn't like mustard but all together the flavors were good. I did as suggested & cut the butter in half & doubled the curry. Next time I'm going to try adding cayenne for some more spice.

My mouth was watering as I read the reviews to this recipe, but I was somewhat disappointed. I didn't see how I was going to get that crispy golden crust everyone talked about with all those juices in the pain, I changed pan 3 times to get rid of some of the juice. I ended up pouring all the juice out and baking it about 2 hours and making more sauce and turned the oven up to 400 as someone suggested, just so I could get that golden look.  Honestly I liked the flavor, it just didn't work out like I thought. It was good though, just a lot of extra steps.  I love to cook and love trying new things.  I would cook it again just a little different next time. I don't know what I didn wrong, if anything.

Amazing!!! I modified the recipe a bit, I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne, and upped the curry powder to 2 tsp.'s, and like most others recommended, I also cut down the butter. I served this over white rice with the leftover sauce. I will make this one again for sure.

Wow! This recipe was a total hit at hoe, I just added an extra teaspoon of curry, two garic coves, and I only used 1/4 cup of margerine instead of butter because I keep kosher. Excellent!

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes. The first time that I made it, I didn't have honey, so I substituted brown sugar. It was soooo good that I haven't actually made it with honey yet, afraid that it wont be as good.

I used chicken thighs I had at hand. Boy, was it good! A little too much butter, but it's a matter of taste and can easily be remedied next time. Definitely going on our favorite recipes list!!!

This is very good and very easy.  Next time I may try marinating it for a few hours in the honey mixture to give it a more through flavor.  Thank you for this easy meal.

Yummy flavor and very easy.  I did it with a pound of breasts (2 breasts) and I halfed the recipe.  Also, I only had to cook it about 25 minutes at 450C.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I used dijon mustard b/c that's all I had on hand, and it turned out wonderful!  My oven runs hot and I just used chicken legs, so I baked them for 1 hour.  The meat was so tender I had to gingerly remove the legs from the baking dish with my tongs.  The meat was literally falling off the bone : )  Such an easy recipe with such wonderful results.  Yum!!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it came out perfect!  I also omitted the salt and curry powder.  Cooking time was only 45 minutes.

Thanks for the delicious recipe!  Will definitely make again!

I have been using this recipe for years. I use dijon mustard and omit the salt.
I use it most often with corned beef. After simmering the beef with the vegetables, I put the meat under the broiler with this sauce for a few minutes on each side - fantastic. The kids often request it!

loved this. i had boneless chicken breasts so used them and baked it for less time. can't wait to try it with skin chicken.
i used real butter and it had the nicest buttery flavor. now for changes...next time i'll cut the honey a little and up the curry a little. just my personal taste.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe called and it was wonderful.  The chicken was brown and tender and my family absolutely loved it.

It was easy to make and the kids already asked when we could have it again.

Great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe. I added some season all, garlic powder and black pepper to enhance the flavor.  I also would cut the butter in half. The honey and mustard made the chicken so moist and tender.  Thanks for an easy and great recipe!

I just made this for the first time tonight for guests and 4 out of 6 asked for seconds :) I would give it 5 stars since I thought it was terrific, but I don't think it's right to give 5 stars to a recipe you feel you need to modify vs. "as is"  Modifications I made:  Boneless skinless thighs, 1/2 tsp more of curry, and I used 1/4C of butter, and it still seemed to be too much. Perhaps that is because I used thighs, but they were skinless.  I will defininately make again, but with less butter.

The flavor of this sauce and chicken is outstanding. My family and I couldn't put it down. This is that kind of food where after you sit back and say, "Oh, I'm so full I couldn't eat another bite." You soon find yourself picking at it some more. It is definately a keeper exactly as the recipe is written.

Great. Sweet. I added potatoes to the pan because I had extra space. They were very good.

2nd time: used red clover blossom syrup instead of honey and halved the butter. it was great!

The recipe was incredibly delicious! I made it using chicken legs.  The only thing I did different was I decreased the amount of butter, using 1/4 cup and cooked it for 35 min. (at 350 degrees) with tin foil over the baking dish, then upped the temperature to 400 degrees, took the cover off and cooked it for 40 min., making it a total of the 75 min.  I basted it 3 times during the time the cover was off.  I'm not a huge curry fan, but this amount was perfect!  The mixture stuck nicely on the chicken and had a nice deep dark texture.  I will be making this again, that's for sure.  I would love to try it using buffalo wings too. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a very easy and effortless recipe.  I took others' suggestions to add extra Curry (I doubled the amount), then I dredged skinless chicken breasts seasoned bread crumbs, and used Dijon mustard.  I have hard to please mouths to feed, and this one was a big hit.

I've been making this recipe for years when I do banquet type dinners.  People always ask for the recipe.  I use thighs and legs because they keep moist and you can reheat or cook on low to keep warm. I always use dijon mustard instead of regular. This is the best recipe I've found in years!!

mmm, delish!  Used skinless chicken thighs, cooked uncovered at 400 for 1 hour (like it well done).  Used my deep roasting pan and didn't have any trouble with smoking/burning.  You could even place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan so it isn't sitting in all the grease.  If you like curry I would add an extra tsp because I couldn't really taste the curry all that much.  This was super easy and very low maintenance 'set and forget it' as they say :D

Easy and tasty! I used a 6 pound chicken so I doubled the sauce part.  My family gobbled this right up.  The only change I made was to add 4 minced garlic cloves.  There was just a hint of the curry so next time I will add more.  Thanks!

Very good.  I used chicken breasts only because I don't usually cook chicken with skin.  I thought is turned out great and the sauce was tasted great.  I left the amount of curry the same because I didn't want it to over power the honey mustard flavor.

Great recipe.  Waited for drippings to cool, then drained fat off & discarded.  Used drippings on rice.  Cut butter in half per other readers suggestions too.   So easy.  Didn't even marinade & still turned out great.

I have always used honey and butter when baking a whole chicken, but the addition of curry and musturd gives it a nice change!  My daughter loved it!

This was a very tasty dish. I used chicken tenderloins instead of a whole chicken and followed the suggestion to only use 1/4 cup butter. I also cooked it on 400 for 40 min. like another user suggested. My husband thought it was a little too sweet but everyone else really liked it.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they made the sauce very thin.  After baking, I strained the sauce, added cornstarch mixed with water, and microwaved it until thickened.  I also added garlic powder and black pepper to the sauce.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Simple, fast and fabulous!  The only change I made was to use 1/4 c butter instead of 1/2 c, which I found to be a bit too much.  I make this recipe at least once or twice a month!

This dish works great with any combo of chicken pieces.  I haven't ever made it with a whole chicken - instead I've used boneless thighs, boneless breasts, and tenderloins.  It turns out great every time.

It smelled great. I would make it again. My husband liked it. Next time I would drain off the fat and then add the sauce. It was so oily. I couldn't use the sause for anything.

I used skinless, boneless breasts and only 1/4 c. butter.  It turned out wonderful.  Served over jasmine rice with steamed veggies on the side.  The flavorful chicken is enough that you don't need overpowering sides.  This is a definite keeper for the great taste, not labor-intensive preparation, and it's pretty to boot!

The flavors didn't infuse into the chicken very well at all. I would recommend that you marinate the pieces first prior to baking.

I thought this dish was FABULOUS, but my husband said it was too sweet and was rather indifferent to it (reason for 4 stars).  My kids ate it no problems.  I did change the recipe due to lack of ingredients...I used 3 chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces and put in 2 qt. casserole dish for 35 min at 375*...probably longer than needed.  I added 1T. of curry and just sprinkled a little bit of ground pepper on it.  Served with steamed veggies, rice and peaches.  Delicious...but watch out, the sauce will stain your white oven!

I used skinless chicken breast for this recipe and at first I thought that the flavor was not going to stick to the chicken. To my surprise, it did. I cooked it for 75 minutes.  For the first half, it was covered with aluminum foil.  For the second half, it was uncovered.

This chicken was absolutely delicious!  I prepared it just as the recipe says, but served it with white rice that I flavored with about 2 tsp. of curry powder.  I drizzled some of the leftover sauce from the chicken over the rice.  It was really, really good!! Can't wait to make it again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe as is, and just loved it.  I was worried that the curry would be too overpowering, since the aroma filled my entire house, but it was perfect!  Picky husband loved it.

This is terrific and easy.  I made this before I read the reviews and I am really glad I did, because this recipe is great the way it is.  The reason you should baste instead of turning is because the skin becomes really crisp and wonderful.  The curry is extremely important and so don't exclude or substitute! It balances.  I think it probably would be okay to reduce the butter or substitute a bit of olive oil for some of the butter.  Great, and this will become a staple in my recipe box.

This was so good.  I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs and cooked for an hour.  I didn't have to do any basting because the sauce covered the chicken, but half way through i did flip them once.  This goes perfect with white rice and steamed veggies.

This is a wonderful and simple chicken dish.  I've been fixing it for several years now and usually get tons of compliments!  It works equally well with cut up chicken pieces, as it does with boneless breasts or thighs.  I prefer to remove the skin from my chicken before baking, just because it's fattier than I'd like if I don't.  If I'm using chicken pieces with the skin removed, I bake the pieces top-side down so that it doesn't dry out, again, just personal preference!  I generally serve this dish with white rice, steamed broccoli, salad and crescent rolls.  So yummy!

EXCELLENT!  Used 1/3 cup butter, stone ground mustard, add chili powder and 2 cloves garlic to existing recipe.  Reserved some for basting, the rest for marinating. Grilled instead of baking.  Fantastic, both the children and my husband LOVED it.

I made this tonight for the first time. I thought the overall taste was great but it wasnt spicy enough for me. I think cutting down on the butter is a good idea if you are using pieces with the bone and skin.  I really enjoyed it anyway but will experiment with it for my own personal preferences.  Thanks!

I used skinless chicken thighs. I took the skin off the thighs because I did not want lots of grease in the baking dish. 
The sauce it makes is wonderful on Jasmine rice. My husband loved it and I will be making it again. 
I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of curry to it. Next time I think I will add another full tsp instead.

Soooo flavorful! I used it on a whole roasting chicken. The juice it made in the bottom of the pan was absolutely great. The chicken took alomost 1.5 hrs to cook though!! Next time, I will cut it up like the recipe suggests. Thanks for a good one.

This was the best and easiest chicken I have ever made.  I used only chicken tenders and they were a hit with friends and family.  The name "Honey Chicken" does not do it justice; it makes one think that it has just a sweet flavor.  I have decided to call it "Oh, My Gosh Chicken"  because it is Oh, my gosh simple to make and Oh, my gosh yummy!

It was yummy, yet I felt bad seeing the amount of butter used on the sauce.

I added one teaspoon of minced garlic, a half teaspoon of chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of cumin for more curry flavour.

If I make it again next time, I would use the half of the butter.

I hate to have a bad review, but I found this boring and very bland, I didn't care for the curry in this dish, I think it have been better without. I ended up slicing the chicken and placing it over a salad so it wouldn't be waisted..  I had to make a whole new main course....

I am not a fan of curry but thought I would give this a try.  I loved it.  I only added a rounded 1/2 tsp of curry but next time I will add more.  I also made  a pocket between the skin and meat then filled it with the sauce by turkey baster.  Turned out great.  A surprise keeper.

This was very tasty and enjoyed by all.  I served it over some yummy jasmine rice.  No one ingredient is overpowering, they blend so well together!  The curry is nice and subtle and smelled great in the oven.  I also used frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts in order to scale down the high fat content and they were very juicy and tender at 350 for 1 hour.  We will definitely have this for dinner often!

Delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I think they needed a little less cook time since they were boneless.  Family loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

I've made this twice now, and it turned out great both times.  I followed advice and halved the butter, also baked at 400 for 1 hour.  The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce per family request.  It goes great with rice.  My favorite part is how easy it is and almost no mess in the kitchen!

I love this recipe!  I use boneless breasts or thighs and cut the cooking time to about 40 minutes.  Don't be afraid to use the curry, it gives it a great flavour...even my picky 5 yr old loves this recipe.  My husband requested it once a week.  I also cut the butter down to about 2 tbsp for a healthier dinner.

Another hit for chicken!  This was awesome, my entire family of 5 loved it and that's saying a lot since the ages range from 6 to 16 for kids anyway and it usually takes a superb dish to make them all happy at once.  I always double the sauce on any recipe because my family loves things very "saucy" and it was delicious, I also used bone in skin on chicken breasts.  Thanks Gretchen

I was disappointed by this recipe. It seemed to be lacking something, and didn't quite turn out as I hoped. I did was most people did -- baked at 400 degrees but that seemed to burn the honey and it carmelized too quickly. And 75 minutes seemed awfully long in my oven, it seemed to be done in about 60 minutes. I wouldn't try this recipe again, or recommend it. Sorry! The taste was too overwhelming and not well liked. A very Ho Hum recipe.

I am a very picky eater and this was great!  At first I thought I had just wasted money and my time but it turned out soooo good that I called my friends and my mother and told them about it!  Thanks!

i found almost the exact same recipe on www.southernfood.about.com. it calls for 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 pineapple juice. i thought it tasted wonderful! even my husband and my 20 month old son liked it. and as others have suggested, i wouldn't use more than 1/4 cup of butter - it would have been way too greasy! maybe next time i will add some more curry powder. i never used that spice before so i was nervous. i thought it was going to be a strong flavor. the chicken was so moist! i made sure i basted every 15-20 minutes, i also turned it half way through the cooking time. thanks for such an easy and flavorful recipe!

So tasty! Instead of a whole chicken, I used 3 chicken breasts and cut the sauce recipe in half. I cut them into pieces and poured the sauce over the chicken in a 7x11 dish, and baked it for about 45 minutes. I served it with mashed potatoes, and it was all very good.

This was the goods!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was yummy!  I really reminded me of the honey mustard chicken my 4 year old adores at the "Cajun Grill" in the mall.  I actually will double the curry powder next time as the curry taste was delicious.  Easy, quick and yummy.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was very good.  I like mustard and it has a strong mustard taste to it.  Not recommended for those of you who do not like mustard.  Will do this again.

This recipe is exceptionally easy and produces really delicious chicken.  If you cook it at 400 F, the sauce carmelizes and the chicken is really tender. The dish will make you wonder why you ever go to a restaurant. It is only passable when cooked at 350 F, so don't. There is just enough curry to give it an interesting flavor.

This is now in my "top 10" list for weekday meals.  My kids, 7 and 11, normally picky, loved it and said it was the best chicken I'd ever made!  I thought it was delicious and easy to prepare with no unusual ingredients.  I made it exactly by the recipe, and wouldn't change a thing.

We thought this was pretty good! I only used 1/2 tsp of curry and 6 whole (skinless) chicken breasts instead.  I also added some minced garlic and some dry onion flakes to the mustard/honey/butter mix - which (I felt) enhanced the chicken.  Didn't baste but like others, flipped the chicken every 15 minutes until done. Served with wild rice pilaf and steamed veggies and it was a well-recieved meal! Thanks Gretchen!

I ran out of curry powder, so used a few sprinkles of garlic powder instead.  Very good!  Looking forward to trying again with the curry powder, and maybe omitting the skin.

My husband thought this was good but I thought it was really good. I was skeptical but was pleasantly suprised at how well the flavors blended. I did follow the recipe exactly except I used boneless chicken breast and marinated the chicken in the sauce for several hours. I basted frequently and cooked for about 25 minutes (my chicken breast were pretty thick). It was melt in your mouth tender and had a wonderful flavor. Will definitely make this often. Thanks for giving me a different chicken recipe!

This was average.  Some complained it was sweet and others that it was too "mustardy",  I thought it balanced each other nicely though.  Anyhow, I substituted chicken broth for the butter since I felt it was unnecessary and to cut back on fat and I added cubed potatoes and carrots to the casserole while it was baking (which was covered).  I wouldn't make this again though.

My mother made this dish for me when I was young, and now I make it for my lover, and we both devour it like it's heaven on a plate.  I get bored of recipes very quickly, but this one has been a tried and true favorite since I first tasted it as a little boy.  My mother always made it with white (Uncle Ben's) rice with plenty of butter and salt, and I do to... but I ALSO pour the left over drippings on the rice. Someone else mentioned this gravy thing too.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who can't resist drowning my rice in that fatty-sweet goodness.

Everyone loved it!  The house smelled soo 
good while the chicken was in the oven.
I used 7 pieces of chicken breasts and
had to double the mixture.  One thing, I
would use only half of the suggested butter
the recipe calls for.  Way too much butter!

I've made this several times and shared it with friends.  I made it as written a few times, then made a couple adjustments.  We prefer it with chicken thighs w/o the skin.  I cut the butter to 1/4 c. and tried using honey mustard once just to see and wow, that was the keeper.  I do recommend making it as written once just to try it and then if you want to change it, go for it.

The sauce was delicious,
the meat was falling off the bone,
my only problem was that it took
two days to clear out the smell of
curry after I spilled a little of
the sauce on the floor.

Really good recipe! The chicken was very juicy. Unfortunately, I didn't have any curry (I don't know how this happened - I'm sure it was in my spice rack). The honey, mustard and butter was still a good combination. I'm eager to try it again with the curry.

Followed recommendations and used 1/2 the butter., 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1.5 tsp garam masala, and zest some fresh ginger.  Otherwise the same.

A winner!!  I used a whole, 4-lb. cut-up Kosher chicken, and the full amount of butter (may use less next time :)).  Instead of the full amounts of honey and mustard, I used lesser amounts of Trader Joe's "Honey Pale Ale Mustard" and Trader Joe's Raw Organic Honey.  I DID cover the chicken for the first 30 mins., (as others had recommended); then uncovered and basted every 15 mins. for the remainder of time.  Even tho' the inside temp. of the chicken was around 185ºF when done,  the chicken was moist & juicy (even the breast!)  It was DELICIOUS, and the sauce was great over rice!

Made this with minor changes: only 2T of butter and bumped the curry powder up to 2t. Started skin side down @ 375, covered the dish in foil. Removed the foil after 30min and turned the thighs skin up, basting every 10min for 30 more minutes.

Removed the chicken to a dish and transferred the sauce to a saucepan, skimming the fat. Punched up the sauce with honey and mustard, thickened with cornstarch slurry, making a nice gravy. Served with whole roast garlic cloves on the side.

This is really delicious. I used half the amount of butter like some suggested and even that was a bit too much, I might omit it completely next time tbh. Just to see what would happen.
That said, I do plan to make it again, I’ll leave it to marinade too.

I have made this several times, and agree that 1/4 cup butter is plenty. Just one note: I am a salt lover, but some curry powders have a lot of salt already! I mix it all together without any salt first, and then taste it.  One of the Madras Curry powders I have needs no salt added, but  I need to use 2 tsp. of the powder for flavor. I usually use skinless boneless cutlets,  and cover it for 30 minutes, and uncover for 20.  thicken up the sauce a bit and put it over rice. I usually serve it with a green vegetable.

This was delicious! I didn’t have any curry on hand so I used ground cumin. Also made with chicken breasts and covered with foil for the first 40 minutes. I also reduced butter and added garlic powder, crushed red pepper and kickin’ Chicken seasoning. I cut the chicken into bite--sized pieces and gave a good stir every 10 mts. After removing foil. Will make again—served with seasoned angel hair pasta and steamed vegetables.

This is an awesome recipe! I used boneless chicken breasts and thighs. As suggested by other reviews, I decreased butter to 1/4 C,  & increased curry. I also used only 1/4 C honey since I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake.  So it was equal amounts of butter, honey and mustard. A huge hit! A keeper!

Excellent dish!  I added a few of the ideas in the comments but also used boneless & skinless chicken breasts. Poked holes as suggested but didn't marinate long.  Added extra teaspoon of curry powder,  1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  Cooked in Pyrex baking dish with a lid for 30 minutes,  then removed lid and cooked an additional 30 minutes.  I'd added about 1/8 cup of water to the spices so the chicken was covered and basting wasn't necessary. Chicken was delightful and tender. Definitely a repeat recipe.

This was really good. I made it exactly to recipe (which I don't usually do). Make sure you spoon the glaze over the chicken every 15 minutes like instructed. It makes a big difference.

I took this recipe to another level.  I used a rotisserie chicken. A nice big juicy one from a popular warehouse store.  I broke it down into eight pieces. I made the sauce with the only changes being decreased butter and adding a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I used a 9x 13 pan lined with foil.  The preheated oven was at 350.  I covered the pan with foil and cooked 30 min.  I increased the temp to 400, removed the foil and cooked another 30 min. basting twice.
The chicken skin caramelized and the sauce thickened.
Great recipe, good flavor and so easy.

Very tasty and visually pleasing.  I did cover it with foil for the first 30 minutes.  The chicken came out juicy and "fall of the bone" tender.

The only changes I made were using 1/4 C butter instead of 1/2 C and I omitted the salt. We will be making this again! Very simple. If you baste it every 15 min per the instructions, there is no need to cover it with tin foil. My house also smells amazing now! I didn't get a chance to take a picture, we ate it all up---looked just like the main recipe though!

Really easy to make and delicious. I did not use curry seasoning because I don't like the flavor.  I used 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of honey, and 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard as other reviewers suggested.  I also laid the chicken on top of sliced yellow onions.  I basted the chicken every fifteen minutes. I started the chicken skin side down and covered. After the first fifteen minutes, I turned the chicken over and then basted every fifteen minutes. I also sliced a russet potato and laid the thick slices on the baking sheet. I continued basting the chicken and potatoes every fifteen minutes.  The result is an absolutely delicious one-pan meal. Keep an eye on it towards the end of cooking time because the honey starts to carmelize and could burn.  My chicken was a little over done and looked a little like barbecue but it was honesty yummy. I would serve this to company in a minute, especially because it's inexpressive and SO EASY to prépare.   Yummy, yummy, yummy! Next time I'll make a bigger tray so that I have plenty of leftovers.

This is pretty good. I followed the reviews and cut he butter in half. I also covered with tin foil for 30 mins and then the remaining I uncovered and would baste every little while after. Very tender and juicy.

My husband liked it. I thought it was like chicken put in watery barbecue sauce. If I were to make it again, I’d get rid of the butter altogether and increase the spice level. I’d also marinate the chicken in advance.

I do think the sauce would be good for carrots.

Really great recipe! I didn’t have enough mustard so I added what I had left and used a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar to make up for it- and it tasted fantastic. I used boneless chicken thighs and I cooked for an hour  basting every 15 minutes. I sprinkled rosemary on top after 30 minutes. My kids loved it. I served it with white rice- sour cream and onion red potatoes in the steam bag and broccoli, everyone really loved it and we used the gravy on our rice. Thanks for the good meal to add to my rotation

It wasn't terrible, but I probably won't make again. Finished my meal and still couldn't decide if I liked it. The flavors were just an odd combo for me.

First time fixing this recipe, will not be the last. I baked it at 325 in my convection oven, think next time may try 300. I went with the full recommended cooking time. The skin was more dark, internal temperature was 205, but the meat was just wonderful, falling off the bone. The dark skin had a nutty cashew flavor, but was a little chewy. I did season with salt and pepper before the first basting. 
Bottom line is this dish is wonderful!

I would give this four stars but my boyfriend loved it and practically licked his plate clean. Next time I make it, I’m going to use boneless chicken thighs and I will probably like it more. The flavor was good and it was really easy to make...a little on the greasy side with all the butter. I halved it and still thought it was a little much. Overall, good and I will definitely make again.

I  prepared the recipe exactly as written. I was really excited to try this recipe. It was easy to prepare, the chicken looked fantastic, was moist and juicy. Unfortunately, the flavor was just OK, very disappointing. 
I still give it 4 stars due to ease of preparation, sticky glaze and the moist, juicy chicken. I  just really wish this had more flavor.

The flavor was good, but  WHAT A MESS! I put parchment paper in the pan first - but the juices seem to find their way under and get burnt in the pan. Too much butter indeed. ( Like some others said)

For me the cooking time seemed too long.  My chicken thighs were hard as cardboard.  If I do this recipe again I would alter the amount of  butter ( as per other reviewers) and the cooking time.  It wasn't a hit at my party  but maybe next time.

I have made this several times and when I followed the recipe exactly, it was delicious. However, I have modified the recipe slightly by cutting the butter in 1/2 and adding a can of coconut milk.  It makes more gravy and it's not as fatty.

This was really good.  I read a bunch of reviews and changed it up a tiny bit.  First I used stone ground mustard, I only used 2 tbsp of margarine and I doubled the amount of curry powder amd salted and peppered the chicken before pouring the marinade on it.  This smelled amazing and looked and tasted even better.  I'm definitely adding this into my monthly rotation of recipes

I used a one pound chicken breast and cut it into thirds.  I only cooked half the recipe with only 1/4 teaspoon of curry. Tasted alright. I baked a half hour covered with foil and a half hour uncovered. Chicken was moist and a little brown. I'll make this again.

I have made this a couple of times. I use boneless skinless breasts, only because my family and I prefer those. I also add a teaspoon or two of chalula hot sauce and season the chicken with tony's Creole seasoning before adding the sauce. My family loves this recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe 100 stars!!! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Using chicken thighs bone in are better then boneless chicken breasts.... The bones and dark meat really enhances the flavor. I do like to make more of the sauce to dip the chicken in or have it on the rice. I will even save the sauce and use it on another meal. I've never been a huge curry fan but this recipe uses it so well that I'm so glad I tried it. Yummm yummm yummm... I don't change anything to it. It's amazing just how it is!! Give it a try!

I made two changes. I didn't have curry powder so I took out the mustard and used a curry paste that I did have. Also, I put this on chicken wings. My husband really liked it.

This turned out surprisingly delicious! As suggested in reviews, I used 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/4 tsp curry powder and rest as is. Also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I used 4 thigh-leg quarters. Baked at 350F covered for 30 mins, turned the chicken and continued baking uncovered for another 30 mins. Turned again and then increased temp to 400F and baked for another 20 mins. There were a lot of oil so I separated the chicken from the sauce. Drained excess oil. Added some cornstarch (dissolved in water) and boiled til sauce thickened. Then poured sauce on top. Served with rice. Awesome! I will definitely make again.

I make this recipe OFTEN. I make it EXACTLY as recipe states with a 14 pack of chicken drumsticks. My picky husband says it is his favorite way that I make chicken and all the kids eat it ( which is a miracle...) Do not forget to baste-- it's important!

Excellent! cut butter in half.  Upped curry. Added cayenne.  Put thin slices of onion in pan then put chicken on top.  Used skinless chicken thighs.  Basted every 15 minutes.  Took about 45 minutes.

I also reduced the butter and I let the chicken marinade overnight. I used bone-in and skin on chicken thighs. I was not wowed. I will make this again with legs or breasts instead and see if this is better. The glaze needs something.

I'm a newbie here and this is actually my first attempt to try a recipe from here. Just wow! I can say my husband loved me more! And I've tried the half butter and it works fine :)

The hubs and I both loved it. I wish it were crispier though. Changes I had made on this recipe as suggested by other members were 1/3 c of mustard and honey. 2Tbs of butter. 1/2 tsp curry and 1/2tsp of masala and 1/4tsp of paprika as well as a pinch of nutmeg. I added an onion chopped into quarters and mushrooms to this recipe.

 45-50mins in the oven for 2 big pieces of breast.  broiled for the first 8-10mins with the foil on and loosely covered the rest of the time. 

The sauce that I got in the end was enough for 1 cup of rice (or 2 people) but it was thick on the chicken, which reminded me of a yogurt chicken recipe like butter masala or rogan josh kind.

Thank you for this recipe!

I made the recipe as it and the only thing I was hesitant about was the curry powder.  The chicken tasted good and was moist but I don't think the recipe would have been better without it... And my kitchen would have not smelled like curry for a day.  Otherwise a good recipe.

This turned out fine but the taste reminded me too much of deviled eggs. I used 2 Tbsp butter, doubled the curry, added some cayenne, and used garlic salt. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for an hour in the fridge. I used boneless skinless thighs and baked for 20 minutes at 425. The chicken was moist and had lots of the flavor. But the flavor just reminded me of deviled eggs. Probably won't make again.

I used olive oil and honey mustard.  I used also boneless, skinless  chicken breasts.  I seasoned first the chicken with salt. Then I added olive oil and honey mustard and coated the chicken with the mixture and marinated them for an hour.  Then I baked them.  I baked them covered at first with aluminum foil, then removed the foil after some time and continued baking until done.  It was a very good dish.  This will be my go to recipe for baked chicken pieces.  I am giving this just 4 stars as I think this recipe can still be improved

This dish was delicious and my husband really liked it. I will definitely make it again, this time with a little more curry powder but will try turning the chicken over every fifteen minutes or putting a foil tent over it, as the honey burned a bit when it was cooked the full amount of minutes, even though it was basted every fifteen minutes.

I make it just as is written every time and it is amazing.  My 1 1/2  year old gobbles it down and he refuses to eat meat.  When it is too hot to turn on the oven I cook it on the stove and it is just as good, sometimes better.  I cook the chicken on both sides in some butter and then add the sauce and let it simmer for 10 minutes or more.  It is delicious!

I made it just as the recipes states.  The next time I will add a bit less butter and a bit more curry to bring out that taste more.  Outside of that, it was great and so much better than I thought it would be.   I will be making this again!

Added half the amount of butter like recommended. Also wouldn't cook it as long... I found it to be dry. I would say an hour tops for cooking. Other then that flavor was amazing and family loved it!

We loved this recipe, I did marinate it in the fridge for 1 hour prior to baking, next time I will take foil off after 30 min, then baste and continue to cook and brown. The drumsticks were tender and moist, and the flavor delicious. I have enough sauce left for the left overs. I served over white rice with corn bread and baked crispy zucchini,  easy recipe, will be a mainstay at our table.  Thank you. This was my first recipe from this site!

I read quite a few of the other reviews and made the following adjustments: eliminated butter (I was using leg/thigh/back attached pieces, so lots of fat); cut salt in half; doubled curry powder; used a grainy Bavarian style mustard; added 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. That sauce was wonderful. I'll add a bit more heat next time. The family commented that no one ingredient stood out - they all married together beautifully. The sauce was wonderful on Basmati rice. Will definitely make this again.

I loved this! Next time I will use NO butter at all. I made this recipe but changed to 2 tsp of curry powder, added garlic paste, cut down butter to 1/4 cup (but it was still unnecessarily oily given that I used chicken thighs). I did not need to double the recipe and used it on 8 chicken thighs. Cooked at 365 degrees for 55 minutes and then set it on broil for the last 5 min. Did not use foil and did baste it every 15 min with its own juices and oil. Next time I will add onions to the bottom/sides as another reviewer suggested and put some of the sauce under the skin, too. It was so good with roasted cauliflower and orzo rice pilaf on the side! WINNER - very juicy. Thanks to all for their reviews!

I made this with the suggestions made by other reviewers: half the butter, extra curry, dijon mustard, 1 tsp. garlic powder. I did use the same amount of salt.  I'm not a huge mustard fan, and was glad the mustard wasn't overpowering. It just seemed to be missing something as it was a tad bland to me, and although not dominant, the mustard didn't do it for me.

So let me first off say that I love this recipe, the description,  the videos,  the reviews were all so helpful. 

Because of my busy work life I find myself having to rely on my slow cooker to complete most recipes. For this sweet/tangy/curry filled greatness I decided I'd try my hand at slow cooking to perfection. 

First I followed the sauce ingredients exactly as written (used spicy brown mustard as the video mentioned). I had about 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast that needed to be cooked so I made the sauce, threw the chicken into the slow cooker, topped the chicken with the sauce, and let it cook on low for about 6 to 7 hrs. 

I like my chicken to be browned some so I decided to broil the result in the oven for able 5 or so min a side at the end.

let me tell you I love the result. And will be repeating the process for my loved ones.

First shot was way to buttery and way to honey sweet for my famil.  
Second shot I gave I changed up the recipe:
Used around 4 lbs of chic thighs bone in, skin on with fat and excess skin trimmed. Family thought it was to sweet. We did learn we love curry and the aroma that fills up our home.
I'm not done with this recipe though.

There have been so many helpful reviews with this. I definitely cut the butter in half and doubled the curry. I've made this a few times now and I changed it up with paprika, cumin and a bit of garlic when i made it last night. Also baked with corn cobs and carrot! fabulous recipe!

This was great! I made it with a whole chicken (5lbs). It took an extra 15 minutes to cook. I split it up into all the seperate parts and put it in a 9x13 baking dish. Then I mixed up the honey sauce with all the ingredients. I didn't have curry so I used turmeric, cumin and made my own variation with garlic powder and onion powder. This tasted great. I reduced the butter as everyone recommended and cooked it covered for the first thirty minutes. We made short work of a whole chicken. I served it with lentils and brown rice, which were a great accompaniment for the flavor of the chicken. Even the 4 year old ate it. The adults added extra heat with Louisiana hot sauce, which was so good. We also used the juices in the 9x13 pan by spooning them onto the chicken after plating it. You have to try this!

Loved this recipe.  I used only 4 chicken thighs with skin and bone and cut the ingredients in half.   I did not have foil so did not cover the chicken while baking.  It took about 35 minutes to bake.  The skin was brown and crispy and the meat was tender and tasty.   Thank you

This was really good - I used deli mustard and I really liked it. I used butterflied chicken so it only took 30 minutes  to cook. Next time  I will add some some ginger, should be even better for my taste.

Great combo of flavors--even my three picky eaters loved it! My comments: use similar chicken pieces instead of whole chicken (for even cooking), breasts for quicker cooking, add sliced carrots and potatoes around chicken pieces, reduce butter (even by a half), you could spice it up more, too, with another tsp curry. Foil on for one hour, turning/basting every 15 minutes, foil off for 30 minutes, 15 minutes per side. Served on rice, which absorbed the yummy juices.

Made as said it was okay. However I think it would be better with pork. There is a recipe  out there for Sweet Tea Brine Chicken it too was okay , I made it with pork chops and everybody loved it. I'll make this with pork chops and report back.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half and use chicken tenders.  It was so delicious, who'd a thunk that the curry, honey and mustard would be so delicious mixed together.

Loved it! The only modifications I made were to add more mustard powder and a splash apple cider vinegar. This is my new favorite recipe, but next time I am going to follow other reviewers advice and use less butter.

Great recipe.  Made with 3  large chicken thighs as there is only my husband & myself at home.  Followed several suggestions: layer of sliced onion on the bottom of the casserole dish, 1/4 cup melted butter,  1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, 1/8 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon paprika and fresh grated black pepper on top of the thighs (like the extra sauce, used the recipe amounts for the honey & mustard).  Covered with foil the 1st 30 minutes.  Then uncovered & basted every 15 minutes until internal temperature was at least 170.

Absolutely love this recipe. My family has asked me to make it three times already and each time I get raving reviews. I never watch the baking time because I usually just poke it with a fork until the blood stops running. I really love this recipe though. Would definitely make it again.

This was delicious! And it is such a versatile recipe. I used boneless skinless thighs, added garlic powder and chili pepper flakes, black pepper and doubled the curry. Next time I am going to try adding carrots and onions. Yum!

Love this chicken! I made it with chicken thighs and followed the suggestion to cut the butter in half. Next time, I'll probably let it marinate because the chicken was a tad bit dry (I also should have basted it more frequently). Flavor wise though, it was delicious! I was skeptical about adding curry but it's a must have to give this dish a complete flavor. Served it with some fried rice and roasted veggies. Yum!

I'm still new at this whole cooking thing ahhah so I didn't read ahead about repeatedly coating chicken, but I used a package of boneless skinless chicken breasts, a double batch of the sauce and just poured it over and baked it. It is so delicious. I put the rest in sandwich bags and spooned in some sauce and they are so juicy! The curry is just enough to spice it up but no too overwhelming-I'm definitely making this again!!

This turned good. My young kids liked it so I am likely to make it again. I added 1 tsp garlic and some turmeric. It still was too sweet that I will probably reduce the honey.

Awesome recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead.  My picky eaters loved it.

I followed the advice of others and cut the butter in half.  I love the sauce and see lots of potential to play with other variations such as cut up chicken breast, adding veggies and rice.

Followed the recipe to a " T".  My husband and I liked it a lot. Our children didn't care for it too much. May still Be alittle too mature for their taste buds:). I would however make it again for the adults!

This is a great one!  I followed some other reviewers advice and doubled the curry (we like curry), cut the butter to 1/4 c, added the 1/2tsp garlic powder, & 1/2tsp cayenne pepper.    I also cooked with chicken breast for simplicity.  Very flavorful and my 5 year old & 2.5 year old say this is one of their favorites!

We thoroughly enjoyed this. I used boneless chicken thighs. I used only 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of honey, 2 t curry powder, 3 garlic cloves, pepper and chopped fresh rosemary. I cooked for 45 minutes at 350F. I might try it with Dijon mustard next time. Served with a side of mushrooms and chili oil bok choy and some fresh tomatoes from the garden.

I used only 1/4 cup butter and 2 tsp. of curry. No salt. It was delicious, especially over rice. I did cover it with foil for the first 30 min, then uncovered for another 20 min or so at 400. Yum!

I had two casserole dishes,
About 12 chicken thighs with skin and bones.
I doubled the recipe.
I was out of curry so I used cumin.
I added some Paprica.
After 1 hour the chicken was nice and brown.
The meat was falling off of the bones.
It was  all floating in butter and grease after cooking.
I removed the chicken immediately and put on a plate.
It was great!!!
Next time I will use boneless/skinless thighs.



It needs some red chili papers though.

This was excellent! I made a few changes just for our tastes but I'm sure made as is would be fine. I used 1/4 c. Coconut oil for butter, doubled the sauce, added 8 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, used Dijon mustard, 6 tsp curry powder and sliced a medium onion to put in the bottom of pan. I only used 3 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. Covered with foil for 40 minutes, turned chicken over and continued baking uncovered until chicken was done.  Used the sauce over rice and it was amazing.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE AND MAKE IT ALL THE TIME NOW. I usually just get boneless skinless chicken thighs for this and the flavor is awesome. The chicken is always super juicy.  The amount of butter you should use depends on whether you are cooking a whole chicken or not.

I'm not a fan of curry so I just leave it out and the recipe is phenomenal. It's one that you would have to make an honest effort to mess it up. It's great with rice to get the extra juices.

This recipe was a hit with the entire family. Everyone had seconds and I didn't even get to taste it once!!! Being from the Caribbean islands, I did add more curry than the recipe required but it was just as good!!! I also covered mine and uncovered it for the last 15 minutes.

Four stars for this recipe, it was good, the meat was tender and the honey and mustard mix went really well with it. I also cut the butter as was indicated in the comments and used skinless, boneless breats. Mrs.Doherty was right in her comment though, it is a recipe where we can and ought to get creative with. Thank you fir this very good baseline recipe, I will definitely try it again with my own changes!

I made some changes:

Boneless skinless chicken thighs (5 large)instead of cut up chicken
2 tbl olive oil instead of butter
1/3 cup dijon mustard
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tsp mild yellow curry
1 tsp garam masala
2 large garlic cloves
4 med yukon gold potatoes skin on
1/2 small bag of baby carrots

I layered the chicken on top of the potatoes and carrots, poured sauce on top and baked for what seemed like forever. It took almost two hours to cook the potatoes the way I like. Next time I think I will get those small yukon gold potatoes that you microwave in the bag.  I will also blanch the thighs first.  Then I will add everything to a pan and bake. That should help to get dinner on table quicker.

I liked the suggestion to stick under the broiler for a few min at the end to get really nice color.

delicious glaze! I absolutely loved the glaze of this chicken - I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken, and placed them all in a large, shallow baking pan. It turned out pretty well! I also followed the other reviews and covered the chicken with tin foil and let cook for 30 minutes then flipped them/basted them and removed foil before cooking for another 40 minutes. great chicken, turns out very tender!

This was so easy and so delicious!!! I received rave reviews from my family and my in-laws. I did listen to the other reviewers and cut the margarine in half, as well as cooked it in the oven for the first 30 mins. covered in tin foil and then uncovered it and cooked it until it was crispy, every once in a while basting it with the sauce in the pan.  Thank you to both Gretchen and the reviewers.

This was pretty tasty. I used drumsticks and just a little more curry powder then called for.  I also used foil for the first half hour but the next time I do these I won't do that. They hardly browned up enough by the time the meat was cooked so that bit of advice from other reviewers did not work for me.  Thinking about trying it with wings next time.  Great flavor. Thanks for posting this.

My family loves this recipe as is but we prefer to use maple syrup instead of honey (it was all I had on hand once...and we loved it!).  I do typically reduce the butter by half.  Delicious!

Nom Nom Nom!! This was DELICIOUS and definitely one of better recipes I've made from All Recipes. I tweaked the recipe a little bit to fit my needs, as I think that is appropriate for anyone to do so I am sorry if my review is not exactly based on what the original recipe called for. I usually like to read the good and bad reviews before making any recipe and use the most common tips left on there. I cut the butter in half to 1/4 cup, upped the curry to 1 tablespoon, added sliced onion, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, and used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken. I also took some of the other tips on the reviews and cooked it with covered foil for the first 50 minutes, and then uncovered for the remaining time.  It was amazing! The chicken was soo juicy, and the flavor of the curry and honey mustard was just right.  It definitely tasted like an Indian dish, so if you are craving that type of meal I would recommend this as it is easy.  I also served it with brown rice and veggies, and will be making it for my family and friends to impress them ;)

I was worried about the combination of curry and mustard for small kids to accept. To my surprise it was a hit and everyone old and young likes the chicken very much. They said it was very tasty especially with rice. The color was golden brown.  Definitely will make it again.  Only thing is that I will use less butter next time.

I halved the butter but otherwise kept this the same. We really enjoyed it, definitely put it on the keeper list. I roasted some potatoes in the same pan at the same time. Great! Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe. I used chicken thighs without skin.  I want to say that I followed the recipe exactly but I forgot to add the butter. Still came out wonderful. The only thing I would change is par-boiling the chicken first. The sauce was watery and greasy without the butter and skin. My family still devoured it anyway. I will add this to our regular rotation.

I really liked this recipe. Very simple but really good flavor. I have a cousin who despises curry and she loved it. It wasn't overpowering in this recipe. What I will do in the future is definitely cut the amount of butter. I saw other reviewer say they had done so, but I wanted to make this recipe as is to see for myself what my preferences were. I definitely recommend cutting the butter by half. Will keep this recipe around.

I actually left the butter out all together (unintentionally) and this was still delicious! I added garlic salt & cayenne and put the thinly sliced onions on the bottom of the dish.  Those onions were amazing!  Next time I'll double them! Definitely a keeper!

I really liked this quick, easy recipe. I used boneless chicken breast which unfortunately doesn't hold the flavor as much but next time I will definitely make more of the sauce to use over mashed potatoes, rice, pasta, etc. I had sauteed peppers on the side with mashed potatoes.

I loved this recipe.  I did not have curry powder but followed a suggestion to add garlic.  I, also, cut the butter to 1/4 cup.  I followed another suggestion to cover with foil the first 30 minutes; then, I basted every 5 minutes for about 25 more minutes. I used boneless chicken breast...fairly thick pieces.  It was so moist and wonderfully delicious.   I put a small bowl of the sauce on the table which we spooned over...it was so good!

This was amazing!I used chicken legs instead. I always season my meat, at least lightly, to give it more flavor. I seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, and complete seasoning lightly. I did what everyone said and cut the butter in half. I also replaced the salt with garlic salt and doubled the curry powder. I also added cayenne pepper for spice.  It was amazing. Next time I think I will add more honey to balance the curry, but I love curry so it wasn't a big deal to me. I served that with country crock sweet potatoes and my boyfriend destroyed it.

This is a keeper!  Only had 3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts so I cut into chunks.  Based on reviews, I used less butter - 1/3 C - and kept all else the same.  Covered to bake at 350 for 30 minutes, uncovered and basted for 10 min., broiled 5-7 min.  Meat was slightly dry - next time will bake covered for 20 min instead of 30.  THANK YOU for this!

Very yummy! I made as directed except I did reduce the butter by half as other reviewers suggested. It turned out moist and very flavorful. It was a hit at our party.My husband suggested that next time I sprinkle sesame seeds over the cooked chicken. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I very much enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have curry powder, so I subbed in chili powder. I do think that the next time I will double the spice though. Also, I halved the butter and think I still could use less. Served with cheesy grits and asparagus, delish!

I'm not much of a cook.  My boyfriend calls my style of cooking 'cajun'...everyone else calls it burnt.  My dad suggested I try this website for some new ideas and this recipe was the first 'daily dish' since I joined.  My son (very picky eater) and boyfriend have asked for it TWICE this week!  I love it because it's quick and easy.  I would like to make the honey glaze a little crispier without taking away the healthy aspect of skinless.  Any suggestions?  
Thanks Gretchen!  This kitchen success has given me the courage to try some other new 'daily dish' recipes which my family is loving!

Really good!  I made mine with chicken thighs and took another's advice to bake it covered in foil at 350 degress for the first 30 minutes. Then foil is removed and chicken is basted, basking for another 40 minutes or so until nicely browned.  I decreased the butter to 1/3 cup and increased the curry to 2 teaspoons.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thank you!

Turned out great! I used just drumsticks and had more chicken than the recipe called for, so I doubled everything except the butter and salt. Left the butter the same because of other comments, and the salt because I have to watch my sodium. Thinking I'll try that glaze/sauce recipe with some pork chops, pork loin, or some ribs.

Very tasty.
On the recommendation of others I used only 1/4 cup butter (half the amount recommended) and 2 tsp curry powder (twice as much).
Next time I will use even less butter as others have done, since the chicken fat is plenty (unless you take the skin off the chicken).
I cooked this for 30 minutes covered with foil and then 45 minutes more basting a couple of times.
Overall, great place to start experimenting...honey, mustard, curry powder and butter is a great base!
Wonder if this would be even better with some crunchy celery or peppers....??? Mmm...

Absolutely Fantastic!!!!  Not only is this a simple and easy meal with limited ingredients, it is so good I will be making another batch tomorrow as there were no leftovers!  As per other comments, I doubled the sauce, used half the amount of butter and added 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I scored the chicken and marinated it in the sauce for 2 hours.  This is definitely a keeper and will be made on a regular basis!

Yum!!  Used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand.  Added a dash of cayanne and reduced butter to 2tbs.  I might eliminate completely next time.  Sliced 1/2 a med onion into rings and layed under chicken.  Marinated in fridge for 4 hours prior to baking.  This came out so moist and delicious!  Served over basamati rice with broccoli and carrots.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight!!

Not a 5 star to me because the sauce lacks interest.  I made it as directed but didn't find much excitement there- perhaps more curry as others have suggested would have been better.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and that was a BIG disappointment both in looks and texture (didn't affect my rating though).  I think the dish will  be best if you use a whole chicken, skin and all, for a nice presentation and good mouth appeal.  And that's what the original poster intended!!!  The sauce was watery there at the last, but I drained it off, separated most of the grease, and then boiled it to thicken it.  When I poured the sauce over the chicken once more, it made a nice glaze that stayed on well.

Being a single dude cooking with a toaster oven, I always need to pare down these recipes. I used a 4 pack of chicken thighs and eyeballed the measurements to equal about 1/2 of what was originally called for. I think I used a little too much honey, and not quite enough curry, but it was still very flavorful. I will try again and make the adjustments, as I really wanted that curry flavor to be more present. But it's very easy, and definitely a keeper!

We enjoyed this.  I halved the mustard, honey and butter and had enough sauce to baste three thighs and a drumstick.  The glaze is delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception that I used skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken so I only needed to bake them for 45 minutes. It was WONDERFUL!!!!  So flavorful. We loved it and will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

For some reason I never buy Curry but I have TWO bottles of Garam Marsala, and I use that in its place, and it is always good.  Great meal, everyone enjoyed it!

All these comments about not giving it a high rating because you "tweaked" the recipe here and there.  Who cares?!  This is easy and delicious.  I would never have thought about using curry with honey and mustard and it added such a wonderful (but gentle) flavor!  And yes, I did cover the chicken with tin foil for the first 30 minutes as recommended.  Other than that I followed the original recipe.  My husband and friends raved about it.

Woke up this morning thinking about cooking something different for the family for dinner tonight. Logged on to check email as usual and there it was. Followed the recipe per instructions and ingredients, quick, simple and easy with results being "Outstanding" - Chicken was tender and juicy with the sauce making it the meal I was looking for. Served with Wild Rice and Broccoli Florets in butter, everyone "Loved It", sad part, no left overs - All kinds of potential with this sauce - Thank you Gretchen Ramey and Allrecipes.com -

Only gave it four stars, because I haven't made this recipe, but have made a similar recipe for many years, but my recipe calls for 1-1/2 Tablespoons curry and no salt or butter.  Also you only baste it twice during the baking time of 1 hour.  Had forgotten about it until I received this email.  Will be making it soon, as it is yummy!

I made this recipe with breasts instead of a whole chicken.  The taste was awesome but it came out a little dry.  Maybe it should be covered with foil for part of the baking time? But the curry added a very nice twist to the regular honey mustard seasoning.

This is probably the best chicken recipe I have ever made. It is important to baste every 15 minutes. The chicken looks and tastes amazing. It makes the house smell so good. I am going to try cutting back on the butter next time. I am going to use this on wings. YUM!

This recipe was.....different. I wasn't 100% sold on it, it's probably because I wasn't familiar with the curry spice and I think it made it a bit overwhelming. Maybe next time, I'll use 1/2 a tsp of curry spice.

I was almost ready to throw away the entire marinade after tasting it. Thank God I didn't. The taste took a turn for the BEST when this was cooked. I was so surprised and have made it AGAIN within the week. This is a great recipe to use for company if you want something different. I served ours with rice and vegetables.

Ok, really sweet. I followed the recipe pretty much as listed above except that I seasoned the chicken with a little lawrys and let it sit for about 10 minutes before cooking it. My family said they loved it, but I think they just said that to not hurt my feelings lol. I will make this again, but next time add a little more mustard to cut the sweetness of the honey.

This  is so good! I used skinless chicken breast and added some white wine before I put
It in the oven. I will make this again.

AWESOME!!,,, i used  boneless thighs & legs, used spicy yellow mustard.  my brother-in-law loved it so much, that he ate 4 pieces and was almost licking the plate! i didn't cut back on the butter like others did... everything balanced out very nicely. i will be making this again!!

The flavor of the sauce is good, and the recipe is very easy to make. I cooked it for the full 75 minutes (I'm a complete novice when it comes to preparing meat, so I wasn't sure if it was done or not) and it turned out a little dry.

This was very tasty, but I agree with other reviewers about cutting the butter in half.  I baked the chicken along with carrots and onions in the same dish, and they made an easy and tasty garnish to put on top of the chicken.

Loved this recipe.  Didn't change anything.  The chicken was moist and sauce was so good over rice.  I covered the dish with foil for the 1st 30 minutes.  All 3 kids under 9yo and husband loved it.  Best of all, I can now use the leftovers for Curry Chicken Salad and it'll taste so much better than just adding plain white chicken seasoned with curry powder.  This is going in the dinner rotation, so glad I tried it!

Good but a little sweet for my taste.  I halved the recipe and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I added carrots and bell pepper before I started baking.  At the end I added steamed broccoli.  It reminds me of Chinese food and I think it would go well over rice.

I'm not to much into chicken breasts, but mixing two recipes, and adding a bit more honey, and I love garlic on everything, well, I look at these kind of breasts different , now.At the end , if you like, a dash of hot sauce, just a very quick splash, :)

AMAZING! I cut the butter in half (1/4 cup) and used olive oil instead (we have dairy allergies in the family) and besides using a bigger bird (pushing 5lbs) I kept everything else the same. The family wants to make this a weekly meal and I'm not arguing with them.

Made as written, except cut the butter down to two tablespoons, which was just about right.  It was very good.  Will make again.

Awesome! Made it again tonight, increasing curry powder, and using skinless but bone-in chicken breast.  I plan on bbq'ing a whole chicken on the weekend at the trailer-my neighbours will be so jealous!

Remember to keep basting and don't over cook it.

Everybody enjoyed this.  Used bone in chicken breasts with skin, only 1/4 cup butter, doubled curry, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. No time for marinating and still flavor came through.  Covered with foil for 1st 45 minutes, then removed for last cooking time.  Even good cold in chicken wraps day after.  Easy preparation for cooking in a hurry.  It's a keeper.

Delicious! You can halve the butter if you are trying to be healthy as others have noted. We usually use a mix of chicken thighs and drumsticks because that is what we have around. We serve it with couscous that we pour some of the extra sauce over. YUUUUUMMMMM!

We loved this recipe!! I had chicken legs so I adjusted to 4 servings. I did decrease the butter and the salt by a little because I like to stay healthy. I kept the mustard, honey, and curry the same though. I only had a little bit of regular mustard left so I had to use regular mustard and brown mustard. It came out excellent. I wouldn't change this recipe.

We really loved this recipe.  I tripled the curry powder because I love curry and like a little extra spice.  I made the sauce when my man brought home the wrong kind of chicken (thin, schnitzel strips) so I marinaded it for an hour and sauteed it in the pan.  It was delicious.  I have also baked it using turkey and chicken breasts and loved it every time!

Loved it!  My family loved it.  It's a lot of honey for us though (sugar/calorie-wise), and while I felt good about using half the butter, I didn't cut back on the honey.  The honey is what makes it!  I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of curry, based on other reviews.  To go with the chicken I served brown rice with dried cranberries and slived almonds.  The meal was a big hit.  Not your average baked chicken.

Quite good.  It's just that we don't eat chicken skin anymore.  I'll try it again with skinless.

This was AWESOME!!! 
I was unsure of how this would turn out but even my extremely finicky family ate it...& loved it! I followed the other reviews & cut the butter by half & added an extra half tsp of curry powder. I only used about a quarter tsp of salt because I always brine my chicken ahead of time.  Will definitely be making this again! Great job. Thanks for sharing Gretchen.

I was excited to make this because of all the great reviews. However, this did not turn out good despite me following the instructions to a T. It was ridiculously sweet. Disappointed. Plus, the sauce stained the pan yellow.

It was great, however, i also thought it was too sweet. Ive had to cut back on both the butter, but specially the honey. I get a sugar headache, instead of sugar high. and this dish ddi that to me. It happens when I consume too much sugar at one time. The curry is great reminds me of my Indian sister-in-law's kitchen. So it gets only 4 sttars because its delish just too sweet, if you dont like sweetness that much cut back about half of the honey. I also added cayene pepper. Yum.

This had the potential to be really good but it left something desired, the flavors mixed really well, but perhaps i thought it would be a little bit richer. The glaze was a little watery. I used margarine, maybe next time all try with natural butter. I did like the sweetness the honey gave to the chickens skin and the curry wasnt over powering.

Oh my gosh this stuff is delicious!!  I used boneless , skinless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and a 1/2 a stick of butter.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of garam masala, which was amazing!  I paired it with jazmine flavored rice and it definitely gave it a more Indian flair.  I'm already planning on making this again next week!

Definitely only needs half the butter.  I upped the spices with additional curry, turmeric, garlic, red & white  ground pepper.  The cooking time is probably 2X longer than necessary.  Disregard that and cook until chicken is 165 F. It's very tasty over rice.  Broccoli makes a great side.

I did not make any changes, and the chicken was tender and delicious. The only reason I gave it  3 stars instead of 4 was because my kids did not like it.

Yummy-licious!  I did skin my chicken and used only 3 tbsp. of butter.  I added some cumin and crushed garlic too.  I let it marinade for about an hour and also threw in some potatoes all together in a casserole dish.  I baked at 350 for 1 hr covered in foil.   Upped the temp. to 425 and cooked another 25 mins.  Came out perfect, family loved it.  I may have licked my plate!

This was great! I made it as published except halved the sauce for only 6 thighs. However, I wish I'd read the reviews first. Next time I will cut the butter down at least 50% and cover it for half the time so it doesn't get overbrown. Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!  I wasn't sure how it would come out, but it is the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.  I liked trying different flavors, this was perfect! I cut the chicken into smaller pieces so it took less time to cook.  The mixture turned a perfect golden brown color and it was done!

excellent flavor!! Love it.. but i made a little changes from reading the reviews. cut the butter to 1/4 cup and mustard to 1/3 cup and I added minced garlic(1 clove). I baked them covered with foil at 350 for 1 hr then increased to 400, baked uncovered for another 15mins or so until the top is nicely browned... Yummy!! thanks Gretchen for sharing this great recipe! :))

We all loved this, even our picky two and four year olds like it.  I used skinless chicken thighs, reduced the butter to just under 1/4 cup and cooked it covered for the first 40 minutes.  It turned out perfect - thanks for a great recipe!

I signed up just to comment on this recipe.  Simply amazing!  I too cut down on the butter and also added  1/2 cup of coconut milk.  I also made this with shrimp instead of chicken.  Simply delicious.  I think this might be the recipe to get me the proposal!

It would be unfair to rate it 4 stars because I forgot to baste which is why the bottom of the chicken was tastier than the top! This is a good basis for experimentation with spices. I' have to try omitting the curry to find out if the curry really added anything to it. I'll try substituting other spices like cayenne, garlic salt, ginger, etc.

This was really, not very good.  Sorry, but the chicken was rubbery and it had no taste.  Even with the basting, it wasn't that flavorful.  NO ONE in my family liked it.

Made this pretty much by the recipe and it was fantastic. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks, reduced the butter a bit, and added some minced garlic. Roasted uncovered, turning the chicken about 20 minutes in and then turning again for the last 20 minutes. Served it with rice and yum! Husband and kids loved it.

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I can't get enough of this delicious chicken! I use two chicken breasts and reduce the sauce by half. We also double the curry powder because it pairs so well with the honey mustard mixture, and isn't very spicy at all. I give it five stars because I love it so much, and because everyone I serve it to loves it!

This was pretty good, but not sensational. The whole family gave it thumbs up though and it was super easy, so I'll definitely make it again. Few changes: used biryani mix because I didn't have curry powder. Also cooked it for only 45 min. on 350F. Used 6 chicken legs. There was way more than enough sauce. I'll probably halve the sauce next time.

Read some reviews and halved the butter but I also halved the honey (for the calories).  Left the quantities the same on the (coarse Dijon) mustard and the curry.  Only used 3/4 t. of salt.  It was just PERFECT for our tastes.  I put it in a 9x11 dish and the sauce was already more than half way up the sides of the chicken.  I did cover it for the first 45 minutes with foil.  Very simple and very, very good.  Thank you for such a quick and tasty dish.  This would be wonderful over brown rice.

I've never used these spices and was concerned but it was yummy; my hubby loved it.  I didn't have curry so used cumin instead and cooked boneless chicken thighs for ultimate moistness and tenderness.  As recommended, I used a foil cover for 30 min and then removed for the next 45.  Will make again for sure.

I substituted cayenne pepper for the curry. It was a hit but next time I'll use a little less honey, it was just a little sweet for my taste.

very good! I also cut the butter in half and used 1&1/2 tsp curry. I also added a large clove of minced garlic as someone else mentioned. I would have thrown in some diced onion as well but my kids are not onion fans. I will make often and probably up the curry to 2 tsp and maybe even allow it to sit in the sauce over night before cooking.  Highly recommned! My husband, 5 year old and six year old sons all had seconds!

Extremely easy and absolutely delicious.  It doesn't get any better.  I also cut the butter and did not miss it.  There is already so much flavour in this dish.  I highly recommend this as it's the perfect weeknight rush dinner.  I serve it with rice which is excellent topped with the extra sauce.

This was so amazing! While it was baking my husband and I kept sneaking peaks because it smelled so delicious.  Didn't make any changes, only additions.  I cut up organic carrots, onion & rutebega, and placed on bottom of roasting dish.  Placed chicken pieces on top of vegetables, and poured sauce over chicken.  I served this with steamed rice.  It was absolutely one of the best chicken & roasted veggie dishes I have ever had.  Thanks!

OMG LOVED this recipe...it is now a family favorite. the only thing I changed was I did 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of 1 tsp salt and I seasoned the chicken with slap ya mama and I did add 1/4 tsp cayenne (we are Cajun~) and I doubled the amount of curry powder. I used boneless chicken breasts too instead and baked it covered for 30 minutes then uncovered for 20 minutes and basted it after the 30 mins and then at 10 min intervals. WAS AWESOME!!!!

Great recipe!  I was looking for something different than just a plain roasted chicken and this was perfect.  I didn't cut up the whole chicken and it still came out delish.

This was really really good!  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole cut up chicken, so the baking time was only about 20-25 minutes.  Also, I didn't use ANY butter, didn't see the need to.  The honey, mustard & curry were perfectly fine without butter.

Good flavor.  Cut back on the butter so it's not swimming in oil and use dark meat as the white tends to dry out.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because I changed a few things. I halved the honey, used 1 tablespoon butter, and increased the mustard to 1/3 cup. Also, I cooked thighs with the skin on and boneless skinless chicken breasts. The thighs came out way better the breasts, they were way to dry. Will make again but not cook as long is using skinless chicken.

I found this recipes easy to prep and delicious. I did however brown the skin of the chicken in pan before baking (more taste).

This recipe has become a staple in our home! It's so quick and easy, but delicious. The recipe is great as is, but I add a little Cayenne pepper and sometimes some chili powder when I make it to add a little kick. They flavors work great together!

Love this dish! I made according to directions and it was wonderful! I think next time (and there will be many more) I will marinate as some have suggested.

Absolutely delicious.  I ran out of mustard the second time I decided to try this so I used Sweet Baby Rays original barbeque sauce to substitute for the mustard and it was outstanding.

I used muuuuuch less butter (and substituted grapeseed oil for the fat as well). I also used only chicken breast and baked til they were about done, turned the oven up and let them get more golden since they were still quite pale. I also added some tarragon and white pepper for added flavor. I tasted the mixture and it definitely needed a little something else.   I marinated the chicken in the mixture over night, placed them in a baking dish, poured the remaining mixture over the breasts and let it all bake together for the entire time. This was great with rice and sliced cold into salad.

I have made this recipe many times now for my DH (he loves it!).  It's a very simple yet tasty recipe.  In order to cut down on the fat, I use skinless chicken breasts and use only 1/2 the amount of butter called for in the recipe.  As others have suggested, the first 30 minutes I bake the chicken covered in foil then baste the chicken every 10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.

This was very nice. I added some golden raisins to it, because I wanted to. Very easy and good! My only suggestion is to make sure you watch carefully and probably cover, I made a mess of my pan when the honey caramelized

This recipe was so disappointing.  The scent of curry was delicious as I was mixing it up, but the dish had very little overall flavor.  This one wasn't even worth tweaking.

Delicious!  I had to change a few ingredients, but it was still awesome!  I used 1/4 cup of i can't believe it's not butter, a "swirl around the bowl" of olive oil, 1/2 cup of honey, 1/4 cup spicy brown mustard, no salt and 1 TBSP of curry.  I did cover it for about 35-40 minutes @ 350, then uncovered it for about 20 minutes.  There was still a bowl full of juice left, which could easily be made into a gravy, but I just put it on the table as it was and we poured it over our homemade fries....yummy!  You know when your husband tells you to keep a recipe, it's good!

I have tried several versions of this honey/curry chicken but this one was really easy and really good.  I too, followed the modifications such as reducing the butter more than half, increased the curry, used stone ground mustard, cut into small pieces and baked for 30 min covered and another 10 uncovered.

I made this with 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I reduced the butter to 2Tbs and everything else by half, and added in a little olive oil.  I just poured it over the chicken and baked it in the oven for 20 minutes. It was delicious!!

Really good flavour, I went back and forth about whether to keep the skin on or off, chose on, wish I hadn't, just wasn't as crispy as I was hoping for.

First time I made this exactly as written, but used chicken thighs instead of the cut up whole chicken (easier).  The flavor was great. The next time I made this I wanted to make it a little lighter on calories so I totally cut out the butter and found it really isn't necessary, so now I make it without.  I love curry, so I use just a little more of that too.  Very good recipe

This came out great! I made a few changes, but nothing too major. I added a bit more curry than the recipe called for and also threw in a 1/2 a teas. of cayenne pepper because we like a little kick. I shook salt directly on the chicken rather than mixing it into the sauce.   It smelled so Indian and I was worried, because my boyfriend does not really like Indian food, but coupled with the honey, the curry was not overpowering at all, but complimented the dish wonderfully. I served it over instant mashed potatoes and it was delicious.  Honey Baked Chicken was so easy to make and very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Used brown mustard and what I could salvage of our yellow mustard to make 1/4 cup. Also added some garlic powder because I like garlic. The smell was different, but the taste was great. Kids and husband alike loved it. Thanks

Yum yum YUMMY! I made this using 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, marinating for about 3 hours before cooking.  I served it with Wild & Brown Ready Rice (one of my most favorite finds) with some of the sauce drizzled over both.  Try it... you'll be hoooked!

This was so good.  I didn't change a thing and am not likely too.  Really tasty, very easy and, since it browns nicely, it looks yummy too!

Fantastic Recipie Base. I took some advice and skipped the butter and used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard. I put the extra sauce in a pan on the stove and added a touch of cornstarch to thicken it up. It went just beautifully over the chicken.

I hate to give this 4 stars after reading all the wonderful comments and recommendations.  I liked it, but did not find it that outsanding - I did use skinless, boneless chick breasts - even tho' I cut down the baking time, they still seemed overdone and not as juicy as many reported - next time I will use plumper pieces of chicken.  I also cut the sauce ingredients in half which seemed very fine with my 4 chicken breasts.

I made this with 8 chicken breast tenders instead of a whole chicken (we prefer white meat) and I covered the dish with foil for the first half hour but otherwise followed the recipe.  I thought it was an easy, 'ok' meal... but my husband raved about it.  Even asked me to make it again next week.  So I guess 4 stars would be average between the 3 stars I would give it, and the five stars my husband would.  :)

I HATE mustard with a passion and I loooved this! As I was mixing up the marinade, I tried a little and was turned off based on how strong it was. Yet, after it cooked, the chicken was fantastic! I will definitely make this again!

I used this with boneless skinless chicken breasts as others have had but no one like it.  I covered it for the first half hour turning and basting  the other half hour or so but it was dry and did not taste good,  did not coat the chicken well.  Only used half the butter and it was still very soupy.

So tender and DELICIOUS! I only had 1/3 c honey, so I added brown sugar to make up for what was missing. I love curry, so I used 2 1/2 teaspoons, and left the other ingredients the same. Also, I kept foil on the pan for the first 30 mins so it wouldn't be too dark. PERFECT. I'll be making this again!

The chicken was moist and lightly browned but the sauce/liquid in the pan was very runny.  I doubled the curry and the taste was very mild.  It was good but we prefer a thicker stronger tasting sauce.

Delicious and easy. I also cut back to 1/4 c butter and honey each, 2 tbsp spicy brown mustard and 1/2 tsp salt and curry powder. Husband and kids loved it.  Will definitely make this often, especially during the winter months. Excellent with rice and a red cabbage/apple dish also found off this site.

I just found this recipe last week and have already made it twice!  This is one of very few recipes I've NOT tweaked.  This is wonderful, unique and incredibly easy.  Reviews from all the fed mouths were positive and raving.  My MotherInLaw even liked it saying she has never liked Honey Baked Chicken.  I've used dijon mustard vs. straight yellow.  Threw in some Smoked Spanish Paprika the second time around to deepen the flavor-not that it really needed anything.  This is both a crowd pleaser and chef pleaser.  Thank you for this!

Yummilicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and followed other reviewers advice to use only half the butter. I planned on some left for my husband's lunch the next day, but he cleaned it all out at supper. The sweet and tangy flavor was delicious!

Simple and easy recipe.  We always use thighs or legs as white meat tends to get too dried out.  Also, we follow other reviews and cut back the butter, cover for half of the cooking time and then uncover.

Delicious doesn't even describe this dish...the kids loved it, the hubby loved it, I loved it.  It's so quick and easy to make.  I use boneless skinless chicken and I don't use a whole tsp of salt - it seems like a lot.  It makes a lot of sauce, so the sauce could be cut in half.  Serve with rice or noodles to soak up the extra, DELICOUS sauce!

The chicken was pretty bland. I was hoping to taste more of the honey but it was pretty underwhelming.

My dad is a picky eater, but always gets seconds when I make this dish! I have never used 1/2 cup of butter, just because of the other reviews. It is always delicious and easy to make! Makes everyone happen

This is a great recipe! My husband and the kids loved it! I made a little bit of change though. I used Dijon mustard and cut  the butter in half as recommended by others.

Excellent flavor combination.  To reduce fat and calories I used 2 chicken breasts sliced into 1" strips, 1T olive oil, 1T honey, 1t Dijon mustard, 1t curry powder.   In a med bowl I mixed the honey, mustard and curry then added the chicken let it marinate for 30 min. Heated the oil on med in a frying pan for 3 minutes then added the chicken, cooked on med for 6 minutes each side. Then it works out to 340 calories & 15g fat per serving.

YUUUUMMMMMMMM! Soo good, and soo easy! I think you could even get away with making this for company, though it will definitely become one of our regulars...I made it with nearly 7lbs of split chicken breasts, and wished it had more sauce, next time I will probably use thighs or drums.Great with cooked carrots and brown rice!

This was delicious! Not too strong, but a good combination of sweet and tangy. I cut the butter in half and doubled the curry powder, and it was perfect.

Delicious. I used about half the sauce and cooked a panful of boneless chicken breasts and some thighs in an oven bag. I served chunks of the tender chicken breast with a package of Green Giant Immunity blend vegetables (cauliflower, orange and yellow carrots and dried cranberries in a butter sauce) over some angel hair pasta. Great fall flavors. We loved it! With the remaining chicken breasts, I made Fruited Curry Chicken Salad by Karen L. Baker. This was also fabulous. I packed them as wraps in our lunches. I am using the thighs today to make a chicken tortilla soup.

This chicken is melt in your mouth delicious! I made it for the first time for a first date a little over a year ago.  Well, he was very impressed and thought I cooked better than restaurants. I couldn't believe I had cooked something so good myself. Now we're getting married and he STILL remembers this dish from our first date! For a guy to remember what he ate over a year ago it MUST of been good! Definitely give this one a try!

Very good - whole family enjoyed it, even the 1 & 3 year old.  I used chicken breasts and 1/2ed the butter as suggested by others.  Served with rice and steamed broccoli - will definitely do this one again.  I made this again and added some carrots to the honey mixture and baked along with the chicken - made a nice sort of candied carrots

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a minor change to the recipe though, since I don't keep curry powder one hand I used cayenne pepper in paced of it.

The chicken tasted great on the outside but was dry inside.  Admittedly I modified the recipe to be chicken filets that I pan seared, but just an FYI done this way they are dry.  Perhaps if I had punctured filets and marinated they would have been more moist, or if there was some acid/citrus it might have helped.  The outside did carmelize very well.

Made this last night.Very good, I added oj to the sauce and red onions. Did not seem to bake as fast as said so left it in for another 20min. The best though was tonight I made chicken and rice soup with the leftovers. It was awesome. I shredded the leftover chix, added the cooked carrots, wild rice also left over and a jar of mushrooms.I heated on stove with juices leftover from nite before added more water and chix soup base let simmer. Then I added a roux made of stick of butter,3 tbl flour and about 3 C milk ..let thicken up and added to soup of coarse I added more currie, thyme and pepper soup was delilous and did not even feel like we were eating last nites dinner..yummmmmmm

I read the reviews and followed other people's suggestions.  I used chicken thighs (because it's what I had), decreased the butter to 6 tablespoons, and baked it covered in tinfoil for the first hour.  It turned out wonderfully.  I served it with rice and sauted zucchini.  My S/O loved it and said that he really wants me to keep the recipe in the dinner rotation.    While it was good, I had to separate the grease from the sauce in order to have some to pour over the rice.  Next time I'll use even less butter.  Maybe 1/4 cup like other recommend.  I'll only use 1/2 the marinade at the start.  At 45 minutes, I'll drain the grease (from the fatty thighs) and put the rest of the marinade in.

The honey flavor is delicious, but I agree it needs less butter and more curry.

I gave it a 4 because it's easy and tasty.  I followed the recipe but I will try some of the tips in the other reviews.  My husband quite liked it but said he only gave it a 3.5 because he thought it wasn't spicy enough.  Put he practically licked his plate clean.  Definitely hitting the permanent rotatation of meals in the house.

A very good recipe. I added a little more curry and halfed the butter. I also used boneless breast, boneless thighs and legs. Covered it for about 40 minutes and then finished uncovered and basted.  Next time will make some Jasmine rice to go with this.

Good recipe. I doubled the curry, added a little more honey and mustard, and cut the butter in half. I also used 3 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken and kept it lightly covered with tin foil until the final 30 minutes.

First of all, I haaaate curry. But this recipe (and the reviews) intrigued me so I decided to try it. I followed the recipe exactly. It smelled horrible (to me) while cooking. But OMG it tasted SOOOOO GOOD! And it looked BEAUTIFUL! This is definitely a keeper and who knows, maybe it will change my opinion on curry! Thanks for sharing!

AWWW this was so good!!! I used 3 large boneless breasts --and I think it was a mistake- it was not as juicy- ended up adding a little chicken broth. Also, browned the chicken pieces in a skillet first just to add "that" flavor. I did double the sauce mixture- (cut the butter a bit) -so we'd have enough to add to the rice I served it over. BUT- IT WAS EXCELLENT!! Loved the flavor!!Thanks so much for another great recipe!!

Great recipe! Love the idea of honey and mustard. I've coated a turkey with mustard before roasting, but never tried the addition of honey. For this recipe, I used 2 Tsp Curry, added a little minced Garlic, splash of Cayenne powder, and 1/2 C Olive oil(instead of the butter). I used 2 whole game hens and marinated them all day. Also grilled them whole on the Traeger pellet grill w/ pecan flavored pellets, WOW, they came out awsome. Thanks for a great marinade recipe.

I found this exact recipe for the crockpot yesterday. The flavor wasn't too bad. It was missing something though. I didnt have curry powder & found a review that replaced it with onion & garlic powder.

This is a good dish! I made it when my boyfriend's niece stayed with us. They both loved it! Being that I don't eat chicken very often, I only ate a little bit of it, but this is defiantly a keeper!

I made this with no modifications to the recipe except that I used bone-in chicken breasts and took the skin off.  Served it over basmati rice with a little curry cooked in it also and drizzled the top of the chicken and rice with the honey glaze.  It was amazing!!!  I will definitely make this again.  Easy to fix, easy to eat and DELISH!!

Tasty and very easy to make! I saved this recipe a while ago and finally tried it tonight using boneless, skinless chicken breasts each cut into thirds. I marinated the chicken in the sauce (used 1/2 the butter, no salt and honey mustard dijon) in the baking dish for about an hour, then baked it covered for 30 min., flipped chicken and baked another 15-20 minutes uncovered. I served it with yellow rice, next time I think a white rice will compliment the gravy and chicken better. Thanks for a great recipe!

OK - so very, very good and so very, very easy.  I adjusted a lot - as in very little butter, chicken tenderloins, kept the honey, mustard and curry sauce at half measurements even though the butter was cut down to maybe 1 TBsp.  Family loved it.  Me too!

This is good. I rate it 5, although I thought it turned out a little dry. Maybe because I used frozen chicken instead of fresh? Great sauce though.

This was good.  Nothing spectacular but good.  I also cut the butter in half and still it was pretty greasy when done.  I used chicken thighs and realized at the last minute that I didn't have any curry so I added some hot sauce.  I'll try again when I have the curry and maybe use boneless skinless breasts to cut down on the greasiness.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it with the whole chicken the first time and then modified it to use chicken tenderloins or chicken breast and I have to say that any way you make it - it tastes spectactular.  This is now a family favorite.  It tastes excellent served over a bed of rice and some veggies.  Yum, Yum.

I thought that these were wonderful. I did use Dijon mustard as suggested and less paprika.  I LOVE spicy but my boyfriend, not so much.  I am sure I will use this recipe again.  I enjoyed it with garlic mashed potatoes as one of the sides.  Then you get a little bit of salty and sweet.

5/14/2009 - I was kind of disappointed with this.  The chicken was nice & juicy, but I couldn't taste the glaze at all.  7/31/2011 - I was kind of in a bind for something to make tonight with chicken, so I thought I'd give this another try, since I had all the ingredients.  Changed from 3 to 5 stars, MUCH BETTER!  I used some other reviewers hints - boned, skinned chicken breasts, less butter, Dijon, garlic salt & garam masala.  I also marinated the chicken in the refrigerator for about 1-1/2 hours before baking @ 425 for 20 minutes.  Served with a green salad and cranberry-walnut bread from the wonderful French bakery not far from our house.  Would be great with basmati rice...next time, I guess.

Excellent chicken!  We had capens, so they were monster huge, and it was probably a total of 4 lbs with just the breast meat.  As a result, it took an hour and a half with the basting every 15 minutes.  Great flavor and so easy--my favorite type of food!  Bf liked it too.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was okay. Me and my 4 yr old liked it, however my 1,3, and 7 didn't. I dont think I'll be making it again.

This was great!! I did modify it some like the others by marinating it for at least an hour and cooking with foil for the first 30 minutes. I've never cooked with curry, so I didn't have it and was scared to go out and try it. I just used chili powder for some kick and it was good. I also added a dash of garlic. This was really great though!! I will definetly be making it again!

Wonderful!  Did as others recommended - reduced butter in half, doubled curry powder, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Served over basmati rice.  Used frozen chicken and baked for close to 2 hrs until dark brown.

Very good recipe!  I changed it a little bit using less butter, and adding a few of my own spices.  I also used boneless skinless breast halves instead of a whole chicken. Turned out awesome.  We used the extra sauce for dipping!

Wow this was really good. So easy too. The kids loved it. I cooked it for 1 1/2 at 300 covered (I didn't want to be basting it constantly) then uncovered it and cooked it at 400. So it could crisp up. I will make this one often. Thanks!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I took others advice and only used 1/2 the margarine.  Other than that I followed the recipe and used chicken thighs because it's what I had.  This turned out great.  It's simple and gave us a little something different to have for dinner.  I will be using this recipe again.

This recipe was simple yet delicious! I was short on time so didn't marinade the chicken, but it still came out great. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and used dijon mustard. Will make again.

We only had chicken breasts, but they were very good! I always get nervous by the strong vinegar-y mustard smell, but the flavor is much more mild- very well balanced with the honey. My husband has since requested this meal twice.

Tried this recipe tonight on an extra picky sister.  It was fantastic.  I did do as others have suggested and cut butter to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon of garam marsala.  Will be making this again. Thanks for such a good recipe

This recipe is good, not the best I have ever had but it was good and I will be making it again. I used boneless skinless chicken breast because that is all I had and that's what I prefer. I used all the butter amount even though some people said to cut back. I didn't have curry powder we don't really like any spices and never use them. I made this up this morning and let my chicken sit in it all day. I cooked it at 350 for 30 mins with reyonlds wrap on took it off and cooked it for another 30 mins, every 15 I turned it over and poured the juice on it. The best part of it is that it didn't dry up like chicken usually does.  We had alittle left over and going to have it tomorrow.

I used chicken thighs and kept the skin on to retain the moisture.  I did use half the butter which was more than adequate, at least when the skin is kept on because of all the chicken fat that is retained that way. I also marinated the chicken in the mixture from morning to late afternoon, when I began to cook it.  It was juicy and flavorful that way.

This was delicious! I was nervous while it was cooking, because it looked so plain. But it was very moist and flavorful and the whole family loved it. The only thing I did different was use boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that's all I had.

Good recipe, I would suggest marinating for an hour before cooking in oven. Definately half the amount of butter and triple the curry. I used bonless chicken breast and cup them up into slices.

I followed the other reviewers and halved the butter but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully- something my husband asks for weekly.  Last time I made it I added a dash of tabasco sauce and it made the dish PERFECT- yum!

This is my first time reviewing - the combination of ease of prep and great taste was fantastic here - took 5 minutes of work for a meal that the entire family loved.  This is going into regular rotation - I also halved the butter.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderfully easy and delicious and easy.  Halfing the butter is a good recomendation and a little bit of garlic salt and cayenne as previously suggested adds the perfect amount of spice.

Delicious! I find that the recipe is not spicy as described though. Maybe some hot pepper flakes to give it a kick? Other than that, hubby loves it. In fact this is the second time I am making it this since  he requsted for it. Yummy!

Oh my gosh! I absolutely loved this and so did my 4 kids. I did take the suggestion of others and used only half the amount of butter, next time I will use even less. I didn't have curry, so I used a near substitution of a mixture of spices. This is a keeper, Thanks!

I made this recipe as stated, and well the end result was good, it was in no way perfect. You should def cover with foil for the first half of cooking (my chicken did not burn, the sauce mixture that rolled off the chicken into the pan burned...) and I did not really taste the honey mixture when I was eating the chicken... it did not penetrate into the meat...

Quite a nice way to do chicken, I did cut the butter in half and marinated the chicken before cooking, but the actual flavours are really good

Wow - this recipe is scrumptious.  I cut some chicken breasts into cubes and didn't need to baste.

I really enjoyed this recipe and my husband thought it was just okay. I liked that it is real simple ingredients and easy to put together. I did follow others advice about putting foil on the top, but I removed it about half way through so the skin could crisp up.

This was such a nice change from my typical asian infused soy sauce based chicken. I really liked this sauce. I marinaded the chicken in half the sauce for a few hours and basted liberally with the rest of the sauce. It was fantastic!I wonder if all that butter was necessary? I think i will reduce the amount next time, maybe to a 1/4 cup.

The chicken was very tender and juicy in this recipe, the honey flavor was different but good, maybe could have used a little more tart flavor to balance it out like a lime juice or even white wine mixed in?

This chicken was very good. I used only a couple of Tbsp of butter and completed with olive oil. I baked covered with foil for 30 minutes and an additional 20 minutes without foil, then I broiled for 2 or 3 minutes just to get some color.

I made two chicken dishes last night, this was good, I think I didn't add enough curry.  I will make this again with more curry.  I also made "Bou's Chicken" and it was a 5 star.

I made this the other night using boneless chicken thighs and it was wonderful! The sauce has just the right amount of kick to it from the curry powder. My husband is allergic to dairy so I did not include the melted butter and it still turned out great! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I marinaded the chicken in the fridge overnite and popped in the oven the next evening.  I kept the chicken covered for the first 60 min. and then uncovered for the remaining 15 min.  It was excellent over whole wheat rice with carrots & peas.  I'll definately make this again!

Average rating from our family would be a 4.  I thought it was good. Don't know what I really expected of it.  I used Coarse Ground Mustard and a little less butter than it called for.  There was WAY too much sauce, I only poured half over the chicken and still only basted with what was in the pan. I used boneless/skinless breasts and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick.  They were cooked in 30 minutes or less. Next time I try this, I will maybe use another mustard to see if I prefer it.  My picky eater ate some, My hard to please eater LOVED it and went back for 2nds, my husband enjoyed it as well. We served with rice and I actually used a tad of the pan sauce over the rice.

SOOOO good. The sauce is so yummy I would make more! And shred the chicken and pour it all over each bite.   *I liked to add a little more curry, Daniel was fine with out it though  Made this with rice, and parsley potatoes, and everything was great.

This was really, really good!  I made the recipe exactly how it was written.  However, if I make it again I will cut the butter in half.  My picky one even went back for seconds.  I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

The chicken was tender and the color was nice, my five year old like it a lot.  I like sweet food but I thought this was a bit too sweet.  I will make this again but I'll try reducing the amount of honey next time.

I was so excited to try this recipe, but somewhat disappointed with the results.  It looked marvelous and smelled even better, but we found the taste very bland (even though I salt-and-peppered the chicken first), and as everyone says, way too much butter.  I also felt it needed some fresh herbs - parsley or rosemary or something - not sure yet.  Next time I will add way less butter and a bit of sriracha hot sauce to taste, and maybe use a mustard with more bite.  But all in all, a great base recipe, so my 4 stars are for potential!

This recipe is AMAZING. Instead of using a whole chicken I used 4 pieces of chicken breast and put it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high. My son doesnt eat chicken and he ate every bite of this!

This was so great and so easy to make. I used 3 extremely large boneless skinless chicken breasts and didnt use the curry simply because I didnt have any and it turned out good. Next time I wont use the sauce for gravy on our rice, with it on our chicken and our rice the flavor was overpowering. oh and I used 2 tbsp of butter as well.

Very good and easy.  A definite weeknight dinner keeper.  The only thing I changed was reducing the amount butter to half. Thanks!

I used chicken thighs and cut the butter in half.  Loved the way it turned out.  I will be making this again!

Really delicous dish.  Small change I made was to cook the chicken covered with aluminum foil for the first 45 minutes then uncovered for the rest.  It was a big hit for dinner with the whole family.

I followed the recipe exactly and everyone raved about it. Next time I think I will try using a little less curry because it isn't my favorite flavor. It was a little bit on the salty side to me, which would have been fine if I had served it over rice. It does brown very nicely.

I gave this recipe 5 stars for several reasons.  Next week is grocery shopping week so I was going off less than normal.  First let me say that I was elated that I had everything already in my pantry to make this.  Another reason I rated it so highly was because it was soo easy.  Literally I dumped the few required ingredients in a bowl, mixed them, and poured them over the chicken.  The basting every 15 minutes was fine to me.  It didnt take more then 1 minute to open the oven and baste the chicken with the drippings.  It was ready as the recipe called for in 75 minutes.  The flavor was good and the meat was juicy and tender.  Let me just say that is isnt spicy as described here.  Which didnt bother me, I knew from looking at the ingredients that it wouldnt be spicy.  I cant believe I hadnt tried this recipe until now. I will be sharing this with my neighbors.  Thanks

This recipe is fantastic!  It's so simple yet tasty.  As others suggested, I reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp.  I use boneless, skinless chicken breast cut up in bite-size pieces and cook it in the sauce on the stovetop for a quick and easy dinner.  My family all loves it.

one word: yum. Keep in mind, though, it is very rich: I think too much sauce for the amount of chicken. I think I will cut in half the amount of butter next time, as the chicken swims in sauce while baking. If anyone has any idea of how to get the pan clean afterward, let me know!

I loved it and shared it with all my friends. Discovered...to make it even more tastier put more of everything in. Also, the longer you leave it in the oven the softer the chicken is.

I've been making this dish for a year or so now.  It is a family favorite!  It's so easy and uses so few ingredients!  It comes out perfect every single time.  I make absolutely no adjustments as it needs no improvements at all!  It's so sweet and savory and the skin is perfectly crispy!  This is the first review I've ever done and I've been using this site for years.  I guess that says something!!

Ok so years later I am STILL making this dish.  So easy and so good.  Some risotto or couscous and some veggies and such an easy delicious meal.  I have, however, changed to a lower fat diet and I found all I have to do is reduce the butter - even significantly, and its JUST as good.    I substitute a little olive oil and you'd never know the difference.  This has been a keeper for years.

Chicken turned out very tender. Great paired with rice to use the extra sauce. Followed what others did and halfed the butter, increased the curry and covered with foil. Delicious!

I didn't bake this, but instead sauteed small chunks of chicken breast in a pan w/ a little olive oil & butter.  Then I added the sauce ingredients (halved it bc used about 1.5 lbs chicken).  Interesting flavor combos, but thought the sauce was too sweet - a bit overwhelming.  I even added extra curry and garlic powder to tone down the sweetness, but still found it too sweet.

This is one of the best recipes I've used on this site.  I've made this three times, sometimes putting in more curry or more honey,and usually with less butter, but it always turns out great!  When I have leftover juice from the cooking dish, I've mixed it with some rice and it makes it delicious!

I didn't really measure the honey or the mustard, and used only a quarter cup of margarine (as suggested in the other reviews).

Very flavorful chicken.  I am not a curry fan but it was a subtle flavor in this dish.  The family says to add it to the menu rotation.  I served it with egg noodles.

Great. I did change some things...only used 1/4 cup butter, no curry, added a few teaspoons of mayo, added some A1 Steak Sauce.  Cooked covered for 30 minutes & uncovered for the rest.  Also broiled for a few minutes at the end to get crispy.  These were very juicy & were full of flavor.

This is my new favorite chicken recipe.  I did change the recipe a little.  Instead of using a whole chicken I cut up boneless chicken breast into cubes and cooked everything together in a skillet until the chicken was cooked through.  I am looking forward to making this dish again.  Definitely one to try!!

Wow was this excellent.
I would cook it a little higher next time (375F). I took some other people's advice and cut the butter portion in half, and covered the chicken for the first 30min, then the last 40min i left it uncovered.
However, no complaints. It turned out just great.

I am new to cooking, and I found this recipe very easy to follow. This was so delicious and I am going to eat it once every week or two!! I used horseradish mustard because that is all I had. I will not change that because it added to the flavor wonderfully.

this came out awesome! it was a hit.
i'm doing 4 stars because it came out a little dry (even though i did the foil wrap option). next time i leave it in for a little less time to help with the jucieness factor.

The chicken I used is 4.5 lb and the flavor turns out wonderful though I doubled the curry.  I took the other's advice and cover the chicken for the first 45 minutes of baking.  My children and husband love this chicken.

This is a very easy way to spruce up baked chicken.  I would, however, reduce the amount of butter used here.  I used less butter than listed in the recipe and even so, it was very buttery.  Also, you don't need to add salt (assuming your butter is salted).  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs so reduced the baking time by about 15-20 minutes or so.  Next time I'll use this with skin-on chicken - I know it will brown and carmelize nicely.

Halved the butter as suggested by so many others and this was delicious.  Next time I will put marinated chicken on baking tray instead of in a lasagna pan and would keep marinade to the side to baste chicken while cooking.  I would reduce what was left to use as as a glaze, the flavor is so good you just want more!

My man made this for me last night and it was fantastic...totally recommend using wholegrain mustard for this, gives it a gorgeous colour and the grains add a little something, he also added the cayanne pepper and that worked as treat too!! Good job honey...awesome recipe!

I made this exactly as directed and am glad I did. I won't be changing anything next time either.  I was thinking there would be too much mustard in it but it was very nice. My hubby that does not like curry loved this recipe as did the whole family.  I believe we will be eating this often!!!!  Thanks.

This is the second time in one week I am making this recipe, it is so easy and so much better than plaim old boring chicken.  I followed the recipe except I used legs and thighs and covered the chicken for half the time to prevent burning.

This was a really yummy marinade that both my boyfriend and I enjoyed. I followed it pretty much to a T, but instead of a whole chicken, I used about 2 lbs of boneless/skinless chicken breast that I cut into pieces, and I cooked it my own way. I forked holes in each piece and coated them with the marinade in a glass pan. After I refrigerated it for an hour or 2, I cooked them in a pan w/olive oil and some black pepper, didn't take long at all to cook through and give them a golden color. They turned out to be these really tasty honey mustard medallions w/a hint of curry flavor. I'll make it again.

I've made this both ways - with the skin on chicken and with skinless chicken breasts.  It doesn't matter, this chicken is delicious.  Very few leftovers that don't last long at my house!

This was okay. I found it a bit soupy. If I did make it again I would add flour to make the sauce stick better to the chicken. Other than that my husband liked it.

This was the best chicken we've had in a long time! I did add a little garlic and marinated the chicken for several hours in sauce. Then I grilled it basting every few minutes. It was so tender and flavorful. Not to mention, it looked fabulous!

My chicken skin didn't get crispy, so it was sort of slimy.  The flavor of the sauce is good, but almost too sweet!

Very good. Was told to put this on the permanent rotation! Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, way less butter (actually used benecol), upped the curry. shook in a little onion and garlic powder and a dash of cayenne. Mixed the honey and the rest of the mixture right in my casserole dish. Didn't have too much time so put the oven up to 400 degrees - 15 minutes covered with foil and then 15 minutes uncovered. My basting was just flipping the chicken after the first 15 minutes. Served it with basmati rice and a mixture of veggies. Super easy and super good.

This was delicious! I altered the recipe based on other reviewers' comments, using 1/2c honey, 1/3c mustard & 1/4c butter, no salt, 2t curry powder and 1t cayenne powder. I turned chicken ~3 times, keeping the dish covered for the first 30 minutes. Next time I'd bake it for a little less time so the chicken stays more moist. Served over basmati rice is perfect!

This was great! My family loved it! I cooked it almost according to the recipe.  I accidently used only 1/4 C of honey instead of 1/2 C and used Madras Curry Powder since I had it on hand.

This came out better than I expected. I tasted the marinade before pouring it over the chicken and I wasn't sure if it would come out good. It was very easy and quick to make...only marinated it for about an hour. My boyfriend really enjoyed it and he hates curry! (I didn't tell him there was curry in it though.)

This chicken was okay, but it obviously has a strong mustard flavor so beware of that for those picky eaters. It was very moist and pairs great with rice and you do not taste the curry at all.

Me and my husband both thought it was okay. It was good, but just not extremely wonderful. There was too much sauce and it was pretty runny (maybe because of too much butter, like alot of the reviews have said).

Great recipe with wonderful flavor for few ingredients. However, way to much butter. Half the butter called for, and the recipe is five stars.

This is really good!  One of my hubbies favs!  I substitute chicken thighs w/ skin instead of the breasts b/c I just prefer dark meat.  Make a little extra sauce and serve over rice.  Yummy!

Very tasty. Didn't have enough honey, so substituted a bit of light corn syrup. I used drums and they came out sticky, sweet and moist. Will make again.

Very easy and good. I did cover the chicken with tin foil until the last 15 - 20 minutes...then removed it for crispy skin. Served it with basmati rice.

TIP: You must marinate to get the full depth of flavor!  
I loved this chicken! It has great flavor and my fiance couldn't get enough of it. I followed the suggestions of the other members and this chicken could not have been any better!

I would have liked a way to thicken this sauce a little more.  It wasn't really anything specutular.  I might try making this again with drumsticks instead of skinless boneless chicken.

This was terrific, and super easy. Just put foil on it and go. About 5 minutes of prep and some really excellent chicken.

I covered the chicken for the first hour, then baked at 400 for 20 minutes.  My family rated this meal just so-so and did not want me to make it again.

The sauce was very good. The basting every 15 minutes is a critical step in this recipe as the end result is a beautiful honey brown color. I only had chicken breast with the bone, but I think you would get more of an intense flavor if you used boneless chicken breasts, if you are only a white meat eater. Thanks for Sharing

This recipe was great, I made it for my husband last night and he loved it to.  The cook time was great, prep time was great the meal was great.  The only thing was clean up was a little of a pain...lol...  The next time I think I may back some personal variations.

This recipe is delicious! It is so quick and easy to do and I love the fact that you can bake it in the oven.

We have it with either couscous or steamed rice and vegetables. So simple yet so tasty!

This makes it into my March Menu! Notes: If I make this again I will use only 1/3 cup butter. I will increase the mustard to 1/3 cup and use a sweet hot mustard. I will increase the curry to 1.5-2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of hot sauce. These are our personal preferences as a family. We like everything to have a bit of a kick to it.  Also, since my oven is on the fritz, I baked this for only 25 minutes in my Advantium 240 at 7, 4 & 2. (If you don't know what an Advantium is email me and I will tell you, or look it up on the web.)I would hate to be without mine. I have to watch it more carefully as the skin blackened some. Next time the upper lights can be turned down to about 4-5. Although, the breasts I cooked were HUGE. They were bone-in and over a pound each. Smaller breasts would clearly cook in a shorter time in the Advantium. Maybe 20 minutes. Either way, I can't complain about a yummy chicken and rice dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent chicken dish! As other reviewers noted, I also added chili powder and increased the curry powder. I used chicken thighs, but will try making it with chicken breasts next time. Would be great with basmati rice and naan flat bread (recipes on this site).

I made this chicken for dinner on Valentines.  It was fabulous!!!  I took a few of the reviewers tips and only used 1/4 cup butter, I can't imagine using 1/2 cup, it would be too watery and greasy.  I also added 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 minced clove of garlic.  I used 1 1/2 tsps of curry powder, not just 1 tsp.  Instead of a whole chicken I would recommend using chicken breasts and I would suggest marinating the chicken in the mix over night.  I did this and when we ate, all the seasonings seemed to permeate the the chicken making it VERY moist and we could taste all the wonderful flavors throughout.  I cooked the chicken covered for 35 minutes and then uncovered for 40 minutes, basting every 10 minutes.  This recipe was a huge hit with my Valentine, he loved it and asked me to make it again for him!  Thank you Gretchen Ramey, you helped to make my Valentines dinner truly special.

This was good. Per suggestions of other reviewers, I cut the butter back to 1/4 cup. I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also doubled the amt of curry (I love curry). I threw in a dash of ceyenne pepper. I also sliced about a half of a white onion up and placed the slices on top of the chicken. I used a leave-in meat thermometer and the chicken got to 165 degrees in a half hour, while covered. At this point I uncovered and baked for about 15 minutes longer. Next time I will reduce the amt of honey, as it was a bit too strong of a flavor. I think I will also increase the amt of ground red pepper and maybe add a few other spices.

I LOVE this recipe!  It's so easy and delicous.  I added some cayenne pepper and more curry powder than the recipe calls for.  I also used half dijon mustard and half regular mustard.  Served with rice and peas - I'll definitely make it again and again!

Great base recipe... made a few alterations and everyone asked for the recipe! Used 7lbs of boneless/skinless chicken breast cut up in bite sized pieces, used only a few Tbsp of butter, added a Tbsp of country dijon mustard, 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, 2 minced cloves of garlic, and a bit of garlic salt.  Only baked it for 40 minutes and it was done! Left the foil on for the whole cooking time.  Served with brown rice, was a nice complement b/c it soaked up the flavorful juices. The juices were really runny-- my chicken was in a pool of juices. Next time, I will try mixing a little cornstarch or flour with the juices in a saucepan to thicken it up. I noticed in the leftovers the juices thickened up just from sitting, so you might want to make it the day before.

I thought this was really good.  Not knock your socks off good, but tasty and will make it again.  I wish the sauce would have been a bit thicker, didn't stick to the chicken breasts like I wanted it to.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe. I used breasts instead of thighs...maybe that where it went wrong.  The sauce was soupy but pretty tasty though.

This was good but, i will definitely marinate the chicken breasts.  It was a bit bland.  And I also didn't add the curry....I forgot it.  I will try to make it again with the curry and marinating the chicken overnight.  Other than that it was a good recipe and worth trying again.

Absolutely delicious chicken.  My family loves this recipe, and I like to thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry and serve it over Basmati rice!  Have made this over and over.  I usually use either 1/4 chicken legs or chicken thighs, since we love dark meat chicken.
Thank you for this delicious recipe.

GREAT!  I love this recipe! Too bad it is so high in fat and calories. We only make it a couple of times a year because of how fatty it is but when we have it it sure is a treat!! I serve over rice or noodles.

This was delicous and easy! I added a 1/2 tsp more curry seasoning and 1 clove of garlic like prior reviews suggested. My husband loved this, too. I will be making this again soon.

I've tried this recipe 3 times, and each time it's been great. I followed some of the modifications of others: 1/4 cup of butter (I can't imagine how oily 1/2 cup would make it because it's already a calorie-loaded dish), a dash more curry, a little cayenne pepper (1/8 tbsp), and some garlic. At first I was a little afraid of how it would look once its cooked because in some pics the chicken still looked uncooked, but after an hour I take the foil off the top and brown it for about 30 mins, and it comes out a beautiful golden brown.

I've made this recipe twice so far and both times it has come out fantastic.  Instead of using a whole chicken I used about 3 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and baked for about 1 1/4 hours.  Yummy!  Next time I'll cut the butter by half.

This was delicious...I am a huge fan of sweet/savory combos and this hits the spot.  DH and I thought it tasted liek something you would get at a nice family restaraunt.  I used boneless chicken breast instead of chicken pieces and cooked it with the sauce in a lidded skillet.  The sauce was amazing over jasmine rice.

This is an excellent recipe. Done right (and it's hard to mess it up) the chicken is so juicy and tasty. The second time I made I tried the juice from one basic juice orange and the results were equally pleasing. It has bvecome a regular favorite in our house.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my 2 yr old daughter. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and baked it uncovered for the last 20 minutes but it was a little too soggy for me.  Wonderful flavor though! Thanks for the great idea

This was delicious and easy to put together. It was tangy and very tender. I followed suit and covered it for the first 40 minutes and then baked uncovered for the last 20 minutes basting every so often, that's why I rated it a 4.

I have never seen my children put away chicken like they did for this recipe. Personally, I thought it tasted a little salty. Not sure why, I even used unsalted butter.  But super easy. I had it together before the oven was even done pre-heating. The honey-mustard sauce was good over steamed rice.

I wanted to make something different for New Years so I opted for this. My daughter loved it and begged me to pleeeze keep it in the menu. The only thing I'll change is not use so much curry powder next time as I'm not a a real lover of curry powder.

Excellent recipe- easy to prepare and definitely good! My husband even went back for seconds and he's a picky eater! I used country Dijon mustard and accidentally used half a cup instead of a quarter, but it was EXCELLENT and I don't mind the mistake. ;)

the recipe was one of the easiest dishes  to make by far. i used coarse mustard (the seedy one) in the recipe, and chicken thighs. i agree with covering the dish while baking in the oven.

real great sauce, only problem I had was getting it to soak into the chicken. Other than that, great easy recipe for single guys like myself that want somthing good but isn't real difficult to prepare and leaves only a few dishes to clean.

Used chicken thighs for this, and it was a huge hit!  I made it just as directed, except I added a couple of teaspoons of stone-ground mustard, and a little extra curry.  My family loved it.  I was full after two thighs but really really wanted to keep eating!!!

I wish that I could give this 3 1/2 stars because it wasn't bad but it's not as great as most of the reviews are saying. My husband liked it, but I wasn't blown away. I'll probably make it again at some point because it's so easy.

I made this last night for my family and they gave it two thumbs up. I love the mustard, honey, and curry flavors together, none of which alone are ingredients that my family would care to have in a recipe. But this one worked for them! I did follow one other reviewer's suggestion of covering the dish in foil for the first 30 minutes of baking and the chicken came out beautifully. Thanks!

WOW what a taste. I will make it again, however next time I may cut the mustard just a little. I did use spicy mustard and added just a dash of garlic. My husband really liked it and so did my boys (and that says a lot). Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a good recipe. The cooking time given is too long though. My oven is gas and is also very accurate as most People's ovens are not. So be careful with your cooking time. Get an oven thermometer at the store! They are cheap! The only changes I made to this recipe was to simmer the honey mixture for a few minutes before putting on the chicken. I used legs and even with opening the door every 15 minutes, they were done in 45. I will be using this recipe for a whole stuffed and roasted chicken soon possibly with some sage added to it. It needs a bit more salt or some other spice. I can't put my finger on what it is though. Otherwise I would have given it a 5.

This was really good! I minced a few cloves of garlic and cut up some onions like someone else recommended, but I took some of the butter mixture and sauted the onions with it. I used this as a sauce to put on top of the chicken once it was done. I used a white onion and it was very sweet and went along with the honey mustard flavor very well.

Okay, YUM!  Did the thing where you cut the backbone out of a whole chicken and flatten it out for this recipe.  Worked great and pretty easy.  I didn't baste as often as recipe says but it still turned out great and my husband RAVED about it!  Definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly except for a few suggestions. My it is just my taste buds, but it was just okay. I probably wont make it again just because if its not great, I wont put it in family favorites. It is creative though!

Outstanding, a very different, mild  taste for chicken.  (I cook a lot of chicken and my husband and kids enjoyed the new recipe!) We will make this again for sure.

Made this last night and it was wonderful. The chicken was moist and the taste was great. Next time I would probably add some spicy mustard to give it a kick. But we enjoyed it and I will make it again.

I really liked it and my 2 year old daughter said 'Mommy, you made a GREAT dinner.'  That pushed it from a 4 to a 4 1/2 for me. I followed others advice, less butter and covered until last 20 minutes.

This is good but VERY fatty!  I used half of the butter and chicken thighs and felt like they were swimming in grease.  Flavor is yummy- very very sweet.

I also used Dijon mustard for this recipe. It was so simple. I used chicken legs because it was all I had on hand. I flipped them every 15 minutes and cooked it uncovered. I will make these again for sure.

This was quite tasty! I didn't have curry (thought I did) so instead used 1 tsp of paprika and about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Also did the chopped garlic but used about four cloves. I also made the sauce for two people and had bought four chicken breasts. I baked it w/o foil and it was perfect. The sauce kind of crusted on the top.My husband's opinion? "Mmmmmm! This chicken is so good!" I have to agree!

Delicious and juicy.  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  Still basted every 15 minutes.  The marinate browns to a beautiful color.  Served this with scoured potatoes and snow peas.  Delicious meal!!

Amazing!  I was a bit skeptical about this recipe because of the curry (and the mix of the other ingediants too).  I made this recipe with slight variation and it turned out wonderful.  I used chicken thighs and dijon mustard.  Otherwise, everything else was the same.  My husband said it was better than restaurant quality!

Yummy!  This chicken came out fantastic!  I used wings/drumsticks.  I just put everything into a casserole dish and baked it for an hour and the chicken was so tender.  I upped the curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp and decreased the butter to 1/4 cup.  Also added a tsp minced onion.

We loved this one. I did cut the butter as suggested by other reviewers, I added more curry to the mixture too. I made sure to cover the chicken for the first hour & turn up the heat to 400 & bake uncovered for the last 30 minutes. I basted the chicken every 10 minutes once uncovered. Came out yummy! I paired it with an herbed rice pilaf & asparagus recipe I found on here.

This was very good. There is a ton of butter when the chicken is done cooking. It makes for a good saucd over rice but just use lightly. I added garlic when mixing the sauce to pour over the chicken. Three year old liked it as well!

I thought curry, mustard and honey would taste weird together - but it was a hit in our house - I would definitely make again.  PS I used chicken legs instead of a whole cut up chicken

V-e-r-y G-o-o-d!! I didn't have quite enough butter, but it was apparently okay, as we did not miss it (or need it). I will probably increase the curry next time for our tastes. I used skinned boneless chicken thighs that I had on hand. Leftovers were equally as good! I will use this for pork, as well.

This was pretty good. I also cut the butter in half.  I think it would benefit greatly from garlic and onion and some marination.  I might try it again.

I tried this with 3 lbs. chicken thighs and it was delish!  I also cut the butter to 1/4 cup but my husband complained so I might try it with the 1/2 cup next time...or I won't tell him! :) My daughters are not fans of curry at all but they adored this recipe! This will be a permanent dish in my home.

This is a great and simple recipe. I used less butter- 2 or 3 T and since there are only 2 of us, I made 2 chicken breasts. I should have cooked it for less time. I cooked in 40 minutes and the chicken was very dry. I am sure it is b/c there was a lot less to cook and it was boneless, skinless. Next time will do 30 minutes or less.

Sorry, no one in my family liked this chicken dish...I followed the receipe, mixed the ingredients in an oven bag, added two small packages of chicken wings and baked it...they complained it just didnt smell good and they didnt like the taste either.  I dont know if it was the mustard or the curry they didnt like, but they asked me not to waste my time on this recipe again...sorry

I thought this was awesom! I did make a few changes, I used 1/2 the butter,(unsalted) added a little more brown spicy mustard, for the honey I used "star thistle" honey, a dark rich honey! I reduced the sauce after cooking the chicken and used it as a dipping sauce.  Talk about good..  thank you for the great post!!

Got a whole chicken and cut it up (difficult - I'll need to brush up on the technique on the site). Came out VERY well - son gave it a 4.5 - loved it! Will do again. Should have put foil over the pieces for a period as stated by someone else - came out a little too baked. 2nd attempt - used 1/2 butter called for - was more than enough. Used foil for 1st 30 min, took it off and basted every 15 min for next 45 min. Came out perfect. Might suggest - if people do not eat the skin, (health concerns), than skinless breasts might be better because all the good sauce/flavor is on the skin - remove the skin on the plate and you lose the majority of this great sauce's flavour. Might even poke holes in the meat prior to cooking to allow the sauce to seep into the flesh.

I used this on boneless pork chops. Next time I will marinate them a while before putting them in the oven. I also added a bit of garlic to spice it up a bit. very good with rice.

This was very, very good!! I used chicken wings I had on hand, and followed the recipe exactly. Probably didn't need that much butter though. I left it in the oven longer than was supposed to be, and the sauce was dark and thick and sticky when I took it out. Yummy!!! I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!!

Yum, yum! You may want to cut back on the butter to make it a bit healthier, though.

This recipe was a good weeknight recipe. I also cut back on the butter by half but I probably could have cut it back even more. I don't eat the skin of chicken so I should have taken the skin off before baking. It would have made it more flavorful. I ended up removing the oil from the sauce after baking, then thickening it with a little cornstarch. Makes a nice sauce.

I have made this several times and it is a big hit. My husband loves it! I always use dijon mustard and skinless chicken breasts, so it doesn't get nice and brown,but still tastes yummy.

I just made this and even though the marinade tastes amazing, the chicken had no taste. I made thighs with its skin and next time will definitely make them skinless and will leave the chicken marinating for a few hours. I cut the butter to 1/4c and used 2 tsp. of curry

This was very good.  I also added some saffron disoved on hot water to give it more flavor (not that it lacked any!) It was wonderful and really easy to make. I also took the suggestion from another reviwer and cooked covered for 30 min and uncover for 40.  I broild the chicken for 2 min. to get the nice brown color. Very yummy!

Excellent Recipe!! I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks and quadrupled the measurements. It worked well. I baked it covered since I knew that it would have to be reheated before dinner. When it was time for it to be reheated I took it out of the sauce, reheated the chicken uncovered on cookie sheets then put it back in the sauce to warm and serve.

Delicioius.  It was a great suggestion to cover with foil for the first hour, and then at 400, remove the foil and baste every 15 min.

Very nice, If you cook in a small but deep pan you should have some sauce still in the pan when you are done.  The sauce is tastey and can be used as gravy.

Incredible flavor! I've made this a few times now with a variety of fresh roasted vegetables. It always turns out perfect. As other reviewers have suggested, reducing the butter is just fine and doesn't affect the flavor at all. My husband gets excited for dinner when he knows I'm going to make this. I would recommend this recipe to anyone and would happily to serve it to guests!

Excellent! I took others suggestions, halfing the butter, using fancy mustard, upping the curry and adding a garlic clove. I use boneless chicken breasts and serve with chicken fried rice and fresh veggies. One of my husband's favorites!

The chicken was delicious!  Instead of the butter I used 1/4 cup olive oil.  Also, I removed the foil only the last 15 minutes.  It's even more tasty the next day.

I baked the chicken whole and covered it with foil during the last half of the cooking because the skin began to get too dark.  The glaze was delicious!  We all loved the curry flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good chicken. Juicy and sweet. We had Easy Indian Style Okra as a side dish - worked great.

Yum! The balance of honey and mustard is perhaps a tad on the sweet side, but the consistency is perfect. I like the curry addition too.

Though this recipe tasted good....It turned out to be a disaster.....The butter and honey combination was aweful in the oven....It burned really bad and had very smoke alarm going off in my house.  So if you want to try this recipe I wouldn't bake it in the oven.

This recipe was delicious. I made a few changes like others suggested.  I decreased the butter to 1/4c and added pepper and garlic powder.  I used chicken thighs and baked them at 400d for 40min like another user suggested.  They were great.  This is definitely a keeper.

I found this recipe yesterday and used it last night to cook some boneless chicken thighs! It was excellent! I liked the taste and how easy it was to make.  The sauce is pretty thin.  But it was great to serve over rice.  But I did follow the one person's advice about changing the cooking time and temp to 400 degrees for 40 minutes. It came out perfect...didn't even need a knife to cut the meat! I did not use curry because I don't have any and don't really like it. I used garlic and cinnamon as well! I thought cinnamon would go well with the honey.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I used 2 split bone-in chicken breasts and halved the butter.  My husband also agreed it was a keeper!  My 5-year-old who eats only chicken "nugget-style" couldn't keep her hands off of my plate!

Oh so good.  I use thighs cut into small pieces.  I add 1-2 cloves garlic to the mixture and when there's 20 min or so left, I add potatoes and carrots.  I serve it over a bed of rice.

Wonderful flavor but because of the high sugar content the glaze burned a bit too much for my taste. Next time I will bake it at 300 covered with foil, then take the foil off at the end. I did not have curry so made my own with plenty of paprika, garlic, pepper, tumeric and cumin. Serve with rice and a salad with a lemon oil dressing - the fresh tart flavor went so well with the carmel sweet spice.

Awesome!  Like others suggested, I cut the butter in half and doubled the curry.  I skinless chicken thighs at 375 for approx. 60 minutes.  Delicious and definitely a keeper!

I thought it was very plain and family did not like either. I don't know if it was something I did or just the recipe? The only change I made was I used boneless breasts in place of the bone in chicken and halfed the butter. Maybe will try again exactly how it says.

Not sure that I can give this an accurate review since I realized at the last second that I didn't have curry. Oh well I went ahead and made it anyway using half the amt of butter, thighs and legs and added some seasoned salt. I also lined the pan with foil because I hate clean up. So, although I didn't think it was the best my husband complimented me on it, he even ate the skin which has been a no no in this house for a while. Oh well he was happy:) Thanks for the recipe. Maybe will make again with some curry.

The chicken turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I bet it would still be as good with slightly less butter. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the curry as he is so picky and he LOVED it. Thanks.

This was so delicious.  We just really loved it.  My kids didn't even put ketchup on it! Didn't have curry, used garlic pepper.  These were some great flavors.  I stopped going to the store for chicken and started going to a butcher where I buy free range, antibiotic and hormone free chicken.  If you have a chance to go to a butcher do it.  We can really taste the difference.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a definate keeper.

This recipe has become a staple meal at our house!  I usually use boneless, skinless thighs. I never "babysit" it- I don't take time to turn or baste.   I really like to marinade the chicken with this recipe and put it on the grill.  It is AMAZING!

I've made this dish several times and it's always great! I sometimes use the frozen chicken breasts and will follow the cook time on the package and it turns out fabulous!

I made this recipe last night for my family. I cut out the curry (I hate curry) I also ran out of Honey so I used half honey half carol syrup. I added lightly salt and peppered the chicked and added Mrs.dash before covering it in the mixture. I am so glad I did. it was bursting of flavor. It came out really delicious. My family loved it. this is a keeper. YUM!!!

We are planning to be our own caterers for our wedding and are looking for recipes that are tasty, easy, quick and can be adapted to feed a crowd.  We used thighs and legs and it turned out really well. Hope our guests like it.

I cook that recipe once a week. I use chicken quarters and customize the recipe for 2 servings. The house smells great and  my wife loves it. Cook at 400 degree instead of 350 and 1 hour only. mmmmmm.

We LOVE this recipe!  It makes the whole house smell wonderful all night!  My husband can't get enough, and both my 3 year old and 2 year old eat it great.  And it's so easy!  We love it!  We like it best with dark meat (usually drumsticks.)

Yum....  husband really liked this - even went back for seconds - I wanted it for lunch the next day but it was all gone!!  Will make again!  Oh, I did cut the butter amount in half though due to other suggestions on here.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs with skin and bones instead of a whole chicken, dijon mustard and cut the butter in half. My family kept asking when it would be ready because it smelled so good while baking - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for sharing.

This chicken looked so good. I used half the amount of butter. Which I am glad I did or it would have been too greasy! I also baked at 400 for an hour. Very moist. However; it was not for us. I will try it again with wings and add lots of garlic and put in the slow cooker.I used a 8 by 12 pyrex and the clean uop was easy. I love pyrex!

I was kind of hesitant to try this recipe but it turned out really good! Like another reviewer, I cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts and put them in a small dish.  The sauce never carmelized, but it was still good.  I served the sauce over white rice and made salad to serve on the side.  My whole family enjoyed this, which doesn't happen all that often.

This was very tasty, I used deli dijon mustard instead because I was worried the prepared mustard would make it to "mustardy", used chicken thighs and I baked it at 400 for a little over an hour, I turned them once, and there was definately enough sauce. My three kids, partner, and roomate all had seconds and I only have 2 pieces left out of 14, it goes great with jasmine rice and fresh green beans. I will definately be making this again.

This was a very easy dish to make.  Only qualm was that sauce was too thin, could use a little corn starch to thicken it.  I used sliced shicken thighs and served over rice, pretty good.  Husband (who likes spicy) added sriracha on top for a kick.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had more than 3 lbs. of chicken on hand (probably closer to 5), but decided against increasing the amount of sauce since it sounded so rich.  I'm glad I did because the amount worked, and this is a meal that really leaves you feeling heavy.  Be sure to follow the instructions of basting the chicken because it helps in yielding chicken that comes out extremely tender and juicy.

Was looking for something different....but easy, and this is it!  I did make a few changes, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I halfed them, I didn't alter any of the other ingredients though.  I also cooked mine in a cast iron skillet and it browned nicely on 400 degrees for about an hour.  The only change I would make next time would be definitely half the butter to 1/4 cup, not only because of the fat content, but it was just too much for 4 chicken breasts.  It was very, very tender, a great flavor combination & like everyone else said....your entire house smells wonderful.  Even my 9 year old couldn't wait for supper!

This is a great recipe.  My family loves this.  I also use this sauce on chicken wings which are great appetizers.  I use extra curry powder and cut the butter a little to help cut the fat.

Pretty good. My room mate loved it - made funny mmm-mmm noises the whole time she was eating. It didn't take 75 minutes to cook though; more like 60 and that was more than enough. Can't be too careful with chicken though lol.

We really liked this recipe. There wasn't a piece of chicken left! I made a couple of small changes. I accidentally used twice as much mustard as called for and intentionally added 1/2 tsp. each paprika and black pepper and a heaping TBSP of minced garlic. Leaving the curry out of this recipe would be a HUGE mistake.

This was just wonderful!  The flavor was so nice. For those afraid of the curry, don't worry, it adds an interesting yet very mild flavor.  It wouldn't be the same without it.  instead of basting the chicken I turned it over as suggested by other reviewers.  Turns out well every time, a keeper for sure!

This recipe was easy and wonderful tasting! I used a Whole Grain Mustard with Garlic (because that's what I had) and it was great. The whole grains added texture to the sauce that made it look really nice. I didn't change any of the amounts and the taste was great. Also I put it all in a pan that was just big enough for the chicken and there was enough sauce to cover 3/4 of the chicken, and I only basted a few times and it was still tender and juicy.

I thought this was good but my husband wasn't too wowed.  The chicken came out nice and tender with a nice flavor throughout.  I turned the chicken rather than basting it.

Nice contrast of sweet and spicy. I used chicken with skins removed, and half of the butter to reduce the fat.
