I added one cup of (drained and patted dry) freeze dried blueberries that I soaked in hot, unsweetened chai. The oats I used were "cinnamon roll" flavored. I've made oatmeal muffins before so I knew to let the batter rest for 15 minutes to give the oats time to soak up some of the liquid and expand. I baked my muffins at 350* for just about 22 minutes. Everyone liked these, even my muffin-picky husband. They turned out fluffy, moist and chewy. Very good muffin. NOTE: If you don't use flavored instant oats, I suggest you add some kind of a flavoring or spice, otherwise these might turn out a little bland.

I changed this a bit - 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c oil, 1/4 c applesauce and about 1/2 t cinnamon.  My kids ate it for breakfast and after dinner for dessert.  I made a loaf but had to bake it for longer than 20 minutes, more like 30-35.  The oats become so soft that you really can't tell they're there, which was great because my son thinks he doesn't like oatmeal.  I called it "breakfast bread" and I'm about to make a second loaf because the kids want it again for breakfast tomorrow!

Love this! I've been searching for a JUST oatmeal muffin recipe for a long time! I wouldn't change a thing. But the only things I did change, is that I made mini muffins (made 3 dozen exact) and I added 2/3 cup of chopped Almonds! The muffins were very moist and fluffy! I'm defiantly making these again! My family and I all loved them!

This recipe is perfect as is for a basic recipe, I love that. It also lends very well to adding different flavors. I added 2 tsp orange extract and 2/3 cup chopped Craisins just for a twist and they were AMAZING!  Fast and super easy.  I will make this again and again.  It will be fun to try them with choco chips and blueberries, pecans, walnuts, any dries fruit.  The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

Oh so delicious. My boyfriend and I already made it through half the batch. The only addition was 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Definitely a keeper and will be making again and again.

One Saturday morning, I was searching for a quick and easy muffin recipe and this was perfect.  I already had all the ingredients so it really was quick and easy!
I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I also let it sit for about 10 minutes. before baking.  
I made a quick topping out of melted butter, white sugar and brown sugar.  They were great!

Fair, but not as good as the buttermilk oatmeal muffin recipe also found on this site. The wonderful zing from  buttermilk is missing and instant oats don't have the chewy goodness of quick oats. Better recipes are available. On the plus side, this is easy.

Perfect!  But I used just a bit of light EVOO instead of oil, half whole wheat flour and half plain, added pecan meal and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Great for breakfast and to get some fiber in one's diet!

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand for any of my usual muffins and was looking for something I could make from the ingredients in my cupboards.  This fit the bill.  Just as the name implies this is a quick and easy recipe and yummy too!  Only change I made was based on prior reviews.  Since using regular instant oatmeal I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  Might even go a little more next time.  Delicious.

Love this recipe. If you don't have instant flavored oatmeal, quick oats work as well as instant oatmeal. They do leave the recipe a little bland, so I suggest if you do this that you add about 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and maybe 1-2 c raisins depending on your preference. And if you like them a little sweeter, you might want to add a little more sugar. Thank you, DustyMoe for this recipe!!! It's high fiber and the kids LOVE them!!!

As usual I just couldn't leave a recipe alone so I added 2 mashed (very ripe) bananas, 3/4 cup of coconut, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and they were yummy!
I had to shorten the baking time because if I'd followed the instructions they'd have burned.

These are a good basic oatmeal muffin. They are not very big. I literally got exactly 12 muffins, with a #16 scoop, without a teaspoon of batter to spare. There is a quick oatmeal type bread on the site, that I make into muffins, that I actually prefer. I just wanted to try something different. These muffins are not for a person that likes a really sweet muffin. The oil taste I also found slightly prominent. I used safflower oil. Maybe a different type is better suited for this recipe. I also used paper liners and I am glad because it soaked some of it. Other than that I used quick oats, for the oats, and garnished the tops with 5 grain rolled cereal. Keep an eye on these. Mine were done 15-16 minutes, and I baked them on the bottom rack. Edit note: Flavor much better the next day and drier. Made a good, not too sweet, breakfast muffin with coffee.

I tried this in my preschool class with mixed age children a little over 2 years old to 4&1/2.The recipe is easy and simple to make especially when there is only one bowl that you use.I feel this is the perfect recipe to use while baking with kids.
I added cinnamon,I thought that it called for it, and some vanilla to it .I got confused when they said instant oatmeal since you can only buy that in the packets so I bought quick cooking oats(or something like that) and it worked fine. Otherwise you'd have to buy the packets which are much more money and open them to get the amount needed. Quick cooking is probably what was meant or they'd say how many packets like in another recipe. I digress.
They were delicious,maybe a tad too sweet but everyone loved them including our directer who doesn't like the kids to eat things from school that are too sweet.I would definitely make this again,either at home or with the children.

These are really good! Perfect for an on-the-go breakfast, and beats the expensive store-bought alternatives. The only thing I added to the recipe was some maple syrup, and it was delicious. My only complaint about the recipe is that at 400 degrees, my muffins were ready in about 12 minutes! They were actually a tad overdone at that point. Maybe it's just my oven, but I will be sure to take these out around 10 minutes next time!

I added 1/2 cup raisins, probably could have added more.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  My husband loved my additions.

I used this recipe as an inspiration.  Because I used honey, the batter was too liquidy, so I needed more flour and oatmeal.  I still didn't think there was enough batter to fill the muffin pans, so I mixed 2 T cream cheese with 2 T peanut butter, then filled partially batter filled cups with a dab of peanut butter filling, and covered with more batter.  We loved the oatmeal tasting muffins!  The recipe served as quite an inspiration!  Thanks!

I wanted a little something special, so I tweaked the recipe:

1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup corn meal, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour,
1 stick of melted butter (instead of oil),
1/2 cup brown sugar,
1 extra pinch of salt.

These turned out wonderful and extremely moist. I never cook with oil if I can help it. Butter is an absolute staple of baking.

After reading other reviews, I added grated apple, a tad bit of brown sugar and cinnamon.  OMG To die for! Use your imagination to make your own perfect muffin!  Also, these ARE dense...not at all like a cupcake at all. For me this recipe made six large muffins. They come out of the pan like a dream with non-stick spray.

I made these because I've been buying up all of the oatmeal muffins in the bakery by my work and I needed a cheaper alternative. These were meh. They didn't have very much taste to them and they stayed very small even though I put extra in the muffin cups to try getting big muffins. I'm going to keep looking.

Great recipe for a delicious and wholesome treat. I would not change anything. This made a great snack for my kid's lunch. We ate them up so quickly that next time I make these, I will freeze some for quick anytime snacks and to pack in lunches.

So moist! This is such a simple recipe and so good.  I added chocolate chips and it was a huge hit at my work.  If you are looking for a easy recipe to double or even more this is the one. Thank you so much for posting this recipe it is a keeper for sure!

I made these exactly as written and they were super yummy! They are simple and quick to make. I'm sure I will make these again, but add some extra ingredients next time. Chopped nuts, fruit, chocolate chips... Anything you have on hand would be tasty. This is a great and versatile recipe :)
My one complaint is that it did not yield a dozen muffins. I only got 9 muffins out of it.

This recipe is the perfect basic oatmeal muffin recipe to add to and make your own and try new things with. I added a little over a cup of quartered freeze dried cherries, 1 tablespoon each of almond and vanilla extract, a dash of cinnamon and substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce and they came out perfect! They were nice and moist, I did cook them at 350 instead of 400 though because I didn't want them to burn.

Good as basic recipe and made changes to  some of my own preferrences.  I did use instant oatmeal, adding 1 individual package lightly sweetened apple cinnamon oatmeal.  Reduced oil to a little less than 1/2 cup.  Added 1 teaspoon finely grated orange peel and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Also added 1/2 cup frozen blueberries.

I'm not sure what the fuss was about, I was a little hesitant about making these at first. I followed the recipe right down to the T and only added 2tsp of cinnamon as I used regular oats. And they turned out really yummy! Even my picky fiancé really liked them! When I say picky, I mean very picky! I would definitely make again!

These muffins were great, but I have to say they were a little bland, adding some walnuts or applesauce would give them that dash of life.

Easy + Fast = Great (IMHO)
The first time I made these - I made them as per the recipe.  Good!  This morning I made them for my daughter's pre-school but didn't have regular milk, so I used up some almond milk I had.  Good!  I like easy recipes that you can tweak.  Thank you!!

Mine sank a little in the middle; probably my own fault because I added a streusel topping that the recipe didn't call for. The flavor and texture was excellent. A great recipe because these are ingredients I always have on hand. Next time I might add some nuts or sunflowers seeds for a little crunch.

Excellent recipe with changes. The cook time was too long and they were perfectly baked at 16 mins. I substituted applesauce for oil and it is much healthier.   Enjoy!

Great base recipe. Kind of bland if you don't add anything. I used up some packets of instant oatmeal, apple cinnamon flavor, added a tsp of cinnamon and chopped up an apple and threw that in as well. Delicious! Will try a few other variations as well :)

My kids (toddlers) love these muffins! I have made them following the recipe and also following some other reviewers suggestions of adding cinnamon & exchanging oil for applesauce & they are always yummy! Our favorite add in are craisins or diced apple, definitely should try these.

This seems to be a wonderfully versatile recipe! I added one overripe, mashed banana, a pinch of cinnamon and just the tiniest bit of nutmeg to make a light, moist banana oatmeal muffin. I also mixed the oats with the milk and let it stand for 15 minutes before starting the recipe to make sure they were softened, and substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil. Fantastic!

Made some changes-one by mistake!
I used room temperature eggs-always when I bake, buttermilk instead of regular milk--which I accidentally used 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup, added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, plain quick cooking oats rather than instant, and self rising flour instead of all purpose flour.  Because I used self rising flour, I omitted the salt AND baking powder.  I baked at 375 degrees for 22 minutes.  The kitchen smelled awesome! These didn't rise beyond the level of the muffin pan and I'm not sure if it was because of the extra 1/2 buttermilk or self rising flour or both. BUT!!! they are DELICIOUS, tender and extremely moist.  I was worried that they would be gooey with the extra milk, but they are not at all. YUMMMMM Ill be saving this and changing the (butter)milk quantity to 1 cup.  Thanks for sharing!

Definitely quick and easy.  Yummy, too!  Added craisins, orange zest, and cinnamon first time.  Adding raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla for second time.  Made them as mini-muffins like someone else said.  Baked for 13 minutes.

Great, simple recipe for oatmeal muffins that aren't too sweet to eat for breakfast. The simplicity makes it very easy to add nuts, dried fruit, or spices to make a variety of different breakfast treats. I personally like them with half a cup of dried cranberries or a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg.

When I only had 1 egg left - it was easy to cut the recipe in half to make 6 muffins.  The next morning when I made it again, it yieled 12 perfect muffins.  I added flax (1/3 c.), used quick oats, and added cinnamon & ginger (probably 1 tbsp of each) and topped with dried cranberries.  They tasted so good right out of the oven!  I will make this again and again, in total it takes less than an hour to prep, cook & clean up!

The muffins are pretty good and delicious. But, they are also kind of flavorless. I recommend that you add a a little more of sugar. With milk they taste better. I think that this is good for amateur bakers.

I made these following the recipe exactly, the only substitution was a 1:1 ratio of unsweetened applesauce in place of oil. Used Quaker gluten free instant oatmeal and added a mix of semi-sweet and milk Ghirardelli chocolate chips to the batter.  I baked them at 400 for exactly 20 minutes and they turned out perfect - not too sweet, so the addition of the chocolate chips did not turn them into an overwhelmingly sweet muffin. They hit the spot between my husband's preference for savouries and my preference for sweets.

I used 2 packets of flavored instant oatmeal and added a little cinnamon and some craisins (just because I had them). Muffins were great!  I think this basic recipe is perfect for adapting to whatever you have on hand.  It was quick and easy.

Meh. Nothing to write home about. I added cinnamon and still found them bland. Also seemed greasy, I’d suggest cutting some of the oil.  Very small, I got 8 regular sized muffins out of it, to get 12 these wouldn’t reach the top of the muffin pan.  Won’t be my go to that’s for sure, better ones out there.

I substituted some whole wheat (about a third) for the same amount of all-purpose flour and added about a third cup of dried cranberries. I made a crumb topping of a third cup quick oats, 1 tablespoon melted butter, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and a couple shakes of cinnamon. As some reviewers suggested, I let the batter sit for 10 minutes before baking. Because I used a dark, non-stick muffin tin (lined with paper cups), I lowered the oven temperature to 375 degrees as per usual protocol. Delish!

I thought it was very good.  Not very sweet, and we are sugaraholics so we just served with butter.  I did not have quick cooking oats so I used rolled oats and it was almost like having nuts in it.  Just a slight crunch, I really liked it.  My guess is the quick oats would have absorbed better and not had the nutty texture.  We will make again and maybe add bananas or other fruit next time as a variation.  Thanks for the recipe

Great tasting and easy to make.  Better for lunch boxes than muffins with streusel.  My husband loved them.

Tasty and easy! I substituted 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of avacado oil for the vegetable oil. I also added vanilla extract and cinnamon. Finally 1 added a spoonful of strawberry jam to the middle of each muffin. The kids loved it!

Muffins were excellent! Fluffy, moist, and came nicely out of the muffin wrapper. I added a packet of Quaker maple and brown sugar oatmeal for flavour. Delicious!

I've never eaten or made oatmeal muffins, so I have no comparison- but these were exactly what I was hoping for. The consistency was nice, not crumbly or too chewy. I used a 'strawberries and cream' instant oatmeal plus instant oats to equal the 3/4c.

Very tasty. I added cinnamon and nutmeg because I was also adding diced apples. I found the batter to be very runny prior to adding the apples so I had to add more dry ingredients, flour and ground flax seed, not much, but enough. I didn't have instant oatmeal and had to pulse rolled oats in the processor so probably instant oatmeal will make it a thicker batter. At 18 mins they were on the verge of burning, maybe my oven runs hot, just check them earlier. All in all quite a good basic recipe

Made these with some alterations per other reviews. Such a quick, easy recipe. Used applesauce in place of oil, used honey and maple syrup in place of sugar, added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Added some ground flax seed. Was only able to get 11 muffins from batter. Used muffin liners. Baked 350 for 20 min.

Delicious! The only differences I made were in the oats, (I used old fashioned and let them soak for maybe five minutes.)  I also added a bit of cinnamon. They turned out to have a great consistency and wonderfully oaty flavor.

This is a great basic oatmeal recipe that can be tweaked and still come out excellent.  I added walnuts, cranberries, and raisins, and cut back on the sugar to 1/4 c. (which I think is plenty sweet).  I also used left over cooked oatmeal and a bit of rolled oatmeal to make the measurement correct.  Good recipe!

Delicious and couldn't be easier or simpler. Had weekend company and made them the night before they were needed. Stored in an airtight container with a paper napkins underneath as well as on top to absorb the moisture muffins often get when stored this way. They got great reviews all around and were perfect to serve to a group with various dietary likes and needs. I used regular oats because that was what was on hand; beyond  that, nothing else was substituted or altered. I made a double batch and they kept well.

I made these for my 5yo son who doesn't eat much of anything. He likes oatmeal cookies so I was looking for an oatmeal muffin recipe that I could add spinach to. They turned out really yummy and he ate them! I altered it in the following ways: 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 cups quick cooking oatmeal (not instant), 1/2 cup steamed and blended spinach combined with 1Tblsp blue agave, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup white sugar. They only needed to bake 15-18 minutes at 400.

I used white instead of brown sugar. It was a bit crispier. Just the way I like it! Yum yum yum! Good muffins.

I just made these muffins and baked at 400 degrees as directed.  However, I found the oven too hot and they baked with a slight peak in the centre and a little overcooked around the edges.  So next time I will use 375 degrees.  (However, it may be that my oven is not accurate itself).
They taste very good with nice texture and I will bake again.
This time I added walnuts that worked well.

Yum. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I will check them at 15 minutes because baking them for 20 over cooked them.

I made one batch and they were so easy and yummy I made another one.  I doubled the recipe and no problem with results.

They were more moist and tasty than much more complex recipes.

I froze a bunch in pairs of two in freezer baggies and they thaw out perfectly in the microwave.  (30-50 seconds while frozen depending on your  microwave power). Still tasted good.

Changes:  I added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  Also, I used non-fat milk and Eggbeater eggs (scant 1/2 C seemed to nicely equal two eggs.)  They would probably be even richer with whole milk and whole eggs.

When I was out of brown sugar I used white sugar and 2T of molasses.  Worked out fine.

So this is a REALLY user-friendly and forgiving recipe.

I was wanting an oatmeal muffin and decided to try this one. Since I wasn't using instant oats, I combined oats, brown sugar, and milk to sit while I was putting together the dry ingredients. I also added cinnamon, craisins, and vanilla to add more flavor

Followed recipe as written.  Totally unimpressed.    Baked 1/2 plain as written, but added soaked cranberries, cinnamon, chopped almonds and a hint of ground cloves to the other half which raised them to a solid 4.  Will never make them plain again, yuck.

Very nice texture! I used quick oats instead of instant oatmeal and I was out of milk so I substituted it with 1/4 cup of yogurt and 1/4 cup of water. I was also out of brown sugar so I made some myself by mixing molasses and sugar together. I'm not sure how the flavor would've turned out if I hadn't added so much molasses to the sugar though...

I wanted a good basic oatmeal muffin recipe that I can make my own by adding whatever I wanted and this was it.  I prefer oil based ones because they add more moisture than the ones with butter.  I added some vanilla extract, about a teaspoon or 2, a couple teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1 cup-ish of blueberries, and about 3/4 cup (just guessing, didn't measure) chopped walnuts.  Turned out great and hearty and not very sweet.  Next time I might try dark chocolate chips and walnuts instead.  You can add anything to this recipe and it'll taste great.  I also baked them at 375 degrees instead of 400.

Really good! I've made these a couple times and they are the perfect snack... If I'm feeling chocolatey, I add a cup of dark chocolate chips :) They can be a little dry, but still very good! I only bake them about 14 minutes. at 18, I find them burnt.

Very good, I doubled the recipe. I'm a sweet lover so I used a little bit more brown sugar than called for (also used dark brown sugar), added walnuts, vanilla flavoring and some dried red tart cherries. Delicious!

I love these! I have made them before and this time I edited them for my sons dietary needs and they turned out great again! He has some food sensitivities. I wanted to make sure I kept this recipe and also share incase others deal with wheat allergies & dairy allergies. 

The replacements I made:
-Coconut oil (melted) instead of vegetable oil ( I have used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 butter also)
-Approx. 3/4 cup brown rice flour and 1/4 cup arrowroot starch instead of wheat flour 
-1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk instead of cows milk 
I also used the less procced brown sugar that is darker with stronger molasses taste.  They turned out great!! 

We had a bday party to attend the same day I made these so instead of making a special batch of cupcakes for my son to eat I added about 1/4 cup sugar and cocoa to these to play them off as a cupcake for him. They taste like chocolate muffins. Yummy!!

I subbed in apple sauce instead of oil, the sugar down to 1/2 cup and used regular oats that I put in a blender to make smaller and then let the recipe set for ten minutes before baking. It was good warm out of the oven, but I'm doubtful that eaten cold they will win any hearts. I think buttermilk would have been better and one other post mentioned adding orange extract and diced craisins which sounds amazing!

Love this recipe!!! I've made mini muffins from this. I've added small chunks of Granny Smith apples. I've used the Splenda brown sugar instead. Made with half quick oats and half large flakes. Topped with a sprinkle of large flake oats, course sugar, and dash of cinnamon. Taste delicious and so beautiful ;)

These were very good. I wanted something different for breakfast and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. The only change I made was that I substituted applesauce in place of the half cup of oil that it called for. I even gave some to my parrots. They loved them too! I will definitely make these again as they weren't real sweet. Next time I will add some bananas and maybe a few chopped walnuts.

Delicious, moist, not too sweet. I filled the muffin tins halfway, then sprinkled in fresh blueberries, and topped with more batter. As a topping, I made a crumb by mixing a small amount of butter and brown sugar with some dry oatmeal. Sprinkled it on top and baked. I also added 2 tablespoons melted butter to the batter for creaminess and it worked out well. Delicious! I will def make these again

Awesome! Moist and flavorful once you add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. Also added some chocolate chips, and let the oats soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes.

I hate cooking so I'm always looking for EASY, yet tasty, recipes. This one fit the bill. Trying to be slightly more health conscious, I used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil as well as quick oats instead of instant. Also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Poured the batter into mini muffin pans (it made 36), baked for 10 minutes and they were wonderful. All but a handful were gobbled up within 30 minutes and the remaining few didn't make it past morning coffee. They are dense but nice and filling, and they taste great! Will definitely be making again!!

Super easy. Mixed up wet ingredients in Vitamix then added to dry. Subbed lots: applesauce, couple tbsp of avocado oil, unswt coconut milk; 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey; and also added at least a tbsp of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Used quick oats and whole wheat flour. Really good and just slightly sweet. Nice and dense. Rose nicely; if yours don't, invest in new baking powder.

My toddler and husband both love these. So I make them every week. 
I find the recipe as written to be dry so I add a mashed banana. Also add cinnamon- a healthy dash. I don't bother with the salt. 
These are a hit every Sunday and make great breakfasts during the week.

I used Crisco instead of liquid oil and it made them moister than before.  Also, 20 minutes is a little long for my oven.  I bake them 18 minutes.

Very good basic oatmeal muffins. I added in 1 teaspoon of cinamon and 1 teadpoon of vanilla. Also I used 100% whole grain old fashioned oats (because its what I had on hand) and myown mix of gluten free flour (cup for cup). Delicious for any time of day! Baked in excatly 12 minutes.  Made 9 regular size muffins.

They were fairly bland... But I think that's a good thing because then you can definitely change the recipe to add anything you have in your pantry. I added some cinnamon, vanilla extract and blueberries the second time I made them. Next time I may add carrots, cinnamon and nutmeg.

These were so easy to make. I used regular large oats so i soaked them for 1 minute and put them in a strainer and squeezed out the water. Then i followed the recipe exactly. As others suggested I added a bit of cinnamon. We also chopped some frozen fruit and mixed that in. After putting the mix in the muffin tin my daughter wanted to put a blob of frozen fruit on top. They are delicious!

I scaled this down to make 6 muffins. I used 1/2 cup of oats instead of 1/4  cup + 2 tbsp. It made 6 small-med muffins. I also added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla and some raisins and pecan pieces to dress it up a little more. They had a nice flavor, good sweetness (not too sweet), and a nice chew to them. I think they would have been pretty bland without my additions. Would make again.

I liked these but my hubby really liked them more. I used 1 pkg strawberry cream oatmeal and 1 pkg banana cream oatmeal mixed with a bit more plain instant to make the full 3/4cup. I made mini muffins and baked at 350 for about 20 mins and got about 2 dozen larger ones.

I misread the ingredients before I started the recipe, and then made some changes of my own, and had to accommodate for what I had on hand... Used Quaker Quick Oats instead of Instant, used 1/2 cup Lactose free low-fat milk instead of regular whole milk, added 1/2 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp cinnamon. They were good. I'll be making them again.

Added cinnamon, very tasty.
Also did the double-up-on-baking powder instead of soda, so I used a total of 2 and 1/2 teaspoons powder, no soda, and no salt.
Love how easy this is! Very inexpensive ingredient list

Ingredients are perfect for exactly 12 servings. Smells delicious and very tasty.
If I may advise is to play around with some fillings and toppings.

I used 1/4 cup less sugar and substituted cold press coconut oil to keep it sweet. Also added Saigon cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. Also through in a baby food sweet potato jar to get some nutrients in. Sneaky. Very tasty!

This is a good, basic oatmeal recipe. I change them to make them slightly better - I reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, sub 1/4 cup of the oil for cinnamon applesauce, use whole oats rather than instant, and add both 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cup add ins. I typically do chocolate chips for the add ins, and add 1/4 cup to the batter and sprinkle the other 1/4 cup on top. Delicious!

Seems like this recipe would make a great base for any flavor muffin! We made ours with chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, 1/3 of the flour was whole wheat, and they were a huge hit! I could I could imagine using berries or apples or nuts as well. 
It also looks like it would be easy to make a bit more healthy: using applesauce for oil, more whole wheat flour, and sugar substitutes.

I love easy recipes like this. The only change I made was adding cinnamon. They bake up nice and fluffy and are very filling. I might try using applesauce instead of oil next time just to cut down on fat and cost.

Great recipe.  Only alteration is the addition of about 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I'll sometimes add some fresh or frozen blueberries, but certainly not necessary.

This is a good basic recipe, but it needs a lot of tweaking to make it anything special.  There is no flavorings in this recipe so it does make a fairly sweet, but bland muffin.

Excellent!! My fiancé gobbled these up. On the advice of another rating, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter. It ended up making 11 muffins with the cups filled 3/4 full and baking for 13 minutes.

This recipe is one of the best I have seen so far. All I need to do is just put the ingredients in and stir it. Simple and fast. I tried it this morning and it had turned out great. For the people that does not like muffins that is too sweet, this is a suitable choice to make.

I substitute the flour with gluten free all purpose flour and double the baking powder (for all gluten free baking). Sometimes I add raisins and cinnamon.  This recipe is easy to make and you wouldn't know by the taste that I had substituted the flour. Also make sure the oatmeal is gluten free.

These were very easy to put together. I did add a bit more sugar (cooking for my kids) . I also added a tbs of vanilla, a tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  My kids and I absolutely loved them. I will definitely be making these again and soon.

This took about four minutes to throw together, and I baked them for 16 minutes at 375.  They were delicious!  The kids devoured them.  I look forward to trying it with some healthier modifications.

I found this recipe very easy to make - and very easy to add things to it. However I added frozen strawberries and found that they made the muffins way too gooey - any suggestions on how to fix this?

these were really good! i did make some modifications though. i did what a previous reviewer did (elizabeth B) and did 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/4 cup apple sauce. i also added 1 tsp cinnamon, walnuts, 3/4 cups wheat flour and 1/4 cup white, smashed banana and banana slices. it gave it a little more healthiness and flavor. next time i'll try other fruits in it as well. i think blueberries or strawberries would taste good or even bananas, strawberries and blueberries all in the same muffin might be good!
