this is my fav go to sandwich! it sooooo tweakable (lol, is that a word?). it never turns out the same way twice. sometimes i change up the seasoning on the steak and may season up the mayo with hot sauce or mustard or whatever i feel like at the time. sometimes it's the bun! it's very delicious, and nutritious (i'm throwing that in for good measure, lol), AND deeply satifying! Enjoy

Wonderful thanks for the idea. I changed the recipe a bit, add sauted onions red and white, different cheeses etc, It's a recipe you can change to make it your own. Just great.

This was Awesome! I used leftover steak from last night, which i just heated through. I used a red bell pepper from my garden (1st one picked), and added some sliced red onions and garlic to the mushroom mixture. I love how you can really make this sandwich your own..i used BBQ sauce in place of mayo, and Monterey Jack cheese because that's what i had on hand. Thanks for the Delicious recipe..will be making this again!

No better word than scrumptious for this sammy! I could not resist adding onion, but it was not at all necessary.
