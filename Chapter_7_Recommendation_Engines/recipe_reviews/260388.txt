If you have a scale - it would be best to weigh the ingredients in grams as this is originally a German recipe and with German cookie recipes, precision in ingredients is key - use 200 g unsalted butter, 100 g confectioner's sugar, 100 g walnuts, and 300 g flour (you see how the ratio is well coordinated)

I make these all the time  and everyone LOVES them!  Recipe makes a ton, so I make them every year around Christmas to gift to teachers and neighbors. Definitely weigh the ingredients in grams (that's what I did)
