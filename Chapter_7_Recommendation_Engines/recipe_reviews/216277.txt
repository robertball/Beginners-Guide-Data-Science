We love this dip in my family.  It's so easy and delicious!  My sister adds a healthy dash of onion powder and garlic powder to hers.

I can't believe I never thought of this before. I mean, really. I used reduced fat sour cream and because I didn't have the parmesan italian dressing mix, I added 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese. The kids and I thought it was really good.

This is a good variation of the usual sour cream and ranch dip. I used the regular italian dressing mix & it was delicious but id probably use an extra packet of seasoning next time because the italian flavor was a bit mild for our taste. My 19 month old loved it though! He dipped everything from chips to veggies to his fingers in it!
