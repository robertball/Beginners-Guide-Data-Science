My first time trying Romesco Dip. I and my guests loved it. I chose this recipe because it uses peppers in a jar -- I'm sure freshly roasted ones would be even more delicious but the convenience worked for me this time. I used my blender rather than a food processor with just fine results. 4 stars rather than 5 because this is my only experience with it -- and I suspect roasting the peppers one's self would send it over the top.
