I liked this recipe for making an easily mixable batter and smaller batch than most recipes make. Thus healthier for a small household! I switched out one third of the Crisco for coconut oil and used half butterscotch / half dark chocolate chips. (1/2 cup Crisco 1/4 cup coconut oil; 1/2 cup BS chips 1/2 cup DC chips). I also cooked on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. If you know your oven temperature varies then the temp and time are variable so watch for browning edges.
