This was amazing thank you!   The sauce was the best.  I used fresh vegetables and did not have the noodles so served with basmati rice.

Very good. I used soy sauce instead of tamari, and I minced the ginger (discard it? No way !).

This recipe is named appropriately. Without telling my wife the kind of stir-fry I had prepared, she commented about the citrus-like flavor. The flavor is rich without being too overwhelming. I enjoyed the richness of the tamari sauce. I thought I had peanut oil when I started but did not, so I used sesame oil to brown the chicken. I also lightly drizzled some sesame oil on the pasta too, which my wife also enjoyed. All in all, a nice stir-fry recipe when you don't want the same, bland stir-fry.

This is a keeper! Very tasty! Usually my husband adds soy sauce or Texas Pete to my stir-fry meals but he didn't add anything to this! What I did: sauteed 1 clove of chopped garlic in olive oil & butter, added 2 chicken breasts (sliced in thin strips) and cooked until no pink showed. Pushed chicken to outer edges of pan and added onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms, and red pepper to center of pan (what was on hand). Topped with 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of OJ concentrate, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, salt & fresh ground pepper. Covered & cooked until vegis done, stirring occasionally. Juiced 1/4 lemon and sprinkled over all. Stirred and served over wheat noodles. Will try rice next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Did not have tamari so I used soy sauce but I don't think it mattered. I also used fresh vegetables and served over basmati rice.  Next time I will add pineapple. I think it will blend nicely with the citrus.

We really enjoyed this dish. I found it had lots of flavor. Instead of the tamari sauce I used soya sauce as that was what was on hand. Then instead of peanut oil i used seasame oil...again what was on hand. Plus we had some "ancient grains" from costco so used that instead of noodles...so good as for veggies i used snow peas, yellow pepper, carrots, cauliflower, onion and celery. I should have taken a picture as it was super colorful and tastey!

Love this recipe. I like other reviewers used soy sauce instead of tamari. Added garlic to the chicken and fresh vegetables. Did not discard the ginger.Served with our favorite basmati rice recipe from this site. Note: Double the sauce:  its that good!

The marmalade in this is what makes it. Very good. We loved it and we will eat this again.

Pretty good, though doesn't have much flavor as written.  We added seasoning (a citrus & basil rub blend I had) to the chicken while it was cooking, as well as some crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I didn't cook the pasta, but served the stir fry over rice instead.

This turned out well with adaptations for what I had.  Used Apricot jam (did not have orange marmalade).  Used Ponzu sauce instead of Tamari (to add citrus).  Used ready to stir fry Asian noodles. Had sliced mushrooms and frozen pea pods.  Added chopped onions and garlic and cooked these together rather than the stir fry veggies.   Might marinade the chicken next time with orange juice and soy sauce before cooking it.

Amazing sauce. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. It was so flavorful and delicious. I used rice noodles and vegetables I had: fresh shiitake mushrooms, celery, yellow bell pepper, cooked cauliflower. I also used chicken thighs. It disappeared in one sitting. Everyone loved it.

It was a hit!  Minor detail: I used regular soy instead of tamari.

Big hit with my super picky, anti-vegetable family. They pick out the veggies and give them to me! It's a win, win.

It was good, but lacked a seasoned flavor. The citrus portions were great but lacked actual seasoning. That is just me and maybe my taste buds are a little tough.

Very tasty. This recipe was enough to have left overs, between my boyfriend and I. Used one package of Udon wheat noodles (8oz) and was plenty.

This was very good! The flavors of the orange marmalade and tamari sauce really made this dish. I agree with the other reviewers I also left the ginger in. I used Basmati rice with a mixture of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green onion  and some pineapple. Fabulous!

For the first time, I followed this recipe to the letter. I doubled the sauce recipe as it didn't sound like enough. Glad I did I also thickened  the sauce with flour and water, as I couldn't find the cornstarch and I prefer the sauce a little thicker and it was still a little runny after simmering for 20-25 minutes. I too, used lite soy sauce because it was what I had on hand. My husband said it was as good as any restaurant entrée! Oh yeah, I served over rice instead of pasta. Delish!

I reversed the order of cooking. I made the sauce first and while it was reducing, I cooked the noodles. The chicken only took 2 to 3 minutes to cook. It was very good.
