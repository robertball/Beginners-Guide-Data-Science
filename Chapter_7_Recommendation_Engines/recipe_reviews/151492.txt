Have made this twice so far, each time substituting butterscotch chips for almond brickle and chocolate sauce for caramel. Chilled, they're very good and are a rich dessert. I would like to try making these with the original ingredients, but I never seem to have them on hand!

These are excellent. Everyone loves them! Followed the recipe, using the Hot Caramel Ice Cream Topping in place of the Spoonable and it worked out great. The caramel was thinner than the spoonable and baked down into the bars so I added a small amount to the tops before serving. The crust amount and texture is a perfect pair to the creamy filling with a little crunch from the brickle chips. This is going to be a great addition to my holiday baking this year!!

Definately 5 stars! I followed the recipe exactly except for using low fat cream cheese(that's what I had in the fridge),I sent them to a New Year's celebration @ my sister's house and they were a hit! They disapeared in minutes my sister went to grab something and by the time she came back they were gone! Oh yeah they're that good! Thanks SMUCKER'S!!

I was so excited to make this .... but something went terribly wrong!!  The crust was so hard!!  We couldn't even cut through it  :(  The filling was good ...... if you just want to eat cream cheese filling with caramel swirl .... lol  I am so glad I didn't take this to a Holiday party .... I would have been embarrassed!  I would try to make this again, if I can figure out where it went wrong.

I made these this morning and they are awesome! I followed the recipe exactly, except I sprayed the baking dish with a little Pam to prevent sticking.

The crust is unbelievably hard, it's ridiculous. I have friends coming over for lunch and they will get crumbly bars? Nowhere it says to grease the pan, though you wouldn't think too since it IS mostly butter. Taste is good.

The caramel topping really isn't that important an ingredient. I couldn't find the butter brickles so I used the Heath chips and it was delicious!

I read a few reviews that said how hard the crust was, so I cut the first baking time by 10 minutes and followed everything else to the book.  These are amazing!  I come from a family of chocoholics, but wanted to do something different my boyfriend (a caramel and cream cheese fanatic) would really like.  I'm excited for him to try these soon!

Fabulous! These were a huge hit and I will make them again . . . and again!! A wonderful cross between the traditional cookie, cheesecake and a bar! I couldn't find the almond brickle chips in the market so substituted the Heath chocolate toffee bits. Maybe they're basically the same thing. LOVED them!
