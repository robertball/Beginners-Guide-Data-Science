my original recipe stated to use sandwich spread, more like thousand island.  I think you will find this makes it better than the Miracle Whip.

My son-in-law made this and everyone seemed like it, but the sodium content was much too high for my reduced sodium blood pressure diet.  What a shame.

Yes Robin, this is truly a man's man kind of sandwich! I too used Thousand Island dressing in lieu of the Miracle Whip and it added the tang that's typically associated with a reuben sandwich. Your mom did a great job and we thank her!!

This was very good.  I like it alot better than the traditional reuben and I really like Reubens !  I used pastrami in place of the corned beef because that is what I had on hand. Will absolutely make again.  My kids even liked it and they are not big reuben lovers.  Thanks  Mom ! It was Great.

This is a delicious recipe.  I used low fat Thousand Island dressing and sprinkled lemon pepper on the buttered outsides of the sandwich before grilling-- my husband LOVES this sandwich.
