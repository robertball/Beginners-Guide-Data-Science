I chose this recipe because I'm not overly crazy about the taco seasoning in these layered recipes and most of the ingredient list was on hand.  I used chili beans (instead of refried beans) and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder in addition to seasonings and mixed it in my food processor.  I subbed about a cup of salsa for the tomato.  This only took about 8 minutes to put together, so a great recipe for those short on time.  The taste? -5 stars!  You can't lose with an easy recipe, common ingredients, great taste, short prep time and easy to double for crowds.

very blah...  I think it needs a sour cream/cream cheese/light taco seasoning mixture in place of the plain sour cream.  the rest of the toppings were perfect, however.  I especially like that it didn't include lettuce.  I hate lettuce in a taco dip.

Meh. I prefer my old version with taco sauce, guacamole and taco seasoning mixed with the sour cream. This was very bland!

I prefer the 7-layer dip from this site, the plain sour cream on this one made it bit blah.  I had some leftover lettuce sitting in the fridge that I sprinkled on the top but other than that, followed the recipe.

Good, simple dip recipe that's really easy and quick to make.  I used red kidney beans instead of refried, and onion powder instead of green onions.

I love this recipe however I like to add a little more seasoning to it so I add in about 1/2 Teaspoon of Cayanne Pepper with the beans. I also add one more layer before the tomato of chopped jalapenos. It adds just a little bit of a kick without overpowering.

This dip is a big hit at parties.  Its so much more fresh than its cream cheese/heated counterpart.  I added a 1/4 cup of shredded lettuce because I had it on hand.
