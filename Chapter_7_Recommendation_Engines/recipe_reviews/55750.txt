I made this fudge this afternoon and was optimistic because usually fudge is too sweet for me.  This fudge has a good flavor, but turned out grainy.  I added toasted, salted almonds for the nuts.  The directions were a bit confusing.  In #4 it says something about 30-40 minutes.  I didn't know what that was for.  I heated the fudge to 235 degrees and then dumped it into the big pan.  I followed the directions, but am disappointed by how grainy it is.  Perhaps the person who submitted the recipe would clarify #4 and what the 30-40 minutes is for.  Was I supposed to boil it that long??  I didn't because I have never seen that done in another recipe.
