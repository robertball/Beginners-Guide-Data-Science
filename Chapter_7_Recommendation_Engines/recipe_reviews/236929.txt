My husband loved it! When I make it again, and I will, I will make it milder somehow because it was too spicy-hot for those in my family who do not enjoy spicy food. Thank you for posting a quick and easy frijoles recipe that tastes delicious and makes my house smell wonderful!

I've doubled, tripled, even quadrupled this recipe many times for my family and for large groups.  I'm able to buy the really large cans of pinto beans and Rotel tomatoes where I live, which makes it easier. It's always a hit! I've never added the ham. I make a pot almost every week and they may be eaten refried alongside eggs in the morning (wonderful!!!), taken in small containers along with a tortilla at lunch, or eaten with tri-tip for dinner.  I'm sure they can be jazzed up a little or substitutions made in the ingredients, but they are yummy just the way the recipe is written.

These are so easy to make and so tasty.  Gave them a fairly healthy shot of Trader Joe's Chili Pepper Sauce, and they had just the right amount of heat for us. Followed the recipe except for the simmering time.  I don't think an hour is necessary for the flavors to develop.  The beans, tomatoes, and ham all are cooked, and I found about 15-20 minutes was plenty of time.  Thanks, Nancy, this was a nice side dish.

An excellent tasting bean recipe.  I omitted the cilantro and used regular petite diced tomatoes and added a small can of green chilies.  

Though it takes a little more time, I use dry pinto beans (frijoles) instead of canned.

sautéed onions/garlic in bacon fat, added all ingredients, then added beef bullion and liquid smoke.  Big hit.

Super easy and great flavor- I did add half a bottle of beer and let this simmer for several hours before serving.

Very good and quick recipe! I added a little bit of liquid smoke and some diced white onions I had. I do have a question about when the right time to add the beer would be. But I made this for about 20 people and it turned out great!

Followed the recipe as written but just adjusted for the serving size of 16.  I did it in a crock pot on low for @ 3 hrs and then on high the last hour.  Additionally I added Corona Familiar when I flipped it on high.  It was a hit with the skirt steak I made.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is a surprisingly good side dish pinto bean recipe that could not be easier to make.  I'd serve it to guests and will make it again.  Tonight was a side with ribs.  I read some of the reviews about people skipping the ham; I did use one thin slice, only about 1/4 cup.  Also, the tomatoes with chilies are spicy - I loved the flavor, but just a heads up.  I did not need to add additional hot sauce.

This is an amazingly simple but flavorful recipe. I make this very often at my home. I always add about two cups of chicken broth to make it more of a soup and extend what I have made. This makes a great side dish for most anything... The leftovers are amazing on their own with only a tortilla or crusty bread.

Easy side for Mexican food. I omit the ham and use seasoning salt instead. We don't typically like pinto beans but prepared this way is delicious!

Excellent 'last minute' bean recipe.  Super easy.  As others have noted, use mild RO-TEL tomatoes if you want to tone down the heat.  With that said, I thought the regular RO-TEL had just the right amount of kick.

Delicious and easy!  I omitted the ham and next time will only use one splash of hot sauce instead of 3 - was a little spicy.  Tastes like what they serve in the mexican restaurants.

Thank you for this recipe. Used the slow cooker and it turned out great! Will definitely make again.
