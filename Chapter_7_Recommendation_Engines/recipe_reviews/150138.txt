This recipe is great!  The dish is fantastic!  I used the Kraft Shredded Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese blend instead of the normal parmesan and it was delicious!  I also used light mayo.

I had half a head of cauliflower to use and found this recipe.  I altered it because I didn't want to use mayo and had some other ingredients on hand. I used 1/3cu vinegar, less than 1/4 cu olive oil, an unmeasured amount of water and plain yogurt to make a thick creamy dressing with the italian mix.  I tossed this with raw cauliflower, because this head tasted great, shredded carots, and some frozen peas.  Refreshing way to keep extra veggies from rotting in the fridge!

I am not a big cauliflower fan but this recipe may convert me into a flowerhead.  I altered nothing on the recipe except I added a bit more cheese (Romano blend) and sprinkles of Italian seasoning.  This salad is ridiculously simple and very tasty.

Really enjoyed this!  I used homemade italian dressing mix and was only able to chill it for an hour but it was so good!  Thanks for sharing!

We liked this salad but it isn't visually appealing.    I garnished it with green onions but I think adding another green vegetable or red peppers would be good.

I agree that this had a bold flavor.  I didn't set it in the fridge for 2 hours before trying it, and I think it would have tasted better if I had.  But, it was good.

Very tasty. I used light mayo and probably not quite as much parm. I also added a little vinegar and water to thin out the dressing a bit. Oh, and I didn't blanch my cauliflower because I wanted a raw salad. Also added some broccoli florets for a kick of color.
