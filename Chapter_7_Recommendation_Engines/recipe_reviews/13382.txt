Terrific!!Made this soup for Xmas Eve get-together and everyone wanted the recipe. I didn't add amt of salt and pepper from recipe, I added it near the end a little at a time and kept tasting it. I also added 3/4 stick of butter, it added a creamy, buttery taste to it.I put it in a crockpot to keep it warm(amount from recipe filled crockpot perfectly).  I served it in round bread bowls, hollowed out, and topped with crumbled bacon and shredded chedder cheese. I'll be making this one for years to come, it's great!!!!!

I spent 4 hours making this soup and I had to throw it away! It tasted like melted pepper... If you make this soup DO NOT follow the directions about the pepper! I was awful--

my family loves potatoe soup however the ratio of ingredients was alittle off way too much pepper i also used chicken broth instead of the boullion cubes and omitted the the green pepper and the celery as we do not like it the garlic i used powder in stead of minced and only to taste so it was not overpowering other than that it was relativley good

The amount of pepper in this recipe must be wrong.  I tasted this soup and the pepper just burnt my mouth!

Do NOT follow the recipe on amount of pepper.  It must be a misprint.  I spent the whole day cooking this soup, took one spoonful and had to throw the whole thing out....WAY too hot!!! I will make this recipe again but I will add much less pepper.

I have made this soup many times and my family always loves it. Of course, salt and pepper is to taste, I leave it out completely and let everyone season their own. I use only one onion and saute it before adding it to all the other chopped veggies (except the potato) and simmer until tender. Then I add the veggies to the potatoes after they are cooked and use the veggies broth to whip the potatoes. Then add all the rest of the ingredients and heat through.  I will sometimes add some cooked ham or shredded cheese  or even chopped green chili for a little variety. Wonderful!

Oh my, that soup was not to my liking! The amout of pepper was so overdone nothing would help! Shame on me for not reading reviews and wasting all that effort! I wouldn't give this recipe even one star if the site would let me!
