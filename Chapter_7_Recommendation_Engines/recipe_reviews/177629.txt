This was quick and easy to prepare after work. Overall this is a pretty decent recipe that used ingredients I already had it the house. I added some garlic, Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to suit my family's taste.

I am rating this recipe based on my kids because I didn't try it except for a bite.  My kids both loved it. One took it for school in her lunch the next day. I made it in the morning and put it in the refrigerator then baked it for dinner. I rated it a 4 based on my bite, it was little bland for my taste. Super easy back to school meal. I would cover it for 20- 25 minutes with aluminum foil and then remove the last 5-10 minutes while baking so the noodles don't dry out on top.

I substituted turkey sausage in the recipe and it was so good.  My family didn't even realize I had made this switch on them.

Substituted italian turkey sausage for ground beef and used Barilla tomato/basil sauce instead of Ragu (personal preference).  This was really easy to make and really good!  Used about a cup of italian blend cheese on top.

Tasty and easy.  We have a 15 person family dinner each week and this is one of my favorite, easy to make, filling and yummy meals for that purpose (double the recipe).  I doctor it up with a little seasoning and use my favorite sauce....good to go.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I didnt' use the Mushroom sauce because the kids are picky.  But it was great with any flavor sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a good and simple recipie. I added some ground cumin, italian seanoning and about a clove and a half of minced garlic. I also used sun dried tomato and sweet basil Prego instead of Mushroom, since no one in my family really cares for mushrooms. I think it needed some more tomato flavor, so next time I think I will add some fire roasted diced tomatos to this as well. I have three kids and a husband, all of which are picky and all of which liked this ziti. I only give 4 stars because I still need to add a little to it to make it perfect for my family. Thanks for sharing this recipie!

Good recipe for a cheap and easy dinner!  I did spice it up a bit with garlic, parsley, basil, ground pepper, and a bunch of crushed red pepper flakes.  Husband and son both approved, and it made enough for leftovers the next day!  A keeper!

My husband and I loved this recipe, but I did make some changes.  I used more seasoning than it called for and more meat.  This is very eay to make and really just has a bunch of ingredients that you probably have in your pantry!  I will definetly make it again with some minor modifications.

This turned out rather well. I used 3T of dried minced onion, added some salt and pepper and a clove of minced garlic with the meat and onion during browning. I used store brand sauce and it was a 20 oz jar so I used 1 1/2 jars. I made about 12 oz of pasta and that seemed to be enough.  I didn't measure to see if it was 5 cups or not. I doubled the cheese and baked this for 40 minutes. This didn't get raves like a homemade sauce would have and wasn't fancy but it was good. This made a 9x13 pan.

I added some garlic, basil, and substituted half of the ground beef for lean elk meat.  It was a good dish, my kids liked it, but its missing something.  I doubled the recipe but made too many noodles.  Maybe use 3/4 of a box of noodles next time...

I make this recipe all the time.  I do add some spices to make it taste the way my family likes it.  The only thing I do that is completely different is add pepperoni on top of the cheese.  YUM!!

Yum! I love this recipe compared to others for a few reasons. Usually baked ziti recipes call for layering pasta, meat, cheese. This one has you just mix it all up and then top with cheese, which is so much better, because all the pasta gets covered in sauce, plus it is easier! Also, the onions really added something. I used a spaghetti sauce seasoning packet, mixed with tomato paste and water instead of a jar, and I also used some cheddar cheese on top, along with the mozzarella, because I had it on hand. So delicious served with garlic toast and a veggie.

Classic baked ziti.  I used bulk Italian sausage, not the ground beef and my grocer didn't have the same sauce so I used Prego Veggie Smart.  Also added garlic.  Great meal served with garlic bread and salad.  As a rule, I weight about 2 oz of pasta per person so I cook up the right amount.

This recipe was excellent!! The husband loved it too:)  I only used a half pound of ground beef which was plenty (it cut a few calories out too) Very good!  Will make it again soon!

I found a variation of this recipe, which is called, "Now and Later Baked Ziti," at the Campbell's Kitchen website, which easily earns a 5-star rating, and then some! Though I've never tried this AR version, I can tell by reading it that it would not be as good as the original. The biggest issue (and likely the reason why many here find it bland) would be the amount of pasta, there's way too much of it!

As for the original: I've made it three times and find it quite a treat. Especially when served up with a caesar salad and homemade garlic toast. Can't go wrong with a meal like that! YUM!

This is a great recipe. It's easy and once you mix everything together, you throw it in the oven and don't have to think about it until you're ready to eat. I added more cheese than what it called for, just b/c I like it to be very cheesy. Simple, good, have had it many times.

I used a blend of Italian sausage and ground beef. I cooked the ground beef with some chopped onion, garlic, pepper, Italian seasoning, beef bullion, and mustard. The sausage was cooked in a separate pan without its skin and the fat was drained for both. I didn't use Parmesan but it was no big deal. I sprayed Pam on the pan before baking for easier cleanup. I layered pasta, beef or sausage, sauce, and cheese and so on. I covered it for 20 minutes in the oven and then left it uncovered for the last 15 minutes in the oven. Tasted great! My mom and I love it and she's not a big pasta fan

I've made this a few times now. I use plain sauce and substitute onion powder for onion (personal preferences). This recipe is perfection, a quick and easy dinner.

I love this recipe, although I think that I am not going to cook the noodles all the way before I bake them.  They were slightly mushy

I thought this recipe was a good starter recipe, made it open for more ideas. This is what I did: I used 1 pound of Penne Pasta because that's what I could find. 1 small yellow onion, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 large green pepper, 1 8 oz container of fresh mushrooms. 1 pound of 80% meat 20% fat ground beef, browned and drained, and 1 package of Johnsonville Hot Italian sausage casings removed browned and drained. and Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese on top. Bake at a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes also I didn't bake all of it I used half of the mixture to bake and put the rest in the freezer for another time because that made a lot of food, so if you want cut my measurements in half. Happy Cooking

I made this for my housewarming party and my guests went nuts!!!! I added a little more sauce though so it wouldn't be so dry. This was my 1st time making baked ziti by the way.

I sort of used this as a jumping point. I added some leftover sausage with peppers and onions I added to the sauce. I also doubled the cheese. It is a good starting point and easy to make your own.

Such a great, easy recipe -love it. It also works well with ground turkey, and or turkey sausage. I like it a little spicy so I add salt, pepper, red pepper to taste and use cheddar cheese. Mmmm Mmmm good.
