Delicious!  Cheesy and creamy.  I warmed the pumpernickel bread in the oven 5 minutes before I took the dip out of the oven so that it was toasy and crunchy.

This dip was really good.  However, I tried it with different cheeses different nights (mozzarella, cheddar, and swiss) and couldn't really tell a difference in taste.

I made this recipe and was heartily rewarded by everyone enjoying it and asking for the recipe.  There was about one spoonful left after the meal and my daughter made sure that it would be saved for her.

This is a delicious dip! We really enjoyed this one. It doesn't have tons of flavors going on, you really get to appreciate the swiss cheese, it's great. The texture is so creamy and velvety. I baked this as directed, but transferred to my bread bowl and broiled for 5 minutes on a cookie sheet. The bread came out toasty as well. I will make this again, thanks for sharing :)

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I made the recipe as written, but I only had sliced almonds, so I put the mixture in a small casserole dish, (I couldn't find round pumpernikel, just a loaf) and just topped it with the sliced almonds (instead of mixing them in). I baked it for about 15-20 mins., until bubbly, but not browned and served with chunks of the pumpernikel bread. We all (myself, hubby and 2 year old) LOVED this dip. This is such a simple and tasty recipe. I know I will be making this time and time again! Thanks for posting. :)

Unbelievably good! I didn't add the almonds. Rich, creamy, delishiousness! It does NOT reheat well, tho, the oil seperates & it gets that curdled look in a puddle of oil, altho the taste is still spectacular. I'll defianely make this again!!

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! I thought it was perfect and I doubled the recipe (just in case) I ended up freezing half and I am using the remaining tonight for a small dinner party. I used the breadbowl idea originally and tonight I'll use my fondue pot. I can't say enough about how great it is!

This was very good.  I made as written but omitted the almonds because I served it inside the Caraway Rye from this site and I just thought the almonds would be one too many textures.  We all enjoyed it and I will make this again, although probably not until the weather is cold.  This almost made me think of the fondue we had in Switzerland.  Thanks for sharing.

4 stars on behalf of my husband. The Swiss flavor is VERY prominent, so you must love Swiss cheese to love this dip. I put the dip in a baking dish, baked it, skipped the almonds, and just served it out of the baking dish with sliced french bread. My husband says it would have been 5 stars but was "missing a little something."

I added chopped green onions and didn't  use garlic powder.  This is always a family favorite
