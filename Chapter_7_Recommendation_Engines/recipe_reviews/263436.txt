3.24.18  Classic Western flavors (ham, bell peppers, and onion), simply good.  I didn’t include the mushrooms, and just flat out forgot to garnish with the green onions I’d set aside.  I think in the future I might add just one more egg, and then most likely split ithe omelet with my husband.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it was a nice Saturday morning breakfast..
