This soup is delicious! Great as an appetizer, just place one med-large spinach ravioli in the center of bowl and top with soup for a wonderful color contrast or serve with a salad and some crusty bread for a filling dinner. Great winter dish to warm your bones! Also, the recipe should state 2 medium butternut squashes, peeled seeded and diced with just enough chicken stock to cover. This should help with the thickness. Since I have had a hard time finding the spinach pasta cheese ravioli, I have also tried the tri colored tortellini the texture is very good. For vegetarians who would like to make this soup, you can substitute a light vegetable stock for the chicken stock called for in the original recipe.

This soup was absolutely fantastic - the nutmeg and wine give it the most subtle and wonderful flavor - highly recommended!

I would suggest adding MORE SQUASH though - I doubled the amount of squash because when I pureed it the first time I found it too thin. Doubling the amount of squash just makes the flavor deeper, but doesn't affect the other ingredient proportions.

For those looking to lighten it even further, I replaced the light cream with rice milk (you could do soy milk also).

I halved this recipe and made it using canned squash and skipped the pureeing step at the end.  I also added potatoes and mashed them when they turned soft.   I made the soup first and then added chopped up raw shrimp which cooked in the steaming hot soup while the ravioli's boiled.  Turned out delicious.  Without the alterations, i expect this soup is just as good.  The potato just thickened it up and gave it more substance and the shrimp was a delicious pairing.  So was a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon! :)

Fabulous recipe!  It's a different take on butternut squash soup, and absolutely delicious!  My VERY VERY picky kids loved it and my very skeptical husband quietly slurped down bowl after bowl.  We literally fought over the leftovers!  I accidentally only had heavy whipping cream on hand instead of light cream, and I'd have to admit that little "accident" was quite decadent!   I'm sure it would be lovely with the light cream, too.  I have another squash roasting in the oven right now to do it all over again!  (I roasted the squash first, then cubed it, because I just don't like cutting uncooked squash.)

Very elegant presentation, and nice flavor combination. I would serve this again for company. I might thicken the soup a little next time- a little higher squash to liquid ratio. Excellent recipe!

The leeks were a nice addition to the flavour of this soup, and the kids loved the ravioli in it! No one in my family likes butternut squash the way I do, but the kids devoured this soup! If making it for adults only, you may want to add something for more "kick"... not necessarily spice, but maybe some apple - cooked and pureed with the squash. If I ever make this for company, I will be sure to use Spinach Pasta Ravioli for the contrast of green colour with the bright orange of the soup base. Beautiful and impressive!

Great, filling soup. I added extra spice and a bit more squash. I also slashed the broth(made mine veggie) by about 1.5 cups. The spinach ravioli was a great addition. Can't wait to make it again- it was so easy!!

YUM!! I followed previous reviewers' ideas and baked the squash first at 400 for an hour, so it peeled really easy. Then I sauteed some vidalia onions in olive oil, instead of using butter and used only 4 cups of broth instead of 5.  So delicious! Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe is very unique and adds just the right hint of sweetness.  I used large cheese raviolis instead of spinach.  The recipe is inconsistent as to which ones the recipe calls for, but I can't imagine anything being better than the cheese raviolis in this soup.

I doubled the amount of squash (roasting and cubing prior to adding) and used green onions instead of leeks.  Everything was going along great...The soup smelled fabulous, the flavor was fantastic...then I added the cream.  Big mistake.  The cream had the effect of thickening the soup and mellowing the flavors too much.  Used spinach/cheese tortellini and it went well, under the circumstances.  The flavors definitely say "fall" so I'll try this soup again but only as a first course and omit the cream entirely.

In finding this recipe, we expected a really good soup but not one of 5 star fame. In that regard, we came away very satisfied. We used spinach & cheese ravioli from Costco. We purchased two large sized butternut squash which unexpectedly produced 7 heaping cups. Given that circumstance, we added an extra onion (2 onions) and 2 leaks. Having not read the reviews beforehand, we adjusted the liquid to 1 cup white wine and 6 cups chicken broth. By dumb luck, the liquid seemed just right given the extra squash & veggies being used. We doubled the spices, used about 1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger to prevent it from wasting, and added a dash of cayenne powder. After mixing in the squash, wine, broth, and seasoning, we adjusted the cooking instructions by bringing this mixture to a boil, and then simmering for 15 minutes. A 16 ounce tub of sour cream was subbed for the light cream. We would make this again.

Wow!  Amazing recipe!  THANK YOU!  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken so that my vegetarian daughter could enjoy this as well.  I followed teh advice of other and doubled the amount of squash.  Will definitely make again - next time with spinach tortellini I think.

Very good. Used tortellini by mistake, which was def not as good as ravioli. Used two packages of frozen squash, should have used three. Used 3 cups of chicken stock - which was good. Could use more cumin. Cut the water by 1.5 cups. Add something else flavor-wise. Dash of hot sauce?

This was my first time trying butternut squash so I don't know if I just don't like butternut squash or I didn't like the recipe.  It was way too thick for me, I expected more of a tomato soup texture.

Great flavor and texture.  Reduced the stock to 4 Cps and cut out leeks.  It was a nice thick soup. Used cheese ravioli.  Nice presentation.

Awesome recipe!  Didn't have the wine and used vegetable stock instead (vegetarian in the family) and it still turned out great.  I've made it with the chicken broth and wine too.  You can't miss with this recipe!

Great recipe! Easy, tasty, filling. It looks impressive when served too. :)

I didn't have any leeks, so I omitted those. And I added more ginger, just b/c I love it.

Thank you!

This soup is definately a good way to make butternut squash.  I did double the squash this time, and might even add a little more next time around for better texture.  And I used tortellini instead of ravioli.  Great for a cold evening.

Too much work!  My husband and I each ate a little bowl, and no one went back for seconds.  I was left with a huge pot that no one really wanted.  It could have been delicious, but I felt like it was missing something, and even after blending it in a blender the squash gave it a grainy texture.

I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  I also doubled the amount of squash because that flavor wasn't very strong.  I only had wild mushroom ravioli on hand, which was fine, but next time I'll use what the recipe called for.  I will also probably double the amount of butter.  Overall, it's a very good soup!

5 cups broth, 3 cups squash for great consistency. up the spices, add a diced apple.  use puree setting on blender, NOT a hand mixer, that was crazy, mixture splattered everywhere...  the soup/sauce really is very delicious - multiple uses..

This was delicious. Didn't have cream or leeks on hand, so I added an extra onion for the leek and subbed plain yogurt stirred with organic lowfat milk for the cream. Also, I was missing one cup of chicken broth so I added 1/4 extra cup of white wine plus 1/4 cup of sherry. Seasoned with white and black pepper and high-end parmesan cheese at the table. It was delicious. Next time I will try to have heavy cream and leeks on hand -- I love their delicate flavor. But I will keep my touch of  sherry and the white pepper. Yummmmmm.

Incredible. I had expected this soup to be good but the complexity of spinach cheese ravioli with the squash was well beyond what I had anticipated. My modifications were 1) I forgotten the cream 2) I used veggie broth instead of chicken 3) I used a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar  and 4) I used no white wine

This was delicious!  I nixed the leeks and ginger and substituted with a whole sliced apple, softened in a frying pan with water for about 10 min and a bit more cinnamon.  Definitely recommend!

Very delicious, althought when we made this, we had to alter it quite a bit because we were short lots of ingredients. We didn't have any leeks so we just had onions.  We didn't have white wine, so we used red wine instead. We also didn't have any chicken broth, so we used beef broth. We didn't have any ravioli, so instead we used three-cheese tortillini. Despite all of our changes, it turned out absolutely wonderful! It was a neat new way to have butternut squash soup and we will definitely try it again!

This was fantastic!  The ravioli gave it a depth of flavor I wasn't expecting and made it much more asthetically pleasing.  I used mushroom ravioli because I couldn't find spinach but it was still wonderful.

CATHERINE, I THANK YOU!
We simply couldn't believe how good it really was!  I normally try a recipe as written, try again to personalize, then review. But I couldn't wait! In 25 years, I never felt the need to submit a review this quickly.

First off, I bought butternut squash for a different soup recipe. I never cared much for cooking it, much less eating it, but doctors orders! (Ok, dieticians suggestions). Further, I wasn't excited because the recipe seemed lacking, and I frankly don't have the squash cooking experience to correct it. (At least beforehand; I am a taste-n-adjust Master!)

When I found Catherine's recipe today, I was intrigued by the savory spices and knew it would work!

It was a dark and stormy night. Actually, a dreary, rainy afternoon. No way was I going shopping (getting dressed to go OUT?) so these are the adjustments I made: Used cumin SEED; inc 3 cups squash, inc 2 pinch ginger/cinn, inc 1.5 cups onions, omitted leeks, dec 1.5TB butter, added 0.5TB olive oil, sub white zinfandel wine, sub lowsodium broth, sub watered down heavy cream, sub cheese ravioli, added 1.5 cups fresh spinach. Because this was for supper, I added 1/2 lb. shrimp. Pureed squash mixture in blender (white cabinets). Cooked ravioli according to package:4 minutes. Used fresh ground white pepper, no salt needed.

The soup was slightly sweet, savory, creamy, complex, subtle.....my Word, it's GOOD, especially served with salad and garlic biscuits. All three yummy hot, at room temp, and

This was a great and actually easy meal. I used a Japanese Pumpkin because that is what I had on hand and they are more popular in Australia than Butternut Squash, but they taste about the same. I also made my own spinach and ricotta ravioli from wongton wrappers. I made the soup first and while that was cooking I was able to make the ravioli. When the ravioli was cooking that is when I blended the soup. With that said it was easy to get both parts of the meal completed at the same time. I was able to make this from start to finish under an hour.

I messed this up and it still came out delish! Did not have cumin, spinach ravioli, or cream; used coriander, mushroom ravioli and 2% milk. "Pureed" (with a blender, so it ended up more like a chowder) before the onion step to leave them whole. SO YUM!!

The only changes I made were to add 1 serano pepper and slightly increase the spices. This was very flavorful. I had to make without a blender or food processor so the texture wasn't as great as it would be with one.

for my first time making anything with butternut squash i was really pleased with how this turned out.  i took the suggestion of a few previous reviewers and roasted the squash first (made it easier to peel since i had no idea how to do that) and added a granny smith apple that i had on hand.  i think that the apple made the soup a bit sweeter than it would have been otherwise and it was a bit too sweet on it's own.  but with the savory spinach and cheese filled ravioli that i had it all worked out very nicely.  i'm looking forward to all of the leftovers!

Used double the amount of squash to get the texture I prefer. Used a little more leek too. Used Fat free half and half instead of light cream, which worked okay just be very careful not to let it break by taking off heat right after adding.  This soup was okay, I'm on the fence if I like it. The leftovers are much better than the soup is the same day. Next time I make butternut squash soup I'll try one with curry powder/seasonings, I suspect I'll prefer that to these spices; just my personal preference. The ravioli addition is fantastic, that works really well. I used spinach/cheese filled instead of spinach ravioli that is cheese filled. Thanks for a really interesting soup.

Quite good!  I lowered the liquids to make the squash and ravioli the centerpiece, and it ended up being closer to a stew than a soup.

This was fantastic!  I gave it 4 stars because- as other reviewers have previously stated- the consistency was a bit too thin.  I would add at least 1 extra cup of cubed squash....next time I may try tossing in an apple and a carrot as well.  I put whole wheat spinach and cheese tortellini in this as well as some sage flavored bulk sausage to make it a little heartier as a meal.  A little extra spice may help if you are adding extra squash, but don't over-do it.  The delicate flavor of the squash, wine, and leeks together is what makes this so good!

This was absolutely wonderful. The only difference I did was I cut the squash lengthwise and bakes it in the oven for 1 hour then I scooped it out and added it to the broth and onions to simmer for a little while. When it was purreed its was thick I did not have a thin soup like sime had said.

This was much better than I expected. I got precubed squash on clearance and had some quality spinach ravioli on hand and found this recipe. I am pregnant and didn't have wine in the house or leeks, but I followed everything else precisely. I did only use three cups of broth as other people recommended and because that's actually the exact amount I had to use up in the fridge. Even with these deviations, this was truly delicious. I've had trouble eating raw vegetables in this pregnancy so this just felt nourishing and so good even though it's hot outside!

Will definitely make it again.  I like the mixture of butternut squash and the spinach ravioli.  I added just a bit of light cream and will leave it out next time, just to make it healthy.  Also didn't add wine 'cause don't have it around the house.

This was excellent. I made exactly as written. I agree with some previous posters - it was a tad on the thin side, but I think thickness is a preference thing. Next time I will take away a cup of broth and add a little more squash. A tip: Make sure you soften the onions really well. Mine didn't puree up very well. I was fine with it that way though. The flavor of this dish was spot on.

3 as written.  I did a lot of tweaking.  First of all I added a lot more squash and reduced the amount of broth. 2nd I really didn't think this had much flavor.  I added a lot more spice and even brown sugar.  I guess I am used to sweeter butter nut squash.  I also omitted the cream.  After all of this tweaking it was pretty good and very filling! I didn't like the spinach ravioli but I might try regular next time.  Will def make again with my revisions.

The soup was good as stated but the ravioli didn't do much for me.  I cooked this as a new addition for Christmas dinner and I think we will try it at Thanksgiving too!

This soup came out great w/out changes to the original recipe. I didn't use the ravioli, just served the soup w/ some crusty bread. I like the combination of the wine w/ the spices, but I think next time I'll try vegetable stock instead of chicken, as I thought the chicken taste coming through was a little too much. I'd like to keep it w/ the veggies so that will be my only change! Great soup for the fall and works well as an appetizer.

This soup was fabulous.  My husband has a mental block about soups and doesn't really like them for a meal.  He loved this, and I will definitely make it again.  I tweaked it a little bit.  I used 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of apple cider.  The wine I used was a dry Baldwin apple wine.  I used about 5 cups of butternut squash and still thought it could have been a little thicker.  The flavors were wonderful.  I added a bit of browned butter to the bowls right before serving.  I'll definitely be making this again over the coming fall and winter months.  Thank you!!!

The recipe definitely needed some additives.  I condensed this recipe to feed about 6 people.  I added a chopped carrot, celery stick, one potato, and diced red pepper.  I substituted the cream for skim milk and it came out delicious!  With or without the ravioli is good.

It was pretty good.  I actually do not like onions and didn't realize that leeks were just another kind of onion.  I wasn't able to puree the "broth" like I wanted to so that is something I would definitely change in the future.  I cut cream to skim milk and 1/2 the butter.  Flavor was great though!!!

I modified the soup quite a bit by adding several granny smith apples (I also like to add parsnips, but didn't this time)and some apple cider I had on hand in place of some of the liquid.  What I really liked was the ravioli with the soup.  Some brown butter served on top with parsley is the perfect touch.

This was a really good soup and well received by my family.  I didn't think it needed the ravioli, but if you were looking at it as a meal then definitely add the pasta.

This was pretty good, but I am not sure if I will make it again.  I made the following changes: didn't have any leeks, so used 2 onions; used 4 cups of broth instead of 5; and used tricolor cheese tortellini instead of ravioli.  It did turn out well, but I'm not sure if the flavor is really for me.

good soup- i decreased the stock by 1.5 cups, increased the squash to deepen the flavor, and then added chopped spinach at the end in lieu of the ravioli.  i just did a drizzle of half and half and the dairy wasnt really missed at all.

The spice combination in this recipe is perfect.  I prefer a bit thicker soup, so the second time I reduced the liquied by one cup.  I also thought the cheese ravioli doesn't go well with the soup at all - maybe the spinach would work better, though.

This is definitely good enough to serve for company. Like Catherine said, we just use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. If you're in a big hurry, you can use a couple packages of frozen pureed squash.
