Yum delicious. I have never baked turkey burgers before so this was new. The addition of the egg and crumbs does produce a softer more  meatloaf like texture, which was fine for me. I'll make this again

Made these tonight! Sooo good and moist! I was out of worcestershire sauce, so I used a bit of soy sauce, red wine vinegar and liquid smoke! Keeping this recipe for sure!

I really enjoyed these burgers. I used extra lean ground chicken instead of turkey. Family enjoyed! Thanks!

Dee-lish! Compared it to Chef John's (love him) and substituted cayenne pepper for the hot sauce (my homage to CJ). This was simpler and used whole egg rather than just the whites. Made two burgers with it and meatballs for spaghetti with the rest.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used real parsley. This is my now my burger! Love the flavour.  Love the texture! Even my beef burger connoisseur husband thought it was great. I like mine with mango chutney as a condiment.

More like meatloaf, but delicious. Best turkey burgers made at home so far.

This was a wonderful alternative to AR's "Actually Delicious Turkey Burger," which was a staple until my kids became teens. Now they enjoy a little more spice to their meals. I toasted hamburger buns in my toaster and I eased up a bit on the Sriracha sauce, but we melted a piece of Swiss cheese on each burger, which helped to mellow out the spice. Keeper!

Yummy!
We all enjoyed them.  They were very moist and tasty.

Since people always seem to put this sort of thing...
I ended up only using 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce since the hot sauce I had on hand is really hot.  This worked perfectly for us :-)
Also after mixing everything together the mixture still seemed a bit too wet so I used maybe 1.5-2 tbsp more of breadcrumbs.  The ground turkey I was using was the cause of this (not the recipes fault).  i don't suggest anyone does this by default and instead, like all ground meat mixtures, decide if more is needed only if the mixture is too watery :-)

This was a really good turkey burger. I used fresh chopped and sautéed jalapeños on my burger instead of the Tabasco sauce. Enjoyed this version very much on Organic thin sliced Dave’s killer Bread. Yum!

This was so good! Definitely a keeper!! The only thing different I did, was use fresh parsley not a paste! Soft moist burger!

Awesome and moist. But I used chicken in place of  the turkey. It's what we have here on the farm. These burgers have a really nice, well rounded flavor!

A simple but tasty family favorite. I've also made them in a fry pan with great success. Here at 8000 feet altitude they dry out a bit n the oven.

Made these tonight and they were delicious. Instead of baking I stuffed them with a slice of pepper jack cheese and threw them on the grill

Very good!  The hot sauce gives it a little kick and nice change from my basic turkey burger recipe.   I didn't have the parsley paste so just added dried parsley and I used wheat germ instead of breadcrumbs to make it a little healthier.  It does have the texture of meatloaf like a previous reviewer mentioned-but I liked it.  To keep it low carb I skipped the bun and topped with roasted red pepper hummus and salsa.  SO good!

Used hot sauce as a substitute and put in the freezer for a bit so I could BBQ them. This is now the go to recipe for burgers at our house.

I followed the recipe mostly but replaced the parsley paste with fresh cilantro and cut back a bit on the hot sauce (to about 3/4 tablespoon which I shouldn't have done)since I was serving with a spicy mayo. These ended up sitting in the refrigerator overnight once mixed and grilled the next day.  Those that have trouble with the burgers being soft should add either a bit more bread crumbs or switch to panko style bread crumbs and let the mixture firm up in the refrigerator for a few hours.  These were tasty and a nice change of pace from our normal spinach and feta turkey burgers (also on this site).  Next time I may use a Mexican hot sauce (or use adobe sauce) and top with fresh guacamole instead of cheese. These will go into our burger rotation.

Very good.  My husband, who normally does not like turkey burgers loved them.  I used Sriracha as the as the hot sauce.
