These muffins were quick and economical to make - I halved the recipe and added a little more vanilla (not on purpose, I spilled) and about 1/4 cup more blueberries than called for, and they were DELICIOUS! My husband and son are devouring them as I type this, and I will DEFINITELY make these again (and again and again). If your blueberries all fall to the bottom, try rinsing them BEFORE coating them with flour next time. If your batter isn't rising - perhaps your baking powder is stale. Keep it in the fridge, and buy fresh every four months or so. It goes stale fairly quickly, so buy small containers unless you do a LOT of baking.

These muffins are fantastic with chopped apricots, and with chopped apples and dates :)

This recipe gets 5 stars with the following changes 1) use buttermilk instead of milk and 2) decrease baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons.

I have never tried blueberry muffins from scratch before, but after making this recipe, I will never buy boxed muffins again!  These were so delicious!  I halved the recipe and only made 12, the only thing I did differently was I only used 1/2 of the Baking Powder that the recipe called for, but they turned out wonderfully!!  To keep the blueberry's from sinking, I rinsed them and then immediately floured them.  Then right before I added them to the batter, I floured them a little bit more.  They didn't sink at all!  What a great recipe! ~Amy

Forget all those negative reviews, this was the best - definitely a keeper.  Very light in flavor and low fat!  Make sure to use fresh blueberries and I substituted butter for margarine and it turned out fine.  MMMMMmmm....

My husband loves blueberry muffins so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. However, I have to say I must agree with the other two and three star reviews. Even after substituting buttermilk for the milk and decreasing the baking powder to compensate for the switch I found these to be bland and lacking flavor. Plus, they didn't really have that nice puffy muffin shape I'm used to even after baking these in a Texas sized muffin tin. What a waste of ingredients! I definitely won't be making these again....

These muffins were very easy to make, and smelled delicious in the oven. The taste was kind of bland, definitely not "out of this world." We ate them, but I don't think I'd make them again.

I didn't have any margarin, so I used butter, and it didn't come out good. I didn't like the recipie because it was "cakey". The muffins didn't fluff..so does that mean we should add more baking powder? My husband loved it, maybe it was because he tasted the large blueberries, but I thought it was tasteless. I won't be making this again!!

I'm a professional pastry chef and I tried making these twice. The flavor is bland and sweet, so I added lemon extract and zest the second time around...they were marginally improved. Both times, however, I could NOT get the muffins out of the pan, and I sprayed the pan like crazy. This recipe REQUIRES paper liners if you're going to make them at all.....trust me! And like a lot of other people experienced, they did not rise much. 
I liked the moistness of the muffins, but the flavor was too bland and the rise and difficulty removing them from the pan force me to put this recipe in the ol' "round file."

This recipe was not a success for me. There just was not enough liquid and when they came out of the oven, they were just.....not good. These just did not turn out. I make at least three new muffin recipes a week so I know what I'm doing. Not only have I wasted time/ingredients, now I have to find another recipe that'll work for my Mom's group. Not okay.

Very good! best blueberry muffin yet! Everyone loved them at my house. 
I substituted montana purple huckleberries for the blueberries, and wow it was soooooo good!

Remember (especially if using frozen blueberries) to coat them in flour before adding them to batter, this way the muffins arent blue all over. I didn't learn this till my 4th blueberry muffin attempt! :) 
mmmmmmmmmmm!

Not bad.  A little on the bland side, but they fluffed up great.  I found the sugar about right, but only needed to bake them for about 19 minutes or they were overdone

These turned out to be the best blueberry muffins i have ever made from scratch. I confess...i like the box mix kind...cause they to taste good:) These were easy in ever way...and they looked great. My only problem with them..and i am really amazed no one else has mentioned this..is..they call for 4 tsp of baking powder. Everytime i bit into one..i could taste this:( Im not sure if its cause i made them...and i knew how much went in...but none the less..i taste it all the time. Maybe i should try decresing this next time..and see how they turn out. If i could get rid of that baking powder taste..they would be the best:)))))

Okay now, tell the truth.  This is really cake masquerading as a muffin!  As I creamed the butter and sugar and then mixed in the flour alternating with milk I realized this was the classic method of making a cake batter, rather than the "don't stir too much, leave the lumps in" method of making muffins.  No matter -- it's really good.  And if you don't tell anyone you can get away with eating cake for breakfast!

These muffins are incredible. To reduce cholesterol, I substitute 3 egg whites for the 2 eggs and 1/4 cup canola oil for the butter and they are still "out of this world"

these are pretty good. a few things: everyone who's saying that their muffins didn't rise, mixed the batter too much!! muffins will NOT rise if you over-mix it. mix the batter just barely enough to wet it, maybe 3 or 4 strokes. 
i also only used 1.C sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), and butter instead of margarine. 
also, use liners!!
let them cool before you eat them. they don't peel well from the liner if hot.

these were definitely moist, fluffy, and cake-like.  the blueberries sank to the bottom and i didn't use too many or cover them with flour so i have no idea why.  i tried the recipe a second time with mini chocolate chips and used 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, more vanilla, 3/4 c milk, 6 tsp. of butter (the extra butter helped them to stay moist for next-day eating).  be careful to only fill containers 2/3 of the way and use all-purpose unbleached flour (two mistakes i made the first time around).  happy baking and thank you nora!!

I make these every Saturday morning! They are delicious! Plus they are really easy (I'm only 15). They are also really good when you substitute the blueberrys for chocolate chips. Mmmmmm.

I'm on the fence about this one.  Personally, it kind of tasted like muffin mix from the grocery store.  The only change I made was to add one cup of sugar, and that was plenty.  I usually bake a more wholesome muffin, so I might try this one again with modifications.

I was so dissapointed with these. I love blueberry muffins, these were not great. Is it because I used butter instead of margerine? I hate margerine, so I used butter.
They didnt "puff up" very well and all of the berries did go to the bottom as others had said. I followed the recipe exactly except for using butter.
I wont make these again.

I love this recipe! It's delicious and I've made it multiple times. I've even experimented a bit by using whole wheat flour, strawberries alone and adding strawberries and blueberries together. It comes out delicious any way i make it.

I can't say enough about these blueberry muffins.  These are the best muffins I've ever tasted.  I did not find them too sweet as previously commented.  I actually added more blueberries then what the receipe called for and it was great.

These muffins were both quick and easy but I didn't think they had more flavor than muffins made from a box.  I probably won't bother again.

These muffins are really good. I lost
count of how many times I had made them.
It is well received by everybody who had
tried them. Instead of fresh blueberries,
you can use frozen blueberries as well.
If you want the muffins to have brownish
looking top, you can leave the muffins in
the oven for another 3-5mins. Try it, you
will love it.

I just made these muffins today. I substituted self rising flour for the all purpose flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla, but kept everything else the same. 
After letting the muffins cool a bit. I took them out the pan and found them to be delicious. I did coat the blueberries but they still sunk to the bottom of the pan. I really like that about the muffins. 
This is a great muffin recipe and my first blueberry muffin recipe from scratch. I give this recipe four stars!

I thought these turned out really well - i was expecting some dry low fat muffin that i would force my way through - au contraire - they were quite tasty!  i used frozen wild blueberries [all that was available], and skim milk - everything else the same.   yum yum

These are tasty muffins - my husband ate 3 for breakfast.  I did cut the recipe in half to get 12 muffins, but only ended up with 10.  I chose to grease my pan, but it would have been better to use liners for these.  The batter is very wet, and the muffins were kind of sticky and hard to get out of the pan.  Even though I coated the berries with flour, many still sank and were left in the muffin tin.  But, the flavor of the muffins is great.  They are sweet, almost cake-like and the top gets a little crunch to it while baking.  If it weren't for the fact that my husband is still raving over them, I probably would not make again.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because of my few changes, but these are SUPER YUMMY! I halved the recipe, leaving the vanilla and salt in the original amounts.  I also used less sugar than called for: 1/3 c white sugar and 1/3 c brown sugar. I used 2/3 c AP flour and 1/3 c whole wheat flour. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used 1/2 c blueberries and 1/2 c chopped strawberries. I was also very lazy with the prep, I mixed all of my wet ingredients including the softened butter in a big bowl and then stirred in the dry ingredients before adding the floured fruit, this didn't make any difference in the texture. Love them!!

Very tasty! I gave this recipe 4 stars because I made changes, so not sure how it would have been if I followed the recipe exactly. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, almost doubled the vanilla, sprinkled in some cinnamon, and threw in a dollop of sour cream. Also, I used frozen blueberries because that was what I had on hand. They were on the most amazing muffins I have had ever, but they were good. I would make them again.

I made these today and the hubby taste tested them. He rarely gives anything a 5 star rating. This time is no exception. He said the only reason they don't get a 5 star is because all the fruit settled at the bottom. I found the batter quite runny compared to standard batter and even tho the pans were sprayed with baking spray, they came out of the pan very difficult and they don't appear that nice brown color on the bottom like they are on the top.  They didn't puff up like muffins usually do either. Very yummy though! I don't know if maybe I should add a little flour next time? Definite potential for a 5 star.

These are the perfect intersection of taste and health.  They are low in calories and fat and have a nice, light texture and a nice sweetness.  I don't understand some of the negative ratings at all.  Give them a try!

I thought these muffins were just wonderful.  They were so moist and sweet and full of berries.  I followed the recipe exactly and although they didn't rise too much, they did not stick to the muffins tins at all.  Great recipe that my whole family enjoys!!

I followed the recipe exactly except, I used Butter instead of Margarine because that is what I had and I was short one egg and added a half a banana instead and these are the best muffins I have ever tasted. I'll be making these again!

First time making muffins from scratch and they turned out really tasty. I wasn't sure what creamed margarine should look like, so I mixed it a little bit then added the sugar - it looked like crumbs - followed the rest of the instructions. The end result was really good. Thank you for sharing!

Not bad but not that good either.  The blueberries sunk to the bottom because the batter was pretty thin.  This was edible but not worth the effort or the calories in my opinion.

My daughter is super picky and wanted blueberry muffins yesterday. For some reason I didn't stick with the ol' Betty Crocker recipe and decided to try this one. Dumbest decision of the week. First batch was burnt before they were half cooked (I'm assuming my stupid nonstick bakeware had something to do with it.) However, second batch in paper cupcake cups came out no better. They've stuck to the paper. All the berries are all at the bottom of the muffin. Picky eater won't eat them and I'm not planning on it either.

Fantastic!  Half of the flour I used was whole wheat for added fiber, and I accidentally doubled the blueberries to four cups.  Really moist and sweet.  Loved them.  I'll make them exactly the same way next time.

Nice traditional blueberry muffin when made strictly from the recipe.  I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and increased the baking powder 1/4 tsp. to add more loft.  They only need to start browning on the edges - brown on top is overdone!

These tasted good but never puffed up like a muffin should, in spite of the baking powder.  I wanted a sugary cinnamon top so I used the recipe from the other blueberry muffins on the alternating page of the cookbook.  Strangely, they soaked right in.  I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time - definitely use muffin liners.  The first batch I used spray oil and the muffins did not come out at all.  They fell apart as I was carefully trying to get them out of the pan with a knife.  The next batch, I used the liners and they came beautifully.  I would make these again - does anyone have a better way to get the tops to puff up?

Despite the high ratings and the fact that allrecipes chose this for their cookbook, I was not at all impressed with this recipe. The taste wasnt bad but it was more like blueberry biscuits then blueberry muffins. That's the best way to describe the texture: biscuit-like. It was not at all like I was expecting.

This receipe creates excellent, traditional-style blueberry muffins that are light and sweet! Yummy! They are easy to make and came out great for me. I used paper liners and took them out of the oven after about 22 minutes.

Sweet, moist, sticky--USE paper liners! My BF is a fan of Otis Spunkmeyer muffins and he LOVED these. I used 1/2 cup margarine and added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon. Next time I'll try a little less cinnamon and add a little lemon zest. Coat the blueberries with flour while they're still wet so they won't sink to the bottom or pop in the muffin.

Tasted okay, but the muffins stick and now we can't get them out.  We took a few out while they were hot and they just fell apart.  Left the others to cool and now we are trying to get them out, but just the tops come out. You have to use paper liners if you do this recipe.

These muffins were good. I made these for a party. As soon as I put them out, they were gone. People asked for the recipe and they asked me to make them again. The only downfall to this is the muffins easily break apart when you take them out of the muffin pan. Other than that they are good.

I was really disappointed in these muffins. The batter was too light. The berries all dropped to the bottom, the muffins didn't rise at all, and it almost turned out like a cobbler. I won't be making these again

I strayed from my usual blueberry muffin recipe in favor of a change and I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very cake-like to me and that's not really what you're looking for when you make muffins. Could have been better with some tweaking but don't wish to try these again.

This is my go-to blueberry muffin recipe. I substitute splenda granular for the sugar (and I only use 1c instead of 1.5c) and sugar-free vanilla yogurt for the margarine to cut down on the fat and calories. I also use frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and they turn out perfectly every time.

fast, easy and delish! Made these for a play date for moms and kids. they were gone quickly. I was looking for something quick with common ingredients and this fit the bill. Much better than the boxed muffins. I thought they had a great taste and were plenty sweet as written. I made no changes. will make again.

Pros: easy to make, tasty, good texture.  Cons: a bit too sweet.   Next time I'll sub in some whole wheat flour and ground flax, and see if I can't reduce the sugar as well.

Fantastic recipe!  I just made these last night but made a few adjustments.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and then changed 2 cups all purpose flour to 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup freshly ground flax seed.  I also added 1/4 cup of raspberries.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating these when they came out of the oven!

These muffins were awesome!!! :D

I halved the recipe, used 2 TBSP applesauce and added 2 more TBSP of canola oil. I made some with butter+flour+sugar crumble topping, some without. Both versions were wonderful! I'll be making these again in the future :) but next time, I will spray the paper liners before putting the batter in.

Turned out very good. I added a bit more blueberries as well as vanilla. Mine didn't rise much but didn't flatten either. I think the issue that some may have had is due to over-mixing. Remember that with muffins it is important to mix just enough otherwise they won't rise. Most recipes will tell you to mix just enough to moisten so that may help. Overall good muffins though!

I have been looking for years for a decent make-at-home blueberry muffin.  I need not look further.  These are FANTASTIC.  The muffin batter itself I bet will make for many other great muffins.  I'm going to try using mixed berries, cinnamon swirl, and maybe a kahlua chocolate.  Thanks so much for the recipe Nora!!!

These blueberry muffins were excellent for being lowfat. Mine only needed to bake for only 20 min. I made no changes to the ingredients. They may seem a little bland compared to the high fat recipes, but I found them to be delicious and they made a nice crisp exterior (I didn't use muffin cups) that gave a good texture. Also- they were very light and fluffy.

I should have followed my instincts from years of baking and reduced the temperature to 350 degrees because these were overbaked (Thankfully I pulled them out before the end of the 25 minutes or else they would be inedible).  Plus, the direction to "mix well after each addition" of milk and flour goes against everything I've ever learned about baking muffins.  That's why they turn out cakey instead of light and fluffy as other have said.  Perhaps the unusually high amount of baking powder has something to do with it as well.

I would not use this recipe next time.

Love this recipe!  I always use frozen blueberries because we rarely have fresh ones.  These always turn out great.  Even my daughter who claims to hate blueberries eats these.

These muffins are out of this world!!  I usually bake cookies and other desserts, so baking this recipe popped my muffin cherry (or should I say, blueberry, hehe).   First batch, I used fresh blueberries, which were kind of on the large side.  Muffins came out super moist and yummy and got rave reviews from my boyfriend.   However for the  second batch, the grocery store was out of fresh blueberries so I used frozen organic blueberries, which were smaller in size.   The muffins still came out wonderfully moist and delicious, and the distribution of the berries seemed more even and not so bulky as the first batch when I used fresh berries.    A note though about the frozen berries: I did let them sit out on the counter for about 10-15 mins while I prepared the other ingredients.

These really are GREAT blueberry muffins! I love the blueberry muffins from Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes and this recipe is the closest I've found to those deliciously awesome muffins. I didn't have fresh blueberries and used some frozen ones, but they still turned out great!

These are great. You can reduce the sugar by 1/4c and they are still great. The batter was fine. I think Susan Brooks didn't follow the recipe correctly.

Soooo delicious!!I followed recipe except when I went to make I was short on blueberries, so I divided the batter in half and mixed the other half with dark morello cherries(from trader joes).I used star shape tins and 25min was exact for cooking.Great recipe!

These were great muffins. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I had trouble creaming. It felt like there wasn't enough butter. This could have been caused by me halving the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe.  Simple and easy.  The touch of vanilla is amazing :)  I double the recipe, make half blueberry the other half chocolate chip muffins for the other family members who don't really care for blueberries.  I don't understand the reviews of some people who give it only 2 or 3 stars.  I love this muffin recipe, as does every one I know as well :)

Pretty good muffins,the only changes I made was reducing the flour for blueberries and using my homemade apple sauce in place of the butter. Mine were done cooking after about 20 mins... so keep an eye on the oven!

I enjoyed these muffins.  I only gave 4 stars because I made a few changes and that may have cause the issue.  I used frozen blueberries, soy milk and butter.  I let the blueberries thaw a bit before I coated them in the flour.  I also left the muffins in the oven for a few minutes over the suggested time.  But all in all they were good.  I will make these again and increase the amounts so I could really end up with 24 normal size muffins instead of the 15 normal and 9 "mini" ones

I adore this recipe. It's easy to make and everyone loves them. 
The only problem I have with it is that my blueberries always sink to the bottom of the muffin... I've tried fresh, frozen, and dried blueberries and all produced the same results. However, these are the best blueberry muffins I've ever made!

I halved this recipe and used applesauce instead of margerine and they are great. Super moist. I used muffin papers so they didn't stick. Using applesauce made the nutrition 107 calories and .7 grams of fat per muffin. Can't beat that!

These turned out pretty ugly. Either 375 is too hot or 25 minutes is too long. Also these stuck to the pan more than any other baked good I have ever made. So grease well, and keep an eye on them while baking. But otherwise they tasted good, despite  appearances.

Divine! Absolutely delicious recipe! I used selr-raising flour instead of plain + baking powder and they turned out well!  Also the quantity made exactly 24 as promised, that hardly ever happens!  I think the berries NEED that amount of sugar to combat any tartness.  The recipe is perfect!

These were by far the worst muffins I have ever made.  I love blueberries and am sorry that wasted them in these.  I cut the recipe in half and it only made 8 muffins. Thank goodness I didn't make 24. If you want to know ahead of time what these muffins taste like, eat a spoonful of baking powder!

Very very delicious muffins!  I absolutely loved these.  I made them in a mini muffin pan, and they came out perfect.  I think next time I will make them in a regular muffin pan, my hubby prefers them that way.  This is definately a keeper!

This was one of the very best muffin recipes I have used. They were moist and tender and the fresh blueberries made them excellent.

I used brown sugar and added some frozen strawberries and raspberries; it still came out wonderfully!  My family ate them all up in one day.  Like other users said it does taste a bit like cake but still a great dessert to take on the go! Very tasty. yum yum

Great recipe!  I used half white flour and half wheat flour, and added about a 1/4 cup of gluten flour.  Also, I replaced the butter with oil.  I did not dust the blueberries with flour (I used frozen), and I use about 1-1/2 cups of blueberries.  My husband couldn't say enough good things about these.

THESE ARE THE BEST! I have found that if you use fresh berries only use 1 3/4 cup.  Fresh berries are MUCH larger than store bought. I did these for a group of senior citizens and now I get requests all the time.  Thank you!

I made these and they are just wonderful!  I did change something, I used half brown sugar instead of all white sugar,and I used a little less baking powder,   and they came out nice and sweet!   I washed my blueberries before coating them in flour, and the didn't sink at all! They stayed even throughout the mixture,  Very good recipe will use it again and would highly recommend.

I had an awful mess.  I used frozen blueberries and butter, not sure if this caused my problem but these stuck to the pan and everyone of the muffins broke as I pried them from the pan.  They tasted fine but do have more of a cake like texture than a muffin should have.  I gave it three starts mostly on the taste and also because I did not stick exactly to the recipe.

These are okay.  They seem to bake fine, so not sure what everyones problems were with rising, I did double the vanilla and made a streusel topping to help with flavor per peoples suggestions. (Streusel topping:1/2 sugar, 3/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup butter- cut with fork until crumbly, sprinkle over muffins before you bake them). I also had a little more blueberries and they were great.  Overall not the Best muffin I have had, but good, I will try another recipe.

This is a super yummy recipe.  I did add 1 cup of sour cream though.  I folded it in with the blueberries at the end.  It makes the taste and texture more creamy.  Very good!

The name definitely fits these muffins perfectly, they are so delicious and moist.  Only thing I changed was I added half of tsp of vanilla bean powder because I didn't have any extract left, other then that I followed the recipe exactly.

I tried it, and I think what really threw me off is this is not what muffin batter is supposed to be like. You have to completely over mix it, and I still had to add extra flour to make it not watery, which throws off the texture of the muffin. (Muffin batter is supposed to be just moistened, not like pancake or cake batter.) It was too sweet for me, which it saying something, as I eat pure sugar sometimes. It has some redeeming qualities, and it might be repairable if I had time to work on it, but personally, I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

These muffins were pretty good. I halved the recipe to make one dozen and they turned out fine. They were a little cakey in texture but I don't mind that. I also didn't think they were too sweet.

I had a bunch of blueberries to use up so I tried this recipe based on reviews. I can't figure out what happened, but mine are flat as a pancake and sunken in the middle. And I used new baking powder.  Despite flouring the berries, they are all stuck at the bottom.  They taste fine--not fabulous--but definately not presentable to anyone besides my family.

I did not read the reviews first.  I had some fresh blueberries my girl had picked and she wanted muffins.  I needed a quick recipe.  Seemed easy and good.  THey did not rise above the muffin tin.  We have not tried them yet.  I think it is strange some have had this problem and some did not.  I did not have 2 cups of berries so I cut the recipe in half.  I rechecked to make sure I did not mess anyhting up and I did not.s

Quite good - although I did make alterations. I added grated orange peel and used buttermilk instead of milk. Turned out yummy!

Read more into the reviews after I already made them.  They did not "rise" at all.  Fell pretty much flat to the top of the liners.  The flavor was pretty good, but I had awesome blueberries.   Maybe a little too much blueberries.  The flour coating does not need that 1/4 cup...just a light dusting.  I will try another.

Simple, kids loved them, and that's my rating meter.  It was fun to make something that didn't come in a box in almost the same amount of time.  Love this site for that.  Except I made 12 muffins with it.  Making 24 was like eating one bite of a sandwich.  But that's just household preference.

They didn't rise real well, but I expected that. The texture was good, but they were a little too sweet for my taste. I'll keep looking for "the perfect blueberry muffin" recipe.

What a waste of ingredients!  I should have read the reviews.  I think the problem is because of the 1/4 cup of margarine.  That's not enough fat in proportion to the sugar.

I'm not sure if it was something I did or not, but these didn't turn out as good as I had hoped. They didn't puff up nicely as I had hoped, and instead seemed a little "airy" on the inside. Also, I followed the directions about coating the blueberries well and most of them still sank. Overall, these were just ok flavor wise. The good thing is that they were one of the healthiest I could find on allrecipes at the time.

I agree that thes muffins tasted great.  I didn't give 5 stars because I didn't like that they didn't rise.  I didn't care for their flat appearance and was looking for a domed muffin top.  The blueberries did remain evenly dipersed throughout the muffin and they tasted good.  If you don't mind the flat top it's a great recipe.

I made this recipe this weekend with fresh picked blueberries. YUM! They weren't the best muffins EVER, but they were quite tasty and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and did not have the problems others had - my muffins had no problems rising and the blueberries did not sink, etc. I thought the flavoring was quite good.

These muffins are very sweet.  I used butter instead of margarine and it worked well.  I would recommend waiting until they are completely cool to eat.  They do not peel well from the muffin liners while they are still hot.  Overall a great recipe.

I read all the reviews, but decided to try it anyway. I had recently purchased Baking Powder, and fresh, big juicy blueberries. I couldn't keep my fingers out of the batter, it was so sweet and yummy. I just pulled them out, and they were indeed, flat to the top of the muffin tins. No height at all. BUT, the taste is WOW! I followed the recipe exactly, wetting the berries, then flouring them. they are so big and heavy, I am not surprised that they went down, but not all did. I ate it upside down like another reviewer, and Yummylicious!
I wonder if I can freeze them successfully so I don't eat them all tomorrow. Hehehe!

while the muffins barely rose, and the blueberries did sink to the bottom causing us to eat the muffins upside down - the taste was GREAT!  Even with the problems of baking them, we will definatly be making them again.

These were great muffins- I used applesauce instead of the butter, made half of the flour wheat, doubled the berries, and threw in some cinnamon and a bit extra vanilla.  Healthy and delicious!

Yeah..these lasted almost 15 minutes after I put them out for everyone to enjoy at brunch. Everyone wanted the recipe and I was told to triple the recipe for later brunches. Awesome!

My boyfriends ate an entire nearly two dozen of these in two days. They're incredibly light and sweet, not to mention easy to prepare.

These were amazing...a little sticky coming out but worth it. Wonderful hot and even better cold. Use muffin liners.

This recipe is sooo GOOD! I made these for a beach trip since we were leaving early and they were wonderful. The texture of these muffins is what i have been looking for. My husband (who doesn't like blueberries, or so he says) asked me what happened to them because I took them and he couldn't find them. Fresh blueberries were wonderful in these muffins. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe.

Quick enough, yes.  Tasty, yes.  Kids loved them.  I had reduced the recipe for 12 servings, but found that the blueberries all sunk to the bottom and stuck to the paper liners.  What did I do wrong?

These are like  cake..but are really good!! 
I love blueberry mufins. Always have since I was a kid..
much better than store brought...and can be easy made low-fat..
the only thing is the recipe says to "coat" the blueberrys in flour...making them sink to the bottom 
if you are making this for the first time, and don't want this to happen leave out the flour on the blueberrys
THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL RECIPE :o)

Two cups blueberries are too many(they tend to sink to the bottom of muffin). Cut back to 1 1/2 cups. This batch was just enough to fill a xxtra large muffin pan. Good tasting, good recipe.

This is a really good recipe but you have to add some lemon zest to make it amazing! It changes the taste from ok to yum! I added a little bit more milk to make it less dry, only added 1 cup of sugar and a handful more blueberries. So good!

They are OK - I definitely wouldn't say out of this world.  Even after following advice of others and washing and flouring the berries, they still all fell to the bottom of the muffins.  The batter was yummy, but once baked a bit of a disappointment.  The search continues for the best blueberry muffin...:)

They were pretty good....my blueberries fell to the bottom though and the muffins themselves were kind of spongy....not light and fluffy. But they still had a decent flavor.

Delicious!  I quadrupled the recipe to make for our daughter's class and had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand--frozen wild blueberries, mix of soy and cows milk, 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown w/about 1/4 c. of honey (I couldn't bring myself to use 3 cups of sugar!)  I also substituted vegetable shortening and coconut oil for the margerine and lemon extract for the vanilla--they were lucious!  Next time I'll substituted 1/2 of the white flour w/ whole wheat.

They taste good, I'm not satisfied with how flat they are. I thought maybe if I put more batter in the cup they would muffin top over, but they still turned out flat, which is what I didn't want. Other than that it's an easy recipe with an excellent tasting final product.

My sisnter n law found this recipe on this sit adn passed it on to me.  We go blueberry picking every year and then come home and make these muffins.  I think they are delicious.  My family loves them also. I have also used splenda instead of sugar and it works out very nicely.

I fiddled with the recipe quite a bit to make it more healthy.  I used all whole wheat flour, cut the sugar to 1 cup, 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs, applesauce instead of oil and added about 1/4 c. wheat germ and 1/4 c. ground flax seed.  I would not suggest substituting all of the oil with applesauce.  I think it makes the muffins stick to the liners.  Maybe use 1/4 cup each?  Also, watch the muffins carefully as they bake.  Mine didn't need anymore than 20 minutes at 375.  I overbaked them at 23 minutes.  Finally, I would keep all of the sugar in the recipe unless you prefer your muffins a bit more tart.  Overall, my muffins turned out ok.  Nothing special, but still a good breakfast.

Wished I had read the reviews first. As one woman said, "This is an ugly muffin." I agree. The muffins did not rise and the berries sank to the bottom despite coating with flour. Average taste. Much too sweet and odd texture. I kept thinking I made a mistake, but after reading other reviews, I see I didn't. I was disappointed with the results. Won't make again.

These are soooo good! I used butter instead of margarine and did not mix it as much as the recipe called for.  I have been taught that muffin batter should not be beaten, but gently mixed just until batter is no longer dry.  They were just a tad sweeter than I prefer, so next time I will decrease the amount of sugar.

Don't listen to all of the negative reviews, these were very yummy, everyone loved them!  I made two minor adjustments: only added 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and added 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs. Will make again!

I used non-stick spray w/ flour and had no problem getting the muffins out of the tin.  They are a little sweet for my family but still tasty.  Would make again.

For some reason these muffins turned out terrible.  The texture was wrong and there was way too much sugar.

absolutely the worst blueberry muffins I've ever made. They didn't rise at all. The texture was chewy and it took them forever to cook. I sure am sorry I wasted my berries!

Good recipe, my only complaint is that they do not rise very well, I even filled my cups higher then recommended but they hardly rose at all.  However, the taste was very good, though 2 cups of blueberries was too much and some of the muffins ended up being overloaded by blueberries.  I will definitley make these again, perhaps cutting the blueberries in half or maybe around one and a half cups.  All in all they were very good.

This was a very good recipe for me and my family. My two year old LOVED them. Going to have to make up another batch tomorrow. I did not add the sugar but instead used 3 tablespoons of honey and it was perfectly sweet. Could have risen a little more....husband liked them but wants me to see what can be done about the rising issue.

These were really good, although they weren't the best I've ever had.  They were a little bland, but had a lot of blueberries!  The insides of my muffins were practically totally blue!  I'll make these again.

These were delicious! We had tons of berries last week, and I had run out of ideas for them! This was a little involved, but the results were out of sight. My muffins were flat and stuck to the pan-i'm not sure why, but we dug every last one of them out-they were so good.

My family loved this recipe!  The kids and my husband devoured these muffins! I loved how easy they were to make and that I had no leftovers!  I ate the first blueberry muffin thinking that if it wasn't very good I could always whip up a glaze to make it taste better. It did not need it, this recipe was sweet enough and the flavor of the blueberries took center stage.

I've made lots of blueberry muffins using different recipes, so rather tweaked this one before trying it out. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and I added a teaspoon of lemon extract.  I also made raspberry muffins using this recipe. Moist & tasty muffin!

I added only 2.5 teaspoons of baking power vs. the full 4.  I used paper liners for half and baked right in the pan for half.  Baked in the pan is far better.

These muffins taste good for the first 2 bites or so. Them it stats to taste like baking powder. This has happened for me before with other recipes. I had read a review that said too only add 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. I would definitely suggest putting less than 4 teaspoons. If I make it again, I would put less in, like I meant too. As of right now, I won't make it again.

I've made blueberry muffins before and I have used several different recipes, but this recipe is by far the BEST one I have ever used. My husband and mother in law thinks so too. Instead of making muffins I used fresh blueberries and made a cake. It was very moist and very good.

I think this recipe is very good!  I made 24 mini muffins and 10 regular sized. My 14 year old son ate 4 before they were even cooled completely. I will make this again.HOWEVER, I didn't use liners for the mini's and had to coax them out of the tin.Definitely need to use liners in the pans.  :)

FANTASTIC!! I ended up adding a bit more milk as the batter seemed a bit thick and I replaced the vanilla extract with half almond extract and half maple extract and it tasted like pancakes! I had no problem with the muffins rising... I will definitely make these again!!

I followed the recipe exactly but substituted buttermilk for the milk and folded in the dry ingredients instead of beating with a mixer as others suggested.  These were a strange texture-- too done on the outside, very little rise and not at all brown the top.

This recipe is one of our favorites. I make them every so often. I have tried them with fresh blueberries, frozen, and canned. I agree with the other people who recommend decreasing the sugar. They are plenty sweet with 1/2 C sugar when using canned blueberries or 3/4 C for fresh or frozen. But other than that modification, they fluff up nicely, have a light and airy texture, and are always gone within a couple of hours at my house!

These were OK, but I had many of the same problems others reported.  I rinsed and floured the blueberries, but they still sank to the bottom which made the muffins tear apart from the weight.  I used fresh baking powder, but they still failed to rise.  The batter tasted sweet, but the muffins did not.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

This recipe is the GREATEST! It is so so tasty. I am very happy to have found it. My husband will not eat any of my baking, but he will eat these muffins. He said he will be very upset if I ever lose this recipe. I tried it with mixed berries and it was just as wonderful. ENJOY!

These muffins taste great, but the blueberries sank to the bottom despite following the advice to flour them well. This made them hard to eat, as the weight of the fruit pulled the bottom out of each muffin. We solved the problem by eating them upside down!

Great blueberry muffins!! I added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon & a tad more vanilla. Next time I intend to put in about 1/2 cup walnuts. This recipe is absolutely a keeper. I also cut down the baking time down to 21 min. Hubby
loved them also!

Very disappointed. I followed directions to the tee, but my blueberries still sank and formed a mushy mess. The muffins rose just a tad, but fell instantly when they came out of the oven. Not at all what I had expected here.

YUMMY!  I must admit.. that as i type this.. i'm already on my second muffin.  I'm glad that i halfed this recipe - otherwise i'd be in HUGE trouble!   The only change that i made to the recipe was adding more blueberries.. i mean.. you can never have too much of a good thing.  DELICIOUS muffins, you MUST try these!

These muffins were pretty good, but too cakey for my tastes. Too little flour was one of the problems I think. If you want more of a muffin muffin, the batter should be a lot thicker than it was. But on the whole, satisfactory muffins.
