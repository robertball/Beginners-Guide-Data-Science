Wow these were delicious!!  My hubby even raved over this meatless meal...go figure.  I did have to make two subs, though.  I couldn't find the verde sauce, so I used Herdez Chipotle sauce and added sour cream to it.  Also, I used Queso Fresco as the cheese and it melted perfectly.  A really great meal, and the first time I've made Chili Rellenos.  Thanks, Lindseye
