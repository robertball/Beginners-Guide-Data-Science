Loved it!  I am a fan of blue cheese so this was great.  I did add just a half tsp of fresh minced garlic....it was the hit of the evening, even for my husband who normally turns his nose up at blue cheese! Thanks!

Fabulous recipe.  The sauce was awesome.  I may even double the sauce for the next time I make as it is so delicious.  I used just regular blue cheese instead of name brand Roquefort and added fresh mushrooms.  This will be a family favorite.  I am thinking this sauce would be great on any good cut of meat.

My boyfriend and I have been looking for a gorgonzola sauce recipe similar to the one a highly regarded Philadelphia chef uses but have been unsuccessful.  This is very close to the flavor we were searching for!!!  However, we did not use brandy because we didn't have any at the time but it was still scrumptuous!!!  Now we even use it on pasta.  Very tasty!

This recipe is awesome.  I am on a low carb diet and getting tired of plain meat and this was so good.  I didn't have any brandy so I used wine, Sauvignon Blanc, and it was really good!  A must try.

Wow, this was fabulous!!! I didn't have any brandy on hand so I used Merlot. Very, very good. The sauce could have been thicker, perhaps next time I will add a little flour or cornstarch. I used the leftovers on pasta. YUM! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious sauce but far too rich for our taste to pour directly over the steak.  We served it in small dipping bowls on the side and that was perfect. Not a sauce I'd want to use every time, but delicious for a change of pace.

Fantastic! I also cooked some sliced mushrooms in the pan before adding the sauce ingredients. The mushrooms add a lot to the flavor and the texture. A splash of red wine is nice, too! Thanks!

This is a lovely sauce with a gentle taste of rocquefort.  I added a few peppercorns to the sauce and it was zippy!  Goes very well with mashed potatoes and horseradish.

I feel like the sauce needed a little *something* to kick it up a bit.  I ended up overseasoning the steaks in an attempt to compensate for the sauce - not a good idea.

I found the Sauce to be exquisite and creamy a perfect addition to the mild flavor of the meat and tenderness of the dish. It also went well with vegetable tian and salad with blue cheese crumbls and rasberry vinegarette.

I tried this while camping, so cooking conditions (in the dark) were not the best. We grilled the steaks and I thought the sauce was great! Unfortunately, I was the only one that ate it so I had a lot of left over sauce. I will make this again at home this summer when perhaps I will have more takers on the sauce.
Thanks Cassunfire for the recipe. I appreciate the Hemingway reference.

Good sauce that I would try again with some modifications. Not a brandy lover so would sub balsamic vinegar. Recently went to a restaurant that served steak with an alfredo sauce on top then a few spears of asparagus on top of that and some crispy shoestring fried onions under it-awesome. This recipe could be adjusted to similar by using good parmeson with the cream as well as a little butter to make a rich alfredo sauce and some balsamic vinegar or a little red wine would give some zing to it. Anyway good basic recipe to play with.

I was cleaning out my freezer and found some freezer burned sirloins and broccoli and thought to myself, "how I am I going to salvage this mess?"  This sauce was the only thing that made them palatable! Very delicious, easy to make, and classic. I had a similar sauce to this one at a cafe in Paris; one of my favorite meals of all time. I'm so excited to be able to recreate it at home! Thanks very much for sharing!

This was a very flavorful sauce.  I used Jim Beam whiskey instead of Brandy and seasoned the steaks with steak seasoning pepper.  Very good recipe!

Excellent sauce. It also goes well over asparagus. I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I would make it again.

sauce was very good. only change I made I only had 2 1/2 oz. of roqu. cheese so I added 1/2 oz of Monterey jack.  I read all the reviews and for those of you whose  sauce does not thicken, you probably are not cooking it long enough.  You have to get it hot and whisk, whisk, whisk.  It is ok for it to boil as long as you are whisking.

This recipe was better than I expected & actually turned out quite well. I added a ½ tsp. of minced garlic (in the jar) and added it to the brandy mixture. I used blue cheese instead of Roquefort. Served with buttered egg-noodles. Thanks for the recipe!

Exceptional!  Doubled the cheese (who does like blue cheese on steak) and left out the brandy (not a fan).
Definitely will make again.

Added some corn starch (dissolved in water) while cooking the sauce to help it thicken. Also used white wine as a substitute. Turned out great!

Very nice sauce, I would recommend cutting back on the salt during seasoning since the Roquefort has a distinct flavor.  I would also not worry about substituting Blue Cheese for the Roquefort if you are having trouble finding it.

This has become a staple recipe for me.  I usually like my steak medium rare, but I have a hard time getting big pieces where I live in Morocco, so instead I just go with the flow and let it get extra crispy. And depending on what I've got on hand sometimes I use more or less cheese than is suggested.  

I usually don't have brandy in the house, so I use whatever I have on hand: rum or red wine. Both have worked well. 

Finally,  I usually marinate the steak first using the "Best Steak Marinade in Existence" recipe: 

(http://allrecipes.com/recipe/143809/best-steak-marinade-in-existence/) and combined this is a rich and delicious combination.
