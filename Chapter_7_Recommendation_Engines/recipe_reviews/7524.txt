This was a very good cake that was easy to make. I followed another reviewer's advice and used 2 tsps of lemon extract and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. If you're not looking for a strong lemon flavor, you're going to want to go easier on the lemon. 

You also don't need to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes. I used a hand mixer on a medium setting for less than 5 minutes. I can only assume Eleanor mixes by hand to warrant 20 minutes. Even then, it seems excessive. Just make sure it's completely blended (aka there is no sugar that bears a striking resemblance to instant potato flakes).

It does look like it makes too much batter for one Bundt, I ended up reserving some. Don't. The cake didn't rise enough to warrant my fear.

My only real complaint with the cake is that it really needs a glaze or frosting to really make it pop. There are a couple of glazes suggested by other reviewers, be sure to have the ingredients handy as this isn't really a stand alone cake.

I have been using this wonderful recipe for years. It is important to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes, otherwise the cake may come out on the heavy side. Also, add your eggs one at a time (beating afterwards). When adding the flour and 7-Up, alternate (a little flour, then a little 7-Up) until gone. You will you have the best results if these directions are followed. Lastly, this cake can be time consuming so it is best if you use a stand mixer.

This is like having a piece of sugar heaven!!!.. I have been craving a 7-up cake like my aunt used to  make..This is it!!..I made mine into 6 mini bundt cakes..The only changes I made was I did not beat 20 minutes, I did mine for about 8 minutes..I added 1 teasp. of Vanilla..and substituted lemon juice for lemon extract..It turned out beautiful!!!!...I also made a glaze (1 cup powdered sugar & 2 tblsp milk) and drizzled that over each bundt cake and added a few chopped walnuts to the tops of the ones my husband is taking to work...He loves nuts on anything!!.. If you have any hesitation about making this at all, just do it!!!...Its the best, it really does melt in your mouth!.We have company coming for dinner next week and Im going to make it again so that everyone will have their own mini bundt cake, and that way I dont have to share mine!!! ...LOL

Seven-Up Cake is the BEST cake ever, a classic dessert. It's a tradition in my family, and everyone who tries it, absolutely loves it. There's just something about it that makes it a very special cake.

A few tips: Please cream your butter for a few minutes first on high speed. Then cream the butter and sugar together for 15-20 minutes...knowledgeable cooks know that this makes ALL the difference. Beat for one minute after adding each egg, on a high speed. The egg mixture should be incredibly fluffy. I then add THREE tsp. of vanilla extract, then beat in my flour and 7-UP in stages (one cup of flour, then 2 oz. of 7-UP). Beat for one minute after each 7-UP addition. Finally, add THREE tsp. of lemon extract, and beat it all together. Also, it is very easy to overbake the cake, so start checking it at 50 minutes. 75 minutes is usually way too much. Finally, you can add up to 8 oz. of 7-UP--just play around with the amount that suits your taste. Seven-Up cake is time consuming, but oh so worth it for special occasions!

This cake was Great.  As I was making this cake,  I was a little concerned because I only creamed the  butter and sugar for 5 mins. I tasted some of the batter and it was grainy and then I really started to worry. The recipe calls for you to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes and I did not do so. I started to second guess myself about my decision to cream the butter and sugar for only 5 min instead of the 20 minutes or even the 10 minutes as most reviewers did.  But not to worry,  I put a lemon glaze icing on the cake while it was hot and the cake was WONDERFUL.  This was a relief to have such a wonderful cake and it was so easy to make.  I have to make this cake again next week for a friend,  so I said,  I will at least cream the butter and sugar for 10 minutes just to see if it makes a difference but honestly,  I don't think it will.  I just don't think the cake can get any better but if it does then I will definitely be surprised and the winner. I made this cake for a Saturday event and there was no cake left, so I guess all of our guests felt as I do that this was a wonderful cake. I received many compliments on this cake.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I am a baker by trade for over 37 years.  I always make this recipe.  If you use only cake flour for this recipe, I'm sure you will have a hit on your hands.  My aunt refuses to eat anything else that I bake. I make over 52 different cakes alone but she refuses to try any of them because this is her absolute favorite.  She will be 73 years old December 28th.  I also use Virginia Dare Lemon extract.  I invert the recipe I have for the extracts though.  My recipe calls for 1 T vanilla extract and 1 t lemon extract.  I was given the recipe from a neighbor about 26 years ago after tasting the cake she made. I also never beat my sugar and butter for more than five minutes.

Excellent recipe!  I've been looking for a 7up cake recipe on the Internet for a long time, there aren't too many, but this one is the best.  Made it for my co-workers twice.  The cake did not last one day.  Everyone loved it.  You do not have to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes.  I did it in 10 (my hand was getting achy).  It took my oven 75 minutes to complete the cake.  After you add the flour, do not overbeat or you'll have a gooey middle.  That happened to me once and I think it's from overbeating.  Friends still ate it all up though!  Will make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have used this recipe for years. I did learn to cream the butter and sugar for at least 10 min and not to blend much after the flour is added. This really helped the consistency of the cake.

My husband loved this cake.  Because of other reviews, I decreased sugar a little and used only 1 tsp lemon extract.  It was delicious.  Only problem was it stuck to my nonstick pan (I had sprayed it).  Next time will try a greased pan.  Tastes like sponge cake.  Would be good with a lemon sauce.

I remember making a 7-Up Cake with my mom as a child.  This is the first time I've found the recipe.  I've made it at least 4 times already for various functions and church events.  ALWAYS A HIT!!! I even found a glaze from another recipe. 1C powdered sugar, 2tsp milk, 2tsp lemon extract, slash of 7-Up.  Perfect finish!!!

I grew up in the Midwest eating this bundt cake and other desserts like this.  I had not eaten this dessert in years and decided to bake it for a dinner party.  It turned out perfect and received rave reviews.  The cake was light, moist, and not too sweet.  Use room temperature butter and eggs.  You must beat (I used an electric mixer) the sugar and butter for a FULL 20 minutes.  This is key and essential to a successfully made cake.  After each egg beat for a full minute.  I didn't have lemon extract so I added 5 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and 3 teaspoons of vanilla.

I made this for my hubby's birthday and it was a huge hit.  It was a simple enough recipe that my son helped and got to learn about basic baking principles.    We followed the recipe except for: we used 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp lemon extract, and we added 2tbsp of lemon juice.  It ended up with a great pound cake like texture, with a light and airy lemon flavor.    My mother, who doesn't even like sweets, even liked it!  We will definitely be using this one again.  :-)

This cake is a supreme delight.  I recommend this for anyone. I used to love eating seven up cake at thanksgiving and christmas when I was little.  I hadnt had a made from scratch one since I was 10 or 12.  I am so glad I decided to attempt this one.  Will surely be making it over and over again.  I'll be looking for the perfect glaze recipe.

This cake is a winner!  I've been making it for years.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp lemon extract.  Beautiful cake that always gets rave reviews.  A sugar glaze is an excellent choice instead of powdered sugar.

Yummy!  I did change this just a tad.  I creamed the butter first and then added the sugar.  Creamed those together for about 10 minutes.  After adding the eggs, I added a tsp. of vanilla.  The rest of the recipe was the same.  Turned out great!!!  I glazed the cake with a lemon-lime glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, few tsp of 7-up, a tsp of lemon extract) and garnished with some lemon and lime zest and some mint springs.  Lovely!!

This is the same recipe that my mother gave me years ago.  I had lost it and was glad when I saw this one.  To the other readers I had the same problem with the cake sticking to the pan.  The trick to this is letting the cake cool off for about one hour and take a butter to loosen the cake around the cake pan and the cake should slip out easily.

I have been making this 7 up Cake for over 30 years now with only 2 changes. I use cake flour instead of all purpose flour and 2 tablespoons lemon extract, instead of teaspoons. It is a delicious lemon flavored pound cake-like with a crunchy top. I put no glaze or powdered sugar because it does not need it. It is a family favorite with both kids and adults.

This was a great cake! I made it for Easter and my whole family loved it! .. its definitely a keeper and I will be passing this recipe along!  I glazed the cake with a glaze that consisted of confectioner's sugar, lemon extract, vanilla extract, and milk. I think the glaze is neccesary!

Directions are very easy to follow.  Baking time took about 90 minutes in my oven and I used a bundt pan.  Will make again.  This is the perfect recipe to use for a first time cake baker (from scratch).

Made this for my husband and he loves it!!! He says to rate it a five, so that's what I am going to do. I made some minor additions such as putting a glaze on it and using cake flour, but it still was good!

This cake was simply delicious even my two year old stated this! I would have gave the cake 5 stars; however, the recipe called for 3 cups sugar..Per other reviews I only used 2 and the cake came out wonderful...Also, I didn't creme the butter and sugar for 20 min only about 8 min.. I also used a cream cheese and powered sugar icing and the cake was just the right sweetness withouth being too sweet... 2 cups powered sugar and 8 oz cream cheese and  3 tsp milk and vanilla extract...This is a wonderful recipe....

This is a very good recipe. I was initially surprised by another review that talked about the 'egginess,' but I was even more surprised that I actually AGREE. Next time I'll try 4 eggs and see what happens. I didn't think I'd actually cream the butter/sugar for 20 minutes, but I did. That may have been because my butter was still somewhat cold (and the recipe doesn't specify softened butter - perhaps intentionally). It took the full 20 minutes for the mixture to stop looking like packed sand and to no longer stick to the sides (using a stand mixer). As for the cake sticking to the pan, I'm a BIG fan of Baker's Joy spray (flour and oil in a can). Mine literally slipped out of the bundt pan with a perfectly uniform golden brown crust.

UPDATE: I made this and froze it for a couple days. It tasted WAY better after-the-fact. The egg flavor could be a result of the cake still being warm from the oven. I'll still try 4 eggs next time as an experiment. Absolutely let the cake completely cool!

I made this pound cake just because I was bored and wanted to bake something. This is the best cake I have ever made. It was a hit with my co-workers and my husband. Made it exactly to the T. Also made the icing using one of the other members review. Great Recipe! Thanks! I used the icing recipe from maramarie on this cake's review.

This was very easy to make, although a little time consuming. So far everyone who has tried it has liked it! It is very easy to add toppings (fresh strawberries, lemon glaze) to it to make it look harder. Thanks for the great Recipe!

Made this wonderful cake as an Easter dessert this year/2012.  I used about 3-4 Tblsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of the lemon extract. 
I also followed the advice of one review that had said to alternate the flour, lemon juice and "7-Up".
I used Sierra Mist soda because thats what i had in the house. Made a lemon glaze using 1 cup Powered Sugar, milk & lemon juice to taste & aquire more of a drizzle consistancy. 
I will make this cake again & again! YUM!!!

This recipe was given to me by a friend. I made it last night, the first time for a bundt cake. I was very disappointed. I baked it at 325 for almost 2 hours. The outside was crusty and the inside wasn't quite done.

This is a great recipe. I have found the creaming the butter and sugar does make the cake a bit less dense but its not the end of the world if you don't.  I also find that buttering and flowering the bunt pan works much better than non-stick cooking spray.  I add a little more lemon extract and like to ice my 7up cake with icing made from confectioners sugar, lemon extract,  vanilla, 7UP and a drop of milk. Put the icing in a zip-lock sandwich bag, snip the corner and go to town. I posted pics. People love this cake. It is a bit time consuming but so worth it.

THis cake was good but I think blending for 20 min was not as helpful.  I think a good 8 min should do it.

Incredible! Made no changes and everyone loves it. Have brought it for bake sales and everyone asks me for the recipe. I top it off with some powdered sugar and fresh strawberries. Couldn't thank you enough for sharing this recipe!! I'd give it 10/10 stars.

my husband is from New Orleans and his favorite is 7-up cake.  I made this for him and he loves it!  The only changes I made were I added a tsp vanilla and instead of lemon extract i used real lemon juice about 6 tsp; I also drizzled on top some powdered sugar mixed with a little milk

What delicious cake!  I really didn't know what to expect as I have never had 7-up cake before, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I like the crunchy outside crust, with the lighter inside.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  I only mixed the butter and sugar for about 5 mins. by hand, being sure that the sugar no longer resembled instant potatoes, as one reviewer mentioned.  I took turns adding the flour and soda, a third of it at a time, being sure not to over mix.  I baked it for 60 mins.  I would make this again.

I have made this recipe for years with my mom and grand-mother. The only difference is that we use 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.  We also use 12 oz of 7-up.  This is a delightful recipe please try you can't go wrong

this was a wonderful cake! as others suggested, I only creamed sugar and butter for 10 minutes and that was plenty enough. I sprayed my pan with Crisco with flour(in light blue can) for baking and had no problems with the cake sticking. I also only used 2 cups of sugar(3 seemed a little excessive), used lemon juice instead, and used 1 cup of lemon-lim beverage and it came out perfect. I took to work for a potluckand it was gone in minutes. will definitely use again! Thanks :)

Very good tasting cake! I just left the butter and sugar in the mixer for about 8 minutes.
NOTE- DO NOT use an ornate or intricate bundt pan. Mine has a very complicated pattern, and I couldn't get the cake out! I think something about the carbonation makes the pan grease loose its powers somehow!

I've made this cake several times.  If you beat the butter/sugar for 20 min. as printed it works the best, makeing the cake light and fluffy texture.  I tried not beating the required time and the cake was a little gummy, still great.

My family and friends now request this cake.  I also used fresh lemon juice/zest instead of the lemon flavoring and it was great.  Love this cake!!

This is the second time I made this cake.  First time I didn't grease the Bundt pan well and while it was delicious it was a broken up mess.  Did it right this time and added a light lemon glaze.

I always wanted a recipe that made a 7-up cake like my grandmother used to make, I have found it! This is GREAT! My only problem is I cannot seem to get it to come out the pan without a SLIGHT tear! I am trying to get it together! THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE!

My family loved this cake.  I used lemon and vanilla flavorings.  Separating the egg whites and folding them in later, makes it lighter also.  Excellent cake.

This had a great taste but just didn't seem to get done.  I cooked it 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated and there was an still an area that was mushy.  Maybe setting the temp to 350 would work better.

Moist, delicious and a perfect texture. This will be the only pound cake recipe I'll be using. The butter and sugar should be creamed for the full 20 minutes for the best results. A knowledgeable cook knows that the proper creaming of sugar and fats create the structure of a good cake.

The cake was really good. I cut back a cup of sugar, and increase the soda to 1 cup. I used two eight inch round pans and bake for 45 minutes. It was kind of hard to get out of the pan, but tasted pretty good. Maybe cut back on the lemon extract next time. My family said that it was strangely addictive too. :D A keeper, will definately repeat.

Excellent recipe.  Changes I made were reduce sugar to 2 1/2 c and 1 c. of lemon-lime soda.  Used glaze as suggested by others
of 1 c. powdered sugar, lemon juice, and milk or hot water.

This cake was easy to make and delicious. I creamed the butter and sugar only for 10mins as recommended by other reviews.Also I used lemon juice instead of extract and it was not lemony enough.Next time I'll try the extract. The cake turned out very moist and dense. Everyone thought it was awsome.

I made this cake for thanksgiving and it was a big hit!  I am allergic to citrus (lemon, lime, etc...) but after I heard how good and moist the cake tasted I could not resist taking a bite!  IT WAS YUMMY!  I borrowed the following icing recipe from the other 7 up cake that is listed "7up III" which made the cake TOTALLY DELISIOUS... 

To Make Icing: In a saucepan combine the 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, 3 eggs, coconut, pineapple and nuts. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture is thick. Pour over cake while cake is still hot and icing is bubbling.

This was my first 7UP cake and it came out very moist and fluffy.  I substitued Cake Flour for the All Purpose flour and used real butter and lemon juice instead of extract. Everyone loved it and now I'm a super star!

This is one of the best pound cakes you’ll find. In fact I just took one out of the oven, for Christmas day. This is the exact recipe I’ve been using for over 30 years. It’s an easy 1 bowl recipe that delivers a wonderful cake, with a crunchy crust (which my family has been known to fight over… lol) and moist interior. I don’t use lemon extract, instead I use an entire 1 ounce bottle of Rum extract. Bring your ingredients to room temperature and creaming the butter and sugar for 8-10 minutes is sufficient; I use a stand mixer on medium. I add the flour to the creamed mixture first, only mixing until incorporated; and then fold in the 7-up with a spatula. Preheat your oven and be sure your Bundt pan holds at least 12 cups, or your cake could ooze over the sides. Grease (not oil) and flour your pan very well; this bugger likes to stick. Let cool in the pan 10 minutes; and then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. The cake is plenty sweet enough, so a simple dusting of powdered sugar is all it needs, but I wouldn’t turn my nose up to sweetened, fresh berries and whipped cream for a delightful summer dessert. My family and friends beg for this cake… it’s that good!

This is the exact recipe that we have used for 30 plus years.  I have always followed it eactly and it turns out perfect every time.  As my mom was in a high altitude area, she would bake this cake when she  came for a visit.  It is plenty sweet & a quick dusting with powdered sugar is fine.

I love this recipe! For those who absolutely love lemon I use a whole bottle of lemon extract...dangerous, I know, but amazing! When ever I make this cake it doesn't last longer then one day.

What I do wrong? My cake look pretty but tasted horrible. After adding in the flour I tasted the batter and it tasted awful. What did i do wrong I didn't sift the flour is that the problem? it all baked well, but the taste was nasty with a thick texture.

I followed this recipe exactly, even the 20 minute creaming of the sugar and butter.  I followed one review saying it doesn't rise much so add all the batter b/c it won't overflow.  So I have cake all in the oven from overflowing and then right before it was done it just caved in!! What did I do wrong?  And I need for tomorrow and now have no cake.

This recipe was really good.  Very moist and delicious.  I had a really hard time with it sticking to my Pampered chef stone bundt pan.  I will make again, just with another bundt pan.

This cake is amazing!  I took Serenity's advice and made a few modifications in the prep work.  The cake was beautiful and so moist.  It was definitely worth the extra effort.  This will be a cake I make over and over.

I followed the recipe exactly as provided; however, the cake came out heavier than I expected.  The flavor was good, but the cake was more trouble than it was worth for the end result.

Pretty good. Nothing super special though.  It turned out tasting like a regular 'ole pound cake. I had to use sprite because I had no 7-up.  Followed the directions exact.  No complaints, I served it with berries and whip cream.

Excellent, moist cake.  Not having any 7-Up, I substituted another lemon/lime soft drink without any problem.  I chose to add a glaze with a little lemon juice in it also; festive and tasty!  Worth the trouble for sure.

The cake had a nice flavour but I found that is was very heavy and on the dry side.  Thankfully I served it with whipped cream and a strawberry sauce (found on this site also) and all together, it was a good dessert.

This is the best 7-Up Cake I have ever tasted.  I have gotten so many request to make this cake after using this recipe.  My family can't get enough of it.  Sometimes I do make a glaze for it though, but it's wonderful with or without one.

I thought the cake turned out good. I added a 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and instead of 3/4 cup of the beverage. I added a cup. Also I added another egg and baked the cake in a tube pan. Very moist and very good.

For this recipe, I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour because I notice that the cake is not as dense.  I also put a teaspoon of vanilla extract in addition to the lemon extract and use 1 cup of 7-up and bake at 375 for about 80 minutes.

This recipe is so delicious,transfat free, and great for breakfast with coffee.I can't stop eating it. Maybe not such a good thing. I bought  cake flour but grabbed the regular flour out of habit. I used a handmixer until it was smooth and not stuck in the mixer anymore. It does come out, probably 5-10 mins.  I found an icing for lemon cookies, 1 cup confectioner sugar, 1/4 tsplemon extract and 2 tbs milk. I had to add a tiny bit more milk until it was like icing then put it on cake while it was cooling in the pan, like another recipe suggested but it didn't run underneath like it was supposed to. Next time I will put it on after the cake is out of the pan.   I used canola oil to grease the pan and at first wouldn't come out but put knife between the pan and cake and it came out perfect.

I loved this cake, though it was a little heavy, but it was very delicious.  My family loved it.  What I did different:  first, I used only 2.5 cups sugar, since I don't like anything oversweet; second, I used 2 tsp. lemon juice; third, I misread the recipe and poured in the ENTIRE can of 7 up.  I even used DIET 7 up!!  I was so worried the cake would not rise, that it would be too liquidy.  WRONG!  It was just wonderful!!!

I am not a baker but these simple ingredients made this an easy cake to make. I left this cake in the oven for a few minutes too long but using the glaze recommended by another user moisten it right back up. Everyone loves this cake and can't stop eating it. I will be making this again for sure.

This is an excellent recipe. It reminds me of my grandmas pound cake. If you want more of a sweetness to it then I guess you can add an icing to it but it really doesn't need it to me. This cake is the most requested of me during any type of gathering and not to mension it is super easy to make.

I didn't like the result, especially, after all the work I put into making it.  It was very thick and dense, almost pasty. It also didn't have much flavor.  My mother in law and daughter liked it, although they stated its lack of sweetness is what they enjoyed. Go figure.

I baked this cake as mini bundts, since my oven will not bake the whole bundt through.  This recipe was wonderfull as mini cakes.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon extracts.  I will make sure this goes in my rotation.

Very rich and comforting cake.  I did not have 7up, so I used Diet Cherry 7up. I also made a light glaze to drizzle over the top. Reminds me of being in my grandma's kitchen.

I have struggled with several different 7-up cake recipes.  This is the only one that has ever worked correctly!  I did cream the butter and sugar for the full 20 minutes and I'm glad I did.  No bubbling out of the pan into the bottom of the oven, no "sad" streaks (although that disappoints my husband).  Cake gets better each day.

I followed the tips by previous reviewer Serenity and this cake was awesome. This was my first cake from scratch and I was very pleased with the texture and richness...like a pound cake. I used 1 tsp of Vanilla extract and 1 tsp of lemon extract. Next time I will omit the lemon extract, which is why I rated this only 4 stars instead of 5. I did not care for the lemon taste...but I love vanilla. Will make this cake again soon!

Very  good and easy cake.  I did add a glaze however.  I mixed a little rose water and milk with some powdered sugar and vanilla and it was really good without being too sweet.  Will definitely do again.  Thanks for sharing!

lessee: 1) used strawberry soda instead of 7up. the cake was pink, but YUMMY. 2) added 2 tsps of lemon juice; i think i'll do 4 next time, just to see what happens. 3) used a sheet cake pan instead of a bundt cake pan. still worked fine. 4) used a paring knife and poked holes, and then glazed with a lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze.  DELISH! i LOVE this recipe and highly recommend it!

My grandma taught me this recipe when I was a teenager. I followed the recipe but I added a tablespoon of lemon extract for more flavor. Also, I let the butter sit at room temp. for 4 hours so I could mix it better. The cake was delicious and moist. Also, I made this cake for my twin sister and it was loved by everyone.

I made this for my husbands birthday...it was fantastic!  I don't have a stand mixer, so I was only able to beat the sugar and butter for 10 minutes before my hands gave out.  I followed the recipe and only used lemon extract, and we were very pleased with the flavor and aroma.  In my oven, I had to bake it for 75 minutes, and the 'crust' was a beautiful golden brown.  I also made a glaze of 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar that turned out to be a little too thin and sweet.  I guess next time I will try something a little lighter, even though my husband actually liked it!

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, except used 3 tsp. lemon extract.  I also used a stadium bundt pan.  It came out perfectly formed and tasted like sweet sugar lemonade in a cake.  I like that the lemon is not overpowering.  Best pound cake I have ever made!  I was going to glaze it, but it was so good like it was, I left it plain.

Wow, how easy!  The kids loved the idea of soda in their cake.  I used the whole can, I didn't try to use only 3/4 c, it worked well.  I served it with a huckleberry sauce and whipped cream.

I love this recipe. My sister used to make a cake for my father on his birthday, I made this once and now I have made one every week for the last 2 months. You have to make sure not to over mix once you add the flour. I did not beat the butter and sugar for 20 minutes, I only needed about 7-8 minutes

If I could give this cake 10 stars, I would!  I have been making this cake forever and have recently lost the recipe.  So when I made my search here on AllRecipes I was delighted to find a recipe so close to the one which I had been making. I do add additional vanilla and lemon extract.  One thing to keep in mind for this recipe is it is essential to whip up the butter and sugar until it is light and airy and watch your cooking time,  Don't let it overbake more than necessary.  Once it is just done, this cake is so delightful that you won't want to make any other coffee cake.  Many people who've had this cake are surprised that it is made with 7-up.  To be honest I use mostly ginger-ale because that's what I have on hand (therefore, reason for the extra lemon extract).  Anyway, you must try, try this recipe.

This cake turned out delicious. I used the cake batter to make two birthday cakes for my daughter. I divided the batter between two round spring forms. After baking I sliced the cakes horizontally, added strawberry jam in the middle and whipped cream and fresh strawberries on top. It was a hit!

I make this using Splenda (I use spelnda for all my baking) and everyone loves it. I have made it a few times for different events and it always gets eaten. I also use diet 7up or diet Sprite. By usig splenda and diet, you cut the calories from 568 for 1/12th of the cake, to 358 calories for 1/12th! (Not to mention all the sugar you save your body from) :)

This recipe is great! I used vanilla extract as well and made the glaze suggested by other reviewers. I baked it for longer than I expected (80 minutes) but it was great. I cut back to 2 cups of sugar. I have no idea why anyone would use 3 cups of sugar in any recipe other than homemade jams. EXCELLENT!

"Wonderful and so easy. It was a big hit at a reunion this weekend.  I read the other reviews and chose to  mix butter and sugar for about 10 minutes in my mixer.  
It turned out to be dense, like a pound cake and so delicious!"

Now this cake totally rocks.  The ingredient list is simple.  The directions say to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes but I did it for 15 and my cake turned out beautifully.  This makes a beautiful light and fluffy cake, very very moist but with a slightly crunchy outer crust (I believe due to the carmelized sugar).  I made a bunch of these in little mini-bundt pans (I bought the little pans from Walmart, four of them for $2.50 (this recipe made 8 of them)).  They do raise a little so don't pour to the top of your pan, best used for bundt pans or the mini bundt pans.  Can't tell you how good this cake is!  Gotta make it for yourself to believe it.  Make sure you use just opened fresh 7-up.

I never made a 7UP cake before trying this recipe, so using a hand mixer, I beat the butter and sugar for 20 minutes as suggested and yes my hand was tired but I wanted to closely follow the original recipe. Albeit, instead of lemon extract I used 3tsps of lemon juice which is what I had on hand along with 3tsps of vanilla extract as suggested by another reviewer and the cake did not taste too lemony. I also used 1 cup of 7UP instead of 3/4 cup. To avoid the cake from sticking to my bunt pan, I buttered and ( lightly floured) the pan and once baked, the cake separated from the edges of the pan with ease. Now for the negatives; this cake is much too sweet for my taste and baking it on 325 for 75 minutes was not enough for my oven. My cake was slightly underdone and upon reading other reviews, I noticed others had experienced the same problem. I will try this recipe again but will only use about 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 cups. The crust was very crisp and the aroma of the cake baking was awesome. This recipe has the makings for a totally awesome cake, so I will make it again but will bake it on 350 for about 75 minutes. “Ladytbird”

I added a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by others, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and was underwhelmed by the flavor. I was expecting more of a lemon flavor however this was more like pound cake. I drizzled a powdered sugar icing on top. It would have been better served topped with berries. Probably won't be making this one again.

This is a great cake.  My family and friends love it and so do I.  I also understand fully why you do the butter and sugar for 20 minutes.  It really does make a difference.  I am a Chef and I just want to say this is now my go to cake when I want to make something good and easy for a small event.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is a perennial favorite in my family. In 1989, I won Best of Show at our county fair with this cake--but there was a major difference: our recipe called for 2 T of lemon extract. After two disastrous attempts at getting the lemon cake out of the bundt pan, I had enough ingredients left for one more cake, but we were out of lemon. So I used almond extract. Good enough to beat even the fancy cakes at the fair!

I agree with other posters that creaming the butter and sugar for the full 20 minutes is imperative, as well as beating each egg in thoroughly. However, it will be fluffier if you fold the 7-Up in last as the recipe states (rather than partly with the flour as some have suggested). It can only be truly folded in if it's the last ingredient.

My grandmother used her Sunbeam and turned it on low to add the flour and liquid, just until incorporated. I HATE HATE HATE that 7-up changed their recipe it totally changed the flavor of the cake. I've had to search for a pop that taste like old 7-up but so far Kroger Lemon Lime is closest to the old 7-up.

Made this cake twice. First with hand mixer (came out dry). Second time used my stand mixer...AMAZING! This is what my grandmom's 7-Up cake used to taste like. Moist with a sweet "crust" on the outside. No glaze needed. Used 2tsp lemon extract and 1tsp vanilla extract. So excited!

I have been making this cake with this recipe for seven years and it is still a top request at every holiday and get together. I like it less lemon-y so I limit my usage of lemon extract and use one less egg than the recipe calls for and it is delish!

After making this cake, I was tearing up because this is the cake I remember my great-aunt making for every special occasion before she could no longer bake. I made this cake in remembrance of her and it was AWESOME!!!!  I will be keeping this recipe FOREVER... :)

This is the first cake I let my 10 year old son Jared make. It was awesome especially with the glaze. The only change I made was I did 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of lemon juice. We just finished making it a few hours ago and I'm sure it'll be gone before Wednesday.

Wonderful cake.  Made mine in the Kitchen Aide which makes the 20 minutes much easier but I do believe the 20 mins. must make a difference.  I did take the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 tsp. lemon and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Everyone loved it.  Next time definitely will have fresh strawberries on hand to serve with it.

I really enjoyed the consistency and flavor of this cake. Not too sweet and very much like a pound cake. I melted some chocolate chips and poured it over the top. Just seemed to add that little something. Thanks!

I TRIED THIS CAKE DUE TO THE HIGH REVIEWS AND IT DID COME OUT REALLY MOIST, BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU COULD SMELL AND TASTE THE EGGS IN THE CAKE.  IT WAS JUST NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, BUT OVERALL IT DID COME OUT NICE.  BUT I PERSONALLY WILL NOT BAKE THIS ONE FOR ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT IT TOOK.

I've been making this cake for years. You can change up the flavor a little by using almond flavoring instead of vanilla or even orange flavoring. It tastes even better after a couple of days!

This cake was really good. The only bad thing that came out of this cake was that my handmixer started smoking from creaming the butter and the sugar too long. But it worth it, the cake was great.

This was a good cake, though I found the lemon flavour to be minimal.  I cut back on the sugar by about 1/3 of a cup.  The batter was too much for my bundt pan so I poured the remainder into muffin tins and baked it that way without a problem. I didn't have any icing sugar available to make icing, so I drizzled honey on top instead, which tasted fine.

I had to chime in on this recipe. I have been making this cake for years and while this recipe is not exactly like my great-grandmothers it's the closest I've seen. This cake at one time was just a holiday tradition in my family and was only made at that time of the year. But my hubby and boys love it so much I love making it for them. Plus the ladies I work with ask for it everytime we have a potluck. This is an amazing cake. I hope you and your family like it as much as mine.

I make this cake about once a month. My BF says it is the best cake he has ever had. I must say that I personally didn't like it. To me it was too dense and had no flavor other than just sugary, but he loves it and requests it regularly. The 5 stars are for him.
I use store-bought cream cheese frosting and thin it with lemon juice to drizzle over the finished cake. I use a bundt pan also.

This was a great cake. I made this and brought it to work for a potluck and people thought that I bought it from a store. The cake was soft and moist. The recipe was easy to follow, thanks a mill :-)

I had been looking for a recipe like this for years!  I agree with not creaming butter and sugar for 20 minutes.  I tried recipe using all purpose flour.  I had better results with using flour especially for cakes.

At first, I was a little hesistant to even click on the link but the cake turned out great!! I think that I would reduce the sugar just a bit, probably to 2 1/2 cups instead. However, my friends and I did make some adjustments to the recipe. Rather than using lemon extract, we used about 1/4 teaspoon of Kool-Aid pink lemonade. We also simply baked them in 9 x 13.5 pans. I think it was about 1" deep. We made two pans and then cut them in half to create a four layer cake. Everyone loved it!

I followed the directions exactly for the cake and it turned out tasting very well.  

I had problems removing it from the bundt pans - I used a combination of butter and Pam to prepare the pans. The batter was enough for 18 mini bundt pans but I only had 7 cakes come out whole.  I believe it's from the carmelized sugar on the outside of the cakes.  I have used these pans for other recipes without problems.

I have never successfully bake a cake in my life.  I love making sweets.  The first time I bake the 7up cake it was a success.  It was very moist and flavorful.  This recipe has inspired to fulfill my dreams of owning a dessert restarurant.  I will continue to use your website to increase my experience with baking.

Instead of using 3 cups flour, I used 2 cups of flour, and 1 cup Cake Flour.
   I creamed the butter and sugar for 2 minutes, not 20.(I wonder if that was a misprint.) My kids LOVE this cake!

Cake was pretty good. It was a little greasy and didn't have a strong 7-up flavor. But overall, it had a pretty good taste.

I'm not usually much of a baker.  This past weekend, I decided to try my luck with this cake.  The results were phenomenal as well as delicious.  This is one recipe, I will share, and continue to use for years to come.

This is the BEST 7-Up cake recipe!  I’ve been making it for over 20 years and everyone loves it.  Beating the butter and sugar for 20 makes seems over the top but trust me it’s worth it.  Just stream your favorite tv show on Netflix and the 20 min goes by quick.

Thank you, other reviewers, for the suggestions to add 1 tsp vanilla, to beat the butter alone, then add sugar, and to beat well after each egg. I enjoyed how the top of the cake kind of caramelized - it formed a tasty crust of sorts.  I used whipped cream as frosting and thought it worked well.

This was amazing! I made a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 tsp milk, 2 tsp vanilla and a splash of 7up.  Poured the glaze over cool cake and dusted with powdered sugar.  It was beautiful and so yummy that it was gone by the next afternoon!  Definite favorite.

This cake has become my most requested cake I make. I substitute Softasilk cake flour instead of all purpose flour. I also use 2 tsp lemon extract along with 1 tsp vanilla extract. I’ve seen some reviews that state don’t cream the butter and sugar for the 20 minutes. In creaming the butter and sugar you have a moister cake-do not skip this step it’s worth it!

The cake came out light fluffy and moist but I’m having issues with my cakes sticking lately. Does this cake need to cool a little longer than 10-15 minutes cause it’s not super dense like cream cheese pound cake?

Actually, I've made this cake many times! It's so easy and even freezes well, if there is ever any left to freeze.  Since I often serve it with a scoop of ice cream on top, I don't make any type of glaze; sometimes (when there's no ice cream, or if company comes at the last minute) I'll just use a light dusting of powdered sugar. If I do have drop-in guest,  I tell the children they must drink 7-up with this cake, although the adults usually prefer coffee.

I made it and the cake is simple to make. I added a little bit more 7UP and it was fine. Everyone love s this recipe. and I have  had good experiences with scratch cake recipes better than cakes from mix for some reason... The glaze was really good.

This is my second cake , I made one for Thanksgiving and now for Christmas (a little early). I used to sit in the kitchen as a kid watching my grandmother cook and bake every chance I could and this cake was always one of my favorites. Now I have perfected my own version of hers and I'm so happy!

A bit tedious, but well worth it. I didn't have lemon oil, so instead I substituted lemon zest. Absolutely delicious and very dense and moist. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it.

This cake is so good! It does need icing, it's very sweet as it is. Because of some of the other reviews I only put in 1 teaspoon of lemon flavoring. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a lovely cake. My recipe, given to me by my aunt many years ago calls for the flour to be sifted three times. This makes the cake very light.

I've made this cake twice and it never last long. I also found that the 20 min is needed even with a stand mixer for the butter to be really smooth no lumps. Only thing I did different was added a lemon glaze the second time . But this cake does well without the glaze it's really up to you.

Great recipe! My family loves  this cake. However, instead of 3 cups of All Purpose Flour, I only use 2 cups and add 1 cup of Swan's Cake Flour. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I followed this recipe to a T... and found that the bottom (or the top when you flipped it out of the cake pan) was REALLY pale. I have calibrated my oven, so the temperature is exact. Not sure what happened there. My cake is two toned at this point, and this has NEVER happened to me before with a 7 Up cake. I give it 3 stars because the technique is easy, the batter comes out light and airy and the cake itself has a great taste.

This cake is wonderful as is.  Sometimes, I'll add a little lemon and lime zest to the cake.  Sometimes, I'll make a glaze of powdered sugar, lemon-lime soda, and lemon and lime zest.  That's just my personal taste.  Again, the 5 stars are for the original recipe.

I LOVE this Cake and so do my Family, Friends, and Co-workers. I made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly. I came out perfect. The next time I made it I used Jamaican Ginger Beer (a very strong Ginger ale) in place of the 7-up. I it was even more DELICIOUS (if you can beleive that). Now every time there is some sort of gathering I am asked to bring "That Cake".

Made this cake last week for the first time and got rave reviews from family and friends.  I did cut the sugar to only 2 cups and added an additional tsp of vanilla extract.  Turned out great.  Making it again this weekend.

I SIMPLY LOVED THIS RECIPE. I wasn't sure of it and because I didn't have any cake flour, I thought it'd be too heavy. But it came out great. I did add the 2 teaspoons of lemon extract and one teaspoon of vanilla extract as one of the other reviews recommended. It was perfect and the lemon cream cheese frosting really made it work. I would have taken a picture, but it was sampled before I could snap a shot.

Great recipe however I used a full cup of 7up and next time I will use a 1/2 cup more sugar.  Also I didn't pre heat my oven, placing the cake in a cool oven  makes a beautiful golden crust

I tried this cake and I wasn't all that excited about it.  I think I'll make it again sometime and increase the lemon extract alot!  It also seemed VERY sweet.

I list my original z7 up cake recipe and tried this one since it was pretty close to my original.  It turned out well.  I did not cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes more like 5 to 8 mins.  The cake was moist.  It took 70 minutes to bake.  I have an old school cast iron bundt pan and used bakers joy....the cake came out of the pan easily.    I will bake this again.

I need some help. I followed the recipe exactly.I even mixed it for 20 minutes as the recipe calls for, but when I took it out of the oven I noticed it was very heavy and had a slight a eggy taste. It seems to me that every time I use recipes that call for all purpose flour instead of cake flour my cakes check out very heavy. Could someone give me some advice on what I'm doing wrong before I attempt this recipe again.

Wonderful cake!  I made it for thanksgiving and all of my guests really enjoyed it.  I made 4 practice cakes in the week leading up to thanksgiving and I had a lot of problems with the baking time.  I think it must be my oven, but the cake needed 2 hours in the oven! I followed the recipe exactly, so it must just be my oven.  It was frustrating, but worth it in the end.

Mix for 20 mins for sure. Makes cake light and fluffy. Watch your cook time. Recipe says 60mins. Your over might cook faster. Don't want a dried out cake. Other than that....FABULOUS!!

There was no salt mentioned in the recipe so didn't put any in.  The cake tastes very flat.  Couldn't figure out what was wrong until I read over the recipe.  Was very disappointed since my entire family was looking foward to tasting it before I made another one for our fair.

This cake turned out VERY heavy, dense and DRY!  I assume that I overbeat the batter??  Got a tip today from a co-worker saying to mix up some lemon-flavored Jello, poke holes in the cake, pour the liquified Jello mixture over the cake then let sit in the refrigerator to set up.  I also thought about just serving slices with canned sliced peaches and whipped topping

Eleanor, I followed your recipe to the letter other then adding cream cheese to the batter and I must say creaming the butter, cream cheese and sugar for 20 minutes made this pound cake so light and fluffy!!  I see someone else suggested that creaming 20 minutes was excessive but truly it made a world of difference in the density of the cake.  My granny-in-law and mom-in-law were head over heels about this cake that I had to bake another one!!!  ;-)  Thanks again for this small suggestion I now use it with all my other homemade cakes!!

i followed this recipe to the t, except for mixing it for 20 mins, i only could do it for 10. i was very hesitant that this recipe didnt call for any baking soda/or powder, that was strange to me. (even with the soda added) it took exactly 75 mins, the outside was starting to overcook, i used a bundt, and the inside was just barely done. it was soo heavy and dense you would thought it was a jello cake. i like pudding cakes, but not one so thick u cant even poke your finger through it. and with 3 cups of sugar, i thought itd be sweeter...

The cake is wonderful. I did use 2 teaspoons of Almond Extract because my daughter asked me to make it with almond, it is fabulous. One Very important question is, should cake come out of pan right away, or cool in pan? I have read many reviews, and variations, no one mentions this, other than it did stick to someone pan. I heavily crisco'd my bundt pan and it stuck too. Love the cake tho, thank you for posting.

While this cake had a great flavor, It stuck to the pan so badly I only had crumbly pieces.  I used a non-stick bundt pan that I greased the heck out of so I don't know what else I could have done.  If I make it again I will use a regular 9x13 pan.

I have made this cake SEVERAL times and my family absolutely loves it!!!  I must say that I did experiment with different flavorings and different frostings, but the cake itself is marvelous.  I even have customers now who order them because it is so good.
