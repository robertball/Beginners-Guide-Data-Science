I will definitely make this again!  I was hungry  for a ground beef and rice casserole, and had (I thought) all of the ingredients on hand.  Turns out I didn't have any white rice so I used brown rice, and I used a left over ear of corn instead of canned.  Served it with tortillas and YUM!  It was more soup like when I first opened the insta-pot, but by the time we went back for seconds the rice absorbed all of the juice and it was still really good. I'm new to  insta-pot  cooking so it was probably something I did, but it was easy, fast and really good!

Great recipe! Rather than jarred salsa, used diced fresh tomatoes, and canned green chiles in addition to a lot more cumin, chile powder, as well as granulated garlic and onion powder to taste. 2 cups was too much water, since there was liquid coming from the tomatoes - used 3/4 cup water instead. Made it 2x in a week!

The first time I made this recipe I followed the instructions to the letter. It was very good. The second time I made it I used chicken breast instead of ground beef. I tossed the chicken breast in some taco seasoning before I browned it. I also added some diced green pepper.  It was even better than the first time.  5 stars from my family.

As written, I agree with others that this would be bland . Here are changes I made:   Brown rice instead of white. 7/8 tsp of both chili powder and cumin gave it a nice bite. A smidge more salt . Cooked on high pressure x 15 minutes, natural release x 10 minutes then  quick release. NEXT time I would decrease water by 1/4-1/2 C. We served with slotted spoon  on warmed tortillas with low fat sour cream, chopped lettuce and additional salsa. We added cheese and cilantro to individual servings . I think this would also be great on taco salad or served with tortilla strips or Fritos in top.

We will definitely make again! I used a can of Mexicorn instead of regular corn, 1 tsp of cumin (instead of 1/2 tsp), and a side of fresh sliced jalapeños. My husband asked that next time I add black olives and maybe a small can of green chiles. It is definitely savory!!!

As written this is pretty kid friendly and bland and I used a medium salsa. It works though, my kids ate it as a filling for burritos and with tortilla chips. We also drizzled Mexican Hot Sauce (Valentina) on top and added lime.

Thought it was pretty bland. After eating some I immediately thought of 2 different ways I could have cooked this same meal and had it turn out better. All the flavors blended into one bland mashup.

I was very weary of the amount of liquid to use after reading the other reviews. I decided too much liquid would be better than not enough (soupy is okay, dry isn't). I made this exactly as instructed per the recipe. It worked great! Very quick and easy-perfect to make while the baby naps! I topped with fresh jalapeños.

I used 2 fresh jalapeños, stewed tomatoes, and fresh cilantro instead of the salsa. I also added a bit more rice and liquid so that it made it more of a stew consistency. Delicious!

Very good but a bit bland.  Added more chili powder and some paprika and garlic powder at the end.  

Also we only had brown rice so I microwaved it for ten minutes (2c water, 1c brown rice), drained and then added it to the recipe as indicated.

This was a great Sunday evening meal! I prepared it as directed with the addition of a can of diced tomatoes and some additional taco seasoning. This would be great for stuffed green peppers, too. You may want to add some tomato juice or more water at the end if you’d like something saucier. The overall flavor was great!!

The first time I made this dish I did not cook the rice long enough.  The second time I set it for 12 minutes and it was perfect!  Easy to make and easy for meal prep for future dinners.

This was a big hit. The many textures from the rice to the beans and the corn made this a fun casserole to serve with flour tortilla boats and chopped vegetables.
Only adjustment I made was to add half a can of diced green chilies for a bit of heat. Other than that - followed the recipe exactly.

Made it as shown. Good. But very bland. Next time I’ll up the spices big time, either 4x or use taco seasoning. Thanks for a good base recipe.

Thanks so much for this recipe! My hubby has stomach cancer so I didn't want something to spicy. Plus we are raising three of our grandchildren. Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again! Win, win!

I made this last night, and everyone thought it was delicious. I had to make a couple of substitutions because I didn't have everything in my kitchen; kidney beans for the black beans and a can of diced tomatoes for the salsa.

This was so easy! I used a can of rotel chili’s and about a half a cup of roasted salsa. I decreased the water to 1 cup. It was delicious. I also omitted the beans because I have a picky eater.  Makes 8 servings and 1 serving with light sour cream is 10 WW freestyle points

Needs more spice, a little less rice, a little more beef, and more salt. IMO.

I made some modifications to the recipe. I didn't have black beans, so I just kept them out.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes instead of salsa. I increased the cumin and chili powder to taste., and added a couple tbsp of minced garlic. Instead of white rice, I used a 10 ounce package of yellow rice mix . I cooked it under pressure for 8 minutes, and let the pressure release naturally for another 8. Rice was perfect!   My family ate this up!

Turned out amazing. Very easy recipe with big results. I used a Smokey chipotle salsa and it added a nice Smokey Spicy flavor. I also added some fresh lime juice when serving.

It was defiantly very good, but it just need a little bit of texture, like chips.

I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but this was amazing! I did double the spices and added taco seasoning. I waited until it was done to add frozen corn. it was a little watery so I added about a half cup of instant rice let it set for a while longer. This would be perfect in tortilla shells. We will be making it again very soon!

I made this tonight and it was excellent!  The only change I made was using 1 1/2 TBLS of dried cilantro - I will make it again - might even use as a filling for a tortilla wrap.

It's good people!  And so easy to make :-) The flavor is pretty good, you could probably add a little more but overall a really good meal that my family enjoyed!

I really liked this. I didn't add cilantro since I don't like it. I did add hot roasted jalapenos and used beef broth rather than water.  I will be making this again.

I am not a fan of cilantro, so I changed it to parsley. I used a can of corn and 1.5 cups of minute rice.  It was absolutely perfect! Everyone loved it! I served the dish in baked tortillas, wrapping them like burritos, then putting back in the oven for a few minutes to brown and crisp. Awesome! Thank you!

The kids loved it.  The adults required hot sauce, olives, sour cream, tomato, and lettuce to jazz theirs up.  It is filling and easy, which is alwasy a plus.

This was very simple. You likely have all the ingrediants ready to go. I used half turkey meat and half regular meat. I only had a quarter of jarred salsa but it was still delicious. I will definitely make again!

This was the first recipe I made in the Instant Pot.  Searched hard for a recipe using long grain white rice because that's what I had. This came out so good. I had no corn so I left that out and I am not a fan of cilantro so omitted that. Thank you for a great recipe that has now made me fearless of the new pressure cooker.

Very good. I used yellow onion because that's what I had. I left out the cilantro and served it on the side.  So easy to make this morning to send with my husband for lunch.
