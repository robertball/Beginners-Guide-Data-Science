Very Good!  I found that the recipe called for a lot of butter (plus peanut butter) so I halfed the amount of butter and the cookies came out lighter - a melt in your mouth kind! Yummy!
PS - I baked them for around 9 minutes!

I didn't have any eggs and wanted to make some peanut butter cookies. I came across this recipe and I'm so glad I did! They were super easy and tasted great. My husband thought they were lighter and tasted better than the peanut butter blossoms I usually make. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and cut the baking time to 10-11 minutes and rolled them in sugar. These were great cookies with a good peanut butter flavor!

This is a great recipe when you have someone who can't eat eggs. Very easy and tasty. Make sure that you take them out of the oven when the edges start to brown. I dipped the top of the cookies in sugar before I pressed the fork in. My boyfriend could have eaten all of them in one day! Thank you for the recipe. I will make them again and again.

Was looking for something simple to make for husband's office christmas party. These were easy to make and everyone loved them. I did have to decrease the baking time after burning the bottom of the first batch!

Yum, these are delish!  Mine took 20 mins to cook & they were perfect.  Next time I will use crunchy peanut butter for that extra crunch (I only had smooth on hand).

These are very good cookies, especially for how simple the recipe is.  I decreased the butter to 2/3 c. and added chocolate chips.  Only baked them for about 10 minutes.  Great peanut butter taste.

I am allergic to eggs in every way! These are absolutely delicious. I did reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and added some peanut butter chips also. It seemed a little dry so I added about 1/8 cup of water. Great cookies thank you for sharing!

These were only so-so for me. I will use a different recipe next time. But I did appreciate the fact that this recipe does not call for egg.

These were fantastic! I made them for a friend who's son is allergic to eggs. I kept some for my family and even after a few days in a ziploc bag they were still good -- moist and full of flavor. I did have to back them about 15 minutes on a non-stick pan.

Rich little cookies. You definitely need a drink to go with these. I thought they were pretty good but had kind of a raw flour taste at the first, and something was just missing? Super easy to do this recipe, but maybe I like the texture of a cookie with egg in it better? I'd eat these again though, they were pretty good overall. I got 4 dozen cookies from this.

WOW, I just ate a cookie from my first batch while the second batch is in the oven and I Love the way these came out, I substituted low fat peanut butter & used about 2/3 of the margarine called for instead of butter (could probably get away with even less) but the texture of these is wonderful they absolutely melt in my mouth, thank you for such a fast and easy recipe! Perfect for those late night cravings

These were the first cookies I ever baked and really the first thing I ever baked.  These were simple and it makes a lot.

I only modify it to add chocolate chips.

The flavor was okay, but overall I was disappointed. I made these cookies with my daughter and we had a great time, but the result was not so great. The cookies came out dry and crumbled apart when we took them off of the cookie sheet. I think maybe the recipe called for too much flour.

Great cookies! Had no eggs so this was great. I halved the recipie, used chunky peanut butter and added a few mini crushed butterfinger bars. turned out awesome. First batch baked for 8 mins and burnt slightly. second batch was 5-6 min and was perfect. My ovens hot though, and I dont think it's necessary to grease the pan.

These are excellent for a late night snack, or for those allergic to eggs!  I doubled the recipe, because I knew we'd eat all the cookies in one day if I only made one batch. Because I used a sweeter peanut butter, I cut out 1/2cup of sugar - this turned out to be the perfect balance.   I also used 2/3cup of butter for each batch of butter (a total of 1 1/3cups). Turned out quite well! Baked two trays each at 12minutes.

Not bad, definitely not great. I think there is too much flour as the cookies turned out really dry and crumbly. I did however half the butter, which leads me to think I should have halfed the flour too. Not very peanut buttery either.

so good! i didnt have eggs and really wanted to make peanut butter cookies, and im amazed by how good they turned out for not being the normal peanutbutter cookie with eggs.  The best part is that i saved some cookie dough and put in in vanilla ice cream to make a peanut butter cookie dough McFlurry sort of thing because there werent eggs in it! VERY YUMMY

Awesome cookies, soft and flavorful. I added a little extra flour (less then 1/3 cup) and only baked for 10 minutes. Note: you may want to halve the recipe...it makes a good amount of cookies.

These cookies are pretty good, I didn't expect much from them but they really exceeded my expectations.  Definitely great for people who can eat eggs, but if the lady you are trying to impress can eat eggs, I would recommend using them.  These cookies are a bit crumbly without them, but I noticed that if you don't put fork criss crossings in them, or shape them into cubes, they don't crumble so much.  Not bad!

This recipe is delicious!  It can easily be made vegan by submitting almond butter instead of the milk.  I just wish I could give this recipe more stars!  I will definetly be making this again.  the only thing I did different was use almond butter instead of peanut butter.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Mmm, these cookies are so good and so easy to make.  I baked these on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for about 12 minutes and they came out lightly browned on the bottom, slightly crumbly, and pleasantly chewy.

DO NOT BAKE THESE FOR 18-25 MINUTES.  I baked my first batch for 14 minutes and the cookies were so burnt they were inedible.  After that I kept them in 11 minutes.  I got 60 cookies out of this and I made the dough balls exactly 1inch in diameter, as the recipe says to do.  They taste ok, especially for an eggless recipe, but not great.  I won't make them again unless I have to make eggless cookies.  These are drier and less chewy than most peanut butter cookie recipes.

I wasn't too fond of these cookies.  I just finished making them and they don't quite pack that peanut butter punch I was looking for.

Kind of a gross texture and the cookies fell apart. I wouldn't recommend this. I've had better recipes that didn't call for eggs etc but this was honestly the worst.

These were tasty and easy enough but they are indeed on the dry side so I honestly don't think I would make them again.

Great if you are limited on ingredients and have a craving for peanut butter cookies.  A little dry, but good flavor.  I didn't have milk so I used soy milk.  I only cooked mine for 12 minutes.

creating similar right now used 1/2 C butter (1 stick) 1/2 C white sugar, 1/4C brown sugar, 3/4 C peanut butter, 2T milk. 1t vanilla extract, 8/9 C flour and about 1/4 C cornstarch so far a nice flavor and consistency. Well see how they get eaten after dinner

Delish!  I was out of brown sugar, so purposely looked for a peanut butter cookie recipe w/out.  I did use half margarine and half shortening.  Yummyness, as my husband says.

These were great! Crispy outside, chewy center!! (And not overly sweet) I had limited things to use and wanted to make some peanut butter cookies. I also used 2/3C margarine because I didn't have butter.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  Thanks for such a simple and delicious recipe.

These cookies are super soft. I did roll them in some sugar before baking. And def. reduced the baking time to about 10 minutes. I still prefer the 3 ingredient PB cookies, but these are just as easy to put together.

I was really craving peanut butter cookies, but I didn't have any eggs. This recipe is so simple and makes delicious cookies. I rolled 1/2 of a mini Reese's peanut butter cup in the middle of each one. I also rolled the cookies in sugar and then flattened them a little before baking. I made my cookies larger than the recipe called for and I baked them for 14 min. Watch your baking time carefully because the 18-25 min. given in the recipe would be way too long.

Very good!  The only prob. I had with them is they had a little after-tast to them .  I dipped them in surger.  That did it.  They were gone in one night!  Will make them again.
