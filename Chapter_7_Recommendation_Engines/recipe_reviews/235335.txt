Super simple and very tasty! This is a great way to use up extra hummus.  Can't wait to try other flavors too!

I love to make homemade hummus, but there is always so much.  This was a very creative way to use the extra.  I did add a bit of plain yogurt to improve the consistency and used it to dress a tarragon chicken salad with roasted veggies.  Thanks for the great idea

I made it with Almond Milk and only used 1 Tbsp of parsley. Pretty tasty and very easy
