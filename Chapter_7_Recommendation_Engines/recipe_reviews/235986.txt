Hello! I added this recipe and wanted to add that I sometimes add 2 kisses per cookie to some of the cookies to add extra chocolate for the chocolate lovers out there. Also you made need more sugar than a 1/4. I just pour sugar on a plate and roll the cookies. Last thing is I do believe the brands that you use make a big difference so I highly recommend using the brands listed above :) I have messed up and used reduced fat JIF PB and the cookies did not turn out as good at all! I hope you all enjoy this recipe and share with your friends and family :)

Wow! Maybe the best peanut butter with kisses cookies I have ever eaten. The only additional thing I did was soften the peanut butter in the microwave so it blended quickly and easily in the batter. So much better because it's a simple recipe with items always on hand. Thanks Jennah!

Three (3) times I looked at this recipe ... Three times!  Thinking to myself "Bisquick?  Bisquick?  Nooooooo way".  And three times I came back, finally deciding oh what the heck - I'll give it a try.  This was the EASIEST QUICKEST TASTIEST blossom recipe I've ever tried.  No fuss - no frills - melt in your mouth delicious.  I'm SO glad I came to my senses.  Batter was a bit loose when I first made it - ended up throwing in maybe another quarter cup of baking mix (used the homemade stuff from AR recipe here), then let it sit in fridge for oh - maybe ten minutes.  Eight minutes of baking was spot on (although I did leave them sit on the cookie sheet after pressing in the chocolate kiss while I prepared the next pan).  So far I've already gotten 30 cookies ... will probably get another 10 out of them.  Thank you SO much for recipe!

I've been making these for 25 years and decided to try a new recipe based on the rave reviews.  I too, was suspicious about the Bisquick.  I give this four stars for convenience,creativity and pretty good taste.  I personally like it a bit sweeter and more peanut-buttery, as I find other peanut butter blossom recipes, so these may appeal to someone who doesn't have quite the sweet tooth as I do! This is just a preference. I can taste the Bisquick, and find the Bisquick makes these a tad dry but a lovely shape.   Also, I noticed that this recipe doesn't brown like traditional peanut butter blossoms, so don't overbake. Thanks for the convenient recipe!

I am not one to review ANYTHING. But this recipe DESERVED a review! This was the BEST peanut butter blossom recipe EVER! They melt in your mouth, are super moist and the best? EASY!! I too, was skeptical about using a baking mix; but it makes sense-no need to add salt, baking powder, etc. I will DEFINITELY be sharing this on my Pinterest page and my facebook. THANK YOU FOR SUBMITTING THIS!!

The BEST and EASIEST peanut butter blossom cookies I've ever made OR tasted.  Stored in an airtight container, they stayed soft for quite a few days.  You won't regret making them!

Tasty, quick and easy. Was looking for easy entertainment with my children on a dreary day and this fit the bill. All ingredients except the kisses (stocking dregs) Aldi brand and turned out great. Got 28 out of the batch with irregular sizing. My cook time was more like 10 minutes but otherwise spot on. Looking forward to sneaking with coffee in the morning;)

I made these cookies.  I didn't have Bisquick, but used Aunt Jemima's complete instead, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Compared to other recipes, these did not brown as I expected, and cracked really badly when I placed the chocolate kiss. I did not over bake them, as the center is still a little moist.   The cookie tastes very dry and clearly needs more fat in the recipe.  One option might be to increase the peanut butter.  I made these to bring to a church function and didn't have the time or the ingredients to make more, so I was very disappointed.

Easy to make but has a very thick consistency and a bit of an odd after taste. I'll go back to made from scratch.

This recipe is wonderful!
So easy to make and the best tasting ever!
I used the advice of others here: I microwaved the Jif for 15 seconds to make it easier to mix & I put the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes so it would be easy to roll into balls.
Worked perfectly!

This recipe is edible but really weird. The consistency of the batter is oddly easy to work with. I feel like I've just made processed cookies that would be bought in the store. Will definitely go back to 'from scratch' as seriously, what's the point in putting the time in?

I have made this exact recipe at Christmas for probably 8 years, but couldn't put my fingers on the mini cookbook where the recipe appears. So naturally I searched allreceipes.com to find it! We love the tenderness of this cookie, as well as the ease of preparation. And who doesn't have Bisquick on hand??  I have rolled these in colored sprinkles, mixed with the sugar. Festive! I usually place a kiss on top of each cookie and then gently smush them down after a minute or so. The kiss melts slightly on the warm cookie and resembles an elf hat. Love these, so thankful I could find the recipe.

I'm not a fan of PB cookies but my family liked these - they say the cookies taste better the day after baking. I was worried the natural peanut butter I used might do something strange to the dough but it was fine. I don't usually have baking mix or Hersheys Kisses around the house so don't know if I'll be making these again anytime soon but if you have absolutely no time to bake and need to produce something in a hurry these are quick and easy.

This is the first time I made these cookies, and I really enjoyed them, and they were so simple to make too!  I think that they were a little dry, but other than that, they were really good.

don't know why exactly but,  didn't love it. They were a little dry & not very sweet.  I will put two kisses on to them in the next batch though
