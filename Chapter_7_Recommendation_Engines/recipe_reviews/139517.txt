Decrease the temperature!  This is a great recipe--when baked at 425.  At 500, this just browns or blackens before cooking in the middle.  I love these, but if I rated this recipe based on the product I got without decreasing the temperature, I would give it two stars.  If you plan to follow the recipe exactly, take my advice and start watching for burning long before you are supposed to take it out of the oven.

Fabulous but one hint.  This really rises in the oven so put it on a low rack to cook.  Also great w/ carmelized apples.

I made this on a weekend up at Lake Vermillion, MN with friends.  Since it was not my own recipe or my own kitchen and we were with new friends I prayed this wouldn't fail.  I followed the recipe closely but dared myself to add drops of philly cream cheese. I wanted to insure a success and what better way than dairy and fat? It is awesome and it will impress friends.  Try with canned blueberries and extra creamy whipping cream.  I confess there was an awkward silence though when it was served. Guests said it looks strange but tastes like heaven.

Tried this recipe, it came out of the oven looking great but my family and friends did not like the salty taste, guess we are just used to having pancakes made with more of the sugar than salt.

This was great!  I was slightly nervous about it because my husband is very picky about textures, but he said it was delicious.  I only made enough for 4 servings, so I used an 8x8 pan.  It seemed like there was a bit too much butter left after it baked, but it sure tasted yummy still!  I served it with the Dutch Honey Syrup from this site, some sliced strawberries, and homemade whipped cream... the perfect combo!

This recipe is just ok.  Not the recipe I was looking for.  The one I used in the past but lost,  allowed the sides of the puff to rise quite high and this one did not.  This rose slightly but was not substaintial.   I cut the amount of butter in half which worked out fine. As the pan had plenty of butter for the batter to swim in.  Still even with this correction, the cooking time had to be extended a good 5 minutes as the batter was still jiggly after the suggested amount of time.  Part of the problem could possibly be the suggested pan or size.  Original oven pancakes were made in dutch ovens.  Maybe a 9 x 12 pan just wont ever work properly.  This recipe also does NOT turn out the correct consistency of Dutch Oven Pancakes.  A bit mushy not firm like a quiche but it was cooked throughout.  Again I suggest using NO SALT butter if you deem it necessary to use this recipe as the salty taste overwhelmed the dish.  I will keep searching for the correct and orignial recipe.  This is certainly NOT it.

Around here, we consider this as a traditional Finnish dish; some (my grampa) called it panukaaku (sp), but my mother-in-law (who was also Finn) called it krupsua.  Either way, it's a wonderful and quick dish that our family loves!  Highly recommend it.

Very good! It was not very sweet, which was a big hit at a brunch with a lot of other sticky-sweet things.  Also, it puffs up in the oven, which was fun to see!  Just make sure you have plenty of room above it in the oven.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I used 3 large eggs instead of the 4 called for and 2 large granny smith apples.  It was good warm from the oven, and good cold, if you you enjoy custard type deserts, this one is great.

I loved this recipe! It's great that it is high on protein and actually on the more healthy side. The only thing I'd change is the butter, it's way to buttery so I used 1/4  cup and that worked just as well. Definitely will use this recipe again.

This worked out great but I added Nutmeg to give it a kick.  I could see doing other things with this to add flavor.  Great base dish.  Build on it.
