I followed the recipe exactly and our family really enjoyed it.  Would like to try it with some garlic and fresh basil next time.

It came out a little too vinegary for my taste. If I made it again, I'd probably use red wine instead of red wine vinegar. Also, a tip, mince all the veggies in a food processor the night before you cook, to ease up on the prep time.

I have made this recipe several times now and am finally rating it. It is an excellent sauce you can add other spices or herbs depending on what your using it for I myself added garlic and Italian spice in the reviews people complained about vinegar in the recipe and they need to re read it as it states red wine no where did I see red wine vinegar as they complained about as I think that's all they had on hand their mistake not the poster of the recipe this is truly amazing sauce give it a try and use RED WINE not red wine vinegar!!!!

In the end, we liked this sauce but it needed a little help. Because of the confusion in the ingredients I had to make some changes. The ingredients call for red wine vinegar, but the directions say to add the red wine. Hmm, I chose to go with the vinegar but used half the amount. I was worried about the acidity of the tomatoes and the vinegar so I added two large bay leaves at the start of the simmering time. After an hour of simmering, I tasted and the sauce needed a boost so I added 2 cloves of minced garlic. With these few changes, it was an excellent sauce. I do wonder what the submitter intended..vinegar or wine? addendum: I see that the ingredient list has been corrected to include red wine instead of red wine vinegar, which was listed in the original ingredient list. I made it again, and again I added the fresh garlic, it just seems to be missing it!
