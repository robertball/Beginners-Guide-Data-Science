I love this recipe except I use italian breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes.  What I do to add extra flavor is I melt the butter and also fry a clove or two of minced garlic in it, and then once the butter is melted it sits for twenty minutes to meld the garlic flavor into the butter.  I then dip the chicken in the garlic butter and then into the breadcrumb/cheese mixture.  Add a little more cheddar on top toward the end of baking.  This is some of the moistest chicken I've had.

I didn't really care for this recipe but some of it may be my fault as I used low fat cheddar cheese.  I think I should've covered the dish since I used low fat because the cheddar became hard and crusty.  My fiance loved it and I liked the flavor that the cornflakes gave the chicken but I don't think I'll make this one again.

Been meaning to try this one for a few weeks now because of all the rave review - finally got to it tonight only to discover halfway into getting it all set up I had NO cheddar left in the fridge!  Used shredded colby/jack mix instead - and when the coating really wouldn't stick to the chicken at all - I lost faith and only used 2 whole chicken breasts vs the 8 halves the recipe called for - and broiled the rest *plain* to use as backup if this turned out inedible.  In my disgust, I threw the rest of the butter and cornflake/cheese mix on top of the two breasts and put it in the oven - and WOW was I sorry I didn't use more chicken!!  We LOVED the recipe - and wolfed down the pitiful two breasts I made and were both sorry I ever doubted all the reviews.  VERY tasty - though it didn't seem like it would work out well at first - this one will definitely be made again (and the colby/jack cheese turned out great - almost hesitant to use cheddar next time - since why mess with perfection?)

Thanks so much for a fantastic easy and tasty recipe!

Hate to pull a Simon Cowell, but I absolutely did not like this dish.  I followed all recipe instructions except I added a pinch of garlic powder and used less butter (perhaps I shouldn't have cut down on the butter?).  Also, I used freshly shredded parmesan which probably did not mix as well as the grated kind. But the upshot is: it tasted like someone had prepared their morning cornflakes on top of my chicken.  Sorry!

The best Cheddar chicken I have ever eaten. Here are some changes to make the chicken even more tasteful.In the melted butter I stir one tblsp of Dijon mustard and I also used sharp Cheddar cheese. It was delicious. Good luck.

This recipe is great, as is! I added a little extra cheddar cheese, and made sure to put all the extra cheese mixture on top. 40 minutes was perfect for my oven. Thanks!

I thought this was delicious. I took advice from others and salted the chicken. I did put pepper, and Tony Cachere's Herb and Spice seasoning in the cornflake mixture which gave it a really nice taste. They came out very moist. I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy! The only thing I added was a bit of salt and pepper to the corn flake mixture. I covered my dish with foil for part of the cooking time, but removed it so the coating could get crisp. This recipe was so easy to make and tasted great. The chicken was very moist and the coating added a great crunch...top with extra cheddar if you'd like. I will be making this recipe again...soon I might add! Thanks!

Great taste for an everyday family meal.  Easy to make!  Everyone liked it.  Would add more cornflakes next time, not crunchy enough on top.

I thought this was pretty good.  I made it for my family and the kids really enjoyed it.  I used bread crumbs instaed of cornflakes.  I also sauteed some minced garlic in the melted butter as suggested by others.  Used chicken strips.  Cooked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Easy peasy!

I made this when my mother was in town and the odd looks I got from both she and my wife were priceless when I started coating the chicken in the corn flakes...but they loved it.  Served it with rice and roasted green beans.

The only change I made was to cut the chicken into nuggets.  We definitely enjoyed these and could taste the cheese.  A nice change to regular breaded/fried nuggets.

Great!  the only change i made was to add a little rosemary to the cornflake mixture, but it wasn't necessary b/c it would have been just as good without it.

My husband said "This is delicious" four times while eating this.  I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves, so the flavor went through easily.  I also took the suggestion of Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

This was great, but I did take the recommendation of combining with garlic chicken.  I melted butter with 4 cloves garlic, minced in a pan.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon dried parsley, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt to the cornflake mixture.  Then pour any left-over butter/garlic mixture over the chicken.  This is great for low-carb diets.  My husband loved it.

This is a great recipe as is and I have made it following the directions exactly many many times. That being said I have recently learned some new tricks that I applied and found work even better. First instead of butter I used yogurt which helped by keeping my chicken moist while cooking. Second I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of cornflakes which provided in my opinion a better crust. Third I sprinkled dried parsley on top before baking. Finally I made a nice sauce to go alongside using a can of cream of chicken soup, 2 tbsp sour cream and 2 tbsp butter heated in a pot over med high heat. Try this recipe as is and adapt as you like, you won't be disappointed.

This is a definite keeper.  Made as written with two slight deviations. I used panko bread crumbs because I had no cornflakes cereal on hand, and lightly seasoned the chicken breasts with Italian seasoning before baking. Thanks, Karen Bush for the terrific recipe!!

I baked it for 20 minutes covered and another 20 minutes uncovered, and it turned out great! I also added some garlic powder as someone else had suggested, and it was good, but I think next time I will stick with the recipe as is.  Unfortunately, no leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I was less than thrilled with this recipe. I followed it exactly, but the biggest complaint I have about it is that the breading mixture simply did not stick very well to the chicken.  This left the chicken with a blotchy coating of breading, which I think detracted from the taste as well as the appearance of the dish.  I think if I were to make it again, I would look for another way - perhaps dipping in an egg mixture instead.

This recipe was an amazing dish. I got many compliments from my roommates! I fixed the cheddar chicken with red new potatoes, corn, salad and green beans. It was absolutely delicious. I recommend this to anyone who is trying to cook for 6 or more guests!

Really good!  We were in the mood for wings so I said "why not?"  Came out great, only thing I changed was to use panko instead of corn flakes, and I omitted the butter and used beaten egg whites due to dietary restrictions.  Definitely a keeper, and remember, when you read a recipe you have to keep in mind that seasonings are very subjective, use more if it doesn't look like enough, and vice-versa.  This is GOOD!

My husband is a huge cheese fan.  If he could eat cheese on everything, he would.  I saw some of the reviews stating that the dish was too bland.  So, I decided to add a bit of garlic powder to the melted butter and it helped a bit.  I do think that I will make again, but I will tinker with the spices to give it more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

I used bread crumbs rather than corn flakes.  I also used half the butter for dipping and drizzled the rest over the breaded chicken.  This turned out wonderfully.  I only baked mine about 20 minutes though.

This was excellent!  I used crushed Ritz crackers for an even buttery taste and it was perfect.  I also added a little more cheese 10 minutes before it would be ready as suggested earlier.  I will be making this one over and over!

I made this recipe using crushed Cheez-It crackers. I didn't have the called for corn flakes. Wow ! It was just delicious ! I also used chicken strips  instead of the chicken breasts and baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Next time I will try it with corn flake crumbs to see which we prefer. Great recipe! My hubby just loved it.

I thought this was pretty and good and very easy. I cut the chicken into strips and added fresh garlic to the melted butter. I thought it could still use a little extra flavor though. I also thought it got a little soggy on the bottom.

I made half of the recipe, pretty much halving all ingredients. Turned out real well. Like others I added a little pepper, no salt, and a little garlic powder. The wife loved this and told me to make sure I saved the recipe.

LOVE this recipe!  I have made it many times, and I love it AS IS, but my boyfriend is picky about chicken breasts (he prefers dark meat, and says breasts are too dry) so I have tinkered w/ this recipe and have come up with a way to make it a little more moist (and it may just be my oven) but I dip the breasts in about 1 cup of sour cream seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Tony C's, and then coat them in the cheese, and corn flakes.  Then I drizzle with about 2-3 Tbs melted butter or olive oil, and bake like normal.  BF loves it made this way!  Just another option!

I found this recipe kind of bland.  The chicken needs to have some spices on it the cheese does not add enough taste.  I will try again as we liked how crispy the outside was.

Really good chicken.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips then buttered them and dipped them in the cheese mix.  The cheese mix didn't stick very well so I sprinkled the remaning mix over the chicken once it was in the pan and drizzled just a little bit of butter over it.  I also broiled to chicken for 3 min. after it was cooked to make it crispy.  It was awesome with BBQ sauce or just plain.

Great recipe for starters.  Look at another "Garlic Cheddar Chicken" recipe and try to combine and you'll come out with a winning combination.  Overall, cornflakes were a great idea... use a little minced garlic and extra cheese on top and you're good to go.

This was very good I would definitely make again. However, I think I would marinade the chicken before coating them with the crumbs. I added alot of seasoning to the crumbs but it still was a little bland.

Easy to make. I didn't have the right ingredients on hand. For the cheese, I used pre-packaged shredded Mexican. For the crumbs, I crushed nacho chips. To add color, I plated the chicken with scoops of sour cream and salsa. My family (2 yr old, 8 yr old and husband) goggled the chicken up.

Pretty good.  I shredded a little more cheese to sprinkle on top of each chicken breast which gave it more cheese flavor.  My husband liked it a lot.

PERFECT. I used a little more cheddar cheese and didn't have any parmesan. Added the extra mixture to the chicken and it was really crispy. I aslo found that it is lovely if you cut the chicken breast in half and add mixture to the middle. My boyfriend wants it at least once a week now, which is suprising as I'm the worst cook he knows!!

This recipe is awesome and could not be any easier.  My husband, 4 year old and 1 year old all love it and that says it all.  I do, however, cut the breasts up in strips.  It is easier for the kids and cuts the cooking time down.

Yummy!   I put the coating ingredients into a plastic storage bag, add the chicken pieces two at a time and shake!  This recipe is so easy and tasty!  Thanks!

I must have done something terribly wrong!  This chicken turned out extremely greasy and the coating didn't stick to the chicken very well.

This recipe is soooo delicious and EASY!! I just added some salt and pepper to my desired taste.  Oh I used this for my drumsticks, so it does need a little extra time in the oven. It sure beats buying KFC or Popeyes any day.

had trouble getting the mix to adhere to the chicken. was it the melted butter instead of an egg bath? don't know, and probably won't find out...there are too many good chicken recipes available to bother fussing with this.

Was not one of my favorites. I should have crushed the corn flakes more (even though I crushed them quite a bit already) because the corn flakes didn't blend well with the rest of the dish. I do, however, like the parmesan but there could have been a lot more cheese on it. Next time (if I do make it again) I will try putting half crackers, half corn flakes.

This is recipe is super easy to follow and tastes great!  It's very versatile and easy to change up if you're lacking ingredients (last time we realized we didn't have Cornflakes, so we crushed up some Ritz Crackers... woah, talk about YUM).  Very kid friendly, full of flavor and easy to make.

Just made this for dinner and my boyfriend, the pickiest eater ever, loved it! I did too. I took someone's advice and cover the chicken with foil for the first half of cooking to keep the outside crispy...which it was. So simple and yummy!

I WILL make this dish again - mainly based on the simplicity! We had the ingredients on hand, the prep was simple and popping it  the oven even better! It's not a fancy dish, but my family enjoyed it and had seconds. I will probably add a little garlic next go around, but overall a good basic dish!

This was my first time using cornflakes to cook with. Wow I love the crunch they gave the chicken. My 9 year old daughter loved it so much she wants leftovers for dinner tomorrow. Thats a lot to say considering we never eat leftovers.I made it as stated except added a lot more cheese. Thanks for posting.

I used lowfat yogurt and spices (salt, pepper, parsley, a few flakes of red pepper) instead of melted butter, and it turned out well!  I sliced the breasts into strips, so BBQ sauce for dipping also helped.

This recipe is very, very good, in all ways, it is easy to prepare, and tastes very good.  I have shared this recipe with several friends.  I use a little more corn flakes and cheddar cheese and sprinkle the leftovers over the chicken in the baking dish, I also drizzle the remaining butter over the chicken.  EXCELLENT !!!!!!

Pretty good!  I often use cornflake crumbs, and the parmesan and cheddar made a nice addition to my usual chicken dinner!  I have also fried it on top of the stove, adding the cheddar on top at the very end--also very good!

I made this only because I had almost nothing in the house at the time to make a "good" dinner.  Boy was I surprised!  This dish quickly turned into a household favorite, though I admit to throwing the leftover butter in the baking dish..healthy?  Nope, but the chicken turns out way tender.

I feed a large group of boys every night and this recipe is a hit.  I used chicken tenderloins instead breast halves and it works great.  If there are any leftovers, they are gone as soon as I put them out.  I v'e made it twice and it still gets raves.  Thank you

this went over great!  I did follow some of the suggestions of other ratings.  I broiled for the last 5 minutes, added garlic salt and cayenne pepper ( just a little), and poured the excess butter and topping over the dish before cooking.  Thanks!!!!

I made this last weekend and it was good. Used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. I put too much cheddar so it was a bit salty. I marinated the chicken with olive oil and oregano and it really brought up the taste.

This was really good.  I read through the reviews and noticed that a lot of people said it was bland...so I added a bunch of spices to the cornflakes...I used Chili Powder, Paprika, Garlic Salt, Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper...and I did the rest the same.  It was awesome!  Also I ran out of the mixture so I had to make some more real quick...and I used 5 boneless skinless breasts...but I piled a lot of the mixture on each one so they all had a thick coating.
I used Chedderella (white/orange cheese mixture)instead of Cheddar and a lot more than the recipe called for...same for the Parmesean...more than the amount called for....I really liked it.  
It was crunchy on the outside and very tender and juicy on the inside.  ;o)

This is easy to prepare and good when you're running low on ingredients, but veerrrry bland. I was not wild about this. However, add some dry ranch dressing mix to this and I guarantee you will not be sorry! I'm rating this only 3 stars because as is. it's too bland.

Ok,  I'm sorry to say it, but this was boring unoriginal.  I ran out of ingredients in the kitchen so decided to make this.  The chicken had no taste, and the ingredients certainly don't enhance any flavor of the chicken.  It's alright if you're hungry and haven't gone to the grocery though.

Excellent!  My husband and I both love this.  I add about a handful more of cheddar cheese in the mix than the recipe calls for.  I also use only four chicken breasts and pour the remaining topping mixture on top of the already coated chicken.  Very yummy and easy!

I'm a huge fan of cheese so I couldn't wait to try this. It turned out very dry and bland. Ended up giving most of it to the dog, who had no complaints at all!

This is very tasty, very easy and VERY rich. I followed the recipe with the exception that I added some pepper and garlic salt. I did not have a problem with the coating staying on the chicken. It's a keeper! Thanks.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  My picky husband raved about it and my kids, 9 and 4, told me it was the best!  I substituted Special K for the cornflakes and I pounded the chicken breasts flat before baking.  Then I put the chicken under the broiler for 5 min or so after it was finished baking, to crisp it up a bit.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

What a great recipe!  The cheese mixture doesn't stick to the chicken very well, but it works just fine to pour the mixture onto the chicken in the pan.  I also poured a little extra melted butter over the top before sticking it in the oven.  The chicken is nice and juicy, and the cheesy topping is great!

This was an excellent recipe....it was super-easy and tasted great. I did take the advice from 
previous reviews and rubbed on a bit of garlic powder to each piece of chicken, and also added extra
cheddar to the top of each piece about 10 mins before they were done. I am 15 years old and was
able to handle this recipe, never having cooked chicken before for fear of touching raw chicken
but it wasn't too bad and the end result made it worth it! Very easy and reallllly delicious!!!!

I thought this was very good.  I was a little skeptical at first, but even my *very* picky 3-year-old ate a few bites, so it must be good.  :)  It was very easy, but I found that the coating didn't stick very well.  I ended up putting the chicken in the pan and pressing the coating onto the chicken.  That worked pretty well.  We will definitely make this again.

My girlfriend and I liked this though we both agreed that you really do need to add more cheddar than the recipe calls for.  Next time I plan to add more cheddar about 10 minutes before the chicken is done.  I added some red pepper and chili sauce to the mixture to spice it up some.

This recipe is pretty good,but nothing to write home about.  It definitely needs salt or some other seasoning.  I salted the chicken before coating it and it still seemed a little bland.  I think cheddar cheese has a strange taste to it when it is baked like this.  Still it is a relatively fast dinner idea that is a little different and very easy to make.

I never thought of making chicken with a cheddar coating before and I loved it! I made it with butter crackers instead of cornflakes and it still tasted good.

This was so simple and easy! I loved it. I used crushed crackers and shredded colby jack cheese because I didn't have the cornflakes or the cheddar. Still tasted great! It is a keeper! Thanks!

Goodness this was yummy!!!  I do not like
chicken very much and have been searching 
for a recipe that I would like.  This is it!!!
Hubby and kids loved it too, no leftovers 
and I wanted there to be so I could have 
it again for lunch.  It's a keeper.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. I added and substituted some things like, I substituted the chicken halves with chicken cutlets and added a tablespoon of red chili flakes, add 1 teaspoon of cracked black pepper, also added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the melted butter.

I added diced tomatoes and chilies on top.  It is awesome.  It's a must have.

Added some seasoning (garlic/herb for this time).  Had some topping left over so put it on tilapia... yum!  Both picky kids liked both the chicken and the fish!

Fantastic recipe! Have made it many times and it never fails. Simple and straightforward. Family loves it and are always asking for it. Works well in the air fryer too. Definitely a 5/5, thanks for sharing.

It was alright. A little bland, and couldn't taste the cheddar at all. Maybe with some doctoring it would be more interesting.

Cooking time was perfect, I made sure i packed on the topping used medium thickness breasts. I will be putting this in the rotation. Easy and for those saying it's too salty, use grated Parmesan, not the kind in the can. I may even try it as a casserole with cream of chicken soup. I had to use Ritz crackers because i didn't have cornflakes, but i'm sure it's great with the flakes too.

SUCCESS!!!??. I was searching for an easy & fast recipe, with ingredients I already had at home...and, this was it! I'm only cooking for two. So, I used half amount of chicken listed on recipe. And, it was very tasty! (I didn't even think that it needed any dipping sauce!??). The chicken was cooked perfectly & was very moist. I will definitely be adding this to my list of "Go To" meals! The only thing I would change is the name of the dish (bc it's more than just the cheddar that makes it great)... "Crispy & Cheesy Chicken" maybe is what I'll call it. Thanks for the recipe, Karen! ??

Great recipe...my whole family loved it, including my very picky 9 year old.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter in an effort to reduce the fat and calories.  This one is a keeper!

Really good but make sure you don't melt the cheddar cheese with the butter. LOL Made it really hard to coat the chicken.

My son and daughter liked this fairly well, although they said the cheddar taste was not too noticeable. I was able to make the recipe in two versions, one as written and the other with fresh breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes for my son, who can't eat cornflakes. A good, basic, kid-friendly recipe. Thanks!

It was okay. The idea sounds good but the taste is pretty bland and it just doesn't get very well coated. I don't think I'll be making this again.

MMMMM,Delicious! I am new to cooking, and this is the first thing I have made. I loved it. I send a picture to my husband and he is begging me to cook it for dinner. I don't mind eating it again, because it really hit the spot. I didn't have cornflakes so I substituted with Special K. I gently crushed the Special K, to preserve the crunchiness. We will definitely be adding this to our weekly menu. It's healthy, quick, yummy, and simple. What more could you ask for?!

I finally found my recipe for chicken sandwiches! I put a hamburger bun, the fat free shredded cheese, and garlic/onion powder in my food processor until its the consistency of bread crumbs..Mix a little ranch/dijon together to dip the chicken then coated the chicken with my bread/cheese mix..after they are coated, I pressed the left over mix onto the pieces (stuck REALLY well when the cheese is cut up with the bread crumbs) cooked for 20 minutes, flipped half way...AMAZING! the cheese wasnt hard like some people said they got, melty and delicious!

This was very good. I discovered that I was out of cornflakes at the last minute and substitued chrushed Doritos. Tasted great. Will try again with the corn flakes.

Was worried about the cheese sticking so let it out until the end and sprinkled it con top. Was most dissappointed that you couldn't taste the cheese even when using a sharp variety. Wasn't bad just thought we would like more. I think I"m starting to find I prefer bread crumb to cornflakes . Probably won't make again.

This is so quick and easy. Instead of corn flakes I use Panko - Japanese bread crumbs. I liked it better than when I used the corn flakes.

So easy and delicious! I subsituted corn flakes for the rice cereal and used under a cup (you will have a lot of extra crumb mixture anyway.)  Add cheddar cheese shavings to the top for an extra cheesy delight!

This is very kid-friendly, but too plain for adults with more sophisticated taste.  I'd serve it (chicken finger or nugget size) at a BBQ as a side dish.  It tastes good, but like I said, kind of too plain for us.

This was easy, and my family ate it - but to me, it was missing something.  I thought it was bland and a bit greasy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

FANTASTIC!  Oh i loved this chicken so much!  I used the butter, but put 2 garlic cloves in it while it was simmering to add some extra flavor.  I also used saltines since i had no cornflakes, but it turned out fabulous.  10 minutes before it was done, i sprinkled more cheese on top.  Made a crispy cheesey top layer, which was so good.  I am making this again for my dad in a few days because he loved it so much!

I cut my breasts into small pieces and added garlic powder, onion powder and some other seasonings to jazz it up including a small amount of ranch dip seasoning. I increased the amount of cheddar cheese and used the butter method. While this was O.K., it wasn't anything that I went nuts over. Will not be making again. Can't get past the mushy kind of texture even though I used my convection oven on this.

What a great chicken dish!  I dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter as some reviewers said.  The chicken was very moist.  I also added some spices - a little garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  Add extra Cheddar cheese and cornflakes so you have some left to top the chicken off before you bake it.  I also melted some butter and drizzled it on top of the chicken before I baked it.  This is definitely going in my recipe folder.  Oh...and PS. The kids ate it with no complaints!

This was a pretty good basic recipe but I did make a few changes. I cut the chicken into nuggets so it would be more toddler friendly and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, & garlic powder before coating the chicken. Next time I will try adding a packet of dry ranch dressing as another reviewer suggested.

This was overall a very tasty recipe.  The only change I"ll make next time is to use egg instead of the butter to coat the chicken.  I hard a hard time getting the crumbs to stick to the butter.

This chicken was simple and delicious! I definetely agree with another reviewer that spices are required so I added onion powder, garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. These absolutely gave the chicken its flavor.

This is very yummy. I did add a packet of dry ranch dressing mix as one person suggested. I also did not use the butter. I coated the chicken pieces in mayo. This doesn't come out "crispy" but it is still moist & very good. This is one of our new favorites!

There were numerous reviews that said how bland this recipe was. I really hope they were all novice cooks because any experienced cook could see that this would be a mild dish. For those of you out there who are just beginning, please keep in mind that almost everything should be seasoned. Throw in anything that appeals to you. I'm a big garlic and onion powder freak with the addition of cayenne pepper. Add a bit of what you like and take a sniff; if it smells good, go with it; if you think it needs more, give it more. Karen, this was a great base for the chicken and with more spices, it was fabulous! We really loved it and my gang and I thank you for a terrific dinner tonight!!!!

This recipe is extremely easy and tastes great. I never even bother to measure out the cornflakes and cheese anymore exactly anymore because I found that it tastes great no matter what. Also, this recipe is easy to scale down.

This was tender chicken with a crispy coating.  Pretty good, though I could have used a little more spice in this meal (served with potatoes). Next time will try with a more spicy sidedish to complement flavors.

My boyfriend LOVES this recipe. He tells everyone about it, so everyone then asks me for the recipe. He asks me to make it at least once a week, plus he wants me to make extra so he can take it to lunch the next day. I'm not a big fan of chicken, but this recipe is great!

Wow! Good and rich. It doesn't really get crispy on the outside, but the kids still really liked it. I cut the chicken into strips to make it more appealing to the kids. I turned on the broiler at the end to get it a little browner. I will definitely be making this again. It was pretty easy, too. Oh, also, I didn't have regular shredded cheddar so I used the shredded cheese for tacos and that was really yummy.

Very good and very easy.  I made it using only 2 tbsps. of butter.  I found that enough to coat the chicken breasts.  Will be making this often, I think.

This chicken was awesome! I added lots more cheese cuz we LOVE cheese and I also added bacon bits because I had a whole bag left over from the night before! I think that really improved the taste! We really liked the chicken and thought it was very moist and was VERY impressed with this meal! Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

This recipe is soooo delicious! My kids and husband loved it. I took some of the suggestions posted and added twice the cheddar cheese. Also since I used only 4 large chicken breasts, I took ramaining melted butter and mixed it with the cornflake mixture. I then poured it on top of the already coated chicken. Worked great and no waste.

After reading the reviews I added a little garlic powder and onion powder as well as salt/pepper and it came out great. I cut my chicken breasts in half (long ways) to make them thinner and should have adjusted the cooking time b/c mine turned out a little on the dry side.  Very tasty with an interesting crunch!

Everyone in the family loved this. I had my In-laws over for dinner and this was a hit. My mother-in-law even requested the recipe. I found that the coating doesn't stick very well though. Other than that, it GREAT!

The coating was really good, but the chicken was really bland.  Might have to invent a dip for this.

Excellent!  I added some garlic powder to the mixture, and sprinkled some extra cheese on top about 10 minutes before it was done baking. The chicken was very moist. A definate keeper.

Wonderful Recipe!  It's a keeper.  Works well with Rice Krispie Crumbs too.  I add a little "Mrs. Dash" for extra zip.

Thanks Karen, this is a really great, easy recipe!  My boyfriend and I just finished eating this wonderful chicken, and we have no complaints!  The only thing I did differently was add a few spices for a little spunk.  Thanks again!

GREAT RECIPE. Instead of using butter to coat the chicken, I used low fat mayonnaise; the corn flake mixture adhered well to the meat. It was a little messy, but it turned out really moist and yummy. Everyone asked for seconds...

This recipe was GREAT for a quick, yet different baked chicken recipe.  My husband absolutely loved and wants me to make it again--often!  Actually, I did not have corn flakes, but I used crushed up LIFE cereal and it worked great.  Tasty!

I liked this recipe because I thought it was fast and easy.  I put some extra seasoning to spice it up a little.  I served it with a side salad and chicken flavored RiceaRoni for a super easy meal.  Everyone loved it!

These were pretty good, though I did find it hard to get the coating to stick to the chicken.  I drizzled the left over butter on the chicken.  I also added garlic powder to the coating.  I will absolutely make this again!!

Made this last night.  My husband loved it, I thought it was a little bland.  I think next time I'm going to add some chili powder and save some of the extra cheese/corn flakes & put it on half way through the cooking, so that there's a little moisture left in the cheese when it's done.  Overall though, it was a quick & easy recipe & I'll most likely make it again.

I'm an extremely inexperienced cook, and this recipe was delicious and easy for even someone like me!  Replaced the cheddar and parmesan with low fat mozzarella, and the recipe was delicious!  The cheese was warm and gooey, and the chicken was unbelievably tender.  Will DEFINITELY make again.

Chicken turned out moist and delicious!  Next time we will try adding a little kick (ground red pepper to the crumbs or a bit of tabasco in the butter)  Definitely a keeper!!!

Delicious!  I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings for my fiancee and I and we both loved it!  After I placed the breasts in the pan I sprinkled the extra cheese mixture on top for a little extra cheesiness.  Yum!

This chicken was a hit at my party...I used half breast filets, half de-boned and skinned thies, and I placed the chicken on a roaster, so both sides would get crispy.  And it's easy and quick as well!

I just didn't like the taste.....I think it was just my own particular tastes. I could see kids really liking it though.

Both my husband and I loved this recipe, but you must follow the directions, I didn't use the correct portions and it wasn't good.

The chicken was tender and the crunchy crust was mouth wateringly delicous.

I have never made chicken this good and it was so simple.  I will use this from now on whenever I am requested to make Fried Chicken.  A+ in my book.

I had never made baked chicken before, and I can't believe how easy it was. Sprinkling more cheese on them right before they came out of the oven made it extra cheezy!

I liked this; my husband isn't a big fan of chicken and cheese anything. He did say he wouldn't mind having this again. I thought it had great flavor and something a little different from the ordinary baked chicken.
