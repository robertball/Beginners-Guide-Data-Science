With a bumper crop of cucumbers this summer, I've been looking for all the recipes using cucumbers I can find.  I've found several different pickling recipes - this one is the best!
I love the fact that it has no sugar in it. and it is easy to do.  I made this for a potluck - it was a big hit.  As a matter of fact, they all wanted the left overs!  (So I made more and gave them away).  I followed the recipe but  used very little chili pepper since I do not like heat.
