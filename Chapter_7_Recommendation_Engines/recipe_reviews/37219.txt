Very interesting and good recipe!  I used thawed frozen corn because I was unable to get fresh.  I did, however, use fresh hierloom tomatoes from the farmer's market, and fresh basil from my basil plant, so there was a lot of fresh-ness going on.  ;)   next time I would add more basil.  I also sliced the tomatoes instead of doing wedges.  Served with fresh canteloupe for a good Sunday brunch!

I liked it a lot.  The tomatoes and egg were a good combination.  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe, although I did use some egg whites instead of whole eggs.

Quick, easy and delicious, all in one skillet! It't colorful and would make a beautiful brunch dish for company (if you can get it out of your pan in one piece, which takes just a bit of skill!) I've always used frozen corn for this recipe. In a pinch I've substituted sweet or plain onions for the green onions and it still tastes great. I have even used dried basil but fresh basil leaves make it taste better and look more elegant. The recipe says "1 1/2 finely chopped basil" without a measurement - I took that to mean 1 1/2 fresh leaves and it seemed about right.

Very good flavor, I especially liked the taste of the fresh basil.  The presentation of the dish is very colorful and would be a nice dish to serve for company. I have added this omelet to my recipe box and will make again.

Yum. I didn't use tomatoes and substituted spring onions for the corn kernels,
since I didn't have these at hand, and the result was still yummy! I particularly
liked the extra flavor added by basil and the melted cheese on top.

This recipe was good, but I think I will make a few changes next time.  First of all, I'd slice the tomatoes as the wedges didn't cook at all and were quite hard.  Secondly, I'd use a lower heat as I found that the bottom of the omelette cooked a lot faster than the top.  But that could have been because I forgot to add the milk.  Also, I used dried basil and I think it would have better fresh.

We liked this...the basil adds great flavor and you can change the type of vegetables too.  I want to try spinach and mushrooms next time. We did add the tomatoes earlier than written so they would cook up a little. We also added two more eggs.
