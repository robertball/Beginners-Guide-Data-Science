Best escargots I've ever tasted!  Made some changes. I prepared this as an entree for my husband and me.  The can said 12 escargots but there were actually 15.  I used 10 "stuffing mushrooms" (large) and put 2 escargots in the largest ones.  Had to use a larger baking dish.  Increased the garlic to about 4 cloves (we LOVE garlic!) and the white wine and heavy cream to 1/2 cup each.  Also increased the tarragon to 1/2 teaspoon.  Removed the mushroom caps to the baking dish before adding the cream mixture to the escargots in the pan and sprinkled a little kosher salt over it.  Didn't measure the Parmesan, just sprinkled over the entire dish before baking.  Baked for 15 minutes and browned lightly under the broiler.  The wine was chardonnay.  This is heaven in a dish!  Don't know how it would have been as leftovers as we had none!!  You won't regret trying this one!

We had escargot in the house, but no mushrooms, so we made this recipe without the mushrooms. It was fantastic! The mushrooms would only have been an added bonus. The sauce was to die for!

Glad everyone has enjoyed these! Made a twist on them today for a potluck (as many folk do not like/won't even try Escargots LOL). Basically the same recipe, but a filling of precooked and diced crab and shrimp instead of the escargot, with some diced celery and roasted red pepper.  And add it near the end of step 4 to avoid over cooking, not at step 3. everything else remains the same.

My husband loved it!  I didn't have any tarragon, so I added some parsley to the sauce.  It was really good and I'm not a big fan of escargot.  Will make it again.

Very, very good! I would recommend using fresh snails over canned, less of that canned taste. Make sure you have big mushrooms also.

These were really good, kind of sloppy looking, but really good.  My husband really liked them.  I was hoping for more of a wine taste, but that could have been because I had no cream and had to use evaporated milk instead.  Will make again!

While these were good, there just wasn't a "wow" factor. I will try them again and tweak the recipe a bit.

Delicious.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I made the recipe without.  Next time I will buy the mushrooms to stuff the escargot in.  I upped the garlic to 3-4 cloves instead of just 1.  I also decreased the butter. Next time I think i will add some olive oil during baking.  I love to dunk the bread in the sauce.. but it was quite thick. So if I can just get a little more runny consistancy (maybe decrease the flour & add a little evoo) it will be perfect for bread dipping at the end.  Yummo.

Mixed snails with some salad shrimp. Since no one allergic to seafood in my family, I didn't tell them what the mushrooms were stuffed with and they still loved them when they found out. Very filling. Used larger mushrooms than buttons.

It has a beautiful sauce that goes over the escargot but I just wish I had added more garlic.

Easy and delicious. I made these twice. Both times turned out great but the first time I used large mushrooms and they turned out better). Both times I had some extra mushrooms so I poured the sauce over those and it worked well for the people who didn't want to eat snails. It made a convert of my husband who claimed to hate escargot. They are difficult to make look really nice but I guess that's the trade off you make for their saucy goodness.

Thank you for this fantastic recipe. I did double the garlic but made it exactly as written. Fantastic!  I will try it with crab instead of escargot the next time because of the cost of the escargot.  This sauce could be put on anything.

We made this using frozen snails from the Asian supermarket. They tasted fine but were quite rubbery. I would advise against using frozen. I'd like to try again using canned or fresh to see if the results are the same.

This is a perfect recipe if you like escargot and are trying to work up the courage to buy canned snails and make it at home.  Very simple and tasty recipe, but we found it too heavy with butter and cream and the sauce too thick for our tastes.

I didn't have enough mushrooms on hand so I chopped them. Followed the recipe religiously. We ate it with Turkish herb bread. My picky eater husband raved that it was really really good. He asked me to pack the left overs for his lunch tomorrow. Will certainly make it again and again!

Nice recipe.  I added more garlic but really needs about 3-4 cloves.  I sliced the mushrooms and added shallots and served in pastry cups.  Yummy.

Omg was delicious. I did prep it all in the afternoon before my guests arrived. When it came time for dinner, then I put the cheese on it and baked it. Turned out fabulous! Will definitely make this again.

I didn't have white wine and had no desire to buy any; hate it. So I subbed Welch's White Grape juice. OMG WHO WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?! THESE ESCARGOT ARE AMAZING! Best ones I've ever had.

A really nice alternative to traditional escargot.
I prepare escargot at least once a month and typically as part of our entrée. Adding the mushrooms really adds volume and it was just a bit too much, for us. The flavor and presentation is really good. I think if I prepare it again I will serve it as an appetizer planning 3 per person. My only "adds" were a light dusting of bread crumbs before baking ...... and I broiled the last 3 minutes of the bake time.
