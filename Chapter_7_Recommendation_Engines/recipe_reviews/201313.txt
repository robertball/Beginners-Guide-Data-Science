These little bit sized mini subs of tastiness, are keepers for our family!  I would have given these 5 STARS if I hadn't tweaked it to make it healthy.  First I used 97% lean ground turkey instead of ground beef to lower the fat and calories.  I left out the green onion and decided to saut√© the onion before adding it to the meatball mixture to add a little more moisture. I was able to get 15 nice sized mini meatballs.  I jar my own marinara which has all fresh ingredients so I chose to use that for the sauce, I used whole wheat rolls for the subs, and I also used low moisture, low fat mozzarella.

My husband loved this recipe!  I made several small meatballs (instead of large ones) and substituted bread crumbs for the crackers.  This was such an easy recipe and I'd definitely make it again!

These turned out great! I followed the recipe except baked (first bake, not the cheese melting bake) them for an additional 8 minutes b/c I forgot to set the timer!! But they were just fine. I served two on whole wheat brat buns and it was perfect. My husband, picky eater, told me to make these again soon! Yay!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used my own meatball recipe, but this idea is great! I also made them before hand, baked for 15 min @ 350 to get them browned, and them put them in the crockpot on low for 6 hours with pasta sauce and they turned out great!!

Amazing! Best meatball subs I have made. Subbed italian bread crumbs for the crackers and did not add salt. Used a slice of provolone instead of shredded cheese. Wow!

I'm a new member to Allrecipes and so far this is the #1 recipe I've made from here. It won't make a difference if you don't add the onions and green peppers. I used Ritz Crackers and boy did the meatballs taste great. I think I'll use Ritz when making meatloaf too.

These are wonderful sandwiches! We designated them "Meatball Sliders". :) I followed the recipe as written and served them on A.R.'s French Bread Rolls to Die For. I flattened the meatballs a little, so they were almost like little patties so they'd fit nicely on the rolls without moving around too much. I used Hunt's Garlic & Herb spaghetti sauce. Yum! Will definitely use again!

These were surprisingly good! I found one recipe made about 15 meatballs. We used hoagie buns and put 3-4 balls per sandwich. I also cut the amount of green pepper in half, as they were getting a little "chunky". Also, we only used about 1/4 the amount of sauce.

Oh my! The meatballs smelled so good while they were baking and when it was simmering in the spaghetti sauce - I was inhaling the aroma from my backyard! I made Buttery Pan Rolls (recipe also on this site) to use as the dinner rolls and added cheddar cheese along with the other cheeses. It was very delicious! Thanks for sharing matykada!

Very easy and quick to make, I served it on hoagie rolls so I made smaller meatballs and simmered in the sauce for about an hour and they turned out great.

We love this :) My daughter boyfriend wants it when ever he is with us. Its a big hit. But I would bake it all. Simmer it in the oven. Less mess and cooked great.

These were very good and simple. I'd never made meatballs before this and had now idea how they would turn out. DELICIOUS, that's how! Next time I might add a little more seasoning to them, but other than that this was a fantastic recipe.

What an ingenious idea!  Loved the recipe.  Could easily be tailored to be quicker and easier, if you wanted.  Use frozen meatballs and it would speed the entire thing up.  However, written as is, is so good.  I toasted my rolls with some butter and garlic, along with the cheese before topping with meatballs.  Use the leftover sauce for dipping.  Amazingly good and a definite keeper!

These were adorable!  I made my own mini meatballs in the crockpot, cut them in half so they were small on the dinner rolls, sprinkled some parmesan cheese, topped with mozzerella & toasted them in the oven for 5 mins.  I took them to a party & they were a big hit!!  thanks!

Quick and easy. I used ground chicken and soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce. My husband fell in love with this dish. It's a keeper. Next time i'll use spagehetti sauce in the jar for more flavor and a thicker sauce.

My husband requested meatball subs for dinner and I had never made them before so I came to allrecipes for help.  I omitted the crackers and instead of making the mini version, I used regular Italian rolls and put three meatballs on each roll.  Excellent!!!

So much for big sloppy mess!  These worked well and will be a star at our HOA  party which I host yearly on Memorial day!  Had neighbors rate them and each one was a ten by our rating system.  Will have several more favorites from this site. Thanks PJ.

These turned out wonderfully!  I used italian bread crumbs in lieu of the crackers, just because I needed to use them.  I also omitted the egg and did not miss it.  I used Ragu Chunky Garden Combination spaghetti sauce.  I made "French Baguette" recipe by Judy Taubert from this site and they were perfect for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Matykada!

This was a nice surprise in my drab weekly menu. Which is exactly why I joined this site.  My hubby loved these. I made the meatballs golf ball sized and rowed them up on whole wheat hot dog buns.  We used reg crackers and no green onion. delish!

These were so amazing and simple. I actually used 1/2 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound mild Italian sausage. The meatballs were so juicy and full of flavor. This is a permanent on my meal plan now!

Hubby & I absolutely loved these & our 3 kids ....did not. The older 2 gave honest efforts & the youngest was done after 1 bite(& he'll eat ANYTHING with ground beef in it, especially anything we call a meatball). I think it was the green pepper that threw them off. I'm still rating this a 5 because I think it truly deserves it! I'll def make these again to have on hand just for me & hubby. Thank you!

Tasty recipe, and pretty easy. Though it would be way easier to just buy frozen meatballs like another person said, but where is the fun in that!? Like suggested, I made normal sized meatballs (about 15) and used hot dog buns to make an actual mini sub. But they didn't hold up, so I will probably use real hoagie/sub buns next time.

This recipe was great! I made this for my duty crew and they all loved it. I didnt do the rolls, or make them into mini's though. I also used my own home-made marinara sauce instead of using spaghetti sauce. Was very tasty!

Five star idea. I used my own meatball recipe (hubby's favorite) and made my own dinner rolls. It turned out fantastic. I was expecting to want more, but was surprised by how filling they were.

These were EXCELLENT! Loved the flavor. The only thing that I will change next time is to cut down on the amount of pepper. 1 tsp. black pepper was just a bit too much for our tastes. Next time I will use no more than 3/4 tsp. BUT! This one is definitely worth making and we will be making it again!

I made these with Panko bread crumbs and lean meat and lower in fat cheeses.  No peppers either.  Also, Bertolli has a 5 cheese marinara sauce that was perfect for right flavor.  My family liked them. I also made these like small hamburger patties to keep them from sliding off.  I would make again.  It is so versatile.  Can make sandwiches or throw on pasta with leftover ones.

I made these last night and they turned out fabulous. My husband said he LOVED them. This recipe is definitely worth the effort. I used a jar of Newmans Own Marinara Sauce. It was delish. I was able to get about 15 meatballs from a lb of meat. Going to have leftovers tonight and serve with a side salad.

A definite 5 star recipe, for ease and taste.  My family absolutely loved them.  I did skip the green pepper, because my little guy isn't big on peppers.  Otherwise, this will be a definite keeper and made again in my house.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasted Great. I used sliced mozzerella instead of shreaded and cut the meatballs in half on the bread for easier eating. It was easier than I thought it would be. Will be making this again!

This was awesome......we used hoagie rolls and made it a meal with a salad......my kids woke up this morning asking when we would be having this again!! Plus they loved helping me make them....It was quick and easy and the best part is it was YUMMY!!! I did use bread crumbs instead of the crackers, but it still turned out great. Next time I will make a double batch of the meatballs so I can freeze them for another meal!!

These are a big hit! My room mates ask me to make these all the time! I changed it up for a quicker solution. I bought & cooked swedish meatballs & used garlic tomato paste. Put cheese on both insides of the bun & when they were done, I quickly put them back in the oven with cheese ontop to let it melt. Thank you for the idea!

Excellent, Excellent recipe!  I doubled the recipe and it made 35 meatballs.  I used ground turkey, but followed all the other directions.  The adults ate it on rolls and the kids had the meatballs and sauce over spaghetti.  The best meatball recipe I've tasted.

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made smaller meatballs and used them on sub rolls.  My husband and 2 sons loved them.  It's so difficult to find something that everyone in my family really likes, so I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you.

These were great-so much flavor!  I made them into patties and broiled them, then simmered them in the spaghetti sauce.  Will definitley make again.

Wow! Very good. I didn't use the green pepper and added a little more garlic and worcestershire sauce. Also instead of dinner rolls I cut up the meatballs in the sauce and filled up a hoagy. Very happy with this recipe.

A very good meatball recipe and easy too.  I did add some fresh garlic to the meatballs and made these on hoagie buns with mozzarella on top.  I also added some ricotta cheese and black olives to the sauce.  I broiled these subs after assembling them to toast them.  They went over very well with everyone!  I will make again!

Wow! SUPER yum!!! My hubs and I REALLY enjoyed these. :) Although I already have a favorite meatball sub recipe (BIGGUY728), I'll also be adding this one to my menu rotation. While I thought the meatballs were fine as is, my husband was not a fan of the green bell pepper in them. I guess I'll have to leave that ingredient out next time. :(  NOTE: I was afraid that the Rhodes brand garlic butter rolls I purchased would be too soft to use for my mini subs, but I was wrong. They held up perfectly and were SUPER tasty. You can find these in your grocer's frozen foods aisle (near the garlic bread, etc.). Homemade pasta salad and kettle chips completed our simple meal. My neighbor stopped by for leftovers and was BLOWN away!!! We ALL thank you SO much for sharing your recipe, matykada! :-)

YUM!  These were off-the-charts good!  The only minor change I made was to use a red bell pepper instead of the green one.  I chopped it and the onion VERY fine.  Will be putting this one in my regular rotation.

When I saw this recipe, I knew I just had to try it!  My pound of hamburger made a lot more than 8 meatballs........it made 15!!  Maybe I just made them smaller.  They all fit nicely in the pot with the sauce.  They smelled so good in the oven and also in the pot on the stove.  I used left over hot dog buns from a few nights earlier but I followed the recipe exactly.  FAntastic!!  My husband raved and the boys (who live elsewhere) showed up just in time to eat and there were NO leftovers!!  Thanks for the recipe that will now be put in rotation at our house.

These are easy to make and I liked them, my husband thought they were fantastic. Next time I will probably try substituting half the crackers with wheat germ to add a little more nutrition to the dish.

Great!  I made these for they guys for lunch while they were roofing.  I made full size subs using whole wheat hoagies.  I used a little less onion and green pepper and added red pepper.  They had some spice to them.  I also toasted the buns first and then made the sandwhiches and toasted them like the recipe says.  The bread didn't get soggy this way.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, I will use it again.

I change the serving size and put 3 meatballs in each hoagie bread. These turned out delicious. Would make again.

I added onion powder and Italian seasoning to the meatball mixture.  So good, and my family demolished them- the mini version gave you just the right amount of bread cheese and meatball...great recipe!

I‚Äôve made this a few times now.  My family of 8 all love it and I have even turned it into a giant meatloaf before.  The only adjustment I make to this recipe is to double or triple it!

I made these to have with a romantic partner before a school dance and we made a ton of jokes about having to wear casual clothes while eating to protect our nicer clothes from drips, but we could have been in full white and been fine! Also they tasted AWESOME!

These were good, but it is difficult to get much cheese on them as the buns are so small and the meatball takes up most of the space.  The spaghetti sauce needs spicing up (which I did).  I also put these in the crockpot  rather than simmering on the stove which worked well.

I only needed a very small jar of sauce. The meatballs were done in the oven in 20 minutes so they didn‚Äôt need to cook in the sauce. Tasted great!

I didn't change the recipe too much. I did put half red peppers and half green peppers, to kind of sweeten it up a tad. I also did a combination of turkey, beef and pork instead of just 1 pound of all ground beef. I used a red onion, but that's just because they're my favourite.  And finally, I was able to get 40 small meatballs out of this recipe. I absolutely love this recipe! It's not only going to get saved in my favourites, but I'm getting a hard copy into my recipe binder ASAP!

I'll definitely make this again! It was a big hit in our house. I used hoagies instead of rolls, & made the meatballs a tad smaller, but otherwise made them exactly as called for, & they were GREAT! Thanks for the yummy recipe :)

I made these this eve. for dinner.  The first batch I made were soggy on the bottom.  The 2nd batch I made I flipped them 1/2 way through.  They came out much better.  Other than that a really easy and tasty recipe.  I will make again.

A great little mini sandwich.  I had mini buns to use up and this recipe has been hangin' out in my recipe box since June 2011.  It was a perfect pair - mini meatball + mini buns = delicious.
