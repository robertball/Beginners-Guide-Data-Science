These are great cookies, very sweet.  Be sure to sift flour, I didn't and had too much. If you don't be sure to use 1/4 cup less.

This was really easy to make, however I used full Truvia rather than the blend. First, I had a hard time with the dough. It was very crumbly and didn't stick real well. Then when I went to press the crisscross pattern with the fork, if I pressed too much and they tried to fall apart, so I had to make gentle presses. The cookies are a bit dry. I'm not sure what I think yet.

These cookies were too dry and crumbly.
Also did not have the expected flavor when made with stevia and not real sugar.

Felt like a waste of good peanut butter!

Needs more moisture, very crumbly, cannot press down with fork without cookies breaking apart.  I reduced flour by 1/4 cup as Angela suggested....ok but no nice criss cross impression.  Next time will add a bit more peanut butter as well, maybe a bit more shortening as well.
