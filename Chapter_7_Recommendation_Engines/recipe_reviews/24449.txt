This recipe is more like a gingersnaps recipe rather than a soft and/or chewy gingerbread people recipe.  However, they were really tasty and worked well with cutouts.

The icing recipe worked very well.  We added food coloring and it was great!

These were wonderful. My son says they are nice and moist.  The dough did spread when baking, my people looked very fat, but they tasted great.

I added 3 tablespoons of molasses for a more gingerbread taste.  Also the gingerbread "people" looked looked like bloated blobs, probably too much baking powder? On the plus side, they were very tasty! Either way I won't be making this recipe anymore.

I loved this recipe and although they are more spice biscuits than ginger, they were delicious.  After reading the reviews I added an extra half a cup of flour and the biscuits kept their shape beautifully.  This recipe will definitely be a favourite of mine and my family's

I love this recipe! I have used it many times and it always turns out great! I get complements every time I make these. The cookies most of the time do spread out too far after being baked, but you can just put designs with icing on them and they will look really nice.

This are good cookies, I liked them, but I found them a little bit spicier and sweeter than I would've liked. I tried to do boys and girls, and they spread out so much, you couldn't tell what they were once they were done. I will definetly try another recipe for the next time.

The cookies are soft enough to be edible, but firm enough to make good building material, about the texture of a good sugar cookie.  They are lightly spiced enough that even the people who don't like gingerbread usually even enjoy them, but still have that wondeful gingerbread bite.

This is the first time i've made gingerbread cookies, and these were fantastic.  I live in New Zealand, and used Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup or molasses (as one reviewer suggested).  I also didn't use ginger, as I was out.  I know, gingerbread cookies without ginger?  I added a bit more cinnamon and used nutmeg instead.  The cookies weren't at all spicy-hot (probably because of the lack of ginger), but they tasted wonderful!  Can't wait to make more.

These cookies were the closest thing that compared to my grandmother's recipe. The intensity of the ginger and cloves were perfect. Well done.

My kids loved this recipe. I wouldn't consider it true gingerbread, but they were delicious and the dough was very easy to work with when kept chilled.

The icing was a great consistency for piping as well.

The kids ate these faster than we could bake them.  I loved how easy it was to throw together and we even made some gingerbread houses with this recipe :)

Might want to cut back on the baking soda in this recipe.  Our gingerbread men swelled up so much their thighs grew together and they all looked like grimace from McD's.  They taste fabulous and I had several comments that this was THE best gingerbread cookie ever tasted.  If you are just making them for around the house, great recipe...If you are going for presentation they puff up WAY too much!
I also found this dough to be WAY difficult to roll out and work with.  This was my first time using gingerbread. I usually do sugar cookies.  This dough was so sticky and it took a lot of flour to get them rolled and cut.

These were good, however, I think next time I will add slightly more seasoning and a tiny bit more sugar (though not much). I ended up baking them for 6 minutes at 350 after a few burnt batches, but this may just be my old oven.

I tried out this recipe yesterday to try and make ~big~ cookies for my daughter's J.K. class. For me, the recipe turned out a fairly crumbly cookie that could not be made large (they all fell apart). Also, I found that the cookies were too pale in color and didn't look very "ginger-bready" at all. I tried another batch using some brown sugar instead of all white sugar and those looked and held together a bit better. Still, I could not make them any bigger than about 4 inches (which, of course, not many people would want to do anyway).  

Overall, I'd have to say that I do not like the taste or mouth-feel of these cookies very much, but I appreciate the fact that this is one of the only recipes I could find that did not include molasses. I don't think many kids are big fans of molasses. So, I think they would like these.

The kitchen smelled fantastic!   My dough turned out too runny, though.  We couldn't cut shapes out of it at all but dropped it by spoonfuls and ended up with some really great tasting gingerbread cookies.

This recipe was SO bland, maybe why kids liked it.  But even mine didn't care for it.  Also, the dough spread on the cookie sheets so much, that you couldn't tell what the shapes were!  I would not recommend this recipe.

As someone who doesn't generally like gingerbread cookies, I thought these were good. They do taste more like a spicy snickerdoodle than a gingerbread like another reviewer stated, also I found them to be more of a crisp cookie.  I will definitely make these again.

the flavour is good but the cookies sort of lost their shape and became blobby, also the icing was way too runny
