This was very good. The chicken was surprisingly tender and the artichoke hearts went well with the other ingredients. I'll definitely make it again.

I admit I couldn't bring myself to make a dish that already sounded so bland so I did add spinach (mainly because I had to get rid of some) and some red pepper and onions, since I also wanted to add some vegetables and my husband doesn't like mushrooms. After making those additions it was still just ok. I also added some spices to it (garlic and herb seasoning) since it only calls for salt and pepper. Not sure I'd make it again.

Edit: I made this a few days ago and although I rated it days later and then left my review I'm now having it for lunch  and with the addition of some feta cheese it is much better!
So while my original rating still stands because I had to add so much to it I think there is definitely room for improvement and I will try it again.

This was a tasty dinner tonight, though I thought it could have used some more seasoning (my husband did not).  I used chicken tenders that I cut in half and followed the recipe.  It could have used some herbal addition like tarragon or maybe even just some type of mustard to be added to the wine/broth mixture.  We did enjoy this meal!  Thanks, Josh!

Pretty bland.  Sauce tasted too much like artichoke juice/white wine.  Added garlic, shiitakes, salt, pepper and lots of shaved parmesan.

Keeping in mind that marinated artichokes are rather bland, I did add garlic and Italian seasonings to the chicken is it sautéed. My husband doesn’t like mushrooms so I didn’t add any. But I bet it would be fantastic. Next time I’ll make some on the side and add it to mine. In the end I added peas and I believe it out of not only color but some texture. And tasted great. I would definitely make this again. I’m curious to see if it’s going to be a cold pasta

I made this....but I added half a cup of heavy whipping cream and it took that artichoke flavor to another level for my family and I. I know that’s not the healthiest ingredient....but it tasted really amazing!!! Thanks for the recipe, I’ll definitely make it again;)

It was super plain even with all the extra stuff I added. This recipe needs to be overhauled. I added turmeric and dry mustard to the sauce, more salt and pepper,  onions, and garlic. The chicken needs a LOT more salt.

Made according to the recipe, except that I used chicken I had already baked previously.  The flavor was a bit more subtle than I typically like; I think I'll try it again and add a bit more seasoning

I appreciate that this recipe uses the artichokes AND the marinade. I always feel bad wasting the marinade in other recipes. 
I used chopped red pepper for added color. 
Try adding crumbled feta to leftovers for a twist.

I had real hopes for this dish as I enjoy all of the ingredients. Sadly neither my husband or I enjoyed this recipe.  It had no diversity to the flavors and with the wine and artichoke being the only ingredients to provide flavor it was quite sour.

This was just ok.  It seemed to be missing something for another layer of flavor.  But, it was a good light meal to have on a late evening.

This was very good.  Next time my husband and I make it we will try to add some seasoning.  We'll be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!
