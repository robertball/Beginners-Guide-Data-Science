I loved these mini tacos and so did my husband. He ate four of the fruit filled delights. A beautiful little bite of cinnamon and fruit. I used a flower shaped 3 inch metal cookie cutter since I didn't have a round cookie cutter. This recipe was an easy recipe to make and I would make these again.  Perhaps,  a cute dessert for a brunch, bridal shower or a tea party for my little granddaughter.

I use this recipe for the filling and fruit but use preformed Philo tarts I found in the freezer section of the grocery store. Delicious!!! A family favorite!

I made these with mango & strawberries and pineapple & strawberries instead of grapes. This was a clean the cupboard/fridge out stroke of  genius.

Great July 4th picnic dessert!  Iâ€™m not much of a deep fryer cook but this was really simple...15 min for the frying...15 minutes to assemble.

They are wonderful with just raspberries instead of strawberries and grapes too!  I can even share those with my dogs, who cant have the grapes.
