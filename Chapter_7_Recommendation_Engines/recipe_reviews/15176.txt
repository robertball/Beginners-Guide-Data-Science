I made this last night.  I came home tired and cranky and figured I'd just cook some noodles and open a jar of sauce.  I had my ground beef cooking away when I discovered that I was out of jarred sauce.  So, I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, but red wine worked great.  I also added about a cup of grated parmesan to thicken it a bit (I like my sauce to be very thick) and give it some extra flavor.  This was so much better than the junk in the jar that I'll definitely stop gettting the stuff in the jar and making this instead.

After reading the other reviews, I made the following changes: 1 TBS of vinegar instead of 2, plus I sauteed an onion with the garlic first, plus I added 2 tsp of basil.  And it was GREAT!  Today I made it for the second time, this time in the crockpot.  I put three (frozen) boneless skinless chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot, then added all the rest of the ingredients (with the changes I mentioned above).  I cooked it on LOW for 6 hours -- and when it was almost done, I opened the lid, and shredded the chicken with two forks.  It was sooo good!  My family (small kids, and husband) ate it over spaghetti, and I'll admit I ate it plain!

This is a very rich and thick sauce. So good and so easy to make. I sauteed a chopped onion in some olive oil and garlic first. Then I added the crushed tomatoes, one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and two 6 oz. cans of tomato paste.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt, 2 Tbsp. of sugar, 1/2 c. of dry red wine vs. vinegar, 1 Tbsp. each of oregano and basil vs. 1 tsp., 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper, and 2 bay leaves.  I let that simmer for 2 hours on low then removed the bay leaves and added 1/4 c. of shredded parmesan cheese, let that melt and then added some meatballs to let them heat through.

This sauce is delicious.  I made it because it seemed so easy, but the taste was wonderful.  Better than I ever thought.

This was rich and thick and turned out fabulous! I'd never have believed it just by reading the ingredients. This is very tomatoey tasting, a rich cooked flavor. Not spicy, but wow, very flavorful!  We all agreed this was a keeper. I loved the "not chunky" part. I cooked this about 3 hours and then simmered some meatballs in this the last hour and it was definitely 5 star worthy.

just made this recipe and found it to be very tasty with the following little changes. 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar instead of 2, sauted onion and garlic then added losts more dried minced garlic as it was cooking along with some Italian seasoning (just for my taste).

nice basic sauce. Sauteed some sweet/hot sausage, onion, fresh squash/zuccini, and extra garlic on side and threw in with sauce.  Also added more spices as it cooked. Plus kicked in more red pepper and a tad more sugar. I let it simmer for about 2-1/2 hours.  I also threw in some fresh parm. cheese towards the end. Would definitely use the basic sauce again, can modify to your taste and is simple to cook.

good basic marinara, quick, low in calories, fat-free.  I substituted canned diced tomatoes in their juice for the tomato sauce, and 1/2 cup red wine for the vinegar.  Simmer for at least half an hour to blend flavors.

Very easy and good with just these ingredients. I did add onions and Italian Sausage to the sauce. It was the perfect consistency not to thin and not too thick. The aroma is great and had everyone coming to the kitchen to see what was cooking.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I use it over pasta, Italian meatballs, chicken parmesan, lasagna, and pizza.  It's got the foundation of a classic sauce, and it doesn't need much of anything else.

Nice base sauce. I used brown sugar instead of white and I added some chopped veggies (fresh onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms) to beef it up a bit and a splash of red wine for flavor.

This was very quick and easy, and everyone enjoyed it.  I added some browned ground beef, but it was fine without it.

I have to say this is definately NOT the best sauce I've ever had.  My husband didn't like it either. Very disappointed of the outcome.

I loved this sauce!   I followed the recipe, though I did sub diced tomatoes for sauce for a little more texture.  I'm also lazy, so I threw everything in the crock pot for a few hours so I didn't have to pay attention to it on the stove top.  I added some shaker parm at the end, too.  Fantastic basic sauce that froze well and is easily adaptable for personal tastes.  This is currently my go to red sauce.  TY, Mel's Nanny, for a great recipe!

I have been wanting to make homemade sauce... so I decided to try this one because it seemed very easy. Well.... the only change I made was to sauté onion with my garlic and then add the remaining ingredients. I LOVE this sauce.... never will buy jar sauce again! Thank you! Yummy!

This is a great basic mari...very easy! Just make it like the recipe says, no need to saute anything. The key is to use good Italian crushed tomatoes, like San Marzano style.  My husband loved it too!  Said he could drink it straight!

I was a little hesitant about the vinegar, but added the 2 tablespoons with extra red pepper and garlic. I simmered it on the stove for 2 hours and refrigerated it over night. It was fantastic for dinner the following day! Definitely a quick and easy go to sauce especially with home made meatballs. Will definitely memorize this recipe

The sauce is wonderful, very rich and full of flavor. I used tomatoes in their juice instead of tomato sauce. Very easy to make and can be frozen ahead.

I will NEVER buy store bought sauce again.  This is THE BEST I've ever had hands down.  It does need a little extra love however.  I put in some salt, some garlic powder and a blended spice called pasta sprinkle from Penzy's spices.  It's even better when you freeze some of it and use if at a later date.  All the flavors have merried so well!!

Super yummy and easy to make...and it tastes better, I think, the next day!  Will probably make this vs buying store bought from now on.  Could easily add all sorts of meats/vegies if you wanted.

We really liked this sauce.  I cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low with meatballs and it turned out just right.  It is even better the next day.

Wow, a quick, easy and inexpensive alternative to jarred sauce!  In fact, I no longer buy the jarred stuff because this is so good and so easy.  I tend not to like the chunky sauces, so this is great.  Thank you.

This stuff is SO good! I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced, flavored with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. And since I cooked this all day in the slow cooker they broke down and I was able to smash them with a potato masher. Thus I ended up with a slighty chunky but not too chunky lovely thick sauce. I also added basil, used white vinegar in place of the red (that was all I had) and some onion powder. I can't wait to experiment with this! Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!

This sauce did not work out well for me at all.  It was incredibly bitter and tasted strong of vinegar.  I think using red wine would have been a better bet for me.  Skip or reduce the vinegar if you don't really care much for a vinegar after taste.

Nice sauce! I used 1 can sauce and 2 cans paste. I, too, sauteed onion and garlic. I may play around with the seasonings to make it perfect for me.

This is the perfect sauce. I plan on it being my only spaghetti sauce recipe for a while. The next time I made it, though, I do plan on adding onion to it. Husband and I were practically licking our plates after eating this.

This is a really good and easy recipe.  I didn't have any red wine, so I ommitted that.  Otherwise the recipe pretty much stayed as is.  I was serving with meatballs, and the tomatoes were a bit too chunky, so I gave the chunky pieces a quick run through the blender, which actually gave it the perfect texture!  Now the new sauce for our meatballs!

Really good & tomatoey! Easy. I love using crushed tomatoes. I used just a little less red wine vinegar because that's all I had left & I also used 2 T. sugar. Tomatoes in all forms are very healthy!

A simple, tasty recipe.  I used 5 fresh tomatoes instead of canned and, after simmering for 30 minutes, the consistency was perfect. Not too runny, not too thick.  Next time, I will try adding some ground meat.

Instead of throwing everything together to simmer, I sauteed the minced garlic and red pepper flakes, along with some minced onion, in olive oil. I cut the red wine vinegar in half and added 1/4 of a cup of red wine. Near the end of simmering, I added 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese and a bag of Gardenburger meatless meatballs. The result: a thick, savory sauce with meatballs.

I've known for a while that I prefer red wine vinegar to white wine in my marinara.  I specifically searched for a recipe like this.  The base recipe is great, but it's also good for personalization.  My favorite method includes the other reviewers' suggestions to sauté the onions and garlic in olive oil before adding the rest and adding basil in a ratio comparable to the oregano.  I like the amount of vinegar suggested in the recipe, but I add parsley and rosemary and simmer three to four hours. Highly recommended as is or as a base.

Great recipe that my whole family loved! I liked that there weren't any vegetables to chop up, which made getting the sauce on the stove very quick. I loved the richness and depth in flavor that the red wine vinegar gave the sauce. I did add some cooked ground turkey to the sauce before letting simmer for the half hour, but that was the only thing that I changed. The sauce would have been perfect even without the meat added though. All five in my family loved this so we will definitely be making this again. Thank you for your recipe, MELHARVEY!

Good with changes made.  Even more can be altered.  Make sure to look at the Cake Boss' and see about merging.  I like the use of crushed tomatoes versus whole.

Threw this together with what was left in the cupboard. Changes: used 1 14 oz. stewed tomato can, sauteed diced onions with garlic before adding tomatoes. Used about 2 tbsp. Italian seasoning and 1 or 2 tsp dried basil, and 1-1/2 tsp salt. (used 1 8 oz. can unsalted tomato sauce.) The red wine vinegar gave it a great taste. I simmered for about 1/2 hour and got a huge amount, enough leftover to use for a pizza base sauce. Will definitely make again in the crockpot along with chicken and no pasta! Yummy.....

I liked the recipe, however, i and my family thought it was too sweet (i only used one tbsp of sugar). My lasagna was too sweet. Next time I make this sauce I'll use less sugar.

This is the recipe that I have been looking for! I've tried so many sauce recipes that have used a lot of ingredients and then I found this recipe. So easy. So basic. So delicious. I don't change anything although I  sometimes cook meatballs in the sauce, which only makes it even better. When I have leftovers, I use it on homemade pizza or freeze it. The sauce does taste more wonderful when the flavors blend overnight. I have used this as my sauce for hot sausage sandwiches for a crowd (and get rave reviews), over eggplant parm. I haven't used another recipe since I found this one.

This is great as is.  I've also done it with sauteed onions, garlic, and mushrooms and replacing vinegar with red wine.  Both are fantastic.

This is my new favorite spaghetti sauce!  I've made it twice now; the first time I put it on chicken parmesan and it was fantastic!!  Made it again last night for spaghetti and it was really good, but we like it best on the chicken parm. It's a tangy, tomatoey sauce that I find so tasty!  Also love that it's so easy.

This was really good. I sauteed onions and garlic in butter, added 1lb of ground pork (beef would be great, too!), cooked til done, then added the rest of the ingredients as stated in the recipe. Yum!

I didn't think this tasted good at all. All I could taste was bitter tomatoes. I won't be making this again.

I made this as written, but after testing it, made several adjustments. I had to add several more tsp of sugar to cut the acidity, so if I made this again, I would leave out the vinegar. I also added quite a bit more oregano and added in basil. The amount of oregano that initially went in could not be detected at all.  I'm sure the flavor was probably very different when it was made with great grandmother's home grown and home canned tomatoe's, not to mention homegrown fresh herbs :D

I thought I might have finally found the perfect Marinara sauce.  I will continue my search.  I thought this was easy to make, but it was lacking in spice.  I didn't mind the vinegar I minded the sugar.  It was very sweet and a little to sweet for my taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this pretty much exactly as written and it was delicious!  I probably added a bit more garlic and my "pinch" of red pepper was 1/4 teaspoon.  It had a unique flavor with a slight kick.  Very good!  I don't know why some are suggesting using less vinegar.  I thought it was perfect.

Excellent! I followed the recipe to a "T" with a few additions. As another reviewer suggested, I sauted onion, green pepper and a few mushrooms in the pan before adding tomatoes. We found the sauce a little sweet and put a few cranks worth on the sea salt grinder and a dab of dried basil flakes. Overall, the right combination of sauce and paste made for a thicker, saucier texture and the flavors were magnificent! Definitely will do it again very soon!

This was an easy recipe to make...it smelled wonderful while it was cooking and the taste was great...I won't be buying the seasoning packages anymore. Instead of oregano I added Italian seasoning which tasted wonderful.

just made this today to serve with lasagna.Let it simmer all day in the crock pot.This was my first attempt at homemade sauce and it's pretty good.I used puree instead of canned tomatoes ( my family doesn't like chunky sauce) I think mext tine I'll sautee the garlic first and add some sausage for extra flavor, but I'll keep this as the basic recipe.Thanks!

Wow!  One of the best spaghetti sauces I have ever tried!  I did make a couple changes...  I browned one pound of ground beef with the garlic and added a little dried minced onion, dried basil, and a bay leaf.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!

This is a great base sauce recipe.  I took half of the sauce and added it to some sauted onion and squash and used the other half over some ground turkey for my boyfriend.  I'll be making this one again for sure!

I think this was a great "base" recipe. I ended up adding red wine, fresh basil,sauteed onions, and oregano. With those additions, it was a delicious, savory sauce and I plan to never buy jarred spaghetti sauce again!

I thought this was a good basic sauce.  I followed the instructions except for adding sauteed onion and mushrooms.  Definitely better than the jars of sauce, but maybe still missing something for me.   I am giving this three stars, because it didn't get any better sitting in the fridge.  Sauces usually get a bit better within the next few days and this one just didn't.  It separated and just sort of became gross.  I ended p throwing it away because I didn't want to eat it. :(

Good- added 5 cloves garlic, 1tbs basil and 1 tbs parsley. Also a dash of olive oil. Not amazing but good. I will probably use in dishes that require a sauce like chicken parm. but i doubt I would use this as a whole meal with pasta... it would need to have a little more oomph to stand alone.

Im usually not a fan of red sauce, more of a white sauce girl, but I needed a sauce for spaghetti and the stuff out of the jars at the grocery store are YUCK. This recipe is GOOD. I will eat it and enjoy it. Its not my favorite and I don't like to eat it often, but its good. The hubby liked it as well.

WONDERFUL!  This was spiced just right and I used it over (Vikki Rebholz) 3 cheese manicotti from this site with great success.  This sauce made that dish out of this world! I'm going to see both recipes show up on my regular rotation from here one.  Even the picky 6 year old loved it.

This is a fabulous sauce! I am officially done with spaghetti sauce in a jar. I added sauteed onion, green pepper and mushrooms and added my homemade meatballs. I simmered the sauce for about three hours and we've been eating it for three days and aren't tired of it yet!

Excellent!  I started out by cooking a chopped onion and the garlic in a little olive oil first, then adding the rest of the ingredients and cooked for about 3 hours.  I used a grated carrot instead of the sugar, and added some fresh basil and marjoram near the end of cooking.  Great homemade flavor!

For this recipe I sauteed a small amount of minced carrots, celery and onion in 2 tbls. of olive oil before adding the other ingredients to the pan.  This added even more flavor to an already good sauce.  I really liked how quick I could prepare this as well as having all the items on hand.

Very good, basic recipe.  I sauteed yellow onion and green pepper with fresh garlic first, then added the rest of the ingredients.  Mushrooms would have been good too.  I think this is a good recipe for adding whatever you like!  Oh, I also added lots of red pepper flakes (I like spicy sauce), basil, and black pepper.

Bland.  I added some red onion, a can of mushrooms and some basil.  Served over fettucine.  It just seemed too bland and kind of dull.  Not worth the effort.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  I didn't have any jar sauce on hand but had all the ingredients this recipe required (except the red pepper flakes, left them out).  This recipe is easy and delicious.  I added 1 lb. of ground beef and used extra garlic (6 cloves).  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used 1 Tbsp. balsalmic vinegar and it was still delicious!  Thank you for this recipe, I'll never use jarred sauce again!

My husband LOVED this sauce.  I liked it a lot but thought it was a little on the tangy side - maybe the red wine vinegar came through a little too much.  It was good and easy to make.  I used about 28 oz of fresh roma tomatoes - removed the seeds and chopped them up, heated them in the pan to get them soft and then used a potato masher to crush them before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This worked well.  I will definitely make this again, maybe a little less vinegar next time.

At the last moment, I realized I didn't have any store-bought spaghetti sauce!  OOPS!  I found the recipe - one of the few that I had all the ingredients for on hand and WOW!  What a great sauce!  I didn't have time to simmer it for the full 30 minutes, but it was so tasty.  Even my husband loved it.  After we ate, I made a second batch and put it on to simmer and then freeze.  Will be keeping this recipe!

Very quick & easy.  Both my daughter and husband enjoyed this sauce - which is rare because they usually complain that nothing quite compares to my husband's Nana's sauce, in their opinion.  It doesn't taste like her sauce, but they thought it was a good sauce anyway.  I didn't like this recipe as much, though.

:-) Interesting recipe! This sauce tastes stronger than my usual pasta sauce (probably due to the wine vinegar). I tried it once with scrambled tofu in it.

This recipe is a great versatile multi purpose marinara sauce. Any italian recipe that asks for prepared pasta sauce becomes soooo much better if you use this instead.  And if you make a big batch and freeze, it makes it a quick prep. When my garden plum tomatoes are ready i use this recipe to make canned sauce. Or if I freeze my tomatoes, I just use this recipe substituting my tomatoes for the canned ones.  It takes longer to cook than 30 minutes, but it is a labour of love. We had a party for about 20 people with fresh pasta, this sauce and parmesan cheese. It was a smash hit for everyone. I have used it ever since (it's been at least 12 years). Love All Recipes for keeping this on your site for so long.

This is pretty good but I had to add salt and pepper because everything was pretty bland.  I wonder why there's none listed in the recipe?  Salt and pepper is like a must in any recipe!

This was my first time making my own red pasta sauce. It was absolutely lovely. It tasted rich and traditional and the family seems entirely happy. I hope to use this recipe as a base for experiments in the future.

Good. Made a few changes. Added parm cheese, bay leaf, onion powder and shake of salt. Also added meatballs and pork. I sear the pork in olive oil and garlic prior to adding to the sauce. Sautéed the garlic in olive oil for 1 min with some onion powder b4 adding the sauce. Husband doesn't like onions.

This is my go to sauce now. I make three times the amount so I can freeze some. This is a great basic recipe that can be taken in any direction. I doubled the red pepper and garlic and still wasn't too hot or too much garlic in my opinion. I also added Italian seasoning and a pinch or so of sea salt. I would add a small onion if I didn't cook that already in with the meat.

This sauce is awesome!  I made it as written twice (with meatballs of course) and once I added some ground hot sausage (and skipped the red pepper flakes).  This is now my favorite sauce recipe.  Thanks!

I'm a new cook and this was easy to make. 

The recipe made a lot more sauce than I was expecting, but I simply reheat it and made more spaghetti a couple of days later.  

I took the liberty of cooking it with basil, then later adding sautéed mushrooms and onions. It went well with sweet Italian sausage and regular spaghetti noodles.

I made it exactly as written, though I only had time to simmer for a half hour. Next time, I will give it a bit longer so that the flavor can continue deepening. Other than that, I will not be changing a thing. It was wonderful!

I liked this sauce, however added some garlic powder, italian seasoning, onion powder.  I let mine cook for about an hour before serving.  Quick, easy sauce when you don't have time to let one simmer all day!

I wouldn't say this is the best sauce ever, but I did like it. It's fairly easy to make, and I made it exactly as written. It lasted me for several days, served on top of whole-wheat spaghetti. Not particularly worth recommending, but good enough.

Absolutely my favorite spaghetti sauce recipe now. Couldn't find my grandma's and looked for one online that was quick and chose this one. I used 3 1/2 large tomatoes and cut them up then mashed them with up, since I didn't have canned ones. I also didn't have the red wine vinegar so I omitted that completely. I had some left over turkey meatball meat that I browned separately then added to the sauce last minute. Simply wonderful! My 3 year old and 20 month old girls loved it too :) Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper!!

This is a great base sauce to start with and add ingredients that you like to personalize it. I added ground beef, mushrooms, celery and  red peppers. I also like to throw it into the crock pot, smells great cooking all day.

Great sauce, a touch sweet with the sugar. Next time going to make without sugar, tomatoes should sweeten it up enough. Added 1/2 yellow onion and cooked with sweet sausage. Excellent sauce.

Delicious, easy and super fast!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the vinegar to 1 TBL, added sauteed onion, diced green pepper and basil.  Will definitely be my go to recipe for spaghetti sauce!

This recipe is a good solid spaghetti sauce.  I omitted the oregano and subbed basil as I don't like oregano, otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I did cook it about an hour plus and it got better as it went.

I needed 2 jars of spaghetti sauce for a crockpot recipe and realized that I only had one, so I looked thru a bunch of marinara recipes until I found one that didn't call for any oil and this one was the first one I found. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar because I didn't have that ingredient. Other than that, I followed the directions and then added it to my crock of Italian meatballs and cheesy ravioli. I found a winner!!! This was thick and rich and very tasty. Everyone enjoyed it so much that I think I will make some of this sauce ahead and freeze it, then just pull it out of the freezer as needed. Good stuff.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe for Marinara Sauce/Spaghetti sauce.  I did not have puree, so I just added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce instead.  When I completed it and tasted it, I loved it.  Then I added a teaspoon of Schilling Italian Seasoning, and my mouth was watering at every bite!  What a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!  I cannot imagine ever again using store bought sauce!  DH said it was the best spaghetti sauce I'd ever made!  Thanks!

I made this, substituting red wine for red wine vinegar (oh, ok, and adding a little more than called for!).  I doubled the recipe and put it in my crockpot and cooked it on low for the afternoon.

It was delicious and SO EASY.  Next time I'm going to freeze my leftovers, instead of sending them home with guests.  No more jarred sauce.

Thank you MELHARVEY.

A friend gave me this recipe a couple of years ago and it's the only spaghetti sauce I use now.  I used to make my own out of a jar and did a little doctoring up but this sauce is FABULOUS!  All I do now is add meat and double the recipe!

Love it! This is my new favorite spaghetti sauce, its soo much better than canned. I have made this recipe probably 10 times now, everyone loves it. I didn't add oregano, and I didn't have fresh garlic so I just used garlic powder but it still turned out terrific. I think the red wine vinegar & sugar help to give this recipe its unique flavor. I added minced onions & salt to mine, & a little water because it was very thick. Give it a try, its so easy!

I was excited about this recipe because of the great reviews, but I found it very bland. It is, however, a good base recipe. I thought it tasted exactly like Pizza Hut's breadstick sauce. I will make it again, but I would probably omit the sugar and add salt and ground beef.

I love this recipe. I make this about twice a month. I've also used it in my lasagna. I cook italian sausage and mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. I haven't changed any of the original ingredients and find it perfectly tangy.

This sauce is one of the best I ever tasted by far. I consider myself to be an average cook and even I could make this. I would suggest some changes as some reviews have already - 1 tbs vinegar , 2 tsp basil, 2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp salt. I also sauteed the onion with garlic beforehand and it came out wonderful. Some reviewers suggest they would not make it again but fail to say why??? strange as it's suppose to be a review based on your results?. It's a recipe you can play about with and if you don't like too much garlic - then put less in !!!! and the same applies for the rest of the ingredients. As I said very easy to make and the smell wafting through the house makes you hungry. Well done thank you for posting this recipe. I am giving it five stars and ten if I could, just wonderful.

Wonderful - great last minute spaghetti sauce recipe -I will make again!  I was tempted to leave out the red pepper flakes since my 10 year old doesn't like anything spicy.  I added it anyway and he asked for seconds!

With a couple of changes, this is a 5-star recipe.  Instead of 2 cans of tomato sauce, I use 1 can of tomato sauce and one can of stewed tomatoes.  I also slow-cook it on low all day rather that stove-top cooking it.  That makes it fantastic.

This was wonderful and used pantry staples, which was great. I did saute an onion in evoo first and added garlic to that then everything else. The crushed tomatoes I had on hand were Italian style and I also added some dried basil. After tasting I added one more Tbsp of sugar. Thanks for sharing! With these changes, definitely a five-star and a keeper!

This was a good recipe, though next time I'm definitely going to cut back on the vinegar next time.  It was a little acidic for us.  I added some more seasoning because it was a bit bland (well... a bit tomatoey) and it needed some kick.  This was so good and it made a lot.. much more economical than that jarred stuff.  I didn't think it was really all hat thick, so I added some parmesan toward the end.  I may just get the bigger can of paste next time or cut one tomato sauce can out.  We'll definitely be keeping this one.

This has become our new family spaghetti sauce. No more sauce from the bottle for us! It is so easy and so tasty. First time we made it we followed the recipe, after that we made substitutions and changes. My kids didn't like the red pepper flakes so we leave that out now. Sometimes we make it as a meat sauce sometimes we load it up with veggies. Sometimes we thin it out with a little water and use for making overnight lasagana. This one is great!

I have always wanted to try and make my own spaghetti sauce and this was very good. I used 1 clove of garlic instead of 3 and used a bit much crushed red pepper. I will be making this again.

Fixed this last night and it was delicious.  I combined it with GIGI9801's Italian Sausage, Peppers and Onions. Very easy to make and much better than bottled sauce.  Even the grandkids loved it.

Wow!  I have been looking for a rich, flavorful red sauce for a number of years, and today, I found it!  This sauce has the perfect balance (for my taste) of sweetness and acidity, and while it will serve as a great base sauce for other ingredients (I can see onions, green peppers, mushrooms added), I like it just the way it is in the posted recipe.  The only change that I made today was the substitution of basil for the oregano.  I finally found my "house" red sauce!  Thank you so much for sharing.

The quality of this sauce will depend on what products you use to make it.  I recommend organic tomato products.  You won't go wrong with Bionature, or Muir Glen.

Thanks so much for sharing!  I love it!  It was even great after simmering just 5 minutes.  Yum and simple.  This will be my everyday sauce from now on.  Goodbye Ragu! (Oh, 1 change:  didn't have red wine vinegar, so i used apple cider vinegar.)

Used recipe to can about 3 lbs of fresh tomatoes. Added 1/2 cans of spaghetti sauce to make 2 quarts. Red wine vinegar left a tang to the sauce.

My daughters really liked it, but my husband thought it was too sweet and would have liked more spice. I thought it was fine - not my favourite - would maybe have liked more depth of flavour than you can get in a sauce that is cooked so quickly. Thanks!

Delicious!  I am a fan of bolognese sauce but am trying to cut down on saturated fat so tried this and I hardly missed the meat - rich taste without being rich and fatty.  Excellent.

In this economy, this couldn't have been more simple and economical.  Very tasty and the crushed red pepper added a bit of zazz. That said, I did add 1/2 onion, chopped and a bit of basil and a bay leaf as it sat on the stove for a few hours on low. But it is just fine with out it. Thanks!

this is a really good recipe. my husband is really picky when it comes to spaghetti sauce and i was suprised when he actually liked it. i used fresh tomato's instead of crushed and i didnt use any of the red wine vinegar. i also added a teaspoon of dried parsley. it was a little on the sweet side it could've used a little something but im not sure what. if anyone has any suggestions could you let me know. thanks.

Easy and tastes great. I quadrupled the red pepper flakes becuase I like the heat. I added 1 lb of sweet pork sausage (out of the skins). I didn't have any red wine vineagar so I used white and it worked well.

I thought this sauce was ok.  However, I thought there was way too much oregano and would be better with some basil and parsley.

Perfect! So quick and easy and you can build upon it very easily if you wanted to add meats or veggies to it. I followed the recipe to a T and only added in Basil.. Will make this again and again!

Very good recipe. Tastes quite good as is, but can also be modified to suit your tastes. My family likes meat sauce, so I add hamburger. Really yummy!

This was my first time ever making homemade spaghetti sauce. I thought it was a bit bland. I did not have red sauce so I substituted diced tomatoes. Everything else was as directed. I will try other recipes before coming back to this. But thank you anyways.

Sauce was super easy and tasty!  Will use this from now on when I'm in a crunch and don't have time to make my 3+ hour normal sauce.  It's a little sweet as is, so next time I might try to offset that by adding some spicy sausage or something.  Thanks for this great easy sauce!

So very easy and so very delicious. I substituted 2-14oz cans of diced tomatoes for the crushed and it worked out just fine. I prefer a chunkier sauce anyway.:) To that end, I also added some chopped onions. Absolutely yummy!

I made a huge batch and froze 4 cups per freezer bag.  It was a nice sauce, a little on the sweet side. Similar to a popular brand without all the preservatives.

This is a great base for an excellent sauce.  I used as is and it was a hit.  Letting this simmer longer and adding your favorite vegies and meats would take it to a whole new level.

My family did not care much for this. The spices were good but I think we prefer a smoother sauce. I never made a sauce with tomato pieces in it. So I think it was the tomatoe chunks.

I had to add a whole lot more spices to get this to our level of 'good', thus the **.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.  An OK base recipe, but most people are going to require more spices.

I used some home-canned tomatoes that my mother-in-law gave me, and I added some olive oil & about 1/2 of a chopped onion. The taste is wonderful and it couldn't be easier! I'll definitely use it again!

I was looking for an easy and versatile spaghetti sauce. This was it! The first time I followed the recipe: excellent.  The second time I added some basil, pepper, sauteed onions, sundried tomato paste, and sweet italian sausage.  There's never any leftovers now when I make pasta or lasagna. Thanks for the recipe!

This sauce was great.  It had wonderful flavor.  I let it simmer on low for about 3 hours in a stock pot.  This definitley brough out all the flavors!

A very nice tasting Sauce. I doubled it then I tweaked it a little to my Family's liking. I used 1/2 for lasagne and froze the other 1/2 for later.

I didn't think there was anything spectacular about this sauce, I thought it was a bit bitter tasting actually. It was quick and easy to make, but I don't think I'd make it again for the simple fact that no one in my family enjoyed it that much.

quick, easy, and even my two year old liked it.  This means a lot since I really am not a good cook and he usually ends up eating a toddler meal out of a can.

It was quick, and easy, and really good tasting.  Much more than I was expecting from the simple list of ingredients..
