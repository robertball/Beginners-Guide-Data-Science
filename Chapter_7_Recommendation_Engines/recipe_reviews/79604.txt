Very easy, delicious, and pretty too - you can be really creative with the presentation. The recipe makes WAY too much dressing though. I halve it, and there is still more than enough for 4 servings. Prior to preparation, make sure you let the tomatoes and avocado come to room temperature - the first time I made it, they were too cold, and the salad lacked flavor.

This was good and certainly easy.  I think next time I'd use less balsamic vinegar - maybe half balsamic, half regular or red wine vinegar.  It was just too strong in the balsamic category.

Really great salad. Way too much dressing, however... I scaled it in half and still had entirely too much. I will try quartering the dressing next time. I also added some very thinly sliced red onions. We were waiting on friends to go out to dinner but we were so hungry that I whipped this up to tide us over. It worked! Super quick to make, too.

This is very good. Have recently discovered that we like avocados, and this is a nice way to have them. The dressing is very good--sweet.

I've used this recipe, as written, so many times.  We love it! I chop the tomatoes and avocados, toss gently, then drizzle the dressing just prior to serving. Definitely company worthy. Thank you Aussiebear!!

Really good and fresh.  Added 1/4 tsp minced garlic a little Lawry's seasoning salt and a splash of Champagne vinegar.  Will definitely make again.

This was a perfect way to use up extra avocados, the only thing I added was a few capers as a salty addition.  Yummy!

This salad looks and tastes very good. My husband, who isn't fond of avocados, was very pleased with the flavor of this salad. I agree with the other reviewers that there is too much dressing. I'm going to use extras for my other salads.

I agree - far too much dressing.  I halved it and still have some leftover.  But that's OK - it's fantastic!!  I used cherry tomatoes and halved little black tomatoes, cut up the avocado and added some crumbled low fat feta.  Excellent!!

I liked this appetizer a lot and I loved the dressing, BUT...after reading one review I did 1/2 balsamic vinegar and 1/2 red vinegar and it was very delicious.

Exceptional. Also halved the dressing and used 2 avocado and cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and still had a ton of leftover dressing...but it was AMAZING. It'd be fantastic to have dipped in some Italian bread. My husband had a grilled cheese sandwich and dipped it in and said it was great. This is a keeper recipe! Thank you!! :D

The dressing really compliments the flavor of the avocado and tomato.  But the amount is WAY too much, especially for just drizzling.  Also thought the balsamic vinegar was too strong in the dressing.  I'll make this again with some decreased ingredient amounts.  (Obviously, my salad presentation wasn't in the wagon-wheel configuration specified.  I just fanned the avocados and scattered the tomato slices on top.)

Since some reviewers said there was an overwhelming balsamic taste - and also because most vinagrettes have three parts oil to one part vinegar - I started by just mixing in half of the balsamic vinegar. That is how I left it because it was so good, way better than any store bought vinagrette and it couldn't be easier! I quartered the dressing for my half of an avocado and still had enough leftover to top a small salad. It was such good dressing however that if you eat salad, you may as well  make the full amount just to have extra on hand.

This was great with a few changes.  I added a thinly sliced onion.  I did not have dijon mustard, so I added 1/2 tsp of ground mustard and 2 TBSP of white wine.  I let it sit for about 30 minutes.  It is definitely a keeper!

I made this twice. Way too much dressing and I even had three avocados and several small tomatoes and only added half the dressing. I liked it. I feel the balsamic vinegar discolors the avocados too much. They actually look brown. I used white balsamic the first time and it wasn't bad and then used the dark balsamic which really discolored them. I guess I would make it again but would use much less dressing and maybe try red wine vinegar.

Great simple, flavorful salad. I prepared the tomatoes and avocado slices as indicated, however I just used some balsamic vinaigrette (Newman's Own). The dressing was a little runny (as opposed to the homemade version, I'm sure) but it still tasted great! I added some feta cheese and some salt and pepper to taste! Fantastic idea and great presentation of the salad. I will definitely use this again!

Tasted OK but a little strong in the vinegar taste.  My husband liked it better than me.  Not sure if I will repeat or not.

Just not very good ... the flavors didn't meld together as I hoped they would and it just tasted odd.

This dressing is the best balsamic dressing i have ever had, the salad just needs red onion and it would be perfect.

Yum!  But way too much dressing for the amount of avocado & tomatoes. I used only 1/4 c balsamic vinegar, 1 TBSP olive oil and 1 tsp dijon vinegar. Lots of freshly ground pepper as well.

This was very good. I chopped the tomato and avocado and tossed them with the dressing and some spring mix to make a nice salad. I made half the dressing and used about half of that. I added salt and more pepper to the dressing, and after tasting it I doubled the mustard. Served with a raw corn chowder, this made for a delicious  quick and easy dinner after a long day's work.

This was perfect. I used the extra dressing on other salads. This was very simple healthy salad without any artificial sugar added. I am going to make this again and again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some avocados and found this.  I ended up being out of tomatoes but thought, what the heck, it is only me eating so I decided to go ahead and just use avocado.  This recipe is absolutely great!  I didn't miss the tomatoes but if I were making it for company I would use them.  I will be making this again and often.  Thank you for the great recipe!

The Dijon was a great part. I only added some shaved sweet onion piled in the center of the dish. My wife and loved it. Oh yea, I too halved the sauce and still had plenty.

This was good. I love avocado, and I love tomato, and the dressing compliments them well. However, it wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped. Also, I doubled the amount of avocado and tomato and kept the amount of dressing the same. Still way too much dressing.

Easy, tasty, refreshing, & nice presentation. I didn't change anything and agree with some other posts: There's a bit too much of a balsamic vinegar in the dressing. (That's why I rated the recipe as 4 stars instead of 5.) Use a third to half less than directed. For nutrition's and presentation's sake, I served this on a bed of romaine. The recipe makes enough vinaigrette to dress the lettuce, too. We served this as a side/appetizer to a chicken enchilada casserole (found in Family Circle, not on this website - fantastic, btw!), and it was the perfect compliment to the heavy, spicy main dish. But I could see making this the main course at a lunch as well, an easy pack-n-go for work. Definitely worth a try: It will quickly become a go-to salad.

This is a good combo of flavors, but I definitely agree there is way too much dressing.  I halved the dressing and there was still too much!  I thought I'd be okay mixing it in a measuring cup so I'd be able to pour it easily and thus be able to limit the amount, but that didn't work so well for me.  I accidently saturated my plate.  I'll drizzle with a spoon next time and next time make 1/4 of the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe for dinner or an appetizer. I added 1 clove of minced garlic, and then topped with crumbled feta cheese. Do not refrigerate tomato or avocado, best if they are at room temperature. Dressing can be chilled. I am very lucky to live in So. Cal and am able to get fresh hass avocado's and tomato's from the local farmer's market for this recipe.

What a simple, healthy and delicious lunch this was. To get the most flavor, never put your tomatoes in the frig., or your avocados for that matter. I salted my tomatoes lightly after slicing and I halved the dressing. I still had extra dressing but it will be wonderful on a salad today so I saved it. Thanks for the recipe!

I honestly didn't care for the dressing, because I thought it was to much vinegar. My husband hates all vinegar, and he tried it but didn't like it.  I loved the combo of the veggies, however, and I'll make this again, maybe next time using olive oil or garlic oil.

Thank you very much for such a great way to serve avocado. Four and a half stars for this. I cut the avocado in half and placed it, cut side up, in the middle of the circle of tomato slices, drizzled Kraft Zesty Italian dressing lightly over all and ground fresh black pepper over all to taste. My husband doesn't care for avocado; however, he liked this combination very much. I served with both a fork and spoon.

I thought this would be great because I love avocados and had some delicious heirloom tomatoes from our garden.  Unfortunately it was just so-so.  I think the dish needed something with a different texture to balance the soft items.

Pretty tasty. I took reviewers' advice- halved dressing & used some red wine vinegar in place of some of the balsamic. It was still too much dressing. I also cut up the tomatoes (used 3 Romas) & avocado & put them in a bowl with the dressing. Next time I will reduce dressing even further! Thanks for the healthy recipe.

Extremely easy and very tasty. Like many others have said, cut the dressing in half and it will be plenty. I will make this again, but will cut down on the balsamic slightly.

This salad was very easy and fast but the dressing is off. I was on the fence between 3 & 4 stars because of the dressing. The vinegar to oil ratio is off especially if you use a good quality balsamic. I recommend using 1/2 c olive oil, 2 teaspoon good quality balsamic, 1 tablespoon Dijon, 1 clove garlic & salt/pepper to taste.

I decided to depart from the precise recipe, adding a bed of baby spinach. With the tomatoes and avocado added sliced red bell pepper, seedless cucumber, celery, and sliced boiled egg. Made a very tasty green salad better with the wonderful balsamic dressing.

Awesome salad! I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I switch it w/ red wine vinegar and only 3 tablespoons. Added Italian seasoning , kosher salt  and Cajun seasoning for a bit of kick.

Perfect lunch for me and my husband. I changed it to two servings. I put two lettuce leaves under the salad. Beautiful presentation. Have made twice and will do again.

Thanks for the recipe.  I used yellow mustard and three large roma tomatoes.  The recipe calls for what I feel is way too much dressing.  I used 1 tbs oil and 3 tbs vinegar and it was perfect.

I'm a big fan of balsamic vinegar so this was for me.  Only changes we made were to add a dash of salt, a bit of sliced white onion and sliced cucumber.  Quick "salad" with healthy, yummy ingredients.  Definitely will be using this recipe often.

Excellent salad, especially when the tomatoes are super ripe!  Loved the dressing for this salad, too.  I followed my good friend, Linda McLean's, suggestion and added fresh basil to the dish too.  Great idea!
