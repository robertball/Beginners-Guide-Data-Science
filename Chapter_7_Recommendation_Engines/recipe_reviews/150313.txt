I made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe had stated.  The second time I made some alterations with much better outcomes.  The original recipe will yield a watery conconction, so I cooked the sweet rice in my rice cooker with coconut milk instead of water.  Also there's no need to add that much sugar, but adjust to your taste.

This was DELICIOUS! Exactly as I remember it from Thai restaurants. I didn't have tapioca starch, so I also used corn starch and noticed no change in flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe - sticky rice and mango is one of my favorite desserts yet I had never tried making it myself. As another reviewer mentioned, though, the rice should be steamed in a bamboo basket to be truly authentic. Cooking the rice by boiling it or with a rice cooker will make it mushy and with a different consistency than intended for this recipe. Use Thai glutinous rice (different from rice that may simply be labeled "sticky rice"), which you can buy at most Asian grocery stores - soak it in water for a few hours or overnight, then steam in a bamboo basket (you can also purchase these in specialty stores or online - I got mine on Amazon.com). The rice will be sticky and chewy, but not mushy, meaning that the grains will hold their shape. Hope that helps!

Sticky rice is generally made with, well, sticky rice aka glutenous rice; but, this recipe is a great solution if you do not have sticky rice in your area, or don't have time to go to the Asian grocer. The flavor was on target. 

A few notes/changes:
1. If you're using sticky rice, omit the starch. You also probably skimp a tad on cooling time.
2. If you're using another rice (long grain, basmati), the flavor will still be good, but the rice mixture won't be as firm/sticky. Put the starch into the batch of coconut milk mixture in which you are steeping the rice in for an hour--this helps thicken it all. Cool for at LEAST an hour (keep covered), but you can leave it longer to get a little firmer. 
3. Skip the starch in the last bit of coconut milk mixture that you will pour over the top of the rice and fruit at the end.
4. Corn starch can be used in lieu of tapioca at a 1:1 ratio. It takes a little higher temp to start thickening, but the boil seems to take care of that. 
5. Use real coconut milk, not the "light."
Also:
6. The ingred. measures are disjointed. I.e. you need 2 cups of coconut milk (1 can)--use 1.5 cups in the first mixture, .5 in topping. So read it through to be sure you have enough of everything.
7. This makes a LOT  of rice. If your mangoes aren't huge, you can probably reduce the rice a bit. We had almost a third of the rice leftover.
8. This version is very sweet, good for tart mangoes, but if yours are sweet or you like less sweet, reduce sugar by a 1/4.

This recipe is very good but to be more authentic you should use glutenous/sticky rice instead of the long grain rice in the recipe.  Sticky rice is a type of rice, not a style of preperation.  Authentic sticky rice is easy and fast to steam and gives this dish a chewy texture.  Next time I make it I will cut the sugar just by a little bit.  I am a fan of sweet desserts but this is a bit too much.  The sauce is not needed in my opinion.  (Besides, without the sauce you can use just one can of coconut milk without wasting part of another.)

I made this with some modifications after reading other reviews.  I made the rice in my rice cooker adding the rice plus two cups coconut milk, one cup water, and 1/2 cup sugar.  It turned out perfectly, not too sweet like others had mentioned.  I highly recommend trying it with these changes.

This tasted GREAT! It was just as expected from the first time I had it two weeks ago. I would REALLY recommend to reduce the sugar level. I found it a bit too sweet, but it still tasted great. 

TIP: Stir your coconut milk while you let it boil or it will erupt like a volcano.

I thought I had coconut milk in the cupboard, but when I reached for it I noticed that it was Cream of Coconut, which is usually used for pina coladas and other smooth drinks. The cream is really sweet and thick on its own. I had already made the rice, so I poured half the can onto the cooked rice (enough to make it moist, but not drown the rice). I didn't add anything else--just cooked rice and cream. I'm a little worried now that this is all they do at my favorite Thai place, because it was almost as good as theirs.  Sorry this review doesn't relate directly to the recipe, but I thought it might be helpful to know that in a pinch you can get this dish with only two ingredients (technically three, since I used a little salt to cook the rice/or four if you slice a mango too).

Everyone is right.  This is the best sweet sticky rice recipe that I have found so far.  Although I did not have any mangoes at hand, I used chilled pineapples as an alternative, and I also added crushed peanuts as well.  Turned out to be an amazing and refreshing dessert.

I added 1 tbsp of the black sticky rice as well.  The color turn out great!  Don't use too much of the sesame seed, because the taste will take over!!!

Good but when I make it again, I will try reducing the sugar by about 1/4 of a cup.  The family indicated that it was a bit too sweet.

This is a great recipe!  I've made it twice, both times following a previous reviewer's advice to cook the rice in my rice cooker.  (I add 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and about 3/4 cup of water to 1 1/2 cups of rice in the cooker.)  In a separate pot, I combine the sugar and some water to make a syrup that I pour over the rice when it's done cooking.  This makes it perfectly sticky and sweet.  BTW, 1 Tbsp of tapioca starch was waaay too much the first time I made this recipe, the second time around I just added it little at a time until the consistency seemed right.  But overall, this is a delicious recipe that I will definitely make again!

Delicious--I couldn't stop eating it! I ended up making it without the sauce and serving it warm because I didn't have time to let it cool, but it was wonderful. Next time I think I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup because it left a really sweet aftertaste. I think I will also take another reviewer's suggestion of serving it with ice cream...

OMGosh... this is the best... just like when I was in Thailand! LOVED IT!!! The only difference was the rice from Thailand was steamed in a bamboo basket... but that would be more work.

This was delicious!  I used sweet rice (found at an Asian grocery tore) as per other recipes found online, rinsed it (by repeatedly adding water to rice in a container, swishing it around with fingers, then draining), and soaked for more than 6 hours.  The rice was amazing with this recipe and really made the dish!  Also, instead of using tapioca starch, I reduced the sauce by boiling to thicken it. Yum!

This was good.  Don't be tempted to pour the whole can of coconut milk just use the amt called for or it comes out runny. I didn't have tapioca starch so left it out.  I don't think it suffered any.  Also next time I'll add a little more rice bec some of the rice stuck to the bottom of the sauce pan.  The sauce was not needed.  Update: I found an easy Microwavable version.  Rinse 2 cups of sweet rice in cold water a few times or until water is almost clear then add more water until 1 inch above the rice level or more.  Let sit in water 30 mins .  Pour out excess water until there is only about 1/4 inch water above the rice level.  cover and microwave 10 mins.  Now Mix 1/2 can coconut milk, 1 cup sugar and small dash salt.  Add this to the rice mixture but only add as much as you need.  I left out 1/3 cup of the coconut mixture.  Let rice sit for 20 minutes.  Rice is done. Serve with mango.

This is simply THE BEST I have tasted, even better than the restaurant.  Made EXACTLY as stated in recipe- although I subbed tapioca starch with corn starch, worked fine.  Make sure to cool rice with coconut sauce in the refrigerator.  This cools each them down sufficiently and allows the rice to soak up the extra moisture.  Make the second sauce right before serving as this sauce thickens rapidly and tastes better when warm.  My kids LOVED this and called it a kind of natural way to make rice krispies!  You will be amazed!!!

This was really great, everybody loved it.  The only change I made was to use cornflour because I didn't have any tapioca starch and I let everybody choose their own fruit to put on top.  A good recipe for coconut sticky rice

OMGoodness....SO good!  I have been looking for a recipe that matches this dish that we always get in the Thai restaurants, and this is it!!  I used Jasmine rice and cornstarch instead of tapioca starch, and followed the directions exactly as written.   The whole family loved this!  Thanks!

Great recipe for sticky rice with mango! I used calrose rice and that worked out really well (This rice can be found in any grocery store). I cut the sugar by half and that was sweet enough for everyone. Also I prefer to serve the sticky rice warm with mango, not room temperature but that is just my personal preference. This recipe is really easy and authentic!

This tasted just like sticky rice I east with mango or custard at my favorite thai restaurant.  After cooking the rice, I followed the directions and soaked it in the sauce. It was amazing! I did not make the topping. It was not needed.  (I also used REAL sticky rice and steamed it on a splatter guard over a pan with an inverted metal bowl over it. Perfect.  I also split the sauce into 3 servings and refrigerated it and cooked 1/2 cup of rice 3 nights in a row. Mmm.

This was delicious! I only had 1 can of coconut milk, so I skipped the sauce and I thought it was great anyway.  I also added a pinch of ground cardamom to the finished rice before topping with mango slices and toasted sesame seeds.  I thought it helped balance the sweetness and added an interesting little twist.  Plus I need to find more ways to use the cardamom.  It's one of those spices you almost never use, then when you get a recipe that calls for it, you forget you have it and buy another bottle.  I have 3 almost full ones in my spice cabinet.

I like this recipe but i did make some alterations. I used Jasmine rice. I love Jasmine rice...lol. follow the preperation instruction for the jasmine rice not this recipe! Then cut about 1/4 out of the coconut milk sugar mix. (It will be soup if you don't cut it back) The coconut milk, tapioca starch mix is perferct don't alter it. I give this recipe 4 Stars because I changed it. But, what it was after those changes was a 5 star recipe for sure... I hope this comment is helpful to others!

I guess I just don't like this kind of thai sweet sticky rice b/c I couldn't eat this.  I ate one or two bites - I think it's just the sweetness of the rice that I didn't like - the smell and taste reminded me of baby formula.  

I think this was a simple matter of taste though, not necessarily that the recipe was bad... Still decided to review as it actually tasted to me though.

I LOVE Tai sticky rice & I have been searching for a recipe for awhile. This is not exactly like it, but very similar. It is much sweeter, but still very good. I did not make the sauce to go over the rice or add the mangoes. I use the rice with stirfry and other dishes and add a little shredded coconut. Delish!! My only advice--Watch when cooking coconut milk, sugar and salt on stovetop. It boils over VERY easily.

Tastes EXACTLY like the mango sweet rice at my favorite local Thai restaurant.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe.  Easy & spot-on, no changes needed.

Coconutty goodness!! I did half the sugar(as usual). Used the whole can of coconut milk with 2 cups basmati rice, so didn't make the sauce, but used some agave over top for husband who likes everything sweeter.

Super easy and exactly what I remember!  I've done the recipe above but also was lazy and used the rice cooker recipe below

OPTIONAL RICE COOKER RECIPE:
1 ½ C STICKY RICE
1 CUP WATER
1 CUP SUGAR
1 13.5 OZ CAN COCONUT MILK
½ TSP SALT

COMBINE TOGETHER AND STIR WELL AND COOK
IF THE RICE IS NOT FULLY COOKED ON ONE CYCLE, STIR AND COOK AGAIN.  
CHECK EVERY 5-7 MINUTES & STIR- WHEN THE MIDDLE IS NOT CRUNCHY, IT IS DONE. Take the lid off the rice cooker. Note: the rice will continue to cook 
LET IT REST 20 MINS AND ENJOY
THE SAUCE IS OPTIONAL --JUST FOLLOW THE SAUCE PORTION OF THE RECIPE

We had our friends over for a Thai feast. We all flipped over this sticky rice recipe! I followed the recipe nearly to a "T". I added 1 tsp ground cardamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. My mangoes were large so I only needed two. Double yums!

Just as good as my favorite Thai Restaurant! I did reduce the sugar, and I didn't see any point in making the sauce. It was awesome with fresh mango and super easy!

I made as directed, but I only used about 3/4 of a cup of sugar. I can imagine with the full cup it would have been way too spicy. You definitely want a lot of mango as the rice is good without it, but AMAZING with it. It also makes it a healthier choice to have more mango and less rice!  I did not make the sauce for the top and left out the sesame seeds. BTW, 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk is the same as one (almost 14 oz.) can. Just made it with medium grain rice too and it was "sticky" enough. Recommend!!!

Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  However, the tapioca starch didn't work for us.  We made it twice, and twice it instantly became a ball of rubber.  A friend of mine said to just use one teaspoon, not tablespoon.  However, I don't think the sauce is even needed.  The reciep was great without it, esp. when served warm.  Wow!  Many thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was great! I used 2 cups of rice and 2.5 cups of water in my rice cooker, so the rice wasn't as sweet as some people are saying... I also used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white and it was perfect. I almost always sneak brown sugar in my recipes somewhere :) and I had to use corn starch in my sauce and it was still great! This recipe is a winner :)

This turned out pretty well...changed a couple of things though...First, I diluted the coconut milk in half with water and cooked the rice in the coconut milk dilution. I did not add additional sweetened milk to the rice after cooking, but I did pour a little on top like a sauce. Came out a bit on the dry side so next time I might add a little sweetened milk after cooking too.

WAY too sweet. I love mango sticky rice but with this recipe all I can taste is the sugar! Even my 15 year old son wouldn't eat more than a few bites. Cut the sugar back to a couple tablespoons and this recipe could only benefit.

Super easy recipe and the results turned out great!  Tasted just like what you'd get at your favorite Thai restaurant!  The only changes I made is I used sweet rice that I got from an asain store and I sped up the cooling time by putting the rice in the fridge for a 1/2 hour instead of letting it cool at room temp for an hour.  I couldn't wait that long! :)

To make this more authentic you need to prepare "stick rice" or glutinous rice which is available at most Asian food stores. You need to soak this rice overnight, then steam it for 30 minutes(don't boil). Try it out, there is no turning back and you'll feel like you are eating in a little dump on Khao San Road. :)

I've made this recipe twice. Both times it was great! The first time I used the recommended amount of sugar and the second time I used a 1/4 cup less. I liked it a little better the second time, using less sugar. I will say that when I tried the rice by itself it seemed too sweet and had a syrupy after taste, but once I combined it with the fruit, it tasted fine. Both times I skipped the last part of the recipe--making the extra sauce to put over top of the sticky rice. I just followed the first part of the recipe and then combined the sauce with the rice and then added the mango on top. It was great! Also, one of the times I used strawberries and mango with the sticky rice. This was great too. With the rice so sweet, I think this rice would work great with various fruits, especially fruits that might not be as sweet. Maybe raspberries would be good too.

I really think 1 cup of sugar is far too much in this recipe.  3/4 cup did well.  Next time I will even try a bit less in hope of reducing the sugar down as low as it needs to be for a balance of good flavor.

I reduced the sugar in this - probably to 1/3 cup and also ended up needing to cook the rice a bit longer than expected (maybe 30 minutes?). It turned out excellent, though. Thanks!

Really good! This was my first time attempting making sweet sticky rice. I used sweet brown rice because it was all I had on hand (it's healthier anyway) and therefore the cooking time was lengthened. I used agave nectar in place of the sugar and halved the amount, although next time I will use less. Instead of tapioca starch I used Ener-G egg replacer (basically potato and tapioca startch). After adding the coconut milk mixture to the rice I heated it for about 20 minutes to thicken it up instead of taking it off the heat.

The only difference between this recipe and the one at my favorite thai restaurant is the sesame seeds.  So I left them out.  OMG!!!  This is sooooo good.  I am so excited that I can make this at home.  Thank you so much Michelle.

Very good receipe.  I made it with sticky rice and it turned out great.  I followed two other reviews on this panel that said it turned out too sweet.  When I reduced my sugar, it didn't taste sweet enough, so I would recommend following the amount of sugar written in the recipe.  Also, don't make the sauce in advance (oops!) because it gets all clumpy if you let it set.  Overall very good -just like the dessert served at Green Papaya.

I omitted the sauce and used this to make sweet sticky rice balls for my husband to take to work with him. He loved them! Next time I might roll them in a little coconut or sesame seeds.

So good, and easy! Made this while I hosted a student from Thailand.  With the exception of the mango being a little under ripe, it was delicious! :-)

Very good. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and made mine in the rice cooker. I combined 1 1/2 cups sushi rice, 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, 3/4 cup water, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 cup sugar in the rice cooker. Let it cook until it was done (it beeps when it's done). I could just eat the rice alone, it is so good! Made the sauce with the remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and used corn starch instead as I had that on hand. Very good!!! It was so easy to make!!

I'm not much of a cook, but I pulled this off.  Might reduce the sugar by 1/3 or 1/2 next time.  But it was really good and easy to make for a novice.  You can find youtube videos to show you how to peel a mango.

Loved this recipe. Tried it out with traditional white rice as I didn't have any sticky rice. As expected, the rice did not stick together, but the mangos and sauce were delish! I'm planning on purchasing some sticky rice next time I make the dish.

Am still cooking this. Used the purple sticky rice that I found here, which is what was used in my Thai cooking class IN Thailand.  Bamboo basket is definitely a better way, but you can also steam in a heat resistant bowl in a larger pot.  Only difference I would do was, yeah, add less sugar as others have said, and toast the sesame seeds!  They are so fabulous that way! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was okay, but as many others have said, it was far too sweet.  I also found the consistency to be a bit more moist than I am used to.  I used this recipe because I lost track of the one I usually use, but I think I will need to search harder for it.  This will do in a pinch, but it's just too cloying without some serious changes.

Yummy! I used brown sweet rice and it turned out great. Simmered it a bit after adding coconut milk too just to make it extra sticky.

So here is the thing about "sticky rice" when making any white rice in a rice cooker you SHOULD NOT double the amount of water. Actually a friend who is a professional chef said that to get light airy rice the proportion should be one to one. I find that a bit dry you may need to play with the exact amount but its more like 1.5 to 1.75 to one water to rice to get sticky white rice and still have the grains intact.

I don't know what happened here. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes, and the result was inedible. The rice was undercooked (needs more water, I don't know if that's an altitude thing, I usually use a rice cooker), the whole thing was too salty.

 I don't know what went wrong, the recipe got such awesome reviews. Since everyone else loved it, I'm tempted to say it was something on my end that caused it to be such a disaster. I just can't figure out what.
Big disappointment.

definitely followed what people said. i tried making this the first time using the rice cooker method (where you add the coconut milk in with the sugar while it cooks), it took twice as long to cook the rice. i had the crushed pineapple with the rice, once it was cooked, and it tasted amazing! like a pina colada! i definitely made the mixture using 1/4 LESS than what is asked for.

i say, use the method that is written here: make the rice (stove top or rice cooker) then make the coconut mixture separately. once the rice is cooked, pour in the mixture and let it set (if using the stove top method to cook the rice, leave the heat on low-medium so the rice cooks in the mixture). i didn't end up making the sauce to pour over the rice cuz it tasted great without it. i used frozen mangoes cuz mangoes were out of season. otherwise it is an awesome recipe! highly recommended!!!!

I cooked the rice in my rice cooker and the texture came out fine, but I was disappointed with the flavor.  I read some reviews that said the original recipe was too sweet, so I tried making it with half the sugar - but the end result had very little sweetness.  I made the sauce but it turned out too thick and goopy - next time, I would probably follow the original recipe but not worry about the extra sauce.

Overall, a very delicious recipe.  The recipe did call for 1 cup of sugar, but I think this could have easily been reduced to 3/4 Cup of maybe a tad less. Though the recipe asked for 1 1/2 cups of uncooked rice, with the amount of sauce that was available, I think I could have used more rice, which I did end up adding (like a cup more of rice).  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, as I think it enhances the flavor of the coconut.  I did not make the extra sauce for the mangoes.  I did however, use the tapioca starch for the sauce used in the rice, as it looked a bit on the watery side.  It helped tremendously!  :)

My boyfriend had a hankering for sticky rice so I gave this one a whirl.  I followed the advice of others and pared the sugar down to 3/4C.  I also omitted the salt.  I made the sauce, but it turned out thick and nasty so I ddin't even use it.  I've never used tapioca starch before and I'm wondering if I even bought the correct stuff.  At any rate, the sauce is not needed.

I halved the recipe and used basmati rice as I didn't have any sticky/short grain rice. I also used Trader Joe's reduced fat coconut milk. It turned out fantastic! To make it even more healthier I eliminated the sauce and served the rice with the mango alone. This works great for the health conscious amongst us!

I used the recipe simply for the sticky rice... I needed the sweet sticky rice to duplicate a dessert from a local Thai restaurant in which they take sweet sticky rice, warm it slightly then put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and drizzle it with caramel and chopped nuts. The sweet sticky rice came out perfectly, but like other users warned I used a lot less of the coconut mixture so my rice wasnt soupy

This is a very good recipe.  I used Jasmine Thai rice and it gives it an amazing taste!!! Good also with Indian Curry Chicken!

Oh my goodness!  This is fabulous!  The only changes I made were reduce the sugar (as others suggested), omit the salt, and omit the tapioca salt.  I even used less coconut than called for.  I didn't make a sauce to put on top of it.  In my personal opinion, you don't even need the extra sauce on top.  This recipe tasted almost identical to the sweet sticky rice I have at my favorite local Thai restaurant.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I am so happy that I can now make this delicious dessert at home!

Very good! I made half of the recipe and I substituted sweet (sticky) rice for the short-grain white rice. The recipe is a little too sweet for me and the consistency is a little watery, but next time I'll just add less sugar and more rice.

This was a fantastic recipe which didn't even require that final sauce on the top to taste better than most that I have even purchased.

SO tasty and simple!  This serves WAY more than 4-- maybe 6?  We didn't have enough coconut milk to make the sauce, so we didn't make a sauce, and the dessert was perfectly sweet as is.  Sweetened condensed milk is tasty on top, but not necessary.  The rice has a great flavor.

This recipe didn't work out well for me.  I kept modifying it to get the taste to match that of my favorite Thai restaurant.  Can't say I got there, but this did give me a good start to figure out the ratios.

I am a HUGE fan of sticky rice from my favorite Thai restaurant, but we moved and I have been looking for a recipe ever since. This was awesome!! I actually bought sushi/sticky rice from an Oriental Grocery store and did everything else the same, except I reduced the first batch of sugar to 2/3 cup. I did make the sauce even though some reviewers said you don't need it. I found it DELICIOUS! I couldn't stop eating it! Just like the Thai restaurant I love!! I also tried it out on some friends who'd never had Thai food and they loved it! Thank you for this recipe!

Perfect and authentic! I spent a month in Thailand last year and this recipe tastes EXACTLY like what we had there. I didn't use the topping sauce though because I couldn't get the right consistency with the corn starch. It didn't even need it though..I also used canned mangos because up here in NH we didn't have access to fresh ones. SO DELICIOUS!

This was great!  I didn't measure my sticky rice (I never do), but it seemed like a lot, so I doubled the recipe, which was a good idea.  Also, I used lite coconut syrup, and only 3/4 of the sugar stated in the recipe.  The mixture looked thin to me, but thickened as it got absorbed.  I haven't finished putting everything together, but judging by the way my husband and kids keep stealing spoonfuls when my back is turned, it's a winner and a keeper.

Preparing it exactly as the recipe states doesn't work - Tooooooo much sugar to start. Everything else should be changed as well, needs to be rewritten. Its so sticky, it gets caught in every part of your mouth, throat and fills you up instantly.

mango sticky rice is one of my favorite desserts but it's hard to find at restaurants when the mango is out of season - this recipe saves the day! i just use frozen chopped mango from the grocery store which are always available.  the first time i prepared this recipe i didn't have any coconut milk. instead i used lowfat milk and about 5 drops of coconut extract and i couldn't tell the difference. yummy!

The flavor is nice and tastes like the real thing, however the rice is not the same consistency as sticky rice you find in Thailand or in Thai restaurants.

Delicious! Does a great job of replicating the restaurant experience. I cut the sugar in half for the rice sauce, and it was just the right amount of sweet! Next time, I would make twice the amount of topping drizzle as there was quite a bit more mango and rice than there was topping to drizzle over it.   Also, when I cooked the rice I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with coconut milk. Gave the rice a great flavor.

Very good and thanks for such a great recipe. The consistency is PERFECT! Sweet, simple and a great dessert. I love Thai and this recipe is so similar to my southern favorite rice pudding. I've used mango, pineapple, raisins and even a sprinkle of corn.

I didn't do sauce or mangos since I'm not a mango fan so it was sweet coconut rice. I tried it hot but like it better cold. I tried with ice cream but like it better next to chicken.

This was a good recipe, I did use corn starch instead of the tapioca. it still turned out great, but I would still use the tapioca starch if I had it. I think it might be a different flavor.

This was interesting, but I have never had this so I have no point of reference to go by.  I had some leftover rice and since it called for cooked rice (not instant) I thought I could use it, but mine was really soupy even after it cooled down.  I had to reheat it to evaporate some of the liquid.  I also didn't have tapioca starch, but thought I could sub corn starch, but maybe you can't?  My second sauce got really thick.  The taste was good and I liked the contrast with the mango.  I'm going to order this the next time I do thai to see how close it is.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome!!  I've been wanting to try a sticky rice recipe for awhile but have been a little bit hesitant because I dind't think it would be as good as in the restaurants.  This recipe was excellent!  I used pineapple instead of mango because I didn't have mangos on hand and I didn't make the sauce.  I didn't think it neeeded the sauce as it was so creamy and good by itself.  Definitely going in my recipe box to make again soon!

Wonderful. Very very yummy.  Not something I would make ahead of time though, it had dried out a little by the next morning.

Delicious! Didn't have short grain, used a medium grain and did not make the extra sauce.  As a Thai person rating this, I give this two thumbs up!

My mom makes the best coconut rice so I couldn't give it 5 stars.  We eat it with a scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream.  Very delicious!

This was great.  We were out of short grain, so I used long grain (stick with the short grain) rice, but all tasted great.  Perfect with Vanilla ice cream on top. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful!  Didn't make the sauce for the top.  Tastes just like in the restaurants but much cheaper!  Made it once with regular coconut milk and once with reduced fat coconut milk. The reduced fat didn't change the flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Very sweet, very delicious!  Made the sticky rice and topped it with mango and a few bananas (didn't have enough mango).  Also skipped the extra sauce and still found it a sweet and tastey treat! Reminded me of the local thai restaurant.

Not bad. I'm not sure what happened, but mine was a little soft and not quite as sticky as traditional Khao Neeo Mamuang. Good flavor, though.

I was looking for a Filipino sticky rice, and even though this is slightly different than what I wanted it was great. All of it was gone within the day. I would change a few things to make it more Filipino, first I was boil the first set of coconut milk and sugar for about a minute or two so the ultimate outcome was a bit more solid (I wanted it to be more rubbery). Then I would cook the rice longer (It was kind of hard). My Grandmother would always drizzle chocolate on top instead of mangoes and sesame seeds. I don't think the sauce is necessary at all, its good by itself. All in all this is a great recipe!

It is best to cool this by spreading it in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and then covering it. It cools faster and gets real sticky. My family found this too sweet so next time I'll reduce the sugar by quite a bit, but otherwise it was fantastic! Even my non-coconut eaters loved it!

Delightful recipe! Easy to make and delicious. Just a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar from 1 cup to 2/3 and see how it goes. The sauce is a lovely topper.

This is a simple, and easy to follow recipe that provides delicious results. I did use sweet Thai Sticky Rice (Sanpatong Three Rings Sweet Rice) ordered on Amazon. Don’t make the second syrup until the sticky rice and coconut milk mixture has cooled and you are ready to serve. The final topping syrup will dry and thicken if you make it too early. The tapioca starch (Anthony’s Organic) can also be ordered on Amazon. Enjoy!

Delicious and my toddler is now addicted! I too reduced the sugar and like it with or without the sauce and with or without the fruit! The coconut milk gives it an almost buttery taste that’s amazing! I will definitely make this again and again!!

So happy to have found this because I’m obsessed with mango sticky rice! But it is so dangerous because you can just go on making and eating it! It is simple enough to follow as well. I would point out that while the sesame seeds and salt seem like no big thing, they actually make such a difference so don’t omit it! They add texture and a contrasting taste that is just perfect with this rich dessert.

It was ok. The sauce with the tapioca starch I attempted twice and it came out the same both times, it was super thick like the magic slime that kids are making nowadays. Had it been more sauce like and not like thick clear jello then overall would've been great. The pictures online where it's all creamy and white look devine however mine is no where near that. Open to feedback for mods.

I made this dessert with lite coconut milk and half the amount of sugar. It was good but sweet! I can't imagine putting the full cup of sugar on it! Next time, I will try it with maybe a third of the sugar.

I thought this was really good. I was lucky to find a fantastic mango, sending this over the top. I thought the recipe, as written, was very good. Definitely STEAM the rice. I used a rice cooker. It was mush. The taste was still very good, though.

I very much enjoyed this, however, I suggest one alteration. Coconut milk tends to come in cans of 1.5 cups, enough to make a batch of the rice without the topping. Which I will do next time. Simply put, the rice is good enough, the topping adds... really nothing. No extra flavor. Just skip it entirely.

While I loved it as is, my room mate found it FAR too sweet, so you may need to dial back the sugar. If your using a sweet berry or melon, I'm sure you can reduce it a bit, but to each their own.

Also, I can't wait to use fresh strawberries with this.

I followed the recipe except I used1/2 c. sugar and used glutinous rice.  Also, I skipped the sauce.  It was very tasty, but there was still too sweet and too liquid-y, even after cooling.  

I think next time I will use 1/4 c. sugar and add maybe a 1/4 c. more rice.  Excellent dessert for vegan friends.

Like many,  I found this too sweet, but overall a great recipe. I would cut the sugar in half next time. If you find you are still needing it, I would blame the ripeness or quality of the mango. And, if you're saving this for later, I would skip the starch. I eat this once a week when my hub flies to BKK and picks me one up- I eat it for breakfast. Usually I can figure out my own recipe by taste but after a few failures, I came to allrecipes. Success! Soo addictive and delicious!

It is super easy to make and it tastes delicious!  My only suggestion is to use good quality coconut milk.

I used sticky rice (glutinous) and the starch was not necessary at all

So much easier to use the rice cooker for this recipe than the basket method. I halved the sugar and substituted corn starch for tapioca as suggested. It was delicious!

One of the better Mango & Sticky rice recipes I have tried for taste texture and ease. Followed other reviewers recommendationsand,  my laziness, as follows:  used sushi rice (unrinsed) ratio 1.5 cps rice to 1.75 cups water and cooked ~25 min till water absorbed. Then cooked all coconut milk, only .5 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp salt, and added 3/4+ to cooling rice. Took remaining amt of coconut milk sugar sauce in pot and added 1.5Tbsp corn starch and whisked over heat. Used ripe champagne mangos (peeler makes it much easier). Excellent warm or chilled.  Next time will up the rice amt to 2 cups and water to 2.25 cups (because we can eat more).  Perfect post exercise dish, as well as works for breakfast or dessert.

WOW! This is excellent and easy. I poured sauce over leftover rice and cubed mangos that I just stirred in. I omitted the part with 1/2 cup coconut milk because I already used the whole can in the first mixture. Did not feel like opening another can for a 1/2 cup. My rice was cold and it worked just fine.

Spectacular!  I did make a couple of minor changes. I cut the sugar in half and it was still verging on too sweet. Trust me. Then I followed another reviewers advice to put the tablespoon of tapioca starch in the liquid that you let the rice rest in after it's cooked for an hour. By the way, I used Aborio rice, a short Italian rice and it turned out perfectly.  I also did use the tablespoon of tapioca starch in the sauce. Don't skip the sauce, I almost did and it would have been a mistake it's awesome!

Oh wow, this dessert rice is awesome, my wife and I both loved it. The only changes I made were I only used 2/3 of a cup of sugar and topped it with peaches instead of mangoes.

Wayyyy too sweet! I'd like to taste the coconut flavor more, instead of just sugar. Next time the sugar will be cut in 1/2 at least. Maybe 1/3 cup total. I'd taste it as you go. 1 cup is way too sweet! And the toasted sesame seeds are a strong flavor. Some of my family loved them, and another disliked the taste of them completely. Serve them on the side, or go easy on the toasted sesame seeds.

I soaked the rice for 8 hours, based upon other suggestions.  Haven't made this recipe before, so don't know if soaking the rice made any difference.

I didn't mix all the sauce into the rice, as that seemed to be a lot.  Probably only used 2/3 the sauce for mixing, which seemed to work out pretty well.  I used the rest of the sauce to pour over the dessert when served.

Overall, recipe was easy, and turned out really well.

Came out excellent, the 2nd attempt. If you have never tried a recipe like this, make sure you soak your rice before you start (about 12-24 hours). If not, the rice may be hard when you are finished. I know, because I did it.

Followed the recipe exactly for the rice and it was not glutinous enough and was way too sweet. Sad! I just ended up putting plain coconut milk on top in hopes of mellowing out the sweetness. Wouldn't use this recipe again.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe except that I doubled the amount of coconut sauce and used cornstarch instead of tapioca.  I also combined some sliced peaches with the sliced mangoes because one of the mangoes was so ripe that it was more like mango sauce.  We thought this was just as good as at our favorite Thai restaurant!

This Americanized version tastes good, but if you like real Thai food and have had real Thai sticky rice, this recipe will disappoint you greatly. But if you don't have access to glutinous (sticky) rice, having this version is probably better than not having it at all.

Tasted great, but the rice came out too soft for my liking.  I'll try again using a 1:1 ratio and see if it turns out better.

I cut back on the rice a bit and scaled up the sugar and salt a bit to accommodate a full can of coconut milk for the rice mixture.  Made it a bit saucier, and stayed saucier when refrigerated.  I use just the rice portion of this along with the Coconut Ice Cream recipe on this site...and the two together are heavenly.

Made it almost exactly as the recipe stated.  The only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and that was enough.  Tasted authentic when freshly made, but does not keep well.

I had Sweet Sticky Rice for the first time at the end of a vegetarian cooking class I was taking.  I hoped that this recipe would be as good as I remembered this dish to be ... and it was!!!  A bit time consuming but well worth it!  It makes a nice dessert after serving a refreshing stir-fry meal to your guests!

This is a great recipe!  I did make 2 changes.  First, I used cornstarch instead of tapioca starch because it was what I had on hand.  Second, I toasted some unsalted peanuts to replace the sesame seeds with.   So Good!!!

This was very yummy! I used brown rice and, after reading other reviews (and personal preference), I cut the sugar to 1/2C, which was perfect.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cardamom.  This as best fresh and warm, or cold the next day.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks Michelle!

This is as good as I have had in any Thai restaurant.  So easy and yummy.  I did not have mango on hand but used pineapple, like another reviewer.

Excellent!  This was my fisrt experience with Mango sticky rice and all I can say is, "YUM"!  I used arborio rice (only short grain rice I had on hand) and didn't make the second sauce for pouring over.  This was the perfect dessert for our Thai meal.  Thanks! PS: even better the second day... I ate the rest of breakfast :)

My husband adores this dish at our favorite Thai restaurant, so I though I'd give it a try.  It was GREAT, we make it all the time.  Especially good in the summer when Mangoes are in season in Missouri.
