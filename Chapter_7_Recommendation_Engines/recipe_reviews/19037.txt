I had never made crepes before, but thought, "how hard could it be?"  Well, it does take a little practice.  The first few attempts were "practice crepes"!  You need the right sized pan, and it should be nonstick, for ease of turning.  A tiny bit of Pam sprayed on the pan ensures that they don't stick, and worked better for me than oil or butter.  I kept trying to turn the crepe to soon, and it would fall apart.  Go ahead and let it cook until it looks completely cooked before you flip it, and then it only has to cook for just a bit on the other side.  I also found a fairly low heat works best - around 2 on my particular stove.  We fill these with a mixture of warm sweetened cottage cheese and cream cheese flavored with a bit of vanilla, and then top with either a fresh fruit sauce or canned fruit filling.  Cottage cheese gets very watery when warmed, so you either need to strain it before mixing with the other ingredients, or use dry curd cottage cheese.  We have also slathered Nutella on the crepe, filled with sliced bananas, and topped with slivered almonds and whipped cream.

Amazing.  I use this all the time because it has never failed me.  A friend tried to skimp on the butter but hers did not turn out well.  I have tried margarine instead of butter and that works but the taste surely suffers.  (no true buttery taste)  Definitely add vanilla extract.  These FREEZE very well and have often rescued me when I have unexpected guests.  Sounds like a lot of eggs but actually does not have an eggy taste to it.  I have also used the recipe for bacon/asparagus wraps.  Also, I have put in salt/pepper, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and portabellos to make it a crepe sandwich wrap...DELICIOUS!

Excellent submission Ann!  This is one of the best crepe recipes I've found so far.  I added a little vanilla extract and some cinnamon to the batter for added flavor...though it's great as is.  I made these for breakfast and as a snack for my kids.  My hubby (who's picky about this kind of stuff) gave me 2 thumbs up.  Will definitley make again.  Thanks

I have been making crepes for 15 years, using various recipes and now finally  I found one that is a real keeper!  I mixed all ingredients, adding 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla in the blender for a perfect batter.  Then I let it settle in the fridge for a few hours.  These were the easiest and BEST crepes ever.  They were thin yet sturdy enough to flip, maintained a perfect round shape and were delicious!  Thank you!!!

Delicious!  I was an expert creper with the first one.  Combine ingredients in the bowl and whisk together per instructions.  Then put combined ingredients in the blender.  Blend for 10 seconds.  Mine had no lumps.  Make sure to pour a little mix into the pan and spread thin by moving the pan around.  My fiance and I loved them.  Try with raspberry jam and cool whip.  Roll then sprinkle with powdered sugar.  These are soooooo yummy.  You won't be disappointed.

First time creper! And boy did I end up looking like a pro! This recipe was a cinch. Although, I wasn't able to get it mini-lump free all the crepes turned out munchingly good! Positive feedback from all users* (Ebayese)A++++++

The flavour (Cdn spelling) was subtle, not too eggy but still a little eggy, texture was smooth and the strength was all there (held all the strawberries/ice cream/ whipped cream and chocolate sauce in!). People wanted to know WHEN I'd become such a good cook. Humbly all I had to say was "Allrecipes.com, baby."

Absolutely wonderful.
I added a pinch of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to mine.  I served them with sliced strawberries, la Creme vanilla yogurt and a sprinkling of brown sugar.  Yummy!
The crepes were extremely easy to make and the recipe made way more than 8 crepes (but I used a small crepe pan).
Great recipe -- definitely a keeper!

Thank you for this delicious recipe.  I made it twice... the first time, I followed the recipe, and it was delicious.  The 2nd time I made it, I added the same amount of brown sugar as the recipe called for white sugar (in addition to the white sugar) and I liked it even better.  I also added a drop of vanilla and a little cinnamon.  Delicious!!

I screwed up and left out the butter and these were STILL great. (I might continue to make them this way, to be a little healthier).

When I saw the recipe for this I was really excited.  I found the already made ones at the store and they were quite expensive....these were so much cheaper and they tasted better.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.  I use them to make just about anything for the filling.  Thanks.

Delish! After trying several crepe recipes on this site, the others ("Crepes" and "Basic Crepes") are a thicker batter; this runnier recipe is much better for dessert crepes. THE KEY to crepes is once you mix up the batter, let it sit at room temperature for an hour.  Learned this from my aunt who took a master cooking class in France, and it made all the difference in the texture of the crepes. If you have ever disliked crepes for being "rubbery", letting the batter sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours is the answer.  Batter gets rubbery if refridgerated and kept more than a day. Made one time adding 1 tsp vanilla, per other reviews, and another time without. It was excellent either way. I filled these with Nutella, and served them with strawberries or raspberries on top, sprinkled with powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream.

Just had these for New Year's day breakfast. Very good...added warm rasberry sauce which consisted of: 1 cup sweetened frozen red raspberries, thawed..1/3 c. powdered sugar...2 tsp. cornstarch...1/2 tsp. vanilla extract...To prepare sauce: combine raspberries, powdered sugar, cornstarch and vanilla in a small sauce pan. Set pan over med. heat and simmer until raspberries break down and sauce thinckens...about 3 to 5 minutes...serve over crepes...top with whipped cream...wonderful!!!

EXCELLENT.  Made them for dessert for a French themed dinner for 13 guests.  2 batches of the recipe as written gave me 23 8" crepes.  I used the recipe as written, added a splash of vanilla, then added add'l sugar and salt to taste.  They start to cook right away in the heated pan, so I would remove the pan from the stovetop, hold it at a fairly steep angle and pour the batter into the top of the pan (using a 1/3 cup scoop) and let gravity do its thing to get the batter to spread out thin.  Worked great.  Stacked them on a plate with pieces of parchment paper between layers, stored overnight in a Corningware dish with a lid.  They sweat a little for some reason, but this did not affect taste or texture.  Served at rm temp as a "crepe station" where guests had strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, bananas, hot fudge, Nutella, powdered sugar and whipped cream to stuff their own crepes.  RAVE reviews.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent crepes.  Easier to make than I thought - I was a pro by the second crepe! Use a good non-stick pan. Hard to get all the lumps out. You must work very fast to spread the batter over the surface of the pan otherwise it will be of uneven thickness - just pour it on, adding it in 3 separate spoonfuls isn't quick enough.  I topped with Betty Crocker's Raspberry Sauce and some whipped cream.

Fast, simple and truly a great basic crepe recipe. I used an oversized skillet to get large, very thin crepes. Superb!

I liked that this recipe is simple.  I opted to use my blender.  It was good that it didn't have to sit in the fridge first.  I would recommend using a non-stick small frying pan for best result.  You have to rotate the pan at an  angle so that the batter can spread over the sides a little.  Make sure not to just let it get too thick in the center.  You can check if it started to brown a little by turning the edge and looking under.  You can toss to flip (it's fun that way) or carefully using even your fingers take the edges and turn over, or the more conventional spatula way.  I am more daring, so I usually stick to the first two.  For the filling I used a little Raspberry Jam spread on the crepe, added thin slices  of fresh strawberries and bananas.  Rolled the crepe and topped it with Cool Whip and drizzled chocolate or Raspberry syrup over them.  There is where you can let your creativity run wild.  Growing up I watched and helped my mom make crepes.  Although the kind she makes uses ground beef, chopped parsley, green onions, chopped onions, salt and pepper for the filling.  When making it this way I play havoc with the spices variation.  Liking to add curry, sometimes oregano or other indian spices.   This is a flexible recipe.  So enjoy and have some for breakfast, refrigerate and have it again for dinner or dessert. :)

Yummy. I cut the butter in half, left out the sugar, and added a tsp of vanilla and about a tsp of fresh grated lemon zest. My family traditionally fills crepes with different flavors of marmalade/fruit preserves, others with honey, and some more plain with just a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar. Thanks Ann!

Nice crepe recipe.  CAUTION: If you are making crepes for the first time, it may take you some practice to get the actual cooking technique right.  Adjust the cooking heat until you are able to get the crepes perfectly thin and even before the batter sets in the pan.

This is the best crepe recipe I have tried on here yet. I added 2 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. I also put mixture in blender instead of whisking which helps. I used 2 sauces inside: Sauce A. 1 1/2 c. blueberries, 1 tb. cornstarch, and enough water to cover bottom of a pan. Bring to a boil, stirring until creates a nice blueberry sauce. Sauce B: 8 oz. cream cheese and gradually add fruit juice (i had leftover from a fruit salad I made but any juice would work) until comes to a desired sauce consistency. These 2 sauces combined on these crepes are delicious! My husband and daughter loved them!

Some things I've learned:
-USE A SIFTER! Sift your flour and sugar. And then when you're done with the batter, pour everything through it. This'll guarantee a wonderfully smooth crepe.
-It's okay if your mix is really runny. This is good cause then you can swish it around to make a nice circle on your pan before it cooks through.
-Go light with the pan grease. Your crepe will turn out more crispy than soggy, which is good.
-Using unbleached whole wheat flour will give you a more 'earthy' crepe. Bleached all purpose white looks more authentic. Both taste good.
-Add vanilla or almond extract for enhanced crepe flavor. I also took the liberty of adding a dash of cinnamon, makes a difference.

Anywho. I made this for my family-they absolutely loved it. Also for my friends. Prime ingredients I used were Nutella, then strawberries and bananas. Later I incorporated custard and whipped cream, which were greeted with much enthusiasm. VERY easy to prepare, much more easy to consume. Great simple to tuck away to impress guests.

great recipe, i made several hundred for a family gathering. i made them the night before and wrapped them in plastic wrap overnight and i had no problem getting them apart the next day. i spread buttercream frosting on half and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it, then folded them in half twice and they were a hit, very easy to make and to eat!

Wonderful crepes!  I had some at a restaurant once and decided to find a recipe online.  My husband said these were even better than the ones I had at the restaurant.

I make crepes each year for Easter, carrying on with my mom's tradition.  This year I made 55 crepes, which freeze beautifully!   I just take each out of the crepe pan when they're done and roll them up and place in rows in a 13 x 9 pan then cover well and freeze!   My suggestion which makes them even more delicious, is to make certain that you add at least 1 tsp. of vanilla to the recipe.  This makes a decided difference in the taste!   Yum.  Take out of the freezer the day or two prior to when you plan on serving them.  I cover the pan with foil and heat in a very low oven, about 250 degrees until nice and warm.  Serve with real maple syrup or homemade fruit syrup.  Delish!   Crepes are not difficult to make but are very  time consuming!   Cam Barbett

Our favorite crepe recipe we've tried (and that's a whole bunch). I cut down on the sugar just a little. These turned out super thin with our crepe maker  (electric appliance I recommend if you really like crepes) and had great flavor. I don't think they would have to be just dessert crepes. We put strawberry syrup, nutella, peanut butter, chocolate sauce, and yogurt on them (not necessarily at the same time). We've also used them like wraps and filled with meat and vegetables. Yum!

My family loves this recipe. They can't get enough of them. Even my mother-in-law, who usually hates the food I make, can't stop talking about these crepes! I did use my blender after my first run because it takes the lumps out. I put sliced sweetened strawberries in mine with a lemon glaze and powdered sugar on top. The lemon glaze is just powdered sugar and lemon until at a syrup consistency.

Very good! I have tried a few other crepe recipes and this one is by far the best. I added a splash of vanilla extract to the mix and when they were done I just sprinkled powdered sugar on them and rolled them up and they were perfect!

This recipe was pretty good, but benefits from some changes. I followed it exactly as written and with a very light spraying of pam on my pan, the first 6-7 crepes were VERY greasy. I did not respray and the ones toward the end were better, but still a bit oily - I would decrease the amount of butter in the future to maybe 1.5T. I used a typical medium/small nonstick pan and it really is unnecessary to oil these with the butter present in the batter. Also, for dessert crepes, I think you should add a bit of vanilla extract, or maybe even a bit of almond for a change. This says it will make 8 crepes, but I got about double that using 3T of batter for each crepe. If you added less sugar this could easily be adapted for savory crepes.

I make these as a special Sunday treat or for overnight guests for breakfast.  We fill them with homemade lemon curd, (found on this site as well), dust with pwd. sugar and a few drops of fresh squeezed lemon juice on top.  I get repeat requests for this from everyone! 

My daughters recently married and both requested this recipe in their "family favorites"recipe book I was making.  Their husbands are now hooked on these as well!!  

They cook up light and fluffy and do save nicely in the fridge.  But, you MUST cool completely BEFORE putting them into a plastic bag.  If you don't, they will mold quickly.   I make a double recipe - my husband will eat on the leftover crepes during the week  - filling them after reheating in the microwave.

Real men do eat crepes - as well as quiche!!!

This recipe was GREAT!  I thought it would be hard, but it was seriously easy.  And they taste absolutely wonderful!! Just make sure that you use a teflon coated pan, and to keep the crepes, when they are done, and while still cooking the others, in the oven to keep warm.  They did reheat great though when I put the leftovers in the fridge.  I just put Nutella and whipped cream on mine and cant get enough of them!

My dad used to make these when I was a kid, and I LOVED them.  When I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to try it.  It was so easy, and my husband and daughter LOVED them.  We sometimes make them as a breakfast (like french toast).  I have used pie filling to fill them, sugar and cinnamon, ice-cream, pudding, and my daughters favorite-- applesauce.  Just make sure to tip the pan to get the batter spread evenly.  Yummmyyyy....

Yummmmmmy! My son, otherwise known as His Pickiness loved them with a little sugar and lemon.  One caveat, the recipe says it makes 6 crepes and I made at more than 20. Can easily be halved.

This recipe was a hit in my house from the youngest to the oldest. I made the crepes according to the recipe with the exception I was a little short on milk and just substituted water for the difference. They still came out perfect. For the filling, I started out spreading strawberry jam down the center, then I used a sweet cream cheese mixture (1 pkg cream cheese, ½ c white sugar, & 4 oz. cool whip), then added a little more cool whip.  I rolled them up and then sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top. In some I put fresh blueberries. Bananas would work well to, I only had the fresh blueberries on hand when I made these. My only downfall was that I did not double the recipe. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Great sweet crepe recipe! I think the reason some had lumpy batter was adding the melted butter to cold ingredients. The milk should be at room temp for un-lumpy results.

Very tasty! The batter whipped up perfectly in the blender...no lumps! This recipe also makes more then 8 crepes. I know I used a smaller pan then recommended but out of one recipe I got 25 (6 inch) crepes.

these crepes are excellent!! we do one batch savory (with ham, swiss, mushrooms and tomatoes) and then one batch for desert. I use some fresh vanilla bean in the desert batch(about 1/2 a bean)...yummy w/lemon curd! Will store in fridge for about a week and still taste great.

I absolutely love crepes and this is fantastic! Easy to fill with savory or sweet applications. I like to sprinkle just a little bit of sugar once I have flipped the crepe, it creates a bit of caramelization.

Great recipe but probably not best for a crepe maker you dip into the batter.  It didn't stick to it at all and I had to convert to a pan which made the crepes a little thicker but still very tasty.  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

I've been making this recipe for years and my family loves it.  

For those of us who need to watch our cholesterol, I want to tell you that these are absolutely amazing when made with egg beaters and skim milk.  I use smart balance light in the recipe and cooking spray in the crepe pan.  You will be amazed at how great they taste.  Everyone can enjoy!

I've been making crepes since I was 10 (I'm 27 now). This is the best recipe I've ever tried. They seem too runny but just be patient while they cook and they'll turn out perfect. We fill ours with cinnamon and butter, yummy!

Made this for a special dessert.  I used a 10 1/2 inch cast iron flat skillet. It had no sides.  I had to swirl the pan so that the batter could spread out.  They got progressively better because the skillet was too hot to start. We made mixed fruit inside with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  I added a little orange liquer to mix with the fruit.  The second round was nutella and bananas. yummy!

perfect consistency. more eggs are generally better. oil can be substituted for butter if your batter is cold and the butter is congealing.

I was very excited to make these, I thought they would be a little difficult the first time but they weren't at all! I had a great time with these crepes and they are delicious. I mixed strawberry jam with cream cheese and filled them with that and they are fantastic! I was going to put a tsp of vanilla into the batter (as per the other reviews) but I forgot. I think the vanilla would have been good in them but they are great with out it. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

These are so easy and fast! This wasy my first time making crepes and I will be making them again for sure! No refigeration needed! I added a 1/2 tsp vanilla and substituted whole wheat pastry flour and they came out great! If you do use this type of flour, it does settle to the bottom after some time, so just make sure you stir it every once and a while when making them.

I only had three eggs, but it still turned out great! I blended all the ingredients in the blender so the batter was homogenous and silky. I took a folded paper towel dipped in melted butter and smeared it around the skillet before cooking each crepe (for even browning). For the filling I used the Cream Cheese II frosting from this website (which isn't overly sweet), and drizzled blueberry sauce (I cooked frozen blueberries with a few spoons of sugar until it was syrupy) on top. This is so delicious it is ridiculous.

I have tried a lot of different recipes for crepes, and so far these are my favorite.
they are good by themselves,or(my personal favorite)with blackberry jelly,powdered sugar,and lemon juice as the filling. On top put butter,(just a bit so it looks good)lemon juice and powdered sugar.

My family and I lived in France for 12 years and have not had crêpes since. Well I found this recipe and I LOVED IT!!!!! It tasted just like the ones we had in France. My dad downed about six right there as I was cooking them! This recipe is AMAZING and I know I will be making these again!

These were fantastic! I had no idea crepes were so easy to make! I guess having a crepe pan really helped. I doubled the recipe and found the recipe was exactly right for 8 crepes! I think these would be even better with cinnamon and vanilla!

Made as directed; used hand held blender to keep smooth.  Don't skimp on butter or sugar to change content; they are a MUST!  Key to perfect crepes is a proper size pan; proper heat, and pouring JUST enough batter to cover 75% of the pan, then swirling the pan around to continue the coverage to the bottom of the pan.. this will make paper thin crepes.  We just sprinkle with sugar; or for a light tasty dessert we fill with fresh strawberry's then top with whip creme!  DECADENT!  GREAT recipe!

Love this recipe!! The best crepe I've ever had is from a small crepe stand in Key West, FL and I would say this recipe is as good, if not better, than the one in Key West. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 tsp of vanilla to my batter, the result was a wonderfully tasty vanilla crepe!! I also used a food processor to mix all my ingredients so I didn't have any lumps in my batter. I cooked my crepes on a large non-stick pan at medium-high heat (gas mark 4-5 on my stove) for about 1 minute on each side or until I saw some browning. I flipped my crepes with my hands by lightly pinching one side of the crepe, taking it off the pan, and then flipping it. This way you won't tear your crepes.

For generations the entire family has raved about my great-grandmother's crepes. I wanted to let them taste a bit of the past, so to speak, and surprise them with crepes. Well, it was a surprise all right. The room was really silent and after asking what was wrong I was told this recipe was better than any other.

I was very nervous to try making crepes because they seem so delicate but, they were stronger than I thought. They were delicious! Very easy, very fast. This recipe will bring friends over once a week for a "crepe night"!

Pretty yummy but not the absolute best crepes I have ever had. I am spoiled since I had crepes in France. Those would be hard to beat, but these are pretty good. We just had them with a little whipped cream and strawberry sauce.

I was a bit worried because I made these for Christmas breakfast, but it turned out amazing!!! I made them like the recipe said but I added a pinch of cinnamon and vanilla extract. The crepes were super easy to flip and not ONE "broke". This is definitely a keeper! My only question is that I kept getting huge chunks of butter because it kept cooling. To fix that situation I just whisked the batter each time before adding  it to the pan

This recipe was AMAZING!  I have never made crepes before and really impressed my family with this delicious treat.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, per suggestions from other reviewers.  I used a teflon pan, reduced the servings to 2 and had enough for four crepes.  I left the batter out for an hour prior to making, and sifted my flour and sugar into the mix.  The batter was perfectly smooth, the crepes were delightfully light and even.  I did place the crepes on a paper towel to blot excess oil as they seemed to really absorb the oil used when I brushed the pan.  On next attempt, I will omit brushing the pan with oil.  I used Nutella as a spread, placed frozen cool whip in the center, and topped them with powdered sugar, a bit more cool whip and sprinkled mini choc. chips on top.  I also made one with apple butter instead of Nutella.  Based on my family's reaction, will be making these a lot in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!! :)

Very good and easy recipe. I watched Good Eats crepe episode and found myself craving crepes. I had never eaten or made crepes before but they looked delicious! I found this recipe and decided to try it...as with other reviewers I had trouble with lumps, so I did how I saw Alton Brown mix his crepes. Put everything in a blender and blend no more than 7-10 seconds. This did wonders, my mix was smooth. I knew when to turn the crepes when the edges started lifting off the pan. I sprinkled with sugar and had 2...very rich tasting and full of flavor! Great recipe and alot easier to make crepes than I thought. :)

follow recipe exactly - it's one of the family favorites! Cooking spray works great, don't need to spread oil on with paper towel. Just make sure you don't try to skip spraying inbetween crepes or hey will stick for sure.

This recipe is nearly perfect!  I added 1 TBSP of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to give them a sweeter flavor.  I would suggest that instead of whisking the batter, if you have a blender or an immersion blender, use that for a completely lump free batter.  Also, letting the batter rest for 30 min in the refrigerator assures that the crepes will taste their best and not have a floury taste.

These crepes are the best I have ever had and so easy to make. I added a half tsp of vanilla. My batter was a little lumpy but then I realized the lumps were butter. Maybe the cold milk caused it to harden. I put in the microwave for 30 seconds (being very careful not to cook the batter), then mixed again and the lumps completely disappeared.  This is a family favorite now.

I've had crepes and absolutely love them. This is the first time I have ever tried making them myself, and they turned out perfect the first time! They taste identical to the ones I get in the restaurant! I add different kinds of fruit like bananas, strawberries, blueberries, and smear nutella on the crepe, and lastly add powdered sugar and whipped cream on top - SO delicious! This is a must have recipe!!

Super! My daughter had been begging me to make crepes - I filled these with sliced strawberries and just a few choc. chips, the chips melted in the hot crepe and they were divine! Would be lovely as a savory crepe as well with ham and cheese or veggies and cheese.

I ended up adding a little pure vanilla, and some cinnamon to this recipe to make it a little bit sweeter.  I would probably add a tiny bit more milk next time to make  it a little bit thinner.  I used a little less batter after the first couple of crepes and that helped, but it was a bit hard to get it to spread all around the bottom of the pan while trying to keep them thin.  The thickness was actually helpful though in keeping  them from tearing.  In fact, not one of the crepes tore as I was flipping them and filling / rolling them.  We LOVED these crepes!  Enjoy : )

These were easy to make and had my dog drooling a puddle, while mommy cooked them.  :)
2 Humans & 2 Service Dogs approved!
I never thought that I could make these without burning them, but now I am in trouble because these are going to become a staple in this house.

amazing recipe!! quick, easy, and it makes for very delicious crepes. i made a few changes based on other reviews and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon. i think ill put more next time for truly indulgent crepes. after manually mixing it i threw it in the blender and got rid of all the lumps then i put it on low heat on my stove. i also used a little bit of pan spray-on oil instead of butter just because it seemed alot easier. i cooked it longer on the first side than on the second and the crepes came out fantastic!! i made it for mother's day and filled it with apple pie filling topped off with a dusting of confectioner's sugar and it looked like i was a real chef!! lol. Definantly a keeper=]

These are absolutely delicious. I always make them for special occasion breakfasts. For Easter this year, I served them with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. The recipe is perfect just the way it is! You can add vanilla or maple syrup but isn't really necessary. *yum*

This recipe is genius!! To make it perfect, I added some vanilla extract like the other reviews said, and it really made a difference. To get the clumps out of  the mix, I drained it with a strainer since I was in a hurry and my blender was dirty. It worked just as well! I also recommend  that you pour about 1/3 cup of the mix into the pan, instead of just trying to cover it.

I LOVE this recipe.  I had never made crepes before and mine turned out great!   Definately a keeper.  I couldn't find this recipe and I made another one from allrecipes.  It was very good too, but this version is a little lighter and better.  Glad I found it again.  A little homemade lemon curd, fresh strawberries...yum!!!!

A perfect recipe for crepes!  You can't go wrong if you have the correct small frying pan & you don't put too much batter in the pan....I thought the sprinkled sugar on top was delicious (I put strawberries & toasted almonds inside with a little whipped cream; even the lemon & sugar with nothing else was surprisingly tasty). I think it would be good for a group -- if you could make them one by one (or two by two if you had a second pan) to make them hot & fresh. This recipe is a keeper.

Easy to make.  We even forgot to melt the butter and it turned out great.  We omitted the sugar as we wanted some sweet and some savory crepes for breakfast. Yum!

Outstanding crepe recipe and easy to make.  Since I am using the crepes for a dessert (w/dulce de leche), I added 2 tsps of vanilla extract.  I whisked the ingredients in a bowl and then poured the mixture in the blender to obtain a cohesive mixture free of lumps.  Thank you to reviewer "D. Hi." who mentioned the blender-method on her review.  I made twelve 8" crepes.

I never made good crepes until I found this recipe.  THis is a winner!  I doubled them and made ahead for a party.  At party time, I filled them with berries and put them in the oven. They were amazing!

This was a great recipe.  I have no others to compare to because this was my first attempt at making crepes. They turned out great so therefore, 5 stars!  I thought they would be really hard, but they were really easy!  After each one cooked i added some cream cheese mixed with raspberry preserves then rolled them up!  I also added a tsp of vanilla to the mix.  Will definitly make again :)

I used this recipe instead of the one my mom always used because I didn't it handy and this one worked out great.  It made considerably more than 8 per batch; I double the batch from the start and got 37 8" crepes.  I was surprised (pleasantly!) and so I'll freeze the leftovers.    I used a standard, cheap, non-stick pan and found that I didn't need to butter it.  I did the first time but not after.  The butter in the crepes seemed to do the trick.  This was another pleasant surprise because it resulted in one less step.  I will definitely keep this recipe as my go to crepe recipe.

Great BASE recipe!! I tripled the recipe, added vanilla, the made a "crepe cake". Laid the crepes flat open and filled with whipped cream(you can add chocolate cream, pastry cream etc.!!) and covered with chocolate ganache by INGRIDIVOGEL(without the rum) on this site. It was GREAT!!!

This is an excellent basic crepe recipe.  I have made it at least 10 times now.  Easy and fun to experiment with different options.  I recommend experimenting with nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla in the batter.  I recommend nutella & bananas, or fresh fruit and real whipped cream, or lingonberries, or pie filling in the inside.  Thank you for this!

My husband used this recipe to make me crepes for Mothers Day. I noticed that the batter was a lot thinner than my original crepe recipe and thought he was in trouble. But this was by far the best dessert crepe I've had in a LONG time. This is now my staple recipe. Adding orange zest to the batter makes a world of difference.

Perfect flavor! This was my first time making crepes, and I heard they're really hard, but making these was no where as hard as I thought. I did put in 1-1/2 TBSP of butter in instead of TSP, but it was really good, so I'd recommend it. That probably helped with the sticking factor, too. Like butta.

Superb crepe recipe!  I make berry crepes for breakfast from time to time (accompanied with the "cheese filling") and they are very delicious!!!  My family loves them.  You can use any fresh or frozen berry - simply cook in a saucepan over medium heat with a little sugar and a little lemon juice.

you need to put all the ingredients into a blender to mix.  this will solve the problem the other poster had with a lumpy batter.  i made a few subs because i didn't have the ingredients.  i used 2% milk instead of whole.  i used baker's sugar instead of regular granulated.  i used 3/4 stick of butter instead of the two tablespoons because another recipe i had calls for that amount.  
i served them with sliced strawberries sprinkled with a little sugar and a dark dark chocolate sauce from a stash i got from trader joe's when i was in boston.  i also did the lemon and sugar.

I had tasted crepe at a french friend's party and i asked her for the reciepe but she went back to france before i could get it from her. I looked up and i just wanted basic easy recipe for a first timer. Using your recipe, I had the best recipe turn over. I used nutella as a spread and it turned out extremely good, too good infact.....

I've made these crepes twice now with beautiful results!!  I cut the recipe in half and I can eat the entire batch all by myself with a sprinkling of lemon juice and powdered sugar.  Now I just have to figure out what other toppings to put on them for variety.  But even plain, they are wonderful!  The best! :)

I have never made crepes before in my life.  I never attempted it because I always thought they were too difficult to make.  I had a bunch of strawberries that were going to go bad and after reading the reviews on this I thought I'd give it a try.  I used three XL eggs (instead of the four) a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and some cinnamon.  They were phenomenal!  Thank you ANN57 for such a great recipe.  I just hope it hasn't gone to my head.

Excellent recipe. Great consistency. Used recipe as is except combined flour, sugar and salt. I then lightly beat my eggs and added the milk which I heated slightly in my microwave to about room temperature, then whisked in the butter and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Sift in the flour mixture while whisking lightly and it avoids a lot of the lumping.

I hate to bring the recipes ratings down.  Especially when so many other people rate it so high.  (That is the reason I tried this recipe!)  And this was my first attempt at crepes.  But this was a complete flop at my house.  They were VERY eggy.  And as I look at other recipes on the internet and I don't see any others that call for 4 eggs.  I tried serving them with sweeten cream cheese, jam, fresh blueberries, chocolate sauce....no one liked any version.  My youngest kept calling them omelets because of the egg taste.  They were very easy to make and cooked up well.  So I had to give a couple of stars.  I might try this again with less eggs...

Really easy to make and come out beautiful.  The first time I made them I followed directions exactly.  Made them second time around and added vanilla and used only 3 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk as I thought the first time "may" have had an eggy taste.  Still came out beautiful, tasty and in my opinion less eggy.  Thanks for the recipe.

A decent base crepe to which you can add lots of yummy toppings! I'd like for the base to be a little sweeter but that is my personal preference. I was surprised that I could actually flip them and not tear them apart!

These were delicious! I made them for my family and everyone loved them. I usually make waffles for breakfast on Sunday and decided we needed a change. I put a little more sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. They were fantastic. 

My only hint is to make sure that pan is hot enough. I thought the pan was hot enough for the first one and it didn't turn out great. It still tasted good but didn't look right. The next one was much better. Good luck!

Absolutely AMAZING!! Sooo yummy! Just a side note, my batter was also a little lumpy but i just poured it through a colander when pouring into the skillet. Worked perfect! Next time i'll try sifting the flour.

The recipe is quite good and makes plenty.  The only problem was getting the batter super smooth. No matter how much I mixed and wisked I still seen little clumps. The crepes still turned out great!

Important: crepe batter should always be rested for an hour or more before being cooked. Also, they don't have to be served immediately, you can make a big stack, refrigerate for later use, etc.

This is a simple and wonderful recipe, and I love the fact that it doesn't require the resting time my old one did.  The only changes I made were to use half a cup of whole wheat flour, and half a cup of regular white, and to add a bit of vanilla. 

 It was easy and fast and turned out great.

These crepes turned out beautifully lacy and so tasty. The only thing I changed was I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I like that you don't have to refrigerate the batter first. Great recipe! Thank you.

EASY and DELICIOUS crepes.  I hate to say it but it's better than my mom's crepe recipe.  The only thing I did differently was I cooked the crepes on a med-low heat.  Number 3.5/10 on an electric range.  Try Nutella as a filling.  Mmmm...

This was an excellent recipe...I only made one slight adjustment. Instead of whisking the ingredients (I found that the batter was hard to get completely smooth), I threw all the ingredients in the blender. A quick whiz, and it was smooth and silky. Also, if you only want a few crepes (for one or two people), you can put the rest of the batter in the fridge and just blend it up before cooking.

I always thought I needed a special pan to make crepes and I thought it was hard to do. Neither one of those is true. I used a regular nonstick pan and it was so easy! No harder than making a pancake. These crepes are absolutely awesome and Im glad I tried this even though I thought I wouldnt be able to do it. :) The only change I made was to add some vanilla to the batter, and I served them with a lightly sweetened cream cheese mixture and a choice of peaches, pineapple, and orange marmalade. YUMMY!

I have tried SO many times to create crepes-these are the BEST.  Just spray the pan between crepes and on a medium heat let the first side cook until you can lift the edges to flip it.  I added a 1/2 t of mexican vanilla to the mix, sliced up strawberries, whipped cream and rolled them up dusted with powdered sugar. Delicious!

Great recipe! I made them for mother's day and they turned out nice and light. The ingredients were just the right. To make the consistency of the batter better I started beating the eggs and while doing that i added the milk and then the flour and other ingredients. In order to avoid lumps its good to sift the flour. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the first time I've made crepes and this recipe was super easy! 
The only thing I did different was give the batter a whirl in the blender (my batter was lumpy).

We drizzled ours with strawberry sauce, melted chocolate and whipped cream. Yummy!

This was incredible!  I had always wanted to make crepes but was a little intimidated because they looked like it would be hard.  With this recipe it was so easy!  I took the reviewers suggestion and mixed my wet ingredients first and then sifted and whisked the dry ingredients in.  Fabulous!

A bit too eggy for my taste, and I prefer a crispier crepe. The butter chunked up on me when I mixed it with other ingredients. 

However, my guests have loved the crepes I made using this recipe. I filled it with sliced bananas, nutella, and vanilla ice cream. whipped cream optional.

I made this for the first time this morning quick before my husband left for work. Fantastically easy and very tasty.  I took frozen peaches and mangos and thawed them in the microwave and then simmered them on low with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon for about 45 minutes last night and then rewarmed the fruit in the microwave this morning.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and these crepes were amazing! I made them for myself today, but will be treating my husband tomorrow morning. :) These are too good to keep to myself! Thank you.

mmm these were yummy. I messed up on the first batter because I added all the ingredients at once and it was super lumpy. I suggest mixing all the ingredients together except the flour first. When its well combined then add the flour. This recipe didn't say to flip the crepe but I had to b/c I couldn't spread by batter thin enough and it wasn't cooking all the way through and was burning on one side. When the crepe could move in the skillet without the spatula I knew it was okay to lift and flip. Once flipped I spread some nutella evenly and added a mixture of berries and folded the crepe over. To finish it off I placed the crepe on a plate and topped it with some whipped cream. Delicious!!!! (If you wanted to add some powder sugar and/or a drizzle of chocolate would be good too.)

These crepes were sooo delicious! I did add vanilla for extra flavor, and I think it really helped. For the filling, (or glaze) I used what I had; sweetened condensed milk with 1 teaspoon of vanilla, I microwaved that for 10 seconds and drizzled it on top. Then I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top. This recipe is definately a keeper.

Delicious! I cooked them on medium low and gave the pan a quick wipe between crepes to keep them light in color.  I added a dash of vanilla to the batter and sprinkled them with powdered sugar after they were cooked. Served with a variety of fillings (nutella, maple syrup, bananas, sausage, etc...).  Yum.

Thanks for posting this.  It made me want to get up and make some crepes though I  haven't made them in many years.  I loved the light, fluffy texture.  After making them, I melted butter, added cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar.  Once melted and bubbly, I added sliced bananas and cooked until they were warm.  Several scoops go in the crepes, fold over and spoon some on the top with a sprinkle of powder sugar.  If I  had walnuts and whipped cream, I would have used them.  I surprised my husband of 8 years with them after dinner.  He wanted to know why I had been holding out on him and that I need to make these tomorrow night and the next and the next. :)

I have made this recipe for 400 people every year palm sunday for 4 years. I layer the crepes with wax paper and freeze in quart size bags up to 2 months in advance.(my kids can attest that they taste good well beyond that as well). Sometimes I add vanilla or cinamon depending on what my filling will be.  Try a splash of lemon juice instead of salt.

I really liked this crepe recipe because of it's consistency. It was easier to "spread" on the pan than other recipes I've used and it provides a larger batch which is great for me because I often go without any (after everyone wants seconds). I like my other recipes very much but this might be the one I do more often.

This is a great basic recipe for crepes. I also added a little vanila to the mixing. For the filling I added bananas: I cut the bananas in halves with some butter and cinnamon sugar and sauteed everything in a pan. I melted some chocolate (semi sweet chocolate chips melted in the microwave) and added some whip cream as well. Simply delicious! Guests enjoyed!

I hadn't made crepes in years, and couldn't find my original recipe so of course I turned to allrecipes.com. These crepes turned out fantastic!  I made the recipe but with a few changes.  I used cake flour, as i didnt have any all purpose flour on hand, added vanilla extract, and also ran it through a fine mesh strainer to make sure there we no lumps.  I cooked them in a non-stick frying pan, with a touch of pam on low heat and they turned out wonderfully.   I made a strawberry filling using some fresh berries and lemon, and topped them off with whipped cream.  My son loved them and they have now replaced his cinnamon waffles.

So easy, even I can do it. I see why it's best to let the batter sit. The batter forms more evenly in the pan.

Easy and delicious.  Some of the best crepes I've ever made.  It's easy to halve or double, and easy to alter to your liking, i.e. less sugar for savory crepes, addition of vanilla for more dessert like, etc.

I had tried to make crepes before and they turned out awful so I wasn't sure about trying again. This recipe was SO easy and yummy. I made it in the blender as someone else suggested and also added vanilla and cinnamon. The very first crepe I cooked got broken when I tried to flip it too soon, but the rest came out beautifully. I have made them twice now - once filled with Nutella and topped with strawberries and whipped cream, and once filled with vanilla yogurt and topped with stawberries and bananas. They were a hit both times and I will surely make these again and again.

Really good!  I made 1/2 the recipe and added  a tablespoon (+or-)of triple sec.  Gave a nice clean flavor.  Several years ago, our French exchange student had made crepes for us and her recipe called for rum.  I filled these crepes with a mixture of 1 can cherry pie filling and 1 bag of frozen mixed berries.  Couldn't get much easier!  I  will be making these again soon.  Thank You, Ann!

These were definitely yummy! After reading some reviews, I added some ground cinnamon and a tiny bit of vanilla extract to the batter. Cooking them on the skillet was the hardest part, but after the first one I got the hang of it. You need to pour the batter and be ready to lean the skillet around to its sides at the same time in order to evenly coat it. I loved how quick they were! I filled mine with fresh cut strawberries and a pinch of sugar. I don't generally cook, and when my boyfriend came home from lunch he was pleasently surprised :) This makes way more than 8, I frooze the left overs.

wow.  those were good!  i too added a splash of vanilla, everything's better with vanilla, right?  i just put a little chocolate syrup on one side and folded them into quarters.  i really appreciated the measurement of "3 tablespoons" for how much to put into the pan for each crepe, other recipes i've used for crepes kind of leave you guessing on that.  thanks ann!

Delicious and so easy!  I folded fresh fruit and honey into the crepes, drizzled with chocolate syrup on top - fantastic!

Pretty good crepes. I added a teaspoon of Hazelnut Flavouring to the batter and made a mixed berry fruit filling. They rolled up nice and I topped with whipped cream.

Our serving size was scaled to 2.  Good homemade crepes, and they'd probably improve even more the second time we made them! :) We had them with strawberries and whipped cream, and that complimented the salty butter nicely. A very good recipe!

Delicious!  Made more than I thought. We like them spread with jam or Nutella while they're still warm.  Then roll up, sprinkle with powdered sugar and devour!

this is wonderful! We make these almost every weekend and I follow the directions exactly. Sometimes when I remember, I'll add vanilla, but it is not necessary!  We love to use fresh raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and I use a cream cheese/powdered sugar mix for the filling.  You can make these thinner and it isn't as eggy, but I actually prefer thicker crepes because the taste of the actual crepe really comes through! My family thinks these are restaurant quality and have never met anyone that disliked them!

Very nice crepes!   I used 1/2 of a warm 8 Oz  cream cheese and mixed it with 1/2 c vanilla yogurt for filling.   Also cut bananas and strawberries in the crepe.  Topped with more strawberries,  blueberries and raspberries.   For sauce cut up strawberries in a boiler add a small amount of water and smash them.    Then added strawberry rhubarb jelly into that.   Top with redi whip, the sauce and fruit.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! I tried another recipe previously and the results were disastrous! I took other users advice and poured from the outside, as well as adding vanilla extract. I filled my crepes with cream cheese and bananas and drizzled with pancake syrup. It was perfect! Culinary even!!

I made crepes for my first time and I made 10 servings..... (My family is BIG) and we ALL loved it! Fast, easy, and yummy, we served these delicious crepes with Nutella, bananas, fresh strawberry sauce, lemon juice, sugar, cake and ice cream in a "buffet" line.... DELICIOUS!!!! Had a great time making these. DEFINITELY will be making these again. PERIOD. :D (did I also tell you my family and I don't like sweets, yet we loved these!)

I read in a 'gourmet' article about crepes,their recipe was right on with this one, their article said that once all of the ingredients are blended - in a blender - to let them rest for an hour, chilled. That allows the protien to break down and the flour to obsorb the air. Also to continually mix while making. Also said that you can make these up to 5 days ahead and they can be froze up to 2 months. Put freezer paper in between layers and allow to thaw in refridgerator 1 day prior to using. I can't wait to make this recipe! I am adding 2 tsp. vanilla

These were a hit tonight. My husband and kids gobbled them up as soon as them came out of the frying pan. The kids ate them with nutella and marshmallow fluff (separately); my husband had them with Eierliquor (German egg liquor) and I had them with butter and sugar. Will definitely make them again.

Great crepes! They are a little thicker than I have had before, so it had a little bit of a pancake texture. I also added a little bit of vanilla. I filled mine with melted chocolate, Cool Whip and bananas. MMM!

These crepes were perfect!  I made them tonight, the only modification I made was to add brown sugar (in addition to an equal amount of white sugar) as a previous reviewer recommended.  So easy and delicious.  Served with an assortment of jams, fresh strawberries  and a pumpkin pie mouse.  Ala mode, of course!

These are a solid 4 stars.  Exactly what I was looking for and not too complicated to make.  I added some Cinnamon, maybe a teaspoon or two, plus about 2/3rd teaspoon of vanilla extract - gave it some flavor.  Filled the crepes with some fruit and spooned a light sauce over top - my wife thought she was at IHOP!

Filled with a little cream cheese filling and topped with blueberry sauce. Very yummy, and I found them easy to make in an 8" non-stick skillet.

Tastes great but when I made these the crepes turned out with a eggy smell. It was not overwhelming but it made the eating not as pleasant. I guess I would try reducing the egg, I'm not sure how to rid of that eggy smell. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent flavor, but without using a blender or mixer, the batter turns out lumpy.  The recipe should state this.  (unless I somehow did something wrong).  Regardless, the kids loved them and I will put in my recipe box.  Next time I'll use my mixer/blender.  Stuffed with leftover fruit salad and vanilla yogurt.  Topped with homeade blackberry syrup.

OMG!! Just the best crepes I've ever tasted! and even better, made by me! :) I read a couple of the other reviews and added a pinch of vanilla and cinammon... delicious!!
Also don't forget the cream cheese filling! (unlike me who had to return to the store to get CC)
I used the recipe by user: Lakshmi, yields 10 servings - except I'm not a veggan so I used real milk and a bit of whip cream!
"Ingredients
1 (8 ounce) container vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti™)
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons coconut milk
Directions
1.Combine the cream cheese substitute, sugar, vanilla extract, and coconut milk with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. " yum!!
Thank you for sharing!!

VERY easy! I added a dash of vanilla flavoring since I was using a sweet filling.  I wouldn't do that if I was using a savory filling.  They cooked up perfectly. Will definitely make again!

Everyone in my bridge club loved this recipe.  I made the crepes in advance and kept them in the refrigerator (on a plate, in layers, with wax paper between each crepe and then wrapped the stack with saran wrap to keep them fresh).  Then, a couple hours before my guests arrived, I put the crepes together and returned them to the fridge until ready to serve.  This recipe made thin, round, sturdy crepes that were perfect.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

OMG, I never write reviews but these were so good and so easy that I just had to write.  I was skeptical because they were so easy.  I put cherry preserves and cream cheese in mine with some whipped cream on top...frightfully good!

Great recipe. Very, very tastey. One thing I found is that you almost have to beat it with an electric mixer otherwise the batter doesnt turn out as nice.

I love this recipe. We received a crepe pan for our wedding in October and I have been nervous about using it until now. I usually have a hard time making pancakes so I expected these to turn out poorly. It is an easy recipe to follow and tasty. I filled ours with Nutella and bananas, the way I learned to love crepes in France, and they were wonderful. Thank you!!

Delicious!  Made the batter the night before and kept in refrigerator til morning.  Just a quick stir and it was ready to go.  A non-stick pan is a must!  Was just enough for my family of 5.  Filled with Nutella and cherry pie filling and cool whip.

This is by far the best crepe recipe I have ever tried. The butter in the recipe helps the crepes from sticking and makes it so you don't need cooking spray. We had savory crepes with swiss cheese, turkey, and black pepper for dinner and banana with nutella for dessert. So good!!!

Excellent recipe...thanks!  I used a flat non-stick griddle and ladled out the batter...very easy to turn after 1 1/2 min at 230 degrees.  Spread Nutella inside with crushed almonds and roll up. drizzle with more Nutella and top with Whipped Cream.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sprinkle with more crushed almonds and few shakes of coacoa!

I doubled the recipe. Added only 1.5 tbsp of butter for each recipe. Also added 1 tsp vanilla for each recipe. I let the batter at room temperature for 1 hour.  Made over 21 pancakes. Delicious. I froze some by putting parchment paper between each crepe and when I was ready to serve the frozen ones, I just put in the microwave for a few seconds and voila. Perfect with any fruit.  Thanks for this recipe... it's definitely a 5 star recipe.

First time Creper! Followed the recipe AND the suggestions of adding 2 Tsp of vanilla and mixing all the ingredients in my blender until the mixture was well blended and smooth, then I stuck it in the Refrigerator (at the suggestion of others who reviewed) while it was in the refrigerator I prepared what I was going to put in my crepe (raspberries, cream cheese, and powdered sugar). Next I turned my stove setting on 3; I did use butter to grease my pan and started on my first crepe.  I let it cook so it looked to be just about done then flipped and only cooked it for a few seconds on the other side and ta-da, it was a crepe.  My husband was impressed! Try this is works and taste yummy!

This was exactly what I was looking for when I was making blintzes for Father's Day.  The crepes were perfectly eggy and a great consistency.  I will make these over and over.  I came up with my own blintz filling that went perfectly with these.  I just used a mixture of ricotta, confectioners sugar and vanilla and topped it with strawberries and blueberries.  Super easy and yummy.

This is the best crepe recipe I have made.  So easy and no fail.  I made the recipe and added 1t vanilla and 1t of cinnamon.   I purchased fried apples at Cracker Barrel and chopped them up in smaller pieces.  The apples were my filling.  I garnished with a dollup of Graeter's ice cream and poured the warm left off apple sauce from the Cracker Barrel Apples on top.  Delicious!

Fantastic and easy!  A bit time intensive - only because I had only one suitable pan so could only make one crepe at a time.  But the prep and actual cooking was a breeze, and this was my first time making crepes.  The hard-to-please children loved them too!

Both my bf and I use this recipe fairly often, and we both love it. It's not too "eggy" and they are really easy to make. They also freeze like a dream and reheat nicely. I like mine with fresh fruit, my bf likes his with an egg filling and it is delicious both ways! Perfect for sharing on a Sunday morning.

The whole family loves these crepes. For a meal, I fill the crepes with two slices lunch meat and cheesy scrambled eggs. For one dessert, I fill the crepes with nutella and bananas. For another dessert option, I spread some nutella down the center, then a mixture of cream cheese, whipping cream and vanilla spread over the nutella and then chopped up strawberries and bananas. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

I made the recipe as is and it was delicious. First 2 crepes were throw-away (in my mouth) but the rest were beautiful. I filled them with a brown sugar, sour cream combo and topped with warmed canned cherry pie filling. The second day I filled with a cream cheese, powdered sugar, sour cream filling and topped with fresh strawberry puree. They were a hit. I stored them with wax paper in-between each crepe and put in a ziplock bag. Pop in microwave for a few seconds and they are like fresh.

I saved this recipe after my fiancee had crepes at a local restaurant and suggested I should try making them. They are a hit! I follow the recipe as written with awesome results every time. They have now replaced bacon and eggs as a Saturday breakfast staple in our house. I have served them for friends that stay over and they are always impressed. I highly recommend this recipe, nothing needs to be changed- you wont be disappointed!

Surprisingly strong for something so thin. I tried filling with Nutella and bananas (must have gone overboard, because my husband who loves Nutella told me half that amount would have been fine); also tried a strawberry coulis I made with frozen sliced strawberries, sugar, water and cornstarch; lastly tried Ghiradelli chocolate chips (my favorite). Sprinkled with powdered sugar or topped with Cool Whip. Husband was happy. It was great to have something different for weekend breakfasts. Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is great. The real deal. Fluffy, lightly sweet, and perfect.  I add a little vanilla to mine because I use vanilla every chance I get. I have experimented quite a bit with crepe fillings and my favorite breakfast crepe has creamy peanut butter, vanilla yogurt, and diced peaches. Try it, kids love it too.

I see that alot of reviewers have a difficult time to judge when to turn over their crepe... I wait until the top is dry bubbly looking... not shiney, then you can turn them over, even flip, if you use a non-stick!  Try it it's fun!

Very good recipe. I added a little more sugar and 1/3 water to thin them some more. I found it worked best on low-medium heat and you should use a lot of butter, or if using cooking spray a quick respray after every crepe.. maybe my pan was just  not having a good nonstick day though. The first few crepes are always terrible looking, but after getting the hang of it they turn out fine :) 3 tablespoons of batter isn't enough though, I suppose it depends on the size of your pan. I use around 1/4 batter of what would cover the pan and swirl it, when I was working at a crepe hut we had these FANTASTIC things.. like frying pans but without edges that you could just lie the crepe on and then with this stick thing we sortof, smoothed them around so they made circles. It's hard to describe because I can't remember the proper crepe terminology.. I would let the batter sit for an hour or so (it ends up working better) definitely if you are using regular flour, if you are using gluten free flour there is no need.. and with crepes, the thinner the better. At the very least, the edges should look like lace. EDIT: AMAZING if left overnight and had cold for breakfast, mmm!

Since this recipe has received such great reviews, I expected a lot.  I was really unimpressed.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter was difficult to work with.  I tried lightly spraying my non-stick pan, but the batter stuck badly.  To get them to work, I had to spray the pan A LOT.  The batter was also too thick to make authentic crepes, so I added some water to thin it out a bit.  As other people have said, these also tasted too eggy.

This recipes has turned us into crepe addicts. I made a large batch, layered them with wax paper, then threw them in the fridge. We ate them for a couple of days with everything from eggs floretine to whip cream and berries. These suckers are as good as the ones we had in France!

I found that these were very greasy. Maybe it should be two teaspoons of butter instead of two tablespoons. Looked at other reviews though and none seemed to suggest that. But they tasted just fine with a sweetened fresh berry mixture and some whip cream. Would make again but try it with less butter.

This was a good recipe, but my crepes turned out pretty spongy. However, I have never had crepes before, so maybe that's what they are supposed to be like, or maybe it was my technique. Overall, the taste was good. I made a chocolate filling and spread it on the crepes and then added some bananas. Yum!

I was making crepes for Valentines brunch and I couldn't find my regular recipe.. logged in here to find this one. Turned out perfect! Great batter.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and substituted Splenda for sugar. Added a spash of real vanilla, and per some of the other suggestions used a little more flour than the recipe called for. Oh, and I did run the mixture through the blender which helped make it extra smooth.  Made two types of fillings: First one (photo) was feta, spinach and cherry tomatoes. The seconds one was nutella and bananas with a touch of honey.  Yum! Will use this one again for sure!

This recipe is a keeper! I've been making crepes as long as I can remember. My mother used to make them for me as a child and I had to learn how to make them for my family. This recipe reminds me of my childhood. My husband (who claims he doesn't like sweets) loves these crepes.  To finish these off I spread blackberry jam and use real whipping cream on top. They are also tasty when filled with the blintz mixture. Delicious! and DANGEROUS :)

We are hosting a French exchange student and wanted to make crepes, but couldn't decipher his mother's recipe due to French ingredients, so we tried this one.  It was great!  Our French student said they tasted almost exactly like his mother's (which take hours to make!).  These are super easy once you get the hang of it (timing, flipping).

So good! I halved the recipe to feed four people for a raclette and we all got at least four! Used Nutella, jam, sugar and lemon, and brown sugar as toppings - and all were great! This is a keeper!

Free cream cheese and Fat-Free whipped topping together and filled the crepes, added bananas and strawberries. Kids loved them!

Very quick and easy recipe. The sugar added just the right amount of sweetness to complement whatever filling you use. I filled them with dulce de leche (from another Allrecipe's recipe), and/or fresh blackberries/strawberries. They came out great! Thanks!

Truly SHOCKED by how well these came out.  I saw the positive reviews but since I am an inexperienced cook (with very bad past experiences with crepes), I assumed I would find a way to mess them up.  Despite the fact that I used too much butter, they still turned out almost perfect! (I recommend Nutella, mmmmmm)

I love these crepes! Easy to make and relatively healthy! I made no changes to the batter except I used bread flour instead of AP flour since I had none on hand. I stuffed the crepes with bananas cooked in butter, brown sugar and peanut butter. It was a hit! Thanks so much.

These came out delicious!!  I was nervous because after I started mixing the ingredients, I realized I ran out of flour and used whole wheat flour instead.  What a great mistake that was!   They tasted exactly (maybe even better) than a local crepe shop in the area.  Thank you!!

Very easy! I filled these with a small amount of warm jam, rolled and topped them with powdered sugar and whipped cream. My boys LOVED them. 
I used medium heat (about 5 on my stove)and turned them when the edges just started to turn brown. Even my first one turned out perfect!

I've made crepes for the past 10+ years, but after moving couldn't find my old recipe. I tried this one and was very happy with the results! I doubled it (if I'm going to go through the effort, I want a lot!) and it doubled well- and the 8 eggs made the batter very rich. Delicious! Next time I won't double the butter, because it seemed to be a little too much for the recipe. Overall, I recommend and will be using this as my primary recipe for dessert crepes!

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I founds the instructions easy to follow and was intrigued by adding lemon before dusting with powdered sugar. Adding a little fresh lemon juice really helped balance the flavor and worked well with the sweet powdered sugar. I never heard of adding lemon to egg dishes like this, but I have to admit I'm learning to cook instead of eating pre-made foods. I personally think that this recipe is a great option to feed 2 people who have a healthy appetite. There's really no need to prepare other items for your breakfast or brunch. These crepes are delicious by themselves! Also, I look forward to adding fresh fruit and possibly whipped cream in the future. For guys like me who are just discovering the world of cooking, I recommend extra attention while preparing this dish. Although I found it easy to prepare, it certainly is possible to put too much mixture in the pan resulting In a thick rubbery disk. Getting the correct amount of crepe mix in the pan and knowing the perfect time to flip while cooking is probably the most challenging aspect of this dish. With that said, I found it easy to prepare and delicious. I'm excited to have a tasty recipe like this to make for breakfast. Another member said they prepared the mixture the night before to save time the next morning. I will definitely try this technique. Definitely make sure the batter is mixed silky smooth before cooking. I had a few lumps and will know to mix better next time. :-)

For the sauce, I let about 1/8 of a cup of water simmer then add raspberries, sugar, and blueberries. I cooked them until the raspberries were liquid and was very careful not to burst any blueberries.

I usually just wing the recipe on my own but decided to stick to this one exactly and they were AMAZING.  The texture was perfect. I stuffed mine with homemade whip cream and some fresh diced strawberries topped with a little bit of chocolate syrup. I also added a dash of vanilla to the crepes batter.  Huge hit!!

I bought a new crepe pan and couldnt wait to make them as a surprise. I halved the recipe and it still made six crepes for my husband and I. Four of which, I sprinkled with sugar after flipping and again after folding, as I remember when last in Paris. I also put a good dollap of Nutella on two after flipping before folding for hubby. Unfortunately, this recipe tastes too much of egg, which could pass if making savory crepes, but not traditional French sweet crepes. Sorry. I'll try some other recipes.

Amazing crepes. Same as the kind my Ukrainian grandma used to make. The only change I made was to add some vanilla extract. I serve with fruit preserves. You can also top with some grand marnier liqueur and flambé it.

YUM!! I made these tonight. I served them with a single swipe-of-the-knife of some homemade blueberry jam, rolled them up, sprinkled with a small amount of powdered sugar. So simple, yet so decadent.

Absolutely delicious! Really good when eaten with berries and whipped creme. Fits the 5-star rating wonderfully. At first, I thought they would be too eggy, but they were amazing! Definitely recommend this.

I make this for breakfast and my son LOVES it! I put nutella in his and 'marron' French chestnut spread in mine. There is always enough to heat up for the next day. Simple, quick, and delicious way to start the day. And my boy brags about how his mother cooks crepes!

EASIER: Combine in BLENDER = faster and takes care of lumps.  Pour batter directly from blender into no-stick sprayed pan  (instead of brushing w/ oil).  Re-spray every few crepes.  Batter performs a little better if you let stand or refrigerate 5-10 min. before cooking (use this time to set your table or prepare your fruit, so you can serve crepes warm). Tortilla warmer also helps to keep crepes warm while cooking the rest. If you have a cooking buddy, 2 pans going at same time goes faster and is more fun. :)

Great!  I used a very small amount of olive oil which helped on the "stick" issue, even though my pan is non-stick.  Also did the lowest setting on my burner which was just right.  Spread a little Nutella inside the crepe and topped with home-grown raspberries and powdered sugar.  Amazing and quite easy!

This was an excellent recipe for a first time crepe maker! I followed it to the letter and it came out perfectly and exactly how I remember my french teacher making them for me in the 7th grade :-). I will definitely invest in getting a real crepe maker or pan as I did find some challenges with my frying pan, but they still came out awesome. The only thing I would say is you need to adjust the heat and cooking time according to your own stove settings, as the medium heat and 1-2 minute cooking time definitely didn't work for my stove. Other than that, this is truly a perfect crepe recipe. Good job!

Wonderful recipe!  Our family raved and wanted seconds!   As one reviewer suggested,  let the batter sit at room temperature for about an hour. Great idea!  I doubled the recipe, and every single crepe was perfect!   I used Pam cooking spray only for the first crepe.  If you have a good unscatched fry pan, you'll have success!  I used a small ladle to scoop the batter in the pan.  The batter will be thin.  That creates a nice thin delicate crepe.  After pouring the batter in, pick the pan up and swirl the batter around.  Use medium high heat.  The edges will start to turn a light brown.   Stay next to the stove....do a few exercises in between each crepe!  These cook fast!  30 seconds on the first side and approx. 20 on the next side.  I used a hand mixer to blend all of the ingredients together.  I used 7 eggs when I doubled the recipe because they were extra large.  Did not use vanilla, as some reviewers suggested.  The flavor is already perfect!  Omit the sugar if making these for a main dish crepe.  I filled the inside with vanilla pudding, rolled the crepe, zig zagged a string of chocolate across the plate, put a  spoonful of raspberries then a dollop of whipping cream and for the final touch....sprinkle some powdered sugar!  It was a huge crowd pleaser!  I even transported all the ready made ingrdients in separate containers, including the crepes, and they did not stick together!  Warmed in oven for a few minutes.....toppings....PERFECT!!!!!

These were my first crepes ever. They actually turned out pretty good! It's a good recipe for beginners, it just takes practice. If you've never made crepes, I'd suggest using this recipe. Just be careful of how much oil/butter you use on the pan. Too much will ruin them. Cook them at a low heat, and try not cook them to long. Good luck!

This was my first time making crepes and it was very easy with this recipe (although time consuming).  I followed the recipe (added 1/2 tsp vanilla to batter) and filled some crepes with nutella and strawberries and some with vanilla pudding and mixed fruit.  sprinkled with powdered sugar for a nice touch.

I decided to make strawberry crepes for valentines day to suprise my mom. I used this batter recipe and they turned out phenominal! Although, I would recommend adding a little vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. Being 15, I haven't cooked much and at first I had troubles with flipping the crepe over, so since it was valentines day I found a metal heart shaped cookie cutter and poured the batter into that. Since it made the crepe smaller it was much easier to flip, and it was even more festive! Then I just added whipped cream and strawberries and they were delicous! I will definitely use this recipe again the next time i make crepes!

These are worth 5 stars and more.  Very easy!!!  I made them for my Belgian husband and his son, and they loved them.  Thanks Ann57

BTW:  Mix all the dry ingredents first then add to the wet ingredents.  Make sure you melt the butter well or you will get lumps of butter in your batter and add last.

These are fabulous!!!  I make these to go with my homemade lemon curd.  My husband loves them so much I make them every other weekend and he eats on them throughout the week.

Everyone who has tried these loves them and I get requests for these when company comes to town!  

I don't change anything in the recipe.  I use my immersion blender for a lump free mix.  Let it set up in the fridge at least 30 minutes.  

I made a gluten-free version for my daughter -- substituting "Mama's Gluten Free Almond Flour" cup for cup with regular flour.  
They turned out just as light and fluffy as the original.  The almond flour gave a little extra hint of flavor!  

(G-Free version is a bit tough reheated the next day)

I use this recipe all the time.  My girls, 8 and 10 love them.   I put all the ingredients in a blender and blend to make this a fast morning breakfast with Nutella (or peanut butter) in the middle.   I reduce the sugar to 1 tbs. since we fill the middle with something sweet.

Great texture, the batter had more eggs than I usually use. I also melted white chocolate chips (.25c) in the place of sugar. nice recipe!

Amazing recipe! I made them a little bit thicker because I like to be able to taste the batter and they were delicious. Served with whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries.

Never made crepes before and I was surprised at how easy it was! They turned out perfectly and if the outside edges are a little thinner than the middle, they get this great flaky edge that melts in your mouth... amazing! Didn't change a thing in this recipe except added a tad of vanilla extract. Yum!

Yumm, kids couldn't get enough!!

This was great and super easy!  Cook them low and you're good to go.  I put sliced apples, cream cheese and cinnamon in them.  They practically put a tear in my eye :) It reminded me of when I was little and my Dad would make me delicious Crepes. Can't go wrong serving these.  People will feel loved.

This recipe came out perfect and i was surprised at just how easy crepes can be to make. i was so scared of them and never made any before, however, mine came out perfectly. And also, they tasted GREAT. My recent crepe obsession came from going to a crepe restaurant the other day and this recipe tastes exactly like the ones i had at the restaurant. I am so happy to have found this recipe. Thanks so much! i cant wait to keep experiencing the wonderful crepe. :)

Awesomely good! I used my Pristiq non-stick skillet. If you have one, definitely use it. You can make huge crepes with it just by putting the batter in the middle and turning the whole skillet by the handles in a circular motion to spread it out. My husband was a little worried, but than he admitted it was a great idea and worked out well. Love this recipe Ann!

This recipe is perfect as is.  I had no need to change any ingredients, and it was delicious!  I used cooking spray for the pan and a blender to mix because I was having a hard time getting the batter to be smooth.  Try those tricks if you have trouble.    I put Nutella in the crepes and topped them with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  Delicious!

Perfect recipe, easy.  Don't use a lot of batter, the goal is thin, light crepes.  I filled mine with fresh strawberries and blueberries, put a small amount of real maple syrup and powdered sugar on top.  My son ate five!

I'm NOT a cook. But I followed the directions & everyone loved them!!!  My friend told me how to make a blueberry filling... very easy.  It would be nice to include filling options.  I made a blueberry filling (sauteed blueberries & brown sugar, then added some cornstarch mixed with water), a strawberry filling (sliced strawberries & just sprinkled some brown sugar on top) and had Nutella to go with the strawberries... YUM

Wonderful and easy too! I did a little research on crepes and found out that if you want them to be easy you HAVE to let the batter sit at least an hour... and pick a pan that the batter and spread out THINLY in to the edges. That said-- these were very yummy! This is my favorite crepe recipe. I use them for breakfast thought too... not just dessert!

Wow! So delish! This was my second time ever making crepes and this recipe is far far better than the other one I had. I used the blender to make mine. It is easy that way to pour straight into your pan. I got more than 8 crepes out of the recipe...more like 10-12. I set up a 'crepe bar' with ice cream, nutella, strawberries, bananas, redi whip. It was so much fun making them and devouring them. I like them so much more than pancakes. Enjoy!

good, but I felt the need to add an extra 2 TBSP of flour b/c the mix looked awfully runny, and also added pure vanilla extract.  I made BANANAS FOSTER (melted butter with brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon and a generous splash of rum, added banana quarters and heated until bananas were warm and just starting to get a little mushy on the edges) and added as a filling along with cream. Delish!!!!  It was probably a little too much sugar for the morning, as we ate them for breakfast, but hubby thought it tasted so good he didn't care!  Try it, it's a treat!

My first attempt...and let's just say; I rocked it! So much easier than I thought it would be, so don't be scared. Just know you'll have to sacrifice one or two to the cause (just eat those while you finish the rest and no one will know!). My batch made exactly 8 crepes. I filled mine with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and chocolate sauce but I can't wait to fill them with breakfast goodies tomorrow. As others have stated, these are a little eggy tasting. I wouldn't use these for dinner crepes, but I can't wait to try other recipes now that I know I can make them! Idea: make these for a party, make a bunch of crepes then have all kinds of fillings and let people make their own! How fun would that be?

These were fantastic and held their shape well. I filled mine with Nutella, bananas,strawberries and topped with fresh wipped cream. Just as good if not better than crepes I have had in Greece.

These were easy and great.  I added a hint of vanilla extract for additional flavor. Also, melt the butter before mixing it in so it wouldn't be in lumps.  After the crepes are made, I added sliced bananas, nuttela and vanilla ice cream. They are superb!

The Crepes turned out just great, but in the future I will use less egg. The batter was thicker than I am used to and the taste of eggs was to strong. I definately will use this recipe as base again.

Thanks for such a wonderful recipe and also to those suggesting the addition of some vanilla.  This will now be my standard dessert crepe recipe.  A quick shot of Pam between crepes made them easy to swirl to cover the pan and to flip.  We had a few friends over last night and I made a dessert crepe buffet.  I set out a plate of crepes with parchment paper in between them.  Around the table I set out bowls of chopped strawberries, a quick and easy-to-make blueberry sauce, spiced apples (just sauteed chopped apples, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg), sliced bananas, a jar of Nutella, a bowl of ricotta cheese that I'd added some vanilla and icing sugar to, a small ramekin of toasted walnut pieces, another with powdered sugar, a bottle of caramel drizzle and a bowl of whipped cream.  Everyone made up their crepe as they liked.  Great for people watching calories because the option is there to simply have a fruit crepe, but it's hard to resist whipped cream.  I made extra crepes and froze them in Ziploc bags so we'll have crepes on hand for future desserts/breakfasts. Thanks again for a keeper!

I've never made crepes before, but I used to buy dessert crepes sometimes when I was in Japan filled with fruit and whipped cream. They were really good so I wanted to try them out myself! This recipe is really simple and delicious. Like some other users have suggested, I added some vanilla too. Definitely a keeper.

For my best friend's bridal shower I chose a theme "Parisian Cafe" and I used this recipe for the crepes I made as appetizers. I used this recipe in combination with the recipe "Creamy Strawberry Crepes" also from allrecipes. Everyone LOVED them. One person even told me that these crepes were better than some that she had at her favorite restaurante :)

This recipe deserves its 5 stars rating.  It's simply perfect and oh-so-easy to make!  Texture, taste, and consistency all just like you get at the best French bistros.  Thank you for sharing it!

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  Like the reviews I read, I added one teaspoon of vanilla and some dashes of cinnamon and it was so yummy!

Best crepes recipe I have ever tried.  They turn out amazing every time whether I am making a single batch for breakfast or I have been coerced into making a triple batch for friends.

These were good. You have to eat them when they're hot, though. After about an hour being at room temp. they tasted kind of eggy. But overall, not bad.

This was the BEST crepe recipe I've used (and I've used a lot).  My crepes came out looking like a professional made them.  I did add one tsp. of Vanilla Extract though, and it was delicious.

I too thought this was a great recipe. I did add and extra TBLS sugar (half brown/half white).  I also blended it in the blender.  I even used it the next day and it was still great.  Very easy and fabulous!

I've made these a number of times now, and this is a truly wonderful recipie. I do however like to add a tsp or two of vanilla, it makes them taste even better! Also, usually I add a few extra tbsp of flour to my batter just so that it's that slight bit smoother and it's easier to swirl around the pan. For those of you who had difficulties flipping or turning them... first fold up a paper towel, put a little butter on it and then gently swipe it all over the pan. then, use a rubber spatula to nudge down the edges. when the edges of the crepe are golden brown and you can easily tap them off the pan with a rubber spatula, you're ready to flip them!  try serving them filled with strawberries, bananas and freshly whipped cream for breakfast :)

These are AWESOME! I suggest though to blend in the blender for no lumps. I whisked it all first and then (probably because I didn't sift my flour) there were some little lumps so I poured it all in to the blender for a few seconds and then made them. They are perfect as the recipe states. Thanks!

I made these and had never made crepes before--they were incredibly easy to make! I filled them with a cream cheese filling and mixed berries, then topped them with whipped topping and a little bit of the mixed berries. Everyone enjoyed them as a brunch meal.

These turned out perfect without any adjustment to the recipe.  We served them as "Dessert Crepes Bar" with various filling options, such as fresh strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, peaches, whipped topping, chocolate, etc.

I'm a novice cook, and was worried about making something like this, but it was super easy - they don't even stick to themselves when you try to flip them over!

I was amazed at out these turned out!! This is the first time I've made crepes and I didn't think that they'd be so perfect! I also added some cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as other reviewers suggested. I didn't have much of a problem with flipping them like some other reviewers, for some reason. It might be the amount I of batter I used. I put whipped cream and blueberries on the inside, and confectioners sugar and syrup on the outside. They turned out light and delicious!

This makes a perfect crepe recipe, and PLENTY for a 4 person family.  We like to try all different stuff in it...like bananas and nutelly with whipping cream, honey, jams, etc. Just a fun and delicious treat for breakfast.  My kids love them.  I sometimes add vanilla to the mix if we are doing sweet toppings.

I made them for breakfast for my family, and everyone enjoyed them. I added 1/2tsp Vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon like other people suggested and they were delicious. Only complaint was that my grandpa said they were too moist, too chewy, and too thin, but that's because he thought he was eating pancakes.

This recipe is great.   My Mom used to make us "sugar" crepes.   You just sprinkle a little sugar and roll them up, terribly unhealthy but SO good.

the crepes were a bit buttery.
I suggest using less butter and
tospead the batter out on the pan
better by shifting the pan. the thinner
the crepe the less buttery.
crepes  rolled with sugar and
strawberrys,topped with wipped cream
and hot melted chocolate.YUM!!!

I've never made crepes before so it will take me some practice to find the perfect temp to cook them at, and how to manipulate them in the pan.  But they tasted great.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  My kids were eating them plain as fast I could get them out of the skillet.  Rolled up the last one with a super thin layer of grape preserves.  Yum.  Will definitely make these again, trying various fillings.  I got 10 8-inch crepes from the full recipe.

Phenomenal recipe. We make it every week. A lot of people have suggested adding vanilla; we add vanilla milk (you can get organic vanilla milk in boxes). We've also tried the vanilla, but the milk tastes much better. We set up a crepe bar on the kitchen island with different toppings; cherry/raspberry pie filling, cinammon sugar, nutella, whipped cream. We sift powdered sugar over the top. The kids love it.

Worked out great.  My husband is lactose-intolerant, so I used lactose-free skim milk and a filling make of plain Tofutti, sugar, vanilla, and coconut milk.  It made a wonderful Sunday brunch!

These were great. This recipe doesn't have to be for dessert - I had it for breakfast! I changed the servings to 4 and used a small sized skillet, and I got around 10. Yummy in the tummy! :) Also, I suggest that if you're eating these crepes for breakfast, use sour cream on the inside then roll it. It tastes great, and I do this for most of my crepes. Enjoy!

Wonderful! I did add the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer. I used an 8 inch pan that tapers at the bottom and got about 18 six inch crepes. Perfect for the dessert crepes I am making for a shower.

Great recipe! The hardest part is definitely flipping the crepe over without getting the sides bent under -- I guess that will take  practice. 

As a filling I used cream cheese and a few raspberries. I drizzled it with raspberry jelly and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream -- delicious!

It was a bit of work, but really easy. The crepes tasted pretty good. I added a bit more sugar and some vanilla to it. I also got 13 crepes instead of the 8 it said, it was nice. A keeper.

Added a splash of vanilla as others did.  They turned out great.  I have treated many friends to these crepes filled with a variety of fillings and they all enjoyed them.

My step-son has been bugging me for "skinny pancakes" that my mother-in-law would make for him. I found out from her it was just a crepe recipe that she would throw together. I tried this one and everyone seemed to like it. My husband added more vanilla. 
Thanx

The batter had lots of little lumpy for some reason - they looked like flour-y, sugar-y lumps - but when I cooked them, they turned out delicious.  No lumps to be found in the final product.  Delicious with some sugar and fresh lemon juice!

my local mall has a crepe shop with crepes starting at $4.50 a pop, with the most basic fillings... these taste just as amazing and you can let your filling ideas go wild, just modify the sugar and you can fill these with bacon, egg and cheese for a great breakfast.. or fill it with pretty much anything for that matter.. THANK YOU!! 5 stars. My family and friends just loved these.

With the first one I was discouraged but as it turned out it was because the pan wasn't hot enough. These turned out great. Spread with melted chocolate chips added strawberries and peaches with whipped cream on top. mmmm.

My first attempt at making crepes after we fell in love with them while traveling in France.  I was surprised at how easy this recipe was.  My first crepes were a bit ragged at the edges, but I quickly got the hang of it.  The batter is very forgiving.  This first time we tried them with lemon juice, sugar and blueberries inside with a small bit of whipped cream on top.  Excellent!  Thanks Ann!!!

These are pretty good.  I added some vanilla extract to make mine a little sweeter tasting.  I put bananas in mine and topped with chocolate syrup.  I probably won't make them this way again, only because I have another recipe I like better.

This has become my standard crepe recipe.  I absolutely love it and it's so simple to make.  It's wonderful for breakfast or dessert (or dinner when I'm craving easy comfort!)  I half the recipe for myself and have stuffed with fruit and yogurt, or had it with syrup.  I do add a dash of cinammon and vanilla to the batter.  Very delightful delicious crepes.

Tasted great! I added a fresh strawberry relish I made to the middle, rolled them, sprinkled powdered sugar on them & sprayed redi-whip on top.

I did find it hard to get thin crepes using a sm frying pan (because of the pan they were also harder to flip & they needed to be flipped because they weren't thin enough). 

I just ordered a crepe maker though because I liked the taste enough that I knew I could improve upon it & get perfection.

Love it! Made some for me & my son! So good! Wasn't feeling well. But success with these made my day! I have a granite nonstick pan. So great to make them! My son made a quick sweet sauce , Brown sugar ,cinnamon & butter. I also took frozen berries,sprinkled raw sugar & folded them into one!
So good! I am so glad I got this recipe!

I am 100% sure that I will make these crepes again. I would suggest that you add 1 tablespoon of sugar instead of 2, and personally I think that adding the salt is also unnecessary.

This was delicious and easy. I took a few tips from other reviewers that I plan to use again. I sifter the flour and blended all ingredients in the blender. Super smooth batter with minimal mess.

made mine simply filled with sugared cottage cheese and the kids had theirs with applesauce.   delicious.   I appreciate the comment that recommended non stick spray. this worked great in a small skillet.  I use stainless steel pans and there was no sticking.

I used this for breakfast for the family, everyone loved it! Really easy, but use LOTS of cooking oil before putting down the batter, and do this every time.

Absolutely love this recipe. It has become my go to crepe recipe. You can play around with the thickness of the crepe by the amount you pour into the pan. When I first started with this recipe, I made them thicker and then slowly thinned them out. They are more eggy than other crepe recipes but I really like it.

Never made crepes before but now this is a breakfast fav at home. I add a little vanilla extract to the batter for more flavor.
 I cut strawberries and rub them with a little sugar and let them sit overnight in the fridge for filling.
 Add a little La Lachera condensed milk with the strawberries in the crepes and there won't be any left!

Wonderful taste. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the mix. Used the batter for dessert crepes filled with Nutella, sliced strawberries, blueberries and sliced bananas.

Delicious and awesome consistency. This made about 12 crapes from a single batch. The texture was spongy without being doughy. I will definitely be making these again!

This is the best crepe recipe I’ve ever used! Make sure you add the butter or else you’ll get an odd scrambled crepe that won’t have a good flavor. Also if you don’t hear your pan completely before you start cooking, your first few crepes won’t flip well and will fall apart. I highly recommend adding vanilla or cinnamon to add flavor to sweet crepes! We usually top these with Nutella, sour cream/plain yogurt mixed with sugar, jam, powdered sugar, or lip- lap which is basically whipped cream mixed with jam (we use blackberry or strawberry). All in all, if you haven’t had or made crepes, this is the recipe to go to! It’s simple, easy, fast and delicious!!!

Just made these. Followed the recipe to a T except added gluten-free flour (king arthur brand) instead and they were still fantastic! This is the second recipe I’ve tried and it is way better than the one I did before it. The few additional ingredients including butter and sugar made a huge difference.

This recipe is wonderful! It was very simple and easy to make. I added about 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla to the crepe mix after reading the comments and it definitely makes a difference. Just make sure that you use one of your smaller skillets if you don’t have a crepe pan. I also mixed up 8 oz of cream cheese and 2 cups powered sugar and added strawberries for a filling. Then mixed 1/3 cup heavy cream with 1tablespoon powered sugar and 1 tablespoon white sugar, added a little vanilla and beat on high for several minutes for a whipped topping. They turned out delicious! I will definitely make these again!!

Super easy to make. Unlike the other recipes, this did not involve chilling overnight which i found very time-saving. The cooking part takes a little practice but other than that, there was nothing i needed to worry about.

Let me start by mentioning that I hate reading reviews where people change the recipe. However, I didn’t have enough milk to make these and my daughter requested them. I DID have chocolate milk though, and I used that instead.  OMG these were delicious.  I highly recommend the chocolate version for dessert crepes!  LOL

I loved these crepes! I love that with these skins you can list anything in them and you are free to get creative. To make them savory, I just took out the sugar in the recipe and put bacon, eggs and avocado inside. Use this recipe! You will love it!

Good basic crepe recipe.  You can juj it up however you like, with lemon butter or jam topping, or cream cheese fruit filling.  These might even make a good savory crepe, omitting the sugar and adding savory toppings.  I made exactly as stated and served with lemon butter.  I will use this recipe again.  Thanks for posting.

Definitely mix the dry ingredients with the eggs first then slowly add milk as you mix. It will help keep clumps from forming

I halved the recipe and just threw the ingredients in a blender pulsing untill mixed. I used butter to grease the pan. I poured enough batter to fill 2/3 of the pan and tilted the pan to thin out the crepe, shaping it into a perfect circle. They came out PERFECT.

Easy recipe, also easily split, was cooking for 1, so wasn't going to do the full batch. Worked just as well scaled to 2, portions, which was 3 average size crepes. They were perfect, just the right "bite", not soggy, served with sugar and fresh lemon juice. Definitely will stick to this one. I recommend using finer flour, like cake flour, if you want a smoother texture.

Turned out great!  I doubled the recipe, added 1 tbls of vanilla extract it & gave me 16 large sized crepes. This was my first time making them and they were delicious and easy. There was some lumps in the batter, so I’d recommend using a strainer.

This is a great recipe! And, I saw one of the reviews here to add 1/3 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt which I tried, and it brought the crepe to an extra level of flavor. I’d strain the batter through a sieve to remove any lumps to create for a smoother batter. I spread some Nutella and put some cut up strawberries and bananas, then a scoop of ice cream on top. My mom said it tasted amazing too, and she’s a strict critic.

Proportions seemed a little off which made them thicker and less sweet than what I’d like. I needed to add more sugar, milk, and think I could have done with less egg and butter. 

I would also suggest to add the wet ingredients very slowly to the dry ingredients so the mixture has zero clumps!

Couldn't be easier and tasted delicious (only change I would like is addition of 1 tsp vanilla, maybe a little cinnamon too). I heated a 10" non-stick skillet to medium-high temp, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to pour from the outer area instead of the center of the skillet, then tilt skillet to distribute the batter over the surface of the pan. In a minute or two, it had cooked and was easy to flip using a spatula. No cooking spray or oil was needed. With addition of butter on top and a sprinkling of confectioners sugar, these tasted kind of like carnival "elephant ears".

Made this for the first time and they were great! Put too much batter on my first try but by my 3rd try got it right to make a nice thin perfectly cooked crepe! I made the batter exactly as in the recipe. I had mine with Blueberries and a little cinnamon and Maple syrup. Yum Yum! Try it you’ll love it!

This recipe is amazing! I did add 1 extra TBSP of white sugar and since I was making sweet dessert breakfast crepes I added two cap fulls of vanilla extract also. I made a cream cheese filling with a block of cream cheese 2 cap fulls of milk  and i slowly added confectioner sugar until I developed a thickness of my liking. I used a   can of Strawberry pie filling and heated up some hot fudge ice topping and dizzled it on top with some  creamy canned whipped cream. This is by  means a light or low  calorie meal.

First time ever making crepes, this recipe was so easy and they turned out great! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla which was a nice touch. I will definitely make these again.

I made these when I had an opened bag of frozen blueberries & some spotty bananas I needed to use up after Xmas, but was all muffined out. What made these EXTRA tasty is that rather than using 4eggs, I had some egg nog I wanted to use before it'd expire- so I used only 3 and for the 1/3-1/4 Cup of the milk, I substituted the nog. They were FANTASTIC with just a little whipped cream. These were a little bit more dense than I'd have hoped(I used a mix of pastry flour and unbleached whole wheat- it's what I had), but I'm sure I can thin them out for the rest of the batch(that's right, I'm writing this mid-batch!) 
I made some compote out of the blueberries using a pkt of gelatin, stevia and appx 1/8 c organic sugar because I didn't have enough bananas for everyone- the nanas I just sliced em up, spread Nutella on one side & stuck the rounds to it, put the yogurt or whipped cream on the other side and closed it. The bananas, I feel, were more complimentary to the nutmeggy seasoning of the egg nog(think banana bread)Of course I'd added a splash of vanilla to the mix. I'm just so impressed that this recipe is so good it was able to flex to accommodate my kitchen's inventory while still being delicious.

This crêpe recipe is awesome. I head that there was general discontent on how there were too many eggs, so i used 2/3 of the recipe's recommendation and it was perfect (I made 12, so 4 eggs). Also, the list of ingredients was really convenient considering that you didn't need a lot of materials and they were really common. If the time arises where I am craving crêpes, this will definitely be my go-to recipe.  MAKE IT IT'S SO GOOD

Recipe turned out great. Crepes cooked evenly and the right texture. 

Added an apple sauce to it. By cooking slices of apple down with brown sugar, white sugar, cooking oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla extract.

This is a good, basic sweet crepe recipe.  I used a crepe maker, and if you do too,  I recommend letting the mixture sit for a bit before you start making the crepes.

I have been looking for a recipe like the crepes my mom makes and know I have found it!  The consistency of the batter (after blending) makes it easy to make thin crepes.  Remove from heat when pouring the batter in since they cook very fast.  I added vanilla and cinnamon as others have suggested.

I loved the crêpe I love the buttery taste of it and the consistency. Though I accidentally melted the butter too much so don't melt it more than 30 seconds! Overall it flipped great and tasted great!

These crepes are wonderful! I love that the batter doesn't need to set before cooking... my kids can't wait that long. We usually double the recipe so we have leftover crepes we can fill & heat quickly for a few days. The only change I make is adding a little vanilla extract (personal preference), although it doesn't need it to be 5 stars. Thanks for this delicious treat! I used to only get crepes when we went out for breakfast, but this easy recipe brings them right into my kitchen!

Having Celiac mine have to be gluten free but were very good. I try to follow recipes the 1st time we try a new one (with gluten free products of course) then tweak them if needed or just want to experiment. The only issue we had using the exact recipe (GF style) was that the batter seemed a bit thick. Which if you have ever cooked GF you know it is usually VERY thin so we were a bit surprised. We used the Cup4Cup GF flour that has the thickener already in it so we will try a bit less flour next time so see if the consistency thins out a little (SO not used to saying that). Glad we cut the recipe in half too as the 2 of us were stuffed before they were close to done. She made a white chocolate strawberry cheesecake filling for them... SOOO GOOD

I made it exactly as written, have never made crepes before, and gotta tell ya...these were so good. I used an 8" non stick skillet. The filling I used was from this site... The creamy strawberry crepes cream cheese filling (cut the powdered sugar in half based on other reviews stating it was too sweet) and put sliced, macerated strawberries inside with the filling, topped with sifted powdered sugar. So, so great. I was shocked and pleased. Try it.

Great recipe! The batter was easy to work with and tasty! I served my crepes once with whipped cream and strawberries, then I had a little leftover batter that I thinned out and simply sprinkled on cinnamon and sugar. Delicious!

Have tried various crepe recipes over the years. Some have been very good, some not so much. This is the best recipe I have come across yet. The best crepe I have had at home, hands down.

Awesome recipe! This was my first time making crepes so I just picked a random recipe and totally lucked out. Simple ingredients and simple instructions which is my kind of cooking! I decided to only use 3 eggs instead of 4 because I saw that someone thought it was too eggy. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract. They turned out perfectly!

I have tried quite a few crepe recipes before.  This is the BEST!!!  Not only is it tasty, but also makes it super-easy to make crepes in a pan for someone who's not an expert crepe maker at all!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

Easy to make though my husband thought they were a bit spongy. Perhaps I should have measured a serving spoon out and cooked each portion smaller. Overall, they were great. I'd make them again with a more scholarly approach to putting them on the cooktop. I used a lightweight griddle pan that worked fabulously.

I'm not what you might consider an "experienced" crepe taster and this was definitely my first time making crepes on purpose. These seemed pretty easy to mix and cook. The recipe seems very forgiving and cooks pretty well no matter how thin or thick you make them. They also hold together very well. The taste was pretty good. After I made 1/2 the batch, I put a few drops of almond extract in the batter just for fun...and because ai love almond extract. Even better! My husband and I ate them simply with maple syrup for brunch. Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy & very tasty crepes!  I used the filling in the "Creamy Strawberry Crepes" recipe here on allrecipes to fill them with, along with fresh, sliced strawberries.  No more need to go to IHOP for strawberry cream crepes!  :)

I have never made crepes before so I had no idea what to look for in a recipe for them. I made these as instructed and they turned out delicious! I only had one practice crepe before realizing my mistake of putting too much in the pan but the rest were great! These will definitely become a staple recipe in my house.

I love crepes cause they're so versatile...you can put anything in it, make the crepes themselves more sweet, so on and so forth. This recipe without modification fit my appetite just right, as i like it a bit sweeter. The only hard part might be in using a good pan and controlling the heat. The crepes will turn out bad if the pan sucks or you cook too fast or if batter is not runny enough!!

Made twice already. I used Puck brand cream filled cream (product of Denemark). Warning, it has high saturated fat. Also, I used my own syrup. One cup of water with two cups of sugar. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for ten minutes. Refrigerate, and served. Next time I will try the cream cheese instead.

I'm no certified Crepe maker, nor an experienced cook... However, I made these Crepes and came out looking like a mere professional! :) 

I took the advice from other reviews and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a little cinnamon to the recipe. 
I also mixed my batter and allowed it to sit at room temperature for about an hour before I began making them.
I used an 8" non-stick pan and let the batter nearly cook completely before flipping it. 
I put some fresh blackberries in a pan and let them simmer with a little sugar and filled my crepes and topped them with a big dollop of whipped cream! It was the perfect summer dessert - a little sweet - but not too heavy. I will definitely be making these in the near future.

This was my first attempt at crepes and it was so much easier than expected.  I wish I had tried them sooner.  I did make a few changes. I substituted brown sugar for the white, added about 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  They were delicious and a huge hit with my young daughters and their friends.

This recipe is excellent.  I've never made crepes before and found this recipe very easy with the help of others who made suggestions regarding preparation.  Here is what helped me.  I used my blender.  No lumps.  I used Fat free half&half.  It was all I had in the frig.  I made the batter 3 hours before using and put in the frig.  I cooked the crepes during the dinner party after the main course.  They were so yummy fresh.  They were served with vanilla ice cream, chopped strawberries, drizzled in chocolate syrup and a light sprinkling of powdered sugar.  My son added a mound of whipped cream as well.  What to improve?  Since this was my first time making crepes, I was a bit nervous about making them too thin and having them tear.  So they were a bit thicker than what a traditional crepe is but no one seemed to care!  I will make this recipe again.

Delicious. After making a test crepe I ended up adding another heaping tablespoon of flour and I also mixed it in my blender. The next ones were perfect! I filled them with greek yogurt and fresh raspberries.

They were great! But the first crepe on the pan always picks up lots of the oil so I call that one the tester crepe, after that crepe the rest turn out perfect!

Been making it for about a year. It's easy and delicious. Sometimes I add a little bit of vanilla.

I love these!  Such a treat with fresh strawberries rolled up inside and a touch of powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  
I throw all the ingredients in a blender, it mixes it up better.

Surprisingly good and easy to make. Following the advice of some of the other reviews, I added in vanilla extract. I made it with a banana sauce and it was wonderful! The leftovers reheated well and still tasted good.

this is wonderful what me and my dad did was add some cinnamon to the batter it just gives it a little more sweetness. Also me and him put whip cream in the middle of our crapes then took strawberries and put sugar in them then let them get all juicy after that we took the juicy strawberries on top of the whip cream and rolled it up like a burrito. oh also 3 tablespoons are not going to fill the crape pan wich we have we put 1/3 cup of batter instead. anyway these are amazing. :)

Yum! I made half a batch by halving all ingredients. 

I had no lemon or vanilla- so i soaked some frozen fruit in warm water, drained it, then  soaked the fruit in a mixture of maple syrup and white sugar.  

I made the crapes with 2tbsp of pumpkin w/o taking anything out of the original recipe. Delicious but not very pumpkin flavored. i dusted the fruit-filled crapes with powdered sugar.

I had a craving for something sweet so I looked for recipes that contained the ingredients I already had and I came across this. I divided the recipe in half but I still had more than expected, which is okay. I loved it! I filled mine with thawed raspberries and cream cheese mixed with confectioners sugar and topped it with lite whipped cream. Soooo good! Will definitely make these again. Very simple to do.

These are so easy to make. I have a small pain I use every time. I follow as directed. They turn out perfect every single time. I make these on special occasions for breakfast. You can use whatever filings you enjoy. My family loves then with vanilla ice cream slightly melted, strawberries and fresh whipping cream from this sight. I put a little of the strawberry sauce on the inside with the ice cream. Fold it, a dollop of the whip cream and a drizzle of strawberry sauce over the top.

Delish!  First couple came out funny looking and too thick, but by the third crepe I was a pro.  I forgot to add the melted butter (oops), and I added a tiny bit of cinnamon and vanilla based on some recommendations, and I would definitely do that again.  They smell so good.  I used my nutribullet to blend the ingredients and make it easy to pour.  Highly recommend.

In order for the batter to be even useable you need to use an immersion blender to get the "smooth" consistency needed to cook them. Second once you try to flip or remove them the crepes simply fall apart. DO NOT TRY

I'm making this as I review; tripled the recipe; so I could freeze some later as other Reviews suggest; even Mother, who is very particular, proclaimed them "Very good . . . not too sweet". Despite tripling the recipe, this doesn't have an 'eggy' taste to it. Tomorrow I am going to get my veggie fillings together; Daughter will appreciate the break from her pancake breakfasts. I haven't experimented yet with additions to the batter (i.e., vanilla, etc.), but look forward to doing so. This is my basic, go-to recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I made these and they were awesome! But, I added a little bit of a cream cheese filling and strawberries to make it even better!??

I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination. I decided this morning to attempt this reciepe, and OMG it was a home run. It was easy and made my spouse proclaim they have a new favorite breakfast. I subtituted gluten free flour for the all purpose flour, so it is celiac disease friendly. I can't even explain how pleased we are. Thank you for sharing this incrediable receipe.

I just made these crepes this morning (I made the batter last night and put it in the fridge) and they turned out great! I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and followed the recipe as written. It was very easy and I had no problem with it. I used Pam sray on the pan too. I put a small spoonful of raspberry jam on them, rolled them out and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. Will  try cream cheese and chocolate spread in future.I recommend this recipes for light, flavorful crepes.

Great tasting crepe!! The only thing is I wish the batter was a little more fluid and less bumpy. May have been an error on my part, who knows. Overall great taste delicious with Nutella and powdered sugar!

I did not even KNOW what a crepe was. I saw it and was like, "well...I have all the ingredients soo...might as well try it." And MAN I was glad I tried this out because crepes are delicious! For some of you guys I just wanted to say...remember it's melted butter that you are supposed to use.

I first made as directed, but it was a little too eggy and the butter wouldn't dissolve totally so it had thousands of tiny butter bubbles.  So for the next time, I did it with 1 fewer egg and left out the butter.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Now the family all gave it 10 out of 10!

I have made crepes for my husband a lot and tried many different recipes. This recipe was very good and pretty simple. I like how they have a subtle sweet taste to them without adding any filling. Heads up this recipe, like others, makes a lot so make sure to give yourself a lot of time.

Perfect.  It didn't stick like some of the other ones I've tried.  Nice, thin, lightly sweetened.  We use this with the Farberware Crepe Maker.   I add 1 t vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe

Delicious! My boyfriend wanted dessert late at night so I followed the recipe and filled the crepes with a cream cheese and marshmallow cream mixture. Also, I plated with whipped cream and a chocolate hazelnut spread on the side. My boyfriend devoured his plate! I will definitely be making this again.

I liked it. I remembered halfway through the batch to add the vanilla as suggested. I didn't sample the ones without the vanilla. The ones with vanilla sure did smell better.

A-wait for it-Mazing! First time making crepes, Blue gives this recipes 2 thumbs up. Used whole-wheat all purpose made them brown and fluffy rather than white and fluffy. Used a cast iron pan because someone told me that you can't make crepes in a cast iron pan. Turned out just fine.

Unbelievably easy dessert.  When you run out of ideas for company, this is it.  You always have the ingredients in the home and you can fill them with anything you have handy.  I lightly spread each with whipped cream cheese to which I added a few drops of orange extract and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract.  Then on top of that, I spread 1 teaspoon of Jiff's Mocha Cappuccino spread, rolled them, topped with Cool Whip and topped with grated coffee bean and chocolate.  Was a major HIT with company.

I love this recipe! I use it so often. It love that it does not require ingredients that are not already in my kitchen. It makes a delicious snack or dessert. The only problem I have is that the flour clumps up in my batter. But, it does not affect the delicious taste, so I am fine with it.

This was very easy and very good.  I made extra small ones so I got more thank 8 servings.  I blended the ingredients to avoid lumps.  Then, after they were cooked I spread with Nutella!  A yummy authentic dessert.

If you want it a bit sweeter for dessert crepes, add some vanilla/sugar/cinnamon.  PERFECT basic crepe recipe. I just recipe-tested myself into not going to our favorite French restaurant for dessert!

1/4 of recipe makes 2 large crepes and 1 slightly smaller. Added 1/8 splash of vanilla to 1/4 of recipe and it smelled fantastic. Heat over medium. full recipes makes 8 crepes. keep warm on oven safe platter in oven at 200. 1/2 makes about 5 crepes. throwdown: crepes use banana filling from banana crepe recipe. 1/2 recipe and 2 sliced bananas.

This is a very simple easy recipe. I put all ingredients in my Vita-Mix blender, and zap, instantly mixed.  I added almond extract rather than vanilla the first time.  I have also added lemon extract, juice from two squeezed lemons along with the zest from the lemons.  Mmmmmm, really like that version.  As far as the amount to place in your pan, it really depends on your pan size. You will have to experiment, usually your first two crepes are practice anyway.  This  recipe I will use again and again and share with family and friends.

I thought this recipe was just average.  The consistency of the batter was good, and the buttery flavor was nice, but I found the crepes way too eggy.  I've definitely used better crepe recipes and I don't think I'd try this one again.

So good! only change I made was to add 1.5 tsp of vanilla. I used a very small amount of butter spray on my non-stick frying pan and I didn't have any problems with the crepes sticking. We ate these with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site also and just loved them!

This was pretty good. Took awhile to get it right... very little oil is needed, and pouring directly into the pan and very quickly rolling it around in the hot pan worked well (the less dough the better). Went through 3 pans before finding one the right size to turn these with a spatula without butchering them. Also went through 2 spatulas, the rubber flexible one was a nightmare, went with a thin metal one. Tried with ham/swiss and with nutella. Would try again, they did not crisp up like the ham ones I had in Paris though :(

Very tasty recipe! I made crepes before, it was my first time, and i got the recipe from a cookbook. can you say GROSS! I was totally discouraged and didnt make anything again for a long time. This recipe, however, is really really good. It was super easy to make, and they tasted really great when they were hot.

Excellent Crepe Recipe! I made the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site and filled the crepes with the chocolate and homemade whipped cream. The family loved them. The chocolate counters the sweet whipped cream for a well balanced not too sweet dessert.

These are excellent. I have tried to make crepes many times but they have never come out as good as the ones at a diner or restaurant UNTIL today. I actually think these are mcuh better.  I halfed the recipe but I still made 8 crepes. I was using 3 tablespoon of the batter for 1 crepe.  Enjoy.

Very nice!  Thin enough to make a proper crepe; but strong enough not to fall apart wehn you flipped them over.  Cook until just going slightly brown on the very (and I mean, very) edges; then turn over.  You know your pan is to hot is you end up with little holes in your crepe (this is caused by bubbles while you're swirling your crepe batter around the pan to spread it out.)  Overall; very nice; and will make again.

We've been making crepes for Sunday lunches for a few years now.  Never made for dessert.  We loved my recipe, but now this recipe replaced it.  My favourite topping is margarine and sprinked with sugar.  The kids gobble it down with butter/syrup.  My husband likes it with either pie filling or fresh fruit & whipped cream.  ENJOY!!!

My boyfriend and I loved these crepes. They are perfect for dessert or breakfast. I had to add about 1/3 cup for flour to my batter because it was too runny. Overall, great with fruit and chocolate syrup!

This were so easy to make and so delicious to eat! My boyfriend and I make them all the time now. We tried several variations to the recipe: wheat flour is a big no-no! Tastes terrible! But adding a little vanilla or almond extract really enhanced the flavor. I would also suggest trying different fillings... the “Lemon Snow” was really good as well as the “Chocolate Banana” filling.

I have tried a couple other recipes on this site, in hopes of duplicating the "pancakes" she makes, and finally I have found the one. I added a bit extra sugar and some vanilla.excellent recipe... I always thought crepes were difficult to make, but now I know better :P thanks for sharing

Good recipe, but it lacked a little something.  Added some vanilla and it turned out well. Didn't have fresh fruit on hand so I used strawberry jam and ice cream.

I made these with shredded cheddar and sliced turkey breast, served with maple syrup, just as we had at Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. Then I made dessert with the remaining crepes with caramel cream filling from a jar, topped with ice cream. Delicious, and you get two courses with one recipe. I'm an ex-Montrealer, and have been on a quest to find authentic crepes in the area. These are they!

Easy and delightful! I added vanilla extract and ground cinnamon to my recipe. My brother keeps asking me to make more "skinny pancakes".

First time I've attempted to make crepes, and these were easy, quick and delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and served them with sauteed apples and powdered sugar.  I can't wait to try some different fruits/fillings with this recipe.

These crepes turned out great, even the first one in and out of the pan.  I made the bater the night before, adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the recipe.  I noticed the flour was a little clumpy, so I put it in a mini food processor to thin it out.  The batter looked great after that.  The next morning, we had to stir it again, and my husband cooked them up easily.  A little jam and Nutella, an a family Christmas-time tradition was born!

These crepes were excellent. They turned out so great. There were more then eight for the recipe though, I had about 12, not that thats a bad thing! Maybe I just didn't make them as big. Either way they were fabulous, thank you!

I hav e discovered Crepes!! This was so simple and it was such a nice treat for everyone I added cinnamon and vanilla and filled with red rasberry jam. I would use jam or jelly again it turned out yummy.Minus the vanilla and cinnamon it was also be good filled with meat and cheese served with hashbrowns.

These are the best.  They are good if you put a little cottage cheese inside and drizzle caramel sauce over the top, then sprinkle with powdered sugar.  My family loves these.
