I have made these pancakes many times as I am on a keto diet. They always turn out beautifully and I use no sugar maple syrup with dollop cream and berries on top. I also added 2 tsp psyllium husk powder to my latest batch to include extra fibre (I always make a double batch for two breakfasts). Thanks so much for this recipe.

I love these!  They have an egg flavor, obviously, considering the ingredients.  Thin like a crepe.  They can be tricky to make, heat needs to be just right and my stove tends to cook hot so I am constantly adjusting the heat and ended up with med-low temp.  But that's not a recipe issue at all.  I do not add cinnamon, and use only very tiny amount of erythritol.  I have also made them without any sweetener at all.  You can add cheese to the mix and/or herbs for a more savory flavor.  Add some taco seasoning and use them as a soft taco shell (they don't hold up to a lot of handling though, so best as an enchilada type tortilla).

Love these crepe-style pancakes. I leave out the cinnamon and make them to use for wraps.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I have made pancakes with Almond flour, with coconut flour, but this simple keto recipe was the perfect blend .  The flavor and texture were delicious!  If your new to keto, this is a recipe that whips up in a moment and you don;t have to think about it.  Wrap it around your favor cold cut and cheese and you can have a wrap or eat it with sugar free syrup and some butter and its a perfect breakfast!

This is definitely a crepe! I was dying for pancakes. This is a great substitute for pancakes. Not as filling. You don't have that stuffed feeling when you're done.

These have a very nice flavor, even with no toppings on them. They do turn out pretty thin, though.  I used a scant 1/4 cup for each of 4 pancakes total.

I think these are delicious and an alternative to a “plain egg” while giving you a pancake/ crepe look. I added some vanilla extract and topped with sugar free strawberry jelly.

The favor was just like a regular pancake, however the batter was thin more like a crepe.  Yet I enjoyed them.

I love breakfast foods, and these were simple and relatively guilt free with fresh strawberries on top. I also will top with yogurt and a spoon of jam or preserves. Look forward to making more soon!

Like others said, they are thin and the first bite was eggy.  But I do love the texture of these.  They hold together and are very satisfying.  We will see if I’m hungry in an hour!  Almond flour pancakes are a more traditional fluffy texture but don’t hold together as well.  I may try combining the two somehow.

I guess 3 small pancakes are a serving, as that is all I can eat! I did add one scoop of whey Isopure because I have a problem with getting enough protein on a daily basis.
These came together quick and the grandkids ate them as well.

Theses turned out well. I doubled the recipe amount but the batter seemed too runny. I added another ounce of cream cheese and  1tbsp of xantham gum to thicken it up. I cooked them over medium heat and they fluffed up to a good thickness.

I thought this would come out tasting like crepes but it didnt. It however tasted like french toast and Its so good! I used a little butter since the batter kept sticking to the pan, but this is a really great low carb breakfeast.

The taste is great! At first I thought the texture would be like an omelette but it isn't. My only complaint is that I couldn't get it to stick together as a pancake. It came apart when I tried to flip it.

Im on Keto and I dont typically like pancakes normally and these were amazing. A dash of cinnamon and sugar free syrup. Yumm! Definitely a favorite now. They taste like french toast.

I tried to like this, i really did, i couldn't even pretend it felt or tasted right, and this could have been a personal palette thing, so id still tell everyone who was interested to give it a try for yourself. but my experience, for me it tasted like egg, i cant explain the texture but i didn't like it and i even tried to hide it with lemon juice and sugar....i didn't get through half before i gave up and i generally would eat almost anything when im hungry. i don't know maybe i did it wrong. give it a go but keep in mind it might taste eggy

I will not make these again! Mega thin. I finally added a bit of flour (I know not so low carb now but, edible) and cooked in my crepe pan. I would just use my crepe recipe if that’s what I wanted but, the DH was counting on pancakes. These do not fit the bill.

best one I have tried.  Watch cook time so they don't break apart on flip.

The pancakes were not light and fluffy, but they WERE low-carb, as I wanted them to be.  With peanut butter and some fruit, quite good really.

I made it exactly as written and loved these!  A wonderful break from my usual low-carb options.  I expected these to be "egg-y" and they weren't.  After trying an enjoyable bite (to give an honest review!) I did whip up some whipping cream, added a little Stevia, and topped with blueberries.  I'll definitely be making these again and again...

These pancakes are good, but not as fluffy as I like a pancake.  They were more like a crepe.  With that being said they did satisfy the craving for pancakes without the carbs!
