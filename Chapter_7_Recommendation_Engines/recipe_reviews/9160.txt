This recipe came out wonderful!  I added about 1/2 cup extra flour, and susbtituted white chocolate chips for the walnuts, as I did no have any on hand.  Over all an instant classic with my famiy.

This is just what I've been looking for, I read the reviews and I too added 1/2 cup more flour as I do not like thin crisp cookies. I also added a handful of toffee bits....They came out just perfect I got 75 nice size cookies Thank You

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the flavor is good, however, the recipe doesn't state how far apart to place the cookies.  The picture makes it appear that the cookies don't spread much, but they do.  I made the recipe twice, but they spread to very thin height.  I would put the balls at least 3 inches apart until you see how much they spread.  Next time, I'm going to add another 1/2 cup of flour.

These were WONDERFUL! I made a double batch (48 servings) and my family of 10 ate 2 dozen before the next two pans were even out of the ovens! I added 1/2 cup extra flour, as another reviewer suggested. I can see why they would spread a lot if you stuck to the original recipe... so it's a matter of personal preference if you want large, thin cookies or small, thick ones. :)  I'm so glad I tried this recipe, it is our new favorite! Highly recommend!!!!

Made these for Christmas. Followed others' suggestions, adding 1/2 c. extra flour and chilling dough for an hour before baking. Got 48 nice,round cookies. Had to sample for myself and found they were a rich, dark chocolate, perfect with coffee or mocha hot chocolate!

I love these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and then put batter in fridge overnight and they did not flatten out very much at all.  I have to hurry up and start giving them away before I eat all of them by myself.

Added 1/2 cup flour to total as recommended. These cookies are soooooooo delicious! My husband said they were the best cookies I ever made and I've been cooking and baking for over 40 years!
Other than the flour I followed the directions exactly. I may just try adding 1 tsp of vanilla the next time to see if they could possibly taste even better. 
I used parchment paper, air bake cookie sheets and let them cool on the sheets for five minutes or so.

Delicious with a cup of coffee! I made these cookies as written with just a few changes. I added a 1/2 cup of extra flour as per other reviewers suggestions, I refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before baking and I substituted pecans for walnuts. Mine turned out puffy with a crispy outside and a soft chewy inside. I will make them again.
