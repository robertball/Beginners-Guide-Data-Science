Oh, my gosh, this is my favorite apple pie, and for everyone that does not know, the overnight waiting period is to let the apple macerate - or let the juices collect - you don't HAVE to wait overnight, but it will not necessarily be as juicy... I love the flavor, but I personally put in a little more cinnamon and I add a little all spice to the filling - it generaly turns out very well, but I have to bake it for longer, just experiment, and definitly make it more than once - it took me a couple times to get this down, but it seriously is the best apple pie I've ever made, I love it! almost forgot - I use the butter flavored crisco, and the crust turns out wonderfully

This pie was good although I did a couple of things different. I used my own great tasting flaky crust recipe - so why try another. I also more than doubled the filling to 2 1/2 times. But used 3/4 c. sugar. I prefer a stuffed apple pie. See photo of my pie. I also cover the crust ends for 3/4 of baking time with crust covers. This way the crust stays golden. When using firmer apples like granny smith or greenings; it takes longer to get the apples tender and if the crust isn't covered the ends get too dark and left on the plate.It also doesn't look good.

I finally found an apple pie recipe that truly is "easy as pie"...The crust was easy to handle and baked up light and flaky! The filling was delicious! I would be proud to serve this one to my own Mother..."The Apple Pie Queen"

Very good pie, usually I put less sugar than the recipe, but I followed somebody's advise to actually add more sugar, so I did. I used all types of apples that we picked over the weekend (Mackintosh, Red delicious, Braburn)

My first pie ever, and it turned out almost perfect! I probably baked it a tad too long though, and the filling became a bit mushy, but it was a great tasting pie nevertheless! I sprinked extra cinnamon while filling the crust with the apple mixture, and I didn't need to refrigerate the filling overnight either. The sugar was just right for me, and I don't think I'll be looking for any other apple pie recipe ever!

This was the first time I tried this recipe and I made a triple batch. Just from experience I allowed the apples to marrinate for 2 days and I also added twice as much cinnamon and also subed half the white sugar for brown sugar. There was plenty of juice and the apples were pretty soft. My family loved the pies and I already have requests for more...Thank you this was a great recipe to start with.

This was a very good pie.   Tha apples were a little more crunchy than I like, but the taste was great.  (I didn't let it sit over night, and I do intend to try it that way to see if it makes any difference).

This is my go-to apple pie each Thanksgiving, though I love it any time of year!  I cheat & buy a pre-made crust because any short cut I can take during Thanksgiving, makes my life simpler.  This is delicious and really is easy as pie.

Perfect - that's all I can say. Really easy to make and it tastes sooooo good. Even my husband liked it and usually the only cake he's eating is from his mom. ^^

This was definitely not a keeper recipe.  The pastry was way too dry, as was the filling.  I thought it would be wonderful, since that's how it smelled while cooking.  Unfortunately, we didn't have enough milk in the house to wash it down with. I guess I'll keep looking for a great apple pie recipe.

This pie turned out great and was soooo good. I used all granny smith apples and for the crust, I just bought the pillsbury roll out crust. I doubled the sugar and cinnamon, and I think that made a big difference. Next time, I will put even more sugar, not too much more, because I don't like it too terribly sweet. The top crust with the half and half and sugar was delicious, all around, 5 stars!

disclaimer - I haven't tried the crust recipe yet, had something else on hand.

That said - an apple pie that tastes like apple instead of sugary goo. LOVE IT. The best! I used 3 Rhode Island Greenings and three Macouns and it was out of this world. Even my 4 yo who hardly tries ANYTHING tried and liked it. Hallelujah!

This was such a yummy recipe. I couldn't find any transparents here, so I used three golden delicious that were on the green side, and it was perfect. I added about an extra 1/8 c of sugar, and it was perfect. Still a little tart, as that's how my dad likes it. He is still raving about this pie!

This pie is soooooo!!!!good, I made one again this week...I used apples that I picked off of our apple tree in our yard...This pie is so simple to make...

Excellent. I sliced the apples a little slimmer than I usually would, and they turned out so soft and sweet. I decorated the crust with a few of the covered apple slices, and ended up handing out the recipe to several friends who raved about it. A new family favorite.

My boyfriend LOVES apple pie and this is now my go-to recipe for when I make one for him. When I'm pressed for time I just buy the pie crust instead of making it. Either way, the apple filling always turns out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I thought the crust was pretty bad. It crumbled everywhere are didn't look nice at all. The filling was pretty good. I used McIntosh and Golden Delicious apples. My husband who eats everything sid it just tasted like flour and didn't one more then one peice. Kind of dissapointed. Next time I will maybe use the filling but find a different crust receipe

Very good pie! I didn't have time to soak the apples overnight but I'm wondering if that's why some of you ended up with a mushy pie. I had to bake mine longer to get it fork tender. But everyone loved it! I topped it with whipped cream which was perfect!

This recipe was easy to follow.  The crust was perfect!  The second time I made this pie I added a little more cinnamon and sugar to the apple mix.  Overall a great pie.

Great crust, but the pie itself didn't taste anymore special than other apple pies I've had or made.  I don't know what the point was of refrigerating overnight, didn't change the taste.

Don't know if the overnight marinade was necessary.  Not enough sugar in the recipe for my tastes, but still pretty good.

My son was bringing his new girlfriend home to meet us, she does not like canned apple pie filling and neither does my husband, so I made this pie. WOW!  Raves from all of the family.  I only had granny smith apples, but what a delicious pie. No wonder it is a championship pie.

The filling was easy to prepare.  I too had 
some trouble with the crust cracking, but
it was worth it because I've never had pie 
crust so flaky before.  It was really 
good and everyone loved it =)

This is the very first pie I've ever made, and it was for my brother's birthday. He loves apple pie. There were two things that may be changes. the first is that I ended up making one change accidentally, being that I forgot to sprinkle the sugar on top right before baking. The second being that I had to make the doe twice in order to make the top of the pie. It's not really a change, but the recipe as far as I could tell, didn't include the ingredients for the pie's top. I reused the directions for the bottom dough, it made a lot of extra, but that's better than not having enough to cover the apples.
My mom loved the pie, but she's always preferred sour to sweet so I can see why. It was very sour.
Next time, I'll have to add more sugar and cinnamon, according to my brother's input. Maybe I'll make it for Thanksgiving. :)
But for the meantime the next birthday is coming up. Peach pie is on!

Excellent! I used this recipe for the filling and I wouldn't change a thing, but for the crust I've used Allrecipes' "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/basic-flaky-pie-crust/detail.aspx) a couple of times. Next time, will give the crust in this recipe a go as well.

This was the first pie I tried to make and I felt the receipe was easy to follow and the pie "looked" great. The crust was a bit bland. Felt it was okay, but not great.

This is a great apple pie. I made it for my dad on father's day, and he ate almost 
the entire pie. I intend to make this pie often. Thanks!

This was the first pie I ever made from scratch and it worked beautifully.  I did not experience any of the problems that I thought I might have with the dough.  Cooked evenly with no burnt or soggy parts.  I felt like a pro taking it out of the oven.  I don't need any other pie recipe.

A hit with my family!  Like others, I found the crust dough hard to handle, but I just patched it back together after I put it in the pan, and it turned out well.  The crust is nice and flaky...more so than most of my home-made crusts.

I had hard time with the crust. It kept cracking even if i added the cold water and chilling the crust. But the filling was easy to make and the smell is great.

When I made this pie, it looked great!  It probably would've tasted better if I had not forgotten to add the butter, but it was ok anyway.  Wasn't too keen on the taste of the crust, it was too bland.
