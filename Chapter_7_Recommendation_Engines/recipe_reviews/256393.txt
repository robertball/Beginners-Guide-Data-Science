This one is hard to rate, because I made mistakes that may have changed the outcome. We loved it the way I made it and my husband says I need to keep making it with my mistakes left in. I didn't have enough sugar so I added  brown sugar for the 1/2 cup I was short, and I over loaded the cake with apples. My cake came out moister then most cakes with a candied like crust making it even crunchier. I am thinking if it is this good with mistakes then it is stellar made as written. A tasty, easy, forgiving recipe.

I substituted mashed bananas for the oil and made this into a round layer cake with cream cheese icing. Delicious!!!
