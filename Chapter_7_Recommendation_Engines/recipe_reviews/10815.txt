This is my old stand-by for a huge batch of sure-to-please cookies; it's the one I make more than any other.  I am repeatedly asked for the recipe.  The previous reviews are correct; the recipe should call for 8 tsp. soda, not 8 Tbsp.  Other helpful hints:  4 1/2 c. br. sugar = 2 lbs;  2 cups butter = 1 lb;  3 lbs. peanut butter = a total of 5 3/8 cups;  18 cups rolled oats = more than a 42 oz. box.  I shake down my measurement of oats and figure generously; it helps the flattening problem.  I also chill the dough before forming the cookies to help prevent flattening.  I use 1 lb. each of mini chocolate chips and M&M's, and I much prefer the crunchy peanut butter; the pieces of peanuts add wonderful texture.  Do not overbake these!  Remove them from the oven while the cracks are still shiny and wet looking, then let them set several minutes before removing them from the pan so they won't fall apart while handling them.  This makes a mountain of cookies, but it's wonderful keeping a supply in the freezer for unexpected guests and gatherings; we've never had any problem getting rid of them!

This is the same recipe I've used for years.  Like many others you'll get a super flat cookie.  I don't care for them that way so I take a fourth of the oatmeal and blend it in a food processor until it's a flour like consistency...no more flat cookies!

I got this recipe from my mother-in-law 10 years ago who had been using it for many years prior. It is absolutely my most favorite cookie in the world; however, I should warn you that 8 TABLESPOONS of baking soda is a bit too much for this recipe. I made that mistake the first time I made them. It leaves a little after-taste although I still devoured them completely up. I suggest using 8 teaspoons instead. My recipe also includes 1 cup of nuts, 2 cups of coconut, and 1/2 cup wheat germ.

I've been making these for 30 years.  Best kid breakfast on the run.  I just omit the chocolate chips, reduce the m&m's in half, and use mini m&m's.  freeze well.  I fill gallon size, freezer zip lock baggies, flatten as 1" slabs, and I just cut off what I want to bake.

I have used this recipe for over 15 years and it is the best I've tried.  They freeze great and even taste great when eaten right out of the freezer.  They make a big batch to last a long time.  They are a yummy, chewy peanut butter cookie.  It seems like a huge recipe, but definately worth the time!

I followed the recipe pretty close (no corn syrup) and these turned out great. The dough was so good I will be several short of 80.

These cookies are a regular when we a traveling.  They hold up better than other cookies.  I added butterscotch chips and mini M&M's along with the reg. chocolate chips.  This batter freezes great - make the entire recipe and freeze the unbaked formed cookies to bake latter.

There is a mistake in ingredients: should be 8 teaspoons of baking soda not 8 tablespoons.  We make monster cookies a lot and this is my grandmother's recipe.

I followed the suggestion to process some of the oats for fluffier cookies, they still came out flatter than a pancake and had a weird after taste

My family has been making these cookies forever. Everyone always requests them for the holidays. And I enjoy seeing the look on people's faces when I tell them what all goes in them. I always make sure to add butterscotch chips to them. It makes them even more rich! We also put Grape Jelly in them.

WONDERFUL monster cookies; exactly how I remember they should be. :)  Consistency is perfect (the dough sticks together and doesn't fall apart when trying to shape the cookies).  Thanks for a great recipe!!! : )

Use teaspoons instead of tablespoons of baking soda, and you'll like this recipe. I blended up four cups of the oats to make a flour, and used chopped peanuts instead of M&Ms, since my children cannot have dye. My children love these.

These were ok.  I cut this recipe down and made three dozen of regular size cookies.  The first thing you taste is the baking soda. They look great when they come out of the oven and the flatten as soon as you place it on the counter.  I would not be making these again.

This recipe makes for some very salty cookies.  The recipe should call for 8 teaspoons of baking soda instead of 8 tablespoons baking soda. With this minor change comes some fantastic tasting cookies!

the 8 TBLS should be 8 TSP (at least that's how my recipe reads). These cookies are my favourite though. They turn out flat and chewy.

Just what I was looking for!

I made 1/3 of the original recipie and  had plenty of cookies.  Also to the reviewer who had them turn out flat as a pancake, try adding a little flour.  I had no problem with spreading.  I would like to note that the cookies did fall a little once out of the oven.

Everyone loved this recipe. I reduced the recipe down to 20 cookies and had plenty.  I also added reeses pieces, Peanut M&Ms and butterscotch chips.  The kids just love them.
