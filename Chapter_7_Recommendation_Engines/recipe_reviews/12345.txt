This pie was very good instead of using a tablespoon of vanilla extract I used 1 teaspoon and I cooked it a little longer than 30 minutes since I was baking it in a deep dish pie plate

My improvements are as follows:  2 cups sugar (instead of 1 3/4 c.)  and 1 cup of heavy cream (instead of milk).  1. Beat eggs. Add cream, vanilla & melted butter. 2.  Mix in combined dry ingredients. Thanks, Irene, for a decade of good Southern dessert-eating! I'll be serving for Christmas this year.

Made for a dinner party and it went over great!  Used 2 cups or milk and 1/2 cup of cream as suggested by someone else and sprinkle coconut on top after baking as a garnish.  Very creamy!  Thanks for sharing!

My family makes this pie every Thanksgiving, and only the men are allowed to make it. Our version is a little different, so we consider it a "secret family recipe."
