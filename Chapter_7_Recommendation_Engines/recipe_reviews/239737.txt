Flavor was good, but between the veg oil, olive oil and butter as written, it had somewhat of a fatty residue. Would reduce the amounts of fat next time

I salted the beef and lightly coated them with 4 tbsp flour  mixed with 4 tbsp corn starch, added an extra tsp of fresh garlic to it.
I only had a Tbsp of Worcestershire and 1 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce on hand and I cooked it on the stove top in a pot, 
There wasnt any leftovers.
It was very tasty.
Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Only give it a 4 because I use 2-3 shots of good brandy rather than burgundy. Have tried it with dumplings, but we like it better over Zatarains par-boiled long grain white rice. 
(I use NO other brand. Cant buy it locally but order it online.) It is a keeper..made it numerous times. Cooking as we 'speak'. And I suggest a vintage cast iron Dutch oven.

Made it exactly as is (I always do the first time) and it was very good.  The family really liked it too.

I thought it was a great recipe. I will definitely make it again. However, I did add pepper to it. I also didn't use the butter.
