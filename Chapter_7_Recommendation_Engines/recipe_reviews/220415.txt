Was using boxed mix but ran out.  Pulled up AllRecipes and this was on the front page, so we decided to try the recipe.  Followed the recipe as is.  They were the best pancakes I've ever had!!  Light and fluffy with great flavor!!!

I used lactose-free milk which I soured with two tablespoons of vinegar and I also used melted margerine instead of butter. The reason I made those substitutions was because I have a son with a dairy sensitivity. Even with the substitutions these turned out exactly as they should--light, fluffy and absolutely perfect. The recipe says it serves four? Psh......my kids ate EVERY SINGLE ONE.

I've tried numerous pancake recipes over the years, but this is the first recipe I've found that truly matches the flavor, fluffy texture, appearance and convenience of a box mix.  I'd just about given up on making pancakes from scratch, but this recipe looked a little different - yet easy - so I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did!  Even my husband, who decided a few years ago that box pancakes are the best bet because they're so easy and reliable, said that these are the best from-scratch pancakes he's ever had.  Thanks to Chef John for sharing this!

I followed this recipe exactly and found the pancakes to be salty.  I checked and rechecked to make sure it was not a mistake on my part.  Maybe unsalted butter next time?

I was really looking forward to these pancakes, I questioned the amount of baking powder, but decided to follow the recipe to a T. 
The batter in itself was so thick, thicker than cake batter, but they looked so so good on the griddle and thought I hit a homerun. But unfortunately they were completely salty and chemical tasting. My kids aged 1½ and 3 did not eat them and the little one said, "yuckies". :-( 
I will do as some other reviewers also did and reduce the baking powder and add extra sugar.

This is no joke,  I have tried almost every pancake recipe on here and this is the BEST! I tried it exactly as written, delicious.  But we like really sweet stuff so I added in a total of 3 tablespoons of sugar,  reduced the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons, increased butter to four tablespoons and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  In my opinion they tasted like I HOP pancakes.  I'll never go out for pancakes ever.  Although I decreased the baking powder,  I think it's the baking powder amount and the resting of the batter that makes these the best fluffy pancakes ever.  Try it,  You will not be sorry.  Yummy! !

These are really nice a fluffy.  They puff up so beautifully.  So easy to make too.  I made the recipe as written but next time I might add a teaspoon of vanilla.  Enjoy!

Perfect pancakes – light and fluffy.  I used half the amount of salt (my usual habit) and added blueberries (another habit) for a great morning breakfast.

These were pretty tasty, but I was a little surprised at how much like the box mix they turned out to be. That's not necessarily bad, but I think I was expecting a little bit more from them. I did make a couple of changes in adding a little cinnamon and some vanilla, and I cooked them in some butter instead of spray. Good, but not mind-blowing.

I loved this recipe!  I add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/8 teaspoon less salt.  They were the lightest, fluffiest pancakes I've ever had or prepared.

This recipe was great! I cut down on the baking powder to only 1 1/2 tbsp and doubled the sugar. Was fluffy and delicious!

Old-Fashioned Pancakes' Haiku: "Batter way too thick. Had to add a bunch more milk. But the taste was good." So maybe it's all the baking powder, but my batter was crazy thick, so I had to add splashes of milk b/t batches. 1st batch of pancakes was ridiculously chubby, like a biscuit, making me skeptical as to whether they were cooked thru all the way, but they tasted good, not chemical-ey or too salty. As I increased the milk, they thinned out to pour more easily, and cooked up nicely. Final batch was the best b/c I also threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips and a bit of vanilla extract. I'll make these again, definitely over using a box mix, but I'll either reduce the baking powder, or increase the milk, and see how that works out.

I've gone through a lot of pancake recipes, trying to find the right one.  This one is pretty good, and the one I consistently use on the weekends.  However, I only use about 2.5 tsp of baking powder (3.5 made the cakes a little bitter) and sometimes need to add more milk to thin the batter.  CAUTION!  Make sure your butter, milk and eggs are the same temperature!  Mixing cold milk with melted butter makes it coagulate!

Updated Review: I still love this recipe, it's my go to when making pancakes. Just made the recipe again for my visiting nephew (he's 7) and to bump up the fiber,  I ground some oatmeal and replaced 3/4 cups of the flour with the ground oats (he didn't even notice!) And added a banana and a bit of vanilla. In the past, when adding banana I've decreased the amount of milk (to balance the moisture) but this time I usedthe 1 1/4 cups of milk plus the blended banana, and they were perfect. Thanks again Chef John, these are delicious!

This is a quick and tasty pancake recipe. Chef John's video tutorial for this recipe is an added bonus. Even though I've only ever made pancakes from scratch, I learned a lot from the video.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I swear I make this every weekend for my husband and he BRAGS about how I make the best pancakes EVER!  (High praise from a southern boy!)  Thanks for making me look like a good cook!  (I do alter it a bit and just use buttermilk rather than melting butter and adding it to milk.)

I always make my pancakes from scratch and then freeze the leftovers for quick and easy weekday mornings. This recipe is perfect for that! First I triple the recipe, and then add about 2 teaspoons of vanilla. You can also change it up by adding a dash or two of cinnamon, or you can fold in some chocolate chips, blueberries, bananas, etc. for a delicious twist!

OMG!  These pancakes are even better than IHop!  They are so light and fluffy, I actually expected them to float off my plate.  I am deleting all prior pancake recipes, and no more boxed mixes either.  THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST!

Reminds me of the pancakes my mom made when I was a kid. Easy to make and wonderful flavor. Several other reviewers complained about the salty or chemical taste. I almost put in 3 1/2 Tablespoons of baking powder, instead of 3 1/2 teaspoons. I'd bet they made that mistake. I printed out the recipe and higlighted 'teaspoons' to avoid that possible mistake.Nobody could give this recipe less than 4 stars if they made it correctly.

Just made these... used buttermilk instead of regular and added 2 extra eggs to up the protein.  YUM!! My children LOVED them.  They were fluffy and delicious.  Will use less salt next time and add vanilla as some of the reviewers suggested.

These had to be the best pancakes I've ever had. They were so fluffy. When you melt the butter, make sure to let it cool before mixing it with the egg. If it's hot, then it begins to cook the egg. You don't want that!! Add a little extra milk, because the batter is almost too fluffy. Without adding a little more milk, you can only bake almost 2 pancakes. You want to make sure you have enough for your whole family. Let me tell you something. There will not be any leftovers after you make these pancakes. Enjoy!!!

Do you miss Grandpa's "flapjacks"? Well, you've found the recipe! I know it SAYS pancakes, but that's not accurate. These are my Grandpa's flapjacks, (except for the cooking spray)!  You can't go wrong with this recipe. Whoever eats these will request them often. I make them for our overnight guests and everyone loves them. I love a certain box mix for it's convenience and versatility. So sorry, I won't be using that mix for flapjacks ever again. Nor, I am certain, will you!

The dry ingredients can be assembled separately from the wet ones the night before so I don't have a messy kitchen when I finish making these the following morning.  I strive for a way to eat my foot HOT and WITH the members of my family without leaving a typhoon kitchen.  This recipe does that trick if planned in advance and keeps well in the oven as I finish the last few ones.  PS  It also makes great face, flower, Mickey Mouse or other fun recipes!

My daughter wanted to make pancakes from a box mix for breakfast after a sleep over. I am a baker and using anything from a box mix make me want to be ill. We found this recipe and followed it almost to a T. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and they were amazing! There were NO left-overs here. I put this in my recipe box and will never buy a box again!!!

Sift dry ingredients and measure carefully. If you use whole milk, you may end up with thicker batter. For light, fluffy texture, don't over mix and, most importantly, let the batter rest at least 5 mins. The baking powder needs time to activate. I just replaced my family favorite pancake recipe with this one. HINT: Watching videos prior to making a recipe for the first time may be the key to success. Sifting and resting. Two things I learned from this video. Glad I watched it.

I use significantly more milk with this recipe, as I find it much too thick. No idea how much exactly, I just continue adding until it reaches the desired consistency. Otherwise, great recipe, makes lovely fluffy pancakes.

Nice and fluffy, but VERY thick batter.  Added about another 1/4 c of milk to get it to a more manageable consistency after the first try, and worked much better.

We always have "pancake Sunday" and I have tried many different recipes, this is hands down the best recipe I've ever tried!  Perfect light fluffy pancakes every time, the only problem I ever have is trying not to over indulge!

Have made these 50 times now and always completely omit the salt.  I usually double the recipe (big family) and it has rendered delicious, light pancakes that seem to disappear as soon as they leave the skillet.  Dry/liquid ratio seems to be right on.  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfection, perfect amount of rise and the taste was exactly what a pancake should taste like.  Awesome recipe for doing a fruit compote for the topping. Most of all my family absolutely loved them.

This was a winner.  It is truly light and fluffy. I made this just as the recipe states. The kids call them biscuity pancakes. We served them with homemade strawberry syrup and chopped strawberries with whipped cream.  They graciously absorbed the syrup without getting soggy.  The kids helped make them .  They are nearly impossible to overcook. New favorite!

I just tried this recipe this morning...very good.  I read the comments about the salt but decided to try the recipe as is.  I was able to taste the salt but it was not an element that rendered the pancake "bad"  1/2 teaspoon of salt would work very well also.  Thank you Chef John  :)

OMG these were sooooo fluffy and delicious I could hardly stand it.   I added less baking soda and more milk since the batter was a bit thick.   I will 100% make them again...maybe tomorrow...

I think this was the most disgusting pancake recipe I have ever tried. They were so salty that I could not even swallow them. They smelled like a salted pretzel. 1 tsp of salt is huge considering most recipes call for 1/4 tsp. Nasty! Will never make theses again.

The right consistency. Too much salt, though. Sifting the flour is a great tip for newbies like me.

My family has a lot of dietary restrictions.
I made this with white rice flour, almond milk, and then truvia in place of sugar.
Even with my substitutions this recipe came out perfectly.
Thank you!

Best and easiest recipe for pancakes I have ever tried. So excellent and I followed the recipe as is. Not sure why somone said they were salty mine certainly weren't sounds like the sifting wasn't done properly but, omg were they good with honey. We don't use syrup in my house we use honey instead. So glad I found this recipe.

I just tried this recipe this morning and followed it to a T.  The batter was very thick, so added another 1/2 cup of milk.  They cooked up really nice and were tasty.  I do prefer the Fluffy pancake recipe on this site though, but this one is a little easier because you don't have to let the milk and vinegar sit separately for a while until it curdles and foams.  This recipe allows you to put all the ingredients in one bowl.  If I make these again, I will add a little more sugar, and cut back on the baking powder.

Love this recipe - I've had the exact same recipe for 20+ years from my MIL. You don't even have to sift the dry ing. together if you don't want to, they still come out great!!  I just put dry ing in a bowl and stir together with a dry wisk. I also made it healthier over the years by cutting out the salt and using 4 TBSP apple sauce instead of butter and half whole wheat flour.  The kiddo's never noticed a difference!

This was just awful.  Waaaaay too salty!  My son refused to eat it and said it was too "spicy."  I think he means salty.  A total waste of time.  I'm sure I could make some adjustments if I attempt this in the future - like no salt and more sugar or something.

I hate to give low stars, but I was really not impressed with this recipe.  They were closer to baking powder biscuit flavor than pancake, and they were a touch salty.  I don't think I'll make these again.

Made beautiful pancake, best looking ones I've ever made, looked fluffy and perfect. However, when I followed the directions to the T they were terrible. Don't use the amount of baking powder listed, WARNING, they taste like chemicals...

I followed the recipe as directed and they were awesome and fluffy.  I did find that they were a tad too salty for my personal taste but, I will make the adjustment and I will NOT be purchasing the boxed mix again.  Thanks Chef John!  YUMMY :-)

I ran out of pancake mix and my husband and I didn't feel like running to the store to purchase any so I found this recipe and luckily I had everything I needed in my kitchen! My husband loved this recipe so much, he no longer wants the boxed pancake mix! There is just a little more work involved than the boxed mix but it is so worth it when you take the first bite! All you will taste is buttery goodness! I follow the recipe to the tea but I fry them with a small amount of peanut oil at the bottom of the pan as they were sticking with the cooking spray the first time I tried this recipe. I drain the pancakes on plenty of paper towels. Once they are drained, they are ready to be enjoyed! Thanks for the superb recipe!

I've been stuck on Bisquick for years-I really like it and they make a good pancake /baking mix, but I figured it was time to try it again from scratch.This is a good recipe-which I will tweek in the future. I got paranoid after reading the reviews,so I only used 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teas. of salt. I also used organic baking powder,and have another can of "Aluminum free" baking powder in the cupboard. That was the first thing that hubby said,was that it had no metallic taste to them. So anyone that gave a bad review because of any chemical taste-I would say look to your ingrediants as being the culprit.I used 2 tablesp.of sugar.The next time I make them I will also up the bak. powder by another 1/2. I always make blueberry,simply because I have an orchard.I did add a teasp. of vanilla.I did sift it, and at 5 a.m. I had time to bring my milk/egg up to a bit room warmer before putting together.The only thing I found was they took quite a bit longer to cook than specified,maybe because I cut back the bak. powder.I always let the mixture rest for a bit also.I think people also have to slow down and read the recipe thoughout correctly before giving it a bad review. There is nothing wrong or hard about doing this recipe so I gave it the 5 stars. Now I'll go watch his video...thanks for a good one!

AWESOME!!!! Added a few tbs of sour cream to milk along with a dash of vinegar to "buttermilk" things up. Have also made exactly as Chef John instructs. This recipe is a hit. During the Calgary Stampede & Exhibition pancakes are a staple and this recipe more than fits the bill. Thanks Chef John!!!!! AAA+++

Awesome! Can use coconut oil in place of butter and can use half of what is called for and it still tastes great! Thanks chef :)

Okay, while this is probably the best pancake recipe I've made - the texture, ease, how they cooked - they were SO SALTY they were inedible. I would cut the salt in half at least.

I decided to give these a try seeing as I am a huge pancake lover, it came out pretty nice. I would highly suggest leaving out the salt,I only used a little pinch and even that was not really necessary.

Great pancakes, although reviews are right about the salty issue, so I doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and they were just great!

I've tried it the way it was written & agree with some reviewers that it was a bit salty & this was AFTER I decreased the salt to 3/4ts. The texture, however was amazingly fluffY & melted in your mouth. So I fed the 1st batch to my boy child, who agreed on the saltiness but with syrup he didn't much care. The 2nd batch, I used faux buttermilk (milk & vinegar), added 2 more tbl of sugar, decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp & mixed until the ingredients we're just wet but still lumpy. BEST PANCAKES EVERRR!

These pancakes are awesome!  I followed the directions almost exactly....I substituted all of the milk for tap water and I only used 1/2 tsp table salt. They tasted great and were the perfect thickness.  They soaked up syrup just like diner pancakes!  I plopped several frozen blueberries into the batter AFTER I had ladled it on the hot pan (so they didn't turn all of the batter blue).  As far as serving size... I got about five 6-inch pancakes from this recipe (using 2/3 c of batter for each one).  This would be a good amount for 2 people if it is the only thing you are eating. I think it could serve 5 if you were adding it to a breakfast smorgasbord. Yum!

We will never use another pancake recipe. We've been using it for almost two years now, and it's always been amazing. I've adjusted the servings down to 2 and up to 5, and it always turns out awesome. Trust the recipe and don't change a thing. You won't be sorry.

This recipe was okay.  The pancakes were definitely fluffy, but I'm glad I took the advice of others on here and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. They tastes exactly like boxes pancakes and I was hoping there would be something special about them. They were quite dry so next time I would add more milk, but with syrup it wasn't too noticeable. I would probably also add more sugar next time to help make them more of the perfect blend between sweet and salty. Overall, not bad, but definitely some things I would tweak next time I make it.

I always make the new recipes that I try for the first time EXACTLY as directed before leaving a review/critique. Let me tell those who read these reviews, that THIS one is the real deal. It is FANTASTIC>. The pancakes turn out fluffy and flavorful. Not too thick or thin perfect consistency. This is replacing my OLD recipe (not a box) that my family has been using for years. My husband loved it my kids loved it. Simply Fantastic.... NOW for the tweeking that I did after the first time that I made these pancakes. The ONLY thing that I did different is that I like my pancakes to be a bit on the sweeter side, so I increased the surgar by 2 TBS.  My kids sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top before the syrup... BUT THIS even if you don't tweek the recipe is nothing short of FANTASTIC. IF I COULD GIVE 10 STARS OR MORE I WOULD. THANK YOU FOR POSTING AND SHARING THIS PANCAKE RECIPE

It was not nearly as fluffy as I expected.  I only used 1cup of milk as it was already too thin.  Flavor & texture is good.

Can I just say WOW.  I will never go back to boxed pancake mix.  WOW.   
These came out light and fluffy and delicious.   They make 8 pancakes when using 1/3 cup.   My kids love helping me make them.  And they love watching them puff up.   when I flip those.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. 
They are so good we haven't even started adding fruit or even chocolate chips. 

I have to also say after watching the video of chef John.  my pancakes come out a LOT fluffier.  and a LOT thicker.  I don't know why but they do.

We just tried making these and the batter ended up waaay too thick even though we followed the recipe exactly. It's thick like cake batter and definitely does not look like what he did in the video, even though we watched the video twice before we made them! Not happy!

Best  pancakes I've ever flopped a lip on. I made these for my Sleek, slender girlfriend, who has ninja-like skills AND loves a good pancake. I made them exactly to the recipe and I served them up with very warm homemade Maple blueberry syrup that my friend Danny Banks makes. It's the only gauldang pancake I'll ever make again... Three thumbs up if I had that many... Know whad I'm saying ?

One of the reviews suggested decreasing the baking powder to 2 1/2 tsp, increasing sugar to 3 T and adding 1T vanilla. I followed these recommendations and it turned out delicious.  They also suggested using 4T of butter but I left it at 3. I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. Better than any restaurant I've ever been to and cheaper. Will be making again.

I added a couple dashes of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract.  Used coconut oil to cook instead of non stick spray. They were perfect. Crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  Even my husband enjoyed them.  My toddler couldn't get enough.  This is our new go to!

Second pancake recipe I've tried from this site, and it's definitely the best.  Note that I added a healthy amount of honey and "soured" the milk before use.

excellent, fluffy pancakes!   Sometimes I decrease the salt by half and they still taste delicious!  My husband and I enjoy this recipe so much that we have pancakes for dinner 1-2x a month!

First time i tried this, I thought it was too "liquidly" and salty. So the second time around, I put half a teaspoon of salt and reduce the milk (I eyed it). We loved it. Will be making this more again.

Tried this recipe at least three times and it never failed me.   Those who have tried my pancakes were impressed. I use organic coconut oil instead of butter to fry my pancakes. This adds a tinge of coconut fragrance plus an extra crisp to them.  I am sooo glad I chanced upon this recipe.  Thank you for sharing with us Chef John.

Big hit!  Followed recipe exactly (including sifting which I usually skip), I did let batter rest for a good 20 minutes and that usually works well for me.  This one is a keeper!

Very good like all the recipes from this chef! I use shortening to heat up the batter rather than cooking spray.

I made these pancakes because we ran out of the pre-made pancake mix. I decided to search pancake recipes but I was sceptical because they usually required some crazy weird ingredients. I was surprised to see that I had everything I needed to make these pancakes! When I made them, they were thick and fluffy, just how I like it! These pancakes are just too good to be so easy to make! 5 stars for sure!

This is so far the best pancake recipe I've tried.  I did add strawberries but 5 stars are because they are fluffy, yummy and not dry.  And my kids gobbled them up ALL day.

This is the best recipe I've had. I will definitely do it again... and again. The only change I will do is to use half of the salt, since it was a little salty to my taste.

Every single time I make pancakes, I use this recipe.  People love it!  I always add a little bit of vanilla and some lemon juice to add just a little extra.  These pancakes also make great blueberry pancakes. Just make sure that they are cooked all the way in the center. That can sometimes be a challenge because the pancakes are so thick. Other than that, they are AMAZING!!

This is my go to recipe! Lately, I've noticed that my pancakes have been a little salty though. I've come to realize that it's the kind of butter I have. Lesson learned? If your butter is already salty, you may want to decrease the amount of salt in your recipe or go without it at all. Overall, my favorite recipe!

This recipe is deceptively simple, but the results are just great! The pancakes turned out really fluffy and flavorsome, even though I used only half the amount of salt and reduced the amount of baking powder slightly. I divided the batter in two batches and added a sliced apple to the second batch which really worked. I will definitely be making them again!

This was possibly the best plain pancakes I have eaten.  I lighten it up a bit because that is what I have.  I used Truvia, yogart butter, 1/2 all purpose  & wheat flour, and coconut milk.  They were still amazing .

Absolutely perfect as written.  Very thick batter makes very thick, but light and fluffy cakes.  I used aluminum free baking powder so no salty or metallic flavor here.  I also didn't use butter, just softened.  It left tiny nuggets of butter in the batter which enhanced the buttery goodness.  Kids prefer thinner cakes so I added a few tablespoons of water to thin batter out.  Absolutely wonderful and so easy.

Love this recipe was so easy to make. The only thing I didn't have was the butter so I used 3Tbs of vegetable oil instead and added one more tbs of sugar and almond extract to it. The grand kids loved them. They came out so good I was very happy, ??  ??  ?? !

I only made 1/2 a batch and still came up with like 10 pancakes! Very good flavor, next time I will add berries, wanted to get the full texture and flavor the first time.  Definitely better than box. I am going to mix the dry ingredients for a batch and store so they are faster to put together in the morning! Thanks for this recipe I was searching for one with out buttermilk, because I don't always have it on hand. Thanks again
UPDATE: new milk allergies.!! We've made these with almond and coconut milk still very good. 
Also subbed coconut oil for butter worked great!

Very good fluffy pancakes that did not absorb tons of syrup. If I were to add anything to the basic recipe would be a little vanilla. They were great as is.

I did this recipe just this minute, craving some 'diner style' pancakes and I have to admit, they were pretty tasty. For those complaining of the salt, be sure to sift the dry mixture a few times to evenly distribute everything. When the recipe says to sift, do it at least twice. Also, be sure you are using baking POWDER and not baking SODA(which is very salty). This is a common mistake(hence his reference during the video I guess)They were a little thick, but they cooked up nicely and we had them for dinner lol. I would try again, but maybe with a dash more milk and maybe a 1/2 tsp less baking powder. I liked them, though, overall!

UPDATE: 9/13/14 - Did these pancakes twice this past week. Once with 1 1/2 cups of milk and it came out beautifully with just a tad more milk. Melt in your mouth delicious. Also, I cooled them on top of a cookie grid so they wouldn't get soggy(don't stack them!)and froze them in a freezer bag(you can stack them once they are completely cool). We had them for breakfast this morning and put them in the microwave on full power for about 1:10-1:15 and they were like I'd just cooked them!! I will NEVER buy a box mix again! I often like to make my own breakfast stuff and freeze it for ease because our mornings are hectic. This fits the bill. Also DO NOT STIR AGAIN after the five minute wait or they won't be as fluffy. Thanks again!

I"ve been looking for a good recipe for pancakes that's more than "just add water" and this is it. I was concerned after the five-minute wait because the batter had turned fluffy but I stuck with it and did not give in to the temptation to add milk and return it to a pourable batter. These cook up GREAT. They are light and the taste is spot on - a little baking powder bite that just keeps you wanting one more forkful! I tossed on each one a few blueberries and some pecans and sprinkled some cinnamon on a couple of them, and I always cook pancakes in butter for a little tastier crunch. I have created a new folder and this recipe is my first "keeper" for pancakes. I might experiment next time with some whole wheat flour but really, these are super just as described.

I ran out of the box pancakes this morning and decided to give this recipe a shot. I followed the recipe, but instead of the 1 1/4 milk for the six serving I used 1 3/4 milk. DELICIOUS! Melt in my mouth pancakes! I will never go back to the box pancakes from here on out. A very easy recipe, my 12 year old is able to make pancakes from scratch now. Thank you Chef John for sharing this fantastic pancake recipe!

I liked this recipe, I use organic coconut oil in place of butter and spray, freshly made flour  from our nutrimill, real salt, completely naturally farm raised eggs, organic baking powder, and raw milk. I have to multiply this recipe 4-8 times for it to be enough for my siblings, dad and mom!

I've tried this recipe today, and it came out good with a little tweaking. The first pancake was too salty and with a powder taste as many other reviewers mentioned; also, the batter was too thick for me to work with, so I added another 1/2 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar, which fixed all the issues just perfectly. Will try this again.

If really light and fluffy pancakes are what you are looking for then this is definitely your recipe. However I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and made some changes. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, increased the sugar to 3 tbsps and added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract. The taste was good though not
excellent. Also the batter is thicker than most pancake batters but it works fine.
Update: Made these today - used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, used olive oil instead of butter. They were as good and healthier !

I was complaining that every time I make pancakes they're too thin from a box mix. Well, I figured I would at least attempt to make some from scratch. I looked for a recipe with a nice thick fluffy photo and I found this one. Usually, I read the reviews BEFORE trying the recipe but this recipe seemed basic enough. These pancakes were DELICIOUS! My entire family loved them... and best of all they weren't thin, flat and limp! Next time, I will add a dash of vanilla and some blueberries to the mix. 

I should mention that unless I made some overly large pancakes, this did not yield 12 servings. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made these today ... followed recipe except for added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the milk. These came out tall but not as light as I would have expected. They were a bit salty and nothing special. Still looking for a go to recipe for pancakes. This fed me, my husband, and my grown son. Would definitely double the recipe if we had all the kids today.

This is my favorite pancake recipe, I had always bought the mix from the grocery store, but after deciding one day to try to make pancakes from scratch, I came upon this recipe and it changed the way my family ate pancakes. I will never go back to boxed pancake mix. You can use this same recipe for chocolate chip pancakes or blueberry, follow the exact same recipe just add about a half a cup of  the extra ingredient.

Delicious recipe for pancakes! Despite the reviews, I used the full amount of baking powder and it was fine - no chemical taste in batter or final product. (Maybe the reviewers with issues used baking soda?!) I used vanilla soy milk because it's what we use, and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Perfect. This is now my go-to pancake recipe. Thanks Chef John!

I was out of pancake mix this morning and looked for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for and found this gem.  I only substituted melted margarine for the butter and these came out amazing!  I cannot believe that I have been using boxed mix my whole life.  Never again!  Very easy, delicious, light, fluffy, perfect pancakes!  They were so good I had to make 2 batches, everyone gobbled them up so quick.  Next time I may add in blueberries or chocolate chips.  SO GOOD!

I left out the sugar and salt and they turned out awesome and fluffy.
I don't like to cook with salt and sugar would make them heavy and less fluffy.

These came out great!  Letting the batter rest really helps promote thick, fluffy pancakes.  Only change was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract - it really gives pancakes a wonderful flavor.

I followed this recipe to the letter and added 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract. The taste was as pleasing to the palate as it was to the nose. I also served them with sliced strawberries on top and shaped them to look like flower petals with a cold scoop of margarine serving as the center.

These surprised me. Every time I use an online recipe for pancakes, I feel like something "tastes" wrong. This actually came out perfectly. I did, however, make some adjustments because I didn't have baking powder...
1 teaspoon of baking soda (instead of baking powder)
1/2 a teaspoon of salt
unsalted butter 

Mainly because baking soda is pretty salty on its own, where as baking powder not so much.

These were great! Very similar to my mothers recipe, except hers had no salt and added some vanilla. I did add all the salt called for in this recipe, but out of instinct I upped the sugar and added some vanilla. I am glad I did, because they were still a little salty. My daughter noticed it, I thought they were delicious and the little salt taste went well with syrup and strawberries, but next time I might cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. Thanks John!!

I loved this recipe! I made both a store brand version and this and the from scratch version came out delicious and fluffy.  I'm not a pancake fan but my husband is and he loved it even better than the store bought.  I did add vanilla extract like some of the users had suggested.

Fantastic recipe!  It's absolutely perfect just as written.  I didn't use cooking spray though, but they did just fine in a bit of vegetable oil.  So fluffy and tender, just like diner flapjacks.  I have no clue why anyone wouldn't rate this 5 stars.

This are soooo good.   I substituted the sugar with liquid stevia, and i used 1/4c coconut flour and 1c all purpose flour.

What a great breakfast.

Thanks for sharing

I thought these were way too salty as well. I think there is way too much baking powder.
They were kind of a weird texture as well. Won't be making these again!

This was one of the best pancake recipes I have had. I took others recommendations and reduced the salt and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. They turned out nice and fluffy and tasted amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

I always bought a mix from the store, but, thank goodness, I don't have to do that ever again!  I put in 4Tbsp. of butter just because I love butter.  These were so delicious and just the right amount!  Even my kids, who "only like 'restaurant' panakes" loved them!  So easy AND so good.  You HAVE to try these!

I made this recipe and found the texture to be wonderful! I added blueberries for a bit of a change (dropped them in the batter while it was on the griddle).

Made these pancakes today; my family loved them. Asked, "did you do something different...these are really good!" Seems this recipe has more baking powder than many I've used in past. This is a keeper! Will add nuts, berries etc as ingredients/seasons allow.

This recipe is very good.  Easy to prepare, it makes a pancake that is slightly heavy and dense, yet tastes light.  One reason that my batter may have been  thicker is that I live in a very humid climate (SC), so the humidity in the air may have contributed a bit.  Overall, these pancakes were excellent.  This will be my "go-to" pancake recipe from now on.

This recipe has become my standard pancake and waffle mix. It is absolutely delicious! I do add a little cinnamon from time to time and fruit toppings with nuts and whip cream! This recipe when doubled also does well refrigerated in a covered container for use throughout a busy week, which is usually the case for me and my family.

Excellent recipe! Used 1 cup of Spelt flour and 1/2 cup of Brown Rice Flour, 1 Tablespoon of Agave,  Rice Milk instead of regular milk.  Why would you make pancakes from a package when you can make these? Yum!

I know it's lunch time but... It's a comforting feeling to have breakfast for lunch sometimes. I had just brought the Aunt Jamamima just add water mix and I know I'm much better then just add water! So I just made this batter and it's now on it's 5 minute resting period but I went a step further... By adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I will be posting pictures of the final results once it's complete... With my final review of the my pancakes!

This was a light fluffy pancake recipe that made a dozen pancakes.  It was too salty for both me and my husband who always adds salt to just about everything. I will decrease the salt to a half teaspoon and try it again.

Never have made pancakes from scratch because I thought it was "too much trouble". I followed this recipe to the tee, using unsalted butter, and not only were they light and fluffy, but beat out the rubbery box mix by a long shot. I thought the ingredients mixed together delightfully and were spot on. My dog and I enjoyed these very much!

I have kept trying to get pancakes down that will satisfy my son. He says 7 of 10 but of course he likes McDonald's and I refiuse to use mixes with partially hydrogenated oils.  They were great and fluffy! He does agree the best I have made.  Thanks for the tip on letting it stand for 5 minutes and the video was super helpful! I had never used my white..what I use as a strainer as a sifter which worked great.  Will definitely use as my staple pancake mix!

These tasted like baking soda, even with the addition of strawberries into the mixture.

The taste was pretty good, but I did find the slight taste of baking powder that others noticed. I was looking for a pancake that was fluffy and tender. I tried one batch at the 350 deg setting on my electric griddle, and one batch at 375 deg. The hotter griddle got a little more rise, and seemed a little more tender. 

I wouldn’t say that these were the best pancakes that I ever made, but for simple and quick Saturday morning pancakes, they’ll do the job.

If I could change anything, I would be very careful about how much pancake batter I put on the pan because it takes sooooo long to cook with a lot of batter. I also would be more patient when cooking the pancakes. I added blueberries and chocolate chips and my family loved it!

I always seek out Chef John's recipes first when I need a recipe. If he has a recipe for what I need to make I know it will be good! I made these pancakes for my son and his friends and they liked how thick and fluffy they were. Another winner!

This is now my go to pancake mix. The only thing I did after the first batch, I cut back on the salt. They were a little salty for my taste. I cut the salt in half and they were perfect.

This is no joke, I have tried almost every pancake recipe on here and this is the BEST! I tried it exactly as written, delicious. But we like really sweet stuff so I added in a total of 3 tablespoons of sugar, reduced the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons, increased butter to four tablespoons and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla. In my opinion they tasted like I HOP pancakes. I'll never go out for pancakes ever. Although I decreased the baking powder, I think it's the baking powder amount and the resting of the batter that makes these the best fluffy pancakes ever. Try it, You will not be sorry. Yummy! !

That was the version of this recipe that I followed, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING! Perfect crumb, moist and the addition of sugar with less baking powder made for a pancake with crispy edges. If you're going to use this recipe, follow that review!

I thought they were very good.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon since other reviewers thought too salty.  I don't think the vanilla was necessary.
My family likes blueberry pancakes so I added them as well,  I felt like it was missing something - maybe next time a little grated lemon zest.  Also I will try this recipe with buttermilk since I like the tang of buttermilk.  This is definitely a keeper.
I have never made pancakes from scratch, and now I see how easy it is I am not likely to buy boxed mix again.

Made this exactly as written. Very good basic pancake recipe. My 7 y.o. granddaughter loved her pancakes this morning. Next time I will add a little vanilla, and also try it with mashed bananas for variety.

I just made these pancakes this morning and they turned out pretty good. My kids gobbled them up faster than I could put them on the plate. The texture was nice and fluffy, but the flavor, in my opinion, needed something more to it. I may add vanilla extract next time or something else like blueberries to spice things up a bit. I would definitely use this recipe again to make  old-fashioned pancakes, but with some doctoring of the recipe to suit my tastes. The measurements are perfect to get the right consistency of fluffiness that I love in old-fashioned pancakes. A wonderful go-to recipe for a quick breakfast!

Very fluffy. I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of white, and had to add more milk.

Awesome! I only added ingredients to suit out taste. I added about a tsp if cinnamon & a two of vanilla. I might add more milk next time because they were pretty dense. So good!

This recipe is fantastic! They are thin, yet fluffy, and go just perfect with Vermont maple syrup.

For healthier pancakes, add whole wheat flour instead. Also, use some cream cheese for a thicker pancake.

The flavour of these pancakes was superb, old-fashioned and light-tasting.  The texture was not too dense as many pancake recipes are but I needed to add about 3/4 c more milk.  The batter was way too thick.

Made these today and husband said they were by far the best pancakes he’s eaten. Had to make one change, which I hate doing. Didn’t have regular milk so I used almond milk. They were still delicious. This will be the only pancake recipe I use from now on.

The best pancakes I've had in a while. 
This recipe is simple and delicious.
They come out super soft and fluffy and about ½ inch thick. I took the liberty of adding  cardamom and vanilla to the mixture and it's like eating a real cake.

Made these exactly as recipe stated, except I added a splash of vanilla to the liquid. My children are literally the pickiest eaters I’ve ever encountered and even they raved about these! Making them yet again because my daughter begged for them. My son described these by saying, “They taste so fresh!!” I totally agree. Excellent recipe!

These are special occasion pancakes. Very good but also incredibly rich. I cut the salt in half and made them with whole milk. Couldnt eat more than 2 they were so rich.

I made this recipe but used a little vanilla too. Amazing! My family loved them. Old fashioned flap jacks like my grandma used to make. Buttery,fluffy, and moist. I cook an egge first, then spread the batter over it for egg in a pancake!! Best recipe I've found yet!

Recently made these for our weekend breakfast, and was delighted with the fluffiness, still rich texture, flavor, and ease of preparation. I added some vanilla extract for extra oompf, and will try finely grated lemon peel next. Careful with the cooking temp though, and keep an eye on them even at low griddle temp.

These were good! Per reviewers' suggestions I subtracted one teaspoon of baking powder and added some extra sugar. They were really poofy, and every time I flipped them over, I kept thinking, "There's no way this has cooked all the way through!" but then I'd split it open, and it had. But for me personally, they were almost too thick; I just prefer thinner pancakes.

The batter as is comes out thicker than my cake batters which is disgusting for a pancake. I had to double the milk, triple the sugar, and add some vanilla to get them decent. I realize everyone has a different taste preference for pancakes. However, if you were looking for light, buttery and fluffy pancakes....keep looking for another recipe :-(

I make this to serve 8. I really like them, though so make two small changes. The mix came out a little dry the first time around, and the pancakes would come apart like a hamburger patty when they were cut in to. The taste was still great, but I like my pancakes to stay together. So the next time around, again for 8 servings, I added an extra 2/3 cup of milk and 1tbsp vanilla. It was perfect. They were still very thick, had a great flavor, were simple to make, and held together. Delicious.

Best pancakes recipe ,be it store bought mix or homemade,!!! Brown and rise beautifully.  even the middle was light and flaky.  If it helps others, the recipe makes 7 pancakes using 1/3 C each. I'll never go back to any store bought pancake mix again!!

Pretty much have nothing to eat in the house tonight except some flour, an egg, & 2 very ripe peaches. Decided I could turn it into pancakes & immediately did a search to see if Chef John had a recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states, & I can’t understand how it didn’t get 100% 5 star ratings. These are the best pancakes I’ve ever made. Light & fluffy, not sweet & not bitter. Absolutely delicious- once again, Chef John hits it out of the park.

This is an excellent recipe that I'll use from now on.  I wonder if the folks complaining about the bitterness used baking soda instead of baking powder.  I personally found it to be a bit sweet so i'll tweak the sugar, but that's always the case with recipes.  Adjust to personal taste.  Still a keeper in my book.

These are really good basic pancakes.  They're light and fluffy and really good as is.  I thinned the batter with a little milk because hubby doesn't like thick pancakes.  I also added a splash of vanilla because I love the taste.  That's what I like about this recipe...it allows for modification.  Next time I will try buttermilk or maybe some Bailey's Irish Cream.  ??

One small footnote.  If you use salted butter cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.

I will be replacing my box mix with this recipe. It was tasty,  quick and easy. I used a room temperature egg, about 1/8 tsp less salt and about 2 cups of milk to get the batter consistency I like (on the thinner side). The taste and texture of the pancakes was exactly how I like it and the whole family enjoyed them. I think buttermilk might make this a 5-star recipe.

I LOVED IT!!!! The pancakes were so light and fluffy!! I am a vegan so I made a few changes: almond milk, no butter, no eggs- instead i added 4oz of apple sauce, and I used extra virgin olive oil to grease the pan. For a healthy touch, I added a tablespoon of chia seeds .  It did taste a bit saltier than I am used to but I was fine with it. The rest of my family are meat eaters so next time I will make the recipe as recommended but   a 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of 1 tsp. Thank so much for sharing your recipe!!

I’ve tried Joy, Martha, and many other recipes. This is the first one I’ve tried that is a hit! The batter is perfect. The pancakes turn out fluffy and have the right crispness to the edges. Excellent flavor! I’m so glad this came up in a web search...perfect pancakes!

The best pancake recipe ever!  ;)

I made these for our first ever pancake Saturday this morning.  Dad has been raving about them all morning.  Sorry, I changed the recipe just a little because we always have buttermilk pancakes.  Used half buttermilk and a little extra milk so they weren't so thick and because I used buttermilk reduced the baking powder by 1/2 t. and added 1/2 t. soda.

I made these last night. I followed the recipe except I only put in 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I put in 2 tablespoons of white sugar and about 3 table spoons of butter.  I did not find them overly salty and could just taste a slight hint of salt.  I used salted butter also.  They were pretty thick so I added a little more milk until I got them to where I wanted them.  I think next time I'll go with 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, but that's all I would change.  They were very good for non-buttermilk pancake and I will make them again.

I was a little questionable about the amount of baking soda needed, but went ahead and followed the recipe as is. I agree with the other comments, there was definitely a chemical’ish taste. I did double up the recipe since it stated 4 servings, and had way more cakes than I needed. I will give it another try, next time cutting back on the baking soda, adding vanilla and sticking the original serving size recipe.

Great recipe. These came out perfect. I doubled and made adjustments as others suggested, so here is the DOUBLED recipe as I used it: 

3 cups all purpose flour
5 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
4 Tbsp sugar
1 stick of butter, melted (oh yeah, gonna hear about that one)
2 eggs
2 3/4 cups of milk (yes, I realize this is more than double)
1 tsp vanilla

I'm not by any means an experienced cook so I over cooled them a little. it was very rich and delicious. I doubled the recipe, used a 1/3 measuring cup for scooping and putting into the hot pan for cooking and added 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter. AMAZING!

Delicious!  No more bought pancake mix for us!  I am going to use a little less salt, maybe unsalted butter next time but, the recipe is delish.  (The only change I made per previous suggestions was to separate the egg, beat the egg white and fold it in to the batter.)  Delicious flaky pancakes and so easy.

These are amazing! I had these at a friends house and they blew my mind. I had my friend send me the recipe and I’m so glad I did! I also took the advice in the reviews and added a little vanilla and left out about 1/8 teaspoon for the salt and they are dreamy. My husband said they were the best pancakes he’s ever had!

I also used boxed pancake mix, the  day I ran out was the beginning of something great! I found this recipe made it, the best pancakes I ever had, I used salt-free butter, the only problem was the batter was way too much for just my husband n myself. I got an idea that worked perfectly! I made all the leftover pancake batter n froze the extra pancakes. So any time we wanted a pancake for breakfast we heated it in the microwave n was as good as just cooked! I'll never use box mix again, thank you so much!

I didn't have any pancake mix one day and I wanted to make pancakes for my daughter and I. I've never used mix again since. I occasionally adjust the amount of milk depending on whether I wanted thick or thin pancakes.

I followed this recipe exactly. These old fashioned pancakes were just as described... delicious, fluffy and tasting like childhood breakfasts! I'll make them again!

Recipe turned out great.  Used cream instead of milk but next time that I make it, I'll use milk.  Overall very nice recipe.

I was trying to cheer myself up by making pancakes.. these turned out way too salty, so now I'm still hungry & frustrated. 
My advice, use only 1-2 pinches of salt tops. I should have known something is off while looking at the recipe !

One of the best pancake recipes I've ever used. It's now a staple whenever I want to whip some up for breakfast!
Some tips and tricks that I always use:
- Make sure that you warm up your milk before adding in the melted butter. You don't want the butter solidifying while you add it into the milk!
- I personally like to add a splash of vanilla essence into the batter
- Use unsalted butter for this recipe! 
Hope you enjoy making these as much as we do at our home :)

Absolutely delicious!! Why would anyone buy box mix? These come together so quickly, shifting the flour makes all the difference in the world. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to some for the kids. The second time I made these I added fresh strawberries & blueberries before flipping the pancakes, delicious.  Thank you again Chef John!!

Tried this with coconut flour and almond milk - epic fail! Should warn this doesnt work, had to throw out a big bowl of batter, way too thick, diluted with more almond milk, never formed in frying pan enough to flip, so didappointing! Checked other recipes, they called for only 2 teas baking powder. And I had such a taste for pancakes!!!

Don't use salted butter in your mix use margarine instead or when u grease ur pan grease it with butter and use less salt in your mix baking powder and flour ratio should be 1 tsp for every full cup of flour(1/2 tap for 1/2 cup) then use vanilla extract 1/4 tsp and then follow the rest of directions.

I was out of milk but had almond milk on hand. Substituted the same amount. Also added a splash of vanilla (another person recommended it). They taste amazing! FYI the batter is really thick...

Easy recipe to follow. They were nice and fluffy which made them more filling. My only issue was is that they were a bit bitter. I am going to use this recipe again but add more sugar.

Edited 7/7/2017: I increased the sugar from 1 tbsp to 3 tbsp and they are no longer bitter tasting. Switched from a 4 to 5 start receipes

THANK YOU, Chef John! I've tried and failed with Mark Bittman's much lauded recipe, but I kept  trying, convinced it was me and not the recipe. It's Mark Bittman, after all! And the NY Times! Well, turns out, it was the recipe. 

THIS recipe uses the same ingredients BUT calls for 2x more baking powder and letting the batter rest. Those 2 things made all the difference.  I've done the full batch and a half batch, and the pancakes come out perfectly each time. Delicious. If you don't want to bother with melting butter and waiting for it to cool, you can substitute exact amount of  a neutral oil, like canola. I did, and yep--still perfect.

My whole family loves this recipe. I've  made it as is and also played around with the recipe. Using gf flour, coconut oil instead of butter, and real maple syrup instead of sugar was also a huge hit. I've added cinnamon, chocolate chips, pumpkin spice, blueberries, banana ....it's extremely versatile and fun to play around

A good basic pancake batter. I separated the egg white from the yolk and whipped the whites till they could hold a shape. I then folded them into the batter at the end. Makes them really fluffy.

These came out great! They were fluffy and the flavour was good. However, after halving the salt, the cakes were still the teeniest bit salty, so I wonder what it could have been with the full amount. I also worried that I was using excessive baking powder,  but FOLLOW THE RECIPE, it's how it puffs up and gets fluffy. Moreover,  make sure to put all the wet ingredients at once (as I did not) or the batter will be rather lumpy. Overall, a great recipe that I will be making again!

Was craving pancakes but didn't have any box mix so I went the homemade route. After this recipe I don't think I can ever eat box mix again. They came out perfect and aren't too thin or too runny. I guess if you wanted them to be thinner add a little more milk? I used a pinch of salt versus the full teaspoon.

While this is a pretty good base to start from, I take the recipe a little futher by adding  a tablespoon or so of lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla as my basic pancake recipe. From there, depending on my taste, I would add Raisins, Apple, Strawberries, etc or maybe chocolate chips for my grandaughters when they stay over.

I do enjoy these pancakes, but I make a few adjustments. I use half of the salt that it recommends. I also do not let the batter rest.  I found that it becomes too thick. The only time I give the batter is while the pan heats up.

I wanted simple pancakes and this recipe fits the need.

This recipe doubled nicely. However, I was hesitant to put double the salt. I mixed it up with one teaspoon, cooked on pancake, tasted the pancake, then added half a teaspoon, cooked a pancake, and tasted. I didn't feel the need to add the remaining half teaspoon. While the pancakes, as described were perfectly tasty, I did add vanilla extract to just add a little something.

But let me make this very clear! The recipe is great as described. I only added the vanilla to the last few pancakes.

The only reason I assigned 4 stars, instead of five, is because I did not use two full teaspoons of salt. You can always add more salt but you can't take it away?

So delicious! Hubby makes them almost every Sunday :). We turn the milk into 'buttermilk' by replacing about 2T of the milk with lemon juice and letting it set a few minutes. Makes them just that much fluffier!

This is by far my favorite pancake recipe yet! These are light and fluffy and they don't dry out like a lot of pancake recipes do. I usually add a teaspoon of vanilla and they  come out great.

Super fluffy! I added a few dashes of cinnamon and a little over 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Delicious and easy to make. I don't think I'll ever use boxed mix again.

I wonder if the chemical taste everyone is complaining about is due to baking powder with aluminum.  I use aluminum free baking powder and did not have this issue.   Maybe use natural salt without iodine.  I use pink himalayan  or "Real" salt I never use "Morton's" or other refined white salt.  * Fluffy & Thick - Everyone loved them.

Best pancakes ever!!!! Some tweaks I made due to personal preference. Increased sugar to 1 1/2 tbsp, used unsalted butter and added 1 tbsp vanilla. I also used clarified butter instead of cooking spray for the pan due to the high smoke point. It may seem like a lot of baking powder and the batter will be thick but this contributes to the end result being deliciously fluffy pancakes. And don't skip the resting part after mixing!! Not a single over cooked pancake out of the batch. Topped with pure maple syrup infused with a cinnamon stick, best pancakes I ever made!

I have made this recipe many times, mostly bc I thought my kids liked it.  I don't eat pancakes and my husband doesn't like these. It was only when I actually tasted them that I stopped making them. You really do taste the baking powder and they are so fluffy they are difficult to cook evenly. Like I said, I have made this recipe many many times, so I have tried my best to trouble shoot that from my cooking end. I am looking for a less fluffy option.

Super easy to put together and the family raved about my pancakes.   Having been an "Aunt Jemima" girl up until now and not having any mix this morning, I was lucky to come across this recipe.   No more MIX for me!   This will be the go-to forever!!!

Love this recipe.  I only use a quarter of the salt, Splenda blend instead of sugar (my husband is diabetic),  and white whole wheat flour (again for my husband).   Always comes out nice and fluffy, no blood sugar spikes, and I freeze what doesn't get eaten right off the griddle.  Pop them into a toaster or toaster oven and they're just as good as fresh!  Love them with homemade fresh blueberry syrup (just blueberries sautéed with a bit of Splenda and water).

The batter is too thick, I think the flour measurements for this recipe are off.Just 1 cup would do or else your pancakes will look like cardboard. I fixed it by adding baking soda and alot more milk but I will not be making this recipe again.

They reminded me of the pancakes my grandmother made when I was a kid. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the batter. I know it sounds strange but it brings out the flavor of the other ingredients.

My batter and first batch turned out too thick. But thanks to the great video I thinned out the rest of the batter with milk until it looked like his and they turned out delicious.  Fluffy without the buttermilk tang. Thanks!

I have tried a variety of Pancake Batter recipes, this definitely is the best. They actually are fluffy & moist. I made it according to the recipe & to my own liking ( w/spices & vanilla) and both came out GREAT. After the 1st time I made it, I cut back on the salt especially when using salted butter because I think it was a little too salty. I can even refrigerate these pancakes, warm up the next morning and they're still good.

So hungry for pancakes, but  NO MIX!! Have never had a Chef John recipe ever fail, so I used this recipe with a  slight variation: added 1 Tbs. vanilla extract, and 3 Tbs. sugar. No need for syrup!  Hubby preferred these to the mix. Thanks to Chef John, we always enjoy ;)

I didn't like this one. I am not a fan of cakey things. This was more like muffin than pancake. It was thick and doughy during prep and once cooked, they were not like a light pancake. Never again.

The recipe was so easy and they turned out very light and fluffy. I immediately added this recipe to my list of favorites. When I read the reviews a lot of people said that they had too much salt so I only used 1/2 of teaspoon of salt and only 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Besides that they were AMAZING!!

Too much baking powder! Not soda, but powder, just as the recipe describes. I made these for my husband's birthday breakfast. I questioned the amount when I was adding it, but decided to have faith and follow the directions. The pancakes were fluffy and looked great, but I could really taste the baking powder. Maybe some people don't mind the after taste...but I really do. I would try this recipe again with half the recommended amount of baking powder.

After  experimenting with 4 different recipes, my son and I finally found the perfect thick and fluffy pancakes.  We used coconut oil in place of cooking spary. Thank you Chef John for sharing.

I made these following the directions and they were great!  We have never bought pancake mix since this.   I make these for my family and on cub scout camp-outs all the time.  I have since altered the recipe for our own needs, but it is great the way it is.

I read the reviews before I made it and added only 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I substituted the egg for a banana, added a teaspoon of vanilla and doubled the sugar. They came out great! Excellent base recipe if anything, tweaking it to suit your needs really will improve the overall quality.

Adjusted serving size to 6 and then rounded all ingredients to nearest full measure for simplicity.  I also blend half spelt and half white flour to make more nutritious/healthy.  The kids love them and has become a Saturday morning tradition.

FLUFFY FLUFFY FLUFFY Yum!
Zero changes for the recipe are needed. It stands perfect as is. I never made home made pancakes , or from a box for that matter, because they were never fluffy enough for me but with this super simple recipe the problem is solved. Not too sweet, not too bland, just simply delicious. Thank you  Chef John. This recipe will be handed down. Ps.  I do not use cooking spray.

In the video he obviously used more than a tablespoon of sugar... I used 1/3 cup sugar and slightly warmed my milk in the microwave before mixing all the wet ingredients together (so that the melted butter wouldn't re-solidify). AWESOME!

Best pancakes I've ever made.  Followed recipe as is but did cut back (about 1/2-3/4 tsp) on salt as we like less salt.  Fluffy, good tasting and easy to make.

Great recipe. Was my first time attempting American Style pancakes. 
Adapted is slightly by adding another half cup of milk, and cutting down the sugar to a teaspoon and the salt to a pinch.

My kids love these. We don't even use syrup with these. We mix cinnamon chips in instead. Usually we usually make a triple batch and freeze them then thaw them out as needed. Two days ago we made a double batch and they were fine that night.

I made this recipe with Bob's One-to-One gluten free flour (because I'm Celiac) and they were the best pancakes I've ever had (even better than any I'd had before I discovered I was Celiac 4 years ago).  No joke.

Excellent!!  I'm an experienced cook but I always seem to make terrible pancakes.  My daughter wanted pancakes for her birthday breakfast and these turned out perfectly!  I made half with the batter as written (though I did add a touch of vanilla) and then I added a little milk and made the other half of the batch somewhat thinner.  So so good!

Too Salty!!!!! I followed the recipe to the T. Next time I will reduce the baking soda to 1tsp, no salt, and add more sugar. Hopefully that will make them better the next time I try this. My husband and daughter (both pancake lovers) refused to finish the pancakes.

This recipe is awesome! I don't know what happened with the other people who gave this a low rating but you should probably check your griddle for a chemical it's burning into your food. You might have a bigger problem then tasting pancakes. If it's too salty you got the sugar in the salt mixed up. Fix your cooking not the recipe.

You really don't need to change a thing with this recipe! I used vegetable oil instead of butter, but that's just what I always do. Great either way

This is my favorite pancake recipe! They're so light and fluffy! And they taste great! I do add just a splash of vanilla extract to add a little sweetness, but that's the only thing I do different from this recipe. This is a snow day tradition in my house! :-)

I just made this and I like the consistency of the pancakes, however, I'm not a fan of the all the baking powder! I taste nothing but baking powder and I added a Tsp of vanilla to the mixture. I followed the directions exactly and I just personally find it to have to much baking powder, otherwise I like them.

I added a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk and let it stand five minutes. I halved the baking powder and added a half table spoon baking soda. I doubled the amount of sugar for the kids. Turned out fluffy and delicious.

I make these almost every weekend.  They are the best.  Easy and always turn out perfect.  Hardly any more work than a box and I always found the box pancakes were too thick or too thin or something not right.  Love this and so highly recommend them.  Don't tell Grandma but they're better than her recipe!

I am gluten sensitive and dairy and sugar intolerant and I make this recipe with buckwheat flour and substitute the dairy with almond milk and coconut oil and the sugar with coconut palm sugar and they come out great every time! To top the pancakes I have used maple syrup or homemade applebutter. They taste and look amazing!

very good, no changes.  Yes a lot like boxed. but if you have no box mix a good quick alternative.

made it a second time and it was runny and I ended up throwing the batter away.  does it really make a difference to add the dry to the wet instead of the wet to the dry?  that is the only thing I did different

I made the mistake of making these. No more add water pancakes for my family. Once you have these there is no going back. They are super easy to make and taste SOOO good. I have been trying to cook a little more healthy so I substitute some (not more than half)  of the all purpose flour for a combination of whole wheat and almond flour. I also add 1 tsp vanilla.

I liked this recipe. But my only thing  is that the finished batter was a little firm and I had to add a little milk. But I still LOVED it!

Very tasty! It's a pretty thick batter so it doesn't have as much crispy brown on the outside as I like, but they're fluffy and hold up well to toppings.

This is our go to pancake recipe and is very close to the amazing pancakes I remember my neighbor and close family friend making when growing up.  I have also made these several times and added various pureed vegetables to for added nutrition for my kids.  For most pureed vegetables (sweet potato, pumpkin) I didn't change anything with the recipe, unless it needed firming up then I'd add more flour.  For  "magic green pancakes" I'd puree spinach with just enough water to liquefy it, then added an extra egg and about 1/2 cup of flour.        Love that they can be freezed and are nice and thick for easy reheating in the toaster.

Pancake Notes...I use canola oil vs. butter.   Also,  separate egg(s).  I would use 2 eggs here.   Beat egg whites to stiff peaks; set aside.   Whisk egg yolks, milk, and canola oil together, in large bowl, until frothy.   Add sifted dry ingredients and whisk together.  FOLD in beaten egg whites.   Fry cakes as instructed.  Further note...sometimes the situation requires my using a pancake mix but I will add 1-2 eggs.  Separate the egg(s), add the yolks with liquid ingredients, whisk the whites to stiff peaks and fold into batter just before cooking.  This little trick makes these box-mix pancakes so much lighter and fluffier.  Give it a try.

Awesome I make these for both me ( full sized) and my 1 year old ( dollar sized.) they come out thick and fluffy. Hacked a ziplock bag to "pour" into the pan because this batter is thick. Key is to let it rest properly for at least 5 minutes like the recipe says. i gave it a little more and they turn out fantastic.

Better than IHOP. Better than Krusteaz. These pancakes are the bomb! Easy to make, all ingredients on hand. Don't forget to sift! I think that's the secret. I soured my milk with one tablespoon of vinegar, but that was the ONLY modification. Hubby wanted pancakes, and boy did I get tons of praise! Chef John, Thanks Again!

Delicious!  I did freak out when I made as directed & batter was super thick. It wouldn't even pour!  After reading more reviews I added more milk (3/4 to make it a full 2 cups) and 2 tsp of vanilla. With those additions =perfect pancakes. I want to try again with a dash of nutmeg!

We make these all the time!  They are great as is.  As a personal preference, I usually add vanilla.  We also occasionally 'accidentally' add too much butter and sugar, and dump in a bunch of chocolate chips.

Pancakes the way they were meant to be. They're fluffy, tender, and so very easy. I made them for my mom, a lifelong devotee of Bisquick, and they convinced her to give up the box. Lately I've substituted the all-purpose flour for an equal amount of white whole wheat and no one knew the difference -- just have to add a little bit more milk to get the consistency right.

I have made these pancakes multiple times and they are fantastic! Don't tell my mother, but this recipe has even replaced  her from-scratch pancake recipe! There are no substitutions necessary, except for the possible addition of blueberries.

They were very good. I cut the salt back by half the amount . And took out a small amount of the batter for me and added blueberries. Hubby likes his plain . I was skeptical of how they would taste as the batter seemed lumpy with flour and I thought it would reflect the taste , but it did not . The reason I made this is because my pancake box mix had expired . And I wanted pancakes! So this was quick and better than all the preservatives and additives a boxed has .

These pancakes were phenomenal! All I did was substitute Parkay spray for the butter, zero calorie sweetener for the sugar, I added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was amazing and my daughter absolutely loved it.

First time I followed the recipe to a tee.  Other than a little too much baking powder, this was perfect, hence only four stars.  Every time I have made them, they have come out great. Just follow what other reviewers suggest about less baking powder.  Oh, and I forgot to put sugar in them the last time, and these tasted great still.

We thought they were divine!  The only change I always make is to use 3/4 cup buttermilk + 3/4 cup skim and they are just perfect.  I've also added a small can of pumkin puree with a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, 1/4 cup brown sugar and a little extra milk for great pumpkin pancakes.  Thanks for sharing!

I added some vanilla extract and cinnamon to it. Then baked it in the oven in a cake pan I have that makes 6 little cakes at 350 for about half an hour. Check with a toothpick to make sure there's no runny mix in the middle. Delicious!!

This recipe is amazing! Thank you Chef John ^^
Buuuut I did tweek it a little.
I thought at one point that 3 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder was too much, also with one batch I made the pancakes had sort of a slight baking powder smell after taste to me when they were cooled down so in my recent batch I used only 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and let the batter sit for a few mins and they still came out GREAT!!! ^^
Also I LOve butter so I used a whole stick lol
And!! I use a little bit of canola oil to cook my pancakes in because I like the crispy edges they produce from it.
But this recipe if done my way comes out soo delicious.
Usually with box stuff I had to use a bunch of butter and syrup just so that they would taste decent but with this I only needed a little syrup which made me happy and next time i'll try different toppings and such.

Literally my ‘go to’ pancake mix. I love it so much, I almost have it memorized. The pancakes are super fluffy, with the right texture and taste. I do put 1/2 a tsp less of salt ( so only 1/2 a tsp), but that is the ONLY alteration I make. Top with some butter maybe a sprinkle of cinnamon and BAM! Perfect pancakes!

Not our favorite.  Followed recipe to a T.  My two year old wouldn't eat them, even with chocolate chips in them.  Not much flavor and too dense.

We always use Bisquick or Krusteaz...not anymore.  I told my husband to never lose this recipe as I was begging him to make more for our family.  I'll be requesting this pancake recipe from now on.  We also mixed in fresh blueberries into the mix...yummmmmy.  Restaurant quality recipe.

Like many others, looked for a recipe because I was out of our traditional pancake mix. So glad I came upon this version. It is so yummy, my husband even requested pancakes for dinner :)

I loved the flavor in these .. they didnt come out super thick probably because I doubled the recipe but skimped a little on the baking powder. I will be making these often! Delicious..

Okay, I made these for breakfast today.  I did use half of the salt and I used a 1/4 cup to measure out each one.  It yielded 9 pancakes.  They were nice and thick but when you consider that most pancake recipes have basically the same ingredients, they are nothing special.  Next time, I will add blueberries to boost the flavor.

Made this recipe tonight and it was a huge hit! Light fluffy and yummy! The batter does look different than typical pancake batters in that it is thicker but it was amazing!

I haven't made pancakes from scratch for years, but didn't have any mix this morning and decided to try these,  I followed the recipe to a "T" and then added a chopped ripe banana.  They were melt in your mouth!!  My grandsons thought they were very good too and they are VERY picky eaters.

Follow the recipe exactly as written and you will not be disappointed.  Don't sour the milk or add vanilla if you don't know what you're doing.  Otherwise you can expect it to come out not as good as expected!

I love the recipe, but it was to thick for me, and it took a long time to cook all the way threw the pancakes. So I added more milk and played around till I got how I like my pancake batter.

I make a double batch every Saturday. We love them and I love that I can make them from what I always have on hand! If you get inconsistent results (I definitely have), here are my suggestions: 

1. Replace butter with vegetable oil or warm the milk. I found that when I mixed the melted butter with cold milk, it rehardened. I started using vegetable oil instead and my results have been better. I cook them in butter to get some butter flavor back.

2. Add milk gradually and get familiar with you preferred batter thickness. I don't know if my flour and milk measuring skills are poor or what, but sometimes these are perfect and sometimes too thin. For me it came down to having too much milk on the thin days, so I pour the milk in a little at a time and keep an eye on the consistency.

And if are little short on milk, don't be shy about adding water. Just add gradually and watch the consistency and it will work out fine.

Amazing.  I used spelt flour in place of AP flour. Coconut oil in place of butter. Soured milk. And 2 tablespoons cornstarch added to the flour. The pancakes turned out so amazing and fluffy. I threw in some chopped pecans and walnuts. Topped w cream cheese and maple syrup. May sound strange. But oh so good. My kids and hubby polished them off

This has become my go-to recipe for pancakes - it's really good and a super easy recipe.  I have 2 kids that are gluten free and I got sick of buying the boxed mix.  I just substitute my GF flour into this recipe & add some xanthan gum - couldn't be easier.

These pancakes are amazing! I used half the salt because they were a little salty but otherwise they blew me away! So much better than boxed!

Pancakes had great texture and consistency.  Holy cow, they're thick!  :-)  Not crazy about the taste...  I think the flour was a bit on the old side, I used 2% milk instead of whole and margarine instead of butter.  They were pretty dry and had a kind of flour taste to them....  I will try again with real butter, whole milk and new flour.

My daughter and I really love watching Chef John's videos and trying out his recipes (they look SO good in the videos!)
We made these pancakes by following the recipe except I threw in a teaspoon of vanilla since I like it.
The pancakes have a wonderful light, fluffy texture. A real hit with the kids who ate a lot more of them than they do the boxed mix. It cooks well too on the griddle..nice thick batter.
Thanks again Chef John! :)

Updated do not use cake flour in place of all purpose.

These turned out great! And you always have the ingredients on hand. They were very fluffy. I'll never buy boxed mix again.  I could see why some people are saying they were too salty; I was getting a hint of that when I tasted them so do not add a heaping teaspoon of salt to these or they will be too salty.  A little less than a teaspoon is perfect.

Not the best pancakes I have ever had. I decreased the salt like other reviewers said and it was still too salty for my taste. Didn't fluff up like I was expecting.

It's a great recipe to start from, but in my opinion it needs some small adjustments. I think, following this recipe, the batter is too thick, the amount of milk and flour should at least be equal. It can also use some more sugar. I also added a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla for the extra kick. Thanks for sharing!

It came out waaay too SALTY. I had to use condensed milk with some water because I was out of milk but it came out really bad. I had to guess the milk amount because it wasn't specified in the recipe.

This is pretty close to the recipe that I use without measuring exactly. It's WONDERFUL. I add a bit of vanilla with the wet ingredients, though, and that gives it a little sweeter flavor. My family loves it!

I am dairy and soy free for my daughter (I'm breastfeeding) so I substituted coconut oil for the butter and rice milk for the milk. This was so delicious I could not tell it was soy/dairy free! I used pure maple syrup.... Yummmmm!!!!

Followed this recipe exactly and these pancakes came out perfectly. Now it is the only pancake recipe we use. Sometimes we add chocolate chips or cinnamon chips to the batter. These pancakes are delicious.

All the pancakes I have made so far were mediocre. This recipe made the best pancakes I have ever tasted. (Including those in diners!) I followed it to a t, and they came out wonderful! A few tips: Use a 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. The batter is also thick enough to put into a bag and pipe onto the pan in letters and shapes, which my family loves. I would recommend putting in half the amount of salt called for. This doesn't seem to affect the chemistry, and it ensures that the cakes don't turn out salty and disgusting. Finally, these taste really good when you mix in fresh blueberries, chocolate chips, or apples and cinnamon!

This is my only from scratch recipe, these are THE BEST. Tonite I was low on milk and real butter and used some water and margarine-NEVER AGAIN. Totally not the same, definitely always use milk and real butter or you won't get the light fluffy wonderfulness this recipe gives. Thank you!!!

we have used this recipe SEVERAL times.and I realized i should leave a review on what i do.We have a gluten free/dairy free soy free diet.I used gf/df/sf all purpose flour(mine is from the book "cooking for isaiah") and almond milk .for the butter i use either coconut butter or earth balance soyfree.the pancakes turn out awesome!they are still fluffy and delicious.i notice toward the end of the batch i have to add a little water to thin it out. it starts to get to thick.

Nice, fluffy, 'box-style' pancakes. For the average pancaker the batter might be a bit thick, if so just add tablespoons of milk until it looks right to you. I used 3 tablespoons of baking powder, 2 tablespoons of sugar and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla for a nice classic pancake meal that tasted good even when I ran out of syrup. 

In addition to all the classics (blueberries, chocolate chips, etc) you can use coconut or other oils in place of butter which gives the dough a nice consistency and flavor with some added health benefits(depending on the oil). One nice part about this recipe is that for some reason they don't burn very easily. Great for absent-minded flap-jack-flippers. Happy Cooking!

Not sure what people did that made this recipe too salty. This was a hit in my house. If your batter is too thick use a little more milk to thin it out. Don't rate a good recipe low because of your error.

This is a quick and easy recipe for good homemade pancakes.  A quick read of the ingredients list on a box of pancake mix would convince most anyone that making your own is well worth the effort.

My family loves these pancakes!! I have been making this recipe for about a year now. I had someone give us a box of pancake mix and no one in the house liked them i ended up tossing it out.  When i make them I make double batch n the kids have some for the next day as well. They hold up well. Ill never use box again.

This is my favorite basic recipe! I tweak it as desired, too:
- I like sweet pancakes though so add 4 tablespoons sugar. lol.  
- When I am low on butter, I substitute the 3 tablespoons butter for 3 tablespoons oil. 
- I usually don't add whole eggs but egg whites. A little less than 2 tablespoons of egg whites in place of one egg. 
- Sometimes I use almond milk since I'm not a fan of cow milk.

We ran out of pancake mix so I surfed the web for a good recipe. I looked at a ton, and I am so glad we liked this one! I added a dash more milk than called for, and a sprinkle of vanilla. Also, I substituted self-rising for all purpose, salt, and baking powder. I recommend sifting the flour, even if it's pre-sifted! Super EASY and super DELICIOUS! My grandfather loved his breakfast in bed... We will have to keep this recipe for sure!!

I'm a pro chef and do like this recipe. My wife used to make pre mix. Now she only uses this recipe as do my mother. As another poster said also works great with margarine and lactose free milk as I'm dairy intolerant.
100% recommended.

My family loves these pancakes! The only thing I've done different is I use gluten free flour and I had to up the milk to 2 cups, with the brand of gluten free flour I use it made the batter so think it wouldn't pour. Also making the gluten free they are huge and fluffy. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent Pancakes!  I also make an alternate version using Almond milk, honey and coconut oil.  They also make excellent waffles. Great for a novice or a pro, never fail pancakes!

I've been trying to cook foods with 'cleaner' ingredients. So i substituted whole milk with almond milk and all purpose flour with whole wheat flower and butter with coconut oil. My 8 year old daughter loved them so much that she asks for them each weekend.

This is a great recipe.  The cakes are buttery with just the right hint of salt.  I fix them for family and visitors and always get compliments.  The only change I've ever made to the recipe is to add about a cup of frozen (thawed) blueberries to the wet mix.  Good stuff!

Very easy but very good. Light, fluffy and nicely flavored. I may try some add-ins next time. Mixed up and cooked in less than 15 minutes. No more box mix in this house!

I basically did everything except I didn't have any milk at home so I used a little less than 1/2 a cup of condensed milk and added enough water to make 1 1/4 cup and to dilute it. They came out really fluffy, a little thick but I liked it. I would make this recipe again!

I absolutely love these pancakes & I can't cook! I even made these for company & they loved them, too.  I've made them enough now that I've tried subsitutions for taste & nutrition. I use whole wheat flour, sugar substitute & unsweetened applesauce, instead of butter. I usually throw a little cinnamon in along with about a tsp of real vanilla - and fruit if I have it. They are light & fluffy & the perfect amount of sweetness. They make me look like a great cook!

Hey Chef John, This is almost the recipe from my grandmother's 1940's cookbook which I've been using for years.  Light delicate and without that Bisquick flavor the boxed mix gives.  The only way to go!  Thanks for bringing it back

Great basic recipe. I did think it was a bit heavy on the salt so I cut that back by half and added vanilla but so easy and a great texture.

Perhaps it was because this was the first "hot" breakfast we've had in a few weeks, but these sure went well for breakfast this morning! We just got back from vacation so I swapped in evaporated milk to avoid a trip to the store. Also, I halved the recipe but still used the entire egg. They were perfectly fluffy and tender--just the way a pancake should be!

Excellent - even my husband liked them, and he is not a breakfast foods person. It was nice to find an easy recipe that used ingredients I normally kept in my kitchen instead of buying the mix.

WOW! I tried these more than 3 times and they are amazing. If you don't want your pancakes too thick I'd back off a little on the baking powder. But for the most part follow everything to the lasr exact detail. I saw that a few reviews said it was too salty for just 1 teaspoon of salt and they were wrong. I think it needs the salt. You could add unsalted butter like some of the reviews said. These were great pancakes. The sifting part REALLY does work.

it was okay, once i adjusted it. as written, it was WAY too thick, and was salty and slightly bitter. i watered it down a little and added another egg, and it turned out alright. this would have been 1 or 2 stars, but the pancakes were light and fluffy, as described, so i gave it 3.

It's a great start for a pancake recipe. It definitely needs some tweaking. I had a bunch of fresh blueberries that I needed to get rid of. I just added them and a little more milk to play with the consistency.

This is a good basic recipe that's easy to modify to your own tastes. I prefer a thicker batter so just used 1C milk.  Making these again today and will throw in some blueberries this time.

Can't believe I've been buying pancake mix all these years! I already have all these ingredients in the house.....duh! And I control the quality of the ingredients without the added chemicals! These were beautiful pancakes and the kids gobbled them up faster than I could make them. No more buying pre-made mix for this house! It's a total win-win. Kid approved, taste/texture perfect, and a cost savings. Make them. You won't be disappointed.

I make these pancakes all the time! I absolutely love them. I'm not good with modifying recipes, but luckily, this recipe doesn't need any changing. The given measurements end up making about 6-8 large pancakes. They're super thick too, but still light and fluffy. They soak up syrup like nobody's business. Way better than store-bought pancake mix!

These Pancakes are INCREDIBLE!  Instead of using the salt I just used salted butter and it turned out great.  They have great consitency, amazing flavor, and an incredible crust!

We will never go back to box pancakes! I didn't put in any salt. Added blueberries, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract  and used real pure maple syrup!

I doubled this recipe not realizing that I didn't have enough milk to do so. I ended up using 1 1/4 cups almond milk (I usually use almond milk in recipes), 3/4 cups water, and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt. It turns out that the Greek yogurt added a phenomenal depth of flavor and moisture to these pancakes. I would totally recommend substituting some milk for yogurt if you make this.

It is slightly different than a boxed mix. I added another tablespoon of sugar & a hint of vanilla extract, like other reviewers said. I will omit the salt next time. I only added 1 cup of milk cuz the batter was already thinner than I expected. When I let it sit, it did thicken a bit & the longer it sat while I was making the pancakes, the lumpier it got. I was worried that the pancakes will not cook through, but they came out fluffy like everybody said. I think I'll skip the boxed version because I enjoyed making it :)

Like other reviews, I added a small bit of vanilla. These turned out very good. Cooked them in a little shortening to get the edges crispy.

I really like this recipe!! So easy, and they turn out perfect! Some of the other pancake recipes I've tried in the past are too complicated, and on a weekend morning, I just want pancakes that are yummy, quick on time, and don't come from a package! Would definitely recommend giving this recipe a shot! I've made them once with chocolate chips, and once with bananas too! Mmmm!

Since the first time I tried this recipe this is the only pancake recipe I have used. I have made these pancakes easily several dozen times as written. Today however, I realized I was out of butter and had to substitute Country Crock. Much to my surprise this took the pancakes to a whole new level of delicious. They were extra fluffy, perfect texture and my kids devoured them quicker than I could put them on the plate.

Everybody in the house enjoyed these pancakes!  We tried them plain, with blueberries and with chocolate chips.  (I added the blueberries or chips after the batter had rested for the five minutes).  They are a delicious choice and just as easy to make as a box mix.  They will be a new favorite on Sunday mornings!

LOVE this recipe! I've been using it for the past 3 Pancake Sundays, with perfect results every time! Followed the recipe to a T the first two times, added a little vanilla last time, and this time, I will add strawberries :)  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, Chef John!

These were easy, forgiving, and delicious!  I used oil instead of butter and had to use powdered milk and water.  I had just returned home from vacation and the fridge was almost empty.  I was still able to whip these up.  I did add some vanilla and upon reflection realize that I totally forgot to add the salt.  I didn't miss it.  They were very puffy, light, and perfect.  The batter does seem a tad thick, but they do not taste thick or gummy at all.  I will make these instead of my normal buttermilk pancakes on occasion.

I made these exactly as instructed. Delicious! Better than any box mix. The family plowed through them in no time flat. A big hit with the kids. For a few pancakes, I added a few blueberries to the batter after scooping it onto the grill, and they were fabulous.

Well, I thought these were great! I didn't taste much of the salt at ALL. They were light and fluffy, and my two year old who is very picky at times loves them. You won't be disappointed. Unless you're as picky as a toddler.

These were very light and fluffy. I would add less salt next time though, realized after adding the salt I only had salted butter and it was a bit much. I can't have regular milk so I used vanilla soy milk and it was very good! Would be really good with cinnamon added too.

Don't do 1 tsp of salt! that is waaaaay too much but you can do 3 pinches instead and the flavor of these pancakes are delicate and delicious! follow the recipe accordingly minus the salt, kudos to the chef!

These are really tasty!! The best pancakes I have had in years!
But.... they needed a LOT more milk. I doubled the recipe and added over 1.5c more milk, so over 3/4c more per single recipe. [only reason it's not 5*, this is a fairly big difference]
I also added about a .5 tsp of vanilla extract. YUM!!

Me: "These taste just like the boxed stuff, I love them!"
My Mom: "These are NOT liked the boxed stuff, I hate the boxed stuff!" ;)

So either way, if you liked the boxed stuff and want something like it, or want something different from the boxed stuff, these are the pancakes for you! So easy, so delicious, these pancakes are a hit! :D

I usually bomb when making pancakes, don't know why, but this recipe was fool proof! :)  It made just enough for my husband and I.  I followed it to the letter and they were good!  Not grainy, heavy... light and fluffy!  Highly recommend!

Better than box mix.  No ingredients I cannot pronounce and I can customize any way I want.  Used the recipe with no modifications first time and everything was perfect.  added to my recipe box and will he using again.  Leftovers are good for a grab and go breakfast with some peanut butter spread on top and folded like a taco.

Absolutely Delicious. I ran out of my usual boxed pancake mix. So I searched for a simple recipe. I followed the recipe as is except I added half a cup of more milk because the batter was thick. I also added chocolate chips in the batter. Other than that these came out yummy !! I also followed chef John recommendation to pour some butter, which was the icing on the pancakes. My kids and I devoured them. I am not going back to the boxed mix again. Thanks for the recipe Chef John !!

At last, I have made the perfect pancake!  Delicious even without extra butter and no syrup.  I did substitute approx. one tablespoon yellow cornmeal for equal amount of flour for a slightly crunchy taste.

I didn't realize it, but this is the exact same recipe I've been using for years. I've tried many many pancake recipes and this one is far and away the best one. I usually add a couple drops of vanilla extract to the batter and they always turn out great.

My sister had a rough night last night and I decided I would wake her up with some pancakes, we were out of box so I looked these up and my sister and I both agree, these are the best pancakes we have ever had, they were fluffy and filling, except we decided to add some chocolate chips to the mix. Still delicious, great recipe!

Perfect pancakes every time! Though I do make some adjustments. Being Lactose intolerant, I substitute soy milk for regular milk, replace half the amount of butter with oil and the other half with applesauce. I like to add a little vanilla, some cinnamon, and I also use avocado honey as a substitute for sugar. I love the flavor that the honey brings. Try these substitutions even if you are not lactose intolerant, you will not be disappointed.

This has to be my least favorite American pancakes recipe (I live in Sweden have worked my way through plenty). However well I cooked them, the inside always turned out mushy, rather than fluffy. The granulates of butter melting independently inside was interesting, but I'd do it with much less baking powder.

Went to this website and follow the instruction but why it turn out salty.

Two thumbs up! This recipe is so incredibly simple and tasty. I like my pancakes thick and fluffy and these were just fantastic. I aways have staples (flour, baking powder, sugar, etc) on hand, so i decided to throw these together. After reading some reviews, i did decrease the salt and added a little vanilla and they were a big hit. Will definitely make these again.

I have made these twice.  I used the recommended amount of b. powder, but used a scant t. salt ~ 1 t. seemed a little much, and as I would with most pancake recipes, I added some extra sugar (think super-heaping tablespoon).  And of course, just like any other pancake recipe or box mix:  Add more milk to get your desired consistency.  I think they are great!  I love how thick they get.

I made these pancakes for me and my fiance, and we both loved them. They were light and fluffy, and just the right amount of buttery. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and next time I will probably cut the salt down to 1/2 a teaspoon. Other than that these pancakes were perfect:) I will definitely add them to my recipe list and make them again.

Love these. They fluff up nicely and taste good. Very easy to make. I like making these at home instead of buying mix. Perfect!

Thank you. Excellent recipe. I have not made pancakes from scratch for decades now. On Friday, I saw this recipe and told my wife:"I'm making the pancakes on Sunday!". She always uses the ready-mix and was probably worried I would leave the kitchen in a big mess. Nope! Mixed, cooked and cleaned for her and she actually was able to enjoy breakfast for a change.  ;-)

I made a double batch to freeze for busy school mornings.  Added a tsp of almond oil and used 2 scoops of nutritional boost protein powder.  Turned my batter a tad green but after cooking, they toasted up and my kids couldn't even tell!  Kids thought they were great!  I cut back on the salt a little.  Next time I will cut it in half.  These are a tad salty but the amount it calls for doesn't ruin them.

I made this recipe as written.  They came out the perfect consistency but I have to agree that there's too much salt in the recipe.  I'll cut the salt in the recipe in half and try again.

Turned out great and very simple.  I have made much more complex pancake recipes that didn't turn out as well.  I added a little more milk and served with strawberrys, whipped cream and maple syrup.

So far I have made these pancakes twice, second time I was in a rush and forgot to sift my dry ingredients so they came out pretty thick and dense. I also cooked them on a griddle and they come out differently than when cooked in a skillet. Overall, this is a very easy and yummy pancake recipe!

This recipe is much better with a tad less baking soda and salt and an addition of vanilla.  Good starter recipe!  This is what I was looking for since I was out of the box mix and didn't want to detour too far from the boxed flavor because of my picky kids.  Yes, they ate it!

Love this recipe! In a pinch I used almond milk (1cup) and 1/4 cup plain yogurt in place of the milk and the pancakes were equally wonderful. I've quadrupled this recipe for a large breakfast event which worked just as well. I also use this as my base recipe and add a cup of fresh blueberries for some delicious blueberry pancakes. This recipe always turns out yummy! They freeze nicely when or if you have leftovers

I followed the recipe and found the batter to be a little watery to my taste and the pancakes didn't rise as I had expected BUT, they were very tasty.
I added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  With a little adjustment with some additional flour and baking powder I think they'll come out to my liking.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Not a fan at all...all I taste is baking powder. They are light and fluffy...but the taste is definitely not my favorite. Followed this recipe exactly but I doubled it. I probably shouldn't have doubled the baking powder.

Great recipe,easy to make, and tastes great! The batter is really thick when you put it in the pan and spreads out. So if you are looking for about 4" pancakes drop in about half the size you want at a time.

This recipe is wonderful. I recommend using an electric griddle at 350 degrees. Do not use cooking spray. Mine turned out light and fluffy, identical to IHOP. Follow the recipe and they will turn out amazing. I added a handful of blueberries.

This is a great pancake recipe, I have tried a couple of others on this site and this one is my favorite. The batter was a little thick and because I was adding blueberries and chocolate chips I added 1/4 cup of tonic water to thin it out, this gave the pancakes a very light texture, so good.

Light, fluffy, and buttery, these pancakes will melt in your mouth! So much better than that boxed stuff, and really easy to make, too! I recommend making the recipe as is to start off, then add your own touch with vanilla, blueberries, bananas, or whatever else you can dream up.

Really simple, light and fluffy pancakes. I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but I think next time I'd add a bit more and maybe a tiny bit more sugar.

The pancakes turned out great, I folded some chocolate chips in for ths kids and they loved them. The batter was a little thick for my liking (after the rest) so I just added water to thin them out

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Batter was overly thick, I had to add more milk.  The flavor was good, but I did enhance with cinnamon and vanilla. Will not make again.

This was my first time making pancakes from scratch and they turned out great. After reading the reviews first my intention was to reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp but honestly I don't remember adding it at all. The melted butter was salted and instead of cooking spray I also used salted butter. I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla because after all almost everything is better with vanilla. Next time I'll try adding bananas or berries. Yum yum.

I don't make pancakes very often anymore, so the mix sits in the pantry until it needs to be thrown out.  We recently wanted pancakes for a Sunday morning breakfast, so rather than buy another mix that would eventually end up in the garbage, I looked and found this recipe.  I now wonder why I ever thought I needed a mix!  So easy and so good!

I was looking for a different recipe than what I already have and thought I would try this one. It's very similar to my other one. There are two things that I wanted to point out with this recipe that I think are crucial. 1st, the pancakes were too salty with the addition of a full tsp of salt. I will cut it down to half next time and that should do it. 2nd, and the more important one, there is bit more baking soda in this recipe. Add that along with the 5 minutes of rest time, and you get these nice and fluffy pancakes. Overall I was happy with the recipe. They browned nicely, were nice and fluffy, and not dense. Just cut down the salt.

Excellent....i never was able to make a pancake that would cook nicely inside and not get too dark on the outside.  Just right.  I did cut down the baking powder to 3 tsp. and the salt to 1/2 tsp. Perfect.

I tried these this weekend and thought they were wonderful and easy. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 due to my opinion that there is way too much salt. Cut the salt in half at least. I did also add vanilla. But these would be wonderful without the vanilla, as long as you cut the salt down. Also I thought these cooked MUCH MUCH better than the Bisquick. I have no idea why I've bought the Bizquick for so long. I don't even use the add water kind. These are a permanent in my house-minus some salt :)

Excellant pancakes. I cut the salt in half, added an extra tbsp of sugar and substituted the melted butter for oil. My husband raved about them. They fluffed up and were so tasty, this will be my go to recipe for pancakes from now on.

These were delicious! I usually don't like plain pancakes (I prefer them with fruit in them) but we were out of fruit but these were still delicious and I wanted MORE.  The batter for us made about 5 medium and 3 large pancakes.  

I gave it four stars because I think cinnamon is a must in this recipe!  

I also added milled flax to my batter to give it a nutritional boost. Also I substituted Rice Milk for regular milk because my husband has a dairy allergy.

I will definitely be making this recipe from now on!

This is a great recipe! I used buttermilk and added fresh blueberries. So delicious...way better than the box mix! It's important not to over mix, and the 5 minute resting period is essential for tender pancakes. I will be using this recipe from now on. Thanks, Chef John!

These were really really good.  I was a bit skeptical with some of the reviews saying to much salt and chemical tasting.  I reduced the baking powder to 2.5 teaspoons and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Since used salted butter I put in less than a 1/4 teaspoon of salt.

This recipe is okay, but I'm searching for a new one.  I made it twice to verify that I hadn't messed it up the first time.  These taste a little to much like a scone, frankly and aren't light enough for my taste.  This will do in a pinch, but it's moving to the back of my recipe line.
