This was a really good meal.  I made it on a Saturday night, good because it takes a little time to cook.  I made a from scratch alfredo sauce.  I also used vodka instead of marsala wine, because vodka was what I had.  It turned out really good.  Vermicelli was a little fine for the beef, I would suggest linguine or fetuchine.  I also would suggest simmering the meat for about 45 minutes, I only did it for 15-20 minutes, and it wasn't that tender.  Good though, and the kids liked the pink sauce.

Excellent dish.  I substituted sprinkling the wine in the dish for pouring it in a glass.  I also replaced the beef tips with finger tips.  Otherwise, superb!

What a creative mix for the sauce!  A CREAMY spaghetti, wine sauce mixed with BEEF. I would change the part of the recipe stating to add wine and spices THEN the meat; I think browning the beef gives off more flavor than "braising" which will happen if you add liquid (the wine) first. It took my beef tips about 1-1/2 hours simmering to tenderize, which is probably typical. Different and tasty, but not something we would make often.  I made it low carb, with "Bella Vista" low carb (YUM) spaghetti sauce, and homemade heavy-cream alfredo and served with just a nice spring mix salad.

I slow cooked my beef in the everything except the alfredo and spaghetti sauce. This makes the beef really tender. I add the alfredo and spaghetti the last half hour. My family enjoyed this it was a great change for the same ol same ol with beef tips...

This recipe was ok. I liked the alfredo and spaghetti sauce mixture but I didn't enjoy it with the beef tips. I also found the directions to be rather time consuming when it really didn't need to be so complicated.

Great taste.. Great way to get rid of some left over Masala wine . (That stuff is nasty) It wasn't pink though! It says its pink! THAT was dissapointing because my 4 year old loves everything pink.. and I did it to treat her. Nothing spectactular.. just a complicated variation of spaghetti.

01.30.17 ~ A really nice dish. I made a half batch using two pounds of stew meat, sans the mushrooms. Not a fan of those in our house. I wasn't rushed for dinner, so I let it simmer until the tips were nice and tender. We liked the combination of the two sauces mixed together. Served it with garlic bread and 'Simple Roasted Butternut Squash' from AR. A meal I would make again.
