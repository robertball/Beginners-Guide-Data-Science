This recipe was great for us because we were running low on money, and we had all the ingredients already at home! It is simple to make, and tastes great. The texture, when it hits the tongue, is dry- like a cornbread texture. But it seems to melt in the mouth! I would definitely say that this cake needs good frosting though. It was more dry than I expected it to be, but not too dry to be enjoyed!

This is a nice, basic white cake that probably would do well with additions of fruit, et cetera.  I made in a bundt pan so baked it an extra 20 minutes, which was all the extra time it needed. It's a very light cake and isn't too sweet.  I broke it out of the pan, as it's very crumbly and apparently I didn't grease the bundt pan well enough.  No matter; I just put it back together.  Instead of a typical frosting, I  used the leftover filling I had from making the Blackberry Puff Pastry Tarts as a frosting.  I had about half of the filling leftover and although it wouldn't normally be enough to frost a bundt cake, I put it on while it was still warm so it could melt over.  Then I decorated with some blueberries.  Very good that way!  thanks for the recipe!

I cut the recipe in half to make 12 cupcakes but still used two eggs. Moist, light, fluffy, "squeezably soft" white cake.  Nice.

I made this and it turned out great, light moist and delicious.  I kind of did what naples34102 did, I didn't cut it in half but I did double the eggs, I used 4.  This was only my second time ever making a cake or cup cakes from scratch (I've always used a mix).

I made cupcakes. Tastes great, but very crumbly.  I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know what went wrong. They just didn't turn out like cake. They taste like a great sugar cookie. I would not make this recipe again. I've never had a cake turn out like this. They looked perfect but would not pull away from the cupcake liners and just crumbled everywhere and were definitely not over baked.

They were great, not dry and especially yummy because they are spongey and soft in the middle and crunchy on top.I also put 1 tsp of baking powder to every half cup of flour .So i put 4 tsp in total and worked well. It made it more light and fluffy.
