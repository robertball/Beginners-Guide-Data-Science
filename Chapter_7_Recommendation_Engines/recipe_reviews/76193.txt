OMG - this is SO GOOD! At first I wasn't sure - it was my first time making this and it seemed too easy to be true, but it really is fantastic! I threw the eggs into the processor with everything else and it turned out great! Thank you for sharing such a great and easy recipe!

This was really basic and good.  easy to make and I added some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning and used olive oil instead of canola.  YUM!

I did make some big changes. 
- I used calve livers and soaked them in milk which makes them taste really good. 
-I cooked them in a very small amount of onion infused olive oil since I canâ€™t tolerate onions with my Pancreatic cancer
-using a food processor and a little more olive oil I spun it until it formed a ball on the canister then added some BBQ sauce for great flavor even cold on pumpernickel bread!
-I need to extra iron to increase my hemoglobin counts and this is becoming a favorite for me
Hope you will give it a try and also experiment with your favorite spices or sauces ie teriyaki, etc.
