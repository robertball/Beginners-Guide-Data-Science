So good! I used 2 chicken breasts, the entire can of coconut milk and 1 cup of chicken broth (because we like more "sauce"). I kept the spices exactly the same, and we all loved it! The only thing I will do different next time is cut the brown sugar back just a tad - other than that it was perfect. Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe Matt!

This is delicious. If you like Thai curry more than Indian curry I would double the sauce base. There is little to no sauce in the original recipe. I followed other reviewers and added more chicken stock and coconut milk. I also did 1 tbsp of each fish sauce and brown sugar instead of the recommended amount. I added a small can of bamboo shoots. The potato is boiled separately in this recipe. I recommend doing the same for the carrots. They were a little crunchy despite simmering for a while.

Yum!! My husband and I loved it. Thanks so much for providing the yellow curry recipe we've been searching for. I've tried others, but this one gave us the flavour and kick of spice we were looking for. This recipe will be great with beef or seafood as well and I will be making this on a regular basis.

Wonderful!  I love the sauce as well, so also used the whole can of coconut milk and added extra spices so it wouldn't be diluted (I would not have if my kids were eating it).  I also used frozen mixed peppers to avoid the cost of 3 peppers out of season, and chopping them.  We'll try this with shrimp next!

I didn't have any fish sauce and still tasted wonderful! I only had a yellow pepper, so I boiled cauliflower and yams with the potatoes, and added broccoli. Next time I will boil the carrots too, because they were too crunchy. I probably cut them too thick.  Yummy!

This recipe was amazing. I made it with Basmati rice in stead of Jasmine rice and it was much better with the Basmati.

Our whole family loved this recipe--even our picky eater!  I only used 1 teaspoon of red curry paste so our children could eat it and didn't add the cayenne pepper until after I took out their portion.  It is definitely going in the rotation of meals in our house!

I didn't have peppers or cayenne, so I left them out. This was EXCELLENT!! It tasted like my favorite dish from a nearby Thai restaurant. I will cook this again and again.

Awesome recipe! Substituted yellow pepper for green and doubled the vegetables and chicken broth to make a little more soupy.

i made this  this evening. I did not have curry paste. I increased curry powder until I said, "enough."  a suggestion-- line up your soldiers  ( ingredients ) and have some fun performing cooking magic ( especially if you have an audience ). great stuff!
