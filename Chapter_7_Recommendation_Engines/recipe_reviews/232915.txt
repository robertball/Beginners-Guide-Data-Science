Looking for a quick and tasty dish? This just may be it! I had all of the needed ingredients on hand and followed the recipe as written. For ease I browned my ground beef in my pasta pot after draining the noodles; I also waited until the meat was mostly browned before adding the green pepper and onion to keep them from getting too soft. All in all - I satisfying dish that should please your family!

Was good and very easy good for those picky eaters. I added a little more pizza sauce was great.

So good! Two comfort moods made into one. Absolutely delicious! Not a lot of work and I had the ingredients on hand around the house. It was a little bit of time but not a ton and the time it took was easy preparation. Definitely a make-again.
