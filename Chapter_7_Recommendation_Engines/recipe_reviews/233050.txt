This recipe does not specify whether or not to drain the pork and beans.  I chose to drain them, and I wish that I’d at least added some of the bean liquid back to the mixture before going into the oven.  We like our baked beans cold better than hot.  I typically remove them from the oven before the recommended cooking time, so there’s a little more liquid as I think that consistency is better when cold.  I made half a recipe, set the timer for 80 minutes (10 minutes less than the recipe indicated), and the beans were slightly overcooked.  I think 90 minutes would have been a disaster.  I added some water to the dish, mixed it in well, so all was good.  I mention this only because 90 minutes sounded like a lot of time to me for baking beans, so you may want to be cautious, and start checking them at 60 minutes for doneness (I know I will the next time).  These are fairly sweet baked beans, but they’re good.  My apples probably were closer to being minced than chopped, so the next time I will cut them a little larger, so I know when I’m biting into apple.

I think this is great. I have added canned pork to make this a main dish with more meat. I also replace one can of the pork and beans with drained kidney beans. This makes it less soupy and also gives more variety. I also leave the skins on the apples, more vitamins and fiber. Very yummy. My 3 year old loves it.

I thought this sounded really good and a bit of a change from the typical beans. I left out the raisins  but added about a 1/2 cup onions I cooked in the bacon grease and also added about 1/2 teaspoon of browning sauce. I do recommend reducing the brown sugar a bit unless you like your beans sweet. If you want to make those apples stand out more cut them larger.

Took to a cookout and everybody loved.  I think cook time is a little too long.  Especially if you're going to reheat before serving.

This baked beans recipe was so easy to make. I put it in a slow cooler for 8 hours. It was a hit for the whole family. My gourmet chef son commented, "best babes beans ever!

I used more bacon, tossed in a dash of cayenne and instead of the raisins, I used Ocean Spray Craisins.

This turned out to be very good. The apples gave it a really nice texture. Goes nice with BBQ pork loin. I'll make it again.

Delicious!  I used soy bacon and vegetarian baked beans to make it vegetarian. I cut the brown sugar by half. Definitely a keeper. Even better the second day.

made this for a Barbecue  and they were a big hit. Didn't have barbecue sauce  but they were still great. Used Campbells pork and beans, our favorite and did drain the beans. Baked for about 65 minutes.

SO amazing. The best baked beans I have ever tasted. I recommend draining the pork & beans first to avoid it getting too runny. Cook the bacon well so it's easy to crunch into pieces. Really good with a Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce!

I only had maple flavoured beans in the house. I cut the recipe's sugar in half. Next time I would probably only use a quarter of the suggested sugar and a bit less BBQ sauce. The crowd liked it - especially the addition of apples, raisins, and bacon with baked beans.

Probably the best baked bean dish I’ve had. They were a great side dish that everyone loved. I followed the recipe exactly and used Campbell’s Pork and Beans, and Famouse Dave’s Rich & Sassy BBQ sauce. I only used one apple as well. The only thing I would change is to remove some of the liquid from the beans.

Well, this was weird to think about, but it was totally awesome.  I used the Bourbon BBQ sauce on allrecipes  to make this dish.  Even went with the raisins.  My wife loved them.
