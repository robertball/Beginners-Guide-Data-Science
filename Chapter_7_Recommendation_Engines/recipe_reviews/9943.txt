These are the most delicious cookies I have ever made or tasted!  Kind of a cross between cookie and candy. They are chewy, toasty, sweet, crunchy, and oh so wonderful!  If you love coconut you will love these cookies.  I used a greased cookie sheet instead of buying parchment paper and it worked fine but they did stick just a little.  Also, when I made the full recipe I came out with 2 dozen cookies (which fit nicely on two cookie sheets) instead of 3 dozen as suggested and they were great!  The cookies would be pretty small if you made 3 dozen and maybe not as chewy (the best part!)  You must try this recipe because it is so tasty and easy!

These are awesome!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and the cornflakes I used were plain with only 2gm of sugar.  My guess is, others were using sugared corn flakes so they came out too sweet.  Next time I might drizzle bittersweet chocolate across them.  Definitely making this again!

I didn't care for them all that much (too sweet)but the kids loved them!  I also didnt have parchment paper and just put them on a greased cookie sheet. I checked them after 10 minutes to make sure they werent getting too brown on the bottom though.  They were easy to make.  Thanks!

Excellent cookie! Even the people who don't have a sweet tooth or aren't big cookie eaters absolutely loved it!!
We did use less sugar (little less than a cup) and it turned out a little on the sweet side. Will use 3/4 cup next time and we'll experiment with chocolate (drizzle/sprinkle) next time too. But even without, they were delicious and easy!! Perfect to make with kids: this time the batch was made by my 12-yr-old sister!

Would have been a 5 star if not for being way too sweet. Reduced sugar by half and it was still a little sweet.

It seems to be better the second day.. seems to be less sticky.

Experimented with a few adding mini-chocolate chips.. it was pretty good.

yummy. i am a huge coconut fan and these were perfect of rusing up an old bag i had in the fridge.  i reduced the sugar by a souple of spoonfuls and it was still SUPER SWEET.  also, for those who are running into trouble, make sure you best the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium for AT LEAST 5 mins.  they have to be super super fluffy.

Super yummy!! I do agree that they are very sweet and I didn't even put in the whole amount of sugar. Very good though and worth the sugar high.

Only tried this recipe to use up egg whites & cinnamon cornflakes.  It used them up, but we didn't like 'em.  No, didn't use any coconut, only cornflakes.  Can't see it being any better/worse with that addition.  I love meringue.  L O V E IT, but these weren't close eventhough the recipe seemed like it.  Oh, well.  Now I know.  Oh, I used 3/4c sugar & it was fine.

I can and do bake everything and everything well. Its a rare experience for me to fail. This recipe and I failed. First off, I followed reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 the sugar. Good call. The FLAVOR of these cookies is EXCELLENT. I am going to have to remake these sometime. I threw my entire batch out. They just never set up. They fell apart and were in crumbles after baking. I will say with reservation, it could be a cooks error, but I really can't see how. But, it could be. So, I will try again because, despite the failure the first time, the flavor was out of this world. Cut the sugar in half though, otherwise they will be sickly sweet. I will re-review after my second attempt.

Very easy. I used honey bunches of oats for the cereal. Made into 24 instead of 36. Baked 12 minutes on a greased sheet. Really good. Whole family liked them.

A great coconut macaroon recipe, thanks for sharing LG ! The cornflakes add a biscuity taste and give a crunch.  I followed the advice of many reviewers and cut the amount of sugar in half (125g) and it was fine for me (I did not use sweetened coconut and frosted cornflakes). It took 5 minutes to beat the egg whites until stiff and I baked the cookies for 13 minutes and they were golden, chewy and crunchy. A keeper !!!

These were delicious. We had no problems with the cookies sticking, since we used the parchment called for in the recipe. We followed the recipe exactly, and have absolutely zero complaints! These were very good cookies!

Fantastic if you like coconut.  I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup, and it was much better, yet still sweet.  Great fast and easy recipe!

What a great combination. The corn flakes are a perfect addition. For the coconut lover these are the ultimate coconut rush!! They are definately best on the day they are made, but they dont stick around very long anyway.

These turned out very good, but very sticky.  They were the first thing to ever stick on my silpat, but after they cooled completly, they came off without too much trouble.  These are good as is, but if you melt chocolate chips and dip the bottoms in it and they become great!  4 stars as is, 5 with chocolate.  :)

A coconut lover's dream! I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, added more cornflakes because the mixture was a bit too wet and drizzled chocolate on top after baking. I also kept them in the fridge. Really, really yummy!

These are not bad but they are very sweet.  I love sweet stuff so I completely disregarded the reviews warning of this.  If you like coconut candies, you'll love this.  If you're looking for cookie in the traditional sense, this will be a bit of a disappointment.

This is a VERY easy recipe to master! The only change I made was using a 1/2 cup less sugar. I didn't expect the cookies to rise/spread out, but they did, so make sure to leave room between cookies on the cookie sheet! I made these for the "boys" for Sunday Football and they were gone in no time! Easy recipe for kids to help with as well!

even when i halved the recipe it was still to sweet. And even when i put it on parchment paper, it still completely stuck and couldn't remove it. Not sure why it stuck. so suggestions is so either use low sugar cereal, or reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. and the sticking? i guess try to take them out while they're hot

Wow I think I like these better than an ordinary coconut macaroons. I would call it flourless candied macaroons :). Yes, half the sugar because you have plenty of sweetness with the coconut flakes and cornflakes (used frosted flakes by the way). I forgot to use parchment paper, instead, I used a non-stick pan and it was fine. These cookies seem to fall apart as you slide the spatula under it, let it cool & rest for a few more minutes to firm up a little and also to maintain their shape, then remove from the sheet.

Very good corn flake maccaroon !  My first batch I followed `the recipe to a t, but baked only for 12 - 13 min.  Center cookies trurned out good, outside cookies burnt on the bottom.  This is likely just a quirk of my oven, I found at just a smidge over 300 and 10 min worked well for me.

I am not sure why I gave one star. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using parchment paper.  Was looking for a recipe to use up my egg whites I had after making hollandaise sauce. The cookies stuck to the pan(note: I did not use parchment paper, but have wonderful cookie sheets that nothing sticks to-except these). Besides that, they fell apart. I would much rather have plain macaroons or plain cornflake cookies than mixing the two together. Won't make again-getting ready to throw this batch away.

I recently made this to serve at a luncheon for a light dessert. First, let me say my favorite thing about the recipes was how fast they were to put together!! Super easy, just make sure your egg whites are stiff. After reading other reviews I did double the recipe, but not the sugar. They came out perfect and I will make them again.I like to think they are a lighter less dense version of a macaroon.

Definitely not what I was expecting.  I cut back on the sugar and still way too sweet.    I used parchment paper and the cookies stuck and came apart when I tried to remove them.

I don't know what went wrong. my batter is dry and crumbly, so it was impossible to drop on baking sheet. i had to ball them with my hand (messy process) and still they crumbled. nevertheless, the taste is good and coconut lover will like it. i reduce the sugar by half a cup though.  Edit: I get fed-up with the crumbly mix, so i added some melted butter. it stick a bit but still crumbly but the taste is more delicious :D

Wow! These are absolutely fantastic! I drizzled some melted chocolate on half the batch and took some to work - they were a huge hit. They do stick to the pan a little, will try the parchment paper next time.

I made these for my coconut-loving mom. They're very sticky and chewy, but still a little crunchy. So so so delicious and easy to make. 
I've made them twice; once in the spur of the moment when company came over because they can be made so fast. Even a little burnt, they're delicious (they taste like toasted marshmallows then). 
I did reduce the sugar to a cup, and they were still really really sweet.

These taste like store-bought cookies!  I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar by half (I think the amount of sugar you need depends on whether or not you use sweetened coconut flakes or not).  If you are a coconut lover, these are a keeper.

I took these to a pot luck tonight, and every last one of them was gone, with five people coming up to me and saying how amazing they were and requesting them for a get togethr next week! They were a little bit sticky to my teeth but no one else complained! Very similar to a macaroon. I'm going to try to reduce the sugar next time. Delicious and different, will be a part of my holiday cookie tray from now on..

Great cookies!  Beat eggs until stiff...it may take up to five minutes. Only used 1/2 cup sugar becuase coconut already had sugar in it. May even reduce sugar to 1/3 next time. FOLD in the other ingredients.  Good cookies for people with wheat allergies!  Thanks!

Yummy!  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, I'll probably try 1/2 cup next time.  Perhaps that recipe's author used unsweetened coconut, and that's why it calls for so much sugar?  Baking for 14 minutes was perfect, golden and toasty and chewy.  I mixed the egg whites for a full five minutes on high.

I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup and 2-1/2 C corn flakes and 1-1/2 C coconut flakes.  It made 3-1/2 dozen normal-size cookies.  They were not sticky and they didn't spread.   This recipe is now in my recipe box.   I like this because it doesn't use butter or flour.

4 stars if you just cut the sugar in half.  5 stars if (for Christmas) you also add a jar of maraschino cherries (chopped) and anise extract nearly equal to the vanilla extract, then half-dip when cooled in melted chocolate.  (Don't overheat the chocolate or it will lose its temper.)  Best eaten straight from the bowl, but we like them after they're baked and dipped too.

I am going to serve this with a chocolate-espresso-brandy sauce with fresh raspberries. This cake tastes better after sitting overnight in the fridge. It tastes more moist. You can't taste the chickpeas at all and I love that it is dairy-free. It tastes very rich. I think next time I make it I will use some coconut flakes and cocoa powder. I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 based on what other people wrote and I think that is okay. If you want a sweeter cake you should try the original recipe, though.

Excellent texture and easy to make, but only slightly more interesting than a regular coconut macaroon. I think next time I might add more corn flakes to add more of a different texture.

These are great! I actually didn't have corn flakes so I used rice krispies and that worked really well. I also used almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I cut the sugar in the recipe more than half.

These are delicious! I made them last night to send to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and I had to hide them because my family kept eating them! I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and they are the perfect sweetness. yum! ::EDIT:: Oct 2010. I made these again tonight and they didn't turn out at all. I followed the recipe except for cutting down on the sugar. The only thing I can think of is that my eggs weren't quite stiff enough or that because the shredded coconut is so different here (I'm in Australia now). They just will not stick together though.

I love this recipe. They are very very sweet but is full of goodness. I did cut the sugar in half because I used Frosted Flakes. Even if you use plan corn flakes I think you could still cut out some sugar. My boyfriend doesn't even like coconunt that much and he ate them up. On the last batch I experimented and put almond pieces in and they were even better they candied in the cookie but gave it something other than sugar. A winning recipe. I wish I had found it at Christmas.

Couldn't be easier!  You get the crunchy and chewy in one very delicious cookie.  Like the other reviewers, I  reduced the sugar and the morsels were plently sweet.  Ill definately be making these again, my family loved them!

We LOVED these cookies! My husband, who thought he hated coconut, tried one and was hooked. He just asked when I was going to make his favorite cookies again - meaning these. Yes they are very sweet, but that is fine with us!

Cookies were way to sweet for my liking.  I even cut down on the sugar.  I think they would be better with a bit less coconut and a little more cornflakes.

If you love coconut you will love these!  They are really sweet though so I could see using a little less sugar if you prefer. It took about 4-5 minutes to get the stiff egg whites.  I used a silpat for baking and found they came off the silpat easily as long as I waited a few minutes before removing them.  Will make again!

Coconut macaroons with a crunch. Everyone loved them! I'm making them again this weekend to bring to the cottage.

I put these on my cooking stone that is saturated with grease and they came off but then fell apart.  I stuck them back together and let them cool more.  They taste great, though.  I did back off the sugar to 3/4 C. and they were plenty sweet.

These are easy to make and they are delicious.  They are more like candy than cookies!  I used Splenda for half the sugar and that worked just fine.  I will definitely make these again.

ugh, after reading everybody's reviews that said they were good, I MUST have done something wrong...they burnt...but weren't done in the middle...and they stuck to the cookies sheet (which I spayed heavily)but as I said, I must have done something wrong because they turned out fine for everybody else?  :(

This didn't taste very good.  Too sweet and not at all what I thought it would be.
