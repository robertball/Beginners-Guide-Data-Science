This was really good!  I thought it was a great idea to use rolled oats instead of pecans because pecans are so expensive.  The top tasted a lot like granola.  I thought the middle part did taste just like pecan pie and the oats on top are really good.  Only change I made was I used light corn syrup like other reviewers suggested and I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar (which I always do for my pecan pie).  I made it in a smaller pie pan (so I halved everything) and I cooked it 40 minutes and it was done.  I think if you made the recipe in a full pie pan it definitely would need more time than that since it would be thicker, and you'd have more filling.  I found that if when you are baking it and the filling moves a whole lot because it is very liquidy in the middle, then it is not done.  It usually is done when it moves just a little when you shake it (like jello).  I did not think that this should have received a lower rating because someone cooked it incorrectly.  All ovens cook differently, so you have to figure out on your own when it looks done.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will make it again! (I was testing it out for a fall festival and am going to make another one in a couple days.)

This is the best pie ever. I love the pecan pie but do not like the pecans and this makes a wonderfully rich pie.  This recipe is also good to make for family gathering as a substitute for pecan pie for those that may be allergic to nuts. This pie always turns out good.  You can substitute light Karo syrup for dark Karo syrup, it works for me.

This is a excellent pie. I love to bake and this is so easy and good. The price of Pecans are through the roof these days and if you are looking for a tasty cheaper pecan pie than this is it!!!!  It looks to nice too.  I used Light Corn Syrup(that is all I had) instead and it turned out great!!!

WOW!! It was great! I love pecan pie but refused to drag 4 kids along to find pecans the day before Thanksgiving. I took this to my in-laws and it was gone BEFORE the traditional pecan pie that was already there. Many compliments and requests for the recipe. I did have to cook it longer and I used light corn syrup b/c that's what I had on hand. I'm trying to find an excuse to make it again :)

I love this pie, i made it for Thanksgiving and everyone said that its good. My sis-in-law asked what did i do to get the pecans sooo small (LOL), i said its no pecans at all, its oatmeal!! They couldn't believe it. I found this recipe because i forgot the pecans at the store lucky me. This is my new recipe from now on. Great recipe and its not that stomach hurting sweet, its just right and i didn't change a thing. Thank you, Glenda

I think this pie would be better with a light corn syrup.  Mine needed about an hour to cook

This turned out great for an alternative to traditional pecan pie.  I followed the recipe exactly, however, I did cook it approximately 60 minutes.  I also used the quick oats (that's all I had).  It was still a little runny in the middle.  I will definitely try this recipe again and probably add a little flour and use the old fashioned oats.

This pie was a hit at Thanksgiving this year.  My sister in law and I don't like pecans so I made this as an alternative!  Even the Pecan Pie junkies were eating on our pie along with their own!  It was VERY easy to make, but I did have to leave it in a little longer.  Also, I did use the light like others.  I would recommend this pie and do plan on making it again!

I loved this pie recipe!  Good as pecan pie!  I followed directions and it turned out fantastic!  I made a homemade crust. Family really enjoyed it!  I will make this pie again.  It is a keeper!  I thank you so much for sharing the recipe!  I almost didn't try it.  Some of the reviews said that it came out runny... I didn't have this problem.  I did only have to bake this pie for 30 minutes on 350*F.  I used a glass pie plate!  Fantastic!

I had never heard of an oatmeal pie before &  i really enjoyed it! I only had light corn syrup and the recipe still turned out great. I made it with a press-in pie crust, labeled Easy Pie Crust recipe. Easy & fantastic!

This didn't turn out at all.  Perhaps the cooking time or oven temperature is wrong on this recipe, or there wasn't enough oats, or perhaps it needed another egg.  At any rate, the pie was pure liquid inside after 45 minutes in the oven and overnight in the fridge.  The recipe author needs to include how to tell if it is done.  I'm currently trying to rescue the ingredients by destroying the pie and cooking it in a jelly roll pan.  We'll see how that goes.  Also, the portions that did cook tasted nothing like pecan pie.  It tasted good, but it wouldn't fool anybody, not even a poor man.  Update: the jelly roll pan trick worked, and it tasted nice (although nothing like pecan pie), but as written, my one star rating stands.

Turned out great. Instead of using any corn syrup, I substituted wildflower honey 1:1, and baked it for 1 hour. My kids loved it, and so did I. I'll definitely make this again.

Wow is this rich.  It took 55 minutes in the oven which was too long for the frozen crust I used, but the filling was great if a little too sweet.  I'm going to try this again with a more substantial crust and a little less sugar.

Thank you so much for this recipe! My father just loves pecan pie, but he's 87 with no teeth and can't eat it any longer. Now he can have pecan pie again! Wonderful recipe.

We will definitely be including this pie with all of our holiday meals and most likely other times as well.  Nobody could believe this did not have pecans in it; they just thought they were the pecan chips or that I had crushed them to be super fine.  Superb and easy!

I absolutely loved it.  Actually, I've never eaten pecan pie because I dislike pecans and can't really eat nuts.  It was so delicious!  It's going to become one of my favorite "go-to" dessert recipes.

I've also had a version made with Grape Nuts cereal (not flakes) but I don't know if it's sold anymore!  It was quite tasty, too.  But here in southern New Mexico (second only to Georgia for growing pecans) I'd better use the real thing!   LOL

This recipe is great!  I have made it with either light or dark corn syrup and prefer the light but would not turn down a slice of either!  My oven takes a little longer to cook in winter (new oven, makes no sense to me either) but anybody who cooks knows that heat, humidity and sometimes the cooking goblins make timing  baked goods interesting.  Thanks for this.  It has become a requested family favorite.

I make recipes exact to rate it. I gave this one 3 stars because it was ok as a sweet, easy and cheap dessert. I did have to cook longer, about an hour to get it to set up right and brown more. My opinion is there was to much oats and not as sweet as a true pecan pie. I have had a Poor Man's Pecan Pie before and it tasted as a pecan pie does. Maybe less oats more sugar? Hope this helps... :)

This pie is so good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Added a bit more cooking time until the pie seemed like set jello in the middle when shaken lightly.  It came out perfectly!!  A great pie when you have little in the cupboard but want a nice treat or to serve to guest (on the cheap)!

Wonderful recipe! I added a cup of mini chocolate chips - just decadent!
