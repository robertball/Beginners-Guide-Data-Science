Yummy!!!  I added extra cocoa because I wanted a stronger chocolate flavor but I think it would have been good without it too.

This cake is yummy.  Watch carefully after 40 minutes so it doesn't burn.  The kids don't care for it, but that's OK, that much more for me!

Be careful not to overbake as it will come out a bit dry.  I overfilled my tin and it took quite a while to bake and the edges came out dry which made it hard to slice nicely.  My husband loves date loaf and chocolate so I thought I'd combine the two for him.  He liked it but said the chocolate overpowered the dates and he couldn't taste them which he thought was a waste of dates.  Would I bake this again?  Yes, probably.  Also, this cake is much better the next day.

This is a great recipe, but I have made some changes. I use brown sugar in stead of white. I add almond extract, and almonds in place if the walnuts. For special occasions, I serve with a caramel sauce. Always a crowd pleaser!

I love this cake!! I did make most of the changes suggested by others. I cut the cocoa down to 2 tsps, used brown sugar and added vanilla. I think next time though I will add more nuts to it. Not overly sweet, but enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.

This is an old recipe and the first recipe I ever wrote down.  I think I was 15.  This cake is made for a smaller cake pan.  I always have used a 9x9 to keep this from drying out.  I always pour the boiling water over dates and baking soda and let it sit for 1/2 hour as I get everything else together.  I think it is unnecessary to separate and mix like you do for most cakes.  this is a snack cake and not a fancy cake.  I have never added nuts.  I sprinkle the top with chocolate chips and then white sugar.  The sugar caramelizes and makes a kind of crust along with the melted chocolate.  Best the day it's made.  By the way my recipe was written over 50 years ago from a friends mom. I think it must be watched closely after 40 minutes

This was delicious! Moist-flavorful-light-but still sweet! I cooked at 350 for 40 minutes and it came out perfect. Used milk chocolate chips instead of bittersweet (because that was all I had) which made it a bit sweeter than regular. Topped it off with a buttercream frosting. Amazing flavor, and just a little different from the usual. Definitely a keeper!
