I'm usually not a big fan of winter squash, though I recently turned to roasting some diced butternut and enjoyed it. I'd never had Delicatas, and after seeing this method I had to try it. These are now officially my favorite winter squash, they are so good roasted! I used other seasonings, but the roasted flavor of these rocks!

I've made this twice as an appetizer and my guests and family love it.  Make a double batch, they go fast!

This is an incredible, and incredibly simple, recipe. I made this for family dinner and everyone loved it, from the toddlers to the seniors. Roasting these crisp makes them a lot like french fries, but they are way easier to make. And through this recipe I discovered Chef John's curry aioli, which is another amazing addition to the repertoire. Try it!

This was easy and very good.  I was out of cayenne, so I made it with the olive oil, pepper and ground ginger.  Everyone liked it.  I will definitely make it again.

I have never had this type of squash before, how you made it was easy and tasty and didn’t take much time to make it. My 2yrs old son loved it and I enjoyed it in a chicken, spinach’s salad I made.

This was a real discovery to me, I too thought these squashes were just decorative. This recipe is like making healthy candy, the squash is that sweet, and flavorful. The main problem is the price of the squash itself. The markets price it as a decoration, and not a vegetable!

I added a touch more cayenne, and really loaded the spice into the mayo dip, and we couldn't stop snacking on these. I think these will be excellent appetizers during the holidays, too!

We have a family member with an aversion to heat, so I subbed in Hungarian paprika for the cayenne.  Delicious!

I may have overcooked this slightly, but I won’t be trying it again as there is apparently no way to make it crispy like fries.

I think Delicata is now my favorite squash!  I prepared it per the recipe, but did not make the pumpkin aioli. I used Thousand Islands salad dressing as my dipping sauce. For me, I would go easy on the cayenne. The first time I made it , I had a silicone mat on my roasting pan.  The second time, I had foil on the pan and it browned better. I have recommended Delicata and Chef John's recipe to a number of friends.  My only problem has been finding it in my local stores in December.

Haha. I’d double it! It is so velvety smooth and buttery delicious!  It’s a keeper and one I will make many times during the season I am sure. So easy. So good.
