I made this with a few changes and it turned out fantastic!  My wife just would not stop raving about it.

I cut the recipe in half, because there are only two of us.  I doubled the garlic and doubled the clams.  But the second can of clams were drained.  I added some red pepper flakes and also added about a half cup of good white wine.

It turns out to be a very special dish.  You could definately put it into your rotation or keep it for special occasions.

Very, very good and simple.  Like many others, I made this with some variations.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup xtra Virgin olive oil.  I also used 5 cloves of garlic.  I added 1 tbl of Old Bay (you may omit any additional salt if you use O.B.). After everything was brought up to temperature, I added 3 dollops of sour cream and thickened with a little corn starch.  No leftovers!

We all loved this.  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of 1/2 a cup of butter, I used 1/4 cup of butter, and a 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I also doubled the garlic because we love it.  I undercooked the pasta by a minute or two, and added some pasta water to the sauce, to thicken it up a bit.  Then I added the pasta to the sauce and cooked it for a few minutes to absorb the sauce better.  I would definitely make this again.

This is just a basic starter recipe of which you can adjust to your liking. Being Italian, and my wife and I liking this dish, I can make some recommendations. First of all you should add a can, or jar of baby WHOLE clams in with the chopped clams. Much more meaty. Secondly, after the garlic has lightly browned deglaze the pan with 1/3 cup dry white wine or dry sherry (NOT the cooking wine stuff). And lastly, Chopped basil has much more flavor than parsley. And another thing. What is this with all complaints of the sauce being "to runny"? It's supposed to be runny!! Any Italian, or most anybody who likes this dish knows that you eat it with bread. And you use the bread to sop up the "runny" sauce. And don't complain about "that's to much bread" because it only takes about two small slices of Italian bread to do the job. If you're gonna do it, do it right.

Very good and sooo easy!  I loved the flavor, but the sauce seemed a bit too watery with all of the clam juice added, so I stirred in the parm. cheese while it was cooking to thicken it up a bit.  I will definately be making this one again, thanks!

This was a fantastic dinner for my husband and I.  Since kids don't like mushrooms, it has become our favorite for when it's just us.  Get pre-sliced mushrooms and this is FAST.

This was a big hit with my dinner guests.  I served Ali's Amazing Bruschetta (also Allrecipes) as an excellent appetizer.  Per others' reviews I made these changes: 1 extra can of clams w/juice, extra garlic, decreased butter to 1/4 c. supplemented with olive oil, substituted freshly ground black pepper.  My own changes: I thickened sauce with flour/pan juice roux, substitued pre-made pesto to taste for fresh parsley, and added 1/2 c. dry white wine shortly before serving.

I cooked this dish twice with fettuccine, made changes to this recipe for a healthier dish. Used olive oil instead of butter to saute garlic and mushroom and used milk and flour to thicken the sauce. (saute flour together with garlic and mushroom and add in 1/2 cup of milk). Also, I used canned chunk tuna instead of clams as I could not find canned clams in where I live. My fiance and I love this pasta very much, especially with lots of mushrooms.

This was really good.  However I did add a splash of white wine which I think is key.  So fast and easy, I'll definitely make this again.

This was the best! I added extra clams and plenty of parmesan.  Comments from guests, 'why go out to eat when you can eat like this at home'.

I personally love this recipe. It's really too bad that it has a lot of calories otherwise I would make this more than once a week! I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup olive oil, lots of garlic, white pepper, a pinch of thyme and 1/2 cup of milk to thicken the sauce. A very good recipe.

Being my first post, I'd first like to say that if you change the recipe, base your review on the recipe as written. I see a lot on the reviews where people drastically change the recipe and then leave an unfair review.  With that being said: This recipe was delicious. Very classic and flavorful.  I can't ever follow a recipe as written, so the second time I made it, here was my tweaks:  I added a splash of white wine to the sauce, which added a nice background flavor and lightness to an otherwise heavy sauce. Then I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock instead of more clams or clam juice as to not make it TOO clammy. I also cut the butter in half. Adding the wine and stock gives the sauce a richness and a punch of flavor so that you really do not need or miss all that butter. I added the pasta to the sauce, turned the heat down to low and let the sauce cook with the noodles for a few minutes. This is a very authentic thing to do with any pasta dish. Then we served with fresh Parmesan, some chopped fresh Italian parsley and bread. My husband also likes to sprinkle red pepper flakes on his which is another classic addition to this dish :)  I LOVED this recipe as written and also with my tweaks!

Very simple and very good. Easy to make after a long day at work. It is a little watery so I added a pinch of flour to tighten it up a little bit as it simmered. I think fresh parsley would make it even better. Also, try to use linguini or fetucini even if you have regular spaghetti in the house...it makes you feel more Italian.

This dish is absolutely amazing!  I made a few changes, as did other reviewers, but I didn't stray too far from the original recipe.  I took suggestions of a few and used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. olive oil and used 4 cloves of garlic.  I used portabello mushrooms because I love the meatness they add to a dish - fantastic!  Because the type of parsely wasn't specified, I used Italian parsley (a favorite of mine), but only used 1/4 cup.  I used another suggestion to use Old Bay Seasoning - very good!  I mixed a little cornstartch with some of the reserved clam juice (as the juice from both cans would be too much, which was obvious after the first can) to thicken the sauce slightly.  I would be delighted to serve this dish to guests.  White wine, crusty french bread and candles would make it a phenomenal romantic meal!  Thanks for the recipe, Silvia.  It will be a mainstay in my recipe collection!

I love this recipe. I've made it twice already. Once with mushrooms and once without. It's great both ways. NOTE: I reduced the amount of butter and added 1/2 cup white wine.

I've fixed this twice. Each time varying it depending on what I have around. I always add a green vegetable, zucchini the first time/asparagus the second. Corn starch mixed w/ cold clam juice thickens the sauce nicely. Smart Balance Light mixed w/ some Olive Oil lightened it up, didn't add salt, used multi-grain pasta, extra garlic and a variety of mushrooms like Oyster, Portabella and/or Shitake with a splash of white wine. Very flavorful however it's fixed.

I have made a version of this for years. I use olive oil instead of butter, and just add a tbsp. of butter at the end, as another reviewer mentioned. I also add a little white wine, if I have it on hand. And if I want to amp it up, I 'll also add fresh clams in the shell along with the canned. For us, the more clams the better. We love this meal!!

Excellent recipe! I added a splash of dry vermuth and simmered a bit right before adding the pasta. It makes such a difference, giving it more of a sophisticated, adult flavor. :D

Great recipe!  My husband loved it...said it was the best linguine with clams he has ever had.  I changed it a bit.  Used 1/4 cup of olive oil in place of 1/2 of the butter, also added 1/2 cup of white wine...at the suggestions of other reviewers.  Also, started out by sauteeing chopped onions and celery before adding the garlic (which I doubled), as this is the way our fav Italian restaurant makes theirs...DELICIOUS!

Yummy! This is going in our regular rotation. I did thicken the sauce with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in some of the clam juice. It helps the sauce stick to the pasta.

Take this wonderful recipe, double the garlic, add a bit of red pepper flakes and a splash of lemon juice or white wine and open your own Italian restaurant. Served with a good wine, salad and Italian bread, this approaches heaven. Yes, it's that good. And I'm Italian.

We really enjoyed this easy pasta recipe.  I used a couple suggestions from previous reviews and the results were perfect!  I added some cornstarch to a bit of the clam juice, warmed up, then added it to the clam mixture to thicken the sauce.  I also added a splash of white wine.  I think it would have been fabulous even without these minor additions, but it was delicious either way!  I did up the noodles to about 1 1/4 lbs to use up what was in my pantry.

This is so simple and so great.  I change nothing in this recipe. I serve this, as a side, with Filet Mignon when company comes...it is easy and you cannot go wrong!  When serving 4 as a side dish, I cut the recipe in half if I do not want leftovers.  If you want leftovers, make the whole recipe.

The dish is delicious, but if your going to use a picture that has fresh clams in the shell, it really ought to be in the recipe.  I would rather use fresh instead of canned.

Having lived in Italy, I can tell you first hand, adding cheese to fish or shellfish is a major no no. The first time I did that in a restaurant in Italy, I felt the entire table of Italians stop and stare at me! That aside, this was a good recipe, I left out the mushrooms and did grate a bit of lemon peel into the sauce. This is also yummy using fava beans in place of the mushrooms (double peel the beans). Thanks for posting.

Great recipe.  I reduced the butter by half and added 2 table spoons of olive oil.  I also added a 1/3 cup white wine.  Perfect dish.

Mine got sticky so I think some olive oil would have been a good addition, but we did enjoy it and would make it again.  I'm not sure how it would have been with canned clams, but we used razor clams we'd harvested/dug ourselves and it was yummy.

Absolutely delicious! Thanks so much for sharing. We enjoyed this recipe for a few days as we made a lot for just the two of us... The only change we made was using parsley that comes in a tube in our produce section. Very handy as it doesn't go bad for a few months after opening unlike fresh parsley.

I have rated this a 4 as written,Very good and easy.(I used 1/2 buter, 1/2 V.O.O.).. could be a 5 with fresh steamed clams.I plan on making this tonight with a few dozen fresh littleneck or mahogany clams(Chowder clams if that is all I can find)  and freshly grated parmesan,crimini mushrooms, fresh parsley and whole grain pasta....More work, but I am already drooling thinking about it!! I am surprised at the number of folks who added milk or flour to thicken the sauce.....I have always known pasta with Clam Sauce to be a light meal with a satisying thin sauce which clings very well to the pasta, but doesn't overpower it....just my opinion.Matter of fact, Most "Old "World" recipes I have ever seen call for straight Olive Oil...no butter at all.

Very easy and tasty recipe!  I did add 1/2 cup white wine and juiced a couple of lemons to the sauce.  I sauce wasn't nearly enough to cover 16oz box of linguine though.  I ended up throwing 1/3 of the noodles away.  It was still delicious!

Those of you making and incorporating a roux, or adding dollops of sour cream, thickners, etc., are NOT making clam sauce and should leave your reviews elsewhere, as appropriate. I don't know what is so difficult in understanding you're being asked to review THIS recipe, not something you've changed so dramatically it no longer can be called by the same name. If you have changes, submit your own recipe. I never understood reviewers who say something like "I didn't have any sugar so I substituded onion salt. I was out of candied ginger so I added bread and butter pickles instead. It was the worst cake I ever ate." That off my chest, this was, as written, DELIOUS!

Good.  I cut the servings to 2, used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil, kept original amount of garlic and added a 1/2 cup of white wine while cooking the mushrooms and garlic.  I can only imagine how fabulous this would be if I had fresh clams to steam instead of canned clams.

I made this the first time as written. There wasn't much clam flavor. The second time after reading the other reviews, I used 3 cans of clams with liquid, 1/4C olive oil, 1/4 C butter, more garlic and a squeeze of 1/2 a lemon. I also used about 1/2 C grated parmesan. No need to thicken as the linguine absorbs the liquid as it sets. Serve with a crusty bread and white wine. Excellent.

This was good, but it was more of a mushroom sauce with linguine, even after I added another can of clams. I love mushrooms, but I wanted clam sauce. I used half butter and half olive oil. I think some fresh basil and oregano would be in order next time, and maybe some white wine in the sauce. Not a bad pasta dish, but not the linguine with clams I'm used to.

I made it exactly like the recipe says.  I will not make it again.  It was edible but too much like a canned sauce.  All the other reviewers changed the recipe.  I would suggest you do the same.  I would add more mushrooms.  I would cook the sauce down - it was too runny.

Very simple and quick recipe. I would add cream as a thickener and do justice to a white clamshell pasta sprinkled with bits of green Italian parsley. Yes, reduce the butter to half. White wine, too after garlic has browned and before adding clamshell and juice.

I used the same way , except no butter (cuts down  fats, and Cholesterol) used Olive oil instead and added a small amount of butter at the end to give it a buttery feel. I also added white wine and served the Parmesan on the side that way does that like their clam taste can be happy. I always steam 1 dozen fresh clams on the shell, makes it so pretty

Great recipe, Silvia!  I used 4 LARGE cloves garlic instead of 3 and doubled the parsley.  I also added a LOT more white pepper to give it more of a kick.  It was delicious!!

Super easy and yummy.  I substituted 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter.  I also used canned mushrooms to make it quick.  I am definitely a novice chef, but my husband raved about this recipe.  We will definitely make it again and again.

This was deeeeeeeeelish!  Linquine with clams is my all time favorite meal, but the addition of mushrooms takes it OVER THE TOP!  I had some baby portabellas which were simply amazing in this dish.  Like other reviewers, I did half butter and half olive oil and I can honestly say it was better than any restaurant!  So simple and so good!

THIS IS EVEN BETTER IF YOU ADD A BIT OF FLOUR TO THE BUTTER, THEN ADD THE CLAM JUICE THEN FINALLY THE CLAMS TO WARM THEM.  IT ALSO WORKS WELL AS A 'CLAM SAUCE PIZZA TOPPING IF YOU MAKE IT THICK ENOUGH.  MICHAEL DEVITA

This is soo good. I did tweek it with sour cream and old bay and added some evaporated milk to make a creamier sauce and thickened it with corn starch. I also used 10 oz can of whole baby clams. I doubled for my family, even the kids liked it. I just did not tell them it had clams in it. lol

I changed the servings for 2, and used one 10 oz. can of clams. Also used a total of 2 1/2 tsp of garlic and added half parsley and half oregano. I also added some white wine. Ate with garlic bread and it was an easy, tasty dinner.

not that great at all... There was a suggestion of doubling the clams - sounded good at first, but it's a disaster!  Don't do it - wayyy too many clams - I love clams and it was even hard for me to choke down..

This has become a new family favorite at my house.  I did follow some others suggestions such as I did add in a couple extra cloves of garlic and added in a splash of white wine to give the sauce some depth.  I also replaced the parsley with a some fresh basil - wonderful!! Can't have this too often 'cause this is not really "calorie friendly" - but a great "cheat treat" every once in a while. Make sure you have some crusty bread to serve with this - the sauce is out of this world

very nice flavour - pretty easy assembly as well  one thing - satueeing the mushrooms for so long soaked up much of the butter and clam juice (and their flavours).... next time i'll sautee the mushrooms separately and add them at the end so they don't suck up all the juice  - also used much more garlic than it called for  served with garlic bread and spinach salad  very good!!  lots of leftovers

Delicious!  Like lots of others, I did half butter/half olive oil.  Make sure and add more garlic, more clams.  Really, really good.

WAY MORE LIQUID! whether it's clam juice, some wine (i added some), or even another can of clams.  The recipe was very tasty, my only objection is that it didn't produce enough liquid.  I didn't even use a full package of pasta.  Great recipe though.

This dish was sooooo good!  I didn't use white pepper because I didn't have any, but black pepper will do just fine.  Also, I added a little white wine into the clam sauce.  Gave it a delicious flavor.

My husband loves Linguine with clam sauce and has been begging me for 6 years to make it for him and it isn't that I don't love him it is just that I don't care for linguine with clam sauce and there are so many recipes to try and so little time to eat.  I might have gone with I deprived him of it for so long and that is why he couldn't stop raving about it (he woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me he dreamed about it).... but no that can't be the case because I thought it was FANTASTIC!  OMGee.  I had a thickening agent all ready for it based on other reviews but it didn't need it.  It was perfect.  Here are the changes I did make:  1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil, doubled the garlic, 2 large cans of baby whole clams with juice, fresh basil instead of parsley, a touch of red pepper flakes and 1/3 cup of white wine (and yes the cooking kind *GASP* because we don't drink wine).

Followed the recipe exactly (as I always do first time out) and it was great! Hubby has european roots and when the kids said "gross mom, my bread got soggy!" (because the sauce is more of a thick broth than a sauce) I told them this is how true Italianos eat, so MOP IT UP! That changed everything and plates were cleaned. Didn't even wash 'em. Just put them on the shelves and ready for the next meal.

This recipe is yummy as is, but I can't resist tinkering!  I used three cans of chopped clams and bought 2 dozen live cherrystone clams.  I also bought a couple of jars of clam juice, and steamed the cherrystones in the clam juice, all of which I saved and reduced by 2/3 to make the sauce.  I also used a head (bulb) of garlic crushed and sauted it with the sliced portobello mushrooms, adding the fresh (shucked) clams and canned chopped clams at the last minute, along with extra olive oil.  Basically, I made an aglio-olio with clams and mushrooms. 
  Toss the pasta with the reduced clam juice and serve with fresh Italian or French bread.  Too good to be true!  This recipe might sound complicated, but it is just as easy as the original.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut it in half for just my husband and me.  I used organic butter and mushrooms.  This turned out to be the best linguine and clam sauce I ever had!  It even beats the linguine and clam sauce at our favorite local Italian eatery!  And it was SO easy to make.  this one is DEFINATELY going into the stand-by dinner rotation!

Upon reading the reviews I made the following changes: (1) Instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup EVOO   (2) I added 1 cup of sauvignon blanc   (3) I added a few dollops of sour cream  (4) I thickened the sauce with corn starch   (5) I added 1/4 of grated parmesan cheese. Ultimately, I enjoyed it very much and I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  I didn't try it, but my rating is based on his comments.  I omitted the mushrooms and added a splash of heavy cream at the end.  He was a fan.

DeeeeeeeLISH! What a wonderful and quick meal for a week night. I did as others suggested and halved the butter and supplemented with olive oil. I used two cans of clams, but only the sauce of one can. I also added onions, red pepper flakes and lemon juice. Wish I had had some white wine lying around, but no such luck. Regardless, this recipe is so simple and yet satisfying! Definitely a repeater!

We LOVED this! I sauteed some finely chopped onion (had a piece that needed to be used up) with the mushrooms and garlic (I used 5 cloves), and added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick and a nice splash of white wine. I'm glad I followed the other reviews and used 3 cans of clams (with all the juice) because I felt that it needed it. I only had dried parsley, so I just added a nice sprinkling and thickened it up slightly with a slurry of corn starch and water. I advise to taste the sauce before adding the salt, as it may not need as much, if any. I just seasoned it to taste. This was truely delicious and I already can't wait to make it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

took a hint from other reviews and undercooked the pasta slightly.  Used 2 undrained cans of clams and one drained can.  Added a splash of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to the sauce and then added the pasta to finish cooking which also help thicken the sauce a bit.  Quick, easy and delicious.

Very easy! I omitted the mushrooms, my husbands loathes them, and took a reviewer's suggestion of adding sour cream and cornstarch to thicken it up. Since I did not use mushrooms, I only used 3 TBSP of butter to saute the garlic. I did not use ground white pepper, simply because I did not have any.

OMG!  So good AND easy!  This recipe will be in my regular rotation from now on.  I almost never makes changes.  But, here's what I did different: 1.  I used medium size shell pasta.  The little pieces of clams end up inside the shells which makes it so much easier to get pasta AND clam in one bite.  The linguine just frustrates me.  lol 2.  I don't like mushrooms with my clam sauce.  So, I didn't use them.  3.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried and it worked just fine. 4.  The first time I made this recipe I just spooned the sauce over the pasta.  DON'T DO THAT.  Add the pasta to the finished clam sauce in the skillet and let simmer a few minutes.  That way the pasta soaks up all the good flavor from the sauce. I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it!

I was doubtful, but this was excellent with the mushrooms! I doubled the garlic and next time would use more. White wine is also a nice addition, but milk or cream changes the taste a bit-- good, but really better without.

The recipe is easy and very tasty. I would prefer less butter and more olive oil.  I halved the recipe and altered it a little.  My recipe was a little spicy for the family and will reduce the amount of pepper flakes next time.  If you double this recipe you will achieve the basic recipe.  I will be making this recipe frequently.    75 g chopped onion 10 g garlic 21 g olive oil 368 g minced clams (2 cans) 130 g clam juice 15 g dry white wine 115 g butter 1 g sea salt 1/4 t black pepper 1/4 t white pepper 1/4 t hot pepper flakes 1/2 T dried parsley

The recipe is fine. It is one I've used for years. The only thing I would suggest is a nice white wine which goes better with fish or sea food.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. There was nowhere near enough sauce, and I used less pasta per other reviews. I wasn't impressed at all.

WONDERFUL!! So easy and tasty! I do add some extra clam juice and/or another can of clams only to make more yummy sauce! It's a standard at our house.

This was a great recipe. Like many others I added a little white wine and a tablespoon or two of sour cream to "thicken" it up. I also used unsalted butter at half the called for amount and used olive oil for the other half. My husband asked me to add it to my permanent recipe box. That says something.

Clam sauce with linquine has been, for many years, one of our favorite dishes.  Simply open a can of white clam sauce, cook up the pasta, add them together, and in no time at all, a pretty good meal.  Those days are long gone.  This recipe has become the only way I will ever eat clams and linquine. Easy to make, and ohhhhhh so flavorable.  This is a winner, and I can think of any way to improve it.  As there is only the two of us, I only used 1/2 lb. of pasta, but the rest was as listed.  Silvia, do you have a recipe for red clam sauce this good???  I would love to try that.  Thanks.

this is a very fast and simple dish that tastes great. I sauteed 1 onion then added then the garlic. Then I added the mushrooms and the 2 cans of clams but only the juice from 1 can. I added a can of cream to thicken it and it was really good

I was very pleasantly surprised by the rich flavor!! I added more garlic,mushrooms and an extra can of clams. The second time I made it I added WHITE WINE (pinot grigio) to the sauce and that took the sauce over the top! I highly suggest you add the white wine!~ Don't forget the freshly grated Parmesano/Regiano  (don't use imitation!)  This I will make for company it's that good!

vv tasty, vv easy.  hardest part was chopping the mushrooms--and how hard is that?  :-)  we added extra garlic (we like it garlicky), cut back a bit on the butter and the "juice", and added a pinch of thyme, and it turned out wonderfully.  served over whole wheat pasta, it was a nice change from the usual chicken and tomato sauce fare.

we will be adding this to our "favorites" rotation!  thank you for the recipe!

The full TSP of salt is tooo much! Fortunately I made the sauce a day before and adjusted by adding a 3rd can of clams and a 1/4+ c of dry white wine and 1/4 cup of water and a 1/2 tsp of oregano.

This was sooooo good!  I put about 10 cloves garlic, and 3 cans of clams.  It turned out great!  Very fast and easy to make--use sliced mushrooms.

4 stars as written. I thought it needed a few more clams. I cut the recipe in half (two of us) and added 2 10oz cans of baby clams-one drained, so it would be a little meatier. Used Baby Bella mushrooms, and added 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio. I used fresh Italian Parsley, but sprinkled it on top with the Parmesan as a garnish. Served this over Angel Hair Pasta because I wanted a thinner pasta this time, but will definitely make this again and try the linguini. Fantastic base recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us, Silvia.

Very easy and fast.  Made a few modifications per other reviewers.  Didn't use butter, just a little olive oil to saute the mushrooms and garlic.  Added some red pepper flakes and white wine.  Drained one of the cans of clams.  Used whole wheat pasta and added to pan to let it soak up sauce before serving.  My daughters really liked it too.

I loved this recipe.  Thank you for posting it.  The reason for the four stars is because the rest of my family didn't like it.

Very yummy!  The only changes i made were use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil, instead of all butter, and double the amount of garlic.  My 11 year old daughter has requested this two times in the last two weeks!

Great recipe. My 2 year old and 3 year old boys even loved it. Our budget is tight so I had to use dried parsley and canned mushrooms, but it was still wonderful. I bet it is out of this world with fresh parsley and mushrooms.

Very good recipe. I did not add the mushrooms because I felt they would take away from the flavor of the clams but otherwise very happy with this dish.

Excellent!!!! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out DELICIOUS! Not only is it dirt cheap, but it's really quick. The only problem I had was 16oz of pasta is far too much. Half ended up in the trash. Next time I will double everything but the pasta, and use half butter, half olive oil. Also, an extra can of whole clams added to the two cans of chopped cans would make it even better. I LOVE this recipe!!

YEAH - one awesome recipe, although I cheated  and used garlic infused olive oil.  I only used 1 clove garlic, and left the mushrooms whole, no salt, no parmesan. Nice recipe. Silvia, thanks for sharing.

This is a good recipe. I also added some white wine to decrease the smell from the canned clam.

Great recipe!  Super easy too!  The only things I changed were I added 1 clove of garlic and used black pepper instead of white.  My family ate it up, and I've already been asked to make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this! My husband had never had clam sauce and he was a fan. From reading all of the reviews I thought this would be really runny, but found it to be perfect. I had even bought bread to "sop" up the liquid but it was not even runny enough for that, it was perfect! I fully expected to use flour after reading the reviews but did not. I did add a little wine and I think it is key to chop the whole bunch of parsley and throw in another handful when it is done, really adds color and freshness. I also put about a 1/4 cup of the pasta liquid in to thicken it a bit. I served on fancy plates and my hubby said it was like going out to eat, it only cost about 7.50 for the whole meal including my french bread!

My husband has requested this about 5 times in the past 2 weeks. It is so easy, I have no problem fulfilling his request!  I don't know why anyone would bother with canned white clam sauce when this is so delicious and sooo easy.  I sometimes put a dollop of sour cream in at the end if I have any in the fridge for a richer sauce, but it is great as is, too.  And so cheap!

Oh my gosh......I had to log on specifically JUST to rate this dish (as a matter of fact, I am still eating....seconds). This is so tasty! The only thing I added was a splash of white wine (with the mushroom & butter & garlic). Even my kids (6yrs & 5yrs) love it. I would give this 10 stars! Simple, fast, AND flavorful!

I used angel hair pasta because that's all I had on hand and it was delicious!  It was "watery" like some have said but we had it in our pasta bowls and I don't think I'll change a thing the next time we have it.

My husband really liked this dish.  I cut it in half for the two of us, but then used an extra can of clams without juice, as suggested by another reviewer.  I added the parmesan to the sauce, which rendered it a bit salty.  When I'm feeling fancy, I plan to use fresh clams - but this is a great mid-week dinner.  Thanks!

This recipe is easy, delicious and, best of all, cheap!  My husband and I loved it and will be making it again and again!  The only suggestion I have is to put extra clams into the sauce.  Otherwise, this is a perfect recipe!

Was very good and easy to make. The only thing I added was a handfull of flour in about a cup of milk. Mixed that then dumped it in the sauce.  Sauce turned out perfect. I was surprised at the taste. I was leary at first and thought it would have a fishy taste but it doesnt really.  Very good.

Quick, easy, and delicious (with a couple of changes)! I scaled the ingredients to make just one serving for myself. Used half butter/half olive oil, and added 1/4 cup dry white wine (really makes a difference, I think). Took less than 10 minutes to make. Will definitely be keeping this in my regular rotation of recipes!

This is the best clam sauce I've ever had!  I used about half the mushrooms and double the garlic...and it's perfect.  I would use more clams and go the full pound of mushrooms though next time.   I like a lot of stuff in my pasta

I gave it 5 stars because the flavor is great! The "juice" was a bit too juicy for us.  I did thicken it a bit to more of a "gravy" consistency, and we loved it - definately will make again (and we added some red pepper flakes, too - we like ours with a bit of a bite!!)

AWESOME! My family loved this recipe and requested I make it again soon! One thing that I really liked about this recipe was that it didn't have a heavy cream sauce like some clam sauces. I am sensitive to milk so this recipe was perfect! At first my family was skeptical about a clam sauce without cream, but after tasting this recipe they absolutely loved it and said that they actually liked this recipe better than the recipes with cream. Thanks for sharing!

I made this using some recommedations from other reviewers:  using 1/4 c. EVOO and 1/4 c. butter; increasing garlic to 5 cloves; adding a bit of flour to thicken.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  I thought the results were very bland, unfortunately.  I wonder if adding a splash of white wine would help?  I will try again.  Thanks!

I read a lot of the reviews on this and really liked what Andrea2289 did and followed her suggestions very closely.  It was totally amazing!  We had it with french bread that we dipped in the broth. So good!  I noticed that a lot of people added cream or sour cream to this.  I think they mistakenly thought this was supposed to be a cream sauce??  I added even more chicken stock and clam juice to have more broth for dipping.  This is a keeper!  A fairly inexpensive nice meal for a large family!

This recipe was for the most part good. I tried using 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil like other reviewer's suggested, but I think the olive oil made the noodles feel too oily in my mouth. Next time, I'll use less olive oil and add another can of clams for the juice. I also added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce.

This recipe was so delicious!  Adjusted the recipe for 10 people and made a few changes.  I added in an extra can of chopped clams, a small amount of white wine and a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also threw in some basil and some crab boil seasoning for a bit of extra flavor and heat.  The sauce was garlicy and sooo yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great for a quick week-night meal.  I added 2 tbsp of white wine and used dried Parsley (since the groundhog had a yummy dinner with my fresh herbs this week).  Add garlic bread and a nice salad and you have a great quick and really easy meal!!  Thanks!!!!

One of my new favorites.  I usually cut back a bit on the butter and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup white cooking wine and a handful of whatever Italian herbs I have in the garden.  So simple & quick.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good.  I like the mushrooms but prefer clam sauce with olive oil and butter mixed and lots of lemon juice.

Delicious...my fiance and I were practically licking our plates.  I tweeked the recipe slightly.  I added about 1/4 cup of chardonnay, lemon juice from half a lemon and used only salt to taste (since the clam juice already had some salt). For a kick, I'd also add a dash of red pepper flakes.

I loved this dish.  I was a little hesitant to use canned clams but this dish was excellent.  The only advice I have is to omit the salt.  The canned clams has enough salt to make the dish very tasty!!!

This was very good and easy to make.
The only differences I made in the recipe was using almost a teaspoon of roasted minced garlic and about 2 tsp. of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little.   I also added shrimp and used angel hair pasta.

Very easy. I took suggestions & added more clams, garlic & white wine. When I make this again I'm only going to use the juice from 1 can of clams because it was to much liquid with the wine.  I liked the flavor the wine gives.

I had to make a few changes. Instead of mushrooms, I used I used one pound of Imitation Crab meat.  I was out of Linguini, also. So I used Speghetti, unstead. I forgot to take a picture! My husband loved it so much, he remarked," NOW, you have to make it again... so you can take the picture!

Pretty darn good but just a little bland.  Added extra spices, garlic, white pepper and basil.  The additions made it nearly a 5. Felt that the ingredient ratios were off.  Used 9 oz or fett. and 1/2 of mushrooms.  Thanks

This recipe was fabulous! I didn't have the white pepper so I used black instead. I also added a few more cloves of garlic because we are garliholics here. This was very easy to make and my family loved it. The mushrooms really made it special. I'm putting this one in rotation.

Love this! I made a few changes like others have suggested:
Near double garlic
1/4 c white wine
1/4c olive oil (instead of vegetable)
1/4t dried basil
1/4t lemon pepper
Shaved cheese
I sauteed the garlic in 2tb butter until fragrant and starting to become golden, added the dried basil and some parsley, and the remaining butter until melted. I added the wine and simmered, clams (with juice) and simmered, then olive oil. I added a little shaved cheese, and some premade roux to thicken, and then pasta water until desired consistency.
Would DEFINITELY make this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe states, minus the mushrooms (only because I didn’t have them available). It is the best version I’ve tried so far for linguine with clam sauce!

Surprised by the great flavor without white wine in the sauce. Easy, quick and delicious. A trifecta!

Made this for my husband who had been craving linguine with clam sauce. Came out great!  He said it was better than he imagined and the mushrooms were an added bonus. I thought the white pepper made it perfect and I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was to prepare. I might do half butter and half olive oil the next time I make this but that's a personal choice.  thanks for sharing!

I'll make this again and again.   The only change to make for my taste is that I NEVER use canned minced or chopped clams-- they're already overcooked and can taste like you're chewing on a rubber band. Instead,  I used canned whole baby clams.   Otherwise,  it's a fast,  light,  delicious change from marinara.   Great stuff!

Very good!  I followed the advice to add a bit of olive oil, good white wine and a little bit of corn starch (not too much) to thicken it up and it made it a 5 star recipe.

We really like this.  The only problem I had was the thiness of the sauce. So, like others, I thickened it up some. All 4 of us, even the g-dau that said she didn't like clams. My partner said he ate so much, he could hardly move. Thanks for sharing. I'd make again soon, but the cost of clams has jumped to $3.25 each. Way over my budgetary issues for shopping. But when I do, this is the recipe I'll return to.

It was easy to put together.  I used fresh clams and added white wine, capers and some sundried tomatoes. Still I feel it needs something else to make as good as an Italian restaurant. I’ll Keep adjusting the recipe and will advise if I get it right.

The addition of white wine earns this recipe the fifth star. It’s very quick and easy. Add white wine and freshly grated Parma reggiano . It’s a keeper !

We have been making and tweaking this for years.  We substitute olive oil for most of the butter and melt 4 or 5 anchovies with the olive oil then add onions & fresh baby spinach,. Lately started adding some chicken broth and simmering for a bit before adding mushrooms (sautéed ahead of time) and clams at the end to warm. Add a little cayenne at the beginning, lemon juice and dry white  wine near end if you want. Makes a great dinner, and only gets better after a day or two in fridge.

This is our "go-to" recipe for clams linguine.  It's super easy to fix and inexpensive.  My seven yo grandson really likes it.  I usually fix it with three cans of clams, only 8oz of mushrooms, 12oz of pasta, and cut the salt in half.  We have this a couple of times a month.  Left-overs (if any) will keep well in the fridge for a few days.

I thought this was kind of "meh" actually. I mean it's basically butter-tossed pasta with some clams mixed in. Definitely needs something to kick it up.

A white sauce with the clams goes much better IMO. This one might have gone better with some different, more flavorful, seasonings.

Came so good! I made this before just off the top of my head but following this recipe was the perfect amount of butter, etc. I usually add white wine but followed this instead and didn't miss it at all! I did leave out the mushrooms per our preference and added a few fresh clams for presentation...really good!!

Good but not great.  I think with some of the changes recommended by others it would be much better.  Like adding white wine.  I used whole clams and half butter, half olive oil.  I use another recipe that calls for heavy cream which would also make it better.  So, all told think it might be easier to use my other recipe and just add the mushrooms to it!

Close, but not perfect.  I added a few things that really made it shine, and easier.  A heaping spoonful of minced garlic from the jar  tastes just as good as your garlic cloves.  I used a can of mushrooms and left the liquid in for flavor (fresh mushrooms still work great).  I cranked up the heat and reduced the liquid until the garlic was able to brown.  Then added a dash of white  cooking wine and reduced the heat before adding the clams.  A whole large can of baby clams worked great.  I used dried parsley flakes and added some dried basil which added just the right zip.

So simple yet mind blowingly good! I went half butter, have olive oil, double the clams, dried parsley and opted to add a splash of half and half mixed with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in 1 teaspoon of water. No leftovers at all! Fast and impressive!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was very good. However, next time I will add more garlic and more mushrooms, and if I have any handy, some white wine.

Delicious simple recipe. I didn't add mushrooms but was still good. I added white wine, some bottled clam juice, fresh grated Parmesan and crushed red pepper into the sauce. It needed a little thickness so I added a little cornstarch.  I used a ton of fresh parsley!  Don't be afraid to use too much. Restaurant quality meal!

This is my "go-to" emergency dinner recipe.  I keep dried mushrooms, canned clams, and linguine on hand at all times.  Tonight is one of those "It's 8 PM, what's for dinner" nights and I'm fixing this.   I add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce, but otherwise make it exactly as written.  LOVE this.  Thank you, Sylvia.

My whole family loved this recipe!!!  They all said it was restaurant quality.  The only thing I did different was doubled the recipe and cut out some of the clam juice and replaced it with white wine.  It was awesome!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Wow, this was awesome. Like previous reviewers I made some tweaks...used 1/4 cup butter and a 1/4 cup olive oil, plus a splash of white wine, red pepper flakes to taste, 5 garlic cloves and fresh minced clams. The key to this is the fresh minced clams I got at the fish section of my supermarket. Add crusty Italian bread and a nice Chardonnay and you're golden.

Mmmmm....I thinly sliced red, yellow orange and green peppers and simmered them in the clam sauce.  I didn't have mushrooms and this substitution still made a delicious nutritious meal.

Modifications- One can of clams and one can of oysters instead of 2 cans of clams

Added a  1/4 cup of milk and 2 tbsp flour to thicken the sauce. 

Really yummy. Tasted as I would have imagined it to taste if I ordered this at a restaurant.

I've made some adjustments to our family's taste. This is great basic recipe and fun for viewers tweak here and there! This is what I did: 1) I half and halved with butter and olive oil. 2) then added pinch of red pepper flakes for heat 3) in addition to garlic, I had 1 large shallot minced ( I wanted more flavor!) 4) then after browning shallot & garlic, I had 2 pounds of fresh clam on shell that I bought from fish market, so I drop them in the pot along with 2 can clams with juice! 5) I'm addition, I also poured in 1/3 cup of white wine 6) finally, I added 2 fresh roma tomatoes, peeled and diced, and follow the remaining recipe as shown. I let it simmered enough to reduce the sauce and it was SOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!! FLAVORFUL!!! My hubby literally drank the remaining sauce on his plate!!! Thanks for teaching me the basic of linguini with clams!! :)

This recipe was great! I never realized how tasty clams in a can could be. I did tweak the recipe slightly to my taste in that I added a third can of clams and also added a quarter cup of white wine, which really helped to further bring out the flavor of the clams and add another dimension to the dish. My family cleaned their plates in no time and went back for seconds! It's so easy, straight-forward, and delicious. Will definitely make again.

I tweak this a little bit and don't use mushrooms.  Add a tiny bit more garlic.  It is so much better than some of restaurants who serve the same.  Served with nice glass of white wine!  Yum!

I read through many of the reviews & decided to double the amount of clams and substitute olive oil for half the butter.  Excellent tip about finishing the pasta in the sauce!  Excellent!

Truly a 5-star recipe.  I used only 1/4 cup of butter; otherwise, made no changes.  This has become one of my very favorite dishes.

Very good!  As others mentioned, I used a 1/2 and 1/2 butter to olive oil ratio.  Sautéed chopped shallots along with the garlic.  Added 1 extra can of clams and thickened at the end with a bit of mascarpone.  Used parsley/garlic linguini and let the cooked pasta soak in the sauce for a few minutes before plating.  There was nothing left - both kids (11 & 13) ate every bite and the hubs finished what little was leftover in the pan.  Had parmesan and red pepper flakes on the table to add if wanted.  Will do again!

I can't say that I didn't enjoy this recipe, but it was different.  I don't know what I did worng but my cheese clumped together horribly and the sause didn't coat the noodles.  I did thicken it, but I expected more.  Don't get me wrong the sauce was fantastic.... but the clumps of cheese just turned me off.

Fantastic!  I used canned crab meat as that was what I had, and used less butter, and a touch of olive oil.  So easy, and the family loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe had so many mushrooms I couldn't find the clams!  Next time I will cut the mushrooms by half and add a splash or 2 of white wine.  Good basic recipe tho!

I loved this recipe.  I took another reviewers suggestion and added some Old Bay and a two dollops of sour cream.  I added a small can of mushrooms and chopped them up as well.  My husband liked this as well but would have preferred more clams in it (maybe a can or whole clams or real clams) but I am not a big clam fan.  I did love the recipe with the chopped clams.  So you can add some more clams if you like them, this recipe is easy to adapt.

After reading this recipe the basics of it sounded good but I wanted to spice it up a bit.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes, capers, and I threw in some jumbo lump crab and raw shrimp at the end.  The flavor was very good before I added the pasta to the pan.  Once I added the pasta, I felt that there was not enough sauce for the 1 pound of pasta that the recipe calls for.  So I felt like it was a little dry and some of the flavor was lost.  I will make this again but only use 8oz of pasta instead of 16oz.

Tasted Great! only a few changes, used dried parsley, added white wine (only about 1/4 cup) and thickened it a bit with some flour. Then due to personal preference topped the finished plate with a bit of cilatro and a squeeze of lemon.

I enjoyed this recipe, but my boyfriend insisted that his mom's recipe is better. Will try hers next time instead.

Very nice!  My husband and I made this for our "date night" and it turned out really well.  We did add a little sour cream as per other's suggestions.  We paired this with a green salad, some crusty bread and white wine...yum!

I enjoyed this recipe, and I feel any fault of it was my own. I used too much pasta and ended up with not enough sauce. Everything else was great. Simple, not fancy company worth, but good. Will make again, but with more sauce!

This was pretty good, but I had to add additional garlic and quite a bit of lemon juice for my family's taste.  I don't know if I'd make it again.

This was a very good recipe. I found that the parmesean cheese was unnecessary so I will save the calories and the cash next time!

Very Good and super easy.
I didn't have linguine noodles so I used Spaggetti noodles and my husband will not eat fresh mushrooms so they didn't make it in.  But it was still very good.
