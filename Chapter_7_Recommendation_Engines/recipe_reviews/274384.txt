I added 2Tbls. Cottage Cheese and 1 Tbls. Crema Honduran, in substitute of the Cream Cheese. Also I added a pinch of Mozzarella on top of Parmesan Cheese. And, I laid 2 Tbls. Crema Honduran on the plate, before laying the baked stuffed crepe on it. Also added chives and Mozzarella to the top of the gravy. Yum This was great.

I made this and really liked the flavors.  The recipe was a little lacking in gravy.  I would increase the amount of gravy ingredients the next time.  There was also too much filling for the number of crepes.  You could reduce the filling ingredients a little more or increase the number of crepes you make.  Good recipe!  I will make this again.

Loved this! Very easy! The hubby & my little loved these! Didn't make any alterations with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp. Thyme to the crepe batter for a little extra savory touch to an other wise bland batter. Next time we will add spinach to the mushroom mixture & a little mozzarella as well.

Loved the idea of making little packets.  Made my own broth and chicken by simmering legs.  Doubled the sauce.

The whole family loved it. I used my own crepes recipe. The filling  was on point, but the gravy wasn't so good. Might need to use different recipe.
