Great idea for using day old bread and on hand ingredients but my family didn't really care for this recipe. My husband took one bite of his, then refused to eat any more. :(

I hate to give a bad review but I didn't like them at all. I thought the mustard would be weird and it definitely was. I will  not be making this again.

This is realtively easy  and if you are tired of just eating regular toast or not a fan of cinnamon toast,this is it! I have made this 3 or 4 times before but this is the first time I have reviewed it. And I will suggest to all who makes it,put on plenty of cheese (according to how you like it),it will taste so much better.

This was just ok.  You definetly have to remove the crusts before putting in the oven or they will burn.

This was nice and crispy on top and tender on bottom. I liked the way that turned out. The mustard flavor I wasn't sure about. It wasn't unpleasant, just different I guess. I used plain yellow mustard. I haven't decided whether I liked this enough to fix it again, but it isn't a definite no go either. Overall this is something a little different and maybe it just needs to pair with the right entree and side dish to make it work.

Super easy and very tasty!  I used small slices of french bread and left the crusts on.  I mixed the cheese right into the mayo/mustard and then spread it onto the bread slices.

These were delicious! Next time I will toast the bread before putting it under the broiler, mine never got very crispy.

Very tasty. I lightly brushed a oven tray with extra virgin olive oil, then laid the pieces of bread down. The only downfall is that it is actually better with the crust on and uncut.I used wholegrain mustard. Very good and so quick!
