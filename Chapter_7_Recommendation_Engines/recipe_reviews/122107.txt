I made this punch for my sister-in-laws bridal shower and forgot to add the tea! I didn't even notice until after the party when I found the box of tea unopened. It was such a big hit I had to make a few bowls of it and they still wanted more after I ran out of ginger ale and lemonade. I will be making it again next week for my best friends bridal shower, but this time I will have A LOT prepared ahead of time. It was great without the tea so I will skip it this time too!

Made it for a bridal shower & it was a huge hit.  I was inclined not to put the sugar in it, but after tasting it I went ahead & added the sugar, and it really hit the spot.  Very refreshing!

I just made this punch for my sister's bridal shower.  Needless to say it was a big hit.  Everyone asked me what the recipe was.  I think next time I might use a 7up or Sprite instead.  I thought the tea would be too strong in the drink but it was great!  I did use fresh strawberries in it, which worked fine.  Overall a great drink and I'll definitely make it again.

Really delicious and simple punch!  I made it for my friend's baby shower and got lots of compliments on it.  It was just the right amount of sweet and tart.

I'm giving this four stars because the guests at the baby shower I hosted liked it, but I personally thought it was too sweet.  And I used diet ginger ale!!

This was really good. Will definitely be making it again this season. I skipped the tea and use sprite instead of ginger ale and it turned out great.

This was pretty good.  Definately sweet and fruity.  I think I will make it with lemon lime soda next time because I'm not a huge fan of ginger.  I'm looking forward to it next time.

Made this for my daughter's 5th birthday party.  Should have made a double recipe because it was a hit!  VERY easy and refreshing.  We used our own strawberries from the garden and froze them.  YUMMY!  Not too sweet - just right for a warm summer day.

Excellent!  Not too sweet.  Added partially thawed strawberries to the punch to make it pretty.  Great for a crowd.

Great way to get me to drink green tea!  I added maple syrup instead of the sugar and one package of Crystal Lite instead of the frozen concentrate - it's a keeper ;)
