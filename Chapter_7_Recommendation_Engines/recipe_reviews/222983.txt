I made this with lighter counterparts of the ingredients called for. I used reduced fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, sugar free pudding mixes, reduced fat evaporated milk, reduced fat sour cream and "light" whipped topping. When I assembled the pie, I made a pie crust out of Nilla Wafers and butter, then a layer of sliced bananas and I spread the pudding mix over the top of the sliced bananas. Even with the lighter ingredients, this turned out fantastic! I'd like to play with this recipe and see if I can't make frozen pudding pops out of it. I bet that would be amazing. Quite happy with how this turned out. It was SO easy!

This recipe was quite good. There is two ways you can really do this recipe...one with the whip topping in it or without it in the mix. Either way, it's a nice change from the norm. It was totally thick and fluffy. You really don't need to add extra whip topping when making the traditional layered banana pudding. I only added a little to the very top when I assembled. Other then that...it was something my kids will enjoy again. TY

I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES AND CROSSED TWO RECIPES 

Banana Pudding Surprise & No Cook Banana Pudding Base

1 package of both banana and vanilla pudding instant
4 cups of water
6 green bananas
2 boxes of vanilla wafers
1 can of coconut cream
1 large tub of cool whip
2 cups of either frozen or fresh cut up fruit of your choice

I used a pan big enough to be able to do 2 -3 layers of each wafers, banana, whip cream 

1st mix both types of pudding with milk and allow to chill for 2 hours
in meantime if using frozen fruit take out to allow to start to thaw
also allow coconut cream to chill as well
take out and allow whip cream to semi thaw not too much about 30 mins out of freezer
get pan ready with a layer of wafers 

in a bowl mix one large scoop of whip cream and a 1/4 of coconut cream whip together
fold in some fruit here is you like

on the layer of wafers spread pudding about 1/4 
cut up banana about 2 and layer on top of pudding
spread a layer of mixed whip cream 
repeat until done 
cover is you can and either serve right away or allow to chill more its up to you

I didn't have whipped topping and I don't like banana instant pudding or sliced bananas LOL. Instead I blended about 6 ripe medium bananas with about 8 ounces of evaporated milk. Because of this I only used 2 cups of cold milk. I also used two packages of vanilla pudding. Came out very delicious and rich.  It was easy to make with my 6 year old. The whole family loved it!

Deliciousness. Followed this base recipe, but sub-ed banana cream and French vanilla pudding flavors, used just half the can of condensed milk and the whole box of wafers.  I also made scratch whipped cream.  Texture was rich, silky, not overly sweet.  Legit 5 stars.

I have made this recipe numerous times.  I HATE fake banana pudding so I only use the vanilla pudding in this.  The mixture of the cream cheese, sour cream, sweetened condensed milk....make this to die for!  I made this for a friend for her birthday and she actually cried on her first bite.  This is not  joke.  I use about 7-9 bananas and I use the small vanilla wafers as I just prefer the taste of the miniature wafers in this dish.  You can also make this with pineapple instead of bananas.  

By far, this is the BEST no-cook Banana Pudding recipe there is.
