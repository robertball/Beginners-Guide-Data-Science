Made this as is, and it was devoured by my family! We are lovers of pad thai, and everyone said it was better than in the restaurants. So yummy!

It was delicious and a big hit for my guests.  Also a fun meal round a table of six -- passing the extra toppings adds a bit of personal creativity.  Everyone had seconds, so it was definitely a hit.  It did take some time before had chopping and readying, but all except the cooking was done before guests arrived, so only a few moments in the kitchen to serve piping hot when ready to eat!  Yes, I would definitely make it again!

Best recipe we’ve found yet! Perfect balance of PB and sweet red tang. To please the palates here, I used chicken, less cayenne, skipped the egg and added more sweet chili sauce.

It was delicious. Made it exactly as directed, except I added some extra veges (a red bell pepper sliced, some napa cabbage chopped) and omitted the bean sprouts as I didn't have any on hand.

This dish turned out wonderfully and I think you could use any meat other than prawns and it would taste great or no meat

I made this tonight for hubby who is a lover of Pad Thai.  He gave it a 9.5 out of 10!  I did make a few changes only because I was missing ingredients.  I did not have fish sauce, so I threw in a glop (heaping TBS) of hoisin sauce.  I did not have sweet chili sauce but added 1 TBS of spicy chili sauce instead.  I skipped the cayenne and chili pepper flakes only because I didn't want to make it too spicy.  According to hubby, I could have added a little more spice, so maybe 2 TBS of spicy chili sauce or maybe add some flakes to taste.  Aside from those couple of changes, I stuck to the recipe.  Honestly, I was super happy with the results.  Thank you for an easy yet delicious recipe!
