Great recipe!  I love angel hair pasta and fresh chives.  This was so delicious.  I threw in "Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic" from this site.  This makes a great side dish or main dish depending on what you do with it.

I gave this five stars eventhough I did not put in everything in the angel hair pasta. I put 2 cloves of garlic like recommended in the water, a liberal amount of kosher salt and boiled the pasta as recommended on the package. I placed 1/4 C real butter and about 1/4 C parsley and that is it! I did not use any parmesan cheese because I was making parmesana Chicken and thought it would have been cheese overkill, did not use chives, because I don't have any, nor garlic salt. The way I did it was fantastic!!!!! Will use again, Thanks for a great basic recipe that is what I was looking for!

Love the garlic flavor in this one!  I'm amazed at the flavor the pasta gets just when it's cooked with the garlic in the water.  I think I'll be cooking pasta that way from now on.  The dish was good, I made it as written but I think I'll try to make it more of a main dish by adding some fresh tomatoes and maybe grilled chicken.  This recipe does call for quite a bit of butter but the pasta dried out a little once it was no longer steaming hot.  I added a little olive oil and it was great.

This is the most fabulous thing EVER.  I have no idea why I didn't think to add the garlic to the pasta while cooking.  Delicious and not over powering like garlic can be sometimes (and I LOVE my garlic).  Will definately do this for every pasta recipe that needs garlic from now on.  Thanks.

This is great.  I put in more cloves than it called for also.  I did fix it up and left in pan as I went to pick up the kid.  The flavors melded together, well.  I would recommend leaving the garlic cloves in as you mix the butter and parm cheese.  Thanks!!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and felt that it was a hit. I used jarred minced garlic and thought that adding it to the water was what made it perfect. My husband likes garlic in little doses and I can't get enough of it. This was a great way to come to a compromise. Make sure you stir the pasta until all of the parmesan cheese has melted. I got caught up with other things that were cooking and I had clumps of cheese in the pasta. I will definately make this again.

I could live off this stuff.  (Omit garlic salt, don't add garlic to water.  Use all ingredients to taste)

I cooked the Angel Hair pasta according to package directions, but omitted adding the garlic to the water. Once I drained the pasta, I reserved some of the cooking water to add to the pasta later when I mixed everything together. I added a little olive oil and a tab of butter to the pot and heated it up. I minced up a couple of garlic cloves, tossed it in the pot with the oil/butter and let it cook on low heat until it got fragrant. The garlic, oil and butter aroma was a sweet and pleasant smell. I added the cooked pasta and mixed everything in the pot. I seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt, Parmesan cheese and fresh chopped chives. I gently tossed the pasta noodles to coat everything evenly. The Parmesan cheese and chives are flavorful additions that make this dish complete. The garlic, chives and butter flavored the pasta wonderfully. This side dish can also serve as a main course with some chicken or shrimp tossed in. A very simple and flavorful side dish with pleasing results! Tonight, I served this with, “Chicken Parmesan Bundles,” and “Bacon Bean Stalks,” also from this website.

We love garlic and really enjoyed these noodles as a side with Easy Olive Martini Chicken.  As suggested by hubby, I'm going to start adding garlic whenever I cook spaghetti noodles too for the extra flavor.

Loved it as did my family.  I used the whole little package of chives and needed to double the butter but it was great.  I heated the butter in a separate pan and added the seasoning and then poured it on the noodles.   Then tossed with the parmesan cheese

Delicious! I followed the reviews to add some olive oil to keep it moist and I used parsley instead of chives. It was wonderful. A mild yet flavorful side. I served it with baked fish. Even my husband who cringed when I told him what was for dinner admitted this was a whole lot better than he thought it would be. That's pretty good!

I didn't put that much butter (a little more than half of the 1/4 c) and it turned out fine. I thought it was excellent. I thought adding the garlic salt enhanced the flavor of the pasta.

This recipe is a bit too dry and bland for my palate.  I added more cheese and more butter but it still really lacked that zing.  I am one of those people who doesn't eat pasta with butter so that could be the first problem. If I try this recipe again, I think I'm going to add a bit of lemon zest and some pancetta to add to the flavor.

This was very good! I doubled the butter (used 1 stick) and the parmesan cheese (used 1/2 cup). We had it as a main dish and I served with some French bread. I'll definitely make this again. Very light and good, great for summer.

This was so simple and quite tasty!  My boys arrived home later than usual so I left my noodles in the pot.  When they got home most of the water had soaked up so I just mixed the butter and parm in (leaving the slivered garlic in).  My boys ate it up.  This was a great side that will compliment any dish, rather than compete with it.  Thank you!

Great base garlic pasta recipe. I add more garlic back into the butter when I simmer it, and I do not use the parmesan as I usually use this as a base for another recipe, in my photo for example, artichoke chicken is crumbled on top as its so moist. Love this recipe though, add or omit garlic as you please! Wonderful!

Simple and delicious! The garlic in the water add's so much flavor, I'll use this trick often in the future. I added about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and sprinkled with green onion before serving. Excellent recipe, thanks:)

Very yummy.  My boys enjoyed this dish and it was super easy to make.  I used mince garlic since that's what I had on hand and it stll worked well.  I like this because it imitates the box pastas but without all the sodium! Will for sure make again

Very Good!!  To cut down on calories I used light butter and saved some of the cooking liquid so it would not dry out.  I did add more cheese, used minced garlic and did not remove it and added a few shakes of dried parsley for color.  Went over very well with husband and oldest son.

Quick and easy! I will use this recipe again. The only thing I did differently was to serve platefuls and then sprinkle garlic salt and parmesan on each serving. It was just easier that way for me.

This is a great pasta side dish. I liked that you cooked it with the garlic but discarded it after it was cooked. (The kids don't like the pieces of garlic) I did add sliced baby carrots to the water while the pasta was boiling, trying to get the kids more veggies.

This was a nice hot meal and so quick and easy to fix. I used minced garlic from the jar and spiral pasta.  I thought this needed some kick though and could have used a healthy dose of cayenne or crushed red pepper as well. Not bad, but I thought it was too bland for me.

I used a whole stick of butter because it was a little dry for me.  But it was really good! I will make this again.

This is a very handy recipe to have.  It makes a great side dish with dinner or a quick lunch with a salad on the side.  I use parsley rather than chives and add some herb-infused olive oil at the end of preparation to keep the pasta from sticking together & for added flavor.  I like to use a mixture of both fresh grated parm (1/4 cup) and the grated parm in the can (just a few good shakes).  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

perfect accompaniment to almost all dishes! the taste is flavourful and yet does not overwhelms the main dish. i tried this with oven baked chicken and in the end i poured the grease/oil/juice into the pasta and the result was pleasing.

Great recipe!  Definitely mince the garlic and add more cheese.  Substitute some of the butter with olive oil.  This goes well with the Lemon Garlic Tilapia and some veggies.

This was a nice change from my usual 'naked noodles'...it was a challenge but I followed the recipe instead of doing what I normally do! The garlic was subtle but there. I do feel there was too much butter, but otherwise this was perfect.

This tasted very good.  I did a couple of things differently than the recipe states. First, I added a splash of olive oil to the water while cooking the noodles, and I did not discard the garlic after draining the noodles.  I also added another splash of olive oil to the finished dish, as it got a little clumpy.  In the end though, this was a very easy and delicious side dish that I will make again.

This was a good light meal for our family.  My husband and I both enjoyed it as did all 3 kids, although my 14 year old wanted a little more "something" in it.  She couldn't really say what, but this is the same child who thinks you have to have meat with every meal.  I followed the recipe as stated only I used fettuccine noodles since I had those on hand and adding a bit extra garlic to the water.  I also used parsley instead of chives.  

Nice, light and good on a hot summer day.

Super good and easy for my husband to make. We didn't add garlic to the boiling water.  We melted the butter in the pan then added the minced garlic until fragrant and tossed everything else except the garlic salt.

Great, easy recipe.  Next time I make this I will add more fresh garlic instead of garlic salt but only b/c I LOVE garlic.  It was still great without it.
