I didn't have self-rising flour but you can make your own. For ONE cup of all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

Diana trusted me, and I trusted the AR peeps. We made these to christen the new mini-muffin pan we bought. This pan has 24 holes, so we made a batch of 24 and then a batch of 6. We thought they were good, and understand the reviews left here. I agree that this is a BASIS recipe and is wide-open to tweaks and taste chnages - like add chilli, and/or garlic, use other cheeses etc etc etc. But they should carry a warning ... we nibbled these as we chatted over a glass of wine and were shocked toi find that 18 had disappeared. And then we remembered the second batch still in the oven! They weren't burnt but severely sun-tanned. And we actually thought that they just might even have tasted better. Slightly thicker outer skin, but the cheese came though much more strongly! I will be making these often. And by the way, after consuming 18 between us, we weren't hungry any more, so we put all the stuff for dinner back into the fridge for use today!

This is a good basic recipe.  I omitted the oil and just sauteed the onions carrots in the bacon drippings.  It seemed a little bland when I tasted the batter, so I added some garlic powder and a little oregano to give it a little zing.  This lend itself to all sorts of variations.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty, both hot and cold. I got 24 mini-muffin-sized bites instead of 12. I used 1-1/2 small zucchinis instead of 1 large, and replaced some of the parmesan (about 1/4 cup) with shredded monterey jack cheese. I added a clove of garlic to the pan with the onions and added a pinch of paprika to the mixture, and they turned out quite flavorful. Next time I may add a bit of chili powder to spice them up, but they were great as-is.

These were amazing!! I didn't have the self rising flour so I made my own from Canadian Mama suggestion :) I didn't have large zucchinis so I used two small ones, 2 carrots, real bacon bits, 1/2 and 1/2 cream and bacon drippings instead of olive oil. I made them to go with soup for lunch and my 2 and 5 yr olds didn't even touch the soup, just the "muffins" ;) I also made them in the reg size muffin cups and it made a full dozen. There's only one left for my husband to try, and they came out of the oven an hour ago lol. I think I may try to double or triple the batch and freeze them for quick breakfasts or to go with soup.

Loved this recipe.   My husband loved it also, which is important to us wives.  I had too much salt because I forgot that self-rising flour and the grated cheese(I use the fresh cheese not the shaker) had salt in them, but other that that - perfect.  It put me in the mind of quiche!  Thanks for the recipe.  Great way to use up all of that garden produce.

I was skeptical because of the amount of onion/veggies in here, but "wow" is all I can say! These were delicious (thanks bacon, haha). I'm not sure what size mini pan the recipe creator used, but I ended up with about 36 minis.

These are delicious. They are a great snack by themselves, but would also be great with soup or chili. I made half a batch, filled the muffin cups full, and got 9 muffins. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Yummy! Versatile recipe, add whatever grated/chopped up veggies &/or cheeses that you want to the mix. You don't have to use a muffin tray; they bake up just as nicely if you drop rounded spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet. I got 18 servings out of this recipe. Thank you for posting.

These weren't bad! My husband said they were "alright". I cooked mine for 15 minutes in a gas stove. Next time I think I'll cook them for 20. They needed more time to set up.

My family and I just didn't like them. They weren't terrible, just not to our liking. They might be good for an early brunch because they tasted really eggy to me. Sorry this is the first low review I've written, I just don't want someone to depend on them for something to go with dinner the way I did.

Be warned this recipe makes more than 12 mini zucchini bites - I had a yield of 30.  I used two kinds of mini-muffin pans - one was the type of non-stick mini pan which the bottoms lift out and the other a regular mini-muffin pan.  I sprayed both with cooking oil.  In the regular mini-pan, three of the muffins stuck and would not release without assistance. Instead of one large zucchini, I used two medium  zucchini and one small yellow squash.  I used a blend of shredded cheese.  Makes an excellent appetizer or snack.  Will add garlic and cayenne next time I make to give it a little zip. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome base recipe. I made some changes second time around. My large zucchini was about 10 lbs, so I was guessing and used 2 cups grated. Worked fine. Replaced the heavy cream with buttermilk. Replaced the Parmesan with Cheddar. Added 2 tsp Greek Seasoning. I'd say prep time was a little more than 15 minutes with all the peeling, chopping and grating. Personally, I wouldn't serve them with chili or soup. These would be a great brunch item served with sausage & fruit. They are much more egg-like than muffin-like. I used my 1 Tbsp cookie scoop and got 33 muffins.

These are really tasty and easily made vegetarian (use baco bits or no bacon). I didn't expect these to be quite as quiche like as they are- I also considered adding more flour but am glad I didn't! I think the picture is what threw me off, but really these are like mini zucchini quiches!

These were a big hit! Added about 3 more strips of chopped bacon, grated a half of a squash with the veggies, 2 carrots instead of 1, 2 cloves of garlic chopped, added 1/3 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp. chilli powder, and 1/2 tsp. of oregano. My mom and little brother ate these up and the aroma was fantastic!

I made this recipe as written, adding a dash or 2 of hot sauce, two time.  We liked them.  But then it came time to shake them up a bit.  The third time I made them I didn't use the olive oil but cooked the bacon first and then sauted the onion and the clove of garlic that I added in the drippings.  I also used fat free 1/2 &1/2 instead of the cream.  I threw in 2 T. of canned jalapeno peppers chopped and my splash of hot sauce.  I also only used 1/2 cup parm and subbed in a 1/2 cup monterey jack cheese. Wow!  We gobbled them up and you don't miss the fat from the missing olive oil and heavy cream.  Oh Yeah on 1/2 the batch I topped them with more jack cheese.  Oh so good!

Easy and quite tasty.  I had about a cup and a half of zucchini and used 2 eggs.  My toddler said "yummy!"  They aren't as good cold as they are warm, though!

An awesome DIFFERENT  savory snack or breakfast on the run. I made 11 regular sized muffins. I added a garlic clove to the veggie mixture and a couple pinches of chipotle chili powder. This recipe is easily adaptable to whatever you like or have on hand. I used a mixture of fresh grated parm, jalapeño jack and mozza. Spray the tin well.

this recipe needs a bit more time in the oven, and it makes way more almost double what it says...I ended up with 24 minis.  But very delicious...and the amount of eggs made enough protein  to go along with our potato leek soup we had with it.  Can add what ever else in terms of seasoning..although I just added some garlic powder and paprika ...kept them simple.

These are very tasty and were very easy to make. I doubled the recipe (everything except the onion because my kids don't love onion) and it made about 42 mini muffins. I substituted 2% evaporated milk for the heavy cream and I used a mix of cheddar and parmesan for the cheese. I also sauteed some minced garlic with the veggies and added some dried Italian seasoning. Very tasty!

These are fantastic little nutrient-packed snacks that are great for on the go. Most of their density is attributed to the vegetables (I subbed fresh basil and corn for the bacon), but they also pack a punch of protein and iron from the eggs as well as a modest amount of carbs from the flour (I subbed chickpea flour and baking powder for the self-rising flour). I also subbed spicy chili monterey jack for the parmesan. I ended up adding about an entire cup of flour to make them less quiche-like, although I'm sure they'd be great as is. Maybe not a great side for pasta, but definitely the ideal snack or breakfast/brunch item.
These are a new staple for me, and they're so versatile you could substitute any vegetable or use any combination of ingredients! How about ground beef instead of bacon? Or mushrooms instead of the carrot? Mini broccoli florets instead of the zucchini? This is my new favourite recipe!!

My husband and I enjoyed these.  I always find it difficult, though, to know exactly how much zucchini to use in a recipe like this.  What is one large zucchini?  I used 2 small ones, but probably should have used one more. I cooked them for 20 minutes but had trouble getting them out of the pan.  I think another 5 minutes would have been better.  I'll definitely make these again.

They are like little mini quiches! Hands down my favorite zucchini recipe! Made just as instructed, no changes, but had to add more flour to make a batter in the last step. This made 24 mini muffins plus a bit. You have to try this! Thanks for a great recipe!

I really hate these recipes that say use one large, or medium or small squash - how about how many cups do you need?  Large, medium & small are very subjective criteria.

The family really likes these.  They are, in everyone's opinion, a breakfast muffin - like mini quiches.  They aren't the prettiest, but very tasty for a quick breakfast.  I make them in regular sized muffin cups and definitely bake for 35-40 minutes.  Then a 30 second microwave for a fast, tasty eggy breakfast.

I left out the bacon, used tofu instead. A lot of it got stuck on the cupcake liners - taste was nice, but will keep looking for a less messy version.

This recipe is a keeper! They are good as is, yet easy to personalize with more flavors to make it your own. We will be getting creative with it, kind of like with an omelet, building upon the base to fit our tastes or to make it compliment other dishes. Thanks for the recipe!!

These were absolutely delicious. Leave them in the oven just a tad longer than you think you should.  I used 4 pieces thick cut pepper bacon, 2 carrots because my zucchini looked sparse, and a dash of garlic powder. The bites were a bit greasy,  perhaps because of the extra bacon.  Next time I would cook and chop the bacon separately and then discard at least half the grease for the onions etc. Also I didn't have self rising flour so I just used regular flour, baking powder, and salt. Google the proportions.  This made it 28 small muffins. I used a regular muffin tin and filled it up half way.  Also next time I might healthy it up by cutting the fat for frying and cutting the cheese in half. Then it would need more veggies. Maybe liquid smoke for the bacon grease/smokey taste. Good recipe.  Thanks.

Taste was good, I didn't deviate from recipe because I am really just learning to cook for the first time (not feeling very experimental yet).  I was expecting it to be a bit more "bread-like" when it came out much more like a quiche.  I had a lot of excess water in mine, so I had to cool them in the fridge before serving.  I am pretty sure that was probably my novice mistake, but can't find any steps I missed along the way.  

I would make it again, probably drain the veggie mix before adding in the egg/flour batter.

Really tasty recipe! My mother-in-law brought over two huge zucchinis, and I had no idea what to do with them. I came across this recipe, and I'm glad I did! I followed the method and added paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder to the flour.  I also sautéed some garlic with my veggies. Oh, and I cooked my veggies in the bacon drippings! Next time I would wring out my zucchini after I shred it, as there was too much liquid.

They are tasty. Bases on other reviewers I did not use oil, just sautéed onion & bacon without it. It is "eggy" in texture/taste, so after the first batch I added more flour.  I don't mind eggy, but I know my family prefers more bread like consistency.

Made these as per recipe just didn't use the oil. There b is enough fat in bacon that if you fry the bacon and then add the onions it works just as well. they are delicious!

I made this exactly like the recipe, but used minced onion flakes (gasp!) because I was out of the real deal.  Still turned out great! Tasted like a mini crustless quiche.

I thought these were delicious, and my entire family ate them, which to me is the definition of a successful meal. As other reviewers have said, there is endless room for variation, but I like the shredded carrot and zucchini; it's a good way to "hide the veggies" from picky kids (or husbands - my husband, who is notoriously finicky about vegetables, loved these because they just tasted like bacon and eggs). I will definitely make these again, and next time I plan to double the recipe so I can throw some in the freezer to pull out and reheat for breakfast on school mornings.

Great recipe and it was easy to make substitutions to limit dairy. I used 2 tbsp of butter and rice milk instead of heavy cream and left off the cheese. I don't know if my flour was self-rising, but I used it anyway and they were fine. I added a little ground flax just to sneak in some more good stuff.

So yum! Like little mini quiche. I even make a "healthier" version for my kids without bacon and substitute in whole wheat flour... they still are delicious!

Needs more flavor.  Garlic salt and chili powder helped with 2nd batch.  About 1/2 tsp. and 1/4 tsp respectively or to taste.   Flour as well as grease muffin pans for easier removal. 
Made 30 mini muffins. Took more time to prepare than listed.

I meant to review this recipe a long time ago. I think it turned out great, pretty delish! My co-worker even commented on them, as I shared them with her, she suggested I make them for a potluck which I am going to.

These were my breakfast most of last week.  We played with the veggies in them trying to add a few more, like cucumber, to make our zucchini go farther and added some extra bacon and egg.  They were great to have around so I could grab a few and go for my early mornings.  I also didn't have self rising flour, but I'm accustomed to substituting that in the same way Canadian Mama suggested.

Awesome. A lot less work than I imagined and well worth the effort.  I did sprinkle some grated cheddar over them after they came out of the oven  but that was also after we tasted a few first.  We just love melted cheese. I got 37 mini bites, way more than 12. lol  Thank you for this wonderful healthy snack.. oh and I used whole wheat flour. :))

These are more like bite sized quiches rather than muffins. I saw a reviewer post that they would be good with soup or chili so I decided to make these to go with the chili I was making tonight. Im not so sure if I agree that they are a good mix with chili, I will stick to cornbread :) Otherwise these are not bad, just better as snacks or appetizers. And they should be called Zucchini Quiche Bites !
