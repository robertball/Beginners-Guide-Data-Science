I baked this cake for my family's New Year's day brunch.  Being Greek, I can tell you that this was much closer to the traditional recipe than you would find in a bakery. It's denser and has a lighter flavour. Everyone loved it and commented on how it was much better than store bought version. My 3 year old nephew ate an entire piece by himself!  A definite keeper.

I thought this cake taste great.  I put several$1 coins wrapped in foil. Everyone thought it was fun.  This cake tastes like pound cake.  If anyone finds it to sedate, it would go very well with chocolate sauce and whipped cream or strawberries and vanilla ice cream.

This is indeed a traditional Greek recipe.
Almonds and the sesame seeds are not essential but definitely add to the flavour. The sesame seeds in particularly are used a lot by Greek Bakers.

I am Greek and this has been a tradition in my family for a long time. I was pleased to find this recipe as I lost my grandmother's version of the dish and this one made a great replacement.

this was good, but not fantastic, it was a bit on the dry side, but hiding the coins in it was a hit.

This was a hit at my New Years' Eve Dinner. The only thing I did differently was I added an ogange glaze over the top. This gave a little sparke to the top and added a little hit of flavor. I will be making this one again!

I thought this was a very nice tradition.  The cake wasn't the tastiest I've made, but it was enjoyable none the less.

My daughter and friends chose Greece for a "Multicutural Winter Holiday" presentation at school. They focused on St. Basil's Day and baked this cake to be part of their display.  We baked it in a 10" round springform pan.  It turned out great and looked so pretty with the almonds and sesame seeds on top.  They got many compliments on the cake.  Some folks compared it to a shortbread type cake.

Made it yesterday. I did not have luck with it. The dough was very sticky, and the cake was not as big as I thought it would be. I put it in the oven, nonetheless, hoping it would miraculously rise and expand. It did not. 
It did turn out tasty, but somewhat dry. I ended up cutting it into pieces and taking it into work. I let people know what I thought of it, and they seemed to like it.
There are other recipes online which use orange juice, one of which I tried last year and it was a great success. This year, after making this vasilopita, I tried a recipe which uses a bit of lemon juice. It turned out better.

Yes the cake will be dry and not American sweet - but My husband is Greek and I have been making this from a translated cookbook since we were married 20 years ago. I dust mine with powdered sugar and use lemon rind not sesame seeds - whatever. I have taken it lots of places over the years. Try it! I wash and soak a quarter in scalding hot water then just push it into the cake. Every year my husband claims to know exactly where it is but he doesn't. Enjoy.

I didn't include any sesame seeds, but just slivered almonds, and yet was still great!  Really enjoyed it and will make it again for sure!  Thank you for sharing!

Before making, I noticed a few reviews about it being either dry or bland. Instead of the 2 tbsp water, I decided to sub in 1 tbsp of brandy + juice from half an orange, along with some orange zest and ~1/2 tsp cinnamon. It came out wonderful, and I got so many compliments from my Greek family.

I did not have a full size cake pan so I made it in two single layer pans. I put lots of almonds and toasted sesame seeds on top. It had a nice flavor and my Greek family enjoyed it!

Made this for my Greek husband and mother in law for New Year’s. They loved this recipe! In fact, my mother in law said she liked it better than her own!

We make this cake every New Years for breakfast.  The quarter or whole almond is a great tradition for the kids.  The cake is definitely a little rustic, good flavor, but dry. I add lemon zest and a little lemon juice, but next year I might try adding some buttermilk or sour cream to combat the dryness.  For now, I'll just top it with ice cream or whipped cream.  It still tastes good.
