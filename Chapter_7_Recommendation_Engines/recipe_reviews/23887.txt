I've seen this in Italian cookbooks and it's "Bagna Cauda."

When my family makes it, after we saute the garlic and add the anchovies (but before the heavy whipping cream reduced by half!) we cook some steak in it, cut into dippable strips.  After we remove the steak, we add some more garlic (because a lot sticks to the steak) and a little more anchovies and then add the cream.

Note: You should stir the cream really quickly for it to blend the best.

We love this stuff so much we have annual Bagna Cauda parties.

I have learned that in the Italian countryside, it matters not what it is called, but that it is an awesome dish. My family has served this for years. We call it bunya cauda. I think it really just depends on the family for its pronunciation. We have substituted this for the traditional Christmas dinner. We tend to serve it with regular cabbage, bell peppers, cauliflower, broccoli and just basically our favorite veggies & italian bread. In my experience in making it, people either love it or hate it. Its all about the garlic! LOL

AWESOME! I added some shrimp, scallops, and spinach. Served it with pasta. Sort of like a seafood scampi. My husband was in heaven.

My husband and I love this stuff.  He told me about it when we first started dating, and when I found this recipie on the site, I suprised him with it.  IT is now addicting.  It does take a little while for it thicken, but it is definetly worth the wait.  I use a entire jar of minced garlic, and heavy cream instead of half and half.

Great party food! We too, call it Bania Caulda meaning "hot sauce" or something like that in Italian. Anyway, it serves more than 2. I saute' the garlic in butter and olive oil in an electric frying pan on low, then add the anchovies and let it all simmer then add a Tablespoon of vinegar (an Italian lady told me to do it) and mix well. We never put cream in it, but if I did I would not put in very much. Then we have a tray of assorted veggies and sliced French or Italian crusty bread, and folks stand around the same electric pan, using the bread as a "plate" and dip the veggies in the hot sauce and use the bread to catch the drips and munch away. Great conversation starter and so good with some good red wine!

I'm amazed to see this recipe here. It is an old recipe passed down in our family and we call it Bunyaculda, but it is the exact same recipe.  It is delicious, especially with green peppers and italian bread. But, just as Nita warned...it's very garlicy and you'll stink for weeks after. P.S. I've seen it spelled a million different ways... another version is Bagna Ca√∂da.

This was passed on to me by my husbands family also. However they did not add the cream, just butter, garlic and anchovies. I have also seen this spelled many different ways. No matter what the spelling its a great appetizer.

This was OK... but reminded me too much of Alfredo sauce and I was under the impression it was a much richer thicker sauce.  The taste in itself was very good, but wasn't anything that would top the ordinary.  I used 4 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk.  I also put in 2 cans of anchovies which gave it much more flavor.  Did not change the amount of garlic or butter.  I added a large pinch of flour (about 1 1/2 TBSP) thinking it would thiken up the sauce, but that did not help either.  The mixture cooked for about 45 minutes med/low (simmering lightly) at which point I gave up on trying to get it to thicken.   I give this a "B" and figure maybe I'll try it again since it's not very hard to make and now knowing that the sauce will never thicken to my desired consistency I will not need to cook it for longer than 20 minutes.

I used half the butter and used olive oil for the rest of the fat.  I only used a quarter of the half and half called for.  I can't quite imagine using 6 cups of cream, but I can't really say because I did not try.  I wanted to use it on pasta, so I thickened it up with a little flour.  I think I might have added a tad too much, but it was very good anyway.  I am pretty sure I will use this again, but I will continue to tinker with it.  I think I will cook the garlic a little less next time.  This recipe really sparked my interest; thanks for sharing Nita.

This is actually called bagna calda.  It means 'hot bath'.  This was a quick and easy recipe and I liked the idea of serving it w/ chinese cabbage.  I'd never tried that before.  We usually just have raw veggies and crusty bread or foccacia with it.

I wouldn't brown the garlic but cook it in the butter at lowest heat. Use this sauce for Pasta and Broccoli dish instead of the usual olive oil and garlic.

I don't understand what went wrong. This never thickend up. The directions are really vague, it says to cook it until it is thick, but it doesn't say how long that would take. Also, In spite of all the garlic I put in this it didn't taste garlicky at all. The butter separated and floated to the top of the sauce. The anchovies only gave this a slightly fishy taste but did not make it salty. This really tasted like warm milk. I've had bagna cauda before and it was fantastic, but this recipe is horrible.

I'm giving this a four merely becuase my boyfriend really liked it, which is amazing since he is the King of Picky. I didn't much care for it, but I will probably make it again for him.

I come from an Italian family and have been eating Bagna Caulda for 50 years.  We use heavy cream instead of half-and-half.  Pickled elephant ear or oyster mushrooms and celery are good for dipping also.

I have a recipe from an Italian friend and he calls this Bana (sp) Calda and uses shrimp, steak, chicken, mushrooms and zucchini.  The "Calda" is pretty similar.

It was extremely delicious, and also easy to make.  However, the soupy texture really got to me, so I'm not sure if I'll make it again.  To be fair, my fiance loved it so much that he wanted it for two meals in a row!  Also, this makes much more than 2 servings!  I would say at least 6.  So be forewarned.

This tastes good, but the portion size is definitely NOT for 2 people! It's more like 6-8. I'm not sure how 2 people could down all of this, particulary with bread and veggies. A VERY heavy dish, but easy to make.  I used canned garlic and ended up dumping in a whole container (very garlicky but good), just under 1 cup. I also reduced the half and half to 5 cups. I've read previously you can use 2% or skim and blend in about 1 cup of half and half to make this dish healthier. If you do reduce to 5 cups, I would recommend using 3/4 cup butter with it.   Don't worry about the anchovies, I was concerned they wouldn't "melt" and tried breaking them up... They cook and basically crumble into the sauce, so you can literally just dump them in.   A nice and different recipe, just a HUGE portion!!

We have been making it for years just like your recipe.  Please keep in mind when you cook this, it is a dipping sauce and nothing more. Please try not to thicken it defeats the point.

I love anchovies so this was not my first rodeo, but this recipe was awful!!! I gave it two stars because oddly enough the picky 2 year old liked it and it was easy to make. As for everyone else we gave it a thumbs down.

This recipe is also within my family. Every sunday during the winter we have it for dinner.  I realize it is no for everyone but they should at least try it. What I like the best with it is assiago cheese bread, my children like to dip any veggie they can get there hands on in it.
