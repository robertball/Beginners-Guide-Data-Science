We've made this twice recently.  I have to admit, our flavor palette is not Southern but we do love southern dishes with a Canadian flair. Personally, I do not care for cornmeal so when a traditional recipe like this called for breadcrumbs and parmesan, I had to try it.  I also object to deep frying for health reasons.  So I pan fried these in a non-stick pan with a bit of Pam and they turned out fabulous.  That was why we had them twice!  And the second time, I inadvertently used a tablespoon of garlic powder vs a teaspoon.  DH says I can double that again, next time.

floured and refrigerated tomatoes for an hour, then started this recipe, it made a big difference, all ways do that first. 
This recipe worked well, I will use it again. I guess us Yankees need to stick together.

So simple.  I love it!  To make this low glycemic , my substitutions were coconut flour for the wheat flour & Ianâ€™s Italian style gluten free Panko.  I also used organic virgin coconut oil in place of olive oil.  Delish!

Made the tomatoes last night. Used coconut flour because I am eating very little wheat. Will make these again when tomatoes are in season again.

I am not a big corn meal fan, so this was perfect for me. Living in PA, I'm not all that familiar with green tomatoes. But it was in our portion this week from the CSA and I had to give it a try. Very good!

Best green tomato recipe I've made. Even my mil who is not fond of fried tomatoes enjoyed this northern style recipe.
