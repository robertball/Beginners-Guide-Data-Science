This works well for a nice brunch. I made this for a brunch that I had for a friend's 80th birthday and she had two.

I didn't have the Bacardi mixers, so I pureed a can of peaches, sugar, and ice into a blender.  I added this into champagne glasses and slowly added champagne.  Great drink for brunch or girls night out.  A good non-alcoholic version would be to substitute ginger ale for the champagne.
