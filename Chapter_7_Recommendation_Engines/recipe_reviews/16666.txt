I was looking for a lower fat/calorie banana bran muffin so I modified this in combination with another low fat bran muffin recipe.  I substituted the butter for 1/4c unsweetened applesauce, only used 1 egg, halved the sugar to 1/4c, increased the wheat bran to 1c and used 1/2c each of wheat flour and all purpose flour.  The sweetness was just perfect for me (the banana gives a lot of sweet flavor) and so moist!  Each muffin turns out to be about 100 calories, so we're free to munch on them guiltless!  The first batch I made used only 2 bananas and 1/2c applesauce, this was a little dryer than using 3 bananas and 1/4c applesauce, but still good!

These were excellent... very moist, great flavor, enjoyed by all.  The only change I made was to use whole wheat flour.  Thank you for the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper, my favorite muffin recipe yet.

These are great muffins and with a little doctoring they can become extremely nutritious as well. I substitute 1 1/2 cups of flax seed meal for the butter, and I add walnuts and cinnamon for extra texture and flavor. If I have soy milk around I use that instead of the cows milk. You wind up with very dense, tasty muffins that are extremely good for you.

* These are GREAT!!!! *
As others suggested, I used applesauce instead of butter and 3/4C whole wheat flour. Also 1/4C wheat germ & 1/4C flax seed in place of the bran and added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. I only wish I'd had walnuts on hand! But they still came out wonderful regardless! Even a non-healthy junky friend liked them tremendously...she could not believe they were good for you food!  ;)

I was gifted a ginomous amount of raisin bran that I was kind of scratching my head about how we were going to use it as we're not huge cereal eaters. (I know it's not wheat bran but with us being on such a tight budget, I have to use what I got.) Thanks for the ingredient search I was able to use a small amount in this recipe. I cut the butter back by half and added in a quarter cup of homemade organic applesauce. I used buttermilk, whole wheat white flour and omitted the nuts only because we didn't have any. I did add in a heaping half cup of organic raisins to bump the fiber and fruit. I got a little more than 12 servings--12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini-muffins. These turned out moist, flavorful and just all around good! I might be able to cut back the sugar next time, too. My bananas were really ripe so my muffins turned out a little too sweet. This will make a nice snack/treat for the next day or two. They're quite good so I can't imagine they'd last long.

Was looking for a relatively healthy banana muffin recipe and this pretty much fits the bill! I substituted applesauce for the butter in this with good results.

Grrreat muffins! I made a few substitutions to make it healthier. I used 50/50 whole wheat/all purpose flour, omitted butter & used 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (do not pack sugar) & used 1/8 cup sour cream + 1/8 cup rice milk instead of milk. Oh, I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon & 1/4 cup raisins! The only thing my husband & I both didn't like was that half of the muffins stuck to the muffin papers. I guess this is due to the absence of butter. Next time, I'll skip the muffin papers & pour the batter straight into my muffin pans sprayed w/ a non-stick spray. Also, these muffins do not rise very much, so feel free to fill your pans at least almost to the top.

These are great muffins, I made a double batch and put them in the freezer for quick breakfasts. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the butter, and used whole wheat for a third of the flour. To increase the nutritional value, next time I might use half all-purpose and half whole wheat. They are very moist and delicious, perfect touch of sweetness...we all enjoyed them and they are a much healthier option for a 'grab-and-go'!

I thought these were very good.  I substituted ground flaxseed meal for the wheat bran and toasted the walnuts.  They were definitely done in 20 minutes.

Delicious! I made the recipe exactly how stated and they turned out great. They didn't stick to the pan at all either. The second time I made them I substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour and added some fresh blueberries, also delicious! My 2 year old son LOVES them, which makes me happy since he can be a picky eater.

Great muffins which happen to be healthy!  I substituted Stevia for the white sugar, applesauce for the oil, egg whites for the eggs and on the white flour split it between whole wheat and white. Once baked, I brushed on warm honey.  Big hit with my husband!

I used another reviewer's modified, healthier version of this recipe and it was great! I did almost exactly what she said except I used 2 eggs instead of one (used egg beaters 1/4 cup = 1 lg egg) and I used ALL whole wheat flour. I also had to buy All-Bran cereal as I could not find Wheat Bran, I smashed the Wheat Bran flakes up and it worked perfectly. I also added Walnuts as the original recipe said. The muffins turned out great, they are moist and lightly sweet but have that light salt taste of a good bran muffin with a little crunch from the walnuts. Definitely not dry. Probably would not be dry if you only used 1 egg. I used 3 bananas and a 1/4 cup brown sugar. The muffins are definitely most and delicious. Great healthy quick recipe!

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, whole wheat flour, and oat bran (because I had oat bran on hand). The recipe made 16 muffins. I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking. Very yummy!!!

Substituted wheat flour for wheat bran, doubled recipe and used 5 bananas instead of 6 (I ran out). As I made it these were very dry and not sweet enough. I had planned to serve them at a mom's group but they were barely edible. They are decent with butter melted and honey spread over them.

These were very good even with my healthier revisions:  unsweetened applesauce instead of butter; just under a 1/2 cup of honey instead of brown sugar; whole wheat instead of white flour.

I made changes based on what I like and had at home. Also, let the bran soak for a bit with the buttermilk before adding it to the mix. They are very yummy and moist.   ¼ cup canola oil -- ¼ cup apple sauce -- 1/2 cup brown sugar  -- 4 bananas, mashed  -- 1/2 cup buttermilk -- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract -- 2 eggs -- 2 tablespoons flax seed -- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour -- 1/2 cup wheat bran -- 1 teaspoon baking powder -- 1 teaspoon baking soda -- 1/4 teaspoon salt -- ¼ cup raisins -- 1 apple, diced

I started making these for breakfast a couple of months ago and I'm hooked! I double the amount of wheat bran and use low fat margarine instead. With those two substitutions it seems like a pretty healthy start to the day, great recipe!

Super simple and quick to throw together. I used 3 very large bananas and substituted apple juice for the milk as my son is allergic. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked these muffins.  I halved the sugar and used applesauce in place of butter.  I would probably use the full amount of sugar next time.  I also used only 1 egg and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose.  Next time, I will use half and half.  I didn't have any wheat bran, so I used 1 cup of crushed PC Fibre First cereal and it turned out great.  This is the first time I've tried to 'healthify' a recipe...and I think it turned out great.

These are great!  I love banana muffins, and having some bran in them makes it "feel" healthier.  I add chocolate chips... because what's a banana muffin without chocolate chips? =)

The bran makes this a tasty alternative to the usual banana muffins.  I added chocolate chips to mine.

Good recipe. Like other reviewers, I wanted a lower fat version so I substituted 1/2 cup canned pumpkin for butter.  After making rest of recipe as written, batter seemed a bit dry so I added a tablespoon or 2 of milk.  Results were good although muffins could use a bit more salt.  Maybe that's because of the pumpkin?  Anyway, thanks for the recipe, I will make again.

Okay so I did my best to make these sort of healthier. I didn't look at any reviews before baking these so sorry if I'm repeating anything anyone has said. I think I got these down to about 80 calories per muffin, 24 muffins per batch.  These are my revisions:
Instead of 1/2c of butter: I used about 1/4c of butter and filled the rest of the measuring cup with plain greek yogurt.  Instead of 1/2c of brown sugar: I used 1/4c of brown sugar and 1-1/2 tbls of organic honey.
Instead of reg milk I used almond milk.
Instead of 1-1/2c of white flour: I used 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c of white flour.
I only used 1/3c of wheat bran. I don’t like it that much but know its good for me so I had to use some.
I used 4 medium bananas.
Oh yeah I whisked the eggs really well before adding, then I folded them in.

They turned out moist, yummy, kinda fluffy, and overall good. I would make them again. My 3 year old daughter likes them.

Good recipe!  Like many others I used applesauce instead of butter.  I cut the flour down to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1/2 cup oat bran.  Worked out really well!  Nice and moist!

I wanted to find some healthy muffin recipes, and this one is delicious.  To make it a little healthier, I followed the substitutions suggested by others (using apple sauce and whole wheat flour).  I filled each cup in my muffin tray to the top and was able to get a dozen muffins.  I also pammed the bottom and sides of each cup in the muffin tray so the muffins came out pretty easily.  The muffins are moist and have a great texture.  I really like this recipe.

Yummy! Used whole wheat flour, added some Splenda & 1 tsp cinn. I also used applesauce for the butter but I might try using 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce next time as the muffins seemed a little too moist. A great recipe; tasted wonderful!

I took the advice of others and used unsweetened applesauce in lieu of the butter - outstanding results!  This recipe has walnuts listed in the directions, but not on the ingredient list - I used 3/4 cup, chopped.  I also just used PAM spray and omitted the use of the paper liners.  I highly recommend this recipe, it has a lot of flavor and a light fluffy texture.

DO NOT OVERBAKE! I pulled mine out a couple of minutes early, they looked set, and the toothpick came out clean when I toothpicked them. So moist and delicious! I cut the brown sugar back to 1/4c, and added 1/2c of the Russian Tea (search for it on this website!) mix, and the results were WONDERFUL! I had shrimpy bananas, so I used 4. Turned out amazing. Be sure to follow Alton Brown's advice: Add the dry ingredients all at once, then fold until JUST incorporated, then STOP! That's how to treat muffins. These worked great for regular size muffins, and also mini muffins, you just have to watch them and take them out when they're done. DELICIOUSABLE!

I'd actually give this recipe 3.5 out of 5 stars.  It turned out well, was easy and healthy "ish", but the muffins were sort of bland in that they weren't sweet enough.  I'd make them again, but would work some splenda in there to sweeten things up a little.

I am not a huge fan of banana bread but I needed to do something with my over ripe bananas so I went to my favorite sourse - allrecipes.com. I had to make a few changes but only out of necessity and it still turned out great. First I used oats instead of wheat bran because that's all I had, I only had one egg, I threw in a 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for fiber and added a 4th banana simply because I had it and wasn't going to throw it away.I was in a hurry so instead of muffins I threw the batter in a loaf pan and made bread. OH MY GOSH! The very best banana bread ever! So moist and the flavor and texture (because of the oats and extra banana) were out of this world!! It had to bake a little longer than if I had made muffins, but was well worth the wait. I will buy banana's this weekend just to make this bread again.

This was the tastiest low-fat muffin I have ever baked! I substituted the butter with applesauce and sugar with Splenda after reading other reviewer's suggestions. I could not find wheat bran at my grocery store so I used oat bran instead. The muffins turned out great--fluffy and moist without being too oily.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 cup homemade (Sarah's Applesauce) applesauce instead of butter.  These turned out beautifully and fluffed up more than any muffin I've made.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and 1 tsp cinnamon (my applesauce had cinnamon in it as well).  Will definitely make these again!

Really delicious and easy to make. But I wouldn't be an allrecipes user if I didn't say  . . . I added something! I increased the bran by 1/2 cup, added 3 tsp of wheat germ, added raisins, and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour. The banana flavor really came through and the raisins added some sweetness and moisture. I would totally make these again!

Fantastic base recipe. Tried the regular recipe first and they were great. Next time I made them a bit healthier and still were fantastic. I used 1/2 sweetened cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 plain greek yogurt in place of butter. Cut sugar to 1/4 cup (as I used sweetened apple sauce). Used all whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup flax seed. Thanks for the recipe!

Just ate one of these fresh out of the oven, so good!  I was looking for a bran muffin and had some over-ripe bananas, so this was a perfect recipe.  I used other reviewers suggestions, cutting out some of the butter for applesauce, adding cinnamon, and ground flax seed in addition to the wheat bran.  I added some choc. chips so that maybe the fiance would eat them as well.

I love these muffins! Taking the advice from previous reviewers, I substituted the butter for 1/4 cup of applesauce (I used chunky, since that's all I had, but I figured chunks of apples couldn't be a bad thing!). I also increased the bran to one cup, used an extra banana because I had it, and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious and nutritious!

Great healthy recipe. Like others I subbed the butter for applesauce, used 1c ww flour and 1/2c AP. 3/4c wheat bran and 2 TBSP wheat germ.  Didn't add nuts to the batter but sprinkled on top before baking.  Great way to improve presentation!

Moist and tasty! I made many of the changes suggested by previous reviewers, subbing the butter for apple sauce, adding 1 c. of wheat bran, using 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, adding pumpkin pie spice (plus 1 tsp. extra cinnamon 'cause I like things spicy), used 4 bananas because that's what I had, and I used soy milk instead of cow's milk. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the muffins; I'll definitely make them again! ;)

I've made this twice and both times was AMAZING!! I did top them with a lot of honey and cinnamon before baking and the second time I subsituted half a cup of flour with half a cup of oatmeal. To do this, just throw the oatmeal in your blender and within a minute or so it turns to powder...it's great!

I made these muffins last night with some alterations suggested by other reviewers. I used 1/4 c. applesauce in place of the butter, increased the bran to 1 cup, and used 1/2 c. each of whole wheat and all-purpose flour.  They were so easy to  make, and so healthy and delicious! My husband couldn't get enough of them either, and would have eaten the whole dozen if I had let him:) I will definitely be making these again!

Definite keeper. For healthy muffins, this recipe is a winner. Adjusted recipe to omit all fat and added extra flavors to our taste: subbed half all purpose flour w/whole wheat flour. subbed vanilla yogurt in place of yogurt.  added one individual container of applesauce and 1/4 cup coconut. Came out pretty good and fat free!

this is a very nice muffin.  the fact that it includes bran makes it especially nice for breakfast.  i liked the flavor, very smooth and nutty.(i did add about 3/4 cup walnuts).  i think that some added spices might have given this muffin the perfect 5.  next time i might try adding some cinnamon and maybe even coconut.

Thanks for a great recipe! I used toasted wheat germ instead of bran, added a tbsp of soy protein powder, and threw in a bag of chocolate chips. Spectacular!

Super! What a delicious change from the usual banana bread/muffin recipes. I stuck with the butter, though I will try applesauce next time. I added 1/2 c oat bran along with the wheat bran, and about 3/4 c chopped walnuts (they weren’t in the ingredient list, but mentioned in the instructions.) Thanks, Janet, for the great recipe!

this was a great recipe to start, but we altered it to suit our new found healthy lifestyle (that is until we fall off the bandwagon!)

to make it more healthful, i used 1 cup whole wheat flower, 1 cup of bran, and 1/2 cup of oatbran.  1/4 cup margarine, 1/4 cup applesauce.  to add to the richness, i added some molasses.  i also added pecans and cranberries.  turned into a beautiful, fluffy and not too sweet muffin

The recipe calls for walnuts but did not specify an amount.  I substituted 1/4 cup flax seed and it work out well.  Also, depending on the size of the bananas used, the mixture may come out too thin.  I used large bananas and that was the case.  I just added more bran to get the proper consistency.  Perfect muffins for the church function, left overs went to work where they disappeard in an hour, with people asking for the recipe.

These were really good mufins. The only problem I had was the paper cups came out drenched and greasy. I'm assuming it was the butter. I'll make a few adjustments next time.

When I don't have bananas, I substitute other fruits, like apples or canned pumpkin and add the spices that go with that fruit.  This recipe is a keeper.  A good way to use up fruit at the end of the week.  I've even mixed apples with pears, pumpkin with craisins and I always add chopped walnuts. The possibilities are endless.Thanks Janet!

I loved this recipe! But the next time I made it, I left out most of the butter and two of the bananas. I used 1/4 cup of Smart Balance margarine and used substitute eggs.  I also add dried cranberries, chopped dates and raisins, sometimes pecans. I use 1/4 cup brown sugar. I often substitute yogurt for the milk. 

•	¼  cup smart balance margarine, softened 
•	1/3 cup brown sugar 
•	1 bananas, mashed 
•	1/4 cup yogurt
•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
•	½ cup egg substitute
•	1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour 
•	1 1/2 cup all bran cereal 
•	1 teaspoon baking powder 
•	1 teaspoon baking soda 
•	1/4 teaspoon salt 
•	options:  Add 2 tablespoons each of any of the following:  dried cranberries, raisins, and chopped dates; ¼ cup chopped nuts (pecans, walnuts, pistachios, almonds)

Okay the rest of the recipe is the same.

Very tasty, dense and healthy. To cut on fat I use 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, and to up the fiber I use 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. These bake up really well as jumbo muffins, but are nice as regular muffins too.

I made these in a pinch to fulfill a request at our church's coffee cafe. I love this recipe! I followed everything to a T with the exception of adding 3 Tbs. ground flax seed, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. raisins, organic whole wheat flour(in place of the all purpose regular) and 1 finely shredded carrot. Adding ground flax seed gives it more "oil", but I chose not to reduce my butter and the results were great! Very moist and hearty! I used the All-Bran cereal and tossed it into the liquid to soften , then added the dry ingreadients. Don't over stir, just mix enough to blend the ingredients, otherwise you might get a hollowed out center and a crown that won't rise. Use overripe bananas for the best flavor and result. I would have added a few Tbs. of honey, but I was out, still, the sweetness was spot on! I used jumbo muffin liners for my jumbo muffin tins and the recipe gave me 6 jumbos. I will double it next time. You cannot go wrong with this recipe as I believe it's virtually fool proof! A keeper for sure!

These were tasty, but not the best muffins I've ever had or anything like that.  I followed the recipe exactly.  But, they were good, just not amazing.

These are fantastic!  I made my own substitutions, and they were great.  I used 1 c. flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, vanilla yogurt instead of the milk, 1 egg + 1 T milled flax seed & 3 T water.  I also added 1 c. blueberries.  My kids loved them, and we loved them too!  Healthy & delicious.

excellent. Moist and delicious. The muffin tops came out perfect with a slight crisp. I added walnuts for some extra crunch.

These muffins are AWESOME! The muffins turned out so moist and full of flavor. These muffins are really healthy but don't taste like it. The only thing I changed was I substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the 1/2 cup of butter.  I will for sure make these often.

This is a family favorite already!  I substitute apple sauce for the butter and usually add either a cup of blueberries, or a cup of raisins.  They are always moist, light and very tasty. These muffins are divine with a nice cup of coffee or they work really well as a quick meal on those mornings when breakfast is "on the run".   Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I substitued applesauce for all of the butter (much healthier, and I don't think you can tell the difference).  I also liked that it used wheat bran.  Many recipes do not.  I will make these again.

These are my very favorite muffins of all time!!  I will make these all the time now.  I used part whole wheat flour, part all purp flour.  I also added a little wheat germ for that "extra" health bonus, and I used oat bran instead of wheat bran.  EXCELLENT!!

Good recipe, i am not a big fan of the "bran taste" and the bananas in this recipe defiantly hide the taste. Instead of using 1/2c butter i only used 1/4c of butter and 1/4c of unsweetened applesauce, so they still came out moist. I also only used 1/4c of splenda brown sugar, and substituted 1/4c of pecans instead of walnuts! Thanks for the great recipe!

Like other users, I replace the butter with unsweetened applesauce. I cut back on the sugar a bit but will use the stated amount next time. They weren't quite sweet enough for muffins to me. I used 2 medium bananas and two small ones. Throw your overripened bananas in the freezer then defrost on the counter for 30-40 min. when you're ready to bake with them. I might experiment with adding some spices next time. Maybe some cinnamon? Fantastic recipe and so good for you!

Delicious!  The only modifications I made were to use skim milk instead of whole milk and used 1 cup whole wheat flour plus 1/2 cup of all purpose flour.  This will definitely be a keeper.

A few changes: I substituted the butter for applesauce, flour for wheat flour, and only used one egg. They're very moist and flavorful and I suggest using large VERY ripe bananas for extra sweetness. Very delicious!

I just made this recipe and it is awesome, the first time I have used natural wheat bran.  My kids loved this recipe practically ate the entire batch in minutes.  Next time will double or triple and try freezing for lunches.

These are delicious!  SO moist.  I'm not a big banana muffin fan, but these were amazing.  I used 4 bananas because that's what I had, and I subbed some whole wheat flour for the all purpose.  Delicious!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  These are delicious muffins and such a simple recipe.  Like other reviewers, I wanted to make the muffins healthier, so I made the following changes:1)Used Applesauce in place of butter, 2)Used egg beaters, 3)increased wheat bran by 1/2 cup, decreased AP flour by 1/2 cup, 4)Added Cinnamon and Pumpkin Pie Spices, 5)Added raisins in place of nuts, and 5) used low fat buttermilk (because I needed to use it up).  The muffins turned out great!

These are amazing!  One of the best bran muffin recipes I've tried.  Nice, cake-like texture.  In my oven, 20 minutes was perfect.
I tried to make them a little healthier by using 1 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.  Also wanted to sub in applesauce for the butter but unfortunately my applesauce had gone moldy.  Will try next time though.
Anyway, these are delicious!!!

This is a great base recipe because it is very easy to adapt while still seeing great results.  My review is of a significantly altered recipe, but it was still delicious.  I used silken lite tofu in place of the butter, quinoa for the bran (I also did 1 cup of quinoa and 1 cup AP flour) and used pecans for walnuts.  The result was quite delicious.  Don't be afraid to tweak to accomidate whatever grains or nuts you have on hand.

These are awesome. I added 1/4 c. jumbo chocolate chips and used only 1/4 c. walnuts. The chocolate added some extra sweetness.

This is the best recipe I've found in my attempts to duplicate the banana bran muffins I love from a local bakery.  I used whole wheat flour, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks!

yummy and healthy!  i only have a mini muffin pan, and i think that's the reason they come out slightly chewier than i would like.  think they would be best as regular sized muffins.  good overall though!

Thanks, all of you, for sharing your creative ideas for this muffin! Mine came out great, and I substituted applesauce/yogurt for the butter, and whole wheat flour and flax seed meal for the white flour. The taste didn't suffer at all. Next time, however, I am going to use some extra-virgin coconut oil for part of the fat...the combination is incredible!

Lovely recipe. Instead of butter I used a plum flavoured soya yogurt and in place of flour I used soya flour and added oats. I didn't have enought muffin cases so I poured the batter into a cake tin and baked for a little longer. 
Very moist and very tasty.

Just pulled these out of the oven.  I reduced brown sugar by half, and substituted whole wheat flour for white flour and apple sauce for butter.  Next time, I will probably NOT halve the brown sugar and will add some spices, otherwise it is a good muffin.  I doubled the recipe and got exactly 24 muffins.

These muffins were great and the kids LOVED them...even with my wacky substitutions.  

I really tried to make these a tad healthier so instead of brown sugar I mixed Splenda and sugar free pancake syrup (1 c. Splenda/1/4 cup syrup).  I used Silk soymilk instead of regualr because one of my kiddos has a milk allergy.  I used wheat germ instead of wheat bran-I don't know if these are the same thing or not?  I used 1 c. deflated soy flour instead of regular flour (I try and stay away from regular flour whenever possible). Once I started mixing everything together I realized I didn;t have any eggs so I sub'd 4 tbsp cornstarch (I would have just added more banana if I had it).

I was really surprised at how tasty these were.  They did not have a cupcakey texture like the original but I think if I cooked it for longer at a lower temp they might have gotten that way.  If these are good I am sure the original ones are awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely splendid. This recipe offers the perfect tension between sweet and substantive. Much of the sweet flavor is natural, coming from the bananas. I followed the recipe right down the line and wouldn't change a thing.  Why would I? Moist, easy to prepare, and just the right amount of sweetness.  Thank you, Janet.

I made these muffins yesterday with the original 1/2 cup of butter. These muffins are incredibly moist and have a sinfully delicious banana taste. The bananas were very ripe upon making the recipe and were cut into dice size chunks for a more pronounced flavour. The only thing I substituted was whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and I didn't add any walnuts either.I also didn't use any muffin paper cups as my muffin pan is non-stick. The muffins popped out with ease.
Will definately make these again!

I made these muffins to satisfy my craving for a something a little sweet while still being healthy.  I followed the advice of several others and reduced the amount of butter, however I used only 1/8 cup, replacing the rest with applesauce.  I also added chocolate chips and baked 6 jumbo muffins.  These were the best muffins I have ever tasted, incredibly moist.  You would have sworn you were eating something terribly sinful.  They were also excellent warmed up the following day, although I did have to fight my family so I could save one.

Recipe is very good, I followed to the dot. It is really fluffy and moist, I was hesitant to try as I always thought bran muffin is too healthy to taste good, but this recipe changed my view on that.

I’m not a big fan of bran muffins but these were very good.  My husband and daughter also liked them.  I followed some suggestions of others and substituted half of the butter with unsweetened applesauce and used half all-purpose flour and half whole-wheat flour.  (Then I felt less guilty for adding chocolate chips!)  Also added 1/2 cup walnut pieces.  Will definitely make again!

These are very good muffins, easy, quick, moist, dense, and bake just right...definitely not a dessert-like muffin as they are not too sweet. we liked them better after they cooled, they tended to sweeten a little more. I added 1/4 cup chopped dates to half the batter, and both halves turned out great.
 (We have also added raisins instead of or in addition to dates and nuts, also a teaspoon of cinnamon, and sprinkled the top with decorating sugar or cinnamon sugar-do whatever suits your taste).

I substituted the butter for applesauce, but other than that, that's the only real change I made. There were good. Not very sweet which I like, so they'll be a good breakfast muffin. I added raisins because I like raisins in my bran muffins. Next time, if I make them again, I will add cinnamon for a little more flavour.

The texture of these muffins is perfect, very moist.  They have a strong banana flavor too.  I used half flax seed and half bran but otherwise followed the recipe.  I think next time I'd cut down on the brown sugar, since they're a little sweet for me.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I also modified it a little - used Earth Balance instead of butter, wheat flour instead of all purpose, and cut down a little on the brown sugar, and threw in a few chopped dates instead.  I must have tripled the amount of walnuts, and they are SUPERB.  Moist and buttery... Yum!!  Thank you :)

I loved these muffins. I made them as the recipe was written and was thrilled. Maybe next time I will replace the butter with applesauce for a healthier muffin but even 1/2 c. is not too bad. My family is going to love these if I don't eat them all first!

These muffins are good and good for you! I use 1/2 cup oats and drop the white flour back 1/2 cup. I also decrease the butter and use apple sauce instead. For a lower sugar, I use Splenda brown sugar. They always come out really good. My favorite way to use up over ripe bananas.

I made the muffins exactly as the recipe called for and they were delicious!!  My 12 year-old daughter LOVED them.  I have never tried applesauce as a substitute for butter but will try that next time.

I love this recipe.  I substitute applesauce for the butter, whole wheat flour for the flour and use Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of brown sugar.

Very delicious.  The only change I made was to use instead of the margarine/butter.

I bake a lot, especially banana muffins for my husband.  These are the best muffins I've made.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and egg beaters for the egg.  Then I used 1/2 cup of flax seed meal, 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  I added 1/2 cup of coconut along with the chopped nuts.  Healthful, moist and delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe! Flavorful, healthy muffins that even the office folks loved and begged for more! Note: the ingredient list doesn't have walnuts added and it didn't get put on my shopping list. So, I had to substitute pecan chips (I had in the pantry), but didn't effect the flavor. Would have been better with bigger pieces, but that's my fault. Make sure you add walnut pieces to your shopping list!

These are the best muffins that I have ever made! I can't believe how moist they are. I only had two bananas so made 6 muffins. I added chopped pecans and also substituted rice milk, whole wheat flour & shortening. A must try!

I substituted apple sauce for the butter, which resulted in the muffins sticking to the paper liner, but I won't hold it against this recipe.  What I didn't like about it was the overwhelming baking soda tast and smell.

As bran muffins go this is probably the best I've had. I added applesauce instead of butter, added a little extra wheat bran, and used only egg whites. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They came out great.

Great recipe, and it is easy to make subsitutions to make them healthy: I used whole wheat flour and applesauce for half of the butter. Also added 1 1/2 Tbs. flax seed and 1 cup rum-soaked raisins in place of one of the bananas. These are great for school snacks- they keep you going and taste so good!

These were so good and flavorful!  The only change I made was substituting half the butter with applesauce.  Since a previous review said it was too moist substituting all the butter with applesauce.  I've already eaten half of them myself.  =)

These are so good!  I'm going to change my breakfast routine to include this and a cup of yogurt.  I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose, and added wheat germ.  Next time I'll add some flax seed meal.  Thanks for a great muffin!

I usually like to follow recipes, but I had extra stuff on hand, so I added craisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll let you know how the alterations turn out! UPDATE: They turned out great. We both loved them!

Delicious. I pretty much made this recipe as is (this was the first time making it), but I added my secret ingredient I add to my Banana Bread recipe. My secret ingredient? A 1/4 cup of Apple Butter!!!

Just made them this morning and already at 3! They are that yummy! I used oat bran instead of wheat bran. I just learned that oat bran is soluble fiber that is digested and helps lower cholesterol and wheat bran is an insoluble fiber which passes through undigested. I used a combination of the almond and vanilla extract. I did not use nuts because I didn't have them.  I added blueberries which made them look and taste more appealing.

After combining much advice from other reviews, I substituted lowfat vanilla yogurt for the butter, added 1/3 c flax meal and replaced half the flour w/whole wheat flour.  A few added walnuts and chocolate chips didn't hurt either!  These were gone in a day and my sister, who despises any health food substitutions, begged for the recipe.  Even my 5 year old critic chowed down on 4 mini muffins after school.

I made these according to other reviewers suggestions: 1 cup wheat bran, 1/2 cup of each white and wheat flour. These were so moist and yummy, everyone was fighting over them.  Perfect amount of sugar.  I will be making these often in our rotation of morning muffins. I like them as they are but to change them a bit once in awhile so my family doesn't get sick of them I will try adding some shredded zuccini and maybe some spices.

I substituted half of the butter for applesauce and threw in some chocolate chips.  All threw in some all-bran buds cereal.  They turned out great and will make them again.  I actually halved the receipe since I only had 2 over ripe bananas and still worked great.

These are great Janet! Thank You! They're very moist. I used a 1/2 c chopped walnuts and 1/2c golden raisins in mine (my 4 yr old's idea to add the raisins!). We all love them! Even my picky 7 year old daughter! Next time I might try 1 c bran & reduce the flour to 1 c. as I love bran muffins!

This recipe is great.  I did not feel like I was eating a "healthy" muffin. I did what other reviewers have done...I cut the butter in 1/2 and replaced it with applesauce.  I also used 1 cup of WW flour and then a 1/2 c of all purpose flour.  I plan on trying to replace some eggs with egg substitute next time.

Perfect breakfast muffins.  I add an extra banana or 1/2 banana, otherwise follow it exactly.  Sometimes I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I tried adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg, but it didn't really work.  Such a scrumptious, wholesome muffin.  Thank you, Janet!  I make these almost every wk!

Best banana muffin recipe I've ever made plus it is a great way to sneak beneficial bran into my diet.  Great with chopped pecans.

Very delicious. I took advice from other reviewers and reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons of unsalted, 1/4 cup of brown sugar,1/4 cup of molasses, 1/4 cup of applesauce, 2 tablespoons of wheat germ, 1 teaspoon nutmeg,2 teaspoons of cinnamon and increased the wheat bran to 1 cup. This may have more added ingredients than you may like, however these muffins are very moist and tasty.

Super yummy, moist and delicious even with a couple of healthy changes - I used applesauce instead of butter, also used half whole wheat flour.  Highly recommend!

So delicious! I used a little more bran, flour, and extra milk since I had five and a half bananas. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. These were super moist and not too sweet. I will definitely make these again and again.

I modified this recipe a little by adding and substituting a few ingredients, thanks to KOHKI730.  
I used KOHKI730 substitutions for a lower fat and calorie muffin, but I added a little butter extract and cinnamon.  Very, very good!

These were great! Very moist and a good consistancy!  I've been trying to sneak some extra fiber into my daughters diet (she's 3) and this was a great start.  Next time I would add an extra banana just to get a stronger banana flavor.

I've tried about a dozen muffin recipes, and this one was our favorite.  I only added some flax meal, cinnamon and raisins.  This is a nice light textured muffin. I will try reducing the butter and adding applesaude next time, just to lower the fat content.

These were really good and went fast.  I used half butter and half applesauce to lower the fat and also to prevent oily muffins.  I will make these again, only I will probably add some raisins or something to make them a bit more exciting.

Great recipe.  I added about a cup of frozen mixed berries.  A little oily for my liking, but still really good.  Going to decrease butter next time or use applesauce.

i added about a cup of crushed walnuts, and a handful of presoaked raisins in place of one of the bananas. Also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apricot sauce to reduce fat. very tasty but they have stuck to the muffin cases! not quite perfect, but enjoyable snacks.

These muffins turned out a little strange, they were so moist that they almost don't seem to be cooked through.  I subistituted the butter for applesauce to cut calories so maybe that had something to do with it.  I don't really care for these muffins but my boyfriend sure doesn't mind them!

These muffins are the best! I don't even like bananas but my family does and I still thought they tasted wonderful. They have a light airy texture and rose nice and high and looked like they were a picture in a magazine. I didn't have wheat bran so I substituted the same amount of wheat flour and it worked fine. Great Recipe!!

I let the bananas get very ripe to make sure they had a strong banana flavor.  Great banana flavor fresh from the oven.  Over night they turned into bran muffins - not a hint of banana flavor.  They were good, but I really wanted banana muffins.

They have a good texture and taste. However, they are not sweet enough. I would add another 1/4 cup sugar to make them perfect.

I doubled my batch and was 1 banana short, so I added 1/2 cup of cranberry sauce, and used oil instead of butter.  They are lovely and moist, taste Great

Moist and delicious just like they should be. The kids loved them. Of course the half cup of chocolate chips I added didn't hurt.

I made these, only substituting solid coconut oil for the butter. They turned out well, flavourful and moist. Would definitely use the recipe again.

Really enjoy these muffins. Very moist! Not too sweet and not overpowering banana flavor. I did make the following changes: replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, and only had 2 bananas instead of 3 - but they were on the large side. Mashed up it was about 1 cup.

I used v1/4 cup vanilla greek yogurt with a splash of milk. Muffins had to bake longer than indicated (I made them in a six-muffin pan).  They came out amazing. Slightly crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Saving this recipe for sure.

Only my second attempt at baking from scratch. I followed almost exactly except I used heavy cream instead of milk and added strawberry chunks. I just wish they were a touch sweeter....like honey or molasses. There's always next time.

Five stars, but I did add chocolate chips because my brother requested them specifically! Also, I realized halfway through that I was out of baking soda, so I just used another tablespoon of baking powder and omitted the salt. I was surprised they turned out!

Unbelievably moist! I followed a couple changes by the reviewers. Applesauce instead of butter and put some oat Bran. Crazy moist and tasty. Thank you.
ADDED after I made these....Help me please, why do these give us heartburn EVERY TIME we eat them?! So disappointing because they are soooo good! And I have a lot of bananas waiting to get into some muffins. :(

I made these for my toddler, therefore I cut the sugar in half but used brown sugar to maintain flavour. Recipe easily doubles. For a double-batch, I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, plus about 1 cup cranberries. Replaced butter with 1/2 non-hydrogenated margarine and 1/2 applesauce. A total MOIST and DELISH end result!!!

Love this recipe - very versatile - Just made another batch using 1 mashed banana (all I had on hand) and 2/3 cup applesauce and added a couple of cups of blueberries.  Delicious and I like that it doesn't use oil - 1/2 cup butter for 12 muffins.

This is a great base recipe. Initially made as written and very good, but I now use this as a base for wet/dry ingredients and have made it much more healthy. I sub applesauce for the oil/butter, sub ground oatmeal for the flour, and ground flax seed for the bran. I also use a bit less than 1/4 cup honey in place of the sugar. I double the recipe and freeze the muffins individually for a quick breakfast.

The muffins were nicely moist, the flavor was mild. I've made this twice. The second time though, I omitted the bananas and used 1 cup pumpkin  purée and 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice. That turned out good, too.

These were awesome!
My son has a nut allergy so I swapped the walnuts for an equal amount of chocolate chips. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I used my food processor to mix it all up, and a standard size ice cream scoop to measure it into my muffin pans. My son ate two before they had even cooled properly and his friend went home with four, but got home with only two hahahahaaa 
Lovely recipe and easy too. Plus the house smells gorgeous

I made these for my toddler. I substituted the walnuts for raisins to make them kid friendly and they turned out awesome!  I also did as many others did and used applesauce in place of some of the butter. I will be making these again.

Very good! Nice, light texture. I used oat bran instead of wheat bran as that's what I had on hand, half while wheat flour & half white flour, and added chocolate chips instead of walnuts (kids aren't allowed to take nuts to school).

fantastic, used entirely applesauce instead of oil/butter and flax seed and wheat germ (what I had) instead of the wheat bran.  Cut back on brown sugar a bit. Love these also with whole wheat flour or white whole wheat flour. Very filling and healthy. Baked convection 360 for 18 min and were perfect. Have also added choc chips or cinnamon chips for a little treat. SO GOOD.

The recipe written as is, is very good.  I made a few changes to suit us to make it even better.  I used more bran and less flour and used half the sugar since the ripe bananas are quite sweet.  I sometimes sub the nuts for dates or chocolate chips.  Great as written though and have made many dozen of these.

Have made these muffins many times.  Instead of all purpose flour, I use whole wheat flour.  I also find the batter a little thick so I add a little extra water or milk to moisten the muffins.  Otherwise, yummy muffins my whole family enjoys.

I had to make some substitutions based on what I had, so I used honey instead of brown sugar and wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. In my oven, 20 minutes was perfect. The end muffin is slightly sweet and moist. A very good recipe.

I should of read other reviews....I used the 1/2 cup of butter and it was drenched in oil after it baked. I had to soak up excess oil from the muffins. Next time, I'll reduce the butter to half. It tasted really good, tho.

Very good, moist and great flavor. I hate giving a rating after having modified it, but the only thing I added was 1 tsp of cinnamon because I'm a cinnamon nut. I did not put nuts in as my family doesn't like them. I will definitely be making again.

If you are looking for classic banana bran muffin recipe, this is not it. The recipe does not call for molasses which makes me wonder where the attached picture of the muffins came from. Also since the amount of bran is so small they taste more like a muffins only made from flour - very dough-ie

Delicious, very buttery, sweet and moist. I loved them.  I didn't have wheat bran and so used oat bran instead. My bananas were also fairly large so that may have helped them be moist and sweet.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I always make a new recipe exactly as the recipe says to, then if I want to tweek it I know where.My second batch I only changed the sweetner, but I did add a couple things. Butter? Of course, I'm not going to eat the whole batch. Instead of brown sugar (I don't know why folks think it's better for you, it's just white sugar with molasses added to it) I used organic sprouted barley malt syrup at 1/3 C. I soaked the bran in the milk while I prepared the batter, and, I added a cup of thawed cranberries that I gave a couple pulses in the processor and sprinkled a tablespoon of flour and a teaspoon of sugar on them before adding to batter. The flour keeps them suspended in the batter. I love the tart berries with the bananas and they came out just as wonderful as the original recipe. I normally use a scale for baking so I weighed the cup of cranberries I wanted in case anybody wants to add them.
Cranberries can be any size but weight is weight, chopped, whole, big or small. They weighed 5 oz.
Oh, to compensate for the extra moisture I used I simply used bread flour in stead. A cup of bread flour weighs a 1/4 oz more than all purpose. I made these in the giant 6 to a pan muffin pan.

I too tweaked this recipe to my taste. I use all wholewheat flour with 1/4 C ground flax seed. 4 bananas and omit the milk. They always turn out so moist with great banana flavor!Good guilt-free recipe.

I gave this a 4 because I made some variations.  Very moist, great texture and very tasty muffins.  I doubled this recipe and added 1/2c. flax seed meal, 1/4c. Chia seeds (grounded up) 2 tsp. all spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I also soaked the bran in the milk and added an extra 1/4c. milk (for added moisture because I added the extra flax and chia)  I also did 2c. whole wheat flour and 1c. All purpose flour.  (I usually take 1/2 butter and replace it with applesauce but didn't have any this time.)  I didn't add the nuts as I wanted to send these to school for the kids lunches.  Made 3/4 of the recipe plain and added Chocolate chips to the last portion.  These Were Great. Will be keeping this recipe.

My 1 & 2 year olds love these. I follow the recipe other than replacing half of the butter with apple sauce and half of the white flour for whole wheat flour. I also used oat bran because that is what I had. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, really good.  The bran and banana flavors are balanced nicely.  Threw in some mini chocolate chips to tempt my picky eaters and the first batch was gone in less than two days.

Love these! Sometimes I add cinnamon or semi-sweet chocolate chips, there are lots of variations you could implement! I also use half whole wheat flour and pecans over walnuts, just as a personal preference. They're such a great, wholesome snack on the go!

OMG. These muffins are delicious. These are the only substitutions I made to make them healthier: substituded 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter, decrease the flour to 1 cup and added in 1/2 cup oat bran, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons truvia baking sugar, and added a couple chocolate chips for good measure. HOLY MOLY. They are dense, moist, delicious and incredibly healthy!!!! And the batter made enough for about 16 muffins. I'll be making these as often as I have a sweet tooth (every single day). Thank you for the excellent recipe!

Good basic muffin recipe. I made a few changes to incorporate flax seeds and whole wheat flour. I replaced the eggs with ground flax seeds (1 tbsp flax seed meal + 3 tbsp water replaces 1 egg). I used 1 cup of wheat bran and 1/2 cup of each whole wheat and all purpose flour. The muffins came out moist and more healthy.

Light, fluffy muffins. Even my teenager liked them. I doubled the bran (used bran buds cereal) and reduced the flour. Also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses. Used raisins instead of walnuts. Yay! Super yummy!

Terrific!  I have been looking for a decent, healthy banana bread recipe for ages!  I used a whole wheat self rising flour (pancake flour actually) to reduce the number of ingredients I had to fool with (self rising allows you to skip the soda, powder, and salt).  Otherwise followed recipe exactly. But next time I will try applesauce instead of butter - probably a 'heavy' 1/2cup to ensure moist muffins.

it was a very good recipe. i added an extra banana, but used less butter, flour and sugar.  i substituted with a small Organic Applesauce (250 g, i think).  and i used more Bran and Oatmeal to replace the flour so it was still a total of 2 cups. Very moist and tasty. and a bit healthier.

Very good!  I added 1 tsp banana extract, I used 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 WW flour and 1/2 cup craisins.  I also added 1 Tbsp lemon juice.  Delicious, not too sweet, nice and moist.  Thanks this is a keeper!

Very good.  I used oat bran instead of wheat bran, and i only had 2 bananas, but they turned out great!

These are very good for a bran muffin. You can definitely taste that they are healthier (so of course my family didn't like them as much as the Best Ever Banana Bread recipe I usually use from this site). I would make them again. And I used mini choc. chips instead of nuts.

Very good muffin recipe. We are just beginning the transition from junky eating to a healthier diet so the addition of bran is a good step for us. Came out moist and satisfying, yummy!

When my daughter requested muffins she could pull from the freezer for school-day breakfasts, I looked for a recipe that wasn't basically an unfrosted cupcake, and these fit the bill. My only modification was to add a handful of mini chocolate chips.

Perfect. She loved them, and they freeze and reheat well.

Used light soy milk instead of regular milk and applesauce instead of the butter.  They came out great!  Could probably even afford a little more wheat bran.

Loved 'em. Only committed to a half batch for the first try. Added wheat germ, dried apple and raisins for added nutrition, taste and texture.
Delicious.

great recipe, one that I will be making again. I cup the butter by 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. The recipe yeilded 18 muffins for me.

Very good! I made them without the nuts, but next time, I think I will try adding raisins. Thanks!

very very tasty!!!!!
my sister and i enjoyed this a whole lot.  i used soy milk and substituted the butter with applesauce and 1 T. oil to make it less fattening.  but then i added choco. chips so didn't make a dif anyway :P
my parents thought they were ok, but they don't enjoy muffins with choco. chips, they find it to be too sweet like a cupcake, but either way they still said it was good.  if i make it again, i may use nuts instead of choco. chips.
