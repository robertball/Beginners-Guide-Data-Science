This is an easy and great tasting receipe. I changed it a little; I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. I also cut the sweet potatoes in chunks raw, placed them in a buttered covered casserole dish and pour the sauce mixture over them, put them in a 375 degree oven for approx. an hour until the potatoes were done. Less time in the kitchen and less cleanup. Will use it again!

Yams were very good.  I added cinnamon and vanilla extract to the recipe.  Next time I will reduce or cut out the orange juice.  I found the juice to be a bit overpowering.

This recipe is great~ I made a few changes to it. I used yams instead of sweet potatoes. The color and the taste of the dish turned out better with yams~ I didn't add the orange juice to it also, so that it can caramelized~ It tasted just as good without the orange juice! I will make this dish again, but next time, I'll add less butter to it~

These are to die for! I make these sweet potatoes every holiday we get! :)

Make sure you boil the sweet potatoes until just a tad bit under done. That way when you cook them in the butter and brown sugar, they'll cook the rest of the way there and not break up and turn to mush.

edited to add...you need to add another 3/4 cup brown sugar to make the sauce not runny. I also cut the orange juice a tad too.

This is almost the same as the one I make every year except I add about 1/4 teas of cinnamon and precook the sweet potatoes then slice and put in the candied sauce.  I have made the day before and then put the in the oven to heat while making the gravey.  Have been asked many times to bring these to pot lucks.

This was very good - easy and delicious.  The orange juice adds a wonderful taste - if you have any doubts, add a little, taste it and decide if you want to add more.  I also sliced the potatoes and boiled them with the skin on.  After they were tender, I drained the water, let them cool and then cubed the potatoe slices. It is easier to cut cooked sweet potatoes then raw ones.

These were yummy!  I used 3 large sweet potatoes and instead of baking for boiling them, I microwaved them until finished and then peeled the skin off and cubed them.  I also added a cinnamon spice mix to give it some flavor while cooking...I think that made them even better!  My husband loved them!  I had it as a side dish to "awesome honey pecan prok chops".  SO YUMMY!  O

This is an excellent recipe for sweet potatoes and very easy.  It also works well with pineapple juice instead of orange juice.

I love this recipe.  My friends and family request I bring this every year for Thanksgiving.  It's great because it's easy and you don't need the oven for it.  The only thing I change in the recipe is less orange juice.  I use about half as much OJ, which seems to be just enough for that extra tang but not enough for it to become overwhelmed.

These were great!  My family does not like the sweet potatoes with marshmallows and even those who do not like sweet potatoes in general (I am one) loved this recipe.  I have made this for three family holidays and it has become a favorite.

YUM!  These turned out great!  (Even better than my mom's.)  I used canned sweet potatoes/yams.  I turned the heat to high the last few minutes to carmelize them.  I also added a tad more brown sugar to thicken.  They were wonderful and I will make them every year for the holidays!

These candied sweet potatoes turned out pretty good!  It wasn't the easiest recipe because it did not specify how "large" the sweet potatoes had to be, so I eye-balled it since I bought JUMBO sweet potatoes.  RESERVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME for this recipe....the sweet potatoes have to boil (or cook depending on which way you do this recipe), the butter, brown sugar, and O.J. have to mix thoroughly.  And then the "Candied" process begins...which takes around 20-25 minutes of attention, sturring, and a careful eye.  All in all, I like this recipe, I wouldn't give it 5 stars for preparation, probably 4.  But 5 out of 5 stars for taste.  My family enjoyed it!  Happy Holidays!

I made these yesterday, and I had to eye ball everything because I had to make a Big pan full of them. I cheated and bought the canned yams and drained them. I put the yams in one of those turkey cooking trays and filled it up. I then turned the oven on to 375 and cooked the yams for 25mins while I got the sauce ready. I again had to double up on the sauce, but I used everything. I added just a little spoon full of cornstarch to thinken up the sauce. Once missed well I took out the yams and poured the sauce on them. I covered it with foil and put in back in to cook for about 15 mins, then pulled it out and put little marshmellows on top and put them back in the oven to melt. My husband brought these to work for a pot luck and everyone loved them. It was all gone real fast.
*PS* Dont forget to put foil over the yams while they are cooking without the marshmellows on them.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I am not a fan of the marshmallow version of sweet potatoes, and really like them baked with butter, so the addition of the orange juice was a nice variation.  As all cooks will do I did tweek it a bit.  I added a little fresh grated nutmeg, some cinnamon and just a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Also as previous reviewers did, I made the sauce and pour it over the sliced raw potatoes, then baked them in a 350 degree oven for about an hour (basting every 15-20 min).  What I like most about these is you don’t have to make them Thanksgiving day, you can make them a couple of days ahead of time, keep covered in the refrigerator and reheat them for 15-20 minutes just before serving.

This is my favorite side dish with a nice turkey dinner! My family has been making this since before I can remember! We do make it slightly different. 1st we do not add any orange juice, 2nd we do not boil the yams or sweet potatoes. We peel the yams/sweet potatoes, then we slice them into about 1 inch slices. Next we melt the butter then add in the dark brown sugar, then we add in a little cinnamon. Next we let that melt and get bubbly.(on a low setting or it will burn)Now this is were my mom puts in raisins and pecans.(I don't like them so when I make it I don't add them in) Next we add the sliced yams/sweet potatoes to the brown sugar mixture. Then we coat all the yams/sweet potatoes with the mixture, turn it on a low setting, and cover the pot. Keep stirring gently every so often until they are nice and tender. Absolutely delightful!!

This was a nice change. I boiled the potatoes and stuck them in the fridge to cool. Then several hours later removed the skins, and cooked them accordingly. I think this helped them from becoming too mushy, which inevitably happens towards the end. I didn't adjust anything but did add cinnamon.

I halved the OJ, used 1/3 cup of sugar, and sprinkled almonds on top. Also, added nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla extract and a pinch of cayenne. Best sweet potatoes I've had all year.

This is one of my favorite dishes brought to the table on Thanksgiving. It’s very similar to what my family makes. I added a bit more of brown sugar because mine seemed kind of soupy but it turned out great! This recipe is a keeper.

This is a delicous and easy recipe for sweet potatoes.  The sauce has a wonderful unique blend of flavors from the butter, brown sugar, and orange juice.  My mother is a southern lady who is now in her eighties.  She had me prepare this for Thanksgiving dinner.  She loved them!  I would highly recommend this scrumption and EASY way of cooking sweet potatoes.

These turned out great!  Like some of the other readers I used a little less OJ since I had NOT from concentrate and it was mentioned it might be too strong, this worked out perfectly!   I was concerned there might be too much sauce so I scooped some out and just added a little more at the end.   I did end up adding a bit more brown sugar to thicken the sauce up.  Also I slightly underboiled the potatoes to keep them from being too mushy and right at the end I turned the heat up almost to high to get a some good carmelization on them and it worked out perfect.  I will absolutely make this again

This is a great and easy recipe.  There are a lot of inconsistencies with these reviews for a few reasons.  Two large yams are aprox 2 lbs., so a large yam may be small to one and considered 'large' to another.  The orange juice potency makes a difference too.  I've made them twice and had a different outcome with the same measurements.  The purer the OJ, the stronger the taste.  I prefer the 'concentrate'.  Not overbearing.  Overall, it is an idiot proof dish.  It is a bit mushier than it states - but who cares? It tastes great!

These are delicious. I followed some of other reviewers suggestion and put the potatoes in a 9X13 and baked them, instead of doing the stovetop bit. I also added marshmallows on top. The selling point is the brown sugar, butter, orange juice mixture, though. Love it! Everybody at the Thanksgiving table said these were the best they had ever had. I would have to agree! Thanks!

The family really enjoyed this recipe. I cut the orange juice down as suggested by some others. I also found that there was a lot of sauce. I would cut the butter in half next time--could probably cut some of the sugar without losing flavor too. However, it was really yummy and I will make it again soon.

Last year, we all liked the special fresh zing that the orange juice added, so I'm making these again this year.  Don't let the description fool you -- they are sweet, but not cloyingly so.  However, I did change it a bit in that I added raisins (grew up having sweet potatoes with raisins and brown sugar and can't imagine them without raisins), which may have made them taste sweeter.  

While some of our leftovers got thrown away, we ate all of these for days until they were all gone!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe, no doubt it will be a yearly tradition now. I had boiled the sweet potatoes too long, so it turned out to be "Mashed Candied Sweet potatoes" but I actually think I like it better!! My family LOVED it!!

So easy and so delicious. I baked some of the potatoes (then removed the skin) and boiled some. I think next time I'll boil all. Boiling was easier (I left the skin on)and they tasted just as good.

Made this for husband's family for Thanksgiving, as they don't do the marshmallow recipe. Baking them raw, in syrup, is quicker, and fine, but the edges get a little chewy. Boiling and stirring cooked potatoes into sauce is better result. I did some of both, since I had cut more potatoes than fit in a single layer of a 9x13 pan. Really a good recipe, quick, simple. I used a little shy of the amt of OJ in the recipe.

Very good.  I also omitted the orange juice, and in the last minute of cooking I added 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup chopped pecans.  It cut the sweetness and added some creaminess.

Used maple syrup instead of brown sugar.  Baked in oven at 375 for about an hour.

This is an excellent recipe.  I was looking for a recipe my biological family use to make when I was a child.  This was so close & so yummy.  I added some large marshmellows on top & it was perfect, not to sweet.  I never would of thought to add the orange juice, great ingredient.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving, and my family widely agreed the it was less sweet and "more like a vegetable" than our usual fare.  This, in spite of the fact, that I covered the sweet potatoes with candied pecans.  However, this was universally viewed as a good thing, as you could taste the potatoes and their orange juice compliment, instead of just getting a mouthful of sugar and marshmallow.   I will definitely make this again, and I look forward to experimenting with some of the advice other reviewers have offered such as substituting maple syrup for the brown sugar, and adding bits (1/4  to 1/2 teaspoon) of cinnamon and nutmeg with the melted butter.

This recipe was easy to make and was very good but, I thought it had a bit of an overbearing OJ taste to it.  Still a delicious recipe though.....

I had bought fresh sweet potatoes and was searching for a recipe that I could use for them.  When I found this one I thought it sounded very easy and tasty but I didn't have any OJ!  I looked around my kitchen for a substitute and decided to use Diet Root Beer instead.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I also added some cinnamon and when they were cooked and plated, I threw on a dollop of marshmallow fluff (it melts over the hot potatoes) and YUM!  I only gave 4 stars because of the changes I made--but these were delicious!!  My boyfriend ate just about the entire pot!

I thought this recipe was very good--I used yams instead.  After following the rest of the recipe, I added the McCormick cinnamon and sugar to a portion and that made it just right!  I do agree that the orange juice should be reduced a bit so as to not overwhelm the taste; but overall, it is a very simple recipe.  For my next portion, I will not boil, but bake as I usually do to control the texture of the yams.

This receipe was so easy to make and it was the best sweet potatoe recipe I have ever tried. They were so good that I almost ate it all out of the frying pan before I served it too my family. Even my Husband who says that he hates sweet potatoes enjoyed it.

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes.  I made them for a special birthday dinner for my sister-in-law because it's one of her favourites and SHE loved them.  So I guess I did them right! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great basic Sweet Potato recipe. Add Vanilla, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, and a pinch of ground Clove for a spicier flavor, and a dash of a good bourbon to really kick it up a notch!

Thanks for a great recipe

very impressed with the flavor enhancement by the OJ.  I went for a little healthier aspirations and used honey instead of sugar and olive oil instead of butter.

AMAZING! Will be a staple in our home for years to come. I only used a splash of OJ and I added a squirt of syrup while the brown sugar was heating up. Would have been perfect with the said recipe but we like it extra sweet =)

As someone who likes my sweet potatoes sweet, these were excellent.  I used apple juice because it's what I had. The brown sugar got nice and syrupy, and they reheated well.  Great recipe, and I can't wait to try it with maple cream.

These came out different than I expected - the sweet potatoes became a bit of mush, rather than staying in chunks, but the flavor was very good.

Fantastic way to prepare sweet potatoes!  I've finally found the ticket to getting my picky little one to scarf down an orange vegetable!  It took much longer than 20 minutes for me to get the sauce to caramelize, but it was well worth the wait!  Thanks!

These were a big hit, even my 6 month old son loved them!  I didn't use the OJ for our Thanksgiving meal, (wasn't sure that it would come out good and didn't want to disappoint everyone) next time I make these I will definitely use the OJ but even without it they were fabulous!

Fantastic recipe - these were a big hit at Thanksgiving this year. Even my boyfriend, who usually doesn't like sweet potatoes, went back for seconds.  I followed the advice of several posters here and reduced the orange juice to half of what the recipe recommended. It was still pretty powerful - I'd suggest either reducing the amount to 1/4 (see how you like it), or even eliminating it from the recipe all together.  Anyhoo, great dish - will definitely be making this again. Super easy to prepare and re-heated really well.

I made this, it was totally awesome,I did have to add some thickening, (cornstarch),And found that to thicken the sauce taking the potatoes out made a big difference... The tang of the orange juice (which I had never used before) mellowed out the sweetness. Totally loved by all

I made this for Thanskgiving last year (with no changes to the recipe) and it didn't go over well.  My husband and father really like sweet potatoes, but they didn't like these because they were too sweet.

I love this side dish and so do my so very picky bunch! My 1 1/2 year old ate his entire serving and wanted more. He is the pickiest of picky. My 6 1/2 year old son loved them I just told them they were cooked oranges. My 3 1/2 year old daugther ate a couple bites and that's really good for her. Thanks for the recipe :)

Really good basic recipe for sweet potatoes. I baked my medium - large potatoes a little over an hour and it was a little to long but still quite good. These were the most popular dish - everyone had some - at Thanksgiving.

I roasted, rather than cooked this dish. I cut the sweet potatoes into small cubes, boiled the sauce, poured it on top and then baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes. They were soft and tender, just a tad too oily.

I roasted, rather than cooked this dish. I cut the sweet potatoes into small cubes, boiled the sauce, poured it on top and then baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes. They were soft and tender, just a tad too oily.

This was really good, but a little orange-y for my taste.  Next time, I will use 1/2 water and 1/2 orange juice.  

I used a 2.5 lb can of "yams," mixed up the liquid ingredients (adding a teaspoon of cornstarch in a little cold water), heated it a to melt the butter, then added the canned yams.  Simmered for 15 minutes, the sauce was the perfect amount and consistency.  I like this recipe.

This was a hit with our Christmas Dinner. Those who love sweet potatoes -- LOVED IT!  I used fresh sweet potatoes - not canned.

Very good tasting. My only complaint was that the sauce was too "watery" next time I will add some cornstarch to it to thicken it up better.

Followed this exactly as it was written and it was delicious. My father, who is very finicky, declared this as the best sweet potatoes ever. Even I enjoyed them and I HATE sweet potatoes.

These did not come out as I had anticipated.  The orange juice ruined the taste.  I think that it would have been WAY better if I had nilled the orange juice.

Loved this recipe!! I will have to make double the amount next time.  There were no leftovers & everyone raved about them.  Even won over the relatives who never liked then.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I added a tablespoonful of pumpkin pie spice and half a teaspoonful of salt when I was cooking down the butter and brown sugar.  It's a family thing--my grandmother used to add the spices and I follow tradition.

I've only used fresh sweet potatoes once before for a project in high school. Very easy recipe for someone with no experiance and very tasty for my very picky dad. Probably will use more OJ next time I make them.

Served this for Easter dinner.  The whole family LOVED it!  I omitted the o.j., and added 1/4t nutmeg and 1/2t cinnamon.

Great easy recipe.  The orange juice is a nice touch to give the sweet potatoes a different flavor.

The orange juice flavor overpowers this recipe... I'll experiment again to see if I can't improve it.

Bachelor friendly.

AWESOME! Here's my easier version:
Buy the fresh precooked sliced yams in the meat section at the grocery.  Add butter and brown sugar recommended in recipe, but add corn syrup instead of the OJ.  Let simmer 20 minutes.  DELISH!

This is the way I remember my grandmother making candied sweet potatoes every Thanksgiving! My husband never had them this way before, and he loved the recipe. This is a definite keeper!

These were delicious!  Just make sure to plan ahead.  The sweet potatoes took forever to tenderize..but the sauce was very good and this was well worth the wait.

This was good!  I microwaved the sweet potatoes (although they got too soft in the microwave), and added raisins and marshmallows in the end.  It turned out to be very sweet, so I should not have changed the recipe.  The orange-flavored syrup was very good.
