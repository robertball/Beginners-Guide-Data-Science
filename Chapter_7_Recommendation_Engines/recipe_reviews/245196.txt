The ratios seem to be right in this recipe. As written in the description, I did strain the pulp after letting the blended cashews and water set for about an hour in the fridge. I didn't use the soaking water though. I drained off the water, rinsed the cashews and then added fresh water. I don't know why, but it kind of grossed me out to use the cloudy water. :-( Sorry. Thank you for the recipe.
