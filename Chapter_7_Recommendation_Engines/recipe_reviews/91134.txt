i have to say i'm disappointed. the muffins are quite moist and light but also flavourless. i added nutmeg vanilla and allspice. if i make again i'll use about half the oil and add a lot more spice. the coconut appears to add only texture not flavour.

this recipe is pretty good. the muffin is moist looks beautiful and tastes good. What makes it good are the chocolate chips. Without them the recipe is quite boring. I used regular sugar (dont have raw sugar in my town) and regular coconut (organic is not moist). Yes I will make these again but maybe I will experiment with adding cinnamon or maybe more chocolate chips.

Great light flavor. When you think pumpkin muffin you think pumpkin pie flavor. Not this one it's really wonderful and refreshing! Love it!

My boyfriend loved these I did not care for them much. He does not like cinnamon so I was excited to try a pumpkin recipe without spice. I did add vanilla and coconut extract without them I think it would be quite flavorless. These are not very sweet so if you like a less sweet muffin this is for you. My boyfriend is always complaining things are too sweet but he thought these were perfect. I will make them again for him.

I made these last night on a snow day and they turned out great. I used the big muffin pans and increased the baking time. I also added some toasted chopped walnuts to the top for something extra. Would definately make again.

These are delish!!! I used fat free sour cream instead of applesause and dark chocolate chips. Very rich and moist can't wait to share with neighbors.
