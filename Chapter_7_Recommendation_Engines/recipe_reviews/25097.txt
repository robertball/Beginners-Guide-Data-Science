These are missing something.  If you like hard chocolate bread like cookies then give them a go.

My Nana from Calabria brought over a wonderful recipe for cookies that we made at Thanksgiving and stored in bins (looked like the large popcorn bins that are used today)over the holidays. We all had this recipe, I know my twin still uses this but I think the others in my family may have lost the recipe. This is almost the closest to it. We used chopped maraschino cherries, raisins Allspice, citron and 10 eggs in our recipe. They are wonderful. The cookies have always been included in wedding trays and of course on the holidays.

After reading the reviews, I decided to experiment with some variations(which will most likelly be sacrilege to Italians): 1/4 recipe =  1 cup butter 3 cups flour 1 cup chocolate milk 1 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/3 cup cocoa(can be 2/3) 1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp cinammon 1/4 teaspoon each ginger, cloves 1 cup Callebaut choc chunks 1 cup pecans  Baked them at 350F for 12 minutes in a convection oven (15-16 in a regular oven). My wife thiught they were great

This recipe is out of this world! Be warned this takes a lot of mixing real estate but other than that it was great. Substituted Ground Cloves for Ground All Spice and was excellent. Perfect with coffee. Definitely a holiday keeper :)

It's more savory than sweet. The spices are the star of the show. It reminded me of a pumpkin muffin minus the pumpkin with a side of chocolate chips. I made it for my father at his request. If you like sweet, this isn't the cookie for you.

I wanted something unique so when I found this I was excited. Not quite perfect, a little bit too much like bread, but overall good flavor.

enjoyed! very different, appreciated that they are not overly sweet but tasty. mine were soft and I took them to a potluck where all raved and enjoyed. I did omit the choc chips and nuts as I am not a fan of either. Due to not drinking cows milk substituted ccunut milk and they were great!

These certainly are not the prettiest cookies I've ever made, nor are they my favorite.  I halved it and it still was difficult for my KA to deal with this dough.  I did add a couple of eggs and only put them in for 10 minutes each batch.  I didn't really want biscotti type cookies; maybe that's what these are supposed to be, but I didn't want that.  Hubs thought they didn't have enough sugar; I agree. They aren't very sweet, and they do look like little meatballs.  Not really my thing but thank you for the recipe!  Glad I could try.

I've been looking for this recipe, my mom always made these for the holidays. I added 1/2 teaspoon of grated orange peel. Will make them again.
