This was great. Next time I would use a lemon cake micpx. I juiced one lemon and measured the amount of juice. I subtracted that amount of juice so I used one cup of water and took away three tablespoons. I then added the three tablespoons of lemon juice to the water. I also added the zest of one lemon.
After the muffins came out of the oven, I used a straw and poked holes in them. I then poured a hot glaze over them. YUM

Delicious recipe - we all loved these. They do remind me a little bit of cupcakes but regardless, yummy! Might splurge a little next time we prepare them and put some lemon icing on top :)

These are good but taste more like a cupcake than a muffin.  I would also prefer a little more lemon flavor (maybe add some lemon zest next time).  Thanks for sharing this recipe, STAMFAM!

Excellent I couldn't find the lemon poppy seed muffins any where close to me so I tried this recipe, but used lemon cake mix otherwise followed this recipe as written.  It had the perfect taste of lemon.  These tasted just like the ones I use to buy t Harris Teeter except fresher.
This is my go to Muffin recipe.

Delicious and easy, much better with the addition of real lemon juice and grated lemon zest.

Definitely taste more like a cupcake than a muffin. Pretty good tasting but not lemony enough even though I did add lemon juice as some of the reviews suggested.

These turned out really well and they were so quick and easy! The only thing I changed was adding a little bit of glaze made with powdered sugar, The juice of 1 lemon and the zest of that same lemon. My hubby thought they were amazing and he's not much of a "muffin man"!

Very good I liked how easy and fast it was so if I don't have time to go into a lengthy recipe I use this and they are great light fluffy and moist though I would probably add some lemon extract next time I like more lemon flavor

I have made these a couple times now. All in all the muffins are good. The texture is cake like, light and fluffy. I personally was looking for a more dense muffin. very quick easy and simple recipe to whip up!

I make these muffins quite often and my family loves them.  I change the recipe a bit as they don't have a strong lemon flavor.  I add the juice of a fresh squeezed lemon and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Makes them perfect every time!
