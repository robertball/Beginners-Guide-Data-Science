Very tasty and VERY sweet.  I'll reduce the amount of sugar in the future, but then, we've been trending toward less sweet these days (so this is a personal taste preference).  Just good, old fashioned comfort food pickles that folks have been making for years.  Thanks, bhoff, for sharing Buryl's recipe.
