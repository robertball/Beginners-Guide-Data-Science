I made this recipe to the T, and it turned out FABULOUS! I would suggest leaving about two inches on the end you are rolling towards without any toppings, otherwise the filling will smoosh off the edge.

I made these for Recipe Group. Easy to put together, and very tasty! I used some roasted red pepper instead of tomato. The bacon came through as a really strong flavor. I'm going to taste test again when the cream cheese mixture has sat for a bit and see how they are then. I would use more pesto the next time, no bacon drippings, and I think they would be fine without the added turkey in there also as a quick appetizer. Would be very easy to change this up with adding almost any seasonings. Nice recipe, thanks Windy! The flavor does develop more after sitting. The guys went crazy over these and I couldn't stop eating them.

Overall this recipe was great and I got many compliments.  I did not use a whole pound of bacon, instead I used about half.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese (Neufchatel) and nobody noticed a difference!  Thanks for sharing!

these were very good, I only made a 1/2 recipe to try them. I fried the bacon and put them together in the morning. I left them in the fridge for the next day for lunch boxes. The flavour was very good. Very versatile recipe-could change up with ham, roasted pepper and galic-let your imagination run.  Great quick appetizer idea.

These were just "ok" for us. The tortilla flavor  was dominate, instead of the filling. I did not use the bacon drippings. Cold, solid grease did not sound appealing.

great! however, if you buy the whipped cream cheese it makes it much easier to spread and cuts down on time.

Served these for a holiday party (very festive w/ spinach wraps & a little more tomato!) ~ I used 1/3 fat CC, & less bacon drippings.) Made the CC mixture a day ahead, did the rolling the morning of, & chilled them until slicing just prior to plating. They were gobbled quickly, but the general consensus was that the pesto overwhelmed the bacon & tomato ~ no biggie! Looking forward to making these again w/ a different combo of fillings ~ thx Windy B.!

Very Good. I did make two changes since I was only making 1 wrap, I used onion and chive cream cheese rather than making up flavored cream cheese. I really enjoyed this wrap, it had a nice flavor. My other change was that I used low carb tortilla.

Not bad! Next time I'd add fresh spinach and more tomato. I used 6 inch tortillas but otherwise followed this to the letter. The pesto wasn't overwhelming at all but added a nice flavor and I might use more next time. The bacon (and the grease) was great.. not greasy or gross. :) Yum! Oh and this filled a 9x13 pan with standing sandwiches.

These were delicious!  I did spinach wraps instead of regular and added more pesto, as the recipe barely called for any.  I also added more tomatoes and chopped them finely and sprinkled them over the turkey slices before rolling. They were definitely a hit!

These were ok. I used whole wheat/low carb tortillas, reduced fat pesto, fat free cream cheese and turkey bacon to cut down on calories. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the amount of pesto. I also doubled the amount of tomato. It reminded me of blts, seemed like it was missing more tomato and lettuce. Not sure I would make these again.

I loved these more than I can say. Used Diane's Spinach Basil Pesto and added diced roasted red peppers which I recommend. Decided not to mix the ingredients but to layer them on the tortilla and then rolled. Wrapped the roll in plastic wrap and refrigerated for a couple of hours so it was easy to cut into nice rounds.

Brought this to a party for 12. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I did NOT add the bacon drippings and instead of using flour tortillas, I used Flat-Out brand multigrain wraps, wrapped lengthwise.  Thinking I might add a bit more pesto the next time, but definitely keeping this one handy.  They went together really quickly.  I did find that refrigerating them was a good idea as they were very soft.

Didn't use turkey, added lettuce, so it was more of a BLT, but made a big hit.

I've had lots of roll up over the years, but this one has a great twist to it. My only thing would be maybe spreading the cream cheese, bacon drippings, and pest on the tortilla then sprinkling the more chunkier toppings on.

I made this recipe and scaled it down to half.  I ended up using Dempsters vegetable wraps made with carrot and pumpkin.  It turned out really good and flavorful.  I used Classico brand Basil Pesto which went well with my choice of bacon and fresh green onions and tomato from the garden!  I did use the bacon drippings which helped with the mixing - It was a hit with the office lunch I brought it to!

I was excited to try this recipe but it was not good.  Followed the recipe as written, but I think the problem was using store bought prepared pesto.  All the other ingredients came together well except the pesto.  I may try again and swap out the pesto for ranch dressing.

Made this for the first time for a party...all was gone in a matter of minutes. One thing...it didn't seem to make as many as recipe promised, but still great!
