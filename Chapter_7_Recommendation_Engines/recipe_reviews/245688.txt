The only change I made in the recipe was I used Wilton Christmas Sprinkles and Holiday M&Ms instead of the peppermint candies.  Don't add the M&Ms in too quickly or they will melt.  I also added an extra step to the recipe.  I dumped the bags of popcorn onto a cookie sheet to get the unpopped kernels out before I coated the popcorn.  I made two double batches and should have made more. Everyone loved it!

We left out the peppermint, because we were just looking for the right amounts of almond bark to use. 
It's sweet, it's salty - what more could you ask for? :D

It is easy to make only I put my popcorn in a brown bag after popping and pour the chocolate and nuts over the popcorn then shake until coated.  It makes for a lot less mess.

Iâ€™ve made this twice. The first time I used one bag of white chocolate chips but tripled the popcorn using 3 bags of lightly salted microwave popcorn and 6 crushed candy canes.  The second time I doubled the recipe using two bags of lightly salted microwave popcorn, four candy canes  and six squares of almond bark. I cooked bark in microwave for 30 second intervals, until melted, stirring after each time, and it took about 1 1/2 minutes to melt.  I liked the consistency of the bark better. Put the two bags of popcorn in a very large bowl, drizzled 1/3 of melted bark, sprinkled 1/3 crushed candy canes on top, then mixed with a large spatula. Repeated two additional times.  Spread on parchment paper lined cookie sheets. This is a refreshing holiday snack. Lots of compliments.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is such a simple, yet elegantly delicious way to spruce up popcorn around the holidays. I made a huge boss and divvied it up for coworkers of my husband and I. This is now my go to recipe for chocolatey-minty-yummy popcorn! Everyone loved it too!!

Delicious! Everything went well together. I sprinkled some extra peppermint candies on top before the chocolate set just to make it look prettier. I would make this again foe sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
