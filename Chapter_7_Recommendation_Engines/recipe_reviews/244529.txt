This was a really fun recipe. I did leave out the ginger due to personal preference. While in a hurry, I misread an ingredient. I read corn flour as cornmeal. Here in the South we fry our okra in cornmeal so it was an honest mistake on my part. On that note, I could not get the breading to stick to the okra and ended up having to dip it in egg. I think an egg would be beneficial if you were using corn flour too. Just my opinion. Stuffing the okra was a bit time consuming and then you lost some of it while shaking it in the breading. I think next time I would just season the cornflour or cornmeal with the stuffing ingredients and call it good. Overall good recipe, fun, and worth trying.
