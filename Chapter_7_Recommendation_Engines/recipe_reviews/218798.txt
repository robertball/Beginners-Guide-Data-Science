Basic dressing. I did not use the corn oil only because I did not have any. I ended up using this as a base recipe once I tried it and added more spices and some fresh minced garlic. This would be good for any kind of salad you'd want to make, just add spices to match your meal (ex: basil, red pepper flake for italian dressing or rice wine vinegar, green onion, fresh ginger, sesame seeds for asian dressing......).

Light and refreshing - just as the submitter states! Very easy to put together and tastes great.  I didn't have corn oil, so I subbed a little veg. oil and added a bit of dried basil as well. Perfect over mixed greens and fresh tomatoes! Thanks for a great recipe Lillian!

I left out the corn oil and sugar. I always refrigerate it. Just take it out about 1/2 hr. before serving and it'll pour again.

Fantastic! I normally don't rate/review recipes unless I try them as is, and I did have to make one substitution (I didn't have corn oil, so I used canola oil)... but it was so great I had to review it anyway. Thanks for sharing!

Just whipped this one up, added a clove of garlic, 2 small sprigs of fresh marjoram and a few fresh basil leaves, chilled it for a couple of hours, mixed some in fresh homemade pasta with chopped tomatoes and green pepper, gave it a little taste test.....oh my!!!!  Cant wait til its chilled completely!!!  Fantastic!  Will NEVER buy bottled dressing again.  Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe!

I made this to go on Sylvia's Easy Greek Salad, wanted something lite. I didn't have corn oil so just left it out. I did already had fresh oregano and parsley for the salad so used that instead of dry herbs. I did mix in a dash or two of powdered garlic and less salt...trying to cut out salt in my diet. This was lite enough to let the fresh taste of the salad come through and didn't have that heavy oil or vinegar taste....thanks Lillian.

I like a bit more taste to my salad dressing. Next time I'll add some fresh pressed garlic.

This recipe saved the day!   A Saturday at the shore in the summer is not the time to hit the supermarket.  I was caught without any Italian dressing for the pasta salad I was making.  When I saw this was Lillian's recipe I knew the day was saved!   Thanks Lillian for such a terrific recipe, it's SUPER!

i used olive oil since i didnt have corn oil. this is nothing special its pretty tangy but its really basic. it worked fine on a simple pasta salad with tomatoes and cheese. if i make it again i would cut the vinegar some but not up the oil.

I made two servings for myself which was the perfect amount.  Omitted the corn oil because I don't have it but it was still delicious.  Will definitely be making this often.

I realized after prepping all my ingredients that we were out of Italian dressing. This recipe saved my salad! We did tweak it a bit. I used only olive oil, we don't use any other vegetable oil. We also used fresh herbs from the garden: sage, thyme, basil, and fresh pressed garlic. I didn't have dried oregano, so subbed a bit of Italian seasoning. The only reason I gave it four stars, was because it was oily (compared to store bought) on the lips and tongue when eating it. This may be because it was a home made dressing, I don't know. I have never made my own before. This dressing went on my quinoa and fresh veggie salad. My friend is gluten and dairy free, and she loved it. Thank you!

I was going to give this four stars, but then my husband commented how much he loved it, so it went up to five.  I do have a couple of notes, though ... the first being that corn oil or canola oil may make a slight difference in flavor, but honestly, one really isn't better than another.

Yes, you can bump this up to do what you need it to - add garlic, additional herbs, etc., but this is IMPORTANT:  do NOT leave it on the counter, as one poster has mentioned.  While the oils and vinegar are fine, the herbs will spoil if this is not kept in the fridge.  You still shouldn't keep it more than two weeks.

Yes, if you keep it in the fridge, it will thicken and separate.  An easy way around that is to keep this in a mason jar.  You don't have to whisk it every time - just shake away.  It'll thin out and mix well, and be ready for the next use.

This recipe is great!! I added red pepper flakes and Honey. If I don't have Oregano, I will use Basil or Italian spices. And I always pour extra Vinegar.

WOW! This is fantastic.  Light and tasty; perfect on my pasta salad (cooked whole grain rotini, grape tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, fresh grated parmesan, etc.).  I made two batches and reduced the amount of vinegar in the second batch (it was a tad tangy for me).  I also added a few shakes of grated parmesan... YUM!  So grateful to Lillian for sharing her recipe.  :)

This is very easy and VERY good. I didn't add the corn oil because I didn't have it on hand. I will add half as much oil next time, but this is a great recipe.

I replaced corn oil with canola oil and used more pepper and oregano.  I substituted a very small amount of Extra Spicy Mrs. Dash for the salt.  Will use this in a chicken dish with honey and lime.

I halved this recipe; did not use the corn oil and subbed italian seasoning instead of oregano.  Was having a simple baby spinach salad with hard boiled eggs, red onion and swiss cheese chunks for dinner tonight and needed a light dressing for it.  This hit the spot!! So easy and quick to put together; best of all it tasted great.  Thanks for sharing, Lillian!!

My first homemade Italian dressing and I found the one. This is a very nice dressing. I added a few cloves of crushed garlic and some Herbs De Providence though as I thought it needed a little something extra. A great base to make it just what you are looking for.

*Did not have EVOO, used veg oil instead.
*Did not have corn oil, used veg oil instead.
*Due to allergies, omitted oregano and used parsley (for color) instead.

*Strong vinegar smell and taste but willing to try again using less vinegar.

I like to see an ingredients list use a consistent set of measures, so substituted 1/3 cup corn oil instead of 3 fluid ounces. For a light dressing, this one called for too much sugar and salt. I reduced sugar to 1 teaspoon and used organic brown sugar. I reduced salt to 1/4 teaspoon.

Just finished so it hasn’t had time to blend and mesh. It is quite tangy. I did add a bit of minced garlic and used Italian seasoning instead of oregano. Looking forward to using it in my recipe.

I added 1 crushed garlic clove & substituted canola oil for the corn oil & made as listed. This recipe is fantastic & better than any I've tried. I've also found my new chicken marinade with this recipe. Very tasty, very well done!

Fast, fresh and delicious!  Simple and no nonsense.  I used all olive oil  instead of corn oil and a tiny dash of stevia powder instead of sugar...

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe !  i've been looking for a way to use up a bottle of apple cider vinegar    I absolutely love this dressing! I used to  buy bottled Italian dressing and cover my salads with a ton of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor...no more!

Wanted home made Italian dressing for a cold rice and bean salad. This fit the bill. Skipped the sugar and oil for health reasons. Had a packet of "Italian Spices" so I just used that. Easy and good.

Really, really good, but I did add seasonings. I substituted canola for corn oil because that's what I had, and upped the oregano to 1 tsp. Also added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and two cloves fresh garlic, minced. Really great on the "Awesome pasta salad" from this site.

Needs double the sugar, replaced corn oil with cold pressed grape seed oil, or you could use avocado oil.  Also needed way more spices- garlic, basil etc. Really the only good thing about this was she used very healthy apple cider vinegar instead of reg.
