I would give it 5 stars but there are a couple issues with the recipe. It's not entirely vegan as chocolate is adulterated with milk and some types white sugar is processed with animal bone char, the refined kind of sugar. I used Billington's sugar and Lindt chocolate as vegan substitutes. Overall though, the cake turned out AMAZING!! I would recommend this again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

I made this devils cake over the weekend.  Not only is it quick and easy, it tastes amazing. I took it into work coz there are a few vegan eaters there and every person had a piece of cake and couldn't  believe how yummy it was. I will be making this as my chocolate  cakes from now on.  The flavor is unreal. Thank you for putting it on Allrecipes.com.

Absolutely amazing. No one could believe it was vegan! Excellent taste and texture. But use parchment paper - really not a good idea to use wax paper in the oven!!

Had to substitute unsweetened chocolate for vegan butter/cocoa mix because I had no chocolate in hand.  Still, it was the best vegan

I would make this cake again. It was tasty, although I lined the pans with the wax paper and it still stuck to the tops of the pans when done. Frosting fixed that problem.
