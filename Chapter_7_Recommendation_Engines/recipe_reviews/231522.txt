My kids love these. We make these all the time, but we always toast them first, and then instead of baking them we put them under the broiler to melt the cheese...it's a lot quicker that way and it gets the cheese nice and bubbly.

This is as easy as it gets.  I would recommend toasting the english muffins a bit before putting on the sauce - just so they don't get soggy and then you could finish them under the broiler if you wanted to.  I used a very meaty bolognese sauce that I had on hand instead of the pizza sauce.  Made for a quick lunch.

I like a crunchy English muffin so I toasted before putting it together. It came out wonderfully. the taste was very good I put some bacon bits on it and a slice of ham chopped between the 2 sides. I made it for lunch for my self and will make it for dinner for hubby.

I have been making these for over 40 years.  I also use bagels, if on hand.  Also any good quality pasta sauce in a jar works well too.  And I make with sauteed veggies as well as a variety of meats.  Excellent way to use leftovers and clean out the fridge!  Get creative and try with anything you normally like on pizza.  Here is my preferred process:  toast muffin or bagel lightly so they do not become soggy.  Top with sauce and place in toaster oven or regular oven if making for a crowd.  Let sauce get slightly bubbly.  Now top with your favorite toppings.  Place back for a couple minutes.  Now top with cheese.  This is the "glue" that holds everything together.  Suggested favorites are:  mozzarella, monterey jack, parmesan, goat, brie.  Pop back in till the cheese is as warm and bubbly as you desire!      Give it a minute or two as they are hot hot hot!  And you don't want to burn your mouth.  Get creative and enjoy!  Great for kids and as a hot passed appetizer.  Have also made on the gas grill and campfire too.

DELICIOUS!! They are so easy and small enough to be an appetizer and big enough for a meal for kids. I do this all the time for birthday parties.

I have been making these for years. I toast the English muffins so they are not soggy and I also add oregano and/or basil depending on who is eating them before adding the cheese. The best part about these is that they can be easily customized to taste for a large group.
