Great recipe.  For those who said it should marinate for a few hours -- you can't marinate fish for hours.  Max 30 min.  You'll partially cook the fish.  Fish isn't  like meat.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written, except I skipped the white wine because I didn't have any. The amount of the vinegar seemed to be way too much, and I was wondering how this glaze will turn out. While it was simmering, members of my family exclaimed: Something smells bad! I tried, and it didn't taste well either. But I still "took the risk", went on with the "experiment" and finished the meal. I'm glad I did! The fish tasted wonderful, and the recipe is an absolute keeper! Thanks!

I followed the recipe the first time around and thought it was pretty good.  When I make it now, I grate and add a little fresh ginger (1/4 to 1/2 tsp.) and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I marinate the fish in some of the sauce for 30 minutes.  To bake it, I spray wire racks with cooking spray and place them onto a large baking sheet and bake the fish on the racks as directed, basting at least once during the cooking time.

This recipe was outstanding! The glaze was easy to prepare in a small saucepan. I used a long filet instead of individual portions, and after it came out of the oven I folded the foil over it while I finished other things. The flavor permeated the fish beautifully, and left it nice and moist. A definite keeper.

Thank you.  I've recently been diagnosed with Meniere's disease and must follow a very low sodium diet.  A lot of the recipes I've found taste rather bland.  This one is a wonderful exception.  I used it with chicken last night and had the first tasty meal I've had in a while.  Keeper!

This arrived as a "Daily Dish" recipe on 2/14/08.  I made this without changes substituting boneless skinless chicken breasts for salmon, baking it at 375 for around 30 minutes.  Like some others, I was worried how this was going to turn out based on the way it smelled on the stovetop.  It turned out wonderfully and I will incorporate this into my rotation of sauces.  Thanks, Isybel!

We made this after I found the same recipe in my low-carb cook book. The only think they add in it is to add chopped Basil before serving. Fantastic dish!!! Served it with brown rice and garlic sauteed green beans. Will make this again for sure...very easy!

YUMM-O.  This is really good.  I did double the glaze because we really like our sauces...and I am glad that I did.  The only thing I added was some green onions for color and a little bit of a crunch (after baking).  I really liked it and hubby said it was good too.  Definately will keep this in our rotation.  Thanks for the post.

This glazed salmon turned out wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly and did not make any changes. It almost turned into a disaster though as I mis-read 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar for 1/3 cup honey. I was 2 seconds away from adding the honey when I realized my mistake. The flavor had depth and my friends enjoyed it too. If you enjoy salmon, you'll enjoy this glaze.

This is a staple in our house! It's quick, easy and delicious. My kids inhale this dish! It's also great in a pinch since I always have all the ingredients on hand.

We thought this was good. It did smell awful-but the end result was great. We did this 2x the second time used dill instead of oregano-better flavor! Thanks!!

I was really nervous to cook salmon because it is an expensive piece of meat to screw up! But, living in Alaska I have to take advantage of our natural resources! I made this recipe with a 1 1/2 lb Coho salmon. It was awesome. I didn't use the white wine, but used a tsp of lemon juice instead and I also used 2 tsp olive oil and 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano. This would have been great without changes, but this was just my preferance.  I think next time I will reserve more of the sauce, because some of it ran off and then started to burn on the foil towards the end. Then I will have more sauce to top it with before serving. I served this with fresh green peas from the farmers market and homemade rosemary bread dipped in olive oil and vinegar. I think this would be really good with this recipe for green beans in the Taste of Home Magazine (I have yet to try). Here is that recipe: Balsamic green bean salad; 2 lbs fresh green beans, (trimmed & cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces), 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 Tbsp lemon juice, 3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1 large onion, chopped, 4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved, 1 cup crumbled feta cheese. You just cook beans until crisp tender (8-10 minutes), drain & place in ice water. Then mix the seasoning ingredients in a bowl and drizzle over beans. Then refrigerate for an hour and mix in tomatoes and cheese. One 3/4 cup serving = 77 calories, 5 g fat, 7 carbs,  3 g fiber, and 3 g protein.

It is so refreshing to read a recipe that actually uses fresh ingredients - so many others use cans of this or dried packets of the other! My only quibble with this recipe is that the skin should not have been regarded as so much rubbish - the fish should have been baked skin side up so that it (the skin) crisped up - absolutely delicious. That's how top chefs cook salmon and similar fish.

This was great! My family gobbled it up. I  used one big fillet, so it took a little longer to cook. As you're stirring the glaze in the pan, you might be thinking it's too vinegar-y, but it really comes out so yummy! I will definitely do this again! Oh, also, I didn't have white wine or the oregano and still loved it.

This recipe was great, I really enjoyed the flavors and it was easy to prepare. I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I used yellow mustard. I was worried that would upset the taste, but it was still really good, next time I'll try the dijon.

Very yummy recipe.  I used a whole filet of Salmon.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  I also used parchment paper rather then foil - it works better to keep it from sticking. Thanks!

This was great. I substituted Splenda for the honey and basil for oregano. I doubled the sauce and poured half on the salmon and the other half over angel hair pasta. Also, I added orange peel to the pasta and squeezed the juice onto the fish after it was done. Really fantastic.

This recipe is excellent. Very easy. I was kind of leary of the balsamic vinegar, but it is delicious. Don't go lightly on the sauce smother it all over the salmon.

This was VERY good, I did add a bit more honey because it seemed a little too "vinegary" for my taste.  Both hubby and I thought it was wonderful though - nice change from the usual.

Well, we LOVED it.  No marinating.  (I did skip the oregano.)  I glazed the fillets, and let the remaining glaze cook down even more until syrupy to add to the fillets just before serving.  I only had to cook my fillets for 8 mins and they were done - beware overcooked salmon!  Served with balsamic/brown sugar carmelized onions (shallots)on top of fillets - SO GOOD!  It was a hit.

We live in SE Alaska and thanks to my fisherman husband we eat fresh king salmon all the time. We were looking for something that didn't call for lemon as we were out, and found this. I had fresh oregano in my garden and all of the other ingredients on hand, although I did use sweet honey mustard. It was delicious. We will do this again when we have company.

This recipe came out great!  I had no white wine, so used a little bit of lemon juice mixed with water instead.  The glaze was delicious and the salmon was moist.

I have made this recipe over and over.  It is delicious!  I do like to make a little extra glaze so I can use it as a sauce after the fish comes out of the oven.  To make it even more yummy, I squeeze lemon juice over top right before its served.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!

I came back to change my rating.  I tried this one again and it was wonderful!  Last time I made it and put it on tilapia or some other fish, and it wasn't very good.  This time I used it for salmon steaks and it was wonderful!  I think I'd make a bit more next time, since I ran out of glaze and didn't have any to put on them after they were done cooking.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I didn't particularly like this recipe. However, my step-daughter and husband loved it. I enjoy tasting the fish and the glazed somewhat masked the salmon flavor. It was also a little sweet for my taste. I tend to go for the savory things rather than the sweet.

Easy and delicious...making it again tonight!  Just be sure you stand over the stove so that the glaze doesn't burn!

I would've given it 5 stars except the filets were over cooked. 14 minutes is way too long! cook less, glaze was very tasty. Simple easy to prepare. Watch the time, I prefer mine bright pink in and cool in the center. Will cook again, but cut the cook time by at least half. This was very well done, and dry. :P

We love salmon and balsamic vinegar.  A local Italian restaurant serves something similar over a bed of fresh spinach.  I must have cook the sauce too much as it carmelized.  I need more sauce.  The mustard was 'almost' a turnoff but tried it anyway.  Lovely, lovely flavors .... just need more sauce!!!  This recipe is restaurant quality.

Great taste! Came home at 7 one day when I promised hubby dinner at 7.30. Saw this recipe; sauteed salmon fillets in pan - when cooked, put aside. Put glaze mixture in the same pan, let boiled. Add salmon, covered with glaze, simmer till preferred consistency. Wa-lah! Superb dinner in 15 mins! Thanks for the recipe :)

Thanks for a great way to bake salmon, Isybel.  I made this as written but had to use lemon juice instead of the wine as it was all I had.  The glaze was fantastic and I am so glad I took the effort rather than buying ready made glaze.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe - was wary of glaze since there was so much more balsamic vin. than the other ingredients, but came out perfect...if you actually let the glaze sit for a couple mins it actually solidifies more to be a glaze (not liquid). The glaze tasted awesome and did not overpower the taste of the salmon which I already love. Served it with green beans and bruschetta...really good.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years and have never found a recipe I like better.  Never gets the wine because there is none in the house so use plain water instead.  I love good balsamics so I buy from a specialty shop that sells nothing but olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Of course more expensive than store bought but so worth it.  I've been using a jar of crushed garlic so doesn't need to sauté the whole 3 minuets before I add the rest of the ingredients.

Not bad. I was expecting a vinegary kind of taste but it was more sweet than anything. Not that it was bad at all. It was good just sweet. I would make it again just maybe just cut back on the sugar and maybe add more  vinegar.

This was a very good, low-sugar recipe for salmon! I didn't have any white wine on hand, so I had to use red wine vinegar, but it still turned out good!

I really liked this and it was easy to prepare. I added more honey to suite my taste. I would recommend tasting the glaze before putting it on the salmon to see if you need to add more honey, dijon, salt, etc.

Quick, Easy and Delicious! Just the kind of recipe that I like. The foil is a must as this sauce can be a nightmare to get off the pan. The fresh oregano made a big difference too! I would recommend fresh over dried. I tried the garlic with the non stick spray as the recipe states but it ended up globbing together and burning. I tried it again and  I added a little olive oil to the pan to saute the garlic. Much better!  The sauce is so flavorful we will defninitly make this again.

Yummy.  I used apple juice instead of wine.  Next time I would add more of that, or more honey, as I would prefer it sweeter.  I had fresh basil so I used that instead of oregano.

Balsamic Glazed Salmon Fillets Haiku: "I'd give this 6 stars, if only I could do that, these were just THAT good." When buying a lovely piece of salmon, I usually lean towards a purist approach to a good hunk of fish - S&P, maybe a squirt of lemon juice, flick of olive oil, or sprinkle of dill, but I went w/ this recipe for a change. And I'm only realizing now (bonks-self-on-head) that I completely forgot the oregano on accident, but oh well - This.Was.De.Li.Cious. Followed the recipe (mine took more like 15 min. to flake easily, but in that time, I basted the fillets several more times w/ the glaze), and served w/ roasted acorn squash, green beans, and brown rice. I will most certainly put this on regular supper rotation!

This was fabulous.  My fish wasn't as fresh as I would have liked, but the flavor of the glaze was strong enough that the fish still tasted fabulous!  I plan on making this again soon!

I was really disappointed in this -- after all the great reviews, I was expecting to love it! The sauce added absolutely nothing to a great piece of salmon -- in fact, it detracted. We scraped off as much of it as we could.

Delicious! I make salmon once a week and had a craving for balsamic vinegar, so this was the perfect fit for an easy Monday night dinner. I omitted the white wine because I didn't have any open, but it was just fine without.

Think of this as an Italian glaze for salmon and you won't be surprised by the taste. I was hoping for something a little sweeter and the first bite kind of shocked me with the tartness but after a couple of bites, really started to like it. I think if you added just a touch more honey, it would work perfectly. Will actually make it again when I'm looking for something a little different.

The smell while cooking it wasnt too appealing but this was good.  My husband absolutely loved it!  Inhaled his entire plate and half of mine.  It wasnt my favorite, but still pretty good.  But that could probably just be because I'm not a huge fish person. We will be making this again.

I'm stymied as to why people thought the glaze smelled bad or why they thought it was too vinegary.  This was just perfect.  Loved it!  Made it as written, and I'll make it again with other fish/chicken/rice.  Thank you!

When reducing the balsamic vinegar , it did give out a strong smell. Didn't have a bottle of white wine open so substituted for beer, also didn't use the oregano and it turned out delicious.

We've never had white wine in this house when making this salmon recipe, but even with chicken broth this is an exceptional, company-worthy dish.  Edited to add: The white wine adds even more dimension to the taste of this salmon.  Highly recommend doubling the glaze, as it is delicious and you will want more!

This recipe is good, but not great.  If you are looking for a really awesome salmon recipe, I would suggest "starflower"'s Maple Salmon instead.  Even easier to prepare and much better flavour.  I only default to this one if there is no maple syrup handy.

Awesome recipe.  Everything in the glaze was stuff we had around the house.   I'm not a big fan of mustard in recipes, so used very little.  The glaze was incredibly easy to make and smelled awesome while cooking.  Next time I plan on trying some other herbs, like rosemary or basil.  Make sure to use the foil on the baking pan as it does make a sticky mess.  Hubby loved this!!!!!!!

Awesome glaze. I stress the word GLAZE!! It is not meant to be a marinade or a sauce to cook it in...simply brush it on two or three times while cooking. I think that may be the cause of some of the negatives or bad reviews. It might be too much for people if you are cooking this swimming in the stuff. We used it in a pinch for our cedar plank grilled salmon when I realized I had no soy sauce in the house!! Followed it exact except substituted 1 of the teaspoons of dijon with 1 teaspoon of french country seeded mustard. We grilled our salmon on a cedar plank with alder chips soaked and then put on the coals. We basted it with the sauce 3 times. Out of this world flavor combination! The smoked flavor  from the plank and chips went well with this glaze. Highly recommended.

I would have never thought of using balsamic vinegar on salmon but it was awesome! I used creamy dijon mustard instead of the regular stuff. I also added some fresh mushrooms to the glaze and sauteed it for a little longer than the recipe called for. I served it with angel hair pasta with a gorgonzola cream sauce and some green beans with almonds seasoned with lemon pepper! It was a perfect dish!

So easy, and turned out so moist!  Next time I will marinate it longer (I only did for 15 min.), but I liked the "light" flavor that complemented, rather than dominated, the wonderful salmon taste. Good recipe, thanks!

I made this with a few little changes. Only had 2 big salmon fillets, but made the same amount of glaze (I'm trusting). Didn't have wine, so I used extra honey and probably extra mustard, which was just coursely ground instead of the dijon. Dried oregano instead of fresh, and extra garlic. This came out FANTASTIC. I was worried about the vinegar but my boyfriend and mom were both amazed. Thank you for this recipe!!!

Definitely a keeper!  I knew I was on the right track when my daughter walked in while I was cooking and said, "Wow, that smells great."  We eat salmon frequently, so we're always looking for something new to do to it - I'm glad I found this one.

This is a very good simple recipe.  If you concentrate on the honey, you get an almost caramelized salmon.  I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey and honey dijon to sweeten the balsamic.  This produced a very sweet dish.  Watch the cooking  time for dry out.  Because of my cut I had to increase cooking and biast.  Very sweet and enjoyable product.  Thank you.

This was very good. Followed the ingredients exactly. Don't think it warranted any changes. Had to cook sauce about 10 min on stove top for it to thicken though. My husband told me I will definitely need to make this again. 
*** This does have a very strong vinager bite to it, we like this but if you usually don't, then you may not care for this recipe.

This is without a doubt the best new recipe I have tried in years. This is so incredibly delicious! Even my kids who always refuse to eat fish of any type both said it was "okay!" I cannot wait to make this again. In fact if we had any salmon in the house right now, I'm pretty sure I would make more right now. I am not much of a cook myself, but we eat out at least once a week. This salmon seriously is at least as good or better than any salmon I've ordered in a restaurant. It is so, so, so fantastic! (FYI - I did not have fresh oregano, but dried worked just fine.)

I thought this turned out great. It really is a pretty quick meal, and excellent. I think I will probably make more of the balsamic sauce next time. I LOVE balsamic vinegar!

Btw, I  cooked the salmon with the skin on underneath and served it this way. The meat comes right off the skin very easily when it's cooked. I think it helped keep the salmon moist.

This recipe was extremely easy! Super tasty and my boyfriend and I both cleared our plates without a drop left. I served this with rice and little torta breads with pesto spread. Was absolutely fantastic. 

I left the sauce on the stove longer than the directions said just because it didn't get as thick as I liked in the alotted time frame. Also I folded the corners up on the tinfoil in the pan so it was like a little bowl to keep the sauce off the pan - one less pan to clean :)

We eat salmon almost every week. This is hands down the best recipe I've had. Along with great salmon to begin with (copper river salmon from Alaska), I added crushed pecans to the top of the glaze...delicious.

This recipe is quick, simple and very tasty. I follow a low-carb regiment, so I always modify recipes to fit my diet.  So when I made this, I doubled the marinade and substituted one dropper-full of vanilla liquid stevia for the honey.  The taste was awesome and there was no bitter after taste from the stevia.  My side dish was Garlic Parmesan Roasted Asparagus.  That made for a good, healthy, low-carb Monday meal.

I tried this on a whole salmon filet. I followed the recpie exactly and it was amazing! Only thing I changed was the cook time to ensure my filet was cooked through. I servied it with asparagus and curry rice. My guests loved it and kept going back for more! I will definately make this again! Gives such a wonderful flavor without being over-powering.

Husband said give it a five so here it is.  I cut a 2 lb salmon steak into 4 serving pieces.  Baked closer to 14 minutes since they were still a bit frozen in the center.  Other than that didn't change a thing.  Came out perfectly.

What a wonderful recipe, thank you! We would've eaten this reduction/glaze with a spoon, all on it's own!  Glad I doubled the glaze recipe, as we love extra sauce.  Substituted 3/4 cup pineapple juice for the honey (as it was leftover from a can of pineapple I was using in another recipe) and omitted the mustard (in fear it wouldn't work well with the pineapple).  Added red onion (one medium red onion, sliced in rings) when sautéing garlic.  Did a final drizzle with the reduction, and then broiled the salmon the last two minutes, to get a beautiful glaze.  Served with "Asparagus and Water Chesnuts" as submitted by CATJENKINS (The asparagus also relied on balsamic, so figured it was a go-to compliment for the salmon.)  Both great recipes. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe, BUT do not brush glaze you put over raw fish on the cooked fish unless you've boiled it for at least 2 minutes.

This was so easy and tasted great. I may change up the cooking time/temp, because my salmon came out a bit dry. Will make again!

This sounds good and looks good when you prepare it, but the glaze does nothing for the taste. I'm going back to my regular brown sugar, lemon juice and mustard glaze.

This was a really good glaze!  I sauteed some cherry tomatos, shaved zucchini, and onion in the same pan that I made the glaze in and put it on top of the salmon (after it was cooked).  I had a thick piece of salmon and it definitely needed longer cooking time.

I made this tonight and thought it was a nice alternative to the other ways I've prepared salmon. I made a few slight changes using stone ground mustard instead of Dijon because its what I had open, blue agave honey, a pinch of red pepper flakes to ensure the flavor we like, and a pinch of corn starch to get the thickness needed to keep the glaze from running of the fish during the baking process. The flavor of the glaze was great and the flavor of the fish was still prominent but there was something a little off for me and I think it was that I felt like I should have grilled the salmon. With the honey and balsamic, it would have created a caramelized coating to the fish that would have been out of this world.  By baking it there was an abundance of residual juices that melded with the glaze and did not improve the quality of the final product though I had no complaints except from a six year old who would eat nothing but peaches and ice cream if he had his way so he doesn't count  :) I will definitely make it again but next time I'll grill it and let the fire do its magic. I think that would have made it a five star recipe, at least in my book.

This was delicious!  I didn't have the wine, so I substituted chicken broth.  It turned out very nice, and I thought that it was very aromatic.  It had a lovely savory flavor.

a little on the sweet side.  i think a good addition to this recipe (if someone could figure it out) would be some kind of chili sauce to spice it up a little.  but baked salmon is always juicy and wonderful :)

I followed the recipe as it was written. Instead of brushing, i poured the glazed on top of the fish and shoved it in the oven. The night i made it, i thought it was just okay, when i had it on top of my salad the next day, i liked it a lot.  I think the flavors blend into the fish overnight. I'd make this again if I knew I was having salad the next day.

This was very good. I used a really good quality balsamic vinegar (you could drink this stuff it is so good) and that may have made it better. All the flavors blended nicely. And you can marinate salmon for up to 8 hours safely. However, unlike meat, fish absorbs flavors faster and does not require as much time to marinate. So 30 to 60 minutes is ideal.

Ok...I agree with some of the others that the glaze does NOT smell good while cooking.  However, once baked onto the salmon...this is WONDERFUL!!!  My family loved this dish!!!  I will certainly be making it again and again.  Thanks!!!!

We decided to grill this, and just continuously baste the salmon while grilling.  It could have been marinated for a bit, but it was just fine without it.  The taste of the salmon still came through and was not overpowered by the glaze.  Very good!!!

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. I forgot to add the oregano at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The salmon was really moist and the sauce was excellent. Will make again.

WOW!!  Talk about easy and DELICIOUS!!  I basically am more of a fish & vegetable eater.  I usually make Salmon Patties or Croquettes.  This will be another great way to do my "usual" salmon.  Ruth Anne

followed the receipe as written.  It was so good and Easy.  I only made 2 salmon fillets and the full amount of sauce.  I would doulbe the sauce receipe if I were making 6 as the original receipe called for.  I had the perfect amount of sauce with a little left over for 2 salmon fillets.  I really don't see how that would be enough for 6.

So as a person that does night like mustard very much, i substitute worcestershire and a little maple syrup, also instead of white wine, I use a white wine vinegar....it turns out phenomenal.

I am trying to eat healther but I am not a fish fan. My neighbor gave us some salmon he caught so I felt I had to eat it. I thought I could cover up the taste of the fish a little to make it easier to eat. This glaze was perfect. It was a great balance. I will be making this again. Thank you for posting it.

I loved this recipe. Unfortunately they didn't have fresh oregano at the market so I had to substitute dried, but thought it was delicious. It was my first time making a glaze and I didn't realize how easy it is. Definitely a keeper

I should of trusted my instinct. When you prepare the sauce and you are thinking "this stuff smells strong and overpowering"..that's your cue to quit preparing the recipe and make something else.

I live in Japan part of the year so I eat a lot of fish and salmon is probably my favorite fish.  This glaze was way too overpowering for salmon.  Salmon has a lot of oils in it, imparting a wonderful and distinct flavor, and this glave just masked those natural flavors for which salmon is so appreciated.  this glaze might work well with a blander white fish.  Other than raw, my favorite way to eat salmon is a recipe on this site called "Grilled Cedar-Planked Salmon."  Try that one.  It's fabulous.

I hate to put a negative post on here, but the galze smelled so awful while preparing it that we did not even try it on the salmon.  Instead, I just squeezed some lemon on the fish and basted with olive oil and a little basil.

This was terrific and really easy to make.  The smell was a bit funky at first when heating the balsamic but the taste was well worth it.  My daughter ate the leftovers the next day quite happily.  Will make this again and again.

made this recipe as is minus oregano (don't care for it) and we enjoyed it as an alternative to the usual.  I don't think the vinegar was overpowering as some reviewers complain, but I had some stronger tasting salmon filets this time than they usually are.  Tasty, but I might not make again. Nothing "wow"ing.

I read that others thought this didn't smell good while it was cooking. I sort of know what they mean, but when you reduce the glaze, it gets really thick and syrupy and concentrated so maybe that's why. But when you glaze the salmon and then bake it, it's truly amazing. My entire family loved it and now they call this recipe "Slammin" instead of "Salmon". I have made several salmon recipes on this site, but keep coming back to this one. Try it!!

Great recipe!  I marinated the salmon for about 20 minutes before baking.  It only took about 10 minutes to cook, any longer and it would have been dry.  B/f loved it so much he went back for seconds and thirds : )  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wasn't a huge fan of this recipe.  While it was a cinch to make, in the end, the overpowering balsamic flavour made it taste like I poured salad dressing over the salmon...and I love balsamic.  I guess I favour a more sweeter teriyaki-type of glaze with my fish.

This was good, but not great. I think the salmon would benefit from an overnight soak in the marinade.

Not that impressed.  We love the taste of good wild salmon but we thought that this galze covered the taste of the salmon instead on complimenting it.  Maybe this would be good on something like Chicken Breasts, but not on King fillets.  Will not make again.

This was beautiful. I followed the recipe to a T accept for scaling it down for 2. My only tip would be to make sure you keep the heat down low to reduce. Great!

I took others advise and cut down on the balsamic.  I used 3T of wine, 2T of honey, 1/4C of balsamic, 2t of yellow mustard b/c I didn't have dijon.  I marinaded 3 salmon filets w/ a little of bit of "Allegro" (marinade I bought from the store) and half of the balsamic glaze for 3 hrs.  I grilled the salmon then topped it with the rest of the balsamic glazed.  Served it w/ coconut rice & veggies.  My family and I enjoyed it. It had a great flavor that wasn't too overpowering.  I will definitely make it again. 

I made this recipe again...followed it exactly and it was so so.  My son mentioned that the flavor was too strong...

This was good, not great.  I normally love balsamic flavor, but it just wasn't great with the salmon.  Perhaps I just prefer a soy or lemon flavor with my salmon.  It was definitely worth a try, though.

This recipes was EASY and really really good. My mom hates salmon but actually enjoyed this one! The honey definitely adds a subtle sweetness to this dish. I also recommend doubling up on the sauce...

When I received this recipe by email I had already planned to make salmon the next day so it was a perfect match !
As other reviewers, I was a bit concerned about the amount of balsamic vinegar + mustard but the combination of acidity and sweetness of this sauce is well balanced.
We had a thick, dark and tangy sauce contrasting with the buttery flavour of the salmon, plus it is easy and quick to prepare. This recipe is a keeper !!!
Many thanks ISYBEL ;o)

DEEELICIOUS!!!! I grilled the salmon and made extra sauce. This recipe is great with the "Bundles of Veggies" recipe on the grill. I made it into one dish, mashed potatoes on the bottom, then the veggies top with the salmon. AMAZING! Better than a restaurant and super healthy!

This recipe was not as tasty as I would have expected. I must've done something wrong considering the other reviews.

The balsamic vinager was so over powering when I mixed the sauce I couldn't even use it.Instead I went with some lemon, garlic, and oregano. I smelt balsamic vinager for days! Blah

Because the major complaint I saw in the reviews was "too much vinegar!", I cut it down to 1/4 cup.  I also cut the mustard down to 1 teaspoon, because I don't really like it, and because I could already taste it in the glaze after just one. The result - waaaaaaaaaaay too sweet, with more of a honey-mustard flavor than any noticible balsamic at all. It's not bad, but if I make it again I'm going to have to change the ratios significantly - far less honey, far more vinegar. Definitely not a spectacular dish. (I also did not use oregano - I don't think it would have helped.)

This was pretty easy to make. I think I used too much mustard (I eyeball everything), but I liked how it thickened and stuck to the salmon. It was very simple and used ingredients I already have. Will try again!

This was pretty good. For whatever reason, the glaze didn't permeate that far into the salmon-- but we did salmon steaks, so that might have had something to do with it. Skipped the wine because we didn't have any, but otherwise kept it about the same. It's true, the balsamic vinegar does smell really, really strong while simmering, but the end flavor is not like that smell!

Delicious!  I didn't have white wine, so I substituted chicken broth.  But, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The salmon came out perfect.  Will definately make this again!  Thanks!!

I was not impressed.  I love salmon, but the smell of this glaze was a bit overwhelming to enjoy.  It's okay if you are looking for a sugary marinade- was way too sweet for me.

Very flavorful!  If you are using skinless salmon, I'd suggest using a piece of parchment paper underneath the salmon.  A clean brown paper bag will work in a pinch!

Great recipe. It was warm in our house, and I really didn't feel like turning on the oven, so I did the entire thing on the stove top. I made the glaze first, then put the salmon in to cook. Since I did that, I had to watch it very carefully, because the glaze can easily burn. When it got too thick, I added water so that it wouldn't burn. That worked great, and it seemed to infuse the flavor of the glaze right through the salmon. My hubby loved it, and I'll definately be making this again.

This was perfect. The glaze stayed on top of the salmon, and didn't roll off like some thinner glazes tend to do. 

The extras kept well in the fridge for the next day's lunch as well.

I didn't have Dijon mustard so used Scottish Crofters (wholegrain) and when it went in the oven, I thought OMG it looks terrible and my hubbie's going to hate it.  Yet the end product looked much nicer than I expected, and the taste is absolutely superb.  It's not a strong taste, but rather sweet and ironically you would hardly know the mustard's there.  Following on from previous reviewers, I think this would be a nice marinade for other meats.  And as I still have some white wine left, as being red wine drinkers we don't normally have it in the house and I had to buy a 250 cl bottle specially, I think I'll try it with Pork Loin tomorrow. 

Thank you for this recipe, it's definitely a keeper and I would never even have dreamt of putting such strong flavours with Salmon, yet it works perfectly.

Very well received. I used Emeril's Italian Essence in addition to fresh oregano, and I thought it benefited quite a bit from the extra flavor. Thanks, ISYBEL.

This is a very nice, easy and unique recipe. But I do think the sauce is a bit too vinagery. Next time I'll add more honey and wine, or perhaps a little apple juice. Also, I made almost double the amount of sauce, to use some for dipping. I definately recommend that, especially if you have a thick peice of fish.

Great recipe  IF using  exceptionally good balsamic vinegar.  I placed salmon on a bed of spinach and drizzled both with glaze; let sit 20 min.  Cooked 10 mins then drizzled remaining glaze on fish and spinach then cooked 10 more mins. or  till done.

Excellent recipe.  My girls loved it as did I. Only thing I changed was that I used  white cooking wine. Couldn’t see opening an entire bottle regular white wine for such a small amount. I served this fish on Allrecipes Parmesan Basil Orzo. Perfect pairing.

Fantastic recipe!  Tried it with a large wild Alaskan salmon fillet and it turned out great.  We accidentally cooked the ingredients that needed to be done on the stove top all at once and it still turned out great.  We did not bake it in the oven with foil as we do not use foil for cooking (it is really unhealthy).  We baked it in a glass pyrex dish.  Will happily make again!

No changes.  Made it exactly according to the recipe.  We eat salmon (fixed deliciously but always the same) often.  My husband said this was the best he'd ever eaten including his own grilled version.  I loved it.  It was SO EASY  .  I used cheap white wine and excellent vinegar.  Was superb!

My husband loves this dish and fish is not among his favorite foods.  I doubled the sauce and will triple it when I make it again.  i followed the recipe except that I was out of Dijon mustard and had to substitute a smokey brown mustard..  I look forward to trying it with the Dijon just to see what kind of difference it makes.  This recipe was well written and easy to follow.  it's fast and easy enough to make a great work night dinner and elegant enough (served with a good pilaf and some steamed, buttered asparagus) to impress discerning dinner guests,  Yep...it's a good one.

So yummy!  I think I over-reduced the glaze, but it worked out okay.  I just slathered it on my filets and baked.  The glaze was so thick there was no need to re-baste when it came out of the oven.  Next time I will be sure not to reduce it as much.  Watch your fish carefully so as not to overcook.  My filets only needed to bake about 10 minutes.  I topped it with fresh basil instead of oregano because that's what I had on hand.  We liked it so much I think I'll stick with that substitution. Very quick, very tasty and a hit with my family.

Balsamic flavor way too heavy. Maybe I didn't reduce it enough. Who knows, but won't make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and used the sauce for only 3 salmon fillets. It tasted nice and hubby liked. Next time I think I will add more honey for a sweeter taste, it was quite vinegary.

So delicious! I usually serve this over a bed of wilted spinach. The spinach soaks up the flavors from the wonderful glaze / sauce.

Made this today for lunch, following the recipe for glaze to a "T"..however i did simmer longer than 3 minutes, that didn't seem to thicken it much...also, I did double the batch, my daughter doesn't like salmon, so I will use it on chicken breasts for her for dinner. 

I went a little light on the oregano, seemed like an overpowering herb for salmon. While the salmon was baking, I continued to simmer the glaze to thicken it even more. 

My husband enjoyed it and said it was a keeper. I also liked it, but next time I will double the amount of honey, just to see how it is.

Tasty, easy to make marinade. Everyone loved this recipe, but I would reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar and add more wine. It was a little thick after 3 min of simmering. Overall I recommend!

Loved the flavor. Doubled the glaze. Didn't have fresh Oregano so used 1/2 the amount of dried oregano and it was totally fine. I did happen to have to have fresh basil so sprinkled that on as a garnish. Also, 15 minutes dried out the fillets a little so I would probably go 10-12 minutes next time. Roasted some sweet potatoes on the side and the contrast of sweet with tart was perfect.

I got a similar recipe from another site that I like - the proportions were a little different (less garlic, a little more of the wine, vinegar, and honey)and it uses fresh rosemary instead of oregano.  Try it with rosemary added to the sauce and sprinkled on top - very good!

This recipe was really good!  I'm not much of a fish lover but I've been trying to cook it more and more for my husband and son.  They both LOVED this recipe.  I liked how quick and easy the recipe was for a weeknight!  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Very easy. We all have these ingredients on hand so it's perfect for when the salmon looks good at the store! I let the salmon marinade for 20-25 minutes. I didn't have any white wine so I left it out and I eyeballed the other ingredients. I doubled the honey due to preference. Served it with sautéed veggies for a healthy midweek dinner!

I just made this recipe and loved it!!  Per another members suggestion, I added grated fresh ginger. Awesome!  The glaze is perfect. Consistency and flavor are both very satisfying.  I served the fillets with black pearl rice, sautéed kale with garlic, and a chopped salad with arugula, toasted almonds, dried cranberries, red cabbage and and balsamic vinaigrette.  Sauvignon Blanc pairing. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Brilliant!
Everyone raved about this meal!  Make this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I took the remaining glaze and suatéed some mushrooms and a bell pepper. They soaked up the sweet flavor very well.  The salmon turns out very well despite the vinegar smell at first.  I still prefer lemon salmon, but this is a nice change of pace.  It was very easy to prepare.

This is the BEST salmon I've had in a long while! From prep to to oven, dinner was on the table in just under 30 minutes (hooray!)!!! I even had time to prepare a couple of quick sides! A bottle of our favorite wine made this a very special meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe Isybel! My hubs wants me to make this again next week! :-)

Our Famly loved this dish as stated.  I used fresh wild sockey salmon fillets. My daughter said best fish she ever had. I served it with sautéed spinach, pine nuts, shallots and potatos and a salad.

Yum yum YUMMY!!!!!  added a bit more honey for fear the balsamic may be to strong (I love it strong but family wouldn't like it) everyone loved it!!! I added slices of fresh ginger to the simmering pot and garlic powder.  Oh ya used apple juice in place of white wine =)  but I did forget to sprinkle the oregano on it, just sprinkled the fish with pepper and salt before basting it on.

Great taste.  Never though mustard and balsamic vinegar would go good together.

Just made this tonight.  It was eaten so quickly, there was no time for a photo!  So simple and quick for a busy weeknight.  I substituted rice vinegar because I had no white wine and used dry oregano since I didn't have fresh.  I also added dry ginger to the glaze.  I used frozen salmon fish fillets which we always have on hand so cooking time was less than 10 minutes.  I served it over a bed of greens with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and mixed veggies (the frozen-steam in bag variety).  Definitely putting this one in our rotation.

This was very tastey.  I made the glaze as written, but used dry dill rather than oregano as one of the reviewers had suggested.  Only had two pieces of frozen salmon (12 oz), so I made the glaze for the 6 serving directed.  I'll just save the extra glaze for the other pkg. I have in the freezer.  Will make this again.

This salmon was great! It had a nice, sweet flavor that my whole family enjoyed. I used half regular mustard and half spicy brown mustard. I also used dried oregano but used less. Thanks for the quick, healthy, and tasty recipe!

I just made this tonight for dinner. It was great I will make it again. I did not pre-thicken the sauce and it still turned out great. And I used maple syrup instead of honey.

This was an easy and  flavorful treatment for a salmon filet.  I'll make it again!  I used double the white wine and put dried oregano in the glaze.  And I didn't add any salt and pepper.

We give this very good reviews for taste.   I agree that we needed more sauce so that is what I will do next time.  I am still trying to find a way to make a crisp edge on salmon.

Hubby said he liked it enough, but the vinegar/fish combination reminded me too much of pickled herring.  My balsamic vinegar isn't the super expensive stuff, but I'm not convinced that made a huge difference.

Fantastic! It even got a thumbs up from my son who does not care for fish! I didn't have wine on hand and turns out I didn't have Dijon either. I used water and then used some spicy brown mustard. I had to add more honey to balance the spicy brown. Great and easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Did not like flavor of mixture, because it was a bit tingy & salty for my taste and I did not add salt; but after adding sugar & corn syrup to mixture, it came out great!! I also sprinkled some brown sugar on salmon after pouring mixture over it. I saw no need in boiling mixture prior to pouring on salmon, so I just allowed mixture to cook right along w/the salmon. I had the mixture to marinade on salmon in refrigerator for a few hours prior to cooking. I probably will not do this recipe that often.

My husband LOVED this. I omitted the white wine because I didn't have any and it was fine. I might have cooked it too long on the stove because it was VERY thick when I went to pour it on the salmon. It still tasted great though. Served with a side of roasted asparagus cooked at the same temp with the salmon! Perfect.

I really like this.  I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used dried.  I serve it with some green beans or asparagus and some fingerling potatoes cut in half and tossed in some kosher salt, pepper, olive oil, and dried rosemary and baked for about 40-50 min.  It makes a pretty healthy meal.

This recipe turned out very well!  The glaze was very tasty and the salmon was so moist.    I found that I needed to cook my salmon for a bit longer than the recipe states (maybe + 5 minutes).  I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe! I only had two fillets and still used the same amount the recipe called for and I thought it was the right amount. I used about a teaspoon of olive oil to saute the garlic...thought it added a nice flavor. I didn't have fresh oregano so sprinkled the fillets with dry and it worked fine. I made a asparagus and lemon pasta (own recipe) to go as a side....perfect compliment. Our impromptu guests could not stop raving about the salmon flavor! This will be a keeper.

I thought this was really good. I omitted the white wine because we never have it on hand (red wine lovers here).  I am not a huge salmon fan but I ate mine all up with this glaze on it!

This recipe worked perfectly. I like balsamic, my hubby doesn't. He likes salmon, I don't.  This recipe was a nice combo and we both loved it. I did add a little extra honey to help cut the vinegar more, it came out with an almost teriyaki flavor. The fish was moist, meaty, and perfectly cooked.

I made this recipe as-is other than omitting the fresh oregano, as I did not have any in the house.  The marinade did smell odd while heating/blending, but I ignored it as per other reviews.  The final product was, in my personal estimation, just okay.  The flavor was a little sweet for my liking, although it did permeate the fish well and the marinade cooked to a nice-looking glaze on the exterior of the fillet.  I used a single fillet of almost a pound, so it took longer to cook (20-25 minutes.).    Thanks for the post, I'm always searching for that perfect recipe that will make my boyfriend love salmon as much as I do, this just wasn't quite it!

Awesome! I mix all the ingredients minus the white wine. I do not heat the sauce in the beginning. I use it as a marinade for the fish. After letting the fish marinate for 5 hours I cook bake in the oven for 11 minutes at 400 degrees. I then heat the marinated and use it as pasta sauce. When the salmon is done baking I serve it over whole wheat pasta and top with the sauce. So GOOD!

Excellent! Easy to modify too. (Didn't have whit wine) and added fresh dill to the top. Also use 8 oz pieces of salmon and baked for 17 mins and they came out perfect. Make sure to let the fish marinate in the sauce for 5 - 10 mins!

This was really good! I kept all the measurements the same and had enough to coat 2 pieces of salmon. I do like a lot of extra glaze though. It was very simple and I will definitely be making this again!

TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!! It was so good that I had to review right after dinner. I paired it up with sweet potato and butternut squash mash, and sweet baby broccoli. So good that all of my 4 boys ate it up. Yum!

SO GOOD! I don't really like balsalmic dressing so I was hesitant, but I gave it a shot and am SO glad! I didn't have any honey (I know, who runs out of that?!) so I just added a little bit of sugar, and it still came out great! Will definitely make again.

Easy, and very tasty. I guesstimated at the amounts of ingredients, but for sure used much more wine, probably 1/4 cup.  I marinated the salmon for about 30 min, then broiled...and I still didn't get that nice looking glaze like the picture indicates...oh well, the taste was there.  Don't taste the sauce and make adjustments due to too much vinegar! It will be fine, cooking vinegar always gives off a pungent odour. After marinading I re-heated the remaining sauce for those who wanted to add extra after the salmon was cooked.  Served with brussell sprouts and mashed potatoes, will definitely use this recipe again!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly as written. Don't try to smell the balsamic mixture when cooking it - I almost gagged. But after baking it tasted fantastic! Will definitely make it again! I served it with brussel sprouts and long grain brown rice.

I made the recipe as written then tasted the sauce just before brushing it on my salmon fillets. It was HORRIBLE!!! Thankfully I went against my better judegment and proceeded with preparing the meal. Something magical happened in my oven because this dish was DELICIOUS. I served it with rice & Hericot Vert. YUMMY :)

I'm giving this 2 stars.  The timing for the salmon was outsatanding. The sauce for the salmon had way too much balsamic vinegar. Someone suggested to taste it before applying it to the fish. Thank goodnees I did because it tasted like I made a pot of vinegar. I won't make this again because it took much time trying to make the sauce edible.

This was not at all good for me. I won't make again. This does not reduce to a "glaze" and the flavor was really off for me, just not a good flavor profile with this combination of ingredients.

Absolutely wonderful flavor!  I was actually just trying to use up some salmon I had, but now I'm going to buy more!!!  I was a little worried about the ingredients, but it turned out amazing!!  Followed directions exactly (except I only had 2 fillets).

The glaze is very tasty. I didn't feel that it was too sweet like some others said, but it's probably just a personal preference thing. Very good and VERY easy with ingredients I had on hand. I'm sure I'll make it again some time.

This was the very best glaze I have ever had for salmon. My husband really doesn't care for most fish but has endured ever time I have served it. Last night the only thing I added on my own was crushed red pepper since he likes his food spicy. He exclaimed that he would eat this anytime! Definitely going into our dinner rotation!

This is scrumptious.  My husband hates any type of seafood and he scarfed this down!  I doubled the sauce the second time around, because it was so yummy and everyone wished they had a little more the first time I made it.

I made this recipe a month ago. It is a keeper. I did not have plain balsamic vinegar so I used Balsamic Cream Vinegar which gave it a richer taste.   My husband devoured it. We are having it again tonight and my husband ran out last night to get the salmon since there is a blizzard predicted for our area today. I will serve it with mixed veggies.   Thank you Isybel for a great recipe.

It is now march 31 and I am making it again, doubling the sauce and using basil instead of oregano. But I added something else to the recipe. I added about a TBS of curry. It tastes so good with that little change. I still used the Balsamic Cream Vinegar which is a little pricey but the flavor can't be beat.

This recipe had lots of flavor but was a little sweet for me and my family.  i might try it again without the honey and broiling or pan frying it at the end to get a nice crisp balsamic glaze.

This was great! I have to admit the vinegar sauce takes your breathe away when cooking it but the finished product is fanstastic! I served it over a rice pilaf and it made a wonderful dinner.  I also made it just as the recipe states and didn't change a thing.

I liked the glaze a lot,  the only thing I didn't enjoy thoroughly was the fresh oregano.  I thought the amount of it was a little overwhelming but that is just a personal opinion.  I simply love how the brown sugar and balsamic thicken and almost stick to the fish

This is an excellent receipe. However you need much more sauce then called for. I would double it next time.

This was a really easy flavorful sauce and perfectly suited the salmon.  I used a whole salmon fillet, 1.5 lbs, and followed the recipe exactly.  Just the right amount of glaze to not overwhelm the salmon.  Excellent!  My 7 year old wanted seconds! Great recipe.  Thanks!

I feel like this recipe was changed recently. When I first made this, I wrote down the recipe as using 2 Tbsp of Balsamic Vinegar. It turned out fabulously! I tried it recently with the 1/3 cup of vinegar and it was just AWFUL. 2 tbsp is definately the way to go!

It was a nice sauce -very easy to make. We served the salmon with avocado that had been cut up and mixed with lemon juice. It was a nice combination.

I made this for dinner for my family tonight and we all liked it a lot.  It's got to be good when the 2 and 4 year old kids ask for seconds.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to the wine - I used 1 tsp of white wine vinegar and added 1 Tbsp of water to off-set the vinegar.  I also added about 2 Tbsp of honey instead of 1.  I served this with "Brazilian White Rice" from this site along with the salmon - the end result was delicious.

This was really good and tasty! I did use extra white wine since we both love the added flavor. I have used this recipe twice and am excited to use it again! We always buy the wild Alaskan salmon...tastes best to us.

This turned out better than I expected. I admit that the sauce did not smell too well while cooking but made a great addition to the salmon once baked. The last time I cooked it, I didn't have honey so I substituted it with brown sugar. The brown sugar gave the fish a crust that was great!

The sauce is awesome!  My boyfriend walked in and asked "what's that smell?" in not the most flattering way; however, I kept cooking.  He royally enjoyed the meal. If I had to do it all over again, i would cook the fish last and prepare the rice and veggies first so the fish wouldn't dry out.

This was a FANTASTIC dish! I used 2 teaspoons of prepared mustard instead of the 4 teaspoons of the Dijon mustard, I didn't have it.  My family likes sweet instead of spicy.. Personally I was ready to have cereal for dinner, as a person who DOES NOT like fish at all, I really enjoyed this! I would make this again in a heartbeat! I am putting this in my "internet cookbook" to make again!

This is one of the best recipes for any food I have ever made.  But be warned, making the glaze is hard on the nose and spreads everywhere.  Not really for a hotel, but I do it anyways =D  The potent smell calms down tons after you bake the fish

I couldn't access the recipe on the night I had decided to make this so I had to wing it and go from what I remembered about the ingredients! I ended up coming VERY close to the original, except I added tamari and a teaspoon or so liquid smoke. Holy Cow did my family rave! I will definitely make this again...I'm so glad I wrote down the "new and improved" version; that's what I'll use!

Yumm!  Salmon is one of my favorite fish, so I am always looking for a way to make it more appealing to my husband ( who is less of a fan ) This Glaze was very easy and not too sweet.  A nice change from the standard Lemon and Herbs that I often use. Lining the pan with foil is an excellent idea, making clean-up a snap.  My Husband even gave it a 5 star rating! *grin*

I added liquid smoke to the glaze. Good basic recipie, I also use non stick foil. HINT: since I use a lot of non stick foil, (just like OIL,) it can be reused. I for this I use the reused saved foil, then discard.

I followed the recipe as written and my husband and 2 small children loved it!  I, personally, didn't care for it much, though, which is really a surprise, since they are all a little picky and I'm not.  I guess it's just that I don't feel there was enough sauce for the fish.  I probably will try this again and just make sure I double the sauce.

I love salmon, and I was anxious to try a new recipe, but I was disappointed with this one.  The sauce was really strong, overpowering the mild salmon flavor, and my kitchen didn't smell so good afterward.  I'll have to keep looking for other salmon recipes.

Fantastic! I didn't have white wine and substituted sugar and dry mustard for the dijon. I didn't marinate it at all and it was delicious.

Very tasty!! My husband who does not like fresh salmon actually said he didn't mind it at all.  The sauce took away the fishy taste and was super easy to prepare. Im preparing this for the next family gathering...thanks for the recipe.

Simple, straightforward, DELICIOUS recipe!  My only changes are to add some ginger to the sauce, and increase the amount of sauce by about 30%.  Served over coconut milk rice and you've got yourself a winner!

This is definately a keeper.  I followed the directions to the T but instead of salmon I used lake trout since we just a caught a bunch.  My guest/family raved about the meal.  I served the trout with smoked salmon (trout) tortellini with bechamel sauce and a bottle of pinot noir.  What a meal!! By no means was the fish dry mine was mouth watering.  Thanks for the recipe will use again.

wonderful.  I have been making this for quite a while.  Always a hit.  I use apple juice instead of wine, and add a bit more honey.  I often times use Mahi for this glaze, perfect!!

Yes, do not marinate.  The vinegar will cook the fish!!!

I'm not sure why, but the fish was dry & tasteless. I used 2 different recipes for the same fish tonight & cooked them at the same time in the oven. The other recipe I used was the maple salmon, which in direct contrast was delicious & moist. I will not try the balsamic-glazed recipe again for salmon.

This recipe was just ok for me. The balsamic vinegar overpowered the salmon. The weird smell of the glazed lingered in the house after cooking this salmon. I don't think I will be making this again.

This is probably one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had. I took a tip from another review and added some ginger and crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce, and omitted the wine (because I didn't have any on hand). I served it with couscous prepared in vegetable broth and roasted asparagus. My husband, who claims he's not a big fan of salmon, went back for seconds.

I should have made more of this because the whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe except for the white wine.  I didn't have any but it was delicious without it.  I will definately make this again!!!

When I cooked this, I was lazy and didn’t measure the ingredients.  The dish had a good flavor, but it was a little on the vinegary side (my fault, of course).  I’m sure that when made correctly, this recipe yields fabulous results.  The glaze made for a wonderful change from the typical lemon-butter recipe.  I will absolutely make this again, but next time exercise a little more caution when adding ingredients.  :)  “Eyeing” measurements is often okay, but I wouldn’t readily recommend guessing when it comes to ingredients that can impart a strong taste when added in excess!

Really good recipe! Loved the balsamic glaze. Served with long grain rice, and sauteed spinach with garlic, and it was absolutly delicious! Wouldn't change a thing, and I will definitely be making this dish again and again.  And I love that it is so healthy! I found it quick and easy to prepare, and it looked beautiful when served.

This recipe is very easy to make and is absolutely delicious.  I like to bake or grill the salmon, basting the fish a few times while it is cooking.  I serve it over an arugula salad with cooked carrots or with steamed broccoli and rice.

Delicious!  However, I modified this recipe as I didn't have dijon mustard or white wine.  I substituted the white wine for grand marnier, and I also sprinkled the fish with brown sugar, put a little on bottom to carmelize and crust up, as well as added salmon seasoning! Delicious!

This was a delicious recipe. I followed it exactly, and I liked it, but the vinegar was just a tad bit over powering. So, the next time I will cut back on it just a tad. I will be making this regularly. Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent flavor!  I used same ingredients; however, I did not put this in the oven -- I did this in the skillet.  I mixed all ingredients together and poured over the salmon in the skillet (on medium heat) and just cooked it for 10 minutes or so turning it over.  The glaze was great and delicious!  thank you!

all i can say is WOW!. This came out great! however when your mixing the ingredients on the stove top it will smell very bad and you will be tempted to scrap the whole project,  but dont!. Trust me keep pushing through and continue with the recipe. You wont be sorry. Just make sure you use fresh salmon.

May be the best salmon I've tasted. I also have what I consider a fanatical fan of salmon that visits the house often, let's just say I didn't want to get near his plate when he was eating. This is really a great salmon recipe...nothing needs to be modified here.

This dish was awesom and a huge hit with my whole family.  I made extra sauce to glaze over the salmon and it was all gone.  It has a tangy yet sweet flavor that complimented the salmon well.  Plus, it's so easy and quick to make.  Perfect for a weeknight when you don't have too much time to cook.

This is great. We used fresh caught salmon which was a bit thicker a fillet than you usually can get in the store. It took mine almost 25 minutes at 400 degrees to cook fully. The sauce was easy and scrumptious.
P.S. To the person who claimed their sauce stunk up their house- what did you do wrong! Ha ha! Mine smelled wonderful!

Wow!  I loved this dish.  I am a huge fan of salmon and am always looking for new ways to make it and this has to be my current favorite!!  There is not a lot of ingredients and it is easy to prepare.  My only change was using dried oregano and not fresh since I didn't have fresh.  I will definitely make this again.  This is also a dish that I would feel comfortable making for guests.

This was awful.  I love salmon and I love new recipes.  My parents were over for dinner and they didn't like it either.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I have two left over pieces of salmon and I don't want to eat them because I didn't like the flavor at all.  Just had hoped for so much more.   Ugh, I will NEVER make this again.

Really really good. I crave salmon and am always looking for new ways to serve it. This is it! Didn't change a thing. I won't change a thing next time either except maybe to double the recipe.

This was a nice change from our usual salmon with the brown sugar/white wine/lemon juice. Very good.

I was looking forward to trying this recipe, but was disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the exact directions.  It was a bit too harsh...the balsamic vinager was overpowering--even though it was only a glaze...and other than the overpowering vinager taste, the glaze was quite bland.  Maybe with less balsamic vinager it would be better, but I don't plan on making this again.

This is equally good baked in the oven or done on a cedar plank on the grill!  Adds to the delicate flavor of the salmon instead of overpowering it as some marinades or glazes do. I roast new potatoes and asparagus along with it for a quick and delicious meal.  A Pinot Noir is a perfect pairing with this.

I thought the flavors were a good idea for this recipe but wasn't so into the wine and oregano. Imade a couple of adjustments: Sauted minced garlic and scallions in a bit of olive oil, then added balsamic vinegar, honey, salt and pepper and cooked for a minute until it thickened. I poured it over the salmon fillet and baked it in the oven, then finished it off under the broiler for a minute so it got crispy on the top. Yum!

I had gotten off work late last night and needed to rush home and cook dinner.  The only thing we had thawed and fresh was 2 pounds of shrimp.  So i hit the site for Balsamic glaze and found this, and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!  Like some of the other viewers the smell at first was not that enjoyable, but after finished we decided to use it on everything.

I have really gotten into plank grilling over the last year and planked this recipe after soaking the boards in a mix of water and apple juice all day. The "apple smoke" added a fruity taste that even my daughter remarked about. I've planked grilled with a citrus-based recipe and sometimes it's overbearing. But this combination worked great. Will definately do this one again!

Pretty good. The sauce thickened very quickly and became hard to spread, even on a low heat- next time, I would mix the liquids before putting them in the pan. I also liked the addition of lemon juice after it was done in the oven.

My husband and I cook salmon alot during the warm months on the grill, but I was looking for a different recipe...and voila!! This was it. I wasn't sure of the soy sauce in the recipe and how it would compliment the fish, but I tried this, just eyeballing the ingredients (I hardly ever measure anymore!!) and used every ingredient listed. I had to bake it about 5 - 8 minutes longer than stated, but that was the only difference. We both said it was even better than the recipe we use to cook it on the grill. This will become our main salmon recipe from here on in. Thanks for a great tasting recipe!!

Excellent,I just made this for passover dinner, and everyone LOVED it.  However I tried it out a few days ago using the called for ingredients and found it too had too much vinegar.   So when I made it for company, I tripled all the ingredients but kept the vinegar the same and that was fantastic.

This is amazing, so simple and flavorful.
I made the recipe as directed but did not use it all as we are only two.  Two days later I used the rest of the sauce on chicken, it was great. I can't wait to use it on pork chops. Thank you for this one.

This was good, but I truly would give it a 4 1/2.  Next time I make it I will leave off the oregano, as I couldn't taste it at all and I put alot on my fillet. Also, think I'll let the fish marinade in the glaze then cook.

Fab recipe! This turned out great, I pretty much followed the ingredients, but added a touch more wine and honey and little less balsamic, also some fresh ginger.  Excellent result, sweet and spicy.  Serving tip, try with assorted roast vegetables with a olive oil, balsamic, garlic and rosemary. Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, not exactly as wonderful as I thought it would be after reading the reviews. I followed the directions exactly and for some reason my sauce never thickened. I thought the balsamic taste was too strong and I do love balsamic. I guess I was hoping it would just be more sweet because of the honey, and thicker too. It was good but just not what I was hoping for and just missing  something.

The salmon was just right, great directions on time and temperature.  I had problems with the glaze, though.  I followed the directions exactly, but it didn't thicken up at all.  It was very heavy on the balsamic taste and was more like a sauce than a glaze since it was so thin.  I expected a sweeter, thicker taste.  The recipe sounded great, but just didn't turn out like I had imagined.  My family said not a keeper so I will try a different one in the future.

Something was off in this recipe. A flavor that was too strong or something. I can't put my finger on it, but I was extremely disappointed. I expected something a lot more delicious. I would try to tweak the recipe if I knew what was wrong with it, but unfortunately I really don't know. I don't think I'll be making this again.

My husband, who is not known for his cooking skills, made this one night when I worked late.  It was, hands down, the BEST salmon recipe I ever ate. My kids liked it a little less, as vinegar is a bit bitter, more to the adult palate (they prefer teriyaki salmon).  But it would be a great adult dinner party dish, quick, easy, economical and foolproof.

Made this with Salmon fillets and Tuna steaks. Went by the recipe very closely except didn't have dijon so I used yellow mustard. I don't know if that made a big difference or not but we did not care for it. DH & DD felt it would have been better if it were sweeter (will double the honey if we do it again) and I felt it was actually quite bland. Not a terrible recipe but we didn't care for it a lot.

I did not care for this.  I feel like I wasted a perfectly good piece of salmon.  I like all the ingredients but together I did not think it brought out the best flavor.  Maybe less mustard and more fresh herbs next time.  I may try the glaze on chicken next time around.

This was an easy and quick recipe.  I used the portion resizing and it worked out well, though i wish i had made more glaze after all.  I made this with orzo pasta and broccoli and my boyfriend loved it!

Used this recipe on some beautiful Lake Michigan wild salmon with the skin on, it was wonderful.  Like others, we noticed the fumes from the simmering vinegar solution but by the time it was on the salmon, the house smelled like a restaurant.  I hate it when people put in a long list of their own changes but I feel I have to admit that I squeezed in half a lemon at the end of the simmering and added some dried rosemary in addition to the oregano.  I'm sure it would have been delicious without my changes.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's day - he loved it!  However, my only change would have been to make more "gravy" - it just wasn't enough for before and after the preparation of the fish.

I made this the day it came to my email.  WOW!  We loved it.  The only change I made was to replace the white wine with lime juice.  I used an injector and injected some of the glaze into the salmon and let it soak for about 30 minutes.  I would not even classify myself as an intermediate level cook.  This was quick, easy, and used common ingredients.  We will enjoy this for many years! THANKS!

Holy wow! I was looking for a different way to make salmon and this was so good! The balsamic vinegar-sage combination was superb pared with the strong taste of our salmon fillet (and was an excellent - and healthy! - meal sided with white poppyseed steamed broccoli and red pepper flake-thyme sweet potatoes) I thirded the recipe as it was only for my husband and me and as I didn't want to open a bottle of wine for 1 tsp, I used white wine vinegar instead. I didn't have Dijon mustard so I substituted a coarse ground German style mustard and thought it was very good that way. My husband raved over it...definitely a keeper!!!

very good. If your oven is true to temperature, cook on the lower end of the time frame. I over-cooked it a bit, but the sauce was delicious, and the oregano was a very good touch, though I will make a bit more of the sauce than suggested in the future to have leftover to pour over before serving. I served it with roasted green-beans and shallot/walnut wild rice and it was a beautiful meal.

Excellent and easy recipe!  I did add an additional 1/2 Tablespoon of honey, but other than that, did not change a thing.  It had a richness of flavor that I often associate with grilled salmon.

Made a few adjustments to the listed recipe... used red wine, Sicilian - used 1/3 cup of Balsamic (less is good if it's good stuff) - used organic mustard - no salmon, used chicken breast. 

Mmmm mmmm good! Served it with cous cous, soft goat cheese, and a glass of that Sicilian red. Amazing dinner.

This was an easy to prepare recipe - I only had three salmon fillets, so froze half of the glaze to use for another meal (which reminds me, I must retrieve it from the freezer to have again this week). Thanks for the recipe Isybel.

Very tasty and nice flavour combo!  I cut the glaze in half as I was only cooking for hubby and I and it was quick and easy for a weeknight meal with steamed broccoli.  We definitely still prefer our salmon on the BBQ with lots of dill/garlic/lemon, but this is definitely a keeper for something different.  Thanks!

I prefer my salmon poached so I made the glaze and put it on after poaching.  I love the flavor and the glaze can be used on many other things such as grilled veggies and salads.

This is our new favorite salmon recipe!  My husband and I love the Baked Dijon Salmon from this site, but were looking for something more heart healthy.  We were plesantly surprised that we like this recipe as much!  I use more garlic to suit our taste...the glaze is really nice.  Leftovers work nicely on top of mixed greens for a great salmon salad.

This was amazing! Used a little more white wine than suggested & it came out great. Will definitely use this recipe again... Complemented the fish w/ white Japanese rice and lemon-butter snow peas (to cleanse the palette). Delicious!

Great recipe. I agree with a previous rater that double the liquid. Really sweet glaze and the fish is beautifully moist when it comes out of the oven.

This recipe is tangy, zippy, and gives the salmon a rich and moist texture. I didn't have fresh oregano so I crushed some dried bay leaves on the top - still that tangy Mediterranean taste. I also didn't have any wine (under 21), so I opted for white vinegar and it worked fine. I added a little extra honey to compensate. This seems like it would work as a marinade for any meat. I want to try it with lamb. Nummy.

We're not big wine drinkers, so rather than open a bottle of wine for a few tablespoons I used apple juice-- it may have made the sauce slightly sweeter but it was still fantastic. The flavour is different, but everyone who tried it enjoyed it.
I intend to use this sauce in other dishes.

This was pretty good but I think I should have marinated the salmon in the sauce, shaken off the excess and then baked so that my sauce would caramelize better.

We didn't care much for this recipe.  Although we love all of the ingredients, the ratio of vinegar to honey, Dijon and wine seemed "off".  Would not make again.  Thanks anyway!

This is very tasty. The combination of balsamic vinegar, mustard and honey brings out unique flavors in the salmon.

Yum!  I did less balsamic, more honey based on other's reviews, and I was very pleased.  Easy, quick, on-hand ingredients!  Thanks!

We eat quite a bit of salmon so are always trying new recipes. I enjoyed this recipe, but my husband loved it! He preferred the stronger flavor of the balsamic and said it was one of the best salmon recipes we've tried.

My boyfriend was convinced that he did not like Salmon until I made this dish for him. It was great! Next time I am going to try to grill the salmon because it was a little bland, but the sauce made up for it. I seasoned the fish a little bit with garlic powder and I let the sauce sit on the salmon 20 minutes before I cooked it in the oven. I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

Delightful way to cook the salmon. I marinated in for a couple hours in the sauce prior to throwing into the oven. At first I was afraid the pungent sauce would overpower my dish but it complemented the salmon perfectly .

I thought this was good we decided it would be better grilled but it was really good.  I didn't have white wine so I used red it didn't seem to make much diffrence.

The smell while this was cooking was fantastic!  I followed directions and amounts to a "T".  The only thing that I would change next time is to marinade the fish for at least an hour.   Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome! I used roasted garlic that I had left over from a previous recipe.  Also, I didn't have any wine, dijon mustard or honey so instead I used molasses in place of honey and honey mustard in place of the dijon. Bam! Will be making this again!

Considering the first time I cooked salmon it was awful, we really liked this one.  I dont think I used enough of the vinegar because it came out more like a paste and after I covered the fillet with it, there was none left to baste with.  But I intend to add this to my collection and make again.

I grilled the salmon on the barbeque and it was awesome. I added a tablespoon of maple syrup in addition to the honey because I thought it needed a little something extra. Will definitely make this again.

I had rainbow trout in the freezer and decided to try this recipe with it instead of waiting to buy salmon.  It was delicious and I appreciated the tip on lining pan with foil - such an easy clean up after!  A gourmet treat but it was so quick and easy to prepare. This was a really great beginning to my membership with Allrecipes.

Pretty good.  Didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.  Tasted mostly like balsamic vingear, which I love, but was hoping for a little more.

This is a really delicious salmon fillet recipe that I scaled down to serve one person.  The marinade is a tasty sweet and sour glaze that complements salmon beautifully.  Also it's quick and easy.  Great marinade/glaze for barbequed salmon, too.  Thanks!

All we could taste was the dijon mustard. It didn't blend with the other flavors at all. I'm giving this 3 stars because it was easy and we could eat it but it wasn't anything I'd try again.

OMG, absolutely wonderful!  My husband and I loved the tanginess of the balsamic vinegar and the subtle sweetness of the honey, wine, and mustard. This was a great change from all the teriyaki-based salmon recipes I have been making recently.  AND, this is the first year I have grown some herbs in my garden, so I was able to use my fresh oregano with this dish.  It made it even more special!

We always have salmon and pierogies for our main dish for our Polish Christmas Eve dinner.  This year I tried this recipe for the salmon and it was fantastic!!!  Easy to prep the glaze ahead of time and cut the filet into single serving files made cooking and serving super easy!  Even the discerning kids who were skeptical of the brown glaze on top said it was delicious!! 

I added the garlic butter green beans, crescent rolls and cranberry sauce for a beautiful table of color and flavors!

I was pretty sceptical about this recipe due to the ingredients but it came out pretty good. The sauce didn't come out as thick as I would've liked it to. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was fantastic, husband said it was a keeper and rated it company quality. We both enjoy good food,  and this IS good food. Flavors blended well and the filet was able to be the star without  being out of balance with the balsamic sauce.

Tasty, with a good blend of flavors. Prepared with Frozen salmon filets  so that may be the difference in four and five star. Will definitely try it again and see! Update on review: My husband and I ate leftover salmon tonight. Oh my goodness outstandingly delicious! Unfortunately I read reviews and suggestions after making recipe.......I agree marinate for 15-30 minutes before cooking. It makes this a five star instead of four!

Didn't use as much salmon as it called for, nor as much balsamic vinegar (I didn't have as much in the bottle as I thought), but it was still excellent!

This was just Ok, however I didn't have any white wine on hand so left it out. Maybe that's why it was a little bland for my taste. I may need to play around with this recipe if I make it again. Plus my fillets took longer to cook than specified.

Pretty good just not my my favorite taste with all the balsamic vinegar. I’d half the balsamic vinegar next time. Had to nearly double the cooking time along with broiling at the end to finish it off. Either way it was still pretty good and impressed the Mr.:)

I added capers, and it really brought it together and added some dimension. I also used steelhead instead of salmon, and it was all tremendous. I will definitely make it again

This recipe did nothing for me. I think it was way too heavy on the vinegar. Not sure what the right combo might be, but this just doesn't work.

Really great recipe! Only sub was fresh dill because I had it on hand & frozen coho, thawed. Needed to cook a bit longer but that's just thickness of fillets & personal taste. Definitely a keeper and will make again. Thanks for an easy elegant salmon recipe- fit for company for sure!

This was delicious and includes ingredients that I always have on-hand.  I used some brown sugar instead of honey this time around and was delicious, just like the original version.

I think it's a great recipe as in is very easy and quick. It is a good base mine lacked flavor. It wasn't flavorful at all! Next time I will definitely marinate and probably use some other seasonings!

This recipe is a regular part of our dinner rotation. I really like this one. It doesn't make enough glaze so I always have to double the glaze recipe. I love that it's really fast to make too so it's great for dinners on busy days.

I'm not a huge fan of salmon though, generally, so 4/5 stars from me.

This is really yummy!  The balsamic vinegar caramelizes in the oven so it sweetens more as it cooks.  I made this dish with roasted potato chunks, so baked them at 375 F for 25 minutes, flipped the potatoes, then put the salmon on another baking sheet alongside the potatoes for an additional 15 minutes.  Came out great.

Used wild sockeye salmon. Did not marinate, but continued basting while it baked. Absolutely delicious and so easy. Would definitely make again!

I served this to my family and there were mixed reviews.  Not what you want for $65 worth of salmon.  I used dill instead of oregano as we love dill but only half of the family liked it.  I personally felt it had little flavor.  I won't repeat this recipe.

I did not have white wine nor fresh oregano on hand, so I used dried oregano and cooking sherry. The result was easy and quite tasty, but we would have liked a little more garlic.

It doesn't really worth it. The smell when you prepare 'balzamic glaze'  is horrible, and the result is just a little bit different from basic 'fry on pan with salt and peper'.

Loved this recipe!  I didn't change a thing except to adjust the amount of ingredients proportionately to the amount of salmon I was making.  Not only was this fabulous when it was first served, the leftovers were an amazing addition to my lunch salad the next day.  Will definitely make this again!

This was excellent. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I only had 2 fillets so I made enough sauce for 3 servings using their handy resizing tool. I made everything as written except for using dried oregano instead of fresh. I will make it the same the next time but may get more fish because 1 fillet wasn't enough!

Tried this with a thick cut of wild salmon and the family loved it.  The marinade tasted alone is good but when combined it was terrific.  I used fresh hot and spicy oregano from the garden which gave it a little kick but that was the only alteration to the recipe.  I did grill the salmon over cedar plans which also gave a flavor nuance and would grill the same way again.

I made the recipe exactly as it's written, and I really didn't care for it.  I think the Dijon is a bit overwhelming and I think I would leave it out and add wasabi or white horseradish instead.

I followed the recipe and like other reviewers said, the glaze stinks while it's cooking.  The salmon was only ok and salmon is too expensive to not be great so I  won't be making this recipe again.

It's a good recipe, but we only use the best of the best balsamic in our house.  This was way, WAY too sweet. ( I blame the balsamic). To be on the safe side, serve with lemon wedges and encourage guests to use them.  Mine really needed and was enhanced by the wedges.

Absolutely wonderful! The acid from the vinegar combined with the sweetness from the honey and the tang from the Dijon makes for an amazing glaze. I followed the recipe to a T and would not change a thing. Loved it!! Even my 4 year old who claims to not like salmon devoured it:)

I made this without the wine,  I used  Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing instead with one large roasted garlic clove for 2- 8 oz fillets. I also used honey mustard because thats all I had. Its better then restaurant quality . I never say anything about my cooking but this was sensational. I poured the excess sauce over plain white rice with steamed broccoli . I could have eaten 2 more filets it was so good.  It took me  only 25 min start to finish. It Cooked to" perfection" at 20 min at 350 on a greased foil cookie sheet pan. I  can't wait to make it again !

I made this recipe as stated, but was not impressed. The flavor of the sauce is good, but it is way too overpowering for salmon. All you taste is the sauce! I might as well have been eating chicken. If you force yourself to eat salmon for the health benefits, but don't like the taste of fish, this is a recipe for you. But if you actually enjoy the taste of salmon, this is a waste of your fish! However, I do think it would be a yummy sauce to spread on top of chicken near the end of baking; I let some of the sauce simmer on low for about 10 minutes and it was delicious right off the spoon (just don't put it on my salmon ;-). I also think it would be good, on chicken, with alittle rosemary instead of oregano. Overall, I would not make again for a salmon dinner; maybe for chicken though.

I've made this several times now. I've never had the white wine to add and it turns out delicious. And so yummy over a bed of spinach topped with blue cheese crumbles.

It was very simple to make and I like that it used ingredients that every kitchen has on hand.  I would make this again and my husband who is not a big fish eater liked it as well.

The sauce had a little too much vinegar for our tastes.  I give it points for being such an easy, quick recipe, but the flavor wasn't great.  I probably won't make it again.

Great recipe. It took a lot longer than 3 minutes for my glaze to thicken. Probably more like 15m. But is was worth it. Great flavor. Even my picky kids liked it. Will definitely make again.

Made it exactly per the recipe. It was very good, according to those who ate it! I don't like salmon, but my family does. They said this is a recipe I should make again and there were no leftovers. I may try to grill it next time.

Overall, an easy and tasty marinade. Subbed sugar for honey as I didn't have any, and no oregano. I'll use next time.

I have made this 4 times! The first 2 I subbed balsamic for apple cider/sugar and it was a hit both times. Also using yellow mustard cause I never use anything else. 3rd time I bought balsamic just for the recipe to try, and I did not like the change in flavor so tonight (4th time) I cooked it my way with the substitute and am just here to say THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL RECIPE that is quick and delicious. I'm not a cook but enjoy trying new meals and this meal makes me feel like there is hope. Comes out moist and there is NO WAY to MESS UP THE FLAVOR. 5 stars all the way!

Very tasty.  I had a big piece of fish and therefore cut the recipe in thirds because not everyone in my house likes to "jazz up" fish. I made my third according to this recipe, but I wish I had used the whole amount of honey.  Don't get me wrong, it was fabulous, just needed a tad more sweetness. Didn't this website used to have a conversion calculator?? I really needed that.

I cooked the recipe as instructed, adjusted for just two salmon filets. I am mostly impartial to fish, but how much my girlfriend and I loved the salmon was a pleasant surprise. 

Had to leave the filets in the oven for an extra five minstes because the middle wasn't quite cooked enough for us, but we were both in food heaven.

I threw cooked string beans onto the fish, poured the marinade over it, covered it completely in foil and baked it for about 30 minutes. It was perfect! A great low-carb meal.

Wow, this was incredible! I made the recipe as written. I wasn't sure if the glaze was thick enough but followed the instructions and it was perfect. My husband said this was the best salmon he's ever had! Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this for dinner it came out great. I made a few changes I added some brown sugar to cut some of the tartness I also added some mushrooms on top  with onions 7 minutes before it was done. I ate this over rice with broccoli on the side. I am certainly going to make this again I will also try it with chicken. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made it according to the recipe, except I had Dijon mustard pretzel dipping sauce instead of straight dijon mustard. I think they were basically the same.

The fish was terrific. I tripled the sauce and used the extra over the rice I made to go with it. It was a little intense. I think it could have used more honey, maybe some onion powder. Maybe a little less mustard. But it was very good. This time I complemented it with glazed carrots, but I would think garlic green beans would also be yummy.

Doubled the sauce because I had a really large piece of salmon. I took the salmon out of the fridge about a half hour before I wanted to put it in the oven and just poured about 2/3 of the sauce on it and let it sit at room temperature. Because the piece was so large, it took probably 20 minutes to cook, and I put it on broil for the last few minutes to make the sauce more of a glaze. Really delicious and easy.

I wanted a bit more flavor, just a bit.  overall it was pleasant...perhaps some horseradish or  red pepper (tiny bit).  Perhaps I simply didn't add enough pepper!

This recipe for which we used coho was fantastic.  The only change I made was to add a little soya sauce instead of salt and added some fresh ginger to the garlic saute. This is a definite repeat . . . delicious.  The balsamic I used was a fig base and I would suggest that you use any balsamic blend.

The balsamic vinegar in this recipe is extremely strong/over-powering.  The beautiful taste of salmon had a hard time coming through.  I ended up adding a lot more honey in an attempt to balance the flavors a little bit.  I chose to cook the fish under the broiler instead of baking it (I almost always choose the broiler when it comes to fish).  This glaze is okay, but not great.  I probably won't make it again (because I have several other salmon recipes I thoroughly enjoy).

It was ok but since I only had 2 pieces of fish I adjusted the amount to 1/2. Now wish I'd have made more balsmic sauce to drizzle on more like the recipe called for. I put it on and baked , it would have been better drizzled a few minutes before being done

This made a fair amount of sauce and I only had two salmon fillets so I threw some broccoli, mushrooms and red pepper into the pan and threw the sauce over everything, baked it for a few minutes extra. It was really easy to prepare and took minimal time. I didn't have any wine but other than that the ingredients are basic and readily available. Final results were delicious but a little sweet. My husband says he would like it again but without the honey. I'll still use the honey but maybe halve it and see how it goes.

We only used 2 cloves of garlic and cut back on the vinegar a bit and we liked it, but it wasn't one of the best things we'd ever tasted.  I've used a maple glaze on salmon in the past, then grilled it on cedar planks and got a much better flavour.

I have made this salmon dish about ten times and I still am amazed each time I sit down to eat this how great it turns  out.   When you cook the garlic, wine, honey ,etc, you must allow the sauce to thicken a bit before brushing it on the fillets.  
I made organic sweet potatoes and sautéed spinach as sides.  Sorry there weren't any leftovers.
I do not deviate from the recipe, but I do pour myself a glass of white wine as I cook!

Perfect, I loved the combination of flavors made by the Balsamic + Honey.

Everyone at the table enjoyed the Salmon.

this is an amazing recipe, very easy to follow. I've made this recipe about three times and every time it was very delicious.
However, the quality of your ingredients will determine your results. if you use cheap balsamic vinegar or regular mustard I'm sure the result wont be as good. 
so for anyone that reads this, use only the best for this.

This was fantastic!  5 year old, 15 year old, a NON-healthy food loving hubby and they all loved it.  I simmered the sauce longer than it called for (resulting in a thicker glaze) and it was perfect.  Will surely make again :)

I would make this again. Instead of using oregano, I used fresh basil and lemon zest. Doubled the glaze and tripled the garlic.... We like garlic.

I followed the recipe exactly but realized I was out of balsamic vinegar, so I had to substitute white wine vinegar. I'll try this recipe again with balsamic soon.

My husband and I liked it, the kids thought it was "too heavily glazed," but they are 5 and 9, so take that for what it's worth.  I forgot to sprinkle the oregano on.  It was still fine.

I made this recipe exactly how it was written and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. It has that tang vinegar tends to leave behind but it worked with the fish. My teenage children gave it 2 thumbs up and said they wouldn't "die" if they had to eat it again, so I'd say it's a win!!!

Wondered how it would be without any eVOO but it was very good.  I basted it a few times while it was baking in the oven.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.

I kinda improvised since I didn't have any white wine that I could use without my mother getting suspicious and I didn't have any dijon mustard so I had to use Sherry's Cooking Wine and make my own dijon mustard. I also added some capers to go on top of the fillets, so it turned out delicious at the end.

Wow, followed recipe with all sauce ingredients but for only 2 servings (more sauce for us!) and it was fantastic. It will definitely be one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon from now on!  I had to use used dried oregano since I didn't have fresh and added sliced scallions before serving. Thanks for such an easy, tasty salmon recipe.

Great flavor, we enjoyed this recipe. Quick and easy with common ingredients. We'll make this again but next time make extra glaze to add to the plate on the side.

5 out of 5! I followed this recipe to a 'T' except adding ground ginger and red pepper flakes and did not marinade beforehand. I could not get the BF to stop eating it. Amazing.

I made as the recipe called for, but it was not a hit. It was a bit too heavy with balsamic vinegar. This is the first time I've tried using balsamic vinegar with fish, and I think that combination may not be my cup of tea.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have white wine so I used some Sherry. I'll definitely be making this again. Thinking to let it marinate for maybe an hour or so next time before baking and then broil it for the last few minutes.

This is fabulous!  I followed the recommendation of another rater and added a little bit of fresh ginger.  Otherwise, I kept it the same.  Delicious and easy!

Loved it, first time with the recipe, cutting it down for one filet, using a new convection toaster oven.  I couldn't ask for a more pleasant and easy way to break in my oven and a new recipe site for me.  It came out awesome!

The recipe had too much vinegar for me. So to neutralize the acidity of the sauce I placed a dash of baking soda and that helped it a lot. I also added a tiny bit more honey because my family has a slight sweet tooth ;) I also added green onions like another reviewer mentioned mentioned for color and crunch. Lay it on a bed of asparagus for a healthy addition!

I Love Love this recipe!! so easy and delicious.  This is one of the 1st times I made salmon and what a way to go.  I made it with rice and used a little of the glaze for the rice. YUMMY!
I used dill vs the oregano and probably would have been slightly better if the dill had been fresh vs. dried.  Definitely will be eating more salmon like this!  Can't wait to try the glaze with chicken.

Salmon was a little dry.  The glaze was just OK in flavor and a bit thin.  This didn't compare in flavor to the Maple Salmon recipe which is also much easier to prepare.

Served this to friends and we all loved it. My friend asked for leftovers to take home! I made a boo-boo - forgot to cook the garlic first. Also, our grocer did not not have salmon and I used red trout - was still great! Will definitely be making this again! My fish was 1/2" thick and I cooked for 6 minutes at 400 degrees. Perfect. I served it over Minnesota wild rice.

Fantastic, TASTY way to do Salmon! My family already loves this fish but we were tired of just lemon. I kept salmon whole (1-pound filet), covered with sauce and sliced after baking and served with easy tangy sweet potato fries. Delicious!

I prepared the Salmon exactly as it was written in the recipe, and served it to my family last night. It was a definite hit!  Even though I (personally) prefer 'savory' flavors, I also liked it. I served the Salmon over "Lemon Rice w/Parsley", and with "Asparagus Spears Roasted in Garlic" on the side.  The Salmon was perfect, and our entire dinner was a huge hit!

Very good recipe! Will definitely make again. Easy to follow, easy prep and easy cleanup. The ingredients for the glaze really compliment each other without one overpowering the other, very balanced. Great results if you use the best and freshest ingredients.

That sauce is amazing, and I didn't mind the smell as some did while it was cooking.  Yes, the sauce is mild so doesn't really get into the fish if you don't marinate it or baste it while it's cooking, but I'm ok with it.  I just added more sauce (I had plenty after two pieces) when it was finished.  I was kind of impatient so didn't thicken it as much as I was supposed to, but I'm ok with just dipping the salmon in more sauce if needed.  I will definitely make this sauce again!

Made this tonight and it was so good my 5 and 3 year olds all asked for more sauce to put over their rice and green beans. I also used it as dressing for my salad. I did omit white wine (didn't have any) and subbed agave for the honey (what I had) and added ginger as another reviewer suggested. I reduced the Dijon mustard as I was afraid it may be too spicy for their taste, but next time I will make two batches and use the suggested amount for the hubs and I. Even with these changes, it was still amazing, so don't be afraid to try even if you're missing a few things or want to play around with it. This will be a weekly staple.

This recipe looks great! I actually tried something like this a while back, and this just brought back so many nostalgic memories, haha! I love cooking stuff like this. I always try to find new recipes on forums and I got great ones emailed to me from http://lovelyrecipesforyou.weebly.com and I genuinely enjoy them. Anyways, thanks for posting this dish, I really need to make this more often!

It was good, and I did not find smell of sauce anything but good! I would recommend individual filets rather than my choice of a whole one, but other than that, quite nice! I did have to run the broiler for 5 minutes to get the caramelization that really makes it work! Thanks for the recipe!!

Leave a little sauce to add to it when it's cooked...really tasty! I add much more honey...I like the sweetness to it. I've traded my herb, lemon & evoo recipe for this...tasty change! I use salmon fillets with no skin. Enjoy it!

This was good. I added orange zest to glaze and squeezed some fresh orange juice over salmon before serving. I served over brown rice that I also mixed a little orange zest into.

I didn't have any oregano so I used rosemary instead. It was wonderful!  And I agree with CM, it would have been very hard to marinate with this sauce especially!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Not overly flavorful, flavors come together fine, but prefer other preparations of salmon (e.g., Miso) to this one.

Used lemon instead of wine and sprinkled dried oregano because it's what I had on hand. My 10-year-old said it was the best salmon he's ever had!

I used this recipe by eyeballing the ingredients for my one filet of salmon. It's perfect and delicious - not difficult. I use my small convention oven and the timing was correct - fish came out fantastic. 

I find myself returning this salmon topping time and time again.

Glaze did not overpower the salmon. Very easy to prepare. I had trouble getting the salmon cooked through all the way - this could have been because of the uneven shape of the fillets. My husband said it reminded him of Hawaiian dressings... I think we prefer our usual, more plain lemon salmon, but this was good for a change.

I tried it as listed but balsamic was too much for my taste. Second try I doubled the wine and honey and halved the vinegar. That rocked for my taste buds!! Thanks!

ok  so my husband was convinced I was trying to kill him by giving serving him salmon. Can I just say, after the first bite I got WOW!!! This is amazing. I didn't stray from the recipe at all except I guessed the amount of brown sugar. I served it with some long grain wild rice and steamed asparagus. There was no left overs :o(. Definitely a keeper!!

My kids love salmon, but they did not like this at all.  The smell in the house drove them nuts.  I don't like salmon, but I ate it.

Really liked the tang of the vinegar.  Scaled down for 2 people, and poured the sauce over the salmon (after brushing) before baking.  Good flavors, easy to make.

Okay, my fellow hobbyist chefs. Supper has been served and this recipe, on a scale of 1 to 10, is a solid 17. This is a gotta make if you like salmon. Amazing recipe. I threw it onto the top rack of the grill on medium heat, encased in foil, for about 20 minutes, then flipped it, turned the heat to max, and let the top and marinade get charred for another 5 minutes. Go forth and create taste sensations! May the forks be with you.

We love salmon in this house!  This recipe totally ruined 4 lovely fillets. I should have taken note when several posters said that the sauce didn't taste good before they put it on the salmon.  Any sauce should taste great as a stand alone.

This recipe was ok, but pretty blah, definitely nothing to write home about. It also took quite a bit longer to bake than stated in the recipe, and I was using a thinner tail piece too. It wasn't bad, just nothing I'd make again.

Super yummy and turns our more sweet than acidic or mustard tasting. I use whole grain mustard rather than Dijon with great results!

The sauce was pretty good but it turned out pretty dry. It may have been the frozen salmon we used or maybe we need to marinate next time.

Made this tonight for dinner and followed the recipe exactly as written.  While the kids enjoyed the salmon, it just didn't do it for me.  I personally did not like it.  I have better salmon recipes in my repetoire.

Loved it - best salmon dish I've made in a while.  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used cilantro instead.  Next time I'm going to make more sauce.

I'm sorry to say but this tasted somewhat awful. The Balsamic and garlic/butter mixture didn't go well together, and adding the honey didn't help. I tried it without the balsamic, which wasnt as bad, but still not a good mix.

This was easy and flavorful. I felt that the balsamic vinegar was a bit strong, next time would reduce the amount slightly and/or add a little brown sugar. However, it was moist and yummy - thanks!!
Edit to add: Made this tonight with less balsamic (maybe a tablespoon or so) and everyone gave it 5 stars!

One word - DELICIOUS!!! The flavors mixed VERY WELL together! I followed the recipe almost exactly; I used a lite balsamic vinaigrette b/c that's all I had on hand. Thank you very much for this recipe! My family loved it!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I made just as written, but used dried oregano b/c it's what I had, and added it to the glaze before simmering.  Also, my salmon was done in 7 minutes.

I love this simple recipe!  It is a quick and easy meal for me to make when I don't have much time.  I didn't put oregano in my dish, but I am not big on the flavor so I left it out.  My husband (who isn't a big fan of fish) enjoys this recipe.  It adds a lot of flavor!  For me, this is my go to salmon recipe!

This is one of my favorite salmon dishes! I loved the sauce (left some over to add on top). Some of my family liked it without extra sauce, some added a lot more. Loved the complex flavors and it was pretty easy to make. If you love balsamic vinegar like I do, it's a sure bet!

I cooked this recipe verbatim. It said 10-14 minutes, I cooked it for precisely 11 minutes and 30 seconds and it was just perfect! Actually the best salmon I have ever cooked. I sided it with sugar snap peas lightly cooked with a little evoo, garlic salt and a little "I can't believe it's not butter(light)" AWESOME!!!

My new favorite! I forgot about the oregano and didn't add the white wine and this still was a super delicious moist fish.  I used a whole fillet and baked for 20 minutes. I can't wait to try this again!

I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a 3 and my husband thought it was 5, so we met in the middle.  This was an interesting flavor for salmon and it was definately a change of pace from how we normally eat it. Pretty good.  Be sure to let your glaze simmer long enough for it to thicken, otherwise the flavors don't meld correctly.

These were really easy to make and quite tasty. I'm glad we didn't marinate these for any length of time, as I thought the sauce was quite strong on its own. I would have liked to have tasted the honey more, so next time I'll double the amount.

This was really good! I reserve five star reviews for recipes that really blow me away, but this was probably a solid four and a half. I cooked mine on the grill with some alder chips, but it's really the glaze that makes it great. I love balsamic vinegar, and the balance of the sweet honey and the tangy vinegar is wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

The glaze for this recipe was super easy and quick.  As another reviewer suggested, I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes to the mix to give it a little kick.  At first taste, I thought the salmon was too sweet, but, it was just fine.  I also broiled the fillets during the last 3 mins of cooking.  Will make again.

I scaled this to 4 servings.  The glaze was good but I probably should have doubled it.  There was some left to use but not to use as a dip for the fish, therefore, the dish still had too much of a fishy taste to it.  What I may try if I make this again is once you get the skin off and are ready to put it on the serving platter, flip it upside down and put glaze on the bottom.  Easy to make and a nice idea.

Meh.  This was good, but not 4.5 star exciting. I like all the ingredients in this recipe but somehow this combination is lackluster.  We skipped the tbsp of white wine but I'm not sure it would have made the recipe to include it.

I thought I would like this more than I did.  I will try again but try to thicken up my glaze a little next time.  I like the ingredient combination so I must have done something wrong.

Not bad at all, but doesn't even come close to salmon bbq on a plank!  In addition, my salmon was about 2 inches thick, so I had to bake it for almost twice as long and there were still some translucent sections.

No one liked it, most of it was thrown away. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't like the glaze at all. I thought it would be a hit based on the reviews, but it was a HUGE flop. Obviously most people who reviewed liked it, personally I will never use this recipe again.

This  recipe was delicious. I did make some revisions to it. I added an additional tsp of honey and a tblsp of brown sugar. I also added a tblsp of corn starch to thicken the glaze so that it stays on the salmon better. It did not come out of the oven looking as eye appealing as the picture shows, but it did have great flavor. I agree with other users to double the sauce, you will want to eat it in every bite!

This was delicious! My husband loves sauce, so there was enough. If you like sauce, make the full amount; if not, just make half. I didn't marinate it at all, but if I used less sauce, I would probably marinate it for 30 minutes or so. I used dill instead of oregano, and I will probably add ginger to it next time, too, and use a little less honey. Thanks for the recipe!

The balsamic glaze was fairly tasty, but the addition of the oregano made it very bitter.

This was so good!  Even if I didn't follow the recipe to a T.  First, I halved this recipe, then added two tilapia fillets to replace one of the salmon fillets (my mom doesn't like salmon).  Then I omitted the oregano and substituted honey dijon salad dressing for the honey and the dijon mustard and that worked just fine.  I served it over a bed of sauteed spinach and it was a hit!  Can't wait to make this again!

This dish was surprisingly fantastic!! I served it on a bed of baby romaine salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing and it was delicious. Like someone else said, it didn't smell great while baking but the end result was well worth it. There was a hint of sweet sugary flavour, even though there is no sugar in the recipe. It all went really well together.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added no salt or pepper and I just sprinkled a little bit of dry oregano instead of fresh. I also eyeballed most ingredients, adding a little more white wine. Thanks for a great recipe! This will definitely be a regular menu item at my house!

I didn't really like the balsamic flavor with salmon.  I wondered if it is because I have been addicted to Brown Sugar Glazed salmon from this site, and it is quite sweet, so I'm always after that kind of combination?  Hubby didn't really like much either.  Not terrible, just not for us.

Very tasty. I added a little extra wine to the reduction I expect because of the inexpensive brand I used. I plan to experiment with adding a light seasoning to fish prior to baking. Has anyone tried this yet?

Fantastic, and no changes needed!  It's quick, it's easy and tasty.  With normal glazes, I find they need something extra and end up having to use a sauce of some kind that adds unwanted calories and sugar.  I needed nothing for this, absolutely delicious, thanks for sharing!

I felt uncomfortable using 1/3 c Balsamic Vinegar and only 1 Tbsp Honey, and felt that the measurements were backwards, so I used 1/3 c Honey and 1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar.  I'm really glad I did!  Everyone raved about how first you taste the glaze, then the salmon taste pops in, and that the glaze was a wonderful complement to the salmon.  I accompanied this with Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes.  My 11 year old Grandson remarked how great it was to get a gourmet meal at home.  It turned out really well with the changes I made, and with my changes, I would definitely make this again!

My boyfriend who doesn't even like salmon likes this recipe.  If you don't have a brush, pour the mixture over the salmon.

Great taste easy, fast, the family love it. I didn't have any dill, follow the recipe to the letter other than that. Don't the taste of the sauce by itself mislead you. Will make again.

This salmon was excellent! I doubled the sauce recipe for extra to go over the brown rice I served with this. My boyfriend and I both lapped it up. I will make this again, no changes necessary!

I made a second salmon recipe just in case this didn't go over well.  Even my 3 year old loved it!  Don't let the balsamic scare you--the honey balances this nicely.  Also, I poured the glaze all over the salmon instead of just brushing some on--and it didn't overwhelm the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

I gave this recipe three stars because I felt that there was too much vinegar.  I ended up adding 2 more tablespoons each of wine and honey and I also added more mustard (total of 3 Tbl. mustard).  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used dried -- just 1/2 teaspoon.  With these changes, the recipe rates 5 stars.  As written, 3 or 3-1/2 stars.

This recipe was pretty good, but I probably won't make it again. The experience of eating it was not a memorable one for me. If you like sweet fish, then this is a decent recipe, as the flavors are subtle and not overpowering. I think I prefer my salmon to have a stronger flavor to it.

Good recipe.  The honey added a good flavor.  It would probably be better with a little more honey.  I'll try that next time.

We did not like this at all.  I adjusted the ingredients for only 2 pieces of salmon, but the salmon got very dry, and the taste was not very good.  Did not go over well here....couldn't even finish it.

This is absolutely a standard at my house. I can't count the number of times I have made it. Even the 15 year old who "hates fish" asks for it! Only correction--I find that I have to cook the fish 20-30 minutes before it is properly cooked throughout.

I have made this recipe just as is and it was great!  I have also used Pomegranite Balsamic vinegar and a red wine....even better!  But no matter which way, I will keep this recipe and continue to use it over and over, probably will try it on chicken and pork too.  Delicious recipe!

We've had this at least 10 times before I realized I was supposed to heat the marinade over the stove!  Tastes great without that step.  This is a family favorite and the only way we cook salmon now!

The picture makes it look so good....but no one in my family enjoyed this at all. The fish ended up being mushy and tasted funny. I followed the directions entirely, except instead of using the oven, I grilled it on my smoker/bbq grill. I had such great expectations since we are big salmon fans, but was very disappointed.

Excellent. I got tired of poaching salmon and I was out of white cedar for planking so I needed something different. The ingredients were similar to my planked recipe but this was easier. Oddly, I did not notice this awful smell a few have mentioned while cooking down the sauce. Perhaps I like balsamic vinegar better?

I scaled the sauce to 4 and used only 2 pieces of salmon.  It was delightful.  I'd serve this to guests.  Of course, I may use to scale next time.

YUM, YUM YUM! I've made this several times and its always good! True, it doesn't smell great when cooking, but sooo delicious and always easy to make with ingredients on hand. Also, it's a good break from some of the other recipes with brown sugar.

Good taste, very simple to prepare, and uses ingredients I almost always have on hand (I did skip the fresh oregano, but otherwise followed exactly as written). My fillets were perfectly cooked after 12 minutes. I served with wasabi mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus - the entire meal came together in less than 30 minutes, which was wonderful. Will make again, thanks!

I was a little worried about the sauce as it was simmering, because it definitely did not smell appetizing. However, once the dish was completed, it was great! I made it for my French in-laws and they also enjoyed it. Will be a staple in our house.

the vinegar overwhelms the taste of this glaze and does not smell good while cooking or go with the taste of the fish. Save yourself some time and just make a brown sugar glaze also found on allrecipes.

Just so-so, though my hopes were high. The marinade didn't seemed balanced. The flavor of the balsamic vinegar was overly dominate.

We followed the recipe except for the fact that we had one whole piece of salmon instead of filets.  The flavor of the glaze came out well but was a little watery. I will make again but broil the fish, instead of baking it so it can get a little bit of a crisp.

It was easy enough to prepare but the glaze never thickened up for me.  My husband and I enjoyed it, my teenage son, who does love salmon didn't like it so much.  I'll still make it again.

My mum loved this but I wasn't that impressed. I don't think the flavours complement the salmon that well, but perhaps thats more to do with personal taste. Had some extra marinade left over that I used on some pork the next day, which I liked a lot better.

Its too hot to use the oven in July, so I baked this in my toaster oven at 400 for 14 minutes (large enough for 2 adult servings).  Served this with spinach mashed potatos and it was perfect!  Only thing I will change next time is to make small incisions across the top of the filet to allow the glaze to penetrate.  Great recipe, thanks!

It was okay... a little lacking in depth. The balsamic overwhelmed the fish. If I did this recipe again, I would definitely cut the sauce in half. I like to taste my fish, not drown it.

This was a pretty good recipe. Nice and flavorful and pretty easy to make. Maybe we under seasoned, but it was just slightly lacking that "smack" that I was expecting with the basalmic. Overall though, definitely repeatable.

Once again, I didn't read the recipe properly and didn't cook the sauce ahead of time.  I had read other reviews though and marinated the salmon in the vinegar mixture - I used a large steak for 2 of us - for an hour in the fridge before cooking.  Cooked for 20 min instead of 14 as indicated.  It tasted wonderful and I'll certainly make it again.

Very good and easy. For some reason our salmon was fishy but this really helped take that away. Will definitely make again!

This was very good but even better when you marinate the steaks in the sauce (I put in a zip lock bag) and refrigerate for a couple of hours.

Very good! I made it exactly as directed except I Accidentally added the fresh oregano to the mixture. I cooked the salmon on the BBQ at low temp. The Salmon Fillets tasted great.

OMG! This dish really does taste like something you'd get from a restaurant. I am trying to incorporate more fish into my family's diet, which can be challenging with my picky eaters. They will eat fish, but only if it doesn't taste "fishy", so I'm always looking for a very flavorful yet healthy recipe for fish, especially salmon. This is a DEFINITE WINNER! Even my 4 year old loved it. I will be making this a lot.

Very nice sauce, but the dish definitely needs at least double the amount the recipe calls for, especially if you're going to serve this with something like rice which could benefit from the sauce, too.

easy recipe- my friends and i made it for a dinner party. It was the first time my boyfriend had ever tried fish HE LOVED IT. it was easy to make, looked great on the plate and tasted wonderful. We will defiantly make this again. Because this recipe was so easy we were able to make more of the sauce as needed, it made a great glaze.

I have to say I didn't like this very much.  The "Grilled Salmon I" recipe is much tastier.  I'll stick with that one.

I liked the way it turned out. Was wonderful flavor and even the hubby liked it. I would decrease the vinegar to 1/4c. add more wine and more dijon mustard next time and perhaps a tad ore honey. Just had a little bit of a vinegar twang. I also wouldn't make this for company if you want the house to smell good. :)

It was soo good. I added some cayanne pepper and basil when I salted and peppered the fish before baking. I also mixed in diced onions and mushrooms to the glaze and used them as a garnish. I can't wait to make it again!

I thought this salmon was ok.  Very easy to make and I followed it to a tee.  It came out a bit dry and it is very tangy.  Not one of my favorite salmon recipes, but I might make it again.  I recommend at least trying this recipe.  I served it with "Coucous Salad with Dried Cherries" from this site.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is the addition of the oregano. It was, in my opinion, an unnecessary ingredient that changed the dynamic of the dish. I will definitely make this salmon recipe again, but I will leave off the oregano. The glaze was great enough on its own.

I made this for people that don't usually like salmon. I did half with the balsamic glaze and half with a dill sauce. It was a huge hit. Everyone went back for seconds. *update* Now this has become the requesterd meal! My mom asked that I make it for her Birthday dinner :)

I don't like salmon. But we are trying to eat healthier so I decided to try it since I love balsamic vinegar. This turned out really, really good. It took longer than 15 minutes to cook, but my salmon was very thick. Another 10 minutes did the trick. I only used 2 salmon filets and marinated them in the mixture for a half hour while I cleaned some veggies and let the oven heat up. I also used marsala wine because that's all I had. Very flavorful and not "fishy" at all, My husband didn't even want to try it because he doesn't like salmon either, but he ended up eating his entire (huge) piece! Very good! Will make again.

I have been a little afraid of fish, cooking and eating it...but I know I should include more of it in my diet. I made this tonight for dinner, and it was AMAZING! I omitted the wine, only because I didnt have any open, and it was still SO GOOD!

I have to qualify my review by saying that my husband and I are not fish fans.  But we need to be more adventurous, so we gave it a shot.  Having said that, we liked this recipe.  I made it as written.  Instead of baking it to a certain time, I baked it to 135 degrees - I knew I wouldn't be able to tell if it was done.  It turned out very nice.  The glaze was tasty - I had just a bit on mine and my husband poured a bunch on because he loves balsamic.  If you like fish, this is probably a great recipe - but I will admit that we might make it again!

Out of this world!  Served with "Mashed Chipotle Sweet Potatoes," also from this site.  Really a perfect combination.  The glaze did smell awful, but we were pleasantly suprised.  It's a keeper.

This was fantastic!  I loved it and the smell was a little funky.  My husband didn't like that much mustard, but he's picky.  It was great!!

I made this recipe for V-day dinner and it turned out fine. The balsamic flavor kinda overpowered the salmon flavor, but overall it came out good. I made couscous as a side dish and had pinot grigio wine.

Omg! This was delicious! I come on this site alot because I'm new at cooking. I only recently started, maybe 3 months ago. I only cook for two so I always divide the recipes down to a two portion meal. And they come out fantastic. Next time I make this I'm going to make more of the glaze so I can put it over rice. Also someone mentioned having this w/ sauted Garlic GreenBeans. I tried that, I added lemon pepper to the green beans and a teaspoon of lemon juice and they were delicious!

I loved this recipe! First of all, with 4 kids 6 and under time is of the essence when it comes to cooking. I need something healthy that I can throw together quickly, preferably without compromising flavor. This recipe fit the bill. Easy, peasy and my kids scoffed it right up, as did my husband and I. I will definitely be making this again.

I read the other reviews and someone said the glaze didn't smell very good when it was simmering, but that it tasted good and they were right! It turned out great! I didn't have any white wine so I used some champagne and it was really good!

Being from Alaska, it is easy for us to be fish snobs - I really do not like to take away from the flavor of the fish in my cooking. I thought this was a little too intense for the salmon that I have in my freezer.  However, that being said, my children devoured it and asked for seconds.  When they saw salmon defrosting today, they requested this recipe again.

We just finished having this for dinner and I must say, I felt like I was eating at some fancy expensive restaurant.  It was that good!  My husband who doesn't even like Salmon couldn't get enough of it.  We are fighting over who gets the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Excellent dish.  Thanks!

This wasn't a favorite in my house.  I didn't really care for the way these flavours went with the salmon.  We did eat it all though, but I probably wouldn't be tempted to make it again.

This dish was a nice surprise!  Usually I cook salmon simply, with lemon and dill, etc.  The balsamic glaze was the perfect mixture... all ingredients were nicely balanced and the fish tasted surprisingly good!

Pretty good. I read the reviews, which are always helpful. I didn't marinate the salmon. The sauce did smell funny cooking (very strong), but not to worry it tasted great. Next time I would coat all the filets in the sauce better, doing this also a few times during baking.

Excellent flavor.  I substituted lemon juice for the wine since I didn't have any wine and it didn't affect the flavor adversely.  Will definitely use this one again.

This was quite good. I love salmon and this was a nice change from how I usually prepare it.  The sauce did smell really strong of vinegar when it was simmering, however it wasn't too overpowering on the fish. It had a nice balance of flavors and complimented the salmon very well.

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing we changed is that we added more wine and squeezed a lime over the salmon while i was eating it. My husband loved this recipe.

Our Family Loves this Salmon dish.  It is very flavorful.  It is also great for those who don't think they like fish.  We eat this one atleast once a month.  I make it just as the recipe calls.  The flavors work very well together.

Hubby raved about this from the first bite on. I thought the combination of flavors in the glaze were great. I'll be making salmon like this often. It was quick and easy to make, but is presentable enough for company.

I was really pleased with this, though I doubt I'll make it again any time soon. But, I think that has more to do with the quality of the salmon I used than the glaze itself. The glaze was super simple to make and quite tasty! I was really bored with just cooking my salmon in olive or sesame oil on the stove top, so this was a nice change!

I followed this exactly, except I put the glaze/marinade on the salmon about 3-4 hours before I baked it.  It was delicious!!  Also, super easy.

Four stars!! This recipe is absolutely fantastic IF you have fresh salmon. If you don't it's very hard to keep down. My husband and I made it with couscous and enjoyed it very much. :)

AMAZING!!! Very good and very easy to make. I let the salmon marinate and then put them on a large foil sheet and made one of those tents (but just one big one for all them) and poured the sauce in with the salmon so that all the flavor could steam in and the fish never dries out. Yuummmm!

Easy and satisfying!  I made this for a friend of mine who is an extremely picky eater - and he loved it!  I substituted dried oregano for fresh (don't skip this part - the oregano adds A LOT of flavor).  I suggest doubling the glaze and reserving some for dipping.

Yummy, Yum, Yum! We grilled this and revised the recipe by adding 1/3 cup of italian dressing. This was good eating. We made 2 large fillets and used one of the fillets as a garnish for a summer salad.

This recipe was okay, but not spectacular.  I doubled the amount of glaze because I like extra flavor.  The fish still came out pretty bland.  I probably will not make this dish again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The balsamic glaze was very flavorful, which in my opinion, complemented the salmon very nicely.  It was one of the best salmon fillets I have eaten.

The balsamic-glazed salmon was delicious.  At first, we cooked the glaze over too high of heat which made the sauce thicken too quickly.  Our second attempt went very well, however, and we will definitely be enjoying this recipe again.

I enjoyed the fish very much. Next time I'll use less balsamic or more honey or both. And I'll make more sauce, and thicken it less.

This wasn't bad, but it didn't have a very distinctive flavor.  I followed the recipe as written, but did not use the oregano, and took the garlic out of the pan once it had browned.  I used wild salmon, which was of course delicious, but the glaze was not really anything special.

I thought this tasted good, but it looked horrible. The salmon was black from the vinegar and looked rotten. It tasted good, but you eat with your eyes first.

I recently tried this recipe but modified it slighty, using more honey and bringing the sauce to a thicker consistency. It was great! I used it on veggie burgers, shrimp and salmon!

This salmon recipe was outstanding. I made it for my fiance and he said it was not only the best salmon he'd ever had in his life but one of the best things I've ever cooked. So, thank you! I noticed one reviewer mentioned that the glaze was too thin. I noticed that as well, but I let it cool for a minute after it simmered and it really thickened up. I will no doubt be making this again.

A full five stars for a restaurant-quality main dish that uses on-hand ingredients, requires no marinating and is quick & easy. I followed the recipe as directed (except for using less garlic to suit our personal tastes). Very satisfied. My husband & I enjoy salmon & I have several recipes that I rotate on a regular basis. This one will definitely be added to the short list of favorites. 

A "no-brainer" suggestion is to start with a quality piece of salmon. This is a delicately flavored glaze and really allows the flavor of the salmon to come through; so it's very important that your salmon be fresh. I garnished with fresh lemon slices - also to suit our personal tastes. 

Super recipe - for expert or novice cook alike.

I have been married 15 years and had never invited my in-laws over for dinner.  Well, my 13 year old took his first fishing trip out into Lake Michigan and came home with a lot of salmon.  My in-laws had their first dinner at my house that night and this is the recipe my husband chose for me to make.  PERFECT AND IMPRESSIVE.  My father-in-law said, "This is better than we get in the restaurant".  Mother-in-laws never give compliments, as we all know, but her request for seconds was enough for me to know I had impressed her.  Of course my salmon was very fresh and was alive just hours before, but the glaze is what made it.  I didn't change a thing and it was so good.  It will be a keeper in my recipe box.  As a matter of fact I am making it again tonight.

I am always looking for new fish recipes that are easy to make.  This was a wonderful dish and it was so easy to make.  I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with Pan-fried asparagus from this site and it was an excellent dinner.

this was very good, even though I didn't have any white wine. I cooked mine under the grill for 10-12 minutes, and it was perfect. I served it with a spinach and strawberry salad from this site, which was also a 5 star recipe. Very light and satisfying meal for summer. Thanks!

I can not believe a dish this easy can taste this good! Not only is it easy to make but when u're done, u only end up with about 3 pieces of dishes from making the recipe :) I made it on chicken and used the  sauce of 6 servings for 4 boneless chicken breast pieces. (I like more sauce on stuff) I used dried oregano on top and lemon juice instead of white wine (chicken broth would've worked too but it wasn't worth opening a can of broth 4 the little bit required in the recipe). I cooked the chicken for about 30 min & it was toooo dry. I'll definitely make this again but will watch out & try to cook the chicken less. This recipe is now on my rotation of things to cook often.

Will definitely be making this again.  The whole family loved it, even the hubby who wasn't sure at first.  I didn't add all the mustard, my daughter isn't a big mustard fan, but I think it would have been even better if I had made the recipe as is.  thanks!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! This was my first attempt at fish and I was so impressed with myself. It was so easy to prepare. I follow the directions as written and I just loved it. It made for a really nice dinner for my boyfriend and I. We paired it with the honey glazed carrots and peas from this site, some fresh bread, and wine.

This was certainly flavorful, but a bit too much so - the vinegar was overly strong and drowned out the other tastes. I'd double the other ingredients and leave the vinegar the same if I'd make this again.

I'm always looking for salmon recipes that will please my husband, as I love salmon and he doesn't - plus it's good for you. He did rave over this one so I'll be making it again. He doesn't like dishes that are too sweet or too vinegary, and this one had just the right balance. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except that I used olive oil for cooking the garlic. I feel this recipe can be tweaked for individual preferences (sweeter or less sweet) by changing the ingredient proportions. I agree with some that this isn't really a glaze, but more of a sauce, which is fine with me as you can use what's left over for adding to your side dish. Next time I'll try adding the ginger as others have suggested. Thanks for sharing!

Fast and easy. I took the suggestion of others and added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger, and basted the salmon with the glaze halfway through cooking. It took longer than 14 minutes though because it was a large steak.

I have a few salmon recipes that are staples in the house, but I'm always on the hunt for more.  I didn't have any white wine in the house, so I took the advice of some of the other reviewers thinking it wouldn't make much of a difference.  I felt this recipe was very bland for my taste.  It seems like many others like it which is great, but I'll never try it again.

Just made this tonight - it was great!  Disagree with some reviews, it is very flavorful, just not sweet (I followed the recipe exactly).  So easy and fast.  I will definitely make this again.

Phenomenal recipe!!!...albeit with a couple of changes. My girlfriend and I don't like Dijon mustard, so I scratched that, and it seemed like 4 garlic gloves was a bit much, so I cut that by half. Rather than pouring the crude glaze over the salmon prior to baking, I strained the garlic bits first. Lastly, I felt that fresh oregano would look nicer, so I added the flakes about a couple of minutes prior to the salmon being cooked through. My girlfriend absolutely loved this recipe. I recommend using balsamic crust in the pan to flavor some greens.

Really tasty, healthy meal - I added a sprinkle of rosemary and red pepper flakes for a little kick.  And made double the sauce, which was perfect.  Served with sauteed spinach and brown rice.

I didn't have white wine, so I substituted a T. of water, and it still came out delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, the salmon came out perfectly.

My husband LOVES salmon and while I eat it, I'm not a huge fan. I do try to cook it often for him, though, so I'm always looking for new ways to cook it. That said, I liked that this recipe reduced the salmon "fishy" taste, so I would recommend this for anyone looking for a crowd pleaser. My salmon-loving hubby enjoyed it, as did I. Fairly easy to make, and a very versatile glaze.

However, while this was definitely tasty and a nice change, it didn't blow me away. My husband liked it as well, but he agreed that is was good...just not amazing. 

One other little note: I think next time I might use olive oil instead of cooking spray to soften the garlic as I found it burned rather quickly in the spray, even on low heat.

I followed the recipe exactly, but am giving it 3 stars. I thought this lacked salt (maybe my own fault), and lacked something overall... but I can't quite put my finger on what. It was more bland than I thought it would be, even after drenching the salmon with more glaze after baking. Also, the skin did not stick to the aluminum foil as was said in the recipe. I probably would not make it again.

Well, after reading all the rave reviews this recipe got I was expecting something really special.  I was very disappointed.  While my guests liked the dish alot, my husband and I thought it was way too bland.  Perhaps if I had used a balsamic vinaigrette dressing it would have been tangier.  I did bake the fish with all of the glaze on top as another reader suggested thinking the glaze would act as a marinade and the fish would pick up more flavor but it didn't.  Two stars are because my guests liked it but I don't think I'll make it again.  Sorry.

Very easy and delicious.  I did not have white wine or dijon mustard so I replaced it with regular mustard and half a lemon. It even passed the kids test!

My husband thought this should be a 5, whereas I thought a 4. He said it was the best balsamic sauce he's had. I like my fish with just a little seasoning, but this was good. We'll make again because it was so easy, & a change in taste.

Great recipe.  Simple, quick, and tasty.  Used Spicy Brown mustard instead of Dijon and dried garlic instead of fresh, and it still tasted great.  Would definitely make it again.

I got this recipe out for my husband to do while we had guests. He usually does fish on the BBQ. He used the recipe exactly as presented. This had a fantastic flavor, moist, and a great change from plain Salmon. Have saved it to use it again, and again. He said he would never BBQ salmon again because it dried out and this was Perfect!

I gave this three stars as some family members loved it while others did not like it at all.  I used sockeye salmon which has a stronger flavor - maybe I'll use a king salmon next time.  Easy.

My husband and I agree that this recipe is just ok.  I think it would have been better if we would have marinated it for a few hours.  It wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again.

Make sure to cook at time/temp stated in recipe.  The defrosted frozen fillets we used the first time were a little dry, due to overcooking (too high temp, 1-2 mins too long in oven).

This was really yummy. I followed other reviews and cut the balsamic down, i used a bit less than 1/4 cup and that was plenty. Next time I'll cut it down a little more. Otherwise it was perfect, great colour, and the fish was soooo moist. Thanks!!

I didn't find this recipe exceptional. One reviewer mentioned that you have to get past the smell of the Balsamic mixture cooking. I guess that I couldn't get past that smell, since it tasted like the mixture smelled.

This was good, but I think next time I'll just poor the glaze over the cooked fillets instead of brushing it on before. Saves time and no juice will be waisted.

This was an excellent recipe. It looks kind of gross because the vinegar makes it look blackish, but the taste is great. I don't know how they got the picture to look so nice. Anyway, I'd recommend it.

The balsamic vinegar is very strong.  The sauce that cooked with the meat was tastier than the left over to pour on top.  Maybe the salmon should marinate on the sauce for a little while to get a bit more flavor.

This was a good recipe however, the balsamic flavor was a little overwhelming and we love balsamic!  Next time I'll increase the honey and the garlic.  Overall, this was pretty tasty.

This sauce was WAY too overpowering.  The vinegar-y smell/taste never went away.  In the end, I just threw out the leftovers because I knew I would not want to eat any more.  Although my friend (who ate it with me) said it was very good, he only had a small serving and did not ask for seconds, so there you have it.

This recipe has been in my files for a long, long time and is always a success. Have tried it with farmed and wild salmon, but still retains all its goodness of flavor.    Usually serve it with brown rice cooked in orange juice and tarragon.  This is an interesting combination, but definitely serve a plain vegetable (or vegetables) on the side.

This was good and simple.  I did not use the oregano because I'm not a big fan of the herb.  Easy and tastey.  Thanks for sharing.

I enjoyed this, but I also like my fish to taste 'fishy' and this glaze hid the 'fishy' taste too much for my taste.  If you prefer not to have such a 'fishy' taste, then you will enjoy this glaze.

This recipe was fabulous!!!!  I've made it with both Salmon and Chicken and my family loved it!  I had to laugh because like another member, my family said the glaze had a "Stink" but when the meal was served they loved every bite!

Good recipe, but I accidentally used too few pieces of fish for the amount of glaze made.  Was a little much.  May try again with the right proportions, but I prefer a lighter, more citrus flavor with salmon.

I thought this was really good. It was very easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand (except for the salmon!). Makes a great light meal with rice and roasted veggies. I will likely make this again.

This is good and easy, but just not special enough to give a higher rating. I don't feel that it has enough flavor, and what I can taste is a little too much on the sweet side for me. I much prefer the recipe for Asian salmon from this site.

I made this recipe twice tonight and it was great both times. (long story)

First, I marinated the salmon for about 6 hours in the mixture (no changes) and my DH grilled it. The parts that made it off the grill (he slightly overcooked it and then managed to drop half of it into the grill) had a wonderful flavor to them. 

Since we ended up with less than a piece of salmon between us, I ended up making another piece. This time, we followed the directions on the recipe (using the reduction as a glaze) and that came out excellent as well. 

We both love salmon and we liked that the flavor of the salmon still came out. 

Great recipe.

This was really yummy.  I added chopped onions to the balsamic mixture.  I let it reduce a little longer than three minutes as well.  It's also very pertinent that you use foil on your cookie sheet!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a salmon recipe using balsmic vinegar.  This was easy and was a great change from my usual herbs/lemon juice salmon.  I'll definitely make again!  I didn't make any changes, although next time I think I'll make extra.

I can't say enough about this recipe!!  It's super yummy!!  I was very hesitant to try it because I like salmon with butter, lemon, salt & pepper - nothing else.  Easy to see why my family could get bored with that.  I gave it a shot and let's just say I'll have to find another use for all those lemons!  My family loved it!  Even my super-finicky 6-yr-old!  My only change was to use balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing since that's what I had on hand.  Thus, I left out the oregano.  (I love lisawolfmd's idea of putting the salmon & a little extra sauce over some pasta.  That sounds delish.)  Without a doubt, my fishmonger will get to know me well!

Fantastic recipe.  We eat a lot of salmon and this was well received.

I had a tail of salmon and did this with it. My husband loves salmon and is very picky about how it is prepared...and he really liked this way!

Sweeter than I expected.  I liked it.  I only made 4 fillets, but still had to cook it about 4 minutes longer than the recipe said.

I made this tonight for the first time and it was very good.  I substituted fresh rosemary for the oregano.  I also used less balsamic vinegar than 1/3 cup, maybe 1/4 cup instead, because that was all I had!  I compensated by adding some red wine vinegar.  I kept my salmon fillet whole, so it took longer to cook (about 18 minutes) but it was worth the wait!  Very flavorful, moist and delicious.

Good, but I think I prefer balsamic glaze on chicken and prefer something lighter on fish.

Oh my gosh!!! This recipe is so good. I only used 2 fillets so we had extra sauce and put the salmon and the sauce on top of pasta along with some faccacia bread. This was like something I would get at Macaroni Grill. Just great!

My wife and I tried this. we followed the recipe as written and found that it was very VERY tasty! The only suggestion from my wife was that next time she wants we to make double the glaze. we will be adding this to our regular rotation of family foods! Thanks!

Nice change!  Cook the salmon based on the thickness of the meat.  I overcooked mine a bit at 10 minutes, but I enjoyed the glaze.  I used honey mustard instead of dijon since I didn't have any on hand.

This was my first time cooking fish and this recipe was so easy and tasty!  My husband doesn't like Balsamic Vinegar, but he really enjoyed this recipe.  Some people have suggested adding more honey, but we followed the recipe exactly and thought it was sweet enough.  We'll be using it next time company comes.

I made this and my family loved it.  I did let the marinade sit on the salmon for about 20 minutes and I also grilled the salmon instead of broiling it.  I will definitely make this again.
