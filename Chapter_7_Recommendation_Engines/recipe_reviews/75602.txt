This salad was a big hit.  The taste is like caramel apples.  So many people loved it in place of coleslaw.  How these flavors blend to give the taste of the caramel apples is amazing.  Thanks for sharing this unique salad recipe.

Delicious salad! I used 2 Granny Smith apples and 2 Red Delicious apples. As someone else suggested, I added colored marshmallows, then topped the salad with pineapple slices drizzled with caramel sauce. I plan to make this again for my next gathering.

This was very tastey.  I only sliced the apples and didn't chop them.  It still tasted great, but would be better with smaller apples.

WOW!!!  This is the best.  I can't believe how the ingredients come together to taste so different.  I have tried several different kinds of apples, but the granny smith work the best.  Have recieved many compliments on this salad, so I feel it is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

This was tasty- not as sweet as I had hoped (didn't try the marshmallows or caramel sauce but great idea!) so added chopped up Snickers instead. Very refreshing recipe. Guests loved it so that's always a good sign!

This is a delicious sweet salad with easy ingredients.  I didn't think the flavor from the sugar/vinegar/pineapple would be that noticeable, it doesn't make very much.  But wow, a caramel flavor does come of it!  I do think small apple pieces are the way to go and also added the mini marshmallows to the top and drizzled on caramel sauce.  Looked very nice on the table for the holiday.  Try this one!!

Excellent for family gathering. I used Splenda and Sugar-free Cool whip, was not as sweet. Plus I added an extra cup of apples.

DELICIOUS!! I tasted this salad at a picnic and I was certain it had cut up candied apples rolled in nuts.  I was SO happy to find this recipe and am still amazed that it tastes just like candy apples.  Definitely a keeper for summer picnics.  :)

I was going to a large halloween party so I used a bag of macintosh apples, left skin on for color, doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 Tblsp cinnamon. Now it tastes like a caramel apple. Amazing!

Candy Apple Salad? Sorry, can't say that it tasted like candy apples at all. However, my cooking class enjoyed it and the peanuts seemed to knock their socks off, a very nice touch; pleasant, mild flavour to this salad.

I could not believe how easy and how wonderful this salad is.  The first time I made it, my family couldn't wait to dive in. Then once they tasted it, it was heaven to their taste buds.  I used this as a side dish with dinner, but I think it is better suited as a dessert, because it just as that candy apple at the Fair feel. Absolutely fantastic. You must try this one.  You will not be disappointed.

Made this for a potluck and it was delicious!  It was a last minute,  "What can I make with what I've got on hand? "  I  ran pineapple chunks in the blender to make crushed pineapple.   I substituted in plain fat free yogurt for the thawed whipped cream so it likely would have only been better if I had the whipped cream.  Came together quickly,  less than 1 hour including cooling.

Not sure it tasted like a candy apple, but it was very tasty and easy to make. I liked that it was mostly a made from scratch recipe. There are a lot of recipes that use instant pudding as a base and add different ingredients to the dry pudding. While this does use Cool Whip, everything else is “real”. You can use this recipe as a base and use different add ins( grapes, mandarin oranges, bananas are just some possibilities).

I thought this was okay, but noone else would eat it. I brought it to our Halloween party, and ended up bringing the whole bowl back home. I don't think it was the fault of the recipe though. I think that people were confused as to what this actually was. Someone even asked me if it was potato salad!

It was a quick and easy recipe . Everyone seemed to like it. The bowl was empty by the time dinner was over. I reduced the amount of sugar some. It made it not so sweet. A big hit. I will make this again.

This was a really great & easy recipe!! I enjoyed it very much and I plan to make it over again and again in the future. I did add marshmallows and it was great.
