This was very good, however, it was way too salty for us.  I don't think I'd add any of the salt at first next time, and would just salt to taste afterwards.  I did have to substitute a mixture of chopped spring onions and white onions for the leeks, since I didn't have any, and I only had dried tarragon on hand so I used 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp.  The flavor was good other than the salt issue.  It's great to have a new use for all of the heads of lettuce we have been getting from our csa!

OMG, who would have thought *lettuce* soup would taste so darn good!  I used a romaine, leeks and tarragon from my garden.  The lettuce was a little tough from being left in the ground too long, so I had to find another use for it besides salad.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly!  I cut the unsalted butter to 2 tbsp., used low sodium chicken broth, and I only added 1 tsp. of salt, which was the perfect amount in my opinion.  I also did not blend it, preferring to leave it chunky, and I'm glad I did it that way.  No yogurt or sour cream needed!  It's fantastic as is.  You definitely have to like tarragon, though, which I do.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Very yummy. Worth making again... I added a little crumbled bacon, and it was perfectly delightful.

Good flavor blend but the texture and appearance is not very appealing

I really liked this soup.  My tarrigon was late season in a dry year, so I cut it back to about half the suggested amount.  And I added a dollup of plain yogurt (sour cream would do as well) to the soup after dishing into the bowls.

The soup was lovely! A perfect light soup for summer, when your garden is producing so much lettuce that if you see another salad you'll scream:)
I used all the lettuces that were getting to large. Meuslun mix, romain and butter/bib. Had no leeks so used a combo of a bit of onion and some scallions. 3 small cloves of comfey garlic, salted butter and organic chicken stock, so added no salt till just before serving. It needed a pinch, along with the pepper. I always use an immersion blender, easier and  mess/cleanup. The tarragon was a terrific touch, though I wonder what adding mint one time would be like, having way more mint growing then the tarragon.

This is amazing. Wonderful, interesting flavors, and you can use any green leafy veggie instead of lettuce. Kale or collard greens are great to use for extra nutrition; just increase your cooking time to ten minutes instead of five.

It was good but not very hearty if you know what I mean.  I used spinach instead of lettuce to give it more nutrition.  If you have my luck, you'll have green soup splattered all over the kitchen when you use the blender...it's fine with chunks.  I put my spinach through the food processor before I added it to the pot.

Wow, suprisingly delicious and easy!  I added halved cherry tomatos the last 5 minutes of cooking (after pureeing it), bits of crisp bacon, and shredded Fontana cheese; the recipe doesn't need it at all, but it was even more delicious!  Enjoy :)

Delicious! The flavor is wonderful. I did not have leeks on hand so I used onions instead. It turned out very tasty and froze well. What a great way to use up an abundance of leafy greens! I will be making this again.

It's really good but I thought it needed a little more flavor. I added some curry powder, more garlic, a hit of Worcestershire sauce and fresh parm cheese. I really love a warm sloppy green in my soup, so I did not fully blend it. The larger chunks of lettuce gave you something to chomp into.

Very good and a delightful way to use up greens that are getting old.  It would have been 5 stars, except the salt indicated in the recipe will makes it too salty.  I don't use any salt, just a little pepper.  Works well with dried tarragon if you don't have any fresh on hand.
