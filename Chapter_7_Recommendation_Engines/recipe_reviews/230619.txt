I'm laying on the couch absolutely stuffed on this soup...  It was so good it may have killed me.  O.o  To the poster.  I'm pretty sure (almost positive) that if you substitute veggie for chicken stock its vegetarian, if you remove the sour cream from it it should be VEGAN if I'm not mistaken :))))! (only about 80% sure on that). This soup DESERVES its 5 star ratings.  It not only serves as a perfectly tasty recipe stand alone it is SUPER versatile!  I made my BB's from scratch used half of my own homemade salsa and half a can of tomatoes because I'm bad and didn't see they didn't have green chilies in them.   Topped it with a tiny bit of cheddar, sour cream, and cilantro...  AMAZING!! Thanks a ton.

I loved this!  I hate it when people give a recipe 5 stars and then make a bunch of changes, but I do have to agree with another reviewer in that next time I will only put 1 can of beans in the blender and use 2 whole.  Also, I didn't add the cayenne because I have young kids, but it was spicy enough without it.  Last, I omitted the salt.  I figured there was enough between the broth and the canned beans.

I would have given it 5 stars - it is delicious - but I wished that the ingredients were listed better.  I saw 2 cans of beans and as I
followed the recipe I got down to another can needed (luckily I did not have to run out as I had one more).  It would have been so much easier to list 3 cans in the beginning.  Also I added some oregano and more cumin.  Really good!

LOVED how easy this was!  I kicked up the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and only used 1 can of chicken broth.  I wanted a thicker soup so adding the second can would have made it thinner.  We topped the soup with mexican cheese, sour cream, scallion and fresh cilantro!   The rice isn't needed but if you use two cans of broth, you might need it.

I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and only 2 cups of broth. It was quick and delicious with cheese and sour cream on top and cornbread.

Absoloutely delicious! I used only 1 can chicken broth and used salsa instead of tomatoes with chiles. Had to improvise what I had on hand. Recipe was fantastic! I added greek yogurt in place of sour cream and also to my own bowl, I added fresh diced avocado. Absoloutely perfect!Definitely a favorite soup!

Great for work night. I didn't have all ingredients but it is a strong soup and is able to be tweaked. I sautéed 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 celery, couple minced cloves garlic in oil. Threw in the beans, cumin. I didn't have stock so created miso broth with a bit of tamari. Also, only had puréed tomatoes. I used a soup purée-er to disguise all those good veggies that my kids reject in soups, then added the miso broth. Love the addition of another can of whole beans. We ate the whole thing with melted cheese on bread, cutup cantaloupe. Yum yum.

This may be soup from cans but, it is so delicious. I would give it more stars if I could. I served it with the cilantro lime rice also from AR. I will probably be making this in the middle summer.

The simplicity of the recipe appealed but I overlooked the step about draining the beans so I had a very thin soup. I boiled it down on medium heat until it reduced and thickened. Then it was delicious but I do think the amount of pepper and cayenne made it far too spicy for many tastes and should have been optional to taste.

As to Fran's rating that said it was too high in sodium, with lower sodium choices in beans and broth, that was easily adjusted. And I agree with others who said salt could be omitted. I enjoyed adding chopped green onions and cheese.

This was REALLY good. Even the hubs, who is not usually a fan of meatless dishes, enjoyed it. I made it pretty much as directed, and I think next time I will cut back on the salt and leave out the cayenne pepper (as it seemed a bit too salty and had a bit too much burn for my taste). There will definitely be a next time--this one's a keeper.

For Fran's concerns about the sodium ( it's very high) has anyone tried  it without the salt and low sodium broth ? I don't know if Rotel comes low sodium but diced tomatoes do and maybe add fresh roasted poblanos? Rinse the beans before blending? I don't know if it would make the soup completely different?

I mistakenly made this with kidney beans—the cans look alike. Duh. But it was terrific! I did use three cans of beans, but just one cup or so of turkey broth, and took some reviewers’ suggestions to tweak it. I’ll be making it again. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I've made this recipe several times now, and I tend to leave out the cayenne and chili pepper, because I prefer it less spicy.  Otherwise, it's wonderful.  Quick, easy, and yum.  The recipe doubles well.

I love the fact that this is so easy to make and can be done quickly. My husband really doesn't like spicy food so I omitted the cayenne and cut the tomatoes and peppers (Rotel) back to about 5 ounces. I did add some canned diced tomatoes to replace the spicy stuff. I also omitted the rice because, as a diabetic, I don't need the carbs. All that is to say it still tastes good. It's a great recipe to have as we head into winter.

Really tasty and so easy to make! I stock up on canned goods when they go on sale, so I was able to make this inexpensively and conveniently with things I already had on hand.

I used homemade vegetable broth  for this, left out the cayenne (I don't like things too spicy) and used 2 tspns cumin instead of 1 1/2. 

I thoroughly rinsed the beans and added one can of corn to the final pot.

I really enjoyed it with the rice and sour cream but you could eat it without!!

I haven't bought canned beans since we purchased an Instantpot.  So I cooked a one pound bag of black beans in 6 cups of water (no salt) and pushed the bean button twice for a total of 1 hour.  the beans were really soft and ready to go.  used 4 cups cooked beans into blender plus 1 cup of broth.  had 4 cups of chicken broth from a leftover chicken carcass.  adjusted the black pepper and salt.  and we were ready to go.  the second time, we omitted the diced tomatoes/chili peppers and cayenne and liked it even more.  .

I made ingredient alterations to suit our tastebuds and what we had on hand, including adding a can of drained whole kernel corn. But followed cooking directions closely. This is Fabulous. very easy to alter heat depending on taste. Thank you for sharing!

This is so easy and incredibly tasty. It doesn’t seem like much as you are cooking. It is so satisfying.

This is really good. I puréed all the cans of beans instead of adding the last can as is. The tomatoes with chilies gave it a nice hint of heat. Great recipe.

This was a great soup. The seasoning and flavour were perfect. I prefer a thicker soup so didn’t use any bean water and for liquid I only added about 1/2 cup water in addition to the liquid in the can of tomatoes. Cooked dried beans worked well for this recipe.

Would reduce the vegetable or chicken broth to make a bit thicker and use only 1 can of beans in blender.

The family loved this soup and will definitely make it again. The only thing I did differently was add a little more cayenne, add the cooked rice to my soup pot and one extra cup of chicken stock. It was great!

The only thing I do differently from recipe is blend 1 can of beans. With the broth & diced tomatoes, it is liquid enough.

Such good soup, but I can only give it 4 stars because I altered it so much.  I am certain it will be good exactly as shown and I plan to make it again that way, but I wanted to use stuff that I had on hand: home-cooked kidney beans in place of black beans, homemade chicken stock, stirred in leftover rotisserie chicken and a bit of frozen corn.

Good recipe.  I used veg stock but I think chicken would have added a better flavor.  Next time I will use chicken.  I also added a drained can of corn and red pepper mix for some added texture.  Very filling meat free meal.  Served with a baguette.  Next time I'm serving with tortilla chips on the side.

Well, basically tasted okay, but very bland so I doubled the cumin, doubled the cayenne and then added several 
Blended jalapenos and the juice.  Good idea to serve it over rice as it is much thinner black bean soup than I have made in the past.   Doubt if I will  make it again.   As I read the other reviews I wonder how others can give it 5 stars when they have made substitutions and or changes?

Delicious.  The only change I made was to add corn and a few tablespoons of mild salsa (my diced tomatoes didn't have green chilis so this was my alternative).  I served it with a bit of cheese on top.  MMmmmmmm!

This was an easy recipe and tasty!  I had to alter the recipe based on what I had in the cabinet.  I only had diced tomatoes (fire roasted without chilis)  and I did not have cayenne pepper.

I blended 2 cans of black beans with the suggested ingredients (minus the 2 listed above).  I also used just one cup of chicken stock and omitted the 3rd can b/c I wanted less servings.  

I added a scoop of cream fresh, and stirred in the rice (I used Basmati).  The soup was creamy (not soupy) and had great flavor!

My kids and family loved it!

Delicious, quick and easy!  It takes longer to get together the toppings you want than to get the soup on the stove. Plus, I didn't have to cook the rice since I had some on hand in the frig.  (I always keep some cooked rice in the freezer for an emergency ingredient but didn't have to use it this time.)  I made exactly as written, except cutting the red pepper to 1/4 tsp because my elderly Mom can't stand heat.  I will definitely make again but will try blending less beans -  maybe blending just one can instead of two cans - since I felt the soup needed more whole beans.  Thanks for such a quick recipe!  It was a lifesaver last night when I was late from work.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and used less to make it thicker.  I also didn't have tomatoes with chilies, so I substituted plain tomatoes.  This worked fine because there was enough other types of pepper in the recipes it still had a nice bite.  I topped it with fresh tomatoes and avocado.
