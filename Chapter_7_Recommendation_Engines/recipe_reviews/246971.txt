I am adding to my previous comment that I now cook this in my Insta Pot pressure cooker. So much easier and faster with less watching the liquid level. The lentils came out so much softer and well cooked. I highly suggest pressure cooking this recipe.

Definitely some sun to warm up your cloudy day.  I used cooked green lentils, so I was able to maintain the cooking time more or less.  I added a touch of apple cider vinegar at the end and topped the whole thing with some coconut cream. Thank you for the recipe.

So delicious!  I can't stop eating it.  I threw all of the ingredients in the instant pot, added veggie broth instead of water, and did what another reviewer did- instead of shredded coconut (had none on hand) I added 2 T of coconut oil, and 2 t sugar.  After it was done I I threw in a can of chick peas and a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cayenne.  Next time I'll try with a coconut milk instead of veggie broth like another reviewer mentioned.  I might add quinoa also next time.  Definitely will be making this again.

I was recently diagnosed with high LDL so am trying to decrease my animal protein and increase my legumes and whole grains so thought I would give this a shot.  I honestly found this to be quite bland at first but it was an easy fix for me.  A little lime juice and cilantro and it added a lot of freshness to it.  I will keep playing around with this because I think there is a lot of potential for this recipe.

This soup is delicious!! I did make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and added 8 cups of vegetable broth, added 1 cup of greek yogurt, added 1/2 cup of cilantro, and a bag of frozen paneer cubes.   I will definitely make this again.

Wow, this was SO delicious! I didn't have shredded coconut on hand. Instead I added a few tsp of sugar and a tblsp of coconut oil. The oil really gave it a nice, subtle flavor, and I'd use it again. 
As the submitter mentioned, I did have to keep adding water, just for more liquid and not to have it stick to the pan. It was just a tad mushy at 20 min, so I'd reduce that time. Thanks for this definite keeper recipe!

This recipe is good. I just opted for pre cooking the lentils and using chicken broth. However, I would like it a bit thicker. It it my first time trying red lentils so I will have to learn to work with them.

Really really enjoyed this! I served it on top of steamed Jasmine rice. Did not use any oil and just left the onions to cook into the tomato juice. Also used vegetable broth which simmered down nicely during the cooking. Used a whole pepper which I roasted for about 45 minutes at 375F before incorporating it into the stew. Added fennel seeds, chili flakes, and thyme instead of tarragon because I did not have the latter on hand. Really good dish :)

This is a great, quick recipe! We made a couple of adjustments--I used veggie broth instead of water and put in a little extra to make it soupier, subbed in oregano because we were out of tarragon, and used tomatoes with green chilies instead of plain--and it turned out amazing. I'd never had coconut strings in a main dish before, but they added amazing texture and flavor.

I loved this recipe. So to have some leftovers I doubled it. I added a can of coconut milk and since I like spicy dishes I doubled the curry and added cayenne to taste.

Used already cooked lentils, fire roasted tomatoes and coconut milk instead of water. We really enjoyed the flavor of this stew.
