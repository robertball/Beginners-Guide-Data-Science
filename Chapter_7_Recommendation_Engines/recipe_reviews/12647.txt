We were given a Jicama by a hispanic friend, and had no idea how to prepare it.  This was the only recipe we could find.  It really turned out quite good.  We didn't have sherry, so we substituted Marsallis wine instead.  The only thing I would do differently is to use squeeze margarine instead of stick margarine pats on the top.  In our pie, the margarine pooled together under the broiler, then hardened into solid chunks when the pie cooled.

I made this recipe and added the photo above.  I cut down on the sugar and it was still a little too sweet, so sweeten to taste.  I did it for a dinner party just to do something different.  It was creamy and different alright.  The guests loved it and said that the jicama had the consistency of coconut. Also, serving it warm is the best way to go.
