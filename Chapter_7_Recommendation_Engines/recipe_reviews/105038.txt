Hi everyone, this is my recipe, and I wanted to say thanks for the generally positive reviews and to offer an explanation for the issue of saltiness. First off, this recipe is designed to be on the salty side, but certainly not to the degree of being offensive. As kosher salt is called for remember kosher salt contains less salt per teaspoon, and different brands of salt vary further. I also made a mistake in writing out the recipe, because while I measure the 1 Tbsp salt in the dough, I just sprinkle some on top without measuring it. When I typed up the recipe I think I put something like "1/2 - 1 Tbsp," but Allrecipes doesn't like varied ammounts so they chose the upper limit when they edited this recipe. Just use what you want on top, but I do recommend the 1 Tbsp kosher in the dough. As a note, they edited the recipe quite a lot.  I think the entire "directions" section is unrecognizable as something I would write, and the ingredients have mostly just been standardized (like saying 1/2 c. onion, rather than 1 small onion) and defined (like saying 3 Tbsp olive oil instead of "some more olive oil"). I appologize if the one hour claim is a bit optimistic. It can be done if you have particularly happy yeast or are in a hurry, but I realize often it takes longer. Obviously everyone has figured out the possibilities of inclusions, and I will let you in on one of my all time favorites: kalamata olives. I still make this all the time, but often just onionless dough for pizza.

This is a great recipe. I changed 2 things. First was I used 2 1/2 cups of a.p. flour and semolina for the remainder. It seemed to me that raw onion may come out a little strong for my family's taste buds so I sauteed them first. I drained them and cooled them prior to adding to the recipe. Everyone thought this one of the best recipes they have tasted in a long time.

This would of been great if it wasn't ruined by too much salt in the topping! I did as the recipe states and added 1 tablespoon of salt sprinkled ontop, along with olive oil and parmesan cheese.This totally ruined the bread because it was way too salty! Other than that, it is a good recipe. Very easy. I omitted the onion and used garlic powder. I baked it on parchment paper instead of an oiled sheet, much easier clean up that way. I will try this again, but will use 1 teaspoon of salt ontop next time. UPDATE-- I made this again and used about 1 tsp of salt in the topping instead of 1 Tbls. Much better! I will be making this quite often!

I made this last night, and it was delicious.  I topped it with some red onion, fresh tomato, grated basil & mozarella cheese, grated parmesan cheese, sliced olives, chopped garlic, dried basil, and kosher salt.

My only problem was the size of the pan I used -- a 9 x 13, and the bread was very thick.  Next time I'll do that part differently, but the taste was wonderful.  Thank you!

I added thin strips of green onion to the dough.  I split the dough in half and shaped each half into flat oblong loaves on greased cookie sheets.  This worked perfectly and the sizes were wonderful.  The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

Great base recipe!  The second time I made it I put onion and garlic in the dough, and topped with parmesan and cheddar cheese.

RE: "Happy yeast"

Who doesn't love a spa--yeast probably more than most. I think how to achieve "happy" yeast is very well explained by Anne Burrell in her focaccia recipe. "Put the bowl in a WARM, NOT HOT OR COOL, PLACE until the yeast is bubbling and aromatic...". 

This applies, not only to proofing your yeast, but raising your dough too. They taught me in both cooking and biology class that yeast LOVE warm, not hot or cool, places and respond to them accordingly.

So if you're feeling chilly when you set out to make your focaccia bread, try preheating your oven to warm, and then turning it off when it gets there. Before you put your covered dough in the oven, first check it by inserting your bare arm. If it feels "warm, not hot" to you, then your yeast should love it too, and your covered focaccaia should rise quickly in the cooling, but still warm, oven.

This foccacia bread is very good! I added the red onions, a sprinkle of roasted garlic and fresh grated parmesan reggiano cheese to the dough. No one in my family really cared for the feta . I let the dough rise about 30 mins, then I used parchment paper to line a baking sheet. I placed the oiled dough onto the sheet, flattened and spread the dough evenly towards the edge of the baking sheet. There was enough dough to cover the entire baking sheet. I brushed the top of the bread with olive oil, added the rosemary, some fresh basil, garlic, parmesan reggiano, then a little hawaiian sea salt instead of the 1T kosher salt. The foccacia bread baked up real nice! Not only could I smell it but so did other family members. The bread rose up as it was baking and turned a golden brown color. I can smell the fresh herbs and the scent of bread baking...Mmm. In 20 mins. I had a beautiful foccacia bread! It is so pretty with all the specks of green herbs scattered all over the top. I can see the cheese baked right into the top of the bread. I am pleased with the way this recipe turned out. The top has a nice crispy exterior and is evenly flavored-nothing too salty or overpowering. The seasonings were just right - all fresh garden grown herbs! And the cheese was melted perfectly with the herbs. The bread itself was warm, soft and fresh tasting! There were only three of us to eat this delicious bread and we all did pretty good. I even have enough leftovers to make a sandwiches out of.

I always screw bread up, but this turned out just the way I wanted it... I made half a batch, (exactly as the recipe says to make it) and spread it thin on a cookie sheet and baked it for about 15 minutes, (it was like a flatbread), then cut it into sandwich size pieces and made grilled paninis with sundried tomatoes, mozzarella, arugala, avocado, red bell peppers, and the dressing from (California Grilled Veggie Sandwich).  My husband and I agreed, it is the best sandwich we've EVER had! 100 stars!

Great bread - nice and light.  A bit on the salty side but we'll adjust it next time.

This bread was a hit with my family.  Some comments based on the reviews: the onion will cook with the bread, so there's no need to cook it ahead of time.  I was concerned about the amount of salt, so I reduced it, and it was good with less.  I think I would have personally preferred more salt, but some of my family members didn't want more.  Don't make it in a 9x13 pan.  Use your largest cookie sheet or a jellyroll pan unless you want the bread to be very tall.  You can change the toppings according to your tastes or what you have on hand.  I used seasoned salt, garlic powder, and italian seasoning.

GREAT!  HOWEVER....mine dough took one hour and 30 minutes to double in size and I stay true to the doubling.  Im not good with baking but I know it is a science so I waited and waited and waited.  Maybe it was because I live in the desert at sea level, but whatever the reason let that dough rise.  It was fantastic, thanks for the recipe and I look forward to making this again and again. (oh and I didnt add onion at all, sorry, but still great!)

This was a fast and easy bread to do.  I used a bit too much salt on the top, but that was a matter of preference.  The bread itself was very good.  This will be a staple for homemade bread.  Lots of ways to add to it too.  Thanks for another great recipe from this site!!

Best foccacia recipe hands down!  Super easy, and super tasty.  I love the fact that it can be made from start to finish in short order.  I didn't use the onion, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

The taste is wonderful, but I found this to be a little flat. Great base recipe and very fast! I made 3 loaves, 1 with Tomato/Basil, 1 with Green/Black Olives and Rosemary, and 1 with 3 Cheese Blend... brushed all loaves with garlic oil first! I did choose to leave out the onions as I chose other toppings.

This was very quick and tasty. Per reviews, I omitted the salt on top.  Used double the cheese & sprinkled it on after baking 10 minutes. Next time I will try more toppings.  Fine with dried rosemary.

This was wonderful bread. After eating some great foccacia at a restaurant, I really wanted to try making it. This recipe was very simple, almost impossible to mess up, and the bread tasted just as good as the at the restaurant.

This bread is unbelievably good! I can't believe it was that easy to make and is so good. It truly makes me wish I had found this recipe long ago. I added only 1 tsp of salt to the top and throwing some Italian seasoning and garlic in while I was kneading. I also omitted the onions, only because I didn't think it would go over well with the kiddos. Next time I think I'll do half with tomatoes and onions and the other half just with the Parmesan cheese and spices. Awesome recipe, will be a staple in our house!!!

This is delicious and looks beautiful, way better than store bought.  I added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the dough, then sprinkled a little more on top before baking.  The texture is crunchy on the outside and chewy inside, and deliciously salty.  This is surprisingly simple, with lots of the ingredients on hand.  Will be making this one more often...

This was wonderful.  Very easy to make and turned out perfectly.  I topped mine with Olive oil, kosher salt, sliced green stuffed olives, tomatoes from the farmer's maarket (sliced thinly) and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  My neighbor came over as it was baking and loved it so much that I finished up giving her half of it.  She was in heaven.  Thanks for posting.

Simply Fantastic! I followed the directions to a "T" except for adding 1 tablespoon rosemary, 1 teaspoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon thyme to the dough. I also let the dough rest for 20 minutes (giving it time to rise) before adding the topping and baking for a little less than 20 minutes at 415 degrees. Did not add any salt to the top though.

The only change I made was to omit the onion (personal preference).  This was very good but because we don’t normally use a lot of salt, I wish I didn’t add the additional salt for the top.  It was still very good and the bread had a wonderful texture.

Oh dear, really disappointed with this recipe.  This does not have the texture of foccaccia bread at all, despite following the instructions as written. The only change I made was adding dried italian herbs to the dough.  It's certainly edible, but I was hoping for a nice fluffy foccaccia that could be sliced to use for sandwiches.  This barely rose more than a pizza dough, and I did proof my yeast and knead with my KA. Used the right size pan too.  Hmmmm... maybe will try again to give it a second chance but so far, not so happy.

So Delicious, Easy, and Fast!  With an hour and half to go one night I decided I wanted fresh bread of some sort with dinner.  I didn't want to go out, so I did a quick search and found this.  From beginning to end really was just a little over an hour.  I added a tsp of sugar to the yeast and water to help the yeast out a bit.  I added a tsp of dried rosemary right to the dough, to the top I used coarsely ground sea salt, rosemary, oregano, and Parmesan cheese.  Ended up making this twice in one week.  I can see endless possibilities for the variations on this recipe.  Amazing!  It is moist and tender and makes a giant loaf.

OMG! This is delicious!!! Made this for the first time last week. We didn't put the rosemary in it because some don't care for it. We did however, add sliced green and black olives  and crushed garlic to the grated parm. It was delicious! I made it again last night and crushed the garlic directly into the dough along with the onions... topped this with shredded mozzarella, sliced tomatoes and grated parm. I put the leftovers into a ziploc bag and it was moist and delish the next day as well! Try this!

Delicious! I made a different topping based on what we had at home. Let the dough rise around 30-35 mins the first time, used half the salt in the dough and just sprinkled a little on top. It is to die for good. Thank you!!!

I baked mine a bit longer than 20 min (more like 30) but it turns out great every time!  I topped mine with caramelized onions, shredded asiago, sauteed mushrooms, and fresh sliced pears.  A surprising combination but it's DELISH!

Totally amazing, seriously. Wow. Okay......I used a garlic infused olive oil in mine and I also added a garlic and onion seasoning that I have to the dough. I broke the dough into half because I wanted to make a round foccacia. This recipe easily makes two large rounds of foccacia. As I olied my baking sheet, I sprinkled it with corn meal before placing my dough onto the sheet. The first round I added more garlic and onion seasoning along with a romano, parm. cheese mixture and the garlic oil and salt. The second round I skipped the cheese but added everything else on top and preferred that taste much more. This will become a staple. You can easily change up the flavor like I did by removing the rosemary and adding different seasonings or using an infused oil. Very highly recommend this easy to make and bake recipe!

I made this recipe for my Chef at work. Let me tell you something....it was a huge hit. I have modified it just a bit. I don't put rosemary on top. I finish it with olive oil, salt, parmasean, and a light dusting of cornmeal. Beautiful thing it is. Thank you!

I love foccacia bread and I've made it many times. This was the first time I've made it with the onions inside the dough and, admittedly, I was afraid the raw onion taste would be too strong for my kids, but that wasn't the case. My kids never even said anything about the onions, although I only used half of a small onion. This was a very good foccacia bread and I will be making it again.

Excellent!!!  I mixed rosemary in the dough in addition to sprinkling it on top.  I used a combo of Romano and Parm on top too.  Delish!  This is my go-to recipe.

It was good, not great. Certainly nice time-wise and easy to whip up but needs a little more flavour. Now I did use dried rosemary - maybe that was the problem.

This is now my bread recipe of choice.  For those who didn't add onion.  Try dicing the onion and soak in some water for a few minutes.  Takes the bite out but you still have the onions and flavor.  I also do this when making a salad.  Thanks for the recipe Michael

This was really quite good.  I thought the dough came out a bit floury.  I went with half garlic and half onion after reading some reviews.  I also halved the amount of salt I used in the recipie and on top at the end.  I'll probably add more rosemary next time I make this!

A little bit disappointed with this bread, Nice overall taste but I did find the bread to be too doughy! I love Foccacia but I guess I would much prefer a more rustic crunchy Foccacia bread.

this bread is absolutely incredible. i am not used to something so delicious being so easy! i also halved the recipe and it made plenty for my family of 6. I made a dipping sauce for it with 2 parts EVOO, 2 parts balsamic vinegar, and a tsp of minced garlic. i am never buying specialty breads again! even without the sauce, it was perfectly salty and full of flavor. I had to use bread flour because i was all out of AP, but I don't know how much a difference that could have made in this case. I like other reviewers, lessened the amount of onions just a little bit and added about a 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. *My family LOVES garlic* I just threw whatever I had on top, which was poppy seeds, dried rosemary, and a tsp of kosher salt. This recipe will become a once-a-weeker at my house.

I have made this recipe several times and love it both for its versatility as well as its speediness.  I tend to substitute sliced black olives for the additional salt on top, but I have also been known to make it with sundried tomatoes instead.  You can switch up the herbs, too.  Rosemary is terrific with the black olives but when I use the sun drieds fresh basil is amazing :)

As written, this is a good recipe. I can already tell - this will be a five star recipe with a few modifications. I agree with the other reviewers that having more of the "good stuff" mixed into the bread will really kick this up a notch. More herbs and cheese in the bread - I'm thinking about carmelizing the onions next time, and adding that with some roasted garlic and maybe a soft cheese like brie to the bread dough. Mmmm - this is a great base to experiment though!

This recipe yieled a ton of Foccacia, worked well, was super simple to put together too. Originally we had wanted homemade garlic bread with dinner. So, with garlic bread in mind, I changed a few things. Instead of chopped onion, I roasted some garlic cloves and grated onion into the smashed garlic making a paste. I would say there was about 1/4 cup of the roasted garlic, onion paste which I added in. And, instead of using rosemary on top I had an Italian Herb Blend & Herbs de Provence in my pantry, so I went with those. Very good bread & I would recommend this recipe to others.

Delicious!  I increased the chopped onion to 1 cup but I cooked the onions first before adding them.  Instead of topping with rosemary, I added into the dough.  If you really like rosemary, add more!

Caution!!! Makes a HUGE loaf. Use the pan size recommended or half the recipe. This loaf is more about 20 servings. It is DELICIOUS and I am making it again tonight as written (but halved). The onion is good and cooks fine in there so go ahead and add it, finely chopped.

I loved this and so did both of my girls (1 and 3).  I added sliced red onions and artichoke hearts to the top as some others suggested and it tasted wonderful.  Can't wait to make again.

Thanks for the easy & tasty bread recipe!  Next time I will top it with bell peppers and more spices, but the parmesan, rosemary & olive oil were lovely!

I thought this was a great basic recipe. For the topping, I only used about a teaspoon of salt instead of the whole tablespoon.  I skipped the onions, but you could easily and tastily slice some thin red onion to put on the top and I am sure that would be delightful.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very very good except for too many onions in my humble opinion. I realize that this would be bread to use at a meal but if you want to use it for breakfast, it would not be very good with peanut butter on it:-)    I would either sauté the onions next time or possibly eliminate all together. I put mine on a flat cookie sheet and pressed it all the way out to the edges. I worked out fine.  I also didn't have fresh rosemary so had to use dried. I liked the texture a lot. I just had the kitchen aid do all the kneading.

I like this bread and will make it again. It has a light, fluffy inner texture. I used the prescribed 1 Tbsp of salt inside the dough, and just a sprinkling on top, and found it to be too salty tasting. Next time I will reduce the salt to 3/4 Tbsp instead of 1 Tbsp. Also, I don't know if the cheese is necessary but it gives it a nice appearance. A note about baking method (I did two loaves, each with a different baking method) - a dark bottomed pan coated with oil produces a nice medium brown bottom crust, but baking on wax paper resulted in the crust sticking to the wax paper and the bottom not browning at all. I had read the reviewer who said to use parchment paper and decided to use wax paper since I didn't have parchment. I don't know if the result would be the same, but I'm not willing to try it. Use an oiled, dark bottomed pan and you won't be disappointed.

Not my first attempt at bread but it's been a long time since I've made it.
And it was truly worth the wait. I followed the recipe exactly as is except I didn't have parmesan but I had some goat cheese left over and it worked great! I also added sun-dried tomatoes, green olives, red bell peppers, red onions, and salami. All leftovers from the refrigerator and pantry. All that aside the star was the base recipe. Thanks a lot Michael, this one goes on my repeat list

This is a wonderful recipe.  Be warned though, it is a very sticky dough, and if using all purpose flour it's going to be closer to 7 cups than 5, but I've also made it with bread flour (which I prefer) which uses 5.  I usually chop up some garlic and kalamata olives to add to the onion, reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon in and 1 teaspoon on top.  We love it, and it smells so wonderful while baking.

Loved it, and got rave reviews from my family.  That said, I did tweak a few ingredients.  I used two cups whole wheat flour and a scant three cups of regular flour.  I added a teaspoon of garlic to the dough, and probably a little more than 1/2 cup onion.  Along with Parmesan cheese, I baked it with thin slices of green peppers.  Once out of the oven, I added feta cheese, chicken (with some tomato herbs from Seasoned Home), tomato slices and mozzarella.  Yum!!!

This was awesome!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and put in a little less salt.  I even went cheap on the recipe by using dry rosemary (cut down to 1/3) and dried minced onions (cut down to 1/4th), and it still turned out amazing.  My family loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

I halved the recipe and used the bread machine (liquids first then the dry ingredients). I would probably double the onion because I did not really feel it in the bread. Maybe try to sauté it first. Otherwise great recipe and really easy to make.

I used onion powder instead of diced onions and it turned out great anyway. I also covered the bread with a bit of garlic butter as well as the olive oil before baking, it was amazing. Perfect recipe to change or keep as is. Thanks for sharing!

Scruptious!  My family devoured this.  Thanks, Michael!  I substituted some freshly ground whole wheat and flax seed for the white flour. And I also subbed some Italian seasoning for the Rosmary. This recipe is a new family favorite. By the way, my family really enjoyed dipping it in pizza sauce.  I think it would be good to dip it in warm olive oil with Italian seasonings too.

MAKE IT TODAY!
Very easy-made it twice this week..didn't have Parmesan-so I topped with rosemary/(ground) sage..kids complained all flavor was only on top 2nd time: I split the salt and put herbs/salt on bottom of pan before dough, then topped with remainder and made *doubled batch second time :-) GREAT *don't double salt in the dough..less is better.

This recipe was very easy to follow. I made it  twice today. First time I followed the ingredient list exactly....the bread was exceptional, but had wayyyyy too much salt. Second time I put in only 1/2 tbl salt to dough and none on top. I also substituted half whole wheat flour.  Makes a great savory bread with a nice crust for sandwiches

perfect bread.  it makes a lot and keeps really well for a long time.

on my second attempt, i made it into pizza, halving the recipe and using 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c. white bread flour.  still so delicious.

As others stated, too much salt on top. I think I won't use any on top - the bread has enough in it. I did a half recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. The bread was about 1 1/2-2 inches tall, perfect for sandwiches. I used 1/2 an onion in the bread, and it was so good! So easy to prepare. I also let it rise for 1 hour, although my yeast was cold. Definite keeper.

I have made this about 40 times since finding the recipe here.. but I use the dough only.  I have found that it makes once of the best pizza doughs around and certainly better than any I have tried on this site so far.  Also like brushing with olive and garlic and topping with one or two little pizza spice packets from Lil Caesars.  Wonderfully adaptable. One of the best finds for me on all of allrecipes. This is a later edit: I realized in baking this dozens of times that I happened on something that made it a lot better.  I put the foccacia in well oiled (with Olive oil) round pans and let them rise there. This made the foccacia a bit more crispy on the crust and definitely makes a difference. I abandoned that step at some point to start baking them on cookie sheets.  Not the same result and now will go back to round pans from here on out. Still love, love, love this recipe!

Delicious!  We served it with minestrone soup and I'd love to make this many times over.  I'm going to use the leftovers for breakfast sandwiches tomorrow.  Can't wait!  I found this recipe to be right on, with the exception for the salt sprinkled over top.  I reduced it from 1 T. to 1 t.  And I think I used closer to 6 c. flour total...  Yum!  Thanks Michael!

This is only the second time I've made bread, so I was wary of trying something that seemed as exotic as foccacia. However, this is a very easy recipe to follow and it turned out perfect and delicious.   I had a group of four people over for lunch. They saw the bread on the counter and it was gone very quickly. I did not make any variations except leaving it in the oven about 5 minutes longer (my oven seems to be cool) and adding Italian seasoning and garlic to the top of the foccacia. Huge hit. I'll be making this instead of buying bread at the store to make paninis with or use in dips/spreads.

I really like this foccacia recipe, and it is pretty much my default. I would recommend dicing the onion very finely, otherwise, it makes for a strange texture when you get a bite of it.

I have made breadsticks out of this, used it for pizza crust & panini bread.  I used half the salt, and added garlic and oregano to the dough.  No salt on it after it was baked either.  Everyone loves it.

Wonderful recipe exactly as written! To address the 'salty' reviews, for some who may not know--it makes a huge difference to use KOSHER salt, NOT table salt and when using kosher, Diamond Crystal is a coarser grain than Morton Kosher. If you measure a tablespoon of Diamond Crystal next to the same amount of Morton Kosher and table salt, volumewise the DC will hold less salt. The coarser grain won't dissolve as quickly as table salt. That's why salts such as pickling salt is so finely grained, it dissolves quickly into the brine. Most chefs will use kosher salt because it's easier to pinch up the salt and distribute it over the food.  Try cooking two small pieces of steak sometime using the same amount of both types of salt and see which tastes saltier.  hope this helps.   Thank you, Michael for the recipe!

wonderful easy foccacia! I substituted bread flour which I had in the house.  Found it needed to rise more than 20 min; more like 40 min for first rise. Used less salt in the bread like others suggested, but used only 1 tsp, which was too little.  Think 2 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp will work fine.  Regardless, it was excellent.  Am making it again today!

Great basic recipe. It had a bit too much rosemary for my taste. Next time I make this, I will quarter the rosemary. Add minced sautee dgarlic, and saute the onions.

The original recipe is too large for a regular focaccia loaf.  I think the cheese and herbs should be mixed into the dough along with the onions to give it the flavor it lacks.

I divided this recipe in half as I didn't want quite as much bread. I added extra spices (garlic powder and Italian herbs) into the dough. This was very tasty, though I wish I hadn't put the cheese on til later in the cooking process as it got rather crunchy! I'll make this again, as it was easy to do and forgave me for using partly whole wheat flour :) Thanks!

this was my first attempt at foccacia & I have to say it came out excellent! I used my bread machine to do all the work then let it rise in the fridge overnight...also I used an 8 inch springform pan & I did  cut the recipe in half.  Brushed the top with garlic oil then sprinkled with chopped rosemary.....added garlic powder, shredded parm cheese then thinly sliced tomatoes. VERY good with some dipping oil.  I thought the only way to get the excellent texture would be through a professional bakery but nope the home kitchen worked perfectly. I used convection bake for 20 mins.  You must try this ! thanks, Michele

Excellent, easy to make bread.. everyone really liked it!  Added minced garlic and some cheese into the dough as well as on top.  So good when it first comes out of the oven.  This recipe could easily be tweaked with other additions.  A keeper, thanks.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I loved the ease of making the recipe and the fabulous results.  Since the spices are sprinkled mostly on top of the bread you can really mix things up a bit and try an endless array of spice combinations from the sweet to the savory.  This is a very good basic recipe for foccacia.  I am now officially in love with this recipe....thank you and good day!!!  lol

Hey Michael,   I've made your focaccia a few times after a good friend suggested it to me and let me tell you that it is the best! I even came up with a way to make it a sweet breakfast bread! Thanks for such a great recipe that can be depended on.

Excellent, easy recipe.  This was my first time making bread of any kind.  I made this Foccacia bread to go with our meal of Spaghetti and Meatballs.  It was perfect.  Everyone raved over it and my husband has requested that I make it at least once per month for sandwiches.   Next time I might knead some of the fresh rosemary into the dough... it kept falling off the top of the bread when it was being eaten. Thank you for this recipe!

Awesome and very, very easy. FYI, I did not add the onion, just topped with rosemary and parmesan. Slice through the middle to make great tasty sandwich bread. This is an excellent all-purpose bread for any occasion, and I look forward to using it for pizza crust, too!

Oh wow, this was fabulous!  I was trying to copy some bread we love at a restaurant. I made these changes:  only 2 tsp salt and I added 1/4 c. Parmesan to the dough. My family wants me to make this frequently and we will use it for panini sandwiches.

I have made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  I add sun dried tomatoes, Greek black olives (sliced) and an assortment of herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary etc.)to the batter.  You can pretty much add whatever suits your taste.  It makes excellent panini sandwiches.

Fantastic and reasonably quick, for yeast bread!  Nice with pasta and a salad.  I halved the recipe and formed into a 10" circle - made 8 big servings.  I omit the chopped onion, but add a little onion and garlic powder to dough.  I also cut back on the kosher salt topping - using only 1 tsp - it was plenty.  This will be a favorite for us.  Thanks!
UPDATE: I love this recipe and have been making it for years. Now, I make 1/3rd of a recipe and it's perfect for 4.  Today, I discovered a new use for leftovers. Cut the slices of focaccia horizontally and use as a pizza base!  I made Margherita pizzas with ricotta, fresh tomatoes, basil and whole mozzarella - topped with a little olive oil, a little more grated mozzarella to hold it all together and freshly ground pepper.  Toasted in the oven for about 10 minutes - AMAZING!  I may make extra focaccia from now on just to have the leftovers.  So good...

LOVED this recipe!  I have been looking for a good foccacia recipe for a while, and this was it!  I used less salt, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also brushed some olive oil over the bread after baking it.  Eaten fresh out of the oven= HEAVEN!!!!Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I left out the onions (don't like them) and added a teaspoon of garlic and a bit of rosemary to the dough, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty much exactly, and it tasted wonderful!  Will definitely make this again; it was very easy, too.

I read reviews about too much salt, and I cut it down to a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon in each case, and it still turned out a little to salty.  The second time I made it I used closer to 3/4 t on the top, and it was excellent.
I am not a fan of raw onions, but these cook fine as they bake, so I didn't find it necessary to saute them.
I loved how quick this works up!

My family is from southern Italy and we made this all the time . We called it pizza depending  on what we put on top. I have one suggestion, we all loved, we chopped up anchovies  and mixed it in with the dough.....of course don't  add as much salt because the anchovies are salty, but it is delicious.  Thanks  for the memories.

My husband and I used to buy this at the local grocery store more than 15 years ago. All of a sudden they quit selling it. So disappointed! We'd found different versions but never quite the same. This was extremely easy to make and took no time to cook. The bread itself is delicious but I sliced a small onion very thin, two small tomatoes thinly sliced, I wanted sliced black olives but he bought diced, a small amount of shredded mozzarella cheese and some parmesan cheese. I didn't have rosemary but I used a little sweet basil. Anyhow, I love recipes that allow you to add your own special touches. Very, very good!

This bread turned out fantastic!  I replaced the onions with minced garlic, and used my stand mixer to "knead" the dough for about 5 minutes on setting "3" using the paddle attachment.

This foccacia is airy and flavorful. I did find that the flour/water ratio was way off. I'd suggest using just 1.5 cups of flour (and you may still need to add flour). To make it healthier, I used half white whole  wheat flour. I also added garlic along with the onion. I topped with a selection of roasted vegetables, grated feta cheese and grated hard cheese, and the result was superb.

I have yet to make it with the onions but I just put my own herbs and spice both inside and on top of it and it is great! I think I don't bake it quite enough as it's a little dense but I do use a smaller pan then is supposed to be used. Though I love it either way! Super great!

I have made this so many times.  My family loves loves loves this bread. When I have company over I make it. When I make chicken gnocchi soup I make it, when someone is sick I make it. LOVE.  Be smart with the salt and stuff on top. Do it to taste. That is part of cooking....

I loved this bread. My only change was I  substituted an aged goat cheese for the parm/asiago and I had to use dry rosemary so I soaked the rosemary for an hour.  Also forgot the onions but will for sure  remember for next time. .

as with any reciepe I try,  I always read the reviews first.  this bread has always turned out great for me!  the saltiness has never been an issue,  I just sprinkle a little on top but use the full tbs inside and I add my own spices and toppings.  my favorite is thinly sliced tomatoes on top and a sprinkle of cheese, usually parm or mozz. my only thing with the tomatoes is you gotta cook the bread a little longer so the dough under them cooks as well,  I'll lower the temp 15 degrees at the end and cook for another 5 to 10 mins or so.

Really great and easy recipe! The only thing i did differently was use thyme instead of rosemary and  used 3 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of a.p flour as i read this may increase the crispiness of the bread. As other reviewers noted,the bread does come out quite thick even when I halved the dough into 2 loaves. Next time I'll make sure to flatten out the dough much more before baking. Otherwise great crispness to bread after 25 min of baking and extremely heavenly when topped with a variety of mushrooms and mozzarella and parmesan cheese!

This bread has a chewy exterior and soft in the middle. My family really enjoyed the flavor and texture. I topped it with sautéed shallots, rosemary & marinated red peppers. I liked that it came together quickly. Rosemary goes perfect with it!

I’ve made this recipe more times than I can count, and I love it. A lot of times I bake it in my 18x13” sheet pan and turn it into a “deep dish” pizza. The toppings are endless. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe.  The loaf was huge, and yet there is very little left from our dinner party I baked this for tonight!  I cheated by putting everything into the bread machine and using the dough setting (wet on bottom, dry on top) then shaping and baking myself.  As with all foccacia recipes, I make up my own toppings and on this used salt, pepper, dried rosemary and fresh tomato slices.  This will become part of my regular bread rotation.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is VERY good! Been on a focaccia "kick" here as of late, and have tried a few recipes I've seen here on ALLRECIPES. This one is by far the best, and easiest one I've tried. I make breads often and like trying new recipes of old favorites. This one is a good and tasty recipe! I added some other herbs as well as the ones listed. VERY GOOD! Thanks

This is addicting! I will likely be making this bread again today as the last loaf only lasted one evening. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I sauteed the onions as I don't really like raw onions. I was able to make this loaf in about hour, making it a great choice when something is needed quickly. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the best and easiest focaccia bread ever!  With my KitchenAid mixer, it's fast and foolproof - no kneading involved.  It also freezes well, so we'll be enjoying this bread with future meals.

This bread was fairly good. Considering i've never made bread, I was really impressed with myself. What made it was the diced tomato, basil leaves and parmesan I tossed on the top. Overall, it was pretty good.

This was the best, easiest and fastest recipe.  Of course I live in a hot climate which helps the rising process.  Made in an hour and not too salty as common sense told me to adjust the salt on top.  Perfect amount in dough though.  My guests who called 90 minutes before they arrived LOVED this version and I have made many others for them.  Thank u Michael!

Made this bread for a family camp out. sliced horizontally and topped it with grilled chicken, cheese, ranch, bacon and tomato. put the top on and wrapped it in tin foil and heated thru on the grill. Everyone loved it. I usually buy the bread from the store but will ditch that an make my own. Very easy and yummy!

This bread is so good and so easy. I've made it twice now, following other reviewer's suggestions to cut back on the salt on top. Just a light sprinkle is plenty. I added minced garlic to the dough, otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I used it for panini's, at least the part that I managed to keep out of my family's hands. They like to eat it straight out of the pan. It did take about 30 minutes to cook rather than 20, but that's possibly because my pan is stoneware. Gave the recipe to a friend at work, it's now her go to bread recipe. Thanks for sharing, this will be one of those recipes that gets passed down!

I am just delving into the world of making bread from scratch, and this was one of my first attempts. I could not believe how straight forward the instructions were. It came together as it was supposed to, and it was very good! It makes a huge amount of bread, so I gave some to my Mom and Dad who loved it too! I kept true to the original recipe...minus the extra salt on top...not needed. I found it on the edge of almost being to salty even without the extra, but we like salt, so it was fine! Next time...tomatoes on top! Thanks for the great recipe, it's well written, and first time bread makers CAN successfully make this...with great results!

We make this recipe all the time but we reduce the amount of salt by almost half and occasionally mix up the toppings.  It is one of my favorite recipes from this site.

Very nice "easy" bread.  I gave it a second proofing in the oven and used zaatar (Arabic herb mix) instead of the traditional ones.  Came out delicious!

Xltnt and easy recipe!  I altered this using 2 C. whole wheat flour and reduced salt and oil.  Just ate my first bite, and it's very good.  Next time, I may use a slightly lower proportion of whole wheat, as it has a slightly "dry" flavor.  Might be my flour was a bit too old.  I like the olives, but the sundried tomatoes are good, too.  Thanks, Michael.

I made this bread last night to serve with a Spiced Garden Tomato Soup I made with fresh toms from my garden. We LOVED it! It fluffed up beautifully and the taste was better than a restaurant! We will definitely be making this again, thanks for posting :)

Absolutely fantastic!! I used garlic powder, garlic salt, basil, oregano, Italian seasonings and Parmesan cheese on top and my husband loved it!  I did have to let my dough rise longer than 20 minutes. Other than that this recipe is definitely a keeper in my recipe box.  Very easy to make!

Easy and awesome.  This was my first attempt at foccacia and it turned out great.  I agree with some others - it does need less salt sprinkled on top.

Very quick and easy.  I used 2 T. dried onion and garlic salt blend in place of the salt in the bread because I was pressed for time.  I only had Italian seasoning blend and used that on top with the olive oil and parmesan.  Simply delicious served with a plate of olive oil with a balsamic reduction swirled in and fresh herbs sprinkled on top.

VERY Good! I made this with the intention of sandwiches, therefore omitted the onion and the toppings, but added about 1.5-2 tbs of rosemary into the dough. My only complaint was my fault. After reading many reviews where the salt was to high, i minimized the salt in the dough to 1 tsp and didn't add any top. It could use the 1 tbs In the dough, so next time i would just omit the salt on top. VERY good though! Will make again!

Very yummy!  Just a couple changes like some others suggested.  I used sugar instead of honey.  My dough took quite a bit longer to double in size, about one hour.  Definitely wait until it has doubled in size.  I also used 1 tsp of salt on top instead of 1 tbsp; it was just right.  Instead of rosemary, I sprinkled dried oregano on top.  My husband is Italian and he said it was the best he's had!  Thanks for the recipe.

The only thing I changed when I made this recipe was in place of the chopped onion you add to the dough I added about 4 fresh garlic cloves minced. On top after brushing it with Olive oil I used Sea Salt because I didn't have any Kosher Salt, then added fresh Rosemary, fresh grated Parmesan Cheese and thinly sliced Roma tomatoes. My family really liked the way it turned out, and the next day it tasted even better the garlic flavor was all through the bread.

This recipe is FAR too salty- I wished I would've read all the reviews or at least 10 of them before making this. It smelled amazing while cooking but 1 whole TBSP of kosher salt when it already has salt in the mix plus all that cheese on top- made it over bearing. I had added garlic powder, a bit of oregano and dried rosemary. I also used whole wheat flour. I would attempt this recipe again but completely alter it. Also do not add the whole 5 cups of flour- it was a bit too dry. Add as you go- and see how much you actually need.  Otherwise I think it would've turned out great- I didn't let it rise long enough I don't think either because everyone else said they let it rise 40+ minutes! I did the required 20 and it wasn't long enough. Sigh oh well- if I sprinkle off all the toppings really well and put cut it up into strips like bread sticks and dip it into marinara or spaghetti sauce its- mangeable:)

I did enjoy being able to make foccacia at home.  Lovely! :)  This is a great base recipe.  It was good with the rosemary, but you could change it with different toppings, too.  I agree with other reviewers, the salt on top was excessive and almost ruined it for me.  I might remove it all together or try 1/4 tsp. next time.  Try using chopped red onion.  It is pretty and delish!

Definitely a hit! I had to use sugar, since I didn't have honey, and I prepped it the night before; completing the first rise before wrapping it tightly in saran wrap and leaving it in the fridge overnight.  It really gets huge! Tastes delicious, and I love all the topping ideas. I'll be making this again!

This recipe is great! Just remember to add a few sprinkles of salt on top and not follow the recipe amount. I like to cook my onions prior to adding them to the dough so they are caramelized. Let rise longer for better results. Very forgiving recipe.

This was a great recipe that was very easy and fresh.  I made the recipe into two seperate foccacias.  For the first one I followed the recipe exactly, except that I chopped fresh basil aswell. It came out very good.  For the second I added some mozzerella cheese along with onion/tomato slices with a bit of garlic powder.  They were great and I intend on making it again but I still thought that the top was too salty (I followed the 1 teaspoon suggestion).  I baked it on parchment paper and there were no problems.  I want to try using some whole wheat flour next time though.  Thanks for the great recipe and suggestions.

4 stars for ease and taste.  I did find it to be too salty, though, so next time, I will omit the extra salt on top.  Mine didn't rise very much at all so if anyone has any thoughts on that, please let me know.  Water was warm and yeast was in date so not sure what happened.

This was excellent. First time I made it topped with tomatoes and parmesan. The second time I put it in my bread maker on the dough cycle and it made excellent pizza dough! Baked it for about 5 minutes before adding toppings and brushed crust with melted butter, garlic salt and italian seasonings. Yum! (Both times I did decrease the salt to 2 tsp and did not add the extra salt at the end.)

i used up the rest of some flour i had that was getting old. i used half all purpose half whole wheat for the five cups called for. i also only used 1 packet of active dry yeast. i liked the idea of sauteing onions for this, and it got me thinking, why not go all out and add sun dried tomatoes, olives, and some left over pepperoni i needed to also use up?  i did end up adding a bit more flour to get rid of some of the excess moisture from the extra added ingredients i put it.  i used italian seasonings instead of just rosemary and did a mix of parmesan and asiago cheeses on top. i am really trying hard to not eat more of it right now. i will be using this recipe again!

This is a really simple recipe- I use some garlic instead of onion. I sometimes cook the garlic a little before adding so it isn't quite as strong. Sometimes, I leave the garlic out. Also add basil or rosemary when the mood strikes. The best thing about this is that this is a nice basic recipie for some bread. I also use quick rise yeast. I was doubtful seeing as focaccia was spelled wrong but pleasantly surprised!!

This was a great recipe and a big hit with the family.  The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.   I omitted the onion and also the sprinkling of kosher salt at the end.   I will definitely be making this again and will experiment with different toppings.

Cooked perfectly, a little drier than the oil soaked restaurant kind, but chewy and satisfying. did pickled peppers instead of parmesan, and the result was fantastic, the whole sheet is almost gone in less than a day!  Thanks!

This was very, very good and super easy.  I halved the recipe, instead of Kosher salt I used 1 tsp of table salt in the dough and none on top,  on top I used sliced tomatoes, garlic powder, oregano, Parmesan cheese and sliced olives.  Delicious, everyone loved it, this wil become a favorite.

Super yummy! I made a cheddar/jalapeno bread so I omitted the parm and herbs ontop. I did add basil and oregano into the dough. I sliced 3 jalapenos and placed them ontop before baking, then I baked it for 10 minutes before I added the cheese. I baked the cheese ontop for about 15 minutes and it was perfect. Awesome bread! Everybody loved it!

I made this for my best friend's 30th Birthday dinner party and it was a wonderful addition to the potluck meal. It's wonderful fresh or the next day sliced for sandwiches. I didn't put the Tbs. of salt on top because that seemed like an aweful lot to me. Once accounting for that this is a 5 star recipe for ease and deliciousness :-)

The only reason I'm giving this bread 4 Stars is because it is so wonderfully easy and fast! I was going to give it 3 stars because of the amount of salt! I followed the recipe and read the some of the reviews so I cut the topping salt from 1TBS to 1 tsp and it was still too salty! This is from someone that likes salt! I think next time I'll reduce the salt in the dough back to about 3/4 tsp and the topping salt down to about 1/4 tsp. The only other things I changed in the recipe was pre-cooking the onions. (I'm glad I did as I think they would have been too strong and crunchy) and used 1 TBS crushed dried rosemary (used a mortar and pestle) because I didn't have any fresh. I think this would have been even better with Kalamata olive and some sun dried tomatoes too! I will be making this again. Like I said, it was fast and very easy!

So easy and versatile! I topped mine with carmelized onions, asiago cheese and rosemary. It really does only take about an hour. You take take this recipe and make it whatever you want. Excellent for entertaining.

Very good.  A little chewier than I would have liked but I guess that's just the nature of foccacia.  I definitely threw a ton of seaonings on top of the bread.  I made 1/2 the loaf into garlic bread...a nice twist on the same old!

This was a really good recipe. Like another reviewer I subbed half the flour for whole wheat flour, which made it a little less tender but still tasty.   My only issue was that the recipe does not explain when to add additional toppings (as in the photo). I wanted to top with various sliced veggies. I oiled and then layered the veg, and topped with a little more oil just to help them stick. This seemed to work and did not seem to alter the cooking time.

I may be the first fool to mess up this fool-proof recipe...i left my dough out for over and hour and it barely rose. The bread itself didn't rise either, though taste-wise, everything tasted great adding tomatoes, garlic and, other misc seasonings. Maybe it's the weather - i will definately try again, hopefully for something a little more 'bready' next time.

I have made this countless times and it comes out amazing everytime.  As a first time breadmaker I was concerned at first but it was so simple that I couldn't resist.  I did let it rest a lot longer so that it rose to at least double the size to get the fluffy texture that I love.

Very good flavors, yields a lot, recipe is very well written. It would benefit from a little more resting time so that the gluten can relax a little more from all the kneading and the end result is a little less dense. Either way this is super delicious bread!

This is a really good recipe.  I used the following to top my bread: dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme (about 1 tbsp of each), sea salt (I used about 2 tsp and it was too salty), parmesan cheese and finely chopped garlic (one clove).  I halved the recipe to 6 servings.    It was quick and easy, and made really good bread for a tuna sandwich!

Would have been great but the 1 T of kosher salt on the top made it inedible. Trying to brainstorm a way to recycle it. Will make it again with a fraction of the salt called for in the original recipe.

Very quick and easy.  I've used a variety of seasonings for the top depending on what I am serving this with and it always tastes delicious.  I use less salt just because we don't care for a very salty taste.

This was a bit to salty for me.  I didn't even add the salt on top as stated and still shoulda halved the salt in the dough.  The parmesan has enough salty taste as is.  I made this into two round loaves and did the recipe toppings on one and added olives to the other.  Was pretty good...just less salt next time.

This was sooo good.  I do reccomend cutting back on the salt. I made a half recipe.  I only used 1 t. of salt in the dough and then lightly sprinkled a little more on top,

Good & so easy. First time, I followed the recipe except for substituting sugar for honey & omitting the onion (not a fan.) That tasted great! Second time making, I also substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour specified.  Tasted wonderful this way as well, the whole wheat was a nice change.

I had never made Foccacia bread before and I tried this recipe this weekend.  I did not use the onions and I used a combination of basil, rosemary and thyme on the top of the bread.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  Everyone raved over the bread and said it was the best bread they had ever had.

This is fun to make and a hit with my family.  I made it Greek style on one half by putting oregano, crumbled feta and sliced kalamata olives on it.  The original recipe however, is fantastic!

I've made Foccacia before and never had good luck, but this one takes the prize! Try dipping it in extra virgin olive oil mixed with fresh cracked pepper. To die for! I'm so pleased to have found this easy, delicious recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. Sometimes this bread can be a bit oily for my taste, so I skipped the drizzling of the oil on top. Also, I added sliced black olives along with the onion. Luckily, I had some fresh rosmary on hand, which really adds something special to the taste. This bread was popular with the whole family!

Great recipe!  Excellent foccacia and by omitting the onions, you have an excellent pizza dough.

Really good.  My girlfriend thought it was a little to salty, even for foccacia.  I've never had foccacia before, but I loved it.  I was thinking about 3.5-4 stars, but she always wins out :-)

We followed the recipe and used fresh rosemary...it makes all the difference!!
