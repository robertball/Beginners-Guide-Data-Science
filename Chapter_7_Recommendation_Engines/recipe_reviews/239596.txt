I made no changes to this recipe (I lied. I didn't use fresh squeezed lemon juice; I got it from a bottle and I used coconut oil because I'm out of other oils.) and made a cream cheese frosting for the kicker. And, boy, was it good! Not dry, not over tart... And just super lemony-delicious! I had a lot of leftover batter so I made a snack cake too, which is good as well. Great recipe! Thanks!

This was a great Recipie. I was a little concerned with the amount of lemon, but I topped the cupcakes with a sweat buttercream icing that balanced out the tartness. they were a huge hit.  Very moist too.

Excellent recipe. Only change made was to reduce the lemon juice to a 1/2 cup and made a cake instead of cupcakes.

So delicious!!! Okay I did make one big mistake and changed one ingredient-but I think it really is the base recipe that deserves 5 stars (I hate when people make like 10 changes and give the recipe five stars when the original recipe actually stinks-I really don't think that's the case here).  I didn't have lemon extract and I'm not even sure where to find that in the country I live in so I used an edible Lemon essential oil-I think about 10 drops instead. I did use bottle lemon juice because I didn't have lemons-but that is a very minor sub.

The mistake I made was that I read "lemon juice" where it said lemon extract and added it at that point-oops, so I didn't boil the lemon juice.  It was fine though. 
 I saw that some reviewers said they didn't rise much- but when I filled my muffin tins 2/3 they rose to the top of the muffin tin -  which is what cupcakes are supposed to do they're supposed to be flat on the top (they aren't muffins that are supposed to go over the top).  
The finally result was so lemony, sweet (though in ny opinion not too sweet), and moist.  They were fantastic plain or with a simple vanilla buttercream.
I have a convection oven so I lowered the temp a bit (150°C) and I think I cooked them a few minutes longer (about 18 for a clean toothpick).

Wow! what a great recipe. The only thing that I changed was that I used Organic Lemon Juice and cut the amount of lemon juice down to 1/2 cup.. Absolutely, yummy and moist. I added a lemon cream cheese frosting as my topping.

The cupcake was delicious and moist, but when I took them out of the oven, the sank in. They were still yummy, but is there a reason they sunk in?

These cupcakes were not my fave. The flavor was great but the texture was not good they were flat and spongey. I will not be using this recipe again.

Made this for a bridal shower, a mission dinner, and other occasions, always making extra batches because it is so good. Big hit every time, and people coming up for multiple servings (one person ate NINE of these in a single afternoon!). Tasty just plain or with lemon buttercream sort of topping. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups in subsequent batches and still good.
For those who experienced collapsing - the 15 min is not correct - more like 25 - 30 min!

The 1st time I tried this recipe, I TOTALLY bombed it! But this time, I did it right! The only changes I made were, using coconut oil (which made it more of a tropical taste); and instead of using the beater, to add the hot lemon juice, I hand whisked it in. Worked great! They look adorbs! & they taste soooo great! #thanksfortherecipe

I made these just as the recipe said, and the outcome were very moist, very nice cupcakes. The only thing is that the lemon flavor was off and I don’t know why.

I don’t recommend it. I made these cupcakes twice and both times the cupcakes caved in. After 19 minutes the centers had not fully cooked. This is not a good recipe.

These cupcakes were good but could have been better. Next time I would increase the lemon extract. I found that they did not rise much which is good if you are going to ice them.

Flavour was more bitter than tart.  Did not rise. Thankfully, large swirls of butter cream frosting can cover a multitude of errors.  Edible but not a result I'm proud of.

Overall this was a great recipe.  I didn't change anything, just added a cup of chopped thawed strawberries to the batter for some strawberry lemonade cupcakes.  These were nice and tart, but a little too sweet for my taste.  Really rich.

Use an extra large mixing bowl 'cause when you pour that hot lemon juice in there, the batter foams and grows exponentially.  I had a mess and had to think fast to save the day!  They are too spongy to make good cupcakes, but mine worked out ok after all.

I liked this recipe for quick and easy cupcakes. I cut the lemon juice down some, which worked out well for my little ones. The cupcakes were very moist. Though some seemed a tad oily, but this didn't keep us from gobbling them up. ??
