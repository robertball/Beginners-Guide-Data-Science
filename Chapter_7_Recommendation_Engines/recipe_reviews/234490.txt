Wonderfully refreshing cocktail. I use pink lemonade for the rim and swap sweet and sour w/the prickly pear amounts. 2oz pear and 1oz sweet and sour. Serve is chilled over crushed ice! MY NEW FAV and Go-to cocktail choice of the summer season.

this tastes good no matter what you do! i gathered prickly pear fruit from my yard here in tucson, and cut the skin off (after soaking in water for a bit to soften) and just cooked it down for for 30 min, strained it and used the juice. i did not add triple sec or sugar cuz i can't have sugar but the tequila makes up for that! new fave drink!

I also had this fabulous drink at the bar at the Tucson Airport and asked the bartender for this recipe.  This is exactly correct except the bartender put a sugar rim vs. salt rim.

I still remember the first time I tried a prickly pear margarita at a trendy restaurant in Las Vegas.  It was deep purple and served in a tall fluted glass. Thank goodness I had a plane to catch or I would have sipped on one after the other.  This is a great recreation of that memorable drink.  It's not the same color as I remember, but it tastes the same. If you like different flavored margaritas and can find prickly pear syrup, this one is definitely worth a try.

I just made one of these and boy is it good!!  (It's not noon yet, but hey, it's five o' clock somewhere!)  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  I had to order the pear syrup online because I couldn't find any.  I bought Cheri's All Natural Prickly Pear Cactus Syrup.   These are great and the cactus syrup gives a nice reddish color!   Gracias!

Searched google and found this as the first recipe.  Made my drink exactly as per the recipe.  It's a good margarita, the prickly pear syrup is mostly just decoration in my opinion.  The lime just fights to overpower what little flavor the cactus brings to the mix.  It's a very good margarita though,  I'll do it again and again because my cactus gave me a lot of prickly pears....

Very tasty.  I make my own sweet and sour mix using Splenda.  Love the fuchsia color!  Worth trying!

This recipe is amazing. To our surprise we found prickly pears in our local farmers market (in Delaware!) and bought 3, having no idea how many we would need. As it turned out, cooking down all 3 provided the right amount of juice to make 4 margaritas. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut back a bit on the lime juice. I used almost the amount of triple sec in the recipe but not quite -- I trusted the recipe but we tend to prefer a bit less sweetness in our drinks. Needless to say the drinks were a hit and I will contact the market first thing tomorrow to see if they regularly carry prickly pears!

This by far is my favorite Prickly Pear Margarita recipe!  I have made this recipe many times.  I highly recommend it!
