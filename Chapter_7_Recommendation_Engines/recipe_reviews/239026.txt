As someone who has never used hemp seeds or dates before, I can happily give this recipe a 5-star rating. I received a bag of hemp seeds to try out, and ordered some dates when I found most recipes calling for hemp seeds also called for dates. This was yummy and my 15-month old LOVED it too! I did add an extra date, a handful of ice cubes, and about another half tablespoon cocoa powder to get the flavor I wanted. Yumm!

This was a really good combination of ingredients - why haven't more people tried it!?  Made it about twice now and each time I doubled the cocoa powder (I used dark baking cocoa powder), dates and bananas. I also added a bit of almond milk to make it creamier.   Great taste and not super sweet!  Hemp seeds are slightly waxy and nutty for those of you who haven't had them before.
