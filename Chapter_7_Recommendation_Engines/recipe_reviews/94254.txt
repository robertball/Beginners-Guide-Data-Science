Delicious - but how could anyone discard all that Lobster?  I just couldn't, so I did not strain it.  It just made a chunky sauce - which was just fine with us!

Plan on trying this recipie on the week- end as a sauce over shrimp and crab stuffed noodles( altered Savannah seafood stuffing recipie). For easy removal of peppercorns and bay leaf I plan on tieing them in cheesecloth as I don't plan on straining out the veggies or lobster.  fingers crossed for luck! lol

Excellent. I just couldnt afford the lobster so I bought 2 tails and subbed imitation  meat for the rest.
Used a 1/4 cup of cream as well.
Family enjoyed it, the lobster/ was just right not to overpowering flavor.
