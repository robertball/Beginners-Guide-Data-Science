I added less tomato juice for a more hearty version of typical gazpacho and doubled all spices including the hot sauce. Try topping your soup with a mix of sour cream and chipotle tabasco. Yummy indeed!

I made this for our weekly "soup day" at work and it was a hit. I modified the recipe as I went along; I only put about a half onion, I added a can of mixed beans, I put waaaay more spice than suggested. Prep was a bit long but it was worth it.

Hope this helps!

Loved this recipe!!  I added 2 jalepenos(not real hot), 1/2 cup finely chopped kale, and used a can of Hot & Spicy V8 tomoato juice.  Also, added a lot more salt,celery salt, garlic salt & pepper. We ate it with white corn tortilla chips. It was really delicious and oh so healthy! I will be making this a lot next summer:)

I loved this!  I omitted garbanzo beans because I didn't have any, but it was delicious without.  Great summer side dish!
