My husband does not eat sugar, so I used honey for the sweetener.  This was a terrific addition to our Thanksgiving dinner.  Even my spice intolerant friend enjoyed the tang of the horseradish!

I was looking to match a Cranberry Horseradish Jam that was made by Stonewall Kitchens (it seems to have been discontinued). This comes pretty close but is more of a relish than a jam.

I was interested when I read this recipe, so I thought I would try it - WOW, am I glad I did!  This cranberry sauce it really good - almost everyone liked it, and the guys all went back for more!  This sauce is great with turkey, but equally good with ham as well!  It doesn't need to be saved for only for Thanksgiving either - it would be great on game day with sandwiches! I know I will be making this for years to come!

This didn't quite set up as much as I'd like and I really wanted more horseradish flavor. If I make it again I'll double or triple the horseradish.

This is a different and delicious sauce. I'm always looking for something with a twist of flavor. I too added a half cup more sugar to taste. Thanks for the recipe.

This sauce went great with my rib roast dinner on Christmas. But, next time I will have to add a tad more horseradish to have with my roast. Super easy to make, too. Thanks.

This sauce had a zip we like. I made it precisely by the recipe, but I may add a hint more horseradish next time.

This was fantastic!  I loved the "kick" that the horseradish adds - thanks very much!

This was a request from a friend who said his mother used to make it for Thanksgiving. When served, he said it was just like hers.

I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings which then called for 1 cup and 1 Tbsp cranberries, and it served 2 as a side dish (not 8) to roasted chicken.  Maybe this is intended as a garnish and not as a side dish?  Whatever, just be aware of the serving size and how youâ€™re planning to use it.  Pretty basic with cranberries, water and sugar, but the horseradish did add another layer of flavor and was an interesting twist.
