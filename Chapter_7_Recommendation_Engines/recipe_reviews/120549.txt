I really enjoyed making this dish. It was easy, fun, and very tasty. I substituted fresh spinach leaves instead of the broccoli,and I adjusted the recipe down to 2 servings.  Word of caution, the amount of butter/lemon mixture used for the 2 serving  calculations yielded a very small amount of "sauce", so it was a bit dry, but the taste was excellent. I will definitely try this again, but I will make more of the butter/lemon juice mixture. Thanks for the great recipe!

If I could give 4 and 1/2 stars, I would!! Only changes to stuffing were adding 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs, handful of parmesan cheese, and real broccoli.  I then took the dish and combined it with another off this site and baked it in a puff pastry crust.  DELISH!!!! Highly recommended for fish lovers and chicken can certainly be substituted for the fish.  Can't wait...that will be tomorrow's dinner!! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Very nice!  I used brown rice and added some pine nuts to the filling.  The paprika sprinked on top adds the needed color to the finished product.

Great for an idea, but I felt the recipe needed some adjustments.  I cooked it exactly true to the recipe the first time, and it was WAY too much salt and lemon for me, husband, and kiddo.  Next time, I'm going to try it with a quarter of the recommended amount of salt and half the recommended amount of lemon.  I can just serve it with lemon wedges on the side for those who want tons of lemon.  Also, I'm going to try heating the rice/broccoli/cheese mixture prior to baking.  When my fish couldn't take any more time in the oven, the cheese still wasn't melted.  I do appreciate that this is a great idea that can be modified in many different ways to suit your own tastes.

So delicious! A few changes I made: I cut the amount of salt in half.  Instead of frozen broccoli, I used fresh. I used regular mild cheddar cheese.  I also added panko crumbs to the stuffing mix and then sprinkled them on top too before putting it in the oven which gave it a nice little crisp and was the key ingredient in making it perfect.  I doubled the stuffing mix and saved the extra half for later because it makes a great casserole base. Even my boyfriend who isn't a fish guy kept raving about this dish.  I will definitely be making this again in the near future.  Very easy to make!

Vert tasty & easy dish to make. I added chopped onion & fresh garlic to the rice for extra flavor while cooking. Had lots of filling leftover, so would cut ingr's in half next time.

I always loved the Stuffed Sole that Red Lobster sold and have been searching for a recipe that is similar to it, and I think I've found a good substitute with this recipe :)I followed the recipe "as is", using some of the tips that other reviewers gave: added some breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese to the rice mixture, as well as sprinkled it over top of the fish before baking. I used Basa fish fillets as it was all I had on hand - but I guess ANY white fish would do. I used only 3 fish fillets, so I had extra stuffing, but I just threw it in the dish with the fish as an extra side dish (the rice alone was very yummy!). Thanks for posting this recipe. I will next try the stuffing with chicken :)

This dish was really yummy, I really liked the cheesy broccoli-rice filling.  Some of the fillets didn't cook through, however.  I think I need increase the cook time.

I took the advice of other cooks who said to use less salt and lemon.  I didn't have enough broccoli so I added some spinach to the mix and cooked it with the butter and added some chopped onion to it for more flavor.  I also added a sprinkle of granulated garlic.  I didn't think I would like the cheddar cheese - thought it might overpower the dish and the fish so I left it out.  I sprinkled the top of the dish with some parmesan cheese before baking.  Although it was good, it was quite bland.  I like highly flavored food.  My son and D-I-L gobbled it up otherwise I would have given it 2 stars.  I will make this again and maybe add some other seasoning - I think this is a good starting point and it has tons of potential.  Maybe I'll try the cheddar next time - not sure - cheddar just sounds weird with flounder.  I think adding some crabmeat or tiny shrimp might do the trick, too.  I normally don't make things from Taste of Home or other food companies because I never like them - they never seem to have much character - I guess I wasn't wrong on this one either but I'll try again to change it and make it my own.

Especially good for the non-fish lovers in the house. The fish takes on the cheesy flavor and stays very moist. Even my 2 year old gobbled it up. It's nice and quick for a weekday dinner. One thing to caution, I only used 6 fillets and forgot to cut down on the salt a bit..otherwise fantastic!

FABULOUS!!!! The most fantastic recipe EVER! I want to make it again and again. I did add about a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the sauce. Not sure how other reviews can say that this recipe is bland..far from it. It has a nice subtle flavour that enhances the fish and stuffing just beautiful on the pallet! Thanks Edna for posting!

Delish!!!  My husband, who has a broccoli aversion, ate it and loved it!  I used one lb of sole, brown rice, used less salt (about half) and doubled the sauce part.  I also added a bit of shredded cheese on top of the fish. And I used really good sharp cheddar (not reduced fat).  I wasn't sure the cheddar would go with the fish and broccoli but it was soo good! Tomorrow I'll try the leftovers on my twin toddlers, wish me luck!

I thought this was very good.  The only major change I made was leaving out the rice since I didn't have time to cook some.  I also used lemon pepper seasoning instead of plain salt.  I may have ended up using extra cheese (regular mild cheddar) too but am not sure since I cut the recipe down to 3 filets and didn't measure.  I had some hush puppy mix so I made that and some corn seasoned with old bay and pepper as a side dish.  But since this is such a heavy dish compared to what I'm use to; (esp if I had used rice) I'll not use the hush puppies next time (only had them the mix left over from a party anyway).  Reduced fat cheese doesn't melt very well from my past experience; so I'd suggest just using less of a sharp cheddar if you are trying to keep calories low; an easy place to cut out calories is the butter...cut the amount in half and skip the option to top the filets with butter; you will have plenty of liquid for basting later on in the cooking process.

This is absolutely delicious! I have made it several times in the past few weeks--twice for company. Everyone LOVED it! I'm making it again tonight! You can use any white fish.  I made it with cod last time as Costco was out of sole.  Just hammered the cod to thin it out.  Yummy.  Even people who don't like fish will love this!

My husband said it was a five. I don't care for baked fish so for me a four, which is good. I used fresh broccoli,steamed slightly. Also used lemon pepper instead of the salt which gave it added flavor. Will make this again.

Because we don't care for sole, I stuffed basa with the broccoli. I steamed some broccoli and then cooked a pkg of wild rice with mushrooms. Used some wasabi arugula and chopped that up.Sauteed some onion and mushroom, chopped up the broccoli heads and mixed everything together. Because Basa is a mild fish, you need stronger flavors. Next time I would add additional seasoning such as a bit of chipotle. Friends enjoyed it. The next time I made it used sole, sauteed diced mushrooms, onion, garlic. Didn't use cream cheese. Steamed and cut up in to small pieces fresh broccoli. Used the wild rice/mushroom rice. Seasoned the fish first. Melted butter, squeezed fresh lemon  and then sauteed additional diced onions and garlic and poured all on top. This was enjoyed by family and friends!

This was AWSOME. I told all my friends about it but didn't give the recipe..my secret, but i would make it for them. I found that reducing the salt made a big difference in it beeing too salty as is.

quick and easy to make.  the store was out of sole so I used swai fillets which is a bit thicker but less fishy.  and steamed fresh broccoli instead of the frozen.  came out great.  sauce doesn't yield very much and I will probably cut the salt in half as I feel it's place in this dish is mainly to mask the fishy taste of sole.  pay attention to your cook times with all fish as it very quickly goes from "almost done" to "over done" which will make any fish recipe dry.

My husband and I thought that this dish tasted great, but the texture kind of grossed us out--I used flounder, and the fish turned out very soggy/mushy.  Any ideas of why this happened?  Did I not cook the fish long enough?  I took the fish out b/c it was flaking, but maybe it needed a few more minutes.  Or should I have drained the broccoli better?  I'd like to make this dish again, but not if it's going to be soft enough to eat with a straw!

Not good. Way too much salt. My kids and I love fish, but they weren't interested in this at all. I could barely taste the cheese. I gave it two stars instead of only one because my husband thought it was really good, so one out of four of us enjoyed it.

I have to tell you I've made this several more times lately, always to rave reviews.  I've substituted plain rice for my own baked rice recipe which makes two large casseroles and then freezes easily in small portions.  This is a great recipe!  Thanks again.

I pretty much made this per the recipe and really enjoyed it. The only thing I did a little different was the sprinkle the stuffed fish rolls with a little smoked paprika during the last few minutes of cooking. But that was more for color than taste.

This was a good base recipe, but I made quite a few changes.  I used spinach instead of broccoli, a Mexican cheese blend (that was what I had) instead of cheddar, Bulgur wheat instead of rice (had no rice, but would prefer rice), and used flounder as my fish of choice.  I added sautéed onion and garlic to the stuffing as well as some garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper.  I also added some crumbled turkey bacon to the mix and that really added to the taste.  Lastly, I used about half the recommended amount of salt per the reviews.  My husband thought the dish was just okay, but I thought the stuffing was delicious (good enough to eat by itself, in fact).  The dish was a little more time-consuming than I’d like, especially considering the so-so reviews by my husband.  I liked it though, so it’s still on my list.

We loved this!!!!  I had some couscous in the fridge so I used that instead of rice and added onion because we love onion.  Also my fillets seemed a little too thick to roll and I was pressed for time so I layed the fish on the bottom of a baking dish and put the broccoli, cheese and cous cous ontop and baked it that way.  We loved it but next time I'll put the fish on top and the filling on the bottom to bake.  My kids added some parmesan to their's and it was still nice. Thanks for a new way to prepare fish, we love sole!!!!

Just made this - super tasty! I also added garlic and onion to the stuffing mix, and used fresh vs. frozen broccoli. Had a lot of stuffing left over (my sole filets were pretty small!) so I put it in a small casserole and baked it along with the fish to serve beside.  Hubby loved it!

My sole fillets were so tiny and hard to work with that I ended up putting the filling in a casserole dish and laying the fillets on top to cook.  Also, I used fresh broccoli that I chopped myself and brown rice.  I used an aged, sharp cheddar and reduced the salt to my own tastes.  Tasty and very easy (and fast).  I think I'll add some extra garlic next time.  Definitely a great comfort food type dinner.

I don't normally make flounder (I'm a tilapia girl), so the stronger scent of the fish made me nervous at first but I was pleasantly surprised! It tasted mild and flavorful. 
My modifications: I used cous cous instead of rice, and cooked it with a little chicken bullion. I halfed the salt, like the other posters suggested, and used white pepper. I sauteed a minced clove of garlic and about a tablespoon of diced onion and added it to he broccoli mixture, which I also warmed up, as suggested. Because I used the little individually frozen fish filets that you get in the freezer section, I found the broccoli too bulky so I cut off the stems and stuck with the florets. I sprinkled a little salt and pepper inside the fillets before stuffing them, and added a tiny bit on top of the roll-ups. I put a little panko on top of the roll-ups for some crunch. I had quite a bit of filling left over, but I plan on eating it as a side to tomorrow's dinner. Yum!
My husband, who is anti-anything new loved it! His only suggestion was a bit less cheese next time (I thought it was perfect). Will definitely make this again!

Because not all of my family likes fish, I pounded chicken breasts and used the stuffing in both sole and chicken.  They were both delicious!!!! I listened to other reviews and halfed the salt and lemon.  I also used panko crumbs on top and then drizzled the lemon butter over the crumbs before baking.  I cooked the chicken an extra 10 minutes.  I am not a fan of stuffed fish, but this was exceptional!  I am making it again next time I have a large family dinner.  Great recipe, Thank you Edna!

This was fantastic!  It was super easy too!  The kiddos and my husband all had clean plates, a rarity!  I only had 4 white fish filets but followed the recipe exactly and just had lots of leftover rice as a yummy side dish which baked right along side the fish.  I had no cheddar so I substituted Edamer- we dont get good cheddar here in Northern Sweden anyways.  The whitefish I used was called Pangasius, like sole a bit, and it worked beautifully!  I thought it would be too dry as the recipe calls for so little of the butter/lemon liquid- but it wasnt at all dry!  Thanks and I will use this one for company too- so pretty!

This was so easy to make and very tasty.  I used catfish since that is what I had in the freezer.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T".  I had trouble keeping the rice mixture in the fish when I rolled it.  So I just took what fell out or was extra and placed it around the fish in the baking dish.  It made for a nice side dish with the fish!

This recipe is one that I will not be making again. There was far too much stufffing for the sole and the rolls did not stay closed.  The flavor was bland and boring.  Had to put extra cheese on top to make it the least bit palatable.

This was a nice idea, different from the typical fish I usually make.  I added some garlic to the rice.  Next time, I would take JD123's advice and make more of the sauce part.

My husband really liked this recipe. I made a lot of changes to it: I used flounder instead of sole as that is what I had in the freezer; added minced garlic and cajun seasoning to the butter mixture. I made this with frozen spinach instead of broccoli. Cooked the rice with pre-fried onions (available at Asian and Indian/Pakistani food markets) and salt, mixed it with cheddar, parmesan, panko bread crumbs, cajun seasoning, ground black pepper, garlic and onion powders, about 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp hot sauce to make the stuffing. I had a lot of stuffing left after filling the fillets, so I just arranged it in the dish around them and baked the whole thing. Topped the rolled fillets with about a tsp of the butter mixture each followed by some parmesan and paprika. Had to bake for about 35 minutes. Turned out very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe. I sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs over the top of the fish. The next time I make it I am going to add garlic and/or onions also in the filling.

This does not sound like it should taste good (cheese and broccoli...ok, sure, but with fish??! eew)— but trust me, it was delicious and not hard to make at all. I had a big bunch on hand, so I chopped scallion to both the filling and the sauce. And the rice I used was brown– still tasted good. Rave reviews from the family.

Due to my fear of undercooking things, I think I overcooked it... nevertheless, it was easy to prepare and didn't smell up the house the way fish usually does, so I liked it.  I added bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and doubled the butter-lemon sauce. I also used cajun seasoning instead of salt.

Was very please with this recipe! Very healthy, and the leftover stuffing was good the next day for lunch!  Good for someone who isn't a fan of very strong tasting fish.

everyone liked this. I used sharp cheddar and it was alittle strong, next time try mild. used leftover chineese rice and fresh brocolli, cut small and steamed first. also put a little panko on top. very good, larry and i liked it best but the kids ate it (except brocolli-MH).good w/tortelliniw
/broc/tomato/butter/parm cheese/lemon pepper
1/10 this time no tortellini on side, just garlic bread from trader joes.  est. 2-3 rolls per person.  extra rice mixture goes in dish and gets baked with it. jack and cheddar mix was perfect.
2/12 made again. i had alot of the rice mix and piled it in the pan and the fish didn't cook all the way through. it was too crowded. next time if i have alot, put it in a separate dish.

This was delcious! I took suggestions from other reviewers in that I added more seasoning (cayenne, garlic powder, parsley, onion powder) to the stuffing mixture to add more flavor. I also added seasoned bread crumbs to the tops of the fish. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, I stuck it in the broiler to crisp and brown up the top. This made all the difference!   My husband loved it too! I will definitely be adding this to my box and will make over and over again.

I liked this dish but my family was not nuts about it. I love fish and veggies and they aren't big fans, ha,ha. I felt like it might have more flavor if there was some sort of light sauce but couldn't come up with anything different.

The broccoli and sole taste weird together. It might be better with spinach instead.

I would rate this 4 1/2  stars if I could.  This was delish.  I too used fresh broccoli, steamed slightly. Brown rice and lemon pepper in place of salt and pepper.  Yummy. Will be making this again, real soon!

Okay, but I thought it was kinda bland. I like that I could make it ahead during my son's nap and just toss it in the oven for dinner.

i have yet to actually try this, but i have had a taste. let me just say, i hate fish. the only fish i like is shellfish and scallops, but for the sake of my diet program and my search for new sources of protein, i decided to give this dish a try since i love broccoli and cheese. i substituted the sole for flounder as i read it is a very mild fish and probably something i'd be okay with. it's in the oven now and it looks good, it smells good, and the bit of fish i did taste seemed okay for me. this may be a dish i'd make again!

My meat and taters husband took one bite, said "this is excellent", gobbled the rest down, and reached for seconds.  Only change I made was subbed 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach (partially cooked) instead of broccoli.  Very easy to put together.

Nice, easy meal. We were out of broccoli and used spinach instead, and it was very good. We also had to add cooking time - the fish was still rare when we pulled it out after 25 minutes. It took another 7 minutes or so before it began to flake. 
Pair it with carrots and you have a pretty mix of colors on your plate.

My guests loved it, especially the presentation (they all thought it could be served in a restaurant). I was less enthusiastic. There was nothing wrong with the flavours, just a little bland. But I will take the suggestions of other Cooks and add some garlic to the butter sauce, as well as make more of the sauce. I will try this one again!
