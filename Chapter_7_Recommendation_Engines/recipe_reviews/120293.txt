Excellent! My husband went crazy for this. I had some refrigerated crescent roll dough that needed to be used up, so I did use that instead of making my own dough. I brushed the dijon mustard on the inside of the dough before assembling. LOVED the pickles in there. Will make again very soon. Thank you!

This is so yummy! I made one change; the store was out of ham so I tried this with roast beef and sliced swiss. Excellent! The pickles add a nice bite. I love the dijon in the dough also. I had to re-read the braiding instructions a few times since I have never made anything like this before, but once the light dawned it was so easy :) I can't wait to try this with ham, thanks for a wonderful recipe that impressed my picky boyfriend! UPDATE: Made this with ham for DBF's family; they loved it! They have a convection oven, I set it for 370 and cooked about 25 minutes. Excellent! UPDATE: Made this for friends and added poppy seeds on top...scrumptious. Only took 25 minutes in my oven.

I made this as directed but also added honey mustard brushed on the inside of the dough, and put caramelized onions between the ham and swiss. Everyone loved it and I will make this often. This recipe is perfect as a base recipe as well. Next time I will try a version of Philly cheese steak. Thanks for this one- a definite keeper.

I, too, didn't make the dough for this since I had a roll of crescent rolls needing to be used.  Just a note on that; if you use crescent rolls, be prepared to check on it and possibly take out the braid early--homemade dough bakes longer than crescent roll dough.  Although the braiding sounds intimidating, it really isn't.  You can mess it up royally (not the same number of cuts on each side, don't really braid it . . .) and it still bakes up prettily, so just do what works for you and you'll be fine.  I also used mustard on the dough and I think I prefer it that way, so even when I eventually get around to trying the dough for this recipe, I'll put mustard on the dough as well as inside it. Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY!! I made this tonight and it was super easy!!! The only changes I made were...instead of making my own dough I used 2 cans of crescent rolls-one on the bottom and the other over the top an folded up the sides...then I caramelized half of an onion and threw in some baby spinach and some fresh basil- I layered that with the cheese and pickles. The pickles are very yummy on it!  I served with peppercorn ranch.

I've had this taped to a recipe card for years and it always turns out wonderful.  I add carmelized onions, and sometimes I double the recipe and freeze one for later.  (Just let it thaw in the fridge overnight before baking.)

We loved this!  I had a jar of yeast and used 4 1/2 teaspoons.  I didn't use 4 cups of flour, it ended up being closer to 3 1/2.  The dough was really stiff and a little hard to work with, but it came out great.  I took the advice of others and drizzled a little mustard inside before braiding.  The result was a lovely warm ham and cheese sandwich with a little mustard and pickle zing.  We sliced it and took it on a picnic!

The taste was  ok, my dough was stiff and chewy.  Will try again using less flour and roast beef and swiss.

This was a huge hit at a party I catered. I used Pilsbury Crescent Dough instead of the dough recipe provided to save time. I made 2 kinds, one ham and one roast beef. For the ham I brushed the dough with dijon mustard and added some caramelized onions between the layers. For the roast beef I brushed the dough with a homemade  horseradish cream and also used the onions with monterey jack cheese. People were raving about it and fighting for left-overs.

I made this for my family who came to my college graduation.  I made it the night before and refrigerated it.  I just popped it into the oven the next morning & it was great for brunch!

Delicious!!!!!!!  I never get the braid quite right,  but it still tastes good!  Sometimes I do half ham and swiss, half turkey with pepperjack.  I've tried the crescent roll short-cut and it works if you're careful not to separate the dough. I've shared this recipe with lots of moms at my MOPS group and we all agree this recipe is a keeper!

Made this for my hubby and I today.  The dough was good, but even after 4 cups it was still pretty sticky...but I am in hot humid Florida.  Hubby doesn't like dill pickels so I used some of the homemade microwave bread and butter pickels from this site and we thought it was a good substitute since the ham I used was a honey ham.  I just think that a pound of the ham is a bit much and my dough was breaking apart as I tried to braid.  All in all the flavor was great and I'll try it again with a few modifications.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I made it in the early 80's and could never find it again.  This is the best ever ham and cheese sandwich.

Oh my this was good! The mustard in the bread was a nice addition. I didn't even add the pickles(we were out) and it was still great!

I cheated a lil bit and used store bought crescent roll dough to make this.  WOW this was amazing.  I made it the first time when we went to my parents.  We spent the day closing down the trailer for the season and were all tired and cold when we got home.  This hit the spot.  Everyone loved it.  In the first week after making it, it has been requested twice and my mother had me write it down for her.  Even my father who is a meat and potatoes man asked for seconds.

This is great!!! Made one to go with some Potato Soup, it is a perfect dipping sandwich for any kind of soup really.  Would like to add: When I add the hot liquid to dry ingredients, I do not stir or mix.. I just add and cover for 5 min, then I start to stir & it seems to be more fluffy that way.

Good recipe versatile recipe. I have made this twice. I do put the 1st 7 ingredients into my bread machine and set to dough setting. This makes it easier for me. I don't like dijon mustard so I substitute honey mustard instead. The 1st time I made it using left over spiral ham and everyone loved it. The 2nd time I made it more like a cheese burger. I mixed ketchup and mustard together for the sauce and spread it on the dough. Topped with a 2 hamburger patties that I cut into large pieces. I kept the pickles. I changed the cheese from swiss to cheddar. It was awesome. This looks so much cooler than a boring calazone. Thanks for the recipe

I have a version of this but thought I would try this one since it was a little different. I didnt care for the pickles in it and the dijon mustard in the bread left it kind of dry. I like the dijon mustard spread on the inside so it's not so dry.

GREAT sandwich!  It's a new favorite for my family.  Easy, and yet looks special enough for company.  Don't cheat on the bread.  It's easy as is, and the mustard cooked into it is part of what makes it so good!

I tried this with the croisants because I love the way they taste....and it was a little difficult to do the braid since the dough tore apart easily, but it's pretty good other than that.  Each person in my family is picky in their own way so I only did the ham and slices of provolone cheese and it was pretty good!  Very basic but good.

This was really good.  The only thing is that it took longer to put together than it said it would.  Next time I will brush some of the mustard on the inside like some people suggested!

Good recipe.  Bread is a little heavy and dry... could use more dijon or other seasoning.  Surprised to say, but really liked the pickles!  Overall good recipe, but will play with it and add to it next time.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe and so did my family. I cut this recipe in half and it fed 4 people with soup. I only had dry active yeast instead of quick yeast so first I proofed the yeast then after kneading I let it rise in a greased bowl for about 30 minutes until doubled. Then I rolled it out. I also didn't need much of the remaining flour added in, Maybe because the change in yeast? Idk. But it came out great. I also used what cheese I had on hand so it was half cheddar and half mozzarella. I will be using this dough recipe for a variety of fillings!!!

The only change I would make next time is decreasing the amount of pickles and maybe adding some dijon mustard in with the filling.  The taste was great, just felt the filling was a little dry.  My husband's only complaint was that there were no leftovers.

I tried this recipe last week after looking for about a month and it was awsome. Everyone loved it. I was suprised at how simple it was to make.

HUGE hit with friends and family!  I used Roast Beef and Provolone, and it was delicious!  Several friends have asked for the recipe - including one who loves that she can make this gluten free for her husband.  My boyfriend was skeptical about it when I told him what I was going to be making, but he has asked that it be put into our regular rotation :) A-freaking-PLUS!

Great base recipe. I tweaked it to fit my family's liking. I made the dough in my kitchen mixer. I only used a half a pound ham, sliced swiss slices, and then sliced onions over that. The braid came out crispy on the outside. The inner bread was perfect. I served slices with sides of pickles and potato chips. The whole family loved it. Next time I will give the inner dough a light brushing of mayo and dijon just for an added punch. The cold leftovers are great as well. Just slice thin and spread a little dijon or mayo over the top. Yum!!

this was soo tasty. I used the dijon with the course mustard. My bread was super tough but I followed the directions. I will try again to see if I can figure out what I did wrong. Love it! quick and easy :)

I honestly hated this recipe and so did my family. I followed the instructions exactly, but it just isn't for us. I have other VERY similar recipes that taste SO much better.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I halved the recipe and did leave the pickles off. Even though we are pickle fanatics; warm pickles aren't quite as appetizing. I served this with ranch for dipping and a side salad. It made a wonderful lunch. :)

I think it was pretty good.  My family said that they liked it.  I used 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of yeast because I DID NOT know what type of yeast I was using (it was from Taiwan and there was no label lol).  Anyway, it was pretty nice.  The braiding was really fun and easy to do.  For people who don't understand the instructions, here is what I did, I first rolled it into a rectangle.  Second, I cut off the corners of ONE of the shorts sides.  And then, I cut the strips and placed the ham onto the middle.  Then I just "braided" it by lifting up each strip one by one, alternating each time.  So I first did one side, then another side.  I also had to bake it longer because the bread's inside was still kind of raw.  I really recommend this recipe though.  Oh, I also omitted the pickles.  Good luck!

Does this recipe have the wrong picture?
The recipe is great, but doesn't look like a pie.
