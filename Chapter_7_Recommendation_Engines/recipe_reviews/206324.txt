Unimpressive. At step 2 where you finish cooking the potatoes in the pan...mine burned and stuck to the pan. If I were to make this again I would separately bake the potatoes at 450 degrees for 30-45 minutes and then add to the pan with onions and coconut milk. But regardless I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was good and flavorful. I wanted my onions caramelized so I started with them and chopped the potatoes while they were cooking then tossed the potatoes in. Once everything was nicely browned I added the spices reduced the heat to medium and then covered the pan so the potatoes would cook faster. I'd use about half the coconut milk next time; this was very saucy. I'd make it again.

My husband and I both liked this recipe.  I used butter with olive oil since I like the flavor of that better.  I replaced the cumin seed with 1/2 tsp of ground cumin and used tomato paste with some chicken stock instead of tomato puree.  Also added some fully cooked meatballs at the end just to warm through, since we're meat eaters.  Served as a main dish for dinner with side "oriental" salad.  Overall wonderful use of potatoes and coconut milk.

In step two I saw that the potatoes were getting dark brown so instead of letting them burn I took them out of the pan and went on to the next step. I think the flavors are just a little muddy and there are no textural contrasts to enjoy. If I were to make this again I would cut the turmeric in half add a bit of garam masala and then garnish with thinly sliced scallion and thin rings of jalapeno peppers. The basic idea is very good and it reminded me of a mild Bombay Potato dish I had once.

I didn't care for this but my husband liked it. I dont think turmeric is the right seasoning for this dish. I cooked the potatoes in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes then added them to the sauce. I used unsweetened cocounut milk which could have accounted for the lack of flavor.

Great as a side dish! it's quite rich and coconut would do best with steamed fish or chicken. Don't skimp on the spices as they add the most flavor. Also didn't have tomato paste on hand so cut up 2 small/medium tomatoes. Turned out just as tasty.

I made as directed but baked potatoes instead of cooking in the pan.  Made a delicious sauce to spoon on the fluffy baked and much less fat.

I roasted the potatoes and added a sweet potato. My family loved it! I followed the rest of the recipe as is.
