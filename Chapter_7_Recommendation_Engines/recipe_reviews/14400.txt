I love this recipe.  I had spinach salad at a restaurant in one of the local casinos and couldn't get enough.  This recipe was every bit as good and so easy to make.  You may need to adjust the sugar to taste.  I also added some sugared pecans.  Eat while hot for the best taste.
Next time I think I will try it with Balsamic vinegar.

Very tasty.  I used balsamic vinegar as opposed to cider vinegar because I didn't have the cider.

I hate to be the downer but I really did not like this recipe. Maybe it was the bacon grease dressing, but it was just "blah." I prefer a spinach salad with red onions and croutons in addition to the bacon, eggs, and mushrooms.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it always gets rave reviews.  I also like to add avocado slices and roasted nuts (either pecans or almonds) to the recipe for variation.

I really like this recipe.  The first time I made it, though, I found that there wasn't nearly enough dressing, so I've doubled it ever since.  Even then, it's a little sparse.  Nonetheless, this is really tasty.  I served it a couple weeks ago, along with a pork roast and oven-roasted potatoes, and our guest (who eats like a bird) really chowed down on this dish.  Very, very good.  Thanks, Monique.

this was really good! i have made it several times since trying it for the first time. i add more bacon than called for and do not always break the stems off of the spinach, but that doesnt matter. my husband likes it too (has even requested it) and he doesnt like raw spinach!

This was so very delicious.  A perfect blend of flavors.  Cleaning and drying the spinach leaves took a while but it was well worth it.  Next time, might add some walnut too.  Definitely a keeper!

Very nice! Used 6 slices of bacon. Added 1.5 cups of chopped/diced chicken breast (from roasted Wal-Mart chicken). Chopped up some green onion and added that as well. Extremely tasty! A repeat for sure, and very soon!

This salad is super delicious and very easy to adapt for anyone on a carb-reduced diet.  I kept everything the same and just used splenda instead of sugar.   Presto-chango....no more carbs!   I also like to add in some diced chicken with the bacon.  Mmmm mmmm mmmmm

This was really tasty.  Waiting until the last minute to add the dressing is best, unless you like very soggy spinach.  Nice flavor.

I thought this salad was fantastic. My mother and boyfriend really enjoyed it as well (and my boyfriend almost exclusively only eats ranch dressing). The vinegar was very tasty. I threw in a splash more, actually, because I love vinegar.

Very yummy and very easy. The most time consuming bit was removing the stems from the spinach. The next time I make it I might not bother. I didn't have any cider vinegar, so I used regular white vinegar, and I loved it. Next time I probably won't add any salt to the dressing as the bacon contains enough by itself.

I've never made my own dressing before, and boy was this tasty! The perfect mixture of sweet and tart, not too oily. Would make a perfect meal with some chicken or fish added!

I'm not a big spinach fan but this recipe was great.  The dressing has just the right amount of sweetness to balance the salty bacon.  A very hearty salad.

I loved this recipe!  For the ultimate of time-savers, buy the pre-packaged, pre-washed spinach in a bag from your local grocery store.  I used red wine vinegar and enjoyed it very much.

Very good recipe.  There wasn't anything left!  My Dad, whom usually will only eat spinach with vinegar, had seconds.  I added two extrea slices of bacon and that really brought out the contrast in tastes.

Yum! Used turkey bacon and some bacon bits. I let them(bacon) sit in about two tablespoons of warmed olive oil to infuse bacon flavor.I also added about half of a finely chopped small sweet onion to bacon-olive oil mix. Plan on growing spinach in my garden this year just so I can make this more often. Yummy!!!

Hesitant to try it, as I'm not a huge spinach salad fan, I chose this one for the ease, the list of ingredients (had everything on hand) and the other ratings. Delicious!! Will definitely be making this one more often.

absolutely loved this one - the boyfriend pretended not to be hungry but promised to taste his; next thing I knew his plate was empty and he was looking for more.   I liked it, too - will definitely make again and again!!

Loved the wonderful flavors, textures and aroma of this salad and its perfect for my low carb diet. Just subbed Sweet & Low for the sugar. Added some red onion, too. Great recipe that I now find myself craving on a weekly basis.

Yummy yummy yummy.  I used a touch more bacon fat because I thought the dressing was a little too watery.  Next time I will probably decrease the water so I don't increase the calories :)  And I only used an 1/8 of a tsp of salt and it was fine.

I reduced the recipe down to two servings so I don't know if that had anything to do with this but we thought this was just OK. It was very salty so next time I will reduce the salt or just leave it out. Didn't have cider vinegar so I used regular distilled. I think this may have done something to the dressing as well.  It seemed like there was too much grease and not enough sweetness. I am going to make this again today and just follow the original recipe, I would bet the results will be better. Also used bagged spinach and precut mushrooms. What a quicky.

I thought that this salad was ok, because I don't care all that much for sweet dressings.  My mother said it reminds her of the spinach salad her mother made when she was a kid.  I have to say this much though, the simplicity of the preparation couldn't be much easier.  The dressing was especially easy.  A time saving hint: if you save bacon grease, use the recommended amount of that, and put real bacon bits on the salad.

Not bad - the salad itself is a great start but the dressing had its flaws.  In a nutshell it was too watery, too sweet and lacking any real depth or complexity of flavor. This could be improved by eliminating the water, decreasing the sugar and considering using honey instead, and adding a smidge of Dijon mustard.

I love this recipe. It reminds me of the mushroom salad at The Melting Pot. The dressing is really good, so I make more. I also like to use 1 tsp honey instead of the sugar, but otherwise I make it as the recipe suggests.

i was disappointed-  the dressing was not very "tangy" & just tasted way too oily without any flavor.  i did like the combo of the spinach, mushrooms, bacon & eggs & added tomato as well.  but i'm STiLL looking for a good dressing!

This was delicious.  I only had a bag of mixed greens, so I used that and I only had regular salad vinegar....and it turned out delicious!  I even made more to bring for lunch!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I don't have kids yet, but my husband was very pleased and my doggie loved the bites of bacon we gave her! :)

Not a fan.  I really didn't like the dressing in this salad.  I'm glad I tasted it prior to tossing the spinach in it as it was just too greasy for me.  I ended up making an impromptu dressing (mayo, milk, apple cider vinegar, salt & pepper) and it was much lighter and my guests gobbled it up!

Made exactly except I added 2 more eggs and diced instead of quartered them. This was an entire meal for my husband and me.Actually he had about 3/4 of the salad because he has a big appetite. Of course, this would be an excellent side! One more caveat=it is very easy to prepare...*g*

Great recipe!  Easy to make and tasted like a gourmet salad.  Hubby and I loved it!  I cheated and used the packaged real bacon pieces, but I did warm them in some olive oil w/the mushrooms, some minced garlic and 4 chopped green onions.  I also used Splenda instead of the white sugar in the dressing, and only used the egg whites on the salads, and it still turned out great.  Thanks for a new favorite salad!

I've made this twice and the 2nd time I used low-fat Western dressing with a little bacon drippings added to it (instead of the vinegar mixture.)  My family raved about it!

Loved it!  I added croutons and red onion as suggested by others, and also threw in an extra slice of bacon.

The sweet, tangy, dressing is a hit at this house. Make extra dressing, keep refridgerated and enjoy later.

I've always loved this salad.  Found I needed 8 slices of bacon to produce the bacon grease needed.  Also used 1 Tbs of apple cider vinegar & 1 Tbs of white balsamic.  I want to use all of my spinach in my raised bed garden for this salad!

Great recipe, The dressing is perfectly lovely- I made it with olive oil instead of bacon grease which is much more heart healthy. Tasted great! thank you for the recipe!

Quite liked this recipe. Had bacon bits so just used 2 tbsp. vegetable oil instead of bacon fat. Quick, easy and tasty!
My husband had never had a warm dressing and he really enjoyed it as well. Will definitely make this again!

The dressing is light and a little vinegar-y but overall very tasty. I would probably double the amount of dressing, the service for 4 wasn't quite enough.

I gave this four stars only because I made several changes for my families taste.  I cut the sugar, vinegar, and water in half.  We just prefer it that way.  I left out the eggs and added minced garlic and red onion slices.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe exactly except for using only 7oz of spinach as I was only serving two.    My husband said it needed more egg.  I also doubled the dressing as suggested by others.  I used olive oil  instead of bacon grease for the doubling because I didn't have enough.  We really liked it and I will definitely make it again.

I love spinach salads and this one was a treat. 

I did double up on the dressing as others had noted it was dry. I also used shiitake mushrooms and a good, thick sliced, smokey bacon. 

This was a pre meal salad and made a great presentation. There was none left!  Will definitely repeat.

based upon others reviews, I increased the amount of dressing. A lot! I used olive oil instead of bacon fat, and  a half and half mix of balsamic and cider vinegar. I made about a cup of dressing, for about 12 ounces of spinach. My guests did everything but like the bowl! :) (I also used the precooked bacin from Costco)
