This was delicious and perfect served over rice.  The mixture of cornstarch and water was a little concerning as it hardened immediately, but once added to the egg & beef mixture it was fine. The only change I made was to add some mushrooms that I wanted to use up.  This was a hit.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't know who could put that on the table in 45 minutes but it is not me. I will make it again over the weekend though. I don't eat much sugar and I was dubious since carrots and ginger are also sweet. The sugar with the soy sauce reminded me of Dr. Pepper just a little. Next time I'll use just a bit of honey. I like veggies and was going to add broccoli but I didn't, next time I will. 4 stars for a recipe that sounded so delicious it pulled me out of my comfort zone (cornstarch and frying were a first for me). 1 star off only because of personal preference.

My kids liked it but my husband and I found the sauce too sweet and we did not like the coating for the meat. It wasn't crispy.

I fried beef in about 1 cup of olive oil. I used baby carrots cut in half, baby red, yellow and orange peppers cut in rings, and substituted 1/2 jalape√±o and 1/2 serrano pepper, chopped,  for the red chile flakes. I also added 1 tbs. fish sauce.  Loved it served on jasmine rice.

You know when you catch yourself licking the pan you found something great! I did make a few minor changes. I mixed the water with the egg before adding the cornstarch to make it easier to mix, and I doubled the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and 4X the red pepper flakes and mixed them together before adding to the vegetables so there would be more sauce leakage onto the rice.
