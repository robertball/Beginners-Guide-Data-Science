I am so sorry but this recipie is really bad.  Imagine all the cumin and tyme for only four cooked cups rice, then imagine six bland chicken breasts baked on top.  Thats exactly what is is and what it tastes like!  It was really strong rice with bland chicken.  I decided to make this because it seemed a lot healthier than other chicken and rice dishes, but I was so disappointed.  To make matters worse I had a friend over to eat that night, and when I offered to put frozen pizza in for her instead she accepted!

I went back and re-worked this recipe.  It's listed as a separate recipe because I cannot edit this one.  Most of the spices are now listed "To Taste".  As you read the reviews you will see where other people have thrown their own versions into this to make it their own which is basically what I did the first time I made this.  I can tell you which spice is in all my dishes but I vary the amounts based on what taste I am looking for.  My advice is to always start with very little spice and then gradually add each one to reach your preference.  What's good to me may taste horrible to someone else.  So, play with it, Use Creme of Mushroom instead of Creme of Chicken, try adding a little Garlic, things like that.  You'll find this is a very easy and quick recipe.

Please don’t pay attention to the negative reviews here!  This recipe is a real gem for a quick and easy and DELICIOUS dinner!  Great with dilled peas and buttered soft French bread!!  Along with the water - I used one can of Amy’s Organic Cream of Mushroom soup, 1 heaping tablespoon of Sylvia’s Lemon Pepper seasoning, a heaping ½ tsp of cumin, fresh (not dried) thyme, ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp dried lemon peel, and the juice of ½ small lemon (last three my additions).  The beauty in a recipe that most of the ingredients are “to taste” means that if it is bland – then it is the fault of the cook, NOT of the recipe’s author!!!  The only suggestion I have for the author is to have listed salt to taste – because a lot of new cooks wouldn’t know to do that “to taste”  - even if it’s not listed.    I mixed the above with my already cooked/diced chicken and just-cooked jasmine rice. I cooked for a shorter time, since my chicken was cooked already. This was absolutely delicious and I will fix it again and again!!!  Thanks a bunch “Uncle Josh”!!!

If only it tasted as good as it smells. It's very bland and definitely missing something. If I were to make it again, and I doubt I will, I would probably cut the cumin in half and add some garlic.

I liked this recipe as a starting point.  I made the rice as shown, but added a bit of garlic.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic & herbs before cooking.  Tasted great!  Tweak this recipe to your taste & you'll have a quick and yummy dinner.

We loved this recipe!  Easy and delicious.  We used 3 chicken breasts instead of 6 which was plenty - I don't think there would have been enough rice for 6 chicken breasts!  We will definitely make it again!!!

My family loved this dish!  Don't be scared off by the negative reviews... a good cook adds their own personal flair to most recipes.  Go for it!  I added a little garlic, but this recipe had plenty of flavor.  Served with a veggie side dish it is a real winner!

This is just a basic recipe you can make your own. I omitted the cumin, added some sage and garlic and it wasn't too bad at all.  It was my personal preference, I just don't like cumin and thyme together.

This was good! I didn't have cream of chicken soup on hand, but I did have cream of asparagus, which worked out well. I seasoned the chicken with some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and lemon pepper seasoning. The whole family enjoyed this meal.
