Very good, very easy, great way to use venison. I always do venison this way. When butchering, I save the back straps, loins, jerky roasts, and some for burger or brats. Then I can the rest. It last years and keeps the flavor. Extremely fast and easy to pull out, warm up in a pan, mix in some corn starch/water for gravy, then serve over mashed potatoes or noodles. You should try if you are canning capable.

In the past I have done something similar but only used kosher salt. The minced garlic and onion add to it. I love having the meat canned - it is super easy to make deer and noodles or stews/soups

I'm not the biggest fan of venison, but this recipe is delicious.  We got an old buck this year and I was concerned it might be too game-y.  I mostly followed the recipe (without the peppers), but I didn't mix the meat and spices in a bowl first.  It produces so much liquid that the spices get well-mixed during the canning process.

I used quart jars (must process for 90 minutes).  I placed the cubed venison in the jars with some onion and a few garlic cloves on top.  I sprinkled the salt and pepper on top of that.  I used 1 teaspoon for the quart and found it to be almost a little too salty, so the next time I made it, I used slightly less than 1 tsp.

It's not the most attractive concoction in a clear jar, but it's really tasty and tender.  We gave some to a friend who absolutely loved it.  We've used it as is and mixed with bbq sauce, seasoned black beans, or a canned tomato/black-eyed pea mix.  It's very versatile.

It's a keeper!

You don't state what size jar you are using, pints?  If so, quarts should be processed for 90 minutes, correct?

We love canned venison and with several deer hunters in our house this is a great way to use some of the meat.   People that swear they won't eat venison, love this and usually ask to take a jar home. :)
This can be processed in quarts too. Just adjust your time in the pressure canner to 90 minutes.

If you are canning meat, you MUST use a pressure canner. Meat is a low acid food and a hot water bath canner will not heat up enough to kill botulism spores no matter how long you can them. Only the steam of a pressure canner gets hot enough. You can only use hot water bath safely for high acid foods like jams and salsa.

Rather than salt, I use 2 bouillon cubes, as they are mostly salt, and add a little flavor. (I do quart jars). Some jars get a few mushrooms added as well. 4 or five jalapeno slices add a nice mild heat and great flavor. No need to be shy with the garlic either.

I love this recipe but I do add one clove garlic per quart jar adding equal amount spices, onion,peppers divided up for each jar for more exact flavor. Makes excellant sandwich spread when you open a canned jar up pour into a bowl just add mayo or miracle whip what ever is your favorite and pickle relish mix to combine slather onto your favorite bread and enjoy!

We love this recipe, I put a tsp of soup base in the bottom of the jar,salt, garlic clove and onion.It lasts for years. I know some govt. agency says only keep for a year but my family has been canning for my whole life (60) and we have just eaten some stroganoff that the jar was dated 2004.This is the best way to eat venison year round.

This is a great simple recipe for canning venison. However, I don't normally put anything but salt and pepper in my jars when I can it. I don't even season the meat before I pack the jars either. The venison rarely needs any extra seasonings at all as its delicious all on its own. If you want to season it, I would season it when you cook it rather then when canning it. 
Also, I don't have a pressure cooker so I water bath mine for 3 hours instead.

This is my familys favorite way to eat venison.  I use this to make stew which is so easy with this canned venison compared to fresh.  I also use it with gravy over noodles or rice.  I use quart jars and at my altitude, 90 minutes is recommended by the manufacturer of my canner.  I use onion soup mix and garlic to coat the cubes before they go in the jar.

This was easy. My husband is a vivid hunter and he has been asking me forever to can some deer meat. After weeks and days of searching for an recipe, and this is why i’m rating it. This seemed to fit my needs. He had the butcher cut up meat for canning. Took other reviewers suggestions and added some Asian beef soup base for flavor and omitted the salt, and added some diced jalapeño in place of Green pepper for more kick up flavor. I had three pounds and it divided nicely and evenly into 3 half qt jars.  haven’t tried it but it looks good and can’t wait to try over butter noddles, steam rice, garlic mash taters,etc.

We rave about this all the time.  My husband is great at it.  My kids love the meat!  It works out great during the week.  Open up a jar, heat it up in a few minutes in a pan, and throw it on top of noodles or rice or mashed potatoes.  The meat is tender and does NOT have a wild taste at all.  Its great to have in the house!

No changes to the recipe aside from a bit more garlic, also didn't have an green pepper so that was excluded. I just did a pound last night and ended up with 3 half pint jars. This was a trial run. I just cracked one of them and it was good, but a bit salty. I ate it from the jar with a fork. This would work well if added to a stew or vegetable soup! The only whole meat i had left was a backstrap so thats what i used. Of course very tender and falling apart. I'd like to try with some different cuts so i need to get back out in the woods before the season ends. The meat i used was in the freezer for a year and turned out great. Now i wish i had not made so much burger. 
Overall i'm very pleased with the result and thank you for posting this.

This is a great way to process venison! Stores well... no freezer burn... readily available for BBQ sandwiches, soup, nuggets, or chili.

Great recipe! I have made it all I can say is it needs more salt. Wonderful. Not sure how long they last on a shelf?

I can't help but notice the residue on the finished jars in your pic, quick tip; if you add a splash of vinegar to the caner, it will eliminate that.
Great recipe though, how could you NOT like this? Garlic, onions, peppers with venison. . .it's hard to beat. I also can mine with nothing but a pinch of salt in each jar, and that comes out delish as well!

Very close to my recipe.  I can both pint and quart jars so I can make a meal for 2 or bigger meals without opening extra cans.  I use the meat with egg noodles, some canned veggies(from our garden) a chopped onion and a little beef base.  Best plate of food ever.
