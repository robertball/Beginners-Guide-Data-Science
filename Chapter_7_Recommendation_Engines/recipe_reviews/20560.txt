This lemonade is more tart than sweet like pink lemonade usually is.  I served this at a party and everyone loved it...even the kids that were there!  My husband who doesn't like cranberry juice like it too!

I certainly hope bdh76 didn't put 9 cups of sugar in this!! That would definitely make it sweet- haha! I only put 1 1/2 as opposed to 2, everything else I followed exactly. This turned out to be more of a cranberryade for me though... I only put the 1 cup in, but you can taste the cranberry over the lemon. If you want it  to look more pink you'll have to add a few drops of red food coloring too. All in all a VERY tasty drink though!!

Yum!!!  This is my first review on the site, though I've tried hundreds of recipes. I thought the lemonade a little sweet.  Probably don't need 9 cu. sugar. Otherwise, definitely a keeper!

This lemonade is a great addition to any gathering.  I use Splenda instead of sugar and it's just as good.  Thank you for this refreshing drink.

This lemonade is quite refreshing! I used a bottled lemon juice, (which I purchased from Aldi's) rather than using fresh lemon juice, and it tasted great in this lemonade. I also used a raspberry-cranberry juice, which I purchased from Aldi's. The amount of ingredients I used were... 1-cup of sugar, 4-1/2 cups of water, 1-cup of lemon juice, and 3/4 cup of cranberry juice. This will make exactly 56 ounces of the best tasting lemonade. Tonni, thank you for posting this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!

This was a really good tart-sweet lemonade. We have juiced a bunch of lemons and are now freezing the juice in 2cup measures just to make this!

Hubs loves cranberry juice and he loved this too - me not so much. While I'm not particularly crazy about cranberry juice that wasn't even the issue.  Pretty and pink but  too sweet for me.

i have to say that the sugar was just far to much, i only used 1 1/2 cups and it was still very sweet. the cranberry made it 'clacky' and covered any nice lemony flavour which may heve been there. I added just a small amout of rasberry juice (juste nought to make it pink) and my family and i loved it.

Fantasitic!  The only thing that I did differently was make a simple syrup with 2c of the water with the 2c of the sugar and then I mixed it in.  Took me 7 lemons for 2c of lemon juice.

My son is a huge pink lemonade fan, so I made this for him to try.  He gave it 2 thumbs up!  We didn't use quite 2 cups of sugar as he likes his less sweet.  Sure hits the spot!

This was nice and tart, which me and one of my kids absolutely loved. My husband and other son thought it needed more sugar. Absolutely wonderful, going on my opinion alone. I loved the combination of lemon juice and cranberry juice. SO good!

This recipe is sweeter than I prefer my lemonade, but a base recipe! I love to eat lemons like apples, so as you can imagine I like my lemonade tart. The first time I made it I used 2 cups frozen raspberries and blended them with 2 cups water to make 'raspberry juice'. i strained it and used that in place of the cranberry -- it was a huge hit. I also took the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. The next time I made it i used frozen strawberries. Because they are so sweet, and I had made a bigger batch i did the following: 1 1/2 c frozen strawberries, 14 cups water, 1 1/2 c sugar and 4 c lemon juice. it was perfect! I had a bbq yesterday with about 15 people total and ended up making 6 GALLONS of this in 2 hours!

This is DELICIOUS! I first made this for my daughter's b-day party. It ended up being 3 quarters of a recipe because I didn't get a full 2 cups of lemon juice out of 7 lemons. It was so good the adults didn't want to share it with the kids, even though I made it for the children. I just made it for a 2nd time and since lemons aren't cheap here in MD, I decided to use bottled lemon juice like another reviewer suggested. The bottled lemon juice made it a little too tart so I decided to add an extra cup of cranberry juice. It still turned out delicious with a more reasonable expense! Much healthier than from a can that contains high fructose corn syrup.

I squeezed 8 lemons to make this recipe and it was yummo.  I also used Cran-Ras juice.  The juice wasn't pink enough, so I added 2 drops of red food dye just to make it really 'pink' =)

UPDATE: Made a second batch of lemonade yesterday b/c I bought way too many lemons the first time! Still excellent. Actuallly, I thought it was even better the second day (I just finished the glassful left from last night). Very good! Made this last night for my bf and I. We both had a taste for pink  lemonade made with fresh ingredients. This didn't take much time at all to prepare. I scaled the recipe to make 4 servings. One complaint. This is a bit expensive to make (the cheapest lemons I could find in the Chicagoland area were $1.79 a lb.), so I think I'll pull this out for "special" occasions or when lemons are on sale! I just can't justify spending the $'s when Minute Maid lemonade is available for under $2 per half gallon (although not nearly as good...). Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I halved the recipe just to try this out. I couldn't stop drinking this. And it's such a pretty drink, too. The cranberry juice adds just the right amount of tartness, different from that of the lemon, but doesn't overpower the lemon flavor.  I'll be making this all the time when summer finally arrives!

Replaced the 2 cups of sugar with 1 1/2 cups Splenda and used bottled lemon...and thought this was the perfect balance of sweet-tart.  This made up very quickly and will be a regular drink especially in the warmer months!  Thanks for a super simple and yummy drink!

Great recipe - just right for an Alice in Wonderland tea party!  I will try bottled lemon juice next time - to have to use 10 cold lemons in England in December to get 2 cups worth is just too much!

this is great! i did use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh lemons because i was short on time. it was much more tart than my family would like so i had to add a little more sugar. next time i will try using fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I knew when i looked at the ingredient list i would love this because I love cranberry juice.  I followed to the T, but only had cranberry rasberry juice, so thats what i used, and it was GREAT!thanks!

Nice and refreshing, but I would increase the amount of cranberry juice and skimp on the sugar a bit next time.

This is exactly the way I make my pink lemonade and I wouldn't make it any other way.  Mine isn't tart though, so I might have a little more sugar in my recipe.  This can be adjusted according to taste so easily, and both fresh lemons and cranberries are so good for you!  A winner recipe!

Refreshing! I doubled the recipe, made simple syrup (as suggested) and because I used very sweet Meyer lemons from my tree, I added two more to “tart” it up a bit. Simple and delicious

A tasty concoction. I never thought to use cranberry juice to make a lemonade. I cut back on the sugar per other reviews. I only used 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar. Next time, I will add some pulp as my family likes pulp in their lemonade.

First of all my daughter loved it! I am thinking it is just a tad too sweet for my personal preference. I will try lessening the sugar by a 1/2 cup the next time to see if it will help. Over all it was a great recipe. I will be making this again.

Very, very pale pink and much too sweet. Added an extra three fourths cup cranberry juice and that seems to do the trick. Very yum.

An important note to everyone who plans to make this recipe; pay close attention to what I'm about to write! This is very important to the recipe! At least a couple of people who made this have misread the recipe. You only add 2 cups of sugar, NOT 9 cups! It's 9 cups of WATER! The juice will be disgustingly sweet if you add 9 cups of sugar! Follow the recipe as it is written and you will have a delicious pink lemonade!  :)

This was great stuff. I made it exactly as written. My pitcher wasn't big enough for everything, though, so I used a stockpot! It occurred to me that it's probably hard to find actual cranberry juice, and the recipe probably meant "cranberry juice cocktail" (I used Ocean Spray's "original"). I like it, but I wondered if it would work well in this recipe. It was a great surprise how the sugar mellowed out the tartness of the lemon and cranberry juices. I'd never thought about how pink lemonade "should" be made, but this tasted pretty authentic to me!
