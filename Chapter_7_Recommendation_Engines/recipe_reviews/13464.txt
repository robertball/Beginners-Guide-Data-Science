This was the best turkey I have ever made or eaten. I could not believe how moist and tender the breast was! My thanksgiving was made perfect with this delicious bird. Everyone asked how I did it, even my elderly aunt, who is the best cook ever, raved about it. I used about a stick and a half of butter under the skin. I buttered that bird good. I also rubbed the outside of the bird with butter before pouring the boullion mixture and before the seasoned salt. It was such a beautiful golden brown. I was so busy that day that I only got it basted a couple of times during cooking, but it couldn't have been any better or jucier. This was a 21 pound bird, and I cooked it for 1 hour at 375 degrees then reduced to 350 degrees for 5 more hours to reach 180 degrees. Perfect!!! Thanks a million Robin!!

This is a wonderful recipe for beginners as well as the experienced cook.  I put this bird in the oven, went to the movies, came back to a moist succulent turkey. It's that easy. I put butter under the skin of the legs too (in total I use 1 cube for the entire bird). I also add black pepper to the seasoning. Every bite is moist!!  You can't go wrong!! Lots of wonderful pan juiced to make gravy with. Superfine flour called "Wondera" by Gold Medal is a must for new cooks. Your gravy will be lump free. Taste your gravy after you have thickened it to see if you need to add anymore salt and pepper. If too salty, just dilute with water and a little more flour...until it tastes good. Easy gravy!

We had an early Thanksgiving feast this year with family and at the last minute, my sister, who was supposed to bring the turkey, went to the hospital and I told her not to worry about a thing.  I have never cooked a turkey before and had no idea what I was doing!  I looked up "turkey" on this site and found this recipe.  I read some reviews and decided this was it.  I had a 23 pound turkey so I doubled the recipe and threw it in the roaster while it was still a bit frozen.  This was at 9:00pm the night before the feast.  Then I forgot about it, didn't even have time to baste it at all the next day.  We didn't wind up eating until after 1:00.  About 10 minutes before we ate, I took the tin foil off and prayed it was good.  Not only was it good, it was juicy and fell off the bone!!!  
I think I should also say that when I read the recipe, I thought you had to cut the skin to get the butter on the meat itself, but my husband pointed out that the recipe did not say to "cut" the skin.  He got under the skin and pulled it from the meat really easily and I think that's what you're supposed to do.  I didn't know that, since this was my very first turkey.  My family requested that I "volunteer" to do the turkey from now on.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!  Now I know how to cook a moist, delicious turkey!

This recipe turned out great!  I added 1 tsp. garlic powder to the water along with the bouillon, parsley and onion.  Put fresh rosemary under the breast skin with the butter.  Also placed a quartered lemon and quartered onion inside the cavity.  Used a 12 lb. bird as recommended and it was done in 3 hours.  Allowed it to rest 20 minutes before carving.  Be sure to spray the foil with cookong spray.

I had never cooked a turkey before, and decided to try this recipe when I made Thanksgiving dinner for 28 people!  EVERYONE loved it, and some even said it was the best they'd ever had!  I've used it every year since.  Using a cooking bag really helps to seal in the flavor, making the meat very moist.  I also like to make a butter mixture with garlic salt, and use that to make the breast meat juicy and flavorful.

My Thanksgiving turkey was the BEST turkey I have ever tasted, and the family RAVED over it.  Before you place the butter under the skin, do this... take an entire stick of butter (or more depending on the size of your bird) and place it in a food processor or blender.  Blend in a handful of fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme.  Spread this mixture beneath the skin of the ENTIRE turkey.  If any butter is remaining, spread it over the top of the turkey.  Be liberal in your buttering of the turkey... it's worth it, and it's the holidays!! DO NOT add the parsley to the mixture you pour over the turkey... it makes a clumpy, ugly mess. Otherwise, this recipe is fantastic. It will make the juiciest, tastiest turkey ever, and the gravy you will make with the drippings will be like nothing you have ever tasted.  I also used the "Out of This World Turkey Brine" found on this site one day before roasting.  Then I used the "Cranberry, Sausage, and Apple Stuffing". Amazing.  I will cook every turkey this way from now on.

If you customize this recipe for a larger turkey....DO NOT INCREASE THE SALT TO THE RECOMMENDED PORTION. Season it as you would to your personal taste.  I made this mistake and my gravy was sooooo salty. Big mistake!

I cannot believe I forgot to rate this.  I made this for Thanksgiving.  My second time ever making turkey.  THIS is BY FAR The BEST turkey I have ever had.  All anyone could say is how great it was. It actually was not dry and had flavor.  I put a little more butter than it called for under the skin and rubbed butter over the top.  And basted as prescribed.  AWESOME the ONLY turkey recipe we will ever use.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey tonight and it turned out excellent.  I used an 18lb butterball turkey with the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 hours.  I also created an incredible gravy from the the drippings & liquid.  Next time, I think will also use some garlic!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I don't eat turkey, but coooked this for the big family Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved this, even my mainly vegetarian niece who tried a little bit.  My sister said the meat was so tender it melted in her mouth and hubby was able to use the cooking liquid to make a killer gravy!  Instead of dried minced onion, I threw in some freshly minced shallots and garlic then stuffed it with the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry stuffing.  What a perfect pair!

This is the best turkey I've ever tasted! I made it for company and everyone loved it!! I had a 12lb turkey and cooked it for exactly 3 1/2 hours. I lined the bottom of a roasting pan with foil, put turkey and broth, then covered the pan and turkey with a big paper bag. I took the bag off the last hour. The gravy I made with the broth was so good!! Everyone was snorting as they ate. I'll never use any other turkey recipe again!

OK, I know everyone's written about this recipe, but I just have to say that we NEVER eat turkey. I made this for Christmas last year (I was in a "traditional" mode) It literally fell off the bone. It was incredible. We devoured it. NOTHING LEFT.
  Since then, we've made it several times. Each time - amazing results. I have referred many people to this recipe. It's worth it's weight in gold!

Wow!  This was the BEST turkey I've ever made!  It was moist, tender and tasted great.  After reading reviews, I used a whole cube of butter and put it under the skin all over (not just the breast).  That definitely improved the tenderness of the drumsticks and wings.  A few substitutions for what I had on hand:  3 chicken bouillon cubes instead of measuring out 3 Tbsp., minced fresh parsley and onion instead of dried, and lemon pepper instead of seasoning salt.  Using an oven bag and basting every hour (thru the slits cut in the bag), it took 3-1/2 hours to cook a 23 lb. turkey.  On turkey #1, the bag stuck to the breast skin in some places.  On turkey #2, I oiled the inside of the bag above the breast which reduced the sticking skin and made the breast look much nicer. To make the gravy, I removed the pan juices and heated about 2 Tbsp of the separated fat (top layer) with 2 Tbsp of flour over medium heat until it bubbled (like making white sauce).  Then I whisked in about 2 cups of the pan juice (bottom layer). The gravy was fantastic!  Thanks to Robin for posting this wonderful recipe and thanks also to everyone who posted their helpful reviews!

I first reviewed this on Nov. 20 but after reprinting it since I lost mine went through the reviews again and decided to update since I seen some had some issues with it being dry and not browning.  I used a 23 pound turkey and replaced the water with chicken broth. I used the same amount of butter for the pockets, rubbed it with olive oil and I took the foil off the last hour so it could brown.  I also let the turkey rest covered with foil for 30 minutes before carving so the juices would flow back throughout the turkey. After transferring the carved pieces to the platter there was still juices left on the platter after the turkey was all gone.  That's how juicy the turkey turned out to be. 

Nov. 20th review:  This makes the best turkey, moist, tender, delish.  I found this recipe last Thanksgiving and use it to cook turkey year round. I do add quite a bit more chicken stock (personal preference) and make gravy with the drippings. Yummy

Wow, easy and great! And moist! Last year I made "Perfect Turkey" from this site, which required both brining and turning over during cooking. Don't bother with either! Make this much-easier and just-as-good turkey instead! The only changes I made were to put the turkey on a bed of onion, celery & carrot chunks, and to stuff a few pieces of the above plus a chopped apple into the cavity. None of these veggies are eaten, but they give the turkey and juices a great flavor. Don't use the cooking times in the recipe as my 20-lb bird took only 4 hours. (Also note that in ingredient list, "broth" is supposed to read "bouillon.")

This will be the 5th year making a Thanksgiving dinner with this recipe and I have yet to be disappointed. The only change I make, is that I cook the turkey (usually around 17-24lbs) inside a Reynolds turkey-sized bag and place all of the ingedients inside the bag as written. I follow the cooking time instructions listed for the cooking bag. The turkey is always extremely moist and there are always tons of drippings for gravy. It usually takes me 2 1/2 - 3 hours, which is a little quicker.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  I was raised a half mile from Cornwell's turkey farm outside of Marshall Michigan.  I can tell you that this is the closest you will get to their "secret recipe" from their restaurant.  The only difference is they soak their fresh turkey in a salt brine (2 cups salt, cover turkey with water - soak over night) before they cook them. Use home made or commercial turkey or chicken broth instead of the bullion and water, fresh chopped onion and fresh parsley in pace of the dried also.  Out of this world!

Wonderful recipe. Made is exactly as directed!

But...can anyone help me out??
When I make it for Thanksgiving next week, I will be using a 16 pound turkey. How long would I cook it in order for it to not dry out?
I almost always cook my poultry too long :(

This was a fantastic turkey....I did change a few ingredients.  Instead of warm water I used half chicken broth and half apple cider.  I also reduced the butter I put under the skin.  This was a great juicy tasty turkey.  And the gravy I made with the drippings was one of the best I ever made.  Oh my bird was 13 pounds and it was done in just over 3 hours.  Five stars with my changes....thanksRobin!

This was a fantastic turkey....I did change a few ingredients.  Instead of warm water I used half chicken broth and half apple cider.  I also reduced the butter I put under the skin.  This was a great juicy tasty turkey.  And the gravy I made with the drippings was one of the best I ever made.  Oh my bird was 13 pounds and it was done in just over 3 hours.  Five stars with my changes....thanksRobin!

I tried this recipe last year (my first turkey all by myself)...it was AWESOME!! The meat was so juicy and tender! I am making this again this year. I added two things of my own, which I learned from watching my parents every year. I put the butter under the skin like the recipe says, but then I also rub the whole bird with butter. I also put strips of bacon on top during the last hour or so. The bacon cooks right onto the skin and makes it so yummy. 
This is definetly a great recipe. You can cut down on the water a little bit. Other than that...it's great!!

My confusion is if you cover the bird itself with foil, or if you make a foil tent. It isn't very clear. If someone could please help with that, I would appreciate it. Looking forward to preparing this for Thanksgiving.

I make this every year.  I first reviewed it in 2003 under Dylnic.  I wanted to add I use HERB OX chicken boullion granules.  It is the best.  Nice and flavorful and has herbs in it.  Secondly if you are hesitant about the amount of seasoning salt I never measure much.  Just sprinkle like you would any other thing to season to your tasting.  I go crazy with the butter.  I put under all skin I can and even rub all over the bird.. We love this recipe.  The only turkey I will make.  Of coarse I don't let mom know how I make it because she just looks at me funny when I said boullion. lol.  I can't wait to cook this in two days again.  As others said if you have a bigger bird you don't neccesarily increase the seasonings.  Except maybe a little more boullion and water.  Sometimes I use a can of swansons broth.  10 years later still making it every year for Thanksgiving.

This was really good. I didn't have minced onion so I used a small minced yellow onion. I used a whole stick of butter under the skin and it was very moist. I added 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 c cold water and extra water to make about 4 cups to the pan drippings and it made delicious gravy. Yum!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was the best turkey I have ever made!  It was so moist and full of flavor.  I made the recipe "as is" but the next time I make it the only change I will make is cutting down on the seasoning salt.  With 2 tablespoons the drippings were so salty that my gravy was almost ruined, I had to keep adding  water to try and dilute the salt.  About 1/4 or 1/2 of this amount will be what I try next time.

This recipe is VERY good.  I think the reason it works is because it is basically being steamed not roasted.  It says cover with foil and I take that to mean completely covered (sealed) not just a foil tent.  It cooks quicker this way too and once you take off the cover browns up beautifully at the end.  There are so much drippings for gravy it's awsome and delicous too!.  I was leary about putting so much seasoned salt on the skin so I just put a little bit.  The only thing that would be good is a rack in the pan to keep the turkey out of the liquid but it's still not a huge deal.  I hope lots more people try this method.  Thanks Robin

To make pockets in a turkey (or chicken) you gently seperate the skin over the breast so that there is a pocket between the meat and the skin. You can use your fingers or the end of a wooden spoon. Be careful not to tear the skin. Then, smoosh the butter into the pocket between the skin and meat. Hope this helps!

Awesome recipe...Very similar to the one I usually use except I do add garlic powder to it and I cook it 2/3 of the time with the breast side down and then the final stretch I turn it.  This eliminates the need to baste and still gives the skin plenty of time to crisp up and get golden...

Wow! Thanks for posting Robin! I'm so glad that I decided to try this procedure for roasting turkey! I used 1 Tbls. Better than Bouillon Turkey Base in lieu of the chicken 'broth' (assumed that Robin meant bouillon/base since it was only 3 Tbls.) and only used 2 cups water, but ended up with almost 1 quart of fabulously flavored stock when the liquid was poured off, strained and defatted! Easiest, tastiest gravy base ever! I also cut back on the butter, using only 4 Tbls. I used my oval roaster and simply put the lid on it instead of covering it with foil... the 14 lb. bird I made was done to perfection in 3 hours! Since my turkey was done quicker than I had figured, I didn't get that '45 minute window' to remove the foil to let the turkey brown. I ended up turning on the broiler and returning the bird to the oven, after pouring off the liquid, to add color to the skin.. @8 minutes worked great!

First off, Thank you for this recipe Robin.  I have never made a turkey before and when i read the recipe i thought.. it seems so easy.. and basic.. how can it bee so good?  well i was making my first full turkey dinner with all the fixings including the dressing and giblet gravy.  My turkey was 12.6lbs.. i put it in the oven at 4:30am for timing purposes and the only thing i did different was followed my sister in laws suggestion to bake at 325 for longer, so i did, and for 5 hrs. then took foil off and cooked an additional 30+ min to brown the turkey.  it looked beautiful and i had about 8 cups or so of broth in the pan that i was able to use for my dressing and gravy.  All were delicious and got rave reviews.  talk about feeling proud.  everyone mentioned how moist the turkey was and asked.."how did you get it so moist!?"   all i could say cause i wasn't sure.. haha was that the recipe said that the butter under the skin was suppose to have made it moist.  ha whatever it was it was GREAT! and from my experience i find no reason to find another recipe for baking a turkey or making turkey another way..

Like many other reviewers this was my first turkey ever. It was awesome!!! I buttered under and on top of the skin. Salt and pepper the whole thing. Because I had a 20 pound turkey I used more than was called for of chicken bouillon, minced onion and minced parsley. I put one cut up apple, half an onion, three cloves of garlic and lemon juice in the turkey. I covered with foil and cooked one hour at 375, two and a half hours at 325 and the last hour at 300. I basted twice and left the foil on the entire time. The turkey was moist and brown. We had 12 adults and 7 children. Everyone ate and my family of five has had leftovers the past two days. Wonderful recipe! You should make it!

I love, love, love my turkey this way.  I don't do the buillion, but use 4 cups of chicken broth instead.  The last time I made this, I accidently did 3 tblsp of the onion, parsley, and season salt, but it still turned out great.  I usually  line my roaster with  foil, put all the ingredients on the turkey, wrap it tight, and slow roast on 250  for about 7 to 8 hours (don't even touch it).  Yummy stuff!!!!

I used this recipe last Thanksgiving to roast a turkey in my roaster oven.  I really wanted to save oven space for other things.  I brined the turkey overnight using 2 cups kosher salt dissolved in 2 gallons of water.  I then rinsed and dried it very well and followed the rest of the directions for this recipe.  My 13 pound turkey was done in 2 hours with my roaster oven set to 350 degrees.  It was very moist and flavorful.  My husband (not usually a big roasted turkey fan) really loved it and claimed it was the best he'd eaten. I used a meat thermometer in the thigh and was careful not to overcook the turkey (go for 180 degrees).  What a relief it is to me to have a recipe that really works in a roaster oven!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner 2006. It was very easy and turned out an extremely moist, delicious and flavorful turkey. The pan drippings made an excellent gravy, too. I added a can of chicken broth, half & half and freshly ground black pepper and let it reduce. Then, I added a bit of flour to thicken and whisked it for about 5 minutes. No need to add salt because of the saltiness of the bouillon cube. I got RAVES!

This was absolutely to die for!! This was the first turkey I have ever made & I had to feed 25 people! I got a 22lb turkey, and just doubled everything. Basted it about 4 times in my 6 hrs of cooking. The most juicy, tender turkey I've had! I got SO many praises! Plus the juices made gravy that had incredible flavor! Thank you for making my life easy! I will always make it this way from now on :)

My husband came from a family that loved to cook.  Everything they cook is great.  This was my first Thanksgiving turkey to ever make and I was very nervous because I had a big shoe to fill.  He thought it was the best turkey he has ever eaten in his whole life!  5 stars!  It was delicious.

Delicious!  Moist, juicy, tender...yum.  It did take the entire time in the oven, I think that my husband started it prematurally (it was still a bit frozen, a no-no to me).  Great recipe, thanks Robin!

This turkey turned out delicious! The butter made it juicy, the broth kept it moist, the seasoning was wonderful! Will be using this recipe again.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and made a great gravy when the drippings were thickened with flour and water.  However, my turkey was exactly 12 pounds and was done in 2 hrs 15 minutes, so 4-5 hrs is way too long.  I will definitely be doing turkey this way from now on.

I have used this recipe the last two Thanksgivings and will us it again this year. I usually have a 20 pound bird and adjust the recipe as follows: a whole stick of butter, 3 T seasoning salt, 3 T finely chopped fresh poultry herb blend (thyme, rosemary, and sage) instead of dried parsley, 2 T granulated onion, and 1 T granulated garlic. Instead of water and bouillon, I use a carton of Kitchen Basics salt free stock. I use salt free because the first time I made this my gravy was too salty. It was perfect the second time I made it with the salt-free stock. Also, I use a roasting pan with a rack. I put the giblets, a coarsely chopped onion, several smashed cloves of garlic, and coarsely chopped carrots and celery, whatever is left of the fresh herb packet, and a bay leaf underneath the rack to roast with the turkey. I baste the turkey regularly and add more stock as needed. While the turkey rests, I make a roux from about 3 T of butter and 3 T of flour. I then drain the pan drippings through a colander lined with cheesecloth and discard the giblets, etc. I use a fat separator to remove as much fat as possible and add what is left the roux to make my gravy. I add more stock as needed and season to taste. Perfect!

Don't know what I did wrong but this was done WAY too early (2 hrs in the oven and the meat thermometer was hitting 200 degrees). Maybe the directions for covering the bird with foil assume the cook will be making a tent with both ends open. I covered the entire roasting pan with foil.  When it was (over) done I had a very moist product that was swimming in the water I'd added (as per the recipe to my understanding).   Since there are so many 5 star raves about this I'll conclude the fault lies with myself. I'd appreciate any feedback on what to do the next time. But until then I DO NOT plan on using this recipe again.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey ever last year. As a first-timer, I was very nervous about how it would turn out . It was delicious and juicy! I wish I still lived in the same state with all of my family because they definitely would have been impressed!

This is a wonderful basic recipe to tweak to personal preference.  I also drizzle and rub melted butter and olive oil on the skin and use salt & pepper instead of seasoning salt.  I'm very conscious of skimming all the fat off the drippings before making the gravy.

Sometimes simple is best and this is a perfect example!  My family loves this recipe and it is a must every Thanksgiving.  Moist, tasty, and very easy!  For a nice taste contrast, serve with the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing from this site.

Just wanted to add my review. I made this turkey last year and it was fabulous! After it came out of the oven, we couldn't resist sampling the turkey because it looked and smelled wonderful. However, after dipping our bites of turkey into the AMAZING pan drippings, we found it almost impossible to stop! lol   I will definitely be making this turkey again (with no tweaking) and will not bother to recipe-shop any longer. Happy Cooking!  :)

I've been making this recipe since I first had to make thanksgiving dinner on my own when I lived in Germany almost 10 years ago.  I went with this one becaue of the reviews and becaue I lived in MI when in America.  It's simle and great...I even managed to impress my parents who are both incredible cooks an honestly should have there own show or something or that sort.  The bird comes out moist every time.  A must try for first timers.

Made this the last two years for Thanksgiving, it was fantastic! I cook the turkey upside down in the pan covered in foil, and then remove the foil and cook right side up for the last hour so the skin can crisp up. I cook a 22 pound turkey so I double everything. Perfect!

I have made this dish several times and it is amazing!  The only thing I have changed was that I used 1/2 of a finely diced onion and I used kosher salt and ground pepper instead of seasoned salt.  I've bumped the butter to 8 tbsp, but that's only becuase I was using a 15 lbs bird.

I've made this a couple of times and it came out perfect this time.  Moist on the inside and golden on the outside.  I exchanged the water for half broth and half wine.  Also added some other spices as suggested by others (salt, garlic salt, celery salt, pepper and poultry seasoning)  Oh and rubbed outside with olive oil before salting.

Very savory and moist!  I make this in my 20-quart electric roaster, and it comes out perfect!  I've used this same recipe for Thanksgiving two years in a row.  I just decided to review it now because my 11-year-old son (out of the blue yesterday) asked me to make the same turkey for Thanksgiving again this year (it's only January, mind you, but he must have been having some fond memories of eating that turkey at Thanksgiving!).

Good little recipe on the fly....I didn't have parsley so I threw in a bunch of other stuff instead (rosemary, thyme, basil, sage, garlic, bay, etc) it was nice and juicy and the juices made a WONDERFUL gravy!

I love making this turkey because it is so incredibly easy! I have made it for big groups on more than one occasion and it has gone over very well! One guy even said it was better than his mothers...OPE! ;) 

The recipe is lovely just the way it is but I do make a few personal preference changes.

Instead of just butter pads under the skin, I mix loads of fresh minced garlic and mush it with butter then slather it everywhere under the skin. Any leftovers get rubbed on the outside.

I would like to try it with all chicken broth but so far I have only done half broth and half bouillon.

I also use fresh minced parsley and onions vrs. the dried, this requires you to add a bit more.

I like to use half seasoning salt and half Mrs. Dash seasoning.

Last but not least, I stuff the cavity and all around the bird with fresh largely cut onions and garlic. (Next time I am going to add celery, carrot and apple as another viewer suggests)

Throw it all in a turkey bag and YUM!!

After Thanksgiving got a 23lb turkey on a great sale. I'm 26 and it was my first time ever making a turkey! This turkey turned out better than my Momma's! The difference between this recipe and Momma's is inserting the butter between the skin and turkey breast for that extra juicy, tender white meat. You could eat it without a knife. This is my go-to recipe for turkey from now on.

As a first time turkey maker I would like to share my mistakes for other first timers though. My bird was nearly twice the size of the recipe's. So I doubled all the ingredients. This can be problematic when doubling the amount of water used if using an aluminum roasting pan just the size for the bird. While there is plenty of room for the water at first, as the turkey bakes it loses some juices, causing the liquid in the pan to rise and spill over the top of the roasting pan brim. This means you will have to bake the turkey longer than the recommended time, due to having to open the oven to clean and remove liquid as you go. Otherwise, an easy, simple and delicious recipe!

THIS  TURKEY ROCKS!!! Normally I do not like turkey, it's bland and dry but.. even I enjoy it prepared this way. The only thing I changed was to lay several stalks of celery, a medium onion cut in very large dice and a handful of baby carrots on the bottom of the roasting bag* and into the cavity before I baked it.. the gravy made from the drippings was awesome! Thank you :) * I always use roasting bags to save time on clean up.

I was incredibly please with how this turned out.  I cooked two birds yesterday using this recipe and they turned out perfectly.  However, don't use the 180 degree methodology, 165 is fine and is what's recommended by the USDA.  All the meat is white and cooked through and is really, really moist.  Just fantastic and easy recipe.

Absolutely divine.
This was my first time cooking a turkey, and I was VERY nervous, but I used this recipe, based on the awesome reviews and it turned out GREAT.

I had to make a couple tweaks, based on what I had available, but I think that this recipe would be even better the original way.
I had to use beef boullion instead of chicken, which I was worried about, but it wasn't a big deal.
Also, make sure you use a sturdy roasting pan for this, since the liquid makes the turkey very heavy and hard to carry!! 

This was the most moist and delicious turkey I've ever had, with perfectly crispy skin. YUM.

Really worth the 5 stars! I tried another turkey recipe from this website last year that involved a lot of hoopla (putting onions inside, pouring champagne over the bird, doing all kinds of complicated stuff - and it turned out disappointing) so my boyfriend and I were SO HAPPY when we tried this and it turned out DELICIOUS. First off, let me say that I absolutely HATE a dry bird. In fact, I set the timer on the oven to 3 hrs (instead of 3.5-4hr) and checked the bird at 2hrs 40minutes and found that it was ready to come out. The flavor was excellent, the bird was completely moist... this is the bird you want to make for thanksgiving to wow your relatives. Even though we were both stuffed, we were still picking pieces off while putting it away. The only thing I will do different next time is instead of pouring the juices down the drain, pour some of them over the meat after we've carved it up for even extra flavor and moisture or to make a gravy. YUM.

Absolutely the best recipe I have found to make a Thanksgiving turkey. Make sure that the turkey rests on a rack and not on the bottom of the roaster pan, otherwise the turkey meat will fall apart and off the bones when removing the bird from the pan!

Fantastic. I chose this recipe to guide me through making my very first turkey and it came out amazing. I used a 19 pounder, but kept all the amounts the same, except using more butter to distribute throughout the skin. Added garlic and onion powders to the liquid (used broth instead of water & bouillon) and stuffed the cavity with a quartered onion. Great flavor, moist meat. YUM! Thanks!

I cannot rate this recipe high enough!!  This is quite literally the best turkey recipe I have ever used.  It is my fail safe.  I have been using this recipe since I think 1999 when I did my first Thanksgiving as an adult.  I've used it every year and the turky comes out perfect every single time.  Everyone raves about my turkey!  If you're unsure which recipe to use, USE THIS ONE!!  You will not be disappointed!

VERY yummy and moist! Even my husband who hates white meat (says it is too dry) ate some and said it was delicious. The cooking time is definitely off though as my 12 pound bird was done in about 2 1/2-3 hours. I let it sit on warm for a little longer and kept drizzling the brother over it. My one complaint is that there was SO much broth that it made the stuffing soggy inside the turkey (the turkey was completely falling apart on the bottom because it was so juicy) and we ended up throwing the stuffing away. I will put it on a bed of veggies next time as others have suggested. My one change is that I added red peppers on, in, and around the turkey. I love the taste and it turned out wonderful. Great turkey recipe--will make again!

added teaspoon of black pepper and 2 cloves of garlic to liquid mixture.  ALso if you aren't putting stuffing into the cavities, put in some fresh peeled fruit instead to keep the turkey from drying out from the inside.

This was my very first attempt at making the holiday bird and it turned out pretty fabulous.  Instead of mixing all of the ingredients and popping it in the oven, I chose to brine it in a bag for about 12 hours prior to cooking it.  I opted to use real onion instead of dried onion and also chopped fresh celery and minced garlic in the bag as well.  When it was time to put the turkey in the oven, I just dumped the contents of the bag in the pan with the bird, injected the butter/parsley, and cooked it according to the directions.  WORKED LIKE A CHARM! I will make this again.

AMAZING!!! This is the best turkey recipe that I have ever found.  It is amazing as is, just make sure to be very liberal with the butter.  I also cover my turkey with foil for about an hour after I take it out of the oven.  This really helps to keep the turkey moist.

I made this turkey a few years ago after I first got married. I was having my husband's family over for Thanksgiving. As a vegetarian, I hadn't had turkey forever and didn't have any recipes for it, so I just picked a recipe with a lot of good reviews. OH. MY. GOODNESS. All I heard all day long was how wonderful the turkey was and how it was the best they'd ever had. Made it for my family not long after that and the same thing. I was skimming through the reviews a little while ago and was stunned to come across a bad review. All I can think is they must have done something wrong because every time I've made this, people flip out over it- and I come from a family of phenomenal cooks. I was also able to make a perfectly wonderful gravy from the drippings- there were plenty. though my husband said it was a bit salty. I solved that problem by not adding any extra salt as I seasoned it and letting the seasoned salt and bouillon in the drippings do the work.  Throw away your other recipes, this one's the way to go. :)

Fool proof and excellent!  I was so excited since this was my first time making a turkey.  I will only make it this way from now on.  I stuffed mine with 2 onions for flavor.  YUM!  Only thing is that I would take it out of the oven when the Turkey reaches 175 and let it sit for a half hour since it still cooks once you take it out.

This was my first turkey ever and it came out so great, I never really liked turkey when I was younger it was always dry but this recipe made the moistest turkey I have ever tasted, and it looked so beautiful I didn't want to let them carve it!! (See Picture) I got so many compliments on my turkey and I will definately use this recipe everytime I make a turkey! I did change the Recipe a little I put Cellery Carrots and Onions as a bed underneath and Half on onion and some Garlic inside instead of stuffing, I also covered the whole bird in butter and basted about every hour, But it came out great, Thanx For such a good recipe

Outstanding!  I brine soaked the bird for 24 hours then roasted it with this recipe.  The only problem was carving, the bones kept pulling out of the meat!  Very tender and juicy with a very nice flavor.  Almost too simple to make this nice a bird.  Thanks

Used this recipe again at Easter; another delicious bird. Almost a foolproof recipe and I sure appreciate that on a busy holiday afternoon.

This was my first try at making a turkey (or chicken for that matter). I added a quartered lemon, orange, onion, celery and carrot in the cavity.  It was excellent.  I started roasting it too late to eat for dinner so my husband and I were going to carve it up and freeze  it for quick dinners in the future.  We ended up eating a lot of it standing around the roasting pan at 10pm in the evening.  I saved the juices and made soup the next day.  Excellent recipe!!!

We made this as our first turkey for Thanksgiving. It was absolutely delicious - it couldn't have turned out any better. Followed the recipe exactly. The only thing we did differently was to stuff a whole onion inside the bird. Thanks!

Being a vegetarian I had never made a turkey before, this year I hosted my first Thanksgiving and of course wanted a turkey for my meat-eating family so I made this one (my husband cleaned it and pulled out the giblit bag --too yucky for me).  Everyone loved this turkey, it was so moist it was falling off the bone.  My only complaint about it is that it is so moist it is hard to remove from the roasting pan/rack, so for looks it didn't really make it to the table, but it was sliced up for the buffet and everyone loved it.  I made it in our  18 qt roaster oven and did not cover it with foil.  A complete success (except for presentation) and I'll probably use this recipe should I make a turkey again.

All out the be best-tasting turkey I've ever made. I've used this recipe two years in a row and both times the turkey was moist and delicious.

HOWEVER... the breast comes out so tender and moist it just falls apart. You don't get those hearty, meaty slices... just kind of crumbly bits. The dark meat comes out superbly.

Also, I want to agree with others. Putting the turkey in for the 4 to 5 hours specified in the recipe would incinterate it. Mine was done in 1 1/2 hours and was kept at perfect temperature (according to two different oven thermometers).

This was a great recipe but instead of using 4 cups of water I used 2 cups of wine and 2 cups of water. It was my first time making a Thanksgiving Turkey and it was fantastic. I had a 10lb bird and I would recommend using less liquid though for the smaller ones.

This is a good recipe, however, I would recommend cutting down the cooking time for the turkey by at least one hour.  Five hours was too long for the size of turkey indicated.

I made turkey for the first time in my life (had never baked much before) and it turned out fantastic! I used a 5.5 pound turkey breast and cooked it covered for 1 hour and uncovered for the rest till the temperature reached 185 degrees (about 1 1/2 hours), basting often. My husband said it was the best turkey he had ever eaten. Most of all, I got my children's seal of approval - they asked for seconds and thirds! Thank you for this wonderful thanksgiving experience.

I am getting ready to make this one the third time this year. After I made it two years ago for the first time, I stopped searching for another recipe; this is the keeper. I use canned chicken broth instead of water and add some garlic powder. Pretty perfect, juice and flavorful, even the breast meat is moist. Simply the best I have tried. It is so good that I my mother-in-law asked me to prepare a turkey for the dinner this year! That should tell you enough.

good, but the directions should state "bake until meat thermometer registers 180° F in the thigh; 170° F in the breast." some people complained about the time it took to cook there turkey, note that the amount of time would differ depending on what size bird you use that’s why the temperatures give you the best idea when the turkey is cooked.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  And I really don't care for turkey.  This past Thanksgiving was my first ever cooking the turkey (or even hosting for that matter).  This was, by far, the best turkey I've ever had and I was thrilled with how it turned out!  It even made great leftovers and I don't care for leftovers even more than I don't care for turkey!

My mom has been making Turkey this way ever since I can remember. She also will mix in garlic powder,basil,oregano into the softend butter adds even more flavor. Also, try sprinkling poultry rub on top before baking. YUMMY!!!

As we all know, there are sooooooo many ways to make a turkey and truthfully, I really liked this as a good base. Changed it a bit by softening the butter and mixing in onion, garlic powder, parsley and sage and then rubbing it under the skin. Outside the skin was topped with more seasonings and flipped upside down to ensure a moist turkey. I used chicken stock mixed with a good beer to baste. YUMMO Robin and thanks so much for a great start!!

This is by far the best turkey I have ever cooked.  I have always had trouble getting enough flavor and seasoning throughout the meat.  Not with this recipe.  This is how I will cook my turkey from now on.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is SOOOO good!!  Meat did literally fall off the bone.  I didn't end up basting at all because the first time I pulled off the foil to do so, a bunch of steam escaped so I didn't think basting was necessary.  As everyone else has been saying - this makes awesome, flavorful gravy (although quite salty - so I will try some low-sodium ingredients next time).  I used the leftover juices (5 cups worth!!) with an Allrecipes gravy recipe (Easy Turkey Gravy by JMOR777).  My boyfriend said this was the best turkey he's ever had - and I think I have to agree  :) UPDATE:  Made this again for Thanksgiving and my dad got to try it this year.  HE was even saying it's the best turkey he's ever had!  He kept talking about how perfectly it was cooked.  (And shoot...I'm only 25 yrs old...if I've perfected my Thanksgiving turkey at 25, I'm pretty sure I'm unstoppable :-P)  I did not baste again this year, and I used low-sodium chicken broth.  The gravy it made was perfect!  Thanks again for this unbeatable recipe.

I had never made a Turkey in my life due to a poultry allergy in my home. However, I made one last year for my husband's side of the family. I use allrecipes.com for almost every recipe I cook, so of course, I looked up my Turkey recipe through them also. I am 32 years old and for never making a turkey in my life, I have to say, this was by far, one of the best turkey's I had ever eaten. We did not even have to carve it, it just fell apart. Even the white meat, which I feel is usually dry on most turkeys that I have eaten, was super juicy.I have given this recipe to many people in the last year and will continue to do so. This year my mom is going to cook the turkey,and of course,I emailed her this recipe to follow. Do not pass this recipe up without making it at least once!!!! For any special occasion.I swear by it!!

I have used this recipe many times now with success each time.  Use fresh herbs if you have access to them and mix some of the herbs in the butter to directly flavor the breast meat. Baste with pan juices every 30 minutes to ensure you have wonderfully moist breast meat everytime.  I have used this on roasted chicken several times too.

I've never had such a moist, tender turkey.  When my husband began carving, the meat literally fell off the bone.  The only problem I had was in the presentation - and my own fault - since I forgot to spray the foil with cooking spray, so the skin from the breast came off and stuck to the foil.  Made a note for myself for next time!

Easy and extremely good.  I've made turkey this way twice, and each time received RAVE RAVE RAVE reviews.  I was told by several that it was the best turkey they've ever had!  I cook mine in a Reynolds bag and baste every hour.  Our 22 pound bird was done in under 4 hours and the meat literally falls of the bone!  So moist, so tender and so very, very delicious.  Makes a wonderful gravy.  Can't recommend enough....I'll never make turkey any other way!

This was my first Turkey that I have ever made for my husband and I. It was fantastic. Very moist. The only recommendation I have is to tie up those wings and legs so they don't stick to the pan and burn. Any first time cook will love this recipe.

It is great ! It is my first time and they loved it .. They were shocked that i could make such a tasty juicy Turkey  .. I added rosemary to the butter i put under the skin  i added 1 tbsp garlic powder to the mix .. I added 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger to the mixture ..put some carrots and celery  and one onion inside the turkey .. Yumyummm.. I made a great sauce from it by adding 4 tbsp flour to 1 tbsp butter after turning light brown added the turkey broth and mixed wile cooking i added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of black pepper to it .. It became out of this world ;))) enjoyyy

Best turkey I ever had but I changed a few things.  For starters I brined the turkey overnight in salt, pepper, brown sugar, rosemary and thyme.  I didn't used the parsley.  for the butter I softened a whole stick and mixed in salt, pepper, fresh chopped garlic, dry minced onions and oregano. I rubbed it on and under the skin.  Instead of the water and bouillon I used 2 cans of chicken broth and mixed in a tbls of better than bouillon turkey base.  I sprinkled the seasoning salt over but found I wasn't fond of that.  Next time I'll leave it out.  I cooked it in an oven bag using a remote digital thermometer.  When the temp reached 145 I cut open the top of the bag cooking it at 400 till it reached 180 to get it nice and brown.  The turkey came out beautifly with about 5-6 cups of juices of which I only used 3 cups to make gravy and have been using the juices in other dishes such as rice, potatoes, pastas, etc.  It made a fabulous gravy.  I know it's not the same recipe but it came out so great I had to share what I did.  I'll never make turkey any other way again except leave out the minced onion.  I don't think it added anything.  I'm making a 5# chicken tonight this way to see how it turns out.  It's brining in the fridge right now calling out to me, lol.

Loved this turkey! Mostly I loved how simple the recipe was and how quickly it cooked! The drippings turned out great and made fantastic gravy. I did add some chopped onion and an apple in the cavities for flavour

My mother usually makes the roast turkeys for special dinners, but I offered to try my hand at it this time.  She is a VERY good cook, and her turkey is always delicious.  But this recipe was amazing and came out much more juicy and moist and flavorful than her turkeys have in the past.  I didn't change anything in the recipe, it was perfect as is.

A-. Good receipe. Although I didn't add the parsley and onions- didn't want to take away from the natural turkey flavour. Moreso appreciated the tips on placing the foil on for most of the time and taking it off for the last 45 mins- I actually took mine off for the last hour. Turned out yumnmy. Used this recipe with a ButterBall Turkey. Used about 1/2 cup fo butter and smoothed over surface of turkey. Didn't need to put under skin since it's a butterball. Turned out moist as heck. Thanks!

Great recipe for a novice turkey chef like myself!  I was a bit intimidated by this big ol bird..but this recipe made it easy! Used less butter than called for and it still turned out great.  Plenty of leftovers for  soup and tacos!  thanx!

I used this for our Thanksgiving turkey and it came out more perfect than perfect should be! The turkey was super moist, flavorful, and completely the best turkey I have ever tasted. I will making a turkey breast tomorrow for Super Bowl/Pre-Birthday dinner and plan on using this recipe to make my turkey. In fact, this is the only way I plan on every making turkey again.

Very good, but like others mine was done in a little over 3 hours and the drippings were really salty. I will make again but cut down on the seasoning salt.

Followed some of the reviews.......used only 1T seasoning salt, and added some garlic to the chicken broth.  Oh, and tucked the butter between the skin and breast, then "lotioned" the outside with some too!  PERFECTION!! Thank you!

Just a note.. To separate the skin from the breast lift up the skin that covers the neck area and reach under the skin with your hand and work your hand in between the skin and the breast meat and that creates your pockets for the butter. No need to cut the skin.

Amazing flavor! I made the basting stuff and put it in a zip lock bag and froze to make a butter log and then sliced it into medallions. Then to make sure the meat was flavored I put the medallions under the turkey skin. Be sure to not only make pockets but to separate the skin a bit more so that the flavor doesnt just soak in one spot. You want it to spread to make a even an beautifully flavored turkey. Then, I had used some of the basting sauce i had saved to bast the turkey on top and then also a few times while baking. I had family and friends over, and everyone kept raving about how flavorful and juicy the turkey was! Wonderful! Thank you!  :)

This recipe was good except for 1 problem was the cooking time. It still had another hour to go on the timer when we kept smelling turkey and I thought I had better just take a peek. It's a good thing I did, as it was already well done and would have been burned had I just waited on the timer. The meat did turn out very tender and moist so it worked out okay after all. It was so tender in fact, that it literally fell apart when I tried to remove it from the roasting pan. I used a 13 lb. turkey, unstuffed. I'm still new at fixing the holiday meals as mom or grandma always did it and I was only delegated to bring a side dish, so maybe if I had stuffed it the timing would have been right. Anyway, it was very tasty and I will use this recipe again with the timing adjusted. Thanks!

This is the best turkey I have ever made!! Very moist and flavorful. I did add the butter to the legs as well and also used 1/2 the amount of seasoning salt. As it was it was borderline "salty" but AWESOME.
I don't dread Thanksgiving any more.

Good but didn't stand out.  Unfortunately the skin on the breasts of my turkey was missing so I couldn't put the butter under there.  Will try this again next time but I think I'll cook the turkey upside down so the breast meat is in the broth...

Very easy to make, turns out well. It looks beautiful, too! We didn't need to do the browning, it browned on its own- maybe because of the boullion?

I did a 24 pounder and it was delicious! I only used 2 1/2 cups of broth (lots of drippings with such a large turkey). I also put the turkey on a bed of carrots, celery, and onion. This was my first turkey and I will be preparing my Christmas turkey the same way. Thanks for the superb recipe!

This was positively delicious! I sprayed the foil with Pam before putting it on the turkey to keep it from sticking - it worked beautifully! And I basted the bird every 45 minutes with chicken broth. Took the foil off for the last 45 minutes and it browned beautifully. I put slices of butter under the skin on the breast and the drumsticks so everything was tender and juicy. My family LOVED this - my brother in law said it was absolutely delicious and didn't even want any gravy on it! Thanks!!!

I don't eat turkey...but last Thanksgiving, my mother-in-law from Michigan decided to spend Thanksgiving with us at our home, for the first time.  This recipe saved me.  It turned out great because my mother-in-law, my husband, and my son loved it!

For my first time making a turkey, this was really a great way to go!  I think that a more experienced cook might decide to add a few more herbs/spices -- but my whole family applauded the recipe as is.

I made this recipe for Xmas 2000 with a 20 pound fresh turkey.  The recipe itself was very easy, but I had only 2 concerns:  1.  The turkey, at 20 pounds, took a LOT longer than the adjusted recipe said it would.  You'll need to count on about 8 to 8 1/2 hours before it's fully done, especially around the leg joints (an odd place for it NOT to be done, IMHO).  2.  Basting this bird helps to keep it juicy.  I basted every hour on the hour and it turned out a LOT more tender in the places that I managed to baste.  There are more than enough juices on the bottom to satisfy. This is an excellent first-timer recipe, and I've been won over to this method of making it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time I've made a turkey that my son actually asked for more.  This was such a simple recipe, and so tasty!  The meat was falling off the bones.  Definitely a hit!

I used this recipe to make my first turkey ever!  It was very simple and tasted more delicious then the turkeys my mother has been roasting for 30 years.  Don't tell her that though.

I use recipe's as a guideline. I had a 22# gobbler. I used a cooking bag and took other ppl's suggestions. I prepped the turkey and then "stuffed" it with 2mid sized onions, an apple and some celery. I put my own seasoned butter under the skin/and some in the cavity as best I could then put some cut up celery and carrots in the bottom of a cooking bag. (I also sprayed a little cooking spray in the bag and put about 2tblspns flour in the bag and coated it as best I could. Then I put the turkey in and added about 1/2 carton of chicken stock. Cooked it for about 4ish hours and viola awesome turkey!!! Seriously I had about at least 6cups of gravy and the turkey was amazeballs. It literally fell off the bone. It was so moist and delicious.  I could not give this "guideline" a higher recommendation. Thanks for taking the time to read my take on this recipe and please be kind to one another. Have a great day!!!!

10 years ago when I was spending my first holiday season away from family, I discovered this recipe and decided to try it for Thanksgiving.  It was SO MUCH BETTER than my family's traditional turkey recipe that we've never gone back.  Since then we've had a number of holiday guests who have made it their own as well.  I do use more butter and seasoning than the recipe calls for, but it's an excellent basic turkey recipe that you can adapt based on your taste & turkey size.

Love this recipe. I have made it a few times already and just put one in the oven for tomorrow's family party. To lower my stress level, I always cook the turkey the day before the event. And then I can carve it and reheat it the next day! Always get compliments on how moist the meat is. I think I will be in charge of the turkey from now on.

I've tried many different ways to fix turkey over the years, but found this to be the best.  It's simple, quick, and comes out very moist and flavorful every time.  You can't go wrong.  I don't vary the recipe at all, but have left out seasoning when I didn't have it and it still turned out great.

My 1st ever turkey....and it turned out great. Since it is my 1st bird, I do wonder what difference the broth stock makes...besides leaving me with no actual drippings to work with for gravy.... I'll keep this in my back pocket whilst looking around for others.

I can make a killer prime rib, an amazing ham, but for some reason hadn't quite learned how to master a perfect turkey. I had tried a ton of recipes including the "fool proof" Alton Brown recipe (where you brine it in a cooler the day before - talk about a pain in the rear!)
I had almost given up when my Dad was given a Turkey for Christmas so we decided to give it one last shot with this recipe, and I am glad we did! FINALLY a turkey turned out moist and delicious! I hate basting a turkey, and this was a god-send recipe in that regard. I actually had time to enjoy with my family in the living room instead of slaving over the oven every 15 minutes. The only change I might make is to customize the flavoring to our liking a bit better. I'd cut back on the dried onion flavor, and change to more of a rosemary/lemon blend next time. I'm excited for the ability to add this to my "big guns" recipe arsenal!

This was one of the best turkeys I have ever had.  It was my first time cooking a turkey.  I omitted the minced onion only because I did not have any and didn't really want to run back out to the store in all of the holiday grocery store traffic.  I also injected the turkey with a butter marinade I found at the local grocery store.  I did it the night before.  When baking the turkey I used an oven bag and also covered with foil.  After 4 hours it was done.  It actually had started to fall from the bones.  It was really moist and seasoned.  I will be making this again for Christmas.  Thanks

We made this as written and stuffed it with onions, carrots, and celery.  It was the most delicious turkey we've had so far.  4 cups of water sounds like a lot and looks like a lot, but it left ample juices for an abundance of gravy, my husband's favorite part.

This was my husbands  & I 1st turkey we made by ourselves & we have been together since 2005 & we love this recipe. We had to cook our turkey early this year because we r startin a new tradition, Thanksgiving in the woods camping. So we can really give thanks 2 our right 2 hunt, fish & camp which r all things we love 2 do as a family all 4 of us my husband, son, daughter, and myself. When I read all the reviews I modified the recipe some. Well ours was a 21 lb turkey & we cooked ours for 4 hrs with the foil on & the last hr took the foil off @ 350 degrees the whole time. We also doubled the recipe except the chicken broth instead of water, only 4 cups, & thankfully we did because several times we had 2 take drippings out.  Then we had 2 use beef bouillon cubes since I was out of chicken bouillon cubes, we used 6 cubes instead of trying 2 measure that out. We added the parsley & minced onion as calls for. With the seasoning salt we had but my husband really loves Everglades Seasonings & he wanted 2 put that in instead of the seasoning salt, so we did. Then I also added a tbsp of granulated garlic, & 2 tbsp of black pepper. Then we put an onion in the middle of the bird 4 extra flavorings. So we buttered the bird under the skin & when I was doing that we took the baster & took some of the mixture & put it under the skin as well. We will recommend this recipe 2 anyone. . This is a 5 star recipe I just wish I could add more stars. We r also talking about usin this on chicken also

I am by far NOT a COOK, lucky for me I found this recipe. My husband and our three children LOVED this turkey and for the first time not only did they ask for seconds but they also asked for turkey sandwiches for lunch. Thank you so much for the amazing recipe.

This Turkey is absolutely amazing!  I made it recently on a whim for my very first turkey.  SO delicious and juicy!  I could barely stop eating it.

Highly recommend!

*I was out of onion powder so I used finely chopped onion.  Worked out fine!

I hosted Christmas dinner at my house this past year and decided to try this recipe and it was fabulous. My dad was so impressed at how juicy and flavorful the bird was. My sister was hosting dinner for her in-laws the next day and I sent her home with the recipe. The recipe is simple and perfect the way it is, I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and I think that this was the best Thanksgiving turkey I've ever had. It was flavorful, tasty, and most importantly, JUICY - even the white meat, which usually is on the dry side. I won't bother with other turkey recipes at future Thanksgivings - this one's the winner for me.

OMG!!  I used this recipe for my Thanksgiving turkey and it was the absolute best turkey I have EVER cooked!!!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I decreased the seasoning salt to 1 tablespoon instead of 2.  I used a 12 pound turkey and I not only put lots of butter between the skin and the breast meat but I also slathered butter all over the outside of the turkey.  My family absolutely loved it and they are not usually big turkey fans.  It was the most flavorful, moist turkey I have ever eaten.  I was so proud!!  Thank you Robin C. for such a wonderful recipe!!

1st Thanksgiving turkey for 18 people.  In-Laws all said it was the best turkey they had ever had in their lives!!!  The only thing I did after reading another artcle, is.... turning the turkey on its breast for all but the last hour of cooking. This made the juices run INTO the turkey. Then flipped breast up and uncovered for the last hour.  SO JUICY!!!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!!!!

Made this for my first Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!!!!! My fiancee said that it was the best turkey he has ever had and everyone commented on how every bite was juicy. I used the best brine recipe from AR and brined the turkey overnight but other then that followed these directions exactly! Impressive and easy, a must for the holidays and any other time you need to impress guests w/out too much effort.

I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of decreasing the seasoning salt to 1 tbsp.  It was definitely the tastiest, juiciest and moistest turkey I have ever made!  My kids who don't normally like turkey loved it and even my picky bf said it was great!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe Robin C.!

Wonderful!  The drippings made excellent gravy as well.  I melted a 1/2 stick of butter in a skillet, whisked in 1/4 cup flour, gently poured two cups of dripping into the skillet while stirring.  Cooked until thickened and bubbly then cooked 1 minute more.  Yum!

What an easy way to roast the perfect turkey!  Everyone complimented the juiciness and flavor of the meat and asked how I'd done it.  This is the only way I'll make turkey from now on.  The only thing I changed was to first mix a savory herb mix into the butter before spreading it under the skin.  My 17 pound bird roasted for 3.5 hours and even though I only uncovered it for the last half hour, it was a beautiful golden brown.  Next year will be my first year hosting Thanksgiving for the whole family, and I won't even stress over the turkey since I know this recipe will give perfect results!  Thanks!

My recipe is similar, & I always stuff my turkey, I use enough plain water in the bottom of the roaster to cover, it turns out nice & moist. I simmer the giblets with an onion, carrot  celery, S & P & 2 cups of water to make a stock, (sometimes use an envelope to enhance the flavor), which I use for the gravy & to baste the turkey as it roasts,  I vary my stuffing from year to year, but always simmer chopped celery & onion in a about 1 cup of water to mellow, before adding it  to the stuffing mixture. .

I overcooked the heck out of this recipe, but it was still edible. :) No complaints, and everyone is coming back this year so I figure this recipe must be pretty good.

we have about 4 turkey's a year, and i use this recipe every time. the last 3 thanksgivings we've had the family over here, and this has always come out falling off the bone tender and delicious. that's all there is to it, this is how to properly cook a turkey if you want a great turkey from your oven.

Decided it was time to use the frozen turkey!  This was absolutely delicious!  The only changes were adding 1 tsp. garlic powder with the liquid, and I didn't have bouillion granules so I used the cubes.  (I found out 1 cube equals 1 tsp, so it takes 9 cubes.)  I microwaved the liquid/cubes until dissolved in a 1 qt. glass measuring cup.  This was falling off the bone tender!   My husband and I were filling up as I was slicing it since we couldn't stop eating it!  Not at all dry!  Made wonderful gravy, too!

This was my first time ever cooking a turkey, and I had company coming over...not usually a good combination, as I had no back up plan if this bird failed.  However, this recipe was fantastic!  I followed the directions exactly and the turkey was moist, flavourful and looked amazing!  My guests were impressed, and loved the homemade gravy made from the drippings.  I would highly recommend this recipe to any newbie and can't wait to make it again this Christmas.

Not impressed, sorry.  This was not better or even as good as some of the turkey's I've made on the grill or in the oven in the past.

I used a 17 lb turkey, stuffed as usual.  This recipe called for a few extra steps as my usual routine is just to stuff and rub oil on the outside of the bird, salt and pepper it and that's it. 

I've had just as good and better turkey...and I've made LOTS of turkeys.

Besides being unimpressed, I also didn't like that I didn't have nice drippings to make gravy out of. Luckily I had my husband run out and buy canned gravy (eeesh) but better than nothing.

I had an inch of salty, buttery broth instead of drippings...what on earth was I supposed to do with that?  

I was very disappointed, after reading so many reviews, I thought that this was something really special. I didn't think so at all.

It was good turkey, just nothing special at all for the extra steps...and no drippings!

Wow, I didn't know that a turkey could be this easy and still taste so delicious and moist! I added two chopped onions, celery and carrots both inside the turkey and surrounding it in the pan. I also sprinkled sage all over the turkey with the seasoned salt. The only warning I have is that you might want to either reduce the amount of bouillon used or the seasoned salt because this makes Very salty gravy with so much sodium in the broth that cooks out

We always go to my husband's family for Thanksgiving dinner since my family is out of state. They are not the type that does a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. I always cook my own turkey the Friday after for my husband and myself and have never gone wrong with this recipe in the 4 years I have been using it. We then use the leftover turkey to make Kentucky Hot Browns which is another tradition for us. It is still moist even when used for leftover recipes. Look at the original recipe which is listed as "Original Hot Brown" recipe.

In a panic, I tried to research an easy and tasty recipe (as I can't cook and never really had) Thankfully I came across this recipe, which earned me rave reviews and now I will use it again this Thanksgiving. It was so easy to follow and tasted great! I strongly recommend this recipe!

this recipe was awesome.  made it for t-giving - everyone loved it.  very juicy.  i recommend cutting the water in half or maybe less unless you want to keep pouring off your juices....2 cups is plenty.

I've always used a Martha Stewart recipe well we are moving and I packed all of my cookbooks so it was unavailable. This recipe was simple, tasty and juicy! We will be using this recipe for turkey at future Thanksgiving dinners!

I made this last year and I made 2 this year. For a person that does not care for turkey at all, I ate an awful lot of it. It could not have been more moist and juicy. It also had a great flavor. I will continue to use this recipe.

First time using this recipe. Only one change, used chicken broth instead of water. The turkey was juicy, tender and had a great flavor.    If I don't stop picking at it each time I open the fridge, there will not be enough left to make soup.

Wow, was this good! I put garlic and minced onions in the butter, then let that sit for a couple hours before I added to turkey. Then let turkey sit with that in fridge for couple hours. I used broth instead of water. My stupid thermometer didn't work, so my 14lb turkey baked for 5 hours, but my turkey was still so juicy and flavorful. If I would have cooked like I normally do, my turkey would have been dry as the desert. Thanks for such a great idea!

This was my first turkey ever. I've been told the turkey bag method is pretty good.. so I made this entire recipe inside a turkey bag and it came out great! I also put the remainder of the onion inside the turkey and when it was done.. the broth was AMAZING! Everyone enjoyed it, I would make this turkey again!

Everyone loved my turkey! I couldn't stop hearing so much praise! It was fabulous!!!! I will always use this receipe from now on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I did make it in a bag, and it was moist! My husband was worried about the stuffing getting to mushy with the water and turkey in a bag! But it wasn't! It was all GREAT!!!! Moist and melted in my mouth. Usually my turkey was dry!!!

I made this recipe for a small Thanksgiving celebration using a 5 lb. turkey breast instead of a whole turkey. Also, I used fresh parsley instead of dried and cooked it for 2 hours and 15 minutes. I could not believe how moist and flavorful it came out! This is now my go-to recipe for turkey.

Discovered this recipe last year and have made it several times; always get raves. Wouldn't change a thing, it's always moist and flavorful. This recipe is so popular with family and friends, I cook this in the summer in the garage or out on the deck in the electric roaster

This was REALLY good.I was a little scared to stray from making a "traditonal" turkey & was sceptical about using minced onion & seasoning salt,I thought it would be a little overpowering but it was just great!!The gravy turned out awesome too & it made lots with all the water/boullion that was added.I will deffinately make it this way again!!Very delicious & subtle!!YUM YUM.

I'm sold!  This is a great way to do turkey.  We cook it in a bag and it cooks super fast.  The broth mixture makes the meat so tender and moist!  And it makes excellent gravy too.

I am so glad I tried this recipe.  The turkey smelled wonderful from the first hour I started cooking it.  It came out moist and delicious and the broth made for the most wonderful gravy! This will be my regular recipe from now on.

This was my first turkey and wow. Everyone said it was the best they had ever had. I rubbed some olive oil and lemon juice over the skin, made it extra good. I also put a cut up orange and lemon inside. Also, I would not suggest making gravy with the pan drippings. The minced onion made it way to strong.

I used two cans of low-sodium chicken broth and fresh parsley.  I used Mortons Nature's Seasons seasoning salt (has celery seed in it)- and just sprinkled until the entire turkey was covered.  We will use this next year!!!  This was the first time we got our turkey right from the local butcher - and this recipe did the trick - Thanks!!!!!

I have been making turkey for 30 years and always have trouble getting enough gravy from the drippings.  This provided lots of flavourful gravy. I made a few changes.  I used Campbell's low salt chicken stock instead of the boullion and water.  I used very little parsley and onion powder (perhaps 1 teaspoon each) and I just lightly sprinkled the turkey with seasoned salt.(nowhere near 2 tablespoons)  The gravy was salty enough with those additions.  I will definitely use this recipe for holiday turkeys from now on.

This recipe helped me through my first Thanksgiving as the cook; the bird was great!  I did a couple of things differently though.  First off, I lowered the oven temp to 325 rather than 350, since the other reviews warned against cooking it so long.  I also tucked a couple of fresh sage leaves under the breast skin along with the butter, which made for a lovely holiday bird.

Excellent recipe.  I made my first turkey using this and it was very juicy and tasty.  I will omit the seasoning salt next time around as I found it a bit too salty.

This was great!  It took a whole lot faster than 3-4 hours...I only had a 10lbs turkey and it took about 2 hrs.  It was really fast and it smells soo delicious.  VERY VERY moist!!!  Everyone loved it! Even my non-turkey-loving husband ^_^!

Yes, Yes! This recipe made the best and most flavorful turkey I have ever eaten. I added a bay leaf to the broth also. I recommend not cooking it for 4 to 5 hours like it said in the recipe, mine took a little over two hours. Thanks very much for this recipe and I now know how I will make my thanksgiving turkey every year!

This is by far my favorite turkey recipe! It was my first time making one all by myself and it couldn't have been easier. The only changes I made were I combined all the spices together and added 1 1/2 Tbsp of garlic & herb seasoning. I also cooked it for 3 hrs and 15 minutes covered, then removed foil for an additional 10 minutes. It was juicy and had robust flavor in every bite

Best. Turkey. Ever. This is what I've done the past several years: I use the brine technique described in another recipe on this site called "Perfect Turkey" then I prepare the turkey according to the Homestyle/Michigander way. I use a meat injector to get some of the water/seasoning mixture into the bird before I pour the mixture all over it. I use a roasting pan with a lid and I leave it. I do not uncover it to baste or anything until time is up. I get rave reviews every time. The remaining turkey stock makes an excellent gravy with a very easy recipe on this site called "Savory Turkey Gravy".

Good basic recipe. I like to mix in some herbs with the butter before spreading it under the skin. I also spread some inside the cavity. I always place an onion inside for a boost of flavor; it also helps made the bird juicy.

I have never made a turkey in my life!!  This was amazing!!!  My mom always cooks for all the holidays so I feel no pressure to impress.  However, as mom gets older, eventually the cooking will be my responsibility. So, I wanted to see if I could do this.  I used this recipe and made a small test turkey.  I loved it.  I ate turkey all week and never got bored.  The gravy was incredible and perfect for dunking your turkey sandwiches.  My son, who does not eat turkey, had several servings.  The gravy is better than my moms, but don't tell her I said that.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING! I have never, in my entire life, had so many compliments on something I've cooked. EVER! And I'm a pretty good cook! Since Thanksgiving my relatives have been raving about the "best turkey they've ever had", non-stop! So much so, that I had to make another turkey just to appease them! 

I do have a small tip to share that takes this recipe one step further. After the turkey has been allowed to rest, carve it immediately and place meat into the juices/drippings (after you remove some for gravy!). Let it soak about 10-15 minutes before serving. Trust me, it's heavenly! You will never eat a moister bird, guaranteed!

Just a final note, I did add more butter to the outside of the bird in addition to the butter under the skin, as someone had suggested in a previous review. I quite recommend it!

Turkey turned out awesome! I skipped the parsley and used onion powder. Covered the breast with foil until the last hour of cooking and baked at 330 degrees. I stuffed with Bread and Celery Stuffing from this site. Turned out a beautiful golden color and delicious!

Amazing turkey! I used chicken stock instead of the water/bouillon (all I had on hand.) Instead of 4 cups, I used a cup and a half (and that was more than enough for us.) Very juicy and tender. Kept it uncovered for an hour, skin crisped right up. Family loved it and asked for it again next year. I also submitted a photo of my turkey using this recipe to a local radio station (a contest for best cooked turkey of the Lowcountry) and won :D

I followed this recipe last year to cook my first turkey for Thanksgiving. Having never cooked a turkey, I was a bit nervous but the recipe was easy to follow and the turkey turned out perfect! golden brown and juicy inside. I will be using this recipe every year from now on and pass it on to family and friends. I wouldn't change a thing. Delicious!

I've always added liquid to the pan when roasting a turkey along with bouillon cubes and butter.  Never understood why so many professionals tell you not to add any liquid.  Rated four stars because there's no mention of this:  For juiciness and tenderness, I've learned to always brine that bird first.  And you don't need to get all fancy with the brine recipe to get a tender and juicy result, just flip it over halfway through the brining process.  To roast, thoroughly rinse the turkey inside and out; pat it dry.  Stuff the turkey if desired.  Place it in the pan and rub it down with olive oil.  Sprinkle with your herb(s) of choice.  Add water or chicken broth/stock to about 1/4", 2-3 chicken bouillon cubes, several small blobs of butter, and about 1/2 cup of chopped celery.  Tent the breast and drumsticks with aluminum foil and pop it into the oven.  After about 1-1/2 hours, start basting periodically; add a little water to the pan as needed.  When you come down to the final 30-45 minutes, remove the tent to allow the breast and legs to brown.  I'm looking (fondly) at a big ol' tom turkey in the field behind my house right now . . . LOL!

I made this turkey for thanksgiving, and the whole family loved it.  My husband and I thought it tasted a lot like my mothers (which always made the best turkey).  When I told my mother how I prepared this turkey she said this is the same recipe as hers.  By chance we happen to be from Michigan.  This recipe will be a keeper it was very easy to prepare and very moist and full of flavor.

First Turkey ever, came out perfect! I had a 22lb bird, so I doubled the recipe, and buttered that sucker GOOD. I followed the "most helpful" review that said for a turkey that size to do 375 for the first for, then reduce to 350 for 4 more hours. I put our unstuffed turkey in at 8:30am covered, basted every hour, and uncoverd for the last hour, basting every 20 min. Came out at 1:45pm PERFECT Thank you for this recipe, it's the only one I'll use!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. So good!!!! The butter inside the skin is key, really adds moist flavor. I realized last minute I didn't have chicken bullion and had to sub a raman noodles chicken flavor packet (grrrrr!!!) but it was still great. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe (and I don't particularly even care for turkey!) I made some minor changes to this recipe that made it absolutely amazing.  I only used 2 cups warm water and added 2 cups of chicken stock to pour over the turkey and mixed half of the dry ingredients in the water/stock mixture before I poured it over the turkey.  I added the other dry ingredients to the butter (except the seasoned salt...also I used an entire stick of butter for this recipe) and rubbed it everywhere on the turkey so it would come out moist.  I also added fresh rosemary and thyme along with a quartered orange to the inside of the turkey before I put it in the oven.  I was shocked at how fantastic it came out and how even the pickiest eaters loved it...not bad for a first turkey if I may say so myself!

Since I used this recipe I will never make turkey any other way! I always get raves about how tender and juicy it is! When I find myself without bouillion, I use a packet of Lipton's onion soup mix in the water and it still comes out great.

Warning:  use only if you can handle the guilt of out-doing your mother and mother in law's turkeys!  Used this recipe for my first thanksgiving turkey ever and it was a smash hit!  Had to adjust for an 18 lb turkey and the color came out fablous.  So tender and juicy!

THis turkey was legit the bomb.com.  SUPER moist. THe moistest of any turkey.  Everybody lost their BUTTS over this turkey.  I strongly suggest that everyone do this.  I also didn't know that you could pull the skin back on the turkey, so I cut pockets into it for the butter.  Turned out fantastically.

Best turkey recipe by far!  I like to keep my Thanksgiving meals traditional, so this one for the turkey is the way to go.  Very simple and so moist!  This was my first time making the Thanksgiving turkey and I was really nervous about how it would turn out and was pleasantly surprised!  I had a 18.5 lb Turkey and prepped it the night before (cleaned, seasoned), covered it tightly with foil in the roaster pan and refrigerated overnight. Cooked at 350 for 5.5 hours.  The broth was plentiful for the gravy.  The meat literally fell of the bone.  I made the Bread and Celery stuffing recipe from this site and the Easy Turkey Gravy from this site and everything was awesome!

Being from Michigan, I assumed I knew how to do this already but used this recipe as my guide this year at Thanksgiving. The broth with the parsley is a nice touch that I haven't tried before, it added to my pan drippings nicely and the turkey turned out to be the best, most moist turkey I've prepared yet. This with a Butterball is definitely a winner.

Often I tweak recipes for my families taste, but I just left this as it was (except that I don't use seasoning salt ever so I used poultry seasoning, garlic powder, pepper and salt in its place)...this was awesome and so easy!  The turkey was moist and flavorful and I didn't have to run back and forth basting...love that!  I also love that the drippings weren't so over powering and salty and made a nice gravy (brined a bird and had horridly salty drippings...a lot more trouble than it was worth too!).   This is a keeper!

GREAT RECIPE (with changes!): I used 4 cans chicken broth instead of water & bouillon. I stuffed the neck area with half large onion & secured it. Stuffed the body loosely with celery & half onions. Only used Lowry's garlic salt, celery salt, onion powder & touch paprika for the spices.  I also browned the turkey in 400 degree oven for 1/2 hour, took it out added broth to pan, covered it (sealing the foil to pan) & turned down the oven to 325 for rest of cook time. About 1 hr before it was done I checked it, put it back in uncovered to brown more. Moist & Delish! We had this for an early Thanks Giving with visiting son & fiance. It impressed my son so much that he asked for the recipe & made this for their family's Thanks Giving and got RAVE reviews! He said that's the only way he's going to make Turkey from now on! So Good! Gravy turns out fantastic too (didn't need to add any more spices)!

I made this the other night. It turned out great. The bird fell apart. I am using the leftovers tonight for a turkey pot pie. I made it exactly as written except I used a 17 lb turkey. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making it again!

Yummmm. I used a chicken instead of turkey because thats what i had. This is the first time cooking a whole bird so i accidently cooked it upside down. I hear that's a good thing ;) What a great meal to go with mashed potatoes and gravy. I over indulged and thanks for a wonderful meal!

This is a good recipe. Kind of bland but its easy and has a nice flavor for the most part. The only difference I made was I used fresh onion and extra fresh parsley. I would probably use this recipe again.

This year was my second year making turkey with this recipe and everyone loved it as much as they did last year.  My family is from Michigan, so I was drawn to the recipe.  I thought I had rated it back than but shows I had not rated it.  It is just delicious and makes the turkey so moist and delicious.  Will continue to make this for years to come.  Just outstanding!

This was one of the most flavorful, moist turkeys I've ever made. I did sqeeze the juice of several oranges over the outside of the turkey and then stuffed the carcass with the orange rinds. The gravy was really good, too.

I tried this recipe 4 years ago I have been making it for Thanksgiving ever since. It is a huge hit even my mother in law liked it and asked for the recipe!! The only addition Ive made is adding an apple and orange into the cavity of the bird. Really amazing recipe, but make sure your aluminum foil is on really good!!

I did change things just a little. I added poultry seasoning to the butter. And I only had chicken bouillon and season salt. I added 2 tablespoons of Sazon seasoning to the broth. And I used an injector. The turkey was moist & flavorful.

Oh my goodness. I made this with a turkey breast, halving the spice mixture but still using the full amount of butter. I didn't baste once, yet still had the most amazing, moist, well-flavored turkey I do believe I've ever eaten (though to be fair, the family usually just roasts them plain, maybe with stuffing in the cavity). It was superb. The gravy was also divine, though it did seem a tad salty. Looking back, with all the salt in the bullion I will be sure to use unsalted butter next time and hopefully that will cure it. The Man made the gravy, but I know he used water and cornstarch on the stove with good results. I agree with others, this is PERFECT for the first-time turkey chef. Thanks SO MUCH for sharing!

So easy and extremely moist. Made gravy out of the drippings. I ended up using a whole stick of butter. That was the only difference.

Oh how I wish I would have followed the directions just how they stated. This was my first time making a turkey and because of the high ratings, I decided this was the recipe for me. Prepared the bird exactly as instructed, but heard from so many people on facebook to cook the bird low overnight... well did this and the breast ended up a little on the dry side. The turkey itself was falling off the bones, we didn't even have to "carve" it because u could just pull it apart with a fork. It still came out delicious, and I will try again as instructed and re-rate. Have added to my recipe box and look forward to trying again sometime BEFORE thanksgiving...

Bought a last minute fresh turkey and put it on my covered roaster. Fell asleep while it was cooking and it cooked probably 7 hours. Not burnt to a crisp thanks to the water an it's falling off the bone! Thanks for the great recipe!

THANK YOU for this recipe. I followed it exactly and the turkey was delicious.  I made a 16 pound turkey and cooked it 4 hours in the foil and 45 uncovered.  It was a beautiful brown on the outside.  I was so proud of my turkey!!!

Last year was my first time ever making a turkey.  As one who despises dry turkey meat, which was why I didn't eat turkey, my family wanted turkey so I tried this recipe and it was AWESOME!!! The breast meet was soooo moist and tender! My whole family loved it so much - and yes even I did - that there was none left over, and many were left wanting more!  Now I'm designated as the turkey person, and I will definitely be making it again this year, but this time I will mix some garlic salt/powder into the butter before stuffing it into the breast as others mentioned.  Thanks for a marvelous recipe Robin!

I made this for a large group of men going west on a rock climbing expedition a week before Thanksgiving since they would be missing the big day. I've never made a turkey before and I made TWO 12 pounders. 16 people ravished the turkeys saying they've never had a turkey juicer and so delicious before. I did use Mrs. Dash instead of seasoning salt because I forgot to pick it up (whoops) and I used Better Than Boullion because I have a gluten intolerance. Yum Yum Yum!

My husband and I have made this three times now; it's the only turkey he'll make for the holidays. It is absolutely delicious. Moist and tender without changing a single thing. Look no further!

This was wonderfully moist and tasty! We don't eat the skin, so I put all the butter under the skin, cooked the bird, and removed the skin afterwards. The meat was so moist, even the next day! No more dry Thanksgiving turkeys for us! Thank you!

This was amazing.  When I put it on the cutting board the bottom half seperated from the top and I just pulled the dark meat off the bones.  The white meat rivaled my smoked white meat which is hard to do.  Old family recipe.  Will never cook a turkey any other way.  Kuddos

This was PERFECT!!  I made a 22.5 pound turkey.  I doubled everything EXCEPT THE SEASON SALT.  I read somewhere NOT to double that!  Also, I had to use a turkey baster to take out some of the yummy drippings before they spilled over the edge, but all of the drippings made the most fantastic gravy.  Needed no other seasonings.  Everyone raved about how tender and how tasty this turkey was.  I will NEVER make another turkey!!

STUPENDOUS! Mine & my family's taste buds were in HEAVEN! =0 )   I followed the directions as written. Then I added a bayleaf to the bottom of the pan. I grated 1/4 of a sweet onion and also placed that under the skin with the butter. I sliced the rest of the onion & inserted that into the cavity with rosemary and 1/4 cup of white wine.    The results were absolutely AMAZING! And what a FABULOUS taste the pan gravy had!

Made this for Thanksgiving, but doubled the recipe for my 22 lb turkey. Followed advice to cook for 5 hours total (1 at 375 and 4 at 350), by the time we were ready to eat the meat was literally falling off the bone! I had people tell me they have never eaten such a moist and tender turkey!! This will be a Thanksgiving regular in my house for sure!!

This was okay.  I have stolen the "pats of butter under the skin" bit from this recipe and combined it with the "Perfect Turkey" recipe.  We really prefer our turkey brined - it just makes it so juicy.

All i have to say is WOW!!!!! I've never cooked a turkey before in my life! I cooked my very first Thanksgiving this year and used this recipe. I used a cooking bag like some suggested and I also buttered the outside of the turkey too. I doubled the recipe for the liquid part becuase we had a 23 pound turkey. My brother brought over his turkey he cooked too, and he's a top professional chef, and my turkey blew his away!! It was so tender and so flavorful, people in my family coudln't believe I made it. Best tasting turkey i've ever tasted and they have ever tasted in their life and we've eaten ALOT of Turkey! Also had PLENTY of drippings left over which made an AMAZING gravy!

This is a GREAT turkey recipe. I did modify it a little based on my family's preferences and on tips I saw on the food network. It came out the BEST bird I had ever eaten. I did brine the bird overnight in apple cider (and water), kosher salt, parley, thyme, rosemary, and garlic though, so that would have made it even more juicy.

The changes that I made were as follows:

--Since I was using a 15lb turkey, I used 8 tbls of butter instead of 6 tbls.
--To the other seasonings I added the zest of one lemon and the zest of 1/2 of an orange.
--I omitted the seasoning salt because I had brined it and didn't want it to wind up too salty.

Instead of just putting butter under the skin and pouring a liquid mixture of the other ingredients over the top, this is what I did (I learned this trick from food network):

I softened the butter and mixed in the herbs and the zests, making a paste. I rubbed part of the paste under the skin of the bird. Then I squeezed the juice of the lemon and the orange on the outer skin and rubbed some more of the paste on the outer skin. I put 1/2 of the lemon and 1/2 of the orange rind in the cavity of the turkey along with the remainder of the butter and herb paste and a 1/2 of an onion. It came out VERY juicy and VERY easy to carve.

Thank you SO much for a GREAT base of ingredients for seasoning my holiday turkeys.

I've been making this turkey recipe for several years now and it tastes better every year! I add strips of bacon on top of the turkey to make the meat even more juicier (remove from turkey after bacon is cooked)! Also, I continue to baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so with the juices in the pan, which helps soak in the flavor. 

Great turkey recipe!!!

With a couple tweeks this turkey could be amazing. First off I wish I had checked the temp of my turkey earlier on. I checked it at exactly 3 hours and it was fully cooked. My turkey was just under 12lbs and I never would have thought it would cook that fast!  The only other thing is if you plan to use the pan gravy I would recommend lowering the season salt to 1 tablespoon, it was sooooo salty, and I like things salty. Other than that the turkey was very tender, it almost fell apart when I tried to get it out of the roasting pan, and the meat was very moist.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe was so easy to follow, and turned out awesome! I used a butter ball turkey and put it in the oven for about 4 hours on 350 degrees F. I used more butter than the recipe asked for and I used chicken broth instead of water. The turkey I had was 8 kg. Thanks so much for a great recipe, the turkey was gone in minutes!

Terrific!  I did use a brine from this site and the turkey did not take as long to cook - it fell off the bone!  I did forget to cover it with foil sprayed with cooking spray so the skin stuck to the roasting lid.  I'll make this again and again and again!

Awesome recipe!  I have never made a turkey before and had to make one at Christmas for 24 people.  This recipe made the best turkey that I have EVER had.  I made a fourteen pound turkey (the size we usually have for our family) and the entire thing was gone.  My mom and grandma said that they can't ever remember when the family had eaten a whole turkey!  I did make two small adjustments.  I used canned broth instead of bouilloun.  I also stuffed the cavity and bottom of pan with chopped carrots, celery, and onion.  I definetely would recommend this recipe for anyone making a turkey (especially for the first time).  Thanks so much for the post!

AWESOME!!!! Only thing I did different from the original recipe was to use a can of chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.  Tender, moist, succulent, so good it should be illegal! :)

Amazing recipe! I've made this turkey twice just to prove to myself it wasn't a fluke it came out so perfectly. I had never cooked a turkey before and it looked straight out of a magazine. I cooked it in a bag and opened it for the last hour or so of cooking to brown it well. Don't be afraid of the butter, it really makes the bird! Thanks for the awesome recipe, I'll probably never cook a turkey any other way! If I could give 10 stars, I would!

I have never cooked a turkey before and I was very nervous.  I decided to experiment because my husband brought home a free bird from his boss.  I happened to pick this recipe for my maiden voyage and it is the best culinary decision I have ever made...this bird was divine.  My mother-in-law said it looked like it could be on the cover of a magazine and it tasted better than any turkey we've ever had.  I felt like an award winner with this turkey!!  I followed the recipe exactly and the timer popped out at about four hours (12lb. bird).  I took it out and let it set before cutting into.  Absolutely delicious!!  I am thirty years old and my first turkey recipe will be the one I use until I am ninety!

This is a great recipe! Everyone loved it!  I had a 20lb turkey and so adjusted the recipe appropriately - I also cooked the turkey at 400 degrees for an hour and then at 350 for another 3 hours.  I used a stick and a half of butter and like another reviewer, really made sure the bird was buttered!  It turned out soo golden brown (I've posted a pic) - and was so moist.  I did add bacon strips on top of the turkey by demand of the family...this will be my turkey recipe from now on :)

Best turkey I have ever eaten, next year I'm making the turkey to take to my in-laws house. I added one clove of garlic and 1 tsp rosemary, but other than that I followed the directions exactly and it was moist and flavorful.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! When I told my family this was my first turkey, they were preparing to grab their knives and forks thinking they would have to cut into some dry bird. They were amazed how tender and juicy the breast was and several commented over and over that this was the best turkey they ever tasted! For a 22 lb turkey, I used two sticks of butter. I used most of it under the breast and the rest I smothered all over the bird. I put onions, celery, bay leaves and garlic cloves in the cavity and followed the rest of the instructions accordingly. It took 4 hours and was a beautiful golden brown. The neck and giblets I threw in the slow cooker separately w/ more celery, onions, etc and made a delicious gravy with the stock from the turkey. I can't wait to make this again for Xmas! Thanks for the great recipe.

I am not a Turkey fan at all! I was raised in a house where the Turkey was so dry it got stuck in your throat. Anyways, this recipes is without a doubt the BEST turkey recipe out there. I have been making this one for 5 years now. Last year my Mother ate it and was blown away (how in the world could her son cook better than her!?). Everyone that tries is, uses it for their holiday dinner! I have read a few negative reviews- I am lost on how anyone could not give this a perfect rating. Try it once, and you will use it over and over.

Awesome flavor and aroma. My husband thought the turkey was done after an hour cause it smelled so good. Made it today for Canadian Thanksgiving and followed the recipe with only one exception. The butcher had nearly removed the legs and removed a large portion of the skin he chopped such a large whole for stuffing (the joys of picking frozen products in opaque wrapping). Point is I was afraid the bird would fall apart if I slit the skin open so we just rubbed the butter on. And for anyone else with a overly butchered bird use dental floss to tie the legs together, if you want it tigher still tie the legs to the wings.

Great recipe.  Smells great while cooking.  Easy no chopping vegetables. Makes a very great tasting and plentiful stock for gravy.  It works wonderful with the Easy Turkey Gravy recipe from this site (jmor777)

I did this for my first turkey and it was really yummy. I didnt have the boulion granules so I used 9 cubes and it made a great gravy and the turkey had good flavor (even my turkey-hating husband said it was the best he'd had). I over cooked it a bit so it wasnt as tender as I'd hoped, but that was my fault, not the recipe's.

This is hands-down, the best recipe for old fashioned roast turkey.  Juice was just oozing from the white meat as it was being carved!  I did roast it on a rack, because there's so much broth it would get soggy without one. Also, when I basted it I would sometimes stick the baster under the skin.  The drippings made about 1 quart of gravy and it was to die for.  Awesome recipe!

My first time ever cooking a Turkey for a large group of my friends turned out to be the biggest cooking success! I have gotten so many comments about how this could be the best turkey they have ever tasted in their life. I followed the recipe exactly except for the baking. I lightly patted the turkey down with canola oil and I baked it at 500 for about 50 minutes and then the rest of the time covered it with a foil to bake for 2.5 more hours at 350. I also gave the turkey a brining from the night before. I am so excited about it that I will try to make this again at my aunt's Thanksgiving! Thank you!!

I cooked this turkey the way the recipe called for it. I wasn't too impressed. The turkey did not have a lot of flavor. The minced onion and parsley flakes didn't seem to add a whole lot. Also, I didn't even get to use my baster. The turkey skin just tasted salty. However, the bird did come out pretty moist.

I've made this several times, and usually, my only changes are stuffing it with an apple, onion, and a couple carrots, plus an extra T. of boullion. I typically do my browning early, so I don't have to risk drying out the turkey in case it reaches the desired temp earlier than expected. Today, I had some old Southwestern Chicken & Herb-flavored boullion I wanted to get rid of, and as it turned out, this tasted even better than usual. It's my favorite turkey recipe, either way!

Definitely easy and defintiely moist.  However, I didn't taste any of the spices really coming through.  It was just good plain turkey.  We definitely needed the gravy to give it some flavor.

I didn't used to love turkey, but now I do thanks to this awesome, easy to make recipe. I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect. My parents and brother's family say I'll be making the turkey from now on! With this recipe, I don't mind at all. Umm umm, tasty, tender, and golden, just the way turkey should be!

My parents and brother's family say I'll be making the turkey from now on! With this recipe, I don't mind at all. Umm umm, tasty, tender, and golden, just the way turkey should be!

Excellent!  The moistest turkey we've had.  Added Bells seasoning to the top in addition to the seasoned salt (couldn't do without the smell of Bell's).  I was hesitant about 4 cups of liquid in the pan but I am glad I followed the recipe.  Delish!

I made this for my first Thanksgiving turkey because all of the reviews assured me it was easy. Sure enough, the turkey was perfect and everyone raved about it. I made a 21 lb turkey and opted to use an oven bag like another reviewer suggested. I followed the recipe exactly except left out the water because I was using the oven bag. I cooked the turkey for 4 hrs 15 min and it was perfectly brown and juicy. I also used the top floating grease in the bag to make paste with flour and added the rest of the juice to make the gravy. It was the perfect consistency and soooo tasty.  Thanks again for a first turkey success.

I love this recipe!  We have been making this recipe for the past 4 years - it has become a holiday staple in our house.  We have even "converted" family members & friends to cooking their turkey the Michigander Way.  For the two reviews before concerning how to cook the turkey - put the foil directly on the turkey & put the turkey directly on the bottom of the pan with the boulion.

WOW!  This was an awesome bird!  I know what I am having for Christmas dinner!
Here are other dishes from allrecipes we had with our Thanksgiving dinner that were just as great:
Grandma's Green Bean Casserole, Buttery Cooked Carrots, Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic, Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe, Double Quick Dinner Rolls, Irresistible Pecan Pie, and Libby's Pumpkin Pie.

Happy Eating!

The only change we make to this recipe is to put the turkey in an oven bag- then pour the broth mixture on and sprinkle with seasoning salt.  The oven bag ensures that the turkey stays juicy- not dry.  We make this every year and it is always fabulous.  Thanks for sharing!

I hate to be the only negative review but my turkey was very dry.  I couldn't believe it after all the great reviews.  I used a fresh bird and followed the directions to the letter.  The bird looked beautiful when it came out of the oven but so disappointing when there was no juice when slicing.

I have made so many turkeys in my life and by far this is ABSOLUTELY the best way!!!  The end result will be a super moist & juicy delicious bird!!  Put it with the "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing" from this site and you will not be sorry!!!  Only thing that I do differently is season the butter before applying under the skin - every thing else to the T.  Excellent!!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I loved this juicy tky receipe! I followed other suggestions by 1. Add butter under the skin and in joint area around legs, add lots of buter under skin to keep moist.Rubbing the outside of bird with 1 stick of butter, before adding boullion. I washed my bird the night before and prepared it as described above. The next morning it was very simple to just bake it. I also used a meat thermometer to reach the right temperature.

This was a must try because I got through 40 reviews before finding one that wasn't raving about the results. This was the best turkey I have ever prepared. I've been trying new recipes for the 2003 Thanksgiving and this one will definately be on our menu.  Nothing to add to make it better. This recipe proves that keeping it simple is the best way.

My hubby made this for Thanksgiving 2002.  He admittedly is not the best cook, but this turned out terrific.  We added extra garlic to it.  It was moist even when eaten as cold leftovers!  Very good recipe.  Will definitely use over and over again.

I have never made a turkey before, but this turned out excellent!  I think it is even better than fried turkey.  It was sooo moist, tender and flavorful!  I brined my turkey first in salt and brown sugar, but I don't know how much of a difference that made.  This was perfect -- couldn't have been better!

This was my first turkey and it turned out perfect. I did baste it a few times to get the browning effect, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Thank you Robin for making my first Thanksgiving turkey a winner.

What an easy recipe! This was my first Thanksgiving that I've ever made a turkey myself so I was a bit intimidated but my hubby, daughter and best friend loved it!!!! Although it wasn't as moist as my Mom's turkey is (I have yet to find out what her secret is!!!LOL) it was very easy to do. I dunno if it's just me but I bought a 12 lb turkey and it seemed to shrink a little when I cooked it!! I got scared when I took off the foil and it wasn't browned at all but it did brown beautifully as stated in the recipe when I cooked it for 45 min without foil on it! Thanks so much Robin...I had a successful 1st turkey!!!!

This bird was the tenderest, juiciest turkey I have ever tasted, and my father agreed! Next time I am going to try putting the pats of butter not only in the breast meat but in the drumsticks as well! Thanks for an AWESOME turkey recipe! You saved Thanksgiving!

The moistest turkey I've ever made. For more flavor, I added two bulbs of garlic (separated into cloves) into the cavity of the turkey.

This had to be the best turkey I have ever cooked and the gravy was heavenly. I usually make the gravy out of those little packets you get at the store (shame on me). Never again. This turkey had the most flavorful drippings I ever saw. This will be my turkey recipe every year from now on.

Yum-yum! I've cooked turkey a number of ways over the years, like using a cooking bag, a turkey roaster, and a smoker. This was absolutely the best turkey I've ever prepared. My family raved over the flavor and especially the moistness of the breast meat. I think putting the pats of butter in the little pockets was the secret. Thanks for providing the recipe and letting me cook it for my Oklahoma family.

Best tasting turkey I've ever had.  Moist and flavorful.  Everyone raved.  The only thing I did different was cook it in a cooking bag, and cut the liquid in half.  I'll definitely do it this way from now on

Being as unfamiliar with the kitchen as I am I had a little bit of trouble with the instructions. This was my first turkey (2000) and everyone loved it. I didn't have a bag for it b/c it was 23 lbs. but it turned out very juicy and tender.

I used this recipe for a 20 lb farm raised Turkey and it was delicious.  I increased the water to 6 c, but it still wasn't enough and had to add more during cooking.  I also added more chicken bouillon.  The juice made the best gravy ever!  I will use this recipe again!

I've been using this recipe for several years. It's excellent as is but I do add some olive oil to the butter I slather the bird with. Makes for a pretty brown bird with crispy skin and juicy,flavorfulmeat.

I know I have rated this before but this is the best way to cook a turkey.  Everyone raves how moist it is.  This is the only way I will make a turkey.

This was the 2nd turkey I have ever made for Thanksgiving. It was the most suculent amazing turkey I have ever made or tasted in my life. The left overs were amazing (and I hate left over turkey). It was so juicy that after heating it back up in the microwave ALL you had to do was barely touch the meat and the juice flowed out of it. Needless to say my family was very very VERY PLEASED. WILL BE MY GO TO RECIPE EVERY YEAR. THANK YOU. I will add that I seasoned my butter with herbs before rubbing all over in and out.

I am not much of a cook I ruin everything, but I have made this turkey 3 times and it is the best. My kids told me to give the recipe to my mom for her Thanksgiving turkey. I didn't change anything made exactly as it says and it is awesome.

I had never cooked a turkey before and after looking at numerous recipies, I chose this one.  I have now cooked 4 turkey dinners over the last few years using this recipe and it ALWAYS comes out perfect.  My only suggestion would be if you are cooking a bigger turkey, to put a pan below to catch any overflow or maybe reduce the liquid slightly. This last Christmas, I cooked a 21 pound turkey...didn't change any of the measurements and it was still perfect.....but the drippings did overflow and cleaning the oven was a pain!

Fantastic! I have used this recipe for the last 6 years. Even on a butterball or just 2 turkey legs. Turkey is always moist. But stop basting a little earlier and drizzle with a little olive oil if you want some crisper skin.

This Thanksgiving I splurged with a free-range organic turkey. This recipe was awesome! The meat was juicy and buttery. My guests loved every bite and made "mmmm" sounds when they ate. It might be from Michigan, it tastes good anywhere.

We used to oven bake turkeys then started deep fat frying in peanut oil. YUMMMMmmmmm. We will never go back. Now the oven is freed up to make pies and other things.

Just didn't really like it.  The chicken boullion flavor took away from the turkey. It also didn't brown very well and I followed the temp and time directions.

I'll try letting it sit with seasoning next time. The flavors didn't absorb much, but the drippings more than made up for it.

This past Thanksgiving I cooked the Thanksgiving dinner for the first time. I used this turkey recipe, and I thought it was great! Everybody really enjoyed the turkey. It was very juicy, which isn't the norm with turkeys I've had in the past. I would make this recipe again. It was very easy and delicious.

Knocked it out of the park!  Thank you!  The drippings were a bit salty - thus the gravy, too (and I am a salt lover).  Will probably skip the seasoning salt next time, but this was the moistest, yummiest turkey I have ever tasted, let alone cooked myself.  Outstanding!

This was my first year for, not only hosting my families Thanksgiving but my first time cooking a turkey.  My mother has always been known for her turkey consistently being dry.  I feared mine would be the same.  With this recipe, the turkey was extremely moist and everyone loved it.  Very easy to follow as well.

I used this recipe on a wild turkey that we thought was going to be pretty tough, but it turned out incredibly tender and delicious!  We did cut it up though to fit in our cast iron dutch oven, so that may have helped, but I loved this recipe and all I added was chopped garlic to it.  Thank you!

My husband and I love this turkey recipe. We're both from Michigan and we're currently living in North Carolina on a Marine base. I NEVER cooked a turkey in my life, so I was quite nervous. I cooked this turkey for 9 Marines and ourselves and we absolutely loved it! We loved it so much that I cooked it again for my father in-law and us for Christmas, then for Thanksgiving this year. I have a feeling I'm going to be using this recipe for quite a while! The only trouble I have is making sure the gravy is the right consistency due to the oils. But I think that's just due to my lack of experience in the gravy-making field, haha. Once again, we LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

I have been experimenting with turkey recipes for the last 16 years, and this was the best. I used my own seasonings; however, the idea of putting the chicken broth at the bottom of the pan and covering it with tin foil and removing the tin foil for the last 45min. was what made this turkey DELICIOUS!!!

Used fresh onion due to not having the dried minced onion on hand. The whole gang loved it!

Wow, this was an amazing dish. I gave it four stars because I like a little more seasoning. I added Mrs. Dash and a lot more butter. I also stuffed it with some vegetables. During the cooking I added a lot more butter. This turned out to be an extremely moist turkey!!! I was very pleased!!1

This was my first time cooking a turkey and it turned out perfectly. My boyfriend insisted we get an 18-lb. bird (which is huge). I followed the recipe and cooked it at 350 for a little less than 4 hours. So moist and flavorful - left overs were awesome too!

Flavorful turkey.  Super easy.  I stuffed the turkey and the stuffing came out super moist, not my ,but others loved it. Uncovered for about 50 minutes then tented with foil and didn't open the oven until it was done.

Followed the recipe exactly. This turkey was moist, but I would have preferred a little more flavor to the meat itself. Next time I will add flavor the butter with herbs and place under the skin to give an added kick. Just gave 4 stars because the taste was not really anything spectacular.

I liked the simplicity and the ingredients were "on hand".  However, the flavor never got past the skin.  I was hoping for an all over flavor within the meat.  The turkey turned out pretty plain in taste, but it looked good.

I had never cooked a whole bird in my life before trying this recipe, and it got nothing but compliments.  Took a bit longer than expected, about four and a half hours, but possibly due to my tiny European oven?  Anyway, it was really good and incredibly simple.  I can't wait to use up the leftovers!

This is my first turkey recipe and will most likely be my last. This turkey was the moistest turkey I have EVER had. I had a 6-7lb unstuffed turkey and it was cooked perfectly after 2 hours and 45 minutes :)

We ended up with a 23 lb turkey this year and I decided to use this recipe for preparing it. It was fabulous! we haven't had turkey in 10 years because every time it was made it came out bland and dried out. This was delish! I mashed some poultry seasoning into the butter before I put it under the skin. Did not have to add any water/bouillon because it just wouldn't have fit in the pan. Came out juicy and flavorful. I will be passing this simple and delish recipe to my daughter!! Thanks

OMG! This recipe is awesome. This thanksgiving was my first time cooking the turkey and thanks to this recipe there was no leftover turkey. I did add a few extras. I added in a can of sprite and stuffed it with savory stove top stuffing. I did not add any water to the stuffing because I knew it was going to get wet from the turkey juices. This a recipe that I will use every Thanksgiving.

Hooray!  This recipe saved Thanksgiving!  The turkey was beautiful, moist, and delicious.  No one would know it was our first time hosting Thanksgiving... we looked like old pros!  My husband's aunt even told me very quietly (so Great Grandma wouldn't hear) that it was the most delicious turkey she'd ever had.  She may just have been being nice, but I'll take it.

My husband does the turkey every year. After years of telling him he should try this recipe he finally relented and agreed to try it (yes, to get me off of his back, but whatever). Guess what....everyone loved it, said it was the best one so far! Dare I say I told you so?

Brilliant recipe.  I left the bird unstuffed, put most of the herbs in the body cavity, then poured some liquid into the cavity and some over the top into the pan.  This keeps the pan liquid clean enough to make an attractive gravy without much straining.

Great tasting bird but far too much seasoning salt in the recipe.  Guests were disappointed that they could not eat the skin because it was way too salty.  Also, with all the liquid in the bottom of the pan, there was nothing to scrape off for the gravy and the liquid was way too salty to use as well.

I have to apologize, as the way I did this turkey bears only a slight resemblance to the original recipe.  First, I started out with a 22 lb turkey.  I did put the butter under the breast skin and sprinkled the turkey with the seasoned salt as stated in the recipe.  I stuffed the turkey also.  I didn't pour water over the turkey, as I didn't see how those good browned drippings could form in the bottom of the pan (that make that good gravy) if there was water in there.  So I waited until the drippings had formed and were good and brown and then added about 3 cups of water to the pan.  I cooked the turkey uncovered at 325 instead of 350, which seamed to work well.  It browned nicely and took about 4 1/2 hours to reach 180 degrees on the meat thermometer.  I usually don't have very good success with turkeys, but this did turn out very good. The meat was nice and moist.  Plus there were lots of good makings of gravy in the bottom of the pan.  Will try it again next year this way.

Best Turkey ever. I did not use as much seasoning, but I did do the butter under the skin. Roasting, I had the oven at 450 for the first 10 min. Then I turned it down to 325. The last 45 min I took off the foil. Most perfectly moist turkey ever.

This recipe gave us some of the tastiest turkey breast meat ever!  We make it in a roaster, rather than in the oven - the skin didn't get brown and crispy because of that, but that really didn't matter.

Made this turkey on my first try at a Thanksgiving meal. Shorter cook time for me but it was a HIT! I used a 12# turkey with no stuffing. The turkey cooked faster than the recipe called for - I had it covered for about 2 hr and 40 minutes, then I realized the temp had hit 180 degrees - so I uncovered it for about 15-20 more minutes and it was set. My hubby is usually pretty picky but even he said that it was juicy enough! I will definately be saving this one!

Made this turkey today. I had to adjust the ingredients some to match what I had on hand. Instead of 4 cups of water with the bouillan I used 3 cups of chicken broth along with 1 cup of water and 1 chicken cube. I also used 6 tbsp of Mrs. Dash instead of the parsley and onion. I put 8 tbsp of butter under the skin. The turkey came out good and everyone was pleased. I am only rating this 4 stars though because I found it a little bland given all the seasonings used. I think next time I will use more seasonings and leave them on the bird for a while before cooking. Overall good recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Moist, flavourful, crispy skin.....perfect! I wouldn't make it again with stuffing inside though, it was very mushy. Good thing I had some baked seperately!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was my first time ever making my own turkey and it was so easy and it turned out wonderful! I cut off table spoons of butter and placed them under the skin all over the bird. It was so tender and the gravy was the most amazing I've ever had with turkey! Family loved it too. This one is a keeper!

We brined it first and therefore left out the salt, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Yum!

This was SO easy and resulted in the most flavorful and moist turkey we have had in years.  I have never made a turkey before but I decided to give it a shot after suffering through dry turkeys prepared by those who shall remain nameless for the last several years.  Many suspicious looks were cast my way as I made this (especially because I omitted "the bag").  But when the turkey was done and on the table everyone raved about how delicious it tasted and I was thus elected to cook all future turkeys =)

LOVE THIS!  I make my brother do the turkey & I do everything else. He complained UNTIL he made it (so easy) & it was PERFECT.  He's so proud that it falls apart & it super moist EVERY TIME!  Thank you so much! buh bye dry turkey!

I used a 16 lb. turkey - substituted chicken broth for bouillon & water. I also added celery to the liquid mixture, added garlic to the rub, and stuffed with sliced navel oranges. We left my teen son home to cook the turkey & he forgot to baste it. It was dry at first taste but I quickly doused the meat with the liquid - saving the bird. The meat fell off the bones - and the liquid made excellent gravy.

I had never cooked a whole turkey before and decided to use this recipe for my first Thanksgiving... and I will never use anything else! This bird was soooooooo amazingly tender and juicy and had more flavor than any other turkey I have ever tasted!! The breast meat was literally soft enough to cut with a fork and bursting with juices and flavor!! I took other reviewers' advice and doubled (probably tripled) the butter. I used the tub margarine and mixed the seasonings in with the butter before placing it under the skin and in all the nooks and crannies. I cooked mine breast side down and then flipped it the last 45 min to get the golden brown skin. I also stuffed the cavity and surrounded the bird by whole garlic cloves, quartered onions, sliced carrots, and sliced celery. This bird was delicious even the next day cold from the fridge and was used in both sandwiches and soups the next week. Simply taking the meat, veggies and broth from the pan + some cooked egg noodles made the best turkey noodle soup eeever! THANK YOU ROBIN!

Okay - After hosting Thanksgiving for the last 8 years, this is the first time I can really say that my turkey was perfect!  It seemed like there was a ton of broth, but it surely did the trick, because even the white meat was moist and delicious.  Next year I will not have to go searching for another recipe - thank you so much, Robin!

Great and EASY recipe.  This was the first turkey I have cooked and it was great.   The turkey was a little dry, but I think I need to cook it a little less next time.

The best recipe I have have used! I would not change a thing! I served this turkey on Thanksgiving, and was asked to serve it again at a potluck one week later.  My guests said it was the best they have ever tasted, and I agree!

The flavor of this turkey was really good. And the drippings made the stuffing SO good. However, my bird came out dry. I used a meat thermometer and everything, but it still ended up dry. I'll def use the seasoning again, but I may try an oven bag just to see if I can get my bird to stay moist. Some changes... I used more butter. I was fixing a 22lb bird so naturally had to use more under the skin. I also used chicken broth instead of water, and doubled the bouillon. I kept the seasoning salt the same though. It did end up a bit salty, but not too much. I'll be trying this again.

This is now my official turkey day recipe!  Thank you!  The butter under the skin made the turkey breast so moist and flavorful...usually the turkey is my least favorite thing on the table, but not anymore, it was so good!  I threw some quartered onions, a roughly chopped carrot and celery sticks in the pan with the juices.  Gravy came out great with the drippings.  Thanks!

This turkey turned out wonderful even though I made a few alterations based on what I had on hand. I cooked a 5 lb. turkey breast and cut the ingredients about in half. I used homemade chicken stock instead of bouillon and garlic salt instead of seasoning salt.

This was my very first time cooking turkey, and I gotta say, this was superb, I followed one of the suggestion I found, and I added fresh rosemary to the butter, and rubbed it all over the bird including legs. I had a 24 pound bird and i was scared it wouldn't cook properly. It came out amazing! everybody at thanksgiving was soo impressed, they said that they didn't know turkey could taste that good! :)  thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe and making my little friends tummy so happy :) thank you.

For ease of preparation and flavor this is 5 stars all the way!  I cut the recipe in half and used a 6 lb whole bone-in turkey breast and it was excellent! Did everything according to the directions and had no problems at all.  The gravy was amazing as well!  Thanks for a simple, no-fuss and very tasty method of making a bird!

The recipe is good for the turkey itself - it was very simple and we were happy with it, although it wasn't the best turkey I've made.  I was disappointed with the the gravy I made from the drippings though - it was so salty it was inedible.  The recipe is worth trying, especially for a beginner, just make sure to have a backup plan for your gravy!

This was perfect, my first time cooking cristmas turkey, and I didnt want it turning out dry.  This method provided me with a moist turkey, and very flavourful.  Prpped my turky the day befor by brining with salt and some fruit.  And used additional herbs thyme and rosemary for my 2.5 kg turkey.  Cooked for around 3+ hours covered and aorund only 15 minutes uncovered as my turkey popper had already popped.  All at GM4.  Will definately use again!. A keeper

Roasting my first turkey was a wonderful experience!  I used this recipe for our Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out very well!  I took the advice of another reviewer and sliced butter medallions (with parsley, minced onion, seasoning salt) and placed it beneath the skin (in four areas) of the turkey.  This made a huge difference and made the meat very juicy!  My family is still raving about how moist the turkey was!  Thanks for an awesome and tasty recipe!

This recipe made the moistest turkey ever! This was my first turkey and I was so worried about it being dry. Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe. I changed the herbs since I didn't have the ones required and it was amazing, everyone raved about it. I used poultry seasoning, sage, marjoram and a bit of tarragon. The gravy from that was to die for. I also sprinkled some Lawry's seasoned salt but not too much. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thank you so much!
Update! This is my third year using this recipe. I will never cook it any other way. Thanks so much and I'm glad to see other people enjoy it as much as we do!

This made the most amazing turkey! I brined my turkey overnight first, then followed the recipe.  I was a little worried it might end up too salty when I forgot to cut the salt content of this recipe after brining, but it was perfect!  The only thing I did differently was to also add a couple of tablespoons of butter under the skin of each leg. So easy, no basting required and my small family devoured the entire turkey!  Will try making a larger bird next time so we might actually have some leftovers!

Excellent! The only change I made was adding a little paprika and lemon pepper. The method is perfect, and the broth in the bottom made a beautiful gravy. I just strained it into a sauce pan, brought it to a boil, and added about 3 tbs of cornstarch dissolved in three tbs of cold water. The gravy thickened right up and looked and tasted great! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! I'm a fairly good cook, but this was my first time roasting a turkey. Instead of using minced onion, I stuffed the cavity of the turkey with some fresh onion and celery. I used less seasoning salt (based on some of the reviews I saw) and added some fresh ground pepper. I had to skip the dried parsley because I thought I had some at home but apparently I was out. The turkey was super juicy, and everyone raved about how good it was!

I used a lot more than 6 tablespoons of butter.  I also mixed melted butter seasoned with Cavender's Greek seasoning and injected into the breast in many areas trying to be sure I didn't miss any spots.  I slathered the entire bird with butter, poured the bouillon in the bottom of the pan, left the foil off, didn't baste, cooked at 325 degrees for 15 minutes per pound.  When the timer went off it was the perfect 180 degrees with super moist breast and beautifully golden.

Been using this recipe for a couple years and just never got around to rating.  This is the best Turkey ever!  I was never a Turkey fan before but this recipe rocks; it comes out perfectly golden and crisp outside and unbelievably moist & tender inside.  Don't change a thing!  Family & friends are always asking for this recipe; thanks for the great submission!

Way too much salt, I cut it by half, also added a dash of poultry seasoning and stuffed with cornbread sausage stuffing. Filter the juice and add flour over low heat with another dash of poultry seasoning for a wonderful gravy.

WOW! I made this turkey for my first complete Thanksgiving dinner and it is sooo good. In fact, I went and picked up a few more turkey because it was so good I knew I didnt want to wait another year to have it again. SO easy to make, and I made sure it was done not by the time it had baked, but the internal temperature. I think I ended up cooking it a bit longer than the directions said, but when I did take it out, it tasted perfect! SO moist and juicy. And to get a bit of crisp from the crust, I uncovered it and increased the temperature (also helped cook it faster!). I've collected a bunch of turkey recipes (didnt know which one to try), but dont need them anymore because this is #1!!!! Also from the butter, bouillon and chicken broth it made excellect drippings for gravy. I'm telling you, the BEST Thanksgiving I've EVER had!! Next year at my house everyone!!!!!

This was a heck of a tasty bird. This was my very first time making turkey and with this recipe it was a raving success! I just added some sliced lemon but otherwise it was kept completely the same. Thanks for the great treat. I ended up using a good deal of the broth to make a super tasty gravy (added equal parts flour and water until desired consistency).

I've used this word to describe so many other thanksgiving recipes I used from this site but it definitely applies here. "AWESOME". Thank you Robin C, I never made Turkey before, but this one was SO juicy it squished out juice like some kind of fruit, and was very tender and well cooked. I stuffed mine with a medley of veggies, carrots, celery, fresh thyme, fresh basil, fresh sage and fresh rosemary and onion and a cut up lemon. I let the Turkey temp get to 180 f and the inside 165 f before I took it out. The skin was especially delicious and golden brown. I added a bit of paprika and garlic salt because I was panicking as I didn't have seasoning salt and this combination made sense for some odd reason. anyway, it didn't hurt. The gravy I made from the dripping was great. Oh, and I maybe basted it once or twice with only a tablespoon of the broth from the pan. Fantastic!

I had a 14lb bird, checked it about the time you said to remove the foil on your 12lb bird - and mine was totally dried out and over cooked. It looked like the turkey they served in the movie Christmas Vacation!

Born and raised a Michigander I was obligated to try this recipe!! Indeed a very moist turkey. I did take a suggestion from the previous ratings, and added garlic powder to the butter-lube. I used half seasoning salt and half Garlic salt for the skin. The amount of liquid was almost too much for the pan I had,resulting in the bottom of the bird being submerged in liquid, even though it was resting on a low rack.  For the last hour I drained-off about 4 cups of liquid for later use in the gravy.  I flipped the wire rack in the same pan and placed turkey higher in order to give the bottom a chance to brown up some for the last hour.
Overall, the end result was a very nice, tender turkey, but could have had alittle more time without the foil covering, for a deeper browned skin.  Liquid for the gravy was very nice after straining out various 'chunks' of undesirable globs of skinage.
I'll make again, with a deeper pan or less liquid. :)

Robin, thank you for a great recipe.  This was excellent.  I followed the recipe as written.  I thought of using ready made broth but decided not to.  I used Knorr bouillon and since they are bigger than the normal size ones I only used two cubes.  I also decreased the salt because I didn't want to chance over salting our Turkey.  The gravy I made from it's juices was delicious.  No salt needed at all.  Fantastic recipe!

The best turkey I have ever eaten! In the past, I have purchased very expensive pre-cooked turkeys from various well known places in the Dallas, Texas area. They don't even compare or come close to the quality of this meal. This easy recipe helped me to cook a turkey at home without spending a lot of money. Everyone said that it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. It was moist and super tasty. The turkey literally fell off the bone while carving it. Guests who didn't even care for turkey, liked it. It was a store brand turkey (I actually got it free from a local store) and I used sweet cream butter. It was incredible! I highly recommend it. My only suggestion would be to prepare it the night before, slice it all up ahead of time, soak in the chicken broth mixture remaining in a glass dish, and keep refrigerated overnight. Just pop in the oven (covered with foil) to warm-up the next day or use the microwave instead.

this deserves more than a "5"rating.
 I made this turkey and for the first time since trying to bake a turkey It  has  been a disaster.  I was so ecstatic that I couldn't wait for everyone to sit and eat. My immediate family knew my hesitation when I was asked to make the turkey this year, so they were as happy for me as I was. One thing different that I did was (only because I'm used to doing it this way) to brine the turkey the night before to assure flavor throughout, then I just omitted any other ingredient that would add any more salt.  I used half water and half chicken broth and the spices as noted.I now know it wasn't necessary.
Beautiful taste  Thank you!!! this will now be only way I'll bake my turkeys!!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly and it wasn't juicy at all. I basted it and only had it in the oven for 3 1/2 hrs (it was stuffed with stuffing and was only 10 lbs.) Wasn't that happy with this recipe at all :(

I made this last year with my own slight variation.  The only thing I did different was I also injected the turkey with a broth/butter mix.  It came out fantastic.  It was my first turkey and I got such rave reviews over the turkey that everyone insisted on me making another one for our Christmas potluck.  So I ended up making it twice last year and both times it came out perfect.  I will do this again this year and because of this simple recipe I am no longer afraid of cooking a turkey, because I know that it will come out perfect everytime!!!!

Fantastic! One word of advice from retired Navy cook, do not carve the turkey ahead of time. It dries out so fast you will have cold, dry meat. My ex-mother-n-law would carve this first. THEN do everything else. I couldn't even eat it. 
I wait until everyone is at the table, then bring the turkey out and carve, and serve it. Usually have to carve firsts, then sit down and eat!

I started making this recipe a couple of years ago when I found it on the website and have never looked back.  It is hands down the best, most moist turkey I've ever cooked.  I've followed the recipe, adjusting it for larger birds when needed and it always comes out perfect with little or no basting involved.  My mom, sisters, other relatives have asked for the recipe and we're having it again this year for Thanksgiving.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Thankyou so much for sharing this recipe. I made my very first thanksgiving turkey yesterday and so with company coming, i was a little nervous! Well...i could not have wished for better results! It was perfect and was just as enjoyable earlier today for leftover turkey sandwiches and turkey soup. Great recipe, very easy and very delicious! Thankyou so, so much!! :)

The BEST TURKEY EVER!!!  The only thing I did different was to run 3 small garlic cloves, some fresh chopped rosemary and olive oil under the skin instead of butter.  The most moist turkey and best gravy ever!  Thank you sooooo much Robin!  I will never make turkey another way again!

I am trying to omit butter, but saw this recipe and had two turkey thighs in the refrigerator. I knew they could be dry if not cooked properly, so put them in a casserole dish, poured homemade chicken broth over them, sprinkled liberally with fake butter powder, the minced dried onion, some Emeril's seasoning and a handful of fresh parsley. Baked for 1 hour 1/2 and it was absolutely devine. Very moist and flavorful. I may be dieting, but I don't feel deprived. Will use this again, even for chicken.

I never made a turkey before and was a little nervous about the process. I followed the recipe to exact and ended up with the best turkey dinner I have ever had. Everyone loved it and I was very proud! Thank you for this excellent recipe! I will be making this again next holiday!

I combined the butter and dried seasonings together and stuffed into the pockets. Put it in a roasting pan and placed that in the bbq pit, it only took 3 hrs for a 16 lb turkey to cook. It came out juicy and delicious.

Our local butcher shop didn't recieve their big turkeys so they improvised and gave me two 12 pound birds.  Ended up cooking one on Christmas Eve as my roasting pan just couldn't accomodate two birds.  This recipe was very easy and the turkey turned out great. Even though it cooked faster than the recipe states (was done in 3&1/2 hours) it was still moist and everyone loved it.  I did add fresh rosemary and sage to the butter and I reduced the season salt to 1 TBSP as it looked like enough and it was.  I also took another reviewers advice and did not put the parsley in with the broth, but rather sprinkled it over the bird after the broth had been poured.  Great recipe!

The turkey was excellent!  The white meat was sooo incredibly moist.  I'll definitely make the next turkey this way.  Merry Christmas!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was my first time ever making the turkey.  It turned out GREAT, my husband couldn't stop talking about how juicy it was and even my mom asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was use a full stick of butter and put about 1/2 under the skin then melt the remaining and add that into the broth.  I also cooked it in a bag.

I have always baked my holiday turkey in a bag for moisture.  I was scared to even try something else, but this recipe was the best my whole family has ever even tried.  The only thing I did a little differently was I brined the turkey for 2 days.  I most flavorful and tender turkey, white and dark meat!  Recomend this to all cooks, novice and expert.  Fast and simple and delish!!!!!!!!!!

My husband insisted on having Thanksgiving dinner at our place not knowing that I've never made a Turkey in my life! I came across this recipe, read the reviews, and thanked God that Robin C. shared it. LOL. I followed the recipe exactly, however because it was a 21 LB. bird, I doubled everything, and instead of using 8 cups of water, I used 4 cups of water and 2 cups of white wine (not cooking wine, though). I also injected the Turkey in various places  with the broth/wine mixture before pouring it all over the bird. I followed BMDSINGLE's advice and cooked it for 1 hour at 375º and then lowered it to 350º and cooked it for 5 more hours, basting it every 20 minutes. It turned out so delicious no one believe it was my first Turkey!

I just used this recipe for my first Thanksgiving turkey and the flavor was great. We had a 20-lb bird (the recipe is for a 12-lb bird), but I kept the same quantities of butter and broth solution. I did add some celery, onion, and carrots to the pan and in the cavity. I roasted the turkey breast side down at 425 for the first hour and then turned it down to 325, covered the bird with foil, and occasionally basted it until my meat thermometer registered 180 for the breast--this baking method was the recommendation in "The America's Test Kitchen: Family Cookbook." The only "issue" we had was that the bird generated so much liquid that I actually had to extract some from the pan while it was cooking because it was literally swimming in juices. While this was not necessarily a bad thing--lots of great broth for soups, moist meat, and a golden bird--next time I will follow the cooking instructions in this recipe exactly. I am definitely looking forward to making this turkey again and may try it with a chicken too.

I used this recipe 3 years ago and lost it. I am cooking Thanksgiving Dinner this year and searched the web until I found it. I always remembered the ingredients and I could not forget the compliments I received at the dinner table. The turkey came out very moist and flavorful. The recipe was very simple and fast. With this recipe the turkey won't have a chance to sit in the refrigerator for days waiting to be eaten.Definitely a winner!

This was wonderful!  I added some changes, but I believe the turkey would have still been great...brinded turkey (1 cup corse salt to 1 gal of water, 10-12 hrs) and injected it with 3T butter.  This also makes great gravy, just add flour.

Bravo is all I can say! This Turkey turned out amazing! Very tender, flavorful and all around delicious. One comment however and yes, it's quite trivial but nevertheless, because of the chicken stock this doesn't smell like your traditional "Turkey in the oven". I did find it gave off an odd chicken-esk type fragrance. 

As I said, trivial point but to some the smell of Turkey in the oven is crucial to the day!

This was the first time I made turkey in ten years and it came out perfect. I stuffed it with cooked stuffing mix, cooked rice, raw onions, garlic and sun dried tomatoes. The I will stick to this recipe from now on.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year.  My first turkey, ever! I had my in-laws over and may I tell you that my FIL said it was the best turkey he's ever had! Everyone raved over it.  Its putting the butter pats under the skin that does it, I think. This is your basic turkey. Nothing fancy or odd about it. Its sure to please!

That was definitely the best turkey that I have ever eaten.  It was the first time I have ever cooked turkey, so I was extremely nervous.  But it turned out perfect.  My husband couldn't believe how tender and moist it was.  This recipe is definitely a keeper

Wonderful!  Very Moist and tender. It fell off the bone easily when carving.  I will use this recipe every time I bake a turkey.

Very tasty and stayed moist around the breast, even though I left it in too long.  The butter in the skin pockets makes a definite difference.

My family loved this! I gave it a 4 because the butter stuffed under the skin of the breast made the meat so moist that everyone thought it was undercooked at first.  I will use this recipe again but with less butter.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey.  I think a temperature of 375 would have been more appropriate, but otherwise it came out deliciously and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This was my first time cooking a turkey and it turned out fantastic! Everyone raved about it and my mom who has been cooking turkeys for 25 yrs. said it was the best turkey she had ever tasted. The meat was really moist and had a great flavor. You didn't even need the gravy to make it more flavorful. The only hitch would could have been my oven was that it took about an hour more to cook than I anticipated. I allotted 5 hrs. but it took about 6. I will definitely be making this my staple turkey recipe.

I love this turkey recipe. The meat is sooo juicy and moist. This is the first recipe that I used for my turkey a few years ago and my first turkey was a big hit in our family. Ever since then I have used this recipe for my turkey. It's the best!

One word: DELICIOUS! I grew up in Michigan, and all of my family lives there now. I have known of some great things to come from that state :), but I've never had a turkey quite like this!  And the gravy was out of this world! I made it in  a bag, and placed some stalks of celery and carrot sticks under the turkey. It was so tender and juicy and both turkey and gravy were the best I can remember ever eating. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

My turkey came out perfect-and it was my first turkey ever! All I did was leave about half the broth out on the side and periodically basted it with the extra. Was very juicy and golden brown!

This year I roasted 2 turkeys - 1 for Thanksgiving feast and 1 for sending home with visiting kids for leftovers.  Both turkeys came out juicy and perfect!! I am not much of a cook so in the past I just bought expensive Butterball brand.  This year I paid $0.68 per pound for store brand turkeys and followed this recipe exactly - it was just like I knew what I was doing.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Absolutely excellent.  This was my first Thanksgiving turkey and it was a hit!  I got the comment "This was the best turkey I've ever had!"  It was so moist and juicy.  I used a 16 1/2 lb turkey so I added a little more of each ingredient.  I will definetly make this again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I used a bigger turkey than the recipe called for so I think I should have added more herbs and spices. It was perfectly brown though and everyone loved it!

This turkey turned out fantastic.  Like other reviewers this was my first time tackling Thanksgiving dinner and this recipe was so simple and turned out perfectly.  I would definitely make this again.  Not only did we have enough for 2 days worth of dinner but we also have enough to make soup.  Wonderful recipe.  Definitely A+!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the directions exactly with perfect results.  Used the tiny bit of broth left in the roaster with the drippings, along with added chicken broth, to make a simple gravy.  Can't wait to eat more leftovers!

This turkey recipe rocks! I have always conceded to using the bag to ensure a moist turkey, never again after discovering this recipe. 
My hubby commented that it was the second best turkey (deep fried was 1st)  he'd ever eaten and the best I'd ever made. I am excited about using this recipe again. 
As with any recipe I made a few alterations I brined it in a citrus recipe on my deck overnight. In Anchorage Alaska the deck makes a nifty fridge. Excellent turkey.

I have used this similar recipie for years.  But instead of bouillion or canned broth, I simmer some turkey legs w/some seasonings a couple days ahead.  Then use that broth for pouring over.   Also insures you have plenty of turkey broth for gravey.     I also always cook turkey in a cooking bag (not paper) and have great results.

I've made this twice now for Thanksgiving and it was amazing was both times.  I swear, it was even better than my mom's turkey...just don't tell her I said that.  I've also cut the recipe in half and roasted a chicken.

This tasted good but it was not as juicy as I had hoped.  Next time, I will try using a roasting bag.  Good enough to try again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews.  I was worried that it would be too salty but it was  not at all.  Stuffed with homemade stuffing and could not ask for a moister turkey.  Put a meat thermometer in and watched till it got to the temperature it was supposed to.  (see photo)  Thanks Robin

This recipe ROCKS!! This was the first turkey I ever cooked and it was so moist it was falling off the bone. I cooked a 17 lb turkey in an oven bag and it only took three hours so definetly go by the oven bag's directions for cooking time if you use a bag. I increased the water and chicken bouillon since my turkey was bigger and I did not need to do that, would have had plenty of broth had I not changed a thing. I also used a whole finely chopped onion because I didnt have dried onion. My mother in law said it was the best turkey she ever had, need I say more? DELICIOUS!!!!
**UPDATE**I have used this recipe several times now and the oven bag is what I have found to be key. Just follow the recipe, stick the turkey in the bag, and you will have the perfect turkey with lots of broth to use for gravy, dressing, or to freeze for later. So easy! To make excellent and easy gravy buy Wondra (in the store close to the flour) and follow the directions on the back of the can. You will have PERFECT, lump-free, delicious, homemade turkey gravy in five minutes.

This year, my husband and I decided to spend Thanksgiving at home and I wanted to try and cook a Thanksgiving dinner for him (I'm European). I chose this recipe because of it's simplicity and rave reviews. Our 10 pounder turned out wonderful! I had trouble moving the turkey from the roasting pan to the platter because the meat was just falling off the bone!  It was awesome .... will definitely be making this again.  My husband has already requested that I make this again.

This was very moist and delicious.  I don't care for turkey because it's always so dry but this wasn't.  I did add more butter under the skin all over the turkey, sprinkled it with onion soup mix some pepper and paprika and some seasoning salt.  I didn't even baste the turkey! I used the foil and removed it 45 min towards the end.  Paprika gave it a pretty red color.

Guido was worried....'Wot, yer not gonna just stuff it in da Nesco like last year?' 'Last year was the Turducken, dear' 'Oh yeah...'
We were shocked and awed that this bird was so flippin good.
Here is what I did: Rinsed the naked birdy, patted dry. Stuffed 1 stick of butter under the skin & a few sage leaves. Tossed a bunch of celery, a cut onion and fresh parsely up in the bird, and sprinkled with a few house seasonings. Minced a real onion and sprinkled on top with real parsley. Followed the recipe the rest of the way- I spritzed some foil with PAM and put it right on the turkey like a bra, plus tented the whole thing. The broth was a bit salty but made kick @ss gravy. We will use this broth/foil method over and over, or as Guido says 'Ova and Ova baby!'
Yes the wings fell off- the legs would have too if I wasn't careful. Meat was so, so, so juicy. I swear-we ate for 4 hours and the bird stayed hot and tenderoo the entire time!

This turkey was great! I can't tell you how long I've looked for the perfect turkey recipe. I did make a few changes, but nothing radical. I used chicken broth instead of boullion and I used fresh onion and parsley (1/4 cup each, plus more in the cavity). This way, not only did I cut back on the sodium, but I didn't have to buy anything special or have anything left over. The turkey was literally falling off the bones!!

Well, unfortunately I can't give this recipe 5 stars like many others.  The turkey was fine and not as dry as some, but I can't say it was the best turkey I've ever had.  It didn't fall of the bone (as some had said) and I didn't really taste the seasonings.  Might try olive oil and fresh herbs recipe next year!!

This is a really great recipe. Been using it for the last few years of turkey roasting. This year, I bought a turkey that came without the temperature indicator "popper" by mistake and I had to estimate the cooking time of my turkey. To be safe, I roasted the turkey for longer than the estimated duration for the turkey size and it still turned out nice and juicy!!

Excellent turkey! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I had to use a little less water because all the broth wouldn't fit in my roaster. I also added a little rosemary. The drippings with a little white wine made the best gravy ever! For the first time though, I didn't HAVE to pour gravy over the turkey, it was delicious enough on it's own. Thank you!

This is awesome!  Just took it out of the oven and we had to sample it.  My brother-in-law said it's quite possibly the moistest turkey he's ever had. My husband (who doesn't like turkey) said it was really good.  My son is raving about it.  I'm going to make gravy out of the broth for the mashed potatoes right now.  Can't wait for supper!  It made a huge amount of broth, so maybe next time I will cut down the water a tad (it filled my roaster up completely), but that's the ONLY thing I would change on this recipe. Thanks, Robin!

WOW! This turkey came out so tender that I didn't even need to carve it off the bone.  The meat just slid right off. I've never seen anything like it.  I used a 10lb turkey and I cooked it first for about 3hrs, 10 min. Then I removed the foil and let it brown for about 35 min. Perfection!!!

I am a vegetarian, therefore I have difficulty preparing meat but since Thanksgiving was at my house this year I had to give it a go.  This recipe was FANTASTIC.  Really easy and everyone loved it.

this was my first year cooking xmas dinner and i always hated having dry turkey so i tried this recipe. my dad is usually in charge of taking the turkey out of the oven on xmas morning and this year was no different. the only problem is that he left it in about 4 hours too long!!! atleast now we know why our turkeys are always so dry. i'm sure this recipe would have been great so i will still give it full ratings and i will make it again only this time i will kick dad out of the kitchen!

This is the first turkey I've ever done completely on my own and it turned out fabulous.  I used canned chicken broth instead of the boullion and it had a wonderful flavor.  The best part was the flavor of the gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! This is my third turkey and everyone raved about this one! It was so moist and flavorful. My turkey was 19- pounds so I added more butter and it was simply perfect. I barely had any leftovers, which is rare! My mom asked for the recipe and she has been using her own recipe for years! I am so glad I found this recipe. This will be the only turkey recipe I use from now on.

This was my first turkey on my own - Celebrating Thanksgiving in Scotland - and this was a big hit with everyone!!  I made up my own seasoning salt (Beau Monde, Bay Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Salt, Crushed Black Pepper, Celery Salt & a few I don't remember the names of) but followed the rest of the directions to a "T"!  This will be my 'regular turkey' recipe for future Turkey Dinners.

i just wanted to say - this was the best recipe for turkey i came across during my search!! my first turkey ever made and it came out flavorful, juicy, moist... my roommates and their significant others were (and still are) raving out our thanksgiving dinner! i actually used a lot more butter than the recipe calls for (fat is flavor!), the pats of butter underneath the skin, and i also rubbed butter all over the turkey. i also stuck sprigs of rosemary into the cavity near the neck area, and stuffed the turkey with cut up oranges and lemons to make the meat more juicy. (it's always safer to make the stuffing seperately - it reduces the chances of food borne illnesses). the only problem i encountered was that the drumsticks ended up being very dry compared to the rest of the turkey - make sure to butter that area well! and of course, the multiple burns inflicted from trying to baste our huge 20 pound turkey every 12 hour. but it just ended up being excellent, i have no qualms about making another turkey next year (or even next week!). except when defrosting - i flooded my whole kitchen from keeping the water running overnight. so, i strongly adivse against it and to do what normal people do by defrosting it in your fridge for a few days. :-)

I'm afraid that my low rating of this recipe was my fault.  I always brine a turkey before roasting and the results using this recipe, even after rinsing the bird well, were far too salty. The turkey was edible, but the gravy couldn't be salvaged. I used a mixture of low sodium chicken broth and low sodium bouillon for the liquid and cut the seaoning salt in half. So, choose between this recipe or the moisture and depth of flavor that you get from a brined bird.

I found this recipe a few yrs back, & been making it ever since.  I stuffed a larger bird w/ basic stuffing, adjusted the cooking time & it works great!  I combine the spices/ broth the night prior, making it easier to throw together in the am. YUM!

I've been making turkey this way for 2 years now and EVERYONE loves it. The only change I make is to decrease the broth to 1 1/2 cups. That way I get those crusty bits on the bottom of the pan which is so essential to a good gravy.

This is a definite homerun.  I followed the recipe as is except I used a 4-5 pound turkey breast.  The flavor is outstanding and the leftover turkey sandwiches are incredible because the flavor gets better.  No more salt/pepper/butter turkeys for us.  My husband says this is the best turkey he's ever had.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Loved it!  I added some poultry seasoning, onion powder, and rosemary to the butter prior to stuffing under the skin, very good.  I think the next time however, I'll cut back on the water at least one cup.  Really didn't need that much.  Very tasty and juicy bird.

Turned out very well for my first try! I used a cooking bag and halved the liquid. Tried to make the good gravy everybody else talked about, but I must not know the trick. Still not as good as my Mom's, but she spent many more hours than I did! ;) Super easy and turns out very moist! 15lb turkey cooked for 3.5 hours.

I'm giving this 4 stars because everyone else liked it.  I didn't think it was that great.  It tasted like plain, old turkey.  It was definitely moist though and easy.  I used an 11 lb. turkey and cooked it in my Nesco.  It took about 1 hr. and 45 min.  I may make this again since everyone else liked it but I'm not sure.

This was really good and I added a few things.
Rosemary, garlic and black pepper.  I did not have seasoning salt.  I also cut up 1 lemon, 1 orange and put it inside the turkey.  This is the secret to keeping the bird moist and it worked!

I have made my share of turkeys, and this was the EASIEST and tastiest bird ever!  I made a 25lb stuffed bird, popped it in at 5:00AM, checked it at 8:00 to baste, and then did not baste again until 10:00 AM.  By 10:30 it was done and falling off the bone!  I cooked it at 350* and my family raved over it.  It makes wonderful leftovers and I plan on using this recipe over and over again. Thank you, Robin!

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving for two years and it has received rave reviews.  Its very simple but quite flavorful.  Instead of bullion, I used 1 can of broth plus 1 can of water.  This recipe also produces really good gravy stock.

Great tasting, juicy, although simple turkey.  If you're into elaborate things, this may be to "plain" for you.  The drippings from this turkey made EXCELLENT gravy!..  Thanks Michiganders for making my first turkey a hit!

This recipe is quick, easy, and tasty.  I agree with the others on the cooking time.  I think that 4 to 5 hrs. is way too long.

Hosting our very first Thanksgiving for 12 people, I was really nervous about preparing the turkey, but to my surprise, it came out really juicy and tender.  Definitely a recipe I would use for future Thanksgivings since it was so easy and quick to prepare.

This recipe is amazing.  It only took my about 10 minutes to prepare and was so easy. Makes excellent gravy too. This was the best turkey I ever made for Thanksgiving.

This made a lovely turkey!  I basted it every hour though, to insure juiciness :-)!

I am happy to report that my turkey came out absolutly perfect.  It was moist, which is a first for me.  Also, the gravy was the best I ever made.  I just don't believe it.  With all the great recipes I get from this web site I feel like Julia Childs.

I took a chance and tried something new for last year's Thanksgiving festivities -- that being this recipe!  It was easy to follow and the end result satisfied everyone.  Definitely one I'll be making again (p.s.  I'm a former Michigander now living in Texas -- even the Southerners liked this one!)

This recipe should be called 'Juiciest Tastiest Turkey Ever' because that's exactly what it was! This was my first time making a turkey and it turned out excellent. I stuck a stick of butter in the turkey as well to make it extra juicy.  Amazing!

I tried this for my Thanksgiving turkey this year and it was great!  I loved that I put it in the oven and didn't have to keep opening the oven to baste it.  Once I took off the foil, I did baste it a few times.  My turkey was just over 18 lb, and it was done in 4.5 hours.  Next time, I'll check the temperature a little bit sooner because I think the white meat was little bit drier than it was supposed to be.  Everyone loved it!  I used one of the recommendations to put lemon and onion quarters inside the cavity.  I will definitely use this recipe again next year!

My family doesn't really care for Turkey but my son won a turkey from school so i decided to try this recipe. I've always been intimidated to roast a turkey due to all the horror stories I've heard about it quickly drying out.  I did everything just like the recipe asks with the exception of adding extra pats off butter between the wings and body, as well as Between the legs and body and rub butter all over the outside of the bird.  After covering with foil i left it alone, did not baste it at all.  When i took it out of the oven, it was a beautiful golden brown.  When i  tried to take it  out out the roasting pan, the meat started falling straight off the bones!!! It smelled amazing and was incredibly juicy!!  My husband who hates Turkey had three servings. At the end of the night, he said he couldn't wait to wake up in the morning so he could eat more Turkey!! Did i mention the turkey was still partially frozen when i placed it in the oven? We didn't even is the gravy i bought. The drippings were a perfect coating on the meat. Can't express how impressed i was with the results of this recipe. I wish i could give this recipe a MILLION STAR RATING.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us

This is by far the easiest and juiciest turkey I have made. Used fresh sage and rosemary with butter under the breast and in the cavity. I couldn’t stop eating it!! 20min per pound at 325 is key.

I have been making this recipe for over 12 years now,  for Thanksgiving, Christmas and sometimes Easter, and i keep getting rave reviews. I haven't changed a thing, except for the size of the turkey (and added cooking time) depending on the number of people expected for the meal! Simply good and easy, and since my investment in a huge covered roasting pan 10 years ago, I don't even baste the turkey until I uncover it to finish the browning.

I sent my husband to the grocery for "turkey breast"... He brings back a 16 pound turkey... yeah, I know. Found this jewel of a recipe and with the addition of a roasting bag BEST TURKEY EVER!!! Had some friends over for a spaghetti dinner tonight and just happened to be roasting the turkey (no room in freezer). They stayed late for the most moist, flavorful turkey any of us has EVER had. It was annoying (almost) how it melted away from the bone as I tried to carve correctly, but it melted in the mouth beautifully, so.. forgivin :-) I'll never bother with ANY other way. Thank you so much for this addition to family tradition.

I loved this recipe! This was the first turkey I baked and I was concerned how everything was going to turn out, but the turkey came out perfect. The turkey was not dry at all and it had a very good taste.  This recipe is easy to  do and it comes out just the way you want it. My family loved the turkey. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Got great reviews, it smelled heavenly while roasting and cut up beautifully.  I basted 3-4 times with the liquid/butter - I didn't have ACTUAL butter so used the margarine/spread substitute which I'm sure wasn't as tasty.  Overall a great recipe, I would definitely make again!

Made this turkey today. There was way too much liquid even though the turkey was tender I will not use this recipe again.  You'd be better off just cooking it in a turkey sized cooking bag, following the instructions on the box. My bird was not quite a 12 lb turkey and it was overdone within 4 hours. If I try it again I will put maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 inch of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan.

My turkey was only 10lbs so I adjusted the recipe.  Only cooked 2 hrs covered and then 30mins uncovered.  I've always cooked my turkeys foiled but wanted to try this one with the different seasonings.  Very nice.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was that I believe the recipe calls for the turkey to be uncovered to long.  I was wondering why so many were talking about basting now I know. I would cook longer covered and then just uncover just long enough to brown, no basting required.  Having to keep opening the oven door lets too much hot air out.  Oh, I also sliced up an onion, put half on the bottom(turkey on top) and the other half inside the turkey.

I was nervous about roasting a turkey for the first time, and chose this recipe because it seemed relatively easy. It turned out great! The meat came out nice and juicy, even the parts that normally get dry. Next time I might look up some ways to add a little more flavor, but I'll definitely use this base recipe again!

Did not cover with foil, instead just used lid of my roaster pan. Was delicious. Next time I need to check it at the minimum time.

This recipe was amazing!  My turkey was so moist and so flavorful.  Be sure to baste the turkey frequently.  It does also brown up quickly but it makes for a crisp outside and very moist, flavorful inside.  I had many compliments at my Thanksgiving dinner on this recipe.

I had over 25 family members home for an early Thanksgiving meal and the turkey was inhaled! Lol! Everyone raved about the taste and how moist and tender it was. The only change was that I added a few sprinkles of garlic powder with the other spices. Even my daughter who doesn't like turkey said it was "amazing!". Thank you for sharing the recipe. No more searching for a turkey recipe!,, oh! And my mom made gravy with some of the stock and we only added pepper. It had the perfect amount of saltiness.

Hands down the best turkey I have made. Or, should I say the only turkey I will make.  Being first generation Chinese-American, Thanksgiving was never a thing for us, much less learning how to make a Turkey.  My mom made a turkey eon ago; we were stuck with dry turkey meat for weeks.  It wasn't until a couple of years ago I attempt to make a turkey myself.  Thanks to this recipe, a new Thanksgiving tradition is born.  This turkey is so juicy and delicious, just like how real turkey should taste.  I can't believe we have missed out on turkey all these years.  We have to increase the size of our turkey every year just so that we would have enough leftovers.  Our family from oversea insisted they would never liked turkey was immediately converted once they tasted it, commenting how they never had a turkey this moist.  I pretty much stay true to the recipe, except tying the bird down so that it would cook more evenly and putting extra foil on the legs (a trick from food network).  I also baste the turkey here and there during baking when I remember to.

This is a great recipe and produces a very juicy bird.  Also works well to substitute two chickens for the turkey.

I was looking for a different way to make our turkey this Thanksgiving and this was a very tasty recipe. I am on a very low sodium diet, I used 2 cups water with 1 Gobio sodium free bouillon cube and I skipped the seasoning salt. I also only used 2 tbsps unsalted butter melted and added poultry seasoning and my salt free Cajun seasoning with the other spices, after I rubbed it under the skin, I rubbed the whole turkey on the outside as well. 3 hours and 10 minutes was perfect in my oven, great tasting gravy as well.

So I think this is a pretty fail-proof recipe.  I did not have any bouillon cubes so I took the chicken seasoning out of two ramen noodle packs.  No season salt, no onion, no parsley.  Did four tablespoons of button instead of six.  Cooked for two hours covered and then about an hour uncovered.  The result: the best turkey I've ever had -- and my fiancé and future in-laws agree!  I am NOT a cook and pulled it off to perfection.  Don't hesitate on this recipe!

Very easy to follow, and made the Turkey very moist and savory.
I was out of the dried minced onion, so i substituted it with a teaspoon of powered garlic

I tried this recipe for the first time this thanksgiving- I put celery stalks,onions,and garlic with the butter mixture in the cavity with the rest of the seasonings and butter in the skin. I also added 2 cloves of garlic- one in the cavity, the other with the seasonings on the turkey, with the chicken stock. The cooking was difficult, it cooked quicker than I thought- I put the thermometer in the bird itself instead of the thigh. Every 30 minutes, I would pour the juice in the pan, on top of the turkey. Everyone loved it!!! It was very juicy and tender. The turkey juice was delicious!! Will definitely use this recipe again! :)

The butter saved my turkey!  I used a roaster for the baking and that really made it cook a lot faster.  13.5 lb turkey was done done in 2.25 hours.  The meat was split from the legs!  Luckily all that butter kept the breast area tender.  I used 4 cups chicken broth, poultry seasoning and parsley flakes.  Had roaster at 350.  Next time will roast at 325 as roaster instructions indicated.  This is an excellent recipe and will use again!

This recipe does not call for basting, but I basted the turkey every half hour for the last two hours. I also used about one and a quarter sticks of butter. The chicken boullion -  I used a full box (8 packets). I added one full chopped onion in the center and crushed garlic. Make sure you put the foil over the turkey, but try not to let it touch the turkey in too many areas.
I cooked the Turkey for 5 hours at 350 degrees Farenheit (180 celcius) for a 17lb turkey. Tasted moist, but I think it could have used the full amount of season salt, I just sprinkled a small amount on top.

I am fifteen and I live in Mexico. I begged my mom this year if she would please let me fix a thanksgiving dinner. She let me, and i spent a week searching for just the right recipes. I came upon this recipe, and imediatley liked it for it's simplicity ( and it had ingredients i could actually get or find here), besides it had rave reviews. It seemed like it made the most delicious turkey on earth, and the juiciest according to the reviews. I have to say I am VERY disappointed!!!! with the actual results. I did everything, following sugestions given in the reviews, and i even brined it overnight. I was so hopeing for it to come out juicy. I basted it, and did not overcook it. When i took it out of the oven it looked soooo juicy and flavorful. And there were plenty of pan dripings. Sorry to say it waas tasteless and so dry!!!! i don't what i did wrong!!!! :'( i was/am soooooo disappointed.

This turned out great! I added some salt/pepper in the cavity, as well as part of an onion and lemon. I added garlic powder to the spices too. It turned out great and took around 3 hours.

We had two Thanksgiving dinners with our families this year.  I used this recipe for the first dinner, and it was SO wonderful, my wife insisted I use it for the second dinner, as well. The turkey was falling off the bone, it was so tender and moist.  Our daughter in law insisted I send her the recipe.  I have never had a turkey turn out so delicious!!

This was a good confidence booster in my ability to cook a turkey, but it was ultimately not what I was hoping it would be. It took a lot longer than I expected for the bird to reach 180. By then, the breast meat was less moist than I had thought it would be, based on the reviews. Tenderness/moistness was OK, just not what it seemed like others got. The flavor was fine but a little on the bland side for me. I was surprised how much of the broth evaporated from the bottom of the pan... there was some scrounging about to make gravy. I appreciate the simplicity of this recipe and the fact that I always have all ingredients on hand, but this wasn't the best match for us.

Very juicy meat! And very simple! However I believe the oven temp should be raised a bit and the cook time extended. Found some deep meat that looked slightly undercooked! And that was after 3 hours of cooking a five pound bird!

I found this recipe last year for my first ever time cooking a turkey. I was really worried the bird would turn out dry. While cooking, I basted the turkey a few times to make sure it didn't dry out. I stuffed the turkey with celery, potatoes, and carrots for some extra flavor, and boy did they make it taste great. The turkey turned out perfectly moist and so incredibly tasty. This is by far the best turkey recipe ever.

Wow!  I am amazed at how good this is.  I accidentally put the salt in the liquid first, but put another 2 T. on top.  It is just right!  I've made lots of turkeys; some have been good and some have been dry.  This has to be the best turkey I've ever made.  I even used a store brand turkey.

This was my 1st time cooking a turkey and this was great!  Thankfully, it was not Thanksgiving.  I rant into a few problems such as not enough bouillion so I just added a little bit of salt.  I heeded some warnings about the cook time and I had a 12 pound turkey so I cooked it for 2 hours and then checked it and it was close.  The last half an hour, I took off the foil and turned it down a bit.  We had a slight catastrophe - our refrigerator broke and I got sidetracked moving food to another freezer.  Surprisingly, an hour later - we still had a moist turkey!  The recipe is foolproof - but do watch the time.  My 12 pounder was done in 4 hours total and the last hour I turned it down to 300 degrees.  Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is truly delicious, and will be used by me for a long time. If you can just have one piece - I feel sorry for you. :) In my family this turkey has the 'some more' taste. "I'm going to have some more!"

The best.  I left out the seasoning salt because my broth was salted enough.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and that was the first year that we had no Turkey left overs! The only thing left was the carcas I was amazed. I'm using it again this year and I had a family member ask me if I would season their Turkey.

I followed another review and used the apple brine for turkey night before cooking recipe as well. It is amazing! I've cooked the turkey 2 years in a row this way and my whole family expects me to be the one cook the turkey from now on.

I used this recipe when hosting xmas dinner for the first time. turned out great! Definitely do not uncover the turkey until you are close to done as it will start to brown very quickly!  this will be my go-to going forward.

I wish I could give this 3.5 stars. It was good, but could've been more flavorful. I'll add much more seasoning next time.

This is hands down the easiest recipe I have ever seen, and with the best results! Even my children ate the turkey, my guests said it was excellent, and it was my first time making turkey for Thanksgiving. I will be cooking it again and again - even not in holiday season. Leftover meat makes for great casserole.

Awesome.  Didn't have time to make the butter pockets, but the turkey was brined anyway, so it was plenty moist.  Great flavors.

I just made this for Christmas dinner. I got my turkey breast to 170 degrees. I have never had such moist turkey before this. Even non-turkey lovers were fighting over this turkey. Thank you so much for the recipe.

My 1st time cooking a turkey and I did not even use stuffing and the turkey was delicious. I took some to work and my coworker even asked how did I get it so moist. I put a lot of butter between the breast & skin of the turkey. Instead of minced onion I used onion and garlic powder, seasoning & parsley all over the top & sides of the turkey while the chicken broth was in the bottom of the pan and occasionally baste the turkey but kept the turkey covered the entire cooking time and the turkey was a golden brown.

This was my first attempt at cooking a turkey. For Thanksgiving, I buttered and basted for several hours and my turkey came out amazing.  Very moist and tender.  I used a meat thermometer and removed from the oven at 165 degrees.  The turkey was done perfectly and we ate it all over the next few days.

GREAT Turkey recipe!!! Just like all the others that used this recipe, I got rave reviews from what usually are "over critical" family members. I used the suggestion of adding garlic powder to the bouillon mixture and also used more butter under the skin and rubbed the whole turkey with a stick of butter as well. I was very pleased with the results. I also let the turkey bake with out foil the first two hours, and then tented the foil over top for the remaining time. The only difficult part for me was figuring out how to seperate the skin from the breast to make pockets for the butter, but once I got my hand in between the layers, I just kept pushing through. All I can say is THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for this recipe.

This was an excellent turkey recipe! I normally bake my turkey in a paper bag, that I have to search for from store to store every holiday. It always made the most moist turkey, until I just found this recipe! I am from MI and have never had a turkey with these exact seasoning or broth. I did use a salt free broth powder and salt free butter, but my gravy was still a little salty from the season salt. But, the turkey was tender & good so it did not matter. :)

Love the recipe. I didn't do the butter in the skin pocket thing because I didn't want the skin to fall back the way the other photos showed. FYI the turkey came out juicy-sooo juicy as long as you keep basting it. I definitely like the rub to put on top-gave a great flavor to it.

Used your recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a Huge Hit!!! Best we have made. Followed the recipe exactly except we put it on 2 turkey breasts and cooked them in the oven bags. It was the moistest white meat we have ever had, and everyone loved the flavor. Thank you so much for sharing this!

I used the spice rub from the Juicy Thanksgiving Turkey recipe from this site and stuffed the turkey with vegetables and an orange.  Then I used the buttered breast and broth recipe from this recipe.  Together they made a great pairing.

This was my first time cooking a turkey, and it turned out wonderfully! The skin got nice and brown and the meat was tender and moist. I added a few more spices but it still didnt have the punch I was looking for so I will try to improve on this next year. Overall though this is a great recipe, very simple yet tasty.

Thanks for the amazing turkey on Thanksgiving. I brined it for 2 days then rinsed it and stuffed it with onions and celery and garlic, made the seasonings and chicken bouillon and poured it inside and out (omitting the salt because of the brining). Injected some butter into the meat and it came out amazing. Last 45 minutes of cooking I removed the foil to allow it to brown.

The best turkey I have ever made.  Used a 16.5 lb bird and the butter under the skin plus broth and herbs over the bird. Basted ever hour in a 350 degree oven covered in foil. Juicy and tasty.

Tried this yesterday.  The gravy lovers seemed to like it but I thought it was dry without gravy.

firstly i made this for my first ever thanksgiving for my parents and newly appointed in-laws. i used a 12 lb butterball turkey. followed the recipe exactly except i added a quartered lemon, onion and a couple cloves of garlic to the cavity and 4 tb of butter in the interior of each side of the skin plus a big sprig of rosemary in each side.. used all FRESH herbs, remember to double them. poured a 1/3 c butter over the whole turkey before the chicken bouillon mixture, liberally sprinked PENZEYS seasoning salt over the whole bird.. underneath the roasting pan i cut up 4 stalks celery, half an onion, 4 big carrots, a bay leaf and fresh thyme for veryyy flavorful stock/drippings to make gravy with. gave me 3 cups stock after 4 hrs cooking (beautiful golden bird btw) added 2 more cups chicken stock and made the easy turkey gravy from this site... my husband said he has never tasted such a juicy turkey, my mom said it was absolutely perfect. gorgeous food network quality. will never make anything different.

This recipe was okay...the turkey turned out well but honestly you can get a delicious turkey for even less effort. I just feel that it wasn't special/tasy enough to bother with the extras. It was tender though...

Best turkey? Moistest breasts? Cook with the BREAST side DOWN ---- then ALL the JUICES are IN THE BREAST!!  You do NOT get as much gravey, but it is worth it. Just have can of turkey broth around and you are set!!

This was so delicious and moist the meat was falling off the bone. I did it on a rack and the bottom side was a little softer because it had more contact with the steaming process, but that was the only downfall if that?

Wonderful recipe! Last thanksgiving my mend went blank on how I cooked my turkey the previous years....Thank goodness for this recipe. I did also use a flavor injector, melted butter and added some seasonings to that as well and injected the meat all over for a juicy, delicious turkey!

Turkey in July was a huge hit at our house this summer.  I used this recipe twice and loved it both times.  Very tender moist breast and crunchy skin too.  Thanks for the hints!

Had a 16 lb. frozen turkey I needed to prepare.  Basically used the amounts called for a 12lb. turkey in recipe (and half the liquid amount)---and still came out SOOOOO moist & tasty.  I even over-baked the turkey by accident & it was still so moist.  A keeper!

This recipes was delicious! My turkey was moist and we didn't have leftovers. This was my first turkey and now this will be my recipe. I didn't have the spices that the recipe called for so I used Mrs. Dash original, chopped onions, season salt, also I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I used chicken stock and added warm water. It was done 3.45 hrs later. thanks!!

OMG, I had my very first go ever at a turkey this year, and I used this recipe. EVERYONE LOVED IT!! And no one believed it was my first turkey ever!!   I did butter the heck out of the bird, both under the breast, legs/thighs, and on the skin too.   I used a 15lb. turkey and cooked it for 4hrs and 20 min. at 350 degrees. It still had not reached 180 so I raised the temp to 375 degrees and cooked it for an additional 35 min, then it reached 180.  I then removed the foil, and turned temp back down to 350 degrees and let it cook for 20min which browned it perfectly!   Next time, if I use a 15lb bird, I'll cook it at 350 for 5 and a half hours, or 375 for 3 and a half hours. I'll still have to check the internal temp. I was in a hurry this year, so I didn't have 5.5 hours to cook it in.   One other thing I did is add a bit extra amounts to the ingredients to compensate for a bigger bird. For instance, instead of 4 cups of water, I used 4.5 cups. And instead of 3 tbsp of bouillon, I used 4 tbsp. etc. etc.   I did baste several times throughout but I think it still would've been fine even without the basting.   BEST TURKEY RECIPE EVER!!!

Easy to make and very tender and tasty!   I made sure to use a meat thermometer and took out as soon as it hit 180 degrees as to not overcook it!  Everyone loved it.  Made exactly as the recipe stated.

Wow - I made this turkey for Christmas dinner and it was fantastic - received rave reviews from all!  I followed the recipe exactly and not only was the turkey moist and delicous - the gravy was absolutely fantastic.  If I'm roasting a turkey, this is the only way I will make it!

Yes, this sounds very basic, but the results are fantastic.  Very moist turkey with a really nice, traditional flavor.  You won't be disappointed.

My children are not fans of Turkey but my mother is.  This year I decided to cook a Turkey just for my mom.  I have to say, this turned out FANTASTIC.  My kids were fighting over the drumsticks!  Will definitely make this again!

I made this in an oven bag but otherwise followed it exactly.  My 14 pound turkey cooked in 2 hours!  Was not expecting it to cook so quickly so I didn't check it until around 2 1/2 hours, the turkey button had popped, and the meat thermometer read around 185.  It had been done for quite a while and was a bit dry.

This was the best turkey I've ever roasted.  It wasn't the prettiest bird because the skin pulled away where I cut it.  Who cares, I'm not cooking for a state dinner here, and I've never had breast meat come out so juicy and flavorful!  And I used a cheap store brand turkey.  Won't roast turkey any other way.

Awesome turkey...I'm from Michigan and this is always how I've done it.  I'd recommend cutting the water (or stock which is what I used) in half.  Too much liquid ends up in the bottom of the pan if you don't.

Great tasting turkey! It was a hit for this Thanksgiving. I have to say though that it cooked rather fast. I used a 12 pounder in a roasting pan with 4 cups chicken stock and covered with foil. The meat was falling off the bone at the 3 hr. mark with an internal temp of 190 degrees. Had to uncover for it to brown and sprinted to get the other fixings ready. Even after leaving the turkey in the oven (at 300) until the fixings were finished, it was still pretty moist.

Move over ladies, I'm jumpin on the band wagon!   Thanks to this recipe I'm a turkey roastin' pro. My father was skeptical about me hosting Thanksgiving this year and he cracked TONS of turkey disaster jokes all week. But yesterday he had nothing to say except "pass me just a little bit more turkey please" and he said this about 4 times.   JUICY, TENDER, FLAVORFUL, and lovely....  Here's what  I did: After washing it, and brining (kosher salt/brown sugar mix for 6 hours), I was GENEROUS with the buttering. I mixed rosemary, basil, and thyme with a stick of soft butter and then shoved most of it under the skin, all on top and around the breast area. TRUST ME if i can do this so can you. It was practically comical and i'm glad no one was watching because I didn' t have a clue!  I used any remainder of the butter mix and rubbed it all over the outside of the bird. I didn't have any poultry seasoning so i used oregano, italian seasoning mix, a small layer of salt and pepper and sage, along with the minced onions. I had a 16 pound bird so 4 full hours of roasting with foil and 5 minutes broiling for the browning of the bird. I never once opened the oven during the entire 4 hours. Because it was COVERED, it was extremely juicy and made a LOT of broth which i removed just before broiling it.   Best turkey i've tasted!

This was my first turkey ever and it was a hit with my family with no leftovers.  I did add other herbs like oregano and basil to rub all over the turkey and under the skin for extra flavor, I did not use parsley. I did not use seasoning salt since I brined the turkey with "Out of this World Turkey Brine" from this website.  I didn't want the turkey to turn out too salty.  But I did use a full stick of butter and placed it under the skin everywhere.  The turkey turned out moist and flavorful.  Because of brine I think the cooking time was off.  My 12.5 lb turkey was done in 2 hours.  Make sure you use a thermometer to check the internal temperature so you don't get dry turkey breasts.  And don't throw away the turkey "juice" that's on the bottom of the pan.  Strain the juice and place in a saucepan.  Add 1 cup milk, boil then add 1/4 cup of flour to thicken. It makes a great gravy.  Will probably make again for X-mas!

ok, so I made this tonight for our turkey dinner and I had 12 guest. WOW, it was a hit!!! so, so, sooooo juicy! I had a 26 pound turkey (yes, I wanted major leftovers :) ), so I doubled the seasoning. But considering I woke up at 4am and still needed to find a recipe that I already had everything for, I just skimmed through it while reading, Anyways, I thought it said to combine all the seasonings together and sprinkle the turkey. So I doubled everything and totally forgot the warm water step! I just added the boullion with the rest of the spices. Also, I didn't even just sprinkle with the seasoning salt, I added that to the all the spices. Covered the whole thing in a TON of butter, plus under the skin, then placed onion wedges (a whole white onion) and about 10 cloves of garlic. SO VERY YUMMY!!! Super easy and even better tasting!! Thanks so much Robin C., you helped make my Thanksgiving PERFECT!

This is the second year my husband and I have used this recipe, and it is THE BEST! The turkey came out wonderful. Juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly. I even messed ours up a little this year (I threw the seasoned salt in with the water and other seasonings) and everyone was wowed. We will be using this recipe for years to come.

I've made this turkey every year for the past 3 years, it's awesome.  A couple of things I do different - I use a reynolds roasting bag, use chicken broth instead of water, and use a meat thermometer to tell when it's done because it cooks faster in the bag.  I also sprinkle poultrey seasoning along with the seasoning salt.  Mine is usually done in 2 1/2 hours and comes out really moist everytime.

I made this a few years ago, but didn't rate it.  Made two turkeys this year and it was great!  The first time I was told to leave the turkey in too long and it dried out.  This time I got the turkeys out just in time and it stayed moist and yummy!

I usually cook my turkey's in a baking bag but wanted to try something different this time. I was curious how it would be with out the bag. I have never made a dry turkey. Until today. Sorry but I think I will stick with the bag.

I also rubbed the bird with butter, outside and cavity.  Also put some of the broth mix in the cavity too! It was so juicy and tasty.  It also smelled like heaven and when my hubby came home from work he said 'dinner smells great, when do we eat'! YUMMY!

The way Thanksgiving turkey should taste! It's super easy to make and wonderful to eat. The butter under ths skin on the breast is fantasic, I normally do not like breast meat - but this was outstanding.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, my days of brining and preparing a much more complex recipe are over!

this is the first turkey i ever made. (i've made large roaster chickens before though.) the butter under the skin technique made VERY nice breast meat. i also added a quartered lemon and fresh rosemary and thyme to the cavity. the smell in my house was amazing. instead of seasoning salt i used old bay and pepper. the broth made amazing gravy. thanks for helping me make a nice birthday dinner for my husband's party!

This was my first time cooking turkey, and I am so happy that I chose to use this recipe.  The only thing that I altered was the cooking time.  As I was using a 10lb turkey, it only needed about 3 1/2 hours.  I covered the turkey for the first 2 hours and 45 minutes and left it uncovered for the rest of the cooking time.

Thanks Robin for giving us THE way to do turkey from here on out at our house.  We cooked a 14-pound turkey and pretty much followed the directions, added butter, used about a cup of chicken broth instead of water and bouillion, and added garlic salt. We also put an apple inside the turkey after reading somewhere that this helped keep the meat moist.  Delicious! The meat was so moist, carving was not an issue since the turkey laid down and gave up on the platter right then.

Easy, moist and good.  I used organic chicken broth, fresh parsley and onions.  Rather than discard the giblets, I simmer them in water with some onion, celery leaves, carrot, salt/pepper and use the resulting broth to moisten my dressing.  (Do not include the liver.)

Ok you got me, this is super easy and marvelous! I mad my first turkey ever yesterday for christmas eve and it was the hit of dinner. There were no leftovers! Except I only used 3 cups of water instead of 4, the pictures seemed to look very wet. And next time I may use even less. For special dietary needs I used fake butter. Oh yeah, the gravy made from the juices was the best ever! Not only did I make this awesome Turkey, but I use the recipe for cornish game hens too.

I made this as my first turkey, and it turned out great! Everyone wants to come to my house from now on because the turkey was so good. I didn't change a thing from the original, and it was so juicy it just fell right off the bone when we tried to pick it up.

The turkey tasted good - lots of good broth to make a gravy.  I wish that the skin on the turkey was more brown, I guess I should have removed the foil for the last hour or so.  I might just stick to traditional roasting methods in the future.

I've made this recipe 3 years in a row now and I have to say it is EASY and DELICIOUS!!  Like other reviewers mentioned, the baking time does not require 4-5 hours.  I used a 15 pound turkey and still only baked it for a little more than 3 hours.  My process was slightly different though - I put my turkey in a turkey bag then poured the chicken broth and seasonings over the turkey.  Because my turkey is bigger than the one this recipe calls for, I added an extra cup of chicken broth, and an extra tablespoon of all the seasonings.  Then I covered the bag with foil and baked it.  When my turkey baked for 2.5 hours, I took it out of the oven, took off the foil and cut open the bag, then baked the remaining turkey for another 45 minutes to brown the outside skin.  The end result was a perfectly moist, well seasoned, and flavorful bird.  I will use this simple recipe for all future holiday meals!!  No brining or basting required.

My turkey looked so pretty. I stuffed it with the cranberry and apple stuffing that I received off this website. The whole family loved it!

Yes, it's a 5!!  Used Turkey stock instead of water and turkey took the entire amount of time, so not a quick one.  Meat was juicy and tender, we ate turkey for 5 days, first time we've ever finished the entire bird!

This is the second time I made a Turkey for Thanksgiving and first time with this recipe.  This was fantastic.  I had a 13 lb bird, which took almost 4 hours.  I didn't even get the lid off before it was done, but it still browned.  I used Tony Sachere's (cajun seasoning) in place of the regular season salt.  Everything else I did exactly as it said.  So much juice in the bottom of the roaster with which to make gravy.  I got a lot of compliments.  Would have been even more juicy if it didn't overcook a little and have to sit there for an hour before we were ready for it.

The turkey was delicious, but be warned that if you try to use the drippings for gravy it will be super salty because of all the seasoning salt.

This was really quite good.  I would have given five stars, but the skin didn't crisp up.  Followed directions as written.  Turkey was done before time also, and I thought I over cooked, but it was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever made.  Will definitely make again, and will try with chicken too.

I did vary this a touch, by cooking it in a oven bag - omitting the salt, putting quartered lemon and onion in the cavity, and pouring some of the bouillon (with garlic in it) inside the cavity, as well.  I apparently overcooked the 22 lb'er, as it was registering over 200 degrees on the thermometer and it was pretty dry in spots.  The juicy meat was glorious, so I'll try this one again!

Excellent.  First time ever making a turkey.  Came out perfectly.  Recipe is simple enough, there were very few ingredients.  I even made gravy from the stock.  One twist though, I purposely baked the turkey upside down so that the breast meat would remain tender.

I must be the worlds worst cook according to the other reviews. I thought this would be fail-proof! I followed the directions exactly.  I was underwhelmed and disappointed.  It was very salty and the meat did not "fall off the bone," like others said.  I've had better luck with just cooking it in a bag....sorry!!!  It must be something I did wrong.

This recipe makes great turkey, and is very easy - I made it last year when I was sick and not up for fussing over a turkey for three hours, so I basically just stuck it in the oven and it came out great.  I was, however, disappointed in the gravy.  I thickened the cooking liquid and it was okay, but I really like richer pan gravy better.  If you're a big gravy lover like me, you may be disappointed, but if you're more interested in an easy, great tasting bird this is a great recipe.

This was my first time cooking a turkey so I was very worried about how it would turn out. I placed some sprigs of rosemary between the skin and the breast too. Everyone raved about how juicy it turned out!

Fabulous, made this for our thanksgiving dinner here in Canada. I used extra butter and shoved it everywhere under the skin. Turkey was juicy & very flavourful. Gravy was excellent too!

The gravy made from the juices of this was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  I didn't have to add any additional salt or broth.  This is now a staple in our house for any turkey dinner.  Thank you for sharing.

Five stars for ease of preparation.  The bird's in the oven as I type.  Thought I'd review this recipe starting from the very beginning.  So far, I'm liking it a lot.  I have a 10 pound turkey.  The recipe is very easy to follow and to prepare.  I'm using real butter, not margarine and cut it up into smallish cubes.  I've actually put about 4 tbsp under the skin of each side.  I only had two bouillon cubes and dissolved in 3 cups water.  I also didn't have parsley so am using summer savory and added 2 tbsp garlic powder. I cut up a medium-smallish onion in a small dice as I didn't have minced onion and added that to the liquid mixture. I poured it all over the turkey and then sprinkled 2 tbsp of a kosher salt substitute from a bulk store.  I covered the roaster pan with the lid and not using foil.  The oven is set at 375 and I'll turn it back to 350 after an hour.  So now I wait - it's starting to smell good already!

I swear by this recipe!  I have used it three times and it has turned out perfectly every time.  I am by no means a great cook, but ANYONE can pull this one off.  
This will be the recipe I pass on to my daughter.
Thank you!

I never cook, but we had a turkey in the freezer and well... I had my entire family over just because. I added the carrots, celery and apple into the cavity and as a base from the other suggestions. Everything else I followed. Unfortunetly, 5 hours was not enough time. I cooked it at 350 for 5 hours, then turned up the heat to 425 for 2 more hours.My bird was 20lbs. I was worried it would dry out with the higher temp, but I had 18 people to feed. It was perfect!! I have now been designated the new turkey maker!! (and everyone always picks on me for my lack of culinary skill) Make sure you have enough time though.

This turned out well.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I also loosely stuffed the bird with herbs:  Parsley, Sage, Thyme, and Rosemary.

Everyone loved the bird and the gravy made by the drippings was wonderfully flavorful (though a little salty).  When I make again I will use a little less seasoning salt and perhaps sodium free bullion.

Didn't take much extra time and added some flavor.  Will make again for sure.

Absolutely perfect.  Suppose you can season to taste...but the trick with the butter will make the breast as moist as it can be.  Rave reviews from everyone that ate it.

I used a syringe and injected the turkey all over; I have NEVER had a turkey turn out SO moist.  This will definitely be repeated next year.  Even worked when I make a turkey breast in the crockpot for Christmas.

This was my first year doing Christmas Dinner, and I think that this was the best turkey I've ever had.  I had a 16.7 lb unstuffed turkey and it cooked in 3 1/2 hours.  I think this is how I'll always cook the turkey.  The gravy also turned out amazing!

Use this every  year and every year we have a great turkey! I like putting a quartered onion, couple of carrots, celery stalk and a quartered orange in the cavity of the turkey also.

I will join the throngs and say with the rest that this was the most lovely, moist, flavorful turkey ever. I can't imagine ever, ever changing my turkey recipe after this. This was even better than the maple turkey recipe on this site. Thanks for a great Christmas turkey this year.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I chose not to follow it as written. I tried it mainly because I had never heard of lifting the skin and putting butter in there. So I lifted the skin put in 2 pats on each breast used others advice and used toothpicks to hold the skin back down, put a pat inside with sea salt, pepper and poultry spice, and then mix up 1 stick of melted butter 2 tbsp poultry spice, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper, and poured it over the top of the breast, in a oven bag and brought out of the oven the juiciest turkey I have ever made my husband and brother-in-law loved it. It was beautifully brown and the skin crisped up nicely. I definatly will make this turkey again. Thanks for the idea.

I cook a turkey every Christmas and Thanksgiving with good results but I wanted tried this recipe to see what the difference would be. First, the recipe calls for the turkey to be cooked to 180F. In my opinion, this is too long and results in a drier turkey. I would suggest cooking to 170F.  I didn't add the butter under the skin because I had already purchased a Butterball prior to finding this recipe.  The seasoning put on the outside really added little extra flavour to the turkey itself. However, it resulted in the most delicious drippings and probably the best gravy I have ever made, hence the five star rating.  I would use this recipe again just for that reason but continue to buy Butterballs and cook it only to 170F.

My first turkey ever and it turned out wonderful!!! Everyone bragged about how moist it was.  I loved the flavor.  I did use a roasting bag and covered it with foil.  The last 15 minutes I took the foil off to brown the top a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This smelled delicious and look absolutely beautiful.  The meat was deliciously moist however it really lacked flavor.  I would recommend rubbing herbs under the skin to increase the flavor of the meat.  Other than that, it was fantastic!

Awesome recipe for  a wonderful, but super easy turkey.  This was the easiest to turkey to carve the meat literally fell off the bones.  I used my meat themometer and my turkey was done earlier than I expected.  Thanks for the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS:) My sis-n-law made this on Thanksgiving & it was the Best I've ever had... I think I enjoyed it more than our usual deep-fried! This says ALOT from me since I don't care for turkey that much due to it's dryness... THIS WAS SOOOOO MOIST & THE PRESENTATION WAS BEAUTIFUL-- LIGHTLY "GOLDEN" W/ THE GREEN SPECKLES FROM THE PARSLEY... A MUST TRY! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Everyone raved about the extremely moist and tasty turkey.  Followed all directions except substituted chicken broth for the water/bouillon and added cut up carrots, onions, and celery to the pan and cavity.  Made absolutely delicious gravy.  Will use this recipe from now on.  Others asked for it as well.

This was fantastic. I added a stick of butter coated in poultry seasoning into the cavity with some quartered onions and celery sticks. Then I slathered the second on the turkey. Used low sodium turkey stock and it turned out perfectly. This is the best turkey I've made in the decade or so I've been cooking for my parents. I also made sure some of the stock went in the cavity not just the pan. The gravy was the best ever as well.

This is THE BEST! I have made more turkeys than I can count, but none have been better than this one.  No need to brine, no need to roast upside down, no need to baste.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect and EASY!  Obviously the large amount of liquid combined with the tightly foiled pan allows the bird to be extraordinarily moist and tender. I took the foil off for the last 45 minutes of cooking and the skin browned up beautifully.  Thank you Robin, for making this and all future Thanksgivings easy and stress-free!

I used this recipe yesterday, and the "Perfect Turkey" recipe last weekend...this one is THE ONE to use!  I did brine my turkey first, and I used an injector to inject the melted butter, and I stuffed with carrots, onion, celery, and an apple.

Everyone raved over this turkey. It turned out so moist, tender and flavorful. The bird was too tender to remove from the cooking pan. The meat truly fell off the bones. You can see in the photo what I was able to get out in whole pieces. I cooked this in an enamel roaster pan with the lid on the entire time. My 13 lb bird cooked in only 3.5 hrs and was golden brown toasty looking on the top. Excellent recipe!!! Thanks for sharing.

I added clementine oranges, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary to the cavity. I cooked a 12lb turkey about 4.5 hrs at 325-350...removed the foil during the last 30 minutes. I did baste every hour or so.....delicious! This was so moist! I will be making this bird every year!

This was great. I had a 12 pound turkey and put it in for 3 1/2 hours and I overcooked it. The great thing was though, it was still moist! Not dry at all! If I would have taken it out 30-45 earlier it would have even been better! This by far is the best way to cook a Turkey. I used a foil tent as well and still had wonderful flavor. Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  Family loved it too. Paired it with the easy gravy recipe from this sight and it doesn't get any easier to make Thanksgiving dinner anytime of the year.  Thanks for sharing.  3/31/13: Update to my original review.  Making this recipe for Easter this year. I have been making this recipe for years now, I always use chicken broth in the pan, and just sprinkle the bird with onion powder and seasoning salt. I put the pan drippings into a big measuring cup and take to top fat part to make my gravy. I then freeze the rest of the drippings for making gravy for future meals.

First time making a turkey and it was very successful, putting the butter between the skin and breast meat made it so juicy! I will recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to make a delicious turkey!

I can remember Thanksgiving in the UP as a child. I found this recipe one year and decided to try it. Brought back some great memories. I probably  will not eat turkey any other way now. A must try recipe!! I brine mine for 24 hrs. prior to roasting and all I add to this great recipe is one bottle of stout beer.

I have made my turkey this way ever since I found this recipe a couple of years ago. The turkey is always moist and delicious and it makes alot more savory gravy than any other way I've prepared turkey. I can't thank you enough Robin for what has now become a traditional family recipe!

my wife who had NEVER cooked a turkey gave this a try and the turkey came out FANTASTIC! don't waste your time searching for a sure-fire, can't-be-wrong recipe...you've found it! dark meat was perfect and the breast (white) was just as good! evenly cooked, easy to cut...what more could you want?

This is the only way I will cook a turkey from now on!!  I've done it this way twice in the past few weeks and both times it was very tender and moist!  I did give the color a little help by rubbing Tom with olive oil and paprika.  Thanks!!

I was very dissappointed in this recipe.I had a 14 pound Turkey and after 3 1/2 hours the legs had fallen away from the turkey. I still had hopes in the flavor and moistness but it was extremely dry and had no flavor. I made it for Thanksgiving so I ended up spooning the pan drippings over the sliced turkey to give it some sort of juiciness. I will stick to my original recipe and bag cooking method.

EXCELLENT!  This was my first time hosting T-giving at my house AND  my first attempt at roasting a turkey.  Everyone raved about how juicy it was. My brother, who is an "unofficial" food critic actually said it was the best turkey he has ever eaten!   A few notes:  I brined the turkey overnight in a cooler outside.  I used the "Turkey Brine" recipe found on this site.  Also, my 20.81 lb turkey took only 4 hours to roast.  I went to take off the aluminum foil and to check the temperature and it was already at 180 degrees in the thigh.  So be sure to keep an eye on the temperature.  Originally, I thought a turkey this size would take about 4 and 1/2 hours with the brining, 5 hours without.  Glad I checked the thermometer when I did!  Again, I highly recommend this recipe.  You will be sure to impress with this one.  Good luck!

I made this turkey last year, and while it was good...it took forever to cook, and I dont want to make the same mistake this year.

Can anyone tell me, for a 13 lb. stuffed turkey, how long the cooking time should be?
Also..I see a lot of peopel recommend putting it on a bed of veggies, or on a rack, what if I put the veggies under the rack in the roasting pan, would that work as well? Or should you use one or the other?

this is a very good recipe. I used this on turkey and chicken. I followed the recipe exactly except added a few sprinklings of garlic powder and baked in a cooking bag and took the meat off the bone before serving. I would absolutely recommend cutting back on the seasoning salt. The gravy was excellent just a little too salty.  I thickened the pan juices with flour and on one occassion added a jar of store bought gravy to stretch it out.

This was my first time to ever cook a turkey and I have to say it was the best turkey I have ever eaten.  I was so scared I was going to mess it up and it turned out so moist.  I will use this recipe every time.  I even made this in one of those tiny stoves.

Excellent! Made this for Thanksgiving at the deer lease and it was perfect! The only thing I added was onions and celery to the cavity. When we warmed it up later for leftovers I poured some melted butter over it to add some moistness to it that may have been lost and it was great this way as well! Thank you!

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving this year.  Wow, what a great recipe.  My husband is requesting that I make it again for Christmas Eve and says it was the best turkey he ever had!  I made just a turkey breast about 5 lbs and used a Reynold's oven roasting bag cooked at 350 for about 1 1/2 hours. I didn't have dried minced onion so I used fresh and doubled the amount and it turned out great.  I also only had the cubes of chicken bouillon, so I used 3 cubes and kept the water at the same amount.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Absolutely fantastic turkey recipe!  The most juicy & flavorful turkey any of us have ever tasted - BY FAR!
I added rubbed sage to the seasoned salt on the skin to accent the rosemary/sage flavored stuffing.  Also, I injected the turkey with a melted butter/chicken bullion mixture which made the turkey stunningly juicy.  Turkey was cooked in roaster pan with tented foil (no rack).  Foil was removed the last 45-60 minutes for browning.  Also, remember to let turkey cool for 30 minutes before carving to let juices settle in meat.

This recipe was delicious!  We had a 25 pound turkey, so we doubled everything in the recipe, except for the seasoning salt, and it worked out great!!  All of my guests thought the turkey was delicious, some even said, it was the "best turkey I've ever had".  Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe!!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it came out pretty well. The only thing is the herbs tend to burn in the bottom of the roaster before the turkey is done, so you might smell some burning. I did cook the turkey on a rack inside the roaster to prevent it from getting soggy as others have said, and it worked very well. I was pleased.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe, especially for a novice cook like me!  A few changes:  buttered the outside of the turkey too, used garlic salt and pepper to season, and stuffed the cavity with a quartered lemon and quartered onion.  The turkey was done and falling off the bones in just 3 hours!

This is the BEST way to cook a turkey, and as far as the foil, rack issue.... I put my turkey in the pan-no rack, then tent my foil.  If you wrap your turkey, the seasoning will be on the foil and not on the turkey!!  I have also found that tenting causes the turkey skin to have a better texture than wrapping.  Good Luck to all for Turkey day!!!  Enjoy!!!!

This was just o.k. 4+ cups of liquid in the bottom of the roasting pan seemed sort of odd. But then again, a baked turkey is almost foolproof with any recipe.

Delicious!  I made my first turkey this year.  I was a bit apprehensive, but I had no need to worry!  My husband and I made it a joint effort.  It turned out so moist and delicious.  The gravy was also fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe.  I was using a turkey breast but still was able to put the butter under the skin.  That is what keeps your turkey so juicy.  I made if for my family when they came to visit.  My grandmother loved it so much she has made two turkeys in the past month!  She said she has always looked for a good turkey recipe and this is the best she has ever found.

I used a 51/2lb turkey breast and reduced the remaining ingredients - it was just my husband who was going to eat it since I'm a vegetarian.  He said it was the best turkey he ever had.  Of course, I had to notify my mom and sisters that the vegetarian of the family makes the best turkey!

Used this recipe for two Thanksgivings in a row.  Last year was my "test turkey" which turned out ok, but was literally swimming in liquid.  This year's bird fared much better, as I cut down the boullion by a cup (turkey drippings add alot of liquid to the pan, anyways) and used sage (was out of parsley).  It turned out great!  Perfectly browned and seasoned.  The future in-laws couldn't stop raving (woo, brownie points)!

I used this recipe on a 17 lb. turkey for my first thanksgiving hosting, and it was great!  The meat was very tender and perfectly cooked; my guests all enjoyed it.  I browned the turkey for about 45 min before putting on the foil tent, then took the foil off again for the last 30 min. or so.

This is the BEST turkey ever! I've done turkey a dozen times before and I received a lot of compliments w/ this particular way of cooking the turkey.  My husband was so impressed he swears he'll never do the turkey again...the job is all mine.  This was the juciest turkey ever and it was really easy.  You can't mess up!  I cooked a 25 lb. turkey and used the Cranberry Sausage Stuffing...what a combo!  Your family will love it...and they will love you!Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Normally my turkey is very moist with a crisp skin... this year I tried a new recipe - the Michigander. What a mistake! It was dry... and lacked the flavor we are accustom to enjoying. The parlsey and onions poured over the top prevent the skin from achieving that picture perfect glow. I won't be using this recipe again.

This is the best turkey recipe I have ever tasted.  I've made it the past 3 years, with nothing but rave reviews - I can't imagine cooking turkey any other way!  This year I even omitted the butter to cut back on calories, and it was still spectacular, not the least bit dry!  Thanks so much for this recipe, Robin!

This was the best turkey that I have ever tasted, and it was my very first turkey that I've cooked by myself. I was nervous at first, but the ingredients were very easy and the directions were simple. The turkey was so juicy, especially the breast, which I thought would be dry but to my surprise wasn't. I used the instant chicken boullion instead of the cubes which was much easier for me, and I rubbed the whole turkey down with butter before I poured the juices on top. just some things that helped me. I would MOST DEFINITELY make again.

I used a 4 pound turkey breast with this recipe, I didn't have any seasoning salt but used a garlic herb mixture with salt. I used about half the amount of other ingredients listed.  It turned out just delicious!  This is the best turkey I've ever had!  It couldn't be any easier and couldn't taste any better.

I made this last year for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with everyone especially the soldiers who were unable to go home for the holiday, that stopped by for a home cooked meal. I will make this again this year but the soldiers are now in Iraq. Thanks for a great recipe and a Keeper. God bless our troops!!

This has to be the best no-fail turkey recipe I've ever tried. The only thing I added was to baste with butter every half hour or so. The meat always turns out so juicy, I never have to worry about dry turkey again. Thanks a lot!

I used this recipe for my first turkey and it was **fabulous**!  Instead of rubbing plain butter under the skin, I used a parmesan garlic butter.  So good!  Also you can get the butter under the skin without cutting it -- just reach between the meat and the skin.

This was the first turkey I cooked, period, I have no turkey cooking experience at all. And my turkey turned out perfect. Better than my mom's turkeys ever were. It was moist, tender, flavorful. And the juice/broth mixture made a heavenly gravy. I did add some garlic powder and a little thyme to the seasoning mix. This turkey got RAVE reviews. 
Thank you thank you!

Best turkey I've ever eaten!  Recipe does indeed make the breast meat more moist.  I cut down on the seasoning salt, just to be safe, and it was delicious.

Well I made my first turkey ever this year and I must say it was a total success, thanks to you!  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and added some extra boullion, and I used fresh parsley instead of dried.  I also rubbed the turkey down with olive oil before salting it.  I basted the turkey once an hour, until I took the foil off and then I basted about every 15 minutes.  And I occasionally injected the fluids into the meat.  This turkey was golden brown and delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was my 2nd year making this - and both times it turned out perfectly.  This year, I blended sage & butter & then froze until firm.  I used the sage butter to insert under the skin. Wonderful.   Thanks.

This was the most tender turkey I have ever made.  It also had a great flavor.  For the minced onions I substituted several green onions.  My family and in-laws gave great reviews.

I cooked my first Xmas Dinner for my whole family last year and used this turkey recipe.  My mother was skeptical that I would be able to even cook a turkey.  But I blew everyone away with this recipe.  Each piece of meat was tender and juicy.  It took longer to cook than the recipe says, but other than that I was impressed.  I think my turkey turned out better than my Mom's ever has!! Thanks!!!

I used this with Cornish Hens, and it came out great.  Really tender, really flavorful (I had to cut down the cooking time to 1 hour).  Be careful if using some of this to make gravy though - it is very salty on account of the boullion, and has a very boullion (artificial) taste.  Great recipe though, thanks.  Will use it to roast lots of poultry now.

This was the best tasting turkey my family ever had.  It was my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner, and the turkey was fabulous! (I added extra butter to the outside to make sure it stayed moist)  The turksy was exceptionally moist and tv-perfect golden!!

This recipe was good.  But it tasted like any whole cooked Turkey on Thanksgiving I have had. Not super moist or a dramatic taste like I expected after reading the reviews.

Wow!  I did a 21.5 pound turkey for turkey day ,and it was simply wonderful!  The big shock and a half for me was that the turkey was DONE in less than 3.5 hours!!!  We had to jiggle things around and ended up eating a bit earlier than planned!  So moist and the gravy was totally top notch!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first turkey I had ever made, and personaly am not fond of Turkey.  My boyfriend loved it; but I thought it could have used just a little bit more flavor, and will be more daring with the seasoning.  I t came out very juicy and for the first time, I think it was great.

I have finally found a recipe that works.
Every part of my turkey was so moist and tasted so good.
The best I have ever had in my day.
I will now make every turkey I cook like this.
I highly recommend everyone to try this.
You won't be sorry.

I am so glad that I found this recipe. 
It was delicious and very moist, the meat practicly fell off the bone. The drippings made  for wonderful gravy. The fact that it was so simple made it perfect. 
I will definitly make it this again. Thank You for sharing this recipe!!

This was my first turkey and it turned out great! We cooked it breast side down until the last 1/2 hour, then flipped it so it would brown. Very good!

This was the first year for me to cook the the turkey.  I didn't want to disappoint my family. I wanted an easy, but good recipe and decided on this one.  
To my surprise the turkey came out great and the aroma that was coming from the oven was driving my fiance crazy.  The turkey was juicy and flavorful as promised.  I will definently be using this recipe again and again.    

The soon to be Moya family!!

What a delicious turkey !  I made this today, a little leary of the outcome - boy was I surprised !  The turkey was so moist and the flavor was yummy.  I cooked an 18 pound Butterball, it took exactly 5 hours.  At about 4 hours 15 minutes, I removed the foil for the turkey to brown.  It was perfect ! Everyone commented on how wonderful it was - my daughter ate 6 helpings !  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

absolutely the best turkey I've ever prepared. I use a turkey breast and bake in a stoneware pan. I also like to use the turkey with the pop-up timer. My entire family loves this recipe!

This is a terrific recipe! The turkey browned perfectly just like you said. It was very moist. My sister in law asked for the recipe to cook for her parents-in-law for christmas. I was so flattered when she asked, because that means that my husband was complimenting my holiday dinner behind my back!!

This was the most tender, juicy turkey I have ever had.  I placed cut apples in the breast cavity and this added a little something to the drippings and the gravy!

Excellent recipe!  :-D  Very juicy, got lots of compliments.  And easy!  It took a little time to separate the skin into all the little "pockets" for the butter, but it was soooooo worth it.  I plan to use this recipe over and over again!

I roasted the best turkey yet using this recipe.  Everyone loved it even my very picky 2 year old.  She's munching on it as I type.  My turkey was 20 pounds and it was very moist.  Thank you for this recipe Robin C.  Angela

Everyone was right! This was so moist and the broth was very tasty! I did take some others' advice and cut down on the cooking time. Now I won't have to worry about a dry bird! Thanks!!!

easy, fast recipe that everyone loved. took other reviewers advice and cooked it for 2 hours before checking with a thermometer. was 190deg internally and still had to brown. definitely way to long cooking time in the recipe.

This was super easy to make. I was thoroughly satisfied with the results. Although it was my first time ever, making a turkey, I decided to add a little bit more flavor with some fresh ingredients. For my 10 lb bird, I decided to coarsely chop up a medium-sized onion and added some fresh tarragon sprigs of leaves as well. Since I was already adding butter under the skin, this is where I placed the tarragon and onions. The end result....every single part of the turkey was desirable.

I always do 10-15 min in 2" boiling chicken stock beforehand so the dark meat will be ready at the same time as the white. But that's the only change I've made to this recipe.  It's fantastic.

This is my favorite way to make turkey.  I do it in a bag, which I believe makes it more moist.  As written (with the bag), I would strongly recommend this.  I recently changed this up just a tad.  The night before cooking, I rubbed the turkey with the seasoning salt, parsley and about 1 Tbsp. of dried rosemary.  Then I added the butter and slid some sliced lemons in between the skin and the meat.  That sat all night.  Just before popping it in the oven, I dumped the chicken broth around the outside.  I totally forgot the onions.  The result was an amazing flavored, moist turkey.  I will do it this way again.

An excellent recipe. Family loved it. This will be our go to recipe for turkey from now on. I would also recommend the turkey be brined before cooking. The brining and butter under skin will keep it moist.

Soooo many ways to ruin a bird, so few to make it 'great'! This is a perfectly adequate recipe for ok Roasted Turkey and very well suited for those pressed for prep time. One addition for those who maybe wish for it to appear the made a little extra effort,  soften your butter to room temperature and then add herbs and/or spices entirely of your choosing to the butter before rubbing it under the skin. Note:  you may wish to choose seasoning that goes well with your sides.

Most of the method used in this recipe is good but the quantities and a couple things make no sense.  Luckily I've done my share of cooking and changed a few things.  I've tried the butter under the skin a couple times before, and I've tried injecting and I've tried cooking uncovered and basting.  Injecting can make for good turkey, but it tends to make a lot of spots with lots of flavor and lots of spots with little flavor and also makes a lot of holes for juices to escape.  I think the best method is seasoned butter under the skin and outside the skin and cooking covered until the last 45 mins then browning.  This results in a flavorful and moist turkey with almost no effort while cooking.

I cooked a 20lb turkey.  First, 4 cups of water is way too much, even for a 20lb turkey.  I added about 1.5 cups of bone broth over the turkey and ended up with the large roasting pan almost overflowing with juice and fat.  Second, putting your herbs into the water/broth and pouring it over the turkey does nothing except add liquid to the bottom of the pan.  Third, 4 hours is too long for a 12lb turkey.

I defrosted my 20lb turkey for almost 6 days.  I mixed a cube of butter with sage, thyme, salt, and minced garlic and spread it around under the skin of the breast and legs and all around the outside of the turkey.  I added one quartered lemon and half a large onion inside the turkey.  I poured about 1.5 cups of chicken bone broth over the turkey (which wasn't needed and did nothing).  A

This was great. I used the broth mix as a brine in an oven bag, put the turkey in, then threw it in my fruit drawer for 24 hours. Stuffed it with Granny Smith apples. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was the best turkey I've ever eaten! For the first time ever I didn't need to smother the turkey breast in gravy for it to be edible. I will never look for another turkey recipe.

Very moist turkey.  I didn’t have minced onions so I sprinkled chopped onion bits over the bird.  Will repeat it next year.

Turned out great! I did use onion soup mix instead of just dried onion. And I stuffed it with onion, garlic and dried sage.

Perfect turkey!!  The Greatest secret is butter under the breast skin to keep it moist. I’ve tried over a dozen recipes and this Is the best. I end up putting the bird on a rotisserie in the BBQ in order to free up oven space. I use indirect heat and put a disposable foil pan under the turkey to prevent flare ups and catch drippings for gravy as desired. It makes for an evenly browned turkey with super easy cleanup.
Rotisserie Cook time is 10-15 min per lb, put scrap veggies and liquid in the drip pan to help increase moisture and control temperature. Refill the liquid while the turkey cooks.

This is the turkey recipe I use when I cook the turkey for Thanksgiving every year. The reviews are accurate and everyone I’ve made it for says its the best roasted turkey they’ve ever had.

WARNING, do NOT use the turkey drippings as they are for gravy. There is a TON of sodium in this brine, which works beautifully when most of the liquid runs off by the time the bird is served, but is far too salty to use as a gravy base. The gravy I made straight from all the chicken bouillon and seasoned salt was comically salty and inedible (saltier than soy sauce I’d say). You’re gonna want to dilute the drippings with chicken stock or just water, and then it yields a great gravy!

Sooooo good!  The best turkey I've ever made.  The kids ate it all up!  I had a 11.75 lb turkey and cooked it for 3.5 hours.  The last 45 minutes I took the foil off.  The outside looked a little dry (I think I've seen too many movies and commercials of shiny roasted turkeys) but it was not dry whatsoever!  I am totally impressed with myself for pulling this off.  So you can do it too!  It's nice because you do not need to baste this while it's cooking - and in fact I read somewhere online that basting doesn't really do much (except make your face hot and possibly burn your hands from fiddling in the hot oven).  Enjoy!!  I followed this recipe to the T.  If anything next time I might not put so much seasoning on the outside - it was a teeny but too salty but not bad at all.  My two teenagers and I ate the turkey and the left overs in three days!

Added my own italian seasoning mixture, 2 cloves garlic with the warm water. I placed 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the butter under the breast skin. I did sprinkle just 1T seasoning salt over the turkey top. Turned out a wonderful Thanksgiving meal.

Very good and very easy. I made ours in granny's covered roaster pan, so no foil. Also, I brined the turkey for 24 hours before roasting, but otherwise followed the recipe. Very moist, even as leftovers. The skin did not finish crispy, so that was not served (the roasting pan kept the bird in a sauna).  Very tasty and the aroma reminded me of Grandma's house. Now I'm the Grandpa,  and the memories continue.

Absolutely amazing turkey.  I would say for extra flavor for gravy use chicken stock instead of bullion but that's minor.  I'm normally a dark meat gal but found myself choosing the white over dark this Thanksgiving!

I used non-dairy butter because of allergies in my house, but everything else was to the recipe. This was the most moist turkey we have ever had.  It was so good, there were no left overs!  That was the only bad part of this delicious turkey.

This was the first time I baked a turkey and it turned out so great! I followed exactly what the recipe calls for, nothing more, nothing less. It is Black Friday and my husband and I still enjoy the leftover as it is. Thank you so much for the recipe. We will do it again next year.

the turkey was really good, but word of advice, if you are going to stuff it you should expect it to put it in about an hour longer than normal and not to stress out.

Ok, this is my first review on this site but I had to write about this recipe.  Just so you all know, I am possibly the worst cook on the planet and usually recipes never come out quite right even if I follow the directions to a T.  

I must say this was literally the best turkey I ever made.  The meat fell off the bone.  I just substituted lower sodium chicken broth for the water and didn’t use the bouillion.    The key really is the butter under the skin.  Absolutely loved it!   Thank you for this wonderful recipe for a very novice cook

This is a great recipe  that is my go to for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This always gets rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is use chicken broth rather than water and bullion. The whole family loves this!

This is a great recipe  that is my go to for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This always gets rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is use chicken broth rather than water and bullion. The whole family loves this!

I have a large family (8 people just in mine alone) and I make this EVERY year along with Pioneer Woman's brining recipes. Everyone raves. Cooking it in a roaster for the first time today, so we will see how it turns out. I'm expecting it to be even better!

Just made this and loved it! I changed the minced onion to onion powder because I usually think minced onion is overbearing. The breast was nice and moist unlike a lot of turkey breasts. Delicious!

I made it as written but I cooked it a little too long trying to get crisper skin. It's the second time I did that, next time I won't be so nervous about opening oven door and checking the temperature ...lol..Rookie move two times in a row. Last Christmas and now  this Thanksgiving. Third time the charm I hope. Can't wait for Christmas.

I'm a Michigander living in Washington state and I made my first turkey this year. I yearned for the flavors we used back home and this recipe definitely delivered.

I love this recipe!  I started hosting Thanksgiving for our large family a few years ago.  We cook two, one smoked and this one.  They are both a hit.  It is always moist and has a great flavor.  It is also very easy for a first timer. I use a 14-15 pound  turkey and keep the other ingredients the same.  I always cook this in a covered turkey pan and skip the foil.

Tried using minced garlic  instead of powder or paste. Big mistake, rookie mistake! The garlic burned. However the turkey came out great and the breast was very moist. The wife is not a big turkey lover but really liked this bird.

Who says you have to wait until November to cook a turkey? We wanted cold turkey sandwiches in this triple digit summer here in the desert so I decide to do this one on the BBQ in order to keep from heating up the house. They may do it in Michigan but here in California we don't cook our birds to 180 degrees. Cooking times are for guesstimates. The only real way to know when your bird is done is to use a remote probe thermometer. I pulled the bird when it reached 157 degrees and let it push the the temp to 167 for a tender juicy bird with crispy skin. I also mixed in some extra parsley and minced onion with the butter and placed under the skin of the breast. Don't overcook your turkey unless you like turkey jerky. Depending on the size of your turkey the temp can raise as much as 10 degrees after removing it from the heat source.

I didn't even need a knife to carve this.  It was so tender that it fell off the bone on its own.  The breast was basically pulled turkey.  Best turkey I have ever tasted!

I stumbled across this recipe and put the bird together for Christmas dinner exactly as instructed.  I put my meat thermometer in the breast (away from the bone) so I wouldn't overcook the bird and tented it with foil.  An hour later, we left to visit an ill friend and, before leaving, I turned the oven temp down to 325...just in case we'd be gone a bit longer than planned.  Well, time just got away from us and on the way home, I was more than concerned that the turkey would be way too dry(even though I did turn the oven down an hour after roasting at 350 degrees).  When we arrived, the meat thermometer registered 210 degrees...so I knew it was way too done.  The bird had been covered the entire time and I thought, great, I'll have this white on top, over cooked bird.  To my surprise, the bird was a lovely golden brown and the breast meat was not over cooked at all. And, most importantly, it was still moist and wonderful. It sliced up beautifully.  This sold me forever on this turkey recipe.   Thank you Robin C.  You saved my Christmas dinner!

The only change I made to this recipe was that I also put it in a turkey bag in addition to the foil &  basted twice -  once halfway through cooking &  once when I removed the foil &  cut open the bag during the last 45 minutes.  

I have hosted Christmas at my house for several years &  each year I've tried different recipes trying to rid my friends &  family of the traditional dry turkey you have to slather with gravy in order to swallow it.  This RECIPE IS IT!  I received such rave reviews & a few evil glances from my mother who always hosts thanksgiving!  They kept asking how I did it because turkey is always so dry lol.  Who knew the secret would be so simple -  no brining for days or hours or a hundred ingredients could beat this recipe! For the 1st time,  I had very little turkey left over &  a ton of gravy!!  Only change I'm making next year -  make sure to have 3lbs of turkey per person instead of 2 :)

My first turkey ...it was great! Although my turkey was 16lb, it was finished cooking way too soon. I had to get it out so it wouldn't dry out. I wasn't able to brown it the way I like it, but it was still great! Next year, I will put it in the oven uncovered to start. Once it gets brown enough, I will then cover it, enabling me to get it out as soon as it's done.

Super tender! Did not touch a knife when carving, just fell right off the bone! I added stuffing and an apple to the cavity, and placed some orange slices under the skin.  I also cooked it breast side down for the second half of the cooking process.  I can't count how many compliments I got on my turkey!

This was my first time making a turkey and it was perfect.  My husband a several of my guest normally don't eat turkey because it can be a hit or miss if it turns out dry.  Well I decided to give this recipe a try and couldn't be any happier.  My turkey turned out moist and very tasty.  Every single person had some and asked for some in their doggy bag.  Simple to make and everyone loved it and requested the recipe.  I used the recipe as is without any substitutions.  Definitely a keeper and will use it again.

Very good! I too put extra butter under the skin on the drumsticks and under the breast, but everything else was spot on! Mine seemed to take a little longer than specified, but it was delicious!

I made this recipe for a 10 lb turkey and it worked out really well. The turkey meat was very moist and the skin was nicely seasoned. A very easy recipe. If I use the same recipe again I may use about half the water next time since the broth in the bottom of the pan prevented me from being able to use the turkey juices in the gravy. Great and easy recipe though!

I made this a few years ago and it was the first turkey I have ever made....I followed the directions exactly and it was PERFECT! My family raved about it & devoured it. The drippings made the most fantastic gravy as well! Thank you!  I'm pulling it up again now to make again this year!

I have done my turkey this way every year and it never failed. All my relatives trust me and only with Thanksgiving turkey. The main key is to make sure the turkey is young and less than 13 pounds for easy bite!

Was good.... left out the dried herbs,.
Also, we here in the South, cook our turkeys upside down and add butter to baste every hour. 
Adds even more juiciness.. just a tip!

I have never made a whole turkey before since it's always  been just hubby and me and I was terrified. But this turkey is AMAZING!!!! It turned out crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth juicy on the inside. Everyone raved about this bird. SO! GOOD!

I have made this recipe two times now. My first attempt my 12 pound bird was fully cooked at 2 hours (Like many other reviewers have been). I will not let this recipe defeat me and I was determined to make delicious gravy from the stock! My friends I have succeeded and you get to reap from my failures. 

1. I decrease the temperature to 325 and checked it at 2 hours and again in 30 minutes. It was pretty close to being done at 2 1/2 hours so i took the foil off to cook for another 45 minutes and took out all the drippings for the gravy and strained it. The turkey was moist, cooked fully and I got crispy skin. 
2.  All Recipe's Easy Turkey Gravy is a PERFECT combination with only the tweak that I did not add any salt. I did season it to taste with pepper. 


Best.Turkey.Ever.

I made this a few weeks ago and it is the first time I've had a turkey come out well. I've attempted making a whole turkey about 5 times over the past 20 years, and this is the first time it browned and cooked right. I didn't stuff it and even forgot to sprinkle it with the seasoned salt. I will be making it again tonight, so THANK YOU SO MUCH for submitting this recipe :)

This was the most moist and delicious white meat I have ever tasted.  I used a good pastured butter and followed all the directions except I spatchcocked the turkey so it would cook faster.  This  recipe will be a tradition for my family.

I followed this recipe to make a turkey in my grandmother's clay dutch oven. I have never made a turkey before and was nervous I would do it wrong! Turned out to be the best turkey my husband and I have EVER had! The meat fell right off the bones. I had a 17.25 lb turkey and cooked it for 4.5 hours. The skin was perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and the meat was tender and juicy on the inside. I added sage to my butter mixture. I think the clay pot combined with this recipe will be my best kept secret for years to come!

Perfection! And really easy, too. I mixed about a teaspoon of Goya Adobo with pepper in with the butter the third time I made this and it added an extra burst of flavor to the meat. Delicious!

The best turkey I've ever made. I didn't have dried minced onion, but I used onion powder and it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. Very very juicy and beautifully seasoned.

Loved it!  This recipe created a beautiful bird.  It was the first time I have ever had crunchy golden skin!  I cooked the bird breast side down for the first two hours,  flipped it, and then cooked  breast side up for the last  1 1/2 hours (I was only cooking a 13lb bird)--it was perfect.  I also combined the herbs and the butter and smeared the herb butter under the skin and over the skip.  Unfortunately, I ran out of seasoning salt so I rubbed a trader joe's condensed chicken broth packet on the bottom of the bird and then applied one to the breast side when the bird was flipped. This tureky received rave freviews! This will be my go to recipe for now on!

Turned out great!  I omitted the minced onion and parsley, and added black pepper.  Turned out beautiful and delicious!  Basted it 3 or 4 times during the cooking, and kept it covered with foil the whole time.  It browned well with the foil on it.

I didnt actually taste it since I am a vegetarian however I heard It was a hit and had no leftovers so it must of been true. Simple to the point receipe. I did brine it the night before which I have come to believe is the only way to prepare a turkey theses days.

I didnt actually taste it since I am a vegetarian however I heard It was a hit and had no leftovers so it must of been true. Simple to the point receipe. I did brine it the night before which I have come to believe is the only way to prepare a turkey theses days.

Perfect way to make your holiday turkey. I've made this every year and have NEVER had a bad result. You can add a few extra spices to suit your taste, but as it, it's perfect. I baste mine continuously throughout the cooking process and the skin comes out crispy and tasty )if you like to eat the skin!)

Excellent, but I did brine the turkey first (2 c kosher salt rubbed inside and out the turkey and place in a large stock pot, fill to top with water and let refrigerate overnight; rinse bird thoroughly in am and discard brine mixture).  I was very generous with the seasonings too.  The brine made the turkey tender and juicy, and the rest of the recipe contributed to the juicy and made it deliciously flavored.

With this one, I always stick to the recipe!  I have never had so many compliments about a piece of meat before!!  Everyone raved about how tender and flavourful it was, even the white meat!  It turns out moist, instead of dry like some white meat tends to be.   I have used this recipe 5 times and see no reason to change that for all my future Thanksgivings!

I made a turkey for the first time ever and this is the recipe I went with. AMAZING! I don't even usually eat the skin, but this was so good that I had to. The turkey turned out moist and great flavor.

We used a 17.5 pound turkey but followed the directions exactly.  It was ready in 4 hours.  We let it sit a half hour and it was delicious.   It was a beautiful golden brown color.

It's a very basic and easy to follow recipe. The only thing I did different was I used a baking bag in lieu of a Dutch oven (I don't own one unfortunately).

This recipe always turns out! I use only 1 tablespoon of season salt. The meat is moist and full of flavor. The drippings cooked with milk/wondra flour make a fantastic turkey gravy! Thanks for a family favorite!

i've cooked a bit, but yesterday was my first turkey.  thanks for your recipe, which worked great.

i added about 6 cups of water, chopped celery, and more chopped onion to the pan, with the neck and heart.  once turkey was done, i strained it, and added another 2/3 cups water mixed with ~4 tablespoons corn starch...heated and had a great gravy.

It was my first time cooking a turkey and this recipe was so awesome!! I got so many compliments on my turkey and as a person who doesn't like leftovers, this definitely was not the case with this recipe! I kept craving more and more. I added honey to the top of the turkey towards the end, if you like honey, definitely try that!!

turkey is a really hard bird to cook since it has a tendency to go dry, but i think this recipe made the most of it. while it wasn't as juicy as i hoped it would be, it was better than most turkey recipes i've tried before

This turkey is amazing! Thank you so much for the recipe!! I used this recipe to make my very FIRST turkey!! It was so easy to follow and it turned out incredibly moist & delicious! By far the best ever, my fiancé swears it is the best turkey he's ever had (and my mom is a great cook) (;

Update: 2 years later and this is still the BEST turkey, this Thanksgiving will be my 3rd time using this recipe!

I've usually baked my turkeys in a browning bag but this year I wanted a crisper skin so I opted for this recipe. I'm not blaming the recipe for my turkey being somewhat dry. I roasted the bird at 325 degrees, as that was the way I was taught. My cooking teacher in highschool and the directions on the bird both stated 325, so that's what I went with. I was having a bit of trouble getting it done and I think I left it in too long.  Another mistake I made was using heavy duty foil. The directions on the turkey tag said to use light foil. It was still pretty juicy but not quite as juicy as I wanted so there's room for tweaking next time. I really liked the butter under the skin and using the chicken broth in the pan. My only complaint is that it was waay too salty for my taste with the seasoned salt and next time I'll season it differently. The skin is so salty it's inedible.

Great recipe for a beginner! Easy to follow and very low maintenance. Just be mindful of your turkeys weight and follow the instructions on the packaging.

Tried this today (Memorial Day). It was a very basic easy to follow recipe... so I put my husband in charge of making the turkey...It turned out as I expected. We were pleased with the flavor of the turkey.

This was the first time I have ever made a turkey so I was very nervous and it ended up being the best turkey I've ever had. I made an amazing gravy from the drippings and didn't put any on the turkey bc it was so moist!  I also loved that it was so simple that not even I could screw it up :) Definitely will be eating turkey more often at my house now!

The PERFECT turkey!

15 lbs. Butterball.  The only thing I did differently was to make an herb butter with fresh Rosemary, Sage, and Thyme to spread under and atop the skin.  I cooked for 4 hours under foil, and uncovered for one additional hour.  Viola!  Best turkey I have ever made.

THANK YOU!

I added a few things to this recipe, sort of mixed the rosemary turkey with this and added some citrus as well. It gave it a little more kick as I have some fussy people to cook for! But the recipe produced a very moist turkey and even the people who claimed turkey is normally too dry loved it.

Excellent flavor- I brined mine the night before and then doubled the ingredients for my 20 pound bird.  You should definitely skip any salt if it has been brined- then you will get some excellent turkey broth to make gravy out of.  I baked mine for 1 hour at 375 and then 5 hours at 350- adjust according to size of bird.  Never needed any basting, just plopped it in the oven and a beautiful bird appeared when it was done!

Butter was a little difficult to place between the turkey and the skin but it was well worth it.  It's the most succulent and moist turkey that I have made in a few years.  Will definitely make it again!

This was my first turkey ever. I smothered it with butter as others suggested and put it in a bag. I doubled it because we had a 23 pounder and while it took a lot longer to cook than expected it did turn out very juicy and flavorful.

I followed directions carefully for Thanksgiving and when I removed the foil, the turkey fell apart.  There was just this pile of turkey pieces saturated in the broth.  The legs fell right off the carcass.  There were no brown bits in the bottom of the pan with which to make rich, dark gravy.  Fortunately, it was just for my husband and I, as I would have been ashamed to serve it to guests. The meat tasted good, however and was certainly moist.

I have made this several times and it has always turned out well.  The first time I made, I use bullion cubes crushed up for lack of understanding with the ingredient and it drippings were too salty to be used for anything.  But the bird was still great.

You just can't ignore a ratings score like that. I made my first every turkey on thanksgiving this year and used this recipe, used fresh onion instead of dried and rosemary instead of parsley. It was perfect. Thank you so much!

This was my first time making a Turkey and it was the best I've tasted. I used a boneless w/meat turkey breast.. I brined it over night w/1c brown sugar, 1c kosher salt, 2gallon water, 1tbspn pepper and 3 table spoon of garlic.. I followed the full recipe and added italian seasoning and garlic to the bird.. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!

I found this recipe and after reading reviews decided to try it. I have to say, it was my best turkey EVER! My husband could not stop eating it while he was supposed to be carving. I will never make a turkey any other way. I followed the recipe exactly.

Used this recipe to make my first turkey this year. It turned out great! The meat was moist and the skin was nice and golden. I did not have seasoning salt so I just used salt and pepper. It was super yummy!

I have made this turkey for the past 3 years!  It's absolutely amazing and a huge family hit.  There's not a thing I would change...NOT ONE THING!  Cooks a lot faster in a roaster oven, saving the con. oven for casseroles and rolls.

It was a good turkey simple and it was juicy but it needed more flavor to it.

This was a good recipe. I think I roasted my turkey for about 30 min. too long but it still turned out great.  This did make a ton of drippings which I throw out so I may not use as much broth next time.

I made this turkey this year for Thanksgiving and it turned out great! I put it in the roaster and cooked until the breast thermometer popped.  It was so easy! This was only my second attempt at cooking a turkey.

This was my second year making turkey, first time using this recipe.  Big hit!!  The recipe IS as simple as it sounds with hardly any prep time.  I had a 13lb. bird, and elevated it in the pan with a small rack.  After preparing as directed (being very generous with the butter, especially near the drums), I covered the entire turkey in foil.  (No tent).  Basically, my turkey steam cooked.  After two hours, I was pleasantly surprised to see it had turned a beautiful golden brown.  I only took the foil off the last half hour of cooking, for browning and only basted once the foil was off.  I was going to use the drippings to make a sauce or gravy, but I didn't need to.  Needless to say, this was the juiciest, most flavorful turkey I have ever eaten in my life. Sp simple, so delicious.

I have made plenty of turkeys in my day, usually brining. I thought I would try something with a bit more seasoning and with the rave reviews this one gets, thought I would try it.  It was only OK - nothing near the OMG level these folks are talking about. Usually, my turkey get "oh very juicy" or "very good". Not one compliment here (nor any disses, and my family is frank). The meat was not dry, but also not as juicy as brining yields. The onion flavor distracts from turkey itself. And for those of you who love the crispy, brown skin to nibble on while carving, fughetabatit! I think for my next turkey I will combine some of the ideas here and brining.

Turkey was very moist and flavorful.  Rave reviews.  I browned the neck etc and then simmered them in chicken broth, and used that as the majority of the stock for my gravy, adding a couple cups from the turkey as well.  This was the most praise I have ever received on a turkey, I will always do it this way going forward.

This was the first turkey I've ever cooked and the recipe was incredibly simple and fool proof. I might have liked it to have a bit more flavor or seasoning and may either brine it first next year or season it a little more heavily. Everyone said it was the moistest turkey they've ever had. We couldn't even put the whole turkey on the platter prior to carving it because it was literally falling off the bone.

Loved it!  I have been using the recipe for Rosemary Roasted Turkey for years.  This year wanted to try something new.  This was fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly and it made a juicey flavorful turkey.  May try this with chicken as well.  Highly recommended!

This is the best recipe for turkey. I added 1 tbl of ltaian seasoning, and I put 1/2 of the dry ingredients between the skin and breast with the butter.

Really good, my family likes turkey again! changes: stuffed the cavity with thyme, rosemary, garlic & onion. Roasted without foil, placed a piece of foil on top of the breast when it was browned.  Let rest prior to carving.

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving yesterday and it came out great.  I also squirted some of the mixture under the skin after putting in the butter.  My family loved this and I'm saving this recipe in my Recipe Box.  Thanks a lot, great recipe for a delicious and moist turkey.  (Also proud to be a Michigander!!)

I used this recipe for My first Thanksgiving Turkey. I left the turkey in too long but because I used this recipe The Turkey didn't come out nearly as dry as it should have. I would easily use this recipe again next year. I would just leave it in for the proper time as stated in the recipe. If I would have followed the correct time the Turkey would have been absolutely  perfect.

This was the very first turkey that I have ever made. I was very nervous as it would certainly be a disappointment for my guests not to have a turkey on Thanksgiving. Happy to say it was fantastic and everyone loved it. So simple to make and nearly no prep work... GREAT RECIPE!

Delicious! The Turkey was so moist and juicy, done just perfectly. This was such a nice, simple recipe, just what we were looking for. Instead of traditional seasoned salt, we used garlic salt and substituted chicken broth for the bouillon. My husband basted several times as well, even though it was covered with foil. Thanks!

Decided on making this instead of what I did last year. My b/f loves it and insisted that I make this again next year. Made the gravy out of the juice with flour and stirred...it was soo good! Oh yea...I added garlic powder in with bullion and warm water. 
So...this is 2 thumbs up!

Awesome! The only thing I add is a solid covering of paprika just before I put the foil on. The pan drippings are amazing in the stuffing and mashed potatoes!

Trying it on Thursday... I don't cook holiday dinners very often, can anyone tell me since there are liquids in this recipe if I should place the bird on the rack in the roasting pan or do I want the bird to sit in the juices?

Turned out great.  It was the first turkey I ever cooked and even my mom was impressed about how good it turned out.  If you use the turkey stock to make gravey you might not want to add any more salt.  The gravey I make asked for another tablespoon and came out to salty.

This is my go to turkey recipe!!! Sometimes I add strips of bacn on top of the bird but it does not need it, just for change up. I used an electric roaster, roasting pan in oven, even in a roasting bag, the recipe is great for all.

Everyone raved about this turkey.  Wonderful breast meat, and I'm usually a dark meat kinda girl.  I usually use a bag, just so I don't have to baste.  I'm making a turkey breast today and using this same recipe, soooo good!

For me gravy is optional with this recipe, it's so juicy.

This recipe is getting such good reviews and I was looking to experiment so I tried a turkey breast in my new dutch oven.  Required some trickery to get it to brown properly (white enamel inside), but I got it.  I seasoned as directed, but also threw into the pot:  a quartered tangerine, a chopped celery rib and a handful of baby carrots.  Turkey came out fabulous!  Used the juices (which there was plenty of, so much that I had to remove some and set it aside for later) to make gravy.  The gravy was very good, but salty.  I wondered at the 4c water to 3T bouillon when I first read it, so I'll decrease that next time since I always make gravy.  But judging this recipe on the turkey alone, 4.5 Stars!!  Thanks for sharing it :)  Since there are lots of pictures of finished turkeys, I added one of the uncooked breast which shows the butter under the skin for those needing help with that.  I didn't make "pockets" per se, I just loosened the skin by slipping my hands up under it from the bottom and then I spread the butter around in there.

Everyone agreed the turkey was moist and tender.  Had lots of juices for gravy.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I used Mrs. Dash's onion and herb blend on the outside of the turkey before cooking.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey for the family Thanksgiving dinner this year.  Everyone LOVED it, and the meat was very juicy and flavorful.  I used onion powder because I didn't have any minced onion, but followed everything else exactly.  It was perfect!  Thank you, Robin :)

Wow!!!  My husband is active duty army and we weren't able to make it home for Thanksgiving this year.  I was nervous about cooking Thanksgiving dinner since this was my first time doing it by myself, and not as mom's sidekick.  However, this turkey is amazing.  My husband and his friend, who never like white meat because it's too dry, devoured the dark meat and then moved on to the white.  There weren't hardly any leftovers to have the next night!  I was so proud of my first turkey!!!

I was told only two weeks before Thanksgiving that I would be in charge of dinner for my grandparents. I've never even made chicken successfully before, so Thanksgiving turkey intimidated me quite a bit. This recipe (and a Butterball) saved me. I just stuffed it with carrots, onions, and celery, put a little poultry seasoning in the butter and also put some butter on the outside of the turkey. I also only cooked the turkey to 165 degrees as recommended by a few sources. It was so moist and had great flavor. The only downside is that they liked it so much, I'll be in charge of Thanksgiving every year now!

Cooked our turkey using alton browns brine recipe and seasoning. Wow putting the butter  under the skin made the breasts melt in my mouth. Great addition. Thanks for the tip

AMAZING!  My first turkey was last year, and I used this recipe.  Bird didn't LOOK great, but was sooo tender and tasted amazing- family RAVED.  This year, I followed the directions, but took the foil off the last hour and browned it...turkey was SUPER tender, and dark and lovely.  SOOO thrilled with this and it couldn't be easier!  15lb turkey cooked 4 hours covered and one hour uncovered.  YUMMY!!!!!!!

Excellent!  This was my very first attempt at a Thanksgiving turkey, and this recipe didn't disappoint!  Followed ingredients to a T....basted a few times while cooking, and also used my injector to inject juices into the turkey while cooking as well.  Thanks!

I was skeptical when making this but it turned out great!  I even made gravy from the drippings and it tasted awesome.  The turkey was super moist.  Be sure to remoive the foil 45 mins before the end of cooking time so the bird gets brown.  Super moist and flavorful.

Came out great! My first turkey and it was nice and moist. I did cook my 13.5lb turkey at 325 instead and it took almost 5 1/2 hours. Not sure why it took so long but it may not have been fully defrosted. Simple and easy to make!

I didn't have any parsley, so I used 1 Tbls. dried thyme instead. I also added 1/2 Tbls. garlic powder. The turkey turned out SO moist and delicious! The gravy was also very tasty! :)

Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe. It was my very first time cooking Thanksgiving and I received a lot of compliments on my turkey. I had a 20.64 pound turkey. I basically doubled everything except for the seasoning salt. I added onions and celery to the cavity and cooked it in an oven bag. It cooked a lot faster and my turkey was very moist! Even the leftovers were still moist. The broth left from the turkey made wonderful gravy. Everybody was pretty impressed. Once again, thank you for giving me an opportunity to have a successful thanksgiving.

This turned out very well.  Moist and flavorful.  In the future, I'd shorten cooking time and use less water/broth, but this recipe still turned out with raves at our Thanksgiving table.

Thanksgiving 2010 - used this recipe on a 13.5 lb turkey, it was very easy and the bird came out beautifully.  Wife said it may have been the best turkey she's ever had.  I was a little concerned when I saw the instructions on the turkey packaging said in highlighted letters "Do not cover turkey, do not add water", but I steeled myself to the task at hand and followed this recipe's instructions anyway.  Glad I did.  Thanks!

I tried this one for my very first turkey at Thanksgiving!  It was a huge hit!  Absolutely wonderful! I cooked mine in a bag and after pouring the broth over, I sprinkled with Turkey Rub but left all other ingredients the same per the directions.  Yummy!

This turkey was great and super easy. The only modifications that I made were: 1. I brined the turkey for about 14 hours before roasting it and 2. I stuffed it with celery, onions and lemon wedges for a bit of extra flavor. The turkey I used was 13 pounds and the cooking time listed in this recipe was right on. The turkey came out SUPER moist and was really flavorful. It was a hit with the family (even the dog). The only negative I noticed was that I was not able to use the drippings for gravy as they were incredibly salty. Instead, I used a gravy packet mix and added about a tablespoon of the drippings for some flavor. I will definitely use this recipe in the future. It was so easy and delicious.

I made this today for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was wonderful! The butter stuffed under the skin makes a huge difference. It was super juicy! I added some chopped celery, onions, and carrots in the pan with the broth for a more flavorful gravy. DELICIOUS! Thanks for posting!!

I made this for my very 1st Thanksgiving dinner and it came out perfectly!  My whole family loved it!  I went to my future in-laws last year and made this turkey for them and they loved it!  Best turkey ever!  It's so moist and perfectly browned.  I don't even baste it and it comes out great!  I use about a stick of butter total all over the bird, that way all the meat it moist.  So glad I found this recipe!

I never knew I could cook until I found this turkey recipe (and the turkey brine recipe also on this site).  Now I always make a delicious, moist, perfectly browned turkey.  Be warned, if you serve this turkey for Thanksgiving, you'll be asked to host every year.  I don't stuff it, instead use the Apple Pecan cornbread dressing (also on this website) for the perfect feast.

This turkey was amazingly wonderful!!! The best turkey I have ever had and deep fried turkey was my favorite. I altered it slightly by cutting slits all over the top and stuffed the slits with butter and fresh garlic. So much flavor!

The dark meat was very moist, but the breast meat was dry (less dry than the recipe I grew up with, but still not moist) so next time I may try cooking the turkey up-side down.

I was not impressed with this.  The taste was pretty much as expected but my bird was still a tad dry.  They flavor of the seasonings were not as prominent as I would have liked.  Will use a new recipe next holiday season.

Wow, what a great recipe. I cooked an 18 lb turkey with this and (almost) doubled all ingredients except for the salt, which I kept the same. I also rubbed 1/2 the herb/salt mixture under the skin with the butter and sprinkled the other half on the turkey after I poured the chicken stock in. Had wonderful reviews at Christmas dinner. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I have used this recipe 2 years in a row and it has come out SO juicy and delicious both times! Only difference I made was to rub an entire stick of butter under the skin and to add some garlic power and pepper to the salt when sprinkling on the turkey. Only warning I'd have is to know your oven temp (actual, not what it reads) as my finished MUCH sooner than I expected!

First turkey I have ever made, and it turned out really good. I added some baby carrots in the bottom of the pan. I ended up making really good gravy with the juices. Will definitely make this again.

My 2nd ever Turkey and i was so happy with it.  We're in Australia and it was only a small Chritmas so had a 9 pound turkey.  I followed all the instructions and it was perfect, i was so so proud and really enjoyed it.  I served with Mashed potatoes, gravy which was awesome and a Balsamic mediteranian raosted vege salad.  It was all perfect, the hardest thing was cutting veges.  I will absolutely use this as my Turkey recipe, keep my American husband happy.  Thanks

About 3 years ago I found myself in the unlikely predicament of cooking an entire Thanksgiving meal for 25 people.  I had never cooked a turkey before so the night before Thanksgiving I set out on a search form something easy and yummy... I found it!  Super easy and I got rave reviews. Even from my grandma and her niece who have been doing Thanksgiving for years.  Now I make the turkey every year :)

A wonderful turkey.  I followed the recipe exactly and the turkey was moist and had good flavor.  I may add some veggies to the bird next year but the recipe is top notch as is!

My turkeies came out great this year. Yes, I made two of them this year. One we prep the turkey as the recipe stated. The other one we just buttered & seasoned the whole turkey the night before without the water. Both came out great. Very moist. Will definitely be using this recipe again next year and many years after.

This was the first time I ever attempted making a turkey. I saw that this recipe had great ratings and looked fairly easy to do. My husband and family all LOVED this turkey. It was super moist and had great flavor. I was so happy that I was able to make a great tasting turkey on my first attempt.

This was my first year having thanksgiving dinner at our house, and my first time cooking a turkey! I have to say, this was the easiest recipe to follow and the turkey turned out great! I brined it over night in kosher salt, sugar and black pepper; and cooked it in an oven bag to speed things up. The taste was amazing and even the breast was nice and juicy! Everyone was impressed with my first turkey and left feeling pretty plump!

Everyone raved! It was only the 2nd time I have ever cooked a turkey and it was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe said, except for rubbing butter on the whole top side of the bird before baking. It made it nice a golden brown.

Simple and wonderful roast turkey recipe!  The breast meat was so moist and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I was able to make a really delicious gravy out of the pan drippings too, probably a result of the chicken/onion basting broth.  This was the yummiest turkey I've ever roasted and the best part was that it was sooooooooo easy!  No excessive ingredients or complicated steps necessary.

Really good!!! Threw a few mandarins sliced in half inside the turkey(because i had them and it just seemed empty). Put a little less seasoning salt cuz it seemed like alot. My daughter had 3 Thanksgivings and said this was the best turkey :)

The temperature listed was too high and the bird was dried out by the time I took the foil off. My in-laws had to drown it in gravy to make it edible.

Thank you so much!  I grew up and brought with me the love of michigan cooking, to california when I got married. This recipe is so close ot my mothers I had to try it out.  I chopped onions, celery and APPLES to fill my turkey then insted of making the broth in a pan I used my food processer and chopped fresh parsley, onion and garlic with butter to go under the skin. salted the top of the bird, and put the broth over a few times as it baked at 350! I was so impressed how well it turned out. JUST LIEK MOMMA! she'd be proud. Now only if i could get her to give up cold winters and move to the beach ;)

I followed this recipe for Thanksgiving, with my first turkey I've ever made & everyone LOVED it! It was so delicious and tender, not dried out like most turkeys are. I also injected the turkey two times with its own drippings. It was great! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

Great recipe.  Turkey came out juicy.  Used it on a 17 lb bird, cooked it with stuffing for 5 hours for 350, basted it frequently with the bouillon onion parsley and wter mixture. Delicious.

Very good and super easy!  If you like a heavily seasoned turkey, this isn't for you.  If you like a juicy, simple turkey - this is it.

I also bought a 21 lb bird and found the advice of BMDSINGLE very helpful as far as the cooking time. I started out roasting it for an hour under 375 degrees, then cut back the temp to 350 and roasted for another 5 hours until internal temp reached 165. Since I don't make homemade gravy I wouldn't use nearly as much chicken broth, and I also sprinkled salt and pepper in addition to the other seasonings. I lightly covered the turkey in foil for the whole time up until the last 40 minutes when I removed it to let it brown. This turkey was my first ever and it was a huge success!! Thank you so much for the recipe!!

When my mother-in-law told us she was going out of town this year for Thanksgiving, my first thought was to either take our family to a restaurant or to buy pre-cooked food to bring in.  I decided to give cooking a turkey a try, and this was the turkey recipe I selected.  It was fantastic!  The only thing I added was something I saw someone do on tv.  After putting the butter between the skin and the breast, I put a mixture of olive oil, salt, basil, and celery salt.  Everything else was exactly according to recipe.  It was delicious, tender, juicy, and literally did practically fall off the bone!  Thanks!

This recipe is the best turkey I have ever made. Follwed the directions exactly and the flavor was perfect. I roasted at 325 Deg. and then went to 350 Deg. for the last hour but that is the only difference. Everyone LOVED this. I will use this recipe from now on.

I made this with a few changes recently.  I used a 6 1/2 lb. turkey breast in a 6 qt. slow cooker.  In spite of me, it stayed moist and tender.  (I forgot about it and left it on high for 5 hours)  It was ready way before the meal was, but stayed great!  The left over didn't last long either.  This is how I plan on making the Thanksgiving bird, too.  Excellent!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Since I was born and raisied in Michigan, this is the only way I've ever cooked a turkey (was taught to do it this way by both my Grandmother and Mom).  The only thing I've done differently, was add a little garlic powder and a dash of black pepper with the seasoning salt.  I've also always  buttered the outside of the skin (comes out moist and delicious every time), but I never thought to put butter under the skin before.  I think this Thanksgiving I will do just that...sounds wonderful, Robin!

I've never cooked a turkey before and this was the best recipe ever.  I got so many compliments that I've been asked again to make the turkey.  I did substitute chicken broth for the water and bouillon.  It was delicious and moist.

I have to give this a million stars! I was soo great. My sister-n-law made the turkey for Thanksgiving but I love to cook and I got a free turkey from the store so i decided to make my 1st turkey. It turned out amazing! My fiance loved it and begged my to bring it to his sisters. I did just for him and of course she got made because everybody loved mine and not her plain dry "roaster crock pot" turkey. My fiance was so proud and happy that his "new" wife could cook so well especially for her 1st turkey. This is a forever keeper.

I found this recipe last year for christmas. My husband and I wanted to do a big christmas for a bunch of our friends and neither of us has even done anything like this before. This turkey was the BEST turkey we, and our friends, have ever had!!! It was so easy to make and it will definitly become THE turkey we make.

I made this for two Christmas' in a row and it's perfect.  My 12-13 pound turkeys cook faster, so I had to fix the time last year so I'd have a presentation turkey :)  I use the low-sodium broth and no salt on the bird.  The butter makes the breast so succulent and I never liked the white meat before this.

I've made this twice now and it's perfect each time.  My husband likes a dry turkey (go figure?) so he thought it was too moist.  Everyone else thought it was fantastic!  Very flavorful.  The second time, I added some italian seasoning but it's fine as is.

After all the years of making turkeys with the family, THIS is the recipe we will be keeping. So much extra great liquid too for gravy, we didnt even have to salt or pepper the gravy!! Amazing.  I didnt have mincd onion in house so I used onion salt and then cut down my seasoning salt a little. I did prepare in a turkey bag rather than just a roaster pan and worked perfectly.

This was a very delicious turkey!  We all really enjoyed it and I am not usually very fond of turkey.  The only thing that I did a little differently was divide the parsley, minced onion, and salt in half and put half under the skin with the butter and mixed the other half with the water and bouillon as the recipe called.  It was very good!!

Followed recipe exactly.  WOW!!  We served this at our New Year's party.  My man had won a 19 lb turkey in a turkey shoot, and it was taking up space in the freezer so I planned the party menu around it. (If you've never been to a turkey shoot, you fire at targets, not turkeys. They give frozen ones as prizes.)Did not have to baste at all, and guests all said it was the best turkey they had ever had!  Thanks so much!

YUM YUM YUM.  I'm not even a turkey fan.  My husband is an instructor in the Navy and a few of his students came for Thanksgiving.  SEVERAL of them commented on how juicy and flavorful the turkey was.  Will cook it like this every year from now on.

I've made this 3 times now and all 3 times came out FANTASTIC!  I had only cooked a turkey once before, and it was dry and not very palitable.  There were 2 turkeys at the Thanksgiving party I atteneded, and all that was left of mine was bones - while the other was barely touched!

Turkey on Thanksgiving Day turned out moist and tender - just wonderful. The only problem I encountered was the drippings were way too salty for making gravy.

WOW...The butter trick was slick. Had the in-laws over for xmas dinner. I added old bay seasoning instead of the seasonall salt,but followed everything to a tee, presto! the timer button popped out right in front of me as I was pulling this very moist bird from the oven. Will use this recipe from now on.

I used this recipe for game hens. I have to say that they were the best game hens ever! I cut four game hens in half and placed them in a large baking pan. I melted the butter in the broth and poured it over the game hens. I didn't need to use all of the broth for the hens so I used it for my stuffing. For the stuffing I added one more stick of butter and little chicken broth. I seasoned it with sage and then baked it, covered, in the oven. Everything turned out very tasty and moist. Great recipe!

I usually only like my turkey deep-fried, but I must say, this is THE BEST turkey I have ever had. My entire family said the same! An excellent recipe that needs no modifications.It looks like my turkey fryer might be getting retired!

WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Im 30 years old and I got the chance to make the turkey for the first time ever this christmas. Ive never made one so i wanted to make one that was off the chain so as to please my family. They were a little woried that since it was the first time i've ever made one as to how well it would come out. Well, at the end of the day they all concluded that from now on i would be the official turkey maker, lol.
 I did manage to fill the house completely up with smoke though, because the pan i used to put the turkey in wasn't big enough to hold the chicken water in when it started to boil over. After the fog was cleared out my family was a little more concerened that this turkey would bust. Thankfully all their worries were relieved after they put the first piece in their mouth. 
 Thank you ALLRECIPES.COM. You have onced again made me look like a great cook

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I made my first turkey ever using this recipe and I LOVED it! My husband and brother-in-law don't usually like turkey, but they raved about this turkey! I also added some minced garlic cloves and saffron into the water/bouillon mixture. I will use this recipe from now on!

This was the most amazing turkey I have ever made! I do not like white meat as it's usually so dry but wow this time - was incredibly moist. I did have to add more stock halfway through as it evaporated - probably into the bird! Thanks very much for posting this recipe.

Mix butter with garlic powder to make a paste. Use 1 to 1.5 sticks of butter, rub under all skin Sprinkle seasoned salt after liquid is poured I added 1 tsp. garlic powder to the water along with the bouillon (use 1 TBSP), parsley and onion. Put fresh rosemary under the breast skin with the butter. Also placed a quartered lemon and quartered onion inside the cavity. Used a 12 lb. bird as recommended and it was done in 3.5 hours. Allowed it to rest 20 minutes before carving. Be sure to spray the foil with cookong spray. Use shallots instead of dried onion. Absolutely unbelievebale!! Christmas Dinner 08 THANK YOU!

My BF thought I'd lost my mind when I volunteered to make Thanksgiving dinner for his family of 15 adults and 6 kids... I'm a pretty good cook, but had never made a turkey before and this recipe made me look like a turkey pro!  I did it in a roasting bag and probably didn't baste as often as I should've, just cause ther was so much else going on, but it didn't matter.  There were NO LEFTOVERS from a 25# bird!  I had to make a small breast a few days later since he was so disappointed to not have any turkey leftover for sandwiches and such.  And that came out great too.  This was my first attempt at turkey and I will never make it another way!

This was my first try at a turkey and it was the best turkey I can ever remember having!  It was juicy and tender, all the way through.  Leaving the foil off for the last hour gave it a nice, browned skin.  Instead of putting the butter in the breasts, I cooked it breast side down and put the butter in the thighs.  The butter seemed to melt down into the breasts.  What is normally the driest part of the turkey was soooo moist!  I was blessed to use this recipe as my first try - my family agrees!

Came out very good, very simple.

This was the first turkey I've ever done 
myself. We used more butter and baked in a bag but I think next time I would skip the bag and baste it.

I read through a lot of the member suggestions and used less season salt as well. The meat literally fell off the bone, the legs and wings virtually disintegrated into the mixture at the bottom of the pan and was very moist.

This was the best turkey ever!  For the first time I convinced my mom to try something different on Thanksgiving this year instead of her throw the turkey in a bag and let it roast.  She was skeptical at first because she thought her turkey always turned out "just fine," but then when it was done perfectly brown and the juices ran out with the first slice she changed her mind and my dad said "It sure does look juicey!"  We will be making our Thanksgiving turkey this way all the years to come.

This was a really great turkey. I used an 8lb bone in turkey breast instead of a whole turkey because my family really only likes the breast meat anyway. I didn't change anything except that I used an oven bag instead of the foil. Came out perfectly golden brown and moist!

I combined this recipe with the Easy Herb Roasted Turkey, and it was perfect. I put the butter under the skin, but then I used olive oil, basil and garlic as a rub before I oput the turkey in the oven. It was a hit!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It came out so moist and delicious!  My husband said that when he was a kid he had to drink glasses and glasses of milk to 'choke down' all the dry turkey he had to eat.  He never once got out of his seat for a second beverage with this bird.  Thanks for such a terrific recipe!

This was the best turkey I have cooked. I was a little afraid of changing the way I have cooked a turkey for years, but now I'm glad I did. To get tons of drippings for gravy, I cooked the turkey in a bag, plus put water in the pan the turkey was in. That saves any juice from drying up. Thanks!!

This turkey was amazing! ESP the gravy! I wish I added more broth to get more gravy! Only problem was the bottom of the turkey wasn't cooked entirely (not sure why?) and I'm wondering if it's because I didn't use a rack in the aluminium pan so the turkey was sitting in the juices and broth, OR because I had to put a large pizza tray underneath the aluminum pan to support it. The breast was so moist yummmmmy!!!

Wow, is all I can say.. This was the first turkey recipes I ever tried, and my first turkey, for that matter. It was so easy to follow, and my turkey turned out delicious, my fiance LOVED it, and his father is a professional chef. The turkey was not dry, at all, in fact it was incredibly moist, I did adjust the cooking temperature to slightly lower than suggested, and cooked it for about 30 minutes more, overall this is a fantastic recipe for beginners!

We used this recipe when making our turkey for Thanksgiving this year and I have to say, best turkey I've ever tasted! I'm usually a dark meat person because white meat tends to be dry.  Even then I usually have to drown it in gravy.  Not the case with this turkey.  I did follow the recipe and didn't change anything.

This was my first Thanksgiving cooking and this recipe turned out great.  However, next time I will leave out the seasoning salt.  This time I halved it based upon previous reviews and it still left my gravy very salty.  I shoved lots of butter under the skin.  Also, I don't know if it was my oven or roasting pan, but I ended up pouring 3 cans of chicken broth in into the bottom of the pan throughout the roasting time because all the drippings kept burning/drying up.  All in all, a great recipe!

After 10 years of cooking our holiday dinners and trying out new recipes the search is finally over for the perfect turkey! Everyone raved that this was the best and most moist turkey the have ever tasted in their lives. My mother in law even stole the recipe on her way out. I used a Butterball turkey that was already brined (most Butterballs are) and followed the directions almost exactly. The only change I made was to cut down a little on the chicken bouillon to 2 T since it seemed a little much and stuffed the bird with a peeled/cored apple which is supposed to help keep it moist. The  drippings made a perfect gravy as is by just thickening it with Wondra and water. Perfect and easy...definitely try this one!

Ive never made a whole turkey, and I decided to use this recipe...And boy was I glad I did! It was absolutely perfect. The only slight alterations I made were 1)I used a little more butter than it called for and buttered the whole bird, as well poured some into the breast meat. (I did this buy holding the bird upright and pouring melted butter into the space between the skin and breast). 2)I used chicken broth instead of bouillon diluted with warm water. And
3)I added a little dry vermouth to the cavity as well as the broth, and finally, 4) I chopped a whole red onion, some celery, and fresh herbs and put them into the cavity. I believe the fresh herbs defintely made a big difference.

A~maaa~zing!                            I have never enjoyed white meat from my turkey before. I could't stop complimenting myself! My guests enjoyed as well ;) This is my new, one and only way to prepare turkey dinner!

I'd really like to give this 4 1/2 stars.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it makes the most beautiful turkey I've ever seen.  As others have said, the meat was as moist as any turkey I've ever had.  My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that I really thought it didn't have quite enough flavor.  Next time I might combine this with the Rosemary Turkey recipe to see if it will be just a little more flavorful.  I will definitely use this recipe again in the future!

I decided to use this because of all the reviews and they were right.  This was my first turkey and it was perfect.  My pickiest eater loved it and my fiance went on and on about it.  He said it was so much better than the turkey we had at his family's Thanksgiving. Will Definitely do again and again.

So I am not much of a cook, and this year I decided to attempt my own Thanksgiving dinner for my closest friends. I decided to try this recipe and i cant believe how well this turned out! My boyfriend said it was the juiciest turkey he's ever had. He was surprised with how well it turned out. I just want to say THANKS! With all the compliments I will definitely use this again!

This was my first time hosting Thanksgiving dinner as well as my first time ever cooking a turkey. I choose this recipe based on member reviews and simplicity. I baked an 18lb turkey and it turned out great! I (being a beginner cook) followed the directions word for word and the turkey was moist, well flavored and my guests loved it! I did have to bake my turkey a bit longer then what the recipe stated but that was due to it being 6lbs larger then what the recipe called for. I would highly recommend this recipe (especially to beginner cooks like myself). Excellent recipe, thanks!

This is absolutely the best turkey I've ever had.  Served at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from everyone.  The butter makes the turkey very  moist - even the leftovers are moist.  I always cook just a turkey breast but followed the recipe exactly as written except I cooked the turkey in a roaster and used the lid instead of foil.  Will be the way I prepare turkey from now on!!!

Well, I  thought it was time for a new review... I used this recipe 4 years ago to make my first Thanksgiving turkey as a new mom... it was my duty right?  I had no idea what I was doing and for as long as I can remember I have hated turkey... it's always too dry and no flavor! So anywho, I used this recipe, followed it completely  but I also rubbed the entired turkey with butter... and let me tell you... this is by far the best turkey I have ever had. I was so proud of my first Thanksgiving turkey I cried! Haha!  The next year we invited both our parents over, my mom, who also hates turkey... loved it and my boyfriends parents are somewhat picky eaters, after eating the turkey and all the other goodies, his mother decided she was passing the tradition of hosting Thanksgiving on to me!  So, this is the 4th year I have used this recipe, haven't changed a thing... and it turns out perfect year after year!  I can't thank you enough for sharing your recipe, Robin... I sure am putting it to good use... plus... it makes me kinda proud to to be using it... my Dad is from Michigan.  I talked to him a few weeks ago and told him all about your recipe... and it's name! :)  Happy Thanksgiving!

I'm not sure why, but the breast meat was not as juicy as I had hoped after reading the other reviews. In the end, it still tasted good. Will try again and hope for more success in the recipe.

Made this turkey for Thanksgiving this year and you would have thought I was a professional! I put it in a roaster oven at 300 for 7 hours and it was perfect! Oh, this was a 19lb turkey! mmmmmmmm, my mom says my dad hasn't stopped talking about my Thanksgiving dinner!

Juicy, flavorful, easy to do. I did an 18 lb turkey and just use the thermometer for time (4.5 hrs in my case) Otherwise keep everything the same.

Super moist. The juices and butter were just running out of the breast when we were cutting it. No one could believe that I didn't cook the breast down. Highly recommend!

This is a great, easy way to make turkey. I used 4 sticks of butter under the skin because I had a 20 lb bird. I bake this in an oven bag instead of covering with foil and add Lipton's onion soup mix to the bag before adding chicken broth. I also add some thyme and rosemary to the butter before putting it under the skin. I've made this as the recipe calls as well as with my additions, and it is awesome either way!

This was my first Thanksgiving and I made this turkey. I had so many compliments you would have thought I had made this a million times.   I did change the recipe just a little based on the comments of others.  

I had a 22lbs turkey, so I basted it every 30 mins. I also added an apple to the inside just for the aroma. Then I added rosemary, sage, and thyme under the skin with my butter. Thank you for the recipe!

This was my first time hosting Thanksgiving.  I was nervous about how to prepare the turkey, but this recipe was easy to do and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was added a little extra extra virgin olive oil over the top before baking.  It was so good!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will use this every time I make a turkey

Delicious! We carved out turkey about 1 1/2 hours before dinner and put it into the crockpot with the juices. It turned out very moist!

This turkey turned out so moist and juicy it fell off the bone!! This was my first year baking a turkey and thanks to these ideas it was a perfect success!!

I never would have thought about putting the butter under the skin and it was the best idea yet!  

I did the butter, and added the seasonings plus some ground mustard.  The only thing different is that I did use an oven bag as well.  

Thank you for these great ideas!!!

THIS MAKES FOR AN AWESOME TURKEY!! VERY JUICY!!  BUT...  I USED THIS RECIPE IN CONJUNCTION WITH " APPLE BRINE FOR TURKEY THE NIGHT BEFORE COOKING"-- SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW MY TURKEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH JUST THIS RECIPE ALONE!! GREAT FLAVOR, MADE GREAT GRAVY!!  AFTER BRINING AND COOKING MY TURKEY COULD NOT BE MOVED!! HE WAS FALLING APART- NEXT ONE I WILL PROBABLY TRUSS UP!! KEEP IN MIND IF YOU DO THE BRINING THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT YOUR TURKEY WILL COOK UP TO AN HOUR QUICKER- MAKES IT HARD TO JUDGE WHEN YOUR LAST 45 MINUTES OR SO ARE TO BROWN YOUR TURKEY- TRY IT YOU'LL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!!!

I served this at this years Thanksgiving to a large group including several great cooks as well as new friends and got a unanimous "BEST TURKEY EVER" !!!
I rarely follow a recipe as written (like the 99% of ALLRECIPE reviewers) but I did on this one and it was easy, moist, tender, and flavorful.
GREAT RECIPE !!!

This recipe was very good. Don't make the same mistake we did though ... be careful when separating the skin from the breast meat. Ours tore easily and we had to kind of doctor it up. Also, the dripping made good gravy for the potatoes!

I made this today and while it turned out delicious, it took five hours instead of four to cook for 16-pound turkey.  That kind of threw a wrench in my other food plans.  However, the taste, etc., was wonderful and everyone said it was delicious.  I would make it again now that I know it will take five hours.

Wheew, I can now breathe easy! Turkeys done and it was great, everyone loved it and I have a family full of critics. This was my first time making a turkey and let me tell you I was nervous that it wouldnt turn out right. I looked at a bunch of recipes and talked to different people but when I read this I knew it was It. Anyway I added a couple things; I stuffed the bird with 1 onion, a orange, and celery all chopped up. I also basted it like 4 or 5 times. It was super moist and falling off the bone, that is actually a quote from my father in law. lol great recipe thanks

I feel unquailified to rate this recipe since this was my very first turkey.  But with the way that my husband has been raving about it for two days, I think it was a hit and I'm sure it had nothing to do with my skills or the turkey which my MIL got for free at the grocery store.  (I'm not even sure the thing had a brand name on it.)  Thank you for such an easy stress free day!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and I followed this recipe exactly except the few changed.  I used a 20 lb turkey and I cooked it on 325. I didn't use the foil right away. I basted the turkey about every 45 minutes with the juices and when the turkey was browned I then foiled it. After that I continued to baste it every hour until the timer popped. For a 20 lb turkey it took me 4.5 hours to cook on 325. The turkey then sat for 20 minutes before I carved it. There was probably 7 cups of juice in the bottom of the pan. Some I used to make gravy and the rest I froze to use later.  Let me say this was the best turkey I've had by far. it was delicious.  The breast meat was so moist and juicy. This recipe will be a new family favorite for Thanksgiving. Thank you so much for sharing!

I've always made my turkey in a bag for moistness.  I decided to try this recipe for this Thanksgiving.  Wonderful!!!  Everybody complimented on how moist it was.  We will be making our turkey like this from now on.  The turkey was falling off the bone but not the least bit dry.  In fact, it was more moist than when I used the bag method.

This was my first turkey and it was wonderful.  I had a 14 lb and it took about 3.5 hours.  I left foil off for last 45 minutes.  It was very tender and everyone loved it.  The only addition I made was I added rosemary and minced garlic.

I tried this out on a turkey roast for Thanksgiving since it was only my husband and I (no need for a big turkey) - the flavor was amazing! I just rubbed a little margarine on the roast and followed the rest of the instructions (scaled back a bit for size) - cooked at 350 for 1 hour, 40 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered to brown - very moist and flavorful! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was using the drippings for gravy - it was way too salty for us.

Followed the recipe exact. Smells great but not sure about taste yet. Easy enough to season the turkey with before cooking. I did use chicken broth instead of bouillion. This came out moist but wasn't quite what I was looking for.

Like most of the reviews, this was my first time making any turkey ever. And the turkey I made was hit!!! Everyone loved how juicy and well-seasoned it was. I did use a turkey oven bag. Less of a clean up.

The turkey was delicious and moist.  All of my guests raved about it. It took about 4 1/2 hours to cook a 12 lb. turkey. The only change I made was that I cooked it on a rack in a large roaster pan.  Also, this recipe makes a wonderful gravy.

Turned out exactly the way a turkey should - moist, savory, and perfectly cooked. There's nothing novel about the recipe, but it is perfect for the traditional turkey.

I have made this recipe several times, and each time the turkey comes out juicy and flavorful.  Also, there is plenty of juice left over to make a ton of gravy.  Delicious!!

Used a 12 lb.turkey and it was done in 3 hours - should have cooked it at 325* like I usually do - that's why it got 4 stars..it ended up a little dry.  I do like the idea of cooking it in the broth, though, and will probably do this again at a lower temp and inject the bird with butter.  I also used homemade garlic butter for extra flavor.  Lots of broth made for lots of gravy, so that was a definite bonus. Definitely a recipe worth revisiting

I've made this recipe the past two years and I love it! Last year it was with a cheap bird and this year with a more expensive Butterball turkey, both turned out wonderful. Something with the legs though, this weird stringy hard cartilage type stuff remains and makes it unpleasant to try and eat the legs. I don't know if it was just the turkey or the way it's cooked, even if it is the way it's cooked the recipe is still worth it for the yummy moist breast meat.

I was hopeful about this recipe but weary because I'm NOT a good cook. But, I made this for our first thanksgiving at our place and it was a hit!  I was afraid to try my own turkey, but my mother-in-law and the sis' new boyfriend both complimented the turkey on how moist it was.  We had little to no leftovers!  Will definitely make next year!

I made this Turkey for Thanksgiving this year.  It was the first Turkey I have ever made.  Well, it smelled real good, looked real good.  But my family did not like it at all.  They say it was tough & dry.  Maybe it was the brand of Turkey I bought?

This Turkey was AWESOME. The only thing i did different was i added about a tsp of garlic salt with the seasoning salt. The drippings also make the best tasting gravy i've ever made. This will definetly be going into my cookbook for next yr and many more Thanksgivings :)

This was the first time in 18 years that I have cooked Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone raved about the turkey.  It was so moist and tastey.  Thanks for sharing.

This was the most moist white meat turkey I've ever had!  And this was my first turkey!  I didn't have dried minced onions so I used onion powder, and I didn't have enough dried parsley so I used rosemary instead.  Incredible and so so so moist!  My white meat was practically falling apart!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

We cooked it in a turkey bag and injected melted butter into the thigh and breast. It was delicious.

A keeper for sure.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to reduce the recipe in 1/2.  I prefer my turkey not to sit immersed in that amount of liquid while it is cooking.  I definitely thought the turkey was  more moist & tasty done this way.

Simple and tasty.  Mine didn't turn out as moist as others raved, but still yummy and so much easier than other recipes I've tried in recent years.  Next year I'll try this recipe again, but cook it in a roasting bag instead of in a roaster tented with foil.

This was the best turkey, moist and perfect and it was just the cheap frozen one.  The difference is the broth, the turkey sits in a steam bath! It was a 20 pound bird, stuffed and only 4 T of  butter under skin. I also basted it every 90 mins.

Great recipe. Moist and delicious. My husband even admitted it was better than his father's, especaily the dark meat where the juices had gathered.

This was an easy and foolproof recipe. I had the oven turned up to 450 on accident for the first 2 hours and, though I don't recommend doing this on purpose, the turkey still turned out tender and moist.

Last year this was a really big hit, but I used a smaller turkey (14 lbs) last year as opposed to this year (17 lbs) This year's bigger turkey didnt turn out as well. This is a great recipe for the smaller turkey. I cook mine in a roaster to keep in the moisture and I lay bacon on the breasts to keep them moist.

This is the 2nd year that I made this turkey.  It has been great both times.  The drippings from the gravy boiled down some.  When I tasted it was salty so I added enough water to make the 4 original cups and then added another glass full.  I also simmered the neck, and other parts and added that broth to the mixture too.  The result was one of the best gravies ever and a LOT of it.  We also buttered the outside of the bird.  It was wonderful.  Thanks!  PS Turkey cooked in Bellaire, MI.

Ok, maybe I overcooked my bird a little, but I figured with all the liquid it wouldn't get dried out, wrong! I did have just a turkey breast and cooked it breast down, I don't know what happened...

PERFECTION!  I usually use the turkey oven bags to ensure not over cooking turkey or having it dry out.  This was the 1st time I achieved perfection with out the bag! Fantastic flavor.

I made this on Thanksgiving 2007 and was pleased. The turkey was moist and juicy. The only thing I did differntly was use a creole butter injection in addition to following the recipe. I have to tell you though,cooking turkey this way yeilds plenty of gravy.The gravy was just crazy good and there was plenty to go around. I also used a 18lb. turkey.

This recipe isn't really anything special because all the seasonings and spices aren't absorbed by the meat--they stay on the skin and no one eats the skin.  The bird was moist however and the pan drippings made delicious gravy.  Bottom line: this recipe isn't anything special.

This is part of our new family tradition.  The only thing I realized that I was doing wrong is that I doubled everything for a larger turkey.  In the future I won't add as much juice.

Used the Michigander recipe this Thanksgiving and the turkey turned out dry, bland and the skin wasn't crispy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Was very disappointed...

This turkey was moist and flavorful, and very pretty thanks to the parsley.  I thought I had dried onion on hand, but didn't, so I just used minced fresh onion and stuffed the rest of it in the cavity.  I had a cup of leftover chicken broth in the fridge so I used that along with some water and "Better than Boullion".  I made this for my family's own little Thanksgiving feast today.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought I didn't like turkey until I tried this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was after putting the butter under the breast skin, I rubbed the whole turkey down with another stick of butter.  I did not use a rack in my roasting pan and I generously peppered the whole turkey before covering with foil.

Very tasty and easy way to cook the Thanksgiving bird. Thanks so much for sharing! My husband insisted I use a cooking bag... but in previous years I have had good success with the aluminum foil tent... sprayed with cooking oil so the skin didn't stick to it. I accidentally used only 2 cups of warm water and had plenty of juices to make the gravy. I don't think I will use 4 cups next time with a bag, as it might be too much. I also quartered an onion to put in the cavity. I also had a 14.8lb bird, which I cooked at 350 for 3.5 hours and the bird was already at 200 degrees, and a little more browned on the top than I would have preferred, but it was probably from the bag. Next time I will check it much sooner. The juices from this turkey made an awesome gravy, which I hardly had to season at all.

This was a wonderful turkey. I found that it works very well and becomes extremely moist in an oven bag. I need to remember not to use butter when cooking for my family as my niece is allergic to milk products!

Very good, very easy for a first time turkey!  It was recommended I use an oven bag for my first time, so I did, and cut the broth to one cup and put that into the bag with the bird.  It was ready in 3 hours, and very, very moist.

My husband raved and raved about this! He said I should always cook the turkey this way. One thing we did also was to not open the oven once until cooking was done. The turkey was moist and had a great flavor.

MMMMMM!I've made this turkey twice, and both times it turned out delicious. I added some seasoning to the butter this time, but oh it's so good! The chicken stock on the bottom makes it so moist, and the gravy is perfect. Great recipe, will never use another.

Everyone complimented how good it was. Meat was tender and juicy. I did increase ingredients a little because I was using a 18 pound turkey.

This is THE BEST! I have made more turkeys than I can count, but none have been better than this one.  No need to brine, no need to roast upside down, no need to baste.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect and EASY!  Obviously the large amount of liquid combined with the tightly foiled pan allows the bird to be extraordinarily moist and tender. I took the foil off for the last 45 minutes of cooking and the skin browned up beautifully.  Thank you Robin, for making this and all future Thanksgivings easy and stress-free!

This was the best turkey I have made by far. It had a very classic, almost retro taste and look to it. So simple, yet so tasty.  

My modifications: I brined the turkey overnight, eyeballed the amounts of spice rather than using the recipes' exact amount, stuffed the cavity w/onion & thyme, and started the roasting process by sprinkling a little bit of light flavored olive oil on the breast and placing it uncovered in 500 degree oven for 1/2 hour. **This, along with the recipe made for a PREFECTLY browned bird.** I then covered it in foil and lowered the temp to 350 for the duration of the cooking time. 

It was really moist and tasty. SO AWESOME!!

Very good and the stock made great gravy.  I will reduce the stock by 1/2 next time, at least.  Use the extra to baste with.  If you put 4 cups of stock in the pan with the turkey, it destroys any stuffing you might have put inside.  So glad I had extra dressing to cook seperately.  I would also put the dry ingredients into the turkey roaster and then add the stock.  Otherwise, a lot of it sticks to the inside of the measuing cup.

Second year in a row - still successful!  This was the best turkey. I even read the recipe wrong and used only 6 Tbsp butter for a 20 pound turkey, but add more of the other stuff and it worked out so great and was still so tender.  It was awesome!  Thanks!

Beautiful, juicy turkey!  I brined the 16 lb turkey overnight.  Used the exact recipe but added aromatics to the inside of the turkey.  Baked in 3 1/2 hours at 350.  Will definitely use this one again, maybe even in the crockpot with a turkey breast for a weeknight dinner.

OH MY GOSH this made the most moist turkey breast I have EVER had.  This was my first Thanksgiving to ever cook a turkey and it came out SO awesome!  The only thing I did differently was to cook it breast down, and then flipped it breast up for those last 45 minutes to let it brown.  The skin wasn't super crispy, but the moist and tender breast was so worth that! Thanks a bunch!

I'm on my second turkey of the weekend...wow! I really like this recipe. And it's really very basic. I do lower the heat to 325, but that's just personal preference. I roasted a turkey breast last night so there would be "leftovers" for sandwiches, and I have a whole turkey in right now. The breast meat is very moist and flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at turkey and turned out great! I used a vegetable bullion instead of chicken and fresh chopped onion. My father even commented that it was better than my grandmother's turkey. A+!

AMAZING!!!  First time to make a turkey and I'm glad I picked this recipe!  I followed the recipe, but I also rubbed butter all over the turkey and every 30 minutes I covered it in it's it's own juices.

I adjusted this recipe for a 15-lb turkey and made this for Thanksgiving last month. It was the first time I ever cooked turkey, and it was delicious and juicy! Everyone raved about it, even my cousin who doesn't care for turkey. I used the juices to baste occasionally, and it turned out beautifully. Would definitely make it again.

Made for a Christmas gathering and it was excellent!  I did add garlic powder for a little extra flavor. Very tasty!

This was my first time to cook Thanksgiving and this was the best Turkey I have ever had.  My entire family loved the turkey and the leftovers were even better.  I am having a party this week and will be baking another Michigander turkey! YUMMY!

Great recipe!  We used this for Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderful.  I put half of an onion inside the turkey (I also would have added half a lemon as others have suggested, but we didn't have one around the house).  The gravy was also great with lots of flavor.  Thanks!

Wow! This really is a delicious way to prepare turkey.  I didn't believe it when I read the other reviews, that it could really be that moist and falling off the bone.  It was!  Perfect.  This will be the way I prepare my turkey every year.  Yum!!!!

This was my first ever attempt at making thanksgiving dinner.  This turkey recieved top star ratings from everyone at the table! Because i had a large bird i doubled the recipe.  The turkey was literally falling off the bones.  I did add garlic powder and used real butter.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used this to make my first ever Thanksgiving turkey.  The smell of it cooking was to-die for! I don't even like turkey but sure loved it when cooked with this recipe!  My husband and I have been married for 6 years and he finally got me to make a turkey - he said it was the best he has ever had.  The leftovers made wonderfully tasty sandwiches too!  Thanks again!

This was me and my husband's first turkey. It was a great success. The meat was very juicy and tender. I never had turkey meat that was so moist and tender like this one. We will sure make it again. We used chicken broth instead of chicken bouilon and warm water.

My sister and I made this for thanksgiving. Our first turkey and it was a huge hit.  My 80 year old grandmother said it was the best turkey she's ever had.  My mother in law carved it and said shes never seen such a moist turkey before in her life.

This was an excellent recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add some black pepper to the seasonings on top of the turkey. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely use this one again!

This was yummy - I had a 15 lb turkey.  It took me exactly 4 hours for the turkey to be done and perfect!
Great recipe.  I stuffed my turkey and it worked well with the stuffing.   I made the pumkin stuffing off this site and the turkey juices made it yummy!

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. Just what I was looking for. I followed the recipe but I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. I normally cut the turkey up before serving it so I  cooked it in the pan breast side down. It's a tip my mom taught me that helps the breast meat stay moist. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

As a native Michigander, now living in the South, I just HAD to try this recipe for my family last year (bringing a little Midwest-flavor to the table).  It was spectacular, loved by everyone!  The center of our Thanksgiving dinner will be our turkey again this year -- the Michigander Way.  Thank you for sharing this receipe with all of us!

This was good old fashion cooking and a make again in my home. The smell thru the house was amazing and reminds me of my mother's cooking when I was a kid. When I make a turkey again, using this recipe. My husband said that he was nervous with me cooking a turkey, but said it turned out perfect. Thanks again....

This turned out great.  I added more seasonings, less salt & used this as a guide since it was my first turkey.  The trouble for me was keeping that and all the sides warm at the same time! Thanks-Gobble Gobble !

I don't know what I did wrong but my turkey came out salty and water logged! Even after the button popped and I gave it another 1/2 hour in the oven it still did not taste done. Maybe I'm just not used to tender, salty, overly moist turkey. I gave it 3 stars though because my husband thought the dark meat was pretty good.  Might try it again but not for a while.

This was easy, but not easy enough though, because mine came out dry.  Could be due to my oven.  Overall good, but not perfection.

This was absolutely delicious!  One thing, when making the gravy using the juices of the turkey, BE SURE to skim off all the grease from the top.  Delicious!

My first turkey.  Came out juicy, and a beautiful brown skin.  The meat was so tender the wings fell off when it was lifted out of the roasting pan.  Use a very large roasting pan, because lots of liquids are involved here and will spill over smoking up the kitchen if you aren't careful.  Perfect otherwise.

This was my first year of fixing Thanksgiving dinner all by myself with no dishes being brought by realatives.  The turkey was a smash hit!!  I used a 20qt roaster and the meat fell of the bone.  Thank you so much!!

Only average at best.  I made this for my first Thanksgiving as a newlywed for my 16 family members, and while it was good, it wasn't great.  Granted, the Turkey was moist, but the outside wasn't as pretty and was a little drier than I would have liked it to be.

This was incredible! The turkey was so moist. It rocked. There are plenty of juices left over to make gravy...but the gravy does look more like chicken gravy...pretty light in color, but who cares??

This made my Turkey so moist! It was great! I will definitley be making my turkey this way forever! I did make my own adjustments...I didn't have minced onion, I used onion powder, I used turkey broth in a can instead of the water mixed with boullion. And all in all this STILL turned out AWESOME!

The turkey was excellent.  The only problem I had was that the gravy I made from the drippings was MUCH too salty!  Luckily, I had a few jars (ugh) in the cupboard.  Will definitely use the recipe again, but next time low salt bouillon or chicken broth instead.

I tried this recipe yesterday to cook my turkey since I was invited to another place for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday.  Wow, my turkey turned out great!  My husband and 11 years old daughter loved this turkey.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful, tender, juicy turkey! It took exactly 3 1/2 hours for my 12 lb bird. I marinated the turkey a few hours prior to the cooking time and left it in the refrigerator. Yum!

I have never been a big turkey fan until I found this recipe - it's WONDERFUL!  Thank you... we may be having turkey more often than the obligatory Thanksgiving dinner now. =)

This was my first time cooking a turkey and I thought it turned out great.  It made the house smell wonderfull while baking, and it turned out very moist.

I have used this recipe for the past three Thanksgivings.  I volunteered to cook the turkey a few years back (using this recipe) and since then my mom makes me come over there early to get the turkey in.  My siblings were shocked the first year because the turkey was so moist (not as dry as mom's).  Mom fessed up and said that I made it for her. . . The only thing dad didn't like was that we ate all of HIS leftovers. . . there was nothing left!

The first turkey I ever made for a dinner party and it was a smashing success! Wouldn't change a thing- but all the other reviewers have said it for me already. Thanks.

I used this recipe to cook a chicken, and it turned out fabulous!!  My little bird could have won an award on presentation alone -- it was absolutely beautiful when finished, and it tasted equally delicious -- moist and yummy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I used this recipe to make my first turkey, and it turned out moist and very good!  I used the "Elegant Turkey Stuffing" recipe from this site to stuff the bird.  It made a great Christmas meal!

My husband says that I can mess up cereal but when I made this turkey for our Thanksgiving dinner he was bragging to everyone about how moist and tasy it was!  It was very simple to make although I won't be using the fat from the turkey to make the gravy.  Overall though it was great.  Thanks again.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out wonderful!  I had never made a turkey before and was attempting a 23.5 lbs bird.  I just adjusted the amount of the ingredients and got rave reviews.  Everyone said it was the best, most tender turkey they had ever eaten, even my mother and mother-in-law!!!!

This was the first time I have ever made a turkey.  My family LOVED it!  I received calls the next day telling me how good it was.  Although I did baste it a little here and there, and I used a 25lb turkey, it turned out GREAT! I will diffently use this recipe next year.
Thank you so much for this recipe.

I used this recipe for my turkey this year and I was a little disappointed with the results. The turkey had good flavor but was not as juicy as I expected. I had a large turkey so I added more butter under the skin. The broth was good and was useful in making my stuffing and gravy.

This was my first year cooking for Thanksgiving and I was very stressed. I didn't want to dry out the turkey. This recipe was very simple but it took a little longer to cook. I received allot of compliments on my turkey. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. Thank you Robin C.

Simply wonderful!  I roasted a 12.75 pound turkey for about 4-hours and it turned out perfect.  The top was well browned and the entire bird was cooked through.  The breast was a little dry...but I ladled drippings from the pan onto the meat as my husband carved, which made the meat moist.  Another reviewer mentioned to use all the butter called for, if not more, between the skin and the breast.  I agree.  I used half of what was listed in the recipe, which may be the reason the meat was a little dry.  Still, this was the best turkey I've made.  My husband also said this was the best he's ever had.  Needless to say, we are all looking forward to leftovers!

I did not actually taste this turkey myself.  I am extremely allergic to poultry.  I just helped my husband fix it without handling it myself!  The family loved it they said it was so moist. We followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out pretty and brown.  We will use this every year!

This is the best turkey I have ever had.  I think it beats my mom's.(no offense mom)  It was so moist, it was falling off the bone.  I found this recipe last year, and everytime my boyfriend or I would past the frig, we were picking off the bird. It was moist even cold. It was the first year that I didn't have enough left off for a turkey salad.   While I liked some of the  recipe add ons and sugesstions, I don't thik this turkey needs a thing!
