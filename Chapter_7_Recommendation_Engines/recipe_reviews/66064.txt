I made this for New Year's Eve with whipped cream cheese and served with petite toast.

I highly recommend only using red caviar.  It makes a beautiful pink color.  My family has been making this for years.

I made this in 10th grade for a French class project.  My grandmother had an old French cookbook and this recipe was in there.  My French teacher loved it and had me walk around to all the classes to offer the teachers a taste.  It is so  simple and so yummy.

So, my son has this thing he calls a 'food bucket list'. Basically he makes a list of foods that he wants to try and as I come across them I buy/make them for him. Caviar was on that list. Make a long story short, he didn't like it (the first thing he's tried from his list that he didn't enjoy). No fault of the recipe, as I thought it was great, but he just discovered he doesn't like caviar, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)
