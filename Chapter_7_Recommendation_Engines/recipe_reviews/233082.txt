SO GOOD! I did not have blue cheese dressing on hand, so I used ranch (1/2 cup was plenty), and just added some crumbled blue cheese...perfect! I also did not add the salt, as I felt it did not need it, so taste it first and go from there. This was a HUGE hit at dinner tonight and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good - better with Spicy V-8 than Clamato juice.  lots of hot sauce and dash of Worchester.

WOW! I followed the recipe to the letter and it is fantastic! I maintain a reduced carb diet and this fits the bill perfectly. No bread required. Either by itself or on a bed of greens, this stuff is amazing. Two thumbs up...Five stars....I love this all the way.
