This is a wonderful recipe, absolutely delicious.  My two cents: It's a good idea to calibrate your candy thermometer anytime you're making something where the temperature is critical.  Rapidly boil water and test the temperature of the boil with your thermometer.  Water boils at 212 degrees at sea level.  Where I am, water boils at 215 degrees, so I add the extra three degrees onto the temperature of whatever I am making.  My other hint is that when you're filling your sink with cold water, do not fill it more than a few inches.  The point is to rapidly cool your syrup so that it doesn't continue to cook.  I had too much water in my sink which made my pot float.  As I was struggling to let some water out, a whole gush of cold water spilled into my pot and ruined my entire batch :(  So sad when maple syrup is so pricey!  But once I got it right, it was fabulous!

This maple spread is amazing in the morning with an English muffin and coffee. Simple to make, just follow the instructions. Use a large size pot, to reach the specified temp, the syrup will roll to a slow boil. Great recipe will definitely make again.

Followed instructions exactly, however beating the mixture once cooled is very hard on the mixer.  Burned out my hand mixture during the process 
:( .....recipe is good, but not worth the cost of a new appliance!

I'm a maple syrup producer, so here's my input :)
The corn syrup is not necessary, when using light grade maple syrup.  Also, sealed maple butter will last almost indefinitely in the fridge, given the extremely high sugar content.

Mine ended up a little too runny. My thermometer must be off by a couple degrees.  The taste is great, just missing the usual texture. If I am not mistaking, you shouldn't need the corn syrup to make it. Real maple butter contains maple only. Will try it without next time.
