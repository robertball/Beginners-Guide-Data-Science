I came up with this recipe, and before I could edit it, allrecipes accepted the recipe. So I meant to write 1 tsp garlic powder, instead of onion. Thanks

These are really good, I found this recipe while looking for something different to do with canned tuna. I did tweak the recipe some, because I am on a diet and to my taste. I used 12 white mushrooms, one can of regular tuna in water drained, 1/4 cup of Fat Free Kraft Cheddar Cheese, only 1 tbsp of mayo, a sprinkle of onion powder, and a sprinkle of garlic powder. And they were fantastic. Even though the calories were already low with the original recipe, I got mine down to about 24-1/2 calories per mushroom and still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm sorry but these are just not good.  I like tuna and I like stuffed mushrooms but this combination did not appeal to me.  I made a half recipe because I actually had a half can of tuna leftover from another recipe.  I only use tuna in olive oil.  I had a block of swiss cheese instead of slices and I shredded it until I had 1 ounce by weight.  I added about 1/4 t of lemon pepper seasonging salt instead of salt and papper.  The mixture was very dry and was difficult to stuff in the mushrooms (granted mine were a bit on the small side).  I also had most of the mixture leftover when a half package of mushrooms were stuffed.  I cannot imagine serving these at a party and won't be making these again.

These mushrooms were surprisingly delicious. I didn't completely follow the recipe (no mayo, no relish, no swiss). My substitutions were smoked gouda, leftover sausage apple cranberry stuffing, chicken broth, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt/pepper. It was amazing when piping hot, not as good at room temp. Will definitely make these again, but will be served right out of the oven.

This was absolutely gorgeous. I had 4 kilos of mushrooms so made the usual cheese, onion, garlic and ham and wanted something different. Thought about tuna, saw this recipe and went for it. My sweet relish was homemade chilli jam. Filled loads, cooked a few to try and froze the others. Lovely recipe - thanks for sharing!
