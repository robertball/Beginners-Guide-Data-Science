This would be a 10 star.  I make 1-2 times a week, everyone loves it.  I do not use any water, use ginger instead of cardamom, and use vanilla yogurt (yoplait is what we like).  I double and it is gone in a few hours.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

Absolutely delightful. You might want to add extra yogurt, though, to give it a thicker consistency.

My family loved this soup.  I then took the remaining soup and froze it into popsicles.  They're great as well!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an excellent combination of flavors.  I too made this into a smoothie and left out the water.  I used frozen strawberries and half peach yogurt and 1/2 and 1/2 rather than plain yogurt.  The cardamom added a nice touch..but did not over power the drink.  I think the OJ is what made this sooo good. Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing Michelle.

4 stars as is
5 stars with these modifications:

Substitute 1 cup heavy cream for 1 cup yogurt
No water

Also, this is ready to eat immediately if you use moderately defrosted frozen strawberries. I did not have cardamom so substituted ground ginger, which is closer to cardamom than cinamon.

This is a wonderful treat, especially when accompanied by Jasmine tea!

YUMMY! So easy to make and tasted great. My kids just LOVED it!!! I used vanilla yogurt, and substituted a bit of ginger and nutmeg for the cardamon (didn't have any). There were no leftovers!

My friend and I made this "soup" on the coldest day of the winter, and it was amazing. We skipped adding the water, and stuck a few ice cubes in the blender instead to make a cold smoothie drink instead of soup. Really Yummy.. anytime of the year.  We also skipped on the spice..

Okay at first with some sliced bananas in it, but after a few spoonfulls - ugh!  More of a drink texture than a soup w/out the bananas; maybe try blending the bananas in and cutting back on the water.  Warning: This spice used (which I had never heard of) was only made by McCormick at our grocery store and costs almost $11 a bottle!

Excellent recipe!  I told my husband about someone's great suggested idea of freezing the leftovers into popsicles, and he said, "why would they have any leftovers??"  A big hit.  I didn't have any cardamom so I used a mixture of cinnamon and nutmeg and it was still great.  Next time I make this, I'd love to use some chopped fresh mint as a garnish, or blend a few leaves right in.  A definite repeat!

everyone absolutely loved this but agree it is more beverage than soup.  That being said, it didn't stop anyone from telling me to make it again and again!

Oh Wow was this ever GOOD!!  It was Blazing Hot here, so I finally got to make this. It was fruity and Cool! Someone mentioned that this was like a "smoothie", Ah Yah, if you put a smoothie into a bowl, you have soup!  I didn't have cardamon so I used a little garam marsala that I had and it gave the soup a little something interesting. I really enjoyed this soup Michelle, Thank You ever soo much!!

I will make this many more times, it was delicious and everyone in the family loved it.  I left out the water based on others recommendations, and it was perfect.

My husband introduced me to fruit soups on a cruise last summer; he was already familiar with them from spending time in Norway. We had a lot of strawberries so I decided to make this tonight. It was really good! I left out the cardamom and topped it with a little sour cream and chocolate mint from our herb garden. I would like it to be a little thicker, so next time I think I'll leave out the water. I would also like to try it with peaches. The yogurt was really good in it.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  The only thing I do differently is I don't put in the yogurt (cuts down on the calories) and I use Splenda instead of sugar (we are both diabetic) and I use lemon juice instead of orange juice for the same reason. We enjoy this soup several times a month during the summer months and as often as we can get strawberries in the winter months.  It's great if you add blueberries to it, too.

Surprisingly good.  Different than a smoothie since it has the cardamon.  My 5 year old didn't like the spice, but the rest of the family did.  Doubled the recipe and used pine-orange-banana juice.  I can see how ginger could be substituted (and might make it better)!

Really great - made in my food processor and served it for breakfast! Next time I'll try to use a sugar-alternative (splenda/truvia). I like the previous reviewer who suggested adding fresh mint as a garnish.. yum!

The flavor for us is 4 stars, but when you consider how easy and healthy this is, it gets bumped up to a 5!  We used frozen strawberries - we just thawed them in the microwave (about a minute) enough to get them into the blender in several huge chunks, then let the blender do all the work.  It came out a nice thick consistency, and tasted just like melty sorbet ... mmmm!  We did accidentally use pre-sweetened strawberries, so ours was almost a little too sweet (still very edible though).  This is a GREAT way to use up extra yogurt, or just to have an unusual side or first course with any dinner!

Great! It's perfect the way it is. We used this in our advanced foods class in school and got great reviews. Could use it as a drink too but I prefer as a "dessert soup." Also I usually serve right away without chilling and it still is AMAZING :)

I am the food service director at an upscale living center. I made this wonderful soup for dessert and everyone loved it. I used vanilla yogurt and nutmeg. Garnish was vanilla yogurt that I had strained to thicken and fresh blueberries. In fact one resident told me the dessert was something that would be served in a 5 star restaurant. Thanks for sharing.

I used 1/8 teaspoon of ginger because I didn't have the cardamon on hand. This is now a summer staple. So refreshing!

Loved it! I used a pound of frozen strawberries (defrosted), 1/2 cup orange juice, about 1 1/2 cups of vanilla yogurt, and ginger. I didn't add any water or sugar, and it was still awesome. Garnished with some whipped cream. Delicious!

I loved it, hubby didn't like it.  He likes orange juice and strawberries but didn't like them mixed, but I decided to give it four stars cause I really liked it.

I love this recipe! I use vanilla yogurt and then leave out the additional sugar. I also leave out the water. I haven't tasted it yet with cardamom.

I made this for an impromptu dinner party and everyone loved.   It made a beautiful and suprising presentation.  I later served it to my kids and they loved it.   I actually used heavy cream in place of the yogurt because that is what I had in the fridge.  Highly recommend.

I really loved this! As I was reading the reviews I noticed people were saying they didn't like the taste of the orange juice, but I didn't taste it at all! To anyone who thought the orange taste was bad, you can always add more strawberries or less OJ. I might use a little less sugar, maybe a couple tablespoons less, but otherwise I love this recipe! Also, some people said they thought of it more as a smoothie, but if you have ever eaten gazpacho, a traditional spanish chilled soup, it is exactly the same consistency. In reality many soups could be considered beverages. Loved the recipe!

This soup is perfect for summer! I made it for my family, and even my sister (who was highly skeptical of a chilled strawberry soup) loved it. I didn't want to use cardamom since it's so expensive, so I substituted cinnamon and nutmeg. Delicious!

Very good! There was a little too much sugar for my taste though. Will probably cut it in half next time and see how it goes from there. Also might try freezing the fresh strawberries first to make it nice and cold right when it's ready!

Excellent!!!! This was SOOO good!!!! I could eat/drink this every day!!!  I made it for my younger sisters 11th b-day tea party and it was a hit! Even my brothers liked it (we saved some for them:). I have 9 siblings and if I can find a recipe that everyone likes, then you know it must be good!!!!! I put them in "fancy" glasses that have a stem and put a dollop of whipped cream on top along with a strawberry (just to make it look prettier). I know it isn't very healthy but I also added red food coloring to it to give it more of a deep color. I was aiming for red but because of the quantity I had made, it would have taken WAY more food coloring then I had!;D It still turned out really pretty though!!!

this is REALLY great!  I read the 'most helpful' reviews, and omitted the water, used vanilla yogurt, and ground ginger (I didn't have any cardamom on hand).  I also used frozen strawberries, so I didn't have to chill it and threw everything in the blender.  It was sooo yummy.  My kids really enjoyed it.  Thanks for a fast and easy recipe.

Absolutly delicious! The orange juice adds a wonderful tang. I don't like the taste of the cardamom, so I left it out. I followed others' suggestions about using less water. After blending it, I added the rest as it was too thick. I also used frozen strawberries which made it perfect for a hot afternoon. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Had extremely ripe strawberries I needed to use quickly, so I hesitantly tried this recipe.  Spontanaity meant I didn't have all the ingredients exactly---I used cherry yogart instead of plain yogurt, and nutmeg instead of cardamom.  Also, after reading other reviews, I cut back on the water just a bit.  It turned out great!  Soup/drink, whichever....I liked it in a cup, my children liked it in a bowl.  Nice, refreshing treat.

This recipe just didn't have a very unique taste to it. I wa expecting something that was a little more creative. It basically tasted like thin strawberry smoothie. My boyfriend thought the orange juice didn't taste very good with the strawberries. I will not be making this again.

Served this at a family brunch, everyone loved it.  I added more cardamon because I like the flavor. I will be making this for years to come.  I don't even want to try a different recipe for strawberry soup.  This was perfect.

I really liked this.  It was very easy to make...only took a few minutes.  I made it with non-fat plain yogurt and Equal instead of sugar.  It was low-fat and very refreshing for a hot summer night.

This soup tastes like something you would get on a cruise ship.  It has great flavor (we like it with a little dollop of whipped cream) and is very fast to make.  I like that it is relatively healthy and still totally delicious.

Delicious!  3 of my 4 children loved it.  I think the other one was thrown off by the strawberry seeds - what can you do?  It reminded The Husband and me of a chilled fruit soup we had on a cruise once.  Delightful!  (I also left the water out, per the other reviews.)

This is awesome.  I substituted honey for sugar, and added some vanilla extract.  So yummy and creamy, and its awesome that its low in fat!  I used 1% plain yoghurt and it actually tasted like there was cream in it.  I ate the whole batch myself today, so I'm going to make some more tomorrow.
Thanks a lot for the recipe.

Absolutely excellent. Based off the past reviews, I used a combination of cinnamon, ginger, & nutmeg to taste. To maximize the flavor, garnish with fresh cream!

Mmmm was this good! I love cardamom so I upped the 1/8 t to 1/4 t and you could definitely taste it. I used one container of French Vanilla yogurt and squeezed 1/2 c of orange juice from some oranges I had in the kitchen. Yum!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I cut out the water entirely and we drank it like a smoothie.  I was afraid the cardamon would interfere with the strawberry flavor, but it brought it out beautifully!  I will be making this again, and again, and again... you get the picture.

very easy and tasty.  second time around i will use half the water and bump up the cardamom and OJ.  garnished with a dill sprig and a strawberry slice it makes a nice presentation (sprinkle a tiny amount of cardamom over the top too).

I made this yesterday for a BBQ at my sisters' house and it was DELICIOUS!  I realized while eating it I'd forgotten to put the cardamom or cinnamon in the soup and still thought it tasted great!  This was a huge hit w/ my girls and I'll be making if often.  I like that it's super easy and healthy too!

I found a darling little soup tureen with strawberries all over it at a garage sale and thought this recipe was perfect for it.  The only suggestion I have to make was it could of used more cardamom.  I served it with "The Girl's Chicken Sandwiches" from this site for a wonderful summer lunch!

I thought this was bad. My husband thought it was interesting. I expected it to be sweet tasting and more like a smoothie but it wasn't. It was just bad. I wanted to like this recipe. I just couldn't.

My family absolutely loved this recipie when I surprised them with it one night for desert!  I decided that when it came out of my blender, it was a little too runny, so I added a couple of spoonfulls (the serving spoon-full, rather than a teaspoon/tablespoon) of cool-whip to make it a little creamier.

Yum!!!  This is great!  I used light, fat free vanilla yogurt and half the water for an out of this world fruity treat!
You can also omit the water and blend in a cup of crushed ice for a smoothie!  Make extra!

Have been looking for 'fruit soups' since being introduced to them on the QE2 earlier this summer! Many thanks!!This was super and easy! Served to start a special summer lunch for overseas visitors. Only difficulty was in locating the cardomom, but I should be a better cook and have it on hand anyway. Oh, yes, I figure that 2 pints of strawberries is equal to 2 cups of sliced. ( No kids at the lunch)

This stuff is absolutely the best. It takes only a few minutes to make and is basically totally goof proof. My boyfriend can't get enough of it.
I have made it with less sugar and topped with sour cream for a cool, refreshing appetizer and also sweeter to serve with angel food cake and low 
fat vanilla ice cream for a low cal dessert. I love this recipe.

This was a really nice and refreshing recipe.  One thing I think I will change next time I make it - don't use as much oj - it tends to overpower it. But for the most part, this was delicious!

I found that it tasted like a smoothee, add cream and less orange juice + add a GOOD bit of mint as well.  I've only seen fresh mint so you have to look around for it, but it's worth it. :D

Made this for a family dinner and everyone LOVED it!  Every last spoonful was devoured--even my picky daughter loved it.  I used nutmeg instead of cardamom and cut back on the sugar a bit, since the strawberries are in season and very sweet right now.  I passed the recipe along to my sisters and will be making it again.

This recipe was quick, easy, and tastey. And it's quite healthy too.
My husband really liked it, and it made a great pre-dinner snack for my
son when he got home from preschool. Thumbs up from him too.

It's alright, more of a smoothie than a fruit soup in my opinion. My brother seemed to enjoy it however. I would cut down on the orange juice, as ir overpowers some of the other flavors.

I used plain greek yogurt for extra thickness and omitted the water, which gave it a thin smoothie like consitency.  I like cardamom so I increased that to about 1/3 tsp and still couldn't really taste it.  Next time I will make it with some mint!  This will be a versatile recipe to use every strawberry season! hint: it's really good poured over shortcake :)

I did reduce sugar to 3/8 cup and used vanilla yogurt.  Served for Mother's Day Brunch.  My family loved it!

Very good and refreshing I did not add water and used
greek nonfat vanilla yogurt, cut way back on sugar and 
used cinnamon for spice.  Will definitely make again
and will try freezing for pops.  Thanks for the recipe

This is wonderful! I drained the yogurt for about an hour to thicken it and added maybe a tablespoon of water and used three cups of frozen strawberrys insted of fresh. It turned out great, nice and thick.

This was a huge success at a lunch party on  a hot summer day.  I skipped the water, used low fat vanilla yogurt and the full amount of sugar.  It was a little bit too sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar.  I also only had all spice on hand so I used a dash of that instead.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  Didn't have any cardamom and it was still excellent.  I used 2% yogurt, fresh berries and Tropicana orange/grapefruit juice.  The food processor made the prep simple.  Will definitely make again!

I like this recipe- it's a keeper. I had some yogurt that I needed to use pretty quickly and this recipe came in handily. I think the recipe calls for a bit too much sugar so next time I'll reduce it a bit and I also like the suggestion of other reviewers to use a combo of ginger/nutmeg to replace the caradom.

Tried this recipe multiple times and loved it! In fact, there have been times when I haven't had strawberries on hand and substituted other fruit (canned lychees, raspberries, blackberries) and it's still turned out great. The cardamom adds a great extra touch to the overall flavor.

Oh my goodness, this was wonderful.  I made it to go with a hugh family meal - so there would be something semi-lite in case anyone wanted it.  It was great.  I'm looking forward to making it for summer cookouts.  I did add extra cardamom.. but that was just to my own taste.

This soup was a HUGE hit with my kids (9 and 6)and grownups alike. I substituted watermelon for the strawberries and used strawberry yogurt (didn't have enough plain). I also omitted the sugar and the water. What could be easier? The kids thought it tasted like "Gogurt" and drank it from a cup. I served this as a first course for a hot summer night and one of my guests had two servings! I'll be making this all summer long.
