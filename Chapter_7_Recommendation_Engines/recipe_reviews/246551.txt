I made this and another similar recipe from this site last night for dinner and this one had a lot more flavor and was much better in my opinion. Black beans are bland to me and need something to help flavor so the salsa was perfect. I left out the optional sour cream because the other recipe called for it and a little bit of sour cream goes a long way with me. I plan on making this again with corn tortilla chips like the recipe submitter suggested and I will add jalapeno's and more cilantro when I do.

This is not the recipe I submitted. I would not use flour tortillas!! Use corn tortillas.  Also, 1/4 cp sour cream is too much!! This is a dish for 1.
