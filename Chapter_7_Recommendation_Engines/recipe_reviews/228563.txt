These are super. I was out of cocoa so I used a square of bakers semi-sweet chocolate. Poured the mixture into an 8x8 parchment lined pan. This mixture is delicious however I did add to it. I melted 3/4 of a cup of milk chocolate morsels and 1.5 Tbs of peanut butter in the microwave for 45 seconds and spread that over the top of the mixture. Decorated with sprinkled coconut, refrigerated and then cut into bars. The submitter is right about eating them all! Wow these are so addictive. Thanks bperry80

My husband loves this recipe. I've made them in a a brownie pan with the chocolate layer like the one user suggested. I've made them replacing the white sugar with brown and they still turned out great. Thanks for the wonderful, easy recipe.

awesome recipe! i flattened out the mix into a pan to make bar cookies. i melted some semi sweet chocolate and poured on top. once hardened, i cut into bars. also added an extra tablespoon of cocoa since i love chocolate! next time i will double the recipe to make them into a more substantial bar cookie. thankyou for such an easy, delicious dessert.

Delicious and easy to make. Will be making them again in the future. I put them in a baking pan instead of dropping each one on a baking sheet, they were easy to cut and store in the freezer.

I added much more coconut and I love it.  My mom used to make exactly that recipe and I've been looking for it.  Not as complicated as I thought.  Perfect snack for me and I only use sugar substitutes for health reasons.

Going through chemo at the time that I made these, it's hard to find food that I enjoy tasting! So because I didn't care for the large pieces of oats, the only change I made was using quick oats instead. My husband and my grandson couldn't get enough!....Me neither!  :)

Well, this was a fail for me, but they tasted SO good! I should have went with my instincts and not boiled it that long. I must have boiled too much of the liquid out. As soon as it was done boiling and I added the rest of the ingredients, I knew something was wrong. These were so DRY and crumbly it looked like granola when it was done. I tried to press it into a pan, but it didn't work. We ended up eating it like granola by the handfuls. It was delicious!! I'm going to try again today. Maybe I'll boil it on a lower setting or add more liquid. I'm giving four stars because it did taste incredibly good and none of the other reviewers had the same problem as I did.

Good and easy! Mine were still super-sweet, despite doing what other reviewers said and cutting down the sugar. Also, I suggest a name change to include "oatmeal" as these are more oatmeal than coconut.

Simple, quick, tasty, and popular. I have added additional oatmeal and coconut and found it still worked very well.

Very good as written - got lots of compliments at work. It is a very sweet cookie though, next batch, I will lessen the amount of sugar & increase the amount of cocoa to balance the sweetness & chocolate flavors.

This came out too sweet and the bars weren't solid. I would use half as much sugar next time and less butter.

I'm glad I just made a half batch, cuz I've eaten half of it already - yum!

I was going to add chocolate chips like another reviewer did, but 
I doubled the cocoa powder and it was plenty chocolatey for me.

I added a little more coconut. 

Note: the flavor really improves after the hour of refrigeration - try to not skip this step.
