I made two batches of these cookies.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and the second time, I used 1 1/2 t. almond extract and no vanilla, hoping to get a stronger flavor.  In both cases, the cookies seemed to lack flavor...they're a little bland.  I think that is fixable, with a little more experimentation.

The dough is very easy to work with, and the texture is lovely.  I am a first-time cookie press user, and I had great success!  With the second batch I set my press to make small, two bite cookies.  I got just over 100 from the recipe.  

This recipe (a single batch) fills my cookie press exactly three times.  I divided the dough into three portions.  I kneaded gel food coloring (green) into one, and made trees (with sprinkles) and wreaths (with sugar and a red M&M).  I left one portion plain and made 5-petal flowers. Some got sprinkles and an M&M in the center, some got a fingerprint and a tiny bit of strawberry jam.  The third portion got cocoa mixed in (I didn't measure, just added it until it looked about the color of a milk chocolate bar) and made 8-point 'starfish'(again, an M&M in the center of those) and some square doohickeys.  

The chocolate ones taste really good, and the ones with the jam or the M&M have more flavor from the added items.  I plan to use this recipe again, and might try adding things like finely grated citrus zest or cinnamon, to boost the flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Okay so why complain about 'blandness' in a butter cookie recipe?    This is good, the very traditional spritz cookie taste I grew up with.  It's a delicate flavor people... not your double chocolate, carmel pecan balls that should sit on your cookie plate NEXT to these ones.

Simply double the almond extract to a full teaspoon and it's perfect.

Baked for exactly 6 minutes to achieve soft, delicate, goodness.  Bravisimo.

This recipe is awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough was a dream to work with, even after adding quite a bit of food coloring, to get the desired color.  It loaded into my cookie press with ease and came out perfectly onto the pan.  The cookies are yummy and perfect - not hard and crunchy like other Spritz recipes that I had tried.  My son and I just made our first batch for the Staff at his school for Staff Appreciation, but we will be making another batch of these for Santa Claus.  The ones we are making today, my son decorated with color sprinkles.  The next batch I want to dip in melted chocolate or drizzle melted chocolate over the cookies after they have cooled.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - it is going in my handwritten cookbook and I hope to pass this recipe down to my kids and grandchildren one day.

VERY GOOD SPRITZ.  THESE COOKIES ARE SOFT UNLIKE MOST SPRITZ THAT ARE CRUNCHY & SHORTBREAD TASTING.  I REALLY LIKED THAT THEY WERE SOFT AND LOVED THE BUTTERY TASTE.  I MADE THEM WITH 1 1/2 TSP. VANILLA B/C I HADE NO ALMOND EXTRACT AND THEY TURNED OUT GREAT.  NEXT TIME WILL TRY WITH ALMOND EXTRACT IN THEM.  THESE COOKIES CAME OUT OF THE PRESS BEAUTIFULLY WITH NO PROBLEMS!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE YUMMY, BUTTERY SPRITZ COOKIE RECIPE!!

I made these cookies at Christmas  this year and love the recipe. These cookies are eay to make, color and decorate. I also like how they don't get too much bigger as they cook, so you can make a lot at one time, putting them fairly close on the baking sheet. They were just the reight amount of suar and butter taste for me. Thanks!

After watching my mother's frustration with the pressed cookie recipe she used over the years, I was leery to ever try one. However, this year for Christmas, I chose to make mostly cookies I have never made before and I have got to say these were the best of the best. They complement my Christmas cookie tray with a wonderfully buttery, not too sweet, a melt away texture. The dough was immediately workable with no refrigeration. I did learn that the dough does not stick to parchment paper so that when you lift up the cookie press, the dough comes up with it, so don't use it. However, there is no need  anyway as these cookies don't stick to the pan after they have been baked. I  switch the amounts on the almond and vanilla extracts--I just like more almond.

The cookies made with this recipe were much better than with the recipe that came with the cookie press. The dough was easy to work with without having to chill it.

Perfect dough for a cookie press! Found the taste a little bland. May add more extracts next time. The cookies bake up beautifully light and white. I added sugar crystals to sweeten the tops, but the best was a slight drizzling of melted chocolate. Will make again.

By far the best recipe for spritz cookies that I have found.  My husband tried them and went nuts, I ended up making two more batches by the weeks end!

Yum! Just like mama used to make!  I didn't have almond extract, so I just used all vanilla, and chilled the dough between press fillings.  I found that the disks that have connected patterns or just one hole seemed to work the best, but I think thats just the nature of press cookies and not the dough's fault.

Just made this recipe and it's not bad.  Nice a soft, however, they are still a bit dry, like most recipes that I have tried.  I like the flavor, however.  It is nice and light.

YUMM!  At Christmas I had used the recipe on the box that my cookie press came in, and was sorely disappointed.  This recipe is so much better - the texture and flavour are excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with the dough being too stiff.  Again, YUMMY!!

Perfect.  I added an additional teaspoon of vanilla and teaspoon and a half of almond extract- yum. They turned out perfectly!  I've always been afraid of my cookie press, no longer!!  The dough is really easy to work with too, no need to chill.  If you unsure as to how to use your cookie press, there are wonderful tutorials on youtube!

I'm in love! These are the best butter cookies I've ever tasted and, unlike so many other so-called cookie press recipes, these are a breeze to press into the pan. Thanks so much for sharing.

Great recipe! The changes I made are as follows: I added the confectioner sugar, butter, and egg at the same time and creamed them together. I cut the flour back to 2 1/4 cups. I increased the vanilla to 2 tsps (only because I do not like almond extract). Great spritz cookies. creamy, buttery, yummy! Chill the cookie dough for about 10 minutes before you press the dough. I load my cookie press then chill the whole thing. While a batch of cookies are baking and cooling, I reload the cookie press and stick it in the fridge for about 10 minutes. No issues with dough sticking to press or not coming out. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and loved the flavor of the cookies.  It is a mild flavor, but the mixture of the vanilla, almond and powder sugar is very nice.  I think it'll provide good balance on my cookie tray.  I followed the advice of another, and refrigerated the dough first.  My cookie press didn't like that-too hard to work with.  I had to let the dough sit a while and get back to closer to room temperature, to be able to do more cookies.

Excellent.  The only change was that I added 1-1/2 tsp vanilla and no almond extract because I did not have any.  One of the best Spritz cookie recipes I've made.  Thanks!

These were excellent!  I am usually pretty neutral about shortbread-type cookies, because they can be so bland.  With this recipe the only thing I changed was to omit the 1/2 tsp. almond extract and subsititute it with more vanilla, only because I didn't have almond extract.  I sprinkled half of these with regular granulated sugar, and the other half will be drizzled with chocolate.  Delicious!  This will be my go-to cookie press recipe.

Wow, what a disappointment.  I followed this recipe exactly, and while I could give it 4 or 5 stars for taste (which I really really liked), I didn't have the luck with consistency that the other reviewers had.   Maybe I needed to refrigerate after all?  Half of what I pressed needed to be repressed and when they came out of the oven, the 4 shapes that I tried had mostly flattened into something unrecognizable, and this in turn made them very hard to remove from the cookie sheet without breaking.  They just became far too delicate.  If you asked the five 10 year olds I fed them to (after I concluded they were not going out with me tonight) what their rating was, they would have given them 5 stars!!!    Might try again and chill dough??

I really liked this recipe.  Great tasting dough that was easy to work with.  I always line my pans with parchment paper but for this recipe, skip it. They need to stick to the pan a little to pull away from the cookie press.  I threw out my old recipe and will use this one from now on. Thanks!

What an excellent recipe, I followed it as-is, not changing a thing - it was perfect....  Even my husband got into using the cookie press.  The only thing you may want to do is make a double batch......

Very tasty and stay soft.  I liked the powdered sugar in it instead of the granulated, I think that is what keeps it soft.
I tried a couple of recipes and this is by far the best. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have almond extract so used the vanilla for that. I found the dough perfect for the press, not sure what happened to the ones that were too sticky or too dry, must be operator error there.  Thanks!

This was my first experience making spritz, so I feel like I don't have the right to give a semi-negative review, but actually the first pan of cookies literally melted unbelievably flat and shapeless (at least they came off easily). I added probably more than a cup of flour to get it to a consistancy that would hold it's shape. So it did work in the end, but had I known I would have to add so much flour, I would have added more vanilla for some extra flavor. Oh well, I'll try again and see if I can up the quality a bit more.

These cookies are so delicious and tender, and work perfectly in a cookie press. It's not easy to find a dough recipe for a cookie press that doesn't require some kind of tweaking like adding flour or liquid or refrigerating to get it "just right" for the cookie press! This one is perfect, just as it is written - literally mix, press and bake!

I really enjoyed these.  The dough was a bit soft which made it somewhat hard to work with, but it worked in the end.  I split the dough in thirds and dyed one batch blue and the other pink.  Used silver sprinkles.  Very tasty and melt in the mouth.

I'm a first time cookie press user (just got a new rechargeable one) & this dough was a dream to work with! Because of reviewers complaining of the lack in flavor, I doubled the vanilla & added the zest from half a lg orange. I think raspberry extract would also be nice instead of the orange zest. Also, I was low on flour so I had to use half all-purpose & half cake flour...not sure if it made a difference or not...I'll know next time when I use all all-purpose. I made lots of different shapes, playing around ;o), but settled on flower shapes (thumbprinted, baked, dusted w/ pwdered sugar & filled w/ homemade apricot jam), wreaths (centers filled w/ crushed butterscotch candies before baking...I should have sprinkled them w/ sparkly sugar before filling w/ candy to dress them up some), ovals (dipped in  Caramel Chocolate Dip, recipe from Allrecipes),  3 circles  (made neon-colored vanilla sugar & sprinkled them before baking) & what were supposed to be squares but rounded (I sprinkled them w/ candy sprinkles & filled the center w/ mini-M&M's). They all tasted great & looked cute as heck! What a fun way for hubby & I to spend a Sunday afternoon ...thanks for THE Spritz cookie recipe we'll use always!

Awesome recipe!!  My husband even liked the cookies and he only like chocolate.  The dough was super easy to work with, didn't spread on the cookie sheet.  Turned out great, my 6 year old son even helped press them and found it to be easy.  I added the liquid food coloring and it didn't change the consistency of the dough.

This recipe worked great with my press. The dough was very creamy and easy to use. I added about 1/2 tsp. of orange zest to enhance the flavor.  Next time I will increase the orange zest to 1 tsp.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good spritz cookie.  Made exactly as directed and when we tested the first batch they were way too almond for our tastes.  I tweaked the rest of the dough by adding 1 more tsp of vanilla and it was perfect.  Worked very well in the spritz press when the dough was kept chilled.  Would definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. I HIGHLY recommend using 1tsp of Almond along with the 1 tsp of Vanilla. I made one batch with the extra almond and half as the recipe states. There was a very noticeable difference in taste between the two cookies. You could even add more! It was my first time making Spritz and I found it to be surprisingly easy. Don't be afraid of the cookie press, it's far easier than making cut-outs!!

These were perfection!  The dough was exactly the right consistency for my cookie press.  I was worried b/c it is a soft, sticky kind of dough, but it worked great with no refrigeration necessary. We loved the flavor, though I'm sure if you are not a fan of almond you could use all vanilla.  I frosted half with cream cheese frosting, and the other half I drizzled with melted white chocolate.  I'll be making these for every holiday from now on!

Oh. My. Gosh. I have tried many a Spritz cookie recipe-- these are the easiest to put together and the BEST! Soft cookies, wonderful flavor.  I did use half the almond extract and used a bit more vanilla, but I think next time I will try the "full dose" of almod extract.  WONDERFUL Spritz-- thanks for sharing!!

These are delicious just the way the are!  I have never made spritz cookies before and was extremely pleased with the taste.  My husband said: "Is this all you made?  They will be gone by noon!"  I made them around 11:00am.  I will definitely make these again this week and will double the recipe!

I used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract due to a nut sensitivity in the family and they were great!  Definately flavorful, soft, and "chewy" (two people commented on the chewiness).  This was my first time using a cookie press, I'd heard nightmares, and I found the dough pretty easy to use.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is delicious and easy. They worked well in my cookie press. I doubled the amount of almond and they tasted perfect! We dipped the bottom portion of some into melted dark chocolate and that coupled with the subtle almond flavor was really good.

I read the reviews and added more flavor b/c people said it was bland. Even with extra flavor it was like chewing clay: bland a tough. Find the Spritz recipes which include cream cheese, they are soft and still very flavorful. THe only reason they got 2 stars from me is b/c they ARE soft.

I didn't have any almost extract, so I used all vanilla. While the consistency of the dough was nice, the flavor was bland, and like others have said, a little floury. I won't be making these again.

I've never made spritz before but wanted to try something different this year. Armed with a new cookie press, I went to work with this recipe yesterday, and I'm wondering why I didn't work up the courage to do these years ago! The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute lemon extract for the almond extract called for. The recipe came together quicly and easily, and the dough popped out of the press wonderfully. Cookies held their shape, with a baking time of six minutes. The flavor is "just right" and it's hard to stop nibbling them. Will definitely make these again and again in the future and plan to experiment with different extracts (orange intrigues me!). Thanks so much for this recipe.

Finished cookies had great taste and texture, but the dough seemed way to soft for the press and I had a hard time getting them to release from press.. If I made again would probably try another 1/2 c of flour.

Best spritz cookie I've ever eaten. I added 1 tsp. extra vanilla & left out the almond extract.  The dough was still a little too tough to push through my electric cookie press, so I added a little bit of water to soften it a bit more.  I'm not a great baker, but that seemed to work beautifully & my family enjoyed the results!

The best Spritz cookie recipe I've made (okay, I've only used 2) :)  But this was much easier to work with and tasted better too.  I used an egg substitute (1t baking powder, 1T vinegar, 1T water) because I was baking for a friend who has a son allergic to eggs.  It STILL turned out fantastic.  Thanks!

O.K. maybe those of you that thought that these were bland had never had this type of cookie before or something, but i would not call them bland. They turned out perfect without having to change a thing on the recipe.  My 5 year old who hates everything keeps asking for more.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

This cookie recipe was simple to make, but it didn't get the oohhhs and aaahhhs from the family.  If I make them again I'll subtract out the almond extract and add more vanilla.    
I must admit that my little girl did have fun helping me put these on the cookie sheet.  :)

These are the best spritz cookies I have ever made. They were still soft and moist but had a bit of crisp.  These didn't even last a day in our house.

The flavor was bland and I struggled to get the dough to work in my Pampered Chef cookie press. The texture was not very light or crisp. I would have tried a second batch, but the flavor was too boring to get a second try.

I wasn't sure if I'd like spritz cookies, but these were wonderful.  I added a little butter flavoring because I wanted the real buttery taste (I find that real butter doesn't really add that much taste)... they were perfect in texture and taste.  I put the dough through a cookie press, then I drizzled chocolate over them, perfect!

These really are the best Spritz cookies I've ever made.  They're tender, buttery, and not too sweet.  I try to get them out just before they go a bit gold at the edges; as soon as the tops are dry, they're done!

I've tried 3 or 4 recipes, and this one is by far the best recipe.  Usually I have issues with my cookie press and the dough being to thick, but this was no problem.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Very nice and easy to work with. I did make a very large batch, divided it out making different colors and adding various flavorings (peppermint, banana, butter rum, anise, lemon, etc) to each seperate section. Will definitely be using this recipe again & again.

Great recipe!! This was the first spritz recipe I tried since getting my cookie press for Christmas this year. They turned out well. The dough was easy to work with, easy to make and made soft and delicious cookies! Dying them in the last step is really hard though. If you want certain colors, I would suggest mixing it in earlier. I got chunks of food coloring on some cookies.

I would give these a 3-1/2 if I could.  The texture of these cookies is incredible.  The dough was pleasingly stiff - stiff enough to make a sturdy cookie, but not too stiff to make it difficult to work with.  The cookies have just the right tenderness when baked.  However, I found the flavor a bit off.  The butter taste was overwhelming.  I think it needs some more almond extract.

This is the first time I've ever used a cookie press and it worked wonderfully! These cookies are the perfect texture and cooked up great. At first we were thinking the taste was a bit blah, but since we kept coming back for more I think they are a hit! Buttery but not too buttery, and just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely be making more for the holidays! :)

My first time using a cookie press and this recipe worked fabulously.  The cookie flavor is perfect as is and I made no changes.  Next time I think I'll try a little cocoa powder in it for a chocolatey flavor.  This is a definite keeper!

I have tried many recipes for Spritz cookies over the years. I was very pleased with this recipe. Very tender cookies but they do not break easily (a problem I've encountered frequently). I didn't use both vanilla and almond extract. I made two batches using all vanilla in one and all almond in the other. Thanks for a great recipe!

The cookies were very bland. Even with the decorating sugar, it was akin to eating unsweetened dough with a hint of almond after-taste. For my next batches, I left them in the oven for a bit longer to crisp them so they would hopefully be more like butter cookies than undercooked dough. It didn't help. I gave it 2 stars because there's a chance my taste-buds are over stimulated from all the chocolate I had this holiday, that I didn't taste the subtlety of the cookies, but I doubt it.

oh my goodness, what a wonderful spritz cookie recipe!  As a child we made spritz from a recipe different than the one in the Mirro cookie press booklet.  I've tried the others and they spread way too much.  Today, I decided to break-out the old turn-style cookie press from my childhood to bake with my 7yr old son.  I chose this one because the other reviews were glowing and stated that the cookies had minimal spread.  After the first batch, the shape and color were wonderful.  My son thought the taste a bit "plain" (kids, used to all the highly sugared stuff I guess).  So I added just a touch more almond extract.  Just perfect!  I will have to make a double/triple batch next time!    Thanks for a great way to bring back one of my fav ways to make cookies!

Great recipieI Tastes exactly how I remember them from my childhood. I made no changes to the recipie and think that these are perfect!! The cookies were soft (baked them only 6 minutes) and delicately sweet. I let my kids add decorations before putting in the oven as a way to get the whole family involved. I plan on making another batch tonight!!

Great recipe. I used 100% Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. (and eliminated the almond extract).  This gives the cookie a clean flavor with a warm background note.  Drizzle with semi sweet chocolate and you are done!

Fabulous.  I made springtime designs.  I agree the powdered sugar is the key.

This recipe was the best spritz recipe I have ever made.  The dough is consistantly easy to use, the cookies came out perfect each time,  Thank you for a recipe that I have been searching to find a good one.

I thought these cookies were a little bland. I decorated some with sugar sprinkles and others with M&M's. The ones with the M&M's tasted much better. It seemed to give it a flavor boost. However, I don't think that I would make these again. I prefer a more flavorful cookie.

I'm a first-time cookie press user - my mom found a never-used press from the 1950s or 1960s for me for my birthday - and I thought this recipe was great.  Had to add some more flour to get the right texture, but I think that's because I'd allowed the butter to become too softened.  After adding the flour, it went through my press beautifully.  Loved the almond flavor - will probably add more to my next batch.  My husband would have eaten them all last night, and my daughters were begging to have one for lunch today.  This batch is for teachers, Sunday school teachers, etc. for Christmas - next batch is all theirs :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

Maybe it's something I did - or didn't do - but I had a hard time getting these to come onto the pan in a recognizable shape.  I tried refrigerating the dough, and that helped for the first 5 or 6 pressed, but then the dough got very sticky. But they still taste good - so not a total loss.  Back to the drawing board for me!

Very easy dough to work with. I used this recipe for my first time using a cookie press. My press was a little tempermental, but the dough was fabulous! Instead of almond extract I used coconut extract to do something a little different. Can't wait to share these!

This was way too dry to work in my cookie press.  The dough was very bland.  I was not impressed.

These were ok. I did not add sprinkles or color sugar so they seemed like they needed more sugar. I'm sure would be fine with the   sugar on top. I thought the dough was hard and had to squeeze really hard. I will try again though. The kids liked them.

I've never made spritz before, so I didn't know what the dough was supposed to look like.  I wrote down the recipe without the flour!!  After some trial and error I ended up adding probably the amount of flour needed, and then they were great.  Lots of fun to make and decorate.  We'll definitely try again!

These were ok.  The dough was easy to work with; however, the cookie is quite bland.   So to make it more to my family's tastes, I drizzled chocolate and/or white icing over them when they were cool.  They look Christmasy with the springkles, half a red candied cherry and the drizzles.  Just needed the extra touches or it would have been a bit dull.

Great cookie! I used lemon flavoring insted of the vanilla and almond. (My family does not like almond) They all turned out perfect, a little soft not very crunchy. Yum!

Very good & versatile recipe!  I love the almond & the vanilla flavoring.  I liked those so much that I made another batch but substituted the flavorings with marashino juice & added some very finely chopped cherries.  Not only were they pretty, they were very good & beautiful on the Christmas treat trays!  Great recipe, thanks!
