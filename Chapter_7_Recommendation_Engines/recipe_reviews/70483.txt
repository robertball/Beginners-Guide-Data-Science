A simply beautiful dish. Fun to prepare, beautiful presentation, and delicious. I'm a little concerned by some comments  calling the preparation intimidating or a lot of work. It's not, but unfortunately this might dissuade others from trying it. I used butter rather than oil, all shrimp, clam juice for the fish stock, and no cayenne (hubby has sensitive innards). Even without the cayenne, it was still too hot for hubby, so he was unable to eat it. So just a warning--this is hot and spicy. If you're not sure about the level of heat, add less hot sauce to start--you can always add more, but can't take it away once it's in there! Oh--throw in a little chopped fresh parsley or green onion just before serving...the little punch of color really is pretty and brightens it up.

This is a GREAT recipe!!  The other etouffees on this site that call for cornstarch are just not authentic.  Almost everything in LA starts with a roux, and the end result is well worth it!  Don't be afraid to try - all you have to do is stir constantly (I use a whisk) for 15 minutes, and the scary part is over.  If you don't have crawfish, use all shrimp.  Throw in some cooked chicken if you want...it is soooo good.  FYI - I didn't use cayenne or hot sauce, but put in 2T of Old Bay.  Perfect every time!!

The first time I made this, I got so excited because the sauce after I added the tomatoes and fish stock was to die for. I used boxed fish stock and it was amazing, I added some frozen crawfish meat and shrimp and the frozen crawfish meat ruined it.  I was sooo disappointed.  The second time I made this, I used clam juice with some fish sauce (used in oriental cooking) and omitted the crawfish meat (since it is hard to get fresh stuff where I live) and added diced chicken and it was again amazing.  I usually like to play with the recipe a little but there is no need to with this one.  It has become a new family favorite and I actually enjoy making the roux.

Excellent! I am from New Orleans and my husband has cooked etoufee in the past, but I wanted to try my hand at it. All I can say is WOW! Super Flavor! I substituted chicken broth for the fish stock since I already had it on hand. Only thing I would do different is cut back on the spicy factors I would half the seafood seasoning and eliminate the cayenne. I used Crystal Hot sauce and it was great. Thanks again for a real winner

I'd been looking for an etouffe recipe I could satisfactorily adapt to vegetarian cooking for quite some time.  The vegetables and seasonings in this recipe fit the bill perfectly-- I used a vegetarian "chicken-style" broth instead of fish stock and added 8 oz. diced tempeh (instead of the crawfish and shrimp) when it was time to add the tomatoes and the stock.  I followed everything else exactly as written.  We love hot and spicy recipes and my husband has greedily devoured this the two times I've made it so far.  Even with the time it takes to make the roux, the ingredients are quickly prepared and this recipe is really quite simple to make.  This was easily adapted to our specific dietary needs and was absolutely delicious!

This recipe was very good.  Very tasty!! It's very spicy.  So, if you don't like your food too hot, you may want to cut back and use a little less cayenne pepper, black pepper, and hot sauce.  Some recipes call for "corn starch." But I found the roux is much better - more flavorful.  Roux can be tricky - take your time, don't set the heat/fire too high (you definitely don't want it to burn).  Roux is worth the work.  Also, I had never heard of "fish stock (soup)."  But I found it at an Asian store named Seafood City.  I found it in boullion cubes brand named "Knorr."  Surprisingly they had fish flavor and shrimp flavor.  I think the fish stock along with the roux really added to the flavor.  I did not use the shrimp - I used all crawfish.  Shrimp and crawfish each have there own flavor.  I'll make the next batch with the shrimp.  Try it.  It's delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this for my mom on mother's day and it was a huge hit.  I subbed butter for half of the oil, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  For those havung trouble finding crawfish, they now sell them at walmart in the frozen fish section.

Okay but the recipe needs some changes.  The roux calls for too much oil.  I'd use 1/4 cup next time.  As is, you can really taste the oil and it covers your lips while eating.  The roux should have been browner, not quite the right taste at peanut butter color.  I'd go for about 30 minutes and shoot for a milk chocolate color.  Also, the vegetables need to saute for at least twice as long.  I followed the cooking times in the recipe and they came out crunchy.  I'm glad I cooked it for the family first before making it for guests or I would have been a tad embarrassed.  This recipe made four servings, not near enough to stretch it to six unless you served a side dish.

This is a wonderful recipe and not that difficult.  The roux is important but everyone's flour, stove and choice of fat may be different and therefore the timeing of cooking the roux may vary.  Mine was a nice dark brown in about 12 minutes. Don't feel that you must cook your roux for a full 15-20 minutes. Go by the color.  To stir the roux I use what my mom called a grave whisk; a 3/4 inch oval sping on a wire attached to a handle.  It always does a nice job with a roux. The rest of the recipe is straight-forward. As my wife is not a "pepper-belly" as I am.  I cut the hot sauce to a generous tablespoon and the seafood seasoning(old bay) to 4 tsp.  I did not add any of the cayenne pepper.  I used a 15 oz can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes as I did not have any fresh and also added a 15 oz can of okra. I used all shrimp as crawfish are not available.  I would like to try it with shrimp and a nice firm white fish cut into chunks the next time.  Finely,  I served it over saffron rice with some garlic bread.  A delicious meal.

Ok so let me start by saying.. i am not the chef in the family. That is my wife's job.  I do, however, occasionally surprise the wife with a lovely meal.  After looking for a seafood recipe i came across this gem. 

At first i thought.. this is ALOT of work.  But after reading some of the comments i decided it shouldnt be too bad and gave it a try.

The hardest part of this recipe, imo, is the prep. But this is always the worst part for me.  haha.. no but the hardest part of this recipe is making sure that the roux is perfect. I have never had "roux" before so i cant say if i made it good or bad but i did get it to the think peanut buttery look that is mentioned in the recipe.  I used a silicon spatula and kept moving the liquid constantly for 15 minutes. My arm is still sore!  ;-)

Alot of people mention this being very spicy. My wife and i thought it was just right.  There is a perfect balance of flavors. You can really taste every ingredient in this dish.  It was absolutely delicious.  My wife LOVED it and that's all that matters!!!

Substitiutions:
- couldnt find fish stock so i used clam stock instead
- for seafood seasoning i used Old Bay Seasoning
- couldnt find crawfish so i used chicken. I used about 1-2 pounds (2 big pieces..didnt measure) and cut it into bite sized pieces.  I browned the chicken separately and then put it in the sauce about 10 minutes before the shrimp.  Came perfect.
- Lousiana-style hot sauce.. i used Tobasco..didnt know what else to use

Excellent Etouffe! I always use butter when making the roux and I just added spices to taste--didn't measure but I am sure it was close.  Such an authentic dish.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Fantastic! Used equal amounts of butter and flour for the roux, red and yellow peppers and canned diced tomatoes.  Fish stock and crawfish not available here so I just boiled the shrimp shells for the stock and used all shrimp.  Didn't add the hot sauce or cayenne and it was plenty spicy for us.  I multiplied the recipe by 4 and used 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of my shrimp stock for the liquid and used a cup of butter and a cup of flour for the roux .  I ended up with a great thick sauce which was perfect.  Now I have plenty to freeze for future meals.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very rich but excellent. I found out that I am not a big fan of standing over the heat for 20 minutes while making roux but it was worth it in the end. The only thing I did differently is that I used shrimp stock in place of the fish. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good basic recipe.  I've experimented some with roux, and am not at all convinced that there's any reason it needs to be cooked this slowly; just be very careful not to burn it, but as long as you reach the proper color evenly, it only needs a few minutes .

This is it!!! My first attempt at Etouffe and my aunts (some of the best cooks in my family) would be proud! I am from New Orleans (born and raised) but never knew how to cook etouffe to match my older aunts & This recipe was as close as I've ever come.  Now it is not there's by no means, but it would run a good race :).  I did add chicken and sausage to my stew, as this is a trend in our family version.  I also added every garlic and left our the hot sauce and just added more cayenne pepper.  Finally, for the fish stock. I don't buy it. Whenever I buy fresh seafood, I boil the shells in a big pot of boiling water with some salt and pepper or cajun seasoning. Once it gets to a rolling boil, I use a colander to seperate the water from the shells. I save (even freeze) the broth and this is the stock I use for all my seafood dishes.  It is way better than the store bought stuff.  

This recipe was awesome and I will be making it again.

Awesome recipe! Changes made: used butter instead of oil. My roux only took about 5 minutes to become "peanut butter color" but I had a very heavy bottomed pan. Added more garlic and less celery. Used 1 T of Old Bay, 1/2 T Cajun seasoning and only 1 T of hot sauce. Wish I had used more as it was a little mild. Or next time, will use Tabasco instead of Texas Pete. To make the fish stock, I used one can of chicken broth (14 oz) and simmered it with the shrimp shells. Used the whole 14oz of liquid and glad I did as it made it a bit more "saucier". Considering hubby went back for thirds, will definitely be making this again!!

No offense, Sweet Pea, but I have to agree with Sugar520 and Missvee11.  I've lived in Louisiana for 50+ years and if it's got tomatoes in it, it's a Creole, not an Etouffee.  But that's just semantics in the end.  This had a decent flavor, though I couldn't make myself use oil for the roux--I find that bacon drippings give a roux that extra layer of flavor, which is especially important when working with the delicate flavors of some seafoods.  And a freshly-made roux will be too hot to throw the veggies in.  Better to cool it down a bit--or even add the stock first, then add veggies and simmer.  Also, definitely had to reduce the amount of hot sauce.  If you use a good quality hot sauce, you can get the zing you want with about 1/4th that amount.  Another trick learned from my Auntie Marie is when you use tomato/tomato products in a recipe, add a small amount of sugar to cut the bitter taste--a teaspoon or less is sufficient.

Fabulous! I doubled the amount of green pepper and added 6 big tomatoes instead of 2. I also used clam juice since it was all I could find, only shrimp (no crawfish), and no hot sauce. This is great served in a bowl over some brown rice, with cornbread on the side.

FAN-TASTIC!!!  It is not a hard dish to prepare.  We used shrimp and sausage instead of crawfish b/c we already had it on hand.  Turned out fantastic!  I browned the sausage and then prepared the roux in the sausage grease.  YUM!  We halved the spice and it was STILL too hot for our taste.  Next time I will use 1 Tbsp Franks red hot sauce and no cayenne.  Thanks for the recipe.  LOVE IT!!

My husband LOVED this- he is a big spicy, cajun lover.  I did not even have shrimp or crawfish so used chicken and tofu...still good.  I used about 3 fresh tomatoes.  It's pretty tiring making the roux, but worth it.  Make sure the oil is hot before you add any flour.

Five stars for a reason! Really delicious recipe and not difficult to make. Don't let the roux scare you... it's a cinch. Just keep an eye on it. I got mine to the correct stage after only five minutes on medium. The trick is to get the roux nutty and toasted. Trust your judgment. When it is fragrant and deep brown, it's done. Don't overcook it.

We used Crystal hot sauce and cayenne to taste,  Chef Paul Prudhomme's  Seafood Magic seasoning blend, and threw in a bit of Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning instead of salt. Go easy with it, since it doesn't take much with the other seasoning.

If you aren't able to find crawfish tails (check the frozen case), I recommend you just double the shrimp and prerepare to be wowed! :)

Excellent! I will definately make this again.  Big hit! I used 2 lbs. of shrimp. I also omitted the cayenne and hot sauce because I was feeding a large crowd, a few don't like spicy food. Old Bay was what I used for seafood seasoning. The "roux" was thin, I'm used to a flour/butter roux becomming a paste. This was liquid. Not sure if that was right, but it was outrageously delicious! Also made Hurricane Cocktails, hush puppies, buttermilk corn bread and red beans and rice. All recipes from this site. Great dinner!

I love to cook but I had never made etouffe before.  I was supposed to bring some to a family function that was made by a coworker...but it wasn't enough.  I decided to try my hand at it today.  It was surprisingly easy and it was a HIT with the family. My Louisiana college grad daughter, my culinary educated daughter and her Louisiana heritage boyfriend were loving this dish to the exTreme'.   Slight changes made: One 14.5 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes to replace the 2 tomatoes.  1 TBSP Tony Chacheres, 1/2 TBSP Old Bay, 1/2 Tsp Cayene Pepper.. (I kinda eyeballed these spices) Used only Shrimp...nothing against crawfish. 1/2 C. clam juice and 1C. chicken stock.  (again eyeballed).  We'll make with Chicken and sausage next time for my friend who doesn't eat seafood.  Also: Next time I will saute the veggies before making the roux. No biggie...but veggies just saute quicker outside of the roux.  We'll see how that works.

Great recipe and wonderful dish.  I noticed a number of people had trouble finding fish stock - be advised that a great stock can be made by using the shrimp peelings as well as a few whole shrimp, a bay leaf, some celery, onion and pepper scraps in water set to boil then simmer for about 20 minutes then rough strain into a bowl.  Quick and easy and it works beautifully in this recipe .  No need to buy fish stock.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! Made it for The Hubbs (a Cajun food fanatic) and he absolutely loved it. Like most, I used shrimp (about 2 lbs or approx 6 dozen large) and made shrimp stock using the shells (with celery, onion, carrot, bay leaf, thyme, a touch of garlic, S&P - start with 3.5 qts water and reduce to 1/5-2 qts). I also used 1.5 sticks unsalted butter with about 1 to 1.5 c flour to make my blond roux. I used the 2 tbs Old Bay, 2 tsp home-made blackening seasoning, and 2 tbs Franks Hot Sauce (would have used Lousiana but used the remainder up last week on eggs!). All-in-all, it was not too hot/spicy, but left a nice low "burn" after swallowing. Up front, it's just all flavor. I must say, this is a definite keeper. We'll be making it with fresh crawfish after our next fishing trip. Don't ruin it with using frozen, peeps. If you can't get fresh, use shrimp. You won't be disappointed.

I doubled the recipe and 6 people almost ate the entire thing! It was a big hit. I did make a few changes. I used 5 lbs of crawfish and threw in a few of the heads. I used bay seasoning instead of seafood since i couldnt find any and clam juice instead of fish broth.  I also added some corn and sausages and they were great with this sauce!  The boux was easy just time consuming. IMPORTANT start off with very little hot sauce. I used tapitio which is pretty much the same. So doubling the recipe I only used 1.5 tbsp tapitio and it was pretty spicy. Sooo good definitely will make again!

Excellent.  Glad I read the reviews about the spices.  My husband thinks I've been a little heavy handed lately.  So I cut back in this recipe.  Half the seafood seasoning was enough.  Had my own seafood stock which I combined with clam juice. Added sausage and left out crawfish.  Served over brown rice.  Will make again and again and again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  If you're brave enough to clean your own whole shrimp, you should take the time to replace the fish stock with homemade shrimp stock.  Take the shrimp heads and boil them in water for 20-30 minutes.  Then use a cup of the strained liquid with this recipe.  It really adds more shrimp flavor the the dish.

I totally love this recipe.  I did it pretty much exactly as it was listed, except for adding in some other seafood.  I not only used shrimp and crawdad, but also added a 1.5 lb. fillet of flounder and a half pound of bay scallops.  I also went heavy on the veggies.  I will make this one again!

Excellent recipe.. I have made this twice now and it is very good. Although one family member says it is too spicy even though I don't put in the cayenne or the hot sauce. Can we all say WIMP?

This was awesome,  I omitted the cayenne but added extra old bay seasoning and Louisiana until it was perfect.  Burnt my first Roux but the 2nd turned out great.  Made a side of white rice to serve it over.  Had left overs the next morning right out of the fridge, didn't even bother to heat it up, it was that good.  Thanks!

Was out of hot sauce, so I used sriracha. It added some heat and cleared sinuses, but it was still awesome. I also doubled up on the shrimp instead of bothering with the crawdads. Served it with rice cooked in chicken broth. It was a hit.

Great recipe! Equally good with either crawfish or shrimp. I put an extra stick of butter and also some bay leaves in the mix for some extra flavor and decadence. Recommend that you season to taste rather than add the full amount with both the cayenne as well as the hot sauce.

This is amazing! We made it for fat tuesday. Put in a  three pound bag of crawfish (before shelling). I would definately make this one again. Thank you. UPDATE: I have made this using pre-shelled crawfish and for some reason the taste suffered a lot, so I will go on shelling them from now on. I also read that to have about a pound of meat, it might be necessary to buy up to 5 pounds in the shell.

I wasn't that impressed with it.  I cut the cayenne and hot sauce in half, which still left it with quite a kick.  But otherwise, this was pretty bland.  Pretty disappointing.

Sooooo good.  Used langostines instead of crawfish, and small salad shrimp.  I left out the hot sauce and cayenne so people could add as desired.  Served this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit.  Reheats well too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I hosted a "Rajun' Cajun'" night and this etouffee was gone in a FLASH.  For the love of GOD make this.  Be very careful not to burn the roux.  I picked up the phone because my husband was calling from a different state.  It was only about a 4 minute conversation, and I TOTALLY burned it.  Had to start all over.  Watch it like a HAWK.

Used clam juice instead of fish stock, cut the seasonings in half.  It was fantastic. 

I think next time I'll do just crawfish - but that's my person preference.

Awesome!  I headed the warning on the spice and only did one tbsp of the hot sauce with the cayene pepper and it was plenty hot for us.  I used shrimp and andouille sausage and it was perfect.

good, although I use 1/4c butter and less flour to make the roux. The seafood seasoning is critical, I used Paul Prudhomme's.

This is the most authentic etouffee recipe I've ever found. It's amazingly delicious. I usually make it with just shrimp or crawfish, not both, and I've even made it with chicken. I would even eat it without meat because it's just that good.

Great recipe! Easy and restaurant quality. Like many people, I could not find fish stock, so I used chicken. Also cut back a bit on the hot sauce. We were very pleased with the results. This was my first attempt at a roux and I was a little concerned that I had burnt it, but it was perfect. I thought it had a slight burnt odor, but from what I read on other sites, that's normal and you'll know for sure if you've burned it! I have leftover chicken, shrimp and smoked sausage from dinners this week so I plan to make this again tomorrow to clean up the leftovers! My husband also liked this over rigatoni pasta like a Cajun restaurant he used to eat at in KY served it. Probably not authentic, but another good option!

This is delicious and not too spicy.  I did have to sub chicken stock for the fish stock because I couldn't get my hands on any fish stock.  It still turned out beautifully.  I will make this again for sure.

The roux is AMAZING. I used clam juice and tried crab in it. The crab was not my favorite. However, on the roux alone it gets ALL the stars!

Fantastic! I also used all shrimp, since crawfish is not readily available in my area. It does take prep time peeling 2lb of shrimp but well worth it!

I used double shrimp and omitted crawfish. I also couldn't find fish stock so I used clam nectar from a can which I found near the canned tuna. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was pretty good. I didn't think it was too spicy but I felt it was missing something. The seafood seasoning I used was salt-free so I added salt but still felt it needed something else. Will probably make again and try some Cajun seasoning. Also, my roux only took about 5-6 minutes to get to a peanut butter color.

BiL made this for Christmas - it was absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  On the spicy side so if you don't like that spicy hot kick you may want to back off just a bit.  He only had a little left because we were all so full, lucky for him.

I had family over for soup night.  This was gone within the first ten minutes!!!  In fact, the other three soups were leftover but I was asked several times if I had more of the etouffe!  Will make it again tonight since this has become my husbands favorite meal.  Thank you for this recipe!

I just made this last week and I have to tell you it's so easy... and delicious. I peeled, cut and prepared all of the ingredients the night before so all I had to do was make my roux and dump everything together. I am glad I did. It took a while to prep, but the cooking, once the roux was built was easy. I should have kept the celery in for crunch and I used White Clam sauce instead of fish stock because I could not find any. I am glad I did it just added another seafood. Next time I won't add as much - it was a little watery with a 10.5 oz. can and only do shrimp since that's what my husband requested. All in all from one southern girl to another, this one is a keeper!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! Couple modifications (just a matter of taste and ingredient availability): took it easy on hot stuff - added only a little bit of cayenne. Also didnt add any crawfish. Other than that - followed the recipe to a T, made a double batch and had great dinners for a few days. Thank you for the recipe! Keeper.

I can't make any claims regarding authenticity since I've never had Etoufe before, but hubby and I both enjoyed it, and a coworker who is from LA said it was good.  I used 2 lbs. shrimp since I didn't have crawfish.  I didn't think the process was difficult, but it is a very spicy recipe (and I'm no wimp when it comes to heat--grew up on Indian curry).  As someone else said, hold back since you can always add but can't take away. It's 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought it tasted oily (next time, will use 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter or reduce the oil) and the shrimp end up overcooked if you follow the recipe.  I would toss in the shrimp, simmer for just a minute or so, turn off the heat, and let the shrimp slowly cook in the sauce--it's hot enough and shrimp go from delicious to rubbery very fast.

Very good. It is hard to find fish stock so I used clam juice which can be found in almost any grocery store in the tuna aisle. i used crabmeat (real not imimation) instead of crawfish. Overall a good seafood dish will make again.

This was really good!  Both of my parents are on low carb diets so I didn't put it over rice, but that would have been good!  I just used shrimp and no crawfish because it would have been too hard to find.  It didn't really taste like our favorite Cajun restaurant's etouffe, but it was still very very good!

Roux: 1/3 cup veg oil, 1/3 cup flour. no need for butter.  mix and cook on very low heat, stirring now and then until flour is cooked to darker than cafe late color.  at the same time chop vegetables.
Fish Stock: boil 3 cups water with the shrimp shells + some garlic + Cajun seasoning salt - presto, great fish stock!  remove solids and use all of resulting stock.  
Shirmp: if using very large shrimp, chop into two or three pieces. makes it easier to eat.
Hot Sauce and Cayenne:  don't really need the cayenne.  add hot sauce a little at a time checking the level of spicyness.
Seasoning:  Cajun seasoning also works great.

This was EXCELLENT! only made a couple of changes, as follows: I'm a celiac so can't use regular flour for the roux, I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour, cooked quicker and thickened beautifully. I could only find whole crawfish (in Pittsburgh, PA) and didn't want to clean them so I substituted 1/2 lb of langostino tails with 1 1/2 lbs shrimp. I didn't add the cayenne, it was just the right heat for us without it. I used 1 can Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted diced tomatoes instead of the fresh chopped tomatoes. Hubby used to live in Houma Louisiana and says this was excellent, I served it over brown rice and made Limoncello Gelato with fresh raspberries and a raspberry sauce and mint sprig for dessert. EXCELLENT Valentines Day meal. Served with Kobel Sweet Cuvee champagne.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and I found that it tatsed way too floury. Good flavour, but I think I'll stick to cornstarch to thicken my sauces.

I halved this recipe, and added 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis (drained) instead of the fresh tomato, and left out the hot sauce and cayenne. I also used chicken stock instead of fish stock, and a pound of shrimp instead of 1/2 each of the shrimp and crawfish. I served it over cheese grits. Really good - will make again.

A good dish.  I didn't have any fish stock or anything to make my own...so I used the water drained from a can of tuna to get about 1/2 a cup and then used Veggie stock for the other 1/2 cup.  Used Sirracha for our hot sauce....and I added Tofu, since we eat low carb.  Turned out yummy.  My 2 year old ate the tofu up..

This was a great recipe, but my friend has one that is better (he won't share).  His has cream in it and I may try to add it to this next time I crave Etouffe to see the result.

This was my first attempt at anything cajun, and the results were delicious!  I doubled the shrimp for lack of crawfish and it was super tasty!

I made this recipe using all shrimp because my grocery store didn't have crawfish. My husband is a total foodie and an etouffe lover and he raved about it. 
The recipe easily made enough to feed the 2 of us a couple of times and me once for lunch at work.
I used jarred clam juice because I had it instead of the fish stock, skipped the cayenne and the louisiana hot sauce, and added some cajun seasoning (penzeys) again, because that's what I had on hand. 
I will make this again whenI can get some crawfish.

The we have a cajun restaurant in Portland called the Montage.. they have an amazing crawfish etouffe that I've been trying to replicate. This wasn't quite it, but still very good. Thanks Rhonda!

This was awesome! I used sausage in place of the crawdads (couldn't find those at this time of the year) and Lobster Better Than Bullion and water instead of fish stock. It was wonderful! I served it with some greens and polenta.

Excellent!  I made my own fish stock with the shells of the shrimp (no crawfish where I live).  Peeled shrimp, some had eggs too, put in pot and covered with water, brought to boil, then lowered heat and simmered for about an hour.  Cooled, filtered and had enough to freeze for my next batch.  I served with brown basmati rice that I bake in the oven for an hour.  The house smelled wonderful!  I didn't have Louisiana style sauce, but made the trip to store for it and I'm glad I did.  Wouldn't have been happy using Tabasco!

Used only shrimp. Kept "heat" on the side because of the kids. However I did add a little cayenne. Also used clam juice instead of fish stock. Awesome!

I made this last week to sample for when all of my children will be here at the same time later this month.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe said, with the exception of not adding the cayenne pepper and without the Crawfish ( didn't know where to find it). It was amazing!!!!!!  We loved it. I will be making this recipe over and over again. Thank You!!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and very easy. The only thing I changed was to use 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning and 1 tablespoon of old bay seasoning in place of the seafood seasoning. I also did not add the hot sauce or cayenne - it was plenty spicy for me. 

I would give it 10 stars if possible!

Decrease Louisiana hot sauce from 2T to 1/2T; omit optional cayenne pepper. That will be plenty hot enough!

I'm sure this is tasty but no self respecting Cajun would put tomatoes in their étouffée. This sounds like a New Orleans (Creole) recipe. A roux made with oil & butter is how we begin. Then we add veggies and any crawfish fat we can get. It's very simple.

To make this really easy use: 1 can Campbell's gumbo soup and 1 can cream of shrimp or chicken or celery.  Just before serving add the shrimp.  Serve with brown rice

Great recipe! I burned the first batch of roux, making it in a dutch oven isn't advised to much room and heat, also ruined a good spatula in the process! :) Turned the heat down to 4 on my electric, used the smallest skillet I have w/a silicone spatula and it worked! Ended up chocolate instead of pb colored but it tasted great. Followed the recipe closely except used 1 tbl hot sauce, 1 tbl cajun seasoning, omitted the black and cayene pepper, used 1 1/2 lbs cubed cooked chicken instead of crawfish and a cup of chicken broth in place of fish stock. Served it w/some French Bread (a must) to mop up the roux-broth.  Will be making again! Unless you chop veggies like a ninja the prep did take me longer than 20 min but I also had to cube & fry the chicken in a little butter.

This recipe has been requested by everyone who had it.  Next time I will have to triple the recipe!  Instead of buying fish stock I used the stock that I made when I boiled the shrimp and crawfish.  The boil had lemons, garlic, onion and a packet for seafood boil.  I also used creole seasoning and zattarans seasoning.

This is absolutely delicious. I had no fish stock on hand...but I had shrimps with heads on them.  I peeled them and simmered the shells and the heads with onions, garlic, celery and salt for about 15 minutes.  Would've simmered it longer but I was hungry.  The flavor was amazing.  I advise anyone who has the time to make their own stock to do so.  It makes such a difference.  I also cut the heat in half.  I love heat and I couldn't imagine adding the other half. I had it over brown rice. This will definetly be a weekly dish at my house.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I ask my husband to rate the meals I cook for him so I know what to cook again.  Usually I get 8-10.  This is the first time he rated my cooking an 11.  This recipe was just wonderful.  I followed it almost exactly except I subbed butter for oil and used more hot sauce in addition to the cayenne.  I served it with honey cornbread (another recipe from allrecipes.com).  If you like seafood and you like it hot, this is the recipe for you!!!

Delicious recipe!  I had not successfully made roux before.  I'd always been paranoid about burning it, but I went ahead and cooked on medium, stirring constantly w/ spatula, for 20 minutes, and it browned up perfectly!  I think burning must be such a problem, because people walk off and leave it cooking.   Used 1 can stewed tomatoes w/ onions & peppers.  Also, I used only crawfish and boiled up the shells for fish stock.  The crawfish had already been seasoned, so I just threw a little of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning in at the last.  PERFECT!

I really liked this recipe. I did not have any crawfish so I doubled the shrimp. And somehow I forgot to put the tomatoes in, I was busy cooking biscuits and forgot. It still turned really good, except it was alittle watery. GREAT RECIPE!!!

This is simply awesome...maybe it was because I had Zydeco music playing as I was making this for my wife and I or it could be that it is the best Etouffee recipe out there.  I went with crawfish only, which we both like more than shrimp, and it really brought us back to when we spent our vacation in Nawlin's last year.  I only modified the recipe by using butter instead of veggie oil.

This recipe is perfect as is. I made it for my husband, who's from southern Mississippi and he'd never had better etouffe!

EXCELLENT!  I left out the hot sauce and cayenne and made it with chicken, cut into bite sized pieces, and chicken broth. ( I didn't have any seafood on hand and was in the mood to make this :). )

My boyfriend seems to really like this recipe, but I think it's just okay.  For the effort it takes to make it, I expected something more.  The shrimp etouffe is yummy, but making the roux takes a bit of time.  This dish goes great with rice because of the roux.  We've made if a few times and have always used just shrimp.

Loved this!! Easy to make but I personally like extra "sauce" so next time i will probably double the amount of fish stock. Otherwise this was sure a hit!

So delicious.  Where I live, all seafood is found in the freezer section, but it was still to die for.  I was afraid the crawfish might overpower the dish after it was in the fridge for a day, but the left overs are just as good as fresh.  I left out the hot sauce and just let everyone add however much the wanted.  And I added a lot of salt after plating.

Used half EVOO and half butter first time and burnt the roux. My fault. Used half butter and veggie oil second time and was perfect.  Added back fin crab meat (blue crab) because didn't have enough crawfish. Subbed Vegetable stock for fish because hubby allergic.  Was delicious. Served with 12 splashes of hot sauce, plus more at table. Perfect heat/flavor balance.  Can't wait to make again!

I made this for my husbands birthday as a surprise since its a favorite of his. He raved on and on about it ,that it was better than the pricey restaurants version. And NO it's not difficult to make at all! A bit spicy for me,but easily corrected. We had it over mashed potatoes (!) since that was also a favorite side of his.

Excellent recipe and quite simple to make. It just requires a little patience.

Here are the changes I made: used chicken stock instead of fish sauce, did not use crawfish but substituted some breast of chicken cut up into small pieces. The ratio was about two-thirds shrimp and one-third chicken. Included all the veggies in the recipe but also added a few mushrooms and some green onions. Used about half a teaspoon of very hot pepper flakes in addition to the hot sauce because we like it spicy.

The end result was awesome. It took me a total of about 45 minutes including prep time. The only part that requires care is the preparation of the "roux" - just do it under medium heat taking time to stir it constantly. It reached the medium brown color in about 12 minutes. I did use more veggies than the recipe called for which meant that I had to add a little chicken stock when cooking the veggies after adding it to the roux. Added the chicken pieces at the same time that I added the veggies since the chicken takes more time than the shrimp to cook.

Anyway, a first rate recipe ...... and the time it takes is well worthwhile.

I only used shrimp and veggie broth because that's all I had. Really nice flavor - definitely want to add the spice as you go - I only used about half of what was called for. Served it over white rice with hush puppies on the side.

This is my first time making this dish, and I have to say it is pretty good. I would have ranked this 3 1/2 stars but, that is not a option. I cut down the cayenne and hot sauce by half and that was good for me. I love spicy food, but thats a lot of heat.  Thanks for the recipe, overall it was very good.

This was my very first roux recipe, and I'm very happy to say it came out fabulous! Thank you for sharing! This recipe is so simple and packed with flavor. I have to admit I thought it would be boring but sooo glad I made this. The only thing I would try to change next time would be the amount of oil used to make the roux.

Absolutely fantastic.  I subbed a pound of hot italian sausage for the crawfish tails and used "Slap Ya Mamma" cajun seasoning with no hot sauce.  You can always kick up the heat after.  I also used the shrimp shells, onion, celery, garlic and carrot to create the stock.  Only added work was to slice up the sausage and brown it beforehand.  Absolutely delicious and very easy!

Delicious! I absolutely cannot stand shrimp, but this was so amazing. I had this in New Orleans, and this is even better than that! I substituted with chicken broth and used only shrimp. I also didn't have garlic, so I put garlic granules instead.

I tried to follow this as recipe as closely as possible.  I could not find fish stock so I made my own by boiling a small cleaned bass with an onion, some carrots,bell pepper, celery and parsley in my crock pot on high over night.  I put everything in and filled to the top with water.  It had decreased by about 1/2 over night.  I ended up with 4+ cups of delicious stock.  I also used a good Slovacek, Texas smoked sausage instead of the shrimp.  I did use the crawfish.  It was the most delicious Ettouffe ever.  My husband ate 3 big bowls and started talking like a cajun.  LOL

Really good, and really easy.  My hubby loves Cajun food. I just learned to make gumbo and so I'm getting the knack of making a roux.  I only had 1 lb. of shrimp and no crawfish so I added some chicken instead.  And I also didn't have diced tomatoes; used crushed tomatoes which was turned out ok. I know next time will be better with diced. But the whole family loved it!

This was very good.  I took some others advice and used 1.5 lbs jumbo shrimp and  omitted the red pepper flakes and reduced hot sauce to 1/2 tsp.  It still had some heat and my family loved it and I will  definitely use this recipe again.

Sooo yummy! Since we recently moved away from the Gulf Coast, I subbed in sausage for the seafood, but it was still awesome! I used Steamboat Bill's Creole seasoning and omitted the other spicy stuff.

My boyfriend and our roommate made this for a group meal a few weeks ago using this recipe. We doubled the shrimp and omitted the crayfish, since it wasn't readily available. Delicious! I will definitely be making this myself in the future.

Me and my boyfriend loved this dish and it was fun and easy to prepare. We aren't into crawfish so instead we doubled the shrimp and we added at least twice as much hot sauce and cayenne pepper because we love spicy food and it turned out great! We will definitely be having this again!

Wow!  This is literally the greatest thing that I have ever cooked.  Thank you for posting.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little beer when making my roux, and I used a vegetable stock because I forgot to make fish stock.  I also added the cayenne pepper quite liberally to taste.  Yum!

Edit:  I reheated the leftovers three days in a row.  I think that I could eat this daily, maybe switching up the protein a bit.  Awesome.  Thanks again Rhonda!

Made this last night, and it was delicious.  Definitely need to go heavy on the spices, otherwise it can taste rather bland.

Serves great over cornbread!

Wow! This recipe was absolutely gorgeous: smell, taste, texture ... everything. I've been to, have eaten in and have family in Louisiana, and this recipe takes me there. The visual cue in the recipe about the color of the roux, absolutely spot on. Thank you for this wonderful, and wonderfully easy, recipe!

Good recipe but being from Louisiana, I have never known nor have I ever used tomatoes in an etouffee. This seems more of a creole than a true etouffee.

LOVED THIS!! The whole family did.  Has some zip to it if you use the full amount of spices. Couldnt find crawfish, so I used all shrimp.  It smells amazing while its cooking. Served it with rice and cornbread. Cant wait to make it again.

This was a wonderful dish that was fairly easy to cook, as long as you pay attention. I made a few changes for myself, though the original recipe is just fine.
1)Added 1 diced jalapeno pepper with the green pepper
2)Added 3 cloves of garlic, instead of 2
3)Used Old Bay Seasoning for the seafood seasoning, didn't add paprika, and only added 1 tablespoon of hot sauce. It's got just a HINT of spice, so if very spicy food bothers you, follow my recipe, perhaps sans the jalapenos, and you'll love it.
4) Couldn't find crawfish at Kroger, so I used imitation crab meat. Delicious! Get it chunk-style.

I served it over some Cajun-style dirty rice and a side of Southern-style buttermilk cornbread. Loved it!

Very good!  Unfortunately we do not live anywhere close to where we can get crawfish so we used prawns and small shrimp instead.  The flavour was delicious and would love to try it one day with crawfish!

The roux is the most important part.  Cook according to instructions, and it will be perfect.  I add my spices during the 'darkening' faze of the process and use Creole Seasoning, Shrimp Seasoning and Cajun Dutch Spice til the smells just about make the spit drip down my chin! One of the few recipes on this site that I would not change.  Don't mess with a good thing!

This was fabulous. I used chicken stock instead of fish stock. I used 1 can of tomatoes, 1 & 1/2 lbs of small shrimp. I used 2 tablespoons of seafood seasonings but did not use the cayenne or hot pepper sauce. It was still too hot so i will use less next time. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This was AWE-some.  Much better than what we had at a restaurant just last week.  I followed the spirit of the recipe, but had a few changes due to what I had in the house and from being a hot sauce wimp!  I did go out and buy the fish stock, shrimp & crawfish, but thought I had the most of the fresh veggies at home.  Turns out I didn't have fresh, so I used a bag of frozen Cajun veggies (bell pepper, celery & onion) and added a chopped bunch of green onions.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have fresh.  Fish Stock:  I found it in the frozen section in a 2C container.  I wasn't sure what I would use the rest for so I used it all in here.  I poured about a 1/3 cup of Cajun seasoning blend (from this site) into it and it was just right for me.  Hubby added hot sauce to his after serving.  Definitely a keeper!

My hubby worked in Baton Rouge 14 years ago, and has ever since raved about the Crawfish Etouffee. I've tried making it a few times before and it was never "right" (I used the recipes calling for cream of mushroom soup. :P)   This one nailed it! I made it for his birthday today and he was THRILLED. I posted a picture. We served it over rice, and I will say it was spicy!

I make a very similar recipe- same ingredients, different amounts. Only I serve it over a bed of cornbread that I have broken apart in small chunks. Great sweet/spicy combo! Everyone loves it - even people who voice an adversion to certain ingredients!! Try the cornbread! Yum!!

This is pretty awesome!  Being from Louisiana, I have tried different recipes to see if I can find "THE ONE"....and this is it.  The only thing I did different was use chicken broth, as I didn't have any fish stock.  It was great.

This was great!  A lot of chopping if you don't have a food processor, and stirring the roux for 20+ minutes was a teeny bit tedious, but well worth it!  It was fabulous!  I went easy on the hot sauce and added zero cayenne due to my other half having a low tolerance to spices, and it turned out fabulous!

This is a great recipe.  I added catfish nuggets and precooked shrimp about 5 minutes at the end. I did not have the fish broth so the catfish nuggets was my litte substitute.  It turned out great.

I love the flexibility of this recipe.  I am not a fan of celery, so I substituted fresh okra (I sauteed the okra in oil for 20 minutes prior to adding to the recipe).  That worked well :)  My husband does not like crawfish, so I substituted 1 lb of cooked, diced chicken breast to the recipe at the same time that I added the vegetables.  That also worked well :)  Instead of fish stock, I used chicken broth.  My family loved the resulting dish -- this is definitely a keeper!!

I substituted crab meat for the crawfish because there was no crawfish at the fish market. It was great! Even DH loved it, and lemme tell ya, he's a tough customer. It took quite a while, because of the roux, but it turned out perfectly (if I do say so myself). Very spicy, hearty, and filling. Pretty rich, too.

Other mods I made were butter instead of oil, and I used one tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning instead of two (the crab made it saltier already). We drank a French Alsace riesling with it, which was fab with the spice.

Absolutely Fantastic. I served this for a party that I had, doubled the recipe, served over rice and fed well over 25 people. Not a drop left at the end of the night. My friends keep asking when Im going to make it again.

Wow, this one was a real treat! I lived in New Orleans for a few years, and this really took me back. Absolutely delicious, even better as leftovers!

I used chicken stock instead of fish (that's what I had on hand), all shrimp and no crawfish, butter instead of vegetable oil, and only added a couple dashes of tabasco (instead of 2 tbsp + cayenne, since hubby doesn't do spicy). Even cutting the hot sauce waaay back, it was still a little too spicy for him. Go figure. I do think it would've been too spicy even for me, if I'd put in 2 tbsp of hot sauce, and I love spicy. 

Delicious, definitely a keeper!! Thank you so much for sharing it, Rhonda!

I LOVE this! My whole family does. I just put in a little less hot stuff for my sensitive ones, and I also add cut up Andouille sausage which gives it even more awesome flavor. It's really not that hard to make. I actually enjoy it. I pour myself a glass of wine while I do my roux and it's done in no time! Enjoy!

Great recipe! Instead of using shrimp I used andouille sausage and it came out excellent. Also, since I have a 6 and 4 year old I had to cut out the hot sauce and cayanne pepper, but it still had really good flavor.

Delicious! Can't wait to make this again! Couldnt find fish stock so I had to use chicken instead and it takes awhile to de vein all those little shrimp but it was well worth the effort! I had my 13 yr old son help me chop, mince and dice to keep things moving along.... it was fun to cook with him and we will for sure be making this again!

Delish! I didn't use as much Cayenne pepper. For my spice blend I used Old Bay blackened and Tony Chacheres creole seasoning 50/50, about 3-4tsp total. I couldn't get my hands on fresh crawfish here in NC, so I used 16 ct Gulf shrimp... this is just soooo good and I've never had authentic etouffe before, but I'm sure this is hard to beat.

I like spicy, but this is too hot -- I'm from New Orleans, and I've never quite understood why some cooks don't allow the diner to control the heat -- you can always add LA hot sauce.  The mix of other seasonings is just right, and I used clam sauce as another reviewer suggested -- excellent.
Easy roux making tip -- use your microwave -- it works great and you don't have to stir it. You can just search "making a roux in the microwave".

Remember a roux is all about equal parts flour and fat.  so adjust flour to 1/4 and unsalted butter to 1/4 as well.

This was a probably one of the best dishes I have made off of this site.  I followed the recipe 98%.  Per a previous reviewer, I did cook the veggies a little longer so they would soften.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used a red pepper from my garden.  For the fish stock, I boiled the shrimp shells with old bay and seasoning salt.  I also used canned diced tomatoes.  I chopped all the veggies before I started because I knew I had to keep an eye on the Roux.  Once the Roux is done, all you have to do is throw everything else in.  It wasn't hard at all to make.  I used the crawfish that you find in Walmarts, in the frozen fish section.  This was awesome.  The ingredients are simple. The seasoning was perfect.  The consistency was perfect.  The taste was better than any restaurant.  This is a must try if you are into seafood.  Next time I will add diced hot sausage.

Great recipe on its own and easy to modify.  Last time I left out green peppers and celery (didn't have 'em) and substituted 1 can of chopped tomatoes and green chilies (again, its what I had).  Dish was still terrific and gone in no time.  Best advice, don't skip on the roux.  Do it exactly as written.

I'm not understanding the comments about it being a lot of work either.  I actually thought there were wasn't an overwhelming number of ingredients.  I used oil, but will try with butter next time as naples34102 used.  Also, I used 1/2 the recommended amount of hot-sauce and it had just the right kick. I did all shrimp and used shrimp bouillon instead of fish stock.  The family loved it!

Really, really good. For those of you concerned with how "spicy" this dish is, it's really based on interpretation. Some people said it was too spicy. I don't think it's spicy at all, and I added the cayenne. It just depends on your tolerance level. Overall, yummy and quite healthy as well.

I made this last night following the directions except for substituting freshly cooked diced chicken breast for the shrimp and crawfish (also chicken stock for the shrimp/fish stock). Most of my crew doesn't like seafood, so I made a landlubber version for them.
In short, this recipe is excellent. The only things I will do different in my next effort will be to add about 1/2 again as much stock, and cook the etouffe longer, to let the crispy veg get a little softer. Flavorwise, it was right on... but the still crunchy texture of the peppers and celery were a distraction. Also, the only other change I made was to use 1/4 cup unsalted butter in lieu of the veg oil, as I never use oil in a roux. I've always just felt butter gives it a little bit more flavor.
All that being said, this recipe is definitely a keeper. I'm already thinking of doing some catfish etouffe based on this.
THANKS for posting this.

Great recipe.  I used only 1 tbsp of the hot sauce because tasted too strong of vinegar for my taste. I then added more cayenne and creole seasoning to add back heat.  I added a little heavy cream to taste and a bay leaf. Good basic recipe.  Serve with rice or crusty bread.

this is as close as you can get to the real thing. I added unsalted butter in the roux...one tbsp. I also used chicken stock. I used a few sprinkles of tabasco sauce because I didn't have any hot sauce. Perfectly spiced. This was amazing!!

WOW so good!!! Instead of Louisiana style hot sauce and cayenne pepper, I used tobasco sauce and curry powder, and had the dish over saffron rice. INSTANT FAVORITE.

This recipe is delish! I doubled the garlic and tomatoes. I added a bit of white wine. I also cheated with the roux. I used roux from a jar. Easy! It was the perfect amount of spice between the louisiana sauce, cyanne pepper and old bay. I served it over rice with garlic bread. I will be making this recipe again.

This is great!  I used unsalted butter instead of oil and I used homemade fish/seafood stock and (don't curse me, we just got 15 inches of snow on Monday before Mardi Gras, so no fresh available) canned tomatoes.  I thought the 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper was a joke on us non-Louisianians.  With all the hot sauce, seafood seasoning and  cayenne why would you need black pepper? Right? But you really do need it, some how it adds a depth that you won't get with out it.
Believe me I'm not going to wait for Mardi Gras to roll (Laissez les bons temps rouler, that is) around again before I prepare this wonderful tasty dish.
Always remember to embrace "joie de vivre" and happy cooking!

My husband and I thought that this was very good, but too salty.  I used canned clams in place of the crawfish and clam stock in place of the fish stock.  Next time I will remember to chop the veggies before I start the roux.  (I had to call my 5 yr old over to stir my roux while I chopped.)  It was still very much enjoyed!

This is EXCELLENT!  I want to give it 5-star +++.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup as the flour, it was fine.  I didn't even use fish stock but used bouillon with water instead.  Also, I didn't have crawfish so I used sweet Italian sausage (sorry).  Be sure to prepare some rice to serve with this yummy etouffe.

Very good recipe, and fun to cook! I couldn't find fish stock, so I used oyster sauce (oriental isle), and added some water to make it more fluid. Didn't use the hot sauce, and it was still slightly spicy. I figured that can be added individually. The flavors were wonderful and the vegetables great! I am looking forward to using variations with sausage, etc. Will definitely cook again!! :)

I made this with chicken stock versus fish stock, & added sliced sausage (organic chicken sausage to keep it fairly healthy). Yum! I served it over brown rice & the whole family loved it. Great recipe!

Made this incredible dish for dinner tonight!  WOW!  Like many others who have rated it, I also used what I had on hand:  chicken stock, Old Bay, frozen shrimp and replaced the crawfish with an andouille sausage.  My first attempt with a roux & it was successful.  The spice level scared me a bit after reading the reviews.  I only used 2T. of the Old Bay.  After serving it over rice, I wish I had more heat! No little one's to worry about.  Plan to make it again the next time my son comes home for a visit.   This recipe will be a regular in our house.  There is a lot of room for creativity!

This was a great change from what I am used to here in Pennsylvania.  I used clam juice in place of the fish stock.  I only had cans of clams so drained the cans and added the leftover clams at the end.  I had to use frozen crawfish and left the juices in.  Next time I will drain the juices as they totally changed the flavor of the final product.  This was a great recipe that will be made again.

WONDERFUL! My hubby and I made this together and we both LOVED it! We used sausage instead of crawfish. Also, clam juice instead of fish stock. We didn't add the cayenne pepper, but sprinkled it on our individual servings as we were eating it. The louisiana hot sauce is VERY HOT, so we only added 1 tablespoon (rather than 2) and it was still really spicey. Also, if you are making this by yourself, make sure you have all the ingredients chopped up and ready before you start. You have to stir this a lot and don't have time to just let it sit on the oven while you are chopping up veggies. DELICIOUS! Will make again and again.

Omg! I'm a full blooded Thibodeaux and feels like I haven't had real Etouffe all these years. The only thing I did different was boiled a cup of water with the shrimp shells to make the stock and used Slap ya mama and Old Bay seasoning. I am addicted to this recipe and it has a beautiful presentation when served. This is by far the most delicious Etouffe I've ever eatin hands down.

AMAZING!!!!  I used all shrimp because crawfish is not available to me.  I used ole bay  seafood seasoning(2tbsp) and found that was plenty enough heat for us, so I omitted hot sauce, pepper, and cayanne.  Can't even imagine how hot it would have been if I added those.  I used butter instead of the oil.  Be sure your peppers, onions, and celery and cooked down the way you like it before you add the other ingredients.  They had a little too much of a bite for my husband.  I was told this was 5 star New Orleans resturant quality.  Delicious!!!!

I don't know much about authentic Louisiana cooking, but I'm trying to learn since I’m married to a New Orleans man. I made this dish for him with a few substitutions based on what I have on hand. I substituted thinly sliced chicken breast for the crawfish; I used homemade chicken stock instead of fish stock, and Tony's seasoning instead of seafood seasoning. I omitted the cayenne pepper and halved the hot sauce. I used Tobasco since that’s what I had. My husband said it was delicious and authentic tasting. It was delicious, but very spicy even with the small amount of hot sauce I used. Our 8yr old had trouble eating it because of the spiciness. Next time I think I will use less hot sauce, or even skip it. The dish has plenty of flavor without it. I will definitely be adding this dish to our family menus.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper.  I subbed chicken stock instead of fish stock and clams instead of crawfish.  I skipped the cayenne pepper and reduced the hot sauce to a teaspoon.  The spice factor was perfect for me.  My husband added additional hotsauce at the table.  I served the dish over rice.

This tasted great!  I chopped my pepper, onions, garlic and celery really small.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used tomato paste...about 3 Tbsp. My seafood seasoning was Old Bay.  I didn't have fish stock handy so I used chicken broth recommended from other reviewers.  Hubby does not like crawfish so I used all shrimp.  Awesome...3 people at work enjoyed the leftovers....and wanted the recipe!

Excellent!  I will make this again.  I found clam juice at Walmart instead of fish stock.  Walmart frozen crawfish tails were perfect.  Hot sauce was 1 Tbsp of Frank's.  Everyone loved it served over white rice or cajun dirty rice.

loved it! Want to remember exactly what I did because I want to make it again. Boyfriend Martin loved it too, which was surprising.  Used butter and rice flour and mixed the 2 together for only about 5 minutes. Added 2 cloves garlic, one onion and celery and cooked for 5 minutes stirring. Added 1 yello pepper. When it started to look brown and like it could burn I added 1 cup of veggie stock and a carton of grape tomatoes each cut in half. Added 1t hotsauce, a splash of Lea & Perrins and a generous shake of paprika. Let cook, covered on low for about 10 minutes, adding a bit of extra water once. Added frozen crab from the market and kept cooking for about 10 minutes, then added fresh scallops and let cook for 6 minutes. Adjusted spices (more hot sauce and lea & perrins and a bit of salt and pepper) and added fresh parsely. Done! and soooo goood!

I had every intention of using both crawfish and shrimp, but peeled crawfish tails were $12.99/lb. so I went with just shrimp.  I think the roux needs to go darker than peanut butter color because the finished product was too light.  I also used my common sense and cut back a bit on the cayenne & hot sauce, and the result was just hot enough for us.  While this was good, I have another etouffe recipe I think is better.

Very good recipe although I find that the roux works best with equal amounts of oil & flour. That eliminates the excess oil that some people had issues with. Also, forget peeling crawfish! ARG! I'll buy the tails already peeled next time. I don't know why this recipe is described as tomato based when there's barely any in it but despite that, I liked it well enough. Thanks for sharing it:o)

LOVED this dish and I will definitely make it again! I didn't have fish stock, so I made shrimp stock using the shells of the shrimp that I was using for the dish.  Also, used 1-1/2 lbs of large shrimp and no crawfish.  Sprinkled with freshly chopped parsley when served.

This recipe is bursting with flavor. I have made etoufee with canned tomatoes and minced onions and garlic in the past, but the use of fresh ingredients in this recipe makes a huge difference.

I subbed beef broth for the fish stock and used frozen crawfish (no shrimp). What a perfect Mardi Gras dish! Thanks!

Very good.  The roux took less time than it said, but it turned out great.  Excellent, and the cayenne is a must for people who like spice. Update:  Made it again, roux was much better, and it was fantastic with only the shrimp, no crawfish.

I am pretty picky on my etouffe as it is my favorite thing to eat most of the time. I can't believe how easy this was and even tasted better than the one that sells for $20 a plate at the nearby chain cajun restaurant. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

Excellent! As others have noted authentic etouffe MUST be made with a Roux --anything  else is stew or soup.  Making a roux is intimidating at first--but just take it slow at low heat & STIR CONSTANTLY -see Paul Prudhomme's cookbooks for a step by step guide. It's WELL worth the effort -the taste is fantastic! I left out the crawfish, too "gamey" for us and my wife who doesn't like hot or spicy food LOVED it. There's nothing better than shrimp and few better usesof it than an authentic etouffe. Try it you'll love it!

Very good.  I served at a Cajun themed dinner party.  Replaced crawfish with second pound of shrimp (due to cost).  My guests were very pleased with the flavour.  Next time, I might add just a bit more seasoning or hot sauce.  I replaced fish stock with chicken broth (as suggested by another reviewer).  I also could not find seafood seasoning and instead used Cajun seasoning.

The flavor was good, I wasn't able to find fish stock so I used chicken instead, which worked well enough. There are a few changes I will make next time if I do this again. The main one would be to cook this much longer than was recomended. 20 was not nearly enough to get the vegetables to the consistancy I prefer. Also, I like etouffe to have a cream sauce, so I will more than likely add some heavy whipping cream to the mixture. The flavors and the seasonings were wonderful though.

this is absolutely perfect!  my family and I loved it!  I felt like the roux was looser than I am  
used to working with--but I think that is smart because it seemed less likely to burn.  
Next time I will probably use a bit less seafood seasoning, because it was just a bit on the too spicy side for my son--but with rice and french bread he ate it fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time. This time I listened to the reviews and didn't add the cayenne pepper. I wish I had. It wasn't spicy enough, but still had excellent flavor. 15 minutes was plenty of time for my roux.

Really good! We felt like you could've used just shrimp & it would've still been a tasty dish. 

Used Chalula instead of Louisiana hot sauce to good effect.

This is outstanding!  I used only shrimp (not crawfish season); used red and yellow peppers instead of green; omitted the tomatoes; used only 1 T of Louisiana Hot Sauce and omitted the cayenne.  It was plenty spicy for us and a huge hit with my teenaged boys!  This will be a regular at our house, especially during Lent.  In fact, have already made it twice.  The second time, I wanted to see if frozen shrimp would work and it did.  I ran them under cool water for a few minutes then drained.  Having leftover peppers, onions, and celery from last week made this batch come together really quickly!  Delicious!  (I used Old Bay seasoning and Swanson seafood stock).

Used only wild gulf shrimp and added red bell pepper. The seafood seasoning made it a bit too salty for my taste. Watched the video & instructions were easy. Served over rice with collard greens.

Super recipe. I only used the seafood seasoning. No cayenne, hot sauce or black pepper. It had a nice bite and I served with a buttermilk cornbread. Delish!

I didn't have fish stock so I used chicken stock in stead.  I also didn't have any crawfish so I used double the shrimp.  
I doubled the recipe but only used 3 tablespoons of hot sauce.  Still very spicy but very delicious.  
Everyone had second helpings.

Having never made etouffe before I was very excited as this recipe seemed so easy. It was a AMAZING me and my family Loved it!!!!! After not being able to find the fish stock I went with chicken stock instead. The flavor was a great. Can't wait to make this again. And the leftovers the next day were even better.

This was very good.  I left out the cayenne pepper and the spice was just right for most of my family.  Those who like a little more spice just added more hot sauce.

I had to substitute chicken stock, but it turned out fabulous!  This is my first time making etouffe, I am so happy it turned out so good.

Thanks!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I make it without any hot sauce or cayenne, and it's still fantastic.  Have made it with all shrimp and also with 1/2 shrimp & 1/2 cooked fish and it's great either way.

Added extra cayenne and went light on the hot sauce. Even after cooking for longer than the expected time the celery was still a little crunchy.  Will probably cook it alone first next time and add the rest later.

VERY VERY good.   I substitute a can of Rotel tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes, you can get the seafood stock at Kroger's and I use one tablespoon of "Old Bay" and one of Tony Chacheres cajun seasoning......I also occasionally add a filet of Salmon during the simmering process and it cooks by the time the crawdaddies and shrimp are done........Tommy

Have never made anything remotely like this before, but had some fresh shrimp so thought I would give it a try.  All I can say is WOW!  Used butter in place of oil and used 1/2 of called for amount of hot sauce/cayenne.  Will be making this one again for sure!

I had never tried to make a rou with oil and i totally burn it. :P So i started over my way and used 1/4 cup butter with the 1/4 flour instead and it took way less time anyway :) The only other change i made was because I had no fish stock i used chicken. It turned out delicious! Oh I didnt add the cayanne pepper or the hot sauce because I was hoping my 3 year old would eat it. I had used old bay seafood seasoning and even that ended up being to spicy for the munchkin. But my husband and I sure loved it and he put Hot sauce on his portion :)

This is a fantastic recipe! I made a few changes. I only used shrimp and used Tony Chachere's More Spice Seasoning instead of seafood seasoning. I also used chicken broth in place of shrimp stock. Recipes still came out great! My favorite recipes on the site!!

I really wanted to LOVE this, and was a bit disappointed.  The dish lacked a depth of flavor that I expect in Cajun food.  I think next time I will use butter instead of the oil and mess with the roux and spices a bit.  I think this has great potential!

This is a complete, out of the ballpark hit with both family and friends. Followed the instructions to the letter except I am addicted to heat and garlic so I "upped" those ingredients a bit. Will continue making this for many, many years!!!

Thank you for this amazing recipe! I have gone to many restaurants looking for a really good etouffe and have been dissappointed when I get a plate of some sort of celery and pepper concoction. And since then I have been looking for the perfect Etouffe recipe to make at home instead. This is deffinately it!

Loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I used Seafood Stock made by Kitchen Basics that I found at a high-end grocery store and Old Bay Rub for the seafood seasoning.

The Louisiana Family Loved It!!!!!!.... I am from Richmond Va . The best coment I recieved was " I cant believe a Yankee Can come to LA and Make it taste exactly like the local fine resturaunts do it." The only thing I changed was I used chicken stock instead of fish stock and went easy on the cayenne.

This was good I had to cut way down on the hot stuff.  Used chicken broth  and canned tomatoes.  Added green onions and Worcestershire sauce.  Family loved it.  There was talk about taking the left overs to lunch at work tomorrow.  :o)

I cant get Crawfish where I am so I used 2lbs of jumbo shrimp, I used chicken stock instead of fish and doubled the garlic. Other than that I followed the recipe. It was absolutely delish!! All my boyfriend kept saying was "oh my goodness this is good", "babe this is really really good" Im not that great a cook but this was really simple. So glad I tried it.

This etoffe was incredible!  It was spicy, but the flavor overrode the heat for those that appreciate good heat!  I am not in a location that readily has crawfish tails available, so I substituted rock shrimp and it was abdolutely fantasic!  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  Rave reviews at my Dinner Party.  Substituted butter for oil and left out cayenne and hot sauce.  Used frozen, fully cooked crawfish and added them the last 5 minutes.  Followed all other directions.  Perfection!

I can't give it 5 starts because I didn't really follow the recipe to the letter. I used white wine instead of fish stock and used sausage, scampi and haddock as the protein. One thing is for certain, the base for this recipe is great for any variation you can imagine.

This dish was a hit with my family.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I substituted pre-cooked chicken for the crawfish and added three bay leafs and about a half cup of okra.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful!!! Oh, this is comfort food at its finest for sure!  Thank you so much for this fabulous, easy recipe!    Don't pass on this one if you don't have fish stock; you can certainly use chicken stock!  I threw all of my leftover seafood in - a filet of salmon, a couple filets of tilapia, a bag of scallops, some shrimp. It was like a seafood chowder ;-)  I did add a tablespoon of butter to the roux to give it a rich finish. Mmmm.  Served over rice and it was great! This is a versatile recipe - you can leave out the "hot" for children - all four of mine gobbled it up!

One of the best things I have ever made. Since I couldn't get any crayfish where I live, I just used another pound of shrimp, instead. It turned out perfect. Thank you.

I made this last minute and had everything on hand.  I used all shrimp and only 1.5 pounds. I did not have fresh tomatos so I used a can of diced.  This turned out so good.  My family loved it and the left overs were even tasty! I served this over white rice.

My husband and I have made this twice and loved it both times!  I especially love that it is a great way to use whatever seafood we happen to pick up - we did crawfish/shrimp the first time, mussels the second and will be using all shrimp when we make it for lunch today.  I also love how easy it was for me to update this recipe to be gluten free.  I can't eat stuff that uses flour as a thickener because of Celiac disease but I was able to use rice flour to make the roux and it tasted really good.  My husband said he couldn't tell the difference.

I tried this recipe with my boyfriend and his family.  He is from Louisiana and he said it had a very authentic taste.  I have to make a few modifications due to the area because in NC it is very hard to find fresh crawfish and fish stock.  I just doubled up on the shrimp and used chicken stock instead of fish stock and it still tasted wonderful.  Also i cut back on the onion and used only half instead.  Still a very tasty dish.  Good Job!

This is by far worth the time and effort! And, it really isn't that much effort! After following the recipe exactly the way it was written, I do have to agree with several other reviews that the extra hot sauce and cayenne isn't necessary. It was almost too hot to eat, almost. I'm a Texas girl and enjoy spicy food, but it was a little too spicy for me. Next time I will just omit the extra hotness!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Everyone that I have made this for has LOVED it! Boyfriend said it was too spicy on the first go, but I thought it was perfect! Dulled it down the next go round, not quite as good, but still passable. Used the Clam juice as some suggested, but subbed with half chicken stock.  Haven't tried it with the crawfish, but I'm sure it's just as good. Can't wait to experiment more with this recipe!

I had to add a can of tomato sauce and more seasonings to give it more taste. We did half the cayenne and hot sauce but had to add Tony's and garlic salt because it was a little blan.

By far one of the best Etouffe recipes around.  If you like spicy food, follow the recipe closely.  Otherwise, use half the cayenne and hot sauce.

Nice blend of flavors.  Thought it was a bit too spicy though (even for this gal from New Orleans!) I will make again and back off of the Louisiana hot sauce--and use only 1 T instead of 2!

I am from South Mississippi, and we are very influenced by Louisiana and it's cajun cooking.  This was a perfect blend of seafood and spices.  Exceptional!

This dish is unbelievably good!  The tomatoes had a nice acid touch and my husband and I made the recipe extra spicy.  That meant more seafood seasoning, more Louisiana Hot Sauce, and more cayenne pepper!  I have no complaints with this well written recipe.

I really wanted an etouffe recipe for chicken but had no idea how to get started.  This one looked good enough to build on.  I had just enough of the ingredients that I didn't bother to go shopping for the things I didn't have.  A few of the substitutions were regular old cajun seasoning instead of seafood, clam juice instead of fish stock and olive oil instead of vegetable for the roux.  Oh, and chicken instead of crawdad tails of course. :)  I served it over quinoa and it turned out to be a big success.

FANTASTIC!!!  My hubbie's delicate innards can't handle too much spice, so I omitted the black pepper and hot sauce (but had them on the side for everyone's personal preference).  Even without all the spice, it was to die for.  Thank you for a great recipe!  It's a keeper in our home!

Although this recipe was pretty labor intensive the end result was definitely worth it!  The only change I made was to use the clam juice instead of fish stock.  Note: For those of you who have never made a roux before, don't use margarine in place of the oil, it doesn't work! :)

I believe one word sums it up best.  Yummy!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper and let people spice it up if they wanted.  I used Old Bay seasoning as the seafood seasoning and it already had a bit of heat.  Overall it was very tasty and my guests all loved it, including the ones who are not fond of seafood.  I doubled the recipe and am happy I did as it all went and I didn't have any leftovers.  Definitely a good choice to start with a roux.  Also a good suggestion to purchase the crawfish at Walmart.  I was skeptical but had no choice as they are rare.  I thawed the crawfish and rinsed it well. It turned out very tasty and the texture was good.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

Very good! Never made or eaten etouffee before but my husband requested it for Mardi Gras. It came out great, even though I only had about 1.25 pounds of shrimp (no crawfish) and only used 1/8tsp of cayenne. Served over rice with cornbread on the side.

I cooked the veggies much longer for the creamier consistency I like.  I used all crawfish (allergic to shrimp) and it was wonderful (and I only burned the roux once...don't give up!).

This recipe is very very good.  I made this about a month ago and forgot to write a review.  My husband absolutely loved this.  He told me it was one of the best meals I have made.  I substituted chicken stock for the fish stock, mainly bc I thought it might make it too fishy tasting.  Turned out perfect.  I thawed out and rinsed frozen crawfish from the seafood market and used fresh shrimp.  Great recipe will be making again very soon.  Thanks for post Rhonda!!

The flavor on this was very good.  We don't have crawfish here, so I used andouille sausage. (I am not a big fan of that sausage, so maybe a kielbasa next time?) My husband said some okra would have made a nice addition, too.

This is a super recipe. Authentic taste and texture. I tweaked the recipe just a bit to accommidate our tastes by adding a chopped serrano pepper for more flavor and heat, however the recipe really is great as written.

This was AWESOME!  Great comfort food - reminds me that cooking is about feeding souls, not filling holes.  

I didn't want to overspice the mixture (I figured I could always add hot sauce before serving) so I just put in one tablespoon of Tony Cachere's seasoning in lieu of the seafood seasoning.  I did not add cayenne and I did not end up needing any hot sauce.  It was perfect!  Also, I did not have fish stock so I just used water.

This was a really great dish. I think the only thing I would do extra is to add more cayenne pepper and more hot sauce. This dish is meant to be SPICY!

This was delicious, I’m actually making it again tonight for company. Try lowering the heat for the first few steps, I had to add more fish stock the first time because it became too thick.

Love, love, love it!  Used chicken broth, a can of diced tomatoes w/garlic & black pepper and only shrimp, but it was fantastic!  Will be making it again and again.

This recipe is soooooooo good and full of flavor. The only thing I did different was instead of oil I used butter. I left out the hot sauce so everyone could spice it up to their own liking at the table. I served it over rice.

This recipe was excellent! Etoufee is one of my favorite creole dishes to eat, so I have to admit I was very intimidated to make it. But it turned out great! I didn’t change much of the recipe at all. Only thing I changed was using clam juice instead fish stock, used no crawfish only shrimp and used only a sprinkle of crawfish. This was excellent over rice and I will make it again and again!

This was good and spicy. Sauce a bit thick and rich for us, but I’m sure just a matter a preference.

It was delicious!  It seemed like 2 tbs of hot sauce would have been a little too hot for me so I cut it in half.   I had to make other changes.  We don't have crawfish anywhere near me so I went with 2 lbs of peeled shrimp and I also decide to cook the onions, celery, garlic and green pepper in oil first and then took them out and put them aside while I made the roux.  I couldn't find fish stock so I used a 8 oz bottle of clam juice and that worked out fine. Once I had the sauce going I put in the diced tomatoes for 5 minutes and then added back in the onions, peppers, celery, garlic mixture and then added the peeled shrimp for 10 minutes until they turned pink.  Served it over rice, but it would probably look better with a formed cup of rice in the center sprinkled with some cilantro or parsley.

In my notes I said pour a glass of wine first.  When making the Roux it helps the time go by quickly. I cut this in half and it works out well.  I also use red bell pepper because my husband doesn't like green and I can hide the red easier.
Good recipe.

It's a tasty dish, but that's a Creole recipe, not traditional Cajun.  There are no tomatoes in Cajun etouffee (no tomatoes in Cajun jambalaya either :-).  Also, if you're using fresh shrimp and pre-cooked crawfish (I live in NOLA and have never seen 'raw crawfish tail meat' for sale) they will be rubber after cooking for 10 mins.  Taste them at 5 mins, and unless you live at high altitude, they'll be done....  Happy Cooking!!!

Oops, forgot to add... Make sure to get ALL the fat and juices out of the package of crawfish tails too.  TONS of flavor in there!!

Two things when making a proper roux: oil and flour should be in equal parts and “peanut butter” color is not dark enough... more like “chocolate”. Roux is not hard.... just keep stirring and keep an eye on it... when it starts to get hot enough, it can change color pretty quickly.

I used all crawfish again, but ran out of liquid shrimp boil (used before for seafood seasoning). Definitely needs that edge, but still full of flavor. I tried 2/3 oil and 1/3 butter for the roux, without much taste difference.

This is definitely a keeper.  The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of oil.  We like things spicy so the recipe was perfect for us, but you could always tone down the spice and let people add more to their liking.  Yum!

Hubby asked for Shrimp Etouffe and I naturally went to Allrecipes.  This is a KEEPER!   Easy to follow instructions and the result was delicious!!!  I only modified a few things:  chicken broth instead of fish stock, butter instead of oil, and all shrimp.  Followed directions exactly and the result was amazing.

We only had Blackened Old Bay so we used that and did not add any hot sauce or red pepper. I did add more stock at the end so it would pour over rice better. Awesome!!

Followed directions according to the recipe and was not disappointed. I love anything cajun or creole and this really scratched that itch. Even my mother liked it (as she’s a very picky eater).

I just made it tonight. Wonderful recipe! For my personal taste I still think something is missing?? I didn't put any cayenne or hot sauce. Other reviewers warned me that it would be too hot. I like hot! And it was perfect without those two ingredients. I lived in Louisiana for five years and although it's not "required" I can't live without catfish with my etoufee (see picture with fish!) I didn't have any fish stock so I used chicken broth and helpful hint: I learned from a food blogger that you can simmer your peeled-off shrimp shells in water or other stock to turn it into "seafood stock"!

This etouffee is delicious!  I wanted just crawfish so skipped the shrimp and served with yellow rice.  It was really spicy so cut back significantly on the cayenne if you don't want a lot of heat.  I cannot wait to make it again.

This was perfect as described. I used more stock and all shrimp. It was excellent and easy. Worth the 15 minutes to make the roux, be patient its worth it!

The author must be from the N. O. area.  Cajuns don't normally use tomatoes of tomato products in their gumbos though there are about as many recipes as there are cajuns.  The basic recipe is a 50% oil to flour mixture for the roux, the cajun trilogy (onions, bell pepper & celery), almost any combination of meat & seafood you can imagine, black pepper & salt and innumerable variations of herbs and spices.  It is hard to mess up a gumbo if you get the roux right, it is the key to the recipe.  Incidentally, the darker you can get the roux without burning it, the better the taste.  Be very, very careful, however as it gets darker since the slightest bit of burned flour will taint the gumbo and there is no known remedy for that.

This recipe was excellent!!  I always wanted to make shrimp étouffée and this was perfect!!  I did use butter instead of vegetable oil, clam juice instead of fish stock, and Old Bay Seasoning as the seafood seasoning.  I also made it solely with shrimp and not the crawfish tails.  I served it with rice and we were in love.  Will make again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This is an ok recipe. I am from the heart of the Cajun Country. I will tell you, we use 1 stick of margarine / 2 pounds of seafood (ie: 1# Shrimp & 1# Crawfish or 1# Crab meat & 1# shrimp or 2#'s of crawfish, etc.), 1 can of Cream of golden mushroom soup, & 1 can of cream of celery or cream of shrimp. We also add the water to a good thickness. Not heavy and not thin. Chicken stock can be used also. Additionally, 1 cup of crawfish fat, if available. After all the seasoning, we do not use heavy amounts of cayenne because you do not want to over power the great seasonings of onion, bell pepper, celery, etc. Also add 2 tbl. spoon of tomato paste. We do not use fish stock. Reason, it doesn't stay long with the fish stock in it. We also do not use chopped tomatoes.

This Etouffe is sooo good  I had  to make myself stop eating! The subtle changes I made was using crawfish tails I peeled that were leftover from a boil we had. I kept the tails and all the fat and seasoning, put into a Ziploc bag about half filled with water and froze it. When thawed I kept the seasoned water and used it for my stock. Ca c'est bon!

This is really good - made it using Bay Seasoning HOT and boy was it hot.   Delete the cayenne if you use the hot variety of Bay.   Found it was missing something initially and then noticed the recipes didn't call for salt - once I added that it was great.

Dish was a huge hit!  Used leftover crawfish from a boil. Don't be intimated by the roux. Just keep stirring and everything comes together beautifully!

As the other reviewers indicated, use butter NOT oil to make the roux. I've made this twice. I found frozen crawfish at our local Walmart! Since fish stock is very hard to find in the upper midwest (and I'm not making it from scratch), I used one cup of  "Better than Bullion" fish stock and the next time  1/2 cup of "better than Bullion" vegetable stock and 1/2 cup clam juice. Both options work very well.

Excellent recipe with a few changes.  I had to add additional flour the second time I made it.  Was good the first time, but it was a little too soupy following the recipe.  I also used seafood broth for my liquid and I added creole seasoning and old bay seafood seasoning.  Veggie I added red peppers and mushroom in addition to what was listed.

I downsize the servings until the amount of meat required was a little less than what I have. Used crawfish tails bought from Walmart freezer section. Did not use shrimp. Turned out great!

This was so yummy!!! Lots of flavor!! The only thing I did different was add 2 bay leaves and used a seafood stock instead of fish stock because was not able to find any in my local grocery store!

Opted to nix oil and use butter for roux & didn't have crawfish so I used shrimp and lobster.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same.   This dish was absolutely fun to make and not difficult at all.  I loved it,  had the perfect amount of spicy you would expect from a Cajun dish.  If you are not a fan of spicy foods this is not for you.  This will be going on my list to make again!!!

We love creole/Cajun recipes and this one is excellent. Tasting it after adding the seafood(old bay) seasoning I thought it would be too salty but when served with rice, it came out perfect. I felt the heat was spot on with the amount of cayenne in the recipe but if you are not keen to spicy foods you will likely want to reduce it. Crayfish isn't readily available where I live so I opted for 2 lbs of shrimp. I do feel the cook times are a little off and reduced them slightly. I've made roux numerous times and it does take a while to get right.  Overall it took about 30 minutes start to finish until the dish was served.  I only have to kick myself that I forgot to get a loaf of crusty bread to go along with it.

Love the flavors of this recipe. Only thing I will do next time is cut back on the old bay( that's what I used for seafood seasoning) and hot sauce. I don't like spicy at all and even without the cayenne pepper it was still to hot for me. Other than that this recipe is perfect!

I loved it.  I thought the hot sauce and spice portions were too large and cut them back significantly; yet it was still to spicy for some in our family.  Consider halving the seafood and hot sauce.

Yum!  This was so good and so easy.  The toughest part is chopping the vegetables.  Making the roux was a snap -- you just have to stir constantly to keep it from burning like the directions say.  I used 2# of medium-sized shrimp.  It was so good!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I give this recipe 4 stars because it's quick and easy to make, it tastes really good, the heat/spicyness is awesome. My family loved it. What sucked about it is it didn't look anything like the picture. I followed the recipe exactly. When the roux got to be a "peanut butter" brown it was still very runny and oily. So I took the suggestion of one of the reviews and cooked it a bit longer to a "milk chocolate " color, at which point it actually started to thicken up but was still quite runny.  But then everything is a dark brown-the vegetables and seafood. Nothing was pretty or presentable about it. I will definitely make this again but next time I think I'll use butter instead of oil and see if that doesn't make a difference. Oh! I did make brown rice instead of white rice as we don't like white rice as well. Also, I couldn't find crawfish anywhere so I doubled up on the shrimp.

Very good!  I had to adapt this to what I had access to... using chicken and shrimp instead of crawfish and shrimp and chicken stock in place of fish stock.  Very yummy!!  I'll add this one to my meal rotation!
I was taught to always use equal portions of fat and flour when making roux, so I used 1/4 of each (but did need that extra bit of oil for sauteing my peppers and onion).  I went with a dark brown roux, too.

Did add a couple more cups of clam juice and also a can of V8. I also added a small container of lump crab meat and about 1/2 lb garlic sausage. It was absolutely scrumptious. Spices were just right!! Will make again!!

Delicious. I substituted some vegetable bouillon for fish stock and used olive oil for the roux. I did not use garlic. Did not have fresh crawdads, so resorted to using  frozen cajun boiled crawfish from the grocery.

Made it again, kicked it up with the cayenne.  Delicious.

Didn't have crawfish or fresh tomatoes so I doubled the shrimp and used canned tomatoes.  Great taste.  Time consuming though.  About 60 minutes start to finish and almost all working time.

This was the first time for me to make a meal like this. It did take long, but glad to make it. I am not used to cajun food, so 2 tablespoons of seasoning was quite a bit much for my taste, but the rice helped out a lot. Next time I'll add more slowly for my liking. I did put just a little cayenne pepper in it and that was perfect. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Delicious meal. I am in New England and crawfish are not readily available. Used lobster instead and it was fabulous!! Served on 7 grains and fresh baby kale.

This recipe is awesome!  I will make it again.  The hubby loved it over white rice.  The only thing I changed was that I sautéed the onions, bell peppers, and celery in butter while the roux was cooking to get them soft because my husband does not like his vegetables to be crunchy.  This recipe is a WIN.

I didn't add the cayenne and it was still a little too spicy for my taste. I poured it over rice and added sour cream when serving and it was amazing !

This was my first experience making etoufee.  It was excellent.  I only used a dash of hot sauce and used a tablespoon of old bay. I did not add any of the cayenne pepper as my husband is ultra-sensitive to spicy food. I used a 15 oz can of diced, fire-roasted tomatoes since I did not have any fresh.  We loved it!

I just used crawfish tails, and since they were already quite spicy I didn't need to add the hot sauce or the cayenne. Also didn't have fish stock and frankly didn't feel like making any, so I used chicken stock instead. The flavor was outstanding and there are no leftovers. Next time I will go out of my way to use fish stock and see how that changes the overall taste.

Absolutely wonderful recipe to jump off of. For the roux, I used 1 stick of butter because by eyeballing it, I didn't think 1/3 cup was enough. Cooked it to peanut butter color, whisking constantly so as not to burn it, and had zero problems. And that was my first time making roux! I had to omit the bell peppers because of a picky eater, so I just increased the onions to compensate. I also used a large can of medium-heat Rotel instead of the fresh tomatoes, and was so glad I did! I made the mistake of draining some of the liquid from the can, I won't do that next time because I had to then increase the amount of seafood stock to get the consistency right. And instead of the seafood seasoning, I used 1.5 tablespoons of "Slap Ya Mama" seasoning. Once it got close to the desired consistency (a little thinner), I added my 2 pounds of crawfish tails from our last crawfish boil, let it simmer about 10-15 minutes, and it was beautiful. It got a Ragin' Cajun's nod of approval (he had thirds ), and was hot enough for an East Texas country boy who loves his spicy food. For those who can't hardly handle pickled jalapeños for the heat level, SEASON CAREFULLY. This will be crazy hot for you... But for us Southerners, it's perfect. (Tip: I use the rice you steam in the bag in the microwave. So much easier.)

Excellent recipe, but I love reading all the ad libs  from other cooks. I did the roux with half oil, half butter. Totally agree that it's not about time, but the color. Mine was a dark brown in 10 minutes. No crawfish at store, went with faux lobster. It was OK, but next time I'll skip. Used clam juice, but would like to make own fish stock next time. Added some sirracha in addition to hot sauce and seasoning. Finally, used 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.

Absolutely delicious. I was hesitant to make because of the roux, but it was well worth it. I will definitely be making this again. Only substitution was I used butter instead of the vegetable oil.

I made this last night, and it was delicious!  After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I used a mixture of bacon grease and butter instead of the oil, and reduced the amount to 1/4 c.  I used 1/2 can of petite diced tomatoes.  I used 1/2 Old Bay and 1/2 Tony Chatcheries for the seafood seasoning (and reduced the amount to taste).  I used frozen crawfish tails (thawed and rinsed).  I simmered the veggies a little longer to soften.  Next time I'd like to try adding some andouille or Conecuh sausage, and maybe will add some corn kernels.

I had a very hard time rating this recipe.  I followed the roux recipe and it failed miserably both times I tried.  Entirely too liquidy.  (I had to search for a better roux recipe.)  Once I found one that actually worked, everything fell into place.  Equal parts butter and flour.  Per my husband's taste, I did not add the cayenne and only used 2/3 of the hot sauce suggested.  It ended up being absolutely delicious.  I, of course, added a little more hot sauce to mine when it was on my plate.  I will definitely make this again but will not use the roux this recipe suggests.

Excellent recipe.  My first time attempting to make etouffee.  My only change was no cayenne pepper and half the hot sauce as I was feeding young kids.  The prep is no effort if you have a food processor/chopper.  My roux took only about 10 minutes to get the right brown and everything else a breeze.  Lastly, I used all shrimp as I have not been able to find frozen crawfish.  I served over mashed potatoes -the gravy this makes is excellent. 
 I will be doubling the recipe and serving at our upcoming holiday party.

This was really good. I took the advice of several commenters and cut the oil to just under 1/4 cup. Added veggies when the roux was roughly "milk chocolate" color, added raw shrimp only (decent-sized shrimp and cooked for only five-ish minutes), mixed in chopped green onion, and served over cooked long-grain brown rice.

It tasted amazing! It ended up needing a bit more salt.  I served with a green salad.

I added a jalapeño pepper to the pepper, onion, and celery mixture and also used salmon seafood seasoning (the one that is in the little bag and has a lot of herbs and spices). I also cut down on the time by simmering the mixture only 10mins then I adding the pre-cooked crawfish tails and cooked an additional 10mins. I would highly recommend this recipe for any true American!

I ADORE etouffe, and this was a really good one. I used all shrimp due to availability - I live in the philistine part of the country that thinks crawfish are bait - and while it was good, I was really missing the crawfish. I can't wait to make this again when I can get my hands on some fresh crawdads!

While I could initially taste the richness of this recipe it quickly was replaced by the extreme heat.  I DID NOT use the cayenne pepper so as to keep the heat to a minimum but that did not matter.  My son who really enjoys spicy/hot items could not finish the bowl he made for himself. So next time I will do a very small fraction on the other spices in the recipe. A shame I had to throw away the beautiful gulf shrimp I used.

Sensational!  I used Rotel Mild Tomatoes, eliminated hot sauce and made my own "seafood seasoning" based on an 'at home Old Bay" recipe I found.  The canned tomatoes made it a little acidic, so I added one more tiny dash each of the nutmeg/ginger/allspice and it moved this sauce into another place.  I also added 1 Tbspn of butter at the end and let it melt into the sauce.  Thank you Rhonda35!

Used 1 can of diced tomatoes, cooked chicken since I didn't have crawfish, and omitted the hot sauce and pepper (didn't want to scorch my guests) and this was a HUGE success!!  My kitchen smelled like Acme Oyster Bar, it was great!

cajun cooking is not complicated, but  everyone else seems to try to make it so.  this is just simple and yummy!!  fyi, you can just use water if you don't have fish stock on hand, and use your fav cajun seasoning blend if you don't have seafood seasoning.  this is one of the most authentic "cajun" recipes i've ever seen!

Not so hard once you give it a try! Who knew heating oil and butter had such astounding effects?  I've been intimidated to try a Roux, but using common sense and a whisk it was no problem! (I'm going to try this in place of butter in a butter sauce I make). I used to catch crawfish as a lil girl and watch them swim... this had me google-ing fishing laws and traps! Since I had no crawfish I used shrimps and scallops and it was awesome!

Excellent Dish!  I served it with steak, and (for once) the steak took a backseat to this delicious recipe.

This dish is great, used mixture of butter and oil, watch the cayenne, and didn't use crawfish,just shrimp.  Family loved it.

This was my first attempt at Etouffe or a roux and it turned out delish!  I had frozen langistinos I used instead of crawfish and shrimp. Just make sure to drain and squeeze the langistinos to get all the water out.

Very good dish for our meatless Friday.  Used butter instead of veg. oil.  Was a little thin so thickened with some corn starch.  Omitted tomatoes because I read on Wikipedia that authentic etoufee never has tomatoes.    Bought a one quart carton of seafood stock, so used some of it in my rice cooker to season the rice.  Doubled the stock in the main dish since I didn't have the tomatoes and their juice.  (OK, that might explain it being a little thin.)  With or without my tweaks, this deserves five stars in my opinion.

I made this according to the recipe.  The only change I made was using clam juice rather than the fish stock since I could not find that.  I was hesitant due to clam juice but this was delicious.  I also did not add any seasoning other than the seafood seasoning.  It was hot enough with just that.  Everyone loved it and I will be making again.

I made this with my girlfriend last night, and we both loved it. The shrimp tasted great in the Roux. I used clam juice instead of fish stock, and i think it brought out the spice a bit more. It was definatly something i'll be happy to make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and found it to be pretty good, but still missing something.  After adding a little butter and a lot of lemon, it all came together.  I will make it again, but I will make my roux differently next time.  This method took way too much time!

Awesome recipe.  We used half crawfish and half shrimp and it was so good.  Reminds me of some great restaurants in the south.

Delicious!  The only think I changed was that I used all shrimp instead of half crawfish.  I've never attempted a cajun recipe before, but I recently visited New Orleans for work and loved the food!!  My husband wasn't able to come with me, so I wanted him to be able to enjoy the taste as well, and when I found this recipe I knew I had to try it.  It exceeded my expectations.  Thank you!!

It tasted okay, but it was SO not worth the 2 hour effort (that was with my son peeling shrimp and cooking rice for me, and my daughter stirring the roux).  My 5 children all hated it, to the point that my daughter was wiping the sauce off of the shrimp that she had to eat and still gagging after that.  I would not make this recipe again.
