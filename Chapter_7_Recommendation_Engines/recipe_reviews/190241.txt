Excellent recipe! Some tips to make it better: Do not incorporate the egg into the batter. Instead, crack and beat an egg all at once. Once you have the pancake spread out in the oil, gently pour the egg on top. Also, two teaspoons of cornstarch really crispens up the pancake. Be sure not to lay on the batter too thick -- make it super thin to start with, as it will puff up a bit, even without the addition of baking powder. DELICIOUS!

Easiest Korean dish to make! I love all Korean jeon(pancakes)and I often make this with the easiest recipe I am so used to: flour mix with chopped kimchi, more fermented the better, add water to make the mixture gooey and just pour it in sizzling oil. When it is fried crispy enough turn it over to the other side. I suggest no eggs to make the kimchi jeon more crispy and savory, eggs make it just too soft and moist. With this recipe kimchi cannot go wrong!:)

This was okay. Missing pork flavor though. Next time I think I'm going to add thinly sliced strips of pork or ground pork to add that flavor.

Lol Kimchi Pancakes are one of the reasons I married my husband (he's Korean)! Haven't tried it this way.. We usually just get mix at the asian store.. Will have to try it this way next time I make Kimchi!

One of my fav's to use up the extras in the refrigerator, including the end of the Kimchee jar.  To make the outsides extra crispy and boost the protein level of this add part besan (chickpea flour - found in indian food markets) to the wheat flour specified.  I like them with a 50/50 mix. Add a bit of sesame oil to the cooking oil to give a nice flavor. 

I also make these without the kimchee, using other scrap veggies and indian spices in batter such as cumin, turmeric, coriander, and/or garam masala.  Sour cream or plain yogurt dip also good with indian version.

Also can add thai curry pastes and fish sauce to spice it up.

LOVE THIS! Very simple and delicious. I used some overly fermented kimchi that I couldn't bear to toss and since there wasn't much juice I added water instead. I used whole wheat flour and  added 2 tsp cornstarch like another reviewer recommended. Cooked them on my nonstick griddle without the oil at somewhere between 350F and 375F. Served with sides of miso soup and steamed kale. This is definitely replacing my old bland scallion pancake recipe.

These are a great way to enjoy Kimchi for all of us Kimchi lovers out there.  The second time I made it I used whole wheat flour and added the salt into the batter, as well as some baking powder to make them rise a little bit like regular pancakes.  Great along side stir fry.

DELISH! Good for when you're not full yet but you're not that hungry. I added some milk and water to the batter because it seemed dry. I also sprinkled in some salt and sugar.

It was alright.  Nowhere near as good as the authentic kimchi pancakes my mom makes but got rid of all my overly-fermented kimchi.  It's a decent recipe.

Good recipe, I add 1 tsp sugar to the batter.  It helps round out the flavor.  This is a great way to use up over ripe kimchi.  Yum!

You can also make a yummy version of these with green onion kimchi. I used only the chopped kimchi, egg and flour and then fry. Good after the bar food.

Delicious! We were looking for a way to use our giant bucket of kimchi and these did the trick. These were slightly spicy but not as hot as the kimchi itself. I added a little baking powder as another review suggested and this made the pancakes rise well. We dipped them in the sauce but thought they tasted fine without it as well.  Served it with steamed veggies drizzled with some of the sauce.  We will definitely make these again soon!

My Mother in law is Korean and this is how she cooks her pancakes! So yummy! She also throws in a can of tuna sometimes, very good and the only way my 5 yr old son will eat fish.

My pancakes didn't really turn out like those pictured, so I'm not sure if I made a mistake or if the recipe just isn't all that great. Thank goodness kimchi is so flavorful, otherwise I'm not sure there'd be too much to these pancakes. I added a few teaspoons of white rice flour since it helps things crisp up nicely, but it didn't seem to add much crispiness. We really liked the dipping sauce, but maybe we'll give another kimchi pancake recipe a try next time.

I loved these.  Such a nice, savory and slightly spicy dinner pancake.  I made the dipping sauce but once tasting the pancake decided it would be good with something to balance it.  This is not very authentic, but I mixed some hot chili paste with sour cream and just loved it served with that.  What a great recipe and way to use Kim chee.

Yum! These are so good. I think I will end up using the whole jar of kimchi to make these yummy pancakes. I didn't change much about the recipe. I didn't use green onion because I didn't have any, and in the sauce I used garlic chili sauce instead of chili pepper flakes. It was still really good.

I had a bit more kimchi, so I extended the recipe with some extra flour and water and it worked out great.  You may want to increase the amount of dipping sauce if you really like it!
