Angela, I'm so glad you posted this recipe. It was given to me by a very dear friend. Over the years it was missplaced, so I'm happy to find it once again. This recipe is more of a summer sausage than a salami. Your proportions of seasonings to curing salt is perfect. The flavor and texture are wonderul. Most people can't believe you made it yourself. Its quality is as good as any butcher and sausage maker's. Goes soooo good with beer on a hot summer day. Thanks again.

DO NOT substitute table salt for Curing salt.  I did and boy, was it a mistake.

Here is my variation of your wonderful recipe after a couple of trials:

1.25 lbs 97% lean ground beef
1.25 lbs lean game meat (I used elk)
2T Curing salt
1/2t garlic powder
1.2t onion powder
1/2t mustard seed
1/2T black pepper
dash red pepper flakes
1T liquid smoke

my red pepper flakes dominated the meat flavor when I used 1t.  I may use more than 1T liquid smoke next time, just based on personal tastes.  This doesn't last long around the house, it is sooooo good.

I also unwrap the meat after about 10 mins of cooling and let it sit in the turned-off oven to create a drier meat.

Exellent...I used venison/pork mixture. I also increased spices by 1/4 and added a tablespoon of onoin flakes, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/8 tsp of habanero powder. Was really great. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Is really great on a warm evening with a cold beer. I will be making this for a long time to come.

Same ingredients, different cooking technique: Wrap each half of the two pounds of meat mixture in the foil - not particularly water proof, either, just snug enough to give it a shape - and then let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. After at least 24 hours, place it in a deep pan (I used a stock pot), cover both logs with cold water, bring it to a boil. Boil for one hour (I reduced to a simmer to keep the steam down). Drain and unwrap the foil, pat the sausage with paper towels, chill before slicing. Really good, and I only turned the logs once in the water, they kind of floated but then again I used 1/2 bison and 1/2 beef.

I used Venison in this recipe instead of ground beef and shared it with the guys I work with. They were all up around the 4.5 to 5.0 with their votes. I will use this recipe again. Great job!

This is an awesome recipe!  And so simple!  I did increase the onion and garlic powder to 1/2 tsp each.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I haven't tried this recipe, so my rating in on my Grandpa's version.  A recipe like this has been in my family my whole life.  My grandfather was Italian, and this is his family recipe.  It is very similar except my recipe calls for 5#s of meat, whole pepper pods, no red pepper.  But the biggest difference is that once you mix the meat, you place it in the fridge and you mix it once a day for three days.  On the fourth day, you make 5-6 rolls and place it on a broiler pan.  Then you bake on 140-150 degrees for 8-10 hours.  It is perfect.

THANK YOU for sharing this!  I have my aunt's very old recipe for Summer Sausage; same ingredients (except proportioned for five pounds of hamburger) - but it called for saltpeter (an ingredient in gunpowder), which isn't available in the grocery aisle these days. (I'm told you can buy it in the insecticide section of home-improvement stores, though, as potassium nitrate - ugh!) It's nice to know about the curing salt. I've missed this stuff. Aunt Mick used to make large quantities of it every year; her recipes states "Will keep in refrigerator for 2-3 months." Oh, and her instructions also call for mixing all ingredients, refrigerating 24 hours, mixing again and refrigerating 24 hours more; and baking in a "very slow" oven (200 degrees) for 2 hours, then lowering the temp to 150 and baking 6 hours longer. Worked great for her, but I'm not sure you can get an oven that slow nowadays.

I followed the recipe subbing curing salt and sugar for the sugar-based curing mix.   I will make this again and I will increase everything but the meat. (I have gone online and ordered a sugar-based cure) I will also put the mixture in my mixer, add cold water (to bind it together better) and fennel seed and use whole peppercorns.  I want a finer grained mixture.  I can hardly wait for my cure to get here to make another batch.

This was excellent - dry and spicy.  The family liked it very much.  Excellent with cheese and crackers.  I would definitely slice it uniformly with my electric slicer before serving to guests, as the log shape was not very appealing.

I think mine didn't turn because of the meat I used.  It was very lean ground beef.  Turned out more like spicy meatloaf.  Not at all like salami. Didn't really have that good of flavor.  If I tried it again might add a little sausage and some other spices.

OMG!  This was so great.  I only used 1/2 tsp red pepper b/c I didn't want it to spicy.  Will make over again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe. I added a little extra black pepper and red pepper flakes to the mix.  After making the rolls , I used course black pepper, spread it out on wax paper and rolled the logs in it before wrapping them in foil. In essence, making peppered salami.  It turned out fantastic.

if you can't find tenderquick i found a substitute  using prague powder#1 which is easier to find (at asian markets)
it took me about an hour of web searching !! added some whole cumin and toasted my spices before adding them (adding the red pepper flakes last so they wouldnt scorch) and i also added a bit of red wine

This was excellent and so easy. Definitely more of a summer sausage than salami. I've made it and shared it with 3 other couples, once at a big party, and have had people truly "wowed" that it was homemade. They don't believe me when I tell them how easy it is! Thanks for sharing!

This was just 'ok'.  It helps if you go into this NOT thinking salami, because it really isn't close to salami.

I may have used too much curing salt. When I ate this I couldn't determine if it was too salty or just spicy. My husband like it.

The flavor was off. My husband didn't like it as it left a bad aftertaste. I ended up throwing out most of it. I followed the directions to the T.

We enjoyed this very much.  Some of my children were surprised that Salami could be made at home.  I liked it because I knew exactly what was in it. This taste very good. Great snack with crackers and cheese too!

I've made this once, very tasty.  

I made the mixture up again on Friday, but I doubled the garlic and onion powders, and added one more TBS of Morton's curing salt, and have let it age for a second day.

If you like salami, you owe it to yourself to make this one - it's very simple and tastes great.

Made this over the past two days, reduced every ingredient by half except for the garlic powder and onion powder which i kept the same.  As you can see it came out perfectly.  I couldn't have asked for a simpler quicker way of doing this.

I missed something on this recipe.  It was time consuming and didn't taste like sausage at all.  We make all of our sausage from scratch and don't know what I could have done to change this one to make it better.

This was just okay. The log turns brown after baking, so if your not used to eating brown salami, this recipe is not for you. Looks more like sausage than salami. However, the combined spices made for a decent flavor. But I also tripled the garlic.

I made this for years and always got rave reviews. Then I lost the recipe! Horrors! You can imagine my happiness at finding the exact recipe here! Thank you so much! My reputation is secured!

I didn't use liquid smoke, (that stuff is nasty). Instead, I cook them in my smoker.  An open cut log in the counter is a gone log. It is the preferred meat on my charcuterie plates.

Surprisingly good! Perhaps not like citterio salami but certainly much leaner, adding a bit of hot pepper flakes and using 90 % lean angus beef.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It taste fabulous.   My only question is what color is the outside of the salami stick supposed to be?  Our's is still pink.

My first salami ever and it turned out great! I made it again and used half pork half beef mix. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise.
