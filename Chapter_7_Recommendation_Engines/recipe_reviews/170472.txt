This recipe is essentially a glorified fruit cake. I didn't have any dates on hand, and, being a crazy chocolate lover, I added lots of chocolate chips. Oh - and does anybody really chop raisins? I think that would take way too much time. I didn't chop mine. In any case, with the chocolate chips I would give it 4 stars - without, I give it 3. It's tasty, and I like to try to eat healthy. I totally appreciate a healthy dessert; this was a great snack and a fun way to get the kids to eat a little bit of fruits/veggies... but I'm not a huge fan of fruit cake and I think the chocolate chips might be mostly to blame for the kids fighting for the last piece. All in all, I'm glad I tried this recipe and I'm sure I will be trying it again. Thanks, sneaky mommy! :)

This turned into a sliceable FUDGE PUDDING CAKE (!) by a happy accident of using only 1-1/2 C. flour (instead of 2-1/2). Also two substitutions: (a) buttermilk instead of the unavailable apple juice concentrate, and (b) 1 C. date filling (a paste-like product of local date growers, quite inexpensive and gives the batter a nice dark color) instead of the raisins and chopped dates. It stayed very moist during baking but the top was firm after 40 min. (with turbo). Sliced into small squares while still warm and rushed to a community potluck; it disappeared quickly, proably a hit with preschoolers. A few we stashed at home were fine the next day. Next time I'd add cinnamon, which I favor in any chocolate cake.

Made muffins instead but LOVE this recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients so tweeked - but that's the fun of cooking! Used sucanat instead of sugar, skipped most of the milk (maybe used 2 TBL), skipped the raisins & dates 'cause my family would pick them out anyway. I didn't have the apple juice concentrate so used - get this -prune juice instead! As another viewer suggested, I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. They were fabulous!!

Yummy and healthy.  Four stars because it definitely needed chocolate chips. As is, the level of chocolate isn't strong enough for my liking. As for alterations, I left out the juice concentrate, the raisins, and the dates. I added a 1/4 tsp salt. Otherwise I made it per the recipe. Made 24 muffins, which I will be enjoying as a healthy and yummy--if not the most delicious thing on the planet--snack.

This had too much fruit, and not enough chocolate flavor.  If I made it again I would add chocolate chips and omit some of the fruit.  Unfortunately, I don't see myself trying to make another version of this.
