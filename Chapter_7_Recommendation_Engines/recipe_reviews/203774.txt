This recipe is phenomenal!  Very tasty, easy to make and very versatile.  I added the spices to the simmering pepper and cream mixture so the flavors would infuse with the sauce.   I let it simmer, stirring occasionally for 40 minutes and it only reduced by a 1/4 of the liquid...but was wonderful anyway!  I may never eat tomato sauce again!

This was very tasty. I was looking for a spicy sauce and so I added a lot more cayenne to suit our tastes. All seasonings (except lemon) were added to the cream mixture to infuse in the sauce.   I also steamed some chopped, tri-colored peppers and tossed the sauce in with the peppers and some cooked chicken.  Poured the sauce, pepper and chicken mixture over some radiatore pasta noodles.  Topped with crushed red pepper and graded Parmesan cheese.  Delish!

This sauce is fabulous! And so easy.  It did take longer than 30 minutes for mine to reduce but maybe I wasn't cooking it at a high enough temp for fear of scalding the cream.  We had a bunch leftover so I greased my muffin pan and poured in  the remaining sauce, then froze.  I wrapped each one in saran wrap and stored in the freeze.  Now we can pull out individual servings when ever we want.  We also served it over crab cakes. Delicious!

Wow, amazing. I had low expectations for this, I tried several times at making a different red pepper cream sauce from this site and was not a fan.  I'm so glad that I tried this one! I forgot red bell peppers when I went to the grocery store but had a jar of roasted red peppers so I used that instead (it had 2 peppers in it). I also wanted to make this a bit lower in calories so I used half skim milk the rest half and half in place of the cream. Used hot paprika too. This one is going in the fav's folder, thanks so much for the recipe:)
Edit 10/20/11, I recently made this recipe again using fresh red bell peppers, I must say that I really enjoyed this sauce more the last time that I made it using the roasted red peppers, they really enhance the flavor. This sauce is amazing either way though.

Did not have enough red peppers so used an orange instead of one of red, hoping that was the reason for the bland taste - had to add lots of Tabasco and red pepper flakes to dress it up. Not sure if I will, but if I make it again, will definitely have to spice it up!

A bit bland, but a good substitute for tomato-based pasta sauces. Made over gnocci, added chopped fresh basil on top, which made a BIG difference flavor-wise.

Lacking flavor. Would be good as a base, pretty, but needs some more things added.

Very easy to make, and very good.  Followed the recommendations of others and didn't add the lemon until the very end.  My family thought that it needed a bit more salt, but the sauce was a hit.    I don't know if I didn't blend it properly or if I didn't heat it up long enough to evaporate the cream but it wasn't as thick as I would have like it.  Next time I will cook a little longer and blend the peppers a little longer.

This sauce is amazing! I will greatly reduce the amount of times that I am going to use tomato sauce from here on out. I did not change anything. Whatever you do do not try to add other color peppers, it doesn't work. I appreciate people who make changes to suit their taste but if you're going to rate a recipe I believe you should make the recipe exactly as it is listed and then rate it and then make your changes, and let everyone know how your changes worked out.

I have made this several times.  It takes just like a recipe from a closed restaurant that I loved.  After making the sauce I add chicken, sundried tomatoes  and artichoke hearts. Family loves it.

Absolutely fantastic. No more store bought sauce for me. I used it with perogies and it couldn't have been better. Best red pepper sauce ever.

I changed this up a bit by roasting the red pepper and then added it to diced red onions that I had sautéed for about 2 minutes. I always use my immersion blender instead of a regular blender for soup since it is usually in a pot big enough to blend.

Added spices (a little extra cayenne and a clove of minced garlic) to the cream and pepper while it was on the stove. Served over spinach tagliatelle and topped with a little grated Parmesan. Excellent alone, but also probably as a base to add other vegetables, etc.

Was out of paprika, so subbed chipotle. Also bumped cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon. Added spices before it finished reducing and blended with immersion blender. Had that touch of heat at the back of the throat. Served over homemade pasta and shrimp. It was amazing!!

Made it as specified, but used black pepper since I had no white.  It was a little too runny for my liking.  I loved the red pepper taste, but it needed a little something somethin'.  Next time I will add more Cumin and pepper and maybe start it with a roux  so it will thicken some.

The red pepper flavor is just not there as much as I would like. I used the roasted red peppers, double what the recipe called for and it just doesn't seem to get that delicious red pepper flavor that I'm looking for.

I made this sauce and drizzled over some grilled scallops. It was so good! But it does make quite a bit of sauce, so the batch size is more appropriate for pastas.

I was in a hurry and distracted by the kids when I made this so didn't follow the directions exactly.  I threw all the ingredients in the pan and boiled/simmered.  Substitutions & additions:  multi colored peppers, milk & butter instead of cream, oven roasted garlic and asparagus, steamed broccoli and peas.  Served over cheese tortellini.  Tasty, fast and easy.

My family loved it!  I added all the ingredients at one time but omitted the lemon juice.  ( I forgot). I also had light cream instead of heavy. It took about 30 mins to reduce and was still thick.  I had cheese tortellini and grill PERDUE short cuts.  Tossed it all together and served with garlic bread.   Definitely will make again. This will stay in rotation .

This sauce is quite yummy but too mild tasting using all fresh red bell peppers, so I like to use one large fresh and two roasted (from a jar). Since I don't buy white pepper I just use a few grinds of black. I sub red pepper flakes for the cayenne and only put in 1/2 tsp. of salt. In addition, I add a couple cloves of minced fresh garlic. I add all spices right at the beginning, in with the cream and bell peppers. When it's done simmering I use an immersion blender and then stir in the lemon juice. Very easy recipe!

I have made this several times.  It is now the only requested sauce for ravioli in my house.  I use 6 peppers and 1 quart of half & half, add fresh minced garlic and extra cayenne.  Use the immersion blender and it has the perfect consistency - the extra peppers help a lot.  Top off with fresh basil, sauteed mushrooms and parmesan.  This is really a great starter recipe - add whatever suits your taste.

This was REALLY simple to make and very tasty.  I made my own Italian "sausage" out of ground turkey and spices to give the meal a little more "heft."  It was very filling and very good; thanks!

Really liked the taste of this sauce!! Thank you for sharing!! I will definitely make this again and again! Only thing I changed was that I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used regular pepper and only a very tiny bit..and I also added the lemon juice right before putting in the blender. Try it, you won't be sorry you did! :) :)

This turned out pretty tasty. I used half and half instead of cream to make it healthier, and it still worked out great. I also put the seasonings in during the simmer time like another review said, and it worked out well. Served it over penne and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.
