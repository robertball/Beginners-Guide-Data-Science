This is very good!  I didn't have poppyseed dressing, though, so I used Raspberry Walnut from Paul Newman.  My husband missed out, because he really likes the combination of meat and fruit.

We just bought a half bushel of fresh peaches, and scanned the recipe index for ideas.  The weather here is very warm, and this recipe really hit the spot.  For convenence, I used packaged, pre-cooked chicken from the deli case.  A great summer picnic or potluck dish.

Really liked the flavor and simplicity of this dish. Came together very quickly using packaged chicken and greens. Great light summer lunch. Plan to serve this at a teacher's luncheon.

Very good salad. I made my own poppy seed dressing according to the recipe Poppy seed salad dressing on this website and it tasted very good.

I've tried this recipe before and it's a good one.  However, it's from the Epicurious.com website and was published in Bon Appetit in 1994.  Boo on the poster who didn't give credit where credit is due!

Very tasty salad.  I used a rotisserie chicken and it ended up being too overpowering, so stick with regular cooked chicken.  The poppy seed dressing with the peaches tasted great.

Excellent salad. My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. The lemon poppyseed dressing tasted wonderful with the tangy taste of peaches. Peaches can also be replaced  with nectarines.

Excellent. Used with poppy seed dressing and rotisserie chicken with the skin removed. Everyone loved it -- so easy to put together -- this one is going in my salad repetoire!

Really enjoyable summer salad.  So simple to make, I did omit the chicken just because this was to be a side to go with grilled BBQ ribs.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing

I used leftover rotisserie chicken and canned peaches. Made a nice, light dinner.

It's so easy to make poppy seed dressing.  Use the poppy seed maple syrup found in this website.  Use low-fat mayo.
