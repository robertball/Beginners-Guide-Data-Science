Great flavor! I didn't have tomato soup so I substituted tomato sauce. I added cilantro. Topped with cheddar at the end and let it melt in the oven for a few minutes.

Delicious!  This pepper has a great flavor with the added feta cheese.  I made two different types of peppers for dinner.  This recipe and 'Yummy Stuffed Peppers' from AR.  My DH really liked this one.  I cut the recipe back to one pepper and cut it in half rather than stuffing it.  Since we do not eat olives, I served it with extra feta cheese.  Also served 'Feta Mashed Potatoes' from AR and sliced cucumbers.  A good, different recipe for peppers with a twist.  I would make it again.
