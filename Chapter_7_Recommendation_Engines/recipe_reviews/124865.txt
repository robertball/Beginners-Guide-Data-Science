Easy and tasty.
My husband is very picky about his apple butter and this was a hit.

Warning: I made it according to the recipe and it was TOO sweet so I doubled the apples and it was perfect.
Either double your apples or 1/2 the sugar called for.

I made this on the advice of a very good cook and I'm so glad I did!  What a fantastic, easy method.  I had 4 apples (1 3/4 lb.) so I scaled the recipe down to 20 servings.  I started this in my crock pot at 12:30 one day and 10 hours later it didn't look cooked down enough so I just let it go overnight.  In the morning it was beautifully cooked down and nicely browned.  Although the apples were very soft they still retained their shape so I used my hand mixer to get them to a nice spreading consistency.  My youngest son woke up and told me our house smelled like Christmas :)  The kids are loving this on toasted bread but I plan to use it in the many recipes available on this site that include apple butter as an ingredient.  Thanks so much for this submission.

I am so glad I tried this recipe.  I followed another reviewers advice and just used 4 apples and cut the serving size down to 20.  This made enough to fill a container for just my husband and I.  I do think that this would make a good Christmas gift like other reviewers stated.  I didn't use cloves because I didn't have any on hand and I'm not really a clove person. I added a little more cinnamon though and vanilla. Next time I make this I am going to add more apples and less sugar.  I'd also like to try it with half brown sugar.  However, this is probably just personal preference.  I don't have a huge sweet tooth.  This was delicious though.  I started it about 8pm and let it cook overnight.  This morning I woke up and used my hand blender to blend it a bit and had it on a piece of toast on the way to work.  Wonderful!

I had almost exactly 1 and 3/4 lb apples so I made the recipe for 20 servings. I used 1 cup splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar, rather than the suggsted 1 and 1/4 cup sugar and this is the best thing I've ever eaten in my life! I've had toast and apple butter for evry meal since it finished. And hot, over vanilla ice cream is sooooo GOOD! If there were more than five stars, this recipe would get them all!

I made this last year and gave it as Christmas gifts. I had so many compliments and requests for more. I did add extra spices - i like my apple butter spicier. I also made it with 2 cups brown sugar and 2 cups white sugar. After cooking I put it in a blender to make it smoother before canning.

The BEST apple butter I have ever had!  My sister-in-law gave me a big bag of small tart green apples from her tree so this recipe came to mind thanks to a past recommendation from "TristansMom".  The flavor is strong, sweet, slightly spicey and tart at the same time, and just the smell of it cooking all day is heavenly.  Will definately make this again, thank you!   P.S. Took Tristansmom's advice to put it hot on vanilla ice cream, add some caramel sauce and WOW!!!

Really great recipe!  I am a Virginia girl, and we love apple butter.  This recipe reminds me of home!  I used Gala apples and followed recipe exactly.  Beautiful brown color and the smell is wonderful. My emersion blender made it nice and smooth.  Thanks again.

I did not like this recipe.  I thought it has to much ground clove.  Also it never stated what kind of apples to use so I used Fuji and it just did not taste right!

Mmmmmmm yummy!  I had just gone apple-picking and had tons of apples to use up; this recipe was a great way to do that!  Just set it in the Crockpot before going to bed and finished it in the morning - so easy!  Cooked down nicely, although mine needed an extra hour or 2 in the cooker to get rid of some excess liquid in the mixture.  Took a whisk to it when it was all done because some of the apples looked a little chunky and it came out wonderfully!  Planning to use these for stocking stuffers at Christmas :)

Very easy recipe.  Only gave 4 stars because it should specify which types of apples are best to use... My husband brought home Red Delicious because those come conveniently in the 3# bags, and I used them.  However, I'm sure this would have tasted better with an apple variety more suitable for cooking like Gala or Honeycrisp.  My butter came out quite brown, and tasted fine on a bagel, but I would not can it to give to friends.  It did blend nicely for use in the "Apple Butter Pumpkin Pie" from this site and an apple butter rugelach cookie from a magazine.  I plan on using the rest in an "Apple Butter Pork Loin" in a few days.

My first attempt with this recipe was a disaster, I used Granny Smith apples, Not right for this recipe. My second attempt was delicious made with Gala apples.  I canned 6 sm. jars for later and to share with friends.  On cinnamon swirl bread it is the best!! I used a little less sugar..  Just wonderful!!

After reading the reviews, I decided to reduce the sugar by one cup .  So I did 2C. of white sugar and 1C. of brown sugar and it was still too sweet.  Sickening sweet.  Next time I will only use 2 cups of sugar.    I used  a 6 LBS  mixture of Empire, Macintosh and  Spartan apples.This gave me 2 Quarts(8 Cups) of Apple Butter.   Mine was done in 7 hours. To test for doneness (after 6-7 hours) spoon a mound of apple butter on a small plate. The apple butter should stay mounded without any accumulations of liquid around the edges of the mound.  THX

As suggested by other reviewers, I scaled this recipe to 20 servings (5 small apples) and I reduced the amount of sugar, but it was still way too sweet. I will definitely make it again, but I will have to be careful with the sugar.

*No need to peel.  Quarter the cored apples ( I use an apple corer, cook in crockpot according to recipe, then buzz the apples with a hand blender.  You have very smooth apple butter with no work! Great recipe!

I love this recipe!  I have made a few changes to it, though.  First, I peel and then cut the apples using a simple apple slicer.  I cut the apples into large chunks and place in my crock pot.  In the morning, I open the pot and just use a potato masher to remove any large chunks that are left.  If you like your apple butter super smooth, just use an immersion blender.  This recipe is super sweet.  I do not use white sugar, but I use 1 cup of honey.  This adds to the beautiful, dark color of the apple butter.  I also add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the recipe because I like to can the apple butter in pint size mason jars.  (Leave 1/4 inch head space and process for 10 minutes) I personally like a bit more cinnamon and less cloves.

Fabulous!  I would agree with most of the other reviews that it turned out very sweet, and I even cut back the sugar by a cup (I actually used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar)! Of course my husband loved it-sweet tooth. ;) I didn't chop the apples as finely as I should have to begin with so I (like other members) used a blender once it was all done.  I did the initial hour on high, then on low overnight, then lid off on serve setting for about an hour to reduce some of the liquid and it's the perfect consistency and very yummy!  I would give 5 stars except for the non mention of type of apples used.  I had an abundance of various apples, so I ended up using golden delicious, gala, fuji, and a few others.  I'm guessing by the sweetness of the recipe, the original poster used granny smith.  But that's just a guess. :)  thanks for the recipe!  It was lovely and I'll make it again (just maybe with less sugar!)

I cut the sugar in half and it was perfect for me and my family.  Super easy recipe.  Great on plain toast, PB toast, on ice cream, bagels, and much more!  4 out of 5 for the original recipe.  5 out of 5 for my modified version ;)

I have never tasted let alone made apple butter.  However, I was given 50 (yes, 50) pounds of apples...I made a lot of applesauce & decided to try my hand at apple butter.  SOOOO YUMMY!!  Followed recipe exactly and used immersion blender to smooth out at end.  EDIT:  FREEZES WELL.  I made so much that we have been taking it out of freezer.  Excellent substitute for oil in quick bread recipes.

This is something that is going to vary depending on a person's preference.  I am giving 5 stars because it works!  I used 3lb apples, 2 cups sugar, same amount of spice listed in original recipe.  After it cooked down a bit I used my hand held blender and blended it all together.  It took only about 9 hours in my slow cooker.  Awesome way to make Apple Butter!

I gave this recipe 4 stars just because I didn't follow it to a T. I used 5.5 lbs of apples I picked that day and I knew they were VERY sweet so I only put 2c of sugar and it came out pretty sweet so I recommend to anyone to NOT PUT 4C OF SUGAR INTO THIS RECIPE! It'll come disgustingly sweet. I didn't have grnd cloves so I used 1/8tsp of nutmeg and 1/8tsp of all spice and it come out great. 
I canned four 8oz jars and had some left over to put in a tupperware container to eat NOW because it's tastey.
This is the first time I canned anything or made apple butter and both came out great and it's going to make wonderful gifts!

Use Cortland apples, or Paula Reds.  This recipe is great- I reduced the sugar per personal preference, I used maybe 2 cups sugar and 6 lbs of apples.  We put this in Pancake Batter and on toast, pancakes, so delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best & easiest recipe I have tried.  I like other people cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, added a pinch of nutmeg and vanilla.  It is delicious!  I let it cook during the day since I'm home and could watch it.  My crockpot tends to cook fast and I didn't want it to burn overnight.  You will not be disappointed by trying this recipe.  You can't get any easier than this.  I also obmitted the cloves because of my preference.  My freezer will be stocked through winter now:)  My kids even loved it.  We had it with dinner on hot biscuits.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

This came out great! I did change alittle, I left out the cloves and added about 1 tsp. of nutmeg. Also I used one and a half cups of brown sugar and one and a half of white sugar. It came out a beautiful dark brown with tons of flavor!

I do not often give 5 stars, but this recipe was great.  I cut the amounts in 1/2 and baked it in the oven (covered) at 250 instead of in a crockpot.  I also cut the sugar by 1/4, and it was still pretty sweet (which I like).  It looked and tasted just like the apple butter I grew up eating in the midwest - delicious - and when I took it to a friend's house for dinner her family loved it as much as mine does.

Do NOT change a thing to this recipe. Please note that 3.5 cups of sliced apples equals a pound.  So you need a LOT more apples than you realize!!  I do add nutmeg and a little ginger.  But definitely do not change the amount of apples or sugar.  I have used this recipe since it was published in Taste of Home Oct/Nov 1996.  Tried and true!!

This was great made for my husband. He is a diabetic so I subsituted the sugar for splenda. The guys at his worked ate it all up, ended up having to make a second batch for him.

Excellent with some easy changes.  Put apples thru food processor before cooking.  After apples are done -if too soupy drain thru collander.  Then to get better consistancy put by batches into blender.  A little more work but verrrr y worth it. Also, yes do add some allspice- makes a difference

I was worried when I made this on Friday that it was applesauce, but when I took it out Sunday morning, it was thick and perfect. I did toss the apples with a tbsp. of lemon juice and cut the sugar back to 2 cups and I used 1/4 tsp. allspice and 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon. I also left it a bit chunky, as we prefer it that way. It's a bit sweet for me, so when I make it again(and I will!), I'll cut back the sugar even more. This one's a keeper. I'm very pleased.

So good and so easy. I used half the sugar. I blended it with my hand-held blender when it was done cooking. Will definately make again.

Such an easy recipe. I put my apples in the crockpot at 9:00 at night and cooked them on high 1 hour.  I turned the setting to low and went to bed at 10:00.  I woke up the next morning to find them all done.  I removed the lid and cooked them on high for 2 hours to thicken them up a bit. Wonderful!

My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  I had a bunch of apples I needed to use up, and this was a perfect and easy way to do that.  I also had some homemade applesauce in the freezer that we weren't eating, so I added this to the crockpot as well.  It turned out great!

I used this recipe to use up about 30 apples from the tree in my yard.  The apples I used weren't exceptional, but this apple butter came out divine!  I did use less sugar than called for per recipe, but kept the spices about the same.  This is the second time I use this recipe and plan to use it again and again in the years to come.  Thanks for sharing it.  :)

MMMMM...I love this apple butter. I folowed the recipe and by the end it was way too sweet. So I added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and cooked it a bit longer. Then put in my blender and poured it into jars.  It turned out perfect then!!!!

I have been making this every fall for the past 3 years to give away as Christmas gifts and it's always a huge hit.  No matter what kind of apples I use, I always use half the amount of sugar.  This year I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar for 10lbs MacIntosh apples (keeping the other amounts of ingredients the same, but using 2 heaping tsp of cinnamon) and it was even better than last year!  Great recipe!

This was a great / easy recipe.  i used xylitol & stevia instead of sugar without telling anyone.  Everyone loved it PLUS they thought I had done so much work to make it.  Even used my Ninja blender to chop the apples!

This is incredible.  I cut the sugar in half and added a little more cinnamon and cloves than the recipe called for.  To make it extra smooth I ran it through the blender.  Yummy!

Fantastic!  I recently went to a local Apple Fest, and when I saw them cooking big vats of apple butter over an open flame, I just had to try it myself.  I found this easy recipe, and made some slight changes.  I used 4 1/4 pounds of Jonagold apples, 2 cups of dark brown sugar, and one cup of white.  I skipped the cloves, and used a bit more cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg, and I sliced the apples, and left the skin on.  I followed the cooking directions exactly, and pureed it in my blender when it was done, and it turned out perfectly - thanks so much for the recipe, Betty!

Scrumptious!!!  I scaled this back as many others have noted to 20 servings - used 5 Royal Gala apples.  This absolutely does NOT need the full amount of sugar called for.  I cut the sugar in half once I scaled the recipe back to 20 (called for 1 1/4 cups, I used half of that).  SO YUMMY, started cooking late yesterday afternoon and let it cook overnight in my crockpot!  I am planning on trying this in the Apple Butter Spice Cake on this site :)

Very good!  I cut back on the sugar and still found it too sweet though, but perhaps that's just my taste.  Can't wait to incorporate this into my morning oatmeal.  Thanks!

Very good apple butter! Everyone in my family loved it and thought it tasted better than store-bought stuff. I added a little bit of ginger to it (following what someone else suggested) and it was fantastic :) I cut the recipe in half and was sad that I made such a small batch :(

Awesome!!!I just made this and love it.  I also cut my sugar in half and it is plenty sweet for us.  Also, I did not peel my apples--I cored them and put them in the crockpot.  After it was almost done, I  put in blender for about 20 seconds since we had not peeld the apples. Very smooth and tasty. Iwill definitely make again.

I followed other reviewer's advice and scaled it down to 20 servings (4 apples) and put it in the crock pot on high for an hour then left it on low overnight (about 10 hours). We enjoyed it on toast in the morning and i will definately continue to make this over and over again.

I love the ease of using the crock pot and it came really good.. I will put it in my food processor later when it cools to make it more smooth.. The color is a rich golden brown.. I used half brown sugar half white. I took the advice from another review and added a tsp. vanilla... cinnamon and nutmeg, no clove.  one tsp. salt too.. it has great flavor, can't wait to have it on an english muffin in the morning! This is a keeper!

This is a very sweet apple butter but my family and friends all love it. I tried making it a second time with half the sugar and though its still great, I felt like the first one came out better. I did add extra spices to the second batch and canned it to give to friends for christmas. My only issue with this is that it takes almost twice the time in the crock pot as the original recipe says, but if you know that ahead of time and plan for it it's ok.

Apple butter is a personal thing- you either like it sweet, spicy or in between. This is obvious based on the reviewers' comments.  I don't like mine very sweet and I like it spicy.  I chose this recipe because of the comments, but primarily for the method.  How nice to put together before bed and wake up to such a heavenly aroma in the morning!  I doubled the recipe, which filled my crock pot to the brim.  I used just shy of 6 c. sugar and increased the cloves a bit.  After cooking the last hour on low, I used my immersion blender as others recommended then let it cook on low just a bit longer to thicken.  When we came back from breakfast an hour later, it was a beautiful rich brown and even tasted less sweet.  My next batch will use even less sugar (planning 2 c. per batch) and more cloves.   I canned my butter- 11 lbs. = 7 pts.  Bring on the biscuits!

This was great!  I only made one change: I added a few tablespoons of corn starch to thicken the butter to make it less runny and easier to spread on toast.

This is a great recipe!  I love apple butter in the fall, and decided to make it since I have an abundance of apples this year.  I used a mixed variety of apples and allspice instead of ground cloves since I did not have any on hand. I tasted it partially through the cooking, and it tasted just like pie.  If you're impatient like I am, sneak a little aside for ice cream or waffles when it is only a couple of hours in.

Not only is this great with apples - try it with pears.  You adjust sugar to taste.  Some apples are sweeter than others.  I make Pear Butter too and it is wonderful.  I also run this through the blender after cooking to make it extra smooth.

This was really good. I didn't follow the recipe only though. I read the reviews and I did half the sugar since a lot of people said it was to sweet. Even with half the sugar I still thought it was a tad bit to sweet. I loved using the slow cooker though and it did have a perfect amount of spice. I will be keeping this one in my recipe box and just halfing the sugar.

YUM! Wish I could give this another half star because it truly is almost perfect. As written, though, this recipe is just too darned sweet (though delicious, to be sure).  I reduced it to 3 cups and liked it even better. I used gala apples. I want to bottle some to give as gifts at Christmas time.

OMG! This is amazing. I made 50 servings with Fuji apples. To make it healthier I used Splenda instead of real sugar. I cut it down to 2.5 cups instead of 3 cups and it's plenty sweet. No need to use 3 cups with this. I followed others suggestions and increased my cinnamon by almost double. I just made breakfast and used the apple butter on wheat toast. So delicious! I will definately make this again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a half batch.  I used Pink Lady apples which are sweet to begin with, so cut down the sugar a little bit (3/4 C Splenda and 3/4 brown sugar - next time I may use even less).  I also added a little bit of vanilla extract.  I had also made the Honey Cornbread available on this site, and when I paired the two together - unbelievable!  I'll be making a full batch for sure, next time!

I used this recipe in conjunction with a ham glaze recipe I found on this website made with All-Day Apple Butter, OJ, Worcestershire sauce, and onion flakes. 1st of all, this is the best thing in the whole world to have cooking in your house around Christmas. It just make my house feel (and smell) that much cozier! I did use my hand-mixer to get more of that "apple butter texture" in the end. The ham glaze I prepared only called for some of the apple butter so I put the rest into nicely decorated jars and gave them to my mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law as Christmas presents!

Made exactly how the recipe was laid out.  I love the way that it made my house smell.  Canned and gave away as gifts.  I love the tart of the Granny Smith Apples with the sweet.  Agree with others, that the recipe is followed to the letter that it's more than a little sweet.  I might cut back the sugar by a cup, and consider making it with Splenda the next go around for those of my family and friends prefer this as "sugar free."

This was so easy once I got past the peeling, coring and dicing 5 lbs of apples.  I used my hand held blender after about 9 hrs and it turned out a smooth apple butter.  I didn't have cloves so I omittted it.

This was a 1st time recipe for me so I had no clue what to expect. I did not stray from the recipe for that reason. Okay, so I did sneak in a little more cinnamon throughout the day.  This was an easy no fuss recipe!

Great recipe, I only gave 4 stars because of it's sweetness. Just a tad too sweet. ( I used 3 cups of sugar with gala apples). I'll try again, but with less sugar or a more tart apple. Made the house smell beautifully! (I put up in the crockpot at 8:30PM and turned to warm at 5:30 AM, turned off at 7:30AM).

I had a recipe very simular to this one and lost it, was so disappointed. I have found several wonderful recipes on here so I decided to try and find a replacement for the one I lost. Sucess!! It is almost identical and was wonderful. Although I also cut back on the sugar. Thanks for this recipe :)

I made this with about half the ingredients and added half a large can of pumpkin to make it pumpkin apple butter.  All I can say is AMAZING.  This was delicious and I still have some in my fridge.  I added nutmeg, ginger, and used more cinnamon and cloves than it calls for because I love those flavors.  AND it made my house smell wonderful and Fall-ish!

I made this apple butter but only made 1/3 of the recipe otherwise I would be drowning in apple butter. It still made a ton! I cut the sugar for the sweetness of the apples because it was a TON of sugar and I added a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe to give it a little more apple pie flavor. Delicious!

So easy and delicious!  I did take the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 c. and the result was outstanding.  I did have some chunks of apples but cooking a couple hours longer made it a smooth butter.

This was very delicious. I only gave four stars because I scaled back on the sugar and only used half the amount in the recipe.  I think any more sugar and it would have been too sweet for my family's taste.  I used Gala apples because that is what was on sale at the local market. I also scaled back the servings to 22 so I could use an even amount of apples and only 2/3 cup sugar.   I was unsure how to use apple butter so I made crepes and sprinkled the crepes with cinnamon and sugar then added a bit of apple butter to the center then returned the crepes to the pan just to caramelize the sugar and topped them off with a bit of fresh whipped cream, yummy. Though I think just eating this with a spoon right out of the bowl would have been good too. I have plenty of left overs so I can experiment with different uses.

First, let me say that 6 people thought the taste was awesome, but I did cut the sugar in half because of other reviews. I've never tasted apple butter before so there was no long-lost family recipe I was trying to duplicate. Some people had apple butter before and claimed this was much better. I totally destroyed it, but it was totally my fault. Here are my mistakes. I only used 2 1/4 lbs of apples. It looks like more than enough when it first goes in the slow-cooker, but no. I took a nap and even on low, I burned it beyond redemption. There was enough left in the center taste-test after only 5 hours. So next time, I'll use the full amount of apples if using the slow cooker. And there will be a next time. Judging by the comments of others who tasted, I think the cloves might add the extra something special in this recipe. Only 4 stars because of personal preference for less sugar.

Loved this recipe. Just what I was looking for - easy way to use up cooking apples. I did vary the sugar a bit for personal taste or the tartness of your apples. That seems like a no-thinker to me, as well as your spice preferences. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Fantastic way to use up the apples this fall.  I love this recipe as it is so easy and you can walk away from it and enjoy your day.  I do not like cloves so I left that out and substituted a pinch of nutmeg and a half tablespoon of Molassas....DELICIOUS!  I can't wait to do this with pears from our tree!

I love this recipe! I made it with local Macintosh apples from a farm down the road. I love the simplicity of the recipe. The hardest part was peeling and cutting the apples.  I will never buy apple butter again! The beautiful vibrancy of the apples really shined through and the spices/sugar just complemented it perfectly! I ended up canning it.

I like a lot more spice in my apple butter so I kept adding cinnamon and cloves.  I also added a little allspice and nutmeg.  I found this took about 17 hours to reduce and I had to leave the lid of to have the butter reduce.  Maybe my apples were more juicy.  I canned this and only got 2 1/5 pts after all this time.  It was still easier than on top of the stove.  You are always stirring on the stove

This was super easy and tasted just like the apple butter that it took my grandmother forever to make.  The only change we made was that we felt it was too sweet so we added 1/3 cup of apple cider.

I made this for the first time in 2009 and sold it at the Downtown Days festival in our little town. For the Garden Club to make money. I took a jar so the people could try it before they bought it and I sold out very quickly even the jar I was giving samples from. I am making it again this year and we are going to sell it again.  I process mine in a water bath for 10 minutes let them cool and store them in the cabinet. I have not found a single person that didn't like this recipe. Even some people that didn't like apple butter.

This has been such a hit that whenever apples are on sale, I buy a bunch and make this. Grand-daughters just love it, so I always have plenty on hand!

Very easy! I followed the recipe exactly and i used fuji apples. I thought there was a tad too much cinnamon so next time i will use 1 1/2 tsp. Before putting in jars i hit it with the blender for a few minutes. My husband is very critical, and he loves it! Thank you!

This was so good!  It didn't have the consistancy that I expected, my turned out more like a jam. I followed the recipe exactly.  Anyway, it's delicious! I didn't use the cloves because I don't like that flavor.

Really good and very easy!  One thing I did differently was to use my electric beverage mixer on it as a last step before putting it in jars.  Made it really smooth, almost a satiny texture.

wow this stuff is good! i made 40 servings, because that's how many apples i had. according to that recipe i had to add 2.5 cups sugar, i added less than 1, half brown half white. it's still pretty sweet though! i don't really have a sweet tooth... i didn't follow the recipe exactly, i put it in at 8.00 in the evening and was going out, so i put it on low... left it on all night, turned it off around 5.20 in the morning. i didn't see that you had to cook it uncovered. oh well, next time (there will surely be a next time!)...

Delicious apple butter recipe!  I made a double batch and canned many pints for winter.  I used the apples off our backyard tree which are pretty tart, so I did need the whole amount of sugar to sweeten it up.

I tried this recipe for the first time today. It was just wonderful. Reminds me of the apple butter my mom use to make for us. I did cut the sugar down. Used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of splenda.It turned out perfect. Will make again. I also added about a tsp. of apple pie spice and vanilla to it. I've used splenda brown sugar in place of regular brown sugar because I'm diabetic. Remember if you use splenda brown sugar the measurements are half the amount of regular brown sugar.

I love this recipe.  It is great to have on hand for subsituting for oil in recipes and also for putting over waffles or toast.  We like it chunkier and I cut the sugar in half when making.  It also smells sooo good when cooking. Thanks you!!

I ended up reading another recipe for apple pumpkin butter and thought that sounded really good but it called for applesauce which I didn't have so I used this recipe but only used 4 lbs of apples and then a 30 ounce can of pumpkin mix that was pre-seasoned so I halved the seasonings like cinnamon, clove, and salt and added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg...I kept the sugar the same and it came out beautifully and everyone loved the sweet pumpkin taste mixed with the bitter sweet apple flavor...I will do this again!!

This recipe is too difficult and calls for too much work.  To do an easy and good recipe:  process cored apples on a food processor; place 16 cups of the processed apples in uncovered cooker  along with 3C sugar,1Tbs cinnamon, 1Tb allspice, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1 cup cider vinegar. cook on high about 7 Hrs.  You can smooth the butter out with a hand blender if you want it smoother. Place in 1/2 point jars, process 10 min.

yes yes and more yes.  This is so cool!  Set it and forget it.  And very flavorful.  I had to use a sieve to crush them up instead of a wire wisk....but other than that I went straight by the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  Five stars.

This was easier than I expected. I removed the lid after a total of 11 hours and turned the heat to high for another 2 hours. Then I used my immersion blender to get a smooth consistence. I  canned the applebutter for gift giving. Everyone raved about it!

Excellent idea!  I filled up the crockpot with small diced apples. I only used 1 cup of brown sugar. I did not have cloves so I used allspice instead.  YUMMY!  I'll never buy applebutter again.

This is a good basic recipe. I cut the recipe in half, used half brown sugar with the white sugar, and replaced the clove for a bit of nutmeg. I cooked it a bit longer on low, closer to 12 hours total. I just used a spoon to stir out the big chunks. My kids LOVE it.

The texture was really nice after simmering it for an additional two hours (I like my apple butter really thick) but I just couldn't bring myself to taste the batch I made.  To me, it just smelled burnt.  I think it was from the cloves of which I am not a very big fan of to begin with.  I will be trying this recipe again however, this time without the cloves.

Delicious!  I think I used just short of about 5 pounds of Cortland apples.  I happen to have an apple peeler, so it made it a lot easier to prep the apples.  Decided to go with 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and it was perfect.  Kept the spices the same.  Lovely!  I ended up giving so much away to people who wanted some that I have to make another batch again!  Thanks for this recipe.

This was awesome!  I have never heard or have had apple butter in my life!  This is delicious.  I did take the advice from some other people and I did cut the sugar amount in half.  I think I could of went with just 1 cup.  Definitely make this again.

I HAVE BEEN MAKING A VERY SIMILAIR RECIPE FOR APPLE BUTTER FOR THE LASST 20 YEARS. IT IS A WONDERFUL, FRESH-TASTING APPLE BUTTER. I COOK MINE ABOUT 18 HOURS FROM START TO FINISH. I ALSO PUREE MINE WITH THE IMMERSION BLENDER. IT TURNS OUT VELVETY SMOOTH & IS WONDERFUL TO USE IN A SPICE CAKE. I USE ANY KIND OF APPLES THAT ARE ON SALE AT THE TIME. ALWAYS TURNS OUT GREAT! I FREEZE MY JAM & IT THAWS & SPREADS BEAUTIFULLY. CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE!

I love this recipe.  This is the 2nd year I have made it.  It is so easy, and since I ran out of sugar I used brown sugar instead.  You cant pass this one up, make it today!

This is awesome!  I made 24 servings with 2 lbs of Granny smith apples.  I cut the sugar back to 1 C instead of 1 1/2 like it called for after reading some other reviews.  It turned out so good!  Brings me back to my childhood eating apple butter on toast the day after the country fair.  :)  And it's very easy to make.  I will be making this recipe regularly.

I had never had apple butter before I made this, but I had a ton of apple to use up so I tried this. I thought it wasnt very good, but, my boyfriend liked it. So I guess I just dont like apple butter.

This is fabulous!  I kept the recipe as is, using 3lbs of red delicious and 2 1/2 lbs of gala (it's what I had).  Some reviewers mentioned putting the apple butter in a blender to make it smooth.  I used an electric mixer and it smoothed out most of the chunks (I like a few).  This recipe may just become a Christmas gift tradition.  Thanks for sharing.

Yum! and you house will smell so good! I agree with the sugar adjustments. If you have tarter apples, used more sugar to cut the tartness, if they aren't tart you can cut back on the sugar as much as 1/2c at least. I don't even peel the apples to save time because once they cook down, i throw my emulsion blender in the crockpot and schush away. You don't even know they are in there. I think it thickens it up a bit too.

This recipe is so simple and delicious.  I used a combination of honeycrisp, granny smith, red delicious and braeburn apples, and instead of cloves I used allspice.  I halved the amount of sugar called for (I used xylitol instead of sugar, which is a 1:1 ratio), and it is still very sweet.

Excellent recipe.  I used more cinnamon & cloves, plus I added allspice and nutmeg.  In a second batch I added some homemade caramel sauce (about 1/2 C) and it turned out divine!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Turned out great, I used Grannysmith apples and a little more sugar(1/4 cup). Instead of finely chopping I used my kitchen aid food grinder with the Coarse grinding plate. I started with the "Fine grinding plate" and it was messy, the apple chunks got stuck and it held back the juice. I read recipes on other sites so I had an idea of what apples to use. Grannysmith was not my first choice but my store has a limited rotating selection.  Do a search on baking apples and you should be good.  Also I cut the cinnamon in half because I don't care for things that have a strong cinnamon flavor. If you know you don't like something don't use it or use less. I think I may try this with some allspice next time.

I really liked this recipe, but thought it was a bit too sweet.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar.  Also, after having it cook all day, it was still pretty chunky, so I just mushed it up with a hand potato masher.  I actually enjoyed it a little bit chunky.  My house smelled amazing for days!

This is really good.  I didn't have any cloves and like a previous reviewer, I just omitted it. And I used half brown sugar and half white.   Also, I let it cook all day and night and still was too chunky even after stirring so I just popped it in the blender and it turned out great.  My kids woke up this morning thinking I was baking something yummy for breakfast :)  Fooled them HA!

This is a wonderful recipe; wish my mother was still here to see how easy it can be made today.  The aroma drifts thru the house and brings back memories of what I call "comfort food".  If not sure on sugar amount, start with one cup and taste; everyone has different likes/dislikes - I prefer tartness, use crabapples and cut back on the sugar. But definitely give it a try-it's wonderful and thank-you to Betty for sharing her recipe!!

This was so easy, and was the best tasting apple butter.  I did cut back on the sugar, and used nutmeg instead(we don't like cloves).  I'm going to use it for gifts.

This came out amazing but I made a couple of alterations. I halved the amount of sugar called for and it was still a little on the sweet side.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also did not have ground cloves so I used pumpkin pie spice.  I cooked it on high for 2 1/2 hours before switching to low for 8 hours.

This Apple Butter really is delicious!!! Specially on pancakes. I save the apple skins and seeds and boil them up with a cup or so  of water till the color comes  out of them then strain the liquid  reduce it to half a cup and add it to the rest of the apples. Also added a little less sugar than in the original recipe.

I like simple recipes and this one fits the bill.  I bought a 20lb box of Gravensteins. They are a little more tart than normal. I don't like extra sweet things, so took other's advice and cut the sugar in half. Also increased the Cinnamon and Cloves by 50% and also added 1/4 teasp Ginger and a teasp. of Vanilla extract. Cooked overnight and in the morning ran it through the blender. This is awesome Apple Butter and sooo easy. I am going to make all 20 lbs of apples into butter for gifts and my own cupboard. Fantastic!!

I am so happy with myself right now! I made apple butter! I've never even made jelly before! HAPPY DANCE! This turned out so delicious. I cut the sugar down to 2 cups & used 3.5 lbs. of Fuji apples. Absolutely fabulous! No pic cuz let's not lie, this stuff is brown & not particularly photogenic. And I'm lazy today:o):o) Thanks so much for sharing!

OMGoodness! this was absolutely delicious and sooooo easy to make. I've made two batches so far. The first batch I used red delicous apples and it turned out yummy! for the second batch I used braeburn apples and it turned out too tart for my taste so I would recommend using a "sweeter" apple to start with and you won't go wrong. BTW because the apples were sweet I used only 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and it turned out perfect! thanks so much for this recipe, it has definitely been added to my arsenal!!

Really good!  I scaled the recipe down to make 20 servings.  I used 4 Granny Smith Apples and a little more than 1/2 the amount of sugar than was called for.  I started the recipe later in the day than I meant to, so I just cooked it in the slow cooker on high for about 4hrs.,stirring occasionally the last hour, then took the lid off and cooked on low another 1/2 hr.  Perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This reminded me of my gramma's Apple Butter from the 50's.  Everyone loved it and after giving out small containers of it today I will have to make another batch next week. I chopped apples and started cooking at 9 Pm went to bed and it was done by morning.  I Puree'd the cooked mixture and then cooked for the extra hour.  Wonderful.  I wished I had the recipe last fall when the apples were picked.

This was delicious ... used Granny Smiths ... I am only giving 4 stars b/c I followed other reviewers' advice and halved the sugar ... also, used brown sugar for the white ... it was absolutely delicious, and still *really* sweet, even tho' my apples were tart ... I cannot imagine how sweet it would have been with the full amount of sugar! Anyway, thought the spices were perfect .. thanks!

This was ridiculously easy and awesome!  Gave as gifts and was well received.  I used Fuji apples so cut the sugar in 1/2 and did use both brown and white sugar.  Makes the house smell amazing!!!

Yummy!!  The kids and I made this for the grandparents Christmas baskets.  Turned out very nice.  The only change I made was to use about 1 teaspoon of fresh nutmeg while cooking.

I have made this a couple of times now.  The first time I followed exactly, then used an immersion blender and it was excellent.  Now I use 2 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Also add a little extra cinnamon, a shake of all spice, and left out the cloves.  Both ways were so good, i just tweaked it to my families taste.

This was so easy overnight but I had to leave my cover off for 1.5 hours on low then 1 more hour on high to get it right for canning. I guess my apples were extra juicy! I increased the cloves to 1tsp and changed the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown. I canned 2 half pints and 3-4oz jars for gifts this Christmas. Yummy!

I cut back the sugar by about a cup, and should have cut back even more based on the apples I was using.  I'd say I should have used half the sugar as others mentioned, since some of the apples I used were on the sweet side to begin with.  I used a mix of Granny Smith, McIntosh and Cortland, and it came out delicious, but very, very sweet.  Only other change was to add a couple shakes of allspice.  Still, it's a great recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

My neighbor's boyfriend has an apple tree in his yard. No one was doing anything with thoes beautiful apples. My other neighbors and I made apple sauce, then I made Dumplings, pie crisp, cinnamon applesauce. I still had apples, so I found this recipe and tried it. I have made two batches just to get to keep some for myself. Neighbors, family and friends all give this 5 stars!!

Yummy! I made this yesterday and just had some on toast this morning. It was really easy to make...I didn't even really measure the ingredients out. I just filled my crockpot full of apple slices, eyeballed the cinnamon and cloves, and only put in about 1.5 cups of sugar since I was using golden delicious apples, which are really sweet to begin with. This is going to be a fall tradition in my family! Thanks for the recipe!

This is AMAZING. I used 15 apples (mostly rome beauty) and about 2 3/4 cup sugar. I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg, used less cloves, and 2 heaping tsp of cinnamon. I let it go over night for about 12 hours, and then added more spices this morning when I took the lid off to let the water evaporate. I can't imagine using the full 4 cups of sugar. Otherwise this recipe is soo delicious!

Amazing!  So simple.  I didn't add any salt and I simmered it on high for 2 hours instead of 1.  I dont know if my crock pot just cooks hotter or what but it was deffinatly done 7 hours after turning on low.  I plan to make 2 more triple batches next weekend =)

I tried this recipe to use up some delicious heritage apples I was given.  Made as directed and it is delicious.  It did take less time to cook down, and more time to get rid of the water than the recipe states, but slow cookers vary.  Glad I tried this.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was great although I modified it a bit based on some other recipes I found around and, of course, I think you'd want to pay attention to how sweet your apples are, and how sweet you like your apple butter, when deciding how much sugar to use. The basic idea is wonderful and for me, I found the proportions of ingredients to be about right. I had very tart apples and used the amount of sugar given. I have a nice tangy "appley" taste from the tart apples, but it's plenty sweet.

Yes, you definitely need to gauge the amount of sugar relative to the types of apples you used.  Not sure of the type I used but they were on the sweeter side so I should have cut the sugar some.  Overall a good and easy recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I cut the sugar in half and used 6 "York" apples.  I also ran the apples through a food processor to make it smooth.  At first I thought it was still too sweet; but, once spread on a piece of bread, it was just right. Thank you Betty Ruenholl for sharing such a delicious recipe.

This recipe is fabulous and very easy (if you use a corer/peeler to prepare the apples). I have shared it with friends and it has become a fall tradition.

I didn't have 5.5bs of apples so I pretty much cut the recipes in half and used only 1 cup on Splenda for the sugar.  It's a really good recipe and a great use of the slow cooker.  I put half in the freezer and left half out for topping toast and english muffins!

So the first time I made this, I did what other reviewers did and put it in the crock overnight. bad idea... I woke to charred apple butter! I attempted to make it again and cooked it during the day using fuji apples. The second time, I cooked it for about 4 1/2 hours and then blended it. IT was GREAT! My husband loved it.

Wow! I wasn't even sure if I LIKED apple butter, but thought I would make some because I had a ton of apples. And I'm glad I did!  The recipe was super easy and butter is delicious!  
I had to guess on how much apples I was using...they were very small. I cut the other ingredients in about half and it turned out just right!  Thanks for a new favorite!

Great recipe. I used fresh Irareds that I had picked that day for a 1/2 recipe. I doubled the spices, halved the sugar (the apples were really sweet!) and also let it go overnight... it turned out great. Very popular with friends and family; makes a great gift. I've been eating it on toast with a little Nutella... yum.

Yum!  I had an entire grocery bag of apples from our tree.  I cooked the apples down on the stove for ~1hr beforehand, which worked well.  Also cut back on the sugar because the apples I was using weren't more sweet than tart to begin with.  Delicious, and will be enjoying throughout the year - on oatmeal, pancakes, toast, ice cream...

I just made this today and my husband and kids really love it!  My Grandmother used to make apple butter in a large brass pot and can it every year in West Virginia.  She passed away earlier this year, and though this isn't quite as good as the old fashioned apple butter she made, it's still quite delicious!  Thanks!!  (I cooked mine for about 2 hours and blended small amounts at a time in my blender to help the apples break down quicker, then returned the pureed apples to the slow cooker to finish cooking; so yummy!!)

I listened to other reviewers and put less sugar in it. I actually thought it was too tart and wished I had followed the actual recipe. I had to use an immersion blender to give it the proper texture. Good overall.

Easy and GREAT!!! I had about 10-12 apples and used 2 cups of sugar and I think the butter is a little on the sweet side so next time I will use more apples or less sugar but I was happy with the finsh product.

I had a ton of apples and decided to try this recipe. It was delicious. My house smelled wonderful and I gave some away to friends and they all loved it. I had never cared much for apple butter before this. Thank you.
