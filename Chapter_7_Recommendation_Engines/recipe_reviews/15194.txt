This was good-everyone enjoyed it.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and used garlic salt on the chicken to increase flavor.

This was really good.  I had to pound the chicken flat.  I used fresh mozzarella instead of shredded and had angel hair pasta with it.  It was very good.  Thanks for the post.

Good receipe,...makes a nice thick sauce. I didnt have any chicken broth so I added extra wine, water, and to add more flavor I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and some sugar. Delicious, thanks!!

I loved this recipe.  After I sauted the chicken and removed them, I first sauted a finely minced garlic and shallot for just a minute before I added the mushrooms.  And you could definitely double the wine and broth for more sauce.  However, I did not add the cheese at the end.  Just didn't need it.  My husband really liked this and said he would like to have it again.

Really good!  Took other people's suggestions and added my own seasonings.  I doubled the sauce recipe to mix with pasta.  Husband raved about it!  You should definately give this recipe a try!

I decided to make this for dinner night with some friends. After reading some reviews that this could be a little on the bland side, I added some flavor by use of a marinade.  While I was gone during the day, I marinated the chicken breasts with McCormick's Grill Mates® Zesty Herb Marinade.  I also add some left over marinade to the skillet while sautéing the mushrooms.  No problem with it being void of spice! Will probably make this again!

This is a very yummy recipe...but I recommend you pound those chicken breasts really thin - and add garlic, salt and italian seasonings..to really add flavor.  My husband loved it!

Super recipie!  I used frozen pre-breaded pre-cooked chicken breasts that I threw in the microwave for a couple minutes then browned to make the recipie even quicker.  My husband loved it and so did I but our 7 year old prefered something a little less elegant.

This was ok and has potential but lacked flavor. It needed something. I will try again and try some herbs. Tasted just a little too much like just white wine and flour. I think it should be a little more savory.

The ideal recipe –delicious, fast and easy.  I sliced the chicken breast horizontally to not only aid in the speed of cooking the chicken, but also so that the breasts had more exposure to the flavor of the sauce during the cooking process.   I’ll be making this again and again.

This was so easy, I could do it with my toddler at my feet!  And she loved it.  I only had canned mushrooms, but it worked well.  This will go into rotation!  The best part is the recipe is so easy that I have it memorized already!

This is a good basic recipe but it definitely needs more flavor. I added 1 clove garlic, half an onion sliced, and some freshly ground black pepper and it was still a little bland. The subtle taste of the wine and mushrooms is good but I think I will use more salt, pepper, onion, and garlic to season it next time.

great! I used 1/2 cup white wine and a whole can of chicken broth(instead of 1/2cup) and an extra tablespoon of flour, to make it a little less winey tasting. very good.

i have no time to thaw or even preheat anything.  but this recipe is great! i had a meal ready in 35 min. the wine is not overpowering-recipe keeps the chicken moist and full of flavor.  absolutely love this recipe.

I pounded the breasts thin to ensure even cooking, and I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs as well as Italian herb-flavored chicken broth. Even with all of that extra Italian seasoning, it was still on the bland side. Maybe next time I'll add some cracked black peppercorn to the bread crumb mixture for more flavor. It is definitely worth trying again.

Loved the chicken.  Me and youngest kid loved the sauce too, but the other 2 family members ranged from OK to hate it.  Maybe I'll mess around with the sauce next time.

I always make it without the cheese. It is really elegant, even with canned mushrooms in place of the fresh. I have found that if you do not want to serve it right away, you can make it in advance, but keep the sauce separate until serving. Then pour over the warm chicken cutlets and you're done!

Very easy and delicious!  I flatened chicken first, used italian bread crumbs and doubled the sauce.  This was NOT too bland as other posters stated.  The sauce was perfect with the subtle wine flavor.  Any more seasoning and that would be lost.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. The sauce had good flavor and the chicken was moist. The only thing I will do different next time is leave out the bread crumbs and just flour the chicken. I didn't think this was needed.

Great recipe.  The whole family loved it!  Great served with mashed potatoes and rolls.  The white wine adds a yummy flavor to an ordinary gravy.
