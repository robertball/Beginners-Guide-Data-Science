I really like this scone recipe (and I have tried quite a few scone recipes). I have used strawberry yogurt and raspberry yogurt, and my family has decided they like the raspberry better. Some others have mentioned dryness. What I do is start with a cup and 1/4 of flour, then add the yogurt and I add the milk to the mix, also. If I need more flour, I add just a little until there is a workable dough. Scones shouldn't be overworked, though, so I pat the dough instead of kneading it, then use a biscuit cutter to make my shapes. Thanks for the great recipe! PS I do reduce bkg pdwr to 2 tsps., four seems a little much!

I usually won't make anything that does not have a 5-star rating, much less something that hasn't even been rated yet, but I decided to try these because they looked interesting. These scones are good, with a great scone texture. I was all out of butter, so I used 1/8 cup of I Can't Believe it's not Butter and 1/8 cup of Crisco. I also only had the thick and creamy Yoplait yogurt. None of this seemed to have a bad effect. I was hoping for a more strawberry tasting scone, but it could have been the yogurt. Also, the dough was really strange and difficult to deal with and I only got 11 biscuits with the dough 1/2 inch thick.

Scones are usually served with jam and fresh cream, the fact that some people say that they are bland means that they didn't serve them the correct way!!! With Strawberry scones, try using strawberry jam and you will see that it all blends in together.....

The texture was great but they ended up really bland-even after I sprinkled sugar on the tops. I followed the suggestions and added berries to the dough, but even that didn't help out with the sweetness enough. Next time I'll add 1/3 cup of sugar to the mix and see how they turn out.

I don't understand why people want a super sweet scone; it's a SCONE, not shortcake!
This was a super easy recipe, although I did change it a tad; I used 6 oz. yogurt, and only 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  The extra 2 oz. yogurt didn't seem to affect the recipe except that the inside were just a bit too moist (I think next time I will bake them for 12 mins.  instead of just 10), and the scones still rose to a nice size despite using less B.P.  
I think, for not using any eggs OR sugar, this recipe is really good!  The texture (other than the slightly-too-moist issue) was really pleasant, too.
With jam... without jam... That is the question!

I made these Scones tonight and they were not good at all. I needed a recipe that used Strawberry yogurt, since I had a lot leftover, so I chose this one. I read the reviews before making them  so I checked the batter prior to baking them. I made the Scones by the recipe and tasted the batter it was bland and not sweet. I then added 4 Fresh Strawberries and 2 extra Tbsps of Sugar then crossed my fingers. The additions made no difference at all the Scones turned out like yogurt flavored muffins with no sweetness or flavor. I won't be making this again!

I really liked these... you could only taste the strawberry yogurt slightly- it wasn't too overpowering but it was definitely there.  Not amazing good still very good and very simple (great if you didn't have any eggs like me!)

I liked the recipe.  It was one of the best I have made.  My husband likes things on the sweeter side so I made a glaze with powdered sugar the strawberry yogurt and vanilla, butter and a little strawberry jam to jazz up the strawberry flavor.  I am quite pleased with this recipe and will make it again with other flavors.

Pretty good, actually! I used one 6 oz container of Archer Farms fat-free, sugar free Strawberry Cheesecake yogurt and no milk; the dough was a bit dry but very workable.  Two-inch, heart-shaped scones baked up nicely, not sweet, but true scones aren't!  No strawberry flavour, but that was probably due to the yogurt, not the recipe. I also used Crisco in place of butter; the scones weren't light and fluffy like others I've tried, but again, I'm blaming the yogurt or possibly over-kneading.  The recipe is a BREEZE so I'll be trying it again!

I make these often...especially when I need a quick treat for morning coffee! I reccommend 2-3 tsp baking powder, a whole yougart (8oz), and adding chocolate chips! They don't have a strong strawberry flavor, so any yougart is great to use! They are best served warm, not left over...

Not bad, but could be made better. I suggest using only 2 and a half teaspoons of baking powder (the suggested 4 makes it taste acrid!) Use only thick, good quality yoghurt - Greek style is best. Add a couple of tablespoons of honey too. For fan ovens, 190 Celsius is a much better cooking temperature, or they will burn. More cakey than scone-like texture, but could be amazing with these tweaks to the recipe!

I made a savory version of this recipie, using vanilla yogurt and a bit of cheese. My only regret was not adding a bit of salt. I needed to add about 1.5 TBSP to get the dough to form into a ball. I will make these again when I need to use up yogurt.

These had a very nasty yet bland taste.  There was not even a "hint" of the strawberry yogurt taste.  I was rather disappointed.

I used peach yogurt instead of strawberry (thats what I had on hand) and 1 3/4 cups of SELF Rising flour, no baking powder and the butter and they came out really good. Lots of peach flavor and tender. Even my no carb ating 2 year old loved them.

I too was disappointed with this recipe.  I was excited because it sounded easy and quick.  However, they turned out more like biscuits and the strawberry flavor was very faint. We used the leftovers to make a strawberry shortcake of sorts and my kids loved it.

They didn't have much flavor, so they ended up really being more like biscuits. They were still good, and easy to make.

I don't know what happened but these scones came out like hard, dry, bisquits.  The batter was impossibly crumbly and the flavor was very bland. Sorry.

I really wanted these to turn out.  They are okay and while they did rise fairly well they were really heavy.  Baking time had to be increased twice, total of 5 extra minutes but ovens vary so I'm overlooking that.

This recipe is so simple and fast, yet the scones taste as if they were very complicated to make. The texture was light and crispy. I used greek-strawberry yogurt and added just a teaspoon of buttermilk to the dough since I had some on hand. The only thing that I might do differently in the future is add a little honey or some natural sweetener to compliment the strawberry taste.

They came out very bitter, I wonder if that's from all the baking powder :-/

I added peaches and peach yogurt and a hint of sugar. I'm wondering if it's our baking powder as another recipe turned out very bitter too.
