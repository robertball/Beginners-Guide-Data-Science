This dip is awesome and easy to prepare. It also reheats pretty well (if there are leftovers!)

I felt obliged to splurge on "Fat Tuesday" and made this for my family. OH BOY did they/we dig in! It was super easy to make and if you have leftovers a cinch to reheat as well. I used the Tostitos Scoops and we just had a great time! Will definitely be bringing this to parties in the future....
