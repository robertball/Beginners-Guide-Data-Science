I liked this recipe!  Easy and everyone ate it!  I made a few changes only because its what I had in the frig.  I changed the beef to ground beef and used a few scoops of sour cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  Awesome!  Very good flavor!

This recipe is pretty good but it's not really a "stroganoff".  It would work better with rice than pasta but we really felt like pasta so I thickened it more.  In my opinion, the wine sauce should be reduced down about 1/2 way before adding the cream/flour mixture.  I added 1c heavy cream and 1c sour cream since I didn't have half n half.  I also used left over steak from the weekend and chopped it up in 1" chunks.  Since it was already cooked, I just threw everything in the onion mixture together.  I omitted  the mushrooms because my hubby hates them.  I added peas, 1TBS of worscheshire sauce and a tad of crushed red pepper to give it another dimension.  This was a good recipe.  I'm not one that can just throw things together, though once I have an idea I never stick to the recipe.  So, thanks for the wonderful idea.  It made leftovers.  :)

I'm so sorry but this was not for us! It was made according to instruction and I'm very thankful that I tasted the sauce before adding my roast beef. It was dreadful.  It almost taste like a Marcella sauce which I do like but not quite there...it was just awful. I don't know where straganoff came into the picture.

The sauce tasted delicious, but my beef was a little tough. I think cutting the meat into thin slices would lead to a more tender finished product. The only change I made (other than halving the recipe) was to add an extra tablespoon of flour. I don't know if I really needed it. My sauce was very thick with this addition. I did serve it over rice, as suggested.

Really good! My fiancee loved it!! I also, substituted sour cream a couple spoonfuls of light sour cream instead of half/half. Also, I put a spoonful of flour in it to thicken the sauce, which worked really well. Will make again!

I loved this recipe.  I substitued the white wine with Marsalla wine only because that's what I had on hand. I also thickened it up a bit more (added a bit more flour).  It was Fantastic! My husband said it was so silky...

This is an excellent recipe.  Everyone at work kept saying "that smells good what is it?"  Sadly for them I didn't bring enough and was *forced* to enjoy it all by myself.

Was very good and very tasty I like my stroganoff thick to put over egg noodles, so when it was mentioned in recipe that this is a thinner recipe I decided to use more flour in my cream mix. It turned out great! It reminded me of what my mother made when i was kid but with more flavor.
Thanks so much for the recipe it hit the spot. Tomorrow i will know how i did with it as i will be letting 2 friends try it wish me luck :)

Of course, I used beef tenderloin tips instead of sirloin.  The meat melted in our mouths.

Fabulous! The only changes I made were to use boneless chicken thighs instead of beef, and I only had 1/2 cup of white wine so I used 1/2 cup of red wine also. My boyfriend can't stop eating it and talking about how good it is! Definitely serve with crusty bread and butter.

My family really loved this dish. We had some leftover tenderloin that we used for the meat.  We also only had one cup of beef broth so we used a cup of chicken.  Another user mentioned adding a bit of sour cream which we did, too. We had it in stock. Might as well use it. We will definitely make this again. It was quick, easy and hearty!

Results were quite tasty.  I think the meat needs to simmer for at least 45 minutes with top on.  And I did have to add 1 more TBS butter after removing the onion/mushroom/ garlic mix from pan. Once the remaining ingredients are added needs to on real low simmer for at least another 45 min., stirring so it doesn't stick.  The flavors mix nicely. 
If it cooks less I can understand the flavors and taste not being good.  But once it's cooked together for a while the flavor comes out and the flour is properly cooked. Other than the butter and cooking it longer I followed the recipe exactly.   Came out great.   Thank you LAUREY !

iloved the base recipe. my family ate it up.  I did make variation however due to a food allergy.  the garlic and onions get cooked in separate pan because of  allegry but the non allergic just add it into theyre  own dish. the family was almost licking the plates. thanks for great recipe base.i also had to substitute for half and half used sour cream in place read others reviews and simmered the dish longer meat was exceptionally tender

WOW, excellent recipe... I've made this 3 times already and tonites dinner was superb. I gave it 4 stars only because I substitued a few ingredients. I used portabella mushrooms, which have a better flavor, instead of white buttons, I didn't have enough half and half to make 2 cups so I used 1c. half & half & 1 c. sour cream. I didn't have any white wine so I used extra dry Vermouth instead; Vermouth is a substiture for white wine. I used beef strips used for Fajitas instead of sirloin steak. I just simmerd the meat a little longer to make sure it was tender. Anyway, my husband just loved it; we just had to add a little more salt & pepper for our taste. Out of the 5 different recipes I have for Beef Stroganoff this one is my favorite recipe.
