I made as per the recipe and enjoyed it.  The filling was really delicious and not difficult,  The dough was a little challenging to wrap around the filling and I though the dough needed a lot more seasoning.  Try and get the dough s thin as possible.. and you probably wont need to cook more than 10 minutes.. I think mine we a little overcooked
