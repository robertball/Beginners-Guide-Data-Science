Clafouti is a French breakfast dessert that generally mascerates almond extract or kirsh, and granulated sugar with fruit like cherries.  Because blueberries are a juicier fruit than cherries, I took the first reviewers suggestion and added 1/3 cup more of flour to the batter.  Also at the suggestion of the first reviewer, I mascerated the blueberries with 3 TBSP. of sugar, and 1/2 teason of lemon extract. (almond extract didn't seem right for blueberries.)  It turned out wonderfully and my children liked this.  The texture is not cake-like, but again, not quite custard like.  Slightly like thick crepes.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was for the directions given, otherwise, this was a nice change for a breakfast offering, and my family enjoyed this.

The flavor of this was wonderful.  Although I was extremely disappointed in how the nice fluffy top that came out of the oven had fallen through and just become a mere coating over the custard underneath.  Had I read a review about more flour I might have tried that.  But I never saw that one.  Most clafouti's have the custard but the cake top should also hold up.  Therefore, only a three.

I made a cherry clafouti a while ago with a different recipe. I love fresh blueberries so I had to try this recipe. I followed a reviewer suggestion to use almost a cup of flour. The resulting clafouti was pretty much what I expected, but with a slight "rubbery" texture... I googled this and someone said you should not overmix it after combining the flour & liquid ingredients. You should stop handling it asap. So hope this info helps. Mine took about 55 min, and a few bits stuck to bottom of pan, (maybe overbaked slightly?) but we really enjoyed this! Thanks for the recipe!

This is really excellent and simple!  I have made it twice in two weeks.  The first time I made it I used raspberries and substituted light cream for the milk, I know more fat, but it gets worse (see below) and 1 cup of flour and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It was excellent!  Yesterday, I made it with fresh pineapple and coconut and it is delicious!  The worse part (more fat) is that I made a butter sauce (both times) that I always make with bread pudding to drizzle on each individual serving.  This is such a versatile recipe as it seems you can use just about any fruit or combination you like.  PS This is better than the other clafouti recipe on this site that has more ratings and I made that one with blueberries!!

The texture was in between cake and custard in that it was very chewy and egg like. I threw in a dash of cinnamon, the level of sweetness was subtle yet appropriate, next time I might mascerate the berries in some sugar to highlight their flavor.

I made two for an evening BBQ, one, fresh cherries (pitted them myself) and the other with raspberries, black berries and blue berries.  They came out perfectly.. My guests had a choice and chose both with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.  I gave 5 stars because I found this can be mixed in a blender or food processor with great results.... will save time.

Delicious! I used cherries, macerated with vanilla and sugar and 4 whole eggs (because I didn't want to figure out what to do with the extra egg white) and almond milk. It's plenty sweet, you could easily back off the sugar. Nice recipe!

I made this with fresh pitted and halved cherries (more traditional). It was heavy in texture but light and refreshing in flavor. Great the next day cold with a hot cup of coffee.

I really liked this recipe.  I added strawberries and did not have vanilla extract so I used almond extract.  Also added about a teaspoon of lemon zest.  i was not sure what to expect, but I thought this was yummy.

This was excellent, very creamy, and soft. It does not make you feel stuffed afterward as well which is nice

I didnâ€™t have any berries so I used apples, cut down on the sugar and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I think I would also like it as a savory dish with mushrooms and cheese and omit sugar. It is very tasty and filling.

It was good, but I'll bet the traditional cherry clafouti would be better. I'm going for cherries next time!

This recipe is easy, quick and yummy! I ended up baking it for close to an hour. It was not overly sweet, which was comforting - a perfect breakfast which tasted distinctly of eggs! I rated this four stars, but to be fair I would give it five if it weren't for my own personal taste - I'm not a fan of eggs. Still, I would reccommend this!

Followed directions to a T, it definitely has potential. I normally read reviews before making things of this site, I didnt for this. Next time I will go for the masceration with lemon and the extra dose of flour.

I had never heard of a clafouti.  Since I love any custard, I really liked this and with the blueberries, it was fabulous.  Easy to make and not your standard cobbler.

I used frozen, unsweetened berries that I defrosted first. 
I cut back the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was still plenty sweet enough. Next time Iâ€™ll try just half a cup.

Donâ€™t bake it until it is solid in the center - it will set more as it cools a little. 
I think this is good cold, too.

So my earlier post suggested I was going to serve this hot - no, that's a bad idea. I tried it both ways, cold is better. This turned out pretty well, but I think I'm not a fan of this style of cake. (This was my 1st clafouti tasting). But I think it came out right nonetheless. Thanks for sharing!

Well I did as was recommended, I added  1/2 c then 1/3 cup flour.  I should not have.  Custard was way to hard!  Also baking tome was only 45 minutes.  I will make again but follow the recipe snd use the 3/4 c flour as stated.

Love this as a base recipe! It was a big hit.I added a spoonful of orange juice concentrate to give it a hint of citrus, I would have used zest if I had it on hand. Can't wait to try it with cherries and raspberries.
