Georgia Lady, I grew up making this, also. It is so moist and rich. If you try it, you will enjoy and possibly fall in love with it! 
I also made one similar to it with drained canned purple plums. It was so moist it was almost a pudding. I won a blue ribbon with this at the fair. 
The fact that it says "prune" makes people shun it. If you just call them plums, the think it is amazing! And they are correct. Thanks for sharing a truly tasty treat. I hope people will try it.

I baked this cake exactly like the recipe and it turned out very dense didn't rise at all. Made some changes by adding 1tsp baking powder , a stick of butter and a total of 3 eggs also 1 3/4 cups buttermilk. The cake came out perfect fluffy moist. With the few changes I'll be making every year at the holidays!

THIS IS NOT A PICTURE OF MY PRUNE CAKE....IT IS MY RECIPE, BUT NOT THE PICTURE OF MY CAKE.

THIS LOOKS HORRIBLE AND IS INSULTING.

I can't say it's the best cake I ever had but it was tasty. Very easy to make and spiced just right. I used a mixture of prunes and dried apricots and it worked out fine. I cut the nuts down to one cup. The cake was nice and moist. I made a cream cheese frosting to go on it. Everyone went back for seconds.  I would make it again. A perfect cake for autumn with a hot cup of coffee.

I did not make any changes in the recipe. Followed it exactly and the cake turned out delicious! Everyone loved it. I used canola oil.

Great cake, brings back childhood memories!    I made it in a regular cake pan and doubled the prunes. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% and added a couple tbsp of butter.  I drizzled a piece of it with raspberry sauce and white chocolate sauce.  Then ate my next piece plain. Both were great!
