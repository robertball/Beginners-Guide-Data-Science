The rum ruins this recipe.  Use vodka instead, it's so much better!  I also use chocolate ice cream for variation, and like to add some chocolate syrup inside the glass before serving.  As is, not that great, the rum is the overpowering flavor.  But sub vodka, and this is a winner!

Where I worked, this was called a Hummer.  And it's exactly what you want to do when you take your first sip.  What may have ruined it for others:  Our recipe called for equal parts Kahlua and rum.  I can see how someone might feel the 3:1 ratio would be a bit much.  Also, we did not add ice, just the liquors and vanilla ice cream.  My favorite cocktail.

I almost gave it 4 stars because the taste of rum was powerful - but then realized it was my fault.  I only had dark rum on hand and used that.  Therefore it kind of overpowered the mocha taste.  I will make it again using light rum and might try using half vanilla ice cream and half coffee.  Thanks submitter.

I made this recipe two different ways.  I did half a batch using the rum and half a batch leaving the rum out and using milk instead.  We much preferred the batch using milk.    The rum seemed to overpower this to us.   The batch made with milk, ice cream, & kahlua was amazing!     I would definitely make this again leaving out the rum for our personal preference.
