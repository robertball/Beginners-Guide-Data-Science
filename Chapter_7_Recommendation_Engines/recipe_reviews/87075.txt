This recipe is ridiculous in the best way possible.  Try it!  Don't worry if you don't use every specific ingredient -- mix and match, improvise...but do use fresh ginger instead of powdered if possible.

Great flavor! I made it with sweet potatoes and omitted the sugar and celery. I zapped the potatoes in the microwave for 7 minutes before chopping them, so they were just right after 10 minutes of simmering. I like a chunkier soup, so I removed about 1/3 of the veggies, pureed the soup with a stick blender, and added the veggies back in; the texture was perfect. One word of caution: Even if you love spicy food (which I do), don't overdo it on the cayenne. I did, and although the soup was still delicious, the cayenne overpowered the other flavors.

Excellent flavor.  Trying to use up my potatoes and spinach, I did add more than called for and I also didn't puree the soup, I just used a potato masher and mashed.  It was a thick and chunky consistency and quite tasty.  Will definitely make again.

Unique soup, I love the ginger.  

I tripled the spinach and could even add more as it really cooks down.  I went ahead and pureed it all but found a few potato chunks which were nice, so next time I'll leave some more chunky.  I'd actually like a little more garlic and maybe some black pepper as well, I went lite on the cayenne just incase :-)  I'm looking forward to eating it tomorrow and seeing if its even better.

Well this was my first attempt ever at making soup and it turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself! I used a hand mixer to blend and it spattered EVERYWHERE, even on the lowest setting. The total prep/cok time this took me was 1 1/2 hours (compared to the suggested 35 mins). Wondering if anyone peeled the zucchini or left the skin on?? It tastes great and has wonderful presentation capabilities with the red pepper garnish. And I agree on watching the amount of cayenne :)

Severely bland as written. I tripled the spices and still ended up just dumping a bunch of curry powder into it so it'd taste like something. If you're not vegetarian definitely use chicken stock instead. Or just try another recipe...

I would have rather used chicken stock with this recipe, vegetable stock dose not give it enough falvor, with the veg stock I had to hit it with quite a bit of salt, vinager, and fish sauce to get enough bite to it.

Very tasty last minute dish! I didn't exactly follow the recipe but the basics were all in there. I added added carrots, subbed cinnamon and cumin for allspice and added a can of garbanzo beans to make it a little heartier. I like a thicker soup so the garbanzo beans were a great addition, I think maybe more potato would be good too.  I will definitely be making this again.

THIS was AMAZING! different and delicious.  I did use sweet potatoes and when they were finished and it was time to add the spinach I had fresh spinach that i had thrown in the freezer to use. I separated everything from the broth by straining it, and put a little bit of the broth and the frozen spinach in a blender and blended an entire bag, so way more than a cup.  Then I mashed the potatoes celery and all that stuff with a fork and put everything back together, broth, potatoes and pureed spinach. it was SUPER amazing!

Very good and good for you. We added pinto beans, doubled the spices and used chicken stock. Great with some crusty rye bread to dunk.

This soup is incredible; tasty and easy to make.  I used brown sugar instead of turbinado because it isn't available in the stores where I live.  I used frozen spinach which is what I had on hand and it tasted just fine.  I adjusted the heat a bit since I like my food spicy.  This one is a keeper, even the boyfriend likes it.

Mmm! This is so yummy! I took other reviewers advice and only blended about 3/4 of the soup, leaving some chunks. It was really great! Thanks.

This soup was incredibly bland as written. I had to add quite a bit of ingredients to make it decent, and even then it was nothing special. I won't make this again.

Extremely good.   I also like chuncky soup so I didn't puree it either.  I didn't have fresh ginger and used powdered ginger and it came out so yummy! Next time, I am going to put some extra firm tofu in it to give me some protein.  But awesome tasting recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and very flavourful. I just made it last night as the first soup I've ever put together, and it turned out great, although I may have added a bit more spices by preference. ;)

This recipe lacks flavor and character. It works out to be a warm mix of veggies that doesn't even jive. I ate it cause that's how I do, but will not make it again.

We made this soup last night for a Jamaican lunch my daughter's Girl Scout troop is doing today.  We made it exactly as written, and it seemed a little bland, so we added a little more salt and cayenne.  I know that some soups are much better the next day, so I was hoping this was the case.  I heated up a bit a few minutes ago and it was delicious!  I do think using fresh ginger is very important to this recipe, and next time (yes, there WILL be a next time!) I will probably use chicken broth rather than vegetable.  The key is making it ahead of time.

I loved this soup!  It was most certainly NOT bland and I didn't even add the cayenne pepper as I was cooking for children as well as adults.  I will make this soup again and again, thank you so much for sharing this!

Everyone loved this soup! I used chicken stock, 4 cups pre-made and 2 cups fresh.  I left out the potatoes because of an allergy. Added a little more zucchini and left it chunky.  I think I went a little light on the cayenne but my son liked the broth so that was probably better. Used lots of spinach.

I served this to company and everyone from teen to adult enjoyed it.  In fact, some wanted more for dessert!  I served it along with Jay's Jerk Chicken, Jamaican Rice, and Carrot and Pineapple bread.  I made no changes to the recipe.  I have tried it completely blended as well as just blending half the soup and mixing it in with the remaining non-blended soup.  Either way is great, just depends on your preference.

I love this soup! I have tried it with both vegetable broth and chicken. I prefer it with the chicken it seems to have a much better fllavor!  I made Elijah's Phulourie to go with this and some cilantro chuntney. You can find the Phulourie on this websites. They are delicious.

This did not turn out well for me. It seemed a bit bland. I don't think I would make again.

Thank you for submitting this recipe. Being on a 10% fat/vegetarian diet, it is very difficult to find great recipes.  I am not missing a thing with this dish!  I look forward to making it, as written, when I have the ingred. on-hand.  I used sweet potatoes, instead of yellow, and added a can of black beans. I also added yellow squash, just because it had to be used - went very well.  I didn't have vege broth to substitute the chicken broth, so used V-8, diluted.  This soup is perfect for this fall weather- hearty and flavorful-I will have often!

Wonderfully complex flavors. I would concur and say the ginger is essential. I actually didn't have much spinach left, which is the soup's namesake, so I used kale. I also subbed cinnamon and cloves for allspice and Chinese chili oil and sweet smoked paprika for cayenne and it turned out great. I blended it only slightly with a stick blender and it ended up with a thick and slightly chunky texture. Delicious!

Very flavorful. I did not blend this soup as directed. Added more turmeric, pepper and spices. Less nutmeg. Increased vegetables especially spinach. Would make again and probably add carrots.

Looked for a potato and spinach soup and came across this. The combination of spices looked adventurous, but the proportions timid, so I amped them all up considerably. (And, as others have said, using fresh ginger is vital. And I used demerara instead of turbinado, but any brown sugar will suffice.) We like heat in our family, so I added a crumbled dried ghost pepper. I like a thicker, creamier soup, so I heeded the warnings of those reviewers who complained it wasn't thick enough, so I added one more of each ingredient, plus a rutabaga, with only just enough broth to cover it. Then used two big bunches of spinach. Hand-blended well, but not too well, so that it was slightly chunky. It was a big hit with the family, including the boy who's not a big soup fan. Though the prep time was kinda long, this has become an instant go-to soup for us. Plus, by using more ingredients, it lasted a few days, which was an added bonus.

Be sure to leave this a little chunky. I puréed everything and it's like eating a salty, veggie smoothie. The flavors are great (I added a lot of heat via sambal oelek) but consistency is just two thin.

I absolutely love this soup.  I recommend following the recipe up to blending.  Blend as noted however, place the spinach and pepper in whole.  It adds a bit of texture while keeping the creamy body of the soup.  Great Recipe!

I read a few reviewers said it was bland and added more spice and salt.  But when I tasted, it was way too salty so I added more potatoes.  It definitely changed the flavor after a day and then the second day.  I liked the second day better but still, I wasn't blown away by this recipe.  It would be a 3 star soup for me.  However, my husband really loved it so I gave 4 stars.

This soup is very good!  I did not used the sugar or turmeric, instead I added thyme, pumpkin and tomatoes.
I also cooked the spinach with the rest of the ingredients. I purée some of the soup and mixed cook rice with the unpuree. Delicious both ways!

This soup is sooo yummy! The flavors are awesome. Didn't have any zucchini so i added in more celery. I know this is a vegetarian dish but i added some beef stock and chicken stock. Also didn't use a blender-love the chunkyness and individual flavors of the vegetables. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again! :)

I tried the recipe. It was great vegetarian style. When I reheated it for leftovers, I added beef bouillon and some garlic salt. I might add shrimp to this!

Subbed 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for the allspice. Added an extra potato and an extra tbsp of ginger. Subbed a pinch of chilli flakes for cayenne pepper and added about 4 handfuls of spinach instead of the one cup. Also did not add the peppers and the zucchini. Puréed until smooth. VERY DELICIOUS!

Fantastic!  Pretty much perfect, but I do add a lot more spinach than it calls for.  Sometimes I'll add a jalapeno for some heat.

I liked this a lot--I like healthy recipes. :) I also liked how this depended on spices for flavor rather than salt (healthier! And more interesting...). Unfortunately, when I went to add spinach, I discovered I did not have any. I improvised and threw in some green peas. It was still really good, great flavor, but next time I will make sure to try it with spinach! Thanks for the recipe.

This is such a flavorful, quick soup, I know I will make it often. I was too lazy to make a veg. stock so used chicken stock I had in the freezer. The ginger is subtle but gives a wonderful warmth. My family is never too impressed with zucchini unless it's in a cake but they all loved this soup.

What a lovely soup! Made as written except didn't have a potato so used a carrot. It was delicious and the spices are perfect. As a vegetarian,  I'll be making this a lot. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This is a recipe from the Fresh cookbook. Fresh is a restaurant in Toronto which makes amazing soups.  This recipe doesn't reflect that in my mind.  I had the cookbook and googled it to get reviews.  Well I followed others reviewers instructions adding an extra potato to make it thicker and the consistency was perfect.  The only other change I made was I used chicken broth instead of veg.  The soup was good but bland, which I think was a reflection of the potatoes.  I added some lemon and durkee hot sauce and I think I over did it because the hot sauce was overwhelming in it after I did that. I will probably make it again and add less hot sauce next time but it definitely needs something to liven it up.

Excellent flavor, and VERY forgiving... I made so many modifications to accommodate the ingredients I had on hand.

- 2 onions instead of 1
- No celery
- minced and jarred versions of the ginger and the garlic rather than fresh
- ordinary sugar and salt
- 2 yams instead of potatoes
- low sodium chicken stock instead of vegetable
- 4 dashes of cayenne powder (gave it a nice yet still subtle kick!)
- doubled the spinach
- nixed the bell pepper

And I just diced everything up into bite-size pieces and skipped the blender step. It turned out both aesthetic and delicious!

I tried this recipe exactly as it is with no modifications. I loved it! My friends loved it and my kid loved it. The only thing I did different was that I blended half of it and left the other half chunky, then I combined it again, so it wasnt all mush. Next time I will add pieces of chicken and dumplings to it, that will make it even better, but it is already great as it is.

Absolutely delicious! I'm on a special diet called GAPS, so I had to make a few modifications. I used homemade chicken broth instead of veggie broth, a teaspoon of raw honey instead of the sugar, 2 large turnips instead of the potatoes, and then since I didn't have any zucchini on hand, I subbed a 14oz can of pumpkin. This soup had so much flavor and was so smooth. We loved it and will definitely make it again soon!

This soup is delicious! Low calorie and very filling but so good I want more. :) Thank you for sharing this recipe!   My differences: 1/2 red onion vs a full onion, white sugar instead of turbinado, and 5c chicken stock vs 6c vegetable. I just used what I had.

This soup was delicious and easy to make. I have made it several times now and have a few recommendations. Use sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. Don't use sugar since the sweet potatoes are naturally sweet. Use extra spinach and add it at the very last minute so it wilts. If you add it earlier, it gets kind of slimy and gross. I never puree it since I love chunky soup!

This soup is good, I liked the idea of spinach in soup, but I am not sure, I will use this recipe in the future. Or I will make modifications. As I said, the soup was good for me, but not a spectacular. I didn't like potatoes in the soup and I would increase spinach amount. The soup was flavourful, I felt all spices, but I missed something in this soup. But, thanks anyway for the recipe.

This soup is fantastic! We don't like zucchini, so I used half a bag of coleslaw mix. We love the taste, and it is definitely a keeper.

SO GOOD!!! and easy! I am a beginner cook and managed just fine. I was a bit wary to try this and wasn't sure how it would turn out but it is AMAZING. The flavors are unique-- a delightful mix of warm spices, sweet ginger and just enough tangy spice to keep it interesting and balanced. This soup also gets better as it sits so leftovers are to die for...a must try!!!

Exceptional recipe. We enjoyed it with extra spinach alongside "Skillet Grilled Catfish" recipe and some homemade french fries. Perfect! Next time I might just try adding in some jalapenos for my spice-lovin' husband!

This is a wonderfully satisfying soup, especially if you're dieting and enjoy savory, full flavored food.  Very simple to make and will make it again for sure

This was really good - I made it for my fiancee after reading all the good reviews, and she liked it a lot. She's a new Vegan, so finding good food is still kinda tough for her. 

The only thing I changed about the recipe was that I minced a bunch of crystallized ginger I had on hand, rather that using fresh ginger. I also omitted the turbinado sugar, since the crystallized ginger had sugar in it. 

I pulsed my soup in the blender for a few seconds, and I have to say, it turned out really well - very smooth, visually appealing, and the flavors were great. You can definitely taste the spinach, and the heat was very subtle - it snuck up to you, and was very "warm", rather than coming across as too spicy. Will definitely make this one again, perhaps with some marinated tofu added in for good measure.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  I've been looking for a good soup that didn't have any pasta or meat in it.  The old standby veggie soup was getting a little tired.  by the way-i didn't blend the soup and it was still wonderful!

This soup tasted MUCH BETTER the second day.  It took a lot of time to chop all the veggies.  It has an unusual taste but I love that it is super healthy.

I love this soup! I have made this several times. For those that say it's bland; I always triple the dry spices & 1.5 the sugar. Extra ginger is good too. I make all different types of soup regularly & this is one of my favs.
My kids like it too :)

This soup is outrageous!!  I followed another reviewers advice and left it a little chunky but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  My only change was to leave off the red pepper since we don't really like them.  Thank you so much.  Healthy ... fast ... and really yummy!!!

This recipe was delicious! Great during cold weather. Don't puree everything - having chunks of potato is nice!
