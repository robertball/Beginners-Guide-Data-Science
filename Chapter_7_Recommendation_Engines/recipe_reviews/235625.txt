I love this recipe, and my family loves it, too.  It's so simple, but so good! I have made it several times now, and each time it quickly disappears. I would recommend spraying your pan so the tortillas don't stick when you're trying to serve the casserole. The second time I made it, I added a can of black beans and a can of sliced black olives. Yum! This is a keeper!
