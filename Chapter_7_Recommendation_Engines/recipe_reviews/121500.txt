Very good treats.  After reading some of the reviews with problems others had..here is what I did:  I lightly butttered the pan, then lined it with parchment paper which was also buttered and which extended up the sides of the pan.  I assembled and baked the bars per the recipe, but before they were set, I lightly scored them into squares (I didn't cut all the way through, just through the chcolate and the top of the crust layer) then when the chocolate was completely hardened, I pulled the bars out by grabbing a hold of the edges of the parchment paper, then placed them on the counter and was able to just snap them into nice little squares.  I had absolutely no issue with greasiness or with the butter seperating.  I would think that if you did it was because either you used margarine (and you really really do have to use REAL butter for this..it's a chemistry thing), or low quality butter or else you didn't let the toffee mixture boil long enough.  I started counting my one minute after it was at a complete full boil

After making these six times this holiday season, I believe I've perfected this recipe!  

You can use any variety graham crackers or even gingersnaps for the crust, but always use pure unsalted butter. Make sure you crush them well into small enough pieces/crumbs (a food processor worked perfectly) so they'll have enough surface area to absorb the butter and not be greasy. Make sure they are about half crumbs and half pieces, not all pieces! This will also make sure the crust will cover the whole pan and be nice and crunchy.

Bake for ten minutes and the crust may not get browned, but take it out. Boil the mixture for at least two minutes and spread evenly. 

Bake for exactly 10 minutes more and let stand for five minutes. Use one cup of chocolate chips for a thick chocolate layer (equal to the crust) or one-half cup for a thinner chocolate layer. Let stand for five minutes, then spread and immediately press 3/4 cup chopped nuts onto it. I also used toasted coconut (or a mix of the two) in place of the nuts. When you take it out of the pan (using greased parchment paper!!) some of the nuts usually fall off.

And finally, after about half an hour out of the oven, so the pan is cool enough to handle, pop it in the freezer! This was the step that made the most difference in my recipe.

yumm :) in case youre dumb like me, it took me a while to figure out what the vanilla wafers were; i ended up using the nabisco nilla wafers and ground them up in a food processor and it turned out splendidly :) also, when it says spread the toffee evenly over the crust, spread it evenly! i thought i could pour it out and then spread it with my spatula, but it didn't work too well. still, yum!! :)

This recipe was great.  I did not change anything.  However, I had a very hard time getting them out of the pan and cutting them.  Next time, I will use parchment paper!

These were fabulous!  I used milk chocolate chips for the topping which tasted better than the semi-sweet.  For those who have trouble with the bars sticking or being greasy, be sure you stir the butter and brown sugar vigorously after cooking until it pulls together. If you do, you won't have a problem with either sticking or greasiness.

I have been looking for a good chocolate toffee recipe for years and finally found one that is worth repeating. Made these as part of the 2008 Christmas cookie repertoire and all I can say is WOW!!!  These just melt in your mouth!  Just the right crunchiness, just the right amount of chocolate, just right pecans...I followed some readers' suggestions to double the base crust, and I agree that this was a good idea. Also, someone suggested pre-scoring the chocolate (before cutting) while it was still soft; also a good idea. Will someone please tell me how to get bar cookies---ANY bar cookies---to come out the same size?  I am all over the place with this, even when I use a ruler when cutting!

The taste of these is great, but I wasn't as satisfied as I expected to be (based on the other great reviews).  When I cut the bars up, the crust was very very greasy/buttery, and I had to soak the grease up with paper towels for quite a while.  Also, for me, there wasn't enough crust to spread out on the pan, so I made more crust (1.5 times more), and thus had to cook the crust for about 5 minutes longer.  I'm not sure why, but there was nothing crunchy about these as the name implies...

This was a very simple and quick yummy treat.   VARIATIONS: 1. Used Snyder's of Hanover's Honey Wheat sticks (pretzels) instead of wafers. This provided the PERFECT combination of salt and sweet. I crushed them in the food processor where I had about 65% powder and 35% crumbs.  2. Used a silicone pan to assist with ease of removal 3. Scored the crunchies and put them in the fridge and once cooled they came out of the pan with ease.   These were a hit with the family this Christmas and I will definitely make them again.

I made these for a cookie exchange and out of 15 cookies it was voted the favorite!  It's super easy to make, only hard part was the cutting.  I lined the pan with foil and then put in the fridge over night so the chocolate would harden.  Then to cut, had to use a large wooden cutting board and sharp knife.  About 30% of the 3 batches sheered off like peanut brittle, but the rest cut into bars.  It's rich, so small bars are all you need.

I would rather take the time and make regular toffee next time.  This turned out to basically be a falvor lacking crust covered in chocolate.  The toffee layer was lost between the two and was barely noticeable.  Not a winner this holiday season, and I was really hoping it was.

OMG! These are sooooooooo good!!  Not only are they quick and easy to make but they taste so incredibly good!  I thought it was going to be like candy based on the title, but they tasted more like the Samoa Girl Scout cookies (which are my favorite!).  Thank you for this recipe!!

I always get great reviews with this recipe. Be sure to melt the butter and brown sugar at the same time before/while bringing them to a boil or they will separate. I use a parchment lined pan as well for easy cutting.

I have made these twice for Christmas cookie exchanges and won first place both times!!  Secret is to use parchment paper in the pan.  Also, I let it set overnight in the fridge before cutting.  I would not recommend doubling because then the crust may be too thick or thin.  Make one batch after the other.  Also, you can grind up the cookies in a blender if you do not have a processor

EXCELLENT.  I made 3 batches of these for the holidays.  I found I needed to increase the toffee layer to 3/4 c each of butter and brown sugar in order to have enough to cover the entire dish.  Also, due to nut allergies, I used Heath toffee bits as the topping.  Definitely a keeper!

These were just too sweet for my taste. I made them instead of the Saltine Toffee Cookies that I normally do. I'm going back to the Saltine ones next year.

These were yummy. Made at Christmas time to put on my cookie tray. They are very rich so I broke them into small pieces. Everyone loved them. They taste like a heath bar.

Like another reviewer suggested -- if after you bake these, you freeze them and then allow them to thaw and then cut these cookies, you will have no trouble at all. These had a wonderful buttery and Holiday taste to them! Fabulous!

Like the others, I brought these to a party, and they were a huge hit! People could not believe these were made with saltine (salada in NZ) crackers. I want to experiment and use other types of salty snack foods with this, so next time, I am going to make this using pretzels! That should be good too!

I adore these treats. They are super easy to make, and taste like you are the best pastry chef ever. I take them to work and do they ever disappear quickly. Even though they take very little time to make, all my coworkers think I slave over the oven all day just to bring them in.

This recipe was great!  I made 4 batches last year as part of my Christmas baking, and NONE of them made it to Christmas.  I made some without chocolate/nuts , too, and they turned out wonderful!  Some of them didn't survive the cooling rack!

These were fairly easy to make and taste like they could be from a fancy dessert shop. Warning, they are VERY RICH! I love toffee and buttery taste, but could only eat very small slivers of this at a time. Instead of pecans, I put heath bar bits over the top, YUMMY!!! Also lined pan with aluminum foil for easy cutting, removal, and clean up.

These were really very good, and super simple to make.  However, they came out "thin" looking, which is the first thing my Hubby said when he saw it.  I would serve this as a snack, or part of a cookie tray, but not as the main dessert.

Very easy and came out perfect. Did use parchment, but didn't score before chilling, which I will do next time. I agree that they'll go a long way, as they're quite sweet. May add a tad more chocolate next time, and I gently pressed the nuts into the chocolate before the chocolate set up. I've had trouble baking since moving to altitude, and am switching to recipes like this that don't rise. I'm happy to have found this one. I did see another version that used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers; otherwise exactly the same.

I made these for a bake sale and they were one of the first to go.  They looked easy and they were!  I did taste test them before they were set out and I loved them and felt confident offering them.  Definitely a go-to recipe!  Didn't change a thing!

These are really really good!  Don't try to cheat and microwave the butter and brown sugar together- turns out much better in a saucepan with very little extra effort:)

Delicious!!  I recommend adding a pinch of salt to the crust mixture.  Also, add approx. 1/4 teaspoon of salt when melting the butter and brown sugar together.

I followed the recipe but I couldn't find vanilla wafer crumbs so I used graham crumbs and it worked great!  good flavour!  Tip: to speed up the process of it hardening, pop the tray in the fridge for about an hour and then cut them, that way you can enjoy them quicker! :)

These were a big hit with the family this christmas. I will definately make these again. They are similar to a recipe using saltines just layed out on the pan with the toffee mixture poured over that. But these are thicker. I used Hazelnuts instead of pecans and that worked out great. I also lined my pan with cooking spray and parchment paper. After letting it chill in the fridge i simply pulled out the whole thing by using the parchment paper. I then cut it into squares on my cutting board. I made a second batch but used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers and they turned out pretty good but the vanilla wafers were better in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe...it's going in my box.

OK, so these had the potential to be really great, but for my family and I, the butter was overpowering!  We made it according to the recipes, but the end result just tasted of butter!  Granted, I could taste the toffee after a while, but it seemed to just coat my mouth, which is not something I truly enjoyed.  If I were going to make this again, I would probably just use a traditional graham cracker crust, hopefully to cut down on the severity of the butter.  3.5 stars.

This was good, but I think the "toffee" layer should have been a little thicker. I think if I make them again, I will double that portion of the recipe.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  It is THAT delicious and easy!!!  One of my children even declared it her absolute favorite food ever after tasting it!  The favorite out of at least 20 different cookies at a cookie swap and interestingly enough, this one was the easiest and quickest to make!

I followed the instructions exactly and they tasted pretty good, but not as good as I expected from the reviews. I also had the problem of butter separating and dripping off the bottom of the squares, so I had drain them on paper towels. That being said, they are disappearing quickly from the cookie jar, so I'll give them 4 stars. I'll try again following the tips of other reviewers to see if I can fix the butter problem.

Although it turned out very good, it was WAY too sweet. I like the idea of using vanilla wafers, because it gives a crunch you can't get with graham crackers. But you can't just buy the wafers crumbs. I don't know about anyone else, but I had to mash them up myself.  There was probably no need to add the exact amount of sugar recom. I would add less next time. The amount of wafer I used didn't fill up the pan. I had to use some graham cracker to fill up the holes. The toffee was good, and I believe you need that much sugar to make it the correct consistency. For the chocolate top, I would use dark chocolate next time. It was too sweet with the semisweet chocolate chips, however, very easy to spread.

This recipe didn't turn out at all.  The chocolate chips never melted but softened only a little enough to stick.  The toffee part didn't harden.  I followed the recipe exactly but no luck with this one.

These are delicious and very easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and scored them before the chocolate set. I had planned to use parchment paper as well but forgot. I had no difficulties getting them out of the pan.
Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic! I made them for some holiday treats for my husband's office. I admit, I made backup cookies in case these didn't work out, but they were perfect! I live in humid Florida, so I was concerned about the toffee setting up...it did great. My only advice is to follow the TIME instructions to a T. I did, and it was so good! Thank you!!!!

These were very tasty cookies!  I think I needed to add a little more for the crust part. Mine came out very thin, but the flavor was still great.

The only problem with these bars is that I have to make a second batch (I ate the whole batch in 2 days!) Very yummy and easy to make. I used Hershey Kisses instead of chocolate chips because it was all that I had on hand. Great recipe!

I goofed up...prepared and used a jelly roll pan. I couldn't figure out why each layer seemed so "skimpy" but now I know why! Actually it turned out well as it was a thinner more toffee brittle texture. Wasn't actually a bad thing as it sort of broke into smaller pieces (rather than squares) and was also great considering how sweet it is. Overall, it's a wonderful cookie and I will be making it again. Am undecided if I'll use the proper pan or will repeat my error and go for the thinner cookie again.

Absolutely amazing!  Brought these to a family party and everyone loved them.  I should have made two batches!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I thought they were perfection.  I did line the pan with parchment paper with a little overhang on each side so that it was easy to lift them out and cut once cooled.  I will definitely be making these again!

Excellent recipe! I lined the pan with parchment paper and even gave it a spritz of Pam just in case. This recipe was totally easy and very delicious.

When the pan was partially cooled, I slipped the parchment out onto a cutting board and let it cool a bit more. Cutting them was no problem with a good, sharp knife.

These are very good!  I lined the pan with foil to make cutting easier, highly recommend it. I also toasted the pecans a bit beforehand to bring out more flavor.  And I added almost another cup of choc chips to cover it all well enough.  But otherwise perfect and definitely a keeper!

I loved it!! So did my mom.  I didn't have any vanilla wafers so I used chocolate and it worked out beautifully. 

I did follow the other review of lining the bottom with parchment paper so the sides are covered, I greased the pan and the parchment paper so all I had to do was remove the paper and pull it away (which I had no problems doing).  I also cut the bars, not fully, before the chocolate harden so cutting them was easy.

Only problem, I couldn't wait till the chocolate harden to try one.  Happy with the results though.  I will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe to a T and these are SO yummy!! Fit into a 13x9 pan perfectly. While the chocolate was still warm, I took a butter knife and cut through the chocolate lightly so that they were easy to cut after cooled. If you are looking for something different to add to your holiday cookie rotation, try these- you will not be dissappointed!

These are very good.  I am giving 5 stars because out of about 7 different cookies I have made for christmas this year, my family loved these the most.  Honestly, I ate most of them and will be baking another batch today.

Oh, WOW! This is sinfully rich but absolutely delicious. And, so quick and easy! I will be making it every year from now on and my husband has requested that I make these all year long, not just at the holidays.

I used 1.5 times the amounts called for in the recipe, as I felt the amounts given would not fill a 13 X 9 pan. My adjustment worked fine and the slices / bars turned out just wonderfully.

This is very candy-like, in a category with fudge rather than cookies I would say, but still incredibly delicious and has a nice buttery crunch. It was a huge hit with everyone who tasted them. Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful:) I followed the recipe exactly except added some white chocolate chips on top to create a swirl effect. I took the bars to work and they were gone the same day (between 6 women)!! Thanks for a great recipe, this will definately go on a christmas goodie tray!!!
