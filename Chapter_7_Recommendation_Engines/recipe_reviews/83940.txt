This recipe was simple to make, and yummy! I did change it around a little bit by substituting 1 TBSP of Rosemary with  1 TBSP of Basil. Also I put parchment paper on the baking sheet to help eliminate the egg sticking to the sheet.

This is a great recipie. I highly recommend using fresh rosemary. If using dried, use 1/3 less to compensate.

These were good but I recommend using more cheese (I used extra sharp Cheddar for more flavor) and also using scissors to snip the rosemary very finely. Quick and easy to make. Thanks!

I have not yet tried this recipe with parsley or basil, but I would like to comment on the rosemary recipe.  I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried rosemary.  I don’t like dried rosemary, whole, as it is like eating pine needles (I haven’t tried fresh, so I don’t know if that is better).  I tried to chop it finely with a knife, but I had to resort to using a mini coffee grinder to not make such a mess.  I coarsely ground my rosemary so that it still have some larger pieces in it.  Perhaps this allowed the rosemary to be “strong”, but I am not sure.  The point is, THE ROSEMARY WAS REALLY OVER POWERING.  But if you are looking for a change up from the usual biscuits and/or you really like rosemary, it’s not so bad.  I was not able to taste anything BUT the rosemary.  My guests were surprised when I told them there was cheese in the recipe as well.  I could not taste the cheese either.  I think cutting back on the rosemary and experimenting with either ADDING MORE CHEESE or using SHARP CHEESE might help.  Otherwise, the cheese is a waste of money.  I liked that one of the ingredients was sour cream, as this is a nice way to use it up.  I don’t think the egg glaze is needed, as it doesn’t add to flavor AT ALL.  These are also really dry and do not spread well while cooking.  DO FLATTEN a touch to help with cooking (so as to not burn outside before inside is done).  They’re ok, reheated in the microwave, with honey.

Excellent!  Moist, flavorful, and so quick!  Omitted the mustard as I don't like any flavor of mustard and added some finely chopped pepperoni (as it went with the entree' I was serving).  Great recipe!

I didn't actually use fresh herbs, but these were still good. I used both dried rosemary and parsley, as well as fat-free sour cream. I forgot to brush them with the egg, but they still turned out fine. Very easy to throw together.

These biscuts are the BOMB! We loved them.  Very tasty with the mustard and rosemary. Very easy to make. We had them with Beef Stew, and they were VERY delish!

These were easy to make and good for a weeknight dinner.  I did use more cheddar cheese which I think was good.  Chopped up the rosemary as fine as I could.  Use a big cookie scoop to scoop the muffins onto the baking pan.  They looked good, tasted great and I will make again.

Pretty tasty. I added some garlic powder. Also, brushed on melted butter on top of each biscuit.

These were really good. I used more cheese-extra sharp cheddar- and added a bit of garlic powder. Then I brushed the tops with melted butter (yum)instead of egg and sprinkled with a very small amount of garlic salt. They needed a little bit of milk in order to not be dry. These were great for dinner, but even better the next morning for breakfast. My boyfriend said they were good enough to sell and he is a pretty discerning eater. The fresh rosemary is great-I read that some people thought it was overpowering, but that may possibly be contributed to using the dried herb as opposed to the fresh.

These are great!  I followed the recipe to a "tee," using fresh rosemary.  I love the tangyness from the sour cream and mustard.  A very unique and tasty biscuit!  Try it!

Very good, but slightly over baked at 12 minutes . I also added 1 cup of shredded old cheddar.  Will definitely make again.

I used thyme (realized at the last minute I didn't have rosemary, SAD!), a bit more sour cream, a full cup of cheddar because we love cheese, and a bit more milk because it looked dry.  Also sprinkled the tops of the biscuits with extra cheddar instead of the egg wash.  The result was really good!  Very soft and tender, herby and the cheese on top was the perfect touch.  Some other reviewers complained of dry biscuits and I think the extra sour cream, cheese, and milk stopped that from being an issue with my biscuits.  Perfect with Easter dinner and will definitely be made again and again.  I'd love to try it with homemade baking mix.

Made this at the last second. They weren't bad for quick biscuits. I added a teaspon of minced garlic to the wet ingrediants and I think this made them taste even better.

Not big on rosemary so I subbed with parsley. Added garlic and onion powders and did not use the egg. They were awesome and went nicely with our stew. Thank you!

These were wonderful but I had to make a substitution. I found I was out of sour cream as I was mixing these up. But I did have some whipped cream cheese with chives. Added a 1/4 cup of egg substitute to the wet ingredients because biscuits tend to be very dry. Brushed some on the top too. Came out moist and yummy. Going to use the leftover biscuits tomorrow morning with low fat country cream gravy.

These were just okay.  They turned out a little on the dry side and didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.

This was an alright biscuit. I needed more liquid then it called for and wasn't a fan of the mustard flavour. However, with a few changes it would be great. I will try this again without mustard and more liquid added. Can be versatile with the herbs I bet.

Meh.  Not my favorite.  Tasted dry and I even used twice the cheese, missing *something* just not sure what.  The family like them though.  I'll keep looking.

My boys don't like rosemary very much so I reduced the amount to about 1/2 teaspoon and it turned out well.  I needed to add a dash of milk to make the dough come out right.  I love the hint of mustard in these.  Next time I will make them for breakfast and put sausage patties in them!  Great recipe; thanks!
