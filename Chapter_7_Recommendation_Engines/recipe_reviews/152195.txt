These were wonderful.  I divided the mixture into 3 parts; one orange, to which I added 1 T of triple sec; one almond, with 1 T of cream de almond and 1/2 tsp of almond extract; and one mocha, with 1 T Kalua and 1/2 tsp instant coffee.  I decorated the tops to indicate the flavor; chocolate jimmies for the mocha, slivered almonds for the almond and orange zest mixed with large sugar crystals for the orange.  These were a big hit at holiday party.

Simple, very good, fun to make.  Lends itself to all kinds of variations including using dark chocolate on the outside or inside.  I used a German Chocolate Bar for the outer chocolate coating and added just a bit of corn syrup to make it even better for dipping.  Turned out great when rolled in crushed almonds or crushed peppermint.

I found this recipe in a holiday magazine years ago and I have been making them EVERY year since!!  Huge hit at parties.  I like to dip them in milk Chocole and then roll them in Girardelli Cocoa Powder...YUMMY!!!  I have put raspberry jam in the center, added mint exract to the mixture, Hazel nuts;  There is no limit to the combinations of flavors!!!  The best part is they are SO easy to make!!

Very good! I was impressed by how easy and scrumptious these are. Also, I dipped some in white chocolate for an eye-catching contrast. YUM

This was a fail!  My truffles didn't come out so great and they wouldn't get hard enough to form nicely.  They tasted nice (hence the 3 stars), but my family was trying to guess their forms (alien spaceship, easter egg, etc) and that was a bit harsh.

These *are* Simply Sensational.  They're time consuming, but very easy to make.  You may find, as I did, that the consistency is like firm pudding unless you chill them long enough (more than an hour in the refrigerator is a must).  What I do when it's time to chill them is to put them in the freezer (in a stainless steel bowl) for about 30-40 minutes, or until just firm enough to use a small ice-cream scoop/melon baller.  Once on the baking sheet, I freeze for about another 30 minutes to make them easy to work with.  Work quickly.  It's impossible to work with them at room temperature.  I also dipped them in melted dark chocolate (60% Ghiradelli works well).  When it cools, it makes a hard crunchy outside that goes really well with the creamy inside.  While the chocolate was still a bit tacky, I rolled some in powdered peppermint candies, some in powdered almonds, and some in powdered creme de menthe.  They were absolutely divine, and look very impressive.

Make sure you refrigerate - it makes them much easier to work with. When it's time to dip in the chocolate, I use colored toothpicks to help control the mess.

These were pretty good... My mom and I made them. However, they had a cheese cake taste due to the cream cheese. I'm not a very big cheese cake fan... so I didn't LOVE these. But if you're a cheese cake fan, then these are the truffles for you!

Excellent, first rate recipe!!  I divided into 3 sections and put 1T Kahlua in one, 1T Bailey's in another and 1/4 t peppermint flavoring in the last.  I used german chocolate for the outer layer.  It really helped, as another poster suggested, to use toothpicks when dipping and placing on pan or in paper cups.

What's not to love about this?? It's cream cheese and chocolate :) I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully. I didn't have that hard of a time shaping them, I let them hang out in the frig a good couple of hours before I tackled the job of shaping them into balls and then I let them hang out again before I dipped them. Sooo good :)

This was AWESOME! I added 2 tsp of pumpkin spice, and a tsp of cinnamon, I can't wait to try other flavors and chocolates with this. I made the balls, slightly bigger than suggested.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because 2 1/2 stars arent available. The response to these was very mixed. Either they really liked them or they really disliked them. I personally didnt care for them. The cream cheese in these in my opinion was way to strong. I dont think i will be making these again.

These are out of sight.  Yes, they will make a mess of your hands but who cares?  That good.  The cream cheese and chocolate make a very good "cheat" for truffle filling.  And they say any real chocolate fan will not eat anything but semi or bittersweet...and I agree.  Don't make subs, embrace the flavor of pure chocolate!  (although I've had the white chocolate oreo ones and they are very good too--supersweet but good).  anyway, I followed this recipe to a tee and decorated with christmas colored non pareil sprinkles and dropped them in a mini muffin liner to serve.  Pretty presentation and I was lucky to grab the last one at the party.  one note--you can roll them small, the chocolate coating adds a lot of volume.

i made these with 2 bags of mint chocolate chips that still equalled 20 oz. i froze the mixture and shaped into balls which i flattened between wax papers with a coffee cup. i dipped them into melted chocolate.. the first came out pretty, but unless i was willing to dirty about 20 forks i need to find a better way! it got too gloopy and hard to manage. i think i will try candy molds next time. i plan on melting chocolate and lining the mold, chilling, adding the filling, and then capping that off with more chocolate. i figure if i briefly chill that in the freezer, they should pop out nicely! THEY TASTE AWESOME BY THE WAY!! also next time - i will try PB chips for the filling. i can't wait to attempt them again! my head buzzes with new flavor ideas!

I found this recipe in a magazine ad.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 because the exact recipe (to me) isnt worth 5 starts....My version is slightly different.  Instead of the bakers chocolate, i use 12 oz of  milk chocolate (chocolate chips) melted for the center, as I prefer the milk chocolate flavor for the center.  For the outside I use candy quick candy coating or semi sweet chocolate (same amount as this recipe calls for).  I like the two chocolate flavors better than just the single flavor.  I also prefer them plain, not topped or coated with any nuts or candies.  As for preperation, I do it otherwise pretty much the same.  I made these last year for christmas and EVERYONE loved them.  My mom had to hide some in the freezer so all her grandkids didnt eat them after they all had their own!!  My baby niece even loved the eating the creamy center.

This is a recipe that you will get messy, if you know that going in then this is a recipe for you. VERY VERY good. VERY easy to put together too. They freeze well as I tried that out to see.  i decorated with peppermint sprinkles, m & m sprinkles and Oreo sprinkles. I also rolled them up smaller then what was suggested since they are a rich treat eat plus you can get a lot more out of it that way. Once I dipped them in the chocolate I place into a mini cup cake paper liner this way when I give out as gifts they won't make a mess and it will look like I am an even better cook! :) LOVE THIS DISH!

I accidentally bought unsweetened chocolate when making this recipe, and so I added two cups of powdered sugar and several tablespoons of kahlua. I don't know how the original version was, but mine was freaking delicious.

Great and simple recipe! I made these for my friends for Christmas. I substituted some of the cream cheese for raspberry jam. It added great flavor but it does cause the set up time to increase. Instead of hand dipping them, I rolled them and placed them in my paper liners, then carefully spooned melted chocolate over it. I will make these again next Christmas!

A little too rich, you need a glass of eggnog or milk with these. It was extremely easy to do, a little messy though. I sprinkled them with cocoa powder for extra decoration and flavor. I brought them to work, and people were impressed with my mad baking skills (I didn't tell them how easy it was!).

Very good and easy.  However very messy.  These are so rich you can't eat more than 1 at a time.  tastes like a piece of chocolate cheesecake.  Next time I would use 2 packages of cream cheese and 8 oz. melted chocolate  to cut down on the sweetness.  Great with coffee or milk but you need something.

Fantastic!  I put 1 T of bailey's in one batch and 1 T in the second batch.  Delish!  I also melted a half a block of paraffin in with the coating (12 squares of choc) and that generously coated a double batch. Also with the paraffin, you don't have to worry about the chocolate getting soft.  Enjoy!

I made these tonight.  I let my kids have the extra uncoated ones and they loved them.  I think I will make a few and just roll them in graham cracker crumbs insted of dipping them in chocolate.  That was a big mess and aggravating since I could not get my chocolate tempered.

I made this with 1/2 fat free cream cheese and 1/2 neufchantel.  Next time I make them I think I'll add about 1 cup of powdered sugar in order for them to stick together better and become a bit sweeter.  I'm not really into bittersweet chocolate.  I did coat them with white almond bark so that added a lot of sweetness that helped.

Also...I forgot to mention...I placed the truffle batter into the fridge in the evening and scooped them out the next morning with a small cookie scoop.  Also found that if I rolled only a few at a time in my hands, then washed hands when chocolate started caking onto my hands, I had better luck with rolling them into circles.

They taste wonderful I added 2 tsp of mint extract and coated them in white chocolate with peppermint sprinkles (festive colors)  I have never made truffles and have NO idea how to coat them and make them look pretty! I skewered them on kabob sticks and coated them then spinning/dripping off the excess chocolate but getting them off I always left a mark in the chocolate and had to do touch ups. Any suggestions?

Maybe I'm inept, but this recipe was nothing but a huge mess.  They were good, but it was really hard to cover the centers with chocolate without getting it all over the counter and my fingers.  I think I'll pass on making these again.

Not bad. Can really taste the cream cheese instead of a "truffle" taste. Everyone else really liked them though!
