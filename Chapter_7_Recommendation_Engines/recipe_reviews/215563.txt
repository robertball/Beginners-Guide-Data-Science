My carnivores loved this one.  I didn't make it exactly the same..omitted the croutons and used a bit more chicken and added some basil, garlic powder, onion powder and chipotle chili powder.  I also didn't cook with gravy on the uncooked rolls.  Made gravy in saucepan and served as  a dip for the finished rolls.  My husband said it's a keeper for sure.

I made these and found them a little bland.  Also thinking they might be good made with puff pastry instead of crescent rolls.  I'm going to experiment with this recipe; will keep you all posted!

My boyfriend loved this and he said it was one of my masterpieces. :) I omitted making the gravy. I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used a fresh lemon and squeezed the juice. Good thing I saved this recipe in my recipe box right after I watched allrecipes.tv What's cookin?! ;)

Made this last night...it was delicious! I used Neufchatel, fresh chives and bread crumbs because I didn't have croutons. It was really delicious and the gravy was awesome as well. Next time I think I'll try to sneak some veggies in...maybe broccoli, asparagus or peas!

These were so good. I used reduced fat cream cheese and fresh chives and left out the mushrooms for the kids and hubby. They were so easy to prepare and took no time at all. Thanks for the recipe!

These were ok.  The dipping sauce does not seem to match the flavors of the inside of the roll.  The kids didn't love them, I think it is a little too rich for a kids taste.  It was fun to try something different.

Very good!  Took the advise of a previous reviewer and used puff pastry instead.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken and did not make the gravy nor did I roll in the crumbs.

I made this recipie on Saturday and it was an easy put together and truly great, the only thing I did diffrent was that I didn't have cream cheese didnt want to run out to get it so I used maynaise instead, and used some Ms Dash yellow top about 2 teaspoons measured in the palm of my hand, WOW it was moist and had a great taste!  My husband loved them, I will make them again and take a picture the next time because they are nice to see!

This was delicious, but did have to add to bake time. I also did not use the croutons and the gravy was SUPERB! I will definitely be making this again for my family.

Fast, easy recipe. Contains a lot of easy to find ingredients and tastes great. If I were to repeat this recipe I would probably substitute the crescent roll dough for puff pastry (as suggested by another user). Crescent rolls have a very identifiable taste which I couldn't overlook when eating. Great taste, for so few ingredients-will make again!

This was just amazing!  I did not make the gravy as I thought it would be yummy without and I was right.  Omitted the butter on the crescent roll as well.  Not needed at all.  Only 1 cup of croutons is needed. Thanks!
