I have been making this salad for years.  First found it on the back of Golden Grain macaroni package.  My family loved it.  It has been a hit at potlucks and barbeques over the years.  My son's most requested dish.  As I reviewed the recipe I found a couple of discrepancies.  First the macaroni was a 16 oz.package.  Second  it called for 1 cup of marinara sauce.  At the time the recipe appeared on the package Golden Grain had an 8 oz. Can of marinara sauce on the market.

It was delicious.  Everyone at work loved it and several asked for the recipe.  I think it tastes better the longer it is refrigerated!  Yummy!

I agree with "DOLLAR SHORT" about the ingredients in the salad. However, I remember the salad recipe on the back of a 'Salad Macaroni' not 'Elbow Macaroni'. The salad is delicious!!!

I believe this salad was originally introduced on the Golden Grain mac salad pasta package a million years ago :).  My mother made it for us as kids and we never let he make any other kind.  However, the recipe called for chopped black olives. It's the only mac salad I make and now my daughter makes it as well. It's kind of a family tradition. It's the hit of every pot luck and every BBQ.

This salad is delicious.  This is a big hit at potlucks or other gatherings.  Most people prefer it to traditional macaroni salad.  While it's not exactly barbecue flavor, I couldn't think of a better name for it.  If you are having doubts, please at least try this recipe.  From the ingredients list, it seems strange, but it actually has a remarkably good flavor.

Edible, yes. But, for us, it just doesn't GO together. Too much dressing, too much relish,  & the flavors just don't meld together. In the recipes defense, I had 1 out of 6 that liked it.

Used 1 cup marinara as well with Farelle Pasta and Ring Pasta.  Used less than called for relish. Pretty good!
