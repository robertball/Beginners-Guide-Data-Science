This recipe is very similar to the one my Mormor taught my mom, and I've been making these now for a little over 50 years!  This calls for one less egg, a little more flour, half the sugar---but it's basically the same.  I tried to make it with just one tablespoon batter on my cast iron griddle, but I had better luck with two tablespoons.  I've never used butter on the griddle, so it took me a little getting used to (I usually give a very light brushover of Crisco).  My granddaughters thought these were a little more "cushiony" but still very good (they passed the big test!!)!  Powdered sugar, granulated sugar, or lingonberry jam are the traditional ways I know of how to serve Swedish pancakes, but we still prefer a little jam with sour cream in the middle with a smidgen of syrup on the rolled up top!  My four Swedish grandparents would be proud that their tradition has carried on!  Thanks for posting your recipe, Amber!

Deliciously sweet and easy to make!!! I paired the pancakes with a fresh lemon syrup. Just add fresh lemon juice and sugar together over the stove on low an lightly drizzle for an extra fresh kick!

When I was a girl, I sat in the kitchen with my Swedish grandpa and watched him make these. When I needed a recipe while sitting with him he just said, "oh put a few eggs, a sprinkle of flour, some baking powder, a little sugar,  and there ya go .... Thanks Papa, but this recipe here actually spells it out and it tastes pretty close to yours. Cat in Seattle

It turned out really good. My nieces, ages 12, 9 and 7 are completely different, one filled with BlackBerry jelly, one with nutella and one with marshmallow cream. Rolled them up like crepes  and took them to school for snacks. A great easy recipe for young cooks to make and share with friends.

I made this recipe using vegan butter and lactose-free milk. the consistency was liquidy (as I've heard it's suppose to be). I used a little vegan butter on the pan and for 2 servings I used just 1 egg white. The Pancake cooked fast and flipping it was no trouble. The taste, texture, and thiness are fantastic for any dairy allergens this recipe is perfect.

Not my preferred variation Swedish pancakes  but they turned out ok and would probably pair well with lingon och powdered sugar. I felt the recipe could use butter within the mix and that these turned out a bit on the hard side rather than soft.

The only difference I made to this recipe was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract, which I was taught from my father by his mother (my grandmother) from Sweden.

Very easy. Made as is. Keep in mind, as they are (plain) they aren't much... you need to add toppings to enhance them, much like traditional pancakes. We usually add butter with leftover cranberry sauce (from a previous turkey dinner). red currant jam or, if we can find it, lingonberry preserves. We also top it with fresh fruit - various berries in season, peaches, bananas, etc.   We've been experimenting using them with savory toppings, using leftover pancakes for lunch and dinner. It's hard to go wrong since it's just a good, basic pancake. I've even made a bunch on a camping trip where we were acting as 'trail angels' to backpackers hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, making them breakfast as they passed by. Man, can those kids eat! but the best part is that many of them asked for extra pancakes so they could take with them for lunch. Apparently, they all love to use them with peanut or almond butter. Keeping this in mind, I made the batter in large batches ahead of time at home, and we cooked them on site. Worked really well because everyone could pick and choose the toppings they wanted.

We get Sweedish pancakes from our local pancake house. My kids were fighting over the leftovers one night so I found this recipe. My husband said they are amazing! They are a staple in our house now

I liked it but hubby did't.   Said they didn't look done.
Going to try it again with a bit more cooking, flour & salt &1/2 tsp vanilla.  
I made them into crepes with apple pie filling from a can and jazzed it up with more pie spices.  
Makes lovely crepes,  just not a "man's" dish apparently.

I made it just as the recipe said, except I used whole wheat flour.  It seemed quite runny when I put it in the pan, but after it cooked a little, it was just perfect!  My husband and I both LOVED it!!

Really  good. I made them as popovers, in large muffin tins. Delish!
