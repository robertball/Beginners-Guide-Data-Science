I thought this was a great quick base recipe. I made it as specified, but used a can of diced tomatoes with habaneros. After I tasted the finished product, I added a bit more salt, a bit of hot sauce, and some garlic and onion powder and a couple sprays of faux butter spray to keep it moist and it was a nice accompaniment to our tacos.

This was very good! I only had boil a bag brown rice, so I had to use that. I just boiled it in water like the box said to, then I brought the can of diced tomatoes (mine had jalapenos instead of green chiles) almost to a boil with some diced onion and green pepper ( I always add that to my spanish or mexican rice) and then added the bag of rice. Turned out delish! Will be making this way from now on!

This was great for a base recipe and very similar to my white rice version. I followed the instructions the first time and it seemed a little bland. Next time, I will combine my two recipes and add 1 t. chili powder, 1 t. cumin, and a little more salt (approx. 1/2 t.).

Made this recipe yesterday, but I had to double it because I make a weeks worth of meals ahead of time. So yummy! That being said, after an hour of simmering the rice, it still had a hint of crunch to it but the chicken broth was all evaporated/soaked up. Next time I will try adding about 4 more ounces of broth and simmering a bit longer. Really love the flavor though! And that the recipe uses brown rice - finally!!!!

Wanted to use brown rice to make a Mexican side dish so started with this.  I only had plain canned tomatoes so saut√©ed a jalepeno and garlic clove before adding them and chicken stock.  I also added a teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of good chili powder to kick it up a notch ~ delicious!  Thanks for a great basic recipe.

This is a nice easy recipe to follow. But next time I will reduce the 1 teas. salt to 1/2 teas. and see if that helps. Otherwise it would have been great.

Really very good. Takes an hour to to cook, which is a long time, but what are you going to do - it's brown rice. Certainly not the best Spanish rice I've ever had, but it's simple and tasty. As long as you can plan ahead for the time it takes, it's a great way to eat brown rice for a weekday meal.
