I made this for a party with a number of vegetarians in attendance.  I made a few changes.  I left out the lettuce and only used one bucnch of green onions.  I added black beans (one can rinsed and drained) and pre-made guacomole.  I topped my layered dip with diced canned jalapenos and a big spoon full of sour cream in the center.  Everyone, even the non-vegetarians, loved it and came back for more.  I have had repeated requests to bring this to numerous events.

I was looking for something to bring to a small family getogether and I found this recipe. I was nervous about it but once I made it, my family especially my kids loved it. I had to hide it to keep them from eating it. Everyone else loved it too. It was easy and meatfree which is great for being outside for a long time without worrying about any spoilage. I will definately make this again.

This taco dip is awesome.  My best friend made this recipe for us at Thanksgiving dinner and I couldn't believe it tasted so good without having any meat (I had no idea it wasn't meat!).  It was gone in about 20 minutes.  I'm making it for my Christmas dinner!

I skipped the green onions (don't like) and didn't have the black olives (but they would have been great!) and subbed sour cream for cottage cheese. This was really good! A very thick, hearty dip that worked well with tortilla chips and also used as an accompaniment to black beans in burritos - yumm!! Would add more of the veggies and some salsa next time. :) (Also I halved the recipe and still had a full pie plate sized dish!)

It turned out beautiful, but the taste was not for me. I wont use this recipe again, but I will make it without the taco seasoning, swap the cottage for sour cream, layer chunky salsa on top, and the veggies on top of that... this is a HIT for my family, I hope others had better reviews than I did for this one- Happy Cooking!

I love this recipe after a few changes.  Added a layer of refried beans, swapped the cottage cheese to sour cream, left out the lemon juice and used fresh spinach instead of lettuce.  My family loves it and we make it often.

Make this all the time!  Especially for my diabetic father-in-law, who shouldn't have the high carbs in beans.  I take this also to potlucks and it always ends up gone!  I have made it enough times that I know if by heart and can throw it together in 10 min.  :)  I don't use but one bunch of green onions.  As far as the lettuce I buy a small bag of the shredded lettuce and it's about right.

Fantastic! I used salsa in place of the tomatoes and used cream cheese in place of cottage cheese. Put a few black olives on top, because my hubby doesn't eat them. Wonderful...

I give it 4 starts because I make it a little different- but every time I make it - it is a huge hit!
I use 8 oz of sour cream rather than cottage cheese and omit the lettuce (it can get soggy) and I omit the lemon juice.
you can add other toppings too like cilatnro, diced red pepper, tomato....

I've been making this recipe for 30+ years and always get raves and requests for a copy (came from an old Philly Brand Cream Cheese recipe book). I follow the original recipe: cream cheese, 1 c. cottage cheese, sour cream, taco seasoning pkg, lettuce (chopped up small so that it doesn't dangle from the chip), onion (yellow or green, whatevah ya like!), chopped tomatoes (I don't include the watery goop cuz it makes the topping get watery; and chop these small too), finely shredded cheese (do yourself a favor and just buy the shredded stuff); and black olives (too many people don't like black olives, so unfortunately I rarely include them). Serve with AUTHENTIC TACO CHIPS! Really, it's much better with them! HINTS: bring the cream cheese to room temp first; add the seasoning into the sour cream, THEN combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and cottage cheese...they mix together much easier. AND make this goop up at least 4 hours before or the DAY before serving (that's what I do) as the seasoning tastes much better after marinating. As well, I do the chopping of everything the day before--except the lettuce (I'll chop the lettuce the day of so that it doesn't turn brown). It's a wonder I'm still single with this recipe!! :+D

I used to make this all the time, and am happy that I found the recipe again.  Will also add cooked ground beef to the creamy mixture.  Yum-O!

I wanted a little snack this evening for me and the boyfriend and this hit the spot and we had enough left for lunch tomorrow.  I did leave out the black olives simply because I don't care much for them .

Don't double it like I did. The seven layer taco dip was a big hit. Didn't need the plan taco dip. Love by all !

I followed some of the other reviewers and substituted sour cream for the cottage cheese and this turned out great. Otherwise, followed this as written. Would definitely make this again!
