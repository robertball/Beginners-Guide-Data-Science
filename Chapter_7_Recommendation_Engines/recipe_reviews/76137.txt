Delicious and easy soup. Great for vegetarians, like me, when you use vegetable broth. Two suggestions: If you are a lemon lover like me, squeezing a wedge of lemon into your soup or floating a lemon slice on top a=can make a good thing even better. Also, if you aren't going to use all the soup at once, instead of putting the spinch into the pot with the rest of the soup, just put a portion into the bottom of the bowl and pur your hot soup on top. Spinach cooks pretty well instantly, and you will be saved from having slimy spinch leaves when you reheat the leftovers. Thanks for the great recipe.

Our soup prepared as per recipe was very bland! My wife however rescued it by adding crushed tomatoes and green chili peppers ...one 28oz can of tomatoes and one 4 oz can of green chilies.....that did the trick and we are enjoying the result...now ****

Great recipe!  I modified the recipe with one can of beans, a 10 oz package of frozen spinach, and three leeks.  Two cans of beans was overwhelming, and I don't usually have fresh spinach on hand.  Also, I put everything in a slow cooker on high for about four or five hours and served it with grated Parmesan cheese and a slice of bread.

I've made this soup many times and it always turns out great. I do add an extra can of chicken broth which keeps it from getting too thick.

Wonderful recipe! I went with what was suggested by other reviewers and substituted the cumin for rosemary and thyme and left out the couscous. I also substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth as a personal preference. This has become a quick favorite of mine - cheap, easy, healthy, and vegetarian. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

my husband and i are definitely NOT vegetarians, but we were both sick and i needed to make something out of what i had on hand.  we were suprised to find that this soup really hit the spot.  we had slices of crusty bread and butter on the side and it was a perfect light dinner.  my husband thought it needed more broth because the couscous does soak up some liquid, but i kind of liked it the way it was.  i ended up adding more chicken broth for his sake :)  also didn't use the whole amount of cumin.

very good. I used rosemary and thyme instead of cumin for a different flavor. I also used the entire leek, not just the bulb.

YUMMY!  I messed up and added a BOX of couscous and it turned out like a side dish--a very delicious side dish.  Then I added more broth and made it into a soup and it was still good.
I also used frozen spinach and it worked well.  Anyone having issues with flavor may be using a poor broth.  I use Better Than Bouillon Veggie and it is great

For those not used to cooking with leeks, the key to getting that great flavor and aroma is using a good olive oil and then cooking the leeks in it rather slowly. I really take my time with the leeks, letting them develop flavor without burning. You might not want to add the garlic at the beginning as it might get over done. Also, use plenty of the green parts. Just save the tougher outer part for stock. Much of the inner green is soft and delicious, and adds a lot of flavor.  Potatoes go well with leeks if you don't have couscous. If you want more flavor, two things that go well are rosemary and sage. I like to make rosemary olive oil for use with leek dishes. Just heat fresh rosemary sprigs in good olive oil over very low heat for a long time, until the leaves turn crunchy but not burnt (think deep frying over a course of an hour or so.)

This soup is quick to make and wonderful.  My husband and I enjoyed it with a green salad and hot, crusty bread.   I didn't make any changes to this aside from using low-sodium chicken broth.  It's delicious as left-overs too!

I love this soup.  I've been making it for ages and really should have reviewed it before now.

I found it delicately flavoured, nourishing and so healthy.  I used quinoa instead of cous cous and it works really well.  Thanks for this lovely recipe.

fantastic mix of flavors & textures! we were working late so i made a slow cooker version: same ingredients except frozen spinach instead of fresh, dry beans, dry rice instead of couscous, and lots more chicken broth - just put everything in the crockpot on low in the morning and come home to a fantastic dinner, ready to go. makes a full, hearty meal with sausage on the side.

Well thank you very much for an excellent dinner everyone! I followed the recipe with the following changes suggested by other reviewers: - fry the cumin with the garlic it really helps release the flavor of the spice - add the juice of one lemon to help give it a little sweetness and counter the spiciness of the cumin - not too much cous-cous or it becomes a sidedish - add the spinach towards the end so it doesn't become too wilted  I served this with open faced grilled tomato baguette sandwiches and the entire meal was a hit with my 16 year old son.  Merci!

We really liked this.  I made the recipe as is and didn't feel it was bland at all.  Didn't even add a pinch of salt.  Next time, though, I will add an extra cup or two of broth.

A really good, simple soup. I initially wanted to try it with kale, but the grocery store was out, so I used 1 overflowing cup of frozen chopped spinach. I left out the bay leaf, cumin and couscous because it seemed like any additional herbs or spices would override the flavors of the main ingredients. So my only seasoning was the garlic, vegetable bouillon cube (we use Rapunzel brand, it's great for everything) and pepper, although I did add 1/3 can of evaporated milk left over from another dish for a filling consistency. In short, if you're in the mood for something with a bit more variety, skip this recipe and just make minestrone or vegetable-bean soup... although basic flavors can also be just as satisfying!

The soup was bland and kindof boring so I had to add 3 more garlic cloves and fresh parsley in the last minute.  Very healthy alternative to most rich soups.

This is a great soup!!  I changed the recipe a bit:  added some carrots, had no spinach so substituted chard, used vege broth instead of chicken, and added extra garlic.  Definitely needs more broth/water than called for.  Thanks for sharing!!

Instead of cumin, I used 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning. Also used 1 box of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry; added it just before serving.  Did not have couscous however the same amount of orzo worked out well.  You can add up to 2 cans more of broth . . . just depends on how thick you want it.  The flavor is wonderful!  Worth repeating many times in the cold winter.

I was a little disappointed-I followed the recipe (with the exception of adding extra broth-totally needed), but found the cumin to have overpowered the other ingredients.  Rosemary and/or thyme are better suited for this soup's delicate ingredients.  It's definitely a great base to build on, which is why I still gave it three stars.

Refreshing light flavor and filling. I make soups as a way to have dinner then lunch for the rest of the week and this fit the bill. I held the spinach and added it before I reheated each serving. It's also good with a dollop of sour cream.

Found this via an ingredient search when I was looking for something I could make quickly. This soup is so easy and fast and versatile! I love spinach, but I didn't have any so I used kale--I just added it shortly after the beans since it takes longer to cook. It held up really well and turned out delicious. I imagine that chard or some other green would work well too. Also, navy beans are good if you don't have cannellini. I'll be making this again!

A great way to make a soup with leeks as an alternative to a heavy potato leek soup.  Light and filling.  I followed the directions as stated, ended up adding about 8 oz extra water.  I did use more than just the white of the leek- about 5" higher to include some of the greens. For best flavor, use a good quality chicken stock- not just boullon or canned "chicken broth" --it will be more expensive but gives soups a much richer flavor.

This was both tasty and healthy.  I made it to use up some left over fresh spinach and thought it was good, although not overly flavourful.  It seems to have minimal leftover value as the couscous soaks up the water and the spinach becomes soggy, but the recipe points out to serve it immediately.

This was reallly good, and I felt so healthy eating it. I ended up using more chicken broth because mine looked really thick, but that was an easy fix. Also, I added a little more spice to mine with chilli powder. So easy to add whatever spices you like. I will definitely be making this again.

My family LOVES this recipe.  We use wheat couscous in our soups often.  It's also good with sausage links, grilled and sliced, in the soup.

Really good. I used better than bouillon veggie base and quinoa instead of couscous. Could have left the grain out without harming the soup. I used whole bag of spinach. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly except I threw in some turkey bacon at the end.  Next time I'm going to throw in some crumbled turkey sausage and triple the spinach.  This was so delicious.

Loved this soup.  It was delicious.  I added an extra can of chicken broth as others suggested and also used the full amount of cumin.  YUM

This is a four star recipe with potential to be five stars.  I used orzo instead of couscous because I like the texture better.  I agree with other raters that there are too many cannelli beans in this.  A five star version of this soup is less cannelli beans and more orzo/couscous.  As suggested by some raters, I used rosemary/thyme/sage instead of cumin.  I also added mushrooms and more garlic.  This combination may be the best soup I have ever made...

This is a good soup, although my family agreed that was bland.  Next time I will try adding feta cheese as a garnish and increasing the cumin by atleast double. I will also decrease the couscous by half -it really absorbed most of the liquid and that may be why it was bland? Just as it was the pot was emptied.  It left us feeling full and nourished.

This recipe was very good and very simple. I did make a few changes: I used most of the leek, not just the white base, I added one more garlic clove and 1 cup more broth. and as suggested I substitute rosemary and thyme for cumin and put the spinach in the individual bowls so that my left over soup didn't have slimy spinach the next day. Because I used most of the leek, I used 3 instead of four since using more of the leek increased the amount of leek in the soup.

EXCELLENT!  This is such a fabulous, hearty and rich soup without all the cream of other recipes.  I followed the ingredients exactly with 2 changes; a little secret i learned from cooking indian food--i added the cumin and bay leaf to the leek/garlic and sauteed altogether to release the flavour and i cooked the beans for awhile in the soup prior to adding spinach.  Using my wooden spoon, after about 30 minutes i crushed half of the beans to add to the thickness.  I really recommend this recipe.

this soup was delicious!  although I did tweak it a little bit.  I prefer vegetable broth to meat broth and also I skipped the couscous completely and used about 2 cups of cooked turkey instead.  this will definately become a staple in my house

A simple but belly warming soup.  It did need a few changes to suit our tastes.  I had to double the amount of liquid in it in order for it to be a soup.  I also used frozen spinach because I didn't have fresh, unfortunately.  I also used 5 gloves of garlic as recommended by other reviewers.  We like things spicy so I added a little cayene pepper too.  I will definitely make this again as my husband loves it.  Thanks

In Hungary(Europe) we do not use so much canned food- so I cooked the white bean (in chicken soup with bay leaves and garlic). Also in Hungary bean soup is usually heavy with smoked ham. But it looked so good and turned out delicious, my family loved it!

I used homemade organic chicken broth which gave great flavour and nutrition.  Also substituted thyme and dill for the cumin as cumin just didn't seem to go.  It was quite good!

This was pretty good but it's not something I'd crave or make again necessarily. I followed the recipe exactly.  Once dished up, I added some crushed red pepper to mine. I also think it would be good with some Parmesan cheese or bacon.

Super easy and super delicious.  Skipped the couscous.  Put spinach on bottom of bowl and ladled soup over it--SO GOOD.  Spinach is a necessity.  Salted lightly in bowl.

Super easy to make and pretty tasty. I will agree it was a little bland at first bite but add a little more salt, pepper and some Parmesan and you're good to go. Could not find whole wheat couscous so I used regular. I will also agree it wasn't really a soup, would definitely need more chicken broth for that. I did not add more though, I liked it as it was. Super healthy and quick to make, will make it again.

use good broth!!! if the broth tastes good hot without any thing in it, then the soup will taste good. if it tastes like slightly flavored water.......you get the picture. Quinoa (like sugested above) is a good addition, just make sure to rinse well and remember that it takes about 20-30 mins to cook. I cooked some in my rice cooker with broth instead of water, then added it to the soup.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and revved up the 'heat' a bit with 1/2 t. of flaked red peppers. Also used froz. spinach and replaced couscous with quinoa (more fiber). If using quinoa, let it cook in the broth about 15 min. before adding beans. I also added an extra can of LOW SODIUM chicken broth, as we like more of a soup rather stew-like consistency. Used 2 whole leeks. I'd do this again, using onions rather than leeks (as onions are cheaper in my area.) Enjoy!

A wonderful recipe. It was DEE-LISH !!
A very healthy soup.
I added a finely chopped jalapeno, for some kick.
Also a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, it goes good with spinach & leafy greens.
Added a little more chicken stock.
It is also a visually appealing/appetizing soup.
I would recommend it & I am saving the recipe & making it again.

I used vegetable stock and following another reviewers advice, left out the cumin and used rosemary and thyme instead. I wasn't sure whether to add the couscous, but went with it in the end. My daughter was glad I did as she said it thickened it up. I probably used more spinach than suggested as well. This was so quick, easy and enjoyable it's bound to be on the worknight menu again. Thanks

This was very good. I did add about another cup of water to the soup and 2 bouillion cubes for a little more flavor. I also really like Great Nothern Beans, so I subed one of the cans of beans for that. First time using leeks and I loved it. My husband doesn't like this kind of stuff in general (a real meat and potatoes kind of guy) but he enjoyed.

Very good, easy, and filling.  I see that some people thought it bland.  I used garlic couscous, as it was what I had on hand, and this made the soup very flavorful.  Garlic is always a good addition, if you ask me!

I was looking for a way to use some fresh spinach in soup other than the cream variety when I came across this recipe. The combination seemed a little unusual, but I like all the ingredients so I tried it and it was DELICIOUS. My carnivorous hubby loved it and commented on how filling it was. We both love leeks so this was a great new way to try them too. 
Next time I will add one more can of chicken broth to make it more soupy. 
I can see why you'd crave this Beth, thanks!

Comforting, tasty, and filling. I used onions because I didn't have any leeks. We ate it with French bread and an olive oil/ vinegar/ black pepper dip.

1)HALF-ed the beans, couscous, and leeks. 2)ADDED a tomato-- next time use more-- and a splash of apple cider vinegar. 3)REPLACED cumin with rosemary and thyme. 4)Waited til heat was off to add spinach. 5)Would have been good with squash or mushrooms.

My roommates and I made this for dinner tonight and we felt it was a little too bland for our tastes. We're thinking about making it again and adding some sausage to add some more flavor. I would definitely recommend this soup if you're looking for a quick and healthy soup recipe!

Good, change of pace. I used the thyme and rosemary like other users. Also I added extra spinach and left out the couscous. Next time I will add mushrooms.

Well, I made the recipe as listed but for the fact that I waited until the end to pour the soup over the spinach in the bowl.  The flavor is quite mild.  I would say this recipe is just okay - clearly healthy and full of nutrition but too mild a flavor for my preference.

Doctored according to my taste (extra garlic, some red pepper flakes, kale and spinach, quinoa).  This is delicious.  I will make this over and over.

I thoroughly enjoyed this soup.  I used a vegetarian chicken broth and, like another review suggested, used some of the green section of the leeks.  I froze some of the soup for later and it did very well.  Easy and good!

Tried this recipe, changed to 4 servings. The soup was simply delicious. A healthy hardy winter meal. I did not have cannellini beans, so I used Great Northern, and 2 chicken bullion cubes. The soup was thicker than I expected, but had a great flavor. This is a keeper.

Oh my goodness, this was one great recipe.  Of course I made a few changes, however the results were excellent.  I used kidney beans, and some navy beans, which are the same as stated in the recipe, omitted the cumin and added Italian seasoning instead.  Enjoyed making it and the result were very enjoyable.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make it often.

Love, love, love this soup!  I've been making it for quite some time now and everyone loves it.  It's healthy and delicious.  I use fresh spinach and add it at the time of serving.  I've used quinoa and couscous and both work great.  This certainly has become a family fav!  Thanks Beth4kids!

I had a lot of leeks so i doubled the garlic and used 3 tsp of cumin. I also added two chicken bullion cubes. I didn't drain/rinse the beens and it was fine. I used 4 cups of spinach. It was delicious.

Enjoyed very much!  Very healthy & easy to make.
We did add more cumin & bay leaves & probably more than a pinch of salt & pepper.  
Used minced garlic, organic vegetable broth, dry cannellini beans I had previously cooked & fresh organic baby spinach & probably closer to 1 or 2 tbsp of olive oil.
Did use 2 cups extra broth as others recommended to make it more like soup - with amount of broth stated here it becomes more of a side dish, not a soup.

I made this last night. I used as much of the leek as possible and used leftover mashed potatoes instead of Quinoa to thicken it up. Didn't have any Quinoa, but after looking up some recipes with it, I look forward to trying it. Very tasty and filling soup! Will make again!

This is good soup!  The key is to use your favorite broth.  We love vegetable bouillon so used 2 Liters water and enough bouillon to make it noticeably salty, plus a can of chopped tomatoes, since we love that in soup.  Frozen spinach works fine.  Just add it before boiling the water.  When the water is boiling, then add the couscous (or little pasta Soup Stars or Orzo), and the spinach will be cooked by the time the pasta is cooked (5-8 minutes.)   I also used less cumin but more garlic.

For a bean soup, this came out pretty good!..simple to whip up, and healthy too!  I think the more I make this recipe I wont need the recipe in front of me to make...I wanted to add more zest to this soup...I think next time I might add another teaspoon of cumin.

Added 2 green chiles (diced) and a few shakes of tobasco for a little extra flavor. I also added a pinch of corn starch to thicken just a little, since I didn't use cous cous. Because of others' comments, I substituted rosemary for cumin. Super easy, inexpensive, and very delicious! Definitely will repeat.

We really enjoyed this soup.  our only addition was one fresh cayenne pepper; cut in half, then removed just before serving.  We also used vegetable stock rather than chicken.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did not have leeks so I substituted a sliced white onion and green onions.  I added 1 1/2 cans diced tomatoes and switched out 1 tsp of italian seasoning instead of the cumin.  I like the broth and added more broth and used only 1 bay leaf.  I thought this soup had a bunch of flavor.  I put the spinach in my bowl then added my soup.  I also left out the cous cous all together to skip the extra carbs.  I would definitely make this again and again.

An excellent, nutritious and filling soup. To make it even healthier, I use baby spinach and double the amount. I also use more than the recommended amount of cumin and add a little celery salt, too. Finally, quinoa works in place of the couscous, or you can omit that part altogether.

I'm not quite sure how my husband will like it, as he is getting home late tonight, but I LOVED THIS! I read several reviews and added frozen instead of fresh spinach, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, a jalapeno pepper (seeds removed), replaced the chicken broth with vegetable, and doubled that. Also doubled the cumin & added salt & pepper to taste.   The basics for this recipe are just fantastic - I usually read the reviews to see what other healthy things I can find to add to it successfully.  The couscous was a great touch - I think I added a bit too much, but the extra broth made up for it. I am SO excited to take this for lunch - and if Hubs doesn't like it, more for me :)

This was a very good and simple soup. I used navy beans instead of the cannellini beans because that is what I had in my pantry. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I am not sure why some reviewers thought it was bland - I thought is was delicious! I guess everyone's tastes are different.  I will be sure to make this soup again!

Wonderfully healthy! Which more than compensates for it's blandness and you just feel so good eating this! I added more leeks and have made this with barley as well. I really enjoyed this soup. It's colorful too. I'll make this again for sure.

The soup smells delicious, looks beautiful and, as my husband said, "tastes alright."  Maybe if we'd used the vegetable stock as recommended it would have been better. The suggestion to add the spinach to each bowl just before serving was a good one!

This soup was wonderful and easy!  As they say in Italy, "Buonissima!"  The only adjustment that I had to make was to add more liquid.  I would say 2 more cups of water makes it go a little bit further, which is a good thing considering that my family devoured it!

I've also tried substituting kale for the spinach, which is EXCELLENT.  It really stands up to the broth base and keeps a nice texture.  Add a little diced tomoatoes for added tasted and color.

This was fair...however, I used onions instead of leeks, added mushrooms, and did not use the couscous (wheat allergy), so I guess I can't really give it a true rating.

This is an excellent vegetarian dish. I made it exactly as directed (next time I will double the broth) except I used fresh canellini beans that I had cooked previously and froze in 16 oz packages and boxed chicken broth instead of canned.

Easy and delicous! Based on other reviews I added the cumin and bay leaves to the onion and garlic, added the beans and cooked for a couple minutes, then added the broth.  I added the spinach to the bowl before serving and it was delish.  Great simple recipe that I will make again and again.

Excellent soup!  I've made this twice now, the first time I followed recipe almost exactly except for the addition of an extra 32 oz box of chicken stock (it would be to thick without it), more garlic, and I used a 10oz box of frozen chopped spinach thawed and drained.  The second time I had to add meat for my carnivorous husband.  I precooked some Italian turkey sausage links, sliced them, and added them at the end.  It was just as wonderful!

Easy and wonderfully flavored.  The couscous does soak up the broth, so I added another 16 ounces to make it more of a soup.  It was well received as a first dish. I placed the spinach in the bowl then added the soup.  By the time it got to the table the spinach was perfect.  I recommend adding it as you go rather then in the pot.

This was a healthy soup recipe! I followed it except using butter beans instead of cannelini beans and veggie broth. After it was made however, it tasted like it needed something extra so we added a salty liquid seasoning we had that hit the spot. Also, I needed to add more broth than the recipe called for because the soup was so thick in the end it was hard to tell it was soup. Overall though, my husband said it was his new favorite soup!

Very simple soup, and family liked it.  My son wasn't too crazy about the taste of the cumin although the rest of us liked it.  I'm going to try this again but with some other seasoning blend to see if he likes it any better.

Absolutely much better than expected.  However, I made several changes to suit our tastes.  I doubled the cumin, added 8 cloves of garlic, used no-chicken stock(vegetarian), added 1c more stock and lastly didn't add the couscous. With these changes, a great soup was the outcome.  I will make this over and over again.

This was good but just a tiny bit bland. I added some red pepper flakes and a lot of salt. It could have used some more seasoning but not sure what exactly (lemon juice, perhaps). But overall, very good.

Excellent quick and easy soup!  I used bulger wheat instead of couscous because that's all I had. Also added a little red wine when sauteing.  Love the cumin flavor.

This was a nice soup. I did make some changes, however. I used only three leeks, 1/2 10 oz. pkg. of frozen spinach, and I added 2 cups of water. I also added a sliced carrot for color and texture. The flavors got better a few days later. I ate it for lunch for several days. It's a good starter soup recipe to add to.

This is a very good soup, but it needs way more broth than what is listed here.  I used 40 oz of chicken broth and next time I will use even more.

This is a staple in our house! I use quinoa instead of couscous, and add extra broth and it's perfection! Thanks!

Nice "pure" soup.  I used swisscard instead of  spinach. I also took  about a cup of the rinsed and drained beans and about a cup of the leek/broth from the pot and pureed in a mini choper and then added it to the pot for a creamy texture.  I left out the "pasta" product of orzo (since I did not have couscous) until the next day to cook when we were ready to serve.

A good idea however too bland, re-seasoned with chipotle power, crushed red Chile and substituted seasoned whole brown rice. Thought about whole tomatoes...next time.

Just made this (my first time ever using leeks so I found it to be very interesting) however I did substitute cream of chicken soup for half of the broth, and added crushed red pepper because as some others noticed, it was a bit bland. Otherwise great!

Delicious every time! So easy and a fam fave. Make sure to get high quality broth- it makes a big difference. Also, if not salted properly, can be a little bland.

Absolutely love this soup. Extra chicken broth and squeeze a lemon slice when serving. Add the spinach per serving so it's fresh upon reheating.

I have made many recipes from this website and love most of them when they are rated so well. This one was bland and not worth the money or time making it. My husband and I are pretty good cooks but we do enjoy a lot of flavor in our dishes and this one failed. Trust me, look up a different recipe if you enjoy flavorful soups.

This was a great soup.  I found myself skeptical, but as soon as I went to eat it (after a fair amount of salting, granted), wow, impressive!  The cumin blends in really nicely, and I loved that there were various textures--the leeks, the spinach, the beans, the couscous.  I felt really full after, and it felt like a healthy full.

excellent flavors since i followed the suggestions to use thyme and rosemary instead of cumin and added spinach to each bowl individually to prevent from getting grossy.  i added parmesan on top and added chopped celery to the leeks because i had some in my refrigerator.  i will use the celery again.  also, next time i will use dry beans.  the canned don't hold up and get mushy.  flavor is still awesome!

Very bland when using vegetable broth. Added some cayenne pepper and lots of salt and pepper  That helped a bit, but still not a lot of flavor. Hoping that the flavors will develop more over the next day or two.

Pretty bland.  If I make it again I'll try a flavored couscous.  I did use frozen spinach and I'm sure that didn't help, but there wasn't much flavor to begin with.

It's actually better if you make the base w/o the spinach a day before then add the spinach when you reheat.  You can also add the light green parts of the leeks as well.

Great vegetarian soup.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken and quinoa for the couscous.  It was a little bland for my friend but he added some Louisiana Hot Sauce and said it was awesome.

Excellent soup for a quck homey dinner.  Found the flavors to be delicate and nicely combined.  Did not add anything to the base recipe. Recomend serving with a strong flavored salad with feta and some herbed or peppery crackers.

Sorry, but this was bland. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't yummy. I'd use some other spice other than cumin. My husband added a 1/2 t of garlic/chili sauce to his serving. However, as the kids and I didn't care for this, he's going to be having this for lunch 3 more times :(

I really liked this soup.  It was quick and easy to make.  I ended up having to add some more chicken broth because the couscous sucked up a lot of the liquid, so next time I will halve the couscous.  Some people have said it is bland, but I disagree.  I added a little pepper at the end, but not a whole lot.  I think the chicken broth gets it salty enough.

I too added the thyme and rosemary rather than the cumin. Once the couscous had a chance to soak up the broth, the spices became overwhelming. I added 2 additional cups of vegetable broth and a can of diced tomatoes. Only then was it semi-enjoyable. Sadly, not one of my top 10 recipes although it has great ingredients. Sorry.

This soup was amazing! I used quinoa instead of couscous, which gave it a very distinct taste. I also added some thyme, tarragon, and a little savory. I barely used cumin, just a sprinkle. The soup had a more savory taste than an ethnic taste. This soup was really very good! So light, simple, healthy, but filling. Definitely will be making this a lot more.

Loved this!  We, too, used the rosemary and thyme in place of the cumin.  Omitted the couscous all together.  I ended up putting a small spoonful of plain greek yogurt in my bowl, which gave it a creamy yet tangy flavor!  So easy and fast - this one will be a keeper.

Really good!  I chopped the spinach slightly so that the pieces weren't too big.

Pretty good soup.  Needed a little salt and pepper to avoid blandness.

This yummy soup has become a staple in our home.  I crave it when the cold weather sets in.  I'll add extra veggies if I have on hand...carrots and mushrooms.  I use quinoa instead of couscous for extra nutrients.  Great soup!!

Love this soup! Hearty, healthy and great leftover. I added another can of stock. I also added red pepper flakes and a dash of paprika to give it more of a kick. Instead of whole wheat cous cous, I used 1 cup (hence the need for more broth) of the Harvest Grains blend from Trader Joe's which has Israeli Cous Cous, Orzo, Baby Garbanzo Beans and Red Quinoa.

This was very good soup.  I did make a few changes.  First, I sweated the leeks and garlic over very low heat in a covered pan with a few hot pepper flakes for a few minutes.  I squeezed the innards out of one fresh Italian sausage, crumbled and browned it and added it with the broth and beans.  I used barley instead of coucous, so I had to simmer the soup for about 30 minutes before adding the spinach.  We really enjoyed this.  Thanks for the post

Very nice! I read reviews and added an extra can of chicken broth. Used great northern beans, a chopped chicken breast, several squeezes of lemon and a dash of red pepper flakes. Loved the couscous. A nice, hearty soup. Oh- also mashed some of the beans against the side of the pot :)

Excellent Soup. I followed the Directions exactly as is and was very happy with the results. If you haven't made it yet, I would suggest following recipe as is before changing anything. The only thing I would change would be in doubling the recipe and freezing some in containers for later.

Excellent!  I also added rosemary, thyme, and the leek stalks.  I also added about 1 can of water as well to offset the couscous.

I followed this recipe with the exception of adding a third can of broth.  I wasn't that crazy about it although my wife liked it.  I think it was because I thought the cumin sort of over powered this soup.  I made a different version titled "tuscan bean soup" that I tought was much better and I'll go back to.

Really yummy I ate so much I didn't need a main course! For the broth I used two stock cubes and instead of the couscous I used red lentils. I used a lot more spinach.

I agree, this soup was a bit bland.  However, I didn't want to mask the leek flavor by adding anything too strong, so I ended up just adding more salt (which I usually try to avoid).  Although the end product was mediocre, I appreciate the simplicity of the dish and see opportunities for improvement.

I was really expecting this soup to be delicious, but it was a little bland for me. It just needs something a little more. Maybe more leeks and garlic, a less couscous...?

Yum! Great recipe...I omitted couscous but added* shitake mushrooms sauteed in 1 tsp of low sodium soy sauce, fresh dill & parsley and green onion to garnish. Used veggie broth and took suggestion to leave fresh spinach on bottom of bowl and pour soup over (great tip!) rather than add to pot.

Thanks for a great recipe with leeks for a lovely soup that isn't filled with potatoes and cream (not that those are not *terribly* WONDERFUL.. but calorie-laden). Forgive as I went the rosmary/thyme route, although I agree it would be as good... but different... with cumin (Make it to your personal taste, some people just don't care for cumin...  or cilantro for that matter ... I happen love them both)...I just had some fresh R&T on hand. My own habits encouraged me to not only soften the leeks, but slightly carmelize them...(al la French onion soup) leading to a fond that deglazed to a wonderul rich, brown broth that set off the white beans wonderfully. I'm so enjoying the amroma of steeping bay leaves and ovarall yum. If "light but hearty" exists, this is it. (Even wthiout the whole grain couscous, which I would have loved if I had some available)..... I'll make this again.. THANK YOU!

I make this soup every week.  My husband (mr. meat & potatoes)loves it! My modification to the recipe is: 
1 tsp of cumin rather than 2 tsp
1/3 cup of couscous rather than 1/2 cup
Plus about 6 or 8 slices of Wellshire Farms organic turkey bacon - cooked and sliced.

This is great, hearty soup - I made one change, added 1/2 pound of Italian ground sausage. Also, I placed the spinach in the soup bowls and covered with the soup, it cooked perfectly by the time we got the bowls to the table. Yum!

Quick and easy. You can easily double the amount of stock to this recipe if you don't like it so thick. I added a whole 10 ounce bag of fresh spinach. Delicious.

Soup was easy and filling, but definitely could use a bit more oomph. I recommend using at least an additional clove of garlic and some fresh herbs like parsley or rosemary to bring a bit of spice to the party. Otherwise, this dish is sort of blah.

The soup is very good.  Make sure you strain and rinse the beans before cooking, otherwise the soup will become thick.  You can put in a lot of spinach (as it goes very well with everything in there), it doesnt taste right if you dont.  Ate the leftovers with leftover white rice I had and it tasted very good as well, probably due to the cumin.  Thank you for the recipe.

I halved the recipe to try and will make again.  It's delish.  I diced leftover carrots and celery and sauteed with the diced leeks also.  Put in less cumin than called for then adjust.  If I put in the whole amount, I think it would have been overpowering in that flavor.  I love this soup.

This was a good recipe, but I only gave 4 stars because I used it more as a guideline.  I upped the liquid to 4 cans of broth + 2 cups H2O.  I added a whole box of roasted garlic and olive oil couscous (with the seasoning pkt) and substituted a fresh rosemary sprig for the bay leaves (I didn't have any).  I didn't measure the spinach, but probably used 6 cups or so. I left the other ingredient proportions the same. 
The whole box of couscous made this a very thick soup, but it was very good too. Will make again.

Great soup that my whole family, which includes 3 little boys, loved!  I also added an extra can of broth, and left out the cumin, since I didn't have any on hand, and it turned out delicious.  Also, so easy my 4 year old did most of the work!  We love soup in our house...we'll definately make this one often!

I'm doing WW and saw how low in points this would be so I decided to try it.  I made the soup as directed because I don't like when people rate recipes and make tons of changes and then say they didn't like it.

Sorry but I didn't like this soup.  There isn't enough broth to actually make it a soup so based on someone's recommendation, I would have added at least another can of broth but I had already put in my only 2 cans.  As for the cumin, I felt like I was eating dirt.  I guess I'm not a cumin fan but I didn't know what else so use as a substitute.  Someone had mentioned rosemary but that didn't sound appealing to me.  Maybe I would try basil and make it an Italian soup!

Taking the advice of other reviews, I doubled the cumin, but later found that the flavor of it was far too strong and over powered everything else. The texture was chunky. Next time I would not use as much cumin and I would puree half the soup ti improve the mouth-feel.

A great fast recipe.  In the future I will use canned vegetable broth.  I used buillon cubes this time and the flavor was a little lacking.

It was great.  I didn't add the couscous because it was way too expensive at the supermarket.  I added some extra firm tofu cut into cubes instead.  I also added extra chicken broth to keep it from getting too thick.  I think the tofu made it super tasty.

I found this rather bland as well.  It definitely tastes healthy, and I can see it being a decent winter comfort food, like chicken noodle soup almost.  I can't figure out what would give it the flavor boost it seems to need.  Maybe a lot of garlic or some carrots and celery.  Or both.  Might try it again, as it's a good way to incorporate spinach.

I used vegetable broth to make this soup and I think that may have been a big part of its downfall. I also think the spices would taste better if it could cook longer.  In addition I found there was not enough broth in it.  It is very healthy I just think it really requires you to use chicken stock and more of it.

Really good soup! I had some time so I made it up to the point of boiling after adding the spices. I also added a ½ tsp of coriander and 1 tsp of basil. I let the soup base rest and cool for about an hour before reheating and adding the couscous and spinach. This allowed the spices to really infuse! I served it with thinly sliced avocado. YUM!

I substituted spinach for kale because it was in my refrigerator.  I liked the ease of the recipe.  I gave it a 4 because it was a little bland.  I did sprinkle some pepper flakes when eating to give it a little kick.  I'd make it again.

As written, this soup was absolutely tasteless! Thank you for all who helped contribute to doctoring it up. I added 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, rosemary, thyme, course ground black pepper, kosher salt,  regular chicken broth and no couscous. At least that made it edible and not a waste of the delicious leeks!

It was good, but rather flavorless. I had to add a lot more cumin, some ginger, and some red pepper flakes. I'd make it again, but with more spices.

I didn't use cumin.  I used rosemary and thyme as some reviewers suggested.  Probably should have left out the rosemary but it was still delicious!  I also took my time cooking the leeks as another reviewer suggested.  I can't stand couscous so I used some farro in its place but I didn't measure it out- just eyeballed it.  Got rave reviews from my family!

I would definitely make this again. I used three large leeks because that was one bundle in the grocery. I added a 14oz can of chicken broth and only 1tsp of cumin.  I also added a tablespoon or so of better than bouillon. It was a big hit.

This is similar to a Tuscan-style soup and it is tasty but not one I would make again only because I prefer the Tuscan-style soup better(similar ingredients except no cumin, bay leaves or couscous but Parmesan cheese instead).

Great soup. I made it  without any changes. It was even better the second day. I was a little apprehensive about the couscous, but added it anyway.  I will definitely make this soup again.

Simple, tasty, and super filling. I wish I'd remembered to add the lemon wedge recommended by another reviewer. I think that would have made this a 5 star soup.

I made this the other night for my husband and myself. All I can say was YUM! Only two modifications: I thought I had quinoa in the pantry but didn't so I substituted long grain and wild rice. The second addition was I diced up roasted turkey breast to add to the soup (husband is not vegetarian). The soup was sooo fabulous! Most definitely would fix again.

Nice soup.  I used thyme and rosemary instead of cumin.  And I used the juice of one whole lemon.  If I had it in the house I would have added a little white wine...but awesome with out it!

I used a smidge  less cumin and added a little bit of lemon juice as I felt the cumin was a little overwhelming.  Pretty tasty. After reading other reviews I think it would be better if the cumin was replaced with rosemary and thyme for a lighter flavor.

My teens  and friends regularly request  this soup. I change  to vegetarian broth, and I increase it from 2 cans to 4.  The increase is because I use quinoa instead of couscous, and that takes up a lot of liquid as it cooks. Pair this with a healthy bread and you have a super supper.

I agree with some of the other cooks.  I found this soup rather bland and no amount of doctoring it measurably improved the flavor.

Delicious, healthy and easy. This is like eating  fancy comfort food. Don't  expect flavors  to jump out at you.. These flavors are subtle and should be savored. I substituted quinoa for the couscous.

I followed the recipe with one exception, instead of couscous I used quinoa-same amount pre-cooked, and added to the soup. This is my first time using leeks and second time using quinoa. I recommend this soup as a healthy alternative.

Love this recipe. Today I used one can of cannelloni beans as I am trying the Paleo diet. I also added some leftover browned ground lamb with onions and Kale probably about a cup , A third of a cup of red quinoa with 2/3 cup to a cup of water, and then 16 ounces more chicken stock because it does get thick. Also added extra cumini and an extra garlic clove due to the increased liquid. It's just delicious on a cold rainy day like we have in the Adirondacks.

Made it as written but without the cumin, as family is not a fan.  Substituted Penzey's Sunny Paris (shallots, green peppercorn, basil, tarragon, chervil, bay leaf, and dill weed).  It was a little bland, but better the next day.  Made it again, and modified- added 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage to the leeks and garlic.  Added a couple of tbl. of lemon juice, a healthy splash of hot sauce, 1/2 tsp. of Tony Chachere, and a 1/2 tsp. of Adobo.  Cut the cous cous in half and still added more stock.  Was a big hit with the family (bumps to 5 star) and this is the way we'll serve it now.

Bland,had to add alot of other seasoning to get any flavor,the main flavor came with the box of couscous,I used garlic. To much beans,the couscous soaks up all the "soup" after 10 mins, doesn't make a good take to work meal.

I made this soup for the first time last night and we loved it! I used other peoples' reviews as a guide to tweak it, such as using a lot more of the leeks than just the bulb, removing maybe a third off the top and removing the outer leaves and adding extra chicken broth (maybe 2 cups or so). One of the cans of cannelini (sp?) beans had seasoning of sage and rosemary and the other was just plain. I agonized over the choice of either using rosemary & thyme or cumin and finally decided on the cumin - and I'm glad I did. I also added some garlic salt and garlic powder and onion powder - not a lot, just sprinkled some in the pot for a little extra flavor. I followed another reviewer's idea of placing the baby spinach leaves on the bottom of the soup bowls and then adding the soup on top. Lastly, I grated some parmesan cheese to add to the top, which really added to the flavor overall. I was actually amazed at how delicious it turned out! This one is a keeper for us!

Absolutely delicious.  Suggest using immersion blender to use beans to thicken soup.  Took advice of other reviewers and  used more of the leek, skipped couscous, and put spinach in bottom of mug rather than in the soup itself.  That way the spinach was fresh when I had soup the next day.   I loved the cumin in the soup.  Will try the rosemary/thyme another time.

This came together so quickly and easily, I actually didn't even love it when I sampled it before packing away for lunches. About 12 hours later, when it was time to eat, I was quite pleased! Initially hesitant about the cumin, I was okay with the flavor it added. I also chose to use quinoa instead of the couscous since I had some already cooked. I won't *rush* to make this again, but it's a recipe I'll keep handy when I want something light, healthy, and tasty.

My church has "soup suppers" during Lent and I took this as a vegetarian option last week, of course using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I boosted the amount of garlic and I made a double recipe, hoping to have some left over to eat on the weekend.   The soup was so delicious it "sold out", even though there were five other choices!

I found this recipe very bland and honestly, the cumin was a terrible addition. It just did not go with the soup at all. I should have omitted it and used rosemary and thyme instead, with some more onions and garlic. It was bland. I also would not add couscous, but pastina instead.

Yummy, healthy, & easy.  What more can you ask for?  Will add more broth next time.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and put the spinach in the bowl, then ladled soup over it.  Will also try the rosemary/thyme combo, but I loved it as is.  Thank you!

I have made this numerous times and it's a favorite with my husband and I with these changes, add a pkg of cajun style andouille chicken sausage, use the entire leek (I use 2)and I also add some extra cumin and some hot sauce. Also lots of spinach.  Yumm!

My husband made this and I was not a fan. His version was two stars for me, but I'm giving a three because I'm not sure how closely he followed the recipe. The worst part for me was the bay leaf. It seemed to overpower the other flavours.

This was edible but not much more.  My husband and I found it barely bland and had to doctor it up at the table quite a bit.  Definitely will not be making this again.

Hmmm.  Not sure why this got such good reviews.  I followed the recipe but found it tasteless except for the cumin.  Bummer, because I love all the components, it just didn't work with the cumin.

I used little bow tie pasta instead of couscous. I added about a table spoon of cumin just because I love the taste. I also added a splash of turmeric and it came out wonderful. Boyfriend said it was his favorite soup yet!

MMMMMMM  I forgot to get couscous, so I made it without.  It certainly was great without it!  Adding it would have made it a lot thicker.

It's a keeper!  My three-year old even said "I love this soup!" I think the couscous really makes a big difference.  We'll be making this soup often.

I added a little more cumin for a stronger flavor.  This soup was delicious! And it freezes well. I  froze the leftovers in 2 cup glass pyrex bowls.  Last night I thawed it overnight in the fridge.  The couscous did soak much of the liquid but I added some boiling water from the water dispenser and microwaved for just about a minute.  Tastes just as good as when I made it  a couple months ago.  I will be making this again and again.

This soup is so delicious! The ingredients make such a great combination...white beans, leaks, spinach, couscous...so good! Perfect on a cold winter day. My husband loved it, too. At first I thought it was going to be too light, but it was very filling. Delicious!

Just OK in our opinion.  Healthy, yes.  I did not have whole wheat couscous--don't know if that would give better flavor.  Will finish this up, but won't make again.

My new favorite comfort food!  I did make a few changes.  Didn't have couscous so I used a pouch of Uncle Bens ready in 90 sec whole grain medly (vegetable harvest).  Also, omitted the cumin.  Wonderful rich flavor.  And quick too! It earned its 5 stars.

I just made a couple of changes.  I added 3 slices cut, of bacon to the leeks and garlic and used rices instead of couscous.  This was delicious!!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Made this for the 1st time tonight & it was excellent.  My kids declared it a "makeover," which means please make this again!  I only had 3 leek bulbs, but they seemed pretty big.  I did not have couscous at home (thought I did when I shopped for the ingredients, so put in small alphabet pasta and turned out great - I guess any small pasta would work!

Absolutely wonderful! Just my type of soup. I will make this again and again. I did add more garlic and more broth but not because there is anything wrong with this recipe, just my taste. Thanks for a new favorite. I take soup to work almost everyday in the winter and I am always looking for new ideas. Next time I will double it!

I have made this soup for the last three years.  It is excellent.  I do add more garlic and a bit more broth.  I've even reduced the broth and made side dish out of the soup.  Some reviews have called it bland.  The soup is a bit subtle, but does have a lot of flavor.

I absolutely LOVE this soup! It is so delicious and very QUICK and easy to make! I substituted one tsp. of poultry seasoning for the cumin and used only one can of beans. Perfection! Next time I'll double the recipe since my husband and I ate almost the whole batch in one sitting. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This gets 5 stars from me, just added a little spice to kick it up and extra chicken broth since I did put in a little extra couscous which just sucked up all the broth.  Some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top to serve and it was great I couldn't stop eating this, then I re-heated for lunch at work the next day and everybody wanted the recipe.

This is a simple soup which eats very well with French bread.

Agree with other reviewers:  very bland and not enough chicken broth.  Can also use more spinach to taste.

I liked it/didn't love it. Since it was just "okay" for me I won't recycle this one. I have other bean soups I already have/like better. Not really sure why/nothing contractive to add......just overall flavor didn't rock my boat.

Yum! I used 32 oz of chicken broth, 1 bay leaf, seasonings, garlic powder...thats what I had on hand... and 1 whole leek. Also, I used frozen Spinach too. For the noodles I used Ditalini. You might want to save the bean broth instead of draining it, I found that it needed a little more broth than I used. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly.  Very good.  Very quick and easy.  My kids even liked it.  My 9 yr old thought it tasted like white chili....(kind of).  If you don't eat it right away you will need to add more broth.  I will make it again.

I have made a soup similar to this praticular recipe and because my husband is such a meat eater I ended up adding smoked sausage to the recipe and a few extra spices and seasonings just for our taste. Instead of leeks, i used regular green onions, they taste just the same and are much cheaper and easier to find than leeks. I would also substitute the cannellini beans for great northern beans just because I'm a northerner :)

This was very good and surprisingly filling. I made for company and everyone enjoyed it. Maybe could have used more broth - I may double the broth next time. Other than that - yum :)

I made this soup on a cold blustery day, it hit the spot.   However, if I make it again I will leave out the couscous or at least substiture with barley or a small pasta.  Enjoy

I made this with a whole box of couscous b/c I read that someone else did that and it actually turned out to be good. I thought that sounded better than a soup. It definitely was! I also made it w/o the leeks b/c I forgot to buy them at the store. It was good still. My 18 month old daughter liked this too! And it made a TON of food. This would make an excellent, nutritious side dish.

I made this on one of the coldest days of t he year bcause it sounded warm, hearty and delcious.  It was everything I expected AND it was a snap to make...I actually added a third can of beans, and didnt use bay leaves (because I didnt have any).  I dont know that my variations did anything to change the soup's integrity - but I have a family of 6 and thought extra beans would go farther...cant wait to heat up leftovers!!!!!

This is a wonderful soup.  It calls for some of my favorite ingredients, those found in the healthy Mediterranean diet.  Everyone loved it, especially my husband who enjoys a homemade and hearty one dish meal he can eat with a spoon.  This will be top of my favorites list and one I will make again and again.  Thank you!

Thanks for the healthy recipe.  I have been looking to cook with leeks and this was a very quick and simple recipe to make.  I used vegetable broth, added 1 tsp salt, the juice of 1 lemon, and sprinkled 1/4 cup fresh romano cheese at the end.  I also garnished each serving with more romano cheese.  The result was delicious.  Thanks!!!

great!!  i used a vegetable broth and instead of cumin and bay leaves i used rosemary and basil.  tastes fantastic.  just use enough until you have the taste you want.  also, salt and pepper help to keep it from tasting too bland.  definitely wait until you are ready to eat to add the spinach.  awesome!

The temperature in Des Moines, Iowa today is -11 with a windchill of -27. This soup counteracted the bone-numbing cold with its rich, flavorful, and tummy-filling heat. I like a brothy soup, so I added an extra can of chicken broth, no couscous.

I likes this recipe.  I have not cooked much with leeks and I was pleasantly surprised.  I used vegetable broth, more garlic and added some pepper flakes and a squeeze of lemon before serving.  I did not have Coucous so I used Kasha (buckwheat) and it worked out great.

OMG, this is so delish!  Like some other reviewers, I did doctor mine up quite a bit.  I added some lemon and some green salsa as I prefer things with more of a kick!  Next time I make it, I will try it with quinoa instead of cous cous and add Jalapeno Tabasco sauce.

Good starting point.  I doubled the garlic and added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, and it still was bland (for our tastes).  I will experiment, because we like all the ingredients individually, and I know this has potential.

Had to give it 5 stars simply because my whole family liked it. I did add a few things, garlic and red pepper flakes, not to mention the rosemary and half the cumin.....plus I made it for lunches so I did not add the Spinach into the soup while it was cooking. Instead I packed it on the side and left instructions with the family to heat the soup first then add the spinach once it was heated. Everything turned out wonderful! Thank your for helping me fit a healthy 'green' into my family's meal!

This soup was so easy and good!  I added a little more chicken broth and used a box of couscous. Though like others said I bet it would be just fine with out any couscous. Either way its good, good for you, easy and adjustable!!

I really enjoyed this twist on traditional white-bean soup (which I've never been a fan of), and I thought the seasonings were perfect. My boyfriend, on the other hand, who loves the traditional version, thought it was too heavy on the cumin. The only changes I made were to use veg broth and quinoa instead of couscous. Perfect for a cold fall night--and very easy to make.

This was great, and SO easy! I followed the recipe exactly except for using veggie broth. Next time I will tear or cut the spinach leaves versus leaving them whole. My husband really liked it, and sometimes it's hard to fill him up on soup ;)
Definitely a keeper!

I love this soup and make it often. This is one of very few recipes where the spices do not need any tweaking - the only change I make is to use vegetable broth. It's very filling for such a simple, healthy dish.

I was disappointed. I loved the idea and may use it as base for my own recipe, but I didn't enjoy the taste of cumin in this soup. I love cumin in other dishes, it just wasn't that great. I followed the recipe exactly, and had to add more liquid to get the right consistency. I threw away all of the leftovers, which was discouraging. The reviewer who suggested putting spinach in the bottom of the soup bowl and pouring the hot soup over it to cook the spinach had a great idea!

I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of flavor in this soup.  My family loved it.  It is now one of our favorites - it is quick easy and cheap to make.  I left the recipe just as is.

I really liked this soup.  It is full of good stuff that is good for you.  Unfortunately my little one's pallate still needs stretching.  He had to be cajoled into finishing his bowl.  I will make this again and I hope my children's tastes mature.

This looked so good in the picture, but I'm afraid the flavor didn't do it for me.  Fairly bland, and a bit too cumin-y.

Very pleasant, mild (healthy!) soup. I left out the couscous and added ground coriander alongside the cumin, and it was very tasty.  Sits well in the fridge, though as other reviewers have suggested, the spinach should really be added at the time of serving. Also, a dash of lemon juice on top makes this extra-special.

A Perfect Meal for a freezing Sunday night.  Based on others' feedback, I added more garlic, and seasoned with onion powder, thyme, the flavor pack from my couscous box, and a splash of white wine worcestershire sauce for a bit of tang.  This was so hearty and rather healthy too.  Crusty bread topped off the meal.  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow.  Great recipe, Beth.

One of my favorites.  I didn't have couscous so I used my leftover brown rice and lima beans.  I wish I would have added more spinach.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.  It is thick but we liked it like that.  I will definitely need to add water to the leftovers.  The couscous is a "must have" in the recipe - the texture of the beans and couscous together was so good!

I gave this soup 5 stars because husband who is very, very picky gave me a thumbs up.  My 8 year old son cleared his bowl.  My 4 year is still very suspicious of spinach but I keep offering it to her.  The only thing I did different was add about a cup of water (to help with the couscous).  The leeks and the cumin really bring out the flavour of this soup.  For those of you who are not using the couscous, you really are missing out.  Thank you for a great soup recipe.

We really enjoyed this soup.  I made it because my daughter wasn't feeling well and it was a cold day in NY.  I took others advice and didn't add the couscous (i've never cooked with it before) and i added more chicken broth as suggested.  I also added more garlic (personal preference) and as someone else suggested... cooked some sausage on the side, crumbled it up and added at the end.  I also served it with parm cheese on top.  Really great and even better the second day!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very good soup! Used 4 cans Veggie broth, 3 leeks, 1/2 an onion, and a dash of cayenne pepper. Yummy! Served with crackers and feta cheese. Really liked the texture of the couscous with this soup, but don't add too much, as it turns out very thick!

This is my first review!! My friend made this soup for us. She used only half of the amount of coucous listed in the recipe (per other reviewers suggestions). My friend loved the soup!!! i thought the soup was just okay; i felt the spiniach was too stringy. My friend gave this five stars; i gave it three, so we compromised on four:). Thank you for the recipe!!!!

I was pleasantly surprised by this great tasting soup.  I omitted the leeks because I don't like onions and I added a little extra broth.  It was very filling and very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was great the first time around, fresh from the stove.  But make sure you eat it all up because it isn't as good reheated.  I used baby spinach instead and next time wouldn't add the couscous.  Otherwise, nice and light!

I found this recipe to be bland. I added lots of salt & pepper to kick it up. My husban added hot sauce to it. The positive is it's very healthy.

Good soup, but I skipped the couscous as I'm not really fond of it. Needed more seasonings, but all in all, very nice. Thanks Beth!

This was OK. I thought it was a little bland for me. I didn't think it needed the couscous. I'm usually a white bean fan but I just thought it was missing something...

YUMMY! My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It was very easy and very filling. It was very tasty and reheated perfectly.
