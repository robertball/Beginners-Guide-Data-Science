This is the coleslaw recipe I've been searching for on AR! I'm picky about coleslaws and will try different ones, but I've been longing for a go-to classic style recipe and now I've found it! I used 1/4 cup Hellman's lite mayo, 1/4 cup lite Miracle whip, and 1/4 cup buttermilk (plus a couple of extra Tbsp. for good measure).  I used light sour cream and left the rest the ingredients the same. I tossed the dressing with the coleslaw mix and let it chill in the fridge for about 4 hours. It was so creamy and so good. It tasted just like the kind I've gotten at some seafood restaurants along side really good crab cakes.  I however chose to serve this with fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits for a kind of KFC night!

Great coleslaw. Easy, easy, easy to make with ordinary ingredients on hand. I made it exactly as the recipe says with no changes. Came out about half the price of deli coleslaw. The downside is that you shouldn't serve this immediately like you can deli. You need to let this chill a few hours. It looks kind of dry and not too creamy when you first mix it up. I was tempted to make a second batch of the dressing but don't! This changes dramatically into a nice creamy slaw after a couple of hours.

I LOVE THIS SLAW! This is the perfect coleslaw. Very creamy. When making this recipe, you will think that there won't be enough of the sauce. But upon sitting for a bit, the slaw "relaxes" and it's perfect. Only takes about 1/2 hour for it to relax. Mine didn't get runny, even the next day and I followed the recipe to a T.

Update: This has become my "go to" coleslaw recipe. I consider myself a coleslaw snob and I just can't get enough of this slaw. I now even leave out the sour cream and just use about 1 1/4- 1/2 cup mayo with the rest of the ingredients staying the same. INCREDIBLE!!!

I have been in search of the perfect cole slaw recipe for a long time and I tried this one a while back.  My husband and daughter just loved it!  They are very particular about their slaw and I was relieved to finally have it!

This slaw is yummy and quick- no chopping necessary, which is a plus. For an even flavor, I suggest lowfat mayonnaise and regular sour cream. You don't want to just taste mayo. For lovers of mayo slaw, make as is, but if you like a taste of vinegar in a creamy slaw, use a bit less sugar and 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar. Either way, I recommend adding black pepper and paprika for extra flavor enhancement.

I have made this salad many, many times over the past few years (I got it when it came out in the magazine). It is always a hit, It is less sweet and more savory. I serve it as a side dish, or on top of pulled pork sandwiches (a pork roast cooked in the crock pot all day with a bottle of bbq sauce) SUPER EASY AND EXCELLENT!!

We celebrated Australia Day today and I made this cole slaw for our barbecue. It was nice. I didn't have sour cream, but used fat free yogurt in place of it. It worked perfect. Less calories and a very nice flavor. My husband thought it was yummy, so I'll plan to make this part of every barbecue I have or go to.

Very easy and has a great taste with very little prep time. I fixed a whole bag of shredded cabbage/carrots and there was only 2 of us and there is so little left we should be ashamed. This is a keeper and I will continue to use. Thanks!

Since I'm on Weight Watchers, I made this with FF Mayo, FF Sour Cream, and Splenda -- and loved the results.  I love cole slaw and only indulge occasionally due to the fat & calories.  I will make this often and keep it on hand.

This was just the right combination of mayo and sour cream for a creamy restaurant-style coleslaw. I added a few teaspoons red wine vinegar, omitted the sugar and used one packet of Splenda.

Great! Super quick and easy! Wonderful flavor - just simple home cooking, nothing exotic or unexpected. When you want a good basic recipe you can count on - this is the one. Easy to increase or decrease amounts too. I squeezed in a little lemon juice for added tang but it certainly wasn't necessary!

Very good recipe, definitely easy to make.  I didn't have any sour cream, so I increased the mayo to 1 Cup.  I think I'll try this again with the sour cream.

I was a little concerned that the sour cream would not tastes good but it was delicious.  The dry mustard must kick up the flavor.  I highly recommend it.

I loved this coleslaw - one of the best I've tasted!  Only one point to note...I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made it the day before; by the time we were going to eat it, the dressing had become a little runny, so it had to be drained.  I would suggest making this coleslaw several hours in advance to allow the flavours to meld, but perhaps not the day before.

This has to be the best slaw I've eaten by far and I am from the south.  I have to say it was good after chilling in the frig for just a couple of hours but the next day it was even better.  I added a little applecider vinegar, celery seed, purple onion and bellpepper to mine and used only half the sugar.  This is a definite keeper!!! Thanks for sharing.

The sour cream made this cole slaw.  It was great.  Friends loved it and fiance said it's a keeper.  When you first mix all the ingredients it looks like you need more mayo or sour cream but you do not.  Let it set 20 minutes in the fridge and it looks completely different.  Thanx for the recipe!

I never made coleslaw with dinner because my husband always hated it. I was making ribs one night and decided to make some for myself and the kids. My husband actually loved this recipe, along with the kids.

Very easy to make and loved by the whole family. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was still wonderful; nobody could even tell the difference.  It was eaten up in one day and they all want me to make  it again!  Very good if you like a creamy, slightly sweet coleslaw without the strong vinegar taste.

This was excellent.  I made it for  large group last night.  I used 3 bags of slaw so I doubled the dressing recipe.  It was very creamy.  I think the next time I make it using 3 bags of slaw I won't double the dressing.  There weren't any left overs and I got a lot of compliments.

I am updating my rating from 4 stars to 5.  We like this coleslaw so much (without celery salt) that I make it almost once a week. I now usually use sugar rather than sugar substitute and in this recipe I think it makes a big difference. 

This was my first review:
I tried lots of recipes for coleslaw dressing looking for one I liked.  This is it!  I use sugar substitute and no celery salt.

If you havent tried a bit of horseradish to this sweet and tangy coleslaw, please do. I found that the bite is great with the tang, and also a little lemon pepper gives it passazzzzz.

Very good! The only thing I did different was I was out of seasoned and celery salt so I made my own seasoned salt and it still turned out awesome. Also ran out of dry mustard one time and still was great. Have made many times now :) You can also cut up and make your own coleslaw mix!

This was very good--my husband usually only likes KFC coleslaw, but he liked this. I ended up using about a teaspoon of prepared mustard instead of ground (I didn't have any ground!), and it was very tasty.

This recipe was AWESOME! I actually bought the prepackaged shredded broccoli, red cabbage and carrots rather than the traditional coleslaw package(cabbage and carrots). I then added 1/2 head of shredded cabbage and a few shredded carrots. Instead of the ground mustard, use a tsp of real mustard. Really adds to the flavor. I also added a little more of the celery salt to taste. BEST recipe for coleslaw that I've used and the guests LOVED IT!! I agree. . definitely let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so to give the ingredients time to blend. Served with fried catfish, hushpuppies, black-eyed peas, sauteed mushrooms and peach cobbler!! YUMMY!! Recipe was EASY!!

100 stars!!! Wow, this is amazing! (Mind you this was my first attempt at ever making cole slaw) I agree with other reviewers that it appears the sauce isn't enough for the whole bag of cabbage/carrots, but it is!! The longer the mixture sits the BETTER! Two Thumbs WAY Up!!

This was so easy to make and very tasty too!  Next time I will try cutting back on the sauce a bit, as it was a little too goopy for my taste.  My husband likes it that way, though, and it didn't stop me from having a second helping!

This slaw is the best I've ever tasted!  Even my brother in law, who usually hates anything that isnt a snack food, went back for a big second helping.  This is the recipe that I will always use for slaw from now on!

Can we say YUMMY!?  How easy it was.  I made it a few hours a head of time and added a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar.  It was nice and juicy by the time dinner was ready.

This was delicious, simple and easy.  I am glad I read all the reviews because the first reviewer said she was tempted to increase the dressing since it seemed dry but after just a little time of sitting it was definitely creamy.  I agree - you don't have to increase it! Update-I've made 8 coleslaw recipes from this site and this is my favorite for creamiest!!  And I adore Angie's Dad's Best Cabbage Coleslaw.

I'm changing my rating from a 4 to a 5. I just ate some that was left over from last night, and it tastes a million times better!  I will continue to use this recipe, and just make sure to make it a day in advance!

Best home made cole slaw!  I used pre-packaged cole slaw mix to cut down on prep time and also cut the recipe down slightly to use approx. 1/4 cup cole slaw in Chinese chicken spring rolls.

I made this with a half cup mayo and a half cup sour cream, honey in place of sugar, and a splash of apple cider vinegar.  My husband loves it!  I am not really a cole slaw lover, but it is yummy and creamy!

My boyfriend and I threw a barbeque party for a bunch of Southerners.  As the only transplant of the bunch I was nervous about attempting my first cole slaw.  When the pickiest of the buch turned to me and said " this is great cole slaw and that's hard to do!"  he was so right!  Please everyone at our table!

I used a brocoli slaw mix with this recipe and it was great!!! I garnished the top with chopped up green onions and crumbled bacon. It got rave reviews last Easter and I plan to make it again this Easter.

Great recipe.  Very easy!  I used a medium fresh cabbage and 2 carrots for the packaged slaw mix.  I substituted Fat Free Sour Cream and used Splenda instead of the sugar.  I used it one for one and it was terrific.

This is a great recipe. I left out the celery salt because I didn't have any and it still tasted great. Try this if you like a sweet slaw. If you like your slaw with more of a vinegar kick this is not for you.

been looking for a coleslaw recipe for years.  This one is IT !!  Even my husband who hates coleslaw loved this one. He is a diabetic and using Splenda didn't even matter - it was fabulous.

This was good, but just too sweet for our taste.  I will make this again with less sugar, celery seed instead of celery salt; add some garlic powder, and onion powder.
