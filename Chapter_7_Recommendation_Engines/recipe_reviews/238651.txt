Loved the flavor of this. The texture is very light and fluffy.  I don't think the added sugar is necessary, especially if you use a very ripe banana, but that is personal preference. As the recipe submitter said, you don't taste the tofu AT ALL, so this is a good way to sneak some in your diet. That said, the servings sizes are very small. The whole recipe barely made 16oz, which in my opinion, is the perfect servings size for 1 person, not 2.   I will be making this again tomorrow for breakfast!

5.23.16   My strawberries were very ripe and sweet, so I omitted the sugar.  I also used a frozen banana because I like thicker smoothies.  Another reviewer described the consistency  as fluffy, and I totally agree with her.  The strawberry flavor really came through, the yogurt gave it just a little tang, and the tofu made it incredibly creamy.  Only one comment, this makes 2 “small” smoothies, so if you’re used to drinking a larger smoothie, you may want to consider doubling the recipe.  Not only does this taste good, it breaks down pretty well nutritionally, too.

Instead of adding strawberries I added a second banana. It turned out really yummy!
