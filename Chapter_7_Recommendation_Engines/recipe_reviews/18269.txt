Excellent recipe. I made is for some friends and they loved it!  I followed some others advice though and made some changes.  I don't think I will ever try making it as the recipe says.  I used 12 medium sized new red potatoes and cut them into quarters.  I boiled them for almost 15 minutes.  I then mixed the potatoes, cheese, and ranch dressing, along with 1/3 c of chopped green onions, and placed them in a 2 quart casserole dish. I baked it for about 10 minutes and it came out wonderful.  Some of the potatoes will break down so it is more of a casserole type dish.  One word of caution - pick your ranch dressing carefully.  Since the potatoes and cheese are very mild in flavor, the taste of your dressing will really stand out.  Pick a mild flavored ranch.  I tried using a Bacon Ranch, and I thought the bacon flavor was a little too strong.  With the medium sized potatoes, I ended up with enough food for 8.  I didn't add any extra dressing or cheese either.  In fact, next time I may cut it back just a little.  This one is a keeper!

These potatoes were great. Instead of cutting them in half though, I quartered the potatoes prior to boiling them.  After they were cooked I put them in a casserole dish and spread the dressing on and then sprinkled the cheese over the top.  I stirred it together and then put in the oven.  I think this was a bit easier than fussing with each individual potato half.  These are best right out of the oven, the leftovers weren't as tasty.  Overall this recipe is delicious-we all enjoyed it!

Simply Delicious! I made these potatoes last night and they were great. My husband loved them, but had one request- add bacon next time! Even my finicky 13-month-old gobbled them down in no time!
This is a great recipe because its so quick and packed with flavor. I modified it a little, like most everyone else. I boiled 11 potatoes for a little over 15 minutes, and quartered them (although next time I'd slice slice them thick), put them in a 2-quart casserole dish, covered with just over a cup of ranch, 2/3 cup of chopped green onions, and 1 1/2 cups of shredded colby jack cheese. I baked them for almost 10 minutes, and they were fantastic. This will definitley be a regular at our dinner table!

This is definately a fantastic base recipe. I made a few adjustments. I halved the recipe as there are only two of us. I cut the potatoes in half and then in fifths. Instead of boiling, I put them in a greased 4x5.5" pan. I sprinkled Italian seasonings and garlic salt on top. Baked in 350 for 50 minutes. Drizzled ranch and cheese over top and mixed potatoes up. Then sprinkled crushed seasoned croutons on top and put in oven for another 5 minutes. So so good! Will definately put this one in the recipe box! Thanks!

Very good. I used Idaho potatoes and the skins should have been removed. I bet new red potatoes would have been great. I also quartered the potatoes and mixed the ranch dressing with the potatoes and sprinkled the cheese and pepper on top. Everyone loved them!

These were delish.  I cubed them up before boiling, stirred in the ranch and cheese and then placed them in a foiled line pan for easy clean up.  Topped with crumbled bacon and heated through.  Be sure not to cook them too long, as they will break up.  Yum, there were no leftovers!

This was absolutley scrumptious!  So simple and so good!  Next time I will thickly slice the potatoes instead of cutting them in half.  That should balance out the flavors better.  Thanks!

Thanks for a great new way for me to prepare my potatoes.  I really like the dressing and cheese idea.  Next time I may try some peppercorn ranch or you could even use blue cheese dressing...it's really up to your personal preference.  I did add some green onions and bacon bits to mine.  Oh... and don't forget that dusting of freshly ground black pepper!! Thanks F.R.

This recipe leaves me speechless...  The combination of ranch,cheeses and pepper is terrific. I must admit I played with it. I quartered the potatoes before boiling, After boiling, I mixed the potatoes,Maries Ranch dressing, some green onions(scallions), bacon bits(not the imatation ones), freshly ground pepper and cheese. Spread in a greased pan (lasagna size foil pan) and bake at 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes. There are so many ways to play around with this recipe. But you need the red potatoes,ranch dressing, and cheese as your base. Thank you F.R. for a great recipe.

Too greasy - I made these casserole style as other reviewers suggested.  I used 3/4 cup ranch and about 6 oz sharp cheddar.  They tasted fine, but the grease floating on the top of the pan was really a turn off.  I will not make again.

Excellent. I steamed the potatoes for 35 minutes instead of boiling. I also used Lt. Ranch dressing. This recipe is so versatile & has so many variations, it will take me some time to try them all.

Love this recipe!  I don't measure my ranch, just take the bottle and pour, and I also add bacon.  Oscar Mayer makes bacon pieces you can buy and just sprinkle on, and they work great!  Bacon bits, however, do not work as well.

These were pretty good.  I had to boil them a second time as I did not get them soft enough the first round.  I think I need to keep the potatoes covered on high heat next time.  In any case, they were pretty tasty.  They got good reviews from the family.

These were soooo good.  I made this into more of a casserole as others had suggested.  Par boiled the quartered potatoes then mixed them with the ranch, cheese and bacon pieces.  Baked for about 15 minutes and when they came out sprinkled with green onion.  Will definately be making these again.

WOW! These potatoes were superb!  Everone loved them & fought over left-overs!!  I cubed the potatos & cooked for 15 minutes-too long the next time 7 minutes-just a tad longer would have been just right.  I follwed directions from others & mixed the ranch dressing with potatos & sprinkled with bacon bits, cheese & scallions---yummy!!! This one is a keeper!

MMMMMmmmmm!!!! Didn't fit my low fat diet, but yummy as can be! I listened to some of the other reviews and made it more of a casserole (tossed the potatoes in the ranch before covering with cheese) Put them in the oven for 10 minutes instead of 3. I would definitely make this recipe again, in fact I'm sending it to my mother ASAP! Fast, easy, and a crowd pleaser!

Really good!  I have tried doing this several ways.  The method that seems to work best for me is to parboil the potatoes, stir them together with the dressing, pour into a greased casserole dish, then sprinkle with cheese and bacon bits.  Bake 5-10 minutes.  My kids ask for this often!

These were fabulous!!  I made them casserole style, like some of the other reviewers recommended.  One of the other reviewers mentioned using a mild ranch dressing, so it's not overpowering.  What I did was buy a Hidden Valley Ranch packet, and make the dressing following the instructions, except only using about 2/3 of the packet (with the full amounts of the other ingredients)  The potatoes still had a yummy ranch flavor, but it wasn't too overpowering.  I threw in a few green onions too.

My husband loves these potatoes..I cube them, then mix with the dressing and cheese.  I also cook them a bit longer in the oven to get a little bit of browning.  They're great.

These potatoes tasted excellent! I followed other suggestions and after peeling, quartering, and boiling the potatoes, I put them in a round casserole dish, and mixed in the ranch dressing and cheese. I used the homemade ranch dressing recipe (Ranch Dressing II)from this site.  I served this with Aussie Chicken since that used the same type of cheese, and same oven temp!

This was a new way to fix (fresh dug) new baby red potatoes for me.  My family enjoyed these along side of Easy Slow Cooker French Dip sandwiches from AR.   Thanks for sharing.

My family absolutely loved these potatoes!  I used yukon gold, didn't peel them, and made the ranch using the package as we like it much better than the bottled version.  I also added real bacon bits, as recommended.
GREAT RECIPE!!

These were yummy! I really liked them, but I think they need to be boiled longer than ten minutes. I think I will try slices next time instead of just halves.

I loved these! I had bigger red potatoes, and so I sliced them into 1/4" discs and they were so good. The flavors meld nicely. It's always nice to find something different to do with potatoes.

I used this recipe as a base to make something even more delicious!  I used larger red potatoes and cut them into bite size chunks.  I put some butter pats on top of the potatoes and microwaved them until tender.  Then I mixed them with the ingredients listed, as well as 8 oz. sour cream, bacon crumbles and chives and then baked them.  They are outstanding, though certainly not low fat!

YUMMY!  The only change I made was following the suggestion to boil the potatoes for a little while.  If not, they'll take longer to cook.  That aside, I give this five stars for it's simplicity and tastiness!  I make it so often my husband started rolling his eyes at me, but our guests ALWAYS love it!!!

This is a nice change from ordinary potatoes.  I, too, made it casserole style.  I also added green onion.  This will go into permanent dinner rotation at my house.  I bet it would be good with some fresh bacon bits as well.

Didn't care for these much...couldn't taste the dressing at all. Slicing the bottom off the potatoes does help them stand straight.

We love this. We make it a lot with the Anniversary Chicken, also from this site. Very yummy.I usually cut up the potatoes into bite size pieces and microwave them until tender. Then mix up the Ranch dressing with it and then top with cheese before putting in oven.

I liked these pretty well.  I almost think that I would rather spread a little butter with some salt and pepper and then add the cheese.  The ranch just didn't seem to fit in warm.  Next time I will do the butter thing and add a bit of bacon.

How can you go wrong with this recipe? It's like a shortcut recipe for restaurant style potato skins without the work! We thought it was delicious. The only thing I added was a sprinkle of real bacon bits on top of the cheese before baking. Yum!! Next time I think I'll add green onions as a few others have suggested.

These potatoes were ok but nothing spectacular. I prefer them when they are brown and crisp and these didn't brown at all. I followed the recipe except using cheddar cheese.

This was good.  However, unless you get very tiny potatoes, the ratio of potato to topping isn't even.  Next time, I am going to make the potato smaller by cutting off the rounded bottom.  That way, it will lay better on the baking sheet and even out the ratio.  I used bacon as recommended and they were delicious!

Tasty and so easy to make.  I took others' recommendations and sliced the potatoes into pieces approximately 1/3" thick.  I then layered them in a 9" x 13" pan that had been shot with a quick spray of oil.  I didn't measure the dressing, just squeezed it out of the bottle 'til it looked about right.  I probably used a little under a cup.  I also used a little less cheese than called for, just as a personal preference.  Even the picky eater in the family enjoyed these.

I thought these were very good, but needed a few more minutes in the boiling water (sliced) had them in for 15 minutes. I made it as a cassarole as many readers suggested. I used 2/3 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and 3/4 cup of Marie's Ranch dressing. Also went with crumbed bacon on top.

I am probably changing this recipe like crazy but it is a good change.  When I make this I take 1/4 cup canola or veggie oil, put in one packet of dry Ranch dressing mix and stir that up.  Then I pour that over the red potatoes that have been halved and bake uncovered for about 35-40 minutes.  It is WAY less fattening then the original recipe and very tasty too.  Great side dish to "jazz up" potatoes.

These were a great new way to eat potatoes.  I added salt and pepper, just don't drown the potatoes in the ranch.  Tastes great!

I used Hidden Valley Original Ranch Dressing Light. (Bought the Light by mistake) They were terrible! I made them like a casserole and it was way too much dressing. The Hidden Valley taste was overwhelming, the word "Original" threw me off and I didn't notice the word "Light" - very bad taste!

These are so easy to make and taste wonderful! I also made them casserole-style and added real bacon bits.  Even my picky daughter liked them!

We grew red potatoes in our garden this year and the kids were skeptical about the taste. I made this recipe and all three boys (2,3 & 7) had second helpings. They asked to have them for lunch the next day too! So I think that says it all. A real keeper and reallly delicious.

These were great potatoes, and very easy to make. My husband doesn't like the "zesty" ranch taste, so I substituted Parmesano Romano dressing instead, and it was delectable!

I found this to be way too much dressing. They were too soggy. Maybe baking them longer would help the dressing soak in and they would be a bit less saucy.

I like things bite-sized, so I cut the potatoes into bite-size pieces. After preparing the potatoes as the recipe instructs, I put them in a 9x13, poured ranch so that it covered most of them, stirred it all up, sprinkled cheese on top and baked it until the cheese was melted. My husband and I really enjoyed it!

Not bad.  Maybe cut them into smaller slices; give it better flavor.  Also didn't use all that ranch as it seemed a bit excessive.

I made this recipe by cutting the potatoes into smaller pieces and mixing in the pepper and ranch.  Then put it into a casserole dish, topped it with cheese and baked it for 10 minutes.  It was great!  My family loved it!

These are sooo delicious, sometimes when I make them I cut up the potatoes and put in a baking dish and then cover with ranch dressing and cheese and then bake. Very good leftover also.

I loved this. I love potatoes, so that helps. I have made this so many times adding things here and there depending on my mood, or what I'm serving it with. I have onion chives and garlic chives in my garden as well as peppers and green onions that add good flavor. I have not tried the bacon or other kinds of potatoes as others have suggested, but I think I will!

My fiance thought this dish was really good. I steamed the potatoes as another reviewer suggested and I mixed the ranch, cheese and real bacon bits together with the potatoes. My fiance suggested cooking the potatoes longer next time. I didn't want the them to fall apart...but I will take that chance next time and I will slice them instead of cubing them and add green onion. I will also add more ranch dressing. I don't think I added enough(I didn't want to over do it). Overall this was a good recipe that I will make again.

hard to go wrong with these little potatoes, they were great. Do recommend to trim the bottoms so they stand up on the cookie tray. everyone loved them had to make a second batch just to get through dinner. Adding the bacon was a must.

These were absolutely the BEST potatoes that I have ever eaten!!!  I, too, sliced the potatoes and layered them in a casserole dish sprayed with butter-flavored Pam.  I used Kraft Fat-Free Sour Cream and Onion Ranch dressing, Pepperjack cheese, and real bacon bits.  We will use this recipe many, many times!  Thanks!!!   Tami

It was good but that's about it - you have to really love cheese and ranch to appreciate these - which I do.  I did them cassarole style like others suggested.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used Marie's Ranch dressing, not sure if I even used a full cup, just spooned the dressing ontop of the potatoes.  I thought it was so easy and quick to make and such a different twist for red potatoes.  I added more salt, well because I just like things salty.  I will definetly be making these again and next time, I will give the potatoes a dash of garlic powder.

This was okay, but I had to make substantial modifications.  I added much more pepper and seasoning than the recipe called for, and I used jalapeno cheddar jack cheese to give it some kick.  Making it into a casserole like some people here suggested definitely improved it.  I recommend using the cheese sparingly, and perhaps adding some fresh chives to the top.

I quartered the potatoes, used light ranch dressing, half of the cheese and addded crumbled bacon and sliced green onions.  This was a hit with my husband and kids.

Excellent, will definitely make again!  Would be great for kids who don't want to eat their veggies...though I may try making this with smaller cuts/bites of potato, cubing and then baking.  Still, very tasty!!

I thought they were pretty good.  I did add bacon and scallions to the top.  If I made them again, I might cut the potatoes smaller and pour the dressing over the top and make more of a potato casserole type dish. The flavor was better the day after.  thanks.

These were yummy and very easy! I made these with the buffalo shrimp recipe from this site. The flavors went together well. We will be having these often. I did this as a casserole. This would also be good with chopped green onions and bacon bits added.

I too followed the casserole method and it was a super easy recipe. I actually used normal baking potatoes and it turned out fine. Although my mother wasn't too fond of the recipe, I thought it to be quite good.

These were easy to make, but time-consuming. My husband isn't a big fan of ranch dressing, so he didn't like them much - I probably won't bother making them again. I thought they tasted good.

Yummy!!!  Nearly the best potatoes I've ever eaten.  My husband liked them too!  Easy to make, however next time I think I might try putting them in a casserole dish instead of on a cookie sheet.

I made this as twice baked potatoes and they were spectacular. 5 stars for flavor and ease. The ONLY thing I did differently (and did NOT change ingredients) was to use russets because I didn't have baby reds. Guests can add whatever they want on top at the table and the recipe stays the same, e.g., top with bacon bits, sour cream, sliced green onions, etc.

Seriously! I mean, just look at the ingredient list. They're delicious! 
My kids loved them, my hubby loved them, I loved them. No brainier that this one will go down in our rotation probably for more than just dinner potatoes too...brunch, lunch, snack, dinner. 
Thanks for sharing your simple yet awesome recipe!

This was a wonderful dish. I made some homemade ranch, and also quartered the potatoes like most of the other reviewers. I sauted some bacon, and onion and added it to the potatoes, ranch, and topped it with some monterey jack cheese. Baked it in a casserole for 10 minutes. DELICIOUS!! My teenage daughter went back and cleaned up the leftovers for lunch the next day!

Love these potatoes! We use them as a side with meat loaf or with any barbeque dish. The only change we make is instead of bottled ranch, I buy light sour cream and add a hidden valley ranch packet to make the ranch dip, then water it down with nonfat or 1% milk to make a light ranch that still tastes great! we use all the measured amounts in the recipe though.

I followed other reviewers and just cut the potatoes into quarters and put it all in a dish. It was much easier. Next time I will cut the potatoes into smaller cubes and add bacon. Everyone requested I add bacon! But still yummy.

Really good and super easy, used the ranch dressing from the refrigerator section.  Was really good, and even made for good leftovers the next day

I added a bit of onion, garlic salt, and bacon bits, but it just didn't go over well with the kids, the hubby, or myself.  The flavor of the ranch just wasn't right with the potatoes, I thought.  It may be better on just a plain russett- just an opinion!

Maybe there's a trick to it, but I couldn't get the toppings to stay on! That said, my husband and I had fun scooping it up off the plate onto each bite! The flavors complemented but were a bit too bland for me, I had to add extra ranch after the fact. Next time I'll season the potatoes themselves with some garlic powder and salt first, I think. Either way, fun and easy!

These were okay but really nothing special.  They reminded me a little of twice baked potatoes, but without the crispiness of the shell.

EXCELLENT  I cut the potatoes in chunks and used   Romano instead of Colby Jack.
I made them ahead and roasted them just before eating.

I actually loved this, and I am not a fan of cheese with potatoes(unless it is chili cheese fries) Maybe it was the type of cheese, instead of regular old cheddar or processed cheese...Thanks for this recipe will be doing again and often.

This was delicious!  My potatoes were medium-size, so I quartered them.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese on top instead of Colby-Monterey Jack.  Great side dish for grilled chicken!

I've made these a bunch of times, they're great!  I also cube the potatoes before boiling them.  I don't usually bother to measure the ranch dressing or cheese (I use whatever kind I have on hand).  I also usually sprinkle it with a Garlic & Herb spice, plus some other Italian seasonings.

I LIKED THE IDEA OF THIS RECIPE BECAUSE I LOVE RANCH DRESSING BUT I CHANGED IT UP A LITTLE. I CUT THE POTATOES IN SLICES AND LAYERED THEM IN A MICROWAVE SAFE CASSEROLE DISH AND MICROWAVED IT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES(STIRRING ABOUT HALF WAY THRU)

Tasted really good, but the cheese kept sliding off because of ranch dressing.  I usually eat them steamed and dressed at the table with a little butter and ranch.  Think I will stick to my way.  Less cleanup.

Really good!! I used ranch dip instead of dressing and added bacon bits. I might try it next time with small white or yellow potatoes, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe was a wonderful start to something outstanding.  Next time, I think I'll add some garlic powder and extra fresh ground black pepper to the ranch to spice it up a bit.

My family and I are big lovers of Ranch flavored meals and cooking with ranch.  This recipes gave the potatoes just the right amount of ranch to make the flavor soooooo good!

I loved these! Potatoes, ranch and cheese, my favorite things all in one. They looked cute and professionally made as well as tasting delicious. I cut the bottoms just slightly so they would sit up right.

This was really good, and very easy to make. I used Greggs ranch dressing from Costco, and four cheese blend cheese, It could have used bacon bits, but otherwise it was really great, lots of compliments!

These turned out so-so.  I didn't add the full cup of dressing, it seemed like way to much!  Maybe I will try again and see if they turn out any better.

Excellent recipe.  These are quick and easy to whip up after a hard days work.  It did take longer than 10 minuted to cook on the stove, but very much worth it.

it was pretty simple.  i had to cut off the bottoms of the potato so that it would stand upright without the cheese and ranch falling over though.

I didn't care too much for this recipe, although my fiancee said he liked it "ok".  I used a brand of Ranch dressing that I'm not too crazy about, so I may try it again with another brand.
