As written these were just okay. It's a great concept but the filling desperately lacked in flavor. The green chiles got lost in all of the cream cheese and it needed season salt or something. Normally I am all about fresh peppers but I think pickled would work better in this recipe. As a matter of fact, that might be the solution right there. Pickled would add the flavor and salt that the recipe is missing. These are adorable and sure to be the hit at a party if done right. My suggestion is to make as written but sub pickled jalapenos OR if you want to use fresh jalapeno slices I recommend adding some seasoning of choice to your cream cheese mixture. These have great potential and I definitely plan on making them again with some minor adjustments.
