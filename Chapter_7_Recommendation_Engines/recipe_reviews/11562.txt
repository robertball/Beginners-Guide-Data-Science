These cookies are delicious.  I did not have any shortening so I used 1 cup of butter.  They are truly an old fashioned delight.

These were great. The cookie itself is not so sweet, which I really like. The amount of black walnuts can be modified to suit personal tastes as can the cinnamon/sugar- my husband actually prefers them plain. This is a very tender, chewy cookie w/o a whole lot of flavor on it's own (but that's okay because the black walnut is the star here), so always, always, always use REAL butter.
