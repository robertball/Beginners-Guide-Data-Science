We like this!  It made the last of the chili powder that we had go farther.  Also - it tasted great and we thought the nutmeg was ingenious!  Thanks.

This is absolutely what I needed for today. I plan on using this on air popped popcorn and spicing up baked oyster crackers. Thank you so much for sharing this.

Don't skip the nutmeg--it's a "secret weapon" in a lot of savory recipes!

Easy!  Call it chili powder...taco seasoning...this one is multi-purpose.  BTW...I skipped the nutmeg because that just seemed out of place.

The first time I made this recipe, I used about half of it for chili that I entered into a chili cook off at my church - and it was a huge hit!  I kept the rest in an airtight container until it was time to make chili again. Well.....my husband found the container and thought that it was a meat rub, so he used it when he smoked a pork shoulder!  It was AWESOME!  If you like your barbecue with a bit of a kick - I highly recommend this as a rub for smoking meat!

It was great!  Thank you for the recipe.  However, it is for those who love hot chili.  I enjoyed so much and like the others will never go back to the packets again.  However,  I will cut down some of the peppers in the future.  I am kind of a medium hot person.  I saved this recipe to use again and again.

OMG!  Fabulous!  I have never received the compliments I did before I used this recipe.  Not for the spice wimps, though!  This has kick!
