It is pretty good. The morning I went to make it I found out I had miss read the recipe and did not freeze the coffee the night before. But I made it work and it actually cam out really good. I used sugar free hazelnut creamer, I used 60% dark chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder and used a few ice cubes. The end result was a banana flavored java chip frappe! It made my morning!

I found that I needed a couple more packets of Stevie. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. It was pretty good.

This reminds me of the Java Chip Frappe I used to get in Singapore, which was my favorite, way better then any Starbucks Frappe.  In Singapore, there's a little crunch from the Java chips. This recipe has the same little crunch. I'm not sure if it's from the frozen banana or cold coconut oil bits but it's good.

Make sure you read the entire recipe first before making it. I just made sure I had all the ingredients first, and was disappointed when I wanted to make it after a break from a hot afternoon in the garden when I found out that some of the coffee needs to be frozen. So I did that and was ready to make it in the evening. Then I found out that actually, only a total 1 3/4 cup of coffee is needed, not 3 cups, so I had extra.  Wasn't an issue since I just fed the extra to my plants, but next time, I'm just going to make 1 3/4 cup as needed just to save space.
