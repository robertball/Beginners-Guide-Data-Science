Step it up and add 1/2# ground chorizo , sauté first. Sharp cheddar is rarely used in Mexican dishes a milder cheese  is preferred 1/2 jack & 1/2 med cheddar are great. Also increase cheese to 1:2 cup.  I serve this with fried cubed red potatoes add minced red onion little garlic , salt and cayenne   Delish.

Used standard pie crust, layered canned chili strips over all of it. Used Jack Cheese the standard for Mexican dishes.  Used standard herbs and chopped olives.  It was much easier to cut through and serve neatly than the original recipe.

Love this recipe!! Will make again. I didn't have heavy cream so I used sour cream and was great. I used heirloom tomatoes and they really added to the flavor. My husband loved it!

This is very good. How “hot” or spicy it is depends on the chilies used. If you add a mild meat such as sausage, it decreases the heat a bit. I found that one large tomato was plenty. It can be either sliced or coarse lay chopped. I also increased the amount of cheese used. I baked it 40 minutes.

This quiche was a hit for Thanksgiving brunch!  The only change I made to the recipe was I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  It was not too spicy, it just added flavor.  I definitely will make this easy, and yummy, recipe again!

Made it last night, was really tasty, I added a teaspoon of chili power and about 1/2 lb of chicken breast I diced and sauteed before adding it, I think I had too much water left on the chili peppers though. Next time I'll dry them with a paper towel.

Subbed some different cheese and didn’t have cream so did light Daisy sour cream, also added mushrooms. Was pretty good but felt like it needed some sausage or bacon mixed in.

Sorry to those that don't like us recipe tweakers...but I do. I used lightly sauteed mushrooms in lieu of tomato's. Added a little 1/3 less fat cream cheese to go w/ the sharp cheddar. I also added a dash of Cayenne Pepper.  It sure filled up a Hatch Chile lined aluminum pie "tin".

I loved it, in spite of the difficulty of blistering the poblano peppers without a proper oven.  The 'crust is definitely worth the effort. 
The quiche reheats well.  My family made a Thanksgiving breakfast out of it.  I can't wait to try variations.

No changes this time, but I can see the possibility for lots of variations!  Might even add some extra green chiles.

Like another reviewer, I cooked up about a half pound of chorizo, tossing in the diced onion and a couple of smashed and diced garlic cloves into the pan. Drained off the fat and spread over the chili’s, topped it with the sliced tomatoes, extra cheese and egg mixture.  The tomatoes made it soggy, and if I make it again I would bake the tomato slices a bit first to release some of the moisture, or maybe even use sun dried.  It still is lacking in any zip in flavor. Next time maybe add cayenne or red pepper flakes.

Very good! I used Colby Jack mixture for the cheese. I mixed roasted poblano peppers with canned green chiles for the crust followed by tomatoes. Served with salad and home fries.
