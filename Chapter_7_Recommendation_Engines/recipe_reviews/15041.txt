This cheesecake is absolutely marvelous!  One of the reviewers (KIMAR) had trouble making the crust.  She thought the ratio of crumbs to butter was off.  I think her oven was off.  I have made this numerious times and NEVER had a problem with the crust.  To the reviewer who said they had a problem with the top cracking, this happens with most cheescakes that get overbaked.  Always watch your cheesecake when there is 5-10 minutes left in the baking process.  Cheesecake is done when the center is set (sort of looks like Jello).  Overall, this recipe is terrific on ease & taste.  I don't think KIMAR knows the first thing in baking cheesecakes.  It takes a lot of practice.  And this one is a great one to start with!  I also followed other people's reviews and garnished with chocolate and caramel sauce.  I then sliced snickers and placed them around the edge!  What a professional look!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This was delicious!  I wanted a thicker cheesecake so I added an extra package of cream cheese and an extra egg, extra 1/4 cup sugar, a bit more chopped Snickers bar to compensate.  My 9 inch springform had broken during our move a couple months ago, so I had to use an 8 inch.  It made a very tall, but lovely, cheesecake.  Just had to bake it about 20 minutes longer.  Left it in the oven for about 2 hours after I turned it off.  Garnished with mini Snickers bars and Praline Sundae Topping from this site.  Very delicious, and a great dessert for Thanksgiving!

About the crust:  The ratio of crumbs to butter is off.  It seemed rather dry, as if there wasn't enough butter in it, but I made the mistake of trusting the recipe rather than my own instincts.  After only 8 minutes in the oven, I began to smell it burning.  Indeed, my crust was very burnt and had to be thrown out.  I found several other cheesecake recipes with graham cracker crusts that used more butter in the crust and didn't bake the crust, just refrigerated it until the batter was ready to be poured over it.  So I remade the crust, using an additional 1 tablespoon of butter and didn't bake the crust, just refrigerated it until I was ready to pour the batter in.  That seemed to work well.  However, I was disappointed in this cheesecake.  It was rather flat, resembling a pie more than a cheesecake.  A rather disappointing outcome after having to remake the crust after it burned.

Very yummy!  I wish I had added a little more butter to the crust, it turned out very crumbly and made a mess when serving it.  I added more Snickers to the batter, made a milk chocolate glaze for the top and sprinkled chopped peanuts over that.  I used whipped cream, caramel sauce, and sliced Snickers for a garnish.  It was beautiful and delicious, despite the messy crust! Oh, and light cream cheese works great for this recipe!

Made this for the family as one of 12 desserts for Thanksgiving dinner.  Let's just say that it only lasted aobut 12 minutes before the serving tray was wiped clean!  It has already been requested for Christmas! Excellent with just a couple of modifications.  As stated in other cheesecake reviews, make sure that all of the ingredients are at room temperature before starting and that the cheesecake has time to sit overnight in the fridge.

I changed it a little.Because the first time I made it the cake was so thin and cracked even though I used a hot water bath.My niece and I made the changes following :  5 (8z) cream cheese, 5 eggs, 1 1/4 c sugar,1T vanilla and 4 snicker bars. We bake it for 50 minutes shut off the oven and cracked the door for ten minutes. Then we cool it on top of the stove covered for an hour, before putting it in the fridge. It turned out beautiful. The snickers did weep abit, which kept me from giving it 5 stars.I think it is a good basic recipe you could make( with a few changes) your own.

Great Recipe...with about 5 minutes to go, i turned off the heat and let the cheescake cool in the oven as suggested elsewhere in this site. It worked great, with no cracking at all. Garnished the top with some additional Snickers Pieces and swirled caramel and chocolate syrup on top. Thanks for the great idea!

This is the second time I have made this in 2 weeks.  Reason being that someone loved it so much they wanted me to make one for them to take to a holiday party..I received so many compliments!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and added carmel and more chopped snickers bars to the top.  The cheesecake is not overly sweet which is what makes this works.  I also put mine in a water bath.  Will I make again ABSOLUTELY!!!!

Move over Cheesecake Factory! This cheesecake is sinfully rich. I drizzled caramel topping and hot fudge sauce on top, and topped with whipped cream to make it an over the top dessert! I made it for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it.

Good cheesecake. It was relatively easy to make. It might be better with one more Snickers bar. Also,don't bake it too long. Mine was a bit rubbery.

I really like this recipe! I have made it a few times now. I now  make a few personal modifications (chocolate graham crackers instead of regular, 1 tsp more butter and more snickers)now that I have become a "pro" at making this recipe.

Excellent recipe! I made it for my boyfriends birthday - what a hit! I forgot the sugar for the crust, but it still came out fine. I used Snickers bars - I put two in with the mix and sliced another one to put on top (like in the picture). I used Smucker's caramel ice cream topping and drizzled it over the top. Nothing but rave reviews from everyone there (and there definitely no leftovers).

This was wonderful! My mom had asked for a Snicker's cheesecake for her birthday, and I was afraid there wouldn't be a recipe. I drizzled some caramel on top to make it extra-sweet. Be sure and cool before you eat, though. It makes it much better.

This is great! I added an extra Snickers to the mix and another chopped up Snickers on top for topping.  The other change I made was to use chocolate cookie crumbs instead of graham crackers so it had a chocolate crust. Yum!

I didn't even let it bake the full amount of time called for, and I still over baked it. Next time I'll try letting it bake even shorter. Can't really give it an accurate number of stars 'cause I don't know how it would've been.

Wow! I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but this recipe could very well make me one.  It's incredibly easy and tastes great.  First cheesecake I ever made, and I'll be making this again a lot!  Followed recipe as is and topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  It's tooooo good!

This is great!  I had bought a ready made 9 inch crust so I cut it scaled the servings back for 8.  Then decided to add that whole second bar to the batter.

Awesome awesome awesome!!! First time my cheesecake didn't crack, an I didn't even have to use a water bath!! I mixed the cream cheese furiously before adding the sugar then beat the heck out of it. Also, note to self, beat eggs until yolk has just dissapeared from sight. The only 'problem' I had with this recipe was the candy; I cut my own fun sized snickers an added too many, which detracted from the actual cheesecake flavor. I also used a [[hazel]]nut crust, which was yumm. Will def. use this as a base as I love that it didn't use sour cream or whipping cream. THANKS for the idea!!! =o)

What an excellent cheesecake! It is perfect no matter what you add to it, but Snickers are great. I have been experimenting and using other types of candy bars, like Caramellos, Aero, and even mini M&Ms, and all the combinations with this cheesecake just can't go wrong. The basic cheesecake this makes never fails. Awesome!

This was a great and easy recipe- and the first cheesecake that I ever made.  They don't sell graham crackers here in Chile, so I substituted chocolate cookies and took advantage of the availability of manjar (dulce de leche) to make the design on the top.  The cake only cracked a little bit where the manjar was, probably because I didn't use a bath for lack of another pan. I put some more manjar on the plate before serving to jazz it up a bit. Overall, delicious!

This was one of 2 cheesecakes I made for Easter. This was my first-ever baked cheesecake and it cracked badly. To hide it I frosted it  by mixing 6 melted Baker's chocolate squares and 1/2 a cup of light sour cream. I then garnished the edge with cut dark chocolate Snickers pieces. I had added candy pieces also to the batter and used an Oreo crust instead of graham crackers. It looked great once frosted and was a HUGE hit, especially with the kids! I also used dental floss to cut it after overnight refrigeration. Worked wonderfully! I will make this again and again!

I thought that the actual cheesecake was good, but the crust along the bottom was a little dry and crumby with these measurements....next time I will add a little more butter and sugar.....overall, we enjoyed the cake and will be making it again....thanks!!

not too bad, though incredily rich cos i decided to go over the top and added more snickers. will follow the recipe next time. But the nuts made the chesscake really good, and i used a ready made crumb crust and made a cheesecake pie instead!

I added an extra half package of cream cheese and baked the cheesecake an extra 15 minutes and it still was not enough - maybe my oven is not as hot as the average, however I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because although good - it was not great. I think the broken up pieces of candy bar would have been better if they were smooth instead of in pieces. Very good, very rich recipe. easy to make as well. Thanks!

Made this cheesecake for the family - was stunning and everyone loved it.  I substituted the graham cracker crumbs for peanut cookies (or peanut butter cookies would be great) and added 2-3 TBSP. of cocoa powder and an extra TBSP of butter.  Finished it with ganache topping and sliced snickers bar on top.

Personally this was too sweet for me... but my husband LOVED it!!!  And that's the important thing.:-)  I made it for him for Valentine's Day this year.  It mixed his two favorite things cheese cake and Snickers.  The whole thing was gone in 3 days and I only had 1 piece! He ate the rest! Thanks for the recipe.  And Scott thanks you too.

Very good.  Took it to an Easter gathering and everyone loved it.  Think I may add one more candy bar the next time.  Cake got a horrible split down the middle and also sank after I took it out of the oven.  Anyone have a good explanation why and how I can prevent this the next time?  Thanks.

Easy and cake tasted great. My snickers either sunk or disappeared. I can’t find them. LOL. I didn’t have an issue with the crust ratio ingredients. I made it as written.  My cake cracked but I spooned salted caramel topping over the cake and decorated with chopped snickers. Family liked this one.

Great recipe. I did use 5 tablespoons of butter to make the crust. I also used 2 chopped Snickers bars in the batter and chopped one for the top. Drizzled some carmel and chocolate syrup just before serving. Everyone loved it!

My friends and family die for this. I have made so many different chocolate bar varieties and they are all amazing. Easter time I make it with mini eggs and it's out of this world. Caramilk, Jersey Milk and Dairy milk are also some of my favorites versions. To die for!

Was very easy to make. I made a oreo crust. Cake did crack, very disappointing.  Was very creamy.  Chopped Snickers all floated to the bottom.  Can anyone tell me how to avoid that for future cakes?   Thanks for the recipe, will try again.

This recipe is great! Instead of using chocolate caramel candies I used homemade caramel and semisweet chocolate. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds and even thirds.

Wow.  I have tried cooking cheesecake before but never seemed to get it "perfect."  I brought this to a dinner party, and even though the crust was slightly burnt, everyone went crazy for it!  Definitely my new dish to impress friends!

We used 3 snickers bars and chopped one up to put on the top when there was about 5 minutes left of cooking time.We did add 2 tbs of extra butter(seemed very dry) and the crust turned out great.Also,we used 1 bar of 'light'cream cheese.We thought it would be a very sweet cheesecake,but were surprised it wasn't..it was perfect! Give it a try:)

Very popular. Everyone loved it. I might have used more butter to make the crust stick to the sides more. I also used 3 regular sized Snicker's bars.

This was wonderful, and so easy!  I added an extra half of a snicker bar to the filling, and also chopped one up to sprinkle over the top.  We also drizzled caramel over the top.  I did have trouble with the top cracking, but it didn't change the fact that it was delicious!  Everyone agreed this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks Nancy

This cake was very good and had a great texture. I added a third chopped up snickers bar as a garnish on top.  It was very firm and easy to remove from the pan.  very good recipe.

Realy really delicious; the snicker bars melt to taste wonderful in the cheesecake.  I even used the recipe to make several mini (individual) cheesecakes and they were fantastic.  Thank you!!! :)

Everyone loved this at my early Christmas party.  It was pretty easy to make and the crumbs seemed like they didn't want to stick but worked out perfectly once the cheesecake was baked. I added a carmel sauce spread all over the cheesecake.  YUM!

Great recipe! It was super easy. Just add extra butter to the graham crackers if they seem too dry and don't want to stick.

This was my first attempt at any type of cheesecake and it was very simple and easy to achieve.  I delivered the finished product to my co-workers for a holiday treat and the entire cake was gone before lunchtime!!!  A very delicious and impressive cheesecake.  P.S. The Chocolate syrup and caramel topping gives it a professional appearance. Great idea!!!
