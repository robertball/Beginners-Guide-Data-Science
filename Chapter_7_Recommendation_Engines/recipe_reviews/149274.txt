I guess to have an appreciation for these...you have to have spent some time in Switzerland. They are sticky, but they are FABULOUS!! Love 'em!! These are for a more sophisticated palat. You must let them set in your mouth, chew them slowly. Then your taste buds wake up and say WOW!!!

this recipe is fine but there's a very important step missing!!

once you have dough - put between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap and roll out to 1cm.  refrigerate for a good 30min and THEN cut . . .  no onder carol found them a sticky mess . . .  

instead of orange juice, add 1/4 c finely chopped citron tossed in a little flour . . . they you'll get the real flavor of 'totebeinli'

I always make mine the night before and let them rest on the pan before baking.  Totenbeidli actually means "little dead legs".  I have not tried this particular recipe for them but I highly recommend totenbeindlis in general.
