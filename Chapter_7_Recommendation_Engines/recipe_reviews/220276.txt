I didn't have asparagus either so like previous poster I used peas and also added broccoli, which was delicious.  I used an alfredo sauce from a package which only made a cup and it disappeared into the pasta when I mixed it (see picture) but the flavour was still fantastic.  My family loved the slight lemony taste, it wasn't overpowering but it was a departure from the usual alfredo I make.  I also used linguine cause I didn't have rotini, would have been better with rotini.  Oh, I only gave four stars cause I think it would be improved with fresh spinach instead of frozen for real spinach lovers.

I've made this twice now.  I used Oliveri's alfredo sauce from safeway and it was fantastic.  The second time I didn't have any asparagus so I used frozen peas and just sort of cooked them till the spinach was wilted.  It was delicious and everyone in my family liked it.  Looked fancy!
