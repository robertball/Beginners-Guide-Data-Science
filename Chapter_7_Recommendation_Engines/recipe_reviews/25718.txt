This was easy and excellent. I used fresh mushrooms and fresh peas in place of the canned ones, but otherwise followed the recipe  exactly and served it over warm biscuits....excellent!  Everyone loved it.  I'm sending the recipe to my daughters and friends.

A dish will lack flavor if you DO NOT put seasoning in it. The recipe is fine. Cooking is subjective. Everyone's kitchen pantry is different. Add seasonings and spices to YOUR liking! If you taste your food as you cook you will know if you need to add more seasoning or not. If you want garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, bay leaf or whatever you like...throw it in! Have fun cooking! You and your familiy are the ones eating it :0)

I beg to differ with the reviewer who stated that this dish was gross. Hardly. As a matter of fact, it was very good. Changed things up just a tad. I used fresh mushrooms, red and green pepper, no peas (oldest daugher doesn't care for them) and once the vegies were tender, I then added the flour to make a roux. I used one cup of skim milk, one cup of fat free half and half and a half cup of chicken stock. I seasoned quite a bit more than suggested and added a little more sherry than stated. I bought a couple of tubes of Pillsbury Italian bread and made four bread bowls to hold and serve the chicken. kids and hubby got a kick out of it and devoured this dish. Thanks Diana!

This was 'OK'.  Nothing special.  A little bland and it started to look more like a veggie dish than a chicken dish.  Next time I'd cut either the green pepper or celery completely out.

This is one recipe I will not make again.  No flavor except peppers.  Much too bland.

Very good recipe!  I made this mostly as is, but left out a few things due to personal taste.  First,  I didn't use celery, because Mom never did when she made this, and I left out the peas since my hubby is allergic to them!  I also left out the egg yolks because a lot of reviewers said the sauce was too thick, and without them it was perfect!  The sherry is a requirement in this, and for those reveiwers that said it gave the dish a bad taste- they probably used the cooking sherry you buy at the grocery store!  NEVER use the wines from the grocery store- only use what you what put in a glass!  Yummy, comforting dish!

Great taste!!!!! I forgot to put in the Sherry and it was still delicious.  I'm sure the Sherry would add that something special.  Will definitely make it again.

For the sake of the dieters in my family, I used skimmed milk and replaced high-fat egg yolks with no-fat sour cream.  Left out the sherry, too.  Despite the subs, this had a really lovely, delicate flavor - big hit.  Has already been requested for another go round, this time replacing the chicken with shrimp - sounds good!  :D

Given the great reviews and the combination of ingredients, I thought we would love this.  We didn't.  I can't believe, given all of ingredients that it includes, how little taste this dish had.  Not worth the effort, I am afraid.  We won't make again.  Sorry!

Husband gave this dish a thumbs-up and took a second helping.  Unlike a couple of other reviewers, I did not find this dish lacking in flavor...  However, please note: even though I was intending to cut the recipe in half, I used the stated amount of both the cooking sherry and paprika as given in recipe.  This was a satisfying recipe.  Thx Diana!

Very fresh tasting.  Used 2 chicken breasts to equal the 2 cups diced chicken (I never like trying to convert cups of chicken--number of breasts is always easier).  Also used frozen peas instead of canned for added nutritional value.  I would suggest serving this over rice or would be perfect over a puff pastry or as the filling of pot pie.

Loved this! The only thing I did different was use fresh baby bella mushrooms and frozen peas. I also think that pearl onions would be nice in this. I also doubled it, so you will need a pretty large skillet. Great on a cold, rainy day.

This was great!  I made 1/2 the recipe with a few minor changes.  I used fresh mushrooms and frozen peas instead of canned.  Instead of celery, I used 1/2 a red bell pepper and replaced the pimentos with 1/2 a jalapeno -- great for those who like a bit more spice -- (sauteed with the other vegetables, not added in at the end).  I served it over biscuits ("E-Z Drop Biscuits" from this site).

Very good. I subbed canned spinach for green beans and added more spice - pepper sauce and garlic powder. Served over vermicelli and topped with parmesan cheese.

Very good but a little mild flavored. You might want to add a little pepper to perk it up.
