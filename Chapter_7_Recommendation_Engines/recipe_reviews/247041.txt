I added a small twist as I prefer it a little sweeter. I sauteed the SPAM and finish it with 1T of pure VT maple syrup. It was delicious.

I used my own pancake recipe and added tiny bits of cubed spam. Loved the sweet/savory taste with real Vermont maple syrup as well. I think this is the ideal camping treat and it's on my list to make next long weekend when we are out in the Colorado mountains. Thank you!!! So delicious and worthy of a 5star rating.
