I didn't peel my zucchini prior to making zoodles and they were delicious with the marinara. A perfect summertime meal served with garlic bread. Equally good topped with Parmesan or mozzarella.

This was just ok.  Waaaaay too much garlic; so much so that my wife couldn't even eat it. If I make this again, I'd cut the garlic in half. I might also ever so slight boil the zucchini to make it a little less crunchy. Not my favorite spiralizing recipe.

My first time spiralizing and it turned out great. I was surprised the marinara was so good, I'd never made a marina sauce before. The directions leave out the heating step. I added cooked chicken while it heated on the stove. Mushrooms would be good to add and so would green peppers. The second time I made this with ground beef. I'm not sure what I did differently with the sauce but it was very strong tomato-tasting so I added a tablespoon or two of Italian seasoning.

I added mushrooms to my sauce because I like them and I also like to cook my zucchini noodles but other than that it's a simple tasty quick meal

This a great meal - like others, I added mushrooms, cooked chicken.  Not sure why simple syrup is included - sugar is needed.
