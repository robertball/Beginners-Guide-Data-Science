I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I had extra pumpkin puree (from a can) so thought this cake sounded like it could be good.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The cardamom was completely overpowering for my taste, although my husband did like it.   The texture is not light and fluff like cakes normally are, instead, it's heavy and dense.  I thought the taste was better with fresh whipped cream or ice cream.  One more thing, the cake was in the oven for 45 minutes before the knife came out clean.  I don't envision baking this again, but I appreciate the recipe..

This is not really sweet and pretty dense. Nobody has touched it since our first taste.

I really liked this recipe. I loved that is really moist and that it's not too sweet. There's a good balance of flavors. My in laws who are French and aren't used to too many pumpkin based cakes, absolutely loved it too.

I thought this turned out rather well, and I did mess up.  I baked at 350, not 300. Perhaps the recipe submitter's oven runs hot or she has a convection oven.  bc 300 would never work in my oven!  I baked for 40 minutes, and it wasn't done, so I meant to add another 20 mins on the timer.  I somehow forgot to set it or something, bc some time later I realized I hadn't heard the timer in at least a half hour, maybe 40 mins and ran to check on the cake.  Weirdly, it was fine.  Perfectly baked--maybe a tad dry, but hey, whatever--and not burned at all.  I thought it turned out well.  Bf didn't comment on the cardamom--and believe me, he would have if it was too much for him; he has before!--and I thought it was a perfect amount.  His only comment was that his first bite of apple was a tad sour--I guess one apple piece was a bit much, but the rest were fine.  So my only advice would be to 1.  Remember to set the timer!  You might not be lucky like I was and 2.  Make sure your apples are sweet, not sour.  Thanks for the recipe!  A nice, almost coffee type cake.  :o)

Obediently i baked 300 degrees for 40 minutes, then 20 minutes more, then jacked it up to 350 and baked for another 25 minutes. After all that, it had just gone golden around the edges, and just a bit soft in the center.
