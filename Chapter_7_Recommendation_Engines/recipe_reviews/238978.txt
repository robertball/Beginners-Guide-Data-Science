These were great even though I was tired and forgot the onions (gasp!). I will definitely be making these on a regular basis. The only change I made because bread is an absolute NO, I used pork rind crumbs which are wonderful for breading or in meatloaves, etc.

Yummy. I used almond meal and it has a nice taste.. it did turn out rather soft with this. I served my patties with sriracha and cream cheese. Not sure how Paleo  that is but I liked it

These were a nice change in my gluten free diet. A much needed comfort food and so easy to make. I was in such a hurry to make them I forgot the lemon juice but they were very good anyway. I didn't make any changes except the parsley was freeze dried and as previously mentioned left out lemon juice.
I served these with Dill Sauce from this website and apple-carrot salad. This is a definite addition to my GF recipes.

It has been a long time since Iâ€™ve made these.  Thought they were good but a little dry which could be more my fault than the recipe s.  Will try it again.

Not bad but I think I over cooked them. They came out way to dry.  I need an easy paleo sauce to put on top for moisture. If anyone has any suggestions please comment! Thanks!

Super easy meal idea! Great taste too. We needed to add lots of lemon juice after they were done cooking because they came out a little dry but still really good. This on is a keeper!
