Loved this not only for its taste, but also for its beauty and simplicity. Rather than tossing all the ingredients together, I eliminated the iceberg lettuce from the mix and plated the salad on large, beautiful butter lettuce leaves.  Once my lobster was cooked, shelled and chopped  I realized I wouldn't have enough so I quickly boiled some frozen shrimp to compensate and it was a wonderful combination.  I liked the warm lobster against the cool tomato and creamy avocado, and the seafood seasoning blended with the butter proved to be a nice change from a typical salad dressing.  This, served with "Cream of Tomato Soup with Pesto," made for a delicious, healthy, and light but satisfying meal.  On a side note, I didn't use the feta because hubs doesn't like it, and I had intended to substitute some crumbled bacon instead. It's only as I write this review that I realize I forgot the bacon and I know that would have been awesome good!  Oh well, next time...

Excellent salad but a bit too salty so I would put less seasoning unless I just put in the wrong one but I used old bay seasoning...

Beautiful, gourmet, tasty, easy, impressive, filling!  I was concerned about the flavor with no added salad dressing and it truly didn't need any!  I had to use cooked, diced shrimp because my store didn't have lobster.  I will defineatly make this again. I'll try adding a few more things next time just to play around with it.  For some reason I craved a squeeze of lemon over the top. I may try that next time!

This was really good. I used two lobster tails, chopped the meat, and cooked it in the butter with the seafood seasoning. I used spinach, parmesan, and I added green onion.

I did not care for this. I served it at a cookout. We liked all the individual items in the salad, but they did not complement each other.
