This was wonderful! My husband just kept raving about it over and over. I did make some changes, (only because I was going to be gone all day), I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb Italian sausage, casing removed. I browned this with the onion and added the garlic at the end for 30 seconds. I then put everything into the Crock Pot and let it cook on low for 8 hours. After 6 hours I added the beans. It had too much liquid for our taste so I added 2 tbsp of corn meal and let it cook ok high for another 30 minutes with the lid off. It was soooooo good.
Chef John please let me know if you have a cookbook because I would buy it in a heartbeat. I love your recipes. I very rarely change them ( except to make it gluten free). Thank you

I have made this nearly a dozen times, but a few important tips.

1st. Using thin tomato puree (liquidy rather then pasty) works best, if that isn't possible go VERY easy on tomato (less then recipe says, 2/3 maybe even half if its thick puree), it washes out too much complexity and makes it oddly tangy otherwise.
2nd. the original Blog post by Chef John had 2 tsp of paprika rather then 1, keep that in mind when adjusting spices to preference.  I use 2tsp Hungarian 
3rd. THE BEER: I consider it very important to use a bitter beer with this, i prefer either neutral-bitter (not too much malt) high ABV IPA or a bitter, above average quality bitter lager.  If neither of those are available a cheaper dark larger (mexican) works very well.  Do not use something very malty, ever, find your favorite dry or hoppier beer and work with those. 

On 4th time cooking it i started adding a few tablespoons of brown sugar at the end, if you do this then don't over-do it, but this can add really nice flavor mix where chili has a 4 part sweet to bitter to meaty to savory on every bite.   Hard for novice cook like me to describe but very addictive if you nail it.

I will definitely be making this chili again. Made this last night and loved it. My hubby also said that this is definitely a "keeper" to make again.  

The only changes I made was do to a lack of certain ingredients. Instead of Pinto beans, I substituted 1 cup of black/turtle beans and 1 cup of navy beans, both were pressure cooked. I used about 2 tablespoons of rough chopped Herdez chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, instead of the poblano peppers.   

I found the flavors very well balanced, and I would consider this dish a medium to medium plus spicyness.  It doesn't tear your head off. 

Excellent chili, Thank you Chef John

We recently had a chili competition at work and I love Chef John's recipes so I decided to make this.  The cinnamon was SO overpowering!  Hard to believe just 1/8 t would be that strong.  And with so little tomato product it was like beef soup with cinnamon.  I ended up adding two more cans of tomato sauce AND a jar of salsa but still at work during the blind tasting everyone was saying "what is that- it is cinnamon- oh I don't like that" and of course I lost big time (only one vote and that was the boss who had to vote for everyone to be PC).  Sorry John I love your recipes but this one is a no go.

This is my new go-to chili recipe. Small changes... I used canned tomato sauce instead of  the paste, a small can of the diced green chili peppers instead of the poblano, and  substituted a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans for the pintos. The cayenne can be overpowering so dial it back if you don't do spicy. I have made this with a couple different kinds of beer and i think it can make a difference to the overall flavor. The best one so far: vanilla porter!  Dark and rich, yum.

Made this many times now...family favorite! A few minor variations/notes: 1) I use petite sirloin steaks, minced, instead of buying ground beef 2) cut down the cayenne by 1/3 to 1/2 if your family can’t handle the heat 3) be aware that some stores (incorrectly) sell poblano chiles as pasilla chiles

I made just a few changes based on what I had in my kitchen:

1.I used regular Chili Powder instead of Ancho Chilie Powder
2.I didn't measure out the Poblano Pepper, I just used the whole thing
3.I had one can of Light Kidney Beans and one can of Dark Kidney Beans.

Overall I'd say the recipe is good, but when I make it again I'll definitely make some changes. My partner and I both agreed that there was something missing. (We served it with mashed potatoes and cheese).

I  used a lighter beer (Blue Moon) for this recipe, and I think that was a mistake. This Chili needs something either hoppier or darker, or the flavor of the beer doesn't pop.

I will definitely search out Ancho Chili Powder for my next go (I'm moving, so I'm lacking time to look for it. Chili is a good way to save time as well as using up cans of beans so I don't have to move them :P).

I think this would also be amazing with Chorizo instead of ground beef to up the flavor profile.

I will say that I definitely LOVED the addition of cinnamon to the recipe. It added something to Chili that I never knew was missing! I'm also very glad I used a whole Poblano Pepper. It simplifies the recipe, and tasted quite delicious.

I'll update when I make it again :)

Definitely a keeper! Chef John is always spot on! I put this on the stove for my family to eat while I ran errands. I came home to an almost empty pot (I had doubled the recipe too- I really wanted leftovers!). I used dried chipotle pepper also, and instead of oil, I browned the beef in bacon fat. I was raised by a southern mom that taught me to always have it in the fridge. ;) Enjoy!

I liked it very much.  I don't particularly care for the Ancho Chili, so I just used ordinary chili powder and a bit of chipotle.  Very good.  I served it with "Sweet Cornbread Cake" recipe by myfoursonsks  here on allrecipes.  delicious recipe as well, I won't make any other cornbread recipe ever again, but this one.  I always eat the leftovers for breakfast!

I made this, but it didn't have much taste. Normally I love chef John's recipes, don't know what happened here. I had to add chili pepper, a beef bouillon cube and also some Worcestershire sauce to it!

Made as written. Very good flavor.  We didn't cut back on the heat, and liked it. This chili might be to hot and spicy for some people so give that some thought if feeding those who only enjoy mildly seasoned food. Thank you, Chef John!

Yummy!  So instead of water-which blew my mind-I used black coffee, tomato paste and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  And I got a nice dark beer too. Thank you for the recipe from my family to yours!

I’ve been making this chili recipe for several years now - despite occasionally trying others, I keep coming back to this one. The beer adds a great flavor. It’s great as written, but it’s very amenable to substitutions. I’ve used turkey instead of beef, only 1 lb of meat and an extra can of beans, that random half a jar of tomato sauce in the fridge in place of the canned tomatoes...whatever you do, it will taste good!  I like to squeeze in some fresh lime juice when it’s done cooking, then garnish with shredded cheddar, plain Greek yogurt, and diced avocado.

I've made this several times. Exactly as the recipe states, except for the ancho chile powder or the poblano pepper. I never seem to have that. I've substituted jalapeño but I don't worry about it too much. I've tried regular beer and a dark German beer. The dark beer seems to really play well the flavors. My husband says he can tell when I use different beer. This is a definite keeper.

Thanks Chef John. Everyone really liked the beer and the cinnamon. I used chunks of beef sauteed in oil and let them cook in the sauce without the beans for about an hour before adding the beans and finishing the recipe.

Yummy! The only changes I made was to use dried beans that I cooked first before adding to the recipe instead of canned beans and to leave out the poblano peppers The next time I make this chili I plan to decrease the chili powder and cumin. The flavor was great but we can't take the heat!

We liked it. Never cooked with beer before. Next time will most likely cut the Cayenne by half to tone down the heat for our taste preference.

I loosely followed the recipe. basically made my normal chilli and added the spices I don't always use. Awesome combination of spices that one normally would not think of with a chilli recipe. way better the next day after everything melds together.

Had to modify this a bit with regards to seasonings based on what I had on hand and based on personal tastes. It was *fantastic* even though I skipped or substituted at least 5 ingredients. I did not use the cocoa or cinnamon (sorry, but YUCK) and I used plain ol’ chili powder rather than ancho powder. I used seasoned black beans, and made the tomato purée with canned diced tomatoes. Despite all the ingredient changes, I followed  the cooking instructions to the letter and I think that was a deciding factor in the finished product. I will make this again and experiment more with the seasonings. This is a great basic chili recipe that you can play with and make your own. Loved it!

Tastey recipe.  You don't really taste the beer a whole lot, which for us is good.  Great chili for those that don't like mushrooms & chunky tomatos in the chili!

Made as instructed. I guess I’m use to a different type of chili. Needed more tomato flavor I think. Still ate it. Tasty if you don’t think of it as chili. Put it over past.

The only minor change I made, for materials on hand, was 50-50 ground pork and ground beef. Note - Peney's Chili Powder is exactly the same ingredients as The Chef's blend!

I think that I didn’t cook the beer taste out as much as I liked. The peppers made a difference in the taste and I added black beans, kidney beans , and mushrooms to mine ! Kids loved it served with cheese Jalapeño corn bread and a dap of sour cream on top??

I’ve made chili a million times, many different ways over the years, but when I saw that Chef John had a recipe, I just had to try his. I don’t care for cinnamon in my machaca so decided to skip it here as well. Also, I didn’t have any cocoa powder but I love mole so I will add it the next time. I had all of the other ingredients on hand except the poblano pepper so used a can of green chilies instead, as I’m sure that was close enough. I love the flavor of beer in chili and was very happy with how this turned out. Will definitely make again.

Chef John, you’ve done it again!! I’m vegetarian, so used Morningstar Farms Veggie Grillers crumbles. Also added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, per another reviewer. Other than that, followed it to the letter! Delicious!!

Recently made this chili using the ground beef I received from a 1/4 cow purchase with friends. The recipe as is is excellent, but when I make it again I will use less salt, more peppers (adding a partially seeded And diced chipotle)for spice, and possibly substitute a second dark beer for 12oz of water for additional taste.

The beer I used was Honey Brown Lager. This chili was subtly spicy, but sweet. It was hot enough to make you breathe through your nose, but not spicy enough to make you freak out with heat. I also added Masa just to thicken it up some more, added some shredded cheese to my liking. Made it look like a flower with Fritos Scoops. Used those to scoop it at first, beautiful taste.

My families favorite chili recipe! I highly recommend using 14 oz of beer instead of 12 oz and I also add a jalapeno which doesn't make it spicy but just gives an extra kick.

I did make two changes, one I never use any form of ground meat in chili. I have a collection of great chili recipes, this one among them & they all called for them beef to be cut into anywhere from 1/2 to 1 inch chunks of meat, I happen to prefer 3/4 inch chunks of beef.  BTW, I take a bout a cupful of the liquid & mix the the cumin in it when I know that the meat is tender, make a pasty sort of liquid & stir it back into the chili in the pot & simmer it for about 30 to 40 minutes more, so that the cumin tastes done & there's no raw taste.  This is an excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

Always a crowd pleaser.  I’ve made it twice now and it is great every time.  I sub venison over beef, because it is leaner and we think it tastes better.  It is also fun to serve someone that “thinks” they don’t like wild game.

Tasted amazing. Followed recipe very closely.  Used Warsteiner for the beer. Minor substitutions, ground vinison for the ground beef, full cup of poblano instead of 3/4 - happen to be what I got out of two - and beef stock for the water. Will make again!  Thanks Chef John

So easy to make. And cheap on the wallet. Delicious and nutritious, makes a wonderful meal for lunch or dinner. 
It calls for beer and I used Rickards Red, and followed all instructions.  I can honestly say this was the best chili I have ever had.

I love this chili recipe. Hands down the best I have made. I do make a couple changes. I don't care for ground beef much, so I only use 1 lb. I add 8-16 ounces of diced mushrooms  (as a sub for the rest of the ground beef). I also use an extra can of beans and beef consomme instead of water.  Smoked paprika instead of regular if I have it on hand. My husband and I both agree that it's even better the second day after the flavors have a chance to meld.

Excellent recipe and loved the flavour!  Came in 3rd place at my chili cook-off.  Some of the comments were there were no veggies in it.  I would add some green peppers etc in next time.  Definite keeper.

I’m giving this a five star rating even though I did not make the recipe as written. I couldn’t get out of the house to get all the ingredients due to snow but used the spices to make my own version. The spice combo really provided a great base for whatever you have on hand. Next time will make it as written to compare.

I am so surprised that as a chef that you don't season the meat with your chili powder before you brown it. I am also a chef  I would never eliminate that.

I didn’t use cocoa or beer but did add a can of diced tomatoes which stretches it. Served with German spatzle egg noodles and dinner buns on the side and chocolate cake for dessert. Everyone liked it.

My husband and I loved this chili! I may have added just a tad more chili powder and diced poblano pepper, but other than that...didn't change a thing. We topped it with crushed tortilla chips and grated cheddar/monterey jack. Perfect! Thanks Chef John!

This was a great chili.  I did have a few substitutions as I used what I had on hand.  Instead of pinto beans I used a mix of black beans and bayos.  Instead of poblanos I used jalapeños.  Instead of tomato puree I used a small can of tomato paste and a small container of tomato condimente (similar to sauce).
Was a hit for the family!  Will definitely make again.

This is not your traditional chili. It is more like a "Cincinnati" chili (like Skyline) due to the addition of cocoa and cinnamon. It is very good, just be aware.

Fantastic chili recipe and hearty just the way I like!  I made as written, but made a larger batch, so my ratios may have been off.  I also didn't have the peppers, so I diced a red pepper instead.  Recipe had a great flavor although we had to spice it up a bit since we didn't have the peppers.  Will definitely be making again.

The changes were: I put in just one tin of beans, which was enough, and I didn't use Poblano or Cayenne as I don't like too much heat. I used Jalapenos. I've got to agree with Cindy - I thought it was very bland and I don't know why. It had spices and beer but not much flavor. Won't be making this one again.

Fantastic chili - some things I changed to my personal taste: I used a blend of half ancho and half chipotle chili powders as well as using sweet paprika instead of regular.

So good.  I thought I had a good chili recipe on my own but man was I wrong.  This chili has quite a few more ingredients than my old one, but it adds so much to the complexity of flavor.  The beer I used was my favorite Belgian ale.

Loved it. Did not have poblano peppers, but replaced it and the tomato puree with 12.5 oz of diced tomatoes with chile peppers  and added a dash of pepper flakes. Awesome.

This recipe wins all recipes for chili. I didn't happen to have a poblano on me, but I had everything else and holy schnikies, it's amazing. Instead of doing stove top, I browned the onion and beef and threw it in a crock pot with everything else, cooked on high for 3 hours, then low for 2 hours.

Loved this recipe, some really great tastes. The cacoa gives it a bit of a mole taste. 
Used a good IPA.
Put in too many chilis - I realized later while tasting..
So I added a bit more tomoatoe and another can of beans. 
Worked out great. I'll do this again.

Wow. Good stuff! I had to improvise a little as I didn’t have the exact kind of chili powder on hand and I was a little short on the poblano peppers...otherwise I  followed spices as written. I did add some Italian sausage (no casing) and a can of kidney beans because I prefer a thicker chili....so good! I will be making this again...and again!

This was an awesome recipe ! Huge complex flavor. Definitely not a Fredo pie chili. I watched the video and took Chef Johns substitution suggestions. I used a jalapeño pepper and a small can of green chili’s instead of the plabalano pepper. I ended up using beef broth instead of water because I had it. I didn’t have coco powder. And didn’t use the oil. After browning everything on the stove top, I threw everything in my slowcooker for 8 hours. It was a perfect way to cook it. I just left out 1 cup of water (broth) to compensate for the slowcooker.

This was REALLY good chili.  Had friends over and they loved it !! The seasonings combination was what made this recipe! It had some heat...some smoke but not overwhelming.  This is no reflection on the chili...just personal preference...I am use to eating more tomato based chili....this is more beefy in flavor. Next time I may go with more on the tomato to see how it goes.  BUT I will make this recipe again...great to have an alternative. Great recipe !! Thanks Chef John !!

Just won a chili cook off with this one!  Followed Chef John’s recipe exactly and added a brisket I’d slow-grilled for a few hours. Just wanted some extra bite besides ground beef. Love the hidden flavors in his recipe!  Chef John never lets you down and we will now make this a family favorite. Thanks Chef John!

No changes needed in this delicious chili recipe. Have made it several times as written. Today I needed to use up a few pounds of fresh tomatoes from my summer garden. Used a mixture of heirloom and plum tomatoes. Cut tomatoes into quarters, squeezed the juice into the pan and threw the tomato pieces in. Simmered tomatoes for about 20 min. to soften and then used my Foley Food Mill to make the sauce. The mill separates the pulp and juice from the seeds and peels. A great way to use up some fresh garden tomatoes, used this instead of the canned puree.

Very good chili recipe.  The beer and cinnamon add nice flavor.  I thought the spice was just right, but it would be too spicy for my parents and grandparents.  I used 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp regular, which added some nice flavor.  I didn't have ancho chilis, so I used part of a jalapeño an part of a bell pepper.  I also used dried beans that I had previously cooked and made my own tomato puree from garden tomatoes.  Since this puree was thinner than what you'd get in the store, I used 3 cups and did not add water.

This chili came out really good. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I used Ceylon cinnamon which has a milder taste. Thanks for the recipe Chef John:)

This has to be one of the easiest chili's I made.  Instead of chopped beef, I used boneless loin beef bites (you can find them in the meat department).  I also used Guinness Beer (my favorite).

Now all the while, I am getting the 3rd degree...

I served over corn bread (2 Jiffy Mix Boxes), topped off with shredded sharp cheese.  Enjoy.

P.S.  Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe with us!
Oh, and those complainers - happy tummies!

This one ages deliciously! Did not have poblano peppers so I used jalapeños. So good. Serve it with corn chips and sour cream.

I will definitely try it again but I will make some changes to fit my taste. Great base for chili. We did rinse and soak our own pinto beans instead of using mushy, salty beans from a can, which I know made a positive difference.

The only significant changes I made were that instead of Ground Beef I used Beef Round Roast and Pork Shoulder Roast in a 2 to 1 ratio and had both ground using a Chili grind blade by my local Grocery Butcher.  I also used a combination of Chili Powders (Chipotle, Mexene, and McCormick Hot Mexican), not the single type Chef John Used.  I would not hesitate at all to use a single chili powder as Chef John calls out however.

Good chili. Has a unique, interesting but good flavor with the additional ingredients of cinnamon and chocolate. Will make it again.

This was delicious! I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked it, making it a little sweeter to round out the deep chili-chocolate-cinnamon taste by adding a few teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base. Probably next time (because I will definitely make this again) I'll add chopped red pepper to the onions and that will bring the sweetness.  The only beer in the house was my husband's Chimay (Belgian beer). Hesitantly, he shared half a bottle with me and everyone was happy. The beer gave it a great depth of flavor.  Also, I roasted 1 large poblano pepper, getting it nicely soft and charred, before chopping it up and adding it near the end. The chili tastes even better the next day. Thanks Chef John!

Excellent. Followed the directions. I've never been a chili fan mainly because I don't believe I made great chili. With this recipe I can finally make great chili. My husband is delighted since he loves chili.

Made as written with the exception of black beans for pinto as we like them better and they add color contrast. Excellent proportion of spices and ingredients like the poblano and beer which add depths of flavor. Delicious! As other have said: definitely a keeper.

I won a chili contest with this recipe.  The spices were to taste, but were probably doubled.  It was too spicy initially, but after sitting in a crockpot overnight, turned out perfect.

This is absolutely the best chili I've ever had hands down. I was a bit skeptical about using cinnamon and cocoa powder in a chili recipe but it turned out to be fabulous!  Next time I make this recipe I am going to drain the beef because it was way too greasy for my taste.

Really delicious. You can clearly taste the beer which gives an extra richness to the dish.
