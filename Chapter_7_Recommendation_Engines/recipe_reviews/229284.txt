We've never had quiche before and this was a wonderful introduction.  Yes...even Rednecks eat quiche!  ;-)

This was delicious!! Husband is begging me to make again. Only problem I had was that it didn't seem to cook at 350 in 25 minutes. Had to up the oven to 425 and leave it another 15 minutes in oven. I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was delicious! I served it for dinner with a salad and fruit, but it would also be great for a ladies luncheon or tea.

Thought it was pretty good. I like the idea of using hash browns as the crust instead of a pie crust. Also, the original recipe could use more eggs and milk because the three eggs in the original recipe are absorbed by the hash brown crust. And because of this you get the taste of eggs but its not like your eating eggs like you would in a traditional quiche.I used 5 eggs and a cup of milk the second time that I made this and it came out much better.

Edit: I now use the O'Brien 'simply potatoes' when on sale and use the entire bag in a deeper dish glass pie dish, excellent!  Original review - Pretty decent and easily modified with what you have on hand. Although...I decided the ham and cheese amounts excessive for 3 eggs (I even used XL eggs). So, I went with 1/2 C each of chopped smoked deli ham & shredded provolone (cheddar didn't appeal to me) and used 4 XL eggs. I used an 8" pie pan and I had around 2.5 cups of shredded potatoes (I had to shred my own spuds).  I did toss the melted butter in the potatoes prior to forming a crust. I needed to use up red bell type pepper and 2 small green chili peppers that I had charred/peeled and diced. I used 1/4 C ea of 2% milk and sour cream in the eggs and seasoned the potatoes a little bit b4 baking. I mixed a few T each of minced grn onion, provolone, parm shreds and pre-cooked bacon bits and topped the quiche right before it was completely set. With the quiche 6" from the flame I set to broil and a few minutes later...it looked and tasted great! I'll make this again with whatever I have on hand; but less meat/cheese then called for. Turned out 'just right' as dinner for the two of us with 1/2 leftover for day after lunch. Great starting point and easily modified. Thanks for submitting your recipe Candace  : )

I had an idea for dinner but couldn't find what I wanted so I used this recipe as a template and it was exactly what I was looking for.  My version used  ham and a mix of sauteed leeks, broccoli and mushrooms. I also added an extra egg & a little extra milk, giving it 35 mins at 350.
I may have been overly generous with the melted butter on the crust because only the edges browned and the rest of it was 'foamy' so next time I'll try using a pastry brush and give it a light brush.  We will definitely make this again, thank you, Candace!

I must say this was a fabulous recipe. I was kind of wary about the 3 cups of hash browns. I used the Simply Potatoes O'Brien Hash Browns. It appeared 3 cups was way too many, even after I mixed in the butter and packed into my deep dish pie plate. I baked the potatoes at 425 degrees for 25 mins. Next, I added my cubed ham and sautéed onions and peppers.  I topped with a cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheese blend. Then, I added 4 beaten eggs (as previously suggested) mixed with the 1/2 cup of milk and spices. The mixture perfectly filled the pie plate. Finally, I baked for 20 mins, still at 425 degrees. It was enjoyed by all, except the picky non-hash brown eating kid.  I served it with cinnamon rolls and fresh fruit cups.  This recipe was simply delicious! Plus, there are endless possibilities!

This was very good!  My husband isn't a big fan of quiche but, suddenly, you change up the crust and replace it with hash browns and he's all over it...go figure!  I used green onions but aside from that, made no changes.  We had it for dinner one night and 2 mornings of breakfast over the weekend.

This is a great recipe!  We didn't have any hash brown potatoes so I shredded raw potatoes and it worked great!  My daughter who does not like eggs even liked this!  Awesome!

I had just made a nice soup and was determined to make this delicious looking quiche.  Unfortunately I was missing a few ingredients and we have a blizzard going on outside.  Thank you to the other reviewer who suggested shredding your own potatoes if you didn't have hash browns.  I added the melted butter, some garlic salt and onion powder and mixed it in with the potatoes before pressing into the pie plate.  It worked great and I will always make it this way.  I also didn't have ham so I used a nice Italian sausage which had a lot of flavour.  I will definitely make this again with the ham and experiment with some other possibilities, ie mushrooms. broccoli, spinach, tomatoes and other cheeses.  Great recipe.

Made exactly as described, and it was great!  Loved the crunchy edge of the hash-brown crust.  Next time I may leave the crust in longer to get the whole thing a little browner and crunchier.

my husband who kept saying "I'm not a quiche person you know" while it was baking, ate 3/4 of the  pie!  lol  it was very good and here's how I made it:  I didn't thaw the hash browns, and unfortunately I didn't have small shredded hash browns either, but I layered them into the bottom and up the sides of a glass pie plate.  I brushed the hash browns with the 3 T melted butter, then baked in the oven for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile I sauteed onion (probably more than 1/4 c),  and pepper (I added 1/3 green, 1/3 red and 1/3 yellow) and made the egg mixture (I used 5 eggs instead of 3).  When the hash browns came out of the oven, I layered on the onion, pepper mixture, the diced ham,  poured the egg mixture over top and then layered on lots of cheese (a Mexican cheese blend).  Baked the indicated time and it was really good!  thanks for sharing a delicious recipe!

I made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit. I have had several requests to share the recipe. It was very easy to make.  Leftovers warmed up great in the microwave and tasted just as yummy the next day.  This is a keeper!

I served this for dinner and it got rave reviews - my husband actually told me how good it was four times during the meal and my picky eater went back for seconds in spite of the red pepper and the onion!  Will make this again for sure!

It's an employee's birthday today so I pulled this up last night because it looked quick and easy enough. It was amazing. Every person that ate it complimented me on it. I prepped everything last night so all I had to do was bake it this morning. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. I used bacon instead of ham and mild pepper rings instead of green pepper and added some leftover steamed asparagus.  It is versatile enough you can add ingredients to your preference. Husband loved it.  Great warmed up for a fast breakfast through the week.

Good idea - I only had potatoes and didn't feel like making dough. The bottom gets a bit soggy, and I needed to jazz it up some. A light mix of cheeses instead of a ton of cheddar, a few more spices, and some spinach. Might try to figure out how to get the bottom of the crust a bit crunchier without burning the higher edges.

This morning my husband came in from work wanting to finish off the last of our Christmas ham for breakfast. It wasn't enough for a meal so I did a quick search for recipes with 'ham eggs onions and cheese' to see what I would get. I expected a yummy omelet recipe but this popped up instead, I had all of the ingredients, and it sounded simple enough. Long story short it turned out amazing and really did the Christmas ham justice to go out in style. This is the 1st Quiche I've ever made. My husband couldn't get enough and only stopped eating servings because he couldn't fit anymore in his belly and my picky kids loved it too. The only thing I did differently is make my own hashbrowns using patience, a sharp nice, a few spare potatoes and one of the simple recipes on the site. Also I grilled all the veggies together for 5 minutes just before adding in the meat mixture. Additions I made were 1 medium tomato, a hand full of Mushrooms, an extra egg, a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper to add some kick to the grilled veggie mix, and a bit more seasoning to make up for all the extras. I was short on the ham so I added deli sliced roast beef to make up for it. I blended all my meats together for about 20 seconds to spread them more evenly. 350 degrees for 25 minutes wasn't enough so after I saw it was still gooey I amped the oven up to 425 and left it in the oven for 10 additional minutes.

This was very good. I salted the potatoes after forming the crust. My husband would like a crispier crust next time so will try broiling it briefly at the end of the crust cook time. The whole quiche took about 15 minutes extra cook time to set. This morning my daughter requested leftovers for supper!

Will definitely make again - a big hit with husband & a guest. Added a few mushrooms & some garlic powder. Took about 10 more minutes to set up at 350°.

This was a great recipe.  I did follow other posts advice and added some spinach and mushrooms.  Also left out the pepper as I didn't have one on hand.  Very, very tasty!  Thanks

This was really good.  I made exactly as written and I loved it.  That being said.  I really don't like green peppers and next time I will leave them out but even with them I loved it... Great Recipe

It was delicious!  Of course I made modifications because of ingredients on hand.  I used Swiss cheese that went really well with the ham.  I had to add an extra egg and some more milk.  Everyone loved it.

I'll be making this often as my "go to" meal when I'm in a hurry. It is a really good way to use common ingredients that are usually on hand to make a great dish. Thanks for sharing.

This was so easy to make!  Will cook hash browns a bit longer next time (we like them super crunchy).  Otherwise, we really enjoyed this dish.  Was my first time making a quiche, so wasn't sure we'd enjoy but will definitely make again!  May even mix it up and add different things.  A must do!

This was really good!  Loved the hash brown crust. Will definitely make it again!  Thank you for a really good recipe. 

P.S. warmed leftovers in the oven and the hash browns crisped right up. Was even better that next day.

My oh my. This was so good. I made it as written, however being in New Mexico, I added two tablespoons of hot green chili. We put green chili in almost everything here. I baked the crust a little longer than called for, and it took awhile for the eggs to set up, but I blame it on the 5000 foot elevation.
 Served with a salad, that's all that was needed.

I made this for a breakfast potluck and everyone loved it! I only changed a few things based on some of the suggestions given by others in their comments below (thanks!).  I sautéed the onions, bell peppers and ham a bit before adding the mixture to the potatoes and I used more eggs than suggested (mine were pretty small). Also, I added sour cream in the milk mixture about 1/2 cup (salt and pepper to preference). I will be making this again!

I made this for a few friends. It was very good! Easy to make. The hash brown crust was a nice surprise to everyone but it definitely makes it more or a breakfast/brunch quiche.  I had to add one extra egg with a little milk to reach the top of the crust.

Made this for Father's Day brunch and it was a big hit with our family.  A keeper for sure!  I would forego the foil though - next time I will use Pam despite the instruction not to butter the pan.

I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 pan and added mushrooms.  It was delicious and perfect for breakfast or supper.  Do require some cooking time but was so simple that didn't really matter.

The only change I made to the recipe was to add some thinly sliced mushrooms. My husband and I both love it. There was only one slice left which I imagine he will be having as a late night snack. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

Before this recipe, I'd make quiche with a store-bought pie shells. Ho hum.  I never thought of making the shell with frozen potatoes. I use another reviewer's tip and substitute potatoes with onions and peppers. My sons love it so much, they ask for it. Guess how often that happens? Thank you for sharing!

Loved it! Probably the best egg casserole I've made over the years. I forgot the butter and didn't miss it. I used green peppers instead of onion due to preference. Worked great. Looking forward to doubling the recipe for company.

The hash brown crust really kicked this recipe up a notch.  Tasty and filling!  I added a tablespoon of cornstarch, and used green onions instead of yellow/white.  Also added a sprinkle of BRUNOS carne asada seasoning on the hashbrown crust, and over the top of the quiche for added flavor.  Yummy!

The best gauge for any recipe in my house is if my husband goes back for seconds. Then after an hour we went back for another plate. Definitely going to keep this in the cookbook. Would also taste good with Sausage or jalapeno's too.

Wonderful! Great for that left-over ham. For more flavor I add pepper-jack cheese.

So easy and tasty! I approximated each ingredient (ham, cheese, onion) without damaging the outcome. I didn't have bell peppers, so I substituted dried parsley. Oh! And I used dried minced onions.  The recipe forgave me. Finally, I used a frozen pie shell (Gordon Food Service, GFS, is a marvelous source).  Otherwise, I made it exactly as described.  (Well, except I increased the eggs from 3 to 5.)  It is true that I had a small, crustless overflow batch which I placed in a Pyrex bowl (perfect for me since I'm dieting).  I absolutely love recipes that adapt to whim and experimentation.  This quiche is the queen of adaptation.  I love it!  Moreover, my husband ate it for 3 meals in a row AT HIS REQUEST; he usually tires of a food after 1.5 servings (that .5 is the killer).  It is THAT good!

Excellent and will make again.  I added some garlic and seasoning salt to hash browns.  Used 4 eggs and 2/3 cup milk and baked the egg mixture at 375 for 30 minutes.

My family loved the potato crust; it made the meal much more filling than the crustless quiche I frequently make. The only thing I changed from the recipe was I increased the number of eggs to five. Delicious!

I had to substitute tator tots for hash browns, so I skipped the butter. This was great!  I like it more than using a pie crust.

Oh my goodness! Who knew what a difference a hashbrown crust would make!!! Our son is a super picky eater and has snubbed his nose at EVERY quiche I have made to date. This recipe he keeps asking for more and I swear it's all about that crust. Thank you for sharing such a remarkable recipe!

We loved this recipe!!  I did put it in an 8 in. square pan for more depth and it turned out fine.  I also substituted red pepper since my husband dislikes the green.  It was okay but would be better with the green.  Overall we loved it and I definitely plan to make it again.

This was relatively easy to throw together and was a huge hit. I served it for dinner with fruit. It's flexible so you can add more eggs and milk, different veggies, etc. This belongs on the regular rotation.

Delicious my husband and a friend enjoyed this for breakfast. I used sweet peppers instead of green peppers. Next time I make it, I would use less hash browns for crust and more eggs and milk. I like a more eggy quiche. It seemed like the hash browns absorbed a lot of the egg mixture.

So good!  Why have I never thought to use hash browns as a crust before?!  We loved it!  I made one to eat and one to freeze and my husband ate the one to freeze as well.  Next time I think I'll try using shredded hash browns as the crust, otherwise, it's a delicious recipe!

I have had this recipe for a long time and finally got around to making it.  We enjoyed it .  My family doesn't like onions in anything and I had no green pepper so I made it without.  It was fine.  The only change I will make is to use four cups of hash browns instead of three.  I had to really stretch them to fill the pie pan and they were quite thin on the bottom.  But it's hard to beat ham, eggs, and cheese together with potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

This is now my go to dish when we have company!  It’s nice not to have to slave over the stove, while everyone else is visiting.  I try to use red and green peppers and/or red onion to give it more color.  I serve it with canned Grand biscuits and jelly.   It appears fancy, but is so easy!

This was great!  Definitely a keeper for all occasions.  I made a few changes. To the ham mix I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 c. Milk, and 1 c. Diced and cooked broccoli.  To the egg mix poured on top I used 4 eggs and a little less milk.  Cooking time was 25 minutes but at 425.  On the top I sprinkled a little shredded cheese for color.

I made this for a new year's brunch and it was amazing. I don't really eat eggs so I wasn't going to eat any at first but everyone was saying how good it was I had to try it! I cooked the hash brown crust on 450. while the has browns were cooking I diced you green and red bell pepper and a thick piece of ham from the deli. I put all that in a pan with butter and cooked it for a little bit and to the side I diced up some green onion. I thought 3 eggs wasn't enough so I used five eggs. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used shredded parmesan cheese. I combined the eggs, parmesan cheese, milk, salt, pepper, Onion powder, and garlic powder and poured that over my ham and pepper mixture on top of the hash browns and popped it in the oven still on 450 for 20 mins. it was so good!

Delicious brunch casserole I made for Christmas morning! I didn’t use green peppers and used green onions instead of regular cooking onions. I also doubled the recipe and was very glad I did!!! You have to try this out! This will become a holiday tradition!!!!

My very picky husband even liked this. I didn't have frozen hash browns so I used fresh potatoes for the hash browns. I also substituted Ortega chilis for the Green peppers and seasoned the crust with pepper,  garlic and parmesan cheese before baking. I will be making this again. I think I will try it with the frozen hash browns next time to see if it's better than the dish I made.

Excellent, easy quiche.  The hash-browns make this meal delicious!

I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit. I doubled this to make sure there would be enough and it went well in a 9x13 pan. I used russets brand hash browns from Costco which don't have a lot of water and thaw quickly. I mixed them with the butter and added season salt and pepper,  then pressed them into the pan. I cooked the hash browns until the sides were golden, but I could have gone another few minutes. I knew there would be vegetarians so I left out the ham. I upped the onion to 3/4 cup instead of a half and was also generous with the amount of red pepper I used in place of the green. I then mixed them with the cheese and spread it onto the hash browns. I added an additional egg and a 1/4 more milk to the eggs and again used season salt and generous pepper. I did cook this for ten minutes longer than the recipe as I was worried that the eggs weren't set. I can be picky especially being pregnant, but this turned out great.

I love quiche but I think I need to stick with a pie crust.

Very good!
I added apple wood smoked bacon to add just a hint of sweetness and some broccoli. Will make again!

This was good.   I made as written and it had nice flavor, but defitely had to cook much longer than the recommended time to cook all the way through.  I think this would taste great with sausage in place of the ham.

Easy as can be.  I plan to try it with other ingredients, like spinach and feta - or broccoli and swiss.

This was simple and we all liked it. I did not add onion or pepper, I didn't have any on hand. So, instead I added dried minced onion and a little Cajun seasoning (which we use on everything). I also subbed shredded hashbrowns for southern cubed hashbrowns, which was all I had, but I think  they worked better than shredded would have.

used a bag of simply potatoes and tossed in butter, salt and pepper for crust.  Maybe consider one of the flavored varieties

tried southwestern flavored potatoes- took this to 5 stars!

I had to adjust the recipe a bit as we didn't have any onion or green pepper, but had everything else. I subs onion with chopped garlic which made it so fabulous (if you like garlic fries, you'll like those crunchy garlic in this dish), and use chopped chives mainly for color. Added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt (YES, we love garlic in this household!!!) into the egg mixture. We'll definitely make it again... YUM!

I was looking for a recipe to make instead of buying Smart Ones frozen ham and egg scramble.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I used 5 eggs.  I thought it was a good ratio of egg to ham.  I didn't like the crust. I didn't have hash browns so I shredded a potato, patted it dry, added butter and garlic powder, but the crust was too mushy for my taste. Next time I will boil a potato, cut it up into chunks, and incorporate it into the casserole.  I still gave it 4 stars though because the flavor was great.

Loved it. The whole family did. My daughter took seconds--which is a miracle. Could have cooked for maybe 5 more minutes, but it was still great.

My Family of 5 loved it!  Very easy to make.  The first time I made only one quiche, and there wasn't quite enough.  The second time I made 2 and we only had 1 piece left. Great meal for any day of the week.

It was delicious! I made some changes: I used bacon rather than ham; I used a cheese blend (Colby-Jack, Cheddar, and Spicy Pepper Cheese); and, I added a ring of sliced tomatoes around the rim of the pie plate.  It was fabulous!! Served it with cut fruit and homemade bread with butter and jam. Yum!!!

This was great!  I used shredded sweet potatoes instead of hash browns.  I didn't have any peppers on hand so I put kale in instead.  I also added some fresh garlic and I used a cheese blend instead of all cheddar.  My son had three helpings and didn't realize it was made with sweet potatoes - he says he doesn't like sweet potatoes.  I cannot wait to make this again.

Wonderful recipe!  This was my first time making quiche. I used grated potatoes and baked the quiche in the oven at 425 degrees for 10 mins and then reduced the heat to 350 degrees for the remaining 15 mins. My family is begging me to make it again!

Really good.  May not drizzle butter over hash browns next time as it seemed to take a long time for them to brown. Added some cut up fresh mushrooms and cut up spinach. Once egg mixture was added cooked in the time suggested in the recipe.
