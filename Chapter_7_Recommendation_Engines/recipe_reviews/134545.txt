This dish was extremely disappointing.  I was very optimistic looking at the ingredient list, but after putting it all together, there was a profound lack of flavor.  We eat a good deal of vegetable dishes, but this is not one we will be repeating.

I really like this recipe. I may have altered it slightly, using more garlic and no cheese but it was delicious! It is a great alternative to pasta and much better for you!

I wanted to like this dish, but it just didn't have that great of a taste. At least it was full of veggies.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because there is a lot you can do with this recipe, it's just a matter of playing around with it.  I followed it exactly, with the exception of adding some smoked turkey sausage. The flavor is wonderful, everything mixes together beautifully.  I just want to spice it up slightly, maybe add some crushed red pepper.   Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This dish was easy to prepare.  However, it lacked taste and flavor.

This was a great source of a tonne of veggies and very tasty to boot.  The flavour is very mild though.  Some parmesan cheese helped pick it up.  A little more olive oil, double the herbs, and perhaps more wine, reduced would give it a stronger flavour?

It is a very light meal.  I would recommend some bread or something with it to give it a little weight or you might be hungry in an hour.

I thought this dish was great!  I felt all of the flavors of the vegetables worked together very well.  It was my first time cooking spaghetti squash and now I am absolutely in love with the vegetable!  The eggplant really soaked up the juices of the veggie mixture and the wine, and the roasted tomatoes were very flavorful as well.  Thank you for the great recipe!
