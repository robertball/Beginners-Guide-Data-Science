We ran out of our usual 2% cow milk but had a can of the full fat coconut milk in the pantry and decided to give this baby a try.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Holy Ned!  Delicious or what?  Very rich and flavorful.  We went whole hog with whipped cream and maple syrup to top them off... thought we'd died and gone to heaven.

I made this recipe as written and it turned out great, just like milk-based pancakes, but with a nice coconut flavour.

These pancakes go great with a caramel sauce.

Delicious when you run out of cow's milk or just want an alternative! I made these this morning as a double batch and they turned out great - they weren't super fluffy but definitely not "flat". If you had an issue with flat cakes make sure that you are JUST BARELY blending the dry into the wet - lumps are okay! Also I realized half way through cooking them that I completely forgot to add the melted butter that was still sitting in my microwave and they were still really good without it - so if you want to cut some calories you can omit the butter. I did add it for the second half of the batch and the butter actually made them less fluffy and there was not a significant taste change. Definitely adding this to the rotation for my lactose intolerant son!

they were okay for my first attempt. I will do some things differently next time to see if I can make them more fluffy though. They are delicious though I did not like how thin they ended up being...maybe a smidge more flour next time will solve that...

These were good. If you like coconut milk you'll enjoy the taste. They are easy to make with pretty common ingredients in my kitchen. We tried adding blueberries but it didn't work out that well. We didn't tell one of the pickier eaters in the family about the coconut milk and she didn't notice any difference so I'd say this is a keeper recipe. Thanks!

I added more vanilla and I used concentrate instead of extract but they tasted amazing! I will make them many more times because they are perfect for a lactose intolerant person!!

These were pretty good. We were out of both milk and coconut milk in the carton which are our go-to pancake milks so I had to find a recipe that used canned coconut milk. I actually liked the thinner texture they reminded me of the texture of sour cream or yogurt pancakes. My kids enjoyed them but the coconut flavor wasn t as subtle as the carton coconut milk.

Made it exactly as recipe. Delicious! Ran out of milk and coconut milk makes a great substitute. Will make it again. We had it plain with no toppings as it s great on its own too.

The pancakes never rose and stayed watery and thin.

Oh yum! I love the subtle coconut flavor in these fluffy pancakes. I also love how nice they taste the next morning. Today were mixing in pumpkin pur√©e cinnamon and maybe some pecans on top.

The batter was extra thick as were the pancakes themselves. I do believe these are some of the most delicious and fluffy pancakes I've ever made! My family loved them! I served them with Nutella and fresh sliced bananas. This recipe is a keeper!

Kind of bland alone but with syrup and berries on top they were great!!!! I added my own spices and instead of sugar I added protein powder. They were a great family breakfast for dinner.

This was excellent for waffles with an extra teaspoon of baking powder and no baking soda.
