Made vegan and turkey versions. Both absolutely delish. I add extra chipotle.

I liked this chili. I added or adapted some things. I used tvp that I had soaked in water first.  I used a homemade version of browning sauce and added extra adobe sauce and peppers. Thank you for the recipe.

It was ok. Wouldn't make again. Tasted more like a tomato stew type dish rather than chili

My husband and I loved this chili!  Didn't even miss the fact that it was not made with meat.  I had to substitute diced tomatoes because I did not have stewed.  The chipotle gives it just the right amount of kick!
