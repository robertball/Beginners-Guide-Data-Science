In my opinion, the reason that so many people say that these kabobs were dry is that the cooking time in the recipe is toooooo long.  I did mine on my Foreman Grill and I only cooked them for about 3 minutes and everything turned out juicy and delicious.  (You do have to switch them around during cooking, since the front skewer cooks slower if you use this type of grill.)  Also, I sprayed mine with some cooking oil to lock in the juice.

This marinade was very good!  My husband and daughter loved and I'm trying it on chicken tenders tonight.  I used one of those "fake" plastic lemons that has the lemon juice inside and it was still good.  I broilled the shrimp for 3 minutes on each side and it was perfect!  I also didn't use any veggies on the skewers because the shrimp came pre-skewered.

Totally awesome!  It was flavorful without being too hot.  The flavors blend with the vegetables well.  We loved it!

We loved this recipe. I boiled my shrimp skins, (not the shrimp itself), then reduced the liquid down to about 3/4 cup and used it as a base for the rest of the ingredients in the marinade. Read about that in another recipe... adds SO much flavor! Also marinated chunks of corn on the cob and grilled it along with the kabobs. I cooked,(microwave-steamed), the veggies just a little before putting in the marinade, and lightly buttered everything before the grilling. Less time on the grill left the shrimp juicy.

Loved it!  However, there was too little sauce to baste the veggies while on the grill so I doubled the marinade.  Worked out perfectly!

Excellent! Not at all hot, but very flavourful and tasty. I also put beef and eggplant on the skewers, and they turned out great.

Super easy marinade -- I can make this when I get home from work without it being too big of a task or too long to wait on a marinade. Requires stuff I always have on hand. Gives the shrimp a great color and great flavor, and even my picky-eater little brother loved this!

This has become a favorite of our family and friends.  They are always asking for seconds and thirds!!  The only thing that I have done different is I let the shrimp marinate for a couple of hours.
