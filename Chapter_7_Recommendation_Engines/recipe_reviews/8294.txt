I agree the proportions for this are off....so be warned......there is a better recipe for this.....but, of course, the kids love this.....can also be made with vanilla wafers and vanilla pudding and called "sand".......This has potential, but the proportions need to be adjusted........so, I would recommend another recipe for this.......I believe the correct recipe is posted on allrecipes.com

Wrong proportions listed with recipe.  I had to throw the whole thing out.  
Way, way too much milk.  I had to make this for a work event the next morning.  I had to go out in the middle of the night and buy all the ingredients again (this time following a different recipe).

This recipe is so easy and quick!!  I gathered many recipes for Dirt Cake before choosing this one.  The flavors blend together so well and it took me about 15 minutes to put it together.  I recommend putting the cookies in a baggie, breaking up with a rolling pin or meat mallot, and then put into food processor to crush to the consistency of dirt - you end up with less "chunks" that way.

I got this recipe years ago from my cousin and made it when the kids were little and it is alot of fun. The talk of the party. I don't know why some had trouble with it setting up. Her recipe even had a bit more milk in it but her preparation of ingredients are different and does not include van. extract. Her version is:A large bag of oreo's finely crushed. In a small bowl mix 1-8oz.softened cream cheese, 1/2 stick marg. and 1 cup confectioners sugar. Set aside. In a large bowl mix 2 pkg. instant vanilla pudding,and 3 1/2 cups cold milk. Beat until thick, add 12oz. coolwhip and mix. Add cream cheese mixture and beat together. I have never had problems with it.Layer the same as this one. I served in a large plastic flower pot with no hole in the bottom and put some plastic artificial flowers on top. It is so cute with the worms poking through. It is very rich and a real conversation piece. Young and old enjoy this! Thanks Kym!

This recipe is a pretty simple fix. Everyone keeps complaining about the measurements being wrong, but no one really offers a solution. Instead of 3 cups of milk, I only used 1.5. You could probably safely use 2 cups though. My mixture was pretty thick, but we liked it that way. Also I only folded about 4 ounces of whipped cream into the mixture. I wanted the flavor to be rich. It turned out good, thick, and creamy!

Everyone loves this recipe. I do make a few alterations. I omit the butter completly and use vanilla pudding instead of chocolate. I usually use one whole pkg of oreos crushed mixed in with all the other ingredients. Then coarsly break up another half pkg to sprinkle in and on top. I put in (clean) sand buckets with some gummi worms and fake flowers. Great for potlucks. I double the recipe for potlucks and I have never had any leftovers!!

This is a great fun dessert. It may not be the greatest culinary delight of your life, but it will earn you giggles from everyone.  Make the night before so it is good and cold. I put the worms in before sprinkling the crumbs on top so it looked more like they were burrowing. I made this to delight the kids - the fact that it tastes great is an added bonus!!!

I changed the serving size to 30 and made individual layered cups (5 oz.) for my daughter to share with her class (and several teachers) for her birthday. I was able to get 28 (5 oz.) cups made... 
Thanks! She is SO excited to share with her class! The samplings by she and her brother were a hit!!

I made this into a graveyard cake for a halloween party and it was a big hit.  I have to say though that there is too much pudding mixture in this recipe and you can probably use only 8 oz of cool whip and two boxes of pudding.

Made this cake 2 days ago and it still hasn't set.  It seemed like alot of milk was added, so maybe that was the problem.  Any one know what went wrong?  Anyway, it tasted alright, but unless someone has a fix for the recipe, I probably won't make this one again...

Have been making this for years!  It's my sons favorite & I use this every year instead of cake for his birthday b/c he does not like cake.  It's been used for many party themes and holiday's as well!

Simple to make and delicious!  If your pudding mix turned out too watery you probably didn't use the instant pudding mix.  If you accidentally bought the "cook and serve" pudding (like I did) just throw the pudding mixture in a pot and cook for a few minutes until a thicker consistency, then cool and add the cool whip.

Lost me at the Cool Whip.  Up til that point it was awesome.  I have eaten this many times and it has never been like this.  I am pretty sure that everyone here in WI omits the folding of nasty Cool Whip. Should have known better and stopped when it tasted good.

I have loved this dessert since I was a kid!  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I thought it was good, but could use a couple changes.  I omitted the butter altogether. It doesn't need it.  And I used vanilla pudding (because that's how I've always had it and like it better that way - but that's personal preference).  I only used 2 cups of milk.  It was the perfect consistency.  I also like a little bit of chunks in my oreo cookies.  So for half of the oreos I crushed them in a bag and used those for the middle layer of cookies.  I crushed the rest until they were very fine and put them on top. My daughter asks me every morning what is for dinner and I will tease her that we are having dirt and worms.  So I made this for her for the first time for her 4th birthday. She thought it was pretty funny! It's always a big hit!

This recipe was a big hit.  I would suggest that you combine the butter and cream cheese before adding the sugar and vanilla.  Also mix the pudding and milk together then add to the cream cheese mixture.  This helps everything blend together perfectly.

This recipe was surprisingly amazing.  I made a couple of different cakes for my son's first bday party and the other highly rated bday cakes did not go over nearly as well as the 'dirt cake'.  I  had left overs of the other, more 'glamorous' cakes, and the 'dirt cake' was getting second and third helpings, especially by the adults, and ran out quickly.  I used a very large 10" pot and had plenty of room to fit all of the ingredients in it. I ended up using both packages of sandwich cookies without any problem.  I also used banana pudding and that tasted great. It actually did not make enough for the 30 people I had at my son's party, but they were having more then one helping! This recipe was by far the best tasting, easiest, most creative recipe I have ever made for a party.

I followed the directions exactly, but I accidentally bought "cook and serve" rather than instant pudding which I didn't realize until I basically had chocolate soup. I have made this recipe many times before and couldn't figure out what the heck went wrong. Thankfully I read the reviews and found someone else who had the same problem. I threw the whole mixture in a pot on medium heat and cooked it until it just started to boil, which I think was even a little long, because it turned into real (thick) pudding! I waited for it to cool and then added the cool whip and it was perfect! Hooray!

This turned out really great.  My girls loved it.  I didn't realy follow the directions and thought I needed more cookie crumbs so following the advise of other reviewers I used more then directed.  The cake turned out too crummy.  Next time I'll follow the directions exactly.  Also, it didn't say in the recipe but you do need to add the milk slowly to the cream cheese and butter.  Add it all at once and you end up with a mess, but a little bit at a time will work together nicely.  I was in a hurry and forgot that little cooking tip. =)

Exceptional!  I made a triple batch of this recipe for a big party and served it in a big children's plastic bucket with little plastic hand shovels.  It was a huge hit!  To reduce the calories a little, I used light margarine (only 50 cal/Tbsp), neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, light whipped topping, and fat-free milk.  Everyone has been asking me for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this several times. 4 stars only because 1 cup conf sugar is waaaay to much. 1/2 would be much better.  Only change I made was I used fresh whipped cream opposed to cool whip ( 1 1/2 heavy cream, 1/4 conf sugar and squirt vanilla whipped for 4 minutes).  And a bit more milk then called for. Pudding was too thick for my preference. Otherwise fun and awesome recipe.

I've always liked this recipe; it's a big hit with the kids, too.

I didn't have any trouble at all with the measurements -- they're pretty much the same for every "dirt" recipe I've seen.  In fact, I've seen other recipes that call for 3 1/2 cups of milk, so this one should yield the less runny alternative.

Perhaps the problem is that whomever had trouble with it being too runny didn't mix long enough after the pudding and milk were added.  It said on the pudding box to mix for two minutes, so after I added the pudding and milk, that's what I did.  The consistency was fine after that.

Very yummy recipe!  My son requested it for his birthday after our neighbor's son had a dirt cake.  The only thing I changed was that I did individual cups for each of the children to reduce the mess of scooping it out for each child and made sure everyone got an even number of gummy worms.  Great recipe!

Great recipe, I made it for the 4th of july. I know I few people had trouble with the recipe saying that it called for too much milk. Make sure that you buy the instant pudding mix, I almost made that mistake.

Perfect, but took time to put together.  It was great for my daughter's ladybug party!  A nice alternative to real cake.

I just made this today for a Halloween party. I used the big packs of Jello after reading that it may have too much milk and like it a little more stiff...it was GREAT! I have chocolate lovers in my family so the chocolate Jello was wonderful... and it looks like the mud pie I used to make as a child. Great recipe!!

I don't understand why people are saying that the measurements are off...I had absolutely no problem with it.  If you beat the pudding mixture for a couple of minutes like you would any instant pudding, this will set up perfectly.  In fact, mine was a bit on the thick side!  Don't change anything.  My kids, nephew, and neighbor ADORED this cake!  (I hid the worms under the top layer of dirt so that they would be a surprise.)

I made this for my daughter's birthday.  I used two large boxes of pudding and about 4 cups of milk, but kept the other measurements the same. It was way too sweet, and I'm a sweets kind of person! Some of the kids didn't finish theirs because it was so sweet. Next time, I would leave out the butter, cream cheese, and DEFINITELY the powdered sugar. Oh, I used Famous Amos cookies and they were just as good as Oreos.

This is a great recipe.  We have made it many times, and if you want to you can change it according to your tastes by using different flavors of pudding, and different flavors of cookies.  We always use light cool whip and lite cream cheese and you can't tell one bit of difference.  Also, we skip the powdered sugar.  It just doesn't need it.  A deep glass bowl looks the best to make it in, but a glass 9 X 13 pan is good too.  The trouble with using a flowerpot is that you can't see through it which is really a big part of the appeal.

It turned out well, set up nicely. I omitted the vanilla and used extra gummi worms. The kids love it! The only thing I found was wrong was that I could have EASILY used 2 packages of cookies. My middle cookie layer is almost non-existant.

My family has been making dirt cake for years and it is pretty much the same except for more milk was added. Some people who had problems with the cake setting may have forgotten to purchase instant pudding. I love this desert fun for all!

I made this for my sons birthday party at the bowling alley.  I put it in new, small, individual plant pots so no serving was necessary.  Just had to take spoons and the kids took the pots home.  Of course I included gummy worms 1/2 sticking out of each pot.  Some of the girls were too grossed out to eat it -- Cool!

The directions for this recipe are wrong. If you follow these directions you will end up with a totally milky mixture and will not be able to actually make the dirt. You need to save the whipped cream for last and fold it in because that is what makes the pudding layer of the dirt thick enough to stay between the layers of oreos.

Awesome recipe! The one thing that seems to be giving people problems is that everything should be combined in stages. Mix together cream cheese and butter; then add-in powdered sugar, set aside. Then combine pudding and milk; be sure to beat thoroughly. I started out with 3 cups milk, but actually increased it to 3-1/2 c. milk. Once pudding has thickened, add cool whip. Lastly, beat in cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Assemble the next day. I made dirt cakes in plastic cups for my daughter's class and they were a HUGE hit. The taste is awesome and this is coming from someone who tends to prefer food made from scratch. :)

My son and I made this for his 6th birthday party.  It was a huge hit with all the kids and definitely reminded me of the original from when I was little. I omitted the butter but other than that I found all other measurements perfect.

Great Recipe! I was looking for an easy/no baking required cake for my son to make as a birthday cake for his dad. This was very tasty and it was a big hit with my entire family. The best part of it all was that my 9yr old made the cake all by himself. I should mention that we did use chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla, but I'm sure it would taste just a good with vanilla...This recipe is a keeper.

Good as always.  Kids LOVE it.  I always leave out the butter and never notice anything lacking.  I have left out the confectioners sugar by accident, and don't think that mattered, either.  The pudding, cream cheese, cool whip are the essence of the filling.

Very good!  My son and I made our "dirt cake" for Earth Day!  I followed recipe just as is and it was great.  The milk amount was just fine you just need to add slowly.  I only added about a 1/2 cup at a time.

This was really good.  I made this for my Daisy Girl Scouts to celebrate Earth Day. (We also drank bug juice).  I fed them a whole big story on how I dug the dirt up special for them that morning. After that I gave each girl her own cup of dirt to their surprised looks.  However, I disagree with another reviewer who said that it is best to serve in a clear glass bowl. It is really only the cookie crumbs on top that look like dirt. Seeing through the clear cups the girls quickly realized it was pudding. Where as if it was in a flower pot or even a solid cup or bowl one only sees the dirt cookie crumbs with worms on top.

I have a step son who doesn't care for regular cake.  I made this for him for his birthday and ALL of the kids went NUTS over it!  The cream cheese gives it that decadent taste...yummy!!  I did crush the cookies in a big ziploc bag first, then food processor.  Made them nice and fine.  Some kids really thought it was dirt on top!  The only thing I may do different is to put the gummy worms on just before serving.  They got a little hard from being refridgerated.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

We made this recipe in Family and Consumer science at school. We cut the recipe in half though, so our proportions were fine. You do need less milk for this recipe, because you need the pudding thicker. This was very tasty, although after four bites it was so rich it was hard to eat.

This is always a hit. I usually make it with low fat whipped topping, cream cheese, skim milk and sugar free pudding mix and it still turns out wonderfully. When I take this to a party I never bring any home.

I have to admit that this recipe is a chocolate lover's fantasy! Yum! I thought this recipe was excellent. I have been looking around for the perfect dirt cake recipe and this one has to be it. I made it for my husband for father's day (he wanted a chocolate dessert). Putting it in a flower pot is an excellent idea too. This would be an excellent cake to make for a child's birthday party. Thanks so much!

It was very very good!  I made it for my sons birthday party.  We had a construction theme so I served it in the back of one of his dump trucks and served it with a big shovel.  He loved 'playing' in the dirt and did get some in his mouth.  The only thing I found wrong with the recipe is that I had way too much pudding left over.  This recipe could easliy be cut in half.  All in all I give it a BIG thumbs up!!

Very rich, easy-to-make dessert.  I made it for our Halloween Chili Cook-off at work and won the prize for best dessert.  Everyone loved finding the gummi worms in the pudding and I enjoyed trying to place them as if they were poking up from the ground.  I like this recipe because there is more pudding and just enough "dirt".

Found this recipe to be a little too sweet.  The birthday party I served it at turned off some of the kids.  They didn't think it looked too appetizing with the "worms" in it.  We ate about half of the recipe, then it just sat in the fridge for a few weeks until I had to toss it away.

The kids loved this one! Especially with the gummy worms.  We didn't use the flower pots but we did use the little plastic shovel and served it in some small pails I found at a party supply shop.

Use 2 cups of milk, not 3. Make sure to use the full amount of whip though, makes it much easier to spread the mix.

Wrong proportions??? NO WAY!!!! The gummy worms are the only thing I don't put in this recipe. Other than that, I make it as is and it's PERFECT. EVERY. TIME. I have been making this for my family for years and it is THE #1 requested recipe above all other foods at all our family gatherings. And, some even ask for it as a replacement for their birthday cakes. Most of the time, I have to make a double batch because everyone likes to hog it (lol) and we have a large family. This recipe has NEVER let me down. It always turns out BEAUTIFULLY!!

This was absolutely delicious! Very easy to make!. The only thing I did differently was use instant vanilla pudding instead.

4 Months later... 
I am in the middle of making this again and I think the measurements changed. Mostly the amount of milk. It has turned out very watery. I may have to throw it out and start over. Its in the refrigerator now hopefully thickening up so I can start layering. I would definitely change the measurement on the milk. Start with 1 1/2 cups and then add as needed. The filling is supposed to be "Filling like" not watery. Update soon after it sits in the refrig for a few hours.

I have made this twice now, and it always disappears!  I had no problems with the amount of milk.  The pudding mix box calls for 2 cups milk each, so three cups is less than for 2 boxes.  Also crushed the cookies in a gallon bag with a rolling pin.  YUMMY!

I was a little skeptical about using this recipe after reading the reviews that stated the proportions were wrong. However, I had made dirt cake years ago and it seemed "right." So I thought, what the  heck.  I made it per the directions and it turned out great.  No problems with the consistency and very yummy.

I'm giving this five stars for the cute idea this gave us for a dance invitation.  I'll post the picture.  My daughter tasted this as she was making it and said it tasted good, but we didn't eat it we gave it away.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for work, and my review is mixed. I have made this before and the mud part seemed more whipped. I agree, there is too much milk. I thought this as I was pouring it in, and it took a lot of elbow grease and whipping to get this to a decent consistency. Also, this was very sweet. I only used 8 oz of cool whip and that was fine. Overall, people loved the presentation and said it tasted good, but I thought it looked a little too muddy and was very sweet. All and all  there is room for improvement but it served it's purpose-work baby shower/pot luck.

I used more than one package of cookies to fill the bowl I used. I imagine that if I had used the size pan called for in the recipe it would have been perfect. The filling is DELICIOUS. I couldnt stop licking the bowl. My husband even loves it and hes not a chocolate fan! I can't wait to show up to the halloween party with this cake!

this recipe is great! but what would be also wonderful is if you made like a candy land, just like the game candy land! i think that the kids would love you after that. like when i was younger, when i was about 10, we went to a friend house for like this big kids party, and it was a whole lot of kids! and a lady brought one of thoses and after i ate it i just loved her! and it was not only because it tasted really good but mostly because it looked so creative and nice!

This was a huge hit with the after school kids I work with.  We were releasing earthworms into the garden we planted today and I thought this would be a fun tie-in.  They actually thought it was real dirt on top!  Beware, though.  It is very messy.  Next time I will use a big serving spoon rather than a spatula.

I did not have whipped topping so I subbed melted marshmellows (6oz)for a half recipe.  It thickened very well and was a hit.

Wow!  I made this for my son's cub scout event where we auctioned off cakes.  It was a hit and made $45, and all the kids lined up for some.  Great for boys.  Awesome presentation.

This dessert was very rich, but very good.  You only need a small amount to enjoy it.
