The sauce part of this is perfect! I added a little more heat to mine by adding a little more chili garlic and also some siracha. I just used whatever veggies I had in the fridge for the stir fry part. 

Do NOT mix the spaghetti squash into the overall mixture. It will get super gummy and turn into mush. Just layer some spaghetti squash down on your plate and then ladle the sauce/veggie/meat mixture on top. 

This made way closer to 6 servings for me. When putting it into a calorie calculator it would be about 225 calories per serving!

What a creative way of using spaghetti squash.  Being Asian,  my husband and I are usually hesitant on trying 'Asian' recipes due to many failures in the past,  but this recipe was actually delicious. My picky husband loved the sauce and requested that I make more so he can put it on everything from noodles to chicken.  I agree with other reviewers that the sauce needed a little bit of sugar, so after tasting the sauce from the original recipe,  I added approx 1 Tbsp of brown sugar and it perfectly balanced out all the flavours.  Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is a great alternative to other spaghetti squash recipes, and useful for items in my fridge and pantry. I used bean sprouts, snap peas, minced ginger, and zucchini. Used half of a spaghetti squash left over from another recipe, reheated in microwave.  Subbed minced garlic and a bit of red curry paste for the chile-garlic sauce. Very good.

You made me love spaghetti squash! I microwaved the squash for 8 minutes after poking with a fork. I didn't have any broccoli slaw so I used some cabbage instead, can't wait to try it with the slaw.I also added some basil. I can't believe anyone would think the sauce was bland, much less add sugar! Thank you for sharing a fantastic receipe. We will definitely be making this again.

Flavor was great but doesn't need quite as much sauce as the recipe makes.  I used shrimp and the veges I had in the fridge.  The recipe doesn't call for lime, but Pad Thai isn't right without it!  Squeeze a bit of lime over the finished product for the best flavor!

Delicious! I omitted the ginger (I personally don't care for  it), substituted 1 TBSP of siracha sauce for the oyster sauce, added 1 extra TBSP of peanut butter, 1 TBSP of sugar and a tsp. of garlic powder to the sauce and it was delicious!  The sauce would be good over rice noodles too for the standard pad thai, too.  If you omit the chicken it would be a nice vegetable side dish.

I'm eating low carb due to diabetes and this recipe is awesome! I've really missed noodle dishes like phad thai and this version is one that I can enjoy & the taste and texture are great. I increased the chili garlic sauce, fish sauce, and fresh ginger. I also added the spaghetti squash into the sauteed vegetable mix with no problem (I used about 1/2 a squash). This will be added to our regular dinner rotation for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

A great base for someone new to making Pad Thai, and SUPER adaptable!  I didn't measure any of my sauce ingredients and it still turned out awesome.  I added a bit of honey to the sauce because we like it that way, and I used the veggies I had on hand for the stir fry (shredded cabbage, carrots, onions, bell peppers).  I used tofu instead of chicken.  I microwaved my spaghetti squash and served it under the pad thai instead of adding it to the veggies.  See what I mean by adaptable?!  I love it.  Thank you so much!

This was delicious! I subbed tofu for chicken and tamari for soy sauce to make it began and gluten free. DELICIOUS! I didn't have oyster sauce so subbed tamari w a 1/2 tsp of sugar. I feel like that is the richness the sauce was missing. But otherwise excellent! Topped w cilantro, chopped peanuts and a squeeze of lime! Oh and I added some mushrooms because they needed to be used. Definitely making again. It's a great way to use all the spaghetti squash we grew this summer.

Absolutely  delicious! I've made this several times and it is definitely a favorite. I used the exact recipe, I even like it better than noodles because the leftovers are not mushy.

5 star recipe....we loved it!   I used prawns and had to cut down on some of the veggies as I didn’t have enough room in the skillet.  Will definitely make this again!

I made following instructions/ingredients.  Overall, I think the flavor was great. The only change I would make next time is to not add the squash until the very end. I added it when stated, but by the time I was done everything was more of a paste than pasta. So less stirring after the squash is added would have given me the pasta-like presentation I was aiming for.

Really enjoyed the sauce - so flavourful.  Prefer a lighter peanut butter flavour so added 1 tbsp. pbutter and 2 tbsp. chili sauce.  Used Zucchini, Onions and matchstick carrots for the vegetables.   Recommend putting the veg and sauce on the plated spaghetti squash.

I tried this recipe on leftover spaghetti squash, and it was very good, especially the sauce. I scaled it down, because I just used half of a half-squash. It was a small amount, and I followed the top reviewer's suggestion of just topping the squash with the sauce and veggies. Easy, and it all basically mixed in. I sauteed shredded green cabbage (also leftover!) and added a handful of frozen tri-color peppers just until they still had crispness to them. I didn't add the chicken or zucchini, but this dish could work with so many things (other veggies, shrimp, etc). I would make this again. Thanks!

Made sauce as written.   Perfect, would not change a thing.   Took others advice and served sauce over squash, not mixed.   Skipped the chicken adding more veggies.   Excellent.  

Add peanuts before serving.  Consider doubling the delicious sauce.

My husband said to me when I made this last night " We seriously need to have this every week it's amazing!" Haha I do agree it's really good and the flavour is fantastic but every week? You'll have to try it and see if your craving this healthy yummy dish weekly.

After preparing it as written, I added more ginger, more fish sauce, more chili sauce and 2 minced cloves of garlic.  When serving I squeezed some fresh lime juice over the top and topped with an egg.  Still, I felt the sauce was missing something, but I really can't put my finger on it.  I do think this is a good start.  I do love the idea of using this with spaghetti squash for those who may be gluten intolerant or low carbing it.  In my oven, I cook my squash at 375 for about 45 minutes to an hour for a crisp tender texture.  All ovens are different.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made one ‘recipe’ of this, and overall, enjoyed it. I agree with a previous reviewer that keeping the squash separate until the end is good, but tossing the squash into the rest of it is important to make it more pad-Thai-ish. This was my first attempt, so I split the sauce and chicken, half over squash, half over pho noodles (for my kids). They loved it! Next time I’ll probably up the chili sauce for more spice. It’s a solid recipe, as is.

Perfect. I added some rutabaga because I had it and tamarind concentrate for the same reason. Served w/peanuts on top. I find cooking squash whole in the microwave easier and faster than using the oven.

We really enjoyed this easy recipe that could be vegetarian or great with tofu. I used mushrooms since I did not have zucchini and I did increase the chili garlic sauce since we like spice. I used  the spaghetti squash as a bed for the vegetables and sauce, glad I did not mix the squash into the  dish. Peanuts and lime juice on top are a must! I will put the cilantro as a garnish on top next time rather than cooking it. We will definitely make again!

Great recipe! Loved it! Didn't have fish sauce, so I added a little Housin sauce just because I had it.  Similar to other comments, I didn't add the spaghetti squash noodles to the veggies...just put them on plate and topped with the vegetable mix. I think it would be just as good without the chicken, if you don't have any. Even my picky grandson enjoyed it!

Amazing recipe!!! Pad Thai is one of my favorite dishes. Having a healthier version is awesome. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I added egg. Egg did not change the flavor, just another a kind of protein. Delicious!!!

Delicious way to use spagetti squash. I thickened sauce with Bob's red mill egg replacement (for one egg) and was perfect. I used red peppers, purple cabbage, broccoli cut up and kale (I put kale in everything!)  Definitely a keeper reciepe!!!

I have a peanut allergy so i substituted almond butter for the peanut butter.  My friends who have eaten Pad Thai said it was excellent.  I will make this again.

Wonderful! I modified the sauce slightly. As I didn't have chili garlic sauce or oyster sauce, I just skipped them. I added about 3 TBS of brown sugar and 3 TBS of chopped peanuts (dry roasted) to the sauce. Even my finicky 9 yr old loved it!

I had trouble shredding the squash, but other than that, it was delicious. Very flavorful with just the right amount of heat and peanut butter. Will definitely make this regularly!

Delicious!! I substituted rice noodles for the spaghetti squash, and with a 16 oz package of noodles there was just quite not enough sauce. I would do 1.5 times the sauce ingredients next time. Delicious and easy to make!

Delish and healthy. I used the veggies I had on hand   As suggested I did not mix the squash with the veggies and sauce but rather served on top. Will definitely use the leftover sauce for maybe a cold peanut noodle salad!

Great recipe!  Lots of liquid ingredients in small amounts but luckily I had most of it.  I didn't use the broccoli coleslaw I substituted radicchio and bok choy and used  sweet onion instead of green.  The store only had siracha chili sauce.  I put the sauce on as I served it as another reviewer suggested.  Easily can substitute other vegetables .  Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent!  I had a 4 lb squash, which I wouldn't call small and there was plenty of sauce.  I did add some sugar as I thought that it needed to be a little sweeter.   Didn't have broccoli slaw, so used some matchstick carrots.  Also used Xanthan gum instead of corn starch to lower the carbs a bit.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much it tasted like pad Thai. My fiance, who doesn't like spaghetti squash, enjoyed this dish as well. It's so filling! But I had WAY more than 4 servings at the end.

I prepared the recipe as written.  Although it was very good, there was still something lacking. I believe that maybe adding coconut milk to the sauce would give it a richer flavor and a more Thai flavor. And as others suggested, slices of lime with crushed peanuts on top would make this perfect. . I would definitely make this recipe again with those changes

I pretty much followed as written, although I started with raw chicken and sautéed it. I found the dish too spicy, and it didn't taste at all like Pad Thai to me. However, it was tasty in its own right. I will try again to make spaghetti squash Pad Thai, but will make it more like the traditional version while substituting spaghetti squash for the noodles.

I could drink the sauce, it was so delicious! I fried up some tofu and held back the spaghetti squash until the end as another reviewer recommended. Added a splash of lime juice. Next time I'd like to try some sprouts for extra crunch and maybe an egg, but man oh man was it good. I made this just for myself, can't wait to make it for company.

I'm not sure if we used too small of a spaghetti squash, the final result was sauce  heavy, but overall a great recipe. We added a little bit of honey in order to sweeten the sauce just slightly, probably about a tablespoon.

I think the squash works pretty well as a substitute for rice noodles. The sauce is OK but needs some tweaking. I did add a touch of molasses sensing a lack of sweetness (tamarind traditionally) and extra lime wedges. Subbed shrimp for chicken and added scrambled egg and chopped peanuts as well!

This recipe is delicious...the flavors go well together. But, like other reviewer's have said, do not mix in the spaghetti squash noodles. I did that and,even though I tossed it very gently, it got mushy. Lay your noodles down first. Then put the sauce and veggie mixture over. It will look much prettier. 
I does taste amazing and I'll be making it again.

This was so good and even better with some lime squeezed over the top.  I usually don't like Pad Thai well enough to have as an entrée, but this was great.

Pad thai is my favorite meal, and I  have never tried spaghetti squash before,  so i was sceptical. However, this was so so so good. I followed the recipe exactly with a few additions. To the sauce i also added a bunch of pb2, as it increased the peanut flavor, added an extra spoon of garlic chilli sauce, as i like things spicy, and added a few tbs of brown sugar. I also used precut strir fry mix and chicken. In the end there was a ton of food and actually a ton of sauce. I could have used 1/2 the sauce, but it was really good, so i used it all. Yum yum yum.....thank you!!!!!

Really new way to use spaghetti squash which I always have in abundance once fall rolls around.  I served this with some korean bbq'd chicken thighs and we really enjoyed the combination.  I did up the peanut flavor and spice level to suit our tastes.

So, so good. Something in this hit every receptor for "delicious" in my body. I was forced to make lots of changes for not having many ingredients on hand, nonetheless... it turned out a five star winner. Despite carefully following "if it fits your macros" meal tracker, I abandoned my end of day calorie limit and had 2+ helpings. As to my changes: I did not include

This was really good.  I made pretty much as recipe stated.  I stirred ch. peanuts into sauce, and cilantro into vegetables.  Then I stirred sauce into vegetables and topped sp. squash w/the veg. sauce.  I squeezed lime juice over top. I used ketchup for chili/garlic  sauce left out oyster sauce and used EVOO instead of sesame oil.  2nd time I only added 1/2 of the broccoli slaw, 1/2 the pepper and 1/2 the zucchini.  It seemed like there was too much sauce for the ingredients.  So either cut down the spaghetti squash or add  closer to the original amts. of vegetables.  I also thought it could have used a little more peanut butter, I didn't get too much of the peanut butter taste.

My family loves this recipe.  The only changes I made is to add Thai peppers to the peanut sauce while it is simmering and to increase the peanut butter 1 T to make the peanut flavor slightly stronger. Also, the easiest way to cook a spaghetti squash is to poke it with a metal skewer and then bake at 400 for 1 hr- 1 hr 15 min in a lined pan. So much easier than trying to cut an uncooked spaghetti squash.

Pretty good and relatively easy. You could probably use a premade peanut sauce to save time.

This was great. However, I agree that it needs some sweetening. I added a couple of squirts of agave syrup & topped with chopped cilantro & peanuts. Even my daughter who hates spagetti squash liked it!

My 16 year old daughter even liked it! I'm allergic to shellfish so I eliminated the oyster sauce and it was still really good. Only change I made is that I added the veggie mixture to the chicken and sauce instead of vice versa. I felt like there was more veggie's for the amount of sauce (could have been due to the size of the spaghetti squash) I did this to make sure there was enough sauce. I ended up using about 3/4 of the veggies. I also sprinkled chopped peanuts on top.

SO we were gonna make it with spaghetti squash but when I went to get my squash- it was rotten.  Already had everything else prepped, so I did it with Shirataki noodles instead.Used a bunch of random frozen veggies and shrimp instead of veggies. LOVED the sauce.  We were out of rice vinegar and used apple cider vinegar instead. Excited to use variable ingredients but keep the base recipe

This recipe is awesome! I omitted the oyster sauce, just because I didn't have any. But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I will make in the future is the method of cooking the squash. I prefer to cook it cut side down in a 9x13 with a little water in the bottom--it cuts down on the burning on the loose strands. It definitely made more than 4 servings for us and was very filling. Will be making again!

First recipe that I have ever reviewed on this site.  This was absolutely delicious.  I will probably add another 1/2 tsp of the chile-garlic sauce next time to kick it up just a bit, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  It is definitely going into my rotation.

Made this tonight. Didn't change a thing. It was so good. It made a huge pan full. Says feeds four. I would say 6 to 8. Lucky us  we have left overs. Hubby keeps telling me this is a keeper.  Next time I would sprinkle a few crushed peanuts on top and squeeze some lime on it.  This dish is loaded with flavor. I highly recommend trying this recipe as is.

This really grew on me as I ate more of it. I don't think it tastes much like pad thai (not just the lack of noodles, but the sauce is different) but this is a nice comforting tasty pile of slop that's pretty good for you.

This was a hit with my family! My husband and kids loved it!!! I used a white onion instead of green onion. I omitted the oyster sauce and minced garlic and used ginger and garlic paste and curry paste. I omitted the chile garlic sauce. I added srirachi chili sauce to add a little spice.  I also put a table spoon of sugar to balance the flavor. My husband had thirds!!! Thank you for this dish.

Would give this 10 stars if i could, it is seriously THAT good!! The peanut sauce is delicious, whisked some water and flour together in place of the corn starch and slowly added it to thicken the sauce.  I actually like the spaghetti squash in place of traditional noodles.  Had lots of leftovers.

So versatile and forgiving.  I've made it 4 times (very rare of me).  Veggies can be changed out or follow exactly, won't go wrong.  Loved it with mushrooms, brought an earthly subtle layer.  Very tasty!

I really enjoyed this recipe! The sauce had a great flavor and the squash fooled me into thinking it was noodles. I always use tofu instead of chicken, and it worked really well in this recipe. This is my go-to recipe for spaghetti squashes now!

This was very good, my BF doesn't often like peanut butter in dishes.  I added a little hot pepper to spice it up and didn't have oyster sauce, but else kept to the recipe, very good.

Not your average spaghetti squash recipe and YAY! for that!  Sauce is simple to make, and I used grocery store pre-cooked rotisserie chicken.  I  even mistakenly overcooked my squash, but it was still delicious even though the squash was mushy. Will be making this again.

Love the idea of this recipe, I added a random bag of broccoli slaw, didn't measure any of the ingredients for the sauce but it was excellent. I did however add more cayene to the mix for a bit more zip. Oh and I didn't combine any of the ingredients, I just layered them on my plate. Yum!

I made this with shrimp and found the sauce to be too heavy - may try again with less peanut butter and more of the liquid ingredients.  Spice level was great, served it with the spaghetti squash and used red pepper, zucchini and mushrooms as my veggies.

I really like this dish.  The only changes I made is that I added a pinch of red pepper for heat and I used extra firm tofu instead of chicken.  Otherwise the flavors are delicious! I would definitely make this again!

I didn't expect this to be so good!  I had almost everything already.  I cut the spaghetti squash in half not longitudinally, but like you would cut laterally (like a hotdog two kids would split) and put it in a glass pie plate  with an inch of water.  Then, I microwaved the spaghetti squash, cut side down,  for 20 minutes.  Perfect!    I was worried about cooking the sauce too high for fear it would burn the peanut butter.  No oyster sauce because I don't like it. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I didn't use that either.

This was wonderful, but I felt like something was missing!  I know its a diet sort of food, but after adding 1 tb of brown sugar, it was great.  I'm having it over zoodles, so that should help on keeping it diet food;)

Yum!  Loved the flavors!  Added cauliflower to stretch the volume and substituted cabbage as others suggested. That was last week. Making again tonight with broccoli slaw and keeping the addition of cauliflower. Also added chopped peanuts to the finished dish, I wouldn't skip those either!

I made this with vegetables I had on hand and it was great! I loved the flavor of the sauce and it went well with what I had: Broccoli instead of broccoli-slaw and no zucchini. As another reviewer suggested I kept my sauce/vegetable mixture separate from my spaghetti squash so things didn't get mushy. I'm making it again tonight  as written but without chicken. Great way to get in a really veggie heavy dinner so I can feel good about what I make the rest of the week.

This recipe was amazing!!! The flavor was phenomenal! I didn't have a whole lot of experience with spaghetti squash and  cooked it too long so it didn't resemble noodles at all but still tasted great. It was also very filling.  I will definitely be making this again. Thank you.

That's what comes to mind when I made this.  The flavor wasn't anything like Pad Thai.  The vegetables  floated around in the sauce and got soggy.  And my large squash didn't yield enough  to have Spaghetti Squash be in the title of this dish.  I would normally wonder if I did anything incorrectly, but I followed the recipe to the letter.  So unfortunately, this one is not a keeper .

I made some rookie mistakes (I'm new to this whole "making food for myself" thing), such as not allowing enough prep time and not reading the recipe through to realize that the veggies were not magically going to dice themselves. I did make a couple of changes -- substituted ground flax seed for the corn meal, used regular sriracha instead of the recommended garlic version and just added a smidge of pressed garlic to the mix. I thought it still tasted pretty great afterward. Now that I know some "don'ts" I'm looking forward to trying this one again some time.

This was very, very good and nice change of pace for spaghetti squash! Like others have suggested, I kept the squash, veggies, chicken and sauce separate and then put them together in individual dishes.  I don't know if would have turned into a big glob if I had mixed it all together right away, but I didn't want to find out!

This is so great! I used veggie broth in place of chicken broth and omitted the chicken all together. I also added mushrooms for an extra health benefit. There was a lot of sauce so I used more squash. My vegetarian family loved it!

It turned out great. My husband said it was delicious and had two servings. I cooked the spaghetti squash and the chicken early in the day, so it only took about 20 minutes to finish it off. Great for a week night dinner afterwhen you plan ahead.

I made it per the recipe except I replace zucchini with bok choy, and egg instead of chicken.  I found the sauce super non-Pad-Thai-ish, wishing it was more spicy, sweet, and prominent.  This is mostly spaghetti squash and veggies with a mild peanut sauce, although a store bought peanut sauce would have more flavor sadly.   I'll try again but adjust to my spicyness level.  A great base recipe thought!

This is a great way to use spaghetti squash!  We substituted veggie broth and tofu for chicken parts and Sriracha and garlic for chili garlic. The squash stayed firm through the sautee process. All of the sauces did make it taste very salty, which is my only complaint. I imagine this will be tasty leftover dish!

This was incredible. It tasted just as good if not better than the Pad Thai from local Thai restaurants. I wouldn't change a thing. 

The only thing I changed was: I didn't have Rice Vinegar so I substituted for white wine vinegar. That's it.

It has a great peanut butter taste, but not overwhelming. It also has a slight spice to it from the chilli garlic. I would recommend this to ANYONE who loves pad thai.

This is absolutely delicious!  We really didn't miss the noodles (as I usually do when using sp. squash instead of pasta), and had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  I made it with shrimp, but look forward to trying with tofu and chicken as well.  This will definitely be on our menu rotation!

It was good. Hubby loved it. Didn't have all the right ingredients, so improvised with some Wooster sauce. Needs a lot of meat because the rest is all veggies.

Definitely making this again! Used 2/3 rd of spag squash. The veggies I had which were orange and green peppers, yellow squash, 1/2 a yellow onion. Added lots of fresh cilantro at the end. Also used chili paste in place of chili sauce. Did not have oyster sauce or sesame oil so I sprinkled a tsp of sesame seeds in the sauce. What the heck, right? So good.

Love it! Will become a common dish I serve at my home!
I like things a bit spicier so I doubled the heat and added sriracha sauce.

I rated this 5 stars because I was looking for a way to use the spaghetti squash from the garden and so far this was the best recipe that I tried.  It is however missing some hotness, so I added some chili flakes and it still wasn't spicy enough. Also chopped peanuts on top would be great too.  I cooked my squash in the crock pot on high for about 2 hours instead of in the oven.  I will be making this again and making it hotter plus add a splash of lime juice and chopped peanuts on top!

My husband and I are up to our ears in spaghetti squash so we are always looking for new recipes to use them up. This recipe tasted delicious although I felt it was unnecessarily overcomplicated. I didn't have some of the ingredients so I made an adapted version. You could really use any vegetables here, I happened to have string beans, red and green peppers, onion and squash on hand. For my sauce I used this recipe as inspiration but simply combined chicken broth, soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger powder and peanut butter on the stovetop and it was excellent. My hubby added a bit of wasabi to his and enjoyed that flavor as well. We will definitely make this again.

My husband and I really liked this recipe a lot. I made a few modifications that really suited us. I added both garlic and a 1-2 tsps. of maple syrup to the sauce for more flavor. Rather than mixing everything together, I had separate bowls of cooked spaghetti squash, uncooked cole slaw, cooked chicken and green onion, the sauce, AND chopped peanuts to put on top (essential for Pad Thai). This way, people can layer and mix as they please. The slaw is so much better uncooked, much like fresh bean sprouts, to make this dish nice and crunchy and more like the real Pad Thai.

Excellent recipe! We have made this a couple of times and I was pulling it up to make again. I have altered the veggies depending on what's on hand, but haven't seen a need to alter the sauce. I microwave the squash to save time though. Thanks for sharing this keeper!

The basic recipe was just that, the basic recipe. Do not stir fry the spaghetti squash after baking it as it will turn to mush. The sauce was very bland. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of sugar, 3/4 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. salt. Also, the cornstarch needed to thicken the sauce was substantially more. I had about two times as much sauce as I needed so next time I make it I will probably half it. After the modifications, it turned out good.

The flavor was good, but my spaghetti squash turned to mush after cooking and putting in the pan. I will probably try to cook this again and see what happens.
