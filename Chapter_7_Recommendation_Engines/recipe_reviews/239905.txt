Really good recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I subbed almond butter for peanut butter.  Tasty, and on the edge of being too spicy, it made a wonderful lunch.  I tried mine with a squeeze of lime, too.  Yum!

I really liked this recipe. I used No Yolk wheat noodles because I could not find No Yolk Kluski noodles in my area. In stead of using sesame oil because I did not have any, I used olive oil and toasted sesame seeds.

Absolutely delicious! I had to use regular No Yolks because I couldn't find Kluski noodles anywhere, but it was still delicious. I used fresh veggies and a little sambal Olek for extra heat. Some chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice and an ice cold beer and you are all set with this one!

Absolutely loved! I made a few minor changes- we couldn't find sesame oil so we used toasted sesame seeds instead. Also- based on a previous review I used a little bit less peanut butter than what it asks for. The sauce still had a hint of peanut butter in it but was still spicy- which we loved! Did not take long to cook at all! Will definitely make again!

This was delicious!  I doubled the sauce and added approx. 1/2 tsp of cornstarch (I also added the sesame oil directly to this mixture)...I then added the sauce to 3 sliced chicken breasts after the meat was cooked.  1/2 a bag of cooked No Yolks broad noodles (Kluski is not available in Canada) and all fresh veggies that I just tossed in at the end to warm & coat with the sauce so that they remained crunchy: sliced crimini mushrooms, sliced red peppers, broccoli florets, sugar snap peas & carrots sliced into coins.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe!

Waaay too much peanut butter. Next time I'll try using 1/2 tablespoon - 1 tablespoon.

I added cayenne and garlic powder, pan fried the chicken in teriyaki sauce and it was delicious!! Didn't use the sesame oil and it still tasted great! Next time I'll use a little less peanut butter, otherwise it was perfect.

Added garlic and ginger. Used thick rice noodles in place of the No Yolks. Very enjoyable. Thanks for sharing!

This was soooo good. Himself and I really enjoyed it. We don't care for cilantro so I used minced parsley. That was the only change I made. Thanks

I love this dish. I don’t eat spicy food so I leave out the sriracha as it’s too hot for me. I also use udon noodles and morning star chik’n strips instead of the kluski noodles and real chicken but it tastes amazing.

It was delicious, and everybody ate it!  Leftovers were very good as well.  I forgot the lime, but that was my fault.......would have put it over the top!

This was great I would’ve never thought of putting soy sauce, peanut butter, and siracha sauce in the same meal but it goes perfect together. I loved it and will definitely make it again some time.

I found the sauce to be thinner then I anticipated.  I was too cowardly  to add all the sriracha.  Next time I will try the amount called for.  I definitely liked the flavor as a variation on my usual stir fry sauces. You could throw any meat (I used chicken and pork) or vegetables in with it, but I noticed it really seemed to complement the pork.

Absolutely loved this dish. I used rice noodles instead of the no yolks, just because I had them on hand, and it worked great. I followed the recipe exactly, and only omitted the cilantro since I'm not a big fan. The dish came out with a great taste and a little kick because of the Sriracha. Will definitely make it again.

First time making Asian food with noodles.  I doubled the veggies by adding more water chestnuts, mini corn,  bamboo shoots, and broccoli. I also added some garlic, additional siracha and cut down a bit on peanut butter. I made some extra sauce for those who like it heavier. Everyone liked it! Next time they want me to try it with shrimp.

It was pretty good. I doubled the sauce and omitted the sriracha sauce. I think it would have tasted better with the heat, but my daughter is picky. I also drained the chicken and veggies before adding the sauce. I used a 14 oz bag of veggies and would have honestly preferred quite a bit more of them. I could only find an 8 oz bag of noodles and that ended up being a bit too much. Still super yummy.

Mmmmm this is a WIN. I skipped the noodles because I didn't have any and only used 3/4 of the sauce and it was still perfect.

Tasted OK, but a bit too much like Peanut Butter. Even my kids who LOVE Peanut Butter thought so. Maybe a little lighter version would be 1 TBLP Peanut Butter and 1/4 cup of fresh peanuts sauteed into it.

Awesome recipe and it's easy to keep almost all the ingredients on hand.  I swapped the chicken out for pan fried tofu and used red pepper flakes instead of siracha.  I also added mushrooms, ginger and a light sprinkle of cumin.  Will be making this again!
