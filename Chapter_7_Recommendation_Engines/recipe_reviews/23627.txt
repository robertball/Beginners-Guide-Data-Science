For so few ingredients, this was wonderful. I made a few changes though, I lined my sheet with foil and sprayed with cooking spray first. Then I laid the chicken out on the foil and sprayed each piece with cooking spray (it is just canola oil after all). This was easier than the teaspoon of corn oil and faster as well. Seasonings were great. Family loved it. Will make it again.

Quick and EASY!  I used a little melted butter instead of oil and seasoned salt instead of garlic salt along with fresh cracked pepper.  My kids LOVED it :)

Soooo easy.  I used olive oil, garlic powder, fresh pepper, a little salt, and an Italian seasoning blend.  Deeelish!  The cooking temp & time was spot on.

I spray the chicken legs with coconut oil spray (Pam works too), then sprinkle with AR's Creole Seasoning Blend. Turn each leg over as you spray and sprinkle, then do the other sade. I have a jumbo portion of drumsticks, so we'll have some tonight, then I'll refrigerate the leftovers for an easy beach luncheon. I've used this recipe for years, and my kids love it! (they're now 13 & 15)

I added chili powder, garlic, and onions to the oil mixture, marinated for about 4 hours and left everything on there when I cooked it.  It was pretty good.  My only problem with chicken is the problem of infusing the chicken with flavour; it's dang near impossible.  Overall not bad, the onions and garlic and chili powder gave it a BIG boost, I think.

Quick and easy and a crowd pleaser. But I don't use spread or garlic powder. Minced a clove of garlic and nuked it with some butter instead. Brushed that on the legs. Lots of salt and pepper and that's it. How can it be so simple?

Very simple and tasty, especially if you spray the chicken with the oil. I skinned mine to reduce fat and they were still moist and flavorful.

Very tasty!  I used local, farm-raised chicken drumsticks with the skin on, seasoned with salt and pepper, and smothered with butter and minced garlic.  Basted the drumsticks for the last ten minutes in the oven.  Oh so good.

This was quite good, and very easy. I sprayed it down with olive oil instead and added dried minced onion. These were notably better fresh rather than reheated.

This is a very simple and basic way to cook chicken. I did use drumsticks for myself, but baked a chicken breast for my husband as he prefers white meat. Tasty!

Five stars because the time and temp resulted in very moist chicken.  I tossed fresh garlic in the food processor with some butter and light olive oil, salt and pepper and blended till it was a light paste.  I rolled the chicken in it and put it on the oil-sprayed rack of the roasting pan for thirty minutes, flipped, cooked for another thirty-five minutes, and got a perfect 165 on the instant-read thermometer.  I let it set for five minutes and it was very juicy.  I do think it needed more seasoning but it is a good foundation for juicy baked drumsticks.

I did two things different than the recipe called for....
One- I (or rather, I made my teenager do it) removed the skin from the chicken legs.
Two- I used cooking spray instead of oil.
Cooked as directed, half an hour, flipped then another 40 minutes. Turned out really good! I usually just slather these suckers in store bought bbq sauce and call it good but this is a GREAT alternative to that. Yum!

All the grease from the drumsticks washed off the spices while cooking so we had to add it again after cooking.  Maybe grilling would work better as the grease will all away.

How does this recipe receive such great reviews? Because it is just a great recipe. People absolutely RAVED over this when I made it. I have been cooking for 35 years and was surprised by how well this chicken turned out. The only change I made was a little onion powder and cooked an extra 10 mins each side because I used larger sized drumsticks. Perfect recipe!

We went skinless so also used a bit of paprika and cayenne for color - turned out beautifully in the allotted cooking time; juicy and tender. Served with rice and green beans. No leftovers!

I didn't have any corn oil so I substituted for what I had in the house already (margarine) and my husband loved it. It was cooked perfectly and was very moist and tender inside the chicken. Also I used chicken thighs instead of legs. Would definitely make this again!

This recipe was a hit with my ENTIRE family - my husband, myself & all 4 of our kids (very rare occurrence!)  I melted some real, salted butter with some minced garlic and brushed it on in place of the corn oil spread.  Then I seasoned with garlic powder, salt & pepper.  I basted the drumsticks again with the butter mixture during the last 8 or so minutes, then broiled for a few minutes on each side to get a little browning/crispiness.  I served it with creamed corn and a garden salad.  Delish!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has become a staple in my chicken cooking. Making up recipes or cooking ingredients doesn't come naturally to me, so these instructions were a perfect starting point for me and something that I have built off of with other seasonings, spice/pepper mixtures, fresh garlic, etc. But first, follow this recipe to a "T" and you'll be very glad that you did.

So simple yet so delicious.  I make it all the time now with chicken legs or thighs or drums.  Try using Mc Cormick Montreal Chicken seasoning instead of garlic salt & pepper.  Super easy dinner.

I was in a mood for barbeque, so I rubbed a tablespoon of smokey BBQ sauce on each leg along with salt & pepper and baked as directed.  Easy and delicious.

Yummy. I do it just a little differently though. I line my pan with foil for easy clean up. Spray it with some cooking oil spray. Clean my legs and put 'em in a freezer bag and put some olive oil in (I don't measure) the close the bag and swish them around in there to coat. To change up the seasonings I use a yummy lemon pepper seasoning I have sometimes.

Great results on my first attempt. Swapped up the spices a bit and followed the advice to broil for appearance. My hubby and adult stepdaughter loved it.

This method nails it every time. Of course you can spice it up differently or do whatever. I add some various spices to spruce it up but always use this method.

I'm not a good cook, but I had no problems making this.  I don't know what corn oil is, but I have olive oil in the kitchen, I used that and did everything else as instructed.  A hit in the house with the kid that doesn't like chicken!

I tried this yesterday, and it was amazing! It was so simple and easy to make. My fiancée and I couldn't have enough of it. The only alteration I made was the following. I poked the drumsticks a few times with a shish-kabob stick to create small holes and allow for the seasonings to go in (as well as to help the chicken cook thoroughly) and I added Chipotle Chile Pepper seasoning to the salt and pepper to give it a bit of spice. Then, I rubbed the ingredients with slightly melted butter to make sure that it seeped into the chicken. It was great! We had it with fried rice. I will be making this again soon.

Excellent! Winner as is, we used it with a bottle of jerk seasoning brought back from a Jamaican vacation. Delicious. Unbelievable simple. Wasn't sure what corn oil spread was, I followed another reviewer and used cooking spray (mine was a mix of canola, palm, and coconut oils). I can't say enough good things. Tender, juicy meat inside of a crispy, crunchy flavorful skin. Can't get much better. And for those watching their calories, not too bad without any butter - you will not miss the butter if you add some of your other favorite spices and herbs. This will be my go-to recipe for drumsticks whenever they are on sale!

So I made it a little different. I used melted butter and I put a clove of minced garlic in the butter for flavoring. I partially strained the garlic out of the butter and then put the butter on the chicken. I did garlic powder and pepper . I cooked as stated and in the last 3 minutes, I put some grated Parmesan cheese on the top. I cooked for 65 minutes total. Was absolutely delish! My fiancé loved it and so did I! This is totally going in my recipe box for the future!

Surprisingly good for something so simple. Juicy, tender, and cook time/temp was perfect. My son had requested drumsticks (after seeing characters from "The Hobbit" game eating them) lol so this was the first time I've ever made them. Turned out exactly as expected. I used Pam and lines my sheet w foil, seasoned as directed.

My kids love drumsticks but I don't usually make them because they're tasteless and I never get the cooking time perfect. THIS was a perfect recipe! I didn't have corn oil so i used some butter. This is a simple keeper for all cuts of chicken! THANK YOU!

I will definitely make this chicken again.  I have been looking for a simple baked chicken dish that comes out the same consistently.  The chicken was moist and well cooked.  The baking time of 70 minutes (30 minutes, flip, 40 minutes) was perfect.

I combined other suggestions from reviewers - lining the pan with foil, using cooking spray on the lined foil and spraying the chicken with the cooking spray instead of the oil.  I also used adobo instead of the garlic salt.  Also used the pepper.

Perfect!

I added pads of butter of top of each chicken drumstick, as well as chili powder, and this was very good. For me, it still needed salt afterwards, but still good, and very easy and simple!

This was super simple and super yummy! My whole family loved it. Frugal and easy for a family of four.
I added a sprinkle of oregano to mine for a bit of Mediterranean flair. Made the whole house smell so good too! 
Thank you for this recipe

Simple and delish! I did this with broken down chicken legs, so I cooked both drumsticks and thighs. I will definately make this again because it tasted wonderful and was very very easy!

I've been making variations of this for years.  Tonight I used a bit of soy sauce mixed in with the oil and painted that on with a basting brush.  I then seasoned with garlic salt, garlic powder, pepper and paprika.  The timing on this recipe was perfect!

I followed the other reviewers' advice and just sprayed each chicken piece with a little canola oil spray. Much quicker and cleaner than brushing! I sprinkled mine with a hefty amount of Cajun seasoning. YUM!!
