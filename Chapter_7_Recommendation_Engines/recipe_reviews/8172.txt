This was a hit at my party!  I served it as a trifle and put fresh blueberries on top.  I did have a lot of the whipped cream mixture left, I think next time I will try 12oz of whipped topping instead of 16oz.

This was a very light and refreshing dessert.  I used the 12 oz. container of whipped topping as the 16 oz. would have been way too much.  I used light cream cheese and light whipped topping and it was delicious.  I took it to a Bible study and everyone had seconds.  Great dessert for a spring meal or anytime you need something sweet, but not too heavy.

Absolutely easy and delicious!  (I do agree with another reviewer that I'll try 12 oz. frozen whipped topping instead of 16 oz. because of a similar overflow problem.)  Of note, it tasted even better the longer it was refrigerated - 24 hours plus.  I'm anxious to try it again using another favorite fruit topping.  Enjoy!  Enjoy!

I made some serious changes to this recipe.  My family is not big on trifle, so I made it as a cake!  First, I bought fresh blueberries. 

I mixed together 12ozs lite whipped cream, blueberry flavored cream cheese and about 1/4 cup milk.  No sugar.  Then, I added about 1/4 of the blueberries.  I cut my cake in half, and spread some of the whipped cream mixture between the layers.  Then I covered the rest of the cake with the mixture.  I cooked the rest of the blueberries making essentially pie filling.  I drizzled that on the top of the cake.  It was delicious!  My family all went back for seconds.  We will be making this again and again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

It seemed like there was too much whipped filling--alot ran over the pan.  I'm not sure if I goofed, or what happened.  Nevertheless, it tasted delicious.  It would be absolutely wonderful on those hot summer days.

I made this into a trifle so it would look pretty in my trifle dish. I think next time I will add less milk with the cream cheese. It turned out rather soupy. I should have listened to other reviews. I added layers of lemon pudding to it as well, and thought it turned out very nice. My DH loved it. With my change you can eat the yellow snow. Thanks FRULLA!

I used 2 cups non fat vanilla yogurt instead of cream cheese (my youngest hates cream cheese) and milk. This was wonderful! I served it in a huge "martini" glass and used martini glasses to serve to my guests. The presentaion was wonderful!

Well I made 2 of the desserts for a church function.  I made the blueberry one with the blueberry flavored cream cheese.  It added a bit more flavor.  I also divided the pan into 1/2 angel food cake and the other half pound cake.  I'd definitely use the angel food cake.  Now here is the kicker.  I made the other pan using strawberry flavored cream cheese and strawberry flavored cool whip with the strawberry pie filling and a few fresh strawberries over the angle food cake.  This pan was gone in less than 10 mins!  Even with me using the bb flavored cheese, I brought half of the pan back home.  I will definitely make the strawberry snowball (which I rate *****)
again before the summer is out.

I decided to make this recipe because I had a can of blueberry pie filling left in the cabinet that I wanted to use. It ended up being a very good & light dessert.  I only used 12 oz of cool whip as others had suggested and I cut the milk to 1/2 cup because I thought a full cup would be too much. I think this recipe would be great with strawberry or cherry pie filling as well.  Definitely a redo.

Loved the taste and ease of putting together the dessert.  Cream cheese and blueberries are great together.  I added one cup of fresh blueberries to the filling and some almond extract to take away the "canned" taste.  Leftovers were even better two days later.  Thanks, Frulla!

I reduced the cool whip also - instead of canned filling I made my own from this site with my frozen blueberries--very good!!  When I poured the creamy mixture over the cake I wiggled the cake around slightly so some of it would seep down between the cake pieces.  Left it overnight and it was perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone really liked it.  My only negative is that the cream cheese mixture was runny due the 1 cup milk, that you couldn't spread the pie filling evenly on top.  Next time, I'll either put the pie filling on the cake cubes first, or reduce the milk.

Made this for our monthly ladies gathering.  Used Lite Cool Whip, FatFree Cream Cheese, and skim milk.  Turned out fabulous and everyone loved it.  Very light which makes it perfect for a summer dish.  I did take a reviewer's suggestion and only used the 12oz cool whip - still the topping overflowed the pan.  I dumpled the pie filling in a bowl and served it separately.  Will definitely make again!!

I used this as and idea for something similar, so I'm not sure how fair it is for me to rate this, but I'm going to anyway.
Rather than angel food cake pieces, I baked a pound cake in a 9x13 pan.  It was a little too high to allow for the cream and topping, so I ended up cutting off the dome plus a little extra, leaving about a 1-1/2" base.  Not a fan of the frozen whipped toping, I used a 1/2 pint of whipped cream - the real stuff, not what you find in an aerosol can!  For the cream cheese mixture, I cut the milk down to about 3/4 cup.  The whipped cream must be folded in very carefully!
Canned pie filling never has enough fruit for my taste, so in addition to the "more fruit" filling, I also mixed in a bag of frozen wild blueberries.
It all turned out very yummy!
Next time, I want to try it with fresh strawberries!

This was so good.  I cut down on the cool whip and milk.  Thought that much milk would make it to runny.  I used blueberry and cherry pie filling layered it all with the cake and cream mixture.  It was so pretty in the trifle bowl.  A great dessert to take for a Fourth of July party with the red, white and blue colors!

I must have done something wrong, but don't think so. I think if you add some fresh blueberries, strawberries, and/or other berries it might help. This is just my opinion, but no one in our group of 10 liked this recipe. I was so disappointed as I took it for Memorial Day weekend dinner and my job was the dessert. :0(

Really!! liked this one.  Would have given 5 stars but altered per some reviews. Used strawberry pie filling instead of blueberry.  Used strawberry cream cheese (and 1/4t. strawberry extract). No additional sugar in the filling (strawberry cream cheese is already sweetened). Reduced milk to 1/2c. And lastly, made my own whipped topping- 12oz. heavy cream whipped with 1 T. confec. sugar.  Topped with slightly sweetened sliced fresh strawberries. RESOUNDING success at the potluck.

This was excellent the first time, but I changed it to make it my own.  I only used 12 oz. cool whip and cherries instead of blueberries, then marbled the cherry and cool whip mixture, looks beautiful and is delicious.

I found it was even better to mix the pieces of angel food cake into the rest of the mix. And in a pinch, a jar of any flavor of jam worked great in place of the blueberry filling and sugar!

Very, very easy to make.  Light and creamy and refreshing.  I personally could eat half of it in one sitting.  My whole family raved about how good it was and my sister-in-law asked for the recipe.

Very yummy and easy.  I cut down the whipped topping a bit (to about 12 oz).  I had a bit of an issue blending the cream cheese with the milk and sugar, but after using an electric mixer, it smoothed out.  I might also use a bit more blueberry pie filling next time.

I brought it to a get together and it all went.  I tried it a second time and layered it in a trifle dish instead of the 9 X 13 it worked out great.  I also tried it with Strawberries.  Great recipe to take to potlucks.
