The first time we made it, we liked it but this time it wasn't good at all: too sweet.  The chicken came out tender but the flavor wasn't good.  We might make it again, but instead of using lemon yogurt, we will use plain yogurt with some lemon juice and a little sweetener.  As written, I wouldn't make this again.
