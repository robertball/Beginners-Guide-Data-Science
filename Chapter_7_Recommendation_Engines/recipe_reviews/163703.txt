Very good, but I only used one can of green chilies. I also used light cheese. I topped it with some sour cream cream - perfect for a light meal.

As I was making this recipe it seemed as if there would be way too many green chiles and cheese in it. I was eating it for breakfast si I actually wanted some eggs and not a big glob of green chiles and cheese. I only used one 4oz can of green chiles and about 1.25-1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. I added about a quarter cup of crumbled bacon pieces and a few sprinkles of salt. Didn't use a pie plate but a round Pampered Chef deep dish baker (stoneware) sprayed with vegetable oil. Baked at 375 as directed for 35 mins and it came out Delicious!

Quick N easy. I used one can of chiles. I thought two would be a bit much for my taste. I did add a small tomato diced and chopped bacon. Fresh mushrooms would of been good also.

I was only cooking for myself, so I made two ramkins of this dish.  Didn't have any green chiles, so used chili verde salsa instead.  Turned out great.

Made as written with the exception of using only one can of green chilies. This recipe produced flavorful, creamy eggs. The baking time for me was spot on, and the eggs came out of the baking dish beautifully with no mess left behind. This didn't even require the addition of salt or pepper. Perfect! Thank you for a great recipe.

I enjoyed this, but Hubs not so much. I skipped the flour and reduced the amount of cheese and chilies significantly to suit our tastes.  A cup of cheese and a can of green chiles to just three eggs seemed like overkill to me.  I made this in individual au gratin dishes and topped each with sour cream, chopped tomatoes and black olives.

YUM! I was looking for something different to make for breakfast and came across this recipe. Taking the comments of other cooks to heart, I used only 1 can of the green chiles, added some diced bacon to the mix as well as 1/4 t salt. I just throw in the shredded cheddar and have a sneaking suspicion it is less than the designated 2 cups though it is definitely cheesey. I have made it twice and the family loves this breakfast treat!

I used two full eggs and four egg whites, I left out the flour and I cut the cheese back to 1/4 cup. I did not use the two cans of green chilies, one was more than plenty. This is a good place to start, but I think it would have been better with some chopped vegetables. Cooking it in the oven wasn't necessary. A little butter in the skillet and in five minutes, it was done.

Super easy and very good!  I used 7 eggs, cut back a tiny bit on the green chilies, and seasoned a little with pepper, garlic salt, and cumin.  No leftovers!

We LOVE this!   I make it on the weekends and my daughter took the recipe to college with her.  I have made it with both fat-free and regular cheese and there is no taste difference.  When my daughter was in town I just used 1 can of green chilies.  Now that she is gone it will be back up to 2 cans.

I'd be like others and cut the chili's to just one can. I make this and add chopped tomatoes and sliced green onions. Sometimes I add chopped ham. It's delicious served with some salsa.

Pretty good - although I think the baking time is too long. Mine came out a bit overdone. Be sure to watch it carefully!

Necessity is the Mother of Invention. This morning I decided to make this dish. Well, I only had five eggs but as I cracked them, thinking I would substitute a 1/4 cup of oil for the missing egg, however, I found the fifth egg already cracked and threw it away. Two eggs short I used a vegan substitute grind two tablespoon of flax powder mixed with three tablespoons of water each. That worked fine I found I had already used my last green chilies. So I substituted Rotel spicy tomatoes and peppers. I used two cups of Mexican Cheese in lieu of Cheddar. It was fantastic, but I still want to make the real recipe as I am sure it is good.

OK, I cannot properly rate this recipe - I totally changed it up. I will probably try the original recipe sometime, though.  Here's what I did (sorry if this recipe is confusing): YIELD 2 SERVINGS   - 2 eggs   - slosh of milk   - 1/4 c cheddar   - 3 T diced tomatoes   - dash cayenne pepper   - 1 c cooked pasta  Spray skillet with nostick spray. Add eggs, pasta, cayenne pepper, tomatoes, and milk. Scramble till the eggs are cooked. Serve hot. Top with cheese. Add another dash of cayenne pepper for more heat. Enjoy!

Great recipe and easy to make.  Instead of canned green chiles I use 4-8 fresh roasted green chiles. (Depend on the size) Green chiles does not necessarily mean hot. Use can use mild also. I love the fresh ones because I love the flavor of the chiles.

This was delicious!  with the changes below it had the perfect amount of spice.  it had a little heat ,but my 5 and 7 year old were able to enjoy it as well.
I followed the recipe except for these changes:
1 10 oz can of Ro-tel original tomatoes (tomatoes & Chilies) drained instead of the green chilies.
4 strips of bacon chopped
1 1/2 cups of seasoned cheese (I used habanero taco would probably be good too)

Just waaaaay too much cheese.  Pretty good flavor, but half the cheese and some extra eggs are required along w/ some garlic and seasoning to make this a good dish.

This was delicious. I don't usually like a lot of heat so, as other reviewers suggested, I went with half the chilis but it was so mild I think I would have liked it as much with a little more of them. I also used only half the cheese and again, it was great but would have been just as good with more. The men's group at our church has a breakfast meeting every month and I'm going to recommend this one to them as well as making it again for us.

I loved it.  It was quick and very easy.  I love green chile. 
I used the recipe as printed from memory.  I did not print it.  The only difference was that I put  in the Microware for 4 minutes stirred and returned for 2 more minutes. Let it sit to cool and cut into six slices like pizza.  Served on small plates with Ortea Green Sauce  and sliced tomatoes.  It was great.  Later in the day the leftovers were used for burritos. Great Again

Delicious. The only change I made was using fresh roasted hot chilis rather than canned. I used about a cup. Was so delicious! Light and fluffy. I live in higher altitude and had to bake for an additional 10 minutes

Delicious!  Tastes great with fresh tomatoes and avocados on top after cooking.

We all loved this EASY healthy recipe. Like another, I omitted the flour - we are trying to eat low carb -. I added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, drained and some queso fresca. Really great simple recipe. Add what you have on hand and you've created a wonderful meal.  Thanks for a great one.

Made it this morning exactly as recipe suggests.  It was perfect with our Sunday morning football Bloody Marys.  Delicious and simple!

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but had some leftover green chilies that needed to used.  I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  I did not use the flour and really didn't miss it.

Mini Quiche Hors d'oeuvre -- GREAT!!

I made this recipe as written EXCEPT ... 1 can green chilis instead of 2, and a pie crust.  Baked crust first in a 9X13 cake pan, then baked filling as directed on top of crust.  Sliced into small squares and served.  Wonderful "finger food".

I added frozen tater tots to the mixture and then poured it into an 8x8 dish. Turned out delicious. This recipe is a keeper.
