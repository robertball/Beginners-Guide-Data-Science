Last night for dinner, served with left over rice and lightly stir fried veggies. We don't have a grill. I broiled these as long thin meat patties, without using the skewer.  A few minutes under the broiler and done!  The only actual recipe change was to use tamarind paste mixed into the pork. More of a Phad Thai flavor profile. Thanks so much for a great idea and a way to use up some ground pork.

eh not a fan, followed the recipe as-is and I was less than impressed, maybe we just aren't a fan of the fish sauce. Not sure but won't be making again. Thanks anyway for your submission

Amazing! My picky husband loved them. Great as an appetizer on the stick or as a meal with rice.
I accidentally put the baking powder in with the rest of the ingredients (missed the part about dissolving the baking powder in water), and that didnâ€™t seem to do any damage.

This was excellent! I was a bit worried that they would be too sweet and also lack flavor but I was wrong. Everything about this was excellent. Don't skip the baking powder. It plays a big part in the texture. 5 stars!
