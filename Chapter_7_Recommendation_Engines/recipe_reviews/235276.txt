I used the honey like he mentioned, and a little more garlic than the recipe called for, both excellent choices. But... I also made a batch and used pineapple juice instead of vinegar... OMG! WHAT A GAME CHANGER! I've had people offer to pay the cost ANN pay for my time to make it for them!

For a Sriracha lover this is a fantastic recipe.  The hardest part is find Fresno chilies. And please do not throw away the bits left after sieving. Spread on a cooking sheet and bake in a 200 degree oven for an hour or so until dry. Then run through a processor. That is the real gold!

This is really close to what I came up with.  I might use slightly less vinegar, and a add a bit of starter made with brewer's yeast to kick start fermentation.  However, either way, I can't go back to the store bought Sriracha any more as the homemade really is that much better.

I try to make bigger batches and then water bath it into smaller jars to give to friends.  Also freezes well if you go for that 10-15lb batch.

This is almost the same process as Tabasco, the red peppers, salt and fermentation, straining and heating. Great combination!
I have one suggestion, do not throw the mash away after straining, wrap it in a cheesecloth corner (make a pouch)and use it for seasoning ANYTHIN' you boil; shrimp, crabs, crawfish, potatoes, chicken, noodles.... 
one CAVEAT, cover the lid while boiling, if you don't you will basically OC everyone in the house. Enjoy!

I wonder how would it taste if you skipped the cooking step.  It would be full of beneficial bacteria which is very healthy.

I made this sauce I didn't get a lot of bubbles after 5 days so I don't know if it's good, seems to be to thin.

I made this with ghost peppers and WOW!! Great flavor from the ferment, didn't cook mine to keep all the beneficial bacteria. Will be making another batch with pineapple juice as someone suggested.

I’ve made this sauce for 3 years now and have canned it for use throughout the year. It’s awesome!  Just hot water bath jars of it for 10 minutes after the boil. Plenty of acid.  I took the advice of the reviewer that dried the solids, and wow!  Never throw those away!  Spread the solids out on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and dry in the oven on warm overnight until crispy. Put them in a food processor and turn into dust. I like the dust just as much as the sauce!  Not quite as hot, but great flavor.

By far better than any other sauce I've ever bought. I added some red bell peppers, some habanero peppers, and I doubled the garlic. I also used the pineapple juice like someone suggested and juiced a lemon....freaking mind blowing! Now my kids won't eat any other sriracha sauce LoL!

I'm in the middle of my process and it looks and smells  pretty good. However, I live in Brasil, up North, in the middle of the Amazon forest, so, we have a pretty damp and hot weather. Even in the coolest place of my house, the mixture took 24 hours to get bubbly! I'll give it 12 more, just to be sure...but be aware of the different results for different weather.

The 2nd ingredient in store bought Sriracha is sugar. Don't think that much is necessary. I buy hot sauces all the time and none have sugar listed.

This is absolutely fantastic! I made it exactly as written with one exception. I had to use green serrano peppers because I could not find the red serranos.  It has a very fresh hot sauce taste. Perfect with tacos! Love, love, love it!

I changed it a bit.....  I used a lot of small capsicum (60%) which I first grilled to blacken the skin a bit. I also added the equivalent of an espresso coffee. The rest was all the same.   I let it ferment for  5 days.
Im loving it but will make it more chilli next time, but not a lot.

Made this sauce with the ton of jalepenos from the garden.  Substituted garden habeneros for the serranos, but only used half of weight called for, since habeneros are so much hotter on the Richter scale.  Doubled the recipe, adjusted to a bit more garlic and a tweak more vinegar.  Holy cow, heat and flavor!  May try pineapple juice as Brian B. suggests.  Am on my 3rd batch now.  5 stars!

I used homegrown mammoth and mucho nacho jalapeños, fresnos, and cowhorns.  The initial purée filled two-thirds of a quart mason jar.  I put the jar in a kitchen cabinet late in the day and stirred it the next morning.  The following  morning, I went to stir it again and the purée had overtopped the jar, though the plastic wrap retained all but some liquid, which ran down the side of the jar.  The level went down substantially when I stirred it to release the gas bubbles.  I put the jar inside another container to catch any liquid that might escape and stirred twice a day.  Three days was enough to get quite a bit of fermentation going.  I also used 5% apple cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar because I use I it in all of my salsas that I can.  It keeps the acid level up for water bath canning without adding too much sour/bitter taste.  My husband loves sriracha and we have loads of red hot peppers from our garden that need something done with them.

I use NuSalt, go a little heavy on the brown sugar and garlic then finish with pineapple juice instead of distilled white vinegar.  I use only fully ripe red hot peppers. So far I've used red Jalapenos, red Seranno, red Fresno and red Anaheim peppers.  The finished product is way better than store bought. Currently I have 1# of red Serrano peppers and 1/2# of red Jalapeno peppers fermenting because I'm getting low on my stock of Jalapeno peppers.  Will Cayenne and Tabasco peppers work well in this recipe? I'm reluctant to risk my remaining stock of reds. I can't go back to store bought after this, both for the taste and the low sodium because I pile this stuff on everything.

I recently radically changed my diet due to health concerns... This meant cutting out ALL sugar... no honey, agave, syrup, sugar. Of course, all sriracha has some form of sugar in it so I knew I had to make some from scratch. 

I essentially followed this recipe (couldn't find red jalepenos so altered a touch) and substituted sugar with monk fruit. 

It turned out great! Next time I might add extra garlic and some onion, though.

I added one inch of ginger to mine, one less garlic clove, and used rice wine vinegar instead of white. I think it tastes just a little closer to the store bought. I also thickened with Chia seed before straining.

I made it in the food processor instead of the blender and got very few bubbles.  Then I cooked it down too long and made Syrup of Sriracha!  It is very thick.  I aqm now making it again... blended, with more water,  

It looks more like Chef John's, and 
I have hope.  The Fresno chilies have been in the freezer for a couple of weeks, but from the special I recently saw on wine it should still be OK.  If not, I will have to go back to the drawing board!

I used powdered product and some sweet bell peppers to make it milder. It bubbled A LOT, so if you do this using powdered peppers make sure you stir it more than once per day.

My entire family absolutely love this recipe! It was full of flavor and dept.  Everyone said it's much much better than the store bought rooster sauce.    I made two batches, one with 1 lb and the other one with 1 1/2 lbs of red pepper while keeping the rest of the ingredients the same - both came out absolutely lovely.  Also I substituted regular distill vinegar for the seasoned rice vinegar and it was fantastic.  Saw bubbles on the 1st day of fermentation so that was not a problem at all.

Well I reckon it will be 5 stars. I made a massive booboo by adding half the vinegar at the fermentation stage, 10 days ago. No bubbles. I imagine vinegar stopped fermentation process. Can it be saved..... please! Collected 100 odd varied chillies from garden!!!  Please email me on ausshanea@yahoo.com.au if you can help

Much hotter version
Used 2-3/4 pounds of habaneros and ghost peppers with 1/4 pound jalapeno peppers
Second time, but double batch this time. Took longer to ferment than the 5 days, but that happened last time as well.
Use the sauce for making homemade sauce, and other.
Makes for some really good buffalo wings or versions thereof

Made this last Fall with home-grown red Scotch Bonnets.  Aged them about six weeks and bottled them in 8.5 fl oz Quadra bottles just like in the video.  A bit hotter and less sweet than store-bought.  I used a little less sugar (2Tb).  Gave one bottle as Christmas gift and two bottles are still in the pantry continuing to age (the ph. balance was acidic enough to be shelf-stable).  Strained the sauce before bottling and dried the dregs in our food dehydrator.  Ground those up with a mortar/pestle, then sifted through a fine mesh strainer and had some nice ground sriracha-pepper powder for soups and such.  Great Stuff!!

This is the second time I made this sauce. I used peppers grown from my garden, which included half a pound of Thai Chili peppers as well as a type of red pepper I have yet to identify. This second time  I also added ginger, black pepper, basil, rosemary, sage, and thyme all fresh from my garden.

This is so good, I have made this twice now and can agree with the comment, the gold is drying out the mash left over after squeezing. 200°F for about 1 hour is perfect. Blend and mix with dry rub seasoning...wow. I also use extra honey. The first time I used straight ghost pepper, delicious...and hot. The second time, half Fresno chili's and half red habanero. Love it!

Haven't made it yet but this is to say the video presentation was really good. Just wonder why the comments were not answered.
