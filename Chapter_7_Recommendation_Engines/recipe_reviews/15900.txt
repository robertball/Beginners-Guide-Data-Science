Our family makes this same pie and it's delicious.  The other reviewer said it didn't set up....I think this is because the cooking time is off.  Our recipe calls for 25 mins baking time, take the pie out, turn the oven off, apply sour cream topping and then put back in the turned off oven for an additional 10 mins.  Let cool and chill.

Thank you.  I too, have this receipe from my mother and with several moves I lost it.  This is the best Cheese Pie receipe.  Very creamy, rich and all of my family wants the last piece.  Most make cakes and remember this is a pie.

This was a good recipe, but needs some tweaking.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked for the recommended time but the pie never really formed properly.  I baked for an additional 5 minutes, then took it out to sit before adding the sour cream. I baked for another 10 minutes and it still wasn't ready, so I baked for another 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven for fear of over baking.  After 10 hours in the fridge, it still wasn't fully formed.  I think in the future it needs to be cooked a bit longer before adding the sour cream.  I might also take the sugar in the cream cheese mixture down a tad.

I had this served to me at a dinner party and the hostess complained it did not set up so I asked her for the recipe because it was so delicious anyway. Then I found this in my recipe box exactly like hers. After reading the reviews and my own experience, I tried these changes with AMAZING results: Use a whole cube of butter with 9 whole graham crackers in a 9-inch pie glass pie plate. Use 2 8-oz blocks of cream cheese, softened with juice of 1/2 lemon and the zest. After the crust bake, let cool 15 min. bake with the filling 22-25 minutes. Cool again for 15 min. turn oven off, put in with the sour cream topping (I added lemon juice & zest) and a teaspoon of vanilla. Cool in fridge overnight and take out 2 hours before serving with a medley of fresh berries pressed into the top (I used blueberries, raspberries, and you guessed it - boysenberries!) Beautiful presentation. Unfortunately, there will not be a single slice left!!!

Wow- I messed it up and it STILL turned out great! I accidentally added the sour cream to the batter soo... I threw some blueberries on top of the pie crust then added 1/2 the mixture & baked it for 25 min. It ended up being outstanding (and quick) blueberry cheesecake! I took the other 1/2 and added 1C flour, 1/4 tsp ea. baking soda & powder and turned it into coffee cake when topped with Streussel

I made the mistake of not checking the reviews first.It was longer than 15 minutes to make when I put on the sour cream,it sank into the cheese filling.It was marbled but still tasted great.The recipe should be accurate.It's not like making soup and you can add extra stuff.

This turned out amazing! Everyone loved it. I did make some changes due to what I had. I used 2 8oz. Packages of cream cheese. And I used 2 full eggs and an additional yolk from a third egg.  I followed the recipe with those two changes and it turned out fantastic, and perfectly formed. I baked it for 30 mins, took it out of the oven and turned off oven and cooled for 10 pie for 10 mins before putting the sour cream layer on and then returned to the off oven for 10 mins. Took it out and cooled it and then chilled over night in the fridge. I had some fresh raspberries and made a syrup for the top. This would be excellent with a chocolate ganache for the top as well.
