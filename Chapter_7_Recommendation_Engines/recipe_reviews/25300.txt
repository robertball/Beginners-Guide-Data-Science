I have made this 2 times now & it will definately become a regular meal at our house. Both times I halved the original recipe, which was plenty for our small family. Next time I will make a full batch & freeze half. I also substituted Italian sausage for the ground beef. It definately makes for a rich dish. YUM! TIP: I put the filling in a Ziploc baggie, snip the end & use it to "pipe" the filling into the manicotti shells.

Excellent recipe! Thank you :)
A little tip for easy Manicotti Noodle prep... Stuffing the shells can be VERY time consuming. I parboil the noodles (half of the box requested boil time) and I cut a slit down the backside and open it up into a square and add the filling. I roll it back together and place it in the pan slit side down. No one knows the difference once it is cooked in the sauce!

Oh man, is this AMAZING.  Followed a recommendation, and halved the garlic and used 1/2 pound sausage and 1/2 pound beef.  It took a while to make, but it was not hard by any means - something you open a bottle of wine while making; by the time the wine is done, the incredible meal is done as well.  The white sauce TOTALLY makes the dish, and goes well with Ragu Traditional, which is mild enough to not overpower anything else.  The manicotti stuffing would definately have been bland, if not for the sausage and the Italian seasonings I added (this is a MUST).  Thanks though, adding this to my recipe box as I write this!!!!!!

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT dish!! For those of you that are unsure if you should try this or not-- just do it! You will not be sorry............................................I do have one suggestion, instead of ground beef, substitute italian sausage! Much more flavorful and delicious. This entree is not difficult at all, in fact, it is a lot of fun to prepare. I grew up in an italian household and this dish is extremely authentic tasting. You will love it! My husband was so impressed with this dish, and could not stop raving about it while he was eating...  Overall grade" A+++

I loved this recipe. I omitted the chicken boullion cubes. Instead of cooking the pasta before I baked it, I stuffed them uncooked.  I made sure there was enough sauce to cover the pasta, and I covered the dish tightly with aluminum foil.  I then baked it at 400 degrees  for 40 minutes.  It was fantastic!! This is one of my favorite recipes, and I have made it with either ground beef or ground Italian sausage.

This recipe was very good except for the fact of the white sauce making the dish way toooooooo SALTY!  I agree with a previous reviewer that the chicken bouillon needs to be reduced or just removed completely.  Also, I used 3/4 pound of italian sausage mixed with 1/4 pound of ground sirloin along with 1 1/2 pounds of ricotta.  Doesn't really take as long as you think it would to prepare, especially if you condense down the instructions.  Will definately make this one again, but will omit the chicken bouillon.

As with the other recommendations, I substituted the hamburger with Italian sausage.  I also put the red sauce on top first and then "ribboned" the white sauce for a prettier appearance.  I did not think this was all that time consuming, especially if you use a ziploc bag with the tip cut off to stuff the shells.  And it freezes great!  Freeze once assembled and then put it in the fridge the night before to thaw.  This will be a regular at our house.

Amazing. It was time consuming but worth it - every once in a while. I followed other's advice and used Italian Sausage in place of ground beef. YUM! I also made ½ the manicotti spinach free for the non-green compatible in my family. Used Prego mushroom spaghetti sauce and it was pre-seasoned so I ditched the basil at the end as over kill. I used heavy whipping cream for the cream sauce because that is what was in the frig. Not sure what this did to the taste, and trying not to think what it did to the calorie count.  I did add ¼ t dried basil to the cream sauce and it seemed to have bit more flavor.  Rave reviews all around.

Absolutely delicious.  I did add some shredded mozzarella cheese to the white sauce to give it just a little more cheese (personal preference).  This was amazing.  I have never made manicotti before and it turned out beautifully...actually quite proud of myself.  I did use a plastic bag as other reviewers stated to help "stuff" the noodles easier...and it worked really well.  Thanks for the post.

I made this for a casual dinner party and served it with herbed foccacia and a green salad. I received many compliments on the entire meal.  I also filled the shells the day before and made the white sauce on the morning of the party.  The best part of all--no pots to clean up while guests were here!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I've never precooked the shells.  They fill much easier uncooked, and turn out great.

For all the prep this dish is worth it!  I was careful not to "overcook" my manicotti shells so they wouldn't tear while I filled them.  However, I may have been too careful so that they weren't pliable enough.  The whole box of cooked shells only used maybe ½ the filling mixture.  Additionally, I would certainly use "LOW SODIUM" chicken bullion next time as I think the white sauce was too salty.  My family ate second helpings w/out complaint though.  This is RICH & FILLING.  (My only substitution was cottage cheese for the ricotta - just a family preference.)

Wow and I mean wow. This got rave reviews!!! I made it for Valentines day dinner, and it was soooo worth the work!!

I premade it the night before and used a sugarfree sauce as authentic italian dishes do not use sugar in they're tomatoe sauce. (I lived in Naples Italy for 3 years). It worked beautifully with the white sauce that I hesitated to add because it tasted like a chicken in a bisket cracker. Fear not if you taste it!! 

Works great as a make ahead, I also used half ground chuck and half italian sausage as others suggested and it was fantastic. I was requested to make it for my inlaws this coming weekend.!

Absolutley DELICIOUS! Even my picky father in law loved it! I actually made stuffed shells with this stuffing instead of manicotti and it's pretty much the same thing... I took the advice of others and used sausage as well... I chopped up 4 chicken tomatoe basil sausages and added it to ground turkey instead of the beef. I also used fat free half/half and low fat ricotta just to make it a little healthier. I added an additional garlic and extra parsley as well as basil. Gave it a great aroma and delicious flavor... there was no need for additional seasoning other than a bit of salt to the meat mixture. I also added low fat shredded mozzarella on top of the parmesan during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Prep time was a little longer than I wanted but the finished product made it well worth it!! 5 stars for sure!! Thanks so much for the recipe! :o)

I made this dish following the recipe.  The only change I made was to make my own manicotti crepes.  Many who rated this a 5-star recipe have made changes to the recipe itself. It was good, but I probably wouldn't make it again, as I think I would rather have plain 3-cheese manicotti served with Italian sausage or meatballs in sauce as a side dish.

i always wow the fam with the red sauce from Bobby Flays Eggplant Parm and the 'Manacotti Shells' recipe from this site.  The White Sauce will work out better if you cook the flour taste out in the butter for at least 2 mins then pour the 'warmed' 1/2 n 1/2 in slowly, while whisking until you have just 1/2 a cup left then pour the rest in.  Now continue to whisk over med high and bring to boil.  i boil for about 3-4 mins.  it will thicken when cooled but will look like a milk shake when hot.  Add parsley.

Yummers! This was fantastic. I love the white and red sauce together like this.The only changes I made was to add one 1/4 lb Italian sausage to meat and 1/4 cup parmesan and a splash of white wine to the white sauce. Loved the added flavor. This made so much I have to share it with friends!

Excellent.  I used Primio Sweet Italian sausage (removed from the casings) instead of the ground beef.  Once it was brown, I ground it in my food processor so the texture was more fine for the filling rather than "chunky".  I also added 1 egg to the ricotta mixture - which proved to be a good choice.  It really helped to bind the filling together.  I used my own homemade marinara sauce, and made the bechamel sauce from the recipe (which was excellent).  I had enough filling to fill an 8 oz. package of manicotti (14 pieces), and had some filling left over, which I put in the freezer to use for shells in the future. Everyone really enjoyed it.  A bit time consuming - but well worth the effort, which is what Sunday family dinners is all about!

I tasted all components of this dish as I went along since there were some fairly mixed reviews by other members. Before I had even read the reviews, I knew that I would be subbing half of the beef for Italian sausage meat. I used Johnsonville mild italian sausage meat from my local grocery store. To my meat filling I added salt, pepper and a pinch or red pepper flakes. After reading a few reviews, I decided to play it safe with the white sauce and instead of adding all of the chicken stock right away, I added 1/4. Just a note, when making a roux it is equal parts fat and dry. Since I had taken away 3/4 of the chicken stock, I replaced that amount with flour so that my sauce would thicken properly. After tasting, I added almost all of the chicken stock back since you needed the salt and flavour to cut through the heavy cream flavour. For my red sauce, I used Best Marinara Sauce Yet from AR, made with Italian Stewed Tomates from AR which has always been a favourite of mine. There is no need to add additional basil to this sauce. To stuff the noodles, I used Jen G.'s technique of slicing the backside, spooning in the filling, rolling them back up and placing them slit side down in the pan. My 9x13 pan could only fit 8. I yielded about 20 from this recipe. I alternated red and white sauces in ribbons across the manicotti and baked as directed. When baking some of the leftovers a few days later, I used mozzarella instead of parmesan and pereferred the mozza. (WHEW!) :)

I'm sorry...I didn't like this. It was way too bland. If you do try it, I would use at least half (if not all) italian sausage instead of hamburger. I followed the recipe as it was writen & the hamburger didn't do much for the recipe. I would also add alot of spices. Would not try it again.

I loved this recipe.  The bechamel type sauce made a welcome change and with the red sauce carefully spooned over the white,  it was a very pretty dish.  I did add a cup of shredded mozzerella cheese to the meat/ricotta mixture and two tablespoons tomato paste.  I boiled my shells for just five minutes and used a plastic storage bag (1qt) snipped the corner and squeezed the meat mixture into the shells.  When I was through filling the shells and they were lined up in my baking dish I also added  cup of water to the bottom.  Added the rest of my sauces, sealed wih foil and baked one hour.  
I fix Manicotti often so it was an easy dish besides I'm an empty nester with no children around asking "is it dinner yet"?  :-)

One word - delish!  My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  My only changes were to stuff the   manicotti without cooking first.  This saved a lot of prep time and dishes.  I used a zip lock bag cut at the tip to stuff the manicotti.  I also used more pasta sauce (appx 1 and 1/2 jars)  I did not use salt and only used one Tablespoon of chicken bouillion.  To the white sauce I added some Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese for taste.  Cooked for 60 mins. covered, uncovered and added Parmesan cheese and cooked for another 10 mins.  Manicotti was done perfectly.  Will be making this dish again in the near future.  YUM....

This was great! I used jumbo shells instead of manicotti because they are easier to stuff.  I used a 9x13 inch pan, but still only used 1/2 of the meat filling and 1/2 of the shells.  I froze the rest for later.  I recommend doubling the sauce.

Made as is, except used half Italian sausage/half ground beef, and 2% milk instead of half-and-half. I used Classico brand Sweet Basil jar spaghetti sauce. Buono! The textures were so good: al dente pasta, firm manicotti filling, moist, non-runny sauce. For presentation, I ladled the white sauce to cover the entire length of each shell, letting it run down the sides. I then spooned the red sauce just on top along the length of each shell, so that the white sauce could be seen. After uncovering, I sprinkled Parmesan on top of the red sauce. (See the picture for how pretty it looked.) Thanks for sharing!

This was VERY good. Not too often my husband asks for anything special for supper (usually because he can't think of anything) but he has asked for this a few times already.  The only thing I changed was to elimate the spinach and substituted the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese.  The white sauce is what really brings out the flavor, but instead of the 2TBSP of chicken boullion granules I only used a bit less than 1 TBSP.  I'm not much for salt, and it didn't taste salty at all. It also freezes so well.  I made double the amount of manicottie and froze them (without any sauce on them) After they were frozen I divided them and vacuum sealed them in individual portions.  Thaw before baking and just arrange them with the sauce the way you would right to begin with.  It is so easy to bring out what you need.  Serve it with a salad and garlic toast and it is a fast and tasty meal.

I usually make recipes exactly as written the first time- several reviews here recommend three changes that made this dish spectacular   1) cutting the chicken granules to ~ 1.5 - 2 teaspoons  2) not cooking the manicotti noodles- filling them dry and increasing cooking time to 70 minutes  3) using fresh spinach (wilting it with a bit of water in a frying pan then draining the liquid)   These changes made assembly much easier and really cut down on the salt. This dish was wonderful and the two sauces give an excellent balance of flavour. I used the "Best Marina Sauce Yet" from this site and will certainly make this again. Best of all, my guests were all begging for the recipe.  Because of the changes, I am giving it four stars (thanks for the recommendations, everyone!). I can't wait to dig into leftovers tonight!

This was very good.  I had filling left over, so I froze it and used it later to stuff shells.  Topped those shells with some refrigerated alfredo sauce and tomato sauce, and had a fast easy dinner the next week.  I will definitely make this again!

This was so-oo good, but only 4 stars due to how time consuming it is to make. I couldn't get chopped spinach, so I took partially defrosted cut spinach and chopped it finely in the food processor. Didn't bother cooking it. I also chopped the meat finely as I browned it. The shopping list I printed called for 2 15oz. containers of ricotta. Didn't notice that the recipe called for 2 CUPS! Glad I added two containers, as it turned out perfect with, two eggs. I used a nozzle attachment on my cookie  press to fill the shells.(That's why I chopped everything so finely) WAY easy! Next time I will add less chicken bouillon, as I thought the white sauce tasted too salty and a lot like chicken gravy, although not real noticeable combined with the spaghetti sauce, which I will use more of next time. I will make this again, despite the long prep time.

Made a healthier version using 90% lean ground sirlion with 3 TBS Italian Seasoing, low fat ricotta cheese, fat free half and half, light butter and used low fat mozzerela cheese at the end instead of Parmesan.  Tasted excellent!  For those of you on Weight Watchers it came out to 12 points per serving after the reductions (19 points per original recipe).

Great dish. Fairly simple. I made a few mods to tune for personal taste and the preferences of my family. It was a hit. Everyone loved the creamy texture and the melding of the flavors. Thank you for sharing.

This tasted great! The worst part was stuffing the Manicotti, which became easier after I got the hang of it. The next time I make this, I am going to make the Manicotti Shell from scratch (recipe from here) and roll them instead. The White Sauce was awesome, I made it according to the recipe. Thanks!

I CANNOT express in words how AMAZING this recipe is. My entire family went completely insane when they saw and ate this. I made it for father's day with the Garlic Bubble Ring and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and it was truly the best meal I have ever made, and i have made a LOT of meals. I made slight changes. 1) I did not buy enough ricotta cheese on accident. I only had about 1 1/3 cups, but it still turned out perfect. 2) I used all spicy italian sausage because my family does not like ground beef. 3) I put in a handful of parmesan cheese into the white sauce mix. some people say that the white sauce is unnecessary, but I think it makes the dish ten times better. 4) I used dried ground basil instead of fresh. I also lessened the amount of salt a bit. What is fun is to do an all italian meal. I even did italian sodas and made the Layer Cake Tiramisu for dessert. I used allrecipes.com for all of it. The manicotti was to die for and I am SO glad I made it!

This recipe was a great success!  My family is Italian and I doubled this for my mother's 50th birthday party.  I made a 2 pound Italian roast and finely chopped it to a course consistancy instead of using ground beef.  I also made alfredo sauce instead of the "white" sauce recommended.  It received rave reviews!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Also, if you are not a garlic fan, I'd recommend halving the amount called for. It was strong, but we love it that way!  Thanks!

great recipe! I also, like most people, substituted sausage for the beef...other than that, I followed the recipe exact. I stuffed the shells uncooked, using a ziploc bag w/ the tip cut off. this easily made two 9x13 pans of manicotti, so I made the white sauce twice. not doubled the sauce, but actually made it two times in a row, to pour into each seperate pan. (the other pan I put in my freezer).. I bought fresh spinach, added it by sight (I added it to the frying pan w/ the meat..) didn't even cut up half of a 'bundle', and it seemed adequate. will make again!

Loved this. I made Manicotti for the first time and it was really fun! Like others, I used 1/2 ground hamburger and 1/2 sausage and was happy with that. Next time, I will probably cut the spinach just a bit and add just a touch of mozzarella cheese to make it a bit more stringy and "ooey gooey". Definitely a keeper recipe.

A little salty than our taste, but nothing we can't adjust. Messy to make (we need to perfect our ziploc bag skills), but oh my! The white sauce is definitely my favorite, and really made the flavor of the dish. Very satisfying.

Excellent recipe. My dinner guests loved it. I used turkey sausage in the recipe rather than beef. Not one serving of manicotti was left.

Thanks for the great recipe - the extra work was worth it.

I thought it was terrible.  It took me an hour to prepare it and just wasn't good.  Most of the time I try to make it again, but due to the cost of the ingredients and the time it took to make this one is not getting a second chance.

I used ground beef - and could have done without it.  Next time i'll just add it to the sauce, it made the filling bland rather more flavorful.  If i liked italian sausage, i'd use that instead because of the spices.  Deffinatly add more spices- loads of basil and garlic are a must. :)  I also made alfredo rather than "white sauce" because.... how boring?  Good platform recipe- just needs a little tweaking to personal preforance.  I used a baggie to fill the shells like someone suggested- but only for HALF a shell.  I stuffed the rest by hand, much easier and none broke.  I also used fresh spinach (frozen? ew.)

Everyone loved this recipe!!!  I would recommend at "least" doubling the white sauce if you like lots of sauce with the manicotti.  I also used 3/4ths italian sausage and 1/4 hambuger for the filling, used a little more red sauce than called for, and put some italian seasonings in with the white sauce.  It does take some time, but if you love cooking, you'll enjoy making this.

this was an incredibly involved dish -- but worth it! the white sauce is very tasty. the most difficult part was stuffing the shells carefully without tearing them. this would be good with chicken or just vegetarian with the spinach. i'd suggest doing everything the night before, therefore being able to just pop it in the oven the next night for a delicious dinner.

Fantastic recipe, I used Classico 4 cheese sauce, milder and lets the rest of the other flavours of the stuffing come through. Can be made meatless also, or add some diced peppers, like cubanells or banana peppers, something along this line. Whole small  tomatos can be used also instead of a pasta sauce, along with the white sauce. Have tried all of these, and makes for something different each time. I have even used pulled bbq pork and it was amazing, and store bought bbq chicken and shredded it, all of these add such flavor and saves time having to cook these indivdually. Hope that I have given you some great ideas and saved you time in the kitchen.

This recipe would have been 5 stars had it called for sausage instead of hamburger. I saw the reviews and wished I had not ignored them - sausage would have been perfect. I did not use 2 TBS of the chicken bullion - only used one TBS and was glad I did or it would have been extremely salty. Great recipe though. The white sauce added a lot of flavor to the dish.

This was amazing! I mean, truly amazing! Yes I tweaked. I need the extra protein so I used extra meat & cheese, adding in some mozz too, & swapped the ricotta out for cottage cheese as a personal preference. The whole family loved it & that's always a bonus in my house! Thank you!!

This was good, but very labor-intensive. I normally don't spend this much time making dinner, and I'm not sure the result of my efforts warrant making this again. It was good, but not great.

1) Needed more flavor.  I tripled the garlic and added Marjoram, Nutmeg, Thyme, Basil, Parsley, and Oregano to the ricotta mixture.  I like dishes heavy with different spices/herbs.
2) Slit the manicotti shells as suggested and no one noticed.
3) "Layering" the sauce was useless.  The bechemel was delicious but I'm just going to mix the two sauces from the start.  
4) Served with salad and garlic bread.
5) Well received and no leftovers :)

Godd recipe, You can speed things up by using thawed, frozen lasagna sheets,  cut in half and rolled in place of the manicotti tubes.

This dish is spectacular!  My daughter says it is the best meal I've ever made. I did not use ground beef but used chicken sausage instead.   I also used Prego Spaghetti Sauce with Italian Sausage. The other adjustment was to use 1.5 tablespoons of bouillon and added mozzarella cheese at the end with the Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!!  Well worth the time and effort.

This was yummy a little bland adding seasoning to fit your taste made this much better. I use cream cheese about 1 1/2 and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the ricotta. And mushrooms instead of spinich, I also used spicy marinara and halfed the chicken bouillion like others suggested. Will make this alot in the future.

I was also surprised by the rave reviews.  I used all Italian sausage for the meat 1/2 hot 1/2 regular, and I bought 2 different kinds of Bertolli red sauces (red burgandy wine, and three cheese and spinach) and it was SO blah!  The recipe looked great, sounded great, but the taste was missing something very vital to have made this dish pop. I bought all fresh herbs and didn't skimp on cheap ingredients and it still came out very bland.  I agree with another reviewer who said the cream sauce should have been more flavorful as well.  I did par boil the noodles for 1/2 the time as the box says, and immediately took them out and immersed them in cold water, and I stuffed the shells perfectly with an icing piping bag with no nozzle attachment on the end and that worked perfectly! I had also made a spinach artichoke dip the same night, and it was so much more flavorful than this recipe that I wish I would have stuffed something similar to the dip in these shells.  If you're debating on whether to make this cream sauce or to buy the white ragu sauce in the store, either find another cream sauce recipe, or buy the jar.  I would not recommend making this one.  Overall, this recipe was a great idea and concept, but not tasty enough without some real doctoring of the given ingredients.

I liked this recipe, but I think I will love it after I tinker with it. I plan on omitting the chicken bouillon, and adding some of the hungarian peppers that I canned a few weeks ago. Thank you for the great recipe. Love the addition of the bechamel!

The outcome of this dish is well worth the effort.  It's not hard, but just a lot of steps.  I followed one reviewer's tip about slicing the noodle in half to fill and then placing seam-side down. A huge time saver and not so messy.  Just an excellent homemade meal.

I followed the advice of others and used sweet italian sausage instead of hamburger.  I added fresh basil to the sausage and cheese mixture and only used about 1/2 of the spinach.  I used a bag to pipe the mixture into the noodles, I put all of the mixture into a gallon size bag.  I should have used 2 smaller bags, it would have been easier to control.  My DH said this tastes like it was from a restaurant.  I can't believe how good this turned out.  It took some time but was worth it.  I will make this again.

Way beyond my expectations!

I made this tonight without the meat as we have vegetarians and meat-eaters in the house. I did not want to add the eggs but was unsure how it would turn out without them. I did not add salt and I'm glad I didn't because the salt level was perfect as is.

I added some mozzerella, fresh ground pepper, fresh basil, and dried oregano to spinach/cheese mixture. I also did not cook the spinach first and I added a little nutmeg to the white sauce.

I will invest in a pastry bag for next time as I used a freezer bag with one corner cut off, but it was really messy and difficult. I think the hole was too big.

My box of manicotti came with 14 shells...I'm not sure how other people fit all 14 into the 9x13 dish. I only got in 8 but that was perfect to feed 3 of us. Everyone had 2 plates!

Super delish!
Will make again, may try with the meat although I don't believe its necessary.

This is the best recipe I have tried from this site. My biggest critic (my 2 yr old) had seconds even my 11 month old daughter gobbled it up. I used half beef and half italian sausage like others suggested and I substituted the half and half for heavy whipping cream its all I had on hand and it turned out just wonderful. I also forgot to add in the garlic and it was still amazing. Wonderful wonderful recipe. Oh yeah it is time consuming but really is well worth it. Cant wait to make this for hubby when he returns from Iraq

We loved this dish.  I did some of the prep work the night before to cut down on time. I cooked the meats the night before using beef and spicy Italian sausage with the onion and garlic, then reheated and added the rest of ing. the following evening. I also used a combination of ricotta and small curd cottage cheese.  Thanks so much for the post.

Awesome recipe. I was cooking for a vegetarian who doesn't eat parm cheese either, so I subbed chopped mushrooms for the beef, and put in extra spinach (I used part frozen and part fresh spinach). It turned out really well, but next time I'm going to try adding sausage (instead of ground beef)! Highly recommend.

My Italian husband was watching with a skeptical eye, telling me "That is NOT the way Mom makes Manicotti". He took a bite, took another, and said "Wow! This is even better than Mom's Manicotti!" Excellent recipe. I followed it to the T.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was a nice, unique presentation for guests.  I did add some chunky portabello mushrooms to the tomato sauce for added flavor as well as a little cheese to the white sauce for texture and flavor.

I did not precook my noodles.  They are much easier to stuff uncooked.  I just used more spaghetti sauce and cooked them until tender.  

This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  This dish is better than most restaurant pastas, and once you make this it will become the most requested dish in your kitchen.

This has become my signature dish for dinner parties with friends, and our ritual Christmas Eve dish for family.  My DH cannot get enough.  I always add more garlic and cheese than the recipe calls for ~ fresh spices from the garden are the added touch.  

I would recommend layering in the red sauce first and the white last.  Also, I added some provolone cheese and mushrooms to the meat/spinach mixture.  Superb!! Probably one of the best pasta recipes I have ever tried.

Fantastic!!  I reduced the olive oil to 1 Tbl., and used reduced fat ricotta cheese to cut down on the fat; used 1 tsp. salt (1 Tbl. sounded like a ton!), and omitted the white sauce (I'm not a white sauce fan, unless it's an alfredo sauce).  I ended up with 2 pans (13x9x2 size), so I used 2 - 26 oz. jars of sauce.  Perfect!  I added grated mozzarella along with the parmesan.  I would make the same modifications next time.  Thanks for this restaurant quality recipe!

Excellent pasta dish!!  I made it the night before and baked it for dinner the next day, and it was still perfection!!
When you cover the half cooked pasta in cold water, don't leave it in for too long, otherwise the pasta will start to tear when you fill it.

Very good... and very rich!  This ended up being enough for two 9x13 pans of Manicotti... so I doubled the amounts of the sauces, and froze a pan!  I actually made this for my birthday yesterday... it was a big hit with the family!

Thanks Mark!

This recipe was delicious! It is a little labor intensive, but worth it. It makes way more than 1 9x13 pan. I made 1 9x13 and 1 9x9 pans. I still had a little filling left. Also, go easy on  the chicken bouillon in the white sauce, the sauce came out a little salty. Next time I will cut down a little.

I made this recipe last night almost exactly as written, incorporating the recommendations of others to substitute the ground beef with spicy Italian sausage. Unfortunately I forgot the parmesan cheese in the last step but this certainly didn't take away from the flavor.  This was absolutely delicious! Making roué for the first time wasn't even that hard. The white sauce certainly makes this recipe unique and was worth the effort. Yummy! My boyfriend even asked to take some of the leftovers home.

Phenomenal recipe!!!  I made a few small changes based on my personal preferences.  I didn't want to use Italian sausage so I found a pack of ground beef that also came with a helping of pork for a meatloaf.  I don't know about everyone else's grocery store but I shop at Publix and they have this readily available.  I seasoned the meat (Tony's Chachere's, Mrs Dash onion blend, McCormick Grillmates roasted garlic and herb, a little salt and pepper) before browning it and that eliminated any possible blandness.  I added about a cup, maybe a cup and a half, of a 6 cheese Italian blend to the meat/spinach/ricotta mixture because I had some in the fridge that needed to be used.  I used a little more spaghetti sauce because 1/4 cup didn't cover the bottom of my pan.  Also used heavy whipping cream for the white sauce instead of half and half.  I just like heavy cream better.  Topped it all off with parmesan and romano.  markblau did a great job with this one!

The spaghetti sauce you use is "key" in this recipe. It will make or break it. Use fresh homemade sauce or an exceptionally good quality prepacked sauce. It was very good, but did not blow my socks off. Will definitely make again though.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exact, with one exception: I did not cook the manicotti before stuffing them.  It came out perfect!

The ratios here are really off. Will not be making this again. Too much garlic, too much spinach. (I used half garlic based on reviews and it was reasonable). I used the amount of spinach called for and regretted it. I only used half the spinach/meat mixture to mix with ricotta (seemed like way too much per amount ricotta, and even after I only put in half!). I saved the other portion to freeze (to add to ricotta for filling another batch), but after that will not be making this recipe again. It does taste like catered food, I will give it that. I will be looking for a better manicotti recipe. I do agree that fresh basil is a must in manicotti and I only make it when I have basil in the fridge.

I made this tonight and it went over very well with my family.  I subbed turkey italian sausage for the ground beef and since I had an open jar of alfredo sauce in the fridge, I used that instead of making the white sauce.  I thought it was okay but the guys really liked it.

Made this last night and it was delicious!  The only changes I made was I added a bit more sauce, a bit more cheese and I did not cook spinach like recipe stated.  I just added the thawed, squeezed spinach to meat while it was cooling.  My kids loved it and didnt even notice the mozzarella cheese that most manicotti recipes call for was missing.

This is only my second review of a recipe on allrecipes (the other was for a peach cobbler).  I have made this recipe twice now, with only minor tweaking to the ingredients and "production" method.  The first time I used store bought manicotti shells and it was very, very good, 5 stars.  The second time I made this (for a dinner party) I used the manicotti shells recipe found on this site and it was beyond very, very good.  If there was a way to give it 10 stars, I would.  (When I asked my 17-year-old pastaholic son how he liked it, he asked me to repeat my question because he "couldn't hear me over the angels singing" and begged me not to send our company home with any (I made two very large pans, most of which disappeared at dinner).  It is an amaaazzzing recipe, made even better with the homemade manicotti shells.  Yes, a lot of work (made it the day before and put in fridge to bake night of party), but you will not be disappointed.

I made this over the holidays while in Italy. I made my own manicotti shells as well. I loved the two sauces but I varied the sauces a little by adding some other seasonings to them. I also let the red sauce cook all day. I prefer to make my own red sauce, as a Sicilian/Italian I just can't bring myself to use store bought red sauce :) I also cut up some spicy Italian sausage and added it to the cheese mixture for one. I made two types, one with sausage and one without. The one with sausage was gone first!

SOOOO delicious! I added some mozzarella cheese in with the meat mixture and just added the frozen spinach into the meat after taking it off the heat. It thawed by the time the meat was cooled enough to add the ricottta cheese. Oh and I used about cup of skim milk instead of the half and half and it turned out just as good while sparing a few calories for this rich meal!

This was outstanding - both my husband and I loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and while it was time consuming, it was a great meal to prepare while having some wine and conversation.  Just as a personal preference, the next time I make this, I'll probably decrease the amount of red sauce on top - but that is only because the white sauce is so good!

Very tasty. I had a hard time stuffing the manicotti,  even using a little baggie with a corner snapped off. I may try this again but next time I will slice open the pasta, stuff it and place cut side down. A few of my manicotti did this anyway and they were fine.

Great recipe. I liked the combination of the white and red sauces.  I didn't change anything in the recipe except for forgetting the salt but I added some at the end and it was still good.

Brilliant! I made for a large (and picky) family gathering and it was a hit. I made all but the white sauce the night before and sealed with plastic wrap in the fridge. I followed suggestions of reveiwers to use half ground beef, half italian sausage, as well as cutting the boullion in the white sauce ( to 1/3) to rave reviews. The preperation the night before did not hurt the shells at all. One tip; make sure the manicotti are completely covered in sauce, peekabo corners make for tough corners.

I loved the creaminess of the sauce - the filling was good too...I do think it would be better with Italian Sausage in the filling.  I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful, but not absolutely perfect :)

This was quite tasty, although I have made manicotti recipes that were far less work. I omitted the spinach -- my family isn't a fan, and I prefer fresh spinach in salads -- took the advice of others and used 1/2 lb.  beef and 1/2 lb. sausage, and frankly, I could have used basil and parsley from my spice rack and probably not missed it. I made the white sauce as listed here, but when I tasted it, it was WAY too salty. I tossed that batch of white sauce and started over with about 60% less chicken boullion granules, and it was far better. I think I'll use the white sauce again on other receipes. My family pronounced the finished result delicious.

Tonight's dinner, oh my, so good. I agree, lots of work. I topped mine with Kraft 4 cheese blend, and broiled. Let sit for 10 minutes to set up. Can't wait to serve at a dinner with friends, individual dishes, as shown in this picture~

This manicotti recipe is fantastic!  I made it for the first time today for company - and everyone loved it.  I followed others' suggestions to use mild Italian sausage instead of beef, and I used just one chicken bouillon cube.  I didn't have any half and half on hand, so I used 2% milk instead.  The white sauce turned out perfect, so I will definitely use milk in the future to cut out unnecessary calories.  There is no need to cook the shells - I filled uncooked manicotti shells and then cooked the dish for 40 minutes at 375 F.  We'll definitely be making this again!

This was good, but I think I messed up the recipe by making it ahead of time & freezing. I froze with the sauces on top, which was probably not a good idea. The sauces didn't freeze well. I think I'll try it again to serve the same day as the filling was very good.

Well, believe it or not we thought this was a bit bland.  I will make again using less Ricotta replacing with a three-cheese mix from my deli, (Parmesan, Asiago, Romano); will add Romano to taste to the white sauce---I know, I know, more fat content but if I am going to spend this much time on a meal it must be out of this world and do believe the additional cheese will help.  I cut a corner off of a Ziploc bag and inserted a pastry piper through the hole to pipe the cheese/spinach/meat mixture into the shells but next time think I will make this like lasagna ‘roll-ups’ instead of the more time consuming shell stuffing as I had to make sure any meat pieces were not too large for my largest piping tip.  This is a beautiful presentation but I do believe the roll-ups will present just as beautiful.

I didn't think this recipe was that great. I don't think that its worth all of the time and effort. I did use sausage instead of ground beef. It tasted more like lasagna to me.

Fantastic dish! I am almost frightened that we will make this again, as it was a full 2 hours (cleaning the kitchen afterwards included) to get everything done, but it was worth it! The white sauce was a big hit! I couldn't find manicotti, so I used oven ready canelloni. I also used fresh spinach, instead of frozen. Thanks for sharing!

Very, very tasty.  I made a vegetarian version using a 12 oz. bag of vegan meatballs  and vegetable broth.  I used my homemade red pepper marinara and added some fennel to the filling.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Next time I'll make it using some homemade tempeh sausage crumbles.  It is sure to impress.

Good recipe. I do agree with other reviewers that say the white sauce is unnecessary. I wasn't able to taste it. I did find this a bit bland although I did add some extra spices. I realize everyone has different taste - guess I'm just more of a spicy 
girl :)

My husband and I really liked this recipe, and he gives it 5 stars, but I give it a 4, simply because I didn't think that the white sauce added anything to the dish. It wasn't that the sauce was bad, it was very good in fact, but I personally feel that the dish would've been just as good without it. That being said, I will probably make it as is again, because my husband really did like the white sauce in it!

I provide personal chef services, and this recipe is the most requested one - by far!  I was skeptical about the white sauce, but it really does make the dish.  I use jumbo shells instead of manicotti noodles.

This dish is time consuming, however it does freeze beautifully.  I make 4 - 6 batches of it at one time and freeze.  A great meal to pull out of the freezer and throw into the oven.

This has got to be the best manicotti recipe I've tried! Other than there being a lot of steps to this recipe, it isn't that difficult to make. I added shredded mozzarella cheese on top for the last 10 minutes of baking, but otherwise did the recipe as stated and it is wonderful!Thanks for posting this one!

This was the first time I have ever made manicotti, and I will never use another recipe...I didn't change a thing and I can't wait to make this for family to show off my skills! DEVINE!......................UPDATE.........
I used this filling with stuffed shells (at my 9 yr olds request) and instead of ground beef i used italian sausage, the sausage gave it a great flavor. This has become a family favorite!

This is so very good! I'm thinking of making this for a rehearsal dinner. I could do some vegitarian and some with meat. The white sauce is great and I am so glad I can finally make a white alfredo-type sauce for pasta! 

The changes I made are that I also used a small curd cottage cheese (small container), a small block of fresh grated parmasson cheese, italian sausage instead of ground beef, and added a package of motzarella to the cheese mix. I know it is a lot of changes, but we all make do with what we have. Since I added so much, I used a second box of pasta and stuffed them for the freezer! I will make additional sause when we have those. And WE WILL because this was incredible resteraunt quality food.

Oh! This came out so good with italian sausage! I think it's a must with italian sausage, don't make this with ground beef. Even with italian sausage, I still added plenty seasoning, mozzarella cheese. Stuffing the manicotti was not as hard as I thought, no problem there! Good entertaining food especially for those guests that are not very experimental. It looks impressive, tast good and not too much work. A note, leftover is not so good.

I made this recipe for the first time. I have to say my family loved it. My husband never eats anything with ricotta cheese in it, but with the meat in it, he never knew. I made some changes. I used Bob Evans italian sausage, I like that brand because it's not greasy. I also added pesto in the cream sauce. I will definitly make this again.

Excellent. I used 1/2 ground beef 1/4 sweet and 1/4 hot italian sausage which I thought improved the flavour of the meat filling. The white sauce is a must to really appreciate this recipe. It rounds out the tomatoe sauce beautifully. Use homemade or a good quality spagetti sauce. I am a lasagna fan but this ranks right up there. Thanks for a great meal.

Ok people.....Being on a low carb diet stinks!  Yet I was browsing through delicious manicotti recipes and stumbled upon this one that had meat in it with the cream sauce as well.  I noticed all the ingredients work well with my diet.  I decided to make this, and not use the pasta (or the flour)...and I took the mixture and put it in a 9X9 caserole dish along with the spaghetti sauce and baked it according to the recipe and VOILA!  A low carb side dish to go with a salad!  It was delicious and still had all the protien I need for this diet!  DELICIOUS and such a great alternative to just chicken every day.  Thanks!

Loved this!! It is time consuming, so not something you could make at the last minute. BUT it's definitely worth the work. Unlike the user below, I had no trouble piping the noodles. The only thing is you need to make sure the bag you are using to pipe the filing has a wide enough opening to let the meat pass through...otherwise you might have problems! I did not make the white sauce, as I was feeding my kiddo's and thought they'd like it better without it. It was great with just the red sauce.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was good although a little bland. I even added some mozzorella cheese to the filling to add some flavor and that hardly helped. It's a good base but use more seasoning, salt&pepper, etc.....

We LOVED this manicotti- all 8 of us wanted more! Some hints: we added merlot to spaghetti sauce and let simmer. Used fresh ground spices (basil, oregano, marjoram, italian parsley). Used a mix of ground beef and sicillian sausage, and a mix of ricotta and cottage cheese. You will LOVE this dish!!!

Just had these for lunch and it was absolutely delicious!  I used turkey and sausage and seasoned the meat with ground black pepper, oregano and basil, other than that, I followed the recipe to the t.  It did however take a lot of preparation and stuffing the shells were kind of tricky.  I tried using a ziploc bag, but I kept on cracking the shells even more; so I resorted to doing it by hand and it was a lot easier for me and no more cracking the shells. I love how these don't make you feel bloated like most pasta recipes. Will be making again, thanks for sharing Mark!

My family enjoyed this - I used reduced fat sausage for the filling and fat free evaporated milk instead of the half-and-half in the white sauce to make it a little more healthy.  It turned out great.  I think next time I will add some mozzarella for added flavor.  I used all the garlic and thought it was perfect!

My husband went crazy over this recipe!
It's one of the very best I have ever
tasted too. It takes a lot of time to make,
so I suggest you make it the day before
then actually bake it the day it's served.

I thought this recipe was okay.  It wasn't the tastiest nor the easiest manicotti I've ever made, but I thought it was worth making.  The white sauce is good, but I'd recommend using less of the bouillon than is called for, as mine turned out to be very salty.  Overall, a good (but not great) recipe.

This.is.beautiful. It is so yummy, you’ll think you’ve gone to Italian heaven! I do add a Italian sausage when browning the ground beef. At this time I also add a tablespoon of oregano, 1/2 a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and a sprinkle of garlic salt. I like my dishes cheesy so I add a cup of mozzarella and grated Parmesan to the mixture too. Piping it in the shells makes it easier. I ended up with two pans of manicotti- one to eat and one to share! Thank you for the besciamella recipe- this wonderful white sauce is so delicious! Italians add a sprinkle of nutmeg to it right before topping it on the shells. I did too, and yeah, it’s good!

My husband asks for this to be cooked for special occasions.  It is definitely restaurant quality.  Actually, we went to olive garden and my husband thought this recipe tasted better.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.

Fantastic! I used a higher quality marinara sauce and mixed a bit of cottage cheese and parmesan cheese into the cheese mix. When I make this again, iI will not add as much bouillon as recipe calls, it was a bit salty. Great recipe!!!

LOVED this recipe!!!! It was absolutely delicious and everyone who ate it was crazy over it. I took the advice of the reviewers and used 4 mild Italian sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef. I used Classico garlic and onion for sauce and used much more basil and parsley. The white sauce was terrific. I was afraid to try it but it really makes the dish. I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes for this. I also added a bit of Parmesan cheese to the mixture as another reviewer did. The shells were not hard to stuff at all with the zip lock method. I will definitely be making this regularly.

I made it for dinner last night & guests and husband loved it. Followed the suggestion of previous reviewers and substituted ground beef for mild Italian sausage. I also made everything the night before and placed in the fridge and just baked the next night. Very very good

I made this as is, but added a little Italian seasoning.   It was so so good.    My mom has made manicotti as " her dish" on special occasions; this blows hers out of the water!!   I can't wait to make this again!!

This recipe is AWESOME !   It takes a bit of time but it will impress every single time.   We have substituted various meats ,it always turns out good. I normally make one pan of beef and one of sausage.  I changed the sauces up a bit and make about 4 times the white sauce called for and drop the red sauce requirement by about 1/2 ( just enough to coat the bottom of the pan and a slight drizzle on top ,then lots of white sauce). I am not a big tomato sauce person and prefer the milder red sauce taste over an abundance of it.  The extra white sauce is also fantastic for a bread dip to compliment the meal.

This was a hit!  I read a lot of the reviews and decided to tweak it to our taste.  Used fresh Hot Italian sausage with a bit of hamburger in it.  Saved some of the meat mixture to put in the red sauce (my BF is a carnivore).  Used a little less garlic (we love garlic, however, this seemed a little excessive).  Put fresh grated parmigiano reggiano in the ricotta blend.  Made a homemade alfredo sauce in exchange of the white sauce in this recipe.  Then topped with fresh mozzarella.  It was a labor of love and we enjoyed every bite!

This is really yummy and definitely comfort food material. The white sauce is very tasty although next time, I might cut down on the bouillon and just add to taste. I used a bouillon "paste" instead of the powder as that is what I have on hand. Will make it again for sure!

Very tasty! Used sausage instead, the white sauce is key to overall flavor. Made them with and without spinach for picky eaters. I've also subbed on occasion ricotta cheese for the milk, very moist and a bit more rich in flavor but on its own and with original ingredients a definite 5 star.  Very filling but so yummy you almost cant stop yourself from seconds ;-)

This recipe is so good and yes the white sauce makes the dish. I also added my own Italian seasonings to the meat and dish to make it have more of a kick. Love it.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars... I followed the recipe as written and agreed with others that the meat mixture was a little bland and lacking some flavor. Next time I will add some different spices. The white sauce was great and the recipe was easy to follow. Give this one a try and add some spices to your meat mixture, you won't be disappointed.

Made this exactly like the recipie. As with most foods that call for filling something, we use a cake decorating bag. Works great and the shells don't break. Since it's only me and my wife, when we make dishes like this we send some of it over to our nieghbors who don't cook much anymore. They said if we make it again feel free to share!

This dish is time-consuming to prepare but so worth the trouble!  The only changes I made were to use sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef (I always prefer Italian sausage over ground beef anyway) and I omitted the chicken bouillon but I did season the white sauce a little so it wasn't bland.  Be careful while parboiling the shells because it's really easy to get distracted and let them cook for a wee bit too long.  Thankfully this recipe makes ALOT so I tossed aside the few shells that were a little too soft or split and still have more than enough to feed everyone.  I also put my filling in a ziploc bag but cut the hole a little too big, so filling the shells took a little bit longer than I wanted it to.  This dish is perfect for a weekend meal.

I did make a few tweaks to the recipe such using half ground beef/half Italian sausage and added a little parmesan cheese to the meat mixture, other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.  My family seemed to really enjoy it, especially my husband.

Definitely a special occasion meal, since it was A LOT of work.  I thought it had a bit too much parmesan, or I would have added another star.

Great recipe and easy to make.  Used half ground beef and half Italian sausage.  When cooked, used the processor to "purée" the meat, spinach, ricotta and egg together.  Loved the tip about using a freezer bag for piping the filling.  Oven ready cannelloni noodles eased the preparation.  For the white sauce, used milk instead of cream and no bouillon.  I like to add nutmeg to white sauce for a unique flavor.
Will make this again!

We just got back from touring Italy and after all the great food we ate I couldn't stand the thought of opening a box of spaghetti and a jar of sauce for dinner. This recipe is SO worth the effort. It really did rival the best of what we ate while traveling. I used italian sausage, added 1 tbsp of italian seasoning, halved the spinach, and made my own manicotti shells (recipe from this site). I ended up with two 9x13 pans. We ate one for dinner (no leftovers) and I planned to freeze one but everyone in the family requested that I use it for dinner the next night.

I have made this dish a few times and I absolutely love it. I prefer using pasta shells instead of the manicotti noodles. The next time I make it, I want to use spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

This was a nice change from the usual lasagna or spaghetti night at our home.  A little time consuming, (not to mention the dishes to wash after!) yet worth the extra effort.  I have no problems with this recipe as written (I know, I know here it comes.. ;) even though I made some minute changes like 1. Added some italian seasoning in with the meat with a little extra garlic salt.  2. Reduce olive oil to 1 T.  3. Added all of the fresh herbs to the white sauce.  4. Sprinkled maybe 1/2 C of fresh grated mozzarella cheese over the manicotti before adding any of the sauces.  5. Used a shredded parmesan & romano blend with another 1/2 C of mozzarella for the final 10 minutes.  Absolutely loved the finished product & will make this again.  May try adding some sliced olives &/or mushrooms to the meat mixture next time. I used the garden mix of ragu spaghetti sauce, it was perfect & gave me the idea to try some extra veggies.  Thanks for another great recipe!

This manicotti recipe is really worth trying!  My husband and I liked it a lot.  The only exception is I didn't make the white sauce though I'm sure it's good with it!  I added a few lightly sauteed mushrooms over the top of the meat sauce instead and it was good.  The spinach/meat sauce is light tasting and cheesy.  I always have trouble filling manicotti so I put the filling in a plastic bag and cut a small hole in the tip of the corner and piped the filling into the manicotti.  It seemed to be easier to fill that way.  Overall, the recipe is exceptional and I will be making this one again!

Delicious ! Everything turned out perfect. I added a handful of mozza cheese to the filling and also sprinkled some more on top at the last 5 min of cooking. The only changes I made was to cut down on the bouillon to 1 cube and it was still too salty so I made another batch of the white sauce without any bouillon and mixed them together, it turned out perfect. Next time I will only use half a cube. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

The filling has great flavor.  I cheated and made a package alfredo sauce, just to save time. I also added mozzarella to the top and broiled. I have 3 kids - 12, 10, 5.  They each ate two!

Substitution of Italian Sausage for ground beef works very well.  Also very helpful to put meat/cheese/egg mix in a bag, cut adequate hole size and pipet into shells.  Works very well and much more efficient than stuffing shells manually!

Made my own manicotti shells (from this site) and it's amazing every time.  A bit time consuming, but delicious and very impressive looking to serve for company.

Very good, however the ricotta-spinach-meat stuffing became very dry due to the half-cooked pasta leeching all moisture out during baking.  It may be worth it to fully cook the manicotti then deal with stuffing difficulties, or somehow make the stuffing more moist.

I don't typically amend recipes, however it will make life easier on you;
fill the shells "uncooked" using a zip lock type bag (cut corner of bag). Bake the uncooked shell in the sauce. I also used sausage instead of ground beef for more flavor!

I used this recipe to stuff jumbo shells and used italian ground turkey instead of ground beef. This adds amazing flavor to the mix. 

You have to be patient in making the white sause, as it takes awhile to boil and thicken, but the wait is worth it. 

This batch produced 2 9x13 pans full for me. I ended up using 2 jars of sauce, one for each pan. I was able to throw the other one in the freezer.

I just served this to company last night and one of my guests who is a pretty picky eater called it "phenomenal" so I thought I just had to rate it. The only complaint I had was that the Italian sausage I used was a little too heavy on the fennel for our tastes, but even with that it was still delicious. I will definitely get a pastry bag and tip for the next time so the filling process is a little easier, but I will be making this again. Yum!

We LOVED this!  I was forced to substitute some things that I didn't have:  most notably, I doubled the recipe and used 1 pound ground chicken, 1 pound mild italian sausage.  I didn't have enough chicken broth cubes and had to substitute a little vegetable broth concentrate... my ricotta cheese only came in a 3.5 cup can... you know... but the end result was wonderful and let me tell you, the leftovers were even better!

This is the first time I have ever made manicotti. It took a very long time to prepare, but it was worth every second! Absolutely delicious! I followed the suggestion to use Italian Sausage and it was spot on! I used a whole pound of mild ground italian sausage and a bit less garlic than the recipe called for because I don't like to be overpowered by garlic taste. Also omitted the chicken bouillion from the white sauce and everything was perfect! Really wowed my date! :)

This was really good - I made a few changes and next time I would make a few more.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and was slightly short on ricotta, so made up the difference with cottage cheese.  The filling itself was a little bland, and not near enough.  I stuffed less than a box and a half of shells (I could only find 8 oz. boxes) and didn't quite use what WOULD have made a 12 oz. box, and I did NOT use a lot of filling per shell.  Also the sauces were very tasty, but again, not quite enough and some of my pasta was dry.  Next time I will probably 1.5x the filling and the white sauce, and maybe add a little something extra to the filling to give it more flavor - parmesan or maybe a little crumbled sausage (although we're not big on sausage, so I'll probably go the cheese route).  All in all, this was very good, and I suspect that when my hubby finally gets home from work this will be "My type of food!" for him.  Will make again, and there are lots of ways to make this healthier!

This was delicious and definitely worth the effort.  I'd have given it five stars, but I think it lacked just a little "zip."  Then again, I like my food highly seasoned.  I may try to experiment with different/more spices the next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this to exact specifications except for two things...i didnt have half and half so i figured heavy whipping cream wouldnt hurt, I also forgot to add the chicken bouillon into the butter/four mixture so i added it into the whipping cream. My family didnt complain so I am taking that as a good sign. I think next time I will add mozzarella cheese to the meat mixture and on top of the sauce. Its a good thing if I plan to make it again! :)

This was a good base recipe, however, I did make several changes most notably substituting italian sausage (2 lbs)for ground beef, omiting the chicken bouillion altogether, fresh spinach in liue of frozen, increased onion and cloves of garlic, extra italian seasoning/basil/oregano; my sauce was made with butter, sauteed/minced garlic and onion, flour, salt and white pepper to taste, and 1/2 cup of fresh grated Asiago cheese.

I make this about 2x monthly- a real house fav! To make stuffing the shells easier, I use my longest, fattest cake deco tip and the bag.  Fill with the cheese and stuff shells that way- less tearing of the shells!

I found this recipe to be less labor intensive than I feared, but it definitely needs some tweaking.  Here are my recommendations:

I just used one egg, and mixed it in with the ricotta, that way you don't need to wait for the meat mixture to cool before adding it.  I also  question whether the spinach needs to be cooked before adding, but I did do that.

I would only use a 1/2 lb of meat, and garlic salt/pepper it.  Adding the meat to the red sauce rather than the shell stuffing is also an option.

The white sauce needs something.  I would suggest adding white wine and/or a minced garlic clove to give it more depth.  I also cut the chicken buillion to 1 tsp., but I think you could omit it completely if you added the wine/garlic.

I sprinkled the top of the dish with mozzarella/parmesean, and it could use it before the white sauce is added also.

All in all the premise of this dish is a good one, and I wasn't intimidated by the labor (it took about 45 min. total to put together from start to finish).  I think if you try these variations above, it could be a really spectacular dish.

Great flavor. The white sauce was a huge hit. The only thing I am going to try next time is too cut down on the spinach and add a little extra marinara.

This was delicious!  It tastes just like something you would order in a restaurant.  I only gave it four stars though because it does take some time to make and it is not a recipe that I can just make whenev.  It requires planning and purchasing in advance, and time.  If not for that, it is definitely a 5 just based on flavor!

The whole family loved this meal!  It is time consuming but worth the effort.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut the bouillon in half.  It was seasoned fine with this cut.  Next time, I plan to cook some sausage with the hamburger meat or add a little Italian seasoning to the hamburger meat.  I also crowded the manicotti shells too much.  I would suggest leaving a little space between each, so they don't break when you serve them.  Will make this meal again!!!

I'm surprised that so many people are rating this dish so highly.  The flavors seemed pretty bland to me.  The filling seemed like it was really missing something (perhaps adding some Italian sausage would help).  And a rich, creamy white sauce should taste so delicious that it is tempting to dip your finger in and eat it all by itself -- but this white sauce was just odd -- salty, chicken flavored, not well rounded.    My family did eat the manicotti, but without too much enthusiasm, saying, "It's o.k." Considering how much time it took to make this dish, it would need to elicit a "Mmmmm...this is so good!!!" response for me to bother making it again.  (I got that response instead from the World's Best Lasagna recipe, which has amazingly deep and satisfying flavors).

I used half the spinach and 1 bouillon. I think it would have been better with the sausage as well.

This manicotti could be so much better. If making again I would omit the spinach. The flavor is too overpowering in this dish. I would omit the white sauce, too much work for no taste. I would stuff the shells with the meat mixture and cover in lots of red sauce.

My hubby requested Italian food, and I wanted to do something different than lasagna. This was wonderful! Worth the effort, as my hubby had 5 helpings!

Very good...used 1 lb. sweet Italian sausage, made homemade sauce and added a teaspoon of basil and Italian seasoning to filling.  Topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.

Messy & time consuming but great! Use fresh spinach & saute.  Substitute italian saugage flavored turkey for beef (healthier & great flavor).  Used ziploc bag w/cut corner to fill manicotti shells.

This was so delicious. This was also very filling. My ricotta cheese was past date so I used some sour cream, mozarella, and a handful of shredded romano as a substitute. I used the sauce from AR "spaghetti with marinara sauce" in this. The cream sauce was great with the red tomatoey sauce and it all made a fantastic dish. Very time consuming and dirtied quite a few dishes too. This would be great for holidays or other gatherings but isn't suited well for a quick weeknight meal. A bit too much spinach though for the amount of beef. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's very good.

Made this for my mother's 50th. Everyone loved it so much. I made my own ricotta and nixed the bechamel (white sauce. mom's weird about white sauces), andmade my own red sauce. Other than that followed it word for word. Use a piping bag by the way, don't cut the pasta. Take the extra step to make it right, don't cheat.

This was very good, but quite time-consuming to make.  I found it difficult to stuff the manicotti shells, although that isn't the fault of the recipe.  I added some mozzarella cheese to the ricotta mixture in the recipe...very good!

Everyone raved about this dish! It was delicious. I did make a couple of changes to make it a bit lighter - I used 1 1/2 cups low-fat ricotta and 1/2 light sour cream for the 2 cups ricotta, I used 2% milk instead of half-n-half for the cream sauce, and ground turkey instead of beef - everything still tasted really good.

Now one of my families favorites, but stuffing the manicotti is a little difficult.  If I am making for just my family I use lazagna noodles and make it more like lazagna. It is a great way to get kids to eat spinach.

This is really good but really time consuming. I gave it four stars because I don't like the taste of frozen spinach. When I make this again, I will use fresh but that is just a personal preference.

My family loved the complex flavors! I didn't think it was that much work, and with leftovers it's worth a little extra time anyway. It was made just as the recipe suggested except I added a bit of mozzarella on top. It was so good that I think I'll add more mozzarella next time. I already have requests for this one again! Husband bragged to his cooworkers about how good it was.

OMG delicious!!!  I did make a homemade spaghetti sauce to go with this.  I used the world's best lasagna sauce, minus the meat, from this site.  It was so flavorful.  My family LOVED this dish!  It was quite a bit of effort and be prepared for quite a mess and plenty of dishes to wash! =)  This recipe is out of this world!

This was great! I used italian sausage instead of ground beef, strained the frozen spinach and sauteed it in oliveoil and garlic. I also sprinkled some mozzerella on the top. Delish!

This is an exellent dish! Made it as a surprise for my mom while she was away. When she came back home she raved on it the whole dinner time.  Although while making the white sauce I did find that it tasted to strongly of chicken bouillon I thought it ruined the sauce but after adding some fresh parsley and a little of Johnny's garlic caesar spread & seasoning also omitting the salt I found that it fixed the problem.

Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Will definitely use fresh spinach next time. I left out the salt and the chicken bouillion after reading previous reviews about the saltiness. The white sauce was a little bland, so next time I will add more seasonings and perhaps some salt-free bouillion. Over all good recipe, will make again with some more tweaking.

I thought too much meat.  I prefer manicotti to be cheesier.  As you know going in, manicotti is a lot of work.  These just weren't worth all the effort.  They are good but not great.  I'll make again but with half or none of the beef.  The white sauce is fantastic.

My family LOVES this recipie, even my young children eat it. I made just a few changes, I used the mild italian sausage but ommited the garlic and onion. I ran it through a food proccessor before adding to cheese for consistency.I also added about a half cup finely shredded parmesean and mozzerela cheese to the mixture. I also added a half cup parmesean to the white sauce after cooking to give it more substance. I make this regularly for gatherings, and always get raving reviews

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  This is delicious!!  This was my first time making anything like this.  I used lots of pans and made a big mess, but it was so worth it!  Now that I know exactly what to do, it will be much easier.  We used Italian sausage instead of hamburger which I will definately do again.  Thank you to the reviewer who said to put the filling in a ziploc and cut the end off to squeeze into the shells.  My daughter helped hold the shell while I squeezed it in.  We had so much fun!  Try this recipe!!

*Please note, there is prep time and precooking times to consider! Better yet, make it ahead of time and bake when needed! Just don't start this at dinner time. For me, it was about 2 hours until we sat down to eat. We thought this was good.  I adapted this and made with chicken and used homemade spaghetti sauce.

This is by far one of the best manicotti recipes I have tried in a long time. I doubled the amount of onion and put the basil and parmesan inside the filling and added 1 T. of fresh parsley to the filling also. I used half a pound of ground beef and half a pound of Italian sausage, which worked out very well. I did add some fresh ground pepper to the white sauce and used fat free half and half and it turned out wonderful. I topped it with about 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella before baking it in the oven. I served this with brushetta and it made a great meal. I, too, ended up with quite a bit of filling left and also about a cup of spaghetti sauce left over since I bought an extra large jar. I just combined the filling and spaghetti sauce and froze it and I'll use it at a later date with pasta and top with parmesan and mozzarella. Great recipe but be prepared, it does take quite a bit of time.

I LOVED IT. This was the first time I've made stuffed manicotti and I'm glad that I chose this recipe. It had the spinach and cheese which I like and the meat that my husband and sons like. I had some stuffing mixture and pasta shells left over so I stuffed them and put them in the freezer. I added some mozzarella cheese that I had from a dinner event that I had some time ago and this was the topping on the cake. Even my chef brother inlaw loved this recipe. Thanks for the recipe and I WILL be making this again.

Awesome recipe!  I wanted to this to freeze for later (expecting a baby in a few weeks!), so I used one pound of ground beef and one pound of ground mild italian sausage. Great combination! 

Regarding the spinach, I steamed the spinach and then made sure to drain it before adding to the meat mixture.

Also, be careful with the salt if you are doubling-two tablespoons is a lot. It turns out ok, but it didn't need that much for the recipe.

Great recipe and would be great for "giving".

Mmmm this was so good!  It's a pretty time consuming meal but worth it.  I used cannelloni shells because that's what I had on hand.  I think it was easier to stuff these because they're smaller and they were oven ready (no need to par boil).  I also used italian sausage rather than beef and added italian seasoning.  This was so good!

I have made this recipe a few times and it is one of my favorites to make, especially when I have guests coming over.  The white sauce definitely is the KILLER in this recipe!!  Loved by all!!  I did add Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese to the white sauce for extra flavor.  This meal is a bit time consuming; I just drink one of the small bottle of wines while cooking.  Enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic!! I made a few alterations...instead of making the manicotti, I did stuffed shells, not the huge shells, but the medium sized ones. Also, my grocery store didn't have any fresh basil, so instead of buying basil, parsley, parmesan, and garlic, I bought Oliveri pesto sauce, which contained all of these ingredients and saved me a lot of time (and money). I only used about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the pesto sauce, and the flavour of the shells were fanatastic! Thank you so much for this recipe...it was a great hit!!

OMG! What a great recipe.  I doubled the meat as I added 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage but forgot to buy an extra container of ricotta.  I ended up putting in a leftover amount of goat cheese.  It turned out great!  I had WAY too much filling left over (as expected) so I put the meat mixture in a ziplock and threw it in the freezer.  I didn't cook the noodles before hand and stuffed the raw shells using a small spoon, it was so much easier. Just make sure you add more sauce to the bottom of the pan and around each manicotti.  I baked them covered for about 55 min, then uncovered with the added parm cheese for another 10 min.  Let stand for 10 mins as stated.  AWESOME!

Everyone loved it. Next time I want to try it with half ground beef half italian sausage like others suggested. I think it was good with the white sauce, but I think it would be fine without it too if you don't have the extra time.

Wow!  This was AMAZING.  I used sweet Italian turkey sausage (casings removed) instead of the ground meat and used more (a large handful) fresh basil in the sauce.  I put the filling in a plastic bag with the corner cut off to fill the manicotti really fast and easy. It made enough to fill a 13x9 baking dish and I had 5 left over to put in another dish, which I wrapped in plastic and tinfoil to freeze and bake at another time.  The instructions on the box of manicotti said to cook it 1.5 hours at 350* from frozen so hopefully it comes out.  I can't wait to have this again.  It wasn't really as labor-intensive as I thought it would be, but it was well worth the effort.

I thought I had done something wrong , where's the meat ?? The white sauce did nothing for the taste and overall it's somewhat bland .My wife likes anything she doesn't have to cook herself so thought it was ok.

i made this exactly how stated.  i was expecting more.  don't get me wrong it was very good, but i don't know if it is worth the extra effort making the white sauce?  i loved the meat/spinach/cheese mixture, but next time i think i will just stick with red sauce and top with mozzarella.  the white sauce was good, so if i am in the mood for white sauce this would be good all by itself.  i just don't feel by mixing the white and red together did the white justice for the extra work.

This recipes is awesome!!  I'm not one to post reviews, but I had to for this recipe!  I made it almost exactly as stated except for a few modifications.  I added extra garlic and used ground chicken instead of the beef or sausage as others had used/suggested.  I also didn't have chicken bouillon so instead I just added a bit of grated parmesan and salt to the white sauce.  I used dried basil instead of fresh basil.  This was a great recipe, thanks a lot!!

This is great! I did, however, change things up a bit. I used 1 pound Italian sausage in place of the ground beef, 2 1/2 cups of cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, and sprinkled shredded mozzerella cheese on top before popping it in the oven. Then once the 40 minutes was up, I uncovered it and sprinlkled the parmesan over top before putting it back in. Yummy!

Gorgeous! I was unable to find Manicotti shells here in Australia so I used a jumbo shell instead and this worked fine. Not a great fan of beef mince so I used pork and was really happy with the result. Might try pork and Italian sausage next time and see how that turns out. Loved the white sauce although I did worry about the calorie content just a little...... Not to worry that is what we pound the pavement for! It did take time but with a glass of wine and some good music in the background I did not feel it dragged on to much. My daughter helped me stuff the shells which was fun. Impress your family and friends with this fabulous dish!

Outstanding - you must try this one!  I used sausage instead of the beef - but other than that followed the directions exactly.  The white sauce was so delicious I would have it ate it like soup if I didn't have any self control!  I don't know why everyone complains about it taking so long - that's the fun part to me!

FABULOUS! And though a teeny bit time-consuming it was actually a lot of fun to put together...I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. Italian sausage, cooked the spinach in the meat mixture toward the end of the meat's cooking time and then used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (personal preference and I'm part Italian!).  Rolled mixture into the "Manicotti Shells" recipe from this site (which are actually Cannelloni shells thus making Cannelloni rather than Manicotti but it was still fabulous) and continued the rest of the recipe.  Absolutely perfect, my husband is convinced I am a goddess in the kitchen!  Thank you SO much for sharing this!!!

Instead of the bouillon I used a mix of cream of chicken and half and half to make a sauce and adjusted the salt to my liking. Added some fennel seeds to the ground beef for sausage flavor as I didn't have sausage and also added previously sauteed and pureed, green peppers, onion, garlic, oregano and a bit of tomato sauce to the beef.

Delish!!!  Substituted hot italian sausage for beef and I didn't cook the spinach first, just defrosted in the microwave and it turned out great.  Also, I used large shells instead of manicotti.  Definitely a KEEPER!

This recipe was excellent. I followed exactly, except used 3/4 lb beef and 1/4 lb sweet turkey sausage. I used Ragu traditional as someone else mentioned and it was perfect. The white sauce was excellent! This is a keeper!

Fabulous!!!  The recipe looks a little daunting buts it's very simple and worth it.  I altered from the recipe and added some bacon slices with the onions and garlic because some other reviewers suggested sausage but I don't like and the bacon added some more flavor to the filling.  The white sauce if great although I used less 1/2 and 1/2 and a little white wine.  Used a pastry bag.

Made as is. Very salty. Do not add the 1 Tbsp to filling. 1 tsp would probably be ok.

Totally awesome.  The white bechamel sauce used in this recipe is now my go to.  It has so much flavor. This recipe is great to prepare ahead of time, refrigerate, and then serve right before company comes.

My husband made this for me for my birthday dinner and it was great!  We both agree that it would have been better with sausage and he topped it all with mozzarella cheese as well.  The kids (3years and 1.5 years) ate it up as well - but we did have to tell the 3 year old that it was broccoli and not spinnach :)

This was really good. The other reviewers complained that it took so long to make, but I thought the preparation went very smoothly and was quite fun. Next time I will use 1.5 times the meat. I added Italian seasoning to the beef while cooking, and it could have even used a little more, but was still delicous as is. This would obviously be extremely good with sausage, but that would add way too much fat, so I think I'll stick with the lean ground beef. The white sauce was awesome.  This recipe is boyfriend approved, he cleaned his plate and ate all the leftovers.Definitely worth trying, especially if you're a beginning cook like me.

This was my first attempt at Manicotti and turned out great.  I used 50/50 hamburger and italian sausage.  I also added oregeno, italian seasoning, and marjoram to the filling.  Next time I will use all sausage.  I also added a little red pepper for added kick.

I overcooked the manicotti I believe because I had trouble with cracking but it didn't affect the taste.  The white sauce is superb.

Fixed for my share of christmas dinner and the impossible to please grandma came back for seconds.  Quite a bit of work (for a rookie anyway) but well worth it!

I love this dish.  I have made it many times.  The only changes I made was adding a bit of Tex Mex spice to the filling (just for a tiny bit of spice) and I used fresh spinach instead.

I followed the recipe exactly but should have gone with the suggestions that others posted. As is, the recipe seriously lacks flavor...big time. For the amount of work put into making this, the flavor is just flat and bland. It's a good concept, but isn't anything to write home about. Next time I will add a lot more spices and garlic.

i stuck pretty close to the script except that i used 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 ground round. also added basil, oregano, and italian spices (i know, that's kind of redudant), but the basil and oregano were home grown. a lot of worth but absolutely worth every minute. just one superb recipe.

This was very good, i browned the beef with garlic, onion, s&p, and I added the spinach, added a pinch of crushed red peppers.  For the "bishamel" I didnt add the chicken bouillon, just thought that was wierd, so i seasoned with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.  put all ingredients in a ziploc bag, and piped into the shells. Must admit, was quite a messy challenge, since the noodles like to crack. But once baked and eaten, it was well worth the effort!!!!

Wow! This is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever made. FANTANSTIC! I used slightly over 1 Lb lean ground beef and did not use italian sausage as many others suggested.  I did add a little italian spice to the beef while cooking it and did not use the full amount of salt.  I only needed about 3/4 jar of tomato sauce..too much would overpower the cream sauce. I used about half the amount of spinach. I also added some mozza cheese into the meat mixture and sprinkled some on top as well.  This was amazing! Next time I would use less chicken bouillon in the cream sauce or a different alfredo/cream sauce recipe altogether. While this sauce went nicley with this dish it would not stand alone as a good cream sauce.  I would also put a little more effort into the tomato sauce.  It was alot of work to put this dish together and I felt I was cheating using a jar of store bought red sauce.  A homemade tomato sauce with zucchini and a tried and true alfredo sauce would make this dish truly SUBLIME.  Lots of cleanup and lots of dishes while preparing, next time I'll prepare this dish well ahead of time and bake it just before serving.

Oh my god, with some sausage with the beef and some italian seasoning, this recipe is FANTASTIC! I even made it a second time with large shells and it also came out great. I took a dish to work with me and everyone paid $5 a plate and loved it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic.  I've made it twice so far.  I made it recently for our wedding anniversary and my husband raved about it.  He said it was much better then going out to dinner and we had lots of leftovers.    The filling ended up making about 21 manicotti.  I used 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef as others suggested.  It came out great.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very tasty recipe. Be warned, it is time-consuming, but worth the wait. The flavors of the combined marinara and alfredo sauces is absolutely the best part! I'm contemplating subbing half the ricotta for mozzerella, as I'm not a huge fan of ricotta. Thanks so much for the delicious recipe!

This took a lot of time, but well worth it.  I had to make some changes because I didn't have 1/2 & 1/2.  Instead, I used cottage cheese and a dash of skim milk.  I also added mozzarella cheese.  I WILL make this again!  Thanks!

This was restaurant quality and pretty easy to make.  I used a pastry bag fitted with the large Wilton coupler to fill the manicotti.  It made it go a lot quicker.  I refrigerated overnight and baked the next day.  Also, I did not make the white sauce (to cut calories) and just poured the jarred red sauce over the top.  Delicious!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. Was told it was 'restaurant quality" and everyone raved about it. Did follow others directions to use 1/2 ground chuck/ 1/2 italian sausage and not use the chicken bouillon. Will definitely make this often!

FAVORITE recipe of all time!  Although it's messy and takes awhile to make, I do love making these because they are excellent and better than restaurant style!  I stuff them with my hands because I'm not sure it's possible to stuff with utensils and not break the noodles.  Would not change a single thing about this recipe!!

This definitely needs extra spices (mor garlic, basil, etc.)! Also, please sub the ground beef with Italian sausage.  You will not regret it.

This was fabulous!  I made it last night for my dad, brother, and boyfriend...doubled the recipe, used one box of noodles and only had a little meat left over.  Took a while but definitely worth it!!  I wasnt too sure about the red and white sauces but it was excellent, the white sauce is to die for!!  Great dish!  Everyone had seconds and cant wait for leftovers!

Terrific.  I halfed the recipe because I was only cooking for two, but I kept the sauce the same.  Incredible!  The beef could use a little seasoning, but I advise others NOT to use store bought alfredo and use the sauce on the site.  I think that is what makes it as delicious as it is.  I also left out the spinach (I'm just not a fan), and added some mozz. cheese to the ricotta.  Perfect!

This was terrific!  I modified a few things.  Since I was using fresh spinash, I added it to the warm ground beef in order to get it wilted.  Also, I added some parmesan cheese to the stuffing and also in the white sauce.  I used the "oven ready" pasta which saved me the trouble of cooking the pasta, this made this somewhat time-consuming recipe, that much easier to make.  Last thing I changed was that I topped the dish with mozarella for the last 10 minutes of baking. I had some trouble layering the white sauce, it pretty much blended in, but it was still delicious!

Very good recipe. I followed the meat mixture but I used jumbo shells instead of manicotti and bought alfredo sauce instead of making it. I also used parmesan and mozzarella cheese. It was excellent.

Excellent dish! Some adjustments I made: was too lazy to hunt for the herbs since my generic grocery store did not have them, so omitted the basil and parsley. I made it with half ground beef and half sausage as some people suggested [great taste!]. I left out the eggs because I completely forgot about them. oops. and instead of the white sauce, made the Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce found here at allrecipes.com. Next time, I'll do the stuffing ahead of time (night before) so as to break down the prep time. and I might cut down on the ricotta as I'm not a big fan. Added some cajun spice, dash of red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to the stuffing mix. It still turned out great with everything!

This is a great recipe (although I use italian sausage instead of ground beef), but it does take a lot of time to prepare. It is worth it to make a double batch and freeze them in one meal increments so when you want them again (which will be soon), you will already have them on hand.

I made two changes to this recipe, I used mild italian sausage (don't like the flavor of ground beef in any kind of pasta) and two bunches of fresh spinach(blanched). I also used my own home made spagetti sauce. It turned out delicious!!! Everyone loved it, everything was perfect. Definately  will make again. Two thumps up!

This was very good. I only used half the package of spinach and I added a diced red pepper and 1 cup mozzerella cheese into the meat mixture (the mozza cheese I added after it had cooled a bit). Thanks for a great pasta recipe!! 
Took some time, made a mess and had a GREAT meal!

So delicious! I didn't have chicken boullion so I just added some parmesean to the white sauce instead. It gave the sauce great flavor. I would definately make this recipe again. Perfect for a dinner party.

I didn't find that this took any more prep time than a typical lasagna recipe but even if it took 6 hours to prepare it would be well worth the effort.  This was delicious, made for a good presentation and could be made ahead if need be(so it would be great to make if company is coming over).  In fact after we had it we were planning our next party with this as the main course!

I made this recipe for a small potluck I went to yesterday that had an Italian theme to it.  Everyone just loved it!  We usually divide up he leftovers between ourselves, and I went home with an empty dish!!  This did take a little time to prepare, but it was well worth it.  I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out absolutely perfect.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe with us.  I will be making this many more times!

Bueno Bueno Bueno!!!
This was delicious.
I did omit the spinach as my husband hates it...
Even without the spinach, this was without a doubt one of the best manicott I have EVER HAD!

This was a great recipe.  Instead of using half and half in the cream sauce I used 1% milk and it tasted great. I also used jumbo shell noodles instead of manicotti. My kids even loved it--they said "it tastes like we are eating at a resturaunt".

I thought this was an pretty good recipe.  The only thing I did not like was the white sauce.  It tasted bad by itself, but luckily the tomato sauce covered the taste.  Next time I will definitely leave out the white sauce.

I forgot to mention in my first review that I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage.  I also used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese.

Really good, although it did seem like a lot of work to make and my old stand-by manicotti recipe is just as delicious yet quicker to make.

This was good. I omitted the spinach and chicken bouillon.   I used sausage instead of the ground beef. I add a handful of mozzarella cheese to the ricotta mixture and on top with the parmesan cheese.    I will add more garlic next time i thought it needed a stronger flavor.  The recipe made more than what would fit in one 9 x 13 inch dish.

Yummy!  Somehow I burnt the bottom, but the whole family still loved it.  It was somewhat tedious stuffing all the shells - next time I think I'll slit them open and roll them up with the filling, placing them seam side down in the pan.  Loved the spinach!

I'm sorry! I didn't see the greatness of this recipe.  The white sauce was very bland.  My hubby and I both thought it was lacking something but couldn't quite figure out what. Looked pretty though!

No question--the best homemade 'bannana potty' (as my 3 y/o calls it!) hands down!  It does take a little more time, but worth the effort. The only changes I made were to leave out the parsly and basil as the pasta sauce (marinara) I used did the trick. Thanks, Mark, for sharing your secrets!

This dish is delicious!  But it does take some time to prepare.  I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of beef, used fresh spinach, and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  I sauted the mushrooms with the onions, butter & garlic.  The two sauces taste amazing together!  I will definitely be making this again, hopefully it will be quicker for the second time around!  Thanks Mark!

It was a good manicotti dish. I couldn't taste much of the white sauce because the spaghetti sauce I used overpowered it (I probably used too much, I didn't measure it, I just poured it on) I also ended up having TONS of the stuffing left over, so I put it in a baking dish, sprinkled with some seasoned bread crumbs and parm cheese and baked along with the manicotti. I think next time I will just make the stuffing as a casserole!

I was disappointed with this recipe after all the great ratings.  The manicotti stuffing didn't have enough flavor.  If I make it again, I would leave the meat out and put more spices and different cheeses in it.

This was fantastic!!  My three year old even asked for seconds!   I actaully prepared the shells the night before, and then made the sauce a few hours before my company arrived and had it all ready to throw into the oven.   I also added mozza cheese on the top!!   yummy!

I thought this was a terrific dish as well. The addition of the white sauce really gives it some richness. My dinner guests thought it was great and that "it must have taken a lot of work". They were impressed, and definitely appreciated the result!

Excellent dish!  I omitted the spinach, sorry to say, but added 1/2 cup of mozzarella to the meat and ricotta.  I ended up with almost the exact amount of filling needed for the shells-it seems with other recipes I always have way too much or not even close to enough!  The best part of this dish was the 2 sauces, I used my own homemade red sauce and what a combo with the white sauce too!  It was fabulous, leftovers were also excellent.  This dish does take some time, but it is well worth it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will always use this one for manicotti from now on.  Thanks again.

Love this!!!  The recipe said it took 1 hour to prepare and I found it took a bit longer than that -- but it was well worth it.  The creamy white sauce mixed with the tomoato sauce really finishes off the Manicotti.  If you have some time this is a great dish for company.

It took less time to make this dish that I thought it would by just reading it. I served it at a church dinner party of 17 people (including kids). Everyone LOVED it, I had 5 requests for the recipe. My wife and I even froze the left over filling and made it again 2 weeks later.

This is the best manicotti recipe that I have made.  It is a little time consuming, but well worth the wait.  Next time I will try sausage instead of beef.  The white sauce is really good! :)

I've tried other manicotti recipies that my family has eaten but without enthusiam.  This got top billing from them.  My husband said it was a "keeper".  I love the white sauce in it. I'll also be incorporating it into other recipies. Yum!!

While this recipe is abit of work it's really not hard just time consuming and my family loved it. If you have the time I recommend this for a dinner party with friends you want to impress.

I loved this Manicotti. I've never had it with meat, spinach or a white sauce. Takes a little time and can be messy but I love to cook and it was fun.

Used 1/2 hamburger, 1/2 sausage.  I made the beef mixture the day before and put in fridge.  Noticed it was so much easier to stuff the manicotti when the mixture is cold.  

I only use 8 oz of Manicotti which is one box.  I do end up with some filling leftover.  I cover with the same amount of sauces.  Family of three eats it all in 3 days.

This was very tasty but I found the filling to be on the dry side.  When I make it again, I am going to try to remedy this.

I followed the recipe to the letter and OMG.... DELICIOUS!!!!  My husband gave it a 10 out of 10!  We will definitely be making again.  I think we might try what another user suggested and mix the ground beef with some sausage!  This was also a hit with my kids and the leftovers the next day might have even been better than the first night's serving!

The Italian man in the house thought these were fantastic.   So, I’ll definitely make them again.  Prob just half the recipe as the whole was too much for the two of us.  It was easy to make

This is a great recipe! I only made two modifications: I used spicy pork sausage instead of hamburger and used about half of the packet of spinach! Makes for great leftovers too!

We used lean ground beef but next time will use the Italian sausage which would give a bit more flavor.

I made this exactly as stated several times. I eventually switched the Manicotti for Giant Stuffed Shells, only because stuffing the manicotti took so long. It is as good and so much quicker and easier to create.

Absolutely amazing. First time I've ever made it and it came out beautifully. Though points off myself for adding the basil to the sauce since the sauce was already herbed up. Will be adding this to my regular rotation.

I followed the recipe exactly and my family all found it really lacked flavor. We didn't even keep the leftovers. If I tried it again would substitute Italian sausage for the hamburger.

I've made it quite a few times and we prefer sausage over beef but love it! I use a bit more butter and flour in the white sauce and chicken bouillon to taste. Also to stuff the shells clip the corner off of a sandwich bag put the filling in and squeeze it into the shells. It makes it super easy and quick!

I made it my way.  I used homemade crepes, instead of, store bought shells.  I used three cheeses(Ricotta, Shredded Mozzarella, grated Parmesan).  I used Three Cheese Marinara Sauce instead of Tomato Sauce.  Delicious!

After reading reviews, I also used half spicy Italian sausage and half hamburger and then made as noted. My kitchen did look like a disaster area after all the prep, but this dish was well worth all the dirty dishes. My hubby raved about this one. Made a use batch so looking forward to leftovers for the next couple of days.

I used this recipe to make stuffed shells. I used
1-1/2 lbs ground beef and everything else stayed the same except pasta. I didn’t make the sauces. 
If I was to make manicotti I would still use more ground beef.

I love this dish and get rave reviews every time I make it. I do sub out the ground beef for Hot Italian Sausage because we love the extra spice (and seasoning). I also do not pre cook the manicotti shells, no need. I use a plastic bag with the filling to pipe into the shells. Easy and SOO delish!

Fantastic!  I did make a few changes:  Mild Italian sausage instead of hamburger, small can of spinach instead of frozen, 14 manicotti shells (not enough filling for more), 1 tsp. chicken Better Than Bouillon, 1 cup Parmesan.  I also made homemade marinara instead of jarred spaghetti sauce.

This was a nice meal. I highly recommend following the advice of others by substituting ground sausage for the hamburg.  Also, definitely make the white sauce. It added a deeper flavor to each bite, making this a unique and tasty recipe! I will make this again for sure.

Exactly what I was looking for!  Took others suggestions and made with half Italian Sausage and half beef, and only used half (1TBL of chicken bullion) but other than that exactly as written and it was beyond delicious!  Cream sauce really does make it over the top.  I piped my filling into the shells and I don't know if it could have been any faster by cutting them open and filling, because piping was fast and easy.  Make this dish and you won't be disappointed!

This was very good.  No changes needed to the recipe. Just make sure to take some cooking time off of the manicotti. I had a hard time not breaking the tubes while stuffing.  I made extra of the filling and froze it. I will be making this again.

This is by far the best Italian dish I have ever made!! It is a bit of work, but so worth it!!  If I could give it 10 stars I would. Secret for making a little easier. Cook manicotti in salted water just until the pasta becomes soft 2-3 minutes. Working quickly cut the pasta lengthwise and fill with meat mixture and place in pan cut side down. So much easier than trying to "stuff" and no one is the wiser. I also use Italian sausage (sweet or hot) whatever your preference is in place of some of the meat. About half and half.

Nex time, I will add some finely chopped veg (peppers, broccoli, mushrooms) to the meat mixture.  I would also add more spaghetti sauce/tomato sauce.  Lastly, I would triple the amount of basil.

I loved this recipe, I used 50% hot Italian sausage and 50% ground beef, and it had wonderful flavor!  I froze half the shells without the sauce for a quick and easy dinner some week night!

I have made this recipe several times, and it has evolved a bit. I make it more like a baked ziti so that I can skip the stuffing step. I mix the ziti and spinach/meat mixture, place into the baking dish and top with the red and white sauces. At this point the meal can be frozen for future cooking or cooked and enjoyed then. A delish meal any way!

I made it with fresh spinach. I love fresh. I never use frozen. Such a delicious meal. Best of both worlds with the cream sauce and red sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

WOW!!! First of all, I don't just go around handing out 5 stars all willy nilly! However, this  recipe is VERY deserving of the 5 stars!!! The only change that I made is that I used mild Italian sausage. I also used a very, very good store bought marinara(Publix had it on bogo)La Famiglia Del Grosso is the brand and it is really,really good. Make this, it takes a good bit of time, but it is totally worth it!!!!

After the first time, I left out the white sauce because I didn't think it added anything to the recipe other than looking nice.  I also use Italian sausage rather than ground beef, but that is just our preference.  If you find that this recipe makes more filling than you have shells for, you can always put the sausage in the  sauce that goes on top rather than in the filling mixture the next time you make it.  I now buy two boxes of pasta shells so I have a few extra to use up all the filling.  Great recipe with a couple small changes!

This recipe was a great recipe. I  didn't care for the white sauce it reminded me of chicken gravy, but my family loved it! Next time I will follow the same recipe again and try with Alfredo sauce to replace the white sauce!

Made this for Christmas Eve 2015 and used spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I sort of halved the recipe as I had a box that was 12 oz. of manicotti (14 of them) and I only had 0.65 of a pound of meat.  I went ahead and used 2 cups of whole milk ricotta since I was using no spinach.  I will say the filling was a little runny.  It all tasted good but would have been better if the filling was stiffer.  Using half of everything listed (except the ricotta), it filled 11 of the manicotti shells.

Very Good. I didn't have chicken bouillon granules so I substituted 3 teaspoons of chicken base for the white sauce. Italian sausage is a good option as well as some mozzarella sprinkled on top of the parmesan cheese. Thanks for the submission.

Liked this a lot. It did take some time but worth it. Add some italian sausage to spice it up. Also left out chicken bouillon cuz I did not have any but it did not seem to make a difference. Will be trying this again.

I made the recipe as written, except I substituted sweet Italian sausage for ground beef. It was good, but given the amount of work, I don't feel like the taste was worth the work. I would rather have manicotti stuffed with an easier cheese filling.j

This is definitely a lot of work but so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and doubled the batch, even took a little pan to work for a potluck. Even with doubling it, it didn't even last 2 days. This is a weekend dish only since it takes so much time and definitely need to be planned ahead for but very delicious!

I have made this dozens of times, one of my favorite recipes!  The only things I changed was using Italian sausage and some days I had a difficult time filling the shells.  Now I just skip the worst of the mess and fill them hard and bake it a bit longer.  Turns out perfect!

I don't normally review recipes (though I should because that's how I find such good ones from here). This recipe is perfect except sub ground beef with Italian pork and it will blow your mind!!! The white sauce is so insanely good I want to figure out other ways to use it. Yummy!!!!

Fabulous! I had a bit of stuffing left over so went back to the store the next day, bought another pack of noodles, and made up a smaller dish to freeze for another night.

For anyone who thinks stuffing manicotti is a challenge, try putting your sit puffing into a ziplock bag and clipping a corner off.  It works just like a piping bag.  I liked this recipe with Italian sausage.

I realize that there are some members of this community that don't like it when you rate something 5 stars when you make changes. I wish to politely disagree.  I always read the reviews before I make something from this site.  I consider myself a good cook but I always learn something from you guys and gals.  This turned out fantastic and everyone loved it.  It is a ton of work.  Lots of steps.  I used all Italian sausage, fresh spinach, fresh parmesan and a little mozzarella in the shell stuffing mix.  I used one and a half cups Ricotta as I am not a big fan. I made the white sauce as recommend by so many reviewers with only one tablespoon bullion and added some fresh grated parmesan to it as well.  I used a homemade tomato sauce that is a family favorite.  There is enough stuffing to do another box of Manicotti shells. So it is in the freezer.  It was delicious.  Other than using the left overs for a second batch, I would only attempt this again for special occasions, just because of how much work it is.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. He said it's his new favorite meal that I've cooked. When I make something new, I always ask if he would pay for the meal at a restaurant. He said for 3 manicotti noodles, he would've easily paid $18-$20. 
I'm on a strict diet, but took a bite and I must say, it was delicious! The only thing I would change is maybe use just half if the bouillon granules. While they gave the white sauce an awesome flavor, it left it a bit too salty for my liking.

One of if not the best I've made.  Only change was itialian sausage instead of beef.  I made this a month ago (on my boat) and although a bit time consuming it was easy even there.  Planning on making it again this week however this time I'm going to use jumbo shells.  Can't wait, just have to go to the local italian market (north end of Boston) for the best sausage ever.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!! And not as much "work" as I had feared. I pulled it together in about 30 min.
I only made three small changes -- I used Jumbo Shells instead of manicotti; I added quite a bit of salt (probably a 1/2 teaspoon or more) to the meat/cheese/spinach mixture; and instead of the 2 cups of half-and-half I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of half-and-half.
The layering of the white sauce and tomato sauce makes for an attractive presentation and it's rich enough that a simple salad and some Italian bread are enough to complete the meal. This dish was PERFECT in every way and I can't wait to make it again.

This is definitely my favorite manicotti recipe and is a keeper for sure.  I would go a little lighter on the parsley but the white sauce, onions and garlic are very nice additions.

Sooo good!!! My one year old almost are an entire shell by herself! The only thing I did differently is used a sweet basil tomato sauce and did not add extra basil. I also didn't measure the sauce on top or the cheese.

This wasn't great for me. Maybe I did not use a good enough sauce? I think if I were to make it again, I would make a homemade sauce. It was a little bland.

I have made this a couple times and I really like it.  I need to cut the garlic about in half to make it more kid friendly.  I split this into 2 casserole dishes and freeze one.  I don't add the cream sauce to the frozen casserole until I have it thawed and ready to make.  It's pretty easy to halve that and I think it wouldn't freeze well.  One kid loved it, one wouldn't touch it because of the "green stuff".  Nice change from the regular lasagna, and I liked that it had plenty of meat.

Excellent, and easy to make ahead.  I made mine early in the day and just allowed about 2 hours in a 350 oven for it to reheat,  I liked it with the ground meat.  I tried using the ziplock bag to stuff the manicotti, but I had used fresh spinach and I think they just weren't soft enough enough to easy go thru the bag,  I ended up just stuffing them with clean hands.
I couldn't afford the extra calories, so I made it without the white sauce.  I do realize that this changes the recipe taste, but I just wanted to share that the recipe is excellent with just the red spaghetti sauce -- I thinned it a little since the half cooked manicotti will soak up some of the liquid.  We're only a family of three, so I had enough leftover for a couple of lunches.  Just froze for another day.  I'll definitely make this again.

I really hesitated to use the white sauce in this but it was really a good meal.  4 stars because it lacked spices.  I used Italian sausage and added red pepper flakes and black pepper.  Also browned the meat with the onions and added the garlic at the end.  The olive oil is not necessary.

Excellent flavor and was a hit at my house. My kids really loved it. The only thing I did different was to add frozen spinach to the meat mixture once the meat was cooked . I then added the Ricotta and sone Cream Cheese. Once mixed well with a splash of onion and garlic powder, the reset went well. Stuffing the shells is kind of a pain, but once you get the hang of it, it goes case. The extra meat sauce was placed on the bottom of the dish with the sauce and then placed the shells. Used extra sauce to be sure the pasta was cooked thru, and voila...... Success!!!!

I had ricotta cheese & ground beef to use up & went searching for recipes that I had all the ingredients on hand & came up with this one. After reading reviews I thought AS WRITTEN the recipe might be a bit boring/bland (many who rated it 5-stars made A LOT OF CHANGES), but still some people raved about it as written so I thought it would be at least 3-star-okay & edible. But we really didn't like it. The filling is incredibly bland & the "white sauce" is INCREDIBLY salty. I feel bad that when I tasted the sauce I thought "way too salty" but I went ahead & put it on thinking it might turn out okay because the filling seemed to be quite boring/bland, but what was I thinking? Because the sauce & filling are separated it was biting into supersalty-sauce over veryblah filling. And the recipe calls for 12 oz pkg of shells, I used a 8 oz pkg (14 shells....I didn't add or subtract stars from the recipe because I had/used less shells than called for in the recipe) & I used all the rest of the ingredients as written & I barely had enough filling. We ended up eating only 4 shells for dinner & passed on seconds, & the other 10 shells sat in the fridge because nobody wanted the leftovers.

I make this exactly as directed and LOVE it. No need to be too careful with not breaking the shells, just stuff them as best you can. I also just add any remaining filling around the stuffed shells and it cooks great. Restaurant quality, and a keeper for sure! I would love if you could message me with any other of your catering recipes, as this was delicious. Thanks!

I can only say, what a great recipe.  I used italian sausage and stuffed the shells uncooked.  Just left them in a little longer.  Turned out great with an outstanding flavour.  Will never mind making Manicotti again.  Thanks!!

Although this recipe took quite a bit of time to prepare, the results were entirely worth it.  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  Make sure to drain the spinach well to prevent sogginess in the dish; I placed the cooked spinach in a strainer over a bowl, pressed down to remove liquid, and left it there for several minutes to drain.

Very delicious, filling meal!  I only used about half the ricotta cheese as my husband normally doesn't care for it.  I also only prepared about half of this recipe and am freezing half of the filling and sauce to be used next time.  A lot of work but very tasty- the two sauces make this especially good.

I made this recipe with my wife last night and followed the directions and ingredients exactly. It was excellent and everything I had hoped for. My wife said it was great but was expecting more spaghetti sauce on top. It took about an hour to prep and then of course the cook time, so this would probably be a good dish to bring for a holiday or prepare the night before and bake the night of. It's not a quick fix, but really good food!!!

Amazing! Made this last night for some friends and family they all loved it and it was so cute seeing the kids scrape their plates getting all the veggies up too. Followed some of the reviews and used sausage and ground turkey and used cottage cheese in place of ricotta cheese and added 1 cup of shredded italian cheese blend to that mixture a little bit of nutmeg then halfed that and added spinach to one half and broccoli to the other, since I hate spinach. To the white sauce I added 1 cup of itailan cheese and some italian seasoning. I also taste as I go along to see what is needed and add along the way like pepper and some hot pepper flakes yeah we love pepper. Since I had 5 adults and 3 kids to feed I doubled the recipe and had 28 stuffed manicotti noodles that I didn't boil before hand and this was my first time making stuffed noodles but I don't boil my lasagna either so I used more sauce and covered the pan tightly with foil and cooked on 400 for 40mins. Stuffing was not fun I had an issue with the pastry bag style stuffing that I dropped the bag in the pan with the red sauce and already stuffed shells and made a big mess of the kitchen. So I gave up on that and just used my hands to stuff which was a little bit easier but overall it was time consuming process from start to finish. The end result was worth it with not even enough for leftovers but this will only be a special occasion dish with all the work it takes.

My two picky eaters loved this!  Since my family is small, I reduced the amounts used for the filling:  I used a half-pound of ground beef; maybe about a cup's worth of fresh spinach (which I lightly boiled, then chopped before adding it to the beef); a cup of cottage cheese (we don't have ricotta); about a teaspoon of dried parsley; and then one beaten egg.  As I was using what I already had in the house, I also substituted in 12 jumbo shells (parboiled, about 6 minutes) instead of the manicotti tubes, which will give us enough for two meals.

I used the full amounts for the white sauce, though.  Yes, it was a little salty, but that's because I'm not used to too much salt.  My husband really liked the layering of the flavors between the white sauce and the jarred pasta sauce (I used one that had Italian sausage in it).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for the first time and everyone loved the final result who tried it. I did tweak some of the ingredients, to our tastes, but stuck pretty close to the original recipe. I had no trouble filling the manicotti shells with the filling after we placed in a zip-loc bag and cut the corner off to fill faster/easier. Overall this was a great recipe and we will definitely be cooking this one again.

All in all a great recipe! I suggest adding a little more cheese than this recipe calls for...i made this to serve four and had approx. A cup of shredded parmesan and Romano to top the manicotti. Also, be generous with your sauce, I followed the recipe and it was just a little dry. I will definitely make this one again!

The filling was way too bland as written (still bland even after I added some italian seasoning, used italian sausage and ground beef, and added salt and pepper). It was an ok dish, but I expected it to better based on the reviews. I had some filling leftover and made stuffed shells the next day but added things to the filling. If I were to make this again I would put more garlic, salt, pepper, and parmesan or mozzarella cheese in the filling. Parmesan really pepped up the filling the next day. I would also use more red sauce because I found it to be too dry. I'm not sure why people say the white sauce makes the dish because I also found that to be pretty bland as well. I think it would be better with an alfredo sauce. Overall, nice basic recipe.

Recipe is very good, however what I made was lazy variation of it. I did not have any Manicotti, I used shells noodles. And I didn't have any riccota cheese as well. So I tossed noodles with meat and spinach and egg mixer and poored sauses on top. It turned out very good and much much more easier to make:))

LOVED IT!  Just finished having this for dinner. It was well worth the preparation time and bake time. I forgot to buy half and half but I just used 1/4 a cup of the ricotta with some milk and shredded Parmesan to make the white sauce. It worked out well. I also added minced garlic to it. And Italian seasoning in the meat.

this was very very yummy; i did use sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef like everyone else. i ended up with a good amount of filling left over; it was a little difficult for me to use a ziplock bag, maybe im just dumb when it comes to that but it was probably much easier than spooning it into the cooked manicotti. so yummy and full of carbs and calories; will definitely make again!!

We loved this recipe!!!! I've tried a few stuffed shells recipes from this site and this is THE ONE!!! I didn't use the white sauce, just topped with more sauce and mozz. cheese and called it a night. I also made extra stuffed shells and froze them for an easy meal on a busy night. Thank You!

Very very good! Time consuming to prepare but worth it. The basil added to the spaghetti sauce really zested things up. I did it with ground beef and followed the recipe exactly before reviewing. I think next time we'll try Italian sausage like others have suggested.

I'm a complete novice when it comes to cooking. I was a little intimidated when I saw this recipe, but decided to give it a try anyway. I'm so glad I did!

 It was fairly simple to make and tasted wonderful! Some of the girls at work tried a bite whn I brought leftovers, and everyone was very impressed. 

I will DEFINATELY be making this in the future! Glad I came across this recipe.

I loved this dish.  My 5 and 3 year old kids ate it too.  I halved the garlic and didn't cook the noodles and then refrigerated it overnight and baked it the next day.  It turned out great!

An Absolutely Amazing Dish! I decided to use 1/2 Ground Italian Sausage and 1/2 Ground Beef and I'm so glad I did. The sausage adds so much flavor to this dish. Other then the sausage, I followed this recipe pretty much as written, even though I admit several times I was tempted to make big changes. I totally trusted another reviewer who said, "Just do it, you won't be sorry" and WOW was this ever amazing and delicious!! The white sauce was SO good! I used 2 PACKETS (not cubes) Herb-ox Instant Broth & Seasoning Chicken Bouillon (I didn't measure out 2 TBS), and it was so tasty and not salty at all. Don't skip the white sauce, it really makes this dish! For the spaghetti sauce I just used homemade sauce. It's a chunky sauce with a hint of sweetness and full of spices and lots of flavor so I didn't need to add the extra basil to the sauce. I did sprinkle a tiny bit of basil over the top of the parmesan at the end just for appearance. Thank you so much for this keeper recipe. I sure wish I would have made 2 batches!

This is an excellent recipe, and to me, is a lot faster to put together than the recipe had me thinking. I make a couple (easy) changes: no parsley in the white sauce, I use ground pork instead of ground beef (which I believe has a better, softer, consistency and flavor), and I top with mozzarella cheese rather than parmesan (purely personal preference). Otherwise, I stay pretty true to the recipe. One tip, when you make the white sauce, after the bullion and flour comes to a bubble in the butter, slowly add the half and half, a little bit at a time, and it'll be easier to prevent any possible chunks from happening.

This was so delicious that my hubby who doesn't normally like heated pasta the next day...said that he would take the left overs in his lunch...to make it quicker to make...I substituted alfredo sauce instead of making the white sauce from scratch.  It was so delicious!  Thank You!

This was very good.  Makes a large batch so there was quite a bit for leftovers.  My only comment on that is that is I would have liked a little more sauce for the leftovers as I found them to be slightly dry.

Thank you for sharing this Italian recipe.  I made a big batch of it for just the two of us.  We have enjoyed it and my husband has not minded that we had it as leftovers 3 days in a row!  I followed the recipe completely.  Served it with a nice green vegetable salad, some steamed yellow beans and strawberries for dessert! Just to note, I took longer than 1 hour to prepare even thou I am an advanced cook.

5 star taste with ground pork.  The calorie count is high, but worth the indulgence.  Prep was an hour even with me going pretty fast.  I used 1lb of pork and glad I didn't use any beef (so flavorful!).  I found a recipe online to make my own half and half by adding 1tbs of melted butter to 1 cup of whole milk.  I used a med zip lock for piping (SO EASY).  There was a ton of pans to clean up, but everyone loved this recipe - even my 4 year old.

I felt that it was missing something. I wouldn't recommend using ground beef, sausage would probably work much better for the missing something. However, it's a great recipe and does taste pretty good.

I made this almost exactly as written.  My only two changes were that I used 3 cloves of garlic and italian sausage rather than ground beef.  I got the sausage from Whole Foods - they sell bulk sausage in the fresh meat, so you don't have to remove the casings.

This recipe is delicious and great for impressing guests (although quite unhealthy so I won't add it into my regular rotation). The second time I made it, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and added shredded chicken to the ricotta mixture.

Oh... the white sauce! this recipe is fantastic! Of course you definitely have some elbow room in cooking this to suit your taste. Spice it up to your liking. Just make sure you use fresh ingredients, and try not to use jarred sauce! I like to do it with a homemade bolognese. The meat is extra awesome with 1/2 beef and 1/2 ground sausage.

Wonderful.  My husband is not a big italian fan and he raved over this dish (even told the neighbors).  Will def be making this again.  I find it easier to stuff uncooked noodles, so it took an hour to cook.  As many people have said it is very time-consuming, so keep that in mind.

Even my picky wife liked this one. We had relatives over and they all raved about it! FYI Cooking it with the shells left uncooked is fine as long as the shells are covered in sauce and you increase the cook time to about 1 hr 10 min, forget the chicken bouillon and add a little salt, italian sausage would have probably been good, but to be honest everything in this recipe is wonderfully perfect if you want to make it with no changes at all!

We loved this dish and devoured all of it in one sitting.  However, I am not a fan of spinach so I didn't include that when I made it.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent dish!!  I made this recipe as it is written with the exception of using Italian turkey sausage instead of beef.  My girlfried says she would have given it six stars.  Will definitely make again.

This was my meat day so I decided to give this a whirl. VERY good! But I really had my expectations high because my family is from Sicily---thats why only 4 stars.I made a few with bok choy (very similar to spinach) instead of spinach because I needed to use it. I also made some with just meat & ricotta. I preferred only meat, somehow the bok choy took away from the filling. I put my filling in a ziplock, snipped off the end for easy "stuffing". I would definatly make this again. And yeah it took a little time but DH & I opened a bottle of red wine and cooked this together.

My husband thought this was fantastic and I thought it was pretty good so I am giving it four stars. I didn't change anything except that I used dried basil instead of fresh. I also eyeballed the spinach because I didn't have an individual 10 oz package. It was good and I will make it again. Make sure you give yourself enough time to make it, it can be time consuming.

This was delicious!!!!  I made it for dinner tonight with mike's mushroom bread (from this site) and a nice fresh green salad w/  a  4 cheese italian dressing. Great Italian dinner!!! Will def be making again, everyone loved it. I added parmesan cheese and fresh sliced mozzarella to my meat mixture and used stuffed shells instead of manicotti's. This is a keeper. Thanks for posting!

I doubled the recipe so I would have some for my husbands Aunt and Uncle. She loved it! She said it was the best thing she had ever tasted. She told her son about it and now they both are wanting me to share the recipe so they can make it! My husband, who is a picky eater, Loved it as well! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Excellent! Medium difficulty, especially if the manicotti you buy has no "cooking time" and just says "cook until done". Cutting "done" in half is quite difficult.  Otherwise, best manicotti I've ever had, and a definite family favorite. I added a little Italian seasoning to the spaghetti sauce with the fresh basil.

I had to improvise on a few things, but this recipe was my inspiration & worked very well.  Used ground turkey Omitted white sauce Added shredded mozzarella cheese to the filling & sprinkled on top.   Delicious!

I like that this has both red and white sauce. I made this for three different families and made the following changes for their preferences:  I left out the spinach; mixed  beef and mild italian sausage, and made one batch with ricotta and one with cottage cheese. Great with antipasto salad.

I followed this recipe with the exception of frozen spinach, I used fresh instead.  It was a huge hit! My 5 year old & 8 year old also gave rave reviews.  Also had some delicious leftovers when we were all finished.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I fixed this last night and it was a huge hit with everyone...even those who don't care for spinach!  I used Italian Blend cheese instead of just Parmesan, and added extra cheese before ladling on the sauces.  I used a large icing bag for filling the shells and it was super fast and easy.

This was good - neither my husband nor myself thought it ranked a *5*, but a good 3 1/2 to 4.  Nice for a change, and will make again, but I think it'll be one of those meals we only have a couple times a year.

This recipe is awesome. I really liked that it had a white sauce and a red sauce. My husband and I had a really hard time with the shells. They kept cracking on us. We had to toss a bunch, glad we bought more than we needed.

This recipe was quite time consuming, but my family liked it.  My only complaint is that the white sauce was way too salty.  Next time I'll try just one T. of bouillon (or even less).  I'll also try using 2% milk instead of the half-and-half.

I made these last night they were time consuming but not hard at all. I made them exactly as the recipe stated, the only changes I made based on other reviewers were that I added some italian seasoning & basil because some people said it was a little bland, I used fresh spinach cause I like fresh better than frozen. I also didn't make the white sauce cause personally I thought it sounded gross with chicken bullioin so I omitted it completley. I used garlic & olive oil pasta sauce so it had some flavor in it & I didn't feel the need to add more basil to the sauce. Then I stuffed & baked them & instead of sprinkling parm cheese on top I used shredded mozzerella instead. They were really good! They were a tiny bit bland so I'm glad I added extra seasoning. I think next time I make these I will definatley use italian sausage for more flavor & add some mozzerella in the filling along with the ricotta cheese. But it was a delish dinner none the less!! I served with spinach salad & my hubby & I both really enjoyed our dinner! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is AMAZING! I doubled the recipe for one batch with spinach and one with out. For the filling, I also added an Italian cheese blend and used half lean ground beef and Italian sausage. The white sauce was a little bland to me with out the bouillon so I added some parm cheese, a little garlic and salt. I also used a basic, homemade marinara. Unbelievably good!

Fairly easy recipe...doesn't call for too many ingredients.  I made it for Christmas dinner with the "World's Best Lasagna" from this site.  Having the two side by side, the store bought spaghetti sauce taste really came out in this recipe.  I'll make it again, but with homemade sauce.

This was delicious and a major hit with the family. Based on earlier reviews, I did make some changes. I used sweet Italian sausage in place of ground beef. I added 1 tbsp parsley and 1 tbsp basil to filling mixture. I used light cream in place of half and half, as I didn't want to risk added sweetness from the half and half (a problem I have had with other recipes). I also added about 1 tsp basil to the white sauce and only 1 tbsp chicken bouillon granules. For the red sauce I used my husband's homemade pasta sauce, which is a meat sauce with ground turkey. Again, my family LOVED this (husband, 2-year-old daughter, 4-year old son, and in-laws). Served with Roasted Garlic Bread from this site (a MUST try), and a simple side salad. Will make again!

This was great. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used dried. Everyone loved it and I also used DianeW Manicotti Shell recipe from this site instead of the boxed. This dish will be made often in our house. Thanks!

Really good!! My only suggestion would be is if you freeze it for future use I'd put the sauce on right before cooking instead of freezing the sauce with the pasta.

I am not much of a cook. My family likes manicotti so I looked up best Manicotti recipes.  This one is time consuming and I didnt have ground beef so I used Hot Italian Sausage and added cottage cheese to the ricotta.  My family said it was better than any restuarant! I agree! So much for not being a good cook.

Filling was SO bland. White sauce was bland as well but I fixed it by adding mozarella cheese to it. It melted beautifully in the sauce and it gave it a lot of flavor and character. I will make again but I'm making the spinach and beef filling my old way.

This was so good. My whole family loved it and my daughter who is so picky even had seconds! Had leftovers and the leftovers are all gone! Will definately make again.

Fantastic. Better than what you'd get at many restaurants. The white sauce makes the dish, don't skip this! My husband raved. Made great leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  Only needs 1/2lb ground beef, not one.  Also, a 9x13 inch dish wasn't big enough for the manicotti I got.  A little messy and time consuming, but well-worth it.  yum!

The recipe was easy and it tasted very good. I would definitely make it with Italian Sausage next time as I found the filling a little dull. I would add some basil and italian seasoning to the beef filling just to give it a bit of jazz..the rest was fantastic.

YUM! This was a very good recipe. I used 4 cloves of garlic and it seemed the perfect amount. I used fresh spinach that I chopped up a bit, it made the mixture drier, but when it cooked, it was fine. I didn't make the white sauce, just used the red sauce I had. I also used italian sausage in it. It was very good and my dad, who doesn't care for italian food at all, LOVED it.

This was fantastic! I made it as written, except I used heavy cream instead of half and half simply because I didn't have any in my kitchen and didn't want to go to the store for just half and half. =) I didn't find the shells hard to fill and it didn't take as long as some of the other reviews. I have kids and used one of their baby spoons to spoon in the filling and it worked wonderfully! Next time I might try using the ziploc baggie to pipe the filling in the shells. . . . there will definitely be a next time!

FANTASTIC!  I split this in two baking dishes - my fiance brought one pan to work and said everyone raved about these!  I did replace the beef and egg with italian sausage, which I think DID improve the recipe, but it defintely wasn't what MADE the dish, so I say it still deserves the five stars!  I also forgot the chicken stock, so I put some parmesan and worcestershire in the white sauce to make it more like an alfredo.  I topped the whole dish off with mozzerela cheese instead of parmesan to get a little more cheese variety in there.  Oh, and just a side note...I made a terrible mess starting out stuffing that pasta, even using the plastic bag trick!  After doing the first couple, I stuck the mixture in the freezer for about three minutes and it firmed right up, helped a ton with the handling. :D

I didn't even use the white sauce, but this was delicious and healthier than the way I usually make stuffed pasta (i.e. very cheesy)

It was very good but I'm still not sold on having the "meat" (I used a meat substitute to make it vegetarian) inside of the shells.  It made it a little soggy.

very good! i made this for mother's day dinner and it was a big hit, everybody loved it. even my dad, who doesn't eat spinach in anthing but salads, thought it was good. i used 16 ounces of manicotti shells instead in case some cracked, turned out to work out perfectly. I saved the cracked shells to put a little sauce and cheese on for lunch sometimes. definately making this again.

This was good... next time I will just put some sausage in with the red sauce rather than stuffing it into manicotti.  Then I will pour the meat sauce over the stuff manicotti and not make the white sauce.  It was tasty, but not worth the extra trouble or calories.

Fabulous.  I couldn't find manicotti, so I used jumbo shells instead.  I could've used a little more sauce, but that was probably due to the pasta change up.  Nice blend of sauces.

Fantastic! I have made this over and over again. I tend to use hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef due to personal taste, but it is great with beef as well. The interplay of the red and white sauces is a lot of fun, and very attractive.

The directions say nothing about adding salt to the dish other than salting the pasta water, which other recipes for pasta call for.  So, I think the criticism of too much salt is not warranted. This was very good but time consuming. The two sauces make it very rich so I would make this only for a party.

Good recipe. It can be touchy however, and if ingredients aren't watched closely it can become too cheesy.  But good and worth making, a keeper.

Very good. I doubled the recipe and put sausage/turkey in half the filling and spinach in the other half to accomodate guests preferences. Used a bit of salt, but not a tablespoon and added italian seasoning. If I make it again, I'll try pasta shells as the manicotti were a little difficult to stuff.

Very good manicotti. Next time, I'll have to use 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb Italian sausage. Also, my manicotti definitely needed more red sauce. I used 3 cups of homemade spaghetti sauce and I think I will use an extra cup to pour on top of the manicotti right before serving.

Complaints of saltiness? No kidding, drop the 1 tablespoon of salt altogether,and you probably only need 1 tsp. of chicken bouillon per cup of liquid for the white sauce. 2000 mg of sodium per serving is ridiculous. Otherwise, this sounds good.

This dish is really amazing!  I used ground turkey instead of the beef.  I also did not have any chicken bouillon granules so I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead.  I ate so much my stomach hurts!  Filling the shells proved to be difficult, but well worth the time.  This was a huge hit!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was pretty easy.  I did end up with a lot of extra "filling" somehow.  I just put it in the baking dish all around the filled noodles.  I think if I make it again, I will add more seasoning of some kind, definitely more garlic, not sure what else.  I felt it was a tad on the bland side.

Punched up the filling flavor by using half ground beef, half sweet Italian sausage, and by adding about a teaspoon each of dried basil and oregano.  It was delicious!

I've now made this many times and it is a favourite of my kids and husband.  I usually use oven ready canneloni tubes instead of manicotti and it tastes amazing.

Restaurant-quality recipe!  I added 2 tsp. each Italian seasonings and basil to the ground beef/spinach/ricotta mixture as well as some coarse black pepper.  I couldn't find manicotti at the grocery store, so I just used jumbo shells which turned out great.  I took this to a dinner and recieved rave reviews, so will make again.

Excellent recipie!  Time consuming, but fun to make.  Makes a lot.  Gave some to a couple of friends whose only complaint was that I didn't give them more.  I also made this with 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of italian sausage which is a must.  Very yummy and will make again.

This was tasty but not worth the extra effort and time it took to make it. I could have made a lasagna in a third of the time and it would have tasted just as good. So Yum, but not making this one again.

I was expecting it to be much better based on the reviews. While not awful, there are far better manicotti recipes out there. The filling needed more flavor, the sauce was ok.

This recipe is awesome and it didn't take nearly as long as the recipe states.  I used jumbo shells and fresh spinach because that's all I had. I just mixed in the fresh spinach with the ricotta (uncooked).  I also sprinkled parm. cheese over the top before baking.  I'll make this for company - it looks really impressive and will feed a lot of people.  Thanks for the recipe - I LOVED IT!

This was great! I used 1/2 of ground beef and 1/2 of sausage. It was somewhat time consuming but it is worth it. Manicotti is my BF favorite and i made it for his birthday. He loved it!

I thought it was good, but I do think the white sauce was an extra step that was not entirely needed.  Next time, I will add some sausage, as some reviewers mentioned, because the filling lacked a little something.

Way tooooo salty!!!  Three times too much at least.  It says 1 tablespoon salt in the filling, plus says to add 1 tablespoon of boullion to the white sauce.  Whew!  Maybe 1 teaspoon salt in the filling and leave out the boullion.

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times as a meal I deliver to others. I make it up and include baking instructions. The recipe was requested every time. I have also froze extra stuffed shells and used a week later, still great. 
The white sauce is a must! Takes time but well worth it.

Great taste.  Received a 4 because of the amount of work it requires.  Changes I made include:
1/2 recipe of the filling = 8 oz. manicotti
I used 1/4 lb. italian sausage and 1/4 lb. ground beef.
I was generous with the spinach.
I cut back on the amount of chicken bouillon used in the white sauce.

I made this for a dinner party recently.  I followed my own recipe for the filling and sauce but used the white sauce and it was delicious.  I didn't buy enough half and half so I had to substitute evaporated milk and a little cornstarch and it still came out wonderfully.

This is an amazing recipe.  I did make some adjustments to enhance the recipe to my liking.  First I used chicken instead of ground beef.  I bought one of those pre cooked chickens from the super market and it had great flavor to begin with and added great texture with the spinach.  I also took the suggestions of others and added some mozzerella cheese into the mixture that you use to stuff the manicotti and saved some to melt over the top.  Definatly a messy recipe, or maybe it was just because it was my first  time, but I will definatly make again!!!

This recipe was great I made half with spinach and half without. I also added a pound on italian sausage to the meat. I added a hand full of mozarella and hanf full of parmesean,romano,etc. chesse mix! I have to admit the white sauce kind of scared me but it was really yummy:) I have a friend that hates alfredo becuase the sauce is similar to that I was afraid she would not like it but it was a hit. My husband hates spinach and loved it. I thought it was a simple recipe with lots of flavor. I will make it again for sure!

WELL!!! As far as recipes go that have not been altered, I would give this a 3 star, but even tweaking with the suggestions from others, it still lacked flavor.  I added all suggested things like italian seasoning, extra cheese like mozza and parm, italian sausage, etc. and STILL!!! Hubby did not like at all, but I still did.  The next day, I added some more parmesan and a mozza and cheddar blend on top, and reheated in the microwave, and it was AWESOME!!!!  Hence the 4 stars.  Will definitely make again, with additions, and let sit for a while to let flavors marry together!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was awesome!!! I made a few changes by omitting the beef, I just wanted a cheese filling.  I added 3 cups of mozzarella, 1/2 cup parmesan, 1 Tbs basil and italian seasonings to the spinach and ricotta cheese.  I also used a whole 26 oz jar of traditional sauce and added even more spices, I felt like 3 cups wasn't enough.  I really liked the white sauce it went together really well!! I also don't like to bake it uncovered at all, I feel like that dries it out a bit.

The recipe is only okay as is - could use the additions that people suggested, such as the extra italian seasonings, cheeses, etc.  This recipe is repeatable, but only with the additional ingredients.

So yummy and worth ur time. I used half beef and half italian mild sausage, but next time I will use spicy sausage and add spices to give it more flavor. This time we fixed it with hot sauce and it was still delicious. I will also double the white sauce (used evaporated milk instead of half and half) and add more spagheti sauce, we like a lot of sauce. Everybd needs to try this rec, it's awesome.

It was good, but lacked flavour.  I will try this again, but will add 1 tsp. each of basil, parsley, oregano, thyme and marjaram to the filling.  I will also cut back on the cheese and up the beef to 1.5 lbs.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe.  It was a hit with the whole family and now they want me to make it every Christmas as well!  I used Bob Evans Italian sausage with the beef and added pesto to the filling.  I also made my own crepes.  I made homemade alfredo sauce with cream, butter, parm and a dash of nutmeg.  This is a keeper!

I've been looking for a good manicotti and spinach recipe, and I've found it! Only thing was I ended up with about twice as much filling than I needed. So I had to spread the rest on top- turned out more like a casserole!

I made this recipe exactly as printed. My husband said this was a manicotti you didn't just munch down, but savored every bite. My guests must have thanked me a 100 times for the great dinner.  I will definitely be keeping this one.

Fantastic recipe!  Warning: this dish takes lots of time to prepare.  I used mild Italian sausage  instead of ground beef and added Italian seasonings...very tasty.

This was delicious!  I made it for a dinner party and my friends raved about it.  It's very filling.  I ended up stuffing the manicotti shells and still have enough to stuff another box of shells.  I didn't have any boullion granules so I did without.  I will go out, buy more shells and some boullion and finish up another batch tomorrow.

I made a lowfat version of this dish with part-skim mozzarella, part-skim ricotta, and even some lowfat cream cheese - probably a little more than 2 cups cheese total.  I also used extra lean ground beef and just pasta sauce, instead of making the white sauce.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only trouble I had was with the manicotti splitting, but I may have not been careful enough!

It was good, my husband asked me to make it again so that's a good sign. I think I'll use spicy italian sausage next time, it felt like it could use some umph. I didn't make the white sauce and added more red but next time I'll try to add the white--probably would be better. Thanks!

This seemed to take forever to make but it was worth it.  I followed the directions and came out extremely tasty.  This one is a keeper.

I loved this dish, it did take a bit of time to make, but not too long. Afer making it, I went back and read reviews, and next time I'll definitely do half italian sausage/ half ground beef as others suggested. As is, the ground beef is quite bland. I also had enough to fill a 9x13 and an 8x8. One reviewer's idea of just splitting the shells in half, filling them then placing them split side down in the pan is something I will follow next time, as stuffing the shells was a pain!

Good...wasn't my favorite but I couldn't figure out what I would change.  I would make it again and somehow figure out how to make it more cheesy!

Made this for a gourmet dinner group and it was SOO good!  We used italian sausage and I would highly recommend it.  We cut back on the amount of garlic thinking it called for too much, but wished we had used the amount asked for.  Have given this recipe out m any times.  Thanks

Great recipe!  I will add a few more spices to the beef stuffing next time.  It was a little bland for me, but I like really spicy food.

Incredible.  Made this for my husband's birthday because we couldn't go out.  He loved it.  We thought the white sauce was a little too salty, so next time I will cut the boullion in half. A very gourmet meal!

This was similar to a recipe my mother has made for years.  While I do think hers is better, this one is much easier.  I was able to make in the afternoon and just pop in the oven for dinner.  I noticed the white sauce tasted heavily of chicken boullion, but other than that, it was fine.  I may make again.

This was WONDERFUL!!!  I did make one change...I'm not big on ricotta so I used 1 1/2 pkgs. of cream cheese (the 8oz size).  This was a winner....I will definately make it again!

This was a very good recipe, however, I did make a few  minor changes to suit my tastes. First, I made the filling with a combination of ricotta and an italian cheese blend. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I added some parmesan to the white sauce to make it more like an Alfredo. I didn't have any boullion granules so I used a small amount of chicken broth. So even though I made all of these changes, I think even if you made it as is it would be good.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I added some parmesan cheese to the spinach and meat mixture and made my own red sauce to pour over the top.  I had to put this into a large lasagna pan though as there was way too much to fit nicely into a 9x13 pan.  I loved this recipe and will definately make this again.

This was pretty good.  I followed others' advice and used half spicy sausage and half ground beef.  I also used  a regular alfredo sauce instead of the white sauce listed her.  I felt like the filling was still missing something, but I'm not sure what.  Overall, pretty good.

Yum, this dish was delish!  Very tasty and filling.  I did change just one thing: I omitted the manicotti pasta for large lasagna slices, which I soaked in cool water for 1 hr.  I placed the spinach, cheese, and beef mix in the centre of the pasta, wrapped like a cannelloni and baked according to recipe.  Like i said delish, and very easy!  My roomate and boyfriend both said it was better then going to a restaurant!

YUMMY!!!  These were wonderful.  Although they did take a long time to make, I was prepared from reading other's reviews.  They were totally worth the time they took to make!!  Even though they took a lot of time, they were fairly simple to make.  I used my hands to stuff the manicotti, which worked great (but a little messy!)  I will definately put this on my list to make again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used beef granules instead of the the chicken because that is all I had.  YUM, YUM!!

Although this did take quite a while to prepare, it tasted, I used fresh spinach, which was good, might try and spice it up a little more next time, maybe some more/other cheeses.

Very good. I used fresh spinach as I can't stand the frozen stuff, added a little more garlic, and I also threw some grated parmesan in to the white sauce. With regards to filling the pasta tubes, I don't understand why anyone would go to the trouble of making/using/dirtying up a piping bag - it is so easy to just use you fingers. Anyway, great recipe. Thanks, Mark!

This recipe was very good, but it tasted more like lasagna to me.  The inside wasn't as cheesy as classic manicotti.  Although it was a lot of work, it was not extremely difficult. A beginner could easily cook this meal. If I made it again, I would only use 1 Tbsp of the chicken bouillon granules.  They made the  white sauce taste too much like chicken.

Very good recipe, but quite a bit of work.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my manicotti shells did still split.  Also, because I was taking this to a birthday dinner, I baked it for 30 minutes, and then when we were ready to eat, I baked it for another 10 (covered), added the parmesean cheese (I added more - 1 1/4 cup), and then baked another 15 minutes until the cheese was crispy and a bit brown.  t was very good!

Added 1 tbsp italian seasoning to the ground beef, 1/2 cup parmasen cheese into the ricotta mixture, and skipped the white sauce.  Needs 1 1/2 jars of sauce, or it is too dry, especially for leftovers.

because i was making this for a playdate/mom's lunch i decided to use Jumbo Shells & used hamburger instead of 1/2 sausage like others recommended. i had enough to fill a 9x13 pan & a 8x8 pan, which was nice. the toddlers loved it & the moms did, too (any meal that gets toddlers to voluntarily eat spinch is great!). in fact, the host kept enough for their family's dinner. this is also wonderful for potlucks and/or if you need to travel with it.

I loved this recipe. I substituted italian sausage for the beef, alfredo sauce for the white sauce and added garlic to the filling. This was my first time making manicotti, and it took a long time, but the results were worth it.

SO good!  I will cut back on the parsley next time.  I am going to buy a pastry bag to make these again.  This time I used a plastic ziploc and cut the corner, but it was still very messy, not a huge trouble to make, just kind of messy, but well worth the effort.

A lot of work...but *so* good.  The individual
components, which I sampled liberally as I 
cooked, had me ready to be disappointed with
the final product.  Wow...they do indeed work
together.  I made it precisely as stated (my 
wife is not big on sausage).

This was fantastic..I used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 italian sausage.  I also used season salt instead of regular salt. My boyfriend said this is the best dinner I have ever made.

As is, we thought this recipe definitely needed something. I see that a lot of people substituted Italian sausage for the ground beef or used a combination of both. If we make this again, I would definitely try that - along with adding more fresh basil, some black pepper, and maybe some mozzarella as well. My husband and I just thought it was too bland as is. We only cooked 8 ounces of manicotti shells, and that was just enough to fill up the 13" x 9" pan. We'll probably give this one another go and will just make some adjustments to suit our taste.

This was wonderful!  I used 1/2 sausage, 1/2 ground beef and the flavors were amazing!  I served at a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  While it was time consuming to put together, it was well worth it.  Will definitely make again!

I used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I also left out the spinach because my husband hates it.  Sprinkle the top with mozzarella along with the parmesan.  Fantastic!  Definately not for your average weekday because of prep time but, when you have the time, make this recipe!

This was good! My friends were very impressed! They ate the entire pan! It does make more than a 9x13, so next time i won't shove as many in the pan so each manicotti can absorb more sauce, it was a little dry inside.  But will experiment with this! thanks

I made this last night with "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" and everyone loved it. It's very easy to prepare. The only part that was time consuming is stuffing the shells. I added about 1Tbls. to the spaghetti sauce because we like the sauce a little sweet. Give this recipe a try! It also makes a beautiful presentation.

This is fantastic!  Definate keeper.  The prep work wasnt too bad either, though I did make a very small batch without the spinach, white sauce, and herbs for the picky kids.  I substituted italian sausage and added a little mozzarella cheese to the filling.  I ended up with leftover filling and just spread it on top of my filled manicotti and under the first layer of sauce, and it definately was overflowing a 9x13 pan.  Dont skip on the fresh basil and parsley, they make a difference and the chicken bouillon really added flavor.  Thank you Mark!  We love this.

This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!  Restaurant quality all the way!  It is very, very rich, so be prepared.  I have made it several times now and sometimes use Jumbo Pasta Shells in place of the manicotti noodles...just makes prep. a little easier.  My husband and kids love this recipe and it is certainly worth the time spent.

This greatly exceeded my expectations.  It was by far the BEST manicotti dish I've ever had.  I followed the directions exactly except for substituting sweet Italian sausage for the ground beef.  I also added a sprinkling of shredded Mozzarella cheese on top of the red sauce.  This makes such an impressive entree.  I can't wait to serve this at the next family gathering.  Mark, you are my hero for submitting this!!!

This was the best Manicotti ever! This reminded me so much of my Grandma Nonni's recipe that has been lost for years. The only thing i did different was that I made the tradional Manicotti pancakes that I found on this site too. This recipe is a keeper :)

This is the BEST! I didn't even have the parsley and it was still so wonderful. I make this all the time now and saute fresh sliced mushrooms and put them on top. Sometimes I add a little grated mozzarella or other white cheese on top.

Great recipe. I did all the prep work and took things step by step.  Takes a little time but well worth it~ I used cottage cheese in the filling instead of ricotta...easy but great change.

Oh my gosh!  This is fabulous and not too complicated for the outstanding result.

I kicked it up a notch by using half beef/half sausage.  I also added diced seasoned tomatoes to my sauce and sprinkled some mozzerella on top with the parmesan.

Thanks SO MUCH for this recipe!

Quick and tasty, with a few changes I made for time constraints.  I did not use ground beef in the filling at all, and did not cook the spinach, just defrosted it and squeezed out excess water.  Mixed that with ricotta, some fresh grated parmesan, motzarella, salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little cajun spice.  Did not parboil manicotti shells - stuffed them straight from package, but added about 1 cup of water to my spaghetti sauce so they would cook while they baked. I skipped the white sauce, but did add extra motzarella on top, before covering & sealing tightly with foil. Great!

This recipe is fabulous!!!  It reminded me of the restaurants we would go to in Brooklyn.  Alot of work but well worth it - easily adaptable for using ground turkey or making it vegetarian using zucchini and peppers in addition to the spinach.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe for a family supper and it was relly good. My family couldn't believe that I had made this myself!

Next time I make this, I will use more of both sauces.  It seemed a little dry as the manicotti soaked up the moisture.  Overall a good recipe.

My kids just loved it!!  Used canneloni noodles instead.  Took awhile to prepare it but will definately make it again.  Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese.

Great recipe - I substituted ham for the ground beef and my family loved it. It is some work to prepare, but it is well woth the effort.

This was a good recipe, but mine ended up with so much sauce that all of the manicotti really blended together and it ended up tasting more like lasagna. . . . which isn't bad, but this took a lot more effort than lasagna.  If I make this again, I think I'll try Italian sausage rather than ground beef.

I've wanted to make manicotti for years but didn't have a recipe.  I made this and my husband and oldest son loved it my husband went back for thirds later in the night. I was impressed.
Thanks Drea

This was a wonderful recipe, I will definately make it again!  The white sauce really makes a difference.
