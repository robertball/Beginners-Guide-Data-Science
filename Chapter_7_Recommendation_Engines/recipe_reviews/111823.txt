My family loved this.  I only used half of onion, added 1 tsp of ground mustard, used 1 cup half/half - 1 cup milk.  Used 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs mixed with melted butter for the topping.  Adding the Kielbasa makes this very filling, added a salad and that was dinner.  Only 3 of us and had enough leftovers for the next night.  Will be making again.  Thanks

I followed this recipe to a T. However I had mixed reviews from everyone at the table. Hubby liked it, my kids were harder to please on this dish...but the one thing they agreed on was they didn't care for the bread crumbs. Maybe use a lot less then a whole cup. And maybe Panko bread crumbs. The bread crumbs could have soaked up too much of the creamyness to this dish. 1/2 cup or less probably would have been fine. And the kids didn't care for the kielbosa in it either...which I found to be strange because they love kielbosa. I thought it had a nice flavor overall, but agreed to much bread crumbs. If the kielbosa would have been left out I feel they would have enjoyed it better. One child, who will eat almost anything, said it tasted funny and doesn't want me to make it again...Hubby wants it again. So this review on rating it has been very difficult. I will say I'll attempt it again, with some different modifications, to see if it suits everyone.

I tend to make this a bit differently from my sister... extra cheese, less onion, and crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs.  But it's a great base recipe!

My family loved this.  I've made it twice. My changes/suggestions would be to make sure you cook the onion long enough so its not too strong.  I even use part whole wheat flour part unbleached.  I also used 1/2 the breadcrumbs and substituted panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.

I used a package of little smokies instead of kielbasa.  Also added some cheeze whiz and shredded cheddar cheese, istead of the cubed to the rest of ingredients.  Forget the bread crumbs  A dash of lea and perrins, soy sauce, a few chopped green onions, mushrooms...optinal...the more cheese the better....this was great

Wonderful! I am very picky about my Mac 'n cheese and this was great!  My kids panicked about the kielbasa at first, but they liked it once they tasted it! I did use a blend of sharp and mild cheddar cheeses to tame the flavor for us. The only change I will make for next time is to use about 1/2 of the bread crumbs.  They were way to thick for our taste.

My whole family liked this one but I think I would use about 1/2 the onion next time rather than the whole thing. Also i shredded the cheese rather than cubing it because I find that it melts into the roux easier and more smoothly.

This was ok but wasn't very cheesy and I added extra cheese to it. Next time I will add a cheese like velveeta to help make it creamier and cheesier.

I loved this recipie. I have tried to make homemade mac and cheese before and it turned out clumpy. It may have been user error, but for some reason, this one worked for me. The only thing I did different was I added a little bit of Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning after I had the cheese sauce all melted. Even the child that we call the pickatarian loved this. :)

This was ok..I was expecting more rich cheese flavor..Instead of cubed cheese, I would use shredded..The cubes make the prep time way too long..Otherwise, it's just ok.

I made a similar recipe.  Left out the onion, used a dab of onion seasoning.  Replaced kielbasa sausage with Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage.  Cooked in pan with a little bit of 1/8 cup red wine vinagarette, top full of worsteshiere sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup.  Mix bread crumbs with butter and water for 1 minute before spreading over top layer of dish and baking.  Mix sharp cheddar with mozzerela for a stringy, soft cheese mixture.  Rave reviews all around the table.

Really good base recipe! I always make mac and cheese with peas and needed a good cheese sauce to use. This one was great. We left out the sausage and added peas. Really yummy!

Very good once we scraped off excess bread crumbs.  We also added raw broccoli which cooked well in the oven.  Next time I'll use a LOT less bread crumbs and cook in a dish deeper and narrower than 9x13 to give more of the creamy mac n cheese.

I used what I had available in the house but I veered very little from the recipe.  I used penne pasta and instead of keilbasa, I used Hillshire Farms mini turkey smokies cut in half.  For the topping I used Italian panko breadcrumbs mixed with a little olive oil and parmesan cheese.  Very tasty!

In my opinion, it was terrible. This doesn't happen too often in my experiences at Allrecipes.com. I followed the recipe exactly and everything about it was wrong, I wouldn't even call this mac and cheese. Just a cheap quick sauce with some cheddar thrown in, no flavor whatsoever. I even used real sharp cheddar in block form that I shredded myself (the expensive kind.) Kielbasa deserves better. Won't be making again

Did this without the kielbasa, just the macaroni part. Was quite surprised with how tasty it was, for being quite a simple recipe. I added some crumbled bacon on the top with the bread crumbs, couldn't stop eating it!

After a morning of wakeboarding, my college son and his friends demolished the pan. When I asked if it could have been any better, the answer was "only if you had made more." Only change, no meat - as none in the house, did half milk - half evap milk, added dry mustard to cheese sauce, and topped with sauteed green onions, tomatoes, and Italian breadcrumbs. Definately a keeper, may make for 50 college students Sunday nite.

This was really good, but i agree with some of the other reviews when they said its not creamy enough. the cheese sauce is good yes, but it needs heavy cream to make it creamier. i will make it again and add a little more cheese and heavy cream along with 1 cup of milk as mentioned. My husband loved this to and does not like mac and cheese, well he never tried it homemade!

I had a craving for home made mac n cheese and I just happened to have a package of kielbasa in the fridge.  This was easy to make and tasted wonderful!!  The whole family loved it and it was even better as leftovers the next day.

I had a little trouble getting the flour/milk/butter mixture to thicken in the time stated on the recipe, but it ended up working out. My only real beef with this recipe was the dry bread crumbs on top.  I think they needed to be mixed with some kind of fat - whether cheese or butter.  Plain dry bread crumbs on top resulted in a dry and sandy texture on top rather than that crunch I was looking forward to.

Huge hit! Doubled recipe. I used 8 Tbs butter, sauteed onions, added double flour and milk. Added 2/3 block of 3lb cheddar cheese cubed and 4 oz velveta, stir till melted and the rest being same. For topping I used almost 1/2 bag Pepridge Farms herb bread crumb stuffing mixed with 1 stick melted butter. Spread on top. Baked 25 min at 350 then let it sit out of oven for 15 minutes. Excellent recipe. I never made homemade Mac and cheese before.
*********************
OK, so I have made this about 4 more times since above review.  Each time I make it everyone says it is even better than last time.  Once leftovers are gone (it makes more than 4 people can eat---2 servings each--at once) by a day or two later I am wondering if it's too soon to cook it again.  It is awesome.  This time I cooked mixture longer over higher heat, constantly stirring and I feel like it was even thicker.  Haven't added kielbasa each time because I havent' had it on hand.  LOVE this recipe. Over and out.

I changed some things in mine to fit my Nana's recipe. We use the process of double boiling the cheese mixture and it turns out creamy and smooth but cooking on low heat in a pan did just fine and had less cleanup.   We use velveeta for the cheese, no onion and cook the kielbasa with the macaroni which adds flavor. Instead of using bread crumbs we use crushed crackers and mix it with melted butter.  This recipe is the closest one I've found to my Nana's. She goes by eye and skill which I lack. So putting numbers and quantities to the ingredients really helped me out!

This turned out very good, after reading the reviews I changed a few things based on input to my preference by using Turkey Kielbasa (which is just baked with it vs pan warming it), diced an onion, broccoli, ground mustard, onion powder, garlic powder,ground pepper and about 4 oz of Velveeta, along with a package of grated sharp cheddar,and when making the sauce I also used 1 can of evap milk and the balance 2% milk. The Topping was 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs and the cooking time was perfect.

Over all this was a pretty solid recipe.  Made some adjustments (more cheese) and came out pretty good!

I found this recipe very bland. When I reheated it, I added a bit more cheese...so at least it was cheesier. My 2 year old loved it....but it definitely could have used more punch.

Wonderful!  My son asked for mac and cheese for our Christmas dinner.  I wanted to do something special so I though we would try this.  I did delete the onions as some mentioned since he hates onions.  I also only used enough bread crumbs to cover the top of the casserole - probably less than a 1/4 cup.  Definitely will make again!

This is delicious! I added chopped red pepper and fresh rosemary from my garden to the onions that I cooked in the butter. I used white american cheese instead of cheddar cheese because of preference. I also used crushed butter flavored crackers for the top. Again for preference. My daughter helped me make this too. Great recipe. I plan on making it again. Thanks.

Yum! I didn't add the bread crumbs to the top because I already know that my kids won't eat it that way. I also only added half of an onion, minced really well. This was a good basic mac and cheese recipe.

I'm giving this a 5 to be fair since I changed it right from the first time. I was in need of just a macaroni and cheese recipe (without the meat) and this I thought this one would be just as good even without the meat! Anyways, my changes are that I never do put it in the oven. We eat it straight from the stove top, just like boxed mac and cheese. I do not use the onion because my kids and I wouldn't eat it that way. I DO use onion powder though. I just don't want any other textures in my mac and cheese and either do the kids. I also add 1 1/4 tsp ground mustard. This is an awesome recipe and I'm sorry I tweaked it right from the get-go. I really KNOW it would be fabulous with the kielbasa and I do want to try that some time.

super good!  Following several of the reviewers suggestions, I only used about 1/2 an onion, I warmed the milk before adding it to the roux and I added about 3 oz. of Velveeta.  Husband says it is great!

Delish! I am Italian and consider myself a pretty good cook - but my grandmother's recipe takes forever. This recipe saved the day. I made a huge dish for my New Years party - I also added some shredded Asiago cheese into it and a little Swiss. Fabulous!

Yum! I used about 1/4 of an onion, added 1 tsp. mustard powder to the cheese sauce, and did half & half bread crumbs/panko breading (about 3/4 cup total). I have never made homemade mac & cheese before, and I have to say, this one was pretty easy. It came out perfect, very tasty.... I really like the kielbasa flavor as well. Just reheated another portion in the microwave and it's just as good as it was right out of the oven, no texture issues at all. MMMMMM!

OMG - sooooo good!  I used evaporated milk to make it creamier and threw in some cubed ham - will probably decrease the onion next time, as it was a bit too much for us.

Really good!  I followed another review and used bacon instead of the sausage.  I used shredded cheese instead of the cubed cheese.  It had a slightly grainy texture after it sat in the pan for awhile...but the next day for leftovers, I mixed it with a little milk and it perked right back up!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this recipe for my friends. They both loved it, but I would make a few changes if I made it again. The cheese wasn't as rich and creamy as I had hoped. I used about 1/3 onion instead of a whole one and I don't care for bread crumbs so I left them out of the recipe and just used extra cheese on top to melt. Overall ok, but on the bland side. Thanks!

I've wanted to try making homemade macaroni and cheese for a while now, but for most recipes, I'd have to spend an arm and a leg just on cheese! Not so with this recipe! When I saw that it included kielbasa sausage, I had to try it. It was fantastic! I left out the onions because I don't like them and I used too much of the bread crumbs for the pan I was using (my fault) as it was a deep casserole dish instead of a 9 x 13 pan. The layer was too thick on the top for me, but I'll know better next time! Also, I only used 2/3 c. of bread crumbs, then 1/3 c. of parmesan cheese because of other reviews I'd read. This was cheesy and delicious! I printed out the recipe and will be making again...and again...and again!  The only suggestion I have is to make the cheese mix, keep it on very low heat, and then make the macaroni. My macaroni was done way before the sauce, and I had to add butter to it so it wouldn't stick together.

One of the best mac and cheeses I've ever made! Apart from using a little more cheese, and also adding some hot English mustard to the cheese sauce, I pretty much made it as written. Very rich and tasty. Thanks!

This turned out great and was easy to make. I dint add the sausage, just wanted the mac n cheese recipe. I also cut down on the bread craumbs and will use Panko next time (1/3 cup) and I used the Kraft cheese blend made for melting (pre shredded) plus I added shredded Parm. & 1/2 tsp dry mustard. Shredded is easier to use than cubed.

I made this last night and it was ok, edible, but nothing to go crazy over.  I didn't have diced cheese so I used 2 cups shredded cheese-otherwise, followed exact recipe.  I used the small onion and it seemed a bit overpowering--and I like onion flavor.  Aside from the onion flavor, I felt it was a bit bland.  I did not add extra salt, just salted the water for pasta as some sausages/kielbasa's are a bit salty to begin with.  I should have listened to others and not used the onion.  I might try this again, but not going to make it a staple meal in our home.

This was super yummy but here are a few things I did differently. I am a mom, work and go to school, so speed is the name of the game. While some things I do believe need to take time, I think some processes here can be sped up. So 1. I made sure to use the smallest onion I had after reading reviews. 2. I cooked my pasta al dente so it wouldn't need 20 minute bake time @350. 3. After incorporating over low heat, I brought temp up to a med-med high and added the pasta/kielbasa mix, salt and peppered, got up to hot temp. And finally 4. I topped with bread crumbs (I did not measure, I just dusted as there were complaints of the bread crumbs soaking up too much of the sauce) and then broiled it until brown and crispy. I think the broil function is a vastly underused feature. Viola. We all loved it, hubby was mad there wasn't more left when he got home from work :)

Everyone in the house liked this recipe.  I'll probably change two things about it next time I make it.  Maybe add some more milk because it was a little thick and leave out the bread crumbs because I didn't really care for them.  Otherwise the recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was just okay. 
I followed it to the T, except for adding chicken kielbasa rather, than pork
I tried it again. Cut the onion down to a 1/4th. I love onion but the original had way too much. Added a little cayenne pepper, and mixed up the cheeses a little bit. 1/3 chedder, 1/3 fresh parmesan, and 1/3 swiss. I also left out the kielbasa, entirely. 
This was VERY good!

This recipe was tasty and perfect for a mac and cheese craving from a very anti "cheese powder" or "cheese food" cook.  I omitted the sausage only because I am not a big meat eater and shredded the cheese from a fresh block I picked up at the farmers market.  Also- I used whole wheat pasta and it was just as tasty as the white stuff.  One tip my husband gave me was to warm the milk before adding it to the butter/flour and this seemed to help make it smooth and easy to mix.  I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, just eyeballed what looked to be a good amount for my taste across the top and that worked perfectly.  Craving kicked!

I love this!

I have made it twice now and it's so delicious every time. Only make sure you work in the flour good, because once I think I didn't integrate it well enough and the cheese mixture tasted just a bit "floury".  

Oh... and it takes a bit of time! More than 20 minutes for me at least.  But worth it!

This is my go-to recipe for baked mac and cheese. I make it plain sometimes, and other times I add smoked sausage (that's what's in the oven right now). I use a combo of cheeses, too. Colby jack and cheddar is good. I did use a whole box of macaroni (this one was a little over 14 oz).

I douubled all the ingredients, and used 2 8 oz. bags of shredded Cheddar cheese, instead of cubed. VERY tasty! Kielbasa and mac 'n cheese go very well together. Doubling the recipe filled up my 9 x 13 lasagna dish, and I had plenty of leftovers (which, by the way, tasted great both hot AND cold the next day). And, don't skimp on the Panko breadcrumbs! Sprinkle them on heavily, and bake until they turn a dark golden brown. They add alot to this dish!

This is delicious!!  I've made this several times now and took it to a luncheon where the women all raved about it and went for seconds (something I've never seen them do!)  I will admit I was a bit leary of actually putting in the kielbasa, but now that I've tried it my husband won't have it any other way.  I use the regular polka kielbasa, and I also use half an onion, and 2 bags of shredded cheese----one is sharp and one mild.  My family prefers it w/out the bread crumbs.  This dish is a keeper!  It's a part of my normal rotation now...and this comes from someone who always hated homeade mac n cheese.

Good stuff! Thanks for the recipe! A couple reviews said it could be cheesier, so I used 12 oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese, but really it was more because I didn't want to store 2 oz of cheese. It was plenty cheesy.

Good base recipe. Used leftover rotisserie chicken in place of sausage and added broccoli. Per other reviewers added some garlic.  Used crushed up Ritz crackers on top in place of bread crumbs.  Could have used a bit more sauce/liquid (will do that next time).  My 2 yr old loved it!

Very tasty.  I did use crushed nacho cheese Doritos instead of bread crumbs, this adds a new dimension of flavor!

This was really fantastic. I made it with the recipe right on the counter next to me and now the proof of use is in cheese sauce splattered on it!  We were having our protein separate, so I did not add the kielbalsa and I used what cheeses I had- it is easy, cheesy and the pasta does not dry out! Yum! (There was none left over! )

Glittergirl.. I made this again tonight and followed your recipe to a T. It was wonderful.. so good. I have my own struggles with the roux but it has nothing to do with your dish. Its me being a ding dong. Thank you for this recipe.. we'll be making this often in the future.

Yum! I added an egg while I mixed in the cheese to give it an egg-y flavor. I thought it was going to be a disaster, because my roux looked awful, but everything turned out yummy. Definitely will be making again!

This is the first time that I have actually made home made macaroni instead of the typical mac and cheese out of the box. I absolutely loved it. I used little smokey sausages and added extra cheese my son loved it. Thank you.

Excellent dish, simple and delicious. I skipped the kielbasa, and based on other reviews I also cut on the bread crumbs a bit. I found the sauce to be creamy and cheesy (no heavy cream needed, to others that found the sauce not to be creamy enough perhaps the flour/milk/butter/onion mixture was undercooked). I just made this a second time and it turned just as perfect as before!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of using onion i chopped up some fresh garlic.  Also I used some Italian seasoning and some chili powder after I mixed in the cheese. I am glad I did otherwise it would have been a little bland. Overall it is a great recipe and is quite easy to make!

We liked this quite a lot.  I made a few changes, cooking the onion with 2 cloves of garlic and adding 2 teas of mustard powder and a Tb dried chives (and freshly ground pepper) to the cheese mix while cooking.  I also used a small package of gouda along with the cheddar.    I also mixed 3/4 cup crushed Ritz crackers with 1-2 Tb butter and some more dried chives and sprinkled the top with this before baking.

This recipe is the ultimate comfort food. Loved it! I have made it with and without cubed Black Forest ham and it is wonderful. I am going to try it with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving too :) The only change I would make for my family is to make a larger casserole!

I made this recipe with my 6 and 9 year old grandchildren. We all loved the recipe. The only the we did differently was mix Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs together and sprinkled on before baking. I felt too much breadcrumbs would weigh down the meal.

I make this with Barilla Veggie elbow macaroni to throw in a serving of hidden veggies. This is a kid and adult frienly recipe that I go to often. I usally make it ahead of time and just pop it in the oven on a busy night.

My family LOVED it! However, when I was making the cheese sauce, it didn't taste very cheesy to me (I LOVE cheese). I kept adding cheese and when it was done, I ended up using close to a pound of cheese! Oh, and  I added 4 oz of cream cheese for creaminess! Yummy yummy! I will be making this as my side at my husbands family Thanksgiving gathering.

Changes I made were: substituting cooked cubed ham, added a dash of worsteshire and a pinch of nutmeg, a splash of mustard and sprinkled with small amount of Panko crumbs. Great recipe base from which you can do what you want with. Served with a side of peas. My granddaughters, ages 5 and 7 had seconds and loved it!

I made this recipe, but with turkey kielbasa and fat free cheese, added a teaspoon of dry mustard. I feel like the kielbasa over powers it a bit, maybe dice the kielbasa instead, next time. Also it was a decent flavor, but something was missing. I'm not quite sure what.

I made this for my vegetarian teen-age daughter and she actually said "this is good".  I substituted Tofurkey kielbasa for the meat and used half sharp cheddar and half american cheese.  My husband liked it too.  Very cheesy comfort food.

Made this for my kids. Made a double batch by adding more butter and milk to the roux. Used crushed saltines as I was out of breadcrumbs. The onion really flavored the roux nicely over other recipes I have made without them. I will be making this again!

This was pretty good but could stand to be kicked up just a notch – maybe some paprika or ground mustard.  I personally didn’t care for the sausage but my kids like it so I added it.  I used extra sharp cheddar cheese which was very good in this recipe.  The only change I made was to add French fried onions on the top five minutes before removing from oven instead of the bread crumbs.  My family really enjoyed this and asked that it be added to our rotation.

I wanted to make this with the kielbasa, but a day before I was going to make it my 2 year old said she didn't like hotdogs mixed into her mac n cheese so I made it sans kielbasa.  It was super yummy!  All my family raved about it.  I did make some alterations, I was going to double the recipe but forgot to double the cheese sauce and was running out of time so I just added about 2 cups plain shredded cheese, which definitely made it greasy but it was still good.  Next time I will make it with more cheese sauce if I double.  My 9 year old thought it was really good before I added the extra shredded cheese before baking when she tasted it.  I thought the onion gave it a nice almost smokey flavor.  I skipped the bread crumbs b/c my 2 year old is a mac n cheese purist.  Very solid recipe.

I just gave this 4 stars because I needed to add a bit of mustard to get a little more zip in the cheese sauce, other than that it is great. I love the kolbasa in it, my boyfriend had mentioned putting bacon in it, I may try that next to compare. I put crushed crispy onions  on top and it came out of the oven with the perfect crust on the top. Very quick and easy to make. I will be making this again.

We love this recipe!  My husband isn't a mac & cheese kind of guy, and when I served this up for dinner one night he was hooked.  The kids enjoy it as well very much.  It's become a regular for us!

I ADORE this recipe! It is so yummy and easy. I used 10 oz of Cabot Extra Sharp NY Cheddar b/c I'm lactose intolerant and I did not add any salt but I did put fresh grated black pepper. I will definitely make this again, next time I will try with some chipotle peppers/sauce. THANK YOU

This was really good! My whole family enjoyed it. I used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 colby jack, and used panko bread crumbs instead of regular. I'll definitely make this again!

Very well received at the party I made it for. Did make a few changes—used bacon instead of kielbasa, rotini instead of elbow macaroni, and prob only about 1/3 as much bread crumbs. The bacon turned out really well and the rotini held a lot of sauce. Yum.

I have to give this 4 stars because I made several improvements to make this turn out 5 star-fantastic!  First, 1 oz of elbows per person just wasn't going to cut it.  As a rule, I use 2 oz per pasta per person for main dishes.  I used shallot instead of onion, used less butter because my kielbasa cooked out quite a bit of grease, and made several additions along with the cheese: I almost doubled the cheese, which I grated, I used garlic salt for the salt, white pepper for the pepper, added a squirt of Dijon mustard and just a little extra milk since it got thick with the extra cheese.  I did use the full amount of bread crumbs, but I mixed them with a little melted butter first and it came out just great.  The end result was very good.  Hubby gave it 5 stars, noting the smokyness of the kielbasa compliments the tang of the sharp cheddar well!  I won't be making this all the time (I love meatless M&C way too much), but next time I have some kielbasa to use up I will surely consider this recipe again!!!  Thanks glittergirl and Auntie Cheese!

for the fact my VERY picky child ate this with a smile it automatically gets 5 stars. The only adjustment I made was reducing the onion amount to appx 1/4 a cup and I added 2 cloves minced garlic.

This was OK, but I found it to be kind of oily, probably from the sausage and also the block of cheese. Also, if I make this again one change I will make is to use onion powder rather than chopped onion. I found the texture to interfere with the creaminess that I want in mac & cheese.

This was just okay for us.  I followed the recipe exactly - couldn't get the cheese to melt without being lumpy and stringy.  The flavor was okay, but I probably won't put the work in to make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight but had a few changes.  I cut down the butter a bit..seemed like a lot of butter.  Also, added fresh minced garlic with the onions.  Then, added dry mustard with the s and p.  I did not have sausage so substituted bacon and had sharp cheddar, fontina and Jack cheese on hand so used them all.  Made my own bread crumbs but did not use a cup, I think a cup would have been way to much.

Very tasty. A classic mac and cheese that is creamy, not dried out. I will use less onion next time and maybe add some garlic instead.

This was DELICIOUS!  My nickname is also Cheese, so I just had to try this recipe when looking for the perfect homemade mac & cheese.  I used hot dogs and didn't use a full pound because I didn't want to be overwhelmed.  It was the perfect ratio.  I substituted panko for bread crumbs and didn't measure it out, only sprinkled it over the top with some parmesan cheese.  Also, only used 1/2 an onion and it was the perfect amount of flavor.  I'm thinking of adding a little bit of garlic and peas the next time.

A cooking note - when I was whisking in the flour & milk, I had to turn the burner up to at least medium because my pan is really thick aluminum and it was not getting up to a simmer.  

I can't wait to make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

A bit bland but if you add a touch of garlic it's great. Also since my wife won't eat keilbasa I added a pound of hamburger. Made for a good meal. Thank you!

At the time I had to use cooked hot dogs instead of kielbasa sausage. I added two cloves of garlic (minced) and just cooked it in with the onion (used only 1/4 onion). Also I shredded the cheese, not cubed. My boyfriend LOVED it though. It's hard for me to impress him considering he and his parents are all cooks! Lol

Yummy!  I did make some changes:  I didn't have kielbasa, so I used some diced bacon from a package of bacon ends-n-pieces.  Also, I had some cream cheese left over (about 3 oz.) that I added to the cheese sauce.  I used part seasoned dry bread crumbs and part crushed crackers.  I didn't measure the crumbs/crackers, just added until I liked the look.

I have to give this recipe the max rating because it has allowed me to create my own version, and go to recipe for mac n' cheese. I used shells instead of elbow macaroni. I also did not add onion, and put a little more variety in for cheese. Broccoli added is amazing! I just used raw and added into the mix when it was ready for the oven. Bread crumbs sprinkled on top like suggested, gave it a texture. A

This was an amazing dish! My sister in law and I made it for an impromptu dinner party. We made it with Chicken sausage instead of kielbasa and sweet onion instead of a normal one and it was delicious! We also added a package of the powdered cheese from the boxed mac and cheese in addition to the normal cheese! It was wonderful and filling. We fed 4 men and ourselves with a little bit leftover. My fiance loves cheese and he was raving about it. Definitively going to make this again.

Just what I needed for supper tonight! We're huge cheese lovers, so I used about 16 oz of shredded cheddar & jack cheeses.
Also, for the bread crumbs, I always make my own by lightly toasting a few slices of bread and buttering them on both sides, before crumbling atop the macaroni. Some other users might want to try that, if they don't like the dry bread crumbs.
Additionally, this can be made with whole wheat flour, instead of white flour, if desired. We tried it that way and it still tasted great.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I did not have kielbasa, and after reading the reviews, I was not sure if there would be enough cheese sauce for all of the items with the kielbasa.  I made the recipe mostly as is, except I added four bacon slices (diced) and a little parsley.  The macaroni was so cheesy, as there was plenty of sauce minus the kielbasa.  And, I did not add a full cup of bread crumbs.  I thought it would be too much.  Instead, I added crumbs from 4 Ritz crackers.  Great recipe.  I may try the kielbasa in the future if I increase the cheese mixture too.     ***I made it a second time with kielbasa, and whoa!!  What a difference, it was delicious.  I increased the sauce by 50% to make sure that there would be plenty of sauce with the sausage.  It was perfect.

Easy recipe, but has a strange taste from the onions. The first time I made this my family refused to eat it.  I followed the recipe exactly except the kielbasa.
Just made it for a second time and drastically reduced the onion and used extra sharp cheese shredded with a bit more than called for from some leftovers in the fridge.
MUCH better! (I also left the breadcrumbs off this time and would have used Ritz crackers if I had any)

This recipe made the perfect roux. In lieu of using sausage, I had cooked a ham the night before which I diced and added. I also did not have sharp cheddar on hand (this was a last minute meal) so I used 4 oz Monterrey cheddar and 4 oz of Colby Jack and 2 American cheese slices (told you it was last minute). I can't tell you how unbelievably good the cheese sauce was. I also used Panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. Excellent basic recipe and easy to finagle based on what was in my pantry/fridge!

I've made this recipe half a dozen times now. I like to substitute half a cup of sour cream for half a cup of the milk, add tomato slices and broccoli, and I've used Canadian bacon, crispy cooked bacon and bulk Italian sausage crumbles instead of the sausage called for. And I grate the cheese instead of cubing it. It always turns out fantastic. This is the only baked mac and cheese I've made that spooned out of the dish with gooey, creamy sauce instead of being custardy.  The texture is great. It reheats wonderfully, which is often a big hurdle for homemade mac and cheese. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it tends to need extra salt or seasonings in the cheese sauce, and because, cubed cheese? what? that's just strange. I don't know how anybody can say it's not cheesy, it has a ridiculous amount of cheese in it and a lot of cheese flavor. Maybe the issue is a low quality cheese?

Definately agree, skip the onions and add at least twice the cheese. I also used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c flour. Awesome casserole.

Okay, kids thought it had to much onion.I really enjoyed it. I agree with the other reviews about to much bread crumbs. I think next time I will omit it and just put shredded cheese on top. I also used shredded cheese instead of cubed. Much easier.

I think this is a GREAT base recipie.   I have made in a few times now... the first time I made it as stated and it was pretty good... but then I tweaked it and it was great (per our liking :) of course).  

So I am giving it a 4 star for as is. 

For the 5th star I made the following tweaks - and they really are minor. 

1)  In the Rue I add a tsp ground mustard.  

2) I use 2 bricks of the cheese.... 1.5 go into the rue for the cheese sauce.   The other half I sprinkle over the top once I put the noodle mixture into the baking dish and before I top with the crumbs.  

3) For crumbs I got the the old tried and true Ritz crackers .  

Great recipe  - we are adding it to the rotation :)  Thank you for Sharing!

I’ve been making my own version of this recipe ever since I found it almost 10 years ago. I don’t putnin kielbasa all the time, but sometimes I do. I add more cheese, and use different types dependent on my mood. I also use ditalini pasta onsitwad of elbows. Everyone who’s tried it says it’s the best Mac they’ve ever had and they force me to bring it to all the parties/gatherings/etc. Truly a gem of a base recipe that has been incorporated into a now long-standing family recipe.

Pay attention to the listed units.  It calls for one 8 ounce package of elbows.  The standard size for a package of elbows is 1 lb (16 ounces).  If you just dump a whole box in the pot, you will be wondering why you don’t have enough cheese sauce!

I have made this recipe multiple times. It is a homerun every single time. I changed it a smidge for my taste (I add minced garlic in while sauteing onion and butter and I usually add more meat) but I stick pretty close to the original recipe.  It's delicious and I recommend this to anyone who asks me how I make it. It's A-maz-ing!! 8,000 stars!!!

this mac and cheese was good. However next time I won't put onions in it.  I think that takes away the creamy texture. And the kids don't like onions.   I added bacon pieces instead and it was good.  I could also see putting hot dogs in it. I never know how much to make.  There are only 3 of us, so I cut back on the amount.  I think about 1 full cup of dry macaroni is enough for us  with some leftovers.

I usually make recipes exactly how they are written, however, for this one I uses crushed Ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs.   I followed the rest of it exactly though.  Loved it!  Husband and daughter want it again!

Simple to make! I made a few changes to the recipe listed- I omitted one of the cups of milk and used half & half instead. I added 2-3 oz. Shredded Parmesan Cheese, 2-3 oz. Velveeta Cheese, and for the topper- buttered corn flakes. I also used smoked turkey sausage instead of Kielbasa.

The mac and cheese portion of the meal I thought was ok.  I like kielbasa, so that was an added plus.  Overall, it's a pretty good dish, but I like some added flavor.  I thought it was rather plain that's why I didn't give it a full 5 stars.

Excellent! My whole family loved it. Their only complaint was that I hadn’t doubled the recipe so they could have leftovers the next day. I used Panko breadcrumbs mixed with a bit of olive oil for the top and that worked great. And I only used 8oz of shredded sharp cheddar because I was too lazy to cut up a stick of cheese, but other than that I followed the directions as written.

Ok first of all I absolutely HATE kielbasa, it's horrendous! I didn't even dare putting it in this dish, second, this is just a very plain Jane Mac and cheese, nothing special, I made it because it had almost a 5 star rating, but was very disappointed when it was finished, however, I'll be uploading my own Mac and cheese recipe sometime soon, that has a LOT more flavor, uses 3 types of delicious cheeses, and best part, NO KIELBASA. Keep an eye out for it!!

This was very good but as a disclaimer I make it with sage spiced sausage rather than kielbasa as the recipe specifies. Next time I'll use kielbasa as I think would add a little more flavour.  It makes a generous sized casserole too.

I used Tofurkey Kielbasa for this recipe and it was delicious!

Like other reviewers, I only added half a small onion, and I let it cook in the butter for longer than 5 minutes. I also added a little bit of garlic powder with the onions before the flour.

I used a little bit more than 8oz of elbow macaroni, and piled the mac n cheese into a 6X13 pan to change the crispy to gooey ratio. I also, like others, only added about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs which I also dusted with Parmesan cheese. This was a big hit at the mac n cheese party I brought it to and I'll definitely make it again! Maybe with spicy Chipotle sausages and adobo peppers.

I made this the other night. I used some left over ham instead of Kiebasa sausage.  I had shredded Mexican cheese and mild cheddar on hand and used that.  The baked mac and cheese was very good. We liked the creamy but not too creamy texture. My family enjoyed it.

Our family did not care for it. Followed the recipe; not creamy or "cheesy. I agree with others the bread crumbs were way too much. Honestly, I would use my homemade macaroni and cheese recipe and add kielbasa.

I just needed the butter/flour/milk measurements and directions. I didn't use onion or bread crumbs but I wish I had the kielbasa. My mother used to use American cheese ends from the deli so I did too - I had 0.75 lb. I didnt add salt or pepper either, but it was just perfect for us. Thanks so much for supplying the missing parts for me! Now I'm going back for seconds...yum

The absolute best way to cook sausage  is to slice in 2 inch pieces and place in a pressure cooker with 3 cups of water. Cook about 25 minutes, when cool, remove the lid and drain all the fat . It's amazing how tender and lean the sausage becomes.  After that use in your favorite recipes.

made this a couple times and each time I make it even better. I use the same recipe however I use a almost half of the breadcrumbs and 1 cup (or more) cheese. I use marble cheese. Also just as a zip I add Banana peppers. 

This is a great meal!!

I used shredded cheese.    I thought it had too many bread crumbs.  Adding butter to the bread crumbs might have helped, since they were really dry.  Or maybe mixing them into the dish  a little.  My husband loved this dish, even without the kielbasa.  I liked it leftover, microwaved with some milk added.

We tried this tonight and we really liked it except for the 16 year old boy. lol Honestly I'm not sure why he didn't unless it was the bread crumbs. We only used half a cup and it still seemed like too much. Next time I'll probably only put 1/4 cup on it. Aside from that we followed the recipe and liked it enough I'm certain we'll have it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't change the dish from the recipe presented and likely won't make it again. If I were to make it again, I'd need to add some additional spices or seasonings as the flavor was bland. It's not a bad dish but needs a little something extra.

We did not like the greasy texture we felt was imparted by the Kielbasa. It tended to feel more slimy than creamy.  Will try it again without the meat

Only change was that I added additional cheese...and it still was not very cheesy tasting.  As much as I like using the natural cheeses, adding Velveeta would definitely have improved the taste and given it a creamier consistency.

I swapped Italian sausage meat (browned) for the Kielbasa and pushed the recommended cheese measure to a full 16oz.  
Next time around (I liked it enough that I'm confident I'll make it again.), I will use half as much bread crumb and substitute Panko style for regular.

I love Mac and Cheese and this is a good one! I also love kielbasa! However, I thought the kielbasa overwhelmed the mac and cheese. Next time I make it (and I will) I'll substitute cooked ham. I think the mildness of ham will be a much better complement to the the laid-back flavour of the cheesy pasta. I also used only about a quarter cup of bread crumbs.

Loved the addition of kielbasa. After reading other reviews I also used half and half for more richness and rather than chop the onion, I grated 1/2 onion.

The whole family loved it!   I only made minor changes.  I used minced onion, about 1/2 of what the recipe called for.  I also used shredded double cheddar cheese (a blend of sharp and mild) and used Panko bread crumbs mixed with some melted butter for the topping.

Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of macaroni and cheese. I never ate it growing up and had never prepared it before in all of my 42 years of marriage. I decided to make this dish when I found a box of macaroni in my pantry and since summer has ended I knew I wouldn't be making macaroni salad until next summer. I looked at several recipes and decided on this one mostly because of the kielbasa in it making it a "one dish meal"   I used real butter and whole milk along with a white onion. My husband and I just finished our second helping and I am a fan!!  The flavors meld together to make a creamy flavorful meal. I plan on making this one for holidays and when we have guest over to dinner. Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe

The first time I made this, it was a little dry and needed more flavor, so I added about 1 cup of extra milk, a diced garlic clove, 1 tsp ground mustard, a little more shredded cheddar, a little shredded parmesan and 4oz of cream cheese to the sauce (for good measure). I allowed the sauce to simmer much longer than 2 minutes (6-8 minutes) and I continually tasted it to make sure it was flavorful and that the cheese was fully melted. Instead of using lots of breadcrumbs on top, I sprinkled more shredded cheddar and just used some Panko crumbs sparingly. I basically added 16oz of cheddar cheese (instead of 10oz) when it was all said and done! My boyfriend thought it was about the best thing he'd ever eaten!

This is DEFINITELY my favorite mac and cheese bake EVER. I don't really change anything, except add the cheese powder from the box of a new cheese I use the noodles from (OH NOES PRESERVATIVES are delicious, lol). In our house "too much onion" is cursing, and the same goes for "too much cheese". The only thing I did change was that I used shredded cheddar instead of chopping a block up. 
Overall?? Soul food for me.

This is very good. I didn't  have an onion so I used a little onion powder. I didn't have the kielbasa so I used all beef hot dogs.

This wasn't bad, but it was kind of bland, even with sharp cheddar cheese.  If I make this again, I'll definitely add seasonings (dry mustard, cayenne pepper, garlic...).

Good recipe! I made it honey garlic sausage. I wish I had added more cheese to the sauce as well as some garlic. But all around a delicious recipe.

It was ok. We didn't like the onion or breadcrumb in it. So, next time, I will leave those out and see how it turns out.

Very delicious, except the recipe calls for wayyyyy too many bread crumbs. I'd put half the amount next time. I might even forgo baking it at all, as it was super yummy straight out of the pan.

This turned out really good! My hubby had something similar at the cafeteria where he works and he liked it a lot. He's not crazy about food, so when he likes something, I put it into a regular rotation. I didn't stray from the recipe as written

This was incredibly tasty. I did vary a bit from the ingredients. I used Turkey Kielbasa, Shredded Mexican Four Cheese blend, a Vidalia onion and Italian Panko bread crumbs. Just using what was in teh cupboards. Delicious. My husband loved it too.

I tried this recipe on Monday night. And my family loved it!!! I did make a few changes because I thought it was blend. I added chicken sausage from Trader Joe's, sweet onion, and Vegeta as my salt spice, and fresh ground pepper. My bread crumbs were Italian Style. I would make this again in a heart beat! Plus, when my family loves it, it's that much more of an incentive to make it again!

Thank you for the submission!

Used this as a base recipe. .. used more cheese less bread crumbs and broiled the bread crumbs to make them crunchy. Instead of kielbasa I had some pepperoni on hand. Turned out super good.

My husband and daughter do not like cheesy saucy mac n cheese, so I was looking for a recipe that might be a bit on the dry  side.  This is it and surprising good this way.  The cheese sauce was not real heavy.  The kielbasa was a nice addition.  I also only added about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs on top & I did a combination of sharp & mild cheddar cheese to make it more kid friendly.

I grilled some hot dogs since I didn't have kielbasa. I used about 2 extra ounces of cheese and topped the dish with buttered Ritz cracker crumbs. My husband scraped the bowl clean!   Thanks for a great recipe.

This didn't come out as creamy as I would like a mac and cheese, but it was still okay for dinner.  We just used the grease cooked off the sausage instead of butter for the roux and added a crushed clove of garlic, along with dashes of mustard powder, paprika, thyme and marojam for flavor.  Only used 1/2C crumbs with some parsley for the topping; any more than that would have been way too crusty.  As it is, if we were to make this again, we'd cut the flour to 2T, as we could taste flour more than the cheese in the sauce.

This is a great base for a recipe but I have adapted it to be Gluten Free.  I omit the onion and add garlic instead, cornstarch instead of flour and quite a bit more cheese.  I use GF shells instead of macaroni noodles.  I also use GF bread crumbs, shredded cheese and a little cajun seasoning for the topping.  This results in a nice crunchy top.  My family loves this recipe and can't even tell it's GF!

This was an excellent, hearty meal for the whole family.  Everyone enjoyed this which is unusual.  I used 8 ounces of sharp cheddar and 2 ounces of Yellow American.  It made a great combination!

As a college student who cooks for friends mostly, & occasionally family, this was a big hit. So much so that my friends asked me to make it again. I did modify the recipe some with turkey kielbasa & some pepper jack cheese on top of the sharp cheddar for some spice, but still a big hit :)

The bread crumbs ruined it for me. Super gritty. I would give it no stars if that were an option. Inedible!

Like others I read, this dish received mixed reviews in my house! I did a full batch plus another half. I used less than a cup of bread crumbs (Italian flavored). The kids were okay with it, hubby was so so, and I liked it. I think next time I will use Panko as suggested in another review and mild cheddar or maybe even colby jack. All in all it was a new dish and that was what I was going for :o)

Yummy! I used cracker crumbles instead, also used hotdogs (we didn't have kielbasa in the house that night). I used cheddar and pepperjack cheeses - it could have used more spice to it. Will try again and add some flavor!

This is REALLY good. I think one time I am just going to make the cheese sauce from this recipe and use it as a dip for a crusty bread. I always sample the sauce several times before I mix it all up... you know... just to make sure it is OK. ;)

Everyone in my family loved this! Followed recipe exactly except added more cheese. I was worried my kids (13 & 10) wouldn't care for the kielbasa but they did. My 10 year old even said I should make this again.

Loved this! I used a lb of spiral pasta, with about 6 oz of mozerella.  Omitted the chopped onion (I have a child who won't touch an actual onion) and added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 paprika, a pinch of red pepper. Chopped up some turkey dogs and threw them in as well.  Would be good with peas too.  Ground some pepper on top and threw it in the oven.  Yum!

Delicious!  I made a couple of minor changes to suit my tastes.  Instead of chopped onion, I used 1 tsp of onion powder.  I also added 1 teaspoon of ground mustard, and pepper jack cheese.  The only way I will make Mac & cheese from now on!  Thanks for sharing.

This was so good!!! I followed the recipe to a T except I had a small wheel of Gouda cheese I needed to use so I chopped and added it in with the cheese(I used a block of velvetta). Oh my goodness was it the best mac-n-cheese I've ever had!!! We will make this many more times I am sure of it!!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!!

Tweaked it a bit by using bacon instead of sausage and drippings in place of the butter.  Also added mustard powder and worchestershire to give it some kick.  We only use whole wheat pasta but it turned out good.

Finally, a fantastic yet simple mac & cheese recipe! I love this recipe because it is good as-is and can also be easily altered to your own personal tastes. The first time I made it I did it almost exactly as written, only adding a few more noodles (because when I mixed in the cooked noodles there was a TON of sauce) and used panko bread crumbs mixed with a little grated parm instead of just straight up bread crumbs. I also added a little dried mustard as a previous reviewer suggested. The other time I made it I used 16oz of whole wheat macaroni noodles, added some broccoli and omitted (well, forgot) the dried mustard. Oh, and both times I've just used dried minced onions (about 1 Tbs). The second time, of course it wasn't AS good but it was much healthier and made a larger portion, while still being delicious! Great recipe, thank you!

Great base for Mac & Cheese. I used shredded cheese. Use extra sharp for the richest cheddar flavor. Very yummy!

Was a huge hit in my home.  Having a French husband he is very critical of food and he loved it.  My kids loved it too.  I changed by adding an 8oz package of Sharp cheddar cheese and one jar of cherishing instead of the block cubed cheese.  Very creamy and velvety.

Love it and its become a regular part of our dinner rotation.  We substitute in diced ham so we can make it a little quicker by skipping Step 1.  Also, our kids prefer less onion.

Delicious.  I used the Mexican cheese blend, just a little onion and just a dusting of bread crumbs on the top.  Definitely a keeper.

This was the best mac and cheese I've ever made or tasted. Two things make it special: 1) cooking the sauce in the same pan as you browned the kielbasa in allows that flavor to subtly permeate the entire dish; and 2) I used shredded EXTRA SHARP Cheddar, which makes a huge difference in the flavor. I also used Nathan's Angus Beef Smoked Sausage, which is fabulous. I always use Panko bread crumbs, and just sprinkled enough on top to cover the surface (much less than one cup), and topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan. 20 minutes didn't seem long enough (the crumbs weren't brown) so I baked it for 30, but I'm at a high altitude which does affect things like that. All in all, FABULOUS!! I'll be making this often.

So yummy! I added a few extra vegetables including red pepper and tomato and I always use mashed up Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I cut up the kielbasa very fine as well. I made half the serving as I cook just for myself and still had lots leftover for lunches. Excellent recipe!

It was OK. I thought that the sausage added a nice flavor to it, but it just didn't "wow" my family.  I'm still on a quest for a homemade macaroni and cheese recipe that knocks them off of their feet!

I did find this recipe to be a bit drab and plain..but if ye like things like that then go on an try it for youselves.  You see I have this cat..its a little black cat names Minstrel.  He loves gettin into the cold cellar and eating the cheese.  We spun a few cheese cloths when grandad had the loom operational.. but you know how the temper of a loom is like the temper of any woman. Well we had made a few wheels of somes finest goat cheese this side of texas and Minstrel would go on down when he could pry the door ajar and roll in the catnip mixed in with the other spices we hung to dry.  Come two weeks I had not set foot in that cellar I went down and little cat had coated the wheels solid with every spice in the cold cellar spices everywhere!  Daddie used ta tell me "you never sent a devil to cold water without a hat".  Now, I aint been a good christian man all my life but I did see the devil in that little minstrels eyes when I tasted the spice mix coated on the cheese that day.  I sell 'em just like that and two wheels a year come out of that little cellar.  Minstrel is gone now but his recipe lives on you can find us if yer over in the seattle area.

This is how I've made my macaroni and cheese for years. I use whatever meat or sausage I have on hand, left over steak is awesome or this time I used ham. I do use a bit more cheese than called for here.

Too much onion in ,my opinion. I only use 1/2. My ratio of 2 tablespoons flour to 1/4 cup butter is better and less fattening. Also, not near enough cheese..use 4 ounces of a processed cheese also, with a shredded cheddar. A hard brick of cubes does not melt very well.

Very good macaroni and cheese. I will try to add another spice to it to add a bit more flavour but overall very good. I cooked chicken sausage and put it in which made it really yummy.

Really good.  I used 3/4 tsp of onion powder because I didn't have an onion.  I used turkey kielbasa.  Think it was better unbaked... but I used whole wheat pasta which always needs more liquid. Slightly different flavour than plain mac and cheese.  Would make again.

Regardless of what the other reviews say, I found the amount of cheesiness to be just perfect *as it is* in this recipe.  All six of us ate and enjoyed this excellent homey side dish, the kielbasa was a great, meaty touch.  The one great versatile thing?  I only had eight ounces of sharp cheddar...so I threw in some mozzarella I had in the fridge and called it good.  But, I only ended up sprinkling half a cup of bread crumbs on the dish, not the full cup

we loved this recipe, I used cubes of swiss and sharp cheddar I had leftover from the holidays, I also added garlic powder and rosemary and left off the bread crumbs.  I didn't have kielbasa but added cubed ham I also had leftover.  Definitely a keeper in my book

I wanted this for a side dish, so, I left out the Kielbasa.  My husband has an onion allergy, so that was omitted as well.  I added extra cheese on top of the macaroni and then sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top of that and then baked it.  Excellent!

Yum!  I made a few changes.  Instead of kielbasa, I added shredded chicken.  I also mixed in garlic, spinach and tomatoes.  Perfect dinner for a cold night!

The whole family thought it was really good. I only had shredded cheese, so I used that instead and it worked just as well. I also crushed garlic croutons  and sprinkled over the top and it was fantastic.

Loved this recipe for Mac and cheese! The 2nd time I used ground turkey instead for my finicky children and it was a hit! I chopped more onions and cooked the ground turkey first.

Good alternative to Ohio baked and CO creamy. Everyone likes this even Terry. He is not as thrilled about the onions.

Absolutely Phenomenal!!  We have had it with kielbasa, ham and without meat.  It's best with kielbasa but wonderful either way.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

Best ever! Much better idea to blend the cheese this way first. I was raised with a recipe that just dumped the chunks of cheese in with the pasta and milk. Invariably, it separated and looked unappetizing. Hubby says the sausage makes it!

My kids loved this macaroni and cheese.  This is like a "kicked up" version of macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.  I used turkey kielbasa to cut back on some of the fat, and it turned out fabulous.  No complaints from the family, and that's what I like.

I have now made this dish 3 times and each time it came out wonderful. The only substitution I used was bacon in place of the kielbasa, only because we never buy kielbasa. But I think that the next time I make this I will use kielbasa instead.

GREAT! I did half the kielbasa and I used the turkey kind. It was enough for my family. I also left some cheese cubes whole and tossed them in at the end so we got gobs of cheese. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed ritz crackers. My husband raved about it (and he never does that!)

Made this recipe as follows along with adding about 4 oz. of velvetta per other viewers recommendations.  Still turned out very dry.  I asked everyone to at least try one bite being the look was not very appealing as well.  The taste was just as bad as the look.  Dry and taste less.

I loved this recipe but I did as others said and used panko instead of bread crumbs. I also put 2 slices of velveeta into the sauce. I didn't use all of the cheddar in the sauce but opted to spread half of it on top of the recipe. My kids LOVED it! Thank you!! Will defnitely be making this again.

This turned out pretty well. I suggest using less bread crumbs or mixing them in rather than just putting on top. Also, the more cheese you use the better.
