I know someone's gonna kick me for this review but this was a near-disaster. Perhaps it's because I scaled this to serve 6 but no one was thrilled with this. I even cooked it longer and added addtl cornstarch to thicken but it was very liquidy and VERY bland. I even added some chili powder and a dash of cayenne per other suggestions to spice it up but we were still not happy. "Louisanna Shrimp Creole" also found on this site - we think - is much better. Ediable? Yes. But I almost cried as I tossed out the leftovers (alot)...esspecially since shrimp was involved. I wish I could brag this recipe up, but I just can't...but perhaps it would have worked better had I just done the 2 servings (but then, it wouldn't have fed my family). Ahhh, I guess you can't win them all!? Thanks just the same for posting.

Very delicious. I used butter instead of bacon fat and it still turned out great. My husband and I have been fighting over the leftovers ever since I made it last night.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish with white rice. It turned out perfectly and tastes great.  The only thing I did differently is that I sauted the onions, peppers and garlic in a mixture of butter & oil before adding the flour into the butter/oil. I added oil to keep the butter from burning. I highly recommend this recipe..it's a keeper!

Shrimp Creole has always been a mainstay in our southern family. I will have to say that adding the bacon to the mix is what really turns this dish into a gourmet crowd pleaser!We cook the shrimp for a maximum of 10 minutes,to avoid the rubbery texture. Also, we were lavish with the cayenne pepper.Served over white long grain rice . bon appetit!

This is a family favorite. I use olive oil instead of bacon fat because I very rarely have that on hand and then as others suggested browned the onionfirst. I also use red,yellow and orange peppers since I don't care for green. For that extra kick a dash of crushed red pepper. The left overs are even better.

This recipe is really easy to make. I had to add 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp. tabasco to spice it up a little. But great flavor overall.

Awesome! Had never taken time to make a real roux before and I think that made all the difference in giving it a rich flavor. Made modifications due to what I had and other reviews: used one can stewed and one can diced tomatoes, roasted red pepper in water in place of green, 2 heaping tsp. of jar minced garlic, a few shakes of Tabasco, a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and only 1/2 cup of water.  Forgot the parsley. Served it over a brown/wild rice mix and it was fantastic! I discovered that while shrimp is frozen the tail shells pull right off. Will be a regular meal for us. Thanks!

This was very good.  I added some cayenne pepper and a little bit of hot sauce as well.  Very easy to make.  Tasted a bit sweet, I guess it was due to the tomatoes.

Surprisingly delicious. I added celery and replaced bacon fat with olive oil and bacon bits. It's so easy to make, I can even make this during work week.

This recipe was absolutely great. The first time I made it with shrimp and the second time with some chicken strips. Both times it was delicious! I did use a can of diced tomatoes and another time I used chili ready tomatoes. It was delicious! This will be a regular meal. Thanks

This is an real creole recipe, very similar to the one I've used with success for years.  The bacon fat cooked into the flour makes a 'roux', olive oil doesn't make a roux.  I have a jar of browned flour (la farine brulee) that I use with fat for making roux.  I know, I'm being picky - it would be just dandy make with olive oil.
I would hot it up for my family but everyone's taste buds are different and you can add, not subtract.  A bottle of hot sauce or dried hot peppers can always be on the table for those would wish it spicier.  Thanks for sharing this fine recipe.

I had to cook bacon just to render the grease and since I doubled the recipe I still didn't end up with enough so i used half olive oil. I also used only 2 cups of water because thats all I could fit in the saucepan and after reading reviews about it being watery I'm glad I did. The sauce was very tasty but we would have liked for it to be a bit more spicy.

I honestly think I hyped myself up when I planned on cooking and dining on this recipe.  Looking at the ingredients I was anticipating a more savory, sweet flavor and I just very let down after my first plate.  Nothing special is all I can say.  I do agree with most of these reviews, The recipe is extremely "saucey." I do love shrimp, but I more than likely won't choose to use the recipe again.  Actually...I'm going to delete it from my recipe box right now.

I have to agree with Dreginek on this one. I didn't even rescale it as it was just for my wife and myself. We both agree with the observation that there is way too much liquid. Maybe draining some off the tomatoes would have helped, but we don't think so. 
We also thought it was too bland. This may have also been due to the water.

My husband just said "this is one of your bests". I followed someone elses advice and cooked the peppers (yellow and red-we don't like green), onions and garlic in olive oil and butter first, then I added some bacon fat. I added a little red pepper flakes (4 shakes).  I doubled the recipe and served it over brown rice.  Next time I will add extra shrimp. Happily we have leftovers.

Pretty good.  Works quite well as leftovers too.  I omitted the bacon fat.
Served over rice to absorb the sauce that remains; I also tried
wrapping it in lettuce but that was a mess and I don't think the lettuce
flavor complemented the dish well.

Good recipe, but needs more spices added to bring out the flavors of the shrimp and pepper.  I suggest more salt, file powder, and add celery for the holy trinity.

Great dish.  I left off the bacon fat to cut some of the calories and it was still great.  Served over rice.

Excellent, for the people that think it is bland ... Try some seasoned stewed tomatoes that will do the trick.

This recipe was a first for me on a LOT of things. It was my first roux, my first creole/cajun dish, and my first time cooking shrimp. I followed the recipe for the most part, but since I didn't have any stewed tomatoes I used 1 can of diced canned tomatoes instead. And I had to swap cilantro for parsley, since I grabbed the wrong thing at the store

I read the other reviews about it being too watery and bland, and was worried since my canned tomatoes also had added liquid. So, instead of water I used hot V8 juice, and I only used about 1 cup. 

As far as flavor, I definitely agree with other posts that some sort of hot spice/sauce is needed. I used cayenne and chili powder, but I think red pepper flakes, tabasco, or even a diced jalepeno would work. Without that, I think it would have been too bland. 

The best part of this recipe though, is that it was pretty basic and easy (even for a first-timer), and even my shrimp-hating husband ate it and said he would eat it again. So, anything that gets Mr. picky to eat shrimp is a plus in my book. 

I served it over lightly salted bulgur wheat. Rice, pasta, quinoa, potatoes would all work great too.

It was great not to "pare down" a recipe so it would serve two people.  I used olive oil instead of bacon fat and it was good.  I will spice it up a bit next time just because we enjoy spicier.  A keeper!

Even my 4 year old loved this recipe!  I doubled it thinking I would have left overs, but I was wrong.  I served this over zatarain's dirty rice (minus the hamburger) and it was excellent...this will definitely be back on the dinner table soon!

Very tasty, but since I'm a native born New Orleanian, I added a few things. I needed a quick dinner, so I couldn't use my family recipe. I followed the recipe as is, until the end. I then realized there was no celery or bay leaf. Thank heaven for celery salt, which I could use because I really hold back on the salt (for health reasons) when I cook. I added a couple of dried bay leaves during the last 10 mins. of simmering the sauce. All-in-all, this recipe is a keeper. Next time I'll remember to prep the full trinity of onions, bell pepper, and celery and also add the bay leaf.

It came out pretty bland. Next time I'll try using more hot sauce/hot pepper flakes as other reviewers have suggested.

I cheat a little on this one by using Trader Joe's roasted garlic marinara sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes and sauce. Also, TJ's precooked bacon. But you have to take the time to make the roux! I throw the onion, garlic, red peppers, and parsley in my little chopper. Even minced up some little carrots and sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. Threw in some sliced mushrooms too. I don't add water. Maybe just a little wine or broth. Fabulous, rich sauce! For a special dinner, you can't beat it.

This is a very good recipe and all it needs to be five star is a pinch or so of red pepper flakes. It is Creole after all. :)

I’ve made this twice now. The first time I made it I doubled the shrimp. The second time I made it exactly as written. Both times we added hot sauce at the table. I actually liked the time I doubled the shrimp best. As written it is still delicious but a bit soupy for my taste.

It was very liquidy and looked/tasted more like a pasta sauce. The amount of tomatoes made it pretty sour. I then thought to add around 1/3 cup of coconut milk to it and that did the trick. I also added cornstarch and water to thicken the mix. The end result was a nice rich shrimp stew! In conclusion, not a fan of the original recipe but with coconut milk? I'm all for it, haha.

I used one 14oz can of tomatoes and a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes for added kick.  I used a yellow bell pepper, instead of green because I don't like green bell peppers.  Decreased the amount of water to 1 cup, because 1 1/2 sounded too soupy.  Added 1/2 tsp of spanish smoked paprika, because it's yummy.  It turned out really nice!
