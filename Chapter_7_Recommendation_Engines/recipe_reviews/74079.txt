Not bad.  I added about double the amount of Italian dressing, though, as the filling just didn't seem to have the "kick" that I was looking for.  The good thing about deviled egg filling is that you can tweak the ingredients to suit your particular taste - in this case I added more dressing, pepper and sprinkled some red pepper in there as well.  I don't know if I'd call this recipe "spicy" if it's made as stated.  The Italian dressing did perk it up some, however.  A worthwhile try.  Thanks for the submission.

These were OK.  After tasting, I added sweet pickle relish and a little garlic powder.  I guess I just can't give up my relish in deviled eggs.

i absolutely love this recipe!! its zingy, creamy deliciousness! i used zesty italian dressing from kraft to spruce it up a bit. i wouldnt say this was spicy so if thats what your looking for go heavy on the pepper or try cayanne pepper too, also add your favorite hot ingredients.

I followed this recipe down to a "T" and I couldn't even eat them. I usually eat anything but the egg filling was way too salty and the italian dressing gave it a sweet taste that was not what I'm used too.

Fantastic! I did make some modifications though. I used light mayo, pkgd. italian seasoning instead of dressing, and also added 2 dashes chilli powder, and lastly 3 tablespoons of jalapeno olive juice from the jar. I got so many compliments on them. Not too spicy either. The olive juice gives them that extra salt kick.

Loved this!! I brought this dish to a Christmas Party and it was gone within 5 minutes no kidding! The Italian dressing added just the right twist to the ordinary deviled eggs ~ this is now going to be a "must bring"dish to gatherings ;-) Thank you!

This was a great recipe!  I did however make a couple revisions.  I used hot and spicy southwest mustard (gave it more heat) and Krafts Tuscany Italian dressing and olive oil mayo.  Topped with chopped chives.  Yummy!!!

I've been making this recipe for over a year now and wouldn't change a thing.  I love the italian dressing w/ the spicy mustard....an excellent combination.  I always receive compliments on my deviled eggs.  Definitely an excellent recipe!

Good but tasted a lot like italian dressing so I'd definitely reduce that a bit next time. In general, the filling consistancy was definitely a bit too runny, but reducing the salad dressing will probably take care of this problem as well. Also, it wasn't spicey at all so I would HIGHLY recommend adding a drop or 2 of Tabasco or Franks Red Hot if your looking for a spicey kick.

This recipe has italian flavor, but it's not very 'Spicy'. Had to add lots of extra pepper.

Good but not great--the filling consistancy was a little runny for me, and I do not consider them spicy at all (I even added some Frank's Red Hot, but will add more and probably jals next time). Other than that its a very good, easy recipe.

I used miracle whip instead of mayo, doubled the amount of dressing and added extra mustard and pepper.  It's not bad, but I'd describe the flavor as more zesty than spicy.

I never heard of taking eggs off the heat, I find it a pain cooking boiled eggs but I love them!  So I tried this technique but ruined the eggs.  I suggest the same steps, but once the water starts boiling, then turn the heat down a bit and leave them for 12-15 mins.

Other than that, the recipe was pretty good.  If you want it spicier, put some cayenne pepper in there too!

I tried these for lunch. two kinds, the original mustand and mayo filling and also some with the zesty italian dressing and white vinegar added. I liked them much more than the regular ones, but next time i would use more dressing and some white vinegar

I have made simpler but hadn’t used French salad dressing and brown mustard. They had that more of a tang to them.  I will be changing my receipt.

Boyfriend approved, and I thought they had the right amount of zing! My eggs looked ugly however since I have very little experience peeling eggs.

I love deviled eggs of all kinds.  For extra spice I added a pinch of cayenne.  Start with a pinch and continue to add to your liking.  Just becareful after tasting  each addition of cayenne, there might not be anything to fill the whites with.
