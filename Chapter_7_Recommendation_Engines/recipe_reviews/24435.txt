Very tasty, but weren't as chewy as i had expected.  The thinner ones were more on the hard side, so next time i will make some adjustments to make them chewier.  But great, all the same!

These were YUMMY! But take them out before they are crisp. The flavor comes through better when they are soft. I know some gingerbread-like cookies are often flavorless cardboard. But these were REALLY good. I added 1 tsp vanilla, and next time will increase the brown sugar to a whole cup....for a few people who wanted them sweeter. We used little man cutters. We made buttercream frosting and piped on faces and buttons. It was alot of fun and they are GREAT flavorful cookies! I will be using this recipe again at Christmastime for sure!

I love molasses cookies, and no matter how these turned out, I probably would've loved them regardless. My husband however, is a much tougher customer. I've tried probably 6 or 7 different recipes and he's always hated them... until this one!! I've made 3 batches in 3 days, 1st night I quartered the recipe to make 1 dozen (since I figured it'd just be my son & I eating them), 2nd night made half the recipe (they didn't last through the night), 3rd night, which is tonight, I made the full recipe and they're STILL already almost gone!!! My husband never devours cookies like this, so this is definitely a recipe to save! I followed everything exactly the first night, and they were great. 2nd & 3rd batches I added just a bit of vanilla, which was even better! Sprinkled with sugar fresh out of the oven, and they disappear almost instantly! I'll never use another molasses cookie recipe besides this one again! Thanks SO much!! :)

Very good. Very moist, flavourful, and not too sweet. The entire family loved them. My first batch was gone before the second came out of the oven. you do need to make sure that you do not over bake them. Under baking is better than over baking.

These were super easy to make.  I had some kid helpers that made my liquid mesaurements off, so I did have to add a bunch more flour to get something I could roll out, but after 20min in the freezer it was just fine.  Great tasting and soft and chewy.  Not too sweet which was nice, we did add a little piped sugar cookie fosting.  I added a touch more ginger than called for.  This is a great addition to my holiday cookie selection.

BEST COOKIES EVER! If you like ginger cookies at least. I did have to dock 1 star though because I needed more spice. So I doubled the ginger and added a few dashes of nutmeg, allspice, cloves and a bit of vanilla. Oh and I'm lazy and have very little counter space so I don't like rolling out cookies, so I rolled the dough into small balls with my hands, dipped them in sugar, dropped them on the cookie sheet and flattened them a bit with the fork (the sugar helps the fork not stick to the dough). Be sure to not over cook them, they are best when a bit under-cooked and still chewy.

These are really good, and easy enough for my daughter to make when I wasn't home.  I like the fact she wanted to learn how to cook from scratch, I would have preferred her to have me around during the learning process though.   It was a very tasty surprise when I got home that day...I didn't know if I should punish her or not.

Delicious!  These cookies are great - soft and flavorful.  Yum! I am so happy to have a cookie recipe without eggs, as my son is allergic to eggs.  These will be his special Christmas cookie, this year and beyond...  Both my daughter (6) and son (3) love these cookies.  My husband has eaten so many since last night, that I will have to make another batch for Christmas!  Thumbs up from my whole family!

I’m trying to replicate the molasses cookies that my aunt who lived in Texas used to bake (Aunt Sister’s Christmas Cookies) -they were rolled out like these and soft like these.  I didn’t have sour cream so I substituted about 3T of butter and between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of buttermilk.  I also didn’t have ginger so I added about 1/2t  ground nutmeg and 1/2t ground cloves.  Still not as spicy as my aunt’s and I think they do need the ginger; next time I will add a full t of cloves and nutmeg.  I also added 1/2 C currants because my aunt used currants in hers.  LOL - they are good but not the same taste as my aunt’s so I will keep trying and use this as my base recipe.  All the other molasses cookie recipes said to drop the dough or roll it in a ball and I wanted to cut mine in the shape of trees as did my aunt.

It wasn't the flavor I was hoping for.  I made the recipe exactly how it was written.  It seemed the ginger was stronger than the molasses.

The dough tastes great, with a wonderful spicy molasses flavor.  HOWEVER, it would have been good to include in the directions the fact that the dough needs to be chilled before it can be rolled out.  Thankfully I had enough time to chill it before making these cookies.  Not sure how that important step was missed.

I like the texture of the cookie. When I rolled them to 1/4 inch,  it took the full 10 min.  to get them cooked. I added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg based on other recipes I have seen and to be honest,  I didn't think they were spicy enough.  Next time I might double all the spices and update this post.
