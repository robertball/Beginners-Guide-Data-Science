Took a risk on this because there were no other reviews.  But this was a pretty easy recipe and very tasty, so I wanted to submit my thoughts.  My family and I enjoyed this pizza a lot, although I made a few small tweaks based on ingredients I had available, and my preferences. First I made a wheat dough in my breadmaker, then subbed about 1T dried rosemary for the fresh, because I did not have fresh on hand, and used a red potato instead of Yukon because that's what I had.  For the onion I used red, probably only a quarter (or less) of one.  I used my pizza stone, and after cooking the toppings without the cheese (as per instructions) I then topped it with a combo of mozzarella & some shredded parmesan.  It turned out very nicely, the rosemary was definitely noticeable, but I enjoy rosemary a lot, and I think the Parmesan complemented the other flavors very well. This is also a really great pizza for those (such as my children) who don't care for tomato sauces. They are both toddlers, and somewhat picky, but seemed to like this one. Hope you enjoy!
