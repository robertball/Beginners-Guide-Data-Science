These turned out good but my husband and I both agree that they needed some kind of cream in the stuffing to make them smooth and creamy like twice baked potatoes typically are. A couple other things I will mention is that you need to plan on 20 extra minutes for your airfryer to heat to 350. Lastly, the ingredient list calls for you to peel and slice your potatoes in half. Do not peel your potatoes or you will not have a shell to put them in.
