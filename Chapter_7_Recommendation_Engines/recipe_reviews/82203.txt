I am making these for my daughters wedding reception. She is decorating with apples, so everything we are eating is apples. I tried these at home and they were wonderful. But here are my changes. I use an Asagio sourdough bread9available at Costco. I also used Gala apples, feta cheese and some sudried tomatoes for color. Then I cut them in 4ths for wonderful appetizers.

I used whole wheat pita bread instead of multigrain sandwich bread.  I only used one apple because my Granny Smith apple was too large and two of them would have overwhelmed the recipe.  I diced the apple instead of cutting it.  I will definitely make this again.  It had an unusual, but good, flavor.

I made this for my husband and me.  I used 100% whole wheat bread, storebought hummus, granny smith apples, and sharp cheddar.  My husband picked the apples off the sandwhich and ate them, but didn't like the combo together.  I thought it was just "okay".  I had high hopes for the sandwich because I love all the ingredients, but it just wasn't great.  I ate it, but probably would not make again.

I thought this was great. Very interesting combo - I like cheese and apples together, but never thought of including hummus with them! To make it easier, I just popped my whole wheat bread in the toaster first, then used Sabra Classic Hummus and thinly sliced Honeycrisp apples (all I had on hand) with sliced sharp Cheddar and stuck it in my toaster oven. It was definitely different, and in a good way! I will totally make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

What an unexpectedly awesome sandwich! Apples + Hummus is an amazing flavor combo. I use whole wheat rolls and toast them on my stovetop. Once I threw a small handful of spinach between the apples and cheese to add some vegetable, that was great too. Slice the apples as thin as you can, they way they get "cooked" a bit more during broiling, which really brings out the tangy sweetness.

This sandwich is great and extremely easy.  I used homemade humus and a heavy whole grain bread.  It's perfect for those nights when you don't have enough time to cook.

When I took the first bite, I wasn't sure I liked this...I liked each item individually, but not thinking I liked them together!  After each successive bite the flavors were growing on me.  By the time I ate the entire sandwich, I had decided I liked it and would definitely make this recipe again.  I used Honey Crisp apples because that is what I had in the house, next time I'll try to stick to the recipe and use Granny Smith.

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand and needed an easy dinner for one.  I was leery of the apple, so I sliced it very thin for one piece of bread, and didn't put any on the other piece. I'm so sorry I didn't use the apple for both. It added just the right amount of crunch to this sandwich as well as an interesting flavor.  I toasted the bread in my toaster oven and then top-browned it rather than use the oven.  It was really delicious.

this really turned out very good.  I Made some hummus and saw this recipe and decided to try it out.  I did not have granny smith apple so i used gala apples instead.  It still turned out very tasty.  the sweetness of the apples with the cheese and hummus where a wonderful combination.  I cannot wait to see how the granny smiths will taste with it. I will for sure make this again. yummm

This was okay but I did used white bread, red apples and chedder cheese because that was what I had in the kitchen. I wonder if the Granny Smith Apples would of made a big difference along with the sharp chedder??? I will try this again.

We tried this for supper last night because we needed something quick, and it was surprisingly good and satisfying!  We just had spicy hummus, gala apples and Mexican cheese on hand, but next time we're going to "gourmet" it up and use pine nut hummus, Granny Smiths and smoked gouda. I'm sure this will have a place in our quick-dinner repertoire!

I love this combination of flavors! Instead of bread, I use the Thomas' Sahara White Pita Bread and I skip the pre-toasting. Once the cheese is melted and bubbly, I slice it in quarters after and eat it like a little pizza. I think it would make a beautiful and easy-to-eat appetizer this way.

These were great! We were skeptical, but looking for a new sandwich idea. My husband and I were both surprised with how much we liked these, as well as how filling they were.  I used the zucchini hummus recipe on this site.

I'm still trying to decide if I like this or not.  I adjusted it as I had boursin cheese and no cheddar, so I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt and say I liked it.  Not sure if hubby would or not; I made while he was out of town and when I told him what it was (I made two but only ate one so one was in the fridge), he stated he might like it.  It is a very intriguing recipe and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used a hummus with garlic in it, a mild cheddar cheese, and left the peel on the apples.  Maybe the sharp cheddar would've given it more taste.  The ingredients are all things we like separately so I was expecting a lot more from this recipe. This recipe seems healthy but we just didn't find it to be very tasty.  Probably won't make again.

This is a very versatile recipe.  We use different types of bread, all sorts of different cheeses, and different fruit or veggies.  We often make this for breakfast using eggs in place of the apples.  This is a great clean-out-the fridge sandwich and is quick and easy to make on busy nights.  We especially love it since our picky 4-year-old twins eat this without fail!

Love hummas and whole grain. Try with the health nut bread and while good with the apples it is also great with other things; especialy like it with asparaguss. And everything is better with cheddar but never used with hummas before, good combo. Will make again and again will also try other substitutes for the apple.

What an interesting combination of flavors.  I'd never think to combine them, but it works.  My husband and I both loved this.  My three-year-old...not so much, but she's picky.

This was pretty good.  Next time I will use a regular hummus (all I had this time was roasted red pepper).  And I didn't like my flax seed wheat bread, next time I'll just use a regular whole wheat bread.  I did not have granny smith's and believe they would have made it much better.  I'm looking forward to trying it again with the right ingredients!

I used the rye bread that I just baked as the base for this.  I had Pumpkin Hummus from AR, and layered on the apples and cheddar.  The tastes of garlic from the hummus and the apple were strange together, but overall, this was great! I'll be trying this with other flavors of breads, hummuses, apples and cheeses--what a great idea!

I made this recipe because I could not picture how it would of tasted, and also because it received great reviews.  I am still undecided on the recipe.  I ate my sandwich, but I can't figure out if I like it or not.  I'm thinking that next time I'll add more hummus.  I think I'll also try pear and bleu cheese.

Since discovering this I've had it at least once every couple of weeks.  It is a perfect use for the heel slice of the bread loaf, which I always used to throw away, but little did I realize it was meant for this.  I prefer them open-faced, but maybe that's just me.  I'm eating one right now.. Mmmm! Thanks!

I was looking for something easy to make on evenings that I have soccer and softball games and this is it. I never would have thought this combination would go well, but it's fabulous! I use shredded Parmesan cheese and it's a great pre- or post-game snack. Thanks for the recipe!

Better than it sounds!  Tasty, although a little messy/hard to eat with the filling slipping out.  Give it a try though!

I made it as directed. I liked all the ingredients but together they don't really make anything special. It was okay. Probably wont make again.

Surprised.  I was looking for new ways to uses the hummus I had.  I put on wheat bread and topped with vegan cheddar cheese (non-dairy soy…not quite the same ?)…but was happily surprised by both the texture and good mix of flavors – not to out of the ordinary.

Very good sandwich - for me and for my young toddler. I used a 100% whole wheat bread, some purchased hummus, gala apple slices, and sharp cheddar. My toddler's been eating hummus since he was around a year old so the only thing I did different for him was to julienne the apples to make sure it wasn't a choking hazard. Will make again!

A delicious and healthy - and most importantly - EASY meal. They are exceptionally good with gourmet bread and flavored hummus and some fresh herbs.

New favorite sandwich!! These are great. I made them on toasted pumpernickel bread. I don't think I'd try them on a very soft bread. I think the textures would clash and the bread would become soggy.
