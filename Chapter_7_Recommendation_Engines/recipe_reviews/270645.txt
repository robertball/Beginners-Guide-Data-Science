Delicious! Make sure you use ripe to very ripe bananas for the most banana taste. My son and I greatly enjoyed this dessert!

These are not like brownies. These are like chocolate cake that has chunks of banana in it. The banana is muted, barely there. It seems to be an attempt at “healthy” brownies. But will all the butter and chocolate, not fair to call them healthy. Super-moist. Great tasting. If they weren’t called brownies, I’d give them a higher rating.

2.20.19  This tastes like a fudgy, classic brownie, and that’s a good thing!  Although you get a hint of banana bread, it’s definitely in the background, as the cocoa/chocolate is what’s upfront in flavor.  As the Cook’s Notes suggested, I did sprinkle some chocolate chips on the top before the brownies went into the oven, and that may account for why I didn’t taste as much of the banana bread flavor as I would have liked.  Regardless, these are good brownies, with or with the additional chocolate chips, and I would make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
