Very yummy. I doubled the whipped topping, only because we REALLY like whipped topping. I also toasted my coconut and sprinkled it over each bowl of salad. We loved this. Quite refreshing.

Wow! Nothing screams summer like a delicious fruit salad. This is definitely bursting with vibrant colors and flavors! I toasted my cococut and topped with a dollop of fat free greek vanilla vs. non-dairy whipped topping. Very nice presentation and oh so refreshing!

Thank you for posting this recipe.  It was the inspiration I needed to make my fruit salad.  It did have a little too much cinnamon for my taste, but that is easily fixed next time - just taste as you go.

I love how fresh this is for summer.  The coconut gives it the perfect amount of sweetness.
