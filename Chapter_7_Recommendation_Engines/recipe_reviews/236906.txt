This was delicious! I made a few changes -I added a tsp of vanilla to the cake batter (next time I will probably add some nutmeg and ginger too). I also added another tsp of vanilla + 1 egg to the filling. I greased a by dr pan with butter (instead of using loaf pans or cooking spray) . I still cooked it for 1 hour and let it cool in the pan for 30 minutes. It came out of the pan with ease. My husband says he doesn't like pumpkin, but he ate 2 big pieces of this cake for breakfast and claims it's his new favorite breakfast cake!

I love this! It is moist and not crumbly like most gluten free baked goods. I followed the recipe but added a tsp of vanilla to the batter and poured it into a single pumpkin shaped pan. I had some if the batter left over though.  I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving, no one will be able to tell it is gluten free until they see me take a bite. I'm so excited to have this dessert!

I am gluten intolerant and this is by far the best gluten free cake I have ever had. I cooked mine in 2 loaf pans and omitted the cream cheese filling in this one but will be making a lot of pumpkin cream cheese rolls with this recipe.  I did make some changes because I did not have items on hand.  I substituted the butter for coconut oil, used coconut milk and also added an envelope of xanthin gum, which I do with all my gf baked goods that contain grain based flour. 
The batter was even incredible.  As soon as it came out of the oven it was soft on the inside and rather dense when I cut into it. I did have some hot with cool whip on it . Now that it has cooled properly, the texture is perfect and I highly recommend this to anyone.  I used brown rice flour and tapioca flour because that was what I had on hand.

I made this today for a brunch because my step MIL doesn't eat gluten. I added one teaspoon of vanilla to the cake batter and made it in a bundt pan. I baked it for about 70 minutes and I still wasn't sure it was done but took it out anyway because I was afraid I would over bake it and it would be dry and crumbly. It wasn't quite done so next time I'd put it in for longer. Everyone tried it and I had several comments that people really liked it and if it had been done a bit more it would have been perfect. My husband said he liked it just the way it was because it was very moist. I'm giving it 5 stars because it would've been perfect if it had been baked a bit longer and because you couldn't tell that it was gluten free.

I found this recipe a bit confusing especially when you look at the photo, so you take out a bundt pan and grease it and it isn't until you get past the description it tells you to use a loaf pan?  Other than finding the recipe a bit hard to organize, it did produce a decent pumpkin cake, a little too moist could have been humidity or the weather.  I am no longer doing gluten free, so I wouldn't be making it again anyway.

Not only was this THE MOST MOIST gf cake I have ever tasted,  it is better than any regular cake I've had! My entire family at Thanksgiving dinner (15) were so very impressed! I added just a tiny bit more sugar than called for plus vanilla,  nutmeg,  and cinnamon,  as others had suggested,  but I don't feel they made a difference in the moisture. Because I live in high altitude,  most cakes turn out dry and crumbly,  but not so with this recipe.  I will be making this many times over!

Turned out great. I did add 1t of nutmeg and a 1/2t of ginger.  I bake for a coffee shop and yummy gluten free recipes are valuable. The cream cheese filling makes this extra special.  I put it in a bundt pan and baked for 50 minutes.  It was moist in the middle but I think much longer and the edges might have suffered.  I might add 4 minutes next time. I drizzled powdered sugar icing because coffee shop customers like their frosting.  (really)  We'll see how it sells- if it sells well, I will certainly try this again.

This gives gluten free a bad name, it was horrible. I make a lot of things gluten free and this is the worst I have ever tried.

Serious problem - almost no rise!  It was gummy except at the far edges so couldn't eat much of it.  As the recipe didn't say if xanthan gum was in the g-f flour blend, I added 1 teaspoon.  Could that have been the problem?  (The baking powder was fresh so that wasn't the problem.)  Some blends include xanthan gum while others don't.   Disappointing.

It was great and the only change I made was add some vanilla to cake and filling.  Never too much vanilla!  My granddaughter has severe celiac so it was fun to make a dessert that was actually good.

This cake is fabulous! I made this recipe exactly as written except I baked it in a single bundt pan instead of 2 loaf pans. I still baked it 60 minutes. It has a light crunch on the outside, and the inside is creamy, almost custard like. Wonderful!

This cake was really good, reminded me a little of pumpkin bread bumped up a notch. I added pumpkin spice to the cream cheese filling. I will be making this cake again, especially since my whole family loved it.
