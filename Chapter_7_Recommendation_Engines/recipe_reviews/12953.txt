I used this recipe as a solid base to create my own personal version. I used only jalepeno pepper for both taste and a little heat. I also blended in cilantro, lime, some raw carrot and a little cream cheese with the potato/broth mixture. I'm a big fan of garlic, so I chopped up several cloves to simmer with the onions. I can't tell you how fantastic this turned out. I even froze some for later, and am eating it now as I type. Still tastes amazing. Never be  afraid to get off the beaten track of your recipe and do your own thing :)

An excellent and flavorful soup.  I've made it several times without the meat and substituting water for the broth for a vegetarian alternative.  I also added several cloves of garlic and extra red and green and also yellow pepper.  Yummy every time, thanks!

SO GOOD!  The only thing I changed was to use 2% milk instead of cream (it worked just fine) and smoked sausage we buy locally, instead of ham.  (not much of a ham fan)  The flavors were great, this is a real comfort food!

My husband said, "That's potato soup!"  I did not puree the potatoes as we like a little more chunky consistancy, and they were already falling apart a bit anyway.  Wonderful flavor and so comforting on a cold, rainy night!

This soup was ok. For me the ham didn't really fit into the Tex Mex flavors. My bf said it tasted like someone from Wisconsin tried to do a southwestern soup. I think I'll do this again with a little shrimp in place of the ham.

Good, spicy soup.  Used smoked sausage as suggested.  I'll leave the potatoes chunkier next time.

This is good and very filling. I like the spice of it; the peppers add a really bright flavor to this creamy soup.

A delicious, easy soup. I would be interested in trying it with bacon instead of ham next time.
