As catfish goes, this was a good base recipe.  In the future I would use more salt and perhaps add some granulated garlic to boost the flavor.  The amount of oil needed was way overestimated.  In my cast iron skillet, I was able to fry up all the fish in just 1 cup of oil!

YUMMY I will make these again and again. I didn't have time to marinate them but I will next time. I dipped them in some Mom's Dill Sauce left over from salmon patties.

I thought that this was just ok. The mustard gave it kind of a funky taste to me.

I made it, it was super easy and tastes pretty good. I am not a huge fish fan but I like a varied diet and it hit the spot. The only thing I substituted was nuggets instead of fillets farm raised from the local market.
