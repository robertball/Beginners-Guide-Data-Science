I make a version of this smoothie everyday for breakfast.  It's quick, yummy and keeps me going all morning.  My version for one 16 oz. serving is: 6 oz. vanilla fat-free yogurt, 1/2-1 banana,  1/2 c. strawberries, 1/3 c. blueberries, all cut in chunks.  Any or all fruit can be frozen (if you don't have any frozen fruit, use a couple of ice cubes)  If you need to thin it out, use any juice, milk or soymilk to desired consistency.  I need to add flax to my diet, so I also toss in 1 T golden flaxseeds.  For a change of pace, substitute any fresh fruit such as peaches, kiwi, cantaloupe, raspberries, etc., and use any yogurt flavor you prefer.  Tip:  Fruits with a thin skin, such as peaches, apples, nectarines and such don't need to be peeled first, just cut into chunks.  Benefits ~ added fiber and all of the nutrients the fruit has to offer.

The potential problem with this smoothie is it makes 6 servings and I don't know about anyone else, but it's not that often that I make smoothies for six. Turns out this one scales down quite easily though. I scaled it for 3 servings and it was actually more like 2, but the ingredients were fairly easily measured out so no tweaking was neccesary (which sometimes skews the results and makes a recipe hard to review accurately). We really enjoyed this smoothie. Sweet enough without added sugar and with just enough tang. You can't really taste the berries, (hence the 4 stars) mainly the pineapple/orange, but it was delicious nonetheless.

I work in a Juice Bar and I'm always looking to try new concoctions to try in my down time, and this one was wonderful.  No sugar either.  Very good.

Very good! I made this for breakfast and used fat free vanilla yogurt.  I had fresh pineapple so I used the juice from that and threw in a tiny bit of pineapple as well. Thick and delicious!

Nice medley of flavors, however, this isn't something I'd often be able to make exactly as directed as this was a rare occasion that I had all the ingredients called for.  The orange/pineapple combination wasn't exactly my favorite with the strawberries and blueberries, and I would have preferred this with a little Splenda.  Hubs, on the other hand, liked it just as is.  Using frozen berries helped make this particularly thick and icy cold.

I've been making this - or a variation thereof - for years. It's great breakfast staple. The pineapple juice adds the sweetness, and the bananas add the body/texture, but any ingredient can be substituted. It's a great way to get my family to take in stuff they might not like on their own too. For example, I always whirr in a bit of flax seed oil for my husband. And with a scoop of protein powder, it will hold you 'til lunch.

Not bad!  I had to do a bit of subbing--no blueberries or pineapple juice, but I did have pineapple chunks and peach juice, so I put that in instead.  None of my fruit was frozen, but I'm not a big fan of really cold smoothies anyway, so it worked great.  Both bf and I liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this as is, except that my banana was also frozen.  (All the better since I like them good and cold.)  Most things with a fair amount of blueberry always taste sort of grapey to me so I tend to like them.  This was good, though not necessarily my favorite.  And it's very easy to mix up smooth, which is always a bonus.  This will be going in my regular line-up.  I have to agree that it doesn't really make the servings it says.  I'd say more like 4, relative to what most recipes end up calling a 'serving' anyway.

Not our favorite, but still very good.  I didn't have any pineapple juice, so just used all OJ.  I also omitted the banana per my kids' request.  Overall, another great smoothie that we've tried this summer.

This was really good. I scaled the recipe down by half, which said it made 3 servings, but it was more like two. I used Orange-Pineapple juice instead of OJ and Pineapple juice separately, and I used frozen banana instead of fresh to make it a little thicker. I also added a little extra banana because when I blended it up at first, it seemed a bit too thin. But other than that, everything was the same. Great flavor and no extra sugar or sweetener needed, in my opinion.

Yummy. Got my final adjustment for braces and had to wear rubber bands and 2 power chains plus a double wire. The pain is surreal. Tried this and it chilled the pain while I was eating. #braces

Very basic and easy. I made it with frozen strawberries and blueberries, peach juice instead of orange juice. Cut the ingredients in half for one serving size and it was perfect.
