Rather than opening a can of coconut milk, I used the boxed soy coconut milk which I already had open in the fridge, vanilla Greek yogurt, skipped the 1% milk, and added some crushed ice for a thicker texture.  My peaches actually were Georgia peaches which I bought yesterday, and they were perfectly ripe.  This was a really creamy smoothie bursting with peach flavor, and was so yummy, I felt like I was having dessert for breakfast.  Thanks, Megan, this is a winner smoothie.
