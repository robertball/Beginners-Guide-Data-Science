i've made this twice - once with mayo, once with evoo, and found i actually prefer the mayo version.  maybe it's just personal taste, but the evoo version seemed less flavorful to me, and i think i'm partial to the creaminess.  i used fat free mayo, so as not to ruin the nutritional value of the veggies.

My family and I are big salad people and this was really good. I added 2 hard boiled eggs for more protein and it turned out great! I will definitely be making this again in the near future!

Tuna Black Bean Salad Haiku: "This IS refreshing. Nice change from tuna mayo. I'll make this again!" Just finished eating this for lunch and it's left the most pleasant, light taste in my mouth. I decreased the EVOO, and used jalapenos instead of serrano; otherwise, made it as written, and served it wrapped in a lettuce leaf. I like the idea that I can leave this in the fridge and grab a spoonful here or there for a healthy lunch. I may even wrap it in a warm tortilla with pepperjack cheese later.

Made this tonight and turned out great! Didn't have a Serrano pepper, so I used some cayenne pepper to add the needed kick. I also used much less oil than what was called for...just two tbsp. to try and cut back on the fat. I used the juice of one lime. Very fresh and light; quick to make too!

Use a can of Tuna in oil...DON'T drain.  Then you can pass on both EVOO or Mayo.  Really boosts the flavor.

I would make this again, but it's nothing to email home about (and I've done that before.) Of course, I changed it a bit. (all part of the fun) Added corn. Served in flour tortillas. Unfortunately, I ran out of olive oil midway through making this. Was only able to put in about 1/9 of a cup. Oh well. It was still pretty good. A great way to get some protein and a few servings of veggies.

Overall, this recipe was pretty good. My boyfriend loved it. It is a great cool recipe for hot summer days. I will probably make this recipe again, but I would change one thing. For me, the serrano pepper was too hot, and kind of ruined the flavors with it's spicy flavor. However, aside from that, it was good.

This was a nice refreshing wrap for a hot summer day.  I changed a couple things...I only added half the amount of olive oil, added some cheddar cheese and rolled it all in a flour tortilla.  I also added minced garlic in place of the onion.  Yummy!

After tasting the bean/tuna mix plain I decided to serve it with some lightly parmesan covered penne instead of inside lettuce wraps.  The pasta gave it some much needed texture and the cheese more of a bite, but it still didn't come together for us.

Loved having something different for lunches.  I made with the ingredients as listed, but did not add all the olive oil.  I just drizzled it on until I had the ingredients as wet as I wanted them.  I didn't bother to seed my tomatoes, so that added extra moisture.  This kept well in the refrigerator for two days.  This will be a good recipe for packed lunches when school starts up again.
