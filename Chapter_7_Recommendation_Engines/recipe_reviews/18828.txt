I liked this recipe. It was easy to make once I poached the turkey. I used fresh dill instead of tarragon, red wine vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, and added a bit more olive oil and mayo (1/2 Tbs) than recipe stated.

Needs more dressing for my taste, especially more vinegar. But with adjustments, it was a very good way to use up leftover turkey.
