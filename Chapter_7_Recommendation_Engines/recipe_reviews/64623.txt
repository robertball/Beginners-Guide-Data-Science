I tried this recipe on 4/9/04. I pre-cooked my rice and then added it, the bouillon and enough water to the rest of the mixture to finish cooking. I also added green peas. It looked good and tasted good.

This recipie was exactly what I was looking for to complete a 'greek' themed meal. The ingredients could be switched around easily to add or subtract different vegetables, I used canned bouillion instead of water and cubes.

I used this recipe a few days ago and it was magnificent! It turned just like the picture. I used powdered Chicken Flavored Bouillon instead of the cubes and it still came out good. It goes very well with chicken. I will make it again soon.
