This dinner went over well with my family and dinner guests. I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for four hours. Just before serving I removed from slowcooker and placed the chicken on a baking sheet and broiled. This browned the skin and added a nice crispness to the chicken. The inside remained juicy and full of flavour. I did add a little cinnamon and soysauce to the ingredients. Turned out perfect. This is a keeper!

Very good chicken recipe.  I used 5 frozen chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and let it cook for 4-5 hours. I also substituted ckn broth for the water and added basil as well. Turned out great, was really easy and I would definitely make it again!

This chicken came out sooooo tender and juicy!  I sauteed the onion and garlic in butter before I put it in the crock pot.  Instead of the water, I used chicken broth.  I rubbed a little lemon pepper on the chicken.  The flavors were very good, the lemon was nicely subtle and the rosemary was fragrant.  Thanks for the recipe!

Disappointing recipe.  Flavor very bland and boring.  I cooked it the minimum time suggested, and it was very overcooked.  Will not make again.

DELICIOUS! Everyone loved this recipe -- only thing I changed was to rub some lemon pepper seasoning on it! Very nice as a change from your usual roasted chicken. I made gravy with the liquid afterwards and it was the best ever (just thickened it with some flour, no need to add any flavourings). Thanks very much for this recipe!

The meat fell easily off the bones and was very tender, juicy; although pretty bland. Couldn't taste the lemon at all, even though I added lemon zest to it as well. I left out the celery and added baby carrots instead. Carrots turned out wonderful. Had mashed potatoes as a side dish. 
There is a LOT of broth left over. Will probably make a soup with left overs. Maybe leave out the cup of hot water and add juice of a second lemon instead. (I used a 6qt Rival Crockpot, btw)

I fixed this roast chicken in the oven and it was quite good.  I don't like slimy chicken from the crockpot and my homerasied birds are way too big to go in one anyway.  I basically followed the directions except I mixed the onions, lemon juice, and spices all together in a bowl and added olive oil. I put the juiced lemons inside the bird with the apple and celery.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic to the inside and outside of the bird.  Every hour or so I flipped the chicken over in the pan.  It took about 3 1/2 hours to cook it at 350* and turned out great.  I offered the juices to the kids but they didn't like them.  I thought they were ok but nothing to rave about-glad I didn't thicken it for gravy.  I will use this method again for roast chicken.

I just read some reviews on this after making this one time per week per my family's request. This is so easy, flavorful and moist. It is one of the best recipes that I have ever received. You must try it!

This chicken turned out great.  I used fresh rosemary, Italian parsley, a few leaves of basil, a whole garlic (top sliced off, skin on), lemon and olive oil in the cavity of the chicken.  Celery, onions, fresh minced garlic, a half a lemon quartered and some cooking sherry in the bottom of the crock.  Patted the dried chicken with salt and cracked black pepper. Instead of browning the chicken before cooking, I put the chicken in an appropriate sized pan and broiled in the oven (on lowest rack) at 450 degrees AFTER it was done in the slow cooker.  If you choose to do this, check the chicken after 5 minutes so the skin does not burn. The chicken was wonderful -- moist and flavorful!!!

This is my first attempt at a whole chicken! I used a few suggestions from other people. I did saute the onion w/ a few garlic cloves before putting it over the chicken. Also took the chicken broth instead of water suggestion. Did not have a real lemon so I substituted lemon juice. Keeping my fingers crossed! It smells great and I'm hoping to use leftovers to make lemon chicken orzo!

This was a really easy recipie. My family liked it. I put is in the oven at 325 for a couple of hours towards the end of cooking so that it would brown. When it cooks in the crock pot the skin looks raw. But even my eight year old liked it.

Due to the other "bland" reviews we did the following:  Run your hand between the skin and meat of the chicken on both sides, loosening the skin from the meat(making like a little pocket).  Rub a little salt and pepper on your hands and rub over the meat to season.  Place FRESH rosemary stems and lemon slices on the meat and then stretch the skin over and secure with a toothpick or two.  I cut tow lemons in half and placed inside the cavity instead of the veggies.  The flavor is very lemony with a nice hint of the rosemary.  The smell is wonderful!
Hope this helps!

Unvelievably delicious, unbelievably easy. 5 stars. 

I BAKED mine in the oven at 350 for over 2 hours with a foil tent to keep the moisture in. Perfect, I tell you. Perfect!

The apples were a hit.  Next time I'm putting more in and around the chicken. I used fresh rosemary snippets, so that was a bomb of a taste. I didn't have a lemon, so I used a lime. No biggie. 

Highly recommend.

This meal was very good.  I cooked it just like the recipe, however I placed it in the oven to brown for 20 minutes.  Very tender.

As I made this while I was away at work, I was unable to baste.  Basting may have helped.  I found the flavor of the chicken unremarkable.  My bird was still partially frozen this morning, so I had hoped that at 8 hours it would not be overdone, but alas, it was!  Aside from that, I skimmed the fat off the juice and thickened with cornstarch slurry, and liked the resultant lemony gravy.  Since I'd set the chicken on a layer of chunked baking potatoes (skin and all) gravy was a nice bonus.  The potatoes turned out to be the best part of this dish.  I suspect that I will not be making this again.  If I do, I will use my sister's trick -- a simple timer (like one used for a lamp) to turn the slow cooker on a little later in the day.

This was very bland and the chicken was overcooked. It seems like the only people giving it good reviews were the ones that changed the recipe.

Great recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water and put it under the broiler to brown it up as well.  I do agree that it was a bland, however I made gravy from the juices and combined with the gravy it was yummy.  Will make it again.

This one was okay.  It wasn't bland, but wasn't as flavorful as I like.  I would make it again, with some serious alterations.  My 2 year old liked it pretty well.

This did not turn out at all! I used chicken breasts, but besides that I followed the recipe. The recipe doesn't specify what type of apple. I  used a granny smith and the recipe turned out really sour. No one liked it. I have had lemon chicken in restaurants an the lemon is an accent flavor, the chicken would be good with out it...I think the overwhelming sourness here ruined the recipe. I ended up rinsing everything off and dumping some Alfredo sauce on and it still seemed too sour.

i made this chicken, but as i always do i have to add some extra things, like a clove or two of garlic inside the chicken, and chicken broth instead of the water. and the left overs do make good chicken sandwitches for school the next day.

An excellent recipe!  My family loved this chicken.  It was so flavorful without being overly spicy.  It wasn't bland at all.  Maybe the others just don't know a good recipe when they find one!  Highly recommended.

The flavor on this chicken was good - not great but better than just okay.  

Like some other reviewers, I used just chicken breasts and not a whole chicken.  I knew this would reduce the time but I didn't realize how much!  I had mine on low the whole time for 4 1/2 hours and it was slightly overdone.  If I do it again, I'll drop my time to 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  I'll also increase the lemon juice and might skip the apples (couldn't taste them on the chicken and didn't like the taste of them off the chicken).

got tons of compliments. i didn't have a whole chicken, so i cooked four thighs instead. i used a greek spice rub in addition to the salt and pepper for seasoning the chicken. also added one chopped green pear and some fresh oregano. it was delightful and smelled heavenly. served it on a bed of herbed rice.

I have to say - I have tried this recipe 3 times now - I love the smell, but the chicken always comes out so dry!  I have tried both lowering the temp & cooking longer, then raising the temp & cooking faster.  Both ways I end up with a lot of juice, but still a very dry chicken.  The chicken seems good for using in a soup base, but I have not had luck with this recipe by itself.  Sorry...

I didn't have fresh lemon, so I just poured some lemon juice over the top instead, but it worked very well.  This was very mild in flavor, but so moist and tender it fell off the bones!  There was a LOT of juice and meat left in the crockpot afterwards, so I plan to use that to make a tasty lemon rice chicken soup.

This recipe was very good.  I used 6 or 7 boneless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I sprinked some lemon pepper seasoning over the chicken after I put it in the crock pot and I used apple juice instead of water. The chicken was so good and tender!  This is a keeper!

I tried this recipe because my family loves chicken.  Lemon is an added bonus.  After making it the first time, I find I can't make it enough.  We had company over one evening and after the first bite, they wanted the recipe.  The chicken literally falls of the bone after cooking.  I go ahead and debone the chicken and serve it on a large platter.  It is wonderful served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Maybe the problem was I didnt use a whole chicken I used thighs... It was ok. I dont know... it kind of had an Adobo Chicken flavor, which isnt bad but I was expecting different...

The chicken was not dry at all. It fell right off the bone!  The flavor was mediocre, so I ended up using the chicken in a casserole.

I took the advise of other reviewers and modified the recipe using chicken broth instead of water, substituted rosemary sprigs inside the cavity instead of dried rubbed outside, seasoned inside and out with salt and pepper, and added two garlic cloves to the pot.  I also reduced the cooking time to one hour on high, then turned to low for 5 hours instead of the 6 to 8 hrs the recipe calls for.  The chicken was still overcooked and the taste was a little funny.  It was as if there was one flavor that just didn't belong.  It was edible, but not something I will make again.

Wonderful! I put half the apple, a bit of celery and 3 thick lemon wedges inside the bird. I then seasoned it with salt and pepper and put 3 sprigs of rosemary and 4 more lemon slices in the broth (used chicken broth instead of water). It was wonderful and, as others said, the broth made an excellent gravy. We had the chicken and gravy over rice and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again!

Although it is fragrant, this chicken doesn't have much flavor...it's about the same as if you boiled it.  I think it's just really hard to get flavor when you try to cook a whole chicken.

This is one nasty recipe!  Chicken was bland, and as soon as I tried to lift the bird out of the pot, it fell apart into one big pile of mush and bones. YECH!! Only good thing about this whole recipe is that it's easy.

This made the whole house smell great as it cooked through the day!  It went together quickly and made a nice meal. I thickened the juices with flour and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste and we had nice gravy to go along with the chicken and mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The best crock pot recipe I've ever tried!  The meat literally falls right off the bone.  I added an extra cooking apple, chopped for even a little more flavor.  Dee-licious!  I've passed this recipe on to everyone I know who likes to cook.

I adore the taste of flavorful lemon chicken but this wasn't it.  The chicken did come out fall-off-the-bone tender but also quite greasy and very, very bland.  I think more lemon juice should be added and maybe some garlic.  This chicken tasted like it had been boiled...there was very little lemon flavor and just a hint of rosemary.

This recipe is very tasty if you use a glas of wine instead the glass of water. I also used Mrs. Dash seasoning blend and this ads more flavor and color as well as the last minutes under the broiler.

We enjoyed this recipe, the chicken was very moist and tender, perfect to fix and have ready after work. For those who like more flavor, I halved some garlic cloves and rubbed the chicken skin with them, in addition to the salt and pepper—then diced it and added it with the onion.

I liked it. I put potatoes and carrots under the chicken and they turned out good. I had zested the lemon, squeezed the juices over the chicken and put in about half the lemon slices into the crock pot in response to some of the reviewers saying there was no flavour - and that was a little too lemony for me. Also, I used basil rather than rosemary and that was fine. Will make again.

I made this yesterday for my boyfriend.  I changed it a bit as per the reviewers suggestions.  I seasoned with lemon pepper under the skin and used carrots instead of celery.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of the water.  I did not zest the lemon but instead juiced it and put the juiced slices in the bird with the carrots and apples.  I also added potatoes that I mashed after it was done cooking.  I stuck in the oven at 350 for an hour at the end to make it pretty.  All in all Greg said he liked it, but that it was "way too lemony."  He did NOT care for the gravy, although he pretended to.  He gave it 4 stars "only because i don't lemon that much.  If you like lemon I would say 5."  Next time I will cut the lemon pepper a bit and use breasts.  Cooking a whole chicken was a huge pain.

The chicken in this recipe was very moist with lots of juices.  However, the taste was very bland!  I would suggest adding not only your apple and celery to the cavity but salt, pepper and lemon zest then place the chicken breast side down.  I would also add a chicken bouillon cube to the hot cup of water along with juice from the lemon and then sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper, celery salt and other ingreds listed in recipe.

Although very very tender and juicy, it was not very flavorful.  Did not care for the apples and celery, will try using carrots next time as someone earlier suggested.  Gave a wonderful aroma while cooking though.  Will try again, but with a few changes.

This was a big hit.  Easy to prepare before leaving for work.  Very flavorful.  Cooking time should be reduced as it makes it difficult to serve.

Tasted over-done in time given, just tasted boiled. Smelled good but tasted really flat. Rosemary was overwhelming. Probably wouldn't try again anytime soon. Too bland, except for rosemary.

really wonderful flavor! and lots of juices!

After we ate a dinner's worth, I threw it back into the crock with its juices and the ingredients for a chicken and wild rice soup...fantastic!!!  Next time I think I'll remove the meat from the bones first though ; )

This recipe really was fast and easy. About 15 minutes to prepare and in the crockpot all day. I will agree that it did need more spices though. Not enough flavor. But really tender, it went over great with my husband and my kids (even my toddler ate it!)

This was a great recipe!  I just threw everything into the crockpot on low in the morning and by earily evening, it was done.  I did use chicken breats, but it still turned out great.

I made this the other night for dinner, and I was not impressed. Yes, the meat fell off the bone along with the flavor. Based on what I read about this recipe, I used 2 lemons and lemon pepper. I also used a firm sweet-tart apple, a Pinata, because I didn't want applesauce inside the chicken. I found the Rosemary too overpowering a flavor, so I picked it out of my slow cooker. When it was done, I made my own gravy for it since it was too bland. Next time I'll roast the chicken with lemons.

Very moist but not alot of flavor on this one.  However - a great starter recipe.  Will make a fresh herb bundle next time with cloves of garlic and add to inside of chicken along with apple, celery, onions and lemon.  Then will broil the last 1/2 - 1 hr for a better skin.

I made this with Cornish hens. I decided to cook them in the oven as I LOVE crispy chicken skin, and it never turns  out well for me when cooked in the crockpot. I used lemon pepper, and would double the lemon juice/zest if I were to make this again. I served it with Roasted Garlic Mashed potatoes and plain fresh green beans - one of the best meals I've made in a long time. Thanks so much!

My family enjoyed this recipe but didn't rave about it.  I'll need to try it another day to see if they are more enthusiastic.  Take the usual care when adding the dried rosemary- don't add more than called for.  I defatted the cooking liquid and thickened it with cornstarch for a gravy.  Quick and easy recipe.

It's not a "wow!" recipe, but a very solid one.  My family liked it.  I will definitely make it again.  I used Chicken stock instead of water and I added chopped carrots and parsnips.  The apples did not hold up well at all.  They were basically mush.  Maybe if I used a different variety? (I had gala on hand).  Great crock pot basic.

Good.  I assume you did not mean a whole stalk of celery?  I used one rib and it seemed about right.  Leftover was good in chicken salad.

This was a little disappointing. The recipe was fragrant, but the sourness of the lemon wasn't really balanced by anything. I wound up making a sauce out of lemon, soy, worcestershire, ground ginger and honey. Very tangy, tasted really good. Yes, the meat fell off the bones, but that'll happen with almost any crockpot recipe, so no big points there. I chopped more than one apple with some onion, sauteed it first with garlic, then stuffed the chicken. Didn't have any celery and I don't think I missed it. Added some brown rice to the sauce once I took the chicken out, and got a good rice side dish to go with it. Not a bad recipe, but a bit more work than I generally look for in a crock pot recipe.

Smelled awesome while it was cooking, but tasted...eh. Good, but not as flavorful as I expected, given the aroma. It wasn't bad, just remarkably plain for all the ingredients.

This was really tastey.  The chicken just fell off the bone when it was finished.  Also, the leftovers are awesome for making chicken salad.  The lemon flavor really peps it up.

I did not like this recipe, and neither did my husband. Slow cooking the chicken was a great way to cook it, and it was very tender and juicy. However, we didn't like the general flavor. Next time, I'll look for a different spice combination.

While this chicken was very moist and fell right off the bone, it lacked in flavor.  The juices make an excellent gravy, so I made lots of it to give it more flavor.  Next time I will experiment with more and different seasonings.

The flavor was very good BUT using the whole chicken although it stayed very tender I found the meat fell off the bone so much that there were tons of little bones to contend with. It was delicious over rice and I will definatley use the recipe again, with boneless chicken though.

Had I not made the changes I did, I think this would have been very bland.  First, I purchased a lemon-pepper infused chicken.  Second, I used the lemon juice but chose not to use the zest (peel) and rubbed all the required spices underneath the skin of the chicken. Third, instead of using water, I used 1c chicken broth and finally, I baked the bird in the oven the last 2 hours so that the skin browned (even though we don't normally eat the skin - it made it look prettier). Overall, this dish was good - but its success is in part to my changes.

My family really liked the chicken, very moist.  It could use more spices, and perhaps remove the bones first.  I served with fresh biscuits and mashed potatoes.  They all loved the broth in their potatoes.

This isn't a bad recipe - but you need to add some seasoning to it.  No one could
eat it without soy sauce and barbecue or ketchup.  It seems to come out a little bit dry,
too.  Next time I will try to break up the chicken first, so that it is all in the liquid.

This was a very easy recipe - since the flavor is not very strong, it is excellent for when a family member is feeling ill and just needs something on the bland side.

When I made this chicken in my crockpot it came out dry and not very flavorful. It was easy to make and it fell right off the bone but just no flavor.

It was very good, but there are so many chicken choices I think we will explore more before making this again.  I did substitute the yellow onion with a large red onion as they have more flavor.  I

this was a change of pace. Usually chicken to me means teriyaki, Asian, or Mexican. This was very flavorful. The lemon really gave this chicken a very nice, surprisingly deep flavor. I didn't use a whole chicken, I used 4 large thighs. It probably would be better if I used a whole chicken. The broth you get at the end is great, too!

Made a really good chicken. Didn't rate full 5 stars because the time left the meat a little dry.

Have yet to eat it....
Fragrant is right!  1 whole onion is too much, makes our eyes water every time I baste!  I was in a rush so set the crock pot to 4 hours on high, but it's not done yet.  I got a very low reading on my meat thermometer.  So I guess I'll put it on low & let it cook all night.  Smells good, looks tender, sounds good over rice if the onions ever get tender.  Hoping for the best here!

I only had a 6 pound chicken, and it wouldn't fit in my crock pot.  I baked it instead, so I don't think the flavors blended like they should/would have.  It was very good still, and had a pretty presentation.

My hubby and picky 5-year-old daughter both loved it!  My daughter said it was the best chicken she ever had!  It was very easy and the chicken was tender and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used a bigger roaster and used the leftovers to make a chicken pie. The bites of apple were an added treat. Would make it again.

I always say I'm going to use my crock-pot.  Now I have a reason why.  This is great.  I substituted basil for the rosemary and it was excellent!
