This is truly an excellent method. Don't let the sodium potential scare you off. The salt crust peels away and isn't consumed. I have been using a method close to this one taught to me by my Sicilian family for 20 years. The only difference being I've never added flour. I chose to use gilthead instead of red snapper. I used gluten free flour. The crust is hard as a rock. This makes it difficult to break, but once broken, it peels off in chunks and takes the skin off with it; leaving you with less work and no little pieces of salt on your fish. It renders tender and succulent filets easy to remove and serve quickly. Without the flour, you have to scrape the salt aside and then peel the fish. Inevitably, you get a lot of salt in the fish. I will begin to use this method from now on. I do suggest adding herbs and a lemon slice inside the fish before covering with salt. It adds some subtle flavor. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I donâ€™t like fish that much, but my husband does. When he brought home a whole red snapper I was determined to do something delicious with it. This recipe saved me! I had no idea what I was doing so I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was very easy and even I ate it which is saying a lot!
