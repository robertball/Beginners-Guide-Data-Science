Now a tradition at our table! Thanks to all of the reviewers too - I heeded advice and cut back the white sugar to 1/3 cup and brown sugar to 2/3 cup which cut back on the sweetness.  Hint for easy cooking of potatoes, just peel and then boil like regular white potatoes.  No need to boil and them try to coax them out of their jackets the hard way :)

This is a great recipe for sweet potato casserole. I found that 1/4 cup of sugar in the potato mixture is enough for my family's sweet tooth since the topping adds more sweetness. A secret for those who do not like "stringy" sweet potatoes...use a mixer to combine the sweet potatoes and other ingredients.  All the strings from the sweet potatoes wrap around the beaters, so don't scrape them after mixing.

UPDATE PT II: My version equates 3 cups of cooked yams to the 5 yams of undetermined size/weight noted in the original recipe.   UPDATE: I read some earlier reviews about the "sweetness" of this recipe.  I normally pick out 5 of the largest yams I can find.  Used garnet yams before and used Beauregard yams this last time. It came out the same.  This nukes well and is easily pre-made.  I had enough yams to fill 2 loaf pans almost to the rim, but it came out a little soft (like baby food).  So, in this case, I would have added an extra egg to give it extra firmness.  Last time it was was just enough to fill 2 loaf pans 3/4 full and 2 eggs gave it enough firmness.  Splenda for the yams and brown-sugar splenda for the topping worked well.  ===================  I've been attempting various sweet potato dishes for the last few years from this site because other family members expect some sweet potato dish during Thanksgiving.  They all came out similar to most sweet potato dishes we've tried in the past.  Nothing made us go, "Hmmmmm....sweet potatoes?"    I made two alterations to this recipe. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and I nuked this dish instead of baking it in the oven (there wasn't room due to the turkey).  It is the first time in my home that a dish of sweet potatoes was fought over.  There was little left over and everyone wanted some to take home.    Anyhow, this dish came out creamy (like good mashed potatoes consistency), wasn't overly sweet, and it turned

Excellent recipe, followed other users suggestions and added less sugar.  I also used 2 big cans of yams instead of fresh potatoes (much less work) and replaced the cream with skim milk and I couldn't imagine it being better!

I use a lighter variation to this recipe. Have for a few years now and it is such a HUGE hit, it is officially my job to make the sweet potatoes at the holiday get togethers. I do use one egg to add firmness. I also use 2% milk instead of cream and lite butter. There are really no other ways to cut down the fat or sugar but these tips do save some fat grams. I got the recipe from cooking light but can not remember the numbers it saves. Anyway, this is so good, I hope everyone tries and enjoys as much as our family does. God Bless!

I thought all sweet potato cassaroles were the same, but this is so good.  I used canned sweet potatoes because I didnt want to mess with all that cooking and peeling.  The topping was delicious, this is is the only sweet potato recipe I will be using from now on.  Everyone asked for the recipe when I made it for Christmas :-)

Wow.  I assembled this for Thanksgiving on Tuesday, traveled 7 hours Wednesday, baked and served it Thursday.  It was fabulous.  Having it prepared in advance helped me get the meal on the table all at once.  And my father, who 'compliments the chef' but NEVER specifically points out a dish told me to give my mother the recipe!!  My husband loved the pecans.  Both said it was not too sweet as many sweet potato casseroles can be.

excellent!  I make it both for holidays and for simple family dinners.  I usually leave out the butter and cream in the sweet potato mixture and it still tastes great but has less fat.

I used brown sugar instead of white (cut it in half for my taste) and added nuts to the potatoes as well as the topping. Went over great at a big luncheon and a family gathering. Thanks!

A great recipe!  The topping was my favorite part.  I used canned potatoes and I thought it was a little dry.  Next time I will add a little more white sugar and possibly more cream.  Other than this, it was great.  I am a big fan of sweet potatoes.

This is simply delicious!! I've made it MANY times when invited out for dinner, and every time I am asked for the recipe. I make it exactly as directed and it always turns out wonderfully. One thing that I do add, which is always a crowd pleaser, is a pecan-sweet potato flower or two on the top. I save about 2 tablespoons of the bright orange mashed sweet potato (before you add all the goodness) and put it to one side. Once the casserole is made and is in the baking dish, I top the crumble with the dollop of sweet potato formed into a circle, like the center of a flower. Then I use pean halves to form the flower petals that I place around the circle. I usually make two of these flowers and people just LOVE them. It's funny. Watch your guests... no one wants to be the one to ruin the pretty flower, so it's often the last piece to be scooped out. :-)

Another great recipe.  I have made this recipe dozens of times now and it is always a hit.  I use 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans and 1 cup brown sugar in the topping.  I use fresh yams and cook them in their skins in the microwave on the Baked Potato setting.  I then let them cool for about an hour before removing the skins.  Makes it much easier. I now prepare and bake this recipe the day before serving.  It reheats in the microwave as good or better than when it first comes out of the oven.  Great timesaver when you are preparing Thanksgiving dinner and have limited oven space.   This last time I made the recipe I used Ore Ida's Steam & Mash Sweet Potatoes (2 pkgs).  It saved some time and didn't diminish the flavor.

This is absolutely the best!! One hint.. sweet potatoes have alot of natural sugars so if you roast them at 450 for 40+ minutes they will become very soft; the outside dark and be very sweet. If you use a potato ricer it removes all of the strings and then taste prior to adding any sugar. The 1/4 - 1/2 c. depending on the quantity of potatoes will be plenty. ENJOY! I promise they will come back for seconds.

Excellent...I have made it several times and it has become a requested recipe at family gatherings.  Make sure you use real sweet potatoes & not canned.  BAKE them in the oven first...don't boil! That's the key to making this the best ever sweet potato casserole. Splenda works wonderfully in this.  I have used straight Splenda and also made it 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar.  You can also safely cut down on sugar & not affect the outcome of the taste.  I usually do it half with nuts and half without so everyone's preference is covered.  Thanks for a great recipe. It can be tweeked to your needs and wants.

So delicious!  Made it gluten and dairy free without altering it much at all.  Used Smart Balance instead of butter and some finely ground oats in place of the flour in the topping and Almond milk in place of the cream.  The seasoning in the potatoes is perfect.  I did cut back a little bit on the sugar (I used brown). I baked the potatotes until they were super soft and used a mixer to mash to eliminate the strings! SUPERB!

What a hit! I went with canned sweet potatoes and it turned out perfect. Word of the wise 3 cans of 29oz chunks does the trick!

As with many members I don't like reading reviews when they didn't follow the recipe as written.  I'd rather hear they made it as written, and then the second time they made it they adjusted it to their taste.  This Sweet Potato Casserole can be served for dessert!  I made it last year for Xmas (as writeen), it was excellent, but yes it was too sweet for our family.  This Thanksgiving (I'm Canadian so falls in October) I made it again, as it was requested by a few family members.  I did cut down on the sugar and made the topping as written...this Xmas I will be making again as it is now demanded!  I will have to cut down on the sugar in the topping also...cutting down on the sugar is just personal preferance...we like to eat it with our meal, and it is too sweet for that.  The recipe as written, is really good, but I prefer to eat it alone if made like that...all in all, even if you don't like sweet potato, try this!  It will change your mind!  Excellent recipe & thank you!

Excellent recipe and a valuable lesson from my son! I almost always follow a new recipe exactly and then if I want to make adjustments I'll do so the next time I make it. Well I made these last year, but as I looked at the recipe I thought "oh no, we don't need all of that sugar" So I cut the white sugar in half and totally left out the brown sugar. Everyone thought they were pretty good. Well this year my son made them. He too altered the recipe, but only slightly. He used both sugars and when measuring, he used just slightly less than called for. When everyone tried them they raved and wondered what I had done differently this year. I had to confess that my son made them and he followed the recipe much closer than I did. The brown sugar really took the recipe over the top. I will go back to following the recipe the first time and then alter if I think I have to. Great recipe Heather, thanks so much.

I halved the sugar in the potaoes, and it was still too sweet for my family.  The topping was good though, but my husband said he'd rather have it on coffee cake.  Easy to make and with some tweaking could be great, just not a recipe for us.

I love this recipe. I usually cut the amounts in half because I'm only making it for 2 people. And the only thing about it that I change is the amount of sugar. I don't add any sugar at all to the sweet potatoes when I mash them and I only add about 1/4 of a cup to the topping. It comes out perfect every time. Like creamy, sweet mashed potatoes with a slightly sweet, nutty taste that doesn't over power the dish. I made this for my husband and I didn't think I'd like it. I could not have been more wrong. We both love it.

This was fine! I baked it in a 9 x 13, but think a smaller dish would have been a lot better, or add more the sweet potato amount!

I made the potatoes a day ahead of time and let sit out of the refrigerator 30 min. before baking while I prepared topping. Excellent leftovers.

This was a big hit over the holidays.  I found it much easier to bake the yams, open them, then scoop them out.  I had really, really large yams, so it only took about two of them to give me the amount I needed. It even works well without the pecans.

"Pour this in a pie crust and bake it as sweet potato pie!"  That was my mom's reaction.  My mom has used almost the same recipe for years, except she uses the jumbo cans of jams (two cans).  This is absolutely delicious.  I weighed our sweet potatoes and three large sweet potatoes were a little over 4 pounds (so, I only used three potatoes- five would have been a little over 7 pounds).  I cut back the white sugar to 1/3 c and the brown sugar to 2/3 c.  I also baked the sweet potatoes at 400 degrees for 70 minutes (first pierce several times with a fork, then wrap in aluminum foil), allowed to cool slightly and then peeled back their skins.  Heather, this is outstanding!  I also love how you recommend using a large pan (so that you get more of the crumb topping) vs. a standard casserole dish.  Thank you again Heather!

This is great!  Suggestion: try cutting potatoes into 1 inch cubes, cover with foil and bake.  Cubed potatoes really appealed to my not so open minded family much more than the mashed blob.

Everyone at Thanksgiving kept asking who made the sweet potato casserole.  It was a huge hit!  I was told that this is the dish I have to bring every year.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and have been "forced" to make it for every holiday since. Everyone loves it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Wouldn't change a thing.

One word: YUM. I used 2 cans of sweet potatoes instead of baking them. It took out all the work and you didn't miss a thing in taste. Next time, I may add some oatmeal to my topping, but other than that, superb.

WOW, WOW!!  Thank you so much for sharing this, it was wonderful, WONDERFUL!!  Now, for the review part:
I made this recipe exactly as written. Next time I will make the following changes, I will go ahead and peel and make the sweet potatoes in the microwave.  My potatoes ended up in the over for over an hour and still were not soft enough to be mashed, so I burned the heck out of my fingers trying to peel them and ended up putting the peeled potatoes in the microwave anyway.  Save yourself some time (and burn ointment!) and just peel them and put them in the microwave, steam them until you can easily get a fork all the way through to make your life easier when you mash them.  This receipe was also SUPER SWEET.  Next time I will actually probably double the pecans used and halve the brown sugar, but play with it, just know if you make it as is that it is going to be mighty sweet (really good though).

Very good.  I would suggest trying your best to get potatoes that are medium size not too large(not very sweet) or too small( overly sweet). I processed my potatoes in the processor after baking( I hate strings). I put my pecans in the food processor making them very fine before mixing with the sugar topping, I also added an extra 1/4 cup of finely processed pecans to the sweet potatoes. I also sprinkled a few marshmellows on top.  My guests went back for seconds and thirds. I was told that it was better than Boston Markets sweet potatoe cassarole!

This is the best sweet potato recipe I have ever tried!  This has just the right amount of sweetness (sweet is good!) and a beautiful color with the caramelized pecans on top.  Consistency is also great!  I made 4 servings (2 large and 1 small sweet potato) by boiling the peeled, cut up sweet potatoes for 30 minutes and then using a mixer to blend the ingredients together.  I used 2/3 of both the white and brown sugar and the sweetness turned out great.  My wife, a true sweet potato connoisseur, agrees…these are the best!

Loved this recipe and so did all my guests!!  The flavor combo is perfect!! I hate to make a complaint, but it did take my potatoes almost 90 minutes of roasting at 350 degrees to get to have them soft enough to mash??

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME! I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A GREAT YAM/SWEET POTATO RECIPE FOREVER AND I'VE FINALLY FOUND THE RECIPES OF MY DREAMS! IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST EVER! WHEN MASHING THE SWEET POTATOES, BE SURE TO WHIP THEM UP WITH A BEATER! NO CHUNKS ALLOWED! ADD A LITTLE MILK WHEN MASHING/WHIPPING TO MAKE IT EASIER! ALSO, I ENDED UP BAKING THE SWEET POTATOES LONGER THAN THE SUGGESTED TIME SO PLAN AHEAD JUST IN CASE! THIS CAN EASILY BE MADE AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN WARMED UP RIGHT BEFORE SERVING TOO! I WILL BE USING THIS RECIPE FOR BOTH THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS FOR NOW ON! IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST EVER!

Holycow!!!!!!
I used less sugar, regular milk instead of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, walnuts, and raisin bran without raisins, crushed, and 1/2 cup coconut for the topping.
Everybody loved it, even my sisters fussy family!!!!!
I haven't made this in some time. I had leftover prepared sweet potato filling(maple syrup added) from Xmas and had leftover coconut milk to get rid of so I added that with some extra coconut in and for the top.
I love this recipe and I see many others do too!

Very tasty.  My husband even whispered, "I think this beats grandma's recipe" to me.  I cut the sugar in HALF and omitted the topping because of allergies.

I have to be on diet with only fresh fruit and vegetables. This fits into it. Bake the sweet potatoes never boil. Takes away nutrients and they are easier to pop out of the cover. I mixed the sweet potato mixture in a food processor came out smooth with no strings. Cut back on the sugars, it was sweet with the complete amount. Use the Splenda versions for the white (1/3 cup) and brown sugar (2/3 cup), whole wheat flour or ground oatmeal for the white flour, skim milk for heavy cream and light butter or margarine. My husband is a heart patient and I am a diabetic it works and no one else knows the difference. They always want to take some home if there are any left overs. Thanks for the recipe.

I used skim for heavy cream, Splenda for both white and brown sugar, and Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend for the butter.  I also used canned sweet potatoes, as I had a time crunch. I'm extremely picky about how "lowfat" and "sweeteners" make things taste.  If it alters a recipe in the least, then I'll use nothing but the real thing the next time I make it.  Honestly, I could not tell a difference in this recipe.  If you have the substitutes, use them!!  It will cut down considerably on the fat and calories.

Tasted great, but the potatoes took FOREVER to cook!  They were still kind of crunchy after 3 hours in the oven.  That was after I pre baked them!

I cooked the sweet potatoes as said in recipe, however it should be stated that if you have large sweet potatoes it will take more like an hour for them to bake. Overall, turned out veryy good!

i know you dont need anymore reviews as they are all sounding alike...LOL but this was delish.  Had a gang of sweet potatoes so decided to try this.  followed directions mostly but rough chopped sweet potatoes after peeling and boiling, with my potato masher.  used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 t. of stevia extract.  added some pumpkin pie spice also.  Used 1/2 c brown sugar on top and added 1/2 cup of coconut to topping....just like dessert.   thanks for sharing..PS  I would try this for a pie filling also or a layered custard with some cookie crumbs or leftover cake layer parfait style....YUMISH

Great recipe....I used 3 sweet potatoes and 3 yams and it came out amazing.  I also whip the potatoes for a smooth, creamy dish and leave out the cinnamon (just a family prefrence).  Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!

I wish there were six stars for this one.  It was fantastic.  I used the yellow sweet potatoes rather than the red yams and it was great.  I made it 3 days ahead and it still turned out perfectly.

My family LOVES this recipe and requests it at Christmas and Thanksgiving every year. It's not too sweet, and has a great texture.
I've found that I have to double the ingredients to fill a 9 x 13 pan. That way when we cut it in squares, they're a little thicker.
And it's true, you can use canned sweet potatoes, or boil them, or microwave them, and it's still good. But it does get that roasty good flavour when you bake them in the oven. ;)

This is definately a winner!  I have to disagree about the sweetness that some people talked about.  I made it as the recipe called for except that I peeled and boiled the potatoes instead of baking them and I doubled the recipe.  I don't think it was too sweet.  I thought it was wonderful.  Rave reviews from everyone.  It will definately be added to our holiday menu.

OMG!!! YUM!!! This is the BEST sweet potato casserole I have ever eaten. If I could give it more stars I would. It was super EASY to make. You could even make it in advance and it will be just as yummy. Only thing I changed was reduced the amount of sugar (1/3c white & 2/3c brown). Perfect amount of sweetness. The pecans gave it a wonderful crunch and additional flavor. No more marshmellows for me.

We have been making this in my family for years.  I always use canned sweet potatoes - much easier !! My mom also sometimes adds coconut into the sweet potato mixture and the topping - delish !!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a handful of mini marshmallows on the top because my husband had to have them. The marshmallows were good because it made the topping kind of sticky. I made it for Thanksgiving and my entire family loved it and my sister-in-law just called for the recipe. Thank you so much for this recipe- I will never go back to the old way I used to make sweet potatoes.

This really is a sweet potato recipe that people who don't like sweet potatoes will eat. My niece's husband HATES sweet potatoes but he actually asked for this recipe after I made it for them.

Great recipe but I boiled the potatoes instead of 
baking. Also added pumpkin pie spice and orange marmalade instead of sugar.  Yummy!

Delicious recipe. I baked the potatoes in the oven wrapped in foil at 400F for about an hour. I was roasting chicken so I used 400F for baking these at the same time. I made life simple and didn't bother to peel them. With such thin skins I don't think anyone will ever know. Saves time and effort. I hand mashed them with milk instead of heavy cream and left out the sugar in the potato mixture. They are already fragrant from the cinnamon and vanilla. Trust me they will be plenty sweet once the topping is added. My potato mixture filled a 13 x 9 so I made extra topping to cover them generously. I put back in the oven for 30 minutes, still at 400F. So easy to make.

This recipe is very good but I made some changes to it .I used 4 cups mashed sweet potatoes that about  1 large 16oz. can and part of 1 small can of Bruce's yams,1/2cup milk not 2 tbsps. 1/2 tsp. salt not 1/4 tsp. The rest of this recipe stayed the same.I baked it for 45 minutes, uncovered. My family and friends ask for this dish at every gathering. Wonderful!! Thanks for the recipe.

My brother in law is "Bubba" & you don't get more southern than him. He said my sweet potato casserole was wonderful, so I'm taking that as a compliment to an original recipe by Heather. :) I've never understood why SPC is always a side & not a dessert but it is GOOD n' sweet.

very easy sweet potato dish.  I used roasted sweet potatoes (they're so easy, and more flavorful). On a whim, I crumbled up Gingersnaps in the topping, and subbed oatmeal for Pecans (didn't have any pecans).  I'd make it just the same next time!  Yum!

Oh my word!!!!  I would give this twenty stars if I could.  I have never had sweet potatoes before and have nothing to compare this to, BUT I literally dreamt about this after Thanksgiving dinner.  I haven't been this tempted by food since I was pregnant.  The flavor and texture was amazing and went absolutely perfectly with our baked ham.  Definitely, definitely making again.  My mother-in-law thought it needed a bit more brown sugar but I thought it was perfect as is.  Update: I now make this for every holiday using Splenda Brown Sugar mix and can't tell the difference.  It's so popular with my family that I must double it every time!

This is the 3rd year I've used this recipie! It is awesome! My husband who hates sweet potatoes and vowed to never eat them. Loves this recipie! ( I begged him to just please taste it!) Now he always say's "are you gonna make your sweet potato casserole?" 
I't makes alot for just the 4 of us so I just change the serving amount to 4 and it is plenty.  But I double the topping because we like it sweeter.  It is a very easy recipie!

This was a really good sweet potato recipe. I followed the directions exactly to see for myself if it was too sweet as some reviews mentioned.  Next time I will try cutting the sugar amount slightly, it was just a little too sweet for me, much like a dessert.  My topping also didn't crumble, it was too moist, but I placed it all around the top and it tasted yummy anyway! I used a potato masher and it had good texture, not too thin like baby food. Good dish to bring to a holiday meal.

This is scrumptious!  I used two large cans of yams instead of the fresh sweet potatoes.  I also substituted vanilla creamer for the heavy cream.  It turned out fantastic.  I have already shared the recipe with a friend.

I made sweet potatoes for the first time using this recipe.
I brought them in for our office feast.  Needless to say there were no leftovers.  
This was the most delicious sweet potatoe dish I have ever tasted! 
Not to mention, very simple to make.   This dish will be a yearly tradition.  
Thank you so much for this recipe!

OMG! This is best recipe for sweet potatoes by far. Not only do you use half the sugar and butter but you also keep more  nutritients from when you boil the potatoes. The family loved them- no more boiling for me! The only thing I didn't master was the pastry layer on top.

I wanted to try a new sweet potato recipe for Thanksgiving.  I had used the same recipe for 15 years that was delicious, but I wanted something that had more of a mashed potato feel.  This was PERFECT!  It had the perfect texture and sweetness.  I will be using this recipe for the next 15 years!

Fabulous!  This is so easy to make and such a delicious treat.  I agree with the other reviewers - I cut the brown sugar and white sugar in half and it was still delectable.

Excellent Recipe! I've been making this for several years since I found this recipe on AllRecipes. It has become a family tradition for every cool weather holiday dinner. I don't need the recipe anymore as I can just throw it together. I've lightened it up a little by using milk instead of cream and it's just fine that way. I also put brown sugar in the potatoes instead of white.

Delicious sweet potato dish. My family dives into this one. We have a nut allergy in the family so I leave the nuts out of the topping. Still yummy

I recommend buying the kind you can microwave (with the plastic wrap on them)...easier to peel this way and also they will cook faster.

Heather - THANK YOU for this recipe!!!  We have a favorite restaurant that has a sweet potato casserole very similar (if not exact) to this and I love it!  I have tried and tried to duplicate it, but just never got it quite right; I'm thinking it's the cream.  I made a 1/2 recipe of this last night to try it out on hubby and myself. Yup! Perfect - I will be making this again and again.

Very good!  One thing - the recipe instructions don't specify which part of the dish requires melted butter. An experienced cook probably would have realized the softened butter goes in the batch, not the topping, but I didn't realize that so I had to add some extra brown sugar to the top so my topping wasn't right.  I think the sugar from the author is right, even though some reviewers think you can use less.  I did use a Splenda sugar blend instead of sugar, brown sugar Spelnda blend instead of brown sugar, and egg whites instead of eggs.  I also used a big can of yams (I halved the recipe) instead of fresh sweet potatoes. Much easier and just as good. Very good recipe overall - maybe next time I won't mess up the topping. :)

OMGOODNESS!!! This was so good. I first doubted the "Gourmet" title but now I stand corrected. I think I will use the sugar/pecan topping for other recipes because it was so good. Only modification was that I doubled everything for the topping. I still had to put some marshmallows on half the casserole because I am a die hard fan of sweet potato with marshmallows. ***UPDATE*** 3 years and I still love this recipe. I do make it as is now (no more double toppings) with the exception of adding jumbo marshmallows. The kids love it!

Yummm!! This is by far the best sweet potato recipe I have ever had and my husband says the same!  It was so good that we decided to eat it for dessert!! The only change we made was using milk instead of cream as we didn't have any cream at home.  This is definitely the only sweet potato recipe I'll make from now on yumm yumm yumm!!!!

I cut some of the butter and sugar in this and used milk instead of heavy cream and it was still so delicious.  I used about half of the butter in the when I mixed the potatoes and added a little more milk (not heavy cream) so they wouldn't be dry.  I also only put in 1/2 the sugar it called for and added a little splenda.  For the topping, I cut the butter by 1 tablespoon and the topping came out perfect.

I've always loved my mom's sweet potatoes with marshmellows for thanksgiving, but I think I like this one even more.  

P.S.  the kids loved it too

Everytime I have made this recipe it has been a hit!  Even people who don't like the infamous "sweet potato casserole" like this one.  I've tried it with canned sweet potatoes and it's not nearly as good as using the baked fresh ones.

Wow! Amazing! I decided to try a different sweet potato casserole recipe this year. The topping was very good but I agree with others, a little too sweet. My regular recipe is very similar but adds crushed cornflakes to the topping. I think I will try that next time to break down the sweetness!

very tasty!  a bit too sweet but that's nothing that drinking a glass of milk can't fix!  i added about a 1/4 cup of shredded coconut with the topping and it was delicious.  i didn't have heavy cream on me so i used 1 tablespoon whole milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla non-dairy creamer and it still turned out great.

this really doesn't need another review but here goes...my mom has been making this ever since I can remember (my kids call it pumpkin pie casserole!) Anyway when I make it I just use two or 3 (depending on the size of my baking dish) large cans of sweet potatoes put them in the blender add the other ingredients and go from there it really cuts down on the prep time also I melt 3/4 stick of butter (only butter) and drizzle it over the top before baking...this is so good!

I loved these! They were not too sweet for me, but I also used the biggest yams I could find! It ended up filling the entire 9x13 pan, and I also added one more egg and a full stick of butter (since there were so many yams!). Was a big hit on Thanksgiving!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  We made it for Thanksgiving last year, and even the pickiest of eaters just devoured it!  Then we made it for a different crowd last Christmas and had the exact same results.  My three-year-old daughter enjoyed mixing the ingredients to make the topping, too, so it became a bonding experience, too.  Today, my mother-in-law asked me for the recipe--that should say it all right there!  Thank you!

I made this the night before (except for the topping) and it turned out great. I peeled my potatoes and then boiled them. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the potatoes. Once it was almost done cooking I put in under the broiler for about a minute and it made the topping nice and crispy. Everyone really raved about this dish.

Soooo good! I kept picking at the leftovers until they were completely gone! To reduce the fat, I made two significant alterations (and the recipe was still awesome). #1 - completely skipped adding the white sugar to the potatoes. They were sweet enough without, and I can't see it's required. #2 - instead of heavy cream, I used half-and-half (same amount). Didn't seem to make any difference, and I'm pleased that I made this change. Topping is great, and I'll definitely make again.

This is the most amazing sweet potato dish! I love this recipe and use it throughout the year.  I've used pumpkin and butternut squash in place of the potatoes and found that it is an extremely delicious and versatile recipe.  I have several family memebers, husband included, that are not fans of sweet potatoes, but rant and rave about this dish. I would highly suggest adding this to your holiday menu.

For sure I am making these sweet potatoes again...these are hands down the very best sweet potatoes ever!! I made them last year for our family Thanksgiving dinner and at Christmas for a potluck at work. I reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Trust me everyone will rave and no one will miss the marshmallows.

These were wonderful. I didn't use any white sugar, too sweet for my personal preference. Also, I baked my sweet potatoes at 375 convection for 1 hr. and the sweet potatoes just slide out of the skins.

This dish was so delicious!  Like so many other reviews I did cut way back on sugar & will cut back even more the next time I make it.  Probably all you really need for this recipe is 1/4 of the sugar it calls for, if you want to taste sweet potato.

Made exactly as directed. I wanted to love it, I really did. I didn't find it too sweet as suggested by others, I just didn't find it all that special. Maybe I was expecting a lighter texture to the sweet potato part, & a crispier texture to the topping. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but neither component lived up to the hype (for me anyway) & after feeding Easter dinner to 12 adults & 4 children I still had about 1/2 of the dish left. I was tempted to give 3 stars but 4 is fair. Update: I heated up the leftovers a few days later & definitely need to change my statement about the sweetness - whoo! After allowing the flavors to meld the predominate flavor was SUGAR. I don't think I'll make this recipe again but for those who want to try it I agree with most previous reviewers & also recommend reducing the sugars.

Really, really good (and I usually hate sweet potatoes)! One piece of advice you must heed--I read other reviews that suggested nuking the potatoes. DON'T. Baking them caramelizes the potato and gives it a sweeter, richer and more organic flavor. Also, they are SUPER easy to peel once baked. Microwaving them does nothing for the flavor. If you are worried about time then prepare this dish the night before. It's totally worth the extra time it takes to bake them. Also, take other reviewers' advice and cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup and the brown sugar to 2/3 cup. It will still be plenty sweet. And I only had to use 3 yams (Jewel) because they were so big. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really well.

Incredible! Used half the sugar and some brown sugar/splenda blend tp cut the sugar.  The texture was creamy and delicious without being too sweet.

We were at a cottage 2 weeks ago and a friend I met there told me about this recipe.  I tried it out on company last Saturday evening.  It was enjoyed by ALL.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be perfect.  I don't think I'd change a thing.  I can't wait to make it again for Canadian Thanksgiving in October (or sooner).  :)

this was devoured yesterday, i will make changes in the future, i will add more heavy whipping cream to make it a little more creamy.  More spices and I drizzled marshmallow cream over the top. I loved that addition. the topping makes the dish we loved it

This was great! Even the people who claimed that they were not Sweet potato lovers enjoyed the dish. I made it without the nuts because my husband doesn't like them, and it still turned out tastey!

This is a Thanksgiving favorite.  We have made several times and everyone loves it.  I usually skip the cream and just add milk or fat free half and half to save on some fat and calories but it still tastes very rich.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving at my husbands side of the family!  It got rave reviews from adults and children both.  I also (just because I love this particular spice) added a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe.  Everyone was tired of the marshmallow topped variety and ready for a change...the intro. for the recipe was right, after tasting these, we'll never go back! :-)

I've been making this recipe for years and is a staple at our Thanksgiving dinner.  If anyone sitting around your dinner table has a nut allergy, I've substituted hard ginger cookies that you can find in the cookie section of your grocery store, I just crumble them up instead of using pecans. Gives a nice crunch.

I have prepared this recipe a few times now, exactly as written, and it turns out amazing every single time!  It is almost like a crustless sweet potato pie.  Definitely could pass for a dessert. This is one of those potluck favorites.  Every time I bring it to an event or family gathering, I have someone ask me for the recipe.  I will never make sweet potato casserole using a different recipe again.  This is it for me!

My soon-to-be mother-in-law makes this for all our major holiday get-togethers, and it is FANTASTIC. It's so sweet and so decadent, one doesn't need to save room for pumpkin pie. I bet this would even be good with a dollop of Cool Whip on top and served as dessert!

Seriously, this was amazing! It sucks I can not eat this more often as I am a diabetic, but for a once in a blue moon side dish, this sure was a treat. It is a bit sweet, but the pecans definitely contrast it a bit better than the normal marshmallow topping. I will be using this recipe again..maybe even for Christmas next year.

EXCELLENT!  My husband and I loved this.  I did  not use the 1/4 cup of butter inside my mix.  I probably should have cut down the sugar too from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup or even 1/8 cup.  The brown sugar on top, in my opinion, was good enough.  Still came out good but great to hear that you can cut some sugar and it still comes out good.  I also had half and half and used instead of the heavy cream.  Thx...will definitely add to my receipe box.

For the past few years I have volunteered to bring a sweet potato dish to holiday gatherings. This is the first year it was the most complimented dish for Thanksgiving and It was requested for Christmas. No leftovers! Rich, yes, but a definite splurge for special occasions. The second time I was hurried so nuked the sweet potatoes (not yams-too sweet) for a little bit and then finished in the oven.

Great recipe! I reduced the white sugar to 1/4. I added 2 Tablespoon light brown sugar to the potato's. I only mashed my potato's once so there would be small chunks also. I added 3 eggs, because I had large potato's. I have searched for this perfect recipe, and found it.

This was a winner at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I never much liked marshmallows, so I enjoy this version of sweet potato casserole much better.  I reduced the sugar just as many other reviewers have recommended, and I still felt like it should have been on the dessert table.  Next time I'll probably reduce it a little more.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving exactly as instructed. It really was a yummy dish, although other reviewers were right when they said it was quite sweet. It was almost too sweet for some of my guests to finish their portion, while some of my other guests couldn't stop raving about it and wanted to take the leftovers home. It was easy to make and the aroma in the house was tantalizing!

I usually am not a fan of sweet potato casserole but since I was hosting thanksgiving and I knew people were expecting I gave this a try.  This is AMAZING!  Seriously so yummy.  It tastes like dessert - I'm almost certain if I put this in a pie crust and baked it I would win a pie contest with it - that delish!  I did follow other posters and only used 1/3 cup of sugar in the potatoes and 1/3 in the topping and it was so yummy!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I looked it up Saturday night and made it Sunday for my family's Thanksgiving.  It was such a hit that I got asked for the recipe three times. I added some freshly gound nutmeg but followed the recipe to the letter other than that.  I will definitely do this one again... probably later this week since there wasn't any left over.  Kuddos to Heather!

I did not alter this recipe at all.  I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  It was the first thing gone!  My family has demanded that I make it again this year (and definitely a double batch).  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe as written, (except I baked my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them) and brought it to an early Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone enjoyed this recipe. It is more of a sweet dish, but can easily be altered by leaving the sugar in if you want it to be sweeter or decrease to suit your taste. I plan on making this again on Thanksgiving day and I will decrease the sugar to make it more of a savory dish. Overall, loved it!

Loved it!  I did substitute brown sugar for the white sugar and it was wonderful!  I fixed it for Easter dinner and everyone loved it!

Delicious recipe....but my only complaint is that it is a little complicated to make, and turned my kitchen into a sweet potato mess! (I had a problem mashing the sweet potatoes....maybe they weren't cooked enough, but mashing them was difficult, time consuming, and very messy.)

This really is the classic recipe - tasty and good. We didn't add the white sugar to make it a tad healthier and because sweet potatoes are already sweet!

I've made this recipe for several years now at Thanksgiving and I can honestly say that it's the best out there! The consistency is so creamy but not too sweet. The topping really makes it. Out of all of my Thanksgiving dishes, this one is gone first.

One of the classic Thanksgiving recipes.  This one is a keeper because it combines the sweet creaminess of the mashed sweet potatoes with the crunchy saltiness of nuts.  Easy (even better) to make ahead!

This is the best sweet potato side dish recipe for Thanksgiving!  Been making this for the past 7 years and everyone always asks for me to make.  Recommend 2x or 3x the pecan mixture for the topping.  When mixing, use a hand or standing mixer.  It will ensure all ingredients are evenly blended.

This was really good. I followed the recipe, but I added an exra tablespoon of heavy cream and I doubled my topping so that it would be enough to spread over the whole dish.

Fabulous!  I made this for my family a few weeks before Thanksgiving to give it a test run and the loved it.  Then I made it for our potluck at work, got rave reviews.  I did not cut back on the sugar and I actually added more brown sugar to the topping part.  I combined the topping as instructed, placed large pecan pieces over the top and covered with the topping mixture so it made almost a praline topping.  WOW... this is what we will have instead of candied yams I use to make.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Everyone loved it, even the people who said they didn't like sweet potatoes. I cut the white sugar in half and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also cut the butter in half--one stick of butter for five sweet potatoes seemed really excessive. I couldn't really taste the cinnamon--next time I'll add more.

Thank you for the best sweet potato recipe ever! I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back the white sugar to 1/3 cup and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also borrowed the idea of using the mixer for the potatoes, and the strings did stay attached to the beater, allowing me to just discard it instead of scraping the beaters into the bowl. It was absolutely delicious, and will be the only sweet potato casserole I will ever make again...great taste, consistency, and presentation!

Absolutely delicious.  I halved the sugar in the sweet potatos and honestly I think that I'd use all the sugar next time.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  This recipe is awesome.

Totally impressed!!!  I was nervous to make this because every one in my family has really impressive sweet potato recipes, this time every one was asking for THIS one :)  Delicious, really sweet, it satisfied that sweet craving with dinner.  I didn't make ANY changes to the recipe however I did over mix the crumble topping making it too clumpy.  Oh well, everyone still loved it.  Next time I will definitely either microwave or boil the potatoes to soften, baking them took forever.  Thnks for the recipe it was amazing and I will make it regularly!  I'd love to make this as a breakfast dish!

My family all gets together for Thanksgiving each year and all the ladies bring a dish or two for the feast. (Yes, it is a feast since there are so many of us.) My husband calls it the dinner of many casseroles. I bring the sweet potatoes each year, and have always used a different sweet potato recipe in the past. Not any more!! Everyone raved about the sweet potatoes this year and said they were the best they had ever eaten. Even the teenagers liked them. I am now known as the sweet potato queen. Thanks for sharing this yummy dish which thereby hightened my status to royalty. I will surely be beheaded if I ever deviate from this recipe.

Awesome recipe, but I cut down on the sugar big time. Only 1/4 of brown, not white sugar in the potato mixture and 2/3 cup brown sugar for the topping.

This is SOOOOOOOOOO good! It's replacing my usual recipe. I used two 40 oz cans of Bruce's Yams and 2% milk instead of heavy cream and it was still to die for! Love, love, love. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and now I'm making it for Christmas. VERY GOOD!!
I saw where lots of reviewers were subbing canned yams instead. I will say this, I had people ask me, "did you use real potatoes?" because they thought it was too good for the canned variety. Yes, I did.

This was amazing, and I don't even like sweet potatoes! My family's small square pan of sweet potatoes usually only have a few scoops missing by the end of the night, but not this year...My whole 9x13 pan of them were gone!

Yum yum YUM!  I made this as a test for Christmas dinner and it passed with flying colors.  Unbeknownst to me, my husband didn't like sweet potatoes.  He ate two helpings of this.  He said I may have forced him to turn the corner on sweet potatoes.  Which is great since at 6 months pregnant, I plan to make these just about every night.

Amazing! I was assigned to make sweet potatoes as my contribution to Thanksgiving this year, and I don't even like sweet potatoes. Found this recipe, gave it a try, EXACTLY, with no changes... and it turned out so delicious! I have changed my opinion, I LOVE sweet potatoes now because of this recipe. They tasted better than cake!

I make this a couple times a year for my in-laws and there are never any leftovers. The only changes I make are I use brown sug instead of white and I like to broil a bag of mini marshmallows on top before serving.

Very well-received at thanksgiving and a welcome change-up from the marshmallow-on-top potato. Since we were serving several diabetics, I used only about a third of the sugar and used splenda brown sugar for the topping and it worked out fine. I'll be using this again!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, even with those people who said they didn't like sweet potatoes or nuts!
I made it the night before and stuck it in the fridge overnight.  On Thanksgiving I put it in the microwave on defrost to warm it up a bit, then threw it in the oven once there was room.  Fantastic and it makes great leftovers too, even cold!

This was the best sweet potato casserole I have ever had.  Not too sweet; just right.  Followed recipe excactly except backed off a bit on the white and brown sugar per other reviewer suggestions.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it too!

I've been making Thanksgiving dinner for my wife and I for 17+years and she has never liked sweet potatoes in any recipe that I've tried, and I've tried a lot. This year I made this recipe and for the first time she went back for seconds...and then some. This will be a staple in our family for many years. Great recipe.

I reallly liked it, esp with the pecan crumble topping it gave it a diff texture than just mushy potatoes...I micorwaved 6 potatoes for abt 10 minutes, and they were soft enough to mash!! This made me happy because I just couldnt deal with boiling for so long. Also I used only 1/4th cup sugar with the sweet potatoes

This recipe is fantastic! I am a huge fan of sweet potatoes and I can't wait to make this again. I am new to cooking and made a few mistakes in preparing it, but it actually turned out fine. I think next time I will use canned potatoes though.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used a 3-lb bag of sweet potatoes and it was the perfect amount.  The only change I made was using just a tad less than 1/2 cup sugar in the sweet potatoes.  I also baked this in a 2-qt. casserole dish so I didn't need all of the topping (left out the pecans, too).  This looked so yummy when it came out of the oven.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is the first sweet potato dish that was eaten up before the carrot souffle that I make from this site on Thanksgiving.  I added some bourbon and sprinkled just a few miniature marshmallows on top for effect but kept the rest the same.  Everyone raved about the yummy topping this makes.

This was excellent.  I made it as directed with one exception and that was decreasing the sugar.  I think it also depends on the size of your potatoes used.   I will definitly make again!

I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used 6 large oven roasted sweet potatoes. Came out great!

AMAZING!!! I made this and another sweet potato casserole, the classic with marshmallows, for Thanksgiving. The classic dish was barely touched but this was completely gone. Everybody loved it! Including me and I was a bit upset that there were no left overs lol. Good thing this is a fairly easy recipe and I can whip it up again just as soon as I get to the store for more sweet potatoes! I don't think I ever want the marshmallow casserole EVER again!!!

982 reviews and a 5 star rating - what more can I say - these are awesome! I always bake my sweet potatoes (scrub, poke and bake at 350 until they ooze). Let them cool a while, then peel and proceed.

Perfection.  I've made this for several events the past few years...from Thanksgiving to luaus (just add mac nuts..yum!) and I get rave reviews every time.  And the second best part...it's easy and make-ahead friendly!  I've prepared the potatoes prior to adding them to the casserole several ways and I think I like the outcome of baking the potatoes in the oven...until the natural sugars start to ooze out (onto the carefully placed cookie sheet beneath them!  (oops.))  I use FF half and half and this last time even forgot the sugar...but it was perfect!  Thanks for bringing this delicious dish to us!!

I served this for T-day 2007 and was a huge success! I made additional topping since I cooked in a more shallow dish, using organic sweet potatoes and fat free half and half in place of cream. I also decrease the sugar from 1/2 to 1/3 cup, since there is so much natural sweetness to this dish. Truly the highlight of the dinner and will repeat it again this year. ENJOY!

This recipe is wonderful.  I have been making it for years for Thanksgiving Dinner.  We prefer our sweet potatoes in chunks, so I bake them for a shorter time, peel them and cut them in chunks.  Everyone loves this recipe.  Thanks!!!

I've made this twice and it definitely turns out best with using sweet potatoes instead of canned yams. Also, I substituted skim milk for heavy cream and it was amazing!!!

I also do not usually care for sweet potatoes, but this recipe was quite nice, especially the crunchy topping. The only suggestion I would make is to halve the recipe as I found that it made too much for our group of 10 - I had over half the pan left and everyone had seconds!

Overpowering sweet.  I would cut back on brown sugar on topping and use a 8x8 or 9x9 instead of 9x13. 9x13 spread potatoes too thin giving too much of super sweet topping per serving.

This is simply the best sweet potato recipe I've ever tasted.  I don't particularly like sweet potatoes but this is delicious and my family loves it.  When I make the topping I reduce the amount of butter (it was a bit too greasy for my taste). Superb recipe, I'll never use another!

This is an old family favorite. I do,however, put marshmallows on top just to give that extra touch. The one time I didn't my family asked if I had run out of marshmallows! If you've never tried this recipe, it's a winner.

This was the most fantastic sweet potato recipe I have ever tasted or prepared!  It went fast.  I will make this again and again.  All the modification I made was to reduce the sugars by one half.  Scrumptious!

I made this for an office party and it was very good. This is a really great alternative to the marshmallow standard...Since I am not really a big fan of very sweet things, I did not add as much topping that the recipe called for. Overall, a great change and very tasty!! Easy to make as well.

Amazing Recipe.  Except I didn't have actual sweet potatoes; used 29oz. can, then adjusted the number of servings in half for ingredients to equal amount of potatoes in can.  Came out Delish!!!  Think I like it better than the marshmallow topping sweet potato casserole.

I'll be honest . . . I cooked and ate this on an evening when I ended up having one too many glasses of wine.  As such, my association with the dish isn't a positive one, lol.  That said, my husband LOVED it, he said more than once that the combination of pecans and sweet potatoes is a great one.  I peeled and boiled the sweet potatoes, and put everything together in the morning in preparation for cooking it later that day.  The boiling option in my opinion was much easier than baking the potatoes in order to mash them.

I'm sure I'll be asked to make this one again!

This is baking in the oven as we speak. It's my first year cooking thanksgiving dinner... let's be honest, at 26 I just started cooking a few months ago. This was a pretty easy recipe to follow. I read many of the reviews and decided to cut back on the sugar. I also baked the potatoes in the oven for about 1hr 10 min at 400F, let them cool a few minutes and peeled... very easy!

The biggest confusion was "5 potatoes." Huh?? That's 2 pounds or 10 pounds depending on how big they are! I'm cooking for 13, so I am using 10 small-medium sized sweet potatoes (7.5 pounds). Even thought I doubled the potatoes, I did not double the butter and I HALFED the sugar (used 1/4 cup). I added 3 large eggs, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 full teaspoon salt to balance the sweetness. I used the listed amounts for the topping even though I'm making double the potatoes. I just added extra pecans (like 4 times extra). It looks and smells amazing.... I am going to cool it and refrigerate until tomorrow, and heat just before serving. 

I hope this wasn't confusing... the key is to TRY the potatoes (before adding egg) as you add ingredients. After I added the extra salt I was worried because they tasted salty but after the sugar went in, it was so balanced! Add a little sugar, try it and add more if needed :) you can always add more but you can't take it out!! Happy Thanksgiving!

Just made this for my husbands Thanksgiving Luncheon.... I double the recipe, used canned sweet potatoes, and topped with marshmallows.  He just told me, it was a COMPLETE HIT! He said there were guys that didn't even like sweet potatoes that loved it! Definitely a KEEPER!

I made it gluten free by subbing the AP flour for 3 Tablespoons Pamela's gluten free baking mix. I used 5 cups sweet potatoes and increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Everyone loved it and asked for it to be at the table every Thanksgiving.

This is the best I have ever had.  I used just under a 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown. I didn't have heavy cream so I used eggnog. I was also feeding someone who is gluten free so I used very fine oatmeal instead of flour in the topping. The eggnog knocked it out of the park and I will use the oatmeal again too. Can't wait to use this at Thanksgiving!

Added maple syrup because I was out of brown sugar, its taking a lot longer than 30 minutes now to bake to a golden brown, and is still a little runny, however, Im not even done baking this, having a taste of it, and its like putting sexiness inside your mouth!

Every time I make this, they beg for more.  Occassionally I sprinkle marshmallows over the top before baking for those who love the traditional marshmallow addition.  Either way, I have never had anything less than rave reviews.

I also cut the sugar in half and found it to be sweet enough.  I didn't have enough brown sugar so I sprinkled it with what I had and threw some marshmallows at it.  It was good!

I get raves over this EVERY time and always have mulitple recipe requests. Everyone always says it the Best they have ever tasted. I don't even think about making sweet pot. souflee any other way anymore =).  I make as is except i double the pecans. Oh, and about 1/4 cup white sugar in w/the potatoes and 1 cup brown sugar in the topping...but it would still get exclamations just as written =) UPDATE: I have been making this for at least 7 years now and there is still no contest. I have sometimes made the Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole from this site, and it is very similar, but I prefer this one. I made with full sugar by accident this year and I will go back to my 1/4 cup white sugar in with the potatoes and 1 cup brown sugar with the doubled pecans in the topping. It is perfect to me that way. I don't like it to taste like dessert. But believe me, it's just me. WHen I make it with the sugar called for it is still one of the first things to go at the table.

Made this for Christmas... unanimous approval by all. Sweet potatoes are usually a hard sell at my house, but the verdict from my notoriously hard to please mom was "This is the best sweet potato dish I've ever had." I substituted marshmallows on top for the crumb crust, due to a celiac family member.

This is one of my favorite Christmas dinner recipes.  The only changes I make is to replace the cream with 1/2 cup of rum and omit the flour.  Enjoy!

After making these, I now love sweet potatoes!! They were quickly gone at our Thanksgiving dinner. I can't wait to make these again for Christmas dinner. I reduced the white sugar slightly (1/3 cup) and used 7 potatoes. They were still sweet and perfect with the brown sugar topping.I plan to increase the pecans and topping next time. I'm going to use glazed pecans...yum!

With very little if any tweaking such as eliminating the pecans,this is a sweet potato pie filling.

Not as good as I was hoping.  I read tons of reviews and considered reducing the amount of sugar used but decided to make it as written.  The problem for my family was not the amount of sugar at all.  The flavor was just average.  Not sure what went wrong but I have made much better tasting sweet potato casseroles.  Disappointed this Thanksgiving.  We had 10 adults and I'd bet not even 1/4 of the 9X13 dish of potatoes was gone by the end of the meal.  Had tons of leftovers of course but eventually threw most of them out.  Just not great.

I made the mistake of making this for Thanksgiving. Sorry but it was not all that the reviews give it credit for being. It was only served once. I had 1 guest even look at it funny. Maybe if I added a bit more sugar? It just lacked something. Needless to say it went the way of the Dodo. I will not be wasting sweet potatos on this again.

This is the best sweet potato recipe I have ever used. The only modifications I made were that I doubled the recipe, used a bit less sugar and used milk instead of cream. It will definitely find its place in my permanent recipe box. I have also heard it called "yam puff" but no matter what you call it they are delicious and very good the next day as well.

I made the recipe exactly as stated. Wrapped REAL sweet potatoes in tin foil. 1hr @ 400 degrees. Buying them the same size if you want them done at the same time. Peels come right off. I slowly added white sugar into the mix but ended up using the amount stated on the recipe and it wasn't too sweet. These were VERY good. I will definitely make again. No more marshmallow topping for me!

This got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. Only used half the white sugar and only had one egg on hand, perhaps why it was a bit mushier than I had anticipated. Added some orange peel with the spices. awesome!

I had to make Thanksgiving dinner by myself, and I have never eaten sweet potatoes because I didn't think I'd like them, so I needed a recipe I felt I could trust.  Of course I came to allrecipes.com!  I followed the recipe exactly, other than I made a mistake and added 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 (it was fine).  This is easy as can be, I made it the day before, but baked it the day of, and everyone raved about it!  I thought I should try it to see what all the fuss was about....well, I might not like any other form of sweet potatoes, but I will eat these every year!  Delish!!

It's like eating heaven...Absolutely delicious! My family fought over who would get the last of it. Everyone wanted the recipe and I definitely will make this again.  It was a little on the sweet side for those of you who might not like that. Maybe cut back on sugar as other have done but I enjoyed it as is!

In desperation, I was looking for a sweet potato something.  I actually used two cups of fresh sweet potatoes (boiled).  I added a 1/2 cup of mango, substiuted the heavy cream with coffee cream, 1/4 teaspoon of allspice, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Many raves and I think this will be a family favorite!

I made this recipe with BOILED sweet potatoes until they were soft. I mashed them and then used an immersion blender to make it extra creamy. The only suggestion I have is to double the topping mix!!! The brown sugar/pecan topping is delish and I didn't feel like there was enough! Overall, this is a keeper recipe. I will make again.

I made this today and it was a hit. Everyone said it was the best dish of all. I didn't have heavy cream so I put sour cream instead. I switched white and brown sugar to honey power and cut down the sweet a little. Also, I used whole wheat flour and put about 1/3 cup of skim milk into the sweet potatoes.

Big Hit!  Everyone loved these!

I used two 15 oz cans of cut yams (just the yams, not the juice).  Mixed them in my mixer like some here suggested to get rid of the strings (they wind around the beater, easier to remove).  I used only 1/3 cup sugar as suggested by others.  I omitted the salt (since I used canned yams).  Mixed as directed.  Spread into a 9x13 inch dish.  Covered with plastic wrap and stored in fridge over night.  Added the topping the next morning and cooked as directed.  I kept the original amount of brown sugar because I love that kind of topping.  Enough for 10 people and some left overs (I served a lot of other things as well, so if serving this as the only potato dish I would double it).  Next year I will double it!  Teens came back later after dinner asking for more.

I made this for my husband since he love's sweet potatoes (even though I've always hated them!)  But I love this recipe!  I'm taking it to my family's Thanksgiving to try and convert them into sweet potato fans now!  I made double the pecan topping...adds more texture, but other than that didn't change anything!

Really tasty but sweet. Almost more like a dessert then a side dish. I added a bit of Makers Mark bourbon to the mix. Great along side my herbed crusted pork roast and sauteed brussel sprouts. Husband loved it!

I use a different topping. I do shredded coconut,chopped pecans, brown sugar and mix it all together w/ melted butter for my topping. No flour. A heavenly variation for toasted coconut lovers. My family scarfs up what little I leave them!

I made this for the first time yesterday for my extended family for an early Thanksgiving Dinner and received rave reviews!  I used yam instead of sweet potatoes although I'm sure it wouldn't have made any difference.  I've been advised by all who tasted it to keep it in my regular rotation!  It's definitely a keeper, thanks for a great recipe!

These sweet potatos were delicious!  I only had three large sweet potatos so I cut the recipe in half.  I baked them in the oven and once soft the skins just peeled right off. We all really enjoyed these sweet potatos and I will be making them again!

My sister (who is a pretty terrible cook) asked if she could make something for Christmas dinner I gave her this recipe and asked her to make it. I  am totally surprised that it came out excellent. Our family used to make the sweet potatoes with marshmellows on top- we will replace that recipe with this one. No subsitions were made. The only thing she did differant was peel and boil the sweet potatoes instead of broil. Excellent recipe!

These turned out great. Even my husband, who hates candied yams, liked these. I made them the night before and popped them in the oven when the turkey was about an hour away form being finished. These were so easy too! I microwaved the potatoes to save time and energy. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It is a new holiday staple.

This is wonderful.  It wasn't sweet and the texture was fantastic.   I won't use another recipe.  I won't use nuts next time but that is a personal preference.

I used margarine instead of butter which may have been the reason I needed to add twice the flour called for to make the topping crumbly. I didn't put any sugar in the sweet potatoes and used 2% milk. My husband and I thought this dish was amazing.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was so good everyone ate the sweet potatoes and skipped desserts. This is the very best recipe I've ever made. I think the heavy cream makes it have a rich flavor.

So, the Joke for my dads Christmas this year was a consistent stream of "I love your yams" from one of good friends. Everybody love these yams! I have made them for two groups of people so far and they were a hit each time! Now two test them out on my mom and step dad. Needless to say "i love your yams" will be the running joke for years to come. I make more topping then it says to and use almonds (chopped in a mixer) and add the pecans some of the time. I also add almond extract to the yams and topping. and on top of everything else I have had a few people who claimed to not like yams love this dish.

Very tasty, I made it just as the recipe specified and will definitely make again. Perhaps next time I would add a little orange zest or juice for extra zing, but it was delicious as is.

This was the most delicious recipe EVER!! I just started eating sweet potatos and had been very excited to try to this to bring to my boyfriends families thanksgiving. I made half of it marshmallow and the other half the pecan topping. BOTH were over the top delicious!! My boyfriend and his brother and my brother had never tried sweet potatoes n swore they never would but it didnt take much convincing after they smelt the sweet aroma of the combination of ingredients. Its like a little peice of heaven! my father was in the hospital for thanks giving and only wanted pumpkin pie, i had no pumkin pie but i gave him this sweet potatoe dish n thats all hes been talking about since! this will be MY dish every year for the holidays from here on out! thanks a bunch!

This was the original pecan topped recipe that started it all! I have made this the past five years for Thanksgiving. To save time I had used canned sweet potatoes and eveyone loved it. (I live in the north so could get away with this, lol) This year I decided to bake the potatoes and make the authentic recipe. It was even way better this way! So if you must use canned it is still really good. But if possible, make the baked potato version  and it is awesome! I baked and mashed my potatoes after work the day before Thanksgiving to save time and put the casserole together the next day; it worked out perfect. I will never use canned potatoes again! The potatoes slid right out of the skins once baked so no peeling was needed. Super easy! I baked mine for an hour though. The only other change I made this year was I used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream. It made no difference.  Also when I had used canned potaotes in the past, I cut back on the sugar because they were sweetened already with syrup. If you want to bring a dish to impress the relatives, this is the one! Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!

I actually enjoyed sweet potatoes this year. In the past I've made the marshmallow variety by request but never again! I also cut down on the sugar, 1/3 of white, and 2/3 of brown. This makes a lot so if your party isn't too many then I'd suggest halving it.

Followed the directions except for how to cook the potatoes.  You need to bake them for around an hour to cook through to mash.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

You really cannot go wrong with this.  The only thing I do different is add a little orange juice when mashing the sweet potatoes, it gives a really great flavor.  This thins them out a little so I add an extra egg to compensate and bake until a knife comes out clean.  Super!

This was a hit this year at Thanksgiving! I will be using this recipe over and over! The only thing I changed was I substituted Splenda and a Splenda brown sugar blend. I had to adjust the potato cooking time also (mine took an hour to bake properly). Love it!

Very good.  One note on the recipe instructions - the sweet potatoes will not be soft enough to mash with only 35 min in the oven, need closer to an hour on 350.

I used YAMS - they are not the same as sweet potatoes (a lot of people don't know that).  This is a new staple for our Thanksgiving meal and there are never leftovers!  You could cut back a bit on the sugar and it's still plenty sweet.  YUM!!!

This had a very dense texture that I didn't like - and the ingredients are in EVERY sweet potato casserole. Nothing special - sorry.

It came out really good, I used 2 cans of the canned yams drained. I did put some liquid to the side and added some after mixing in all the ingredients. I also didn’t put nuts in because I made it for a work party. For the crumble, I just put a layer of brown sugar and then a layer of marshmallows. BUT next time I will do the crumble topping suggested. Not super sweet but really good.

I've made these sweet potatoes for about 10 years now, and EVERY time I make them, at least one person asks for the recipe!  I've also made a couple of alterations and substituted splenda for both the sugars, skim milk instead of cream, double the cinnamon and add nutmeg and clove.  Absolutely love them and I am given the assignment of bringing them to every pot luck and Thanksgiving dinner for both sides of the family!

Really disappointed and now it is 9pm and I am embarrassed to bring this into work tomorrow.  It just doesn't taste good at all.  After reading all the reviews I am assuming I did something wrong but I don't know what.

I don't normally review dishes, but I just had to comment on this one.  I've never been a fan of sweet potatoes unless they were friend and covered in ketchup. I decided to make this (based on reviews) for my husband's work luncheon. I doubled the recipe and it made one large aluminum pan and I scooped a serving into a small pan to sample once done. I figured I'd try it and see if it was OK, because if not I'd have to make something else. Well, I almost ate the whole serving so far. It is FANTASTIC! I actually think it tastes more like a dessert than a side. The pecans on top are heaven. Wish I could give this more stars!  My only changes were: a bit less sugar as suggested  a touch more cinnamon and cream  and I miscalculated and put too much butter and sugar in the topping...and it's fabulous!  Make this on Thanksgiving!!

I have been making this for many years. It the one dish EVERYONE remembers and requests and talks about. I have cut back the sugar too. I do use actual sweet potatoes rather than yams as they have a different texture and colour. This is guaranteed to be a dish your guests will remember.

I use brown sugar, about 1/3 cup, and adjusted once all mixed together.  Used 1 turnip to cut back the richness of yams.  No need for cream.  The topping is amazing.  This is an excellent dish that can be prepared in advance.  It has become a tradition that gets requested with every turkey dinner I attend!

Cut down on sugars, and baked it a little longer at a lower temperature, and finished at a higher temp (because of other dishes), but otherwise left it alone.  We all loved it.

delicious.  I would cut down the sugar a little bit nexttime.  Sweet potatoes don't need to be over powered by adding so much sugar.  Boiling the potatoes helped cut time, I quartered the potatoes and left the skin on so they wouldn't get too mushy.  Another trick that will help,  when mixing the butter and brown sugar, DO NOT USE YOUR HANDS! This causes the butter to become warm and won't produce the crumble texture you are looking for.  Keep the butter in the fridge until you are ready to use it.  I also put my fork ( or pastry blender) in the fridge to keep it cool until ready to use.

These are such a nice, sweet and cinnamon flavored casserole.  The nuts on sugar on top adds something special and is really enjoyable, even for me, who normally just puts butter on a sweet potato.  I tried these without the nuts and think it really misses something without them.  I also like to cook the potatoes completely, as i like more of mashed sweet potato casserole and without cooking completely, they are more lumpy.  I usually add one more potato to cut back on the amount of sweet.  I've put in both a 9 x 13 and 8 x 8 pan, and i prefer the thicker potato of the 8 x 8.  I make this for my picky husband at least once every couple of weeks!  Excellent.

This is simply the best sweet potato casserole ever. It was perfect - sweet but not too sweet. I made it exactly as the recipe states, no alterations. Normally I end up tweaking recipes slightly to adjust to my families tastes, but this one needs no changes. The spices really complimented the flavor of the sweet potatoes and the crunchy nut topping added a a great contrast to the smooth potatoes. The egg makes the entire casserole lighter and not so dense and heavy as other recipes. My husband normally doesn't like sweet potato casseroles but he loved this one and there were no leftovers. LOVED IT!

My mom has made this recipe every Thanksgiving for years since she found it online. I can't remember a Thanksgiving without it, to be honest. This is THE BEST DISH on the table every year, and the one I look forward to the most. Thank you for the recipe and it deserves better than five stars!!!

I have been making different sweet potato dishes for decades. I can now say I have found my permanent one. I made this with 6 medium/smallish yams - the reddish fleshed sweet potato ;) The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white in the main body of the casserole. I did not double the crumble topping as some others have done, but I did use a 9x9 baking dish instead of the 9x13 recommended. This gave a smaller surface area and I had more than enough topping to fully cover the casserole in a thick layer of yummy goodness. My son who used to like sweet potatoes in the past but who had decided he no longer did was convinced with some urging to at least give this a try ... he did and when we were cleaning up he made a point of making sure the sweet potato leftovers in particular were handled properly to ensure he'd get to have some more the next day ;) I'd say without a doubt this was a winner.

I've never had sweet potatoes before & the thought of the marshmallow topping turned me off. I was excited to try this. I am so glad I did. Very easy to make & tastes incredible. Yes desert like indeed. My Thanksgiving guests loved it too! I will definately make again.

revised: I boil all my potatoes in their skins just because I think the skin removal is easier and doesn't waste any of the potato. Plus I prefer fresh potatoes to canned.  I whip the mixture at a high speed, and occasionally throw in orange zest or maple flavor, omit the pecans,etc.  It's fun to experiment w/this recipe!  It is always a hit wherever I take it.

THIS WAS THE BEST!  My kids, who hate sweet potatoes with a passion, gobbled it up and asked when I was going to make it again.  I too followed the advice to double the topping. I made a boo boo and melted the butter a bit but it didn't matter, it still worked out fine and actually made it spread evenly over the casserole.  I used two large cans of Bruce's Yams since I know their quality is consistently excellent (heck of a lot better job than me guessing which sweet potatoes are good or not.  It also saved A LOT of time.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Best new recipe I've tried . A real keeper!  I microwaved the cubed potatoes, then mashed and whipped the potato layer. Turned out so light and fluffy, and held a warm temperature all the way through our meal. A very attractive presentation. Sweet enough to serve as a dessert as well as a side dish. Like others, I will try decreasing the sugar next time.

I made this recipe for the first time this morning to take to a luncheon at work.  Everyone loved it.

Since I am a type 2 diabetic I changed a few things, such as using Splenda instead of sugar and brown sugar.  It was every bit as sweet as it would have been with the sugar.  To cut down on the calories I also used egg substitute instead of eggs.
I'll make it again.

Very good, but I tweaked it to our personal taste.  I also used 2 large cans of sweet potatoes to save time and reduced the amount of butter.  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of heavy cream. To give it an unbelievable taste, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and a pinch of nutmeg.

LOVE IT....LOVE IT.  Made for Thanksgiving and I was made to promise that I would make it again next year.  Wouldn't change a thing.  When making for my daughter I add marshmallows, just because she doesn't like the nuts.  Still tastes great!

Such a great recipe that I don't save it just for the holidays.  I love to make some and freeze the leftovers in batches so I can pull some out to have with dinner. One change I always make is for my boyfriend who's allergic to nuts. I started substituting oatmeal instead of the pecans to the topping.  Makes the topping chewy and delicious!

Oh my gosh was this great!!! I baked my sweet potatoes in the oven (I used 5 medium size) and then squeezed the guts out.  I then added my butter and sugar.....just taste until it is the desired sweetness.  I think I used 1/3 cup of sugar and they were perfect.  My brother-in-law has two giant servings of this Thanksgiving.  It is absolutely delicious and the topping is orgasmic!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING ON THE THANKSGIVING DAY TABLE!  Made with 2 eggs (plenty for binding purposes), added a dash of nutmeg (for creaminess and that something extra!), also added extra chopped pecans on top.  Watch this closely toward the end of baking or the pecans will start to burn.  This dish was not too sweet.  It was PERFECT!  Better than the after dinner pie!

This is a great recipe! I agree with everyone else to cut back on the sugar.I also love marshmallows on my sweet potatos so I just added the marshmallows to the streusel topping. Could not imagine it NOT being on our table during the holidays!

This was so yummy.  Made some changes: Replaced the heavy cream w/ skim milk, decreased the butter to about half and omitted the pecans. Still tasted sinfully delicious. This is a keeper.

Deeeeeeeeelish!!! My mom said that this is our new Thanksgiving sweet potoato recipe! I beat my grandmother's! :) I didn't change a thing - it's awesome exactly as the recipe says. The pecan brown sugar topping adds so-o much flavor to the dish. The texture of the pecans with the sweet potatoes is great.

I'm American, living over in England, and I prepared this for a group of 20 British friends for our "Thanksgiving" party.  They were skeptical, but at the end of the evening, the pan was completely clean!  I've made the marshmallow variety for Brits in the past and it was barely touched.  This recipe is a keeper!  I omitted the eggs because my husband is allergic and it turned out great!

This was a huge hit with my entire family. I used milk instead of cream, about 1/2 the amount of white sugar and used ground pecans instead of chopped.  Excellent recipe!

I made this recipe to go with a ham dinner I made tonight. Other than using coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar, I followed the recipe exactly. My family and I loved the sweet potatoes, and none of us thought it was too sweet. The only change I would do in the future is to use more than 5 sweet potatoes if we get the same size, or use a smaller baking dish. Spreading the sweet potato mixture in a 9" x 12" baking dish, the sweet potatoes were only about 1/2" thick. Most likely, I will increase the number of sweet potatoes by at least 2 since the topping covered the top in a 9" x 12" baking dish pretty well. I will definitely be making this recipe from here on instead of the one I was using with canned yams. I did make this recipe a second time, and doubled the sweet potatoes. This time, the proportions of sweet potatoes to topping was perfect. This will be my go-to recipe from now on for sweet potatoes.

Just getting ready to make this delicious casserole for the umpteenth time for this year's Thanksgiving. I also cut the sugar in half and might up the cream a bit. My suggestion for cooking the sweet potatoes is to cook them in a steamer. They don't dry out (like in the oven) or take on too much water (when they are boiled) or cook unevenly (as in the microwave.)

This came out awesome! I used carnation milk, since I didn't have cream on hand. I also added a little nutmeg. Taste almost like the very rich sweet potato soufflé my mom and grandmother makes, but without all the extra fat. Will use this recipe again.

This is by far my favorite recipe!!! I have made it many times, I have tried making variations, but I like it best if I follow the recipe exactly. It can be made the day before a holiday and then baked the next day. This dish is very addictive once you've had it, you will always want it!

Delish!! I have made this dish several times! Its super easy and is a great dish to assemble the day prior to cooking.  I've prepared and cooked it the same day as well.  I have found that for some reason it tastes better when it has sat in the fridge over night prior to baking.  A Thanksgiving and Christmas must!!

Wonderful & easy alternative to the sweet potato & marshmallow dish. Almost everyone had seconds & they demanded that I make it again next year. I used canned sweet potatoes instead of boiling fresh that I rinsed before mashing since they were in heavy syrup. I was also out of heavy cream, so I substituted about 2/3 the amount of sour cream and it worked fine. Seriously considering making this again for Christmas dinner!

As written, I turned this into a pie. Just threw it into a pre prepared pie crust, and is great! As a side dish, I use half the sugar, other wise it's way to sweet.

This is sooooo good. Made it before Thanksgiving so there would be no surprises. Works best with baked sweet potatoes, not canned. Very , very good

This recipe made me want to eat sweet potatoes everyday! I like nutmeg so I add 1/4 tsp of all spice and 1/4  tsp of nutmeg. I don't usually have heavy cream, so I use cream cheese or vanilla bean yogurt.

I call it bombalicious!

I followed this recipe exactly...OK, I cheated and used canned yams-- it was still yummy!  This is very unique and will stand out at Thanksgiving.  Not your ordinary sweet potato casserole.

FABULOUS! I made this for Easter and it was absolutely delicious. I have tried a few Sweet Potato Recipes but I think that this one is the very best -great flavor! In my opinion, it is the baking of the yams(unlike boiling) that contributes to the subtle caramelized taste , that makes this recipe so delectable. I used 1/3 cup of white sugar and it was adequate. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

I have been asked every holiday by both families to make this dish for 3 years. People who hate sweet potatoes love it and the others will die for it! Even though I just smashed my favorite baking dish I am happy to have this spectacular recipe.I'm going to miss my baking dish but I will NEVER forget this recipe since I have it memorized and have shared it with every friend that has the ability to cook. Thank you!

I gave this 5 stars because my father-in-law (who has never said a positive comment about anything in 5 years) said this was the BEST sweet potato dish he's ever tasted.  I don't like sweet potatoes and I made this dish for him and my husband.  Everyone, including me and my 3 children really liked it. I've been changed by your recipe.  Thanks for sharing with us all.

Oh my goodness, this was outstanding! For over 20 yrs I've been mashing my sweet potatoes with a marshmallow topping, so I wanted to change things up a bit and I'm so glad I did. My mother couldn't stop moaning as she was eating it. As soon as my husband took the first bite, he started moaning also then gave a thumbs up and told me how incredible it was. This recipe along with a few more that I tried this year made our Christmas Dinner the best yet. Thank YOU Very Much Heather!

A HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!!  We camp over Thanksgiving and have a hard time finding dishes to make in crock pots for ease of use.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I used truvia and splenda for sugar substitutes and couldn't tell that anything was changed.  We baked the potatoes in the dutch oven first.  I love this recipe!

This was fantastic! Great blend of flavors - cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar - just like a healthy dessert if you make it with less butter (which doesn't really hurt the recipe - I halved the butter).  I would almost say this is one of my favorite recipes.

Embarrassed to say that I am 37 and never made a sweet potato dish!  So my New Year’s resolution
is to try new things, and so this was my 1st  newbie dish for the year!  And we loved it!  I followed the recipe exact and 
will make again with no changes. Thanks for posting.

I made this to take to my MIL's for Thanksgiving.  I baked the sweet potatoes and cut down on the sugar.  They were still very sweet, a little too sweet for my tastes, but my husband raved about them(he rarely raves about anything) and everyone really liked them.

Delicious! I boiled my potatoes for about 35 minutes.  The skins peeled off very easily after that.  I followed the instructions as shown and was very pleased with the results.  Rave reviews all around. Thanks!

Mashed potatoes tasted good.  But I really didn't like the topping.  I would probably like better with mini-marshmallows as traditional way...
also it was too sweet for me.

I had NEVER cooked a sweet potato in my life - (another family member usually brings a Sweet Potato dish to dinner). I baked the sweet potatoes for 35 minutes and when I went to mash them, they were not soft enough throughout to mash! Yikes... I cut the firm parts into ice cube size pieces, mixed in the ingredients, put on the topping and baked it 45 minutes instead of 30... EVERYONE raved about these! A cooking snafu turned into a favorite! (I also used milk instead of heavy cream and cut back to 1/4 cut white sugar as many reviewers suggested). My family will definitely request this again!!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year & received tons of compliments. I added 1/2t coconut extract and 1T Rum to the sweet potatos. Then I added 1/2C of coconut to the topping mixture. Awsome recipe!

These were great! I heard "These are the best sweet potatoes I've ever had!" more than once. I used 1 40 oz can sweet potatoes (about 3 cups) and it definitely did not fill a 9x13 pan so I used a smaller size. It made enough for 9 of us to have 1 small serving so I would double the recipe next time. I veganized this, replacing the butter with Earth Balance non dairy butter, replacing the cream with almond milk, and I was going to use Ener G egg replacer, but I forgot to put it in and it turned out fine! This is definitely a keeper!

WAY too sweet for my liking. Luckily, I made two of these and after tasting the first one I cut the sugar in half for the second one. Only then was it a great dish. Everyone loved it, but we all agreed the first one was too sweet.

I love this recipe! I made this in a crockpot and I did 2 layers of the crumble top in the pot (potatoes, mix, potatoes, mix).  I also doubled the cream so when I re-heated it the next day for the work lunchin in the crock pot, it wouldn't dry out. It turned out great!

I was so excited to see my kids "fight" over this dish as one reviewer mentioned but I was quite disappointed.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar for the sweet potatoes and the kids/critics still found it too sweet.

I took the advice of many and reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe. The result was me having to go online after Thanksgiving dinner to print off the recipe for our guests. Sadly there wasn't any leftovers to enjoy the next day, because everyone ate it all.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic.  I added a little nutmeg with the cinnamon and reduced the amount of sugar.  Everyone loved it.  Tastes a lot like pumpkin pie.  The pecans were a great addition, love the crunchiness.

Loved this recipe - made it to take to Thanksgiving dinner last night - it was a big hit. Baking the sweet potatoes was the easiest way to prepare them - will definitely make this again.

I do not like sweet potatoes and never have.  However, this is pretty good, almost dessert-like.  The topping is what makes this dish.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings using 1 boiled sweet potato, substituted milk for cream (didn't have any) and omitted pecans (didn't have any).

I personally am not a fan of sweet potatoes prepared this way so it wasn't a big surprise when I didn't like this.  I thought it tasted like mashed sweet potatoes with a ton of sugar poured on it but everyone else LOVED it so I'm giving it 4 stars.

So good!! Used another reviewer's suggestion and peeled and cooked just like white potatoes. I cut them up after I peeled them and that was very hard to do as they are much harder than regular potatoes but it made the cooking time much faster.

This was another big Thanksgiving meal hit!  My family loved it.  It is pretty easy to make, although my sweet potatoes took forever to bake until soft enough to mash.  I had to double the length of baking time for them.  I did add a few canned sweet potatoes for nice color.  This recipe makes a large portion as well.  Had a lot of leftovers.  But they were yummy even as a quick snack or to satisfy a sweet tooth.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! Perfect consistency whereas other recipes seem too soupy. I peeled and then boiled the sweet potatoes (I used 3 very large ones). I will definitely be making again as everyone loved them!

This is the best recipe ever! I left out the pecans because my family is not a big fan, but they were amazing. The only thing I messed up on was covering them with aluminum foil half way through cooking. It made some of the topping stick to it which took away from the appearance but they were still good. This was my first Thanksgiving cooking but everyone loved them. My sister who is a critic to everything loved them and my roommate who is from India and does not like a lot of the American foods told me how awesome they were. I will be making this all the time now. I

I've always made the same old baked sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows every year. This year I decided to mix it up and make this. People were literally fighting over the leftovers and already insisting this become our new sweet potato staple. They even asked me to make it for Christmas. The flavor on these were outstanding. I mixed marshmallows into the potato mixture and also topped it with the brown sugar pecan mixture and although it was great it made it too dessert like for my taste. The original recipe for this is perfect, no need for changes!

Made this today because we felt like we missed out a bit on the yams this year (I made them traditional style for Turkey Day and they were pretty much all gone by the end of dinner).  This is the easiest casserole, and I only modified the spices.  In addition to the cinnamon, I added about 1/4 tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of ginger.  I also didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I added buttermilk.  Turned out wonderful!

Great recipe, made as written.  A little too much sugar for our preferences.  I will decrease next time both in the casserole and on top by 1/2.  Although its sweet, its really good!

Yum Yum!  Pretty much followed the recipe, except used fat free half and half and splenda in the potatoes.  I did use real brown sugar in the topping (2/3 c.) and would probably cut back/omit the butter in the mashed potato portion next time ( I don't know what purpose it serves there except to add more calories).  This is a keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious! I made just a few slight changes per my taste and other reviews. I used 1/4 c white sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar in the potato mixture instead of all white sugar. Also, I doubled the ingredients for the topping and added 1/2 c coconut to it and 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well (YUMMY!). Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

This was fabulous. Follow the other suggestions about cutting down the white sugar a bit, and it's basically perfect! I did mine in the crock pot so that I could make it the night before. Here's what I did--lightly Pam your ceramic crock pot, and then put the sweet potato mixture and the topping inside. Put the ceramic pot (not the outer heating mechanism, obviously) in the oven for the 30 minutes, then on broil for a few minutes to really make the topping brown and coat nicely. Let it cool, then you can toss it in the fridge overnight (or whatever you need to do), then put it into the outer crock pot section when you're ready, and just put it on "keep warm" to reheat. It tasted just as good as when I made the regular way!

I used about half the butter and half & half instead of heavy cream.  My husband said it was the best part of Thanksgiving dinner.

Absolutely awesome.  I boiled the potatoes the night before then peeled/mashed the potatoes in the a.m. and put the rest of the ingredients together.   Easy and fantastic.

This was absolutely delicious.  Very sweet, but it's perfect.  My only complaint with the recipe is that my potatoes were still really hard on the inside after baking only 35 min.  I ended up having to microwave them for about 10 min just to get them soft enough to mash.  Next time I think I will just boil them.  I followed the recipe to a tee and I got rave reviews at Thanksgiving!

Very good dish.  I cut back a little on the sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes, but other than that I stuck to the recipe as written.  Everyone said the potatoes were yummy!

My boyfriend picked this recipe out and even cooked it.  It turned out awesome.  Per the suggestions of other reviewers he used 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup white sugar in the yams.  We used yams instead of sweet potatoes.  They came out delightfully sweet but not overbearingly sweet.  Not sure if we'll go back to marshmallow yams after this!

I made this for a church pot luck dinner w/o the flour as we have 2 women with gluten/wheat alergies. It was great! It went over real well, especialy with the gluten girls. I can't really see how the flour could possibly improve on it, so will leave it out in the future as well. I did double the recipe and cheated using 2 large cans of sweet potatoes as I had other things to cook. I am making it again for our family Thanksgiving dinner and have no doubt it will go over just as well there.

Excellent recipe!  Modified the recipe a little~ I used brown sugar instead of white mixed with the sweet potato & cut the amount to 1/4 c.  Thought it may be on the sweet side for others, so when I make this for guest I may cut the sugar out & only add it on the topping.

So yummy!  My Changes: used brown sugar instead of white and added a little honey (bought from a local farmer's market... SO good!); I probably used a little less butter than called for, replaced cream with 1% milk, and used whole wheat flour for the top.  I also probably used more pecans than called for because I like them so much.  This is definitely a keeper!

outstanding!! I have disliked yams my entire life but I decided to try this recipe to try to get into the spirit of thanksgiving and to expose my children to a new side dish with our traditional turkey and since I love brown sugar and pecans I decided to try it. Sweet and delicious!

I submitted this recipe in the American Royal Barbecue contest (the world's largest barbecue contest) last year in the "potato" category.  It won 4th place out of around 500 contestants in the contest.  This is truly the best sweet potato casserole I've ever tried...and apparently the judges agree.  Thanks, Heather, for a great recipe.

Amazing!!  I had no idea how many sweet potatoes to use seeing that they are all so different and all I could find were the jumbo ones.  I ended up using 4 jumbo ones and doubling the recipe for the rest of the ingredients.  It filled one 9x13 pan.

I made this casserole for the first time over Thanksgiving, and it was devoured.  It even prompted my mother-in-law (who is THE cook of the family) to ask me for the recipe, and she will be making this dish for Christmas dinner, instead of her version that she has used for years. Thank you!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 6 potatoes (peeled and then boiled...so easy!), and I also put marshmallows on top of the pecan topping.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I only used 4 sweet potatoes (which I peeled, boiled, then mashed in a Kitchen Aid mixer), and I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream. It did not turn out sweet enough. There was too much sweet potato. I think this would turn out better with more sugar, and less sweet potato. Otherwise, very good!

This was great!  I took the advice of others and reduced the sugars and butter.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I used sweet potatoes instead of yams and used my hand blender to make a smooth puree.  I baked and pureed the potatoes the night before and then mixed it up the next morning, but didn't bake it until after our turkey was done baking for Thanksgiving.  It baked while the turkey rested.  It was perfect timing.

A definite 5-star hit--it even took out the traditional marshmallow top version!  I used Splenda & Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (for the diabetics in the family)& a pinch of orange zest.  Only complaint--not enough left overs!

This was delicious, however the cook time for the potatoes was way off for me. I cooked them in the oven for an hour then peeled and had to steam for an additional hour in order to get them soft enough to smash; which kind of annoyed me because it took three times as long to make as I had anticipated.

Yum! I never use the 1/2 cup white sugar and instead use 1/4 cup brown sugar in the casserole. I also reduce the 3/4 cup brown sugar in the topping to no more than 1/3 cup brown sugar.  It's still very sweet this way.  The 2 Tbs. of whipping cream adds a nice flavor, too.  It might need a little more cinnamon up to 1 teaspoon, but check the flavor as you go.

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner party. And everybody raved about it!!   Made a few substitutions to make this recipe a tad bit healthier, as other users have done. I subbed in Smart Balance butter for real butter, Splenda brown sugar mix for the sugar, and lowfat milk for the heavy cream. I had some sliced almonds on hand so I also subbed those in for the pecans. I've noticed the brown sugar helps a lot in reducing some of the sweetness. One other thing, I tend to like the casserole a little more firm, so in order to achieve that, add in an extra egg (or liquid egg whites as I did).   This will be a staple at every holiday dinner. Thanks for the great recipe!!

My mom has never, ever said anything about a sweet potato casserole. She just always says it's good. Last year, I made this recipe and my mom made clear to me that I am to make this again. I didn't do anything different, I made it exactly the way it said and it was delicious! There was nothing left!

This was a major hit with the family on thanksgiving. We have a nut allergy in the family thought, so I turned the topping into a crumple by swapping the nuts for oats and adding a little bit more butter to the mix, everyone loved it!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Especially the crunchy, delicious topping. My only complaint is that this recipe is a little sweet - I would probably cut back on the sugar a little. However, with less or the same amount of sugar, this is fantastic! Whole family loved it.

Have been making this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas for many years now and feel like I've got it down to a bit of a science. 
1. Sweet potato/yams - I buy the 3 pound bags at Costco and to fill a 9X13 pan, need close to 6 pounds which is a lot more than 5 of their sweet potatoes.  When I don't have enough, I put them in an 8x8 pan.  
2. Topping - for an 8X8 in pan, this is enough topping, but definitely needs to be doubled for a 13x9 in pan if not tripled.  You'll see if you try to get away with just one batch that you'll have to make more.
3. Sugar - I use regular splenda for the white sugar and brown sugar Splenda for the brown. Just remember that while the regular splenda measures cup for cup like white sugar, the brown sugar splenda is twice as sweet as regular brown sugar so only use half the amount. Tastes the same as when I make it with real sugar/brown sugar so why waste the calories :)
4. Pecans - when I don't have them, I don't use them and it's not a big deal. Non-nut fans like my hubby prefer it without.  
5. Greasing pan - there's so much butter etc in this that no need to grease pan. I forgot once and never bothered again. 
6.  Make ahead - for the holidays, I usually make the potato mixture the day before and then the next day add the topping and bake.  If you leave it out for an hour or two to get it to room temp, cooking time is the same.

THIS IS BEST SWEET POTATOE RECIPE I HAVE EVER TRIED!!! Thank you sooo much! Year after year I've been trying sweet potatoe/yam recipes one after the other and have never been too happy with the results.  Sweet potatoes or candied yams being my Mom's all-time favorite holiday dish, I really needed to find a recipe to please her taste buds as well as my own.  THIS WAS DEFINATELY A PLEASER!  I, for the most part followed the recipe exactly except for a few minor changes.  I used 3 very large yams instead of sweet potatoes.  Also, instead of using a pastry blender to make the topping, I just put the sugar, COLD butter, flour and pecan mixture in my food processor and pulsed until it resulted in a cornmeal like texture. (Note: the recipe calls for 1/4 c. of butter and a 1/4 c. butter, SOFTENED but doesn't specify which is used for what.  I used COLD butter for topping) Then I added some extra chopped pecans right on top for presentation and texture.  My Mom is not a fan of mashing the sweet potatoes/yams so she was a little skeptical but after tasting this she was quick to change the way she felt about it.  That sweet crunch to the topping paired againts the sweet creamy consistency of the yams were AMAZING!!!  Thanks again!  You hit the jackpot with this recipe :)

WOW!  This was SUCH a hit at Thanksgiving.  I've read reviews about it being 'too' sweet, but not for us.  Everyone simply ate it up.  I made a double serving as we were feeing 18 and there was not a bit of it left.  The only changes I made were adding brown sugar to the sweet potato mix, and instead of nuts (we are not fans) I used crushed cinnamon graham crackers.  It was FANTASTIC!  So much better than the silly marshmallow stuff.

My & half of my guests do not even like sweet potatoes but each & everyone of us loved this casserole. Out of 5 side dishes, this was the 1st one to be eaten up! Kids & adults will love this! I tried baking htem, but they were still really hard so I peeled them up, placed them in boiling water(like I do when making regular mashed potatoes) until they were really soft (maybe 15 minutes), drain them & they were so easy to mash up after that.

Instead of cooking the sweet potatoes, I purchased one 40oz can and one 15oz can of orange and pineapple flavored sweet potatoes. This did give a little extra depth in flavor and a little less time in the kitchen. Next time I will add a little more cream and butter for a smother creamier texture. All and all this is a great recipe.

Love this recipe! I could not find another 9 x 13 baking dish, (they were all full), so I had to bake this in a 7" round casserole.  I had so much extra topping, but I put it on the potatoes anyway. It was like pecan pie on top of sweet potatos!

A huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I will definitely be making this again.  I put my sweet potatoes in a food processor after I mashed them (just to get the lumps out - blend too long and they get starchy).  They came out very smooth and baked up wonderfully.  I made this for a house full of male hunters, and they all went back for seconds!  :)

this recipe is the best one for sweet potatoes i have ever made! every year i try a different one for Thanksgiving, but no more! this is 'the one'!  i did, however, cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup and the brown sugar on top to 1 cup, we don't like it too sweet. i also loaded up on vanilla, cinammon and a little nutmeg.  it came out wonderfully, light and just sweet enough! thanks so much for sharing!

Oh so yummy.  Very moist and rich.  The grandkids had to cook Christmas dinner, so I brought this dish.  It was the only dish given special notice for its taste.  : )  I doubled the recipe and still used only one 9x13 dish to retain a kind of carmelized goodness.

The first time I made "Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic", I was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner!  Now when I am asked to take a dish to a potluck, family gathering, this is the one that is always requested.  I brought this to a church dinner yesterday and took home an empty casserole!  Fantastic recipe and so beautifully easy!!!

Very sweet. I forgot to listen to other reviewers who suggested cutting back the sugar to 1/4 c.  I will definitely make next time with less sugar than this will get 5 stars.  The topping is yummy.

This was a really big hit at our Thanksgiving table.  The only change I made was to peel and boil the sweet potatoes like regular potatoes.  This seemed a lot easier to me than what the recipe suggests.  I made this the day before, then baked it just before dinner.  I was afraid this would affect the topping somehow, but it was great!

I looked and looked for the right sweet potato recipe, and this is it!  I made this for a group and everyone loved it, including people who don't normally like sweet potatoes.  When I went to the store, I didn't know the difference between sweet potatoes and yams, so I got three yams and two sweet potatoes.  I also cooked in the oven for 50 minutes, not 35 (I am at a high altitude- don't know if this makes a difference).  I was worried when the sweet potatoes didn't mash up as well as the yams (they were a bit chunky), but it was actually better this way.

This recipe was great!  I took this dish to my boyfriend's Family Thanksgiving.  Everyone liked it a lot, and most admitted that they did not like sweet potatoes otherwise, but tried it to please me.  I have now been informed that I am to bring it every year to Thanksgiving.  (I skipped the nuts on accident because I forgot to buy them... I think I will leave them off in the future too)

I realize that no more reviews are needed, but I was so pleased with my results that I had to share. This is hands down the BEST sweet potato casserole I have ever tasted. Way beyond the typical marshmallow style recipe.  Try this and you will NEVER GO BACK!!

This dish was outstanding!  I made it the night before and added the topping right before I popped it in the oven.  I would highly recommend this sweet potato dish to anyone who would like a more elegant side dish.

As a child, I ate the sweet potato- marshmallow recipe (which I hated) About 5 years ago, I discovered this recipe.  It is AMAZING!!! My family loves it! I use one 40oz can of yams but next time I am going to try fresh. Thanks!

My husband loved these. He thought they reminded him of the ones at Boston Market only better! I will be making this again and again, and i will double this to make sure everyone can have seconds. I did exactly as the recipe said and baked the potatoes but i had to microwave them a little after 35 minutes before mashing. Next time i think i will just microwave them and save a little more time. Excellent recipe! Very Sweet!

Oh So Delicious!!!  I made this for a small get together and it was a hit.  Even those who do not like sweet potatoes had a helping.  Some ate it with their dinner and others ate it as a dessert.  I replaced half of the flour with quick cooking oats and it turned out soooo good.  I will definitely make this again. Many thanks Heather.

My kids loved this, especially when I told them it had brown sugar in it!  I didn't add any sugar to the sweet potato and it was still excelllent.  Very easy to make and I have been eating the leftovers for lunch.

As a Christmas present to my Dad, I prepared the Christmas Day feast, tailored to fit his diet. He can't eat meats or high-fat foods, he has teeth problems, and he especially enjoys complex flavors and foods that are similar to what he ate as a child growing up on a farm. This was the PERFECT main dish for the meal. He adores sweet potatoes, as well as pecans, brown sugar, and the various other flavors that were evident in this dish. It was flavorful, light, soft on his teeth, and everything he wanted! He was most pleased with this dish. I was too. He is going to be reheating this for the next week for meals, and I'm sure it will be just as good at each reheating.

Everyone at our Thanksgiving table adored this dish which we've renamed "Yums".  My very lactose-intolerant father had no problem with the small amount of dairy in this dish and loved it.  I asked my husband if he wanted it again at Christmas and his eyes lit up!

I also cut back on the sugar as suggested by others and will do so again this time as a little sweet goes a long way in our house.

Been looking for a recipe that tasted like the sweet potato casserole I once tasted
at a potluck in Texas.  The one who brought it said it was from No. Carolina and
she didn't like to share the recipe.  The Gourmet Sweet Potato recipe tastes just like
it-----delicious!  Everyone loved it!

I made this for the first time and it was amazing! It was a huge hit and I received lots of compliments and didn’t get any leftovers to take home!! I peeled and boiled cut up potatoes instead of baking. I wanted a smooth mash. I used the whisk on the KitchenAid to mash. That worked excellently.

This was so delicious! It is one of those recipes where you are sad when there are no more servings left.  I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh (one 40 oz. can and one 29 oz. can).  I drained the sweet potatoes, put them in a bowl, and microwaved them so that they would be warm for the mixing in of the other ingredients.  Other than that, I made as written and it was awesome!

I tried this one for Mother's Day!  Got the best reviews, my mom told me she could have just eaten all this one and nothing else.. but she did :).  It's a deliciously good recipe.  I didn't have heavy cream on hand, I just used regular evaporated milk, one thing, if you decide to boil the potatoes instead of baking.. don't over boil or use maybe six potatoes instead. other than that, perfect..-Charlotta, AR

I made this recipe on Jan 9, 2015, for 50 people (good thing the recipe adjustment function goes that far!) and it was a huge hit. It smelled so good while it was baking that it was all I could do to keep from digging into it. I was concerned that some people might have nut allergies so I subbed graham cracker crumbs for the pecans, but if it had been for my family, I would have used pecans.

This is my favorite sweet potato casserole recipe. I had to use all brown sugar and it is just decadent. Its so good that it was the first dish to disappear on Christmas and we all wanted more. So, I'm making it again today for New years day using eight taters(baked for 2 hours) and an extra egg. Its very good cold,Think crustless sweet potato pie!

I made it 12/29/2014, and I also took the review advice and used 1/3 C white sugar and 2/3 C light brown sugar. Used chopped hazelnuts instead of pecans! I thought it tasted awesome!

These were wonderful. I used 10 lbs of potatoes and then altered the ingredients. It made more than a crockpot of potatoes. Everyone LOVED them.

It is so simple to make and delicious. My only issue was the time they suggest to cook sweet potatoes in the oven, depending on the size of the sweet potatoes is may take longer. I had what I considered medium size potatoes it took way longer than 35 mins in oven. I prefer to boil them anyway.I love the pecan crust, it is perfect.

Had this for Christmas Eve dinner.  Made it the day before which was nice.  Used canned sweet potatoes.  Cut back on the sugars but it was still too sweet for us.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and am going to make it again for 
Christmas.  Even people not big on yams loved this.  As like others, I cut back on the amount of the white and brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I have been making this recipe for a few years and everyone loves it. I did not use the eggs since some of us are allergic to them, but it is yummy just the same. I don't measure anything any more just put in everything and taste for flavor. I used heavy cream the first time, but now I use low fat sour cream and it works just as well. Thank you for the recipe...it's a keeper!

Perfect. The recipe is 100% perfect as written. I use the largest sweet potatoes that I can find. I have also made this recipe dairy free using vegan butter sticks in place of the butter and soy milk in place of the cream and it is surprisingly very good that way too.

I have only made this without using any sugar in the potatoes or the sugary/nut topping b/c I have diabetics in my family, but it is DELICIOUS!!  You don't need any of that stuff and it is still awesome!
This is how I will make sweet potatoes forevermore!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  Huge hit! No need to peel after baking, for me when I cut them in half, they skin just peeled off by hand.  Can't wait to make it again!

Totally Delish! I used 2, 40oz sized and 1 regular sized can of Bruce's yams (drained) and cut the white sugar in half because the yams are already sweetened. I just skipped to #3 of the recipe and mashed those up in a bowl instead of cooking any sweet potatoes and it turned out perfectly! My husband said it was his favorite thing at the Thanksgiving table! I plan on making it again at Christmas! You were right...I'll never go back to the sweet potatoes with marshmallows. :)

To hurry up the roasting process, I like to peel the sweet potatoes, cut into 1 inch chunks and toss them with a little butter and sea salt and roast them for 20-25 minutes. I find that it's not only quicker, but the flavor is much better. My youngest boy and I think this is one of the best parts of a holiday meal. He and I both ate our fill of this casserole.

I followed the advice and did 1/3 c white sugar and 2/3 c of brown sugar.  Baked and then peeled the potatoes.  We also made it even sweeter by adding the marshmallows.  It turned out amazing!  More of a dessert though.  Took place of my pies.  But a lot easier to make, I feel. I prepared it the night before Thanksgiving and baked it on Thanksgiving Day.  Turned out beautifully. Would definitely recommend.

My daughter made these for Thanksgiving dinner. I hate peeling raw sweet potatoes because they are so hard. I didn't have room in the oven to bake them, so we boiled them whole and in the peels.  When they were done, we sliced off each end and cut a slit down the middle.  The potatoes slipped right out of the peels.  There wasn't enough topping to cover the 13x9 inch dish.  Rather than make more, we filled in the gaps with mini marshmallows after baking.  We returned the dish to the oven long enough to brown the marshmallows.  Next time, we'll double the marshmallows.  Great holiday recipe!

We liked this.  Not a 5 star - not gourmet but very good anyway.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 T. of Tsar Dust Memories seasoning from Penzeys.  It has a hint of garlic, marjoram along with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice so it adds a little more depth of flavor.  Everyone who ate it loved it with the exeption of one person who wanted marshmallows on her - so I put some on hers and stuck in the microwave to puff up the marshmallows and she was also happy!  LOL - similar to my regular recipe but this one has less seasoning in it.  You can't go wrong with this one.

Tried this for the first time at our family Thanksgiving dinner. It was a hit! I was so pleasantly surprised by how light and fluffy the texture was. Delicious!

Really enjoyed this.  I actually forgot to add the sugar and cream but the topping made it sweet enough.  It was a popular dish at my Thanksgiving table!

Love it, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup of brown sugar as suggested by others and thought it was sweet enough.  Thanks!

Delicious! Quadrupled the recipe for a larger crowd. As per others' recommendations, I used 1/2 to 3/4 of the sugar called for in the recipe.  I also assembled everything a day earlier, and popped in the oven the next day for the party... cooked alongside the ham, and made everything a breeze.  As many others have commented, I was asked for the recipe numerous times, and was almost begged for the leftovers :-)  . Great recipe!

This was super yummy!  I used my steamer, which made the skin peel right off, then mash away!  They have to steam extra long so they're ready to mash, but it was so easy!  Will def make again!

I tried 4 diff recipes and this is the winner for me. I turned it into twice baked potatoes. Though rich, the texture is light and doesn't alter the taste of the sweet potatoes. I don't mind the extra calories for a special occasion but I may try variations of this so I can justify having it more often, such as; blending the potatoes with califlower or carrots and using half n half. Cudos!

This was fantastic! I'm allergic to nuts, so I substituted them with oats - made a GREAT sweet crumble topping. And like other reviewers, cut down on the sugar just a tad - was still plenty sweet. Will definitely make again. (Peeled, cubed, and boiled potatoes. Then mashed with hand mixer, which was great at getting the stringy bits out.)

I will definitely be making this again! Wow! I made it as a side dish with turkey dinner, but this was like dessert. I cooked sweet potatoes in microwave in a Zip-n-steam bag to save time. That worked well. This recipe is a winner!

This is our all time favorite for sweet potato casseroles!  The only variation we do it to DOUBLE the topping so that noone can argue about who got more "good stuff!"  We also take it to events and get lots of compliments on it.  I occasionally use canned sweet potatoes if I am low on time, but it is better with fresh sweet potatoes.

The best sweet potato recipe I have ever had!!! I reduced the sugar in both the potatoes and the topping and it was perfect. Even people who don't like sweet potatoes loved this. I spent more time writing down the recipe to keep up with requests than I did enjoying the holiday!

We've had this recipe for several years now. I got it from a true southern belle! Although we use a hint of clove and a splash of bourbon (instead of vanilla) and reduce the sugar as mentioned elsewhere..  My family of mis-placed northerners INSIST that this is part of the Thanksgiving table, its even migrated to Easter also....

I used two big cans of sweet potatoes, a bit less butter and half & half instead of heavy cream. I think it was bit too heavy on the brown sugar, maybe next time I'll reduce it a bit and increase the flour a touch. Not bad though.

Made these for Thanksgiving and no one touched them.  My husband and I thought they were pretty good, but neither of us is a huge sweet potato fan so I don't think I can give this recipe a fair rating.

These were a huge hit at our 'belated' Thanksgiving this past Saturday.  I even messed up the recipe and it still came out great!  Thanks for such a yummy and forgiving recipe!  My in laws loved them and so did my husband (I was bringing leftovers to my in laws and he made me leave a container of it at home!) Thanks Heather!

Quite good!  Boiled the potatoes and put everything together in advance.  Used milk in place of cream.  I used very big potatoes and cut back on the sugar; next time I may use more sugar.  Will definitely make this again.

Simply delicious!! Just as Heather said, I will never go back to the marshmallow-topped yam casserole again.  Tripled this recipe (about 7 cups of sweet potatoes) for 22 people.  It was a hit. They raved about it and ate it all!  First time that has happened. I also reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup as someone else suggested, used brown sugar for the remaining and added some orange juice.

This recipe was really good, but needed a few tweaks. I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract, only used brown sugar and played around with the spices until the sweet potato mixture tasted right to me. I only used 3 large yams, which worked out to be plenty. I also doubled the topping. Very good with a few changes.

This was soooo good! I had compliments from everyone! I made this with 1% milk and it came out awesome.  I also added marshmellows on top because I can't have Thanksgiving without marshmellow sweet potato cassarole.  I plan on making this again and again. THANK YOU!

Simply the best sweet potatoes you can make. We used mini marshmallows on top instead of pecans.

So good, tasted almost like pumpkin pie.  I had to bake the sweet potatoes a lot longer than 35 min, more like 1hr 15min.  Used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. So tasty, will make every year.

I followed the recipe except that I used a marshmallow topping instead of the pecan topping and it was amazing. My husband said it was the best sweet potato casserole he's ever eaten.

I give it 5 stars like everybody else!  I used 5 fairly large yams.  After mashing them up it came to about 10 cups.  I was afraid the egg mixture wouldn't be enough but it turned out just fine.  Wasn't too dry or mushy.  Like others said, I ended up baking my yams for an hour.  30 min. wasn't enough.  I didn't have heavy cream but read the reviews of others using milk so I used whole milk instead, and it turned out great.  I did have to double the crumb topping though as it wasn't enough.  I made a batch w/o the pecans for those w/allergies, and it was still just as tasty.  May leave out the pecans next time so I don't have to make 2 batches.  This recipe is a keeper.  Reminds me of the sweet potatoes that Boston Market serves.

Delicious.  It is more like a dessert.  You could easily drop the sugar down to 1/3 cup or less in the sweet potato mix and not miss it. My family is stuck on the marshmalow version but I can't understand why.  Old habits die hard but I think this is much better.

I tried this recipe today and it was a total hit. Everyone loved it. I don't know if it was just me but I put the potatoes in the oven for 30 minutes like it said and it didn't work! My mother-in-law had to come help me figure out what to do with them. Good thing that after boiling them for half an hour(peeled and chopped up), they finally softened enough so that I could mash them up. Overall great recipe!

I have to confess that I skipped the nut topping and still went with marshmallows.  This was awesome and got people who don't like sweet potatoes to eat sweet potatoes.  This is a winner with no needed changes.

This is amazing!  I have to admit, I bought a can of sweet potatos and wanted to do something different with them.  I came across this recipe so I decided to try.  I did add 1/4 tsp nutmeg & ground clover, Yum!!  Next time, I will cut the sugar mixture in half in both areas.   Nice change from marshmellows!!  Excited to make this for Christmas.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Used 4 sweet potatoes and 1 huge yam for color.  Put no sugar in base,1/2t salt, used skim milk.  Topping as directed.  Mom can't have nuts, so I topped one corner with a crunched up Granola bar...mmmm.  Pretty darned good.  I hate SWEET sweet potatoes, this was much better.

I have been making this recipe for years, with a few seasoning alterations, and it's always a huge hit!  It is almost identical to another recipe I found on this website called Praline Sweet Potatoes.  Try them, you will never look back to the old marshmallow version!!

Perfect!!  I had a similar sweet potato recipe, but this one is even better.  The only things I did differently were boil the potatoes to cook them and double the nuts, but that was because I had already bought them for the other recipe.  I served these at a book club dinner and everyone loved them and several requested the recipe.  SO GOOD!

We've been making my husband's grandmother's recipe for this for years and I was skeptical of trying this recipe because I didn't think there was any way it could be better.  While not that much different, I did actually like it better!  It is delicious!!!  I will say that I think all the sugar is unnecessary. Notes: I got 5 of the biggest sweet potatoes I could find, softened the butter (recipe didn't specify for the potato mixture), did 1/3c. white sugar (next time will do 1/4c. or maybe even omit), will probably just use 2% milk next time instead of whipping cream, and I only used 1/2c. brown sugar for topping which was perfect. Definitely perfect as is, these are just my more "health conscious" changes.

YUMMM!! No one in my family likes sweet potatoes (despite how healthy they are for you) But they LOVE this recipe! I made it exactly how it is written (I don't normally do that) and it was fantastic! Thanks!

I have been making this from this recipe for years and the only thing I change is the quantity of sweet potatoes, I find the quantity isn't enough so I at least double it and obviously the rest of the ingredients.  It is perfect and I am asked to bring it every to most pot lucks.

This is a tasty sweet potato casserole recipe.  I followed the directions to a T and it came out very nice.  Not as creamy as I would have liked but still very good.

To cook the sweet potatoes to make them soft, you might want to try peeling and chopping the sweet potatoes into cubes. Then put them on a cookie sheet and cover the cookie sheet with a cake pan. I did this and the sweet potatoes got really soft in about 15 or 20 minutes and they were SO EASY to mash! It was easier than waiting for them to bake with a lot less mess. Other than that I also cut the amout of white sugar, but doubled the recipie for the brown sugar topping. I made it in a longer pan than it says to so this was necessary to coat the whole thing. They turned out absolutely amazing!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I do have to say this was my first attempt and also the first time eating a sweet potato casserole and I was very pleased!  I decided to make this for thanksgiving along with candied sweet potatoes that we have every year.  I wanted something different, and Im glad I did!  This recipe is going to have to be a staple every year now!  I did double the topping mixture.  While I was mixing it, it didnt turn into crumbles.  It basically turned into a dough.  But it still came out all sticky and carmelized on top and was delicious!  I also only added 1 egg, doubled the cinnamon, added a little more vanilla, and used half brown and half white sugar in the potatoes.  This was devoured and I will make this again and again.  A favorite for sure!  Thank you for the recipe!  10 stars!

I know I'm going against popular opinion here, but this recipe must be for those who don't like sweet potatoes. It tasted more like very sweet pumpkin pie than a sweet potato side dish. I did however like the topping and think that if the brown sugar was halved and the white sugar was entirely omited, it would be much improved.

I was looking for  a sweet potato recipe to make instead of our families traditional marsh/topped version.  Everybody loved this dish, they thought it was very good and asked me to make it again the next weekend, it was a big hit, I did not think it was too sweet.  Marsh/version much sweeter. Will never make the marsh version again.

This is the BEST!! I have never made sweet potato anything, but have eaten it a few times. My husband was very hesitant to have me try it for Thanksgiving as he "doesn't like Sweet Potatoes". I made it with only 2 Small variations and it was awesome! My husband had 3 servings of it!! :) Change#1... cut the sugar in half.   Change#2... used chopped walnuts instead of pecans as that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe. It'll be a standard now at our place.

I overheard my 15 year old niece tell her friend that this was "da bomb"! I didn't read the recipe as well as I should have and ended up adding brown sugar instead of white sugar to the sweet potato mix. I'll probably make it this way again just because it was the perfect sweetness for my family. I also add crushed Frosted Flakes to the topping mixture.

I grew up with the marshmallow-topped variety. My husband grew up with plain baked sweet potatoes. I wanted to try something new this year, so we gave this one a whirl. Oh, my goodness! YUMMY! I don't think I will even bother looking further. I baked the sweet potatoes for over an hour until they were very tender. I had read in other reviews that baking brings out the full flavor of the potatoes (rather than boiling or microwaving). It also eliminates the need to peel and chop. Once out of the oven and slightly cooled, simply cut them in half, hold with pot holder and give them a squeeze. The flesh pops out of the skin very easily.  I also used milk instead of cream and it was still delicious.  That was the only change I made this first time because I did not want to experiment too much for Thanksgiving dinner.  Next time, I may try to cut out some more calories/fat by adjusting sugars/butter/etc.  The whole family loved them. It was a definte hit.  Thank you!

Delicious!  I've made this two Thanksgivings in a row, and it's a big hit.  I sub skim milk for heavy cream and boil the potatoes rather than baking them, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  It's fabulous.  It may well become our family tradition, provided that I can persuade my husband that sweet potatoes do NOT need marshmallows to be delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

couldn't be any easier or better!!! You gotta try it, I did it last year twice-once with sweet potatoes and once with canned sweet potatoes. Never will I ever do canned again!!! Also, I used skim milk instead of the heavy cream. Still fabulous!! I use walnuts instead of pecans and it tastes so so good! My husband is so excited for this years holidays!!

I used 8 small/medium sized sweet potatoes, which I think came out to about 4-5 cups after mashing.  I still used the same recommended amounts of sugar, etc... and this dish was still quite sweet.  I added extra pecans for the topping, and also added extra pumpkin pie spices.  Even though I would have preferred it to be a little less sweet... and due to my spice additions, it tasted more like pecan pumpkin pie than sweet potatoes... it was the hit of my pal's Friendsgiving Potluck party.

This is probably the best sweet potato casserole my family has ever tasted. My mom put me in charge of sweet potato casserole last Thanksgiving. I found this recipe and used it. She requested it again for Christmas...and again this Thanksgiving. The only change I would make is to cut back on the white sugar. I use 1/4 cup instead of 1/2. Yummy yummy yummy!!!

I expected this to be so good, but was disappointed. This dish should go on the dessert table; way too much sugar, and I cut the sugar by half in the yam mixture! The baked consistency was oddly dry. Won't make this one again.

YUM!! Way too much sugar, though. We used 1/3 the recommended sugar and just half the butter. It was still decadent. Save yourself the calories.

I used this recipe on Thanksgiving for the first time and then several times since-very good and rich. I omit the pecans-not a nut fan. and put in ramkins with mini-mellows on top and brown with my torch.  Presentation is great. Thanks

I make this casserole every Thanksgiving and Christmas and a few other times throughout the year just for fun. This is a family favorite for us.   My husband claims that this casserole is the reason he married me. He said it just took one bite and he knew he had to marry me.

my husband loathes sweet potatoes. I made this dish for the first time tonight and he enjoyed it so much that he was stealing them off my plate. I couldn't believe my ears when he said that they were "divine"!My brother loved it too. third helpings were had by all. Excellent recipe and so simple to prepare. very rewarding to have made. It was suggested that this could even have been served as desert with cream/ice cream.

Just to remind everybody, microwaving vegetables removes most of their nutritional value!! Always better to boil, steam, or oven cook them !!

This was delish (but the marshmallow topped kind will always hold a place in my heart).  Got rave reviews from my family on one.  Even my teenage son, who always skips the sweet potatoes, enjoyed these.

This was excellent, not overly sweet like some casseroles. I used 1/3 cup white sugar and vanilla creamer in place of heavy cream because I didn't have any on hand! This is staying in the file for next year!

I have made this recipe four times and am making it a 5th as I type this.  As one who's always counting calories, I DO love to eat this but I have tweaked it a bit.  Instead of 1/2 c. of white sugar, I add 1/3 c. of a sugar/truvia blend.  I also substitute light cream for heavy cream and reduce the butter by one Tbsp. on the second part of the recipe.  I also reduce the light brown sugar to 1/2 c. and add in 1/2 tsp. allspice with the cinnamon (while not reducing the cinnamon).  Please note that my reductions are approximate but likely extremely accurate as I do not measure when I cook unless I'm baking but I am 100% confident in my "new" measurements.  The end result ALWAYS gets raves!

The absolute best! I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws this year (where only one person likes sweet potatos) they were literally fighting over the leftovers! I have added this to my recipe book and will make it every year. *I did make extra topping mixture, about 1 and 1/2 instead of 1.

This was wonderful!  I used 6 large sweet potatoes and then followed the recipe exactly as stated - oh, but i did add a few large marshmallows in the middle layer which added a little extra sweetness.  I didn't find this to be too sweet at all, but maybe that was because of the size of the potatoes I used...  Anyway, I made this for Thanksgiving with my family and everyone really loved it.  I will definitely make this again - it's delicious!

Absolutely 5 stars, was the hit of Thanksgiving. I hate marshmallow on this so this topping was AWESEOME. I used 5 pretty big sweet potatoes, cut back the sugar a bit per PP, ( 1/3 cup white, 2/3 cup brown) and it has officially become the sweet potato recipe for Thanksgivings to come!

OH MY!  I LOVE this recipe!  I cut back a little in the sugars and it is still delicious!  Next year I will make more than a single recipe since there are no leftovers!  That is the only bad thing about this recipe is that it is too good!

Great recipe and easy to make! I got rave reviews at a work potluck for this. I switched out the cinnamon for ginger and used a mix of pecans and cashews for the crust.

This was sooo good!!
I used 6 sweet potatoes because one was kind of small, and it was perfect amount for a 9 X 13. 
I cooked it for thirty minutes then stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown up the top and it was SO GOOD. 
I didn't need dessert with this recipe. I definitely will make it again! thanks!

This was elegant and tasty. I'd double the topping for a 9x13, and cut the brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup.

Yummy! I used a 9x9 insulated baking pan & I think it worked perfect. I did combine the salt, sugar, & cinnamon in a small bowl before adding to the mashed mixture of eggs, vanilla, cream, melted butter, & sweet potatoes. Make sure to not melt the butter for the topping- the texture won't be right. (I nuked it a little too long to soften) Used 5 pretty big sweet potatoes & nuked 'em. (peeling afterwards) Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe. It's a keeper.

Another 5 star review.  this was a fantastic addition to my late Thanksgiving dinner.  I think I had small potatoes so it didn't make a 13x9 pan. I just cut back on  ingredients.  I can't say anything but it was awesome!  Thanks Heather!

This was my second year to make this dish...and I always get the best feedback. My neighbor doesn't care for sweet potatos and asked me, "Is this pumpkin??"  She l-o-v-e-d this dish and wants the recipe.  I buy fresh sweets and baked them for 40 minutes...

These were absolutely great!! My hubby doesn't even like sweet potatos and had three helpings and my kids loved it. Next time I am going to replace the pecans with oatmeal.

We found this way too sweet.  Next time, I'd cut the sugar way down.  The crunchy topping was good, though.

My family loved this. I 1/2 the recipe and it still filled a 8x8 baking dish. Next time I will double the topping. We will be eating this alot. I wish I'd had this recipe during the holidays!

I love sweet potato's natural flavor. I swear I could eat them every day! I loved this dish. The ingredients played up the natural flavor of the potaotos. My boyfriend and I loved it. The only thing I would change next time was the crust. It was fantastic but a little too sweet. I would most definetly cut the sugar in half and only use it to sprinle over the dish instead of used as a thick crust. It still would be very sweet just not so much of a desert dish. Otherwise it was amazing.!!!

I brought this dish to my dad's for Christams dinner and to a Boxing Day potluck... it was DEELICIOUS... I used a loaf pan because it was all I had available at the time but next time I would definitely use a 9x13 pan in order to stretch out the amazing topping... will definitely make again...

Delicious and easy for make ahead.  A good dish for once a year -- we eat sweet potatoes often and the amount of sugar & cream in this dish was over the top for our tastes.  Perfect for Xmas.;>

Excellent! I've been searching for a good sweet potato recipe for years and this is it! All others get tossed! Served for Thanksgiving this year and literally got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Most sweet potato recipes taste like desserts because of their sweetness. This, however, is just right. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

OH MY! These were a HUGE hit!! I was a little nervous bringing sweet potatoes to a home where no one is a fan.....but these dissapeared SO fast! They are perfectly sweet and tastey and really are more like a dessert! Instead of a 9x13 I used a 9" casserole dish, turned down the oven to 325* and cooked for about 45 min. Excellent!

I'm adding my voice to the list of those who loved this.  People raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I changed just a few things.  I used canned yams for convience, I cut back on the sugar, increased the amount of spices (used double the cinniman, added nutmeg and ginger, and used twice the amount of pecans in the topping.  I used Splenda, Eggbeaters, and light margerine instead of the high calorie, high fat ingredients.  I used two 40 oz. cans of yams and the equivalent of three eggs and had to bake it for about 40-45 minutes, but I left it in a 9 x 13 pan.

Excellent potatoes. I didn't have pecans so I used slivered almonds and it still turned out wonderful. My daughter who doesn't like sweet potatoes thought it was wonderful. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was looking to make something "different".....and this it the spot!!!  My family raved about this dish for days...I was a little nervous when I made this because I accidently used brown sugar where it called for white sugar...It came out great.  Needless to say, the second time I made it, everyone said "I hope you messed it up again!"

I am not a sweet potato fan, so I've avoided fixing them for years.  When I saw this recipe I decided to give it a try.  According to the sweet potato lovers in my family, it is an absolute must from now on.  I have now made it twice, once with Splenda white and brown sugars (for a diabetic) and once with regular sugars.  Also, I didn't have any heavy cream so I used egg nog....WOW!  For once we didn't have left overs to beg people to take home, they were asking for the leftovers!

This recipe is the best!  I have made it for every holiday over the past few years and it's always the first thing to go!  It's a little on the sweet side, so you might want to cut back a bit on the brown sugar.  No more marshmallows for me!

This is a great recipe but I have changed it to suit our tastes.

I omit the cream and flour.  
I add 2 heaping tablespoons of orange juice concentrate and replace the white sugar with brown sugar for a deeper, richer taste.

This was a very good sidedish.  My 18 montb old and 3 yr old loved it!  It's a little sweet for my tastes so next time I think I'll decrease the sugar in the sweet potato as well as the brown sugar on top.

Wow! I have never gotten such wonderful reviews for my sweet potatoes as I did this year. Even my diehard marshmallow topping lovers raved about this and have already requested it again for next Thanksgiving (if not sooner).

This is my families favorite sweet potato recipe so far.  I've made this twice now and it looks like it's a lock-in when it comes to Thanksgiving.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves creamy sweet potatoes without the marshmallows.

I'd eaten Sweet Potato casserole like this at Derby Dinner Theater and this is the closest recipe to it.  I bake this for Thanksgiving or X-mas dinners.  Everyone just raves over it.   The Cinnamon and Vanilla in this recipe makes it stand above the rest.  J.M.

This was okay. Not out of this world, but decent. I think it would be better if there was a more uniform measurement for the sweet potatoes...such as, 3 cups or what have you, because I had big sweet potatoes and it wasn't very sweet with the amounts...I'm sure I needed to get smaller sweet potatoes, but like I said, there's no real standard and that could make all the difference.

Great recipe!  I don't like sweet potatoes at all and this wasn't my favorite dish, but everyone else loved it!  I made it for a dinner party and again for Thanksgiving just because others liked it so well.  Even though I don't like sweet potatoes, I did like the topping!

This recipe was really good.  The sweet is a nice contrast to all the other salty dishes around the Thanksgiving table.  I made it the night before and warmed it up the next day.  Will definitely make again.

AWESOME!!!  I made a similar dish the last two years which was very good but so much work!!  I wanted something a little easier and this was it; still some work though!  I boiled the potatoes so it added a little time to the recipe.  Overall, they were the best thing at Thanksgiving this year!  I rec'd so many compliments!

This is a great recipe! I used yams instead of sweet potatoes- and it was wonderful. I bake my yams for about 35-40 minutes, instead of boiling.  The skins peel off so much easier this way.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar throughout the entire recipe and it wasn't too sweet at all. This is very good left over.  Heats up really nice. My husbands side of the family are not the adventuresome types.  They arent open to anything 'new', but some tried this and loved it.  Gasp!! I will make this for many years to come.  Great recipe! Update 2013: I have been making this every year since I wrote this review and my husband now expects it at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I make a small one for just the two of us and it it so easy and soooo delicious. Great leftover too.

SOOO good you can eat it for dessert! I love sweet potatoes prepared any way, but this one is really great for special occasions. Give it a try! It's also good if you add some flaked coconut (if you like coconut, of course).

This dish made me the hit at my family reunion. The in-laws gobbled it up. My little kids finally ate their veggies -- all be it the dish is more like a dessert. But I don't care. It beats the marshmellow sweet potato casserole by a long shot. This super-simple recipe is rich, creamy, crunchy and hard to keep on the table. My guests devoured it, asked for the recipe and wondered when I finally learned to cook. I've never been so proud.

This was excellent and liked by all at Thankgiving. Just don't discuss calories at the table! I recommend using true sweet potatoes vs. yams with this recipe. Yams are usually more "stringy" and I believe the consistency and taste of the finished product is better with sweet potatoes.

I just made this for Thanksgiving...it's a definite keeper.  My family went crazy over this one.  It was so delicious with it's sweet nutty texture and flavor, that I was able to convert 4 out of 5 confirmed sweet potato haters into fans!  Now I've been asked to make this for every family gathering!  The only problem I had was that after baking the sweet potatoes in the oven for 45 minutes, they were still to hard to get through a ricer, I ended up heating them in the microwave for about 10 more minutes...then they were fine.  I also adjusted the serving size to 12 and was able to serve 17 with this recipe.  I'm craving this again already!

I read some of the other reviews and did not add as much sugar as the recipe called for and I was a little disappointed with how it came out. It came out okay but think the next time I make it I will follow the recipe.

I've never been much of a sweet potato person but strangely I was craving them so badly, so I searched out a recipe here.  Hubby was out of town (he doesnt like them) so I thought what a great opportunity.  First off I do not recommend baking the potatoes in the oven.  After 40 minutes in the oven they were still too hard to be put through a ricer, so I popped them into the microwave for about six minutes.  I think I made the topping wrong because it didnt turn out crumbly or anything, just a melted sugar mess.  Still tasted good though!  I think I would've enjoyed this dish more if I had a slice of turkey, some stuffing and cranberry sauce to go with it.  Next time I will definatly make as a side dish to something, not just to pig out on...  Funny how when hubby goes out of town it is so easy to eat badly....

***UPDATE  I make this every year but have always used yams, this time I splurged and bought actual sweet potatoes instead - what an absolutely yummy difference, I'll never use yams again!!!***  In a word - YUM!!!  Sweet and tasty through and through and I don't even normally eat sweet potatoes.  I had a bit too much wine and dumped every pecan in the house into my pecan pie, had none left for the topping and it was STILL good.  After it was done cooking I topped with mini-marshmallows (for the traditionalists in the family) and tossed it back into the oven for 12 minutes...everyone kept going back for seconds, thirds, etc...was even good heated up the next day in the microwave!  A keeper - thanks Heather!!!

This was a very easy recipe and looked very good.  I can't vouch for how it tasted, due to the fact I do not like sweet potatoes, but the rest of my family does, so they were the guinee pigs : )  And it was gobbled up at Christmas dinner.  So thank you for giving me a recipe that I can make blind not knowing if it tastes good to me.  I will make this on holiday's from now on.

Loved this recipe, so did my family.  Similar to pumpkin - very tasty.  My 4 year old missed having the marshmallows on top so I ended adding at the end - worked out really well!!  Will make again - keeper.

Excellent recipe!  My mom ate the "leftovers" off of my childrens' plates, then asked if she could take the rest home with her (I think she liked the sweet potatoes better than the Christmas gifts!)

Very nice :). I didnt have the heavy cream so i used egg nog! and i dint have pecans so i used crushed almonds (although im sure the pecans would have been a LOT better) but the almonds still tasted good and I got raves about the recipe. It was great! I'm sure my 8 y/o would have loved this as well!

I was dissappointed in this recipe.  I wont make it again.  It was sort of dry, all the syrup cooked away and we like sweet potatoes caramalized in sweet syrup.  Too much effort also.

My family loves this so much it has replaced the bland baked sweet potatoes that I used to serve at Thanksgiving.  It is sweet but I like sweet and if you don't you can adjust the recipe accordingly.

I was kind of sceptical trying this recipe out because we always had marshmellows on our sweet potatoes.  Well, I tried it anyway and made it for Thanksgiving dinner with the family and made it and took it to our church potluck.....it was a hit!  Everyone loved it....this recipe will be a permanent dish on our holiday table!

Served this on Thanksgiving. Not only did it disappear but all of the cooks at the table asked for the recipe. I liked it with half the sugar and a bit more salt. The pecan flavor came through more when it didn't have to compete with the sugar.

I wanted something different than the usual sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner at a potluck we were attending and I found this gourmet recipe.  I thought at first, I cannot cook something gourmet, but after reading the ingredients and directions, I was sold.  It was a hit at our potluck and I will never go back to normal sweet potatoes.  It also makes up as a wonderful dessert.  I will continue to sing praises for this delicious dish!

Based on comments of others, I tried added a little more than half the suggested sugar and it turned out great.  I used an 8x8 pan since I must not have started with enough potato.  It turned out great, I'm planning to take to this to a office potluck dinner soon.  Great!

What a great recipe!  My whole family enjoyed it and it will be a tradition in our home. To accomodate diet needs of some family members, I cut back on the sugar a little and it still tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish was the hit of my Thankgiving office party.  Many asked for the recipe.  I cooked and baked the sweet potatoes the night before --then added the topping before reheating in a large toaster oven at work.  I would use much less brown sugar in the topping next time.  A must try...

This recipe tastes very good, a bit sweet but good.  Next time I make the recipe I will cut back on the butter in the topping.  It was swimming in butter when I took it out of the oven.  I also cut back the sugar a bit.  I alo used canned sweet potatoes and it turned out fine.  A good recipe, but not my all time favorite.

I tried this recipe as part of a special meal I was making and it was a big hit. The only thing was maybe it's too sweet (tastes more like dessert than a side). I didn't have pecans on hand so I used walnuts and they worked fine. Would definitely try this again.

Very VERY sweet. Next time will reduce the sugar. Was delicious, and a nice break from all the savoury dishes in our thanksgiving dinner... but was so sweet in comparison it was likened to pie filling. Next time, definitely less sugar.

Fantastic recipe! I make it every year for Thanksgiving. I just reduce the amount of sugar in the sweet potatoes themselves since they’re sweet already. Other than that, I usually double the recipe bc it goes so fast! Mmmm!

I made this for Christmas dinner and I'm now required to bring this to all family functions. I only bent this twice, I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond extract and I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's all I had. Will be making it again!!!!!

I made this recipe last year and it was a huge hit for Thanksgiving! I got lots of compliments that it was better than a busy local restaurant's sweet potato casserole. I lost this recipe and decided to look it up so I could make it again this year. You won't even miss the marshmallow topping!

I will make it again, but will adjust as it was too sweet. I will have no sugar in the yams and only 1/2 the sugar in the topping. This said, I loved it and will for sure make it again.

Love this recipe. Had a casserole similar to this before and loved it. This recipe comes very close. I add shredded pineapple to the casserole for and added sweet kick of flavor. Try it you'll be amazed!

Excellent! It's like a dessert, not a vegetable dish. I like less sugar, so I only added ¼ cup of white sugar to the potato mixture.

Yeah, family loved it. I had no idea what 5 sweet potatoes would be, volume wise, and the ones we had available were jumbo size. So I bought 4, which pretty much filled a 9" x 13". I'm guessing this was about 1.5 X the recipe amount. Like others, I cut both sugars in half, and it seemed just right to us. Took a lot longer to cook, 75 minutes by my calcs. Will do this again.

Made it for 80 people at the local homeless soup kitchen. Everyone loved it even the cooks. Used sliced almonds instead of pecans.

I made it just as it's written and it was awesome..BUT...warning, do not MELT the butter for the topping - I did and it was just a goopy mess, not crumbly so I just put clobs of it on top and actually even THAT still tasted good but didn't look appealing so I covered it up, a bit, with a few marshmallows - really good but next time  I won't melt the butter.

A hit at Thanksgiving and have been asked to make it a new tradition.  I doubled the topping but found it wasn't necessary because it was too much.  My husband asked why do we have to wait for holidays to have this.  He loved it!

I've been making these potatoes for years, and they never fail. These are by far the best sweet potatoes I've ever had. I hate marshmallow topping, and the pecans are the perfect topping for these potatoes. Every year I can tell how much people like it by the empty serving dish. I've started making these the night before. I put the topping on it the next day and bake, and they are perfect!

Fantastic recipe.  I took this to a dinner party and several people told me that these were the best sweet potatoes they've ever had.  I prepared as indicated with very minor changes: 1) since sweet potatoes vary in sweetness, I prepared the sweet potatoes mix without the sugar first, then adjusted for sweetness; 2) I added a tiny bit of allspice - it really enhanced the flavor; and 3) I added a little more vanilla, but that is just my preference. Thank you for sharing the recipe. This one has been saved to my favorites.

Made for Thanksgiving  A great hit. No leftovers. Took other reviewers advice and left out the ½ cup sugar. Added maybe a teaspoon (didn't measure) of brown sugar to sweet potatoes just because the brown sugar was sitting out on the counter. Added nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Used soy milk instead of heavy cream also jumbo eggs. Peeled and cut sweet potatoes (3 lbs.) and steamed them. They took less than 15 minutes to cook. Topping is terrific! Assembled everything the night before, refrigerated, and put in the oven on Thursday. Super easy. Super good.

I was worried on Thanksgiving because the potatoes took 5 times longer to cook and microwave to soften then planned...but once I finished the dish my family RAVED about them. They demanded them to be our traditional type now! (like everyone else)

Good but a little too sweet.  I will probably make it again but will cut back on the sugar and will cook and skin the potatoes earlier as that was rather time consuming.

Holy balls....this stuff was sooooooo good.  We are a sweet potato loving family and every year we seem to be on the search for a recipe for sweet potato casserole that is worthy of our holiday meal spread.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have officially found a winner.  I followed the recipe exactly except I threw in a good couple of shakes of cinnamon for the topping because I wasn't paying attention and thought that's what the recipe said.  I used a 2 qt casserole dish and they were absolutely amazing.

Not that this dish needs another glowing review...but I feel compelled nevertheless! Wonderful dish! It's more like sweet potato pie - so rich and awesome! I do also reduce the sugar (to taste) in both the filling and topping - to 1/3 c and 2/3 c respectively. But that's the only change I make and it comes out incredible every time. It was a real winner again this Thanksgiving. Oh, and I do nuke the sweet potatoes for 10 min and then finish baking them in a 425 oven for 45 minutes. They cool for 20 min and it's super easy to take them out of their skins. I think a baked potato really enhances the flavor.

This is my go-to sweet potato casserole recipe - because it's so luxurious and decadent. This is a staple for holidays, with either the nut topping or marshmallows (for those who insist). I usually don't add sugar, since roasting the potatoes gives it more than enough sweetness, especially if you roast them extra long (like 75+ minutes for large), and the topping is crazy sweet. Make sure your butter can fully incorporate into the mashed potatoes and, at the same time, the potatoes aren't so hot they cook the eggs. Both mistakes I've made. There are never leftovers of this dish.

Just Delicious! I only used 2 tablespoons of the white sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  My family raved about this dish.

This casserole is a huge hit at our holiday table. I did not make it one year and you would have thought I committed a crime. I too cut back on the sugar by about a 1/3 and it is still plenty sweet. I also use yams instead of sweet potatoes, but love it either way. A big family favorite!

This was very good, but it was also very sweet. The only real problem I had with it was that it was kind of runny. However, that problem would not keep me from making it again.

This recipe is freakin amazeballs!!!! I made it on thanksgiving and got my girlfriend and a good friend of ours (both hate yams with marshmallows)to eat this! I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup cause we're all not big on too sweet and it was great. I really will never make the marshmallow kind again. FYI I love the marshmallow kind and even I would rather eat this recipe.

Got lots of compliments on this yesterday at our Christmas lunch! I think I used 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1/2, just because I'm trying to reduce the sugar I eat. I think it would've been fine with the full amount though. Very yummy! :)

This recipe is excellent. The dish was a great hit with family and friends. I have now been the designated sweet potatoes casserole cook for all holiday dinners. Since it is very easy to make, I don't mind at all.

Turned out amazing. I dint know what size sweet potatoes were needed so got the biggest and had to add everything else slightly more. added some nutmeg too. I didn't have pecans, so I used cashews and they were sublime.

FABULOUS! This had become a Thanksgiving tradition in my house. =)
My dad really loves the marshmallow-topped kind, so I always leave out the pecans and replace them with marshmallows on top. 
I bake this for 30 minutes like the recipe says, but then I turn on the broiler and toast the marshmallows a little more. The added crunch creates extra awesomeness!

Made this for Thanksgiving after years of looking for a sweet potato dish my family would like.  I will look no further; this dish is a clear winner!  The pecans add just the right crunch to the smooth sweet potatoes.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar like other reviewers suggested, which gave it the perfect sweetness for us!

My father-in-law LOVED this!  The rest of us are opposed to sweet potatoes, but I think this is a recipe we could use to try to aquire a taste.  I had a little taste and it was nice and sweet.  Once you learn to like them, I would also cut back on the sugar.

My husband bought sweet potatoes instead of yams (my fault - he bought what I told him to)!  I made this with the sweet potatoes, and it was fabulous!  My family went crazy for these.  It tasted almost like a sweet potato pie, with a crumble on top.  It is really sweet, but it is soooo good.

This was so good and it will now be on the table at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It was also so easy to make that I had my 16 year old son make it.  He made it as is and did not minus the sugar. We thought it was great and not to sweet.  Not sure if that was because He did not go through boiling and peeling the potatoes because i found boiled and peeled sweet potatoes in a can and he  used that.  Sorry if that offends you true chefs that must do everything from scratch. Lol

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and people loved it. I used half the amount of sugar asked for in the sweet potato itself, and used 2/3 of the brown sugar for the topping. People loved it. I'm saving this recipe for next year. Thank you for sharing (sorry I forgot to take a photo).

First, let me say that the picture does not do this recipe justice. I made it for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a big hit! I mistakenly used my pecans on another recipe, so i had to use walnuts instead. It was still excellent! This recipe is a keeper!

This was SO DELICIOUS! I normally don't like sweet potatoes, but went back for seconds for this. I brought it to a Thanksgiving gathering and received several compliments. Two of the people who complimented mentioned that it was the best sweet potato dish they had ever tasted.

I made this with a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes (for the sake of time), but otherwise followed the recipe precisely.  It was fabulous and extremely easy.  I may also add coconut to the topping next time.

This is hands down the best sweet potato recipe I've used or tasted. Have never really been a fan of sweet potatoes, but this recipe has turned me into a fan. Made it for the family on thanksgiving and they got seconds of this over seconds of the mashed potatoes and stuffing!! When does that ever happen? Definately will be the sweet potatoes on our table for every holiday!

I made this and only substitued milk for the heavy cream.  Very delicious.  I definitely prefer this over marshmallow-topped sweet potatos.

Have been making this for years, taken from this website. Everyone loves it and always asks to have it made. I also cut the white sugar back to 1/3 c. and brown sugar to 2/3 c. and reduce the butter by a TBL or so. I do add a pinch of nutmeg. My mother sometimes makes it with canned sweet potatoes and it's still very good. She often will leave the pecans out of the topping also!

This recipe is pretty much an exact duplicate of one I have been using for years out of a church cookbook. I add my own spin to it by adding spices you would use in a pumpkin pie (ginger, cloves, nutmeg). For a really special twist I also add the zest of an orange and use the fresh orange juice in place of the cream (or a tsp of orange flavoring in addition to the cream). Super YUMMY!!!

This was okay, but not as good as I was expecting. The sweet potato mixture was a little bland. The pecan topping was delicious, however, I will keep searching for a sweet potato casserole recipe.

The topping is very good, much better than marshmellows.  It made a lot (I have a family of 5)  Enough for 2 dinners and there was still at least 1 helping left.  It was very rich so you cant eat a lot of it.  Maybe cut recipe in half? I peeled and then boiled potatoes instead of baking (I doubt it makes much of a difference).

I used 2 cans of sweet potato. I followed the rest exactly. I found it to be a little loose. Not sure if the canned sweet potato caused this but next time i will add more eggs. The topping is fabulous!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago when we were having company for dinner.  My family has never cared for sweet potatoes except for sweet potato pie.  However, we LOVE this recipe!  It is now an annual favorite on our Thanksgiving table whether we have company or not!

I made this for the buffet at the lodge that I work at last weekend. I tripled the recipe and followed it fairly exactly. Our guests loved it, even ones that swore they were not sweet potato fans. Very easy, it was prepped in the morning and took 1 hour in the oven for the topping to carmelize. Just wonderful. I may cut back on some topping next time because tripling the recipe may have made a bit much.....not that anyone complained!

Sweet potato casserole that is not quite as sweet as some others.  A little more of the sweet potato taste rather than sugar comes through.  The topping is delicious on these and makes up for less sweetness in the sweet potatoes.  Very good casserole.

Very good recipe, but instead of baking the sweet potatoes to soften, I peeled and boiled them for 25 minutes and then mixed with other ingredients as detailed for an easier way to prepare.

Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had 1/2 sweet potato left over from making sweet potato pie, so I divided this recipe by 8 (yes, I have really tiny measuring cups and spoons made by Progressive International 19-Piece Measuring Cup and Spoon Set]).  The dividing was crazy, but the recipe was delicious!  We enjoyed it as a side dish for a few nights.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for the Easter dinner with the family, and is was a big hit.  Was told I do the sweet potatos from now on, and they want this recipe.  It was agreed to by most though that the  sugar needs to be cut back, but no complaints.  And I have a large family.

It would be hard to mess this one up. I shopped on Friday night for Easter and the store was already out of sweet potatoes and heavy cream, so I had to use canned potatoes and evaporated milk. I had to sort of guess-timate what 5 potatoes would be equal to and I also wanted to make extra, so I did 4 large cans and changed the serving size to 12 to increase the other ingredients. It was absolutely delicious - could almost count as a dessert!

Excellent. This was my second time making this dish for a holiday and its wonderful. I cut back on the sugar like most suggested to 1/3 c. My mom always made the sweet potatoes from the can with butter and brown sugar, etc. This is so much better and she asks me to bring this to holiday dinnners, now. Thanks for a great recipe!

Even non sweet potato eaters enjoyed this!  I did not use as much sugar as listed and it was sweet enough.  I did most of it ahead and then finished it on the day of the meal and it worked very well.

Extremely tasty. The topping is outstanding. I would recommend going easy on the white sugar in the sweet potatoes because the potatoes are sweet enough.

This is definitely the best sweet potato recipe that I've come across. Its much better than my mom's recipe with apples and marshmallows. I love that recipe, but this one kicks it up a notch.

I made this exactly as printed for Christmas dinner and, sadly, it was gone so quickly that I had none. I made it again this weekend - FABULOUS!!! It's no wonder they were devoured so quickly. Thank you.

Okay, I tried the recipe and did not change a thing, my hubby loves the version of this dish that they serve at a restaruant and I couldnt get the taste just right especially the topping so i saw this recipe and had my 14 year old to make it, and we served it to her dad on his lunch break and he thought this was the best! and was even better than the restaruants...my 8 year old who does not even like sweet potatoes enjoyed it..we have added this to the keep forever pile, i am on my way to my moms to let her taste it to see if it meets her standards...I am sure she will love it.  We boiled the sweet potatoes and then peeled them and they came out fine.  This is definetely a keeper

Excellent.  BUT if you are a marshmallow topped lover, this will leave you feeling unsatisfied.  ;-)

AMAZING!  I made this recipe for Christmas eve dinner. It was a huge success. I am known for my sweet potatoes & usually have a little left over. After reading the review I doubled the recipe, I still did not have any left overs.

Just cooked this for christmas dinner.  Usually people are fighting over my pancetta pan roasted potatoes and turkey, but today everyone was gong back for more of these sweet potatoes.  Only difference was that I used a cinnamon spiced pecans for the topping, which added a nice spicy complement to the sweetness of the dish.

Delicious.  Made exactly per the recipe, except used canned sweet potatos.  Husband who doesn't like sweet potatos had two helpings.  1 year old loved (w/out topping).

EXCELLENT!!  I made this for Thanksgiving this year and like others have said, even sweet potato haters ate it up.  They even went for seconds!  It's a more mature and tasty recipe than the marshmallow variety that is guaranteed to impress.  Between this and "Grandma's Green Bean Casserole" from this site, Thanksgiving was declared The Best Ever.  I made it as written, no substitutions or alterations needed.

I give this 4 1/2 stars.  It tasted great, but cooking the sweet potatoes was a HUGE pain in the butt.  At first I followed the directions and just baked them on the pan for 35 minutes and they were no where near done.  So I cut them up hoping that would help them cook faster, and I had to cook them for 30 more minutes and they still weren't quite done.  I was running late, so I ended up mashing them the best I could, but there were still some firm pieces in the casserole.

I've used a very similar recipe as a guide for the last 15 years but somehow lost it. This one is so similar that I used it as a guide this Thanksgiving. I didn't measure accurately (more to taste). It is a hit each and every time!

I made this two days ahead of time and refrigerated the topping separately.  Everyone asked me for the recipe and everyone wanted to take some home.  I didn't have any leftovers for my family!  Wonderful, excellent recipe!

Try cooking this in a crockpot! Mine has a removable insert so I just assembled a day ahead, put everything in the insert and refrigerated overnight.  The next day I popped it in the cooking well, turned it on and forgot about it until time to eat.  I did mine on HI for 2 hours but you could also do LO for 4.  I also add 1/4 cup of orange juice to the sweet potato mixture.  You don't taste it but it does a wonderful job brightening and rounding out the flavors.  I think refrigerating overnight also allow the flavors to blend better.  And hey...if you're putting it together the day before why not take the time to bake the potatoes?  You won't get that carmelization any other way.  I just pierce the potatoes and put them into one of those big throwaway aluminum roasting pans on 450 for 1 hour.  No need to wrap in aluminum and no worries about those nasty black stalactites (or stalagmites - forgot which one goes UP) in the bottom of your oven.  :)

This was wonderful and I was sad there were no leftovers. I used two large cans of yams (saved sooo much time). I skipped the topping b/c my husband hates nuts. Did a light sprinkling of marshmallows on one side of it for the kids.

This was a great side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I made this ahead of time and put it in the oven right before dinner.  I had foil over the top which should have come off when it went in the oven which made the topping a little soggy.  This dish has great flavor!

This was the best!! Everyone loved it! I cut the recipe in half (small family) and baked in a 2qt-or was it 3qt casserole dish. The topping was great. I used 2 large yams and 2 large sweet potatoes. This is a keeper!

I just love mashed sweet potatoes for T-Day and this was perfect.  I used local sweet potatoes and some extra spices (all spice, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg).  I also exchanged the white sugar with brown and cut back on the additional brown sugar for the topping (using regular brown, not light).   Wasn't quite sure about the directions in #4 - I just threw 4 ingredients in my Cuisinart until fine.

This was fabulous! One of my favorite sweet potato dishes--by far! It has the lightest cinnamon flavor but it makes all the difference. It's definately worth five stars.

Delicious...great recipe!!  I did cut down sugar to 1/4 cup after reading the reviews.  It was perfect.  I made it the night before Thanksgiving, refrigerated it,  and finished it 30 minutes before dinner.

I used less sugar than the recipe called for, about 1/4 c -- I might even leave it out completely next time. I also roasted the sweet potatoes for any hour at 450F to give them extra sweetness and a roasty flavor. Superb!

Excellent alternative to the standard sweet potatoes and marshmallow recipe! I fixed the Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! In my opinion, it could almost be served as a dessert--it was very sweet; in fact, the next time I fix this, I may reduce the amount of sugar I use. Will definitely fix this again!!

I love this recipe. I have been using it for about three years now and it's always the favorite side dish! I have used both canned and fresh sweet potatoes. With the fresh ones, I microwave them until soft, let them cool for a few minutes, slice them in half and them scoop them out with a spoon. Almost like an avacado. I have also used skim milk and olive oil based butter. The topping is way better than marshmallows! I will be making this for years to come!

I tried this for the first time this year and the only thing I would change for next time is to make more. My family and friends loved it. I brought some to work the next day and everyone loved it. This will definitely be on my menu for Christmas.

OH MY GOSH this was just DELICIOUS. I absolutely LOVE sweet potatoes, I can eat them plain baked with no toppings. However, I have some sweet potato haters in the family as well. I made these for THanksgiving yesterday, the first time straying from the marshmallow topping tradition, and everyone JUST FREAKED. It was most people's favorite dish, the first thing we ran out of, and everyone asked me how I did it. The texture is so fluffy, the sweetness is perfect, the crunchiness of the brown sugar and pecans just made the dish. The key is using the fresh potatoes and not buying the garbage from a can. It is literally heaven in a casserole dish!

This recipe is a winner!  I try a different sweet potato recipe every year and I don't feel the need to ever try another.  I peeled the potatoes and cut them into chunks then boiled rather than baking them, and somehow I ended up with only 4 sweet potatoes but I used the full amount of all the ingredients.  I left out the pecans and made this the night before, then baked it before serving.  My fiance loved it too and didn't even add marshmallows to his.  Great!

Incredible - my family made this for Thanksgiving and made me put the recipe into our annual menu.  Sweet potatoes from a can work great.  I would include 1/4 tsp of salt in the topping.

This is the recipe my grandmother has made for more than 25 years that i know of.We double everything except eggs and use around three cups or tad bit more of mashed sweet potatoes.We use 1/2 cup milk instead of cream and boil the potatoes and drain like regular mashed potatoes.We don't put salt and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg in with the 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp cinnamon.And only 1 cup light brown sugar for the topping part(keep in mind we double this recipe) everything else is the same.I don't really even care for sweet potatoes but this right here is one of the best dishes on the table at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This is a great recipe!  I halved the recipe to test it out before cooking it for Thanksgiving.  I forgot to add the eggs and heavy cream and it still turned out great.  It will be even better on Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe around 10 times now.  It is gaining quite the reputation around the circuit if holiday get togethers.

I adore this recipe! As a sweet potato fan in a home of those who loathe it - I was reluctant to try this recipe - but, it's OH SO GOOD! The taste/flavor is more like a sweet potato pie, but adding the eggs seems to soften the potato texture so white potato fans don't feel like they are eating the "other potato". I made this list year for Thanksgiving along with regular ole mashed and this year - this will be my only tato on the table.... thank you so much!

This will become a regular occurance at our family suppers.  Delicious.  I had a hard time peeling and mashing the sweet potatoes after only 35  min in the over.  I found they weren't cooked nearly enough.  I would put them in for much longer next time, or even peal and boil them.

I made half the recipe using 3 boiled sweet potatoes, but made the full amount of topping. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The topping was great! I wish the sweet potato mixture was creamier. Will add more cream/butter next time, but very yummy recipe!

Do you need to wake up?  Try this and it will do the trick.  I also used canned yams but it turned out excellent and I didnt use any white sugar because the topping was PLENTY.  I actually doubled the topping because I wanted a full covering.

Oh my gosh this recipe is awesome. I made these for our grilled chicken kabobs and my husband raved about them. Fixed them exactly how the recipe calls for but the potatoes had to cook for about 1 hour before they were good and soft. Will for sure make these again soon. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Amazing.  I topped with marshmallows as well.  Otherwise, I made as per the recipe.  I made for a large group, and everyone loved it.

I made this for the second time yesterday and everyone loved it. I get asked for the recipe everytime I make it. I use milk instead of cream and I don't think you can tell the difference with such a small amount. I don't put any marshmallows on top and it is so good!! The amount of potatoes I used was just under five pounds and it served 12 people with about 1/2 cup leftover.

This is very similar to the sweet potato pudding (the word casserole is an immediate turn off in my family) that I have to make at every family holiday meal.  If you increase the butter/margarine, you can eliminate the milk/cream.  I have used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 honey with good results.  I put it in a cake pan for thinner pudding and more topping.  One year when I didn't make this, I was in deep trouble--never skipped again.  This is made the night before the big holiday meal (usually with the cooks drinking wine)and is very forgiving if the measurements aren't exact.

The end product was a five, although next time I would cut back on the sugar just a bit.  However, the size of the potatoes wasn't specific and when I baked them for 40-minutes (medium sized sweet potatoes), they were hard as rocks...no way they would mash! I baked them an additional 20-minutes and still not done.  Finally I cut them up and boiled them in a pot for about 20-minutes, which did the trick. To avoid the stringiness that comes with sweet potatoes, I used a potato ricer instead of the masher.  It worked wonders!

I decreased the sugar and brown sugar by at 1/3 (to my own taste) and it came out perfect. I'll definately be making this again.

Accidentally used brown sugar in the sweet potato, rather than white - very sweet and delicious. The topping is definitely a keeper - next time I think I'll leave the sugar out of the sweet potato completely - it really doesn't need it. The consistency is very good.

This was okay but, based on all the glowing reviews, I expected better than "okay."  I did cut the sugar but maybe I shouldn't have.  It just didn't really have any "wow."  Further, it was BARELY eaten at Thanksgiving dinner.  Of course, it was hardly the only dish on the table so i'm not sure that that was any indication.  The topping was good but I kinda missed the  gooey marshmallows of my other recipe.  SO, thats why only 4 stars.

This was a very good standard recipe.  The topping was awesome but the potatoes themselves lacked flavor.  If I were to make this again, I would add more spices to give it some oomph.

I had none of sweet potatoes left after Thanksgiving meal. Yams took much longer to bake, but after they were done, dish came together very quickly. I added a little bit of lemon juice and olive oil when baking, then raisins after mashing sweet potatoes. Fabulous!

Haven't reviewed a recipe in a while and I have to say, this one was worth coming out of hiding for! I made a FULL Thanksgiving dinner and needed all the help I could get. I saw the Gourmet in the title and was hooked ;) Anyway my husband's family doesn't really eat sweet potatoes, which is why I wanted to try a casserole dish. Everyone went right for the 'familiar' dishes and was afraid to even try it. I said, listen up! You dont have to like it but you do have to TRY it...so they did.
Holy heck those spuds disappeared so fast. Then I was informed that I will HAVE to make this again...well, every Thanksgiving.
Thanks for the recipe!! 
by the way...I used all brown sugar, no white, and just under what the recipe called for. I was going to do half mini marshmallows on top like another reviewer did, but forgot all about them. I'm going to try them next time.
I was also wary about the egg part, but it definately worked in the dish!
Try this recipe!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner this year.  Sine we didnt have too many people and had another potato dish, I altered the recipe down to 4 servings.  I cut the sugar by about half based on others sugestions.

This was very good, and highly enjoyed by my guests. I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but even I enjoyed this. I enjoyed that the topping wasn't marshmallows, it was good and crunchy.

Delish! To me it's easier to peel, boil & mash. I followed the rest of the recipe. Used my homemade pumpkin pie spice. Only had whole milk. Really good, thanks!

SO. GOOD. The streusel on top is to die for. I mixed yams with sweet potatoes to balance the sweetness and make the color more interesting. I also added slightly less than the called-for sugar. My family likes them a little more chunky so I mashed them just a little bit so they were like mashed potatoes with big chunks. A big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

Delicious!  I was scared of mashed sweet potatoes, but these turned out great!  I used brown sugar instead of white in the potatoes and I accidently added too much, but ti still tasted terrific.

The potatoes were NOT soft enough after 35 minutes, so they were impossible to mash. They needed another 20 minutes, but, then the mixture was too dry and bitter because the sugar had clumped to the bottom. Luckily after adding water, cream and sugar before applying the topping and baking it for the main 45 minutes, the finished product was tasty. I just wish I didn't have to spend so much time editing the figures.

Made this for Thanksgiving potluck. It was quite literally fantastic! None made it into leftovers, of which there were many others. It tasted like beautiful candy which complemented cranberry sauce with the turkey. It was a delightful combination. 
I had less sweet potato than should be used so the sweetness was intensified, but utterly delightful. The taste fluctuated between the pecan, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla while being solidified by the heavier ingredients. The sweet potato accented the entire dish. I used locally grown, organic sweet potato so they were smaller than most of those in the store.

This recipe was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner tonight!   The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the potatoes needed a little more milk to make them creamier, a bit less sugar in the potato mixture but more topping to cover the casserole.  I made a double batch with triple topping which was just the right amount of topping for two casserole dishes.  I will be definitely making again.  Might even try adding apples in the the potatoes next time!  My mom said it tasted like Ruth's Chris sweet potatoes :)

I have been making this for a few years now and it's always a huge hit.  I love love love this recipe.  I do wish though that the author would change from '# of sweet potatoes' to cups of mashed sweet potatoes, at least approx.  This year I wanted to do oh, 1 + 1/2 recipe, but using only 8 sweet potatoes gave me a 12 cup yield!  The more that you try to make, the more skewed it becomes on the proportions of other ingredients due to so many sizes of s.p.'s. I just hope it has the correct consistency this time :)  I will, however, continue to make this year after year (I too lower the sugar) because it is DELICIOUS!

I just made this to bring for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner. I am kind of panicking because all I taste is the topping. I couldn't taste the bottom layer at all. Of course everyone will say they like it; it tastes just like candy! Making this from scratch, (aka not canned yams) I really hoped for a winner. I will update my review/stars after tomorrow.UPDATED: This really turned out great. Everyone loved it!

Really good.  PLease go the extra step and use fresh potatoes instead of canned ones.  I microwaved mine which only took a few minutes.  The only thing I changed was that I used an 8X8 pan instead of the 9X13 recommended one  I didn't nearly have enough casserole to fill a pan that size. If making for a lot of people, you'll want to double the recipe.

I haven't actually tried this recipe yet though I'm very excited to because of the rave reviews it has received. But as a side note I'd like to point out that yams and sweet potatoes are not actually the same thing and though they look similar they are completely different plants. However if you go into most stores in the U.S. they don't know how to make this distinction.

This is really good!  My hubby, who detests sweet potatoes/yams, the canned variety wanted to know when I'm making this again!  I did go just slightly less on the sweetener, which seemed to have been a good call.  I must say, it took nearly an hour to bake the potatos in the oven, but I would still use that cooking method in the future.  Baking really brings out a nice flavor and texture that I don't think would be there microwaving them.  I do believe this is a new family favorite to serve with holiday ham!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous.  If you are worried about the sweetness just scale back the white and/or brown sugar a little bit.

This was AWESOME, my husband hates sweet potatoes but he loved this! To make it easier, I just used two large cans of yams (drained). Also, I forgot the eggs, so I was a little worried but it still turned out to be a big hit!

This was good. It tastes like sweet potato pie without the crust. A little more trouble than I wanted, especially since I already made a sweet potato pie.

I don't know what it is about this recipe...It's sooo good.  My husband and I, like a lot of other people here, never really cared for sweet potatoes.  I made this for Thanksgiving a couple of times over the last couple of years and everyone just loves it.  After this past Thanksgiving, I have 3 more sweet potatoe converts.  Everyone asks for the recipe!  It's awesome, and so easy.  Thanks!

This turned out so good!  The only thing that went wrong was the topping, my butter was too soft, but that was my fault.  One person even said that it was the best sweet potato casserole he'd ever had!

I followed this recipe to a "T" when making it for Thanskgiving 2007.  I was concerned about the sweetness, as many reviewers stated this concern.  I decided that for the first time, I would just try it as the recipe called.  This dish was AMAZING as is.  This was my donation to a potluck dinner, and didn't come home with any.  This was the biggest hit at the table!  I would highly recommend this recipe, as is.  No changes needed.  10 people at our table thought so!  This is one I will keep for the coming holiday seasons.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  AWESOME!

Fantastic recipe! I used white granulated splenda and brown sugar splenda and it was still totally awesome. Will be making all the time. Thanks!

Best Ever - Throw those little marshmallows away. You'll never put them on top of sweet potatoes again after tasting this

This was such a great addition to our Thanksgiving meal. However, be careful about the size of your pan. I cooked this in a 9x13 and didn't have enough of the brown sugar crumble to cover the entire pan. It would have been better in a square pan.

My family flipped out when I made this for my first thanksgiving. Everyone raved that it was good enough to be desert. I am asked to make it every year with enthusiasm. They even ask me to make it throughout the year it is so yummy. This was one of the first recipes to be put in  the family favorite recipe book I'm making.

This was delicious!  It wasn't too sweet and was creamy.  I was short on oven space so I steamed the peeled, cut sweet potatoes until soft.  I also divided this between two casserole dishes and doubled the topping amount (I froze one of the dishes for later use).  The only other change I made was to substitute milk for the heavy cream.  Will definitely make this again, especially around the holidays!

This is really easy, and I've never attempted anything like it before making it for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner party. I chose to boil the potatoes and mash them instead of baking them, and they turned out delicious. Out of the 20-odd dishes we had for our potluck, without even knowing who made the dishes, several people around me declared it their favorite dish there. I will definitely make this again.

This was FABULOUS!!  I'll definitely be making it again.  I'm not a big sweet potato fan--especially not for the recipes that have marshmallow in them--so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this one, but it was really yummy and was a huge hit with the whole family!

This recipe is amazing!  It went great with our Easter ham and was a good alternative to the traditional type of recipe that uses marshmallow topping.  I might cut down on the amount of topping next time since it makes it very sweet (more like a dessert), but I will definately make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it is now a new holiday favorite with my husband.  He usually loves mashed sweet potatoes and said the topping was a nice "addition" for the holiday.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were good for something different than the usual sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows.  However, I got more requests for my traditional marshmallow topped 'taters than compliments on this dish.  Tasty, but we'll stick with the old standard in the future.

Sorry, but not a big hit with my family.  I think they missed pineapple mixed in and marshmallows on top.  I like to try new recipes, so I guess I'll just keep looking for something that rings everyone's chimes.

This was so delicious!  I doubled the recipe so it took me about twice as long in the oven both to cook the potatoes and to brown the topping, but it was fine.  I made this for our Thanksgiving feast and it was the talk of the dinner table! Thanks!

This dish was excellent!  I even got my kids to eat it, and people who never eat sweet potatoes were asking me for the recipe!  I did not use all of the topping though..thought it might be too sweet, and I think it would have been.  Was very happy only using half of it.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now and it's always my family's favorite dish of the meal.  I add more cinnamon to the mix and I make about triple the amount of topping (it's the best part).
I can't believe people are complaining about the sweetness! I like it sweeter than the original recipe.

This was very good and very sweet.  I wasn't sure how it would be when I put it in the oven because the mixture looked rather green, but it turned out so yummy!  We'll make it again!

I made this for Thanksgiving as an extra side that was something other than the same old stuff.  There wasn't a morsel left.  Even the kids ate it!  I'll definitely make this again.

This was very good.  I dont know that its hugely different than than other sweet potato casseroles Ive made from various recipes, however, it was the most requested recipe from this Thanksgiving's large gathering so its clearly a crowd pleaser!

Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving.  I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and would do the same again.  Cooking the sweet potatoes in the oven took over an hour at 350...  I used yams which ended up a bit stringy.  I read a review that suggested that sweet potatoes might be less stringy.

This was wonderful!  All the sweet potato recipes I've tried in the past were either too sweet with pockets of blandness or else too mushy.  This had a perfect firm consistancy with the right amount of sweetness and flavor in every bite.  Even my brother in law who doesn't like sweet potatoes, loved this!

My family loved this recipe, the only thing I'd changed is try boiling the sweet potatoes for faster cooking instead of baking them.  It would have also been nice if the recipe suggested buying smaller sized sweet potatoes ;-)

Thank you, Thank you, Heather!  I lost this recipe when I lost my sister.  She brought it every Thanksgiving.  I had a copy, but lost it.  Iv'e tried so many sweet potato casseroles thinking I would eventually find hers.  I was disappointed every time.  This is it!  I can't thank you enough. It's the best...

Incredible! I don't like sweet potatoes, but even I can tell that this is delicious. And sweet potato-lovers go nuts for it. It seems like an excuse to eat sweet potato pie (sans crust) with dinner.  A holiday staple for me!

I made this with a few modifications. I only used one egg, used six sweet potatoes, added a pinch (literally) of nutmeg, filled a 1/2 cup almost full of the white sugar and filled the remainder with brown sugar.  I also doubled the topping.  It was FANTASTIC. I had tons of requests for the recipe.  Even my relatives who love the marshmallow topped dish said this beat it hands down. I will definitely make this a staple in my holiday menu.

We just got back from Thanksgiving dinner with my husband's large family and this one got RAVE reviews even from the non-sweet potato eaters.  Our nephew who said he only likes the marshmallow-topped version of sweet potatoes had three helpings!  He told me he's a convert!

This is the best sweet potato recipe!  This is the 4th year that I've used it (2004) and the extended family calls to make sure I'm bringing it again every year!  It can be made with yams or sweet potatoes - both are very yummy.  Babies all the way up to Great-grandma will love this one!

YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM!  As others have said, this recipe will be loved by those who have hated sweet potatoes in the past, and by those who like the old boring sweet potato casserole.  It is almost a dessert, in the creaminess and decadence of the flavor.  Family members request this dish every holiday now.  The topping is perfect--don't add any icky marshmallows!  They're not needed here!

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have time to get fresh sweet potato, so substituted 2 cans of 29 oz canned yams and increased the ingredients x1 with the exception of the eggs and turned out delicious.  Very good taste.

Delighfully delicious! I must agree that the brown sugar topping adds that special something! I did decrease amount of pecans and it was just enough. Definitely worth trying.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the cream, used one egg instead of two, and cut the white sugar in half. I also melted the butter for the topping to make blending in the flour and brown sugar easier; it still got crispy in the oven. Next time I'll use brown sugar instead of the white and cut out a bit of the butter - it's smooth and tasty enough that it could lose a few calories and still be great!

This is a fabulous sweet potatoe recipe.  I've made it for my family a couple of times now and they just love it!  Even my husband, who doesn't like sweet potatoes, will eat this.  I gave it only four stars b/c there isn't enough of the delicious topping with the recipe as is.  Double the topping and it's definately a 5-star dish!

This dish IS a nice alternative to the marshmallow-topped version.  I lessened the sugar in the topping 1/2 cup and used brown instead of white sugar in the potato mixture.

Yummy! I used the biggest can of "Yams" I could find (what is the difference between yams and sweet potatos?). I brought the yams to a boil (they were precooked and in a sweet glaze) drained the can and proceeded with the recipe. This saved me tons of time and energy. Canned is for sure the way to go! My sister in law said that she loves Boston Market's sweet potatos, but these were much better, she begged for the recipe!

Simply the best sweet poptatos I have ever eaten.  The topping for the dish was THE BEST.  We made these for thanksgiving the night before.  In the morning I made the topping and threw them in the oven. A+ Now I make them with the canned sweet potatoes and can't really tast the difference (saves a ton of time)

Excellent!  After the topping was crisp I added some miniature marshmallows to half of the dish and melted until lightly browned.  Just to satisfy the marshmallow fanatics in the family!  It is very good with the marshmallow addition also.

So good!  I micro cooked the potatoes and used splenda in place of the white sugar to cut a few calories.  This will definitely become part of my fall/winter repertoire.  Thanks Heather.

A delicous recipe! I prepared this for Thanksgiving and added a few twists, I upped the butter quotient, and replaced the sugar in the potatoes with maple syrup. It was roundedly praised by all, and the leftovers were fought over.

Very delicious.  But be aware it's on the sweet side.  Those with a sweet tooth, especially kids, will particularly love this dish.  Either way, it was perfect with turkey and stuffing, since both contain lots of salt.  Fairly easy to preare and the end result looked beautiful on the table.  I will make this again next year.  In the meantime though, I may try turning this dish into a sweet potato pie.

Superb!

For years I made sweet potato casserole without a recipe - NEVER AGAIN!

Being an indulgent sort of individual, I topped the topping with marshmallows and baked them until golden.  If you choose to do this, cut down the sugar in either the potatos or the pecan topping.  It was VERY sweet (but VERY nice!).

This is a keeper and will be on our holiday table for years to come!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner. I doubled the recipe for 8 people. It dissappeared before anyone had finished their first plate. This is a keeper. The only thing I did was to leave the sweetpotatoes chunky. I just like the texture.

Love sweet potatoes so new this would be a hit.  Just sweet enough to pass for dessert too.  Alternative to pumpkin pie.  I make them in individual ramekins and served with creme-fraise.

Rave reviews, all guests fought over the leftovers and wanted the recipe. As others have done, I cut the white sugar slightly. I also added a teaspoon of orange extract and doubled the pecans for the topping. Yum!

This was really delicious!!  It is very sweet, almost like a dessert and was a good contrast to the rest of our Thanksgiving meal.  My husband and two year old daughter loved it as well and both asked for seconds.

I made this a day ahead for Thanksgiving.  Overall the recipe was good.  We felt that it was a bit sweet.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar a bit.  Otherwise, easy, tasty and a crowd pleaser.  The chopped nuts added a nice texture.  Didn't miss the marshmallows a bit....would have added to the sweetness.  Thanks Heather.

I made these for my Thanksgiving dinner as one of my side dishes this year, and my husband has demanded I make them every year!  They were so good, I even accidentally overcooked them and they still tasted fantastic!  The pecans add the best touch.
Thanks Heather!

This dish became an addition to our Thanksgiving 2002 table and we LOVED it.  However, since there are a few weddings in the midst, we substituted the butter for the Smart Balance butter and it was still great.  This will definitely make another appearance next year! Thanks!

Great recipe!  Very good.  I would highly recommend it, I will make it again and again.  I added MORE cinammon, vanilla and along with the white sugar I added brown sugar to the mashed potatoes.  My whole family loved it!

Excellent. My family who turns their noses up at anything orange, loved this!!  The topping is very sweet so I think next time I would omit the white sugar in the potatoes. No need for it.
I am planning to make this again in two weeks for a holiday party.

I prepared this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit, everyone loved it.  I had to promise to email the recipe to several family members, so that they could fix it for their Christmas dinners.  I subsituted Splenda for the white sugar and no one knew till I told them. I also added one extra teaspoon of vanilla, it adds a little extra something to the dish.

we substituted splenda for sugar, then used a little more than 1/2 the amount of suger, added pie spice and ginger (a few shakes each). we halved the brwon suger for the topping, used half more nuts, and 5 tbls weat flour instead of 3 tlbs white flour. it turned out really good!! We modified the recipe b/c of diet restrictions in our family. YUMMY!!!

pretty good stuff! Fixed it for Thanksgiving and was able to finally convert some family members into sweet potato fans. They loved it and thought it should have gone on the dessert table instead of with the veggies. It is very sweet. I used fresh but will also try it with canned,

Not only will I never use marshmallows again I am going to start a petition to ban it in favor of this recipes topping! My whole family absolutely loved this recipe except my husband who only wants to eat familiar things. Of course in a few years this recipe will be familiar to him because I don't plan to make sweet potatoes any other way.

As with so many of the others...

My boyfriend said he would NEVER eat sweet potatoes. He tried these (I guess out of guilt?) and LOVED them!

I have to say, it's the best sweet potatoes recipe I've ever had.
Thank you.

This tastes almost exactly like Damon's Sweet Potato Casserole.  I like to serveit with a little extra butter melted on top (I take the calories out first!).

while it is delicious I find a lot of these types of brown sugar added dishes too sugary so the next time I make this because there will be many times haha, I will be omitting the white sugar and adding only 1/2 cup of unpacked brown sugar to it. did this to a squash casserole and turned out just the right amount of sugary flavour to it.

I will definitely make this again!  I'm putting together a cookbook for our church.  This one is going in!  The only thing I changed was I used melted butter when mixing the topping.  In my opinion, it kept the topping together and caramelized it more than if it was a somewhat-dry topping whose flavor could melt into the sweet potatoes.

I cooked 4 whole large sweet potatoes in the Instant Pot, needing about 20 mins to be cooked and softened.  Spooned out the pulp and added it to the eggs and dry ingredients (I used GF flour for as a friend has an intolerance); turned out great!! Did use less sugar, as recommended.

We had this with our Christmas meal.  I will say that the "prep time" is understated, and that it took longer (twice the time in the oven and finally five minutes in the microwave) to get the Sweet Potatoes soft enough to peel.

I opted to use Monkfruit Sweetener, rather than sugar (both white and brown.)  Worked great!

My husband who does not care for sweet potato casserole, said this was a keeper!

We will definitely have this again!

This was a hit! My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes but always tries them and he actually liked this one so it gets 5 stars from me. I used 3 big sweet potatoes, decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup of brown sugar in the potatoes, and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the topping. It was delicious and not too sweet for a side dish.

This is really delicious, but way too sweet!!
I even cut back the sugars and used coconut sugar and it was still too sweet! More like a dessert.

Excellent tasting dish. Depending on size of the sweet potatoes you use the 35 minutes to soften so they can be peeled may not be enough time. You will be able to peel them but you may need to peel them cut into pieces and boil them so they can be mashed.

7 years making this recipe and running. Only small change, I add 3 tbs of orange juice. Something I picked up from another recipe.

Also, we double up the topping. Always a hit.

I've made this so many times!  This time I'm on a gluten-free, dairy-free diet.  Used almond milk instead of cream, smart balance instead of butter and GF baking mix instead of flour.  The topping wasn't quite the same but it was still awesome and met my dietary needs.

Very very good!  I have made it at least 3 years for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas.  I do cut back on the white sugar to 1/4 cup and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  My family loves it.

The first time I made this it was a huge hit in our house.  I did cut back on both sugars, as recommended in the reviews.  I have made this recipe numerous times since.  It is our holiday go-to casserole.  I have shared this recipe with many who have had mine.  If you haven't tried it yet, you must.  You won't be disappointed.

I have never made sweet potatoes before. This was my first time and it was a hit with my family and guests! I am so happy that I cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup & brown sugar to 2/3 cup just as other’s suggested. Just so you would know (and not be alarmed), my sweet potatoes took much longer than 35 minutes to soften, it took more like 50 minutes to an hour, but that is OK, it was so easy to peel. I followed the recipe to the T! I’m impressed and will be making it time-and-time again!

This is basically a dessert.  It's like a sweet potato crumble.  It's delicious.  It would go great with a dollop of icecream on top.

Nice recipe went well with ham; I did  use 1/2 the amount of sugar, it's a "sweet" potato after all which contains it's own natural sweetness!

This is a winner at every Thanksgiving, especially for those who don't like the super-sweet marshmallow-topped casseroles that abound. I have made very slight alterations to how I prepare this one, based both on reviews I had read and personal preference. 

First for the ingredients (based on the 8-person serving size): I use 6 large yams, only 1 egg for a firmer texture, and just 1/4 cup white sugar. For the topping, I always make at least double the amount (so yummy - this really helps make the dish!!!). 

For the preparations: I peel, cut & boil the yams rather than baking them, as I have non-fire resistant hands and can't handle them for scooping after they've been in the oven! I also like to use a potato ricer to thoroughly break apart the boiled yams, into the mixing bowl. When I use my mixer, I throw away most of the "stringy stuff" that sticks to the beater, rather than scraping it back into the bowl. Though having used the ricer, there usually isn't that much waste. 

Aside from those minor things, this recipe is PERFECT!!! There are never enough leftovers, so sometimes I make an extra one to keep at home!

I followed this recipe to the hilt. It came great. The only thing I will change next time is  baking the sweet potatoes longer. Maybe for 1 hour or 1 hour 15 minutes. I had this for Thanksgiving dinner and will do it again for Christmas dinner.

I've been making this recipe for years and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  The only change I make is no sugar at all in the sweet potato mixture - only use the brown sugar in the topping.  It's sweet enough on its own.

I made this for the first time for a neighborhood Thanksgiving dinner.  I grew up on canned yams and marshmallows on Thanksgiving and switched to a sweet potato casserole as an adult.  I could not find my casserole recipe and found this one.  Great recipe and a hit with dinner attendees.  I especially liked that it was not too sweet and the potato taste was front and center.  Of note, I used 2% milk in place of the heavy cream.

Delicious, simply delicious!  Start with good sweet potatoes and you can't go wrong.  The simplicity of this recipe is part of its excellence.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit! Wonderful flavor. Almost like incorporating dessert into dinner. We couldn't get enough of it. It made a lot, and so we got to enjoy the leftovers the next day! Did use 2 cans of 29 oz sweet potatoes, drained, to make this.

I wanted to try this because of the 5 stars!  I followed the recipe exactly and was shocked at how sweet it was!  The reviews stated that it was too sweet but I like to try it as written the first time I make it.  I unfortunately will never make this again.

I combined this recipe with one with orange juice and marshmallows. I made a smaller version of the topping with less sugar and spread it with some mini-marshmallows. It was delicious!

My husband and I made this one year to bring to our family thanksgiving. It's been our job to make it every year since. We now make two batches because everyone wants the cold leftovers the next day. We typically double the sweet potatoes and triple the crust.
It doesn't matter how you cook the sweet potatoes. We make so much of it that we find it easiest to peal cut and boil them.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I’ve been making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas for several years now and it’s always a winner!  Most people say it’s one of their favorite items on our expansive menu and ask for a copy of the recipe. I always double the amounts for the topping because my husband likes a thicker, crunchy topping. I use fresh sweet potatoes that I peel, cube, and boil before mashing, then mix in the other ingredients as listed.  This is a MUST MAKE recipe!  If you need to bring a dish to a holiday gathering and want to impress the guests, this is the dish to make!

I’ve been making this sweet potato dish for years now. This is the only one I will use. Now, when I first started making it, I read all the reviews and chose to peel and boil the potatoes like white ones. This was the first year I baked them. While they were still good by boiling them, I will never do it again. Baking them was REALLY EASY and honestly less work than pre-peeling. I save the cooked skins and feed them to my dogs as a treat. Win/win!  Not to mention baking it carmelizes the potato and adds sweetness that you don’t get by boiling.  Now, don’t get me wrong, it was still a great dish when I boiled my potatoes, but it’s an AMAZING dish when you bake it!!!

Excellent recipe! I doubled it for a 9x13" pan but only used 3/4 c sugar overall. After baking the sweet potatoes in the oven for an hour I peeled, then mashed them in a bowl with the stated ingredients and used my immersion blender to get a creamy/fluffy consistency. I left the butter for the topping out to soften while the potatoes cooked. Mix your flour and brown sugar well before adding the pecans and keep adding the butter until the mixture is moistened but not oversaturated and then crumble on top by hand.  I received many compliments on this dish and it tastes better than the one my mom has been doing for 30+ years!

I made this according to the recipe and was unimpressed at the appearance when it was done. So I made another batch of the topping and baked it for another 20 minutes and it came out wonderful! I was asked for the recipe by 2 people at Thanksgiving. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made recipe per many of the inputs from others.  Lessoned the sugar amounts, used Stevia instead, used 2% instead of cream, etc.  Turned out great.

Anyone who knows me is well aware that I don't like to cook. For Christmas this year, I was asked to make the sweet potato dish. I found this recipe in my search and read through many of the small notes and tips from other people. I followed the recipe with the exception of a little less white and brown sugar. The dish was a huge hit! I had endless compliments throughout the night about how great it was. It was still very sweet even though I didn't use the all of the sugar required. We could've even used this as a dessert, but the sweet tasted good with all of the other  salty items for dinner. THANK YOU! You made me look stellar!

Hands down everyone’s favorite dish for Christmas dinner! It’s the perfect sweetness.  I read the reviewers and also cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup.  I made the night before and refrigerated until Christmas morning then removed from the fridge and let warm to room temperature before cooking for 40 mins.  Also, my feeling is you have some leeway on the time you cook.  I forgot mine in the oven for 10 extra mins and the topping didn’t get too brown.  It was delicious.

I'd give this an extra star if I could.  I actually made this recipe first for Thanksgiving, but had small lumps in the sweet potatoes so froze this and made another good recipe for Thanksgiving and pulled this out for Christmas.  It not only handled the month of freezing, it far exceeded the other recipe.  And I didn't notice any lumps after all.  Good to know that this recipe can be made well ahead of time for Thanksgiving or any other occasion.  It requires about 12 hours to completely thaw so that I could put it in another fancier casserole bowl.  I did use brown sugar with the sweet potatoes and they were not too sweet. Just right coupled with the topping. Thank you for this great recipe!

My niece was hosting Thanksgiving dinner and she asked me to bring sweet potatoes.  It was my first time making sweet potatoes of any kind.  I read the reviews about it being sweet, but decided to take my chances and follow the recipe.  I had GIANT sweet potatoes so had to bake them longer.  I also wanted them a bit more creamy so I doubled the heavy cream.  These were a huge hit.  My mother in law made a point to come up to me and tell me how delicious they were.  There was a little bit left over so the next morning I made  sweet potato patties and fried them.  No need for syrup.  I will be making this again!!!

I was looking for something to do with sweet potatoes and I didn’t want the marshmallow and overly  heavy sweetness.  This recipe here did the trick it was delicious it was a very sweet we use walnuts  which we could add chopped up a little finer than what we had used other  that it was scrumptious a keeper.

Loved this and so did my company! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't make the recipe as is. Like others suggested I used 1/3 white sugar and 2/3 brown...and I probably put extra spices because I always go heavy on the spices. But with those changes it was 5 star all the way!!

Husband wanted "whipped" sweet potato casserole this time.  So glad I found this recipe, he helped me put it together and both of us really enjoyed this with our TG turkey dinner.  I'm gonna share link to this recipe with my sis.
edit to add: the recipe is perfect as written,  cannot think of anything to add or subtract. Please do try it !
edit to add: I reviewed this Nov. 2017 and I'm not changing anything , just want to say.... please BAKE (NOT BOIL) the sweet potatoes. Baking gives such depth of flavor. Boiling takes that away.  Thanks !  :-)

I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 c and the brown sugar to 2/3 c.  I think, next time, I will omit the white sugar. It wasn't too sweet. I'm just not sure it's necessary. I also used ghee and coconut creamer because of dairy allergies. It turned out great!

This sweet potato dish received the most compliments at our Thanksgiving Dinner.  Love that you can do most of the preparation ahead of time, then freeze.  Left the topping for the day before and baked it.  Twice heated through makes for an easy, but delicious dish. PS  I doubled the amount of potatoes, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.

As written, too sweet for my family and not enough topping, but I'm still giving this 4 stars because it's easily modified. With modifications, I would increase this to a 5-star recipe.  

DONNAPF1's tip about using a mixer and NOT scraping the beaters was perfect -- no fibrous strings! 

Due to the numerous reviews that commented about this being too sweet, I used 6 large sweet potatoes (cooked on Manual Pressure - High for 20 minutes in my Instant Pot, and then quick release), and I waited until the very end to add the eggs so I could first test the sweet potato mixture with half the white sugar. After tasting the eggless mixture, I determined it was STILL too sweet for my family's taste so I doubled the cinnamon to further reduce the sweetness, and then I added the eggs.  

From browsing other users' photos of this dish, I could also see that the topping needed to be doubled in order to meet my expectations . However, doubling the topping did make this too sweet for a few (but not all) of us, so next time I will double the topping while reducing the brown sugar by 25%.

There weren't any leftovers for me to bring home so I'll be making another batch this weekend, although I may try freezing half the batch to see how well that works.

Great recipe.  I made a few minor changes and my family really liked it.  I did not put any sugar in the sweet potato mash.  My son is diabetic so we tried to avoid added sugar.  It tasted great without it.  Also, instead of baking the sweet potatoes, I peeled them and cut them into chunks and steamed them for about 10 to 15 minutes until tender.  Saves a little time!

I do not eat sweet potatoes so my review is solely on the word of those who ate it. I only cut back in the brown sugar. I made it with 2/3 cup. Everyone raves about it and said it was the best. They want it for Christmas now too. Very easy recipe as well!

I’ve never had anything like this before, I made this for a thanksgiving potluck at church and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and made sure i used larger sweet potatoes.  i peeled, chopped, & boiled the potatoes instead of baking them.  this is now the dish i have to make for all of our family gatherings.

I love this recipe.  Easy to make and it was a hit with my family.  The only thing I did differently was add more sugar because we tend to like our sweet potatoes a little sweeter.

Made this for Easter Sunday. My uncle who had never liked sweet potatoes before, had a second helping and wanted to take some home with him too. Delicious! I used all the sugar and didn't think it was too sweet. I think how much sugar you add depends on the size of your sweet potatoes. I had small ones so I used seven of them.

The only change was  I cut the sugar in half due to reviews who recommended that.  I served it at Easter and my BIL who stated he didn't like sweet potatoes told me that he has changed it mind and I can make this recipe for him anytime.  Everybody loved it.  I just had the very last of it tonight as a side and it was just as good.  It's a keeper.

Made this wonderful recipe!!  I did Change a few things though.  I used 6 sweet potatoes instead of 5,3 eggs instead of 2 eggs, used 6 tablespoons of condensed milk and 4 tablespoons of milk instead of whipping cream, also used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of lemon extract instead of 1 tsp of vanilla extract.    This is just great!!!

Amazing! The pecans gave it a nice balance with the creamy potatoes. I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone at the table complimented me and asked for this recipe. Even a few who didn't like sweet potatoes loved this dish. Definitely making it this way from now on. A++

I left out the cream, kept the butter and replaced the sugar with the sweet potatoes with a little maple syrup, but I did add some sugar for the topping.  Next time, I may add a little more spice. Nice recipe, I got the result I'd hoped for!

We loved it.  My son, who "actively avoids sweet potatoes" had seconds.  One change, out of necessity, was eggnog for cream, because we were out of cream.

After reading many reviews, I decided to make this recipe exactly as written for one of my side dishes.  Although many online reviewers said it was too sweet, my guests and I thought it was perfect even served with a honey baked ham.  I would definitely make this again...it will become my only sweet potato casserole recipe.  This is a winner!

This was easy and delicious! My family loved it more than our "former" Christmas sweet potato dish. We will definitely keep this one for the future. I actually baked the exact recipe in a 9x9 square dish rather than a 9x13.

I followed the directions  without reading the reviews, and it was  definitely too sweet.... even for the sugarholics in my family.  I would make it again, but heed the advise of others.

My family really liked this recipe. I found the amount of the topping would not cover the entire top of the casserole so I sprinkled another 1/2 cup of chopped pecans on top.  Next time I'll double the topping recipe.

Yes I love this dish. I never liked sweet potatoes before, with all the marshmallows on top. When I tasted this I fell in love with it. Avery year it's a must at our house.

This is a wonderful recipe, even my husband who prefers more plain type food said these were terrific.  This was definitely a hit and I will make them again for sure. NLB

I've made this dish twice, and it was great both times! I cut back on the sugars, as suggested by others: used 1/3 cup of white sugar & 2/3 cup of the brown sugar. I also don't peel the potatoes, since I want the extra nutrition. I just put them in the microwave, then throw everything into my food processor. Comes out nice and smooth, even with the peel (which no one can tell is in it). First time I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used half&half. No other changes. Great dish both times!

Delicious!  Hubby who isn't a sweet potato fan loved it!  I do think that next time I make it I will follow others' advice to cut back a bit on the sugar, as it was a little sweet.

I've made it twice so far, and I reduced the amount of sugar to nearly half of the original recipe both times, and also used whole milk instead of the heavy cream. The second time I also omitted the pecans before baking & added them on the individual servings at the table. Both variations were absolutely delicious, and has definitely been added to our special menu line-up! Everyone loved this, even my sister who detests sweet potatoes liked this version!!

This was so delicious. I made it in an 8x8 pan since that was all I had, but that was great because the streusel topping was extra thick. I reduced the sugar in the sweet potatoes to 3 tablespoons but otherwise  followed the recipe exactly. Everyone at thanksgiving agreed it was their favorite dish.

We make this every year and love it! We've never had the problem with sweetness that some have noticed. That's probably because I use huge sweet potatoes. For me, this dish almost fills a 9x13 baking dish.

Instead of  baking the potatoes I steamed them on the stovetop and put a couple cloves and a dash of salt in the water. Everything else I did exactly as the recipe said. They were a real hit!! I will make them again!!

This recipe is full proof! This is the third year I have made these potatoes and they come out great each time. I did add a little nutmeg and extra cinnamon. Made them two days before Thanksgiving and cooked it the day of. They were delicious.

These were so good!! I used half and half instead of heavy cream because that's what I had on hand. For some reason I thought the recipe called for cinnamon and nutmeg (I think I was mixing up the recipes of everything I was making for Thanksgiving), so I added that one additional thing, but otherwise made as per directions. I do believe that I could cut back on the sugar a bit next time, as many reviewers stated, but still a yummy treat for the holidays.

This combination of ingredients sounded good but in preparing it I realized how much sugar is added. I cut it in half and it still was much too sweet. I even substituted some of the sweet potato with Butternut squash. It was more like a dessert than a side dish.

Found this recipe a couple of years ago and probably made it 7 times since then.  Only thing that comes close to Grandma's.  It's becoming a fall MUST in my house.  It's so perfect and delicious.  Cooks up fluffy and perfect every time.

The time is NOT long enough to cook the sweet potatoes.  45 minutes at 400° is perfect, they will be nice and soft.  I recommend washing the sweet potatoes and poking holes in them with a fork before baking, to maximize cooking and caramelization.  Also agree with cutting back sugar.  PERFECT!

Been making this for years now!  Everyone loves them and insist I be the one to make the sweet potatoes.   The only change I make is to cut back on the white sugar to 1/3 cup and brown sugar to 2/3 cup.    Fantastic recipe!!!

My husband loves sweet potatoes and I don't so I thought I would try something different. He  loves this recipe and I now make it for him every year. I halved the sugar but other than that, follow the recipe closely. Perfect every time.

Delicious! I did double the topping because my family loves the topping as much as the sweet potatoes.  A Thanksgiving favorite of ours!

This recipe is amazing. I made it for the first time yesterday. Today, I'm going to the grocery store to get more sweet potatoes coz I'm making it again today. I steamed the potatoes instead of baking. They were much easier to peel that way. Thank you for this recipe. My husband absolutely loves it!

The BEST sweet potato casserole.  I'm always asked to make it at family gatherings. Recently I made a version of it using purple sweet potatoes. Yes, PURPLE. It was excellent. It tasted largely the same, however purple sweet potatoes are drier than orange sweet potatoes so I added about two tbsp extra oil and 1 tbsp extra milk. I usually use coconut oil in place of butter and coconut milk in place of dairy. I also add a pinch of allspice to the crust.

so easy and so yummy! i used evaporated milk instead of cream and halved the recipe. if you're looking for an easy to do, fail proof, and tasty sweet potato recipe this is one for the books. the only issue i had was getting the potatoes soft enough to mash. they weren't softening in the oven before hand so i took them out, skinned, chopped and boiled them. this seemed to speed up the process. and id even go as far as warming them up in the microwave if you're really pressed for time. best wishes!

Really good!  But agree with others to cut back white sugar in the potatoes and brown sugar in the topping. I increased the nuts on top too.

OMG.  This recipe rocks!  I cut the sugars in half and added an extra potato, maybe two, and it was just right.  Just enough sweetness.   I will definitely be making this again.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe - and I don't even like sweet potatoes as a rule.  We scraped it clean for Thanksgiving and I've had requests to make it again for Christmas.  I made the casserole the day before and held it covered in the fridge until the oven was free - threw the topping on and baked it just before serving.  Easy Peasy!

Instead of cutting the sugar or other sweet  ingredients, I just cooked extra sweet potatoes as I was feeding 14 people for Thanksgiving dinner.  I didn't change anything else in the recipe.  It was a hit, even for people who claimed they did not like sweet potatoes.  I will be making this again and again.

Roasted sweet potatoes in the oven, subbed low-fat milk for heavy cream, reduced sugar as suggested in other reviews and used a TON more pecans than the recipe called for.  This was the first time we had sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving and my family enjoyed it. This dish will replace pumpkin pie FOR SURE.

Fine.  Went over well.  Adjust seasonings (a.k.a. butter) to what you think.  Doesn't make a lot of topping w/ ingredients  or be particularly crumb-like.  Might wanna play with that.

This casserole was beyond awesome. I halved the amount of sugar in the potatoes and it was still perfectly sweet. I used 6 large potatoes which I'd microwaved and kept everything else the same. Guests raved about it. This will definitely be added to my list of holiday (or everyday!) favorites.

Well, I gave up the marshmallows for this recipe and was more than pleasantly surprised.  There was one problem I had.  I prepared the recipe and after assembling the dish  I discovered I left out the eggs.  I scraped off the topping as best I could,  put the potatoes back into the bowl and added the eggs. Now, I was a little short on the topping because I couldn't get it all off so, I just made additional and topped it as directed.  The family loved it.  There were some who never ate sweet potatoes going back for seconds.  Thanks for a wonderful keeper!  Debbie

I made several changes to lower calories.
I used one egg, 1/4 cup white sugar to mix the potatoes.
For the topping, I toasted pecans, then coarsely chopped them, mixed them with a sprinkling of cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar. The topping was added just before baking.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was wonderful. My family loved it , even the ones who don't like sweet potatoes. I didn't use any sugar in the sweet potato mash at all. It was already naturally sweet. I also cut the sugar in the topping down to 1/2 cup.

This is the best sweet potato dish we've ever had. I didn't change the recipe at all, but my sweet potatoes always take an hour and a half to cook.  I make it every Thanksgiving.

I have made this for the past couple of years, loved by everyone!  I always get asked for the recipe but I don't like to give it away.  I cook the sweet potatoes in a pressure cooker because it takes less than ten minutes and they cook evenly and are moist.  We are at high altitude and everything takes longer.  I also cut back on the sugar because it is pretty sweet as is.  I never liked the canned yams at thanksgiving and this beats it by far!!

Excellent.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  The only thing I MIGHT do differently is add some mini-marshmallows during the last few minutes of baking.

This is the best sweet potato casserole ever!  Seriously!  I've had some with much more sugar and cream and even though it's still more of a dessert than a side dish, it's not as bad for you as so many others.  I do "cheat" a tiny bit and use a larger baking dish and add more pecans and brown sugar, but that's the best part!  I do cut down a tad on the white and brown sugar, but not a lot.  Heck, we only have it once a year!  My husband and son never liked sweet potato casserole before trying this.  Now they can't get enough!  For you out there using canned sweet potatoes, come on!  Look up the "foolproof way to bake sweet potatoes".  It's so easy and makes this recipe so much better!

FIVE STARS all the way! THE most amazing sweet potato recipe EVER! I made a little more than the recipe called for, as I was making it for a potluck, and I also added crushed cinnamon graham crackers to the topping ( just added to the amazing-ness! ;) The only other thing I changed (lucky accident) was to use brown sugar inside instead of the white sugar that the recipe stated. Overall, I can't WAIT to make it again... which I will in a few days for Thanksgiving 2015 with the family. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and will again this year.  I don't like sweet potatoes so I did not eat any, but the family members who do raved about this.  There wasn't any left.  I did take the advice from others and backed off on the white sugar and replaced with brown sugar.

Great recipe. It has become a staple at our Thanksgiving table for years now. Like many other reviewers, I cut little bit on the sugar both in the casserole itself and in the topping. Also, you need to adjust the baking time  depending on the size of the sweet potatoes.  When I am in a hurry, I jut cut the sweet potatoes in halves or quarters and boil them instead. That takes less time for them to get softened.
Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

i did not use any sugar in sweet potato or anything else except cinnamon(just nicely mashed potaoes with a bit of cream,any type) and my topping was 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of brown sugar melted in saucepan until butter is barely melted(no more or it will harden) whisk it well until blended together and pour over casserole. Place whole pecans no flour on top in a nice pattern and bake 350 for 45min. Delicious!

Our oven was broken but we needed to use up some sweet potatoes. So I boiled them, used a hand mixer to mash them and then just sprinkled on the topping. Still divine!

Made a half recipe of this since it was for dinner for 2. Was skeptical but left all amounts as-is and it turned out great! Only thing I did different was I boiled the potatoes instead of roasting them. My husband raved about them, and they were perfect- not too sweet at all. Just right. The roasting makes them sweeter naturally, so in the end I'm actually glad I didn't, becuase it would have pushed it over the edge to too sweet (my husband agrees). Made my holiday dinner fantastic- this one is a keeper!

Wonderful taste! I used a food blender to purée it. Next year I will use a food processor instead, that would be a lot faster. I also think next time I will peel and boil, easier than baking or microwaving the potatoes.

I make sweet potato dishes all the time from the Orange marshmallow version to vanities with pecans on top. This is my favorite and have gotten most compliments on this dish. Cut down on sugar as others have suggested is the only adjustment I make.

Delicious! I do not even like sweet potatoes and I loved this dish. My Georgia-born hubby said this is the best sweet potato casserole he has ever tasted. The only change that I made was to double the topping and halve the white sugar. Make this for Christmas, Easter and every day in between. Yummy!

My family absolutely devoured this, but it was too sweet for me.  Still, after the way my family raved, I will def be making it again.  I added shredded leftover turkey for a one-dish meal!

This was delicious!  My husband absolutely loved it.
I halved the sugar in the sweet potatoes (not the topping), and it was still a little sweet for my taste, but like I said, my husband loved it.
The topping really makes it for me!
I nuked 4 large sweet potatoes in the microwave - stab a few times with a knife, nuke 4-5 min, flip, nuke 4-5 min - and the texture was perfect.
Will definitely make again!

I like this, although I think my family thought it was a little sweet.  I roasted my sw potatoes at 400 for 1hr-1hr 15min.  You really don't need to make extra of the topping - it's great as is.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! My family loved it and several asked for the recipe. The only change I made was baking the sweet potatoes for about an hour, then scooping out the pulp. I also doubled the recipe and the proportions worked great.

I thought it was too sweet for my taste. However, my husband and my mother truely loved it and want me to make it every time I make sweet potatoes. THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING, seeing how they DON'T LIKE SWEET POTATOES!!! How can someone turn a recipe like that down??? The only thing I would do a little differently is cut down on the sugar just a little and add more nuts. Other than that, IT'S PERFECT!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving 2014 - big hit!  I cut down on the sugar slightly (maybe about  3/4 of what was called for) but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Will do this again!

Thanks to all the reviewers who said to use a mixer for mashing the sweet potatoes to remove the strings! Made it as the recipe is written but I just grabbed 5 good sized potatoes and didn't worry to much about the size/amount. I peeled and cut them into chunks and boiled like white potatoes till soft. The topping was awesome and my husband has already asked me to make another batch as we were asked to leave the tiny remains at my daughters after Thanksgiving dinner!! He said this casserole tasted like his grandmothers!!

Change from the usual marshmallow topped sweet potato slices.  Made the potatoes per recipe. Did cut sugar in half from another reviewer hint. Cut the butter in half next time. Topping. Way too much butter. Topping was semi  crusty coating after and hour in the oven. Cut the called for 14 c butter to couple tablespoons and leave it cold. Don't need much with that amount brown sugar and flour. Mixes crumblier. Holds up excellent made the night before. Put on crumbly topping before baking.

O....M......G......This is the most devine thing I've tasted in a long, long time.  It almost doesn't need the pecan topping.  My MIL suggested we make it in a pie crust and serve it for dessert next time (which I just might do!)  I will never make my sweet potatoes / yams any other way.  You have to try this recipe!!

I didn't use the sugar mixed with the sweet potatoes at all, substituted almond milk for the heavy cream and used about 1/2 cup of marshmallows instead of the sugar in the topping just for fun.  Delish! Happy Thanksgiving!

I used this recipe' but after baking the sweet potatoes I peeled them and left them in chunks instead of mashing them with the other ingredients.  This offers more of a chunk of potato in each portion.  I also doubled the amount of topping.  Excellent side dish and a favorite of family and friends.

I've been making this casserole for years now. It is a family favorite on both my side and my in laws. Every Thanksgiving and Christmas I'm expected to bring in and I do...gladly! Sometimes I add marshmallows to half the casserole. It is so delicious, our holidays are not holidays without this dish...definitely a must try!

I actually made this in the crock pot and it went over fantastically...I also doubled the cinnamon and used a whole cup of heavy whipping cream. While the topping wasn't crisp, it was still incredible. I plan to make this again. Oh and I used black walnuts instead of pecans. Gave it a very unusual flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  My children that did not already love sweet potatoes have now crossed over.  It took some convincing that this was a new recipe and they would like it, but both of my girls ate every bite on their plate and one even had thirds.  Any recipe that all seven of my kids try and all 7 of them like deserves 5 stars.  My friend was over for supper as well and raved about how she'd never had sweet potatoes made this way and that they were wonderful.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  It will definitely be my go-to now.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made it exactly as the recipe states (which I think everyone should do if they are going to rate a recipe). We will be making this every holiday.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This will be THE sweet potato casserole that I use from now on.  Very tasty!  I made this exactly as the recipe reads, except for having to microwave my sweet potatoes after the 35 minutes in the oven to get them to soften.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year in addition to my normal candied yams topped with marshmallows (which is always a hit,  and has been developed by me when I was a teenager ) ... I decided to try this one because it reminded me of the delicious sweet potatoe casserole at Ruth's Chris (awesome steakhouse restaurant) that I love ...  Needless to say,  it was a hit...  My fiancé asked "who made the sweet potato casserole?"  I said "I did...  " He said"no really... Who made it"? I said I "ME!!"  And he said  "well why don't you ever make it for us at home??..." LOL... Needless to say,  I guess he liked it... LOL.  The only thing that I might change for next time, would be to add a dash of cinnamon to the crumble on top . but otherwise,  it was great!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe but still put it in a single casserole dish cooking as recommended. I refrigerated it for the next day and cooked again (same temperature and time), but covered it in foil so the topping would not burn. It turned out perfect.  At least 3 people at my family gathering who did not like sweet potatoes told me they loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I also used less white sugar than the recipe called for and it turned out great.  Definitely a staple from now on.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The instant response from anyone who took a bite was "this is REALLY good!" I took a plate of food to my sick brother in-law and he begged me later that night to bring him some more of those sweet potatoes! Love the recipe!

I used 2 cans of yams, less white and brown sugar, and also accidentally left out the butter from the sweet potato mix. It was delicious, and I got several comments about how good they were.

Made this to bring to the family Thanksgiving dinner today, 24+ guests and everyone absolutely loved it.  A few people suggested that I bring this to dinner every year from now on.  Thanks for this de-lish dish!  Happy Thanksgiving from New England...home to the first Thanksgiving feast.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I boiled the sweet potatoes and cut down on the sugar by about 1/4 c. I totally forgot the milk and used glazed pecans from Trader Joes so I cut down on the brown sugar also. Wow, better than the Yummy Sweet Potatoes recipe. SECOND TIME AROUND MADE THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN CUTTING DOWN ON THE WHITE SUGAR BY A LITTLE. OMG...SO GOOD!!

I'm glad I read the reviews and didn't go by the ratings alone.  It is a good place to start, and with reducing the sugar by half, definitely 5 stars.

My whole family LOVED this! I halved the sugar and it makes it a 5 star recipe!!! I made this the night before and cooked it the next day. Also, I have always boiled my sweet potatoes. If you boiled them then rinse them with cold water the skin slides right off. So easy and so full of flavor :)

Made this today for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I had to cook it longer than the posted time for the topping to set nicely. I did use two large cans of sweet potatoes to save time. I used my immersion blender to cream the sweet potatoes and evenly distribute the ingredients. Save this one!

I only made half the recipe and got yelled at that there was only 1 spoonful left. Thanks so very much for this recipe! I guess from popular demand I will be making these again and again :) Oh and I pre-baked 3 large sweet potatoes yesterday. Worked out so good. Added some nutmeg and left out nuts! AWESOME!!!!!!!

Delicious!  We're making this instead of the usual marshmallow version this year.  We tried it a few days ago and my husband and daughter both requested it for today. :)  Thank you!

This recipe has become a tradition for Thanksgiving the past few years!  I have to make it both for the work potluck every year as well as for Thanksgiving at my mother-in-law's house.  All of my coworkers demanded the recipe.

Everyone loved this dish!  I used VERY large sweet potatoes and left out the vanilla extract.  I also only used 2T of white sugar and a little extra cinnamon.  This cut down on the sweetness of the potatoes, but let the topping shine!  Super delicious - we'll definitely make this every year.

I used to HATE sweet potatoes; but this recipe is something I actually  CRAVE!  They are the best.  Another great thing about them is they freeze well.  I make a big pan of this, eat what we want for a meal or two and freeze the rest in individual serving sized containers.  Makes for a fast lunch treat at work!

perfect as is, added more butter to topping to get the texture right-menu this w/ something savory, like stuffed pork chops---microwave potatos saving time

Thanks for the recipe.  I made this is as  a side dish,but my hubby thought it was a dessert. Unless you cut back on the sugar, it is too sweet to be a side dish compliment.

Excellent dish for the holidays. I microwaved the potatos in a plastic bag and then mashed them, rather than baking them. Saved a lot of time!! Very easy dish!

I had 8 people ask me for this recipe, they all loved it. 2 sweet potato haters have been converted !!! I substituted oat flour for wheat flour as I need wheat / gluten free recipes, I used dark brown sugar instead of light & Half and Half instead of heavy cream. I used extra pecans too.

Amazing!  I don't alter the ingredients and it turns out just right.  I do skip the part where you bake the potatoes.  I just peel, dice into large chunks and boil.  This is really easy!

This was nothing special.  Mashed sweet potatoes with pecan sugar topping.  It would have been less work and fewer calories (and the same or better taste) to have eaten the sweet potatoes whole with butter and sugar.

This recipe was very well received. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and only used 1/3 C of white sugar and 2/3 C pf brown sugar. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Thank you!

I reduced the sugar to a little over 1/4 c and this was sweet enough.  My husband actually said it was too sweet.  The kids and I loved it!     Made the sweet potatoes the day before, reheated in the microwave just enough to mash, tossed together and into the oven.  Definitely a keeper!!

This was a good idea but mine was way too sweet and I even cut the white sugar down to 1/6 of a cup. It was very rich and I couldn't eat much of it. I will definatley try this agin but I think I will just have plain sweet potatoes on the bottom with nothing added to it and the pecan/brown sugar mix on top.

I made this per the recipe, except I boiled the potatoes (much faster) and I cut the topping in half. I used marshmallows to top the other half. It looked beautiful but I thought it was way way too sweet. I will try it again but next time I won't mix any sugar in with the potatoes. They already have a nice sweet flavor on their own.

The first year I made this recipe, I was a bit distracted and accidentally stirred the topping mixture in with the potatoes.  Needless to say, they were a huge hit!  This year when I made them, I made sure the topping was put on the top.  Again, these potatoes were fabulous.  Either way you make them, you'll really like them.  Next year, I'll be using yams rather than sweet potatoes.  The flavor isn't an issue for me and the yams have so much more color than sweet potatoes.

We love sweet potatoes and this recipe is probably a family favorite.  I leave the nuts out b/c nobody in my family likes them but this is a great recipe!

Excellent! Was a total hit at Thanksgiving, and as my first time making anything with sweet potatoes. Very sweet, almost good enough for dessert. This will be my go-to recipe whenever a sweet potato casserole is needed!

I don't think I've ever gotten as many compliments for anything I've made than I did when I made this for Thanksgiving. This was EVERYONE'S favorite dish, even my mother who really isn't fond of sweet stuff. This was incredible! I'm glad I didn't opt for the ol' marshmallow sweet potatoes

Pretty good, the topping is delicious.  However I found the potatoes to be waaaaaaay too sweet.  Next time I think I will try a salty mashed potato type base with the sweet topping.  With both, it was just way too much for me.

Followed exactly and it was awesome! My "blunder" was not baking my sweet potatoes long enough, so they weren't totally soft when I went to mash them. I did my best, and after the dish was baked, there were some nice, soft chunks that I thought added a nice texture to the dish.

Awesome!!!! Followed exactly. I made the sweet potatos except for the topping the night before Thanksgiving because I had about 30 people that would be coming over. I added the topping right before I baked them. My lil sister doesn't like sweet potatos and I found her taking some home for later. It came out great. In fact I was asked to make it again for Christmas. Thanks Heather

This is a keeper!  I took the suggestions of others and cut back on the sugars.  For the white sugar I used 1/4 cup and for the brown sugar I used 1/2 cup.  I loved the heavy cream and add that touch of creaminess I was looking for in other recipes.  The pecans topping is the best.

Awesome! I peeled and boiled the sweet potatoes. Mashed up about 5 cups worth and mixed in the rest of the ingredients. Sort of tasted like pumpkin pie and everyone loved it this thanksgiving. I'm now the official cassaole maker.

Followed the other reviewer's advice and cut down on the sugar and added an extra egg for firmness.  Even my traditional Korean parents went back for seconds!

I made this as a Thanksgiving side dish, and it went over wonderfully. It took about twenty minutes for one of the kids to notice there were no marshmallows- and about 2 seconds for the family to unanimously agree that they weren't missed! I omitted the nuts, as my kids have braces, and those weren't missed either. Four stars only because as sweet as this came out, I think it would have been made a bit better by adding more sweet potatoes. That would balance out some of the sugar, and also made for more of this yummy side dish. Will definitely make again!

My topping was wetter than normal, I think it was because I made ahead of time and then cooked the next day.  Tasted good, but a little too sugary.

I also peeled and then boiled the potatoes first and cut down the white sugar to a third of a cup from other reviewers suggestions. Left everything else the same.  The sweet potatoes I bought were white and that threw everyone else off.  But since this was my first time making a SPC I had no idea the usual is orange.  I thought it tasted very good and I came home from Thanksgiving dinner with none left which is awesome.  My mom and everyone else just adored it and I will for sure be making this when asked. (I have issues with sugar so this will not be for me personally) Thanks for the recipe!

My mother, aunt, and boyfriend are huge fans of sweet potatoes so I decided to make this as one of my dishes for Thanksgiving. However, I thought this was great, and I don't usually like sweet potatoes! I followed the recipe exactly except used 1/4 cup white sugar because I thought 1/2 cup sounded like A LOT! I give it four stars because my two family members thought it was extremely sweet and tasted more like a dessert than a side.

It took making it once to make it perfect.  I doubled the topping but still used 1/2 cp pecans.  We loved it and will probably use this recipe from here on out.

I think maybe my sweet potatoes were too big.  This was okay.  I lessened the sugar like the reviewers recommended, but I think mine might have needed it since I had so much sweet potato.  I also added extra pecans on top and that was good.

This was pretty good, but I thought the potato mix itself came out pretty dry for me. I steamed the potatoes (a lot faster and more cost efficient than baking to soften). I tend to like a sweeter casserole. I think this would be a good compromise if you have a group of people with different tastes for sweetness.

This was stupendous.  I've only recently become a fan of sweet potatoes for their nutritional perks, and although they taste fairly good as a baked potato, I've always preferred pumpkin pie over sweet potato pie.  This recipe has changed my mind!  We bought four potatoes from a farmer's market, so we had to scale the recipe down somewhat.  I also lessened the sugar in the filling (but not the topping), and may do so even more next time.  The dish tastes more like a dessert than a side dish, but trust me, I'm not complaining.  We didn't have any pecans on hand, so we just omitted nuts in the topping all together, but I wish we had had something; I think the crunch would have been a great addition.  I'm definitely making this again, and soon!

This is my first review after being on allrecipes for quite some time and I must say this is wonderful. It is now our only sweet potato recipe. I also boiled my potatoes to make this easier and it was still wonderful.

Very good! I followed the recipe and didn't think it was "too sweet" like many other reviewers, but I do have a sweet tooth. It really just comes to personal preference.

Very, very good!  I made these for Easter Dinner, yesterday, and everyone loved them.  I had three large sweet potatoes and I did as someone else suggested (peel, boil, & mash) which was simple.  I had to make two batches of topping, but I think that is b/c I larger pototoes.  This recipe will definitely go in my box.  Thanks!

I made this recipe on a slightly smaller scale and it turned out ok. I think I screwed up the topping by using margarine but it was all that i had... a fairly good recipe and I will probably make again with the proper ingredients.

I first tried this recipe because my friends husband is allergic to orange juice, so i couldn't make sweet potatoes my old way. Well i tossed out my old recipe and have used this ever since! I always make extra topping since that's everyone's favorite part.

This is very good. I followed the recipe to a T. The only suggestion that I have is to make sure that your potatoes are done. I used 4 very large potatoes and the baking time that the recipe stated was not nearly long enough. I ended up finishing them up in the microwave so that they were soft enough to mash, which I did with an electric mixer. Thanks, this was a great addition to our Christmas dinner.

This was my first time making a sweet potato casserole, and I have to say this recipe is rocking!! It was easy to make and was a hit, I did not have any left overs. My mom asked me to make it for her Christmas party. I boiled the sweet potato's and then mashed (found this to be better then canned)

Baking the potatos before peeling them causes the skin to separate from the potato so It peels right off. I cut the recipe in half since it was only for 4 people, and I topped it with marshmallows because I love marshmallows. Try this recipe; you wont be disapointed.

This sweet potato recipe is the best!  While many of the guests were leery at first (it looked weird and it's sweet potato!), after trying a bite of it, they were in love!  The whole dish was finished and scraped clean!

Highly recommended!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I made with Splenda in the potato mix and only put the topping on 1/2 of the dish for some of our guests who do not like to eat sugar.  The topping was divine and the casserole is great the day after.  Very easy to prepare and I would definitely use this one again.  It got "mmmmmmm mmmmmm" yummy noises at the Thanksgiving dinner table.  Always a good sign!

Definetly a winner! I baked the sweet potatos instead of boiling and it was sooo time consuming. Made it again the next day, boiled potatos that time and could not tell the difference. I also doubled the topping for added crunch.

This was sooooooooooooooooooo good! I am now a sweet potato eater due to this recipe! I peeled the potatos before I boiled them and added marshmallows to half of the pan. I cooked a day a head of time and when I reheated it was when I put the marshmallows on (it was an after thought).

This was really a great hit at my Thanksgiving table.  I skipped the cream (didn't have any) and it was delicious. Next day for leftovers I added some marshmallows and it was gobbled down.

This was the best Sweet Potato dish I have ever had. I made this dish the day before Thanksgiving and baked for 35 minutes just before serving dinner. I peeled and boiled the sweet potatoes, I think this is faster and easier than baking them. I used less sugar on the potato mixture, less butter and no heavy cream at all. It turned out delicious. I will make it again for Christmas. Thanks Heather!

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. It deserves five stars, especially if you like sweet potatoes.  They were creamy with a sweet, crunchy topping.  The recipe is great as written.

This was very sweet and the potatoes need to cook waaaaaaaaaaaaay longer than 30 minutes. Why do you peel them after they cook? Why can't you boil them? Maybe thats a stupid question?

Yum!  We baked the potatoes longer so they'd be softer to mash.  We also put some marshmellows on top because we don't like the nuts.  Instead of cream we used soy milk (due to milk allergies).  They tasted great and two non-sweet potato eaters even said they tasted good!

Excellent Recipe! Followed directions exactly, except I used half the amount of sugar called for in the potato mixture. This is SO MUCH better and classier than marshmallow-topped sweet potatoes. Everyone at our Thanksgiving Dinner raved about them!!

I've never had such bad advice -- the skins are impossible to remove, as they're too soft to be peeled with a peeler, and too hard to push off with my fingers.  I'll never bake them first again -- save yourselves, peel them first and boil them as other suggested!

Don't change this at all. Perfect. Suggest spreading the topping well over the top instead of clumping.

I have made this for several years now and love it.  Don't change a thing.  For special occasions like Christmas or THanksgiving, I take the extra time to bake the sweet potato for an extra creamy texture.  Perfect every time!!

Just like it says in the introduction, after trying this, my non-sweet-potato-loving husband said, "this is way better than with marshmallows!" A two-step process, but really not complicated. And I didn't have pecans, so I skipped them. I'm sure it would be better with them in, but everyone loved it anyway.

This recipe was great! However, I learned a couple things in the process. The sweet potatoes take much longer to roast in the oven than the recipe says, mine took almost 2 hours, but if you need them quicker, you can try them in the microwave for about 14 minutes and then test them. Also, for the crumble topping, the butter does not need to be softened. In fact if it's cold, you can mash it together with the flour and makes it more crumbly. Pecan halves are also great instead of the pieces. Enjoy! :)

My family couldn't get enough!  I made the dish as per the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change anything.  Previous years I would make sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  My husband would tell me not to give him too much.  This year he couldn't stop eating it.  He was still raving about them a week after I made them.

We had this for thanksgiving and it was so good. My mom always made the crappy canned yams with marshmallows that I think are so nasty. This will be our new dish every year from now on.

This is the second year in a row I've made these! Being short on time, I used three 28-oz cans of yams with syrup, drained. Instead of the heavy cream, I used 2 Tbsp of cinnamon/vanilla coffee creamer, but in the future I would use 6 tbsp since they seemed a little dry. I loved that these didn't use marshmallows; I didn't want the extra calories. My kids loved this recipe and it will be a keeper in my recipe box. Thanks for posting!

Very good recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I'm still a sucker for marshmallows on my sweet potatos though. Next time I will try to incorporate them,   Thanksgiving just wasn't the same without them!

I followed others advice and used less sugar.  My mom commented on how much she liked them because they weren't as sweet as similar sweet potato dishes.  I used milk instead of cream because I didn't have any.  Will make these again and again.

I usually don't like sweet potatos or sweet potato casserole, but I really liked this.  I followed the recipe almost exactly. I forgot to buy half and half so i just used milk and I scattered a few marshmallows on top of the pecan topping just because I love toasted marshmallows.

The only way I've ever been able to eat a sweet potato was to slather it with butter and brown sugar. I was looking for something elegant to serve for Thanksgiving, and I'm glad I gave this recipe a try! Everyone loved it and said they would never want the marshmallowy casserole again. It was also beautiful coming out of the oven. Make sure to use 5 fairly large sweet potatoes, I ended up using 6 because mine were rather small.

My family never cared for sweet potatoes before. I followed the recipe except used 3 large cans (2 lb 8 oz) of  cut sweet potatoes.  Divded the mixture into two large loaf pans. Since we had children eating it, I dediced to top one pan with the pecan mix and one with marshmallows. 

 Both were a hit and even  DH who claimed to hate sweet potatoes reluctantly tried some and went back for seconds.  The pecan topped pan was the hit of the entire evening. Everyone raved about it all night. Making it again tonight with roast chicken.

Ah ha!  Finally my husband says this is better than his grandmother's!!!!!  Not too sweet (though sweet potatoes are always kinda dessert-like). This was the first time I used uncanned ones - think they are better like this - I boiled them after peeling for about an hour. Baked 45 minutes instead of 30.  let sit for awhile to set before serving - needs to "gel".  Delicious!!!!

Recipe turned out nicely - followed the exact recipe.  Several people commented that it was lighter and not as sweet as some sweet potato casseroles.  I would use this recipe again.

I made this yesterday and it was great!  All thumbs up from all of my kids(5 total)  I doubled the topping and added 1/4 cp. brown sugar to the mixture to give it a more richer flavor. I also added drizzles of caramel to the top 15 minutes before it was done.(baked for 40 min)You can also add all spice to it to give it more flavor in addition to just cinnamon.

This was delicious. I used brown sugar in the casserole, reduced the amount of sugar in the topping, didn't use pecans, and sprinkled marshmallows over the top during the last 10 minutes of baking. I loved the texture and the contrast of not-too-sweet casserole with the sweet crunchy crust. Great recipe.

I made this dish last week. After listening to my boyfriend talk about his Mother's marsh mellow sweet potatoes, I was determined to try something different. I added a bit of extra egg and it turned out great. We had leftovers for the following day and when I looked in the fridge, 'someone' had eaten all the topping off. No more marsh mellow comparisons to say the least.

I made this side dish for a dinner party I had last night.  Not many people ate it, but I'll have to assume they didn't like sweet potatoes.  I don't particularly like sweet potatoes either, but I had to try it because of the reviews.  It was wonderful.  Thank you.  I will make this again, especially with the holidays coming up.

These were quite delicious... although I'm a huge fan of marshmallows on my sweet potatoes, these were just as good!  I especially loved the topping.  Everyone else seemed to love it as well!

Wow!  Momma Bear wasn't going to make sweet potatoes at all this year but we make them this way and have a new "wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it" dish.  It is sweet, Momma Bear topped her pumpkin pie with it!

My husband went crazy for this recipe! He's not a huge sweet potatoe fan, but always is polite enough to have a couple of spoonfuls of the marshmellow topped kind I usually make. He said these were the best sweet potatoes he'd ever had and he especially loved the topping. Kids loved it, grandma loved it, husband loved it, I loved it. 'Nuff said!

We had our first Christmas dinner in our new home and I wanted to start new traditions. Sweet potatoes we never a family tradition but this recipe sounded so good I just had to try it and I am so glad I did! It turned out amazing and everyone just loved the recipe! They even tasted wonderful as leftovers too!
I made the recipe exact but I think next time I would cut the white sugar by half as the sweet potatoes were already so sweet as I roasted them instead of boiling. Other than that, this will definitely be a new tradition in our house.

My husband happened upon this recipe when he decided he wanted to bring sweet potatoes to Thanksgiving a few years back.  Everyone loved it and we've been bringing it every since (or else!).  My mother-in-law said she even liked it more than her own sweet potatoes!  An instant classic (hence the name, I presume).  Yummy!

I made this for a holiday dinner and thought it turned out great. I used less sugar as the potatoes were already sweet, and used half and half in place of the heavy cream. I also boiled my potatoes instead of baking them.

This recipe is wonderful, people who normally don't eat sweet potatoes ate this and liked it.  A physical fight almost started over who got to take the leftovers home! I just followed the recipe as it is written, although I added a few canned yams to make up for only having 4 yams instead of 5.

This is a really great recipe...everyone at the table loved it.  I wouldn't change anything.  I was a little concerned about the sweet potatoes considering the range in sizes, but went with 5 average to small ones and it seemed just right for the amount of sweetness. Thank you!

this was very good. I received lots of compliments on it. I didn't put in the pecans since my husband gets picky about nuts. I added a few marshmellows on top and thought that turned out fine.

This was a hit in my home!  I have never made this before & it was so easy!  I decided to boil the sweet potatoes instead of baking.  Also, my husband is allergic to pecans so I subsituted them w/ walnuts.  I will try almonds next time.  I also subsituted the white sugar with plantation sugar.  This is a recipe I will be using again and again in the years to come!

It just wouldn't be Thanksgiving without these sweet potatoes.  I've been making it for years, and it's a hit every time.  I've though about altering the recipe to "lighten it up," but why mess with perfection!

my family loves this !I adapted it to fit our vegan diet by using ener-g egg replacer instead of the eggs , soy creamer in place of the cream ,earth balance margarine in place of the butter and whole wheat flour .It tastes as rich as the original version !

These are really good. If you like Boston Markets sweet potatoes, you might like these. I served these for Easter and I got a few comments of how these were just as good as Boston Markets. They are different then theirs. Maybe better. I can't quite tell. I thought I would never say that! But these are soo good. The in laws were trying to get rid of all the leftovers, but said that the potatoes had to stay. The only thing that I did different was add some oatmeal to the streusel topping and some marshmallows to the top. Really sweet though.

Without a doubt, the best sweet potato recipe I have ever tried.  I made it for Thanksgiving and was asked by my mother-in-law to bring it to Christmas dinner.  Now I am the official sweet potato person.  You can't eat just one serving, they're excellent! Thanks Heather.

This dish was excellent.  My mom does NOT like sweet potatoes and I made her try it.  She actually took a second helping.  One problem is I made way too much.  I would try and cut the recipe down because of it's sweetness.  Thanks for the great recipe though!

We tried this for christmas dinner and it was good, but it wasn't great -maybe it was the VERY moist sweet potatoes or the fact that I put it in a too deep cassorole, and took longer to bake. Frankly with mashed potatoes(simular texture) at the meal and pumpkin pie(simular flavors) after, there's no place at my holiday table for this dish.

This recipe was a smash hit today at Christmas dinner.  I would like to play around with the spices and perhaps try ginger, clover, or pumpkin pie spice.  
It was great, even folks who don't like sweet potatos really liked this.

I increased this recipe to serve 12 and it came out perfect.  I substituted dark brown sugar for both the white sugar and light brown sugar to make it just a little less sweet.  Everyone who tried it raved about it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it!!  I had to boil the sweet potatos, due to lack of space in the oven, and they turned out wonderful.  It has been requested for Christmas dinner.  Thank you so much!

Loved it!!!1 I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone is asking for it again for Christmas dinner.  I baked the sweet potatoes and the only adjustment I made to the recipe was to put in less sugar.  It is very sweet.  You won't be sorry with this one!

Excellent dish!  After I loosely mashed the potatoes, I put them in the mixer and whipped them to make them extra creamy.  The smooth texture of the potatoes nicely contrasts with the crunchy streusel topping.  Can't wait to make for Christmas.

5+ This is by far the best sweet potato recipe I have ever tried.  Not only does it taste incredible but it is so simple to make.  It could even be used for a dessert.  I got raves for dish even from people who say they never liked sweet potatoes.

Love this! I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and the brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup, and omitted cream as it wasn't needed. Fantastic. Did the oven cooking but due to potatoes being all different sizes, it was quite a task determining doneness and pulling each one out when done. Would have been easier peeling first and cutting them all into same size pieces. Next time, but if it changes the flavor I will go back to the more time consuming method because it is well worth it. Thank you very much for this new holiday favorite.

Like so many other reviews on this recipe, this sweet potato recipe will now be served on a regular basis. It is absolutely to die for! It is well worth the extra time it takes to prepare and it will replace our normal marshmellow recipe we have used for years! Ummmm.......so good!

Yum! Yum! this is a keeper!  This will be a part of my Thanksgiving repertoire.  I used 1/2 the amount of white sugar and the full amount of brown sugar for the topping and the results were wonderful.

These sweet potatoes were fabulous!  I used less sugar (1/2 c. brown and 1/3 c white) because I didn't want it quite as sweet and it was still plenty sweet.  I think this dish would be interesting if it were a bit spicier--maybe add a bit of cloves or allspice?  Definitely a permanent part of my holiday menu.

This recipe tastes GREAT! The best one I've tasted so far. I did the bake and peel method this time, but will peel and boil next time to save time.  I used the average size swt. pot. that the store had, and after 35 min. I still had to microwave them...and they were hard to peel hot. Other than that...they came out great and were loved by all.

HUGE...HUGE...HUGE HIT at Thanksgiving!!!  Everyone was raving.  I used a little less sugar, and it was great, but full sugar would have been just as good (I like mine a little sweet, but not too sweet) so next time I'll try it with full sugar.  I boiled the potatos, then whipped them.  This is a great dish.  I threw on just a few mini marshmellows, because my husband said he wouldn't eat it without them, but once he tasted it, he said he'd eat this anytime. Thank you!!

Ooooh soooo gooood. I have made this recipe at least four times, but always forget to rate it!! It is absolutely amazing and now a holiday must-have for our family. I do cut back on the sugar per the other reviews suggested... the white sugar to a 1/4 cup I think... and I used two knives to blend the brown sugar and butter. Definently a keeper!

I heeded the reviews that say to cut the sugar -- I tend to use dark brown sugar (never light) and skip the white sugar in recipes that call for both, anyway. it came out yummy. my teenager loves this dish at dinner, then comes back an hour later for "dessert".

Very good, many compliments.  Just allow yourself more than 35 minutes for the sweet potatoes to cook.  I cut it down to the last minute and had to figure out an alternate method when I couldn't mash them AT ALL!

THIS WAS FABULOUS.  I normally hate sweet potatoes and I loved this dish.  My entire family could not stop talking about how great it was.  No one ever ate the candied Yams that we usualy had every year, but every person at the table (adults and kids) loved this casserole!  It will now be part of all of our future Thanksgiving meals.

Wonderful-- big hit with everyone on Thanksgiving.  My mom told me this dish can be my annual contribution to the Thxgiving table.  I used half sweet potatoes and half yams.  They did not get soft after 35 minutes in the oven so I ended up cooking them in the microwave.  Also, only used about 1/2 of the butter in the sweet potato mixture.

Sweet potatoes are usually not a big hit with my family, but I still prepare them on Thanksgiving for company.  For the first time, my family preferred these sweet potatoes over the mashed white potatoes.  Compliments were received from everyone. Thanks.

Yummy recipe.  My grocer only had potatoes that looked over a year old, so I used canned.  After about 40 min. cook time, the topping still looked a little mushy, so I decided to put it under the broiler.  I then made the foolish mistake of turning around to find someone to carve my turkey!!  Needless to say, I had to scrape off the burnt topping!  Oh well, everyone still loved them.

I do not like sweet potatoes and usually only make them during the holidays to appease my family.  I ate two helping of these...they were that good.  Everyone who came to our Thanksgiving dinner raved about them and asked for the recipe.

My family has never been a fan of sweet potatoes for ANY ocassion, but since we had invited a few folks over for Thanksgiving, I decided to give this one a try. Wow! All the compliments! There was nothing left.  Delicious. A new favorite recipe for 3 families.

I could not believe how easy this tasty dish was to make. Even my grandmother gave me compliments on how fabulous the sweet potatoes were at Thanksgiving. To save time, I used canned sweet potatoes.

A Thanksgiving dish that turned out fabulous!  I normally don't like sweet potatoes/yams at all, but these were very good.  My husband says that we need to have this every Thanksgiving from now on.  I halved the sugars as many people suggested and I really can't imagine it with more sugar.  I also reduced the amount of butter by half.  Just a wonderful tasting dish.

I've tried a lot of sweet potato casseroles, and this is by far the best. No lumps, no strings, no greasiness - just a yummy sweet topping and smooth, creamy potatoes underneath. I found that the 35 minute baking time didn't quite do the trick, so I cut the potatoes into chunks and microwaved for 10 minutes (50% power) until softened. This will be my sweet potato recipe from now on.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner tonight and it was a huge hit.  I didn't have pecans so used 1/2 c chopped almonds.  Nice crunchy, crusty topping and everyone loved it!  A huge hit and a definite keeper.  Thanks for posting.

Was okay. Seemed like a little too much brown sugar.
