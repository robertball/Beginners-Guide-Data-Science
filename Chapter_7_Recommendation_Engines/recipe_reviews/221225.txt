This has fabulous flavor!  I did have to alter a little to suit what I had on hand.  I only had 3 chipotle peppers, so I did add some jalapenos because we like it spicy (and spicy it is!! We're breathing fire over here!).  I also added a can of tomatoes with green chilies because I was short on tomatoes.  I bet it would be even better with all fresh tomatoes.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  It's going to be a regular around here now.

Delicious salsa. I halved the recipe and didn't have chipotle peppers so I roasted a jalape√±o and a poblano instead. I also added a handful of cilantro. Possibly the tastiest salsa I have ever made.
