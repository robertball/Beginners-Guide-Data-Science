11.6.16  The only change I made was using regular flour tortillas (what I had on hand).  These little pinwheels are bursting with flavor, and really do taste like antipasto.  Really enjoyed this recipe, nothing not to like here!

I expected these to be a quick and easy snack. I didn't realize how good they would be! I made half with the pepperoncinis (good call with the glass of milk to cut the heat!) and half with black olives for my kid who doesn't like spicy foods. One tip: make sure the cream cheese is soft or it will be tough to mix and even harder to spread on the tortillas. I plan on making these again as a snack, light meal, or appetizer.

Interesting recipe, I liked making these. My local grocery store was out of fresh basil so I just used a small pinch of dried. I would like to try this adding lettuce, roasted red peppers, or other ingredients. I also would like to try to sub other favorite deli meats like turkey. I did not know how pinwheel type sandwiches were made exactly. Now, I don't have to buy them pre-made anymore. This would make a nice lite meal or lunch. Ty, Elizabeth

We LOVED these! I did use regular flour tortillas b/c that's all I had on hand, but that was my only change. The family gobbled these up with a glass of milk to wash it all down. This recipe is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Agree with Marianne, that since these may be made ahead, they are great to have on hand for those after-school munchies, and perfect with a glass of milk!  Tasty for the grown-ups too, as it is a slightly more sophisticated version of a classic bologna sandwich.  You can also sneak in some spinach too, by using the spinach tortilla wraps.  Thanks for the idea!

These are very tasty and extremely easy to put together.  The best part is that they are to be made ahead of time, thus making it easy to have on hand for either an after-school snack or for a social gathering.  The tortillas I used initially were handmade tortillas from Trader Joe's, and they seemed to be falling apart on me when I rolled them up.  I then pulled from my freezer the regular Mission tortillas to make sure they would roll up.  But the resting time in the fridge (2 hours) makes the whole wheat hold up just fine!  I followed the recipe exactly, and we enjoyed them a lot!  Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for our afternoon snack!  A cold glass of milk made these a perfect pick-me-up!

Made these exact to the recipe except I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried. These were fantastic! All the flavors worked well together and the pepperoncini gave it a nice kick! That glass of milk really hit the spot for the heat and paired perfectly with these. Will definitely make again and again.
