This recipe was very easy and tasted great!  The meat was fork tender and the marinade/gravy was good over rice.  We didn't have teriyaki sauce so we used soy sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar instead.  Also, we used 1/8 cup of frozen onions instead of onion powder.  We will DEFINATELY do this one again!!  One extra tip: before inserting the pan into the oven, spray the sides of the pan with non-stick cooking spray.  This made cleaning up the pan a breeze.

This just didn't excite me.  I was looking for a way to use some country style ribs that did not involve BBQ sauce, and thought this would suit, but I was disappointed.  The meat turned out incredibly tender, but the only taste that was apparent was the boatload of garlic! No flavor came through from broth or teriyaki. Won't be making this one again. (Thank goodness my husband wasn't home and didn't have to eat this - he would have pouted - LOL!)      [LATER THE SAME EVENING: OK, OK, I give.  I had neglected to taste the incredibly superior broth/au jus that cooked up, and was just tasting the meat!  Thicken that broth up and serve over smashed taters - to DIE for. The meat is MUCH better with the gravy poured over...!!! Nummies! }

This recipe was very taste and the meat just fell off the bones.  I did make some changes.  I did not have teriyaki sauce so I used soy sauce and brown sugar and I cut the chicken broth by half.  After removing the meat from the pan I made a gravey.  Definitly a keeper.  Maybe I will try the crock pot next time!

Ok here's what I did..you may not like but I had to put my own twist to it.  Instead of just chicken broth, I cut out the garlic powder and used 2 cups of Swanson's Roasted Garlic Chicken broth, and 2 cups of regular chicken broth.  1/4 of a package of onion soup mix. Substituted the teriyaki for Worcestershire, and 1/8 cup of liquid smoke.  I am one for seasoning my meat...here's what i use...season all, cavenders, onion powder, and lemon pepper.  It's up to you though.  Watch out for the oinion soup mix though, it has a bit of a salty taste to it.

One of the best rib meals I've ever prepared.  My husband was amazed at how good oven cooked ribs could be. But might want to included the marinating time in the prep time to make it 2 and a half hours versused two hours and 10 minutes.

This recipe was very good.  Very tender.  My husband loved them, and he is a very picky eater.  I had never cooked ribs before!  I'm glad my first time was a good experience!

I really liked this!  I did not have onion powder so I added a minced onion to the broth mixture.  When it was done I used the broth mixture as a base for gravy.  Yum!  Thanks!!

I thought this was a decent recipe but definitely not the best rib recipe out there. The meat was tender but I found the sauce overly salty. I also don't think you need 30 minutes to marinade it.

Super tender...no flavor.  The au jus was not appealing even to make as a gravy.   Ended up basking bbq sauce and broiling a couple mins.  The guys like em, but have better ways to make ribs tender with out all the broth and sauce

Maybe I used a fattier version of ribs, mine were boneless but these were initially very greasy. I too used roasted garlic broth, and raw onion instead of the powder. They were much better when I had them as leftovers and was able to skim off the grease. Potentially, my problems with this recipe were all my fault, but either way it could use a little more spice.

This was a great recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out great, even though I cooked it for an hour too long. Unfortunately, I couldn't make the gravy as there wasn't much liquid left after cooking so long, but my friend even asked me for the recipe.

OH MY GOD!!!! SO GOOD!!! In two hours they were cooked as well as some of the recipes that have them in for eight!
A few things I changed though
1 added worstacure sause to the maranade
2 seared them on the grill so they wern't soggy
3 ALL ribs need BBQ sause, no matter how good. I    blended some chipoltle peppers into some KC Masterpiece to give it a smokey flavor and it was absolutly amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!

The meat was very tender but not very flavorful.  Maybe we are just used to bbq ribs.  I won't make it again.

This was a very nice recipe & it turned out great!
 I did make a few changes to suit our taste. First,  next time I will use less garlic, I added about 1/2 a cup of Sweet & Sour Sauce which made the marinade thicker.  The marinade was also tasty on the white rice I made with it.
The ribs were so tender they were falling off the bones. They were delicious & I will make this again.

**If possible make the ribs in a throw away aluminum pan as the gravy is sticky & saved me a lot of cleanup time.

I made this last night and followed the instructions exactly. It was delicious. I used boneless country ribs. It's important to make the gravy from the remaining broth. I made a slurry of 2 Tbls cornstarch to 1 Tbls water and added that to the broth. Then I let it boil a few minutes to reduce, while stirring, and had a really delicious gravy to pour over the meat and mashed potatoes. I'll be making this again with other cuts of pork, as well.

This recipe was easy to follow. It took two and a half hours to cook. Sure it is due to the fact I have an electric oven versus a gas oven. Very tasty and was given rave reviews by my family.

I made this for dinner. I did add a cut-up, medium-sized onion and cooked it for 5 hours on high in my crock pot instead of baking it. It was really yummy when served over mashed potatoes with black-eyed peas on the side. Although I usually prefer making my ribs with BBQ sauce, this was an enjoyable change that I will make again. Thanks. :)

I was a little nervous making a no bbq rib, considering my husband is addicted to the stuff. But he absolutely LOVED it! My 2 1/2 year old devoured it. I used the left over juice on our white rice, yummy. The only thing I would do differently would be to somehow crisp the outside. Haven't figured out how yet, but if anyone knows please let me know! My husband asked me to put this recipe in my cookbook!

I  didn't have a roasting pan so I used actually a coated round cake pan. The Internet says cook pork at least two and a half hours. I  cooked 3 hours. It was tender and falling apart.  My dad loved it and he is a picky eater.

This recipe is easy and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor. Don't let the unappealing look of the pork fool you! I made a gravy from the juice and my husband thought the gravy really made the dish and suggested it be poured on before serving if we make this again in the future. I did not have chicken stock, so I used 4 c vegetable stock instead.  Also did not have teriyaki, and substituted with soy sauce and some brown sugar.

This was so good!  Instead of the teriyaki I used a barbecue sauce to give it a smokey flavor.  I made a gravy from the sauce the meat cooked in and all I can say is I will make this again!

My husband and I loved this!!! I pretty much followed all the directions exactly, with adjustments for having 3 lbs of ribs. My only deviations were using a bit less garlic powder (1 1/2 tbs for the 3 lbs) and cooking them for a total of 3 hours. I made a gravy out of the juices to put over the meat and rice and the meal was fantastic. I will definitely fix this again and again.

This was a hit with the family, even the little picky one. I ended up using brown sugar and soy sauce like some other comments. It was tender, moist, and just yummy. If you like seasoning then you made need to add a bit because this recipe doesn't provide a lot but the natural flavored are tasty.
