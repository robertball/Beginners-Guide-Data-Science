I made these delicious cupcakes while babysitting a ten year old girl. We had so much fun decorating AND eating the dessert. We had leftover cake batter so we used it to make a small cake. We also used the extra graham crackedrs, marshamallows, and the cutout pieces of cake to make the cake just like the cupcakes. 
These were a perfect snack for summer and reminded us of campfires!
