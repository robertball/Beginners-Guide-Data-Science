I made it the first time exact to the directions, didn't care for the overpowering flavor of the cranberries and the pectin should say (1.75oz) instead of (2oz.). Made it the second time reversing the ingredients, 2 cups grape juice, 3/4 c. cranberry, love, love, loved it! Very pretty in jars too.

I used this basic recipe with different types of juices.  Turned out perfect every time!  My favorite was an acai/blueberry combo!

This was just ok for me, I think maybe I used the wrong pectin or something. I would strongly suggest using white cranberry juice too, I used walmart brand cranberry juice and its more a brown color and not very nice looking. I might try it again with white cranberry juice and raspberry juice for something different. This was my first jelly though so I may have done something wrong.

What a great recipe! Unlike many jelly and jam recipes, this one is flexible. The quantities of each juice can be changed, as long as the total amount of juices used adds up to 2 3/4 cups. I've made this recipe three times so far, and each batch was a success.

Turned out really good!!! Ended up doing what others did and used this as a base. Did pomegranate and cranberry and OMG it was good!!! Didn't use as much sugar though, but it was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely love this recipe!  I am not a fan of grape jelly but I will actually eat this.  Can't wait to try it with other flavors.

I used apple juice instead of grape juice. Use what you have ;) The color was wonderful and the flavor was unique!
