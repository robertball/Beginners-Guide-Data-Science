A lovely recipe.  I had a panic about what to do with my impulse buy of a fresh pineapple--and this pineapple/bread pudding was perfect!  I turned the temp down to 350 and cooked it for twenty minutes longer to compensate for the fresh fruit.  Thanks again--it's devine!

The pineapple flavor was great, but way too much butter for me.  If I make it again, I'll use much less butter.

I love baked pineapple and this recipe was perfect. I have made it for years and found this recipe to be a little easier than my old one. I passed it on to my family.

Oh my, this was soooooooo delicious! I’ve since been making this for Thanksgiving every year. I  used 4 cups of a crusty French loaf and cut it into 1” cubes and it was soooo good! It’s almost like a pineapple bread pudding. A family favorite.

Delicious!  I used brown sugar and pineapple tibits instead of crushed pineapple, otherwise no changes!  PERFECT!  Will definitely make many more times.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  EASY ALSO...I can see making this the day before and leaving in the refrig. to bake just before dinner.

W O W!!!  What a treat!  I was so very impressed with this recipe.  I've tried other pineapple bakes before, but this wins the highest prize.  I used the soft inside of a load of Italian bread and followed this recipe to the letter and it was amazing.  It was not too sweet; I loved the custard-y flavor; and the little bit of crunchiness on the top put me over the top.  Loved it!!

This is definitely a bread pudding which I love.  I used 6 slices of regular white bread (equals 4 cups cubed) which is what I always use to make bread pudding.  I will however put in only 1/4 cup of sugar next time since the pineapple juice made it a bit sweeter than I would've liked.  Great recipe!

Very nice, and definitely a bread pudding.  If you are wanting something else, go for a different recipe.  I like the pineapple in this--gives it a nice sweetness and flavor.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used a Christmas bread that my godparents send us every year for Christmas.  It's an eggy bread with candied fruit in it, so it was a good combo with the pineapple.  We had it for breakfast this morning with some whipped cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of those excellent never-fail recipes for a warm and flavorful side dish to any meal.  I definitely serve it on holidays but use it throughout the year also and depend on it to carry out to church dinners, neighborhood gatherings, etc.  It has served me well and is a family favorite.

This is definitely a bread pudding and so good. My husband and I ate half of it 
at one meal. Since I like bread puddings that are fluffy I added one more egg.

Kind of a bread pudding and pineapple desert dish.  Mildly sweet without being too sweet.  Good both warm and cold.

Loved this! I used a pkg of Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls in place of the regular bread cubes. Also added a little cinnamon. Yummy!! It's great warm or cold.

Wow, this FAR exceeded my expectations.  I don't even like pineapple, but had some leftover from a fruit salad so decided to try this.  I used about 2 cups of chopped fresh pineapple, using a little of the juice, and about 2/3 cup sugar.  So good when warm, with whipped cream on top, sprinkled with a little cinnamon.  Will cut back a little on the butter next time.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This.is.so.good.  I can't believe I've had this recipe for so long and haven't made it until today.  I used only 3 tbs. butter, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, used half white sugar/half brown sugar,  and topped with almonds and coconut during the last 10 minutes in the oven.  SO GOOD.

Yummy! I served it as a dessert (served warm with a scroop of vanilla ice cream).  My husband loved it.  I could have done with a little less butter, because it is a little too buttery for my taste (and the guilt that I felt eating it!).  It was perfect for a chilly rainy night!

I make this again & again because is so good & so easy.  I don't make any changes & it has never failed.  My husband likes it for dessert, topped with Cool Whip.  I prefer using King's Hawaiian bread as another reviewer mentioned, but when that's not available I use regular white bread or the thick sliced Texas toast.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Was looking for a bread pudding to use up some not-so-fresh bread.  This turned out very nice.  Reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown; added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Good by itself or topped with ice cream if you want something sweeter.  Thanks, Lynne.

No need to change anything! Tastes great :) I only had frozen bread so I was worried that instead of soft bread cubes I'd have toast cubes (I toasted the bread first of course), but it worked fine.

This is yummy - especially if you like pineapple! I made it exactly as the recipe states. Next time I will only use the half the amount of crushed pineapple and probably add a little cinnamon and sugar to the top after baking. My husband doesn't like a lot of pineapple (he told me tonight when I served this) but he said he liked it enough to eat it again with less pineapple. The name of the dish - Baked Pineapple is very appropriate! I liked it, although I think it needed a little cinnamon.

This was very good. Be careful what kind of bread you use for this, as the bread taste will be quite noticable. I used some hamburger buns that I needed to get rid of,(not the best choice). I also added a few nuts, and it really was more like bread pudding, which we love.

This was so yummy!  I made it as is except for the addition of 1/4 c coconut.  I agree with another reviewer that the butter could be reduced to 1/3, maybe even 1/4 c in this recipe.  It was well liked at a Thanksgiving potluck I took it to.  I will make this again!

I liked the flavor of this very much, but will be sure to 1. use 1/2 the butter called for, and 2. soften butter well, then add eggs and room temperature milk separately.

A nice change.

Really delicious.  I didn't change anything (although I think I could have put less butter without much impact).  Next time I will use less pineapple and a little more bread - although it tasted great as is, we like the sweet, buttery cooked bread part more than the many chunks of pineapple.

the recipe was okay never heard of bread pudding with pineapple in it. the top layer of the pudding was great but once you ate that away it was soggy and it was gross. adding cinamon on top of it improved the taste and it smelled wonderful while baking.... it's okay tasting if it's had a chance to cool down

I was looking to replicate a recipe I had been given by a friend, but unfortunately, have lost. This was very good causing my son and grandson to ask for seconds, but I didn't think it was quite as good as the missing recipe. Still very tasty, though.

This recipe is very good.  I had to bake it longer then what it said. I baked it till a knife inserted was clean. For the Pineapple I used my canned Mock Pineapple (2 cups) that is actually zucchini (tastes just like pineapple). I have that recipe listed on this site.  Since I have so much of the Mock Pineapple, I am looking pineapple recipes to use it up.  And this one is a keeper.

I love just about anything but this wasn't good at all.  It was like a bread pudding thing and it wasn't what I expected.  I won't be trying this again. Maybe I did something wrong but I did follow the recipe.
