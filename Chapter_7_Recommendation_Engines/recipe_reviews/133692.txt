I used this recipe for as a crust for a whole beef tenderloin and it was amazing!!!   I seared the roast first then coated with the ingredients and baked.  Fabulous blend of flavors!

Wonderful, tender and great flavor! The horseradish taste is very minimal, but the combination of all the ingredients makes a delicious taste overall.

This was great!  I prepped the steaks the night before and it was so easy to just throw in the oven the next day.    Steaks were tender and very flavorful.  Husband loved it! I used a roasting rack in a baking dish, but will try grilling these next time.

I thought after looking over the ingredients that this was going to turn out great.  I was wrong.  I think this is one of those "you either love it or hate it" recipes.  I rubbed the steaks and let them marinate then grilled them - the flavor combination left little to be desired.

So delicious for such a quick recipe!  The steaks came out wonderfully tender and the flavor is perfect after marinating overnight.  My husband loved them-- used wasabi b/c we had that (same difference).

Not really topped with, but infused with Horseradish and Dijon...  Found this to have good flavor. Next time I will top with the marinade that I've set aside just for this purpose... I did grill this rather than roast in the oven..., a beautiful piece of beef deserves more respect that hiding in an oven for 30 to 60 minutes... British / English style.  A good recipe when some cooking technique changes are applied to fit the American palate.

Did not enjoy, thought the spices were overpowering, i didnt have the tarragon so i didnt add it, but the other 2 spices were way overpowering, i wouldnt add that much at all, not even close to that much, horseradish and mustard was fine.  I was so dissapointed to ruin such an expensive pc of meat.

The sauce was great, but if I were to do this again, I'd still cook the steaks on the grill then top.

This was absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers recommended, I seared the meat first, then I covered it in the sauce and baked. So good!

Just finished eating this....take it or leave it?   Considering it is beef tenderloin I will leave it bc I want a fabulous recipe for this piece of meat.  It was just okay.  The only change I made to the recipe was to only use an 1/8 tsp of each of the dried herbs (bc of all the reviews stating the herbs were too overpowering). I am glad I did!! But, will continue my search for another recipe, but thanks for posting!
