The flavour and texture of the brownies was fantastic.  Word of advice though...do not over beat.  I did this and the tops formed a hard layer with basically a hole in the middle, then a nice soft brownie bottom.  Really weird.  Still tasted great!  I used "best white icing" from this website to decorate as mummies for Halloween as suggested by another user.  Received rave reviews.

holy cow, these are delish.  i didn't use the chips/toffee, as i was just looking for a plain brownie today, and i couldn't bring myself to undercook them as you recommend... but the bare, fully cooked brownies were absolutely out of this world!  thanks!

awesome.  I used 1.5 cups of Heath bar crumbs instead of the toffee and milk chocolate chips and they still tasted amazing.

Fabulous, wickedly good brownies!  The only change I made was using half the amount of chocolate chips at the end of the recipe.  It seemed like alot of chocolate already so I used 1 cup instead of 2.  Will make these again.

Fantastic recipe! The toffee makes this such a rich, dense brownie it was almost fudge-like!  I won serious "brownie" points with my husband, so thanks!

I probably should have figured out from the ingredients (namely that there are 4 eggs and more sugar than flour) that these would be on the gooey side.  These are not really a brownie in the traditional cake/bar sense.  They seemed a little loose and gritty.  They are SUPER sweet - I followed the recipe exactly except that as previously suggested, I only used half the chips the recipe called for.  I was a little disappointed that the toffee pieces could hardly be detected once cooked.

I'm glad to be the first to review this recipe.  They were delicious.  Some were a little too gooey for my taste, but everyone else in my house enjoyed them - especially warmed up with ice cream on top!  Very Rich!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly and the brownies came out really dry.  The toffee chips are completely lost in the chocolate flavor so you wouldn't even know they were added.  Very chocolaty though!

This recipe made a decent brownie but my toffee bits got lost in all the chocolate flavor (even though I skipped the chocolate chips altogether) so I was a bit disappointed overall.  I made a half recipe baked in an 8x8 pan.  I used almost a full cup of flour anyway as other reviewers had noted that the brownies were too gooey.  The texture came out fine, just that the flavor was not noticeably different than my regular brownie recipe.  I'll pass on these in the future.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried. I double the toffee pieces. Can use a 1/2 cup less sugar and their still delicious!

Yes, they are the best. They were heaven hot, they were divine warm and they were addictive cold. I under cooked them but I didn't care, it just became the best fudge.
