This has to be one of the best soups I've ever made. It has a great flavour, but I did find a pound of sausage to be too much. I will cut the meat down at least by half. I used fairly spicy italian sausage. I omitted the peppers and didn't have parmesan cheese. My husband has already asked for it again!

OH MY GOSH! This is the BEST soup! We all loved it, even the kids.... I made a couple of modifications, because of what I had on hand... instead of sausage, I used ground beef... instead of beef broth I used chicken... and omitted the red wine and instead added a tablespoon or so of Worchestershire sauce. YUMMY STUFF!

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed was using added beef broth for the water and only using a dash of wine.  My husband loved it and is taking the leftovers (I halved the recipe)for lunch tomorrow.  I'm jealous.  My toddler picked the tortellini and sausage out.  Next time I make it, I'll try fresh tortellini rather than frozen.  Thanks for a yummy dinner!

This soup has a wonderful flavor and is very satisfying. I'm impressed with the simplicity of the ingredients and preparation. Like others, I substituted paste for sauce and then made a few other modifications, like two small potatoes instead of zucchini, omitting the peppers and parsely, substituting 2 cups of rotini for the tortellini, and using 28 oz. of stewed tomatoes. Worked great! A very versatile recipe, Donna. Nice job.

WOW, WOW, WOW Never before has a recipe been so complete and adjustable at the same time!! This was great because you can follow the recipe or you can tweek it to fit your pantry/fridge and still get great results everytime!! I added celery and 1 red bell and 1 green instead of 2 greens. I used a bit of Prego chunky garden combo sauce and a can of tomato paste in place of the tomatoe sauce and added a bit more spice since I used italian turkey rather then pork and the results were amazing. I ate it for breakfast and dinner the next day. I just couldn't get enough!!! Many Thanks!!!

I thought this was a fabulous way to make Tortellini soup.  I left out the bell peppers (Contadina Stewed Tomatoes already had some in their cans and its not overpowering either) and swapped the Tomato sauce for Tomato Paste.  However, do not use too much.  In my opinion, I prefer the beef broth.  Add to much sauce/paste and it thickens into a pasta sauce, which is great too, but its not how I vision tortellini soup so i think keeping to the broth is best with all the additions!  Thanks Donna.  It tasted super delicious on the very first try!!!!!!!!!!!  Now that's what I call a really good recipe!

Excellent Soup, Very Hearty
I used hot Italian sausage and tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  My family loved it.

We don't eat meat so I substituted Boca Italian sausage (4 links) and used a little olive oil. Also used a veggie broth instead of beef and it was OUTSTANDING!! Great for a cold winter evening!

THE BEST ... I made this soup with Thanksgiving Dinner. My family, even the kids, couldn't stop raving about it. To make it more like a soup, rather than a stew, I added 4 more cups of beef broth. I substituted frozen red & green bagged peppers for the fresh green peppers. I made it the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to let the flavors blend. I had a bowl for Wednesday's lunch. It was delicious. I will absolutely make this again... Thanks Donna

I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL. However, I made a few alterations. Instead of Italian sausage, I used 4 links of HOT Jennie-O Turkey Italian Sausage (prepared the same way) and used 4 cups of Swanson Low Sodium Chicken Broth, with a whole cup of water, and I did not use wine. I found Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes that were wonderful, and I used about a half a cup mixed green, red, and yellow peppers that I purchased pre-cut at the grocery. For the Tortellini I used a spinach with cheese kind that was fresh (not frozen or dried). This was so easy to make and it made a TON! Will make again!

I think this is one of the best soups I've ever tasted. I've made it three times now and it has been a hit each time. I play around with the veggies depending on what I have (sometimes add squash in addition to zucchini or different color bell peppers). One recommendation to those who have stated this soup can be oily: drain the sausage well after cooking. This last time I even wrapped the meat in paper towels to remove more grease. Enjoy this wonderful soup!

A friend brought this soup to one of our church small group get togethers and it was WONDERFUL! She used chicken broth, so I followed suit and did the same. I also couldn't find frozen zucchini anywhere and it is not currently in season so I used a frozen Italian veg mix that has carrots, zucchini, and red peppers...all of which are in the soup anyway and it saved me prep time! Score. :) Good stuff!

Great recipe.  I used turkey Italian sausage and added some pepper and cayenne pepper to add some spice.  Added some fresh baby spinach leaves during the last 25 mins and it turned out excellent.  Next time I'll try the hot Italian sausage.

The tortellini was weird, my boyfriend took it out when he ate the soup.  The soup was very oily and despite the vegetables, it felt so unhealthy.

Delicious! Used chicken sausage instead of pork sausage and shredded my carrots instead of sliced. Used a fresh cheese tortellini which cooked in just a few minutes in this soup which I added at the end. Served with red hot pepper flakes and grated pecorino romano on top. Also served with a crusty ciabatta bread. So good!

This really is delicious.  I used the hot italian sausage and I didn't think it was too hot.  I didn't have carrots so I used a sweet potato cubed up.  I also had only chicken broth.  Two cans of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and onion already in the can.  My package of fresh tortellini was bigger than called for so my only mistake was not having enough liquid.  Next time will use more broth.  It was great!

Hearty, flavorful, healthy...  One of those soups that "hits the spot".  My family loves this!  Fabulous recipe as written, but after making this many times, I make a few changes that are purely personal preference.  I leave out the water and use 3 cups beef and 3 cups vegetable broth, chop up the stewed tomatoes so there aren't huge chunks (or my kids would never eat it), *julienne* carrots (really does something for the texture), double the zucchini, and omit the bell peppers or halve the amount (too bitter for my liking, I guess), and I like to add a can of kidney beans (drained & rinsed).  Fantastic paired with garlic bread sticks!

After experimenting with a few Tortellini Soup recipes, this is the one I will now go to. Using the stewed tomatoes are much easier than peeling and chopping fresh ones. The 2 green peppers added a good heartiness to the soup as well.

Amazing. My husband and I loved it. I did not have enough beef broth so I used some chicken broth to complete the recipe. We will definitely be making this again! Great way to use frozen tortellini!

O...M...G!!  Five stars to the max man.  Me and the hubby have been counting calories for a while now and so I was excited to try this soup since I've missed eating pasta/Italian food.  Unfortunately Italian food is SUPER high calorie : (.  Either way, I made it tonight and let me tell you, it lived up to every bit of it's rating.  My husband had two bowls and I would have too if I had the leftover calories for it.  The only thing I did differently was to add more veggies and tortellini since I like a super chunky soup. I also used water and beef bouillon cubes instead of liquid beef stock...it didn't make any difference at all though.  Yum!  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe! I used ground beef instead of Italian sausage and everyone in the family LOVED it! There's no leftovers!

A good hearty soup that got a thumbs up from the whole family. I thought I had sausage in the freezer and found I didn't, so put some chopped salami in instead. I served it 'as is' to the kids and added a little sea salt, pepper and Tabasco Sauce to mine ;)

Soup was fantastic! I've never tried a soup like this before so I was unsure if my family would like it. They did! I used hot Italian sausage, and tomato paste. Gave it great flavor and a little bit of a thicker texture. Loved it topped with the Parmesan cheese! I will defiantly make it again!!

I actually liked this dish very much.  It was simple and tasty.  The rest of my family did not.  I did add some left over mushrooms and yellow squash that I had in the refrigerator and stiill thought it was delicious.

very delicious soup! I made it exactly per the directions and it was amazing. I used a pound of spicy italian chicken sausage (it was on sale at the local Sprouts) and used 5 tsps of "it's better than bouillon" paste + 5 cups of water to substitute the beef broth. I was actually surprised by how flavorful it was. wonderful winter soup, definitely would recommend it!

This was great! I used smoked turkey sausage, chicken broth instead of beef, added 1 cup chopped celery, 2 T. tomato paste and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Sauteed all veggies in oil, then added tomatoes, broth, tomato paste, pasta & simmered.We loved it. To make it quicker, I plan to cut all veg up & place in one freezer bag. probably wld be good w/orzo pasta too.

We had this with our lasagna dinner last night and the kids loved it.  I deleted the red wine, sausage, and increased the flavor by adding pre sauted browned onions.  I also omitted the tortellini and added acini de pepe.  I also think the kids liked it better.

I made this recipe for a sick friend and it went over very well.  I used ground turkey instead of sausage and yellow pepper instead of green.  I used three cheese Buitoni tortellini and added it to the pot about a half hour before serving.  Awesome

This soup is great!  I used soy sausage crumbles rather than Italian sausage.  My boyfriend did not realize it was imitation sausage until he was halfway through the bowl.  I also substituted chicken broth for beef broth and I did not add any water.

DELISH! It turned out to be more like a stew than a soup, which was just fine! The sausage gave it really intense flavor and the aroma filled the house. My husband loved it! We had enough for 2 nights plus a light lunch. I served a French Dip sandwich with it on the second night. Very filling and very good!

This soup was a hit at our house.  My husband said that it may be the best soup he's ever eaten.  Even my soup-phobic teenage son gave it a thumbs up.  I omitted the bell peppers and parsley.  It served our family of five and we still had three bowls worth of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Yum!  Can't wait to have it again.

We all loved the soup.  The flavor was excellant.  It really did not take that long to prepare and not that long to cook. I E-mailed it to a friend.
Since there is only 2 of us I put the remaining soup in the freezer for, I don't feel like cooking night!

My family, including my finicky 2-year-old, loved this soup! I had to substitute tortelli with rotini noodles due to a milk allergy, but it still turned out delicious. Perfect for a cold day!

I feel like I can properly review this now that I've have tasted the leftovers.  Delicious!  A great way to get a big vegetable serving in your diet.  I really drained the sausage well, and cooked the onion/garlic in a non stick pan so I didn't have any grease in the soup.  Very good.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions:  I never measure exactly, red and yellow bell pepper, and no red wine or parsley.  Highly recommend you try this hearty soup.  I had it with and without parmesean - both good.  Paired perfectly with a fresh multigrain bread from the bakery.  Enjoy a bowl for youself.

AMAZING base recipe!  I doubled parts of the recipe to load it up with lots of veggies and cooked it all in my Dutch oven. I omitted the water and bell pepper. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of pork. I sautéed 4 cloves of minced garlic (we love garlic) with the onion.  I added 5 cans of beef broth along with broccoli that needed to be used, carrots, one 12oz can of Hunts whole tomatoes (used kitchen shears to cut them up), one can of fire roasted diced tomatoes,  one small can of garlic tomato sauce, added the herbs, and simmered it in the Dutch oven uncovered for 30 min.  I then added a package (8oz) of spinach tortellini and a package (8oz) of prosciutto tortellini, diced up one zucchini and two squash. I also sautéed up diced crimini mushrooms and added with the tortellini. Lastly, I substituted dry sherry for red wine (didn’t have any red wine).  As the day went on I continued to add cans of beef broth to accompany all the yummy veggies.  The juice was one of the best parts of this stew! My husband raved this was the best stew he has ever had…. I must agree. It will become a staple in our household.

I've made this so many times and it's unbelievably good. I've taken leftovers to work (it makes a LOT) and my coworkers are always happy :-) I don't change a thing...it's great as is!  edit...I fibbed a little! I forgot that I've tried this using turkey italian sausage and it's still delicious, flavorful and a hair lighter in fat

Wonderful flavor!  I used 1 lb. hot sausauge- very good, and an additional can of crushed tomatoes, a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce & stewed tomatoes.  I only used 1 large green pepper and it seemed enough for my tastes.  I also used dry tortellini and cooked it only half the time reccommended on the packaging.  Even better the next day!!!  Will definately make this again!

5 stars all the way! I bought the ingredients last night to prepare for cooking club at my house today and my husband couldn't wait! I had to make it last night for dinner and he said "This is the best soup I've ever had" All of the moms at cooking club today loved it and so did the kids! I used turkey saus. and changed the bell pepper to red and it was great! A new household favorite!

I have been making this soup for several years now.  It is great.  Everyone loves it.  Even have used it at catering jobs.
We have it on Christmas Eve every year.
Sometimes I leave the Tortellini on the side so it is less carbs.

I have made this soup twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly.When I made it Halloween night I added another pound of hot Italian sausage and used two cans of diced tomatoes with chili peppers, used red and green peppers and added summer squash to the mix. Instead of tortellini, I used spinach ricotta ravioli.I also added the rind off of parmesean cheese chunk as I had seen that on the Food Network. You remove the rind when the soup is done. This an enormous amount of delicious soup.Parents of my trick or treaters were asking what the aroma was and even asked to try it. I ended up having to print off several copies. My husband loves this soup. I served it with an spinsch garlic artisan bread from When Pigs Fly Bakery the first time and had leftover cheddar garlic biscuits the second time. This is a keeper for sure.

AMAZING!!!  I made it for our family Sunday dinner.  I love how pretty it was.  My husband LOVED it.  He wanted more sausage...but I think that is just a guy thing.  I added some yellow squash for even more color.  It tasted great.  I almost think I would rather use only yellow squash.  The only think I would suggest doing differently is cooking it less at the end.  My zucchini and squash got very mushy. I will definitely make this again!!!

Easy and delicious soup, many different variations can be made and I'll make again with different veggies I have around.  I thought the wine really added a lot of flavor, don't skip it!

I've streamlined the recipe a bit to cut down on dishes and ingredients.  I brown the sausage in the pot with a little olive oil, 2 Tbsp rehydrated minced onion and 1 tsp jarred minced garlic.  When the meat is done, I pour one large can of beef broth over the undrained meat and skip the water and red wine.  The rest of the recipe I use as is, sometimes adding chopped spinach or arugala in place of the parsley.  This soup is always a hit at our house.

This soup was delicious. I happened to have everything on hand that I needed when I found it except the tortellini (which is clearly an important ingredient). I substituted bow-tie pasta, which worked just fine. I cooked it separately, and then added it in while the zucchini and bell peppers cooked. My little ones loved this soup! I think they ate the pasta mostly, but they definitely ate some of the rest too. Yum. I will make this again!

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I love it!  I used a bit more beef broth just to make it more brothy and I used fresh basil instead of dried basil but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and is is great.  Full of flavor and depth - very hearty and satisfying.  I will definitely make this again!

When I first made this, I was a little leary, because I wasn't sure my family (especially the kids) would like it given the ingredients.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was actually wonderful.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was actually pretty greasy.  If I could find a lower fat sausage or a turkey sausage, I think I might like it better.  I cut up the veggies the night before, so when I got home from work all I had to do was brown the sausage and throw everything else together and let it simmer.

This soup was incredible! I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and added extra tomatoes and zucchini.  The flavor of the spicy Italian sausage was amazing.  This is the best soup I've ever made! (Jamie's Minestrone on this site is the second best!)

The broth of this soup was really good; it had a great flavor. However, the vegetables were not tender enough. I have a gas stove and letting the green pepper and zucchini simmmer for 45 minutes (I used frozen tortellini) was not enough time. Next time I will sautee the carrots, peppers, and zucchini at the beginning with the onions and garlic and then let the recipe simmer for 30 minutes before adding the tortellini. Also, my husband was not a huge fan of tortellini being in a soup. I liked it though.

Delicious! Here are the changes I made: I omitted the red wine, carrots and green peppers. I doubled the tortellini (frozen) and used italian style diced tomatoes instead of stewed. As others suggested, I used tomato paste instead of sauce. All in all, it was absolutely wonderful and my husband raved! It's definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  I made it with Hot Italian sausage and I didn't have any red wine, so I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a few dashes of red pepper flakes.  Next time I make it, I'm going to leave out the sausage but that's because we aren't really big fans of Italian sausage.

Only needs one green pepper. I used 4 cups beef broth and 1 cup veg broth I had in freezer. Also used whole wheat tortellini to make it healthier.

Wow! This is so good! I just finished my second bowl! I was skeptical, even with all the rave reviews.  I started losing hope while making it, especially since I accidentally mixed up the order in the cooking and varied my cooking time.  However, still a major success! This will undoubtedly be a reran recipe for years to come! Thanks so much!

I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful.  My whole family gobbled it up!  But, this is certainly the type of soup recipe that you could clean out your fridge with.  Just throw all those extra veggies in...it was delicious!

Added carrots, fresh green beans, used canned tomatos, it was tasty and delicious. Too lazy to add wine, dumped all the veggies in at once at the start. Really good!

Wonderful flavor, but I found it to be too thick, more like stew. The Tortellini seems to take up quite a bit of the broth. I used 2 cups of beef broth and two cups of chicken broth, plus a cup of water to make up the difference in the total of 5 cups broth.  Next time I will add an additional cup or more of water as I found the broth to be plenty rich. I only used a half of a bell pepper, and since I had green beans in my garden, I added some of them. It could use more carrots. Will definitely make again.....

I'm not a fan of green pepper and I loved this. Fantastic flavor. I omitted pasta, as it was plenty hearty enough without, and I used 50/50 sweet and hot sausage.

Fantastic!  My daughter told me about this, so we had to try it.  I only used about 1/2 a green pepper, no wine or water, and 2 boxes of Swanson beef broth.  I didn't have any dried oregano so I put in a pinch of ground oregano.  I honestly don't think you can mess up this recipe.  My husband is not a fan of either tortellini or green pepper, and he loved it!!!

This is a very satisfying and hearty soup.  The only change that I made was to use hot italian sausage for added flavor, I think that I could have used 1/2 lb instead of a full lb of sausage though.  There is quite a bit of sausage in this soup.  This is really nice for a change of pace for lunch, with the tortellini and sausage it is definitely filling enough.

This soup is awesome. I have been making it for about 5 years and my family requests it often. I use onion and garlic powder in place of the onion and garlic cloves and omit the bell pepper and it still tastes fantastic. I put mozzarella cheese on the top and we have french bread too!! YUMMY :)

Amazing soup! And incredibly easy too. I added more tortellini and beef broth so there would be more of what the kids would eat. I also added more zucchini and omitted the bell peppers. The flavors in the soup complemented eachother beautifully, I think this is the best soup I've ever made. Served with a little mozzarella and some warm white bread rolls. It was very filling and perfect for a chilly night.

This is great! I guess it was more of an inspiration b/c I used so many different things but the base was the same. I still used the tortellini, sausage and spices but needed to get rid of a veggie tray from a party and it worked great! I used broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes and carrots. Also added my own onions, garlic and green beans. Wonderful!

I used turkey sausage and water instead of beef broth as my boyfriend does not eat beef or pork. I added red beans instead of zucchini because I just don't like it. ;p I threw it all in the crockpot ! I served it with garlic bread and sparkling red grape juice. with blueberry crepes as dessert.

Fantastic, flavorful recipe! I made some changes though. I don't like Italian Sausage, so I just used ground beef. I also added kidney beans near the end of the last simmering step, which were great. I would simmer the zucchini for a bit less time, as mine turned out a bit too soft for me. I also added a bit more water at the end, since mine was lacking that!

I tinkered with this recipe (a lot), and it still turned out great!  I left out the zucchini, the wine, and the basil and added red pepper flakes.  I'm also pretty sure I didn't use the right kind of sausage, because mine didn't crumble as the directions described, but it was still very good.  I would definitely make this again and add spinach on top.  Yum!

We love this soup! Substitute uncased turkey sausage for pork for a lighter meal. Also, use a good quality tortellini. I made with a dried brand (not-so-good) and with refrigerated fresh (so-so-good).....the best ingredients make such a difference!

I thought this was terrific, but my husband thought it was just okay.  Thus, the four stars.  Only change I made to the recipe was to use roasted red pepper from a jar instead of green bell pepper, because it was all I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making it again.

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!  MY HUSBAND RAVES OVER IT.  I DID MAKE CHANGES TO MAKE IT A LITTLE HEALTHIER.  I USE LOW SODIUM BROTH AND TURKEY SAUSAGE.  MY HUSBAND HATES TOMATOES SO I USE A CAN OF PURIED TOMATOES INSTEAD.  IT IS GREAT AS IS, BUT WHEN I DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING ON HAND, I'VE MADE SUBSITUITIONS AND IT ALWAYS COMES OUT GREAT AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THE BASE THE SAME (SPICES/BROTH).

Great, satisfying recipe!!  I cooked the soup the night before I served it, and if I did it again, I would add the tortellini the day I served it.  The pasta absorbed a lot of the liquid from the soup.

This soup is excellent. My family was impressed!  The only thing I did differently was to omit the bell peppers and I added frozen spinach.  I came out wonderfull.  Thanks Donna.

Fantastic soup and very open to experimentation. I used turkey sausage and wasn't worried about grease so I just dumped the onions and garlic in with it. No straining at all. I also didn't skin the sausage, just chopped it up finely. A lot less work that way. I used canned carrots, so I didn't do the first 30mins of simmering, just dumped all the ingredients into the pot and simmered for 45mins. I didn't have tortellini, so I used a bag of cheese ravioli. I cut up regular tomatoes instead of stewed. I only had 2Tbs of parsley left. If I made it again, I think I would still only use 2Tbs. I'm worried the parsley might be overpowering with 3. The whole soup turned out fantastic. The broth is delicious.

Wow. Great soup.
Made a couple changes for personal preferences that came out excellent.
First I used Bulk Hot Sausage instead of the Italian style. Spice was just right.
Left out the Peppers as my wife can't stand the taste of them. I also used Frozen tortellini. Great recipe.

This was delicious! I used bulk hot italian sausage from the grocery store butcher and it wasn't too spicy - just right. I also wilted some fresh spinach I had on hand just after the onions and garlic were cooking. Very good!

This soup is very flavorful! I added extra broth extra zucchini, and extra tortellini, and it came out more of a stew because of it, but that was a good thing, as it was my main dish. It was so yummy! I will surely be making it again and again, as a stew AND a soup!

This soup is awesome.  I'm not a soup person but I made it for my husband who practically licked the bowl clean.  My 12 year old son who doesn't like soup loved it.  My 1 year old twin girls loved it as well.  Everyone had more the next day at lunch.
I didn't have the green peppers or zucchini so I doubled the tortellini.  I will add 2 or 3 more cups of broth next time though.  But this was such a wonderful recipe!!!

I loved this recipe! I would definitely add more broth, as it became more like a stew after it was cooked. And I will use fresh tortellini, the frozen was tasteless. IT makes a very large pot of soup.

I made this soup last night and to say we were licking our bowls would be an understatement!  I included garlic bread and the duo created a full meal.  The soup is very savory and filling.  Most of the flavor comes from the italian sausage so make sure you get the best possible.  Definitely making again this winter/fall season!

This was the first soup I've ever made, and it came out great!  It was very flavorful.  I used spinach instead of zucchini and also added four cups of extra broth to make it 'soupier'.   A definate keeper!

A PERFECT 10!!  Even though I had to make some minor changes, due to ingredients I had, my husband and I thought this was THE BEST!!  I used 10 oz. frozen spinach, thawed and drained since I had no zucchini.  I omitted green pepper and used 6 oz. tomato paste in place of the tom. sauce.  I added extra beef broth (about 4 extra cups) to make it more soupy...it was SOOO GOOD!  Even my 1 year old ate it!  I'm sure it's great exactly as it is, but if you have to make changes, know it will still be fabulous!!  Thanks Donna...a menu regular now!!

My husband claims that he likes this soup a lot but when he LOVES a meal he'll eat the leftovers the next day.  He doesn't eat the leftovers with this soup.  He thinks the meat should be stewed beef rather than sausage.  I may try it.

This soup is fabulous! I've made it twice and frozen it in individual servings. The taste is great. When I went to get the ingredients the first time I made it, the store only had 1/3 pound of sausage left, so that's what I used. I thought it was just the right amount for flavor. The second time I used 1/2 pound and it was a bit more than I liked. Either way, though, it is a great soup.

Sooo good!!! This was just the recipe I was looking for! Didn’t have Italian sausage so used ground beef and added Italian seasoning while I browned it. Also added an entire 19oz bag of frozen tortellini (and only simmered for about 15-20 minutes after adding it). Omitted the green pepper cause have a little one who hate them. Was delicious!!!

Not even my typical style of soup but this is delicious! I added extra zucchini and a ton of baby spinach. I also used a pre-diced container of celery, onion, and carrots. I don't usually rate recipes but this one is a keeper!

So I absolutely adore this recipe. I think overall it turned out really good. I substituted the tortellini out for bowtie pasta since that's all I could find and I'd say it didn't make a real difference. One thing I'd look out for with this recipe is the SALT. The beef broth I used had 37% of your sodium intake (and that's only four cups). That, mixed with the other canned goods made the soup a bit salty. I added about a cup or so more water than required and a little bit of sugar to offset the saltiness. I'd make this again if I had the ingredients on hand for sure though.

I unfortunately had to alter the recipe a bit because all I had was the packaged herbed chicken tortellini. So I omitted the sausage. I used all of the other ingredients and it turned out to be an absolute hit!!!

This is really yummy.  I also added Italian seasoning and fennel seed, because I love it.  Also added peas and celery, no peppers or zucchini, don't like those.  Delicious!  I also put some Italian croutons as a garnish.

My family makes a variant of this soup all the time. It's been a star of my Christmas open house for the last 5 or 6 years.  We use mild/sweet turkey sausage and leave out the green pepper and parsley.  I always am generous with the carrots, wine, and zucchini too.  It also freezes terrifically well - make a big pot and eat it over the next few months.

This was a good hearty soup filled with yummy vegetables. I personally don't enjoy green peppers in soup, but I had some to use up so I kept it in.  Followed the recipe except for the wine, and used tomato paste instead of sauce.  I pre-made this for our camping trip and I think it will be a welcome warm and filling soup heated up for lunch.

Boys hate tomatoes...so I left out the stewed tomatoes and sauce. Left out peppers too. I left everything else the same and added some Worcester sauce.  All my kids ate it happily. Hubby and extremely picky kids voted it onto the "make it again list". Yay!

I used chicken sausage and homemade bone broth. I didn't use canned tomatoes or tomato sauce, rather 1/2 can Tom paste per another reviewer. I omitted green peppers because I don't care for them in soup. I also used fresh tortellini and I think that made the difference. Will make again!

I use 1 polish kielbasa in place of Italian sausage and nix the wine. Oh MY is it good! It reminds me of my grandpa's Hungarian goulash, but in soup form. You get better flavor if you use fresh herbs. DELICIOUS!

Easy, and delicious.  I skipped the sausage part, since my tortellini had beef.  Sautéed the onions and garlic in bacon fat, and followed the other steps.  Served it with cheese biscuits.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe. I made a few changes though. I left out the wine and water and instead added an extra cup of beef broth. I also used Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes. Instead of bell peppers, I had  some whole green beans leftover from dinner the night before and tossed those in during the last  25 minutes. This turned out to be a rich and hearty soup. Yummy!

Very good flavor, although tortellini, zuccini and peppers would have been very overcooked if simmered for 45 minutes as written.  A better process would be to cook the tortellini separately and combine just before serving, and cook vegetables only until crisp-tender.  If you do cook the pasta in the soup, you should cook it no more than the time listed on the package (in my case, only 12 - 15 minutes).

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  This is now my all-time favorite soup.  I substituted ground beef for the sausage and did not add the wine.  I try to take as much work out of cooking as I can, so most of my veggies came out of the pre-chopped section in produce (including matchstick carrots).  It comes out to about 106 calories per cup of soup (makes about 17.5 cups).

Absolutely loved it!!  Very easy to make (a lot of chopping, but that's OK) and extremely tasty.  I used a mild italian sausage b/c I feel it has enough kick to it than the medium.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband really liked it.  Definitely a keeper from here on out!

I'm ashamed to say this is only my 2nd review on this site (because I'm on here every single day) but I had to let you know that this is an amazing meal.  I made it tonight for dinner for 4 adults and there only 1 1/2 servings left that will definitely be gone by tomorrow!  Trying to eat healthy since it's the new year and even my husband who is a very "meat and potatoes" guy, absolutely LOVED it.  All of the guys went back for a second serving.  Served it with a sliced baguette rubbed with a little olive oil, toasted, then rubbed with a sliced piece of fresh garlic, to soak up the soup. DELICIOUS!!!!

Excellent! I used 2 boxes (32 oz each) of the beef broth with 3/4 cup red wine. I added celery and omitted the bells. I also did it all in one pot. I started to cook the ground pork and when it was 1/2 cooked, I added the onion, celery and garlic. When it was ready, I followed the recipe. I like more tortellini, so that is why I added extra broth. I used 2 cups of uncooked torellini. Excellent recipe! The whole family, including the kids, love it!

A+++++, we love this recipe at our house. I followed it exactly and added some frozen spinach, too. It is hearty, healthy and perfect for a cold night. This hit the spot and it makes plenty for leftovers the next day, and it tastes even better the next day. Thank you, thank you for this recipe!

This is definitely a keeper!  Even without the zucchini it made a delicious soup.  My husband loved it.  I used frozen tortellini and it turned out great.  No modifications were needed.  Wonderful!

I tweaked this a bit. I used homemade chicken broth and omitted wine and used a combination of red, yellow and orange peppers. Those were the ingredients I had on hand. I also doubled the recipe and added a bit more tomatoe sauce and broth. My husband and I really liked, but the kids didn't like the chunky vegies. (I had pureed some vegies in the chciken broth already - sneaky way to get kids to eat vegies!)I would definitely make for a potluck or family gathering. I was able to freeze two containers. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a great base recipe for tortellini soup! Since I'm a vegetarian I omitted the sausage and cooked the onions and garlic in olive oil.  I also used vegetable stock instead of beef, I added a stalk of celery along with the carrots and some frozen spinach with the zucchini.
It came out delicious!

I made quite a few changes which always negates the rating, but we loved it non the less.  Only used 3 cups of beef broth and the rest water to help cut down on the sodium.  Didn't have any zucchini, but sliced up fresh mushrooms and added those.  Will make again soon!

I am giving this 4 stars, but my husband gives it a 5+.  I sauted the onions, garlic, carrots and green peppers with the fried turkey Italian sausage.  Used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of stewed then simmered uncovered for about an hour until it was reduced.  I then covered the pot and simmered an additional 3 hours so the flavors would develop into a rich stock.  Added zucchini, parsley and tortellini at the end.  Very rich and filling.

This is DELICIOUS! I made this for several different groups of people, women groups, family groups, couples groups...everyone raves about this soup. The only ones that don't like it seem to be little kids. I have made this with or without the wine, and it doesn't seem to matter. Great soup with tons of flavor. It's hearty, filling, and satisfying as a winter meal with some crusty bread along side it.  I only left out the peppers, didn't miss them.

This is awesome-one of our favorite soups.  It is hearty enough for a main course with a salad and fresh bread.

I made this soup a few months ago and it was delicious. I had a lot left over and froze it. We had it for lunch today and it tasted just as good, if not better!! I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe more as a guideline than anything else.  I used smoked sausage instead of Italian, doubled the carrots, zucchini, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce, and used only one bell pepper.  However, it turned out to be delicious, and I will be making it again, perhaps with the Italian sausage if I have it on hand.
