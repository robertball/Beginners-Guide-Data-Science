This filling is delicious!  I bake custom wedding cakes and my brides adore this filling in French vanilla or lemon cakes.  I do call it "Citrus Filling" instead of lemon, though.  I think it has a little too much orange flavor to call it lemon.  Forget the cake...I could just eat the filling with a spoon!!!

Great recipe and will make again but with one exception. I will use only the yolk of the egg without the white as the white wanted to curdle a bit. Adding an extra yolk, I think this icing will thicken up more, which it needs. Could eat the icing alone for it is fantastic!!! Can't wait for all to enjoy on Father's Day!

I read the other reviews and changed the lemon to orange ratio just a bit.  Instead of 1/2 cup of OJ, I did 1/4 cup of OJ and 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I also took another readers suggestion and substituted the one egg, for two egg yolks instead.  This turned out AMAZING!!!  I made a vanilla cake for my daughter's first birthday and this was the perfect filling!!!

Very nice filling-- I thought it was much better served very cold (as in, leftovers after the cake had been stored in the fridge).  I think if I make it again, I'll omit the whipped cream-- I liked the thicker, gel consistancy of the plain filling.

I brought a cake with this filling inside to a restaurant where we were having 
a birthday party and the chef and owner tasted it and I had to give
him the recipe. Everyone loved it. I make it all the time now for
special cakes.

Would definitely call this an "orange filling". I was a little disappointed. It seemed more fluffy than a cake filling should be, and the cake was wobbly with this filling inside, which made it more difficult to ice, a little too sweet as well. I probably will not use this again.

This filling is great! I use it every time I make a yellow cake, and I have no problem with it going out the sides of the cake. A trick I use is to make a "barrier" around the edge of the bottom layer with butter cream, and only put filling in to the edge of the butter cream ring, not over. Happy Baking! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great filling. I used it with the Creamy White Layers cake and the Special Buttercream Frosting recipes from this website. It is not overly tart and it was easy to use and didn't ooze out when I put the top layer on and frosted the remainder of the cake.  I used lemon zest instead of orange zest because I didn't have an orange handy and it still tasted great.

It is good but it takes quite a while to thicken. Tastes more like citrus than lemon.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was, as many others said, more a orange filling than lemon. I tasted no lemon whatsoever when I tried it, and followed this recipe exactly. It was far more runny than it should have been, and made WAY more "filling" than it said it would. I probably could have iced my whole 2 layer lemon cake with it. The instructions were vague-- cook until thick? HOW thick is thick, and white sugar? Granulated or powdered? I am definitely NEVER using this recipe again. It literally ruined my cake.

This got great reviews from our guests. I didn't have whipped cream so I used dream whip. It made it a bit sweeter but it still tasted great. Thanks.

Loved this filling!  I substitured half of the lemon juice w/more OJ and added a little more zest.  In restrospect, I didn't let the filling cook long enough (wasn't sure how thick was "thick").  I thought it'd maybe thicken up as it cooled so I only cooked it until it was a little thicker than coating the back of my spoon.  Will cook longer next time.  

I used it in a vanilla tube-pan cake.  I created a valley in the cake and used this to fill it up.  Taste was great!

Great recipe. I was looking for a spring time recipe for my easter party and found this. I used it with a white cake mix and lemon icing that Carol submitted as "lemon icing" and baked it in a 9x13 pan and sliced it in half. The flavors worked together perfectly.  It was a hit with the whole family.

This was so delicious! The only change I made was to replace the egg with two egg yolks. I used this as a filling on a vanilla cake. I look forward to making this one again soon!

This is easy to make however I agree that there is to much orange flavor for this to be called Lemon filling. Next time I will use 1/2 cup lemon juice and maybe just 2 tablespoons of orange juice. Good flavor just not lemony!

This is a delicious cake filling!  It's something a little different.  I didn't measure the whipping cream, but I used less than a cup so that the curd-like filling came through more.

This is a very tasty recipe!  I used it as a topping for crepes.  I halved the recipe, used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh, and used only the egg white.  I couldn't let it cool completely, but mixed it with the whipped cream anyway.  Very delicious!  I'll definitely be making it again.

This was a very tasty filling. I used it in an Easter cake which had a strawberry cake layer and two confetti cake layers. I used this filling in between one layer and a stawberry filling in between the other layer. I frosted the cake with Special Buttercream Frosting from this site. It turned out really nicely. Very nice for spring time because it's not heavy at all. Not a crumb was left over. I also think it would be nice with angel food cake. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake to bring to Easter dinner. I left out the orange zest, reduced the orange juice, and increased the lemon juice to a 1/4 cup. It came out perfect! Tangy but not overly so...  I made a yellow butter cake and topped it with this and strawberries. It was a great hit!

I made it as stated in my first batch, and then read how some people thought it was a bit more of an orangey filling more than lemon. I went out to sneak a taste and sure enough, the lemon taste was faint. Also, as the egg cooked up, some of the whites curdled and were blobby white in the mix.  I re-made the recipe with lemon zest instead of orange zest. I also put 1/4 cup of orange juice and and the other half put in extra lemon juice (plus the additional 2 tablespoons). I put in just the egg yolk. Result is much more lemony, but it's a not quite as thick. I think it will still work out pretty well.

I followed someone's advice and used two egg yolks and divided the lemon and orange zest and juice in halves. It is heavenly. I also made my own whipped cream and whipped it until it is stiff peaks, then cooled it and then folded it with the citrus. I dressed a 'yellow' cake with one layer between cake layers and topped it, followed by fresh fruits. Lovely.

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  I did take some other reviewers advice and use 2 egg yolks and 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup O.J.  I also added 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  After those substitutions, it is definitely lemon filling instead of citrus and is amazing!

this was a pain to make. despite having it on low-medium heat the egg started to curdle... it was really gross, esp with the zest clumping too. i eventually ran it through a sieve and worked off of that. mixing it with the whipped cream (homemade) defeated the purpose of me whipping the cream in the first place. this concoction is now in the freezer, im hoping it will become more workable. the flavor is pretty good but this specific recipe needs too many changes for me to give it anything above 2.

Delicious!  Light and refreshing and very easy to make.  I coupled this with the lemon cream cheese frosting and a lemon cake-- just great.  Thanks.

This is so good!  I used it to fill Erica's "Glorious Sponge Cake," and it was perfect.  I could have eaten the filling by itself.  All of it.  :)  It has the truest lemon flavor of any lemon dessert I've ever made.

Although this filling was light and tasty, there were some problems.  I ended up with about twice the filling needed for my layer cake.  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a cake that fell apart because the filling was just too wet- it was more like runny pudding.  Alone, the filing seemed good, but it did not pair well with my 'Betty Crocker' lemon cake.  It made the cake way too sweet (not something that I usually have a problem with since I love sweet stuff!)  Finally, I decided to go with canned icing (Betty Crocker homestyle lemon), which tasted REALLY bad with this filling.  Some of the icing actually fell off around the edge because the filling was just too moist.  A better suggestion- my left over filling made a great fruit dip!

It had been a long time since I didn't make a cake and I have to say this was a really simple one, just the juice of half lemon. Well, with this filling the cake is great! My sister loves it!! Really easy and tasty! Thanks!

I've made this twice, and liked it both times.  I agree with others that it's better without the egg white - yolk only if you want to avoid the curdling, which is gross.  I also subbed lemon juice for the orange juice because I wanted a lemon flavor.

This was more of a citrus mousse than lemon, but it turned out amazing!  I used a cara cara orange for the zest then squeezed the juice out. I supplemented the rest with OJ to get the 1/2 cup. I also made my own whipped cream. I will definitely make this again. It was super easy and tasted light and delicious as a cake filling.

Delicious. I was going to serve with peaches, so I substituted peach juice for orange juice- yum!! Use a little less lemon juice and more whipped topping to get great flavor and fluffier.

This was lovely and citrusy without being too tangy, a reason I tend not to love lemon fillings.  It worked very nicely with a yellow cake and Swiss meringue buttercream without clashing with their sweetness.  I did use two egg yolks instead of the whole egg, as recommended by previous reviewers.  If a truer lemon filling is desired, lemon zest could be substituted for the orange and the OJ reduced or substituted entirely (probably with water).

i thought this filling was very good. It was slightly too runny but that might have been my fault. I may not have let the lemon mixture cool long enough. i would try it again because it had very good flavour!

This was wonderful. I made the citrus concoction yesterday and refrigerated it overnight (just because I was making half my cake yesterday and half just before eating). Just before putting my cake together the next day, I mixed up some whipping cream and then blended the two, using the citrus concoction right out of the fridge. They blended perfectly. This was delicious, and was the perfect amount for my little cake.

Everyone loved this! My husband wanted to eat it by itself. Next time I will add 2 egg yolks, the whites did tend to curdle right away...use egg whites like someone else had suggested!! Overall it was a good recipe..wouldn't call it lemon filling though more of a citrus filling.
