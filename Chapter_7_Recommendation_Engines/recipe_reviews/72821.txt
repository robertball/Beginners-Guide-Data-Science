Here's what NOT to do:  DON'T use ripe bananas (you want them as firm as possible).  DON'T cook them too long or stir too much --- just warm them (they get soft).  DON'T wait any time whatsoever to serve this (it gets mushy and breaks down).  The recipe says to "serve immediately" and that is correct!  Good luck!

This is wonderful!  Just know that your bananas will not stay firm and nicely shaped.  They get a bit mushy and soften a lot as they cook.  But,you will be so pleased with this recipe.  It got rave reviews at my Build Your Own Ice Cream Sundae Party!  It was the favorite over my homemade hot fudge sauce and the homemade butterscoch sauce. I also made it again for topping our favorite Belgian Waffles... Divine!  Thanks!

I used it for pancake topping, and it was wonderful.  Since there were only two of us, I halved everything (except the vanilla - we love vanilla).  The only changes I will make next time will be to use the whole 1/4 cup of walnuts, and I will probably take other reviewers' suggestions and add maybe 1/2 cup crushed pineapple (my husband loves pineapple too - others might want to start with 1/4 cup, if you're halving the recipe like I did).  You do have to be very gentle with your banana slices or you will end up with mush -- but it will still be tasty mush!

We liked this, and it's super easy to make.  I had everything in my kitchen already.  Adding pineapple would boost the tropical flavor and sweetness, in my opinion, and make it a completely 5 star recipe.  The trick with cooking these bananas is to be as gentle as possible.  Place them in the butter and wait, don't stir them around.  After several minutes (5 or so) then use a spatula to gently flip them.  Minimal movement will help them hold their shape if that's what you're hoping for.
My daughter did LOVE it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Only took 10 mins, and it was delicious! The bananas were nicely coated in coconut and walnut pieces, and it was just the right sweetness! It was a quick treat that made a big impact.

Great idea!  Adding lemon or lime juice helps anyone who doesn't care for that overly ripe banana taste, plus, it lends the sauce a flavor that is more island-breezy.  The idea another reviewer mentioned to include pineapple is also great, but it is the lemon or lime that cuts the flavor to island-style, IMHO.  When adding in the lemon or lime, allowing the sauce to cook longer is no longer an issue in our kitchen anyway.  Either way.....  Enjoy!
