This was good. I likes the sweet tang to it, but I will try brown sugar instead of white next time. My husband doesn't like salmon, and was really disappointed when I told him that was for supper(I buy salmon for me and the girls-NOT for him) but since I'm out of groceries and this was all I had, I looked here for a really good salmon recipe. This one worked, he ate the fish, and said it was really good, "where did you get that recipe?". Here's a tip: Let the salmon sit in the sauce for at least 10 minutes before you serve it- it soaks it up and makes it moist- the fillets I took out and plated right  as soon as it came out of the oven were kinda dry, but the ones that I was putting away after supper were super moist and flavorful.
Thanks for making my husbands salmon dinner a pleasant experience!!

We did not enjoy this salmon at all.  I consider myself an above average cook so I believe this was the recipe, not a result of something I did wrong.  I boiled the onions in the vinegar/brown sugar...waiting for the "sauce" to reduce...it doesn't.  So after about 45 minutes or so, I just spooned some of the liquid over the salmon along with the onions.  The sauce which pooled around the bottom of the salmon burned onto my pan creating a lot of smoke; we couldn't taste the garlic butter at all (just added calories IMHO - you could omit this and I'm surprised nobody else mentioned it); and in the end, the onions were very chewy/sticky...not a nice meal in the least.  We will not be making this again.

This was a really easy recipe, and best of all both my girls (8 and 13) ate it with no complaints.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and only 1-1/2 onions instead of 3, and was very happy with the results.

So easy to do and so so delicious.

I just made a small adjustment, instead of melting the butter and putting in the garlic I simply put om the salmon about 1 garlic clove, chopped finely, then I put on about 1/2 teaspoon of margarine (in little dabs), then the onions.

Very unique combo and grouping of flavors!  We LOVED it, but we like those flavors.  It was so good my husband said he couldn't stop eating it!  We also love salmon fillets too.  We had it on wild salmon - yumm, yumm!  A new keeper.  Also, great presentation as well!

don't use as much vinegar as it calls for - or use something else instead.  The candied, caramelized onions were great though.

This recipe has too much vinegar and way too much sugar. It is just sicky sweet. The taste of the salmon doesn't come through at all.Lighten it up quite a bit by using less vinegar and sugar, and let that wonderful salmon flavor come through. Make sure it's cooked only until it flakes. Fish dries out quickly, so watch carefully.

This is a really good recipe. Hubby loved it. Co-workers want the recipe! Based upon prior reviews, i decided it best to cut the vinegar by half, which I did, using only 1/2 cup with success.

The salmon that I used for this recipe was not very good quality and tasted fishy.  This sauce was the only thing that could have made it edible (well, my kids smothered it in bbq sauce instead).  I think the recipe would be excellent with good quality salmon.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and only used 1/2 cup vinegar to the full 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also did not have fresh onion on hand, so I used @1 frozen diced onion.  I'm glad I didn't use the full 3 onions the recipe called for, that would have been too much for us.  As for the reviewers who found that the sauce didn't caramelize, I think perhaps caramelize is the wrong word choice (especially if you used the full 1 cup vinegar).  I waited until it had reduced by about 50% and then I poured it over the fish.  That worked pretty well for us.  thanks for the recipe!

I used only one onion and only half the vinegar for two salmon filets,  and I added chopped pecans before pouring the mixture on the salmon.  I thought it was very good and would make it again!

Yum! My husband and I both loved this recipe. The salmon was sweet so we made Spiced Potatoes (this recipe can be found on this wedsite) to pair with the sweetness of the salmon. However, we did not care for the onions. They were way too sweet. Thanks!

I made this tonight with peas and sautee'd sweet potatoes. I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top, cooked them in a tiny bit of butter and olive oil... Was fantastic. The salmon was delicious! Everyone loved it. Thanks!

So good! However, the onions did not caramelize for me. Perhaps that's something I need to work on as I don't have experience in caramelizing onions. Anyway, it still tasted amazing and I will definitely make it again!

We loved this.  I used more garlic and less onion than called for.  I'm glad I didn't use as much onion, as we found them too chewy and sticky to eat - but thought they added to the flavor nicely.  I'll definitely make this again!

Not bad. The onions wouldn't carmelize. The salmon was a bit dry, but that might have been my fault. We're going to try it again.

This was DELISH!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, using brown sugar, and letting it sit 5-10 minutes before serving.  My picky "meat & potatoes" husband even liked it.  Will definitely make again, as it is the only way he'll eat salmon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. I wasn't quite sure about making this recipe after reading the reviews. . I did brown the onions slightly before adding the brown sugar and vinegar. I also omitted the garlic. I will be making this recipe again and serving it to company.

Doesn't help that I don't like fish - did it for my son who does like salmon and for the omega-3. He didn't make any positive comments about it. Overall, ok.

Yum!  I have to admit, I changed the recipe slightly - I used splenda instead of sugar because I'm on low carb diet, but this was delicious! I will definitely make it again!

I wasn't so sure about this recipe at first, but my GF thought it would be nice. Glad I listened to her, turned out to be one of my favorite Salmon dishes. A little too much vinegar for me(not a fan of the taste/smell of vinegar) so next time we make it, I think I will either cut down on the Vinegar or increase the brown sugar.

I found this recipe to be very good. The preparation and the cook time was excellent for me and people who have late dinners. My girlfriend who is a Salmon lover but not one for food to be sweet unless it a dessert loved the carmelized onions. I feel this definitely rate a four. The kids want me to make it again lol.

This was very easy to make, and pretty good. It was nice to have fish without the normal salsas and citruses I typically use. Don't bother using the cookie sheet - I just put the salmon directly in the butter pan, turned to coat, put the onions on top, and put the whole thing in the oven. Just use less butter. The onions end up a little chewy, and there were too many - it was a pretty presentation, but we scraped most of them off. It was pretty sweet, but I served it with asparagus, so that cut the sweetness a little. All in all I'm glad I tried it, and will probably make it again, if for no other reason than it was easy and I have all the ingredients on a regular basis. But all in all, a good recipe.

This was really easy.  I didn't have the usual spices and whatnot I normally use when preparing salmon..so I logged into allrecipes.com to find a recipe I could ues with what I had in my kitchen.  My kids LOVED it! I substituted apple cider vinegar for the white (it's all I had in the cupboard)..and it was good..but just a tad too sweet (i might have been a little heavy handed with the sugar :o).  I plan to take it, as my contribution, to Thanksgiving dinner at a friends' house..so I'll have to play around with it before then.

Recipe has onions, since 2 of us are extremly allergic to them. We made some changes. We used natural brown sugar. Then Rolled in 1/4 c shredded coconut. Hard to find any recipes with out onions.

Absolutely wonderful! I eat salmon regularly for the Omega-3 content, as well as the taste. I loved this prep so much, I brought 16 salmom steaks and transferred a conference into a luncheon. Now everyone is eager to organize potlucks, just so I can furnish the salmon! Find out what you're missing; try this recipe!

I liked this recipe.  The onions were definitely sweet and somewhat chewy. It was a nice change from the way I usually fix salmon.  I probably should have added extra vinegar for more tang.

I thought this recipe was awesome.  I used 1½ onion and a box of brown sugar.  However, I cooked 7 salmon steaks (Maybe that dispersed the sweet taste).  Loved it with eggs the next morning.

This was the first time I ever made fish, so I was pretty nervous, but I followed the recipe and it came out great!  My parents and brother loved it.  It wasn't too difficult, and the only thing that worried me was that after 25 minutes, my onions still didn't seem "caramelized", but they turned out fine.  However, I'm not sure if the onions were for eating or just for flavoring.  I ended up eating some but pushing most aside and just enjoying the flavor of the salmon itself.  I paired it with some plain-ish angel hair pasta and all in all I enjoyed it very much!

First of all, I made this recipe for 2 servings, and a whole onion seemed like an awful lot, so I only sliced half an onion. Also, I used 1/2 tps garlic powder instead of minced fresh garlic. I don't know where I went wrong, but I cooked the sugar/vinegar mixture for almost 20 minutes and it never did carmelize. But it didn't seem to matter, because it turned out plenty tasty. My fiance and I really enjoyed it. I will probably make it again.

I thought this was fantastic.  I loved the caramelized onions and the sweet sauce on the salmon.  The salmon was perfect.  My husband and kids did like the salmon but wasn't crazy about the sweet sauce on the salmon.  I would certainly make this dish again especially for company.

I tried this with haddock and thought that it was just ok.  If I try it again I will be sure to use salmon it would probably be better.

This recipe is a total hit with my "fish hating" family!  It works well with other fish as well as salmon.  But, it is much better if you use brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Very easy to prepare and tasty. If someone is not too crazy about fish flavour this recipe hides the taste!
Very good!

I tried this with whitefish.  It was all right but nothing to special.  I will probably not make this again.

Very Good and easy. Wonderful way to include fish in the diet.  Just check that you don't over cook the salmon.

This was ok. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't really what I was looking for I guess. I thought it had a nice presentation.  I cooked the sauce longer than 15 minutes because I thought the sauce was supposed to be thick (it was good this way). I used just one smallish onion, otherwise followed directions as written.  I'm not sure what the purpose was for the butter, but I did it.

This was excellent!  My 7 year old who LOVES salmon loved it and my significant other, who is a steak and potato guy who only endures it for my son and because he knows he needs the omega 3's, loved it too!  He even said I could make it once a week!!!  
I cooked 2 large and 2 small fillets, only used 1/4 apple cider vinegar, 1 small yellow onion and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I put each fillet directly in the butter/garlic mixture,coating both sides, then put each fillet directly in the skillet (cast iron) with the onion mixture, coated both sides well and then cooked it directly in the skillet.  This allowed the fish to simmer in the onion mixture, preventing it from drying out. I basted the fish every 10 min when stirring the Spiced Potatoes (a side dish recipe on this site).  The sweetness of the fish and the slight spice of the potatoes was complimenting and both my "boys" loved it!!! Will definitely become a regular dish in our home!!

Completely disappointed! I had trouble getting the onions to caramelize even after adding a bit more brown sugar. The salmon was dry and it was like onion covered salmon.

Absolutely loved it.  I, too reduced both the sugar (used brown) and the vinegar to 1/2 a cup because it seemed like too much sugar.  I couldn't keep my hands off it and had eaten my portion before we started dinner...yum yum and then more yum.  Woke up and ate some for breakfast the next day too... smiles

This is a winner if you like sweet sauces - my family is still talking about how good it was.  I was afraid it was going to be too vinegary while it was cooking, but it came out just right.

I love seafood of all kinds especially fish, but I hated this recipe.  Maybe I am the lone horse here but I could still taste a very pungent onion taste even though I followed the recipe and advice of others.  I would not recommend or make again.

My family and I enjoyed this dish, though next time I would use less vinegar. It was just a tiny bit strong in the finished product. The “sauce” isn’t meant to thicken. Think of it less as a sauce and more as a poaching liquid, and I agree to let it sit for a few minutes after cooking before removing it from the liquid. Overall it was good, and I will likely use this recipe, or a variation, again

I did half of suggested glaze and it still turned out too much for me. While cooking glaze, I teared up to the point of hardly being able to stay by the cooktop, besides the fact that my whole house smelled like onions and overwhelming smell of vinegar.

Very delicious, uni friends definitely liked it too. Used white sugar instead of brown but added teriyaki sauce when sauteeing to get rid of some of the sweetness and give some color. Great decision there :P Thanks for the recipe

This is good!
I didn't have enough vinegar so I probably use about half the amount the recipe says. I had it with brown rice. It was delicious. Thank you!
