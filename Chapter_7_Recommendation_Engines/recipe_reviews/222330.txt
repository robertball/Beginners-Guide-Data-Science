If you love garlic, then you'll absolutely adore this recipe! I marinated the steaks overnight and while there's nothing quite like a grilled steak the combination of the balsamic vinegar along with the oil-roasted garlic put this classic over the top! This definitely did put a smile on my face as well as my husband's. Thanks for yet another fabulous recipe Chef John!!!

I made this tonight and it was awesome! Chef John hit another home run with this recipe. I only marinated the steaks for 6 hours and cooked them to med-rare. I served them with "Herb's Popular Baked Beans" (a recipe that I had submitted to this site).

Try the "Herb's Popular Baked Beans" recipe. I guarantee you that won't be disappointed.

Garlic Lover?  You will love this!  I used the leftover garlic olive oil for grilled potatoes, some garlic bread, grilled romaine salad and grilled asparagus.   It was a garlic lovers dream!  Enjoy!

This is a tough one for me to rate and I'll tell you why. I've tried this recipe exact as it is a few times now and for some reason, I don't seem to get a good garlic taste from the marinated meat itself (have used a few different cuts as well). While I can add some of the garlic oil as directed at the end, which makes it tastes better, it seems like the marinating is extra work for not enough payback. I would prefer to cook a good steak and add some garlic butter to the top of it then go through all these steps.
Having said all of this though, I LOVE this garlic oil for bread dipping. I have made it for that purpose and added herbs to it and it is amazing for that.
So, I have given the recipe 4 stars because of that but I do think that others should try the full recipe version to see what they think.

I marinated the 2 rib eyes in ingredients for 3-4 days, then cooked them on the charcoal grill, until medium rare, and they came out terrific.

Excellent, I used precleaned garlic cloves after 45 min on low mine were still not soft so put all in a metal casserole dish covered w/foil and put in 350 oven w/the sweet potatoes. For marinade covered steaks lightly both sides w/ worchestershire, then some garlic marinade and sprinkled w/Montreal seasoning. Put all in a Pyrex dish, covered and turned a couple times for 2 hours. Grilled to perfection and the soft sweet garlic spread over the top was mouth watering. Will make a nice steak sandwich today!!

My daughter and I get together most every Sunday night for grilled steaks. We both loved the "garlic steaks". While it won't replace our go to basic salt-pepper-minced garlic recipe, it was a nice change. We'll do it again.

Fantastic! Marinating overnight is perfect. I used a touch more salt and pepper. Pairs great with grilled halved onions and cherry tomatoes in same marinade!

I followed this recipe exactly as written...I marinated overnight, about 10 hours.  Cooked this for my 'picky steak eater' hubby & he raved about how delicious it was...I never cook steaks because he is so picky about them.  He had no complaints about this one, so this one is a keeper. I'm so happy I found this recipe so I can now cook steaks at home!!  It's delicious & Thank you! :)

Made tonight for Father's Day.  Followed the exact recipe and family absolutely loved it!  My family couldn't stop eating the delicious steaks.  As Chef John suggested, I let my hubby do the grilling!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe for all garlic lovers like myself. What a difference  the roasted garlic made for the topping on the steaks. I will definitely make this again. I also saved the olive oil to dip some French bread in for later meals.

My family and I thought this was a great recipe was great. Steaks had great flavor. I didn't have basalmic vinegar so I used A1 and Italian dressing.

Loved it !! I served it accompanied with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and my personal "kicked up" Caesar Salad. As Chef John recommends buy quality beef. Don't waste all that beautiful garlic on mediocre offerings.

I marinated the steaks for only 5 hours and had more than 2 ounces of steak in each batch of marinade, but the garlic flavor still came through on the steaks. It was subtle, but definite. Instead of whole cloves I minced the roasted garlic to make a garlic oil sauce. The garlic and balsamic vinegar was awesome. Everyone loved this meal! We'll definitely make it again.

Steaks turned out really good, although frying the garlic until golden brown on low took way longer than 30 minutes as the recipe suggests.

I kept right with the recipe as I always do the first time making something so I can truly rate it.  I have to admit that I usually rave about Chef John's recipes, but unfortunately this time it was  just ok.  I love garlic and had high hopes but I think I like my own seasoning better when seasoning my steaks.  I used porterhouse steaks and kept in airtight bag over night.
