Overall I found this dish to be really easy quick and flavorful.  I made mine with a few additions/substitutions.  Instead of the canned chicken I used 2 fresh chicken breast that I bake first.  I also had no broccoli so I used asparagus and I used fresh crushed garlic instead of the garlic salt and increased the parmesan cheese to 3/4 cups.

didn't add the cornstarch, not a fan.  threw in some fresh mushrooms at the very end.  It was very quick and a good way to get your vegetables.
