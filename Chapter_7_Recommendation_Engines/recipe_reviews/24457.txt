This was my second time making rum balls, the first time I made chocolate ones. These coconut rum balls tasted sooooo good and were very easy to make. I used crushed almonds instead of walnuts because I can't stand walnuts, and they turned out great.  I made them a week ahead and put them in tin cans, made EXCELLENT Christmas gifts and stored well in the fridge. The only problem was after you roll a few balls, your hands get very sticky, so have a spoon nearby to scrape the sticky stuff off your hands after rolling a some balls!!

A great variation for rum balls! I make a few changes to the listed recipe, however. I prefer to toast the coconut before I roll the balls in it- YUM! I also add about 1/8 cup more rum (coconut flavored), otherwise the coconut flavor completely masks the rum flavor.

Made these for a NYE party last night. They turned out well and were very tasty. I made a half batch 4 days prior and used a coconut rum. I crushed the vanilla wafers in a ziploc bag and used a rolling pin. I then rolled the dough into individual balls. It was kind of messy and sticky but was not a big deal. I then sprinkled with a generous amount of powdered sugar, put in a sealed container and popped into the fridge to cure. Prior to party, I rolled each ball again in powdered sugar because they were a little bit sticky and then finished off by rolling in chopped nuts.  You have to like rum and coconut, which party guests did, so they went over very well. Recipe was not difficult and I would make again.

This is my first time even eating, let alone making rum balls.  I doubled the rum like most reviews said and I used coconut rum.  The flavor is great, but I think chocolate dipped would be fun to try next.  They are a bit gooey, just like eating the inside of a Mounds bar, but extra rum will probably do that!  I made them for the International holiday "Talk Like a Pirate Day" and no body had just one.  I will definitely make again.

This was the 1st time I ever made rum balls, and these were EXCELLENT.  They were so easy to make and just tasted amazing, the absolute perfect amount of "rum taste".  Like the last reviewer mentioned, after rolling a few, your hands get very sticky so just make sure to have something to wipe them off with nearby and you're all set.

These are by far the best rum balls I have made so far.  They are soft and moist and just tasty.  I coat them in melted semi-sweet chocolate and then roll them in chocolate sprinkles.  PURE HEAVEN.

To keep your hands from becoming sticky, I found that if you put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before you roll the dough it isn't that sticky. Also, after you roll them into balls, place the balls back into the fridge to allow them to harden before rolling them in powdered sugar, coconut or whatever you want to roll them in.

Not enough rum in this recipe. Rum should be doubled, or possibly tripled. The balls taste like nothing (a little coconutty, a little walnutty, but not enough of either to really make a good flavor). Perhaps some sugar would add to this recipe... it is a cookie we are making, after all. There is another coconut rum ball recipe on allrecipes that calls for both 1/4 cup of rum (that sounds more like it) and quite a bit of sugar. I'll bet that one tastes like rum balls. I gave the recipe 2 stars because the balls are some of the blandest cookies I have ever tasted.

Super delish and nice and easy to make in bulk. Freeze great, though last plenty long enough in the fridge.

These tasted so good. Sadly, I tripled the amount of coconut rum (which I'm sure made it taste even better...lol), and even after I shaped them, they all kind of fell flat. I tried putting them in the freezer, but to no avail. I also tried coating them in chocolate, then rolling them in the coconut, but I ended up with a delicious mess. I ended up putting them into a Pyrex bowl, pouring the melted chocolate and coconut on top, and freezing it to make a sort of cake. Next time I make these, I definitely wouldn't suggest tripling the amount of rum.... In short, follow the recipe, they taste great!

Great basic recipe.  I did double the amount of rum (I used coconut rum), which made for just the right taste.  I ended up rolling the balls in melted chocolate, and then through flake coconut...and the result was beautful.

Even though I substituted ginger snaps and pecans, these turned out really good.  I think it helps if you use good rum.  After they chilled, I dipped these in white chocolate to make them extra yummy.  Would be very good for a party any time of year.

Good recipe...didnt use the nuts because of allergies, didnt use as much of the sweetened condensed, about half the can,used 2 cups confectioners sugar and added a little more rum...yummy! Oh, and after they had firmed up in the fridge, dipped them in chocolate...thanks for sharing!

Super easy to make and very tasty.  Based on following this recipe, I give it three stars because I couldn't taste the rum (And really... that's what these are all about right? :) ).  I used light rum.  If I make these again I think I'll use a dark rum or even a spiced rum to draw out more flavor.  I agree with other posters, doubling the rum will probably add more flavor.

Couldn't find Nilla wafers anywhere, so made homemade vanilla wafers (also on all recipes) and went from there. I only used a light rum and found that I could probably have added at least another 1/4 cup to really bring the rum flavour out. They still tasted pretty darn good... although I do think that a darker or a coconut rum would really have jazzed it up!

These were just amazing, I found that the chocolate coating was too bitter and added extra sugar...which made it tooo sweet...and yet it was still a smash hit. Oh and I also omitted the rum. Everyone loved it!! It was painstakingly long to make but so worth it! :)

Just LOVED it...give it a shot!

My mother used to make something similar to these when I was young, but she now has arthritis and can't bake for the holidays.  She was so excited to taste these, she thought I found her recipe!  (In THAT kitchen??  Not a chance.)  Thanks, you made her Christmas!  Will definitely make again, especially since they store well for so long, and improve in flavor over time.

My husband had these on a cruise a few years back and we've been searching for this recipe ever since!  I don't care for nuts, so I substituted and extra 1/2 cup crushed wafers and 1/2 cup coconut.  They turned out great!

These “rum balls” do not hold their shape and are mushy.  Even after freezing them, if you put them out for guests, they seem to melt on the tray and become a gooey mess.

I made these once and they were good, but not great.  The next time I used Malibu Rum and they turned out AWESOME!  There are other stronger coconut rums out there, but Malibu is easily the most flavorful.  If you want a more potent rum ball, *add* an equivalent amount of Malibu Rum to the light rum instead of substituting it.

I used two boxes of vanilla wafers crushed up in the blender. Took them to a party and everyone liked them. I also dipped them in chocolate. If you like rum you will love these.

I added the extra rum as was suggested by another which made the dough very mushy so I added 2 tablespoons  of flour to firm it up which it did. All I could taste was vanilla in the final product which seemed to even overpower the extra rum.

These were excellent!  I kept them in the refrigerator overnight to make sure they solidified.  I got rave reviews and will definitely make these again.

I thought these were alright.  They tasted pretty good.  I was unable to roll mine right away, so they were sitting in the fridge for closer to 12 hours, and when I went to roll them, the coconut wouldn't stick to the balls. I'll have to wait for xmas parties this weekend to know how big of a hit they are!

These were easy to make and were good. I liked them but they were not a huge hit at our family dinner. Not sure if I will make them again.

These didn't turn out well at all.  They were too strong and everyone at work was getting buzzed off them.  I guess that could be good if you are looking to get your guests tipsy, but I didn't like them.

Perfect! These have the perfect amount of coconut and rum - nothing overpowers the other. I didn't have time to roll the balls after I mixed them, so it stayed in the the refrigerator for 24 hours. They rolled great! I couldn't stop sneaking tastes! I can't wait to give them out as gifts!
