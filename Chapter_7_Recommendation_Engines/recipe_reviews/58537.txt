Very tasty and creamy. Definately let sit so the creamy mixture will thicken perfectly - about 20 minutes.

Loved this recipe. I make it for breakfast as an alternative to oatmeal on cold mornings. I add dried apricots as well.

This is an excellent recipe. It thickened perfectly ... and has a delicate texture, and intense spice flavor. I'll be making this again, and again ... and again.

Whoa, this is sooooo sweet!!  It's almost hard to enjoy because of that.  I would cut the sugar in half if I were to make this again.  I used brown rice and skim milk.  Added an egg with the second addition of milk because it wasn't thickening up at all.  (Probably because of the skim).  It worked well though, and thickened right up.  Good texture.

This is DELICIOUS!  I rated it 4 stars (and not 5) because I did change a few things.  I took the advice of another reviewer and decreased the sugar to 1/4C and that was sweet enough for me.  I also used 1/2tsp vanilla instead of the maple extract and added 1/4C raisins.  The amount of spices is just perfect and it thickened up just fine.  Very good for a relatively quick version of rice pudding!

As far as rice pudding recipes go, this one is very good.  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed except for adjusting the flavoring. I am not a maple fan, so I used vanilla which worked nicely in combination with 1/4 tsp.nutmeg and a pinch of cloves.

this was pretty good.  I used real maple syrup instead of the extract.  I didnt need as much milk as was called for and it didnt thicken up as much as i thought it would.  Also the rice didnt cook very well. I had to simmer it after adding the milk for more like 30 mins.  This recipe is similar to one i make all the time.  I cook the rice in 1/2 c sugar and a combo of milk and water(i add alittle more than is needed)then when rice is cooked i add spices or vanilla, marg and a little more milk to give it a rice pudding cinsistancy

Rave reviews each time I've made it.  Once I followed the recipe exactly, it was a little sweet, but not overly. (I think the arborio rice makes a difference.) The next time I was gluten-free, so substituted 1/2 cup real maple syrup for the sugar and flavoring. I prefer the maple syrup version.

This was so quick and easy and delicious! I'm used to my dad's rice pudding which takes hours to make and a bunch of ingredients and I was able to make this all with stuff I had sitting around. I didn't have an maple extract or syrup so I just used a little bit of vanilla extract and some honey and it tasted wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who might be craving some warm, creamy, and wonderfully spiced rice pudding.

YUM! For a creamier, thicker more decadent breakfast pudding, I used fat free evaporated milk instead of 2% milk. I also added a heaping cup of organic raisins that I added when I added in the spices and butter so they'd have a chance to plump up. We all loved this. Next time I'll make a recipe and a half so there's a little extra for those who want more next time. I bet this would be just as good with brown rice, too. I'd just have to increase the milk/water for next time. This recipe was a huge help to me for making a hot and filling breakfast on a cold day and I got rid of the last of the white rice I had in my pantry. Win/win!

This recipe worked great and I didn't change a thing!  My kids and my husband loved it and we aren't big fans of rice pudding to begin with.  I did have to add a little more water during the initial cooking time, because it wasn't cooking all the way through.  It didn't appear to change the end product.  Next time I will be using brown rice instead as a healthier option.

Good recipe! I took some of the suggestions of other reviewers and wanted to share the results. I cut the sugar in half - big mistake. Next time I will try cutting only 1/4 of the original amount. I used whole milk because I think creamy is better for rice pudding. I also cut the nutmeg by 1/4 but it was still too strong and overpowered the cinnamon. I think I would use half or even only 1/4 of the recipe amount next time. I didn't have maple flavor so I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Next time I'll try this with maple flavor since I still think it's a great idea and should provide a unique taste.

Yummy! I used 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 TB of real maple syrup instead of extract, and added a beaten egg to the second part of milk. Easy, fast, delicious.

Overall, a good take on Rice Pudding.  I did make some changes to it though.  I also used brown rice (that is all I stock in the pantry) and skim milk, I also used 1/8 cup of Splenda for Baking, and 1 Tbs and 1 tsp of organic amber maple syrup.
It doesn't end there. I did have trouble getting the "custard" to thinken so I added an egg with the second addition of milk and spices, since I only had whole cinnamon sticks I stuck on stick in with the rice while it was cooking and left it until I put the pudding into dessert cups, I also added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger.
Right before I removed from the heat I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans (left over in the pantry) and 1/2 cup of raisins.  
After the mods I like the recipe.  Next time I might ommit the sugar all together.

Nice, quick and easy recipe. I used fat free half and half to give it a richer flavor, vanilla instead of maple (just personal preference) and used brown rice instead of white so at least we got some fiber. Turned out great and the kids ate it up

This is a wonderful recipe!  So easy and delicious, even my picky toddler loves this!! Some things I did to boost the nutritional value; I ground up a cup of almonds, added flax seed meal, used half maple syrup and half brown sugar instead of white sugar, basmati rice in place of white.

I didn't feel like cooking and just wanted rice pudding. As i'm cooking it, it reminded me of my mom's. This is really good and creamy and tasty and comforting. It was so easy and i had all the ingredients on hand (except maple extract, i used vanilla instead) and the time stirring just flew by as i remembered mom.

I guess I am use to Grandma's. I omitted the cloves as I don't like them. I should of used all the sugar in the recipe but I went by the advice of other posts and it was not sweet enough. I couldn't find maple extract so I used Maple syrup instead. It is not that the recipe is bad it tastes fine. I think what I perhaps don't care for is the Maple flavor and nutmeg. At the end I ended up adding more sugar and vanilla extract to make it more to my taste. Also, the cooking times were a little less for me perhaps because I have a gas stove? If I make this again I will only use vanilla extract, full amount of sugar in the recipe, and only cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe! Sometimes we just have to make it our own so it turns out how we like it.

Great recipe and so simple!  I also reduced the sugar to one quarter cup, used real maple syrup and almond milk.  The almond milk gave it a really nice flavor.

I like this recipe but the spices are overpowering. I read some reviews and reduced the nutmeg and cinnamon to 1/4 teaspoon each and it was still a bit too much.

Easy! Yummy! You can substitute with almond milk instead of 2% if you are lactose intolerant. I put a little less sugar and it still came out pretty sweet. Just something to consider. Left out cloves since I didn't have any. Really a great, tasty recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe. My husband who does not like rice pudding eats this regularly. Of course, I made changes. I always do.  First of all I make the rice separately in my rice machine first and use plenty of water to make it extra creamy. We are vegans (pretty close anyway) so I substituted soy milk for the 2% milk. I can't get maple flavouring in my area so I used 1 - 2 tablespoons of real maple syrup instead. And finally I don't think rice pudding is rice pudding unless it has sultanas (or golden raisins) so I add about 1/2 cup at the end.

My husband is on a low cholesterol diet, so no potatoes but whole grain rice is permitted, so a bonus that he can have it for dessert too.  It was nice to find this recipe that didn't call for custard (no eggs!).  I cut the sugar in half & used low fat milk, & we still enjoyed it.

I had to improvise a bit due to my family's needs and what was in my pantry.

I didn't have short grain rice, just extra long grain white rice. I imagine short grain rice would make a nicer texture. Note to self: Get some short grain rice for next time.
I used half cup of REAL maple syrup instead of maple flavoring and sugar. Mmmm. Nice upgrade. Plenty of sweetness.
I used whole goat's milk instead of 2% cow's milk, and left out the butter.

I thought it was yummy, but very rich. I could only eat a small portion at a time.

Ok.  I didn't follow exactly and I think that is the reason it wasn't quite right.  I also accidentally put too much Cinnamon in it.  It was sweet.  I used real maple syrup (100% pure), 1/2 cup in place of the sugar and maple flavoring.  I also added a spice called Cardamom, 1/2 Tsp.  Next time I'll try it as is.

EXTREMELY easy & great tasting eggless recipe!  I even cooked the rice overnight with my rice cooker and added in later after the mixture had thickened.  Also, I like a little heavier recipe so I used 1/2 cup 10% cream with reduced milk in this recipe. Simply Delicious!!

This was ok but I doubt I'll make it again.I think I'll stick to my recipe for baked rice pudding instead.

A diabetic friend told me you can't make a sugar free rice pudding that tastes good. Challenge Accepted! Used 1/2 cup Nutrasweet instead of sugar and it turned out great! Otherwise didn't change a thing. Used 2 percent milk as suggested and it thickened up perfectly. Yes, if you use non-fat milk you must use less otherwise it won't thicken like it's supposed to. But that is true for everything you make. Trust me I use non-fat for a lot of things due to various dietary restrictions in my family.

Delicious!  Made it first as is.  Wonderful.  The next time I used a can of coconut milk plus enough 2% to make 2 cups and used vanilla extract instead of maple and added raisins.  Super yummy!

This was a great recipe!  I don't ever cook or really eat rice but I was in the mood for rice pudding and had never made it before.  I had white long-grain rice and didn't have any maple flavouring but this still turned out really well.  I ended up adding vanilla, raisins and coconut and would make again in a heartbeat.

I had some extra leftover plain white rice, so started the recipe with boiling 2 cups of  unsweetened almond/ coconut milk, adding sugar and maple extract.   I added 2 1/4 cups cooked rice.  It thickened up nicely.  I cut the nutmeg a bit and added some cardamom.  I added a big a handful of organic raisins and a big handful of chopped walnuts.  Yum comfort dessert on chilly fall nights!

I used a 1/2 cup less milk than recipe called for and a 1/4 cup less sugar than recipe calls for. No cloves either. Used maple syrup. Yummy. I think my 6 year old would like it more without the nutmeg. I think it's great. You can even cut back a little more on the sugar. It's pretty sweet.

This is so good with some modifications. I also used real maple syrup, about a 1/4 cup. And I reduced the white sugar to just a couple of tablespoons. I also used about a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves as all of those are in the spice as well as others which go well with maple.

I didn't have any maple extract so I used vanilla extract & I cut back on the spices a bit, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  It is EXCELLENT!!  Creamy & just the right amount of sweetness, although some may prefer less.  I have an very acute sweet tooth! :)  I highly recommend this recipe & will definitely make again & again.  Thank you!

So yummy! I used real Maple Syrup. Was perfect & creamy. Definitely my forever rice pudding recipe.
