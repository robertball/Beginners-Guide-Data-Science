I made this recipe using thawed, frozen peas and the rest as directed.  I did let it rest overnight before serving.  It was ok, but need more zip for us.  The mayonnaise covered the pimentos and made them white, so I added some to the dish before serving to have the added color-pop. Served this with grill fish, grilled pork tenderloin, and 'Delicious and Easy Corn on the Cob' from AR.  **To the leftovers, I added diced celery and dry roasted peanuts.  For us, that gave the recipe the boost we were looking for.  (My 3-star review was on recipe as listed, not with my add-ins.)

When you make this according to the recipe, it has the consistency of potato salad--and the flavors blend easier with canned peas.  My experience with thawed frozen peas as the main ingredient in a salad (peas and peanuts, which hasn't been published here yet) is that they have a crisper texture but don't take flavor well unless it's bold (like the garlic and Worcestershire sauce in my peas and peanuts).  I'm sorry Molly didn't like it more, but the use of thawed frozen peas likely didn't do it any favors.

This dish, or different versions of it, is a staple in the south, and I've seen it made in any number of ways. It's just a matter of taste, but I prefer a crisper dish, by using frozen peas, instead of canned. This version, while very tasty, has a softer, mushier texture.

I LOVE vegetables but peas are one of my least favorite. Nonetheless, I make them on occasion for other people. Thus was the case for a St. Patrick's Day party. I certainly didn't think I'd like canned peas (gag) but, I followed a reviewer's advice and stuck with the recipe. I used Le Sueur Baby peas and I made it a day in advance as directed (And very handy for a party!) Alas, I did not receive the cheese cubes I had ordered so, I did make a slight change. In lieu of pimento peppers and cubed cheese, I used the tub of pimento cheese spread I had. I was jalepeno flavored so I'm sure my pea dish had a little more kick but I think it was still in line with what the cook here was making.  I used less than one cup mayo since the spread already had mayo. Probably 3 TB. It was very tasty and I will make it again and again. I've since been asked for this recipe. Thanks for sharing.  I never, ever, would have thought I'd like canned peas!
