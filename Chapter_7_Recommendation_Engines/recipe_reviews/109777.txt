Here's my five-star version, which is a clone of a menu item at an upscale Mexican restaurant in my town:

Use peeled and deveined raw shrimp (medium size) - marinate shrimp in the sauce from one small can of chiles in adobo (discard the chiles), a generous pinch of cayenne pepper (we like it hot!), juice of two limes, and two tablespoons of flour (thickens the mixture so it stays on during cooking). Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a skillet on high heat, add shrimp, cook 3-4 minutes or until shrimp are done. Serve in warmed white corn tortillas (2 tortillas per taco - Mexican restaurants almost always double-wrap corn tortilla tacos). Garnish each taco with a slice of avocado and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Amazing!

These shrimp were so easy and quick to make.  Of course, the hardest part is making and prepping the items to put with it and shelling the shrimp.  I made fresh corn tortillas and fresh guacamole as well as Best Black Beans from this site.  A fresh pico de gallo or salsa to go with it would have even been better.The fresher the shrimp the better these tacos will be. Be sure to keep moving the shrimp around so that the bottom ones do not get too done too quickly. Do not cook the shrimp too long as they will get tough.  Also use a high quality, robust flavored bacon for best flavor.  I was able to cut down the quantity of the bacon to 8 oz and still had enough flavor and pieces to go with the shrimp.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing...my husband gobbled it up and thanked me profusely.

My husband cooked this tonight and it was AMAZING! The one and only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he used only 1 chipotle pepper instead of 3. I really love spicy foods and have a pretty high tolerance for spicyness and the 1 pepper made this dish firey hot! I would not have enjoyed it if it was any hotter. We will definitely be keeping this recipe to use again. Thanks!

I made these for some friends last weekend, and they were very good. Three peppers isn't enough, though. I used five and everyone's opinion was they probably needed two more. Still, a fun and easy dish!

These were soooo good! They were easy to make. We figured out how important the lime juice was to this recipe when we prepared one taco with and one without. The one without the lime juice was pretty spicy. The one with was neutralized and really, really good!

Awesome recipe!  I made a few alterations, used whole onion, 1 lb of raw medium shrimp.  Kept everything else the same and my family devoured this one!

I made a couple of adjustments due to personal taste and what was on hand. I used canned chipotle sauce (minus the chiles) that was left over from another recipe this week. I also marinated the shrimp for about 6 hours in the juice of half a lime. I had mine without cilantro, and really liked it. Husband had his with, and thought it was good but not great. Thanks!

These were very good and easy to prepare. I used raw shrimp instead of cooked.  I also put more Chipotle peppers, but that made them very hot.  My whole family really enjoyed them and I will definately be making this again.

Really light and fresh, and just the right kick of spice! I heated the tortillas until slightly crispy, and topped with pico de gallo! Both my fiance and I really liked these!

These are ridiculously delicious shrimp tacos.  I adjusted the recipe to make 2 servings, using about 12 ounces of peeled and deveined raw shrimp and kept them whole instead of cutting them in half.  I think I will cut them into pieces or halves the next time I make them because the tacos were a little difficult to eat left this way.  I marinated the shrimp in a little fresh lime juice and some of the minced chipotle chilies, along with some of their sauce, for about 1 hour.  After crisping the chopped bacon, I removed it from the pan and saved for topping the tacos.  I also added 2 minced garlic cloves, which I briefly saut√©ed with the onion.  Then the shrimp and the rest of the chipotles went in to cook until the shrimp were perfectly pink. Along with the reserved crispy bacon bits, I also topped the tacos with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced avocado and a crema sauce I prepared using sour cream, chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice and a pinch of salt.  I found the heat of the dish just perfect.

Awesome!!!  Love the salty bacon, the smokey shrimp, and the tart lime.  These had just the right spice and were not too hot.  I can't wait to make these again.

Husband thought this was going to be just another shrimp taco, but he raved about how good these were. I used less bacon, used red onion, used only one pepper from the adobe sauce,but milked the peppers. We used whole wheat tortillas and added avocado slices. We also made the tomato cucumber salad which tasted great on the taco as well as the side dish.

A great quick and easy recipe. I made a HUGE mistake the first time around though. Instead of putting just ONE chipotle chile in it..i put like 5. OMG do not do this! AND I added jalape√±os. See..I love spicy foods...but I didn't realize the adobo sauce is spicy and so when mixed with jalape√±os..it is way too hot!!!!!!

So just put in ONE chipotle chile...cook down the onion so they are sweet.

My version: I add in the chipotle chile, sun dried tomatoes, onion, (turkey bacon optional) and add the cilantro at the last minute so the cilantro flavor isn't cooked down and stays fresh. Very delish!

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN WITH A MUCH BETTER OUTCOME THIS TIME AROUND. I FRIED MY ONION AND BACON TOGETHER, DRAINED WELL AND THEN PROCEEDED AS DIRECTED. I REALLY THINK THIS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I ALSO SERVED THIS IN SIFT CORN TORTILLAS AND GARNISHED WITH CILANTRO, AVOCADO SLICES AND A GENEROUS SQUIRT OF FRESH LIME JUICE. DO NOT SKIP THE LIME. IT NOT ONLY WILL KEEP YOUR AVOCADO FROM BROWNING (SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO ADD IT), IT DIES DOUBLE DUTY TO HELP NEUTRALIZE THE HEAT! FANTASTIC!!! I'm not sure about these. On the contrary, my hubby couldn't get enough! For me, the flavor of this was very one-dimensional. Surprisingly, I couldn't taste the bacon at all or, for that matter, any smokiness from it (which, to my surprise, my huby RAVED about). All I could taste was underseasoned shrimp and a bit of bite from the chipotle pepppers every now and then. NOTE: I found 3 chipotles and a few t chipotle sauce to be spot on. Sometimes, I'd get a SUPER hot bite, but most of the time, the heat was palatable. Since my hubby is BEGGING me to make these again, I feel it's not fair to give up altogether, but it will be a while before I do. Served on tostada shells with fresh pico de gallo, cubed avocado and chopped cilantro garnishes and black beans / Mexican rice on the side. Of course my hubby thinks this is the best thing I've ever made (he bragged about our meal to all of his co-workers hahaha)! Thanks anyways, rvelasquez. :-)

We thought that this was missing something.  If I make it again I will tweak it and possibly leave out the bacon.  Not sure why this was just averaqe recipe for us.

What a fabulous taste.  We only had about a pound of shrimp, and that was still PLENTY for my family of 5 to eat until we were full.

Delicious - and spicy! I loved the bacon, shrimp and chipotle together, a combo I had never tried. I added a little lime juice to combat the dryness. I served this with avocado, which helps break the heat and was a great texture with the shrimp. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this dish as written (except I cooked the onion and bacon together at the same time and marinated the shrimp in the chipotle and adobo sauce for 1 hr beforehand). My hubby LOVED this!! He said it was kinda like something from a good Mexican restaurant. I gave it 4 stars because, for me personally, the shrimp was missing something. Can't put my finger on it but it didn't WOW me. It was still good though and I enjoyed my meal a lot. After trying as is, I decided to add guacamole and some crumbled cotija cheese to my tacos. YUM!!! That definitely helped make this meal wonderful to me. Will definitely make this again. (By the way, don't skip the lime juice... it adds yumminess. Hubby tried without and with lime and he liked it with lime best.)

These were pretty tasty! I just thought the tacos could have had more in them than just the shrimp so I added avocado and rice that I already had made. Very good flavors!

We enjoyed these very much, even my son said they were "awesome". I minced up two chipotle peppers, seeds and all with some of the adobo sauce and squeezed two small fresh limes over it. Marinated the shrimp in that for about an hour before cooking. I felt it was just the right amount of heat. My husband got into the bacon for breakfast in the morning so I only had four slices of thick bacon, but really that was plenty and I enjoyed the little crunches of bacon, but didn't feel so guilty about eating so much fat....heck the recipe calls for almost a lb. of bacon. I didn't have any corn tortillas, so used taco sized flour tortillas. But I would think corn would probably taste much better, and flour got kind of sloppy to eat with. Or you could do like my son did and wrap it like a burrito. Served with Best Black Beans on AR.

I skipped the bacon because it doesn't seem to go in tacos (in my opinion) and because I didn't think it would need it with all the smokey flavor of the chipotle peppers. I think I made the right decision after tasting the tacos. I added guacamole and sour cream and served the tacos with a salad of shredded lettuce and pico de gallo. It was very tasty but my husband thought it was all a tad too hot. Would probably make again.

This recipe is awesome! I ended up using 4 chipotle peppers as we like spicy plus the chipotles were a little on the mild side. I filled the tacos with the shrimp mixture, topped with Spicy Southwestern Slaw & chopped cilantro, and served with Lime Cilantro Rice. Amazing good! The family said I had to make this one again soon! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was fantastic!! We only had flour torts on hand. But the filling was awesome. I put one extra pepper and a little more sauce from the can.

Good stuff! I cut recipe in half and used 2 chipotles, pretty darn spicy- which I like but my partner said was a little too spicy- he thought one would have been enough. Really easy, quick to prepare and delicious!

The men folk raved and raved about this one.  Both "Seafood Teen" and "Habanero Husband" found this to be completely delicious.  Using 3 chipotles makes it awfully hot (at least with the brand I used) so test after one and add more if you want it hotter. I used precooked bacon and just warmed it in the pan before adding the onions. Two of us liked it even better with a touch of sour cream on top.  It added a great creamy touch.

This was excellent with a few changes.  First, I have no idea why anyone would use cooked shrimp.  Throw in raw shrimp halved the long way (through the vein) about 2/3 of the way through the onion cooking.  As soon as the shrimp is cooked, add chipotle.  Here's the second thing.  With the chipotle, add some cream.  How much?  Just enough to make it creamy, but not enough to make it sauce-like.  Third, cook the tortillas in some oil, they taste a whole lot better.  Once all that is done, it's a five star recipe.

I loved these!  they were very spicy and delicious.  With all the bacon, they are a little high in fat, so I need to come up with a way to keep the amazing flavor, but reduce the fat.

reduced the amount of bacon saut√©ed 1/2 and deep fried the other 1/2 and both were very good.  Little spicy but great flavor.

I really liked this recipe. For some reason mine came out a tad salty but i did halve the recipe so maybe that was the problem. Next time i will make the whole recipe and rate again. All in all good recipe. We added avocado, tomatoes, and lettuce.

I went with 16 ounces of bacon, added chopped yellow and red peppers, and doubled the chipotle peppers.  Also, sprinkled cheese on this and added source cream as a finish.  YUM!

Not much flavor considering all the ingrediants. The corn tortillas fell apart when I stuffed with the shrimp mixture. I added a black bean and corn pico salsa and avocado for flavor, but it was still pretty bland. I think marinating the shrimp would have helped. Not a bad meal, just not what I expected.

I was a bit nervous about using chipotle peppers since I dont like very spicy foods, but these were very good.  I cut the recipe in half and used frozen cooked medium shrimp and only one pepper.  I also used packaged bacon bits.  In addition, I made chipotle mayo to smear on the tortillas before adding the shrimp mixture.    Avocado would have put this over the top, but I didnt have any....next time!

These were AWESOME!!!  I have never had shrimp tacos before and we LOVED them!  I made a coleslaw to go in them too.  Surprisingly the chipotles were pretty subtle in this and I even added about a teaspoon or 2 of the adobo sauce.  It's a good thing though because my husband and I don't care for a really strong flavor of chipotle.  The lime squeezed over the top is a must!  VERY good tacos ;)

These tacos were great.  I made them exactly like the receipe said to except that I added more peppers (3 of us like things spicy).  I also made some in a separate pan without the onions and peppers for my picky eater and he loved it.  What can go wrong with bacon and shrimp in a taco shell!

I am in LOVE with this dish! When the shrimp and onion were done cooking, I added the lime, cilantro, and some chunky salsa to the pan to heat them. I ate it in a whole wheat tortilla. Perfection! Thanks for the amazing recipe, rvalesquez!

Got mixed reviews on these.  If you don't want them too spicy, cut down on the chipotles and use more adobo sauch instead.

Since we recently discovered we love chipotle, I've been making recipes that include it.  This dish did deliver great chipotle flavor, but it had a few flaws.  The biggest problem was that the shrimp mixture got very juicy.  The juices were the most flavorful part of the dish, but if you put them on the taco they would make the tortilla mushy.  So we kind of ended up eating it as a soup instead.  A more minor problem, related to the first, was that the bacon was soggy.  I'll keep this recipe in mind the next time I want a flavorful soup.  I will add some vegetables and sprinkle bacon on top instead of stirring it in.

I was very surprise by this dish.  The tacos came out bite-sized & delishous; would be great finger-food for entertaining.  As written, there is a pretty strong spicy kick (almost too much for my wife)

Awesomely delicious!  This is a definite keeper!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  However, I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers & cooked the shrimp myself.  I felt I had more control over the finished product this way & didn't have to worry about the shrimp getting overcooked.  I also sliced some avocado to put in the tacos.  It was a fabulous addition.  My family loved this dish!

These were amazing! I used thick cut Amish-market turkey bacon since I don't eat pork. I also modified this to grill since it was way too hot for cooking inside. I marinated the shrimp in the chipotle, lime and cilantro while I soaked skewers. Then I threaded the shrimp, wrapped in bacon alternated with quartered onions and grilled til the shrimp were done. I tossed the tortillas on the grill for a few minutes to warm them and then squeezed extra lime on the plate of shrimp. WOW!

Loved it!!! Used 1lb (approximately 40 shrimp) of frozen shrimp, 8 oz of bacon, and 2 chipotle peppers. I thought the spice level was just about right, though we love spicy and I cook with chipotle in adobo frequently! This created 8 tacos, 5 shrimp per taco. Added cilantro, more onion, shredded cabbage, and a squeeze of lime, delicious!!

These are delicious!  I did not have the chipotle peppers, and I made the sauce from the "Lime Chicken with Cilantro Cream Sauce and Roasted Zucchini" recipe to serve with it along with some chopped cherry tomatoes and avocado.  They were a HUGE hit.  My husband said they were my best ever.  Not bad for stumbling on this recipe while searching for something to do with my leftover cooked shrimp.  (Btw, I cooked my shrimp by boiling them for just a few minutes. When they were done, I added a little bit of lemon juice.)  Fortunately the shrimp didn't become overcooked when I added them to the bacon, but I was careful not to leave them on the heat for too long.  Make 'em - they're great!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  Just be careful with the chipotle peppers - sometimes they are very spicy and other times much more mild!  Nothing better than these little shrimps with fresh guacamole tucked into a fresh, homemade tortilla.

We really enjoyed these. My kids, of course, kept saying they wish the tortillas were flour. I used frozen shrimp and fresher would have been much better. The lime and cilantro made them fabulous.

Made these for the Superbowl, they were good, but I think I am going to opt for flour tortillas instead of corn the next time.

DELISH...as is, but the next time, I will leave out the bacon. I will marinate the shrimp in the adobo/or chipolte sauce. blend together sour cream, cilantro and lime juice (blender). Saute shrimp til they are ready, place on tortilla and top with a dallop of sr. cream mixture...

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments but all in all I folowed it exactly and have no complaints. I baked the bacon in the oven, used the grease for the shrimp and then crumbled the crisp bacon over the top of the tacos. This one has endless possibilities. Thanks for the great recipe!

this was a great tasting taco couple things i did different i marinated shrimp with adobo sauce and lime juice...i did not add anymore chipotle's to the shrimp as it was hot enough, but if you like it REALLY hot, then add more... and before assembling it all together i spread a mixture of sour cream, 1 chipotle and lime juice, little sugar added and spread that on a flour tortilla, added a little red cabbage, and wrapped it all up....  very very good, i will be making this again and again outstanding!!!!!

These were absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were using flour tortillas instead of corn (personal taste) and cutting down on the peppers (hubby isn't a fan of spicy).  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was quick and fantastic.

This was great!  I did cut the recipe in half, used 1 1/2 chipotles, and yes - it was pretty spicy (but just right).  I used sliced avocado and a tiny bit of mexican cheese to top the soft tacos.  Very good - will absolutely be making this again!

Really really good! I followed the advise of another reviewer and marinated the shrimp in the adobo sauce with juice of 2 limes for about an hour. Did everything else the same as the recipe. I used three chilies and it was plenty hot for us!

Marinated the shrimp in lime juice, garlic, adobo sauce overnight.  Fried up the bacon, onions, and shrimp together.  Decided to use crunchy corn shells instead of the soft corn.  The cilantro and lime topped it off perfectly.  Will be making this again.  Excellent flavors!

Love this reipe.I suggest just marinating the shrimp in the sauce and some lime juice for 30 min. Came out with just the right amount of heat without the chipotle peppers.

Wow--I rarely rate a recipe with five stars but this one was a pleasant surprise.  I made the recipe exactly as is although I may have cut down on bacon by a third. I was very leary of using bacon in the recipe but it added a tremendous flavor. I used three peppers which I thought made it with some heat but did not over power them. I also used the cilantro and the lime as suggested which were a great addition.  As an extra topping, I sliced avocados and had colby-jack cheese as a choice if my family wanted it.

These were really good! Just incredibly spicy. Prep time was significantly longer for me, though, as I had to fry all the bacon and I didn't have precooked shrimp. 

I served with rice on the side.

These shrimp were amazing! I used chipotle sauce instead of the peppers in adobo because of cost, but it coated all of the shrimp nicely.  The bacon brought in a smoky taste and the onion added a hint of sweetness.  The only other thing I would change would be to serve this ove rice.  The tortillas were to bulky for my and masked the flavors of the shrimp.

My SO and I made these tonight and they are fabulous!  I followed the recipe and only added a few spoonfuls of the adobo sauce from the canned chipotles.

We prefer flour tortillas warmed on a cast iron griddle.

We had it with fresh steamed broccoli on the side and added slices of avocado and tomato to the tacos.  We also topped the tacos with homemade roasted tomatillo salsa..... 

I'll be making these again soon!

These were very good.  I did make a couple changes though.  I used a heaping tablespoon of diced jalapenos, because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a can of black beans and omitted the bacon to lower the cholesterol.  Topped them with shredded lettuce and tomatoes.  It was quick, easy and good!

I made these last night and they were great.  I did however use raw shrimp and saute them after the bacon and onions in a little of the bacon grease which gave it a good flavor.  My husband said it was a keeper!  Great Job!!!

This was fabulous!!!!  I loved the extra dimension that the bacon added!  I used shrimp and tilapia because I didn't have enough of either so mixed it up!  I served them with pico de gallo and a little sour cream.  This will be a regular at my house!!

I modified this recipe just a little, based on other reviews.  I used 31/40 raw shrimp, marinated them in a large can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (discarded the peppers and just used the sauce), a tsp of chopped garlic, juice from 2 limes, a few sprigs of cilantro,2 tbsp. flour and a generous pinch of cayenne pepper.  I marinated the shrimp for 30 min, then cooked in a skillet until done.   I did not include the bacon or onions.  Served the shrimp in soft corn tortillas with avocado slices, cilantro, lime juice and sour cream.  DELICIOUS!!!

I don't know, I was expecting something fresh and vibrant, and it just came out kind of muddled. I think 12 oz of bacon was way too much. Also based on other reviews cut the chipotle pepper down to just one, and I scraped the seeds out of it. Thank goodness! It was perfectly spicy with just the one, it would have been way too hot with more.

FANTASTIC!!!  I halved everything but the chipotle peppers since it was just the two of us.  (Freeze the remaining chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for future use.)  We added sliced ripe tomato, sliced avocado and some low-fat sour cream.  It was so easy to prepare and tasted delicious!  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe, rvelasquez!

These are amazing!! My family begs me to make them over and over. On ours we add fresh pico de gallo, mangos and avocados. My step father was against the mangos but once I convinced him to try them he won't eat them any other way.

Excellent recipe.  Used fresh peeled and deveined shrimp instead of cooked/frozen.   Cooked them to almost done before putting in chile.  Also lightly pan-fried the tortillas using pam so they are a little sturdier and don't fall apart.  Garnished w/avocado, along w/cilantro & fresh squeezed lime juice.  Also made it again, using stir fried chicken breast strips instead of shrimp.  Also excellent!

My boyfriend and I made these last night for a dinner party with my parents...they were a big hit!! My bf was skeptical at first, bacon isn't a common ingredient in shrimp tacos, but it turned out really yummy. We followed the recipe to a T....insted of corn tortillas though we used wholewheat tortillas, and threw on some sour cream and homemade guac. Awesome!

This was really simple and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. The 3 chipotle peppers definitely give it some heat, but not too much. I made a slaw from a fish taco recipe with shredded cabbage, lime juice, diced tomato, green onions, cilantro, olive oil and salt and piled it on top of the shrimp. Delicious!

These were delicious, but we omitted the bacon. For the filling, we used 1/2 lb. shrimp, 1 tilapia fillet, and we added a pouch of Uncle Ben's whole grain rice to the mixture. We also added scallions. We used too many chipotle peppers, and it was EXTREMELY spicy. I think next time we may just use a small can of green chilis.

Yikes.  I had high hopes for this b/c of all the great reviews but this just wasn't good.  Not sure if it was the adobo sauce stuff or the bacon but it just didn't mesh well together.

Outstanding! Followed exactly as written, served with the cilantro cream sauce recipe also found on the site; and was able to impress my hubby (he's a meat market manager and relatively challenging to surprise). Served with a nice, crisp white wine-no side dishes needed. Many thanks for sharing!

O-M-G!!!! These were fantastic! I followed the recipe exact except that I didn't use the cilantro...I just do not like the taste of it. You definitely need to add the lime juice..it enhances the flavor of the tacos. I also added a few tablespoons of the adobo sauce to the bacon mixture as it was cooking. Great smoky/spicy flavor. I served them with guacamole and sour cream. This recipe is a keeper!! Thank you!!!

These tacos are amazing!  Marinated them in the sauce from one can of adobo along w/ one minced pepper and juice of one lime and a little flour.  Used one lb shrimp, 1/2 pack bacon, 1/2 onion.  Served with homemade corn tortillas, fresh pico de gallo, avacodo and sour cream!  I could sell these things!!

I only thought these were ok, but my husband has been raving about them.  Beware that the chipotle peppers are pretty hot.  We bought some mango peach salsa and added that on top.  My only complaint was that the bacon, although adding a nice smokey flavor,  also added an odd crunchy texture that didn't seem to go with the rest of the mixture.  I think I'd leave it out next time.

Very good dish, although with 2 pounds of shrimp and 3/4 pound of bacon this filled a lot more than 12 normal sized corn tortillas.  I did add some cole slaw to the tacos, so that may explain why this stretched further than recipe suggested.    As a person who likes spicy food, I found that three chipotles was just right finely diced.

These are an awesome idea for a quick dinner!  I have made them with and without the bacon, and can't say I noticed a difference, and we started adding cabbage for a little texture.  Great recipe!

These are delicious! I added some garlic when cooking the bacon+onions, then added diced avocados and a squirt of chipotle mayo to the tacos. They had some heat but they were really tasty, will be making these again!

Followed the recipe exactly (using raw shrimp) and topped off the tacos with pico de gallo - delicious!! Next time I'll probably use 1lb to 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp rather than 2 lbs. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out really good. Before making it my dad and brother were skeptical about Shrimp Tacos. They liked them after they eat them. I didn't have the peppers, I used some good quality salsa instead. It was very juicy.

So easy to make and my family loved them. I added fresh avocado and shredded cheese in the taco. 3 chipotle peppers was a perfect amount of spice for us. Don't leave out the lime juice!

These are HOT!!!!  They have a spicy, smokey flavor that goes well with the bacon.  I used a fraction of the amount of pepper, and it was still too hot for us.  We used sour cream to temper the heat.  Fresh cilantro and lots of lime are key to this recipe.

Very good and very spicy!  We had it with cheese, sour cream and guacamole which really cut down on the heat.

I loved this recipe! I got a little carried away with the chilis and added 4.5 instead of 3 and boy was it hot. I only used half the bacon to reduce fat but found this very tasty!

Yummy! I ate so much! The lime and cilantro was key. I only used 2 small peppers and all the sauce in the chipotle can. The three would not have been too much. I added garlic powder to give it a little extra kick. I recommend it!

Very Good!  I reduced the peppers to 2 and seeded which was the perfect amount of heat and reduced the bacon by 1/2. I spread the tortilla with a small amount of homemade tarter sauce (pickle, cappers, mayo and  lemon juice) and topped with cabbage tomatoes and guacamole .  YUUUUUUM!

This was very good, but very spicy and my family likes spicy.  Next time I will cut back to one chipotle pepper in adobo. I also served this with a homemade salsa verde.

It was really hot. I don't know if it's because we used the jalapeno hot sauce on them or if it was the adobo sauce but they were hot. I couldn't stop eating them though.

This was excellent. I scaled it down a bit for just myself and my husband. Used 1 lb of raw shrimp, 2 peppers, 1/4 of onion, and 4 slices of bacon.  This is a keeper!!

This is a great recipe as long as you scrap the seeds out of the chipotle peppers. Otherwise, it's way too hot to enjoy.

Made these for my son who is home for a summer visit.  We both loved them.  I marinated raw shrimp in the juice of 2 limes, garlic and adobe sauce for about an hour (the shrimp turned a little pink around the edges from the lime juice).  After I cooked the bacon and drained off the grease I added the onions and a fresh from the garden bell pepper.  I added the shrimp and when they were pink I added the chipolte and cooked for a bit longer.  To finish it off I added about 1/4 cup sour cream, covered and let it cook down slowly while steaming the tortillas on top of the shrimp mixture.  So flavorful.  Served with both corn and flour tortillas, fresh pico, guacamole, limes and the  Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce from this site.  Will make again and again.  Leftovers were great and my son has requested I make them again before he goes back home.  Love these tacos.  Thanks rvelasquez!!

This recipe was so easy to make and delicious!!  I took the easy way out and just marinated the shrimp in Lawry's Baja Chipotle w/ Lime Juice Marinade and finely chopped a jalapeno pepper with the bacon and onion.  I never had a taco that tasted great without the tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, etc...this was it!

Really was tasty and yes, it'll become a repeat!  Only changes: I thought there was too much bacon and will cut it down next time.  Also, marinated the shrimp in adobo sauce, juice of 2 limes, salt, and eliminated the chilies (per another's suggestion) and it was still spicy. And you need to use large tortillas.

Wow.  I made this with no bacon, sauce only from 1 can of chipotle, and 2lbs shrimp. I sauteed onion first then added shrimp. Served with avacado, lime, cilantro.  Awesome and easy!

deeeeee-licious!  I added about a teaspoon of cumin to shrimp mixture to kick up the mexican-y-ness.  I also mixed in the chopped fresh cilantro.  I served my tacos with lt. sour cream, chopped onions, MORE chopped cilantro, and sliced avocado.  Kids (3 & 6) and hubby LOVED this meal.  Although it is firmly ensconced in my 'yummy-box', I am going to try it with HALF the bacon so's I don't feel guilty about serving it (often) to mi familia...  Thanks rvelasquez.

I came home today wanting to make some different tacos.  OMG, these were fantanstic.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe, maybe added some extra adobo sauce.  IT'S HOT!  You missed a couple taco necessities I thought that are always nice.  Shredded cheese on the taco along with some lettuce and tomato can help mild out the flavor, and make it the best darn taco I've ever eaten:)  Thanks for the recipe....I will cherish it always

I think these will be a five if I marinate the shrimp properly and cook myself. I just used frozen already cooked shrimp, and it was still delicious.

This was so flavorful and easy. I omitted the bacon; instead I used a dried chipotle in addition to the adobo peppers, which added a delicious smoky flavor and just the right amount of spice. I also doubled the (red) onion and caramelized it‚Äînext time, I‚Äôll use a little more. To the taco, I added shredded red cabbage mixed with a honey/lime/cumin dressing, and it was a perfect complement. Next time, I‚Äôll add fresh guac.

I followed the modified "restaurant" version that the reviewer below me added.  I neglected the bacon in order to make it more of a low fat dish.  I've loved this dish so much that I've made it several times now in the last few weeks.  I also added my own home made salsa and guacamole to the dish, covered it in some cheese, and cooked it in the oven to make my own version of enchiladas.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

This recipe was soooo goood!  I added one more pepper than what was called for and it had a great kick, which is how we like it.  We also served these with a dollup of sour cream and chopped avacado which helped to cut the spice perfectly.  We'll keep this around and make for company the next time!

Before I made this, I read other people's reviews and saw that many thought that the dish was not spicy enough. Therefore I used 3/4 of the shrimp it the recipe called for and the total chipotle peppers. It was HOT! my lips were burning half way through the dish. I would have given the recipe higher ratings, but my flavor was 100% chipotle peppers, abd the thing that made it better was my own mango salsa recipe.

This is a great recipe, I don't always use bacon, but it is a good addition to change up the flavor a bit.  I use red onion & not too many of the chipotle peppers, depending on how hot you like it!

did not use Chipotle sause, instead used chili powder, salt, lemon pepper & lemon juice.  Added avocado over the cilantro, next time I might add Fresco Cheese... WE all loved it.

This meal was totally enjoyable I Followed the recipe and ate it all myself the bacon gives it a very unique flavor so I would recommend probably using good bacon and I would probably increase the onion content other than that I loved it.

I took out the chipotle peppers and just used the adobo sauce in the mixture. Next time I make it I would not add the lime juice.

Made it tonight, awesome!  Used frozen cooked  shelled shrimp with tail on. Removed tail and cut in half. Found 7 oz can of Chipotle Peppers in Adobo sauce, pulled out 4 peppers and diced up with sauce, which was maybe half can. Perfect spice for us. Followed everything else as directed.  This is a keeper and will be served at next party we host.

Yay!  What a nice way to use up all the shrimp I bought for lent (kids were getting sick of variations of pasta fresca with shrimp...)  Very tasty, I did follow one reviewers recommendation to marinate the shrimp.  Because of my kids, I didn't add any actual peppers, but just used the adobo sauce, which was plenty spicy, but obviously that's per your preference.  I cooked the bacon and onions separate and then cooked the marinated shrimp in the bacon grease for 4 minutes.  Warm corn tortilla, shrimp, pico, cilantro, bacon/onion, squeeze of lime, dash of salt, 2 thin slices of avocado--that's how we served ours and they were perfect!  SUPER fast, SUPER easy, SUPER delicious!

I made half of the recipe, as written, because I only had 1 lb. of medium shrimp.  I think I should've used more adobo sauce because it seemed too dry in the end.  Next time I will try using flour tortillas, since, even though I prefer corn tortillas, they don't hold together.  I thought these tacos had a good flavor and really liked the tang of lime juice.

Corn tortillas fell apart too easily -I think flour tortillas would work just fine. I would cut the chipotle peppers down to 1 or 2-was too spicy for my taste. I would also add lettuce or shredded cabbage for texture .

I Had no chipotle in adobo sauce .  Didnt think to just use jalapenos and then add chipotle space.  I got a more mild pepper instead.  Next time, I will def use jalapenos or the chipotles.  It was great but could be more spicy without them.  I would probably use only half the bacon next time to be healthier.

My husband I both loved this. Although, it was a little spicy for the kids. Next time I'll reserve a portion or two to another pan and cut back on the adobe peppers.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe countless times.  The first time I made it, I included the bacon and we felt the bacon flavor was overpowering the shrimp (and we do love bacon!).  So now, I skip the bacon (and the mess!) and make the recipe as instructed.  It's delicious every time.  I found the chipotle peppers can vary in heat so sometimes 3 are VERY hot, and sometimes 3 are fairly mild.  Either way it's delicious.  We also top our tacos with avocado.

Really easy and good.  Not sure I would miss the bacon if it weren't there, however I did leave a bit of the bacon drippings in the pan.  Served very simply with sliced avocado, lime wedges and a bit of lime crema sour cream (just sour cream mixed with lime juice and a little cumin).  We'll be having this again.

i love this recipe and want to add that i get one of the chipotle peppers and blend with a small tub of sour cream in the blender. then I add a splash of lime juice to the mix and put inside the taco.  i like using the Mexican sour cream since it is easier to drizzle over the tacos. this can be used when less peppers are used in the pan when cooking shrimp if you prefer it to not be so spicy overall....but i personally love the intensity. delicious!!

Very good!  My only complaint is that the crispy bacon turned squishy after sitting in the liquid. Which is unavoidable because of the watery shrimp. Very good though!

Good base recipe.  You can add just about anything you like.  I use less chipotle because I am a wimp, just stuff the shells with any fresh veggies I have on hand.  Very good.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except bought a jar of already minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and estimated the amount. Served with pico, guacamole and sour cream with lime juice squeezed on top. The whole family loved it!

Made it exactly per recipe.  I am not sure it needed  the bacon as it seemed to get lost in the Adobe sauce.  Added avacado for creaminess.

I will try it again but would not double the tortilla again unless I add a layer of retried beans between them to hold them together. Followed the suggestion to marinate the shrimp in adobo sauce and lime and a smidge of flower. We added quacamole to the taco and on side plus corn and rice. Maybe add a little slaw to the top.

I made this with a few changes and really liked it. The combination of bacon and honey butter is wonderful with the shrimp. Marinated the shrimp in some lime juice, garlic and cumin before saut√©ing them. I also added a diced jalape√±o pepper to the butter. I topped the tacos with shredded cabbage doused with a little juice and a bit of salt, diced red onion, diced avocado, and the Baja Fish sauce from another recipe.

I prepared the tacos as directed, and I still would not change a thing.  My hubby is a taco lover, while I am a shrimp lover.  I made these tacos for dinner and my husband simply stated, "You have outdone yourself. These tacos are awesome."
Married 20 years, never said I had "outdone" myself.  I will take that as a huge success.  I will make them again.

Delicious! I followed another review and mixed together the chipotle adobo sauce (couldn't find the peppers in sauce), fresh minced garlic, chopped onion, minced ginger, chopped cilantro, red pepper flakes, flour and canola oil. Then I marinated the raw deveined shrimp in this mixture for 30-40 minutes. Then I cooked the shrimp in a bit more canola oil and placed on warmed corn tortillas with lettuce and the rest of the fresh cilantro with some lemon squeezed on top (didn't have a lime). The marinade worked really well and turned out just spicy enough to be balanced by the tortilla and lettuce.  Will definitely make this again!

Loved this simple recipe.  I omitted the bacon and marinated the shrimp in the adobo for at least 30 minutes.  Added tomatoes, guacamole and mixed greens for a more hearty, healthy taco.  Delicious!

This recipe is so delicious! I've used both the canned chipotle in adobo sauce and chilies with chipotle pepper powder added. We usually add some garlic too just because we love garlic. Such a yummy taco!!

Spicy succulent shrimp tacos with bacon goodness! I added a touch of cumin and topped with fresh salsa, red shredded cabbage and thinly sliced radishes with lime. So good!

I've made this again and again. The cilantro and lime are delicious with the shrimp. It tastes fresh and light, but it's filling. Perfect for summer, but we have them year-round. I always have leftover chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so I put them in a small Mason jar in the refrigerator, and they last for months...maybe years...I've used them up before then.

This dish was nothing short of amazing! I used half the amount of Chipotle peppers in Adobe sauce and it still had quite a bit of heat! Also, I added the lime juice and cilantro right into the skillet for the last minute or two of cooking. Delicious!

Hands down one of the best shrimp tacos recipe I have ever cooked.  I marinated my shrimp for 30 minutes in the adobo sauce, juice from 2 limes, and 1 TB of flour.  I cooked 1lb of shrimp instead of 2 but kept the sauce mix the same because we like things extra saucy.  I garnished with avocado, cilantro, lime, sliced cherry tomatoes and ray onion.  YUM!!  My boyfriend loved it!!

I thought it was great! I only used one chipotle pepper and it was plenty spicy (so much that my kids wouldn't eat it any of the shrimp without an extra dousing of lime juice). I added raw sliced red onions and kept thinking how a little queso fresco would have put these over the top! Wish I would have had some on hand!

This recipe was very tasty. I followed the recipe but because I was cooking for one, I made 1/3 of the original recipe. Next time, I will cut the bacon in half. It adds great flavor but you don't need so much to get the same effect. The cilantro and lime with the chipotle are excellent.

These tacos were yummy! The chipotle peppers added a nice kick but weren't too spicy for my younger kids. I left out the lime because my family doesn't like the bitterness.

These were delicious, although super spicy. I LOVE spicy foods, but I'm definitely going to use a little less peppers next time. It was almost at the point of too hot to taste. Added some avocado into the tacos to bring down the spice a bit.

I have to say, I was very skeptical about this recipe.  I was worried it would be scorching hot (as I've used a smidgeon of the chiptole adobe in stuff and found it over the top).  Surprisiingly..after only using one chiptole pepper, I went back and added the other two.  Also, I didn't think there would be enough "sauce" to add flavor or cover the shrimp...but it worked just great!  The lime really is the key to cutting the heat and leaving mostly flavor!

This deserves 10 stars!!!  This is by far one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.  My husband and daughters absolutely love this dish.  I have made it twice in the past 7 days.  The only thing I do different is I add the cilantro and half of the lime juice to the pan after I add the shrimp.  Wonderful!!!!  Thanks so much for sharing

These are awesome! I made this recipe for my husband and he amazed!  If you are not use to eating spicy food you may want to pull back on the chipotle to 1 1/2 or 2.  We eat spicy and they were a bit HOT for us, but we did manage to make them disappear.

These were so easy! We left out the bacon and used a little vegetable oil for the onions. I took the advise if others and didn't use as much chipotle peppers to avoid it being too hot. However, it could have used more. Overall, a wonderful dish!!!

We love these in our house.  They can be very spicy if you are not careful.  I always serve ours on corn tortillas with sour cream that is mixed with lime juice and a little of the adobo sauce from the chipotles and shredded cabbage.

Wow! I didn't know that something so simple could taste so good. I've made several recipes with this level of taste, but I spent at least an hour in preparation. I added 3 tbls liquid smoke to onions while cooking for more of a smokey flovor.

REALLY? REALLY? My hubby and I LOVE hot but this was HOT with only one flavor!  You mise well just put a bunch of canned chipotle peppers in a corn tortillas with a spash of lime and cilantro and call itl dinner!  It was only one flavor and so fricken spicy that i can't believe that anyone would think this was a good meal!  My hubby and I grow our own VERY hot peppers but this was not only hot but just tasted like a canned pepper in a corn tortilla....if you look at my profile you will see that i have rated almost TWO HUNDRED recipes from this site and I have never even given a 2*...this has got to be the most disappointing recipe I have tried from this site!!!  Sorry for such a bad rating!

These were really good, I'm not usually a shrimp person and I still really liked them! I used small shrimp because they were on sale and added sliced avocado. The next day I made a dip by mixing the leftovers (minus the lime and cilantro) into a cream cheese/sour cream mixture. That was even better than the tacos!

This meal was great! I do plan to make it again but it was a bit too spicy for me!  The next time I make it I will use less chipotle chiles and add some pico or a light salsa because it needed a little something extra.  I made it with cilantro lime rice and it went quite well together.  i also didnt use the whole two pounds...i think one lb would do and maybe half a pack of bacon.

SUCH a good recipe!  I wanted something light and different and this was it!  Very simple and quick to make.  Served this with white rice and put lime juice and cilantro on that as well.  A cold beer would've been perfect with this!

These were wonderful!  Next time I'll use less bacon and more chipotle peppers to suit our tastes.  Topped with a slice of avocado to cut heat a bit - will be making these again and again.  Super quick and easy!!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my hubby said it was one of the "top 5" meals I have ever made (served with homemade guacamole and homemade tortilla chips on the side). I used 8 chipotle peppers as opposed to 3 and next time I will use all of them. It had a nice amount of heat, which we love. The guacamole on the side was a nice compliment to the spicy as it cooled it down.

Marinated the shrimp in the lime and chipotle. I only used 1/2 the amount of bacon because I used a thick good quality maple bacon. Really good. Really easy. My cilantro isn't really producing that much right now so I was skimpy on it. Definitely needs all the fresh taste that cilantro delivers.

Perfectly delicious and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly give or take a bacon strip.  I also added homemade salsa, avocado and lettuce (arugula and some other baby lettuce blend)...so good!  My husband loved it too....we had it with the best black beans from this site.....total winner!

These were sooo good! I marinated the shrimp in the adobo sauce and lime juice with a little bit of garlic powder and ground black pepper. I used green onions and reserved some of the bacon fat to soften the tortillas, which I warmed up in the microwave between two damp paper towels. I served them with extra lime juice, avocado, cilantro and a sprinkle of salt. YUM!

Yowza! Really, really hot - but I did marinate the shrimp in chipotle sauce for an hour AND included the minced chipotle peppers.  I think next time I'll leave one or the other out.  Regardless, I still thought these were fantastic.  My only real complaint is that the tacos were a little bare, even with the sour cream I added. I think next time I'll include either guacamole or some type of lettuce or slaw. Don't let the heat scare you off - really tasty!

after using batter fried shrimp for tacos for MANY years i decided it was time for something different and thats when i decided to look for a different recipe and boy am I glad i did!!! this has become a favorite in my household. I have done this recipe several times and it tasted great everytime!! The only thing i did different was i added all the peppers (from the smallest can) and instead of chopping them i blended them with a can full of water and it seemed to take some of the spice away and they werent as dry as the first time!!! Topped with fresh guacamole .......... and these are the best shrimp tacos ever!!!

Delicious as is, phenomenal when served with sour cream and Mexican cheese on flour tortillas instead of corn!  The fresh lime is a must, we served them with extra lime wedges, too.

This was soooo good.  I believe the prep time is more than 15 minutes with all the cutting that has to be done and preparing of the shrimp.  A really good low-fat replacement for the bacon is to use turkey bacon.  Still came out really good....and the hubby loved it!!!

We agree; way too hot.  The rest of the ingredients were fine.  We would use the shrimp/bacon/onion mix again, but add our own toppings.

We had high hopes for this recipe, given the great reviews, but thought it was just okay.  The spiciness & heat of the chipotle WAY overpowers every other flavor in the recipe.  Once in a while you got a hint of bacon or a hint of shrimp but mostly you just tasted the chipotle.  Too strong of a spice for the delicate flavor of the shrimp IMO.  Sorry.

FANTASTIC!!  This was so good!  My husband rated it a 10! The flavors together were so tasty. I served it with sour cream and a side of mexican rice. This recipe is a keeper. Easy & tasty. Try it!

WOW! My mom and husband could not rave enough about how great this dish was... I marinated the shrimp in some adobe sauce (from the can of chipotle peppers), lime juice, minced garlic and onion powder in a large ziploc bag for about an hour.  I topped the tacos with avocado and sour cream, which really pulled it all together. Leave out the peppers and just use the sauce if you are worried about the spice level. A must try!

Soooooo good!  My bf and I loved this!  I only used one pound of shrimp and I added 1/2 C of cilantro salsa and a small can of corn (drained) to the shrimp while it was cooking.  Perfect!

Very tasty. Spice according to your taste... cayenne if necessary, but taste first if it's your first time using the canned chipotle in adobo sauce.

These were delicious! I excluded the bacon and substituted whole wheat for corn tortillas and it was still amazing.

Good stuff!  Very fresh tasting, don't forget to garnish with the cilantro, lime and salt.  It took me back to Mexican vacation =)

I made this for dinner tonight and it was easy and good.  I did use some oil and sprinkle shrimp with salt, tossed before adding to the pan.  I bought an avocado which I sliced thinly and added once I put the shrimp on the tortilla.  The cilantro and lemon squezzed on top was the final touch.  Next time I will get some ff sour cream and add a tad.  It was great!  Thanks for the recipe ;-)

These were just alright.  I prefer fish tacos over these.
