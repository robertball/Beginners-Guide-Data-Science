i used my bread maker to make the dough, and used a can of poppy seed filling, to which i added some walnuts, orange peel, and some cream. i agree, the filling ingredients look wrong - i think the best bet would be to add cream until you get a good spreading consistency (which is what i did with the canned filling) but i'm afraid not enough people read the comments before making the recipe. i think the 16 hours 40 minutes might include time for the dough to rise - i read another recipe, and they recommended letting the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight, which could explain the long time.

The dough is wonderful.  The filling, I am sure has the wrong measurments.  2 cups of cream is way to much.  Its too watery.  Also it says it takes 16 hours and 40 minutes to make?  what??  I think there are some typing errors, in this recipe.

This recipe is similar to our poppy seed buns.  We use white poppy in our filling.  It is fabulous!
