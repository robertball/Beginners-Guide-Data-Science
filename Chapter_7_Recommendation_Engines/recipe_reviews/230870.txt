These were very easy to make and they taste delicious. They are also very versatile so you won't get tired of the same flavor over and over again. They remind me of Larabars. I will use their flavors as ideas to make my own versions at home. I used raw whole almonds and pecans instead of cashews. I did add the coconut oil because it's good for you, but it doesn't need it hold together. The oil from the nuts is more than enough. Also, the dates make it sticky. The key here is to let the food processor go on(times will vary depending on the power of your processor) until the ingredients come together and form a ball. If you don't process the ingredients long enough, your mix might not stick together. Next time, I will skip the coconut oil because it made it a bit too greasy for me. Also, I might add unsweetened dried cherries or other fruits. Update: DO NOT add the oil. Even without the oil, the bars are oily/sticky enough. I made them again but folded in some dark chocolate mini chips and some chopped pecans to give it texture. Wow! Excellent. I'll add in some chopped almonds and some chopped dried cranberries or cherries next. Another idea would be dried apples and cinnamon...with or without raisins... Macadamias and white chocolate (though white chocolate isn't healthy, just add a bit)... Dried pineapples and mangoes... The possibilities are endless!!

I made 4 double patches today, different combos of extras, they are all great!  You do need to pulse and/or run the food processor at least 2 or more minutes to get to the ball state.  I used a combo of Medjool and Deglet Noor dates, since the medjools are more expensive but as another reviewer pointed out are more moist and sticky.  I combined the coconut (half unsweetened), whole almonds, and dates in the processor then mixed in the extras by hand, literally.  I too left out the oil, although did coat my hands with it to press the dough.  I made Almond with Choc Chip with sliced almonds and mini chips, Cashew Cranberry and Chia, and Pecan Cherry.  Having the chunks of the fruit and nuts mixes up the texture a bit.  To form bars I lined a loaf tin with plastic wrap and then pressed in the dough, turned it out and then cut into pieces without refrigerating first.  Put into plastic bags to make a quick grab and go snack. A double batch made 10 squares about 1/2 to 3/4 in thick.  Will be making these for a long time to come!!  Perfect gluten free snack!  With more time I'd like to try some additional flavorings like spices or peels.

Very tasty. Without a photo by lacy, the recipe submitter, and limited guidance (“pulse until mixture is thick and sticks together”), it’s hard to know how fine or coarse a texture she intended these bars to have. In preparing this review, a photo by lacy was found in her member photo gallery which gives a good representation as to size if recipe is followed. Making the recipe exactly as written and after processing the ingredients, the uncut square was no larger than half the size of the square shown in a 2/21/13 photo by LatinaCook. Given this 4 servings recipe, the unprocessed nuts and coconut equal about 1 cup for 4 servings, and after processing, about 1/8 cup of processed mixture + 2-1/2 dates per serving. For those with a Vitamix blender, the combined ingredients do not form enough mixture to work with as it sticks to the side of the blender, barely above the blade, and the tamper tool can’t reach it. Next time making these, I’ll at least double the recipe as that would probably provide a sufficient amount of mixture to process with a Vitamix or to justify the time involved in cleaning the food processor. I’ll also eliminate the coconut oil as the nuts and oil deliver a lot of fat for a relatively small sized bar.

I made these twice and they are very crumbly.  They don't look as pictured.  I tried microwaving the dates, and adding more dates to soften the bars.  They taste delicious, but I'm using it as a topping instead.

We made two batches. The first batch we made with half dates half figs. We did this because we felt our dates were 'dry'. This batch was very moist  and we liked the flavor but we felt like we might have processed them too much as there was very little texture.  The second batch was so much better. We used only the dates, and added dried cranberries, and eliminated the oil like someone suggested - and we eliminated the cashews. We waited and added the cranberries and almonds last- and barely processed them- this made the bar more pleasing to the eye ( seeing the chunks of nuts and berries). The second batch was perfect and we are currently planning our next variations choosing different dried fruits and nut combinations. LOVE this recipe!

I make a similar recipe using choc. chips instead of coconut to give it a little sweetness - the end result tastes just like cookie dough! Delicious and healthy snack when you`re on the run.

I added dried cranberries, flax and chia, walnuts and sunflower kernels. Kind of threw together what I had. My husband needed them for a school survival trip. His classmates raved!

My dates were dry so I heated them up with a bit of water in a pot on the stove before blending them in. 

Nutritious and delicious!

These are GREAT! So addictive, and a great substitute for expensive energy bars. I didn't add the coconut oil, but I did throw a few chocolate chips in, and they turned out wonderfully! I used a small food processor (it holds like two cups) and pulsed and ground the heck out of it until it was starting to stick together and ball up in the processor. Be patient, it took at least 60 two-second spins. Maybe the people having trouble with the recipe are using different dates? I used boxed, unpitted medjool dates, which are pretty sticky. I also spread the  mixture between two pieces of parchment paper and really pressed it together. I'm off to make a second batch with some different nuts! Thanks for the keeper, Lacy!

I use almost this exact recipe for my coconut date bars and would like to offer this suggestion to those finding the mixture too crumbly -- simply up the coconut oil to 1 tablespoon and add 1 tablespoon of water.(You can also cut back on the amount of nuts to help keep it pliable. I add 1/3 cup total of the nuts I put in my recipe.) Process in food processor until the mixture starts to come together, meaning it starts to form a single mass in your machine. I guarantee they will be moist and hold together beautifully for rolling into little date balls or forming into a log. You can also roll them in a little more coconut to make them less sticky while holding to eat. Enjoy!!!

I tried these on a whim when a friend gave me some dates. I only had 6 dates, but I followed the recipe otherwise. By the color of the bars in the picture, I think the bars would have held together much better if I had 10 or more dates. The bars did not hold together very well, but they did taste good. A very subtle sweetness, with the date flavor as an interesting after taste. I will try these again but maybe with some honey for extra hold.

On the Daniel Fast (grains, veggies, fruits, nuts) and prohibited from my weakness of cakes, pies, ice cream.  I discovered this recipe and was amazed at how sweet it is.  I am a serious sugar addict, but I am pretty sure I have found a way to curb my sugar thanks to these little bites.  My bars are more balls as they are round in shape, I found it easier to make them round.  Other amendments:  I did not have slivered almonds, so used whole almonds, which worked well in the food processor;  I did not have any coconut oil on-hand, but used avocado oil since it only required such a small amount (did not really taste the oil);  wrapped in plastic since I had no wax paper in the house.  The result was still deliciousness!

Delicious. After reading all the reviews, I doubled the recipe, skipping the oil because the reviews mentioned this. When the mix started getting crumbly in the blender, I added 1/4 cup of honey. Then it was too sticky, so I added about 1C oatmeal and 1/4C chia to help soak it up. Greasing, pan, hands, spatula, before trying to get the mix out of the blended is helpful. I pressed it into a brownie pan, sprinkled the top with chocolate chips and melted them in a 350 oven for 10 minutes. Spread the chocolate and chill. The layer of hardened chocolate helps hold everything together.

All I can say is "WOW!" I made these for my mother-in-law's birthday since she was on a cleanse and could not eat any allergens whatsoever. They were gone as soon as I unveiled them. Even the kids, ages 2-7, ate more than one each! What a great recipe for a delicious, healthy, nutritious desert or snack that is so easy to make. Will most definitely make over and over again. Thank you very much for sharing!

I LOVE these!  I started eating Paleo a few months ago and this has been a staple in my house ever since. They are insanely easy to make (with a decent food processor) and absolutely delicious.  I press mine into a small glass dish and they come out great.  A little crumbly if I don't press them firm enough or let them refrigerate long enough but even crumbly they're to die for!

I made these as written and they were fantastic! I used sweetened flaked coconut because it's all I had, but next time I'll make sure to use unsweetened as the dates make it plenty sweet.

I added protein powder, vanilla, cinnamon, dry oatmeal, ground psyllium and SF maple syrup. The "dough" was initially too oily, but crumbly. Adding more dry ingredients and syrup was the trick. I rolled them into balls. Turned out fantastic! Taste like a Larabar bite!

The taste was great... but this didn’t give me bars. It gave me crumbles.. what am i missing that would allow this to firm up in the fridge.. after 2 hours i still had crumbles. 

The coconut oil didn’t make the ingredients stick together to make a bar.

I love these! I followed the recipe but instead of making a square, I scooped out 1 TBSP flush packing it in and dropped it into a mini muffin tin to refrigerate. It made 12 bites! Perfect little snack!

So good and stops the sweets craving. I did not have all the ingredients, the store I was in only had sweetened flakes so I skipped that and used walnuts instead of the cashews because im just not a big fan of them. Anyways it turned out wonderful, I love it plan on using dried prunes next time instead of the dates. Thanks for the inspo

My husband asked to go on a VERY strict diet and this recipe fit the bill!  Easy to make and so good for him. He’s a shift worker which makes an added disadvantage for eating well. These take the edge off whenever he needs it.  So perfect

These are really good bars! I made the mistake of thinking that the recipe amount would fit into an 8x8 pan, however; and that resulted in paper thin bars! I instead pressed them into only half of the 8x8 pan, and that resulted in a bar with a decent thickness. So if you're wanting to be able to press this mixture into a pan, I would at least double (if not triple) the ingredients. I also added a pinch of salt and some vanilla extract. Would make these again, but probably in a double batch! Thank you!

A great snack and super easy to make.  I made it once with cashews and once with pecans instead of cashews.  Enjoyed both!

I've made these many times & the result is always the same... a delicious, naturally sweetened, healthy snack!   There are endless variations.  My favorite is to swap out some of the dates for dried cranberries.  I add the cranberries after the dates are somewhat mixed to maintain some intact pieces of cranberries. I also reduce the amount of coconut oil by half & add a pinch of salt.  They're best when just out of the fridge, but will be tasty at any temp making a great fuel source for running or hiking.

Tasty but falls apart and crumbles.  Tryed again cooking the date to help them hold better, they still fall apart.

Love these! I've made several variations, pecans, walnuts, almonds, raisins, fresh coconut in various combinations. All wonderful. Used my magic bullet to make one serving size at a time so I can change it up. Great treat! If I don't get enough dates it doesn't stick together but I just ate it with a spoon.

These were fast and easy. I used shredded coconut (purchased in frozen section of Indian grocery store), and the end result was extremely moist. (I'm guessing that reviewers who complained of dry and crumbly bars used desiccated coconut.) I omitted the oil; used whole raw almonds instead of sliced; added dried cherries; and processed the doubled recipe in a Vitamix.  Yummy.

I LOVE THESE!!! I doubled the dates. I put 20 dates instead of 10. 10 did not seem to be enough. I added a little bit of mini chocolate chips. This recipe inspired me to try adding all different ingredients. Maybe next time I'll try orange zest and dried cranberries. Maybe chia seeds and blueberries. The possibilities are endless. Thank you for this great recipe.

Just loved this recipe!  The first time I made them, I put all the ingredients in the processor and ground it all up.  Good, but the next time I made it, I pulsed everything (you need to pulse for awhile as the mixture will start to pull away from the bowl & it won't crumble on you) and then mixed by hand some golden raisins, chopped walnuts, diced dried apricots. This gives it a "chewy" texture.  I put in on wax paper then used my hands to shape into an long rectangular shape. You may want to double the recipe as just one doesn't make very many bars.  This is an excellent bar recipe & you can use all kinds of different dried fruits/nuts to it.

This is the BOMB!!!  Being on a Daniel Fast and eliminating sugar as well as other foods, this really takes care of that hunger pang and curbs the sweet tooth too.  I have made 2  double batches of this already.  Very yummy says everyone I ask to take a taste.

I needed double the amount of coconut oil to make it stick and it still was not as cohesive after chilling as I would like.   Next time I will soak the dates for a bit to make them extra soft and add some carob nibs for a nice kick.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using margarine instead of coconut oil (probably a mistake).  Based on reviews, I didn't process the ingredients long enough, and the result was very crumbly.  However, I did find them very tasty.  They have a much stronger coconut flavor than I expected, which is fine for me, but that means my husband won't like them.  The dates I used were fairly old and thus maybe were too dry to help the mixture stick together.   I will be trying this again with good medjool dates, no additional oil,  and hopefully will get a better result.  Oh, my only other concern, they didn't look like the picture at all.  I am somewhat doubtful that more pulsing will change that, but I could be wrong.

This was amazing! I used 1 cup of raisins instead of dates and put 1 heaping tablespoons of melted coconut oil in. Great if you can't have gluten and there are so many different variations you could make. Definitely making these again.

These bars are delicious.  I made these today for my Paleo step daughter. I think that I'll eat this batch and make her some more.  Recipe didn't specify about the coconut so I used one in the shell so as to avoid the processed sugar.  The end result was worth the effort of dealing with the coconut husk.

the picture shows added cranberries or raisins. I added them in after the blend for the chunks and used parchment paper to mold them down in the pan for easy removal- good snacking!
