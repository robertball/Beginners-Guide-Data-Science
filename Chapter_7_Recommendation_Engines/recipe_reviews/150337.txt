Yum!  This one is GOOD and EASY to make.  I misread the recipe and added the vinegar to the mango batch.  I decided not to let it sit overnight and I just cooked it on low for about an hour till it thickened.  I left it in the back of the fridge for a couple of days.  It doesn't have that golden colour (that was probably because I didn't properly caramelize the sugar) but it tastes great.  Very mild even though I doubled the chili.  I will make this again as it satisfied my craving for mango chutney.  Oh and I made the garlic ginger paste by putting the ingredients into a small food processor instead.  Thanks! Update:  2 weeks later and the flavours are amazing!!!!  I'm literally eating this out of a jar with a spoon.  The only problem with this recipe is the whole spices obviously aren't edible.  However they are essential as they make the chutney taste so good!  I'd suggest serving it in a separate bowl and picking out the spices before serving.

Finally found the perfect recipe for chutney we can use on everything! Thank you! 
Couple of questions: it takes me forever to make the ginger/garlic to form a smooth paste using a pestle and mortar - any suggestions?
Also, I have cardamom pods...but I cannot find just the seeds. Can I just break open the pods and use those seeds? I have been using cardamom powder...it must be all right because it tastes great! Thanks again!

Don't let the whole spices scare you off - the first time I made this I just used the powdered versions of the spices called for, and it was really, really good.   This time, I had access to whole spices and used them.  WOW!  Amazing flavor!  But you do have to pick out at least the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and cloves before serving.   Recipe is super easy and versatile, too.  I diced my mangoes and threw in a handful of raisins as well.  I think pineapple would also make a good addition too.  As others have said, if you like it hot, just add more pepper flakes as its mild enough for children as is.  I like my chutney mild to take the heat out of the Indian dishes I make, so this is perfect for me.    Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!  A keeper in my box!  :o)

I was more than a little dubious about leaving this out overnight to brew and I'm sure my neighbors smelled the garlic next door (no vampires in our house!), but the results are fantastic! I'm eating the chutney with a spoon right now while I write this. High praise indeed. I'll definitely make this again and have plans to gift it for Christmas. Thanks for sharing!

Zingy, sweet, spicy--just what a chutney should be!  A bit of initial preparation involved in this recipe, but is worth it when I handed the lovely little jars out for christmas presents! I used riper mangoes so cut down on sugar by 1/4 cup and it was perfect.  Because I hate my food processor, when making the paste of the garlic and ginger, I placed them in a mortar and pestle with the 1 teaspooon of coarse sea salt and then squashed them--the salt helps them break down!

I have used this recipe several times, and love it! It is really easy and so much better than the store bought chutney that I have tried.  The mangos in the store are not usually ripe so the recipe is perfect using green mangos. 2 thumbs up from me!!

Very good, milder than I normally like though - next time, I'll add more red pepper.

I used a habenaro flake instead of red pepper flakes as the boyfriend likes it hot. It was amazing and the recipe was easy except for the cost of the spices was a little stupid.

Not sure what happened here but I ended up with a runny, syrupy, unappetizing mess that I haven't even worked up the gumption to taste!  It was very thin and wasn't thickening at all so cooked for 1.5 hours, still didn't reduce....I followed the recipe to the letter.  Disappointing because it was quite a challenge getting all the spices necessary as  I live in a very remote place.  :(........ EDIT:  I just drained off alot of the liquid and processed the pulp through the food processor to break down the strips.....it is very very good and tasty.  Definately will make again, but maybe cut down the sugar so I don't end up with so much syrup.

I had a case of over ripe mango's and decided to make this recipe being the first chutney I ever made. I have to say I do think I can find better. It is sweet and savory with a lite touch of heat so it add a great balance. It is one you do not have to be prefect with for it to work great. Highly recommend trying this one...

Really yummy, but I had too little liquid to cook for 30 minutes. Had to add splashes of water to keep it cooking long enough for the mango do be done. I did cut down on the sugar, maybe that was why I had less liquid.
Had to up the salt and chili flakes, but that is just personal taste!

Some of the mango pieces became candy like due to cooking in sugar. Other than that, it's very good, amazing flavor. Can someone tell me how to improve consistency and soften all the mango pieces...thanks!

I have made this recipe 5 times. It gets rave s from everyone I serve.  I find it  somewhat mild for my taste, which is  whyy I sometimess divide the recipe into 2 parts. No change to one of them and to the other I add Habanero Pepper powder. I like the Habanero because it adds thats nice little After! Burrrrn at the back end.
For those who havve trouble with the mortar & pestle I suggest a ceramic grater, used for ginger and garlic (be careful w/garlic- grating makes it very Hot). I got mine at a Flea Market, have seen them in the $10 onTV shelf,  Asian markets. I find it to be an invaluable tool. I grated my garlic and ginger and then mashed it some more in the mortar. Overkill? Less work & tasted great! In my kitchen those two things count.

I love this chutney and have made it at least 6 times. It is so easy to make. It turns out amazing if my mangoes are hard or ripe. I make a batch and freeze it in 1/2 cup containers so they are ready to throw on a chicken or pork tenderloin. I can leave a few cups in the fridge for months and it stays good. This makes a tuna sandwich delicious. The only thing I do different is to cut my mangoes in little pieces and use about 2 cups of sugar.

Amazing!  This was my first attempt at any kind of chutney...I am hooked!  Initially I was dubious about a cup of vinegar because it already tasted great without it; a whole cup sounded like a lot.  It wasn't...it really brought a new depth and layer to complement the sweetness.  So glad I followed the instructions.  I used ground cardamom this time, but think I will make a trip to the store soon to buy what the recipe calls for because we will be making this often!  Thanks :)

It's Mango Season here in SoFla and someone gave me a bunch of green mangoes, so I decided to try this.  I made the mistake of not reading the directions and added the vinegar the night before with the rest of the ingredients (oops!).  It was still FANTASTIC.  I will be making this anytime I get unripe mangoes.

Excellent!  This recipe hits all the flavors that make chutney so wonderful and addictive.  It is also easy to modify to your own preference for heat and spice. I didn't change anything, though, and everyone loved it

Am now making the third batch of this as my friends now demolish it too rapidly. The first time I made it I added a chili and seeds. Second time not. Personally I prefer with chili but my wife is allergic to them.
I also add more cumin seeds. I eat it with curry and other dishes

Amazing, amazing, amazing! This is a fantastic recipe. Just so good- I could eat it with a spoon. I used a 2kg bag of frozen mango from Costco and times the recipe 2.5. That made about 3000ml of chutney that I put in sterilized bottles. We eat this with Indian food and use it as a sandwich spread. So happy to have discovered this recipe. Thanks so much!

I doubled the red pepper flakes and it was still mild. But this an excellent recipe.

This is the most amazing chutney I have ever tasted!  This was also the first time I made mango chutney myself.  I used what we call the "common mango" or "chutney mango".  I thought that the chutney became quite runny after adding the vinegar, but it thickened perfectly during the course of the day in the fridge and was ready for dinner that night.   I will start making this for Christmas presents.  It was easy to make.
