Tasty stew with nice combination of herbs.  Be prepared for major popping and splatters when you pour in the wine!! I recommend you have a lid handy to cover the pan to protect yourself!!

Made this for lunch today as I had all the ingredients on hand.  Substitued fresh sage and thyme for the dried because I had it available in my garden pots.  Very tasty! I almost ate the whole thing myself. Will make again

This was great served over Protein enriched thin spaghetti that had been seasoned with a little EVOO, butter,parsley & garlic,and black pepper, and Parmesan cheese.
Will become a family standard based on taste, economy,and nutritional value.

This gets three stars only because it was so easy to make and I had everything in the pantry.  The taste is at the most two stars (this after using fresh sage), but it served its purpose as a quick dinner for one.

Very-very tasty stew! Great combination of herbs. I used garbanzos instead of white beans and it turned out wonderful.

This recipe is quite good, and is also cheap, easy, fast, tasty and healthy - an all-around winner! It was a little salty, even without any added salt, so I might rinse the beans off next time to get rid of some of the salt. I agree with another reviewer that the mixture of herbs was strong, but I liked it that way. I also used a ton of garlic. I thought about doubling the tomatoes because I really like tomatoes, but I tasted the mixture after adding the beans, and the balance of beans vs. tomatoes was perfect. I ate almost the whole thing myself!

Delicious!!! One of the yummiest things I've ever made. I don't like meat, and I wanted to make something yummy and vegetarian for 4 friends who practically live on steak. We all LOVED this. So easy to make, too. Served with fresh breadrolls. Highly recommended :D

This dish tastes absolutely fantastic! Only complaint that I have is that it doesn't feed four! I used a 19-oz can for both the beans and the tomatoes, and it only fed me 3 times :( haha looks like I'll just haveto make it again! Thanks

I thought I was only going to like not love this based on other reviews. WRONG! I love it. Perfect comfort food for a cold and rainy day. Very easy to make with my pantry staples. Only thing I changed was to use fresh herbs but I almost always do that.

Easy vegetarian lunch or dinner! I made a couple of changes because I wanted more of a soup. 1) sauteed onions with the garlic, 2) added 2 cups of vegetable broth with the tomatoes, 3) added about a cup of torn up swiss chard after mixing in the beans, and 4) I reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes total.

Good but nothing special. This stew was filling and had a nice taste but it just lacked that little extra of a superb meal.

I did stray from the recipe by adding some onion and hot turkey sausage.  Overall this was easy and satisfying.

This soup was easy to make which is why I chose it.  I think some recipes with a few more ingredients end up tasting better, but overall this was pretty good.

Can't get much easier! This stew was simple to make, and needed very little attention while simmering, granting me the opportunity to finish cleaning up the kitchen and set the table. Very satisfying, while compatible with low-cal dieting. Just short of 5 stars because the herbs are borderline over-powering. Tasty, but a bit too much competition with the simplicity of the beans and tomatoes. Still a keeper - this is a great warmer-upper!

I omitted the sage and used some basil. It tasted a lot like italian spaghetti sauce. Might have been a lot better if I followed the recipe.

I doubled everything except the beans, and added a 1/2 bag of frozen corn. Served this over parmesan couscous. Quite tasty, very easy, very quick, and very economical!

I just finished eating a bowl of this stew. I'm a vegetarian, so this dish is perfect for me! I've never cooked with sage before, but both the smell and taste are absolutely delicious! I couldn't find the cannellini beans called for in the recipe, so I went on the advice of someone elses previous review and bought garbanzo beans. I am NOT a big bean eater, but the ingredients sounded delicious together. I loved the tomato, sage, and thyme flavor combination, but I was not crazy about the beans at all! (I doubled the recipe to 8 servings, which called for 2 cans of beans. One would have been more than enough for me.) The sage gave it a nice winter-time taste, but I will probably not make this again unless my boyfriend requests it. It has a great flavor, but not too crazy about the beans! I substituted chicken broth for white wine, and it tasted fine that way, but I would recommend cutting back a little bit on the olive oil.

I actually thought this was delicious. I cut back on the olive oil and upped the garlic. I also used fresh sage (which I think made a big difference). I subbed butter beans, as well. This recipe hit my requirements for being cheap and easy, as well as reasonably healthy. I will def. make again!

It was okay for a soup. I had fire roasted diced tomatoes and garbanzo beans, fresh sage and dried thyme ( the dry summer here in south TX killed a lot of vegetation and herbs). I added the juice from the canned beans but still needed to add salt. I'll probably do it again because I have the ingredients on hand and it is a pretty light vegetarian meal. Thank you for sharing!
