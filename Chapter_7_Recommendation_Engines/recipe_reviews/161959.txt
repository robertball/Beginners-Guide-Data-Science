I was browsing allrecipes.com looking for something to do with a bunch of zucchini I had been given when I saw this recipe. I'm so glad I did! This was very good, albeit a bit messy to make. I did add more salt and upped the garlic since we like things with more garlic. I did use a jalapeno. I actually made 2 batchees - one for us and one for the in-laws. Thanks for a great new recipe!

This dip is wonderful.  I would call it hummus rather than dip, but nonetheless, it has an awesome flavor.  No one will ever guess the main ingredient is Zucchini!  We will definitely be making this one again.

It seemed a little bland, so I added lime juice and an extra jalapeno and it was pretty good.

I added more garlic for more flavour as it was a bit bland at first.  Went over well, but I prefer the flavours of hummus or guacamole better.

A great idea, but the rice vinegar was too much for my taste.  Next time, I would just use 1T. rice vinegar.

Overall it had a great cilantro taste and I love the creaminess that the garbanzo beans gave it but otherwise kinda of a weak dip.  OK definitely a 'guilt free' dip but the recipe didn't 'wow' me and overall I thought it was mushy and bland.  I also read the comments so I added the vinegar to taste.  I served it alongside other dips and it provided a nice contrast, but overall I think zuccs are better a dipper than the dippee

I'm zucchinied out for the season. I tried this just for diversion. I love it! Like guacamole meets hummus! I used 1/2 the vinegar & juice of 2 limes then I upped the pepper. Mmmm good dip! No sign of zucchini in here!
