This is a great starting point but I spiced this recipe up a little. I added chopped onion and zucchini. Also, garlic and Italian seasoning and I filled the can of diced tomatoes with water and added that. If you like spice, I added some hot sauce and red pepper flake. I think adding more veggies makes it heartier and more filling. It was fantastic!

This recipe truly was easy and very tasty!  I took the advice of the others and added some garlic powder and instead of the celery I put in onions (I just don't personally care for cooked celery).  I would make this again in a heartbeat!

I loved this recipe!  I added zucchini, italian seasoning, garlic powder and a small can of hunts tomato sauce plus I used tilapia instead of cod and it was delicious.  I liked that it was simple to make and healthy.  I would recommend it to anyone.

What's great about this recipe is that it gives you a real versatile base of a chowder. If you follow another reviewer's suggestion and add to a can of tomatos a can of water, and then a small can of tomato sauce, you have a perfect beginning of a soup. I add a dash of Sriracha hot Chili sause to give it a kick. I also omit the celery (personal preference) and add sauteed chopped onion. Then add whatever vegetables you have on hand. So far I have made it with califlower and beans (which results in a summery take on a chowder) and with zuchinni and squash. I imagine it'll do well with potatoes and other wintry vegetables, so I am planning on making it again and again. And the best thing is that it is SO fast to make - the only time you spend on this is opening the cans and chopping up the veggies!

This gets five stars for simplicity, healthiness, and the ability to customize (great soup for losing weight, yet still getting healthy fat and protien). I added dry red wine, canned clams and oysters, and onions and garlic sauteed in a bit of oil. I also think potatoes could go well. Once, I also used a bit of old bay with a touch of celery seed because I didn't have celery on hand. Thanks for such an easy, healthy recipe!

yummy, cozy and extremely quick and easy. I didn't have time to go out and buy celery, so I substituted with a few boiled potatoes, and then mashed the whole thing up with a wandmixer thing, and it turned out hearty and thick. Thanks for the recipe!

This lacked something!  I added a can of tomato soup, a can of water, 1/2 lb shrimp and 4 healthy shots of Tabasco sauce. Helped quite a bit!

Very quick and good!  I added a little garlic salt and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also used Pollack fillets instead of Cod only because that's what I had.

this is a perfect start....you can disolve a small can of anchovies in with the garlic and onion, along with the celery, add a can of crushed tomatoes with the diced and tomato sauce, after those flavors blend for about 15 min, add the cod, flounder, tilapia, raw shrimp, bay scallops, etc and cook till fish flaky, its called fish stew, or chippinno.
Wonderful !!

Easy and delicious. I sauteed an onion and the celery with a little garlic in olive oil first - then added the staple ingredients.  Served with crusty warm bread - wonderful recipe!

i followed some previous suggestions - added onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes.  i appreciate low fat, but this as written has no fat, and i was missing some, so i added butter.  for me that made a big difference. a good, inexpensive and easy recipe!

Very tasty and easy. I added some onion and garlic and ended up using talapia just because I had it handy. I'd definitely make it again!

Really surprisingly good!  Per the suggestion, I sauted the onion and garlic and deglazed with wine (red).  Also, I added the soup can of water.  Added the hot sauce and pepper flakes.  I will make this again!

Very good recipe.  I switch out some of the celery with zucchini as I am not a big fan of celery.  That's the only reason for less than 5 stars!

I just made this for the first time and loved it, so I will definitely make this again. Based on other reviews, I made slight modifications: I sauteed 1/2 onion, about 1 1/2 stalks of celery, and some minced garlic in olive oil and then added the diced tomatoes. I used one can regular and one can Italian recipe diced tomatoes.  Since I doubled the tomatoes, I doubled the oregano and basil, and also added some garlic salt, italian seasoning, salt & pepper, a dash of red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of sugar. I used two frozen talapia filets since that is what I had in the freezer.

Delicious, fast, and easy.  I made lots of changes -- sauteed garlic, onion, and celery, added 2 diced tomatoes and some water because I didn't have any canned tomatoes, added a diced zucchini, and seasoned with sugar, salt, oregano, and Italian seasoning, used fresh basil and substituted tilapia for cod.  Will make again.

Love these flavors together! I was leery about fish in a soup, but it tastes great! I only have half of a can of diced tomatoes, so added a chopped roma tomato along with some kale (added some nice variety to color too!), garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and some chicken broth. I used tilapia instead. So versatile!!

This is very healthy, but a little boring. I did add onion, garlic, and old bay, but it was still a little blah. Might just need more excitement.

Very easy and very tasty! I did as others suggested and put garlic salt in it and a bit of red pepper.....I also put onions and zucchini for more texture. Everyone really liked it and they were all surprised it only too me about 30 minutes from start to finish to make.

Very good recipe, although I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes so I did it a little differently.  

Used two cups of chicken stock mixed in with a 6 oz can of tomato paste.  Added in onions, two cloves of garlic, a bunch of zucchini, some mushrooms, 1/2 lb of cod and spices (basil, oregano, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper).  It worked out really well for a stew.  Try it out!

Very nummy chowder!  We modified the recipe by adding more of the liquid, then cooking it down for 15-20 minutes before adding the fish, plus adding garlic like everyone else said.  Having tried it with fresh herbs and dried, dried seems to work better in this recipe.

So, I tend to go rogue on recipes and tonight was no exception but I must say that this is certainly a great base recipe to customize. What I made tonight based on this was an improvised Alaskan Cod cioppino with asparagus, onion, garlic, diced tomatoes, Sauvignon Blanc reduction, additional Italian spices, and a dash of Sri Racha on top of a bed of glass noodles. It was a big hit. I uploaded a photo but I don't see it from my app for some reason.

Quick and easy and very tasty.  Bought a pound of chowder fish at local market and got lucky.  It was wild cod.  Added some diced onion and zucchini and a can of tomato sauce along with diced tomatoes.

I made this, but thinned it with some coconut water for a little Caribbean taste.   I added some kale and Cholula Hot Sauce and it was delicious.  So SIMPLE!

Great recipe. I used frozen flounder fillets that come in a bag from Sam's. I added kidney beans, sautéed onion and green pepper, garlic and potato. The whole family loved it. I also added about 4 cups of water.

I just made this in between reading other recipes, so that should tell you how quick it is to make. I read the reviews, then decided to saute onion, garlic and celery before adding the other ingredients. Its great for anyone who is counting calories.

This was the first ting I ever cooked for my husband (then he was my fiance').  He came over to my parents house and we watched the olympics and ate this and he LOVED it!  It was too fishy for me, but otherwise was good.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very bland. The celery was still crunchy. Perhaps I didn't cook it long enough, but I followed the direction. I actually cooked it for about an hour total. Because it was bland I added garlic and Siracha hot sauce to kick it up at bit.

This was very easy and very good! Like some of the others, I replaced the celery with onion (spouse won't eat celery). I'll make this again.

I thought that this recipe was seroisly missing something. I followed many of the reviewer's suggestions and it still came out just mediocre. Maybe it would help if the broth had some heat to it.

Wonderful! So quick and easy. I will definitely be keeping some frozen cod on hand! I used two cans of Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes for a little more spice. Delish!

This is the first recipe I have tried on this website, and I was very pleased. The only change I made was that I added some garlic in too. The fish became wonderfully flavourful and tender cooked like this, and the flavours worked beautifully. even my partner who doesn't particulary like fish loved this. Will definitely be making again. So easy too!
