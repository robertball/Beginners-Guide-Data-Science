Everyone at the dinner loved this sauce over the ham. It wasn't thickening for me at first so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch and that did the trick. I also used golden raisins and a little more of them than the recipe called for. Very good.

This raisin sauce is delicious and perfect for ham. It reminds me of the raisin sauce my own Grandmother use to make. All of my children and grandchildren were impressed and that is hard to do.

This was a new recipe for me and I really liked the flavor. I also had to use cornstarch to thicken.

Lost my family's recipe for Raisin Sauce and this comes very close. Loved it on ham slices.

1 tablespoon of flour isn't enough to thicken 3 1/4 cups of flour. this was just a soupy mess!

This sauce was so good I hated to throw it out after the ham was gone. I made it exactly as written and will use this as my default raising sauce from now on. I did wonder how long it would take to thicken. So after realizing that it just wasn't going to get "thick" I took it off the heat and let it cool. It thickened as it cooled. It was perfect!

Reviews helped to clarify thickening. I only used 1.5 cups of water added 2 T. If butter and 3/4c of dried cranberries along with the raisins. I drizzled it over stuffed pork chops. Yummy!

I liked the flavor but my sauce never thickened. I tried bringing it to a boil and then turned it down. I even added another tablespoon of cornstarch.

I chose the recipe because I had everything on hand to make it after forgetting to include it in my original Easter menu. I also used two teaspoons instead of two tablespoons of cornstarch because it seemed to work for most people but I followed the rest of the recipe as is. My mom said she liked it better than her regular recipe.
