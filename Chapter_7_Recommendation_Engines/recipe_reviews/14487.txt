I use a large bottle of ranch dressing (any flavor) instead of mixing up the mayo, sour cream, and dry ranch.

On a lark, I made this "odd-ball" recipe for a pot-luck at work.  It was an absolute hit!  I've since made it a number of times.  Makes a great side for chili.  I use ripe peppers instead of green - try roasting them first for extra flavor.  I always make it a day ahead - it improves with more time in the fridge. 

The recipe holds up very well to modification -- add marinated artichoke, fresh basil leaves, pine nuts and substitute salami and romano (instead of bacon and chedder) for an Italian twist.  Spice it up with roasted chipotle or jalapeno peppers - don't be afraid of trying other cheeses -  smoked gouda or crumbled blue are delicious substitutions.

It sounds really strange, but this is a great salad.  I've made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought the mayonnaise taste was too strong.  The second time I reduced the mayonnaise to one cup and found that to be just fine.  There was enough dressing, even with that reduction.  I also took some other reviewers suggestion and just mixed everything together.  I was taking it to a parish picnic and thought it would be easier that way.  I would probably do that again in the future.  Some reviewers said they thought it was better the second day, but I did not.  I thought it was a little too moist, probably because the juice from the tomatoes was released. I highly recommend this for a different and tasty salad.

My mom told me about this dish and I found the recipe. When I read the ingredients I was kind of hesitant, but I made it anyways with a bit of a change. I omitted the tomatoes, peppers, and onions and added 1 can of rotel (drained). I was very surprised at how good this was. This would be a perfect side dish at a picnic, BBQ, or any kind of warm weather get together. Will Definately make again just not as much as it does make a rather large amount. Next time I might spice it up with some chili powder or cayenne pepper added to the dressing. Might also drain the rotel into that dressing to help with the flavor more also. Thanks for this recipe my mom is glad to have it also!

I made this recipe for the first time last summer for a family bar-be-que; not only was it pretty, it got rave reviews!  Even my mom & sister [who both hate beans] were impressed!  I find that the longer it chills, the better it tastes!

Absolutely the best salad recipe ever!  Everytime I make it, there aren't any leftovers and everyone asks for the recipe.  You won't go wrong with this one.

It does sound a little odd, but this salad is very good!  Another plus is that by using lite versions of the mayonaise, sour cream and cheddar cheese, and omitting the bacon, you can cut back on the calories and fat.

Excellent.  Used as part of a Mexican Night themed dinner for a group of 80.  Since it was winter, I used canned tomatoes with jalepanos, onion and green pepper...definately made the result less dry.  All was gone at end of evening and several asked for recipe.

This was a very nice salad. I cheated and went to the salad bar at my grocery store and scooped out calico beans, which were in a light oil and vinegar dressing and also while I was there, picked up the rest of the vegies. The other thing I cheated on was using a good bottled ranch dressing in lieu of making my own. I only did this because I was really pressed for time today. Rose, my kids thought this was the most interesting salad they've ever eaten and absolutely loved it! (I'm sure by tomorow the flavors will truly engage)!

I cut the recipe in half, still fed 8 people, and use half a jar of marzetti's ranch dressing, because it's thicker, and added lettuce!...fabulous!

I took this to a potluck and every woman there and two men asked for the recipe! It was wonderful I used 1 can pinto beans and 1 can black beans and dropped the corn to 1 can. This recipe can be changed in many ways to suit tastes of the family. This was unique no one at the gathering had ever had this before. It is not dry as you might think with the cornbread and at it's very best if made the day before. I'll make this alot now.

Cut recipe in half as I was using leftover cornbread. Since I am lactose intolerate , I omitted the sour cream and substituted it for 1.5 cups Ranch dressing. Omitted Cheddar cheese too! Very good. As suggested by other reviewers, I didn't layer; just threw together. I will most certainly make again. We loved it.

I've just tried this dish for the Labor Day holiday.  It is beyond delicious!!!  I made the mistake of dividing the recipe in half.  I have only a little left!!  I will be making it again, very soon.  I used a little more bacon and sharp cheddar cheese.  Yummy!!!

This is a great make-ahead for a large family gathering or a Potluck.
I use Black beans in place of the pinto beans and get rave reviews.

Whether or not a dish is my favorite, generally I'll get a few compliments on it from people whose tastes are different... no one cared for this one.  It was just kind of dry and boring, and there were way too many beans.  This recipe made an awful lot of it and it didn't go anywhere.  
Unfortunately, it also didn't impress my roommate to whom I brought it all home.  I didn't give it one star because it wasn't inedible, it just wasn't good.  
This one won't come out of my kitchen again.

Oh, this was so good!! Easy to put together and serve. First had this unusual dish in West Virginia on a mission trip. Of course looked it up here and found this one. Went over really well with all my guests. Plan to make it for the family reunion this weekend. Judge the amount of onion and green pepper to your tastes as to not overwhelm. Otherwise, delish!

UPDATE (10/16/10):

Not sure if this product has been around for a long time or not but I just discovered the FIESTA-flavored Ranch Dressing Mix.  I HIGHLY recommend using that, instead, as it adds a nice little kick to this recipe.  Again, rave reviews last week at my cousins' chili feed.  I just cannot get enough of this salad.  I'm making it again today.  

WOW!  WOW!!  WOW!!!  I can't believe this recipe tasted THAT good!  I was going to a chili cook-off party.  I thought I'd bring this along, too.  I arrived at the party later than planned and most of the guests had already eaten.  That didn't stop them from sampling this salad.  I left two hours later and took home an empty dish.  This is DELICIOUS!  Not only is it delicious, but it is so simple to make.  I'll be bringing this to every potluck from now on.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU Rose for such a great recipe!!!

Wow, does this ever make a LOT of salad!  But it's a good one.  I made it for the 4th of July. I used a can of black beans and a can of some sort of small Mexican-flavored beans (rinsed). I also used orange bell pepper as green seems to disagree with me.  This salad gets much better with age.  We ate some last night, which is 3 days after I first tried it and 4 days after making it.  Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

This salad is a surefire showstopper and makes a stunning presentation when layered as the recipe suggests.  I used a clear glass 6 quart trifle bowl and made a few adjustments, and it turned out perfectly.  I used 2 packages of Jiffy cornbread mix prepared as to the package directions and added double the spices, as well as a 4 ounce can of chopped green chilis, and a finely chopped onion.  I used black beans instead of pintos, and used 2 cans instead of one, and 2 cans of corn.  I left the bacon amount the same, but doubled the dressing, onion, green pepper, green onion and tomato, and used 2 cups of cheese as the recipe states.  Certainly, you can mix everything together as others have done, but if you're looking to impress a crowd, make the extra effort, and layer this salad.  It was truly the star of the show at our church potluck, both in taste and presentation.  This one is going straight into my favorite recipes box, and will be enjoyed again and again.  The only mistake I made was not taking copies of the recipe, as it was requested over and over, and the rave reviews left me confident that I had indeed found a "keeper!"

Great salad for a picnic or pot luck!
Use bacon bits to make it quicker and easier and more kid friendly.  To make ahead of time, I don't layer just toss in all ingredients except dressing then toss with dressing just before serving.

I used my own homemade dry ranch seasoning, red pepper instead of green and I used frozen corn. I didn't have pinto beans but I did have organic canned black beans so I used those. This was an interesting "salad", but in a good way. Next time, I think I'd cut back a bit on the cornbread and add a layer of shredded lettuce and maybe make a salsa-y ranch-y dressing. As is, we all enjoyed it. NOTE: The recipe dosen't say that you should rinse your beans and corn. If you use canned vegetables, it's always good to rinse and drain them well before using. It helps remove the ukkyness of the can and remove some of the salt, too.

This salad ROCKS. I used kidney instead of pinto but otherwise changed nothing. I layered it in a huge glass bowl and it looked amazing! It is unique in flavor, unlike anything I have ever had before. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This is a great salad. I substituted pinto beans for a can of black and a can of red kidney beans. I also made my own ranch dressing. The salad was delicious, but next time I think I'll cut the recipe in half because it made a LOT.

I found this unusual recipe to be quite tasty. I took it to a family reunion and got many compliments and some even asked for the recipe. This recipe could easily be made more healthy for the dieters out there by using fat free mayo and sour cream and lite cheese. You could also substitute the bacon for turkey bacon or omit it all together. The cornbread and beans makes this a very filling side dish. The fresh veggies give it just the right crunch and a burst of flavor. I will definitely make this again, but not for awhile because even after a large gathering I have half left! It makes quite a lot. Next time, I will probably half the recipe. Thanks again.

I made this for a picnic and it went like wildfire.  Everyone loved it and have already requested it for a dinner this coming Saturday.
One thing tho'.  I have a beautiful straight-sided bowl I wanted to use then read the instructions again and it said to put it on a large dish or platter.  Since it was going to have to travel, I used a glass 9X13 dish.  By the time I finished the first half it was almost at the top of the dish.  I could have used the bowl and I will use it this week.
I also will thin out the dressing a little since it was so thick and didn't spread that easily.
I also made this the day before as someone suggested.
Everyone just loved this, thanks for a great recipe.

This was so good!!!  I cut this recipe in half, even then it made a lot.  All the adults loved it.  My husband described it as a really tasty mixture of foods he would not normally eat.  The combination is truely fantastic.  I found it a little rich and might cut back a little on the  dressing next time.

This is always a hit @ potluck day where I work. I usually do not use all the cornbread. I find that it is too dry if I use the whole pan.

I make this salad a lot and everyone aloways loves it. The only difference in the recipe I have is that when you prepare the cornbread, you add one 4 oz. can of chopped green chilies and a little cumin to the batter. It just igves it a little bit of a kick. So delicious!

I've been making this salad for years!  It's always a hit.  I layer it in a deep glass bowl because it's just so lovely.  TIP:  The best ranch dip is Uncle Dan's Dip! Follow the "dip" directions, not the dressing - it's too runny and will make your salad soggy.

I love anything Mexican and all types of unusual salads of any kind and this is definitely being added to my list of favorites~thanks!  
I added black olives, used 1 pound of turkey bacon, and used Pampered Chef Chipotle Ranch to give it that extra kick~delicious! You can also use Hidden Valley Southwest Ranch botteled dressing.
I won't just be making this to use up leftover cornbread believe me~thanks again!

This is absolutely the BEST cornbread salad recipe I have ever tasted!  I did make a few MINOR changes.  I used a skewer to poke some holes down into the salad and pour regular ranch dressing down into each of them.  I still used the mayo, sour cream, and powdered ranch dressing mixture to layer into the salad.  I also used one can of pinto beans and one can of kidney beans instead of TWO pintos.  I do strongly recommend refrigerating this salad overnight instead of the recommended two hours.  It makes the flavor so much better.  My family LOVES this salad.  I highly recommend it.

I used leftover Buttery Corn Bread (from this site).  This was AWESOME!  I used black beans instead of pinto and also used red bell pepper instead of green.  NO tomatoes either.  Even my kids liked this one!  REALLY good!

Strange yes, but it all works together. Made for our last party, gone in 30 mins.
Everyone loved it. Used reduced fat in mayo and sour cream, still tasted wonderful. Also used green chilies in the cornbread mix. This is a keeper.

I had high hopes for this...for some reason it really didn't do anything for us. I think it needed a little kick..maybe some jalapenos or something. It's a unique idea...just not for us

Like the other reviews I wasn't sure of the ingredients. But this is the most amazing salad. I made it exactly as the recipe says and wouldn't change a thing.

I was skeptical to try this because it seemed so unusual but WOW, it is so good!  Made it for a work potluck and it was a hit, in taste and presentation.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I baked the bacon in the oven....I just think that is easier.  Thanks for sharing!

I used pre-packaged cornbread to streamline this recipe!  Love this salad although I did leave out a few of the ingredients to better suit my family.  I left out the beans and the whole Kernel corn and I added chopped avocado on the side for those who wanted it.  It came out very good however it can be time consuming because there are so many elements to it.

Wow!  I love to take different dishes to any event I attend that leave people begging for the recipe.  This was no exception.  Fortunately all of the vegetables came from my garden which made it all the better.  I thought the ranch would be over powering but it was'nt.  I'm getting ready to make this again right now.

2 stars for the recipe as is.  I revised the ingredients & directions in an attempt to improve taste & texture:  miracle whip instead of mayo, homemade cornbread vs corn bread mix, black beans instead of pinto, mexican style corn vs plain corn, cubed cheese instead of shredded cheese.  Also: make a mixture of the beans, corn, peppers, onions, bacon and cheese - don't just "layer" the ingredients one at a time;   drizzle some dressing on the bottom layer of cornbread before adding the bean mixture.   These changes made a much better salad.

Not to affend anyone but I made this for a family get together.  I was so excited about it because it received so many great reviews.    My search is still on for a good cornbread salad!  Gave this 2 stars only because it wasn't totally inedible.

We didn't hate this but didn't love it either.  Followed recipe exactly.  It is kind of dry.  When putting it together, it seemed like it HAD to be good--so many good ingred. but turned out just "okay."  Won't do again.  Sorry.

The taste of this was good.  However, I followed recipe exactly and it is not an attractive dish.  People did not sample it at a party I went to because I think they probably had no idea what it was and decided to abstain.  It's enough work and not enough results that I would not make it again.  With that being said, I'm glad I tried because the recipe intrigued me.

This would've been very good if I hadn't been a complete idiot and used lowfat Ranch dressing by mistake. It essentially ruined the dished flavor completely.

Wow!!  My Mom has talked for years about "Cornbread Salad," and I'm not a big fan of cornbread, but I made this for a work birthday dinner, and it's a hit.  I didn't change a thing, but I did run out of room in my glass 13x9 bowl, so I only did one layer of beans and corn. Also, I didn't have green onions (just couldn't get them at the WalMart that day), so I used regular onions.  What a great make-ahead dish.  Colorful, country-elegant, and yummy.

Oh my goodness! I made the recipe for our Christmas lunch at work yesterday and I had to give this recipe out to everyone! It was so good! I now have a great, quick, good tasting salad to take to pot lucks. My husband is a picky eater and I wasn't sure if he would like the leftovers I brought home from the luncheon. He went nuts over it. Good thing, because the recipe makes quite a bit. I am taking the rest for lunch today! Enjoy everyone!

I subbed black beans for the pinto beans and made my own mayonnaise. The people I served it to were really impressed by how tasty it was for a cold salad. Layered in a clear pyrex bowl makes it quite pretty.

I have a similar recipe that involves tossing a 4 oz. can of diced chilies into the cornbread when baking.  If the dressing is too much for you, simply cut it to 1 cup each mayo and sour cream - I will actually try it like this recipe next time as I always have a hard time spreading only 2 cups evenly.  I took this salad to a church picnic and it was gone, with several requests for the recipe. I thought it sounded weird, but I love this.  Beautiful presentation in a glass dish.  I like to make a half batch for myself.  The 9X13  dish will be FULL with the full recipe, and a half batch easily fills a 3 qt. dish!  Saves well in the fridge for several days, too.

We love this, very hard to stop eating(comfort food)!!!! I use rotel tomatoes, black beans, and ranch dressing (ad 1t cumin). I like it all mixed together, but I do think it looks much more appealing in layers.

Excellent flavor!  Never would have thought of using cornbread in a salad.

I too was skeptical abt. how this would be but it was excellent & we all wanted seconds. I did add more bacon & cheese.  We did have enough for another meal because it makes alot & their were only four of us...sent some home w/son. anxious to see how this is today...better?? will make again & again. Does take more time to prepare than recipe states.

Really good. I layered it in a trifle bowl and it was very attractive. I forgot to put in the cheese and decided to use premade Ranch dressing which worked very well. I also put down the dressing then layered the last of the peppers (used both yellow and red), green onions and bacon. I also didn't use the tomatoes since I needed to make this ahead for a salad buffet before high school graduation. Two of my siblings asked for the recipe and I ate it for lunch today after mixing the leftovers together, three days later, and it was excellent.

I cant believe people are omitting items from this fantastic recipe.  The only thing I do differently is: I dont layer it, I mix everything together.  The salad is the best thing you'll ever put in your mouth.  It is too good!

It's hard for me to rate this recipe.  I did like the blend of flavors - the dressing, bacon, tomato, cheese, scallion mixture was very good. What I didn't like was the texture of the cornbread.  It just didn't seem right with all the other ingredients.  And I can't just omit it, since it is the main ingredient of the salad.  Other people at my party said it was 'pretty good' yet only about 1/4 of it was eaten, and that was mostly by me.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

A very tasty and filling salad!  I used a mix of white beans and kidney beans since that was what I had on hand and they substitued just fine.  My only complaint was there was a lot of dressing and I'm not one for tons of dressing on salads.

They came back for seconds. This was a great hit at my Pokeeno party. I served it with Chicken Enchiladas. I made no alterations but next time I may add some green chilies. Another great recipe added to my cookbook.

I used rotel like suggested by another reviewer, it came out ok, but I found it very dry, it may have been the bowl I used, not sure, will try it again, and may increase the dressing a bit, great flavor !!

This is a very refreshing summer salad.  It is very colorful and makes a nice presentation when made in a clear bowl so the layers and colors can be seen.  My husband, who is not a salad lover, really liked this. Lots of people wanted the recipe!

I made this yesterday for a graduation party. I was a bit hesitant, since I had never heard of it! I used a loaf of plain and a loaf of jalapeno cornbread from the bakery. I substituted a can of black beans for one of the pintos. I used 4 ears of fresh sweet corn I cooked in the microwave, and instead of chopped tomatoes I used 2 packages of mini multicolored heirloom tomatoes. Also, instead of green pepper, I used red, yellow and orange peppers. I heard just now that it was a BIG HIT and I'm glad I made a small bowl for myself!

This was all right, but nothing I will make again. I took it to a church potluck and came home with leftovers (which rarely happens). I didn't love the texture, but I am one of those people who don't like to mix foods ( love compartment plates at potlucks -lol) so that may have been part of the issue for me. The taste of the salad itself was fair and it did look pretty in the bowl, but a regular seven layer salad would be my preference.

Love this!  Makes a large bowl.  The recipe left off that you're suppose to stir it up before you serve.  Bottle dressing doesn't substitute well for the ranch packet mix.

I made this as written and it was great, then I made it using pepper jack cheese and a bottled jalapeno ranch dressing and it was good that way as well, we enjoyed the spicy kick it added.

The family was divided on this one.. My husband and I liked it but the kids didn't. These are kids that eat all kind of salads, on the regular basis. The only changes were omitting the bacon and using red bell pepper for tomatoes.
Mainly 2 issues were here : I used leftover cornbread that was a tad sweet and that made the salad overall taste on the sweet side. Also the dressing and the rest of the ingredients didn't combine because of the layering and it made some bites too dry and some with too much dressing.
If I make this again, I will use a different kind of cornbread and mix everything together.

This got 2 thumbs up in our house.  Unusual dish and was hesitant to try it but it had so many good-for-you things in it, I chose to try it.  I am so glad I did!  I cut the recipe in half, and for 3 of us, it still took 4 days to eat it all!

Made it for Easter and it was amazing.  Some things I added/ substituted:  a layer of sweet pickles and pickled jalapenos(with everything mixed they acquire a different delicious, delicious taste),  a layer of pinto beans,  greek yogurt instead of sour cream and light mayo.

I loved this salad! I took it to a potluck a couple years ago and it was devoured. I didn't get to take any home and I was disappointed. I thought for sure I would because I made a double batch! I'm making it again this week and this time I'm not taking any chances and I'll keep a portion for myself!

I got this recipe years ago from a friend of my mom's, and I have been making it ever since. I frequently make it for potlucks and it is always a hit.I make it with black beans (well rinsed) and regular onions if I don't have any green onions on hand, and people always ask me for the recipe.

I used black beans instead of Pintos and I used a Spicy Ranch packet instead of regular. To accommodate a family member that's gluten intolerant,  I made my cornbread with tapioca flour instead of regular flour.  It made the cornbread crisp/brown and I liked that it kept it's texture. It didn't get soggy/mushy at all!  It was a HUGE hit! Everyone had 2nd helpings! Some said they could eat this as a meal itself. I thought maybe the recipe made more than I needed but 8 of us DEVOURED the entire punch bowl full and this wasn't the only salad there!  I posted a pic. :) It was super pretty,  fresh and I will be making this again soon!!! Thank you for sharing it!

I'll admit, I thought this sounded pretty gross with the mayonnaise, onion, tomato, and bacon, but wow I loved it! We made this in my cooking class and it was great. And it's so filling. This would be a good dish to take to a potluck.

I love this recipe! I only used 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream and thought it was enough. I mix the chopped veggies together, and I use a can of black beans and a can of kidney instead of pinto. I mix the cheese, bacon and corn in with the mayo dressing mix to make it a little easier. Yummy recipe.

I love this recipe. The only changes I made were omitting the bacon and adding some chopped lettuce. Pinto beans and corn were well-drained and tomatoes de-seeded. The salad was even better the second day and did not get soggy!

It never fails that when I bring something a teeny bit exotic to a BBQ/potluck it is rarely well-received. However, whenever I make recipes that I personally do not care for, people gobble it up and continually ask for the recipe. Go figure! Well, I love cornbread and this is not a traditional recipe, so although I was trepidatious, I made it for our friend's party anyway. First off, I made Texas Caviar the night before and could not find any ripe avocados at the store. So my honey told me to use guacamole. It was too creamy and we didn't care for it. I used this as one of the fillers in my cornbread recipe. Yep... I was scared...lol!  I used this recipe as a general guide and now I realize that the possibilities are endless. I added in chopped red pepper, lots of halved cherry and grape tomatoes, I grill 2 ears of corn on the cob and cut the corn off the cob. I also roasted about 4-5 jalapeños and mixed it in with my dressing. I layered as much as I could in a trifle dish. Finished it off with the dressing. Over the dressing I put a layer of green onions with 3 tiny tomatoes in the middle and rounded the edges with the halves. It looked beautiful. About 4 hours later it was on a table being devoured. Everyone made comments about the presentation and the flavor in the dish itself. I will make it again!

A hit for sure. I used our leftover cornbread from the nights before, always glad to not waste food! I make my own ranch mix and added boiled eggs. That's the only things I did different. Thanks for this recipe!

Just finished making this salad. I have been making it for years and it is a holiday favorite. Anyone who doesn't love isn't making it right. I only use 1 can of corn and add about a cup of bottled ranch dressing as well as the sour cream and mayonnaise. Seal it good with the mayo mixture along the edges and make it the day before to enhance the flavor.

Took this as a side for Thanksgiving today. Boy! Was this ever a hit amongst some picky adult eaters! I used spicy ranch dressing out of a bottle because that's what I had on hand. Except for the dressing and the addition of a cucumber, I followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely one for the recipe box and will stay in rotation for many years to come. Can't wait to have it again at Christmas!

I tried this recipe for our monthly potluck at work.  I always try to bring something a little different to keep things interesting.  I like all of these ingredients separately, but wasn't sure how they would all work together.  I tasted it along with everyone else and was happy with the results.  It's a little heavy with the cornbread, bacon, and cheese all together, but such great flavors.  I got several emails from co-workers asking for the recipe and there wasn't a bite left in the bowl!

My husband and I LOOOOVED this!  I only used 1 cup of mayo because I don't like a lot of mayo taste.  Consistency was still fine even after omitting the 1/2 cup of mayo.  I added more bacon and cheddar cheese.  I used the jiffy cornbread mixes (2 boxes)..  FAN-TAST-IC!!!!!!

I'm not sure why people say this recipe is odd. I live in East TN/SW VA and I have eaten similar recipies my whole life. It's an awesome recipe and dish. My husband loves it and makes it so there are never left-overs. You can also substitute Miracle whip for the ranch/sour cream/mayo and Jiffy corn muffin mix for the cornbread. We use this recipe but with Jiffy Mix it makes it a bit sweet - very nice and use kidney beans instead of pintos.

Loved it!  Added Celery to give it that extra crunch.  Not a crumb left at two different fourth July partys.

My husband really liked this salad.  I made it with a sweet cornbread and I didn't think it was that good.  I'll try it with regular corn bread next time.

This was a very cut & dry salad to make; I assembled it just as stated in the directions & let it sit in the fridge for 2 days before serving.  I was feeding a big crowd & still had a ton of leftovers, so next time I am for sure going to make sure to halve the recipe.  All in all though, this was a HUGE hit at the bbq I took it to & everyone who ate it commented on how great it tasted.  My only complaint is that it took a good chunk of time to assemble after making the bacon & the bread & everything.  However, it was totally worth the effort!  Thanks for sharing!

Might be a bit better with a sweeter cornbread mix but overall not very good.  Made WAY too much and was barely eaten.

This recipe had WAAAAY too much mayo in it!  I would cut the mayo/ranch dressing mixture in half.  We always made this recipe with black-eyed peas and it's super yummy!  Just don't use all of the mayo mixture.  It overpowered the taste of anything else in it.

Typically I don't like cornbread or pinto beans but I tried this at a pot luck and loved it.  I was so happy that I found the recipe here because I couldn't find the person who made it for the party.  Don't change a thing.
