Is delicious and really easy to make, with white rice flour get crunchy but, with sweet rice flour taste more sweet, is soft and lot easy to enjoy, both way I did love it and enjoy, especially the coconut syrup, wow, that hit the spot, thanks for sharing this recipe, I so love it and I will make it again :-)

Delicious but will try it with less shredded coconut next time so it'll be closer to the original karioka back home.
