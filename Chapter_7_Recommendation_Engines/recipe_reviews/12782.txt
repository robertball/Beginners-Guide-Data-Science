My husband and I really loved this dish.  Most of all it wasn't just another boring fish recipe.  We like food with a little "zing" and this definitely filled the bill.  You can't ruin this recipe if you follow it as written.  Just make sure you use a pan that's not too large so all the juices and sauce stay close to the fish while cooking.

This recipe is awesome. I make it all the time.  One addition... I melt feta cheese into the sauce and then serve the dish over steamed brown rice.  YUM!

We are always trying to find a new and delicious way to  eat more fish.  This recipe is delicious.  I thought it would be to spicy for my family but they said it was perfect.  I could not find red snapper so substituted tilapia.  I made not other changes other than that.

Easy, delicious, didn't need to shop for ingredients, one pan clean-up.  Everything I look for in a good weekday dinner.  We've used this with other fish and it works great.

I used Italian flavored stewed tomatoes for extra flavor and reduced the amount of red pepper by half but it was still pretty spicy.  I will definitely make it again.

I just made this dish tonight.  I had to use flounder instead of snapper because the store was out of snapper.  However, it was fantastic with flounder!  I can't imagine it being any better with snapper, but I'm looking forward to trying it.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the flounder substitution) and it was spicy but not too spicy.  Very easy to prepare and not too time consuming.  It reminds me of an Italian dish without all the carbs of a typical Italian pasta dish.  This will become a weekly meal at my house.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe! :)

This was delicious!  Based on other comments saying it was too spicy, I reduced the red pepper flakes by 1/4.  It was just right.  I also added a spoonful of commerical spaghetti sauce to help thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make again.  I'm planning to make it for a dinner party for five.

This recipe was great!!!! We loved it!!!  We actually used fresh caught salmon grouper, and I made the stewed tomatoes from scratch. I added way more red pepper and some cayanne and oregano as well.  I made tri-colored spiral noodles; after drained I added some olive oil a tad of italian dressing and some chili oil to spice it up.  I put the fish atop the noodles and it paired together great.  Also I used red wine.

We loved this recipe.  It wasn't too spicy, it was just right.  I served it with broccoli, pasta and a salad for a nice light dinner.  The fish had a wonderful texture.  I think I will follow another reviewer's advice and add a bit of tomato paste to thicken the sauce or perhaps just omit the wine.

I actually made a very similar recipe up with orange roughy (buy it frozen at Costco) and I add Kalamata olives as well, which go well with the capers.  Diced tomatoes work just great.  I find it takes a healthy dose of salt to bring out the flavors & I feel the white wine is essential to the dish. I have added a teaspoon or so of agave nectar to keep the dish from being too sour with the tomatoes and capers (sugar would work as well).

This is one of our favorite recipes- we make it a lot.  We do however change a few things.  We use 2 large shallots instead of using an onion.  We also add chili oil to the olive oil when cooking the shallots and add a lot more chili flakes- we like it spicy!  And we use chicken broth instead of wine.  This dish is great over rice, quinoa or pasta- just depends on your mood.

Loved this!  So easy and quick, plus it uses ingredients I have on hand. Can't beat that!  It has a mediterranean flavor with the wine and capers.  Yum!  It would be good with olives too.

I used only 3/4 lb. of snapper but kept the sauce the same.  The fish was thin, so I cooked it just under 10 minutes.

Next time I will serve it with pasta as the poster suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make.  Love the kick of the red pepper.  I used tilapia instead of snapper and it tasted great.  Will make again.

After trying Red Snapper Veracruz at a local mexican restaurant, I wanted to recreate the sauce.  This recipe was the closet as it had the basic recipe.  With some tweaks I was successful in closely matching the flavor of the Mexican restaurant Veracruz sauce.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and chilies instead of stewed tomatoes and left out the red pepper flakes and added an extra tablespoon of capers and a 1/4 teaspoon of mexican oregano.  It was delicoius.  I will make again.

Awesome recipe. My husband and I both loved it.  Made it exactly like the recipe with nice fresh red snapper - there is no need to change anything!  Nice and spicy! I will make this again and again.

This is a great change for fish. I think that you could pretty much use this recipe for any kind of fish and it would also be great for skinless chicken breasts. I used red wine it was all I had and I used seasoned diced tomatoes. Delicious and the smell in the kitchen was amazing. It was spicy and I loved it.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was wonderful.  Caught the fish ourselves.  Hubby had two helpings and wants the rest for lunch tomorrow.  Used can of petite cut tomatoes.  Also used dry vermouth since no wine in the house.  Squeezed half a lime over the skillet just before serving.  Served over couscous with broccoli on the side.  Good dinner.

Absolutely delicious! I added 1 Tbsp of tomato paste from the tube to help thicken the sauce.  My guests said they felt as if they were eating at an expensive seafood restaurant.  Thanks, Lola!

Very good recipe.  We used cod instead of red snapper and a little extra garlic since we love garlic.  Definitely a keeper!!

Very nice fish recipe.  I really impressed my wife with this one!!.  We have also enjoyed this with grouper and will usually add some scallops in with the fish when fish is almost done.  Great recipe. Thanks.

Excellent basic sauce for anything, really. I used it on Halibut as my fishmonger did not have snapper today. My wife loved it. My only change was the reduction of the chopped onion to one half rather than a full one - just looking at the quantity of each ingredient I thought that would be a good idea. Also added a handful of fresh oregano to give it not only a red pepper flavor, but a little herb as well. But I firmly believe if you cook it as recommended, it is brilliant!

Excellent recipe - nice and mildly spicy.  The snapper came out juicy and delicous.  Will definitely make this again. Didn't change a thing.

Yummy!!  I didn't change a thing, except for adding olives.  My husband really likes them, so I thought that would be a nice touch.  He ate everything on his plate!  Served with cous cous and roasted asparagus.

This is a great and healthful way to cook fish. I changed a few things because I used tilapia which is too mild. I added 1 can of chopped clams with broth, used rotel tomatoes, italian seasoning, and extra garlic. The fish "steamed" in this delicious concoction and I served it over rice. My husband and 2 teenage sons ate 2 filets each and next time I must make larger quantities!

Very simple recipe resulting in a wonderful tasting snapper.  I cooked 2 6-ounce snapper fillets and used 1/2 the sauce recipe.  I did not have any capers but did use everything else in the recipe.  I cooked the sauce for about 15 minutes on a low to medium temperature and when the sauce started to thicken, I put in the snapper fillets, covered with any extra sauce and cooked on low for twenty minutes.  The snapper fillets turned out great; just spicy enough for my tastes.  Thanks Lola!

The spicyness and fish were the only flavors that really came through. I'd suggest adding more capers, less pepper flakes and soaking the fish in milk for a half hour then rinsing. I will not make this again.

Made to the exact recipe,  & I don't plan to modify it  next time I make it.  The red pepper gives it a little bit of a zip, not overly so.  Very easy to make from Items I keep in the pantry.  Hubby ate it and liked it.   Served over mashed potatoes in a pasta bowl.

I love Allrecipes for just what this recipe did for me...a quick search forRed Snapper recipes and I found this quick and easy one. I made it as written, except I used ginger ale, yes ginger ale, in place of the white wine. Unfortunately, I decided to add a little white wine vinegar but that made it way too acidic. Found that a little baking soda would help, so I used some of the sauce with a tsp and mixed it in real good and it worked! So I made a whole science experiment as well lol! This turned out really good with just enough heat. I made brown rice and veggies with it. The snapper was nice and moist and I would definitely make this easy, limited ingredient, fast, tasty dish again.

I would halve the red pepper flakes. 1/2 tablespoon wipes out the taste of the capers. I will use 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon next time. Otherwise an excellent recipe. Healthy eating should always taste this good.

Great recipe. Only change I made was subbing 1 can Rotel sliced tomatoes & green chilis for the stewed tomatoes, which I didn't have.  Yes, I will make again; I now prefer this as my "go to" for red snapper.

This is a great base recipe that can go any way to suit one's taste. I added grilled artichoke hearts; and substituted white wine with 1T lemon juice and a cup of water. DELISH! Had I had any, I would have added green olives as well. I served over rice, with a side of steamed green beans. It took me 20 mins total. I will be using this recipe again. Thanks for it!

This was excellent.  I made it to the recipe , but reduced the amount of red pepper flakes to about a teaspoon.  It was still spicy.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was extremely easy to put together and tasted pretty good. I am not a fish lover but am trying to add more fish to our menus for health reasons.  So last night I was able to actually eat my entire plate without once thinking "Ugh, I hate fish!".  That's a good thing.  My hubby loves fish and he was very pleased with this so it's on my regular rotation for Friday night fish night.  Thanks for posting!

It was my night to cook and I needed something good, quick, and easy. I grew up in Florida where I used to catch snapper and mom or grandmother would cook it. This recipe out did anything I had before including my favorite Cuban restaurant. The fish came out tender and tasty. My wife and I both loved it. I'm having company this weekend and plan to prepare this dish for them.

Did not have stewed tomatoes so added a jar of bruchetta (red peppers, eggplant, tomatoes)   It was amazing.  I would cut down on the peppers next time as they overpowered the fish.  Would be great with trout also.

I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer Gertrong.  The sauce was good but you couldn't really appreciate the sweetness flavor of fresh Snapper.

Very tasty, but when you have fresh red snapper it seems a sin to overwhelm the perfect fish with such a flavorful sauce.  This would be a good recipe for a less than "caught last night" fish.

This is a new staple! I used Flounder (couldnt find Red Snapper), sherry instead of white wine, 2 large shallots instead of onion, and added about a tablespoon of tomato paste. I also used about half of the red pepper as I am not big on heat. Really great flavors!

This is an easy recipe and tasty too.  I added two tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.  I didn't find it too spicy.  Works great with rice or pasta.

This was a GREAT recipe! I served it with spaghetti noddles and added mushrooms. I used cajun style canned tomatos and added a pinch of the red pepper. The sauce was a little too runny for me; I will thicken the sauce with corn starch next time.

I used 1/2 the recommended crushed red pepper...great if you like pretty spicy.  the snapper was excellent. Will make again, but without quite as much zing.

Used halibut (a little pricier, but worth it!) which added a little cook time.  Otherwise, delicious as written.  Served with gourmet mushroom risotto (also on AllRecipes) and asparagus for a fabulous dinner!

Made the fish very yummy! I hate fish and I enjoyed the red snapper without a problem.

This is very easy to make and very good. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I used diced. I substituted Arbor Mist Zifandel instead of white wine. Also, per other suggestion, I cut back on the red pepper. Very tasty! Will definitely make again.

This was good.  I did cut down on the pepper flakes to 1/2t.  I might add some fresh herbs next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great and easy to make recipe.  It uses basic ingredients so you wont have to buy much else other than the fish.  I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it! I did use tomato paste to thicken the sauce, but either way it would've been fine taste wise.

This was an awe-some dish.  We cut back on the red pepper (used 1/4 tsp), added 2x the capers, added some tomato paste for thickening, and served it over rice.  The fish was excellant as was the sauce.  A definite re-cook.

I thought this was good to ok. It was a little to "wet" and too fishy for some of my family. 
It was a nice change on snapper though.

I made this last night and I did not find it too spicy but then my
husband and I both love spicy food.I also agree that it needs more thickening. I served it with pasta and found that the tasty broth ended up on the bottom of the plate and the noodles ended up with nothing. I will make it again and thicken with tomato paste most likely...
