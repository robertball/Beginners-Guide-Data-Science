Excellent, fast & easy.  Versatile recipe that you can adapt to your taste preference with different spices and cheeses...and veggies.  We substituted shredded parmesan for the mozzarella & added basil, oregano & garlic. Try broccoli, italian peppers or carmelized onions for a change of veggie flavor. MOST IMPORTANTLY...BAKE LONGER....at least 5 - 10 minutes to lightly brown.    That will eliminate some runniness...also, just let it set for 5 - 10 minutes before you cut. It will come out great.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was delicious!! I made it exactly as written and it's very rich and tasty! I do weight watchers and 1/8th of a peice of pie is 11 points.  Or, if you use light mayo and turkey bacon it's 6.5 points.  My husband also loved it!! Thanks!

I'm wondering if I did something wrong.  I really did not care for this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  One possibility...maybe my tomatoes were too large....perhaps I should have used two tomatoes instead of three (my garden tomatoes are pretty big this year).  Sorry....I really wanted to like this one!

I have made many different variations of tomato pie.  This is def. my favorite!  I peeled my tomatoes as my family likes it better that way.  I also used some dried basil as suggested by another review.  I made one pie and it is gone - I will make another tomorrow.  This has amazing flavor and some nice crunch.

This is absolutely unbelieveable. Fresh garden tomatoes, of course, make all the difference in the world, but I can't imagine it would be bad no matter what kind of tomatoes you use! Everyone for whom I ever make this goes nuts over it. Thanks!

This pie was great.  I made it as a side dish for baked salmon and my family raved about it.  My mom asked for the recipe and made it the next day for company.  Her company loved it, too.  I substituted 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper for the green (I like the taste of them and thought they were more colorful) and ended up having too much to fill one pie crust, so I made two pies instead.  It was great, though, because they were both eaten.

This had a really good flavor, but there was nothing to bind it together, so basically it was a pile of warm diced veggies in a tasty sauce.  I plan to try it again sometime, but maybe add some Bisquick or something to help it set.

This "pie" came out of the oven a sloppy mess.  I give it 3 stars cuz it had good flavor.  I'd want to make some changes if I made it again.

Delicious! Other than using extra bacon on top, I followed the recipe. I'll make this again, and next time I'll double it. Thanks for sharing this one!

One of those wonderful moments you never foget.  My 12 year old sometimes picky eater declared it to be "surprising" and asked for seconds.  Eveyone else had thirds.  Very flavorful.  I added dried basil sprinkled on top before baking.  Chopped fresh basil would be a nice addition if you have it. It was a little moist so I may drain tomatoes a bit before using.  What a wonderful summer supper!
