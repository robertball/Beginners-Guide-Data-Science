DO NOT DO WHAT I DID!  I bought a small 7 oz can of Chipotle Peppers in Adobo sauce.  When I opened the can, the peppers were chopped.  The back of the can said "Serving size 3 peppers in adobo sauce".  I thought "I like spicy - what's one more pepper".  My sauce came out RED, not a creamy sauce like I saw in the picture.  Then I pulled the can out of the trash and read further "6 servings".  That means I had the equivalent of 18 peppers!! Whoo!  Talk about spicy!  I was able to take 1/9th and add some milk and sour cream, and it came out pretty good!  (Now I just have to fix this 8 more times to use up the rest LOL)

Awesome recipe! I browned boneless, skinless chicken breasts and then added the sauce to finish cooking them. I used one chicken bouillion cube, lite sour cream and only one cup of milk but upped the number of chipotles to 5 for a nice "kick". Also, thickened the sauce a bit toward the end of cooking with a bit of flour and water. I would have liked leftovers but my husband, daugher and I ate every last bite. Easy, light and delicious!!

This was so good!  I have the answer to the heat problem.  Chipotle peppers don't always have the same amount of seeds in them, which is where the heat is.  If you control the amount of seeds that go into your sauce, you control the amount of heat.  I like to use a lot of peppers, for the flavor, so I try to get rid of most of the seeds so it's not way too spicy.

This recipe was simple, quick, and super tasty.  I made changes according to my ingredients on hand:  used lo-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 8 halves)instead of leg quarters, extra adobo (yum), and forgot the margarine completely.  Instead of roasting the chicken, I cut the breasts into 1 inch pieces and browned them on the stovetop in a bit of olive oil.  From then I followed the recipe instructions & served on brown rice.  Really flavorful, healthy, AND it couldn't be simpler!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Guera!

The original way of this recipe is boiling the chicken but doing it in the oven is faster and taste better!! You should try it!!!

This is absolutely delicious!  I cook a lot of Mexican food and this is one of the best. I used chicken breasts, browned them in butter and olive oil. I added a clove of garlic to the sauce. Those chipotles are HOT! I make salsa with jalepenos and habeneros and this was really hot. I was surprised and pleased. I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and wish I had made more!

Literally my boyfriends favorite meal, I'm asked to make this at least twice a month. I usually pull the skin off the chicken before throwing it in with the sauce. Also, I'll sometimes use shredded chicken breasts mixed with this sauce in taco shells with some fresh cilantro, salsa, sour cream, and cheese for a fantastic taco!

This was good...as a base recipe. There is spice from the chipotle, but not a lot of DEPTH of flavor. The next time we made it, we added garlic, chopped onion, and cilantro to the sauce...and seasoned the chicken really well w/ Mexican spices. May still "tinker" with it next time I make it!

Wow! I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing. Since we like a little more heat in our dishes i added two more chipotles and it was perfect! I also tried this sauce with shrimp...goodness..it was heavenly. I cleaned a pound of shrimp and took the shells off. I then sauteed the shrimp in a little butter for about four min and then threw the chipotle sauce in and let it simmer for another four min. We ate this over rice and it was so yummy! Im super excited to try this sauce with other proteins!!!

This sauce is great! This was my first time using chipotle in adobo. I only used one and froze the rest individually on a cookie sheet. We love it and we will be using this very versatile sauce with a variety of meats and starches. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it, in fact the whole family ate it right up. My husband thought it was great.  I used whole chicken leg quarters, baked them as directed, except I put foil over the jelly roll pan, then up the chicken using baking racks so it would stay out of the greese that seeped out of the chicken.  Made the sauce as directed too.  This was a fast and easy meal.  After reading other reviews, I may try it in chicken tacos.  That sounds really good too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this with boneless chicken breasts and it was wonderful!! This one is definitely a keeper and going in the favorites folder! I did use half half/half and half sour cream to cut down on fat. I also had to use pre-made chicken broth due to allergens. I just cut down on the milk accordingly. The hubby and kids loved this, too! Thanks for posting!

This is a fantastic recipe! I couldn't stop eating it.  I love spicy foods anyway and this one had such a deep, rich flavor to go with the smoky heat.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of leg quarters.  I sauteed the breasts in olive oil and then added the sauce and let them finish cooking in the sauce.  It couldn't have been quicker to make.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  This time around I used 5 leg quarters and the same amount of sauce.  Next time I think I will use boneless chicken breasts (just a personal preference) and double the amount of sauce to have more for the rice I served alongside this dish.  The whole family loved it.

I actually learned this recipe while living in Mexico years ago.

 I change things up a bit by adding garlic and onion though. If you have picky eaters like me though, you can use garlic powder and onion powder so there is no texture to it or blend the onions and garlic into with the sauce in the blender. I also do not add chicken bouillion  but I boil my chicken on the stove and use the stock from that. Also, do not forget the salt, or it will be lacking in flavor. 

All in all, I am extremely happy to see this recipe on her, and I am glad I found it! I hadn't made this in years and I forgot how delicious it was. Thanks!

This recipe is the best...we all loved it.  Just the right amount of heat.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and browned them in a large fry pan. Set them aside and put the puree in the same pan.  Picked up the flavor from the browning of the chicken.  Added the chicken back and let it simmer for about 15 min.  The sauce in absolutely incredible!!! Will make this often.

While this might seem too hot for some people, I've found it just right for most of the people I've served it to. As good as it is on chicken (we use boneless, skinless thighs or breasts instead of leg quarters),  I've tried omitting the bullion and putting it on broiled pork tenderloin or a smoked pork loin.  It was FANASTIC!!  The only thing it hasn't worked well on so far is broiled or grilled beef, but perhaps with the right cut smoked lightly it could work.  Also, the sauce makes up well in large quantities and keeps well - I make it in quart batches.  The flavors mellow into each other nicely.  It doesn't stay around longer than a week, so I can't say how it would do kept longer.  Mellowing it also mellows the heat a bit, so I sometimes add a tiny bit of Chipotle Tabasco or Garlic Tabasco to heat it back up.

I've made this a couple of times, and it's always been a big hit, no matter how I adjust it (once I made it with cream cheese and 1/2 and 1/2 since I had no sour cream.) I serve it with rice and lime and avocado. I think that the lime and avocado really bring out the flavors.  Delicioso.

So good! I wasn't sure if I'd like it-- I don't usually like "creamy" things, especially when they adulterate my beloved spicy foods. But these flavors blend really well together. I didn't roast my chicken-- I pan seared breasts with garlic/onions to a golden brown (still raw in the middles), then dumped in the sauce and let it simmer for 15 minutes or so. Served over Mexican-spiced Basmati. Tastes richer than it is, even using light sour cream and 2%. Might even be able to use a little yogurt in place of sour cream next time? Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW.  My husband who doesn't like chicken legs, loved this recipe.  I had to use chipotle salsa b/c my store didn't carry chipotles.  It still turned out great.  I think next time, I'll tear the meat off the bone, mix with the sauce and serve IN the tortillas.  It was so good.  THANKS for the keeper!

brushed skinless chkn breasts with liquid smoke before grilling them.  Adds extra flavour.  Cut the milk to 1 cup for a thicker sauce.  Delicious!

The sauce is really, really delicious on this!  It is very good mixed with rice.  The only change I would make would be to use chicken breast or wings, but that is just really a personal preference.  Really tasty overall!

My husband and I loved it - a bit too spicy for our toddler. I BBQed the chicken first (seasoned with S&P only) and it came out perfectly! We made just the sauce and served it with steak - quite delicious!

Just can't give this recipe more than 3 stars.  For one thing, it was greasy. I had to use my baster to suction out a lot of fat drippings.  If you're going to try this recipe, I would recommend using boneless, skinless chicken breasts because they have less fat.  My dish didn't look anything like the picture.  The sauce wasn't thick and creamy like that picture.  I took it to a party where everyone brought a Mexican dish and I ended up bringing about 3/4 of the dish back home -- so evidently other people didn't think it looked very appetizing either.  The ones who did try it didn't make any comments to me about how it tasted.  For me, the taste was fairly good, but the presentation was poor.  This recipe is just not a keeper for me.

We loved the taste of this, but I changed it around a bit. Used boneless, skinless breasts and sauted them in a nonstick pan. Pushed them aside to melt the margarine and stirred everything in together.  Made in the afternoon and then reheated it in the microwave when we were ready to eat. Sliced the breasts then poured the sauce over them.  Yummy!

This was excellent! I skinned my chicken then pan seared in an olive oil/butter mixture and seasonings. When the chicken was browned I simply poured the sauce over the top and placed it in the oven to continue cooking. I doubled the recipe and added extra peppers. It was spicy and creamy.. very unique flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I only made one substitution -- instead of milk I used almond milk.  The chicken was soft and the "heat" was just right.  I agree with the other reviewers - remove as many seeds as you can!  If not, it's really hot.

great recipe! used grilled chicken breast strips that finished cooking in the sauce.  Served with extra sour cream, salsa and cheese on corn tortillas.  I used 3 chipolte peppers and a little extra adobo sauce and got a perfect amount of  heat and flavor for us! Addictive!!!!!!

The sauce didn't do it for me.  It ended up curdling so I had to start over using a bechamel variation.  My final result was pretty good.  But I wouldn't make the recipe as written again.

Exceptional! Truly this is a simple and sensational recipe. Used 3 peppers rather than 2 because we like heat. Did not add salt, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Served with stuffed peppers and black beans. Amazingly good.

I would give this 6 stars if I could!  Totally delicious, tasted really authentic, an dit wasn't very hard at all!.  Next time, I'll use boneless chicken breasts, as the best part was wrapping the chicken and sauce in warm corn tortillas...basically, no need for bone-in chicken.  This could easily be my new favorite dish!

This is fantastic!  Very spicy, and very yummy!  I used boneless breasts instead of legs, and sauteed them in my skillet.  I removed them to create the sauce, then added them back at the end.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out great! I served it to my Mexican relatives and everyone enjoyed it.The sauce is nice and creamy and it was plenty to coat the nine chicken thighs I used and to spoon some over the rice on the side.

Made this dish 6 times. My Spice luving family enjoy this. Easy, had few ingredients, and delicious. BEWARE Chipoltles are HOT! dont be tempted to do more than 2 because you got a Whole can of them.  As others suggested I used only 1 cup of milk. I have used chicken breasts(cut up) or tenders sprinkled with garlic powder, salt and paprika and sauted in a bit of oil to save time, and poured the sauce over and heat it up. Garnish with a hefty douse of chopped fresh cilantro. Dinner in a matter of 20 minutes.

I used chicken breasts and omitted the milk and butter. I was trying to re-create the chicken chipotle dish our fav Mexican restaurant serves. I added large prices of green bell pepper and onion. I thought this dish was good but I did have to add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt for that extra oomph. I served this with another AR recipe,  black beans & rice

This was very good! easy to make and delicious. I did not change a thing - made it exactly as recipe indicates. The only thing I would do different next time is add more chipotle's. I have a house full of gringo's and I need a little more kick. ~!

I used three chicken breasts, chopped and baked for 30 mins, then added them to the pan with sauce, and reduced.  Two medium chipotle peppers were plenty for my family...  (They sweat with ketchup, lol!)  However, for me I could have added a couple more.  So good, even better day 2.

Oh my! This recipe is DELICIOUS! I dont usually like chicken if its not the breast peice. Well, I made it the first time with chicken breast and it was yummy.  But then I decided to try it with chicken legs and let me tell you that it is way better than w/ breast!!! Everytime I make this, I get RAVE reviews and so I have to make HUUGEE batches.  I still get old friends calling me to give them the recipe!! There isn't anything I would change, I just add more peppers since I like it spicy!! Give this recipe a try!

Sorry, but some of you really kill me, for never had tried Chipotes before. I am laughing pretty hard. Please taste ingredients before adding to mix. Ho Ho ha ha ha Sorry. A little Chipote goes a long way, it is just like the Thai green curry that you buy in the 125 g jar. Use sparingly. This and variations of it is a simple easy and delicious. I did it without the milk but there was still more then enough sauce to cover all the rice. For those who said the sauce broke down is because you need to keep it on low heat on the stove top, if you put it in the oven with the chicken at +175°C, it will break down, but one you mix it with the rice, you will never know it.

This turned out okay - the sauce curdled in the pan, giving it a slightly gross texture. We liked the heat and flavor,  but overall it was a bit rich for our taste.

Ok...The sauce is AMAZING! Yes you should definitely do a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. But it works great.  I over cooked my chicken so it just fell off the bone, but I would make the sauce by it self for seafood dish or pork also.   And this would also be great for nachos (It has the same consistency once you add the cornstarch slurry).  Just add some cheese as desired.  Great versatile sauce!

Wow! This is delicious. I used boneless, skinless thighs, dipped them in flour and browned them, then roasted them in the oven before adding them to the sauce. Tremendous recipe! I'd give it six stars if I could. I served this with Goyon Spanish Golden Rice with fresh chopped cilantro folded in right before serving, grated a little cheese over the chicken and some sprigs of cilantro for garnish. Beautiful and delicious. I want to see other recipes from the person who submitted this one. Ole!!

This recipe was awesome! I used half and half instead of the milk and cut it down to 1 cup. Also I used chicken breasts instead of the legs. My boyfriend loved this and am planning on making it again tomorrow. I think I will add 1 or 2 more chipotle peppers and some garlic and onion. Thanks for sharing!

This is the Bomb! It's one of those recipes that I make for the first time, love it so much, that I end up making it another half dozen times in a couple weeks! At others' suggestions I reduced the milk to one cup & used more peppers because we like it hot. I've done this with chicken thighs and wings. Lately I've gotten lazy & started making the sauce, adding cooked chicken & serving it over pasta with herb sauce. I just love it! Thank you!

I too cheated on this. I used thin sliced boneless chicken breasts and sauteed them in a pan for a few minutes on each side. I omitted the milk from the sauce entirely and just added it directly to the pan with the chicken once they were cooked through, then let it all simmer together for about 10 minutes. Very fast and tasty too!

Spicy, flavorful and delicious, very tex-mex. I use chicken breasts and serve them with guacamole and white rice on the side, the sauce gives the rice a delicious flavor.

This was delicious! I served it with my Mom's Mexican Rice (my own concoction of white rice, canned black beans and a small can of Mexicali Corn which my family loves) and small store bought tamales on the side. I topped the chicken with cilantro and a sprinkle of salt just before serving! This will be a regular at our house.!

Fantastic, quick, and easy! Used chicken breast that I browned then added some garlic powder only because we love garlic. Used 1% milk (1 cup), and low fat Sour Cream to reduce calories. This was a hit!!! Thanks so much. My family said this is officially their favorite chicken recipe. :)

Delicious! I used only one pepper but added some of the adobo sauce to make up part of the difference. I left out the salt. Served this with 'Mexican' rice (added frozen veggie mix to it). Quick and easy weeknight dinner.

Really, really good!  Some notes:  I substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream, used 1/2 the milk and thickened sauce with cornstarch.  Don't use any more than 2 peppers.  I like my food spicy and 2 peppers was sufficient.  Also, use chicken pieces that you can eat with a fork.  I tried just chicken legs (not quarters) and it was a bit messy.  Very picky 14 year old boy even ate seconds.  Thank you for sharing!

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  I modified a little bit by sauteeing sliced chicken breasts until they were browned, and then pouring on the sauce to let them simmer to done.  The best thing about this dish, though, was the easy clean-up!  We served our chicken over rice.

Soooooss good and so easy! Flavor was unbelievable. I did grill the leg quarters because it's summer time in Chicago and turning on the oven would be too much. The grilled flavor of the chicken with the smokey flavor of the chipotle peppers was a perfect compliment. YMMMMYY!!!

Not very flavorful for us- I think it needs many more peppers or something else to increase the flavor.  But our family likes a lot of spice in our foods, so could just be us.  I would recommend using more peppers though.

This recipes was delicious even when you sub low fat for full fat ingredients. We also grilled the chicken quarters and added to sauce at last minute. Wish we hadn't skipped the rice. It was needed to soak up the creamy spicy sauce.

A hit at my house, I did take the seeds out of the chipotle peppers and it was just the right spice for us.  Also used boneless skinless breasts since that was what I had on hand.

I made this for dinner last night!  My bf absolutely loved it!  I seasoned the chicken legs and thighs with garlic powder, cumin, pepper, and a small pinch of red pepper.  I roasted the chicken in the oven for about 40 minutes.  I also used 3 chipotle peppers since my bf is Mexican and he loves spicy food.  We had Mexican rice and even poured a little of the chipotlle sauce on top. I'm saving this recipe!

Thanks for a great recipe!

Killer good!  The only change I made was after the chicken was done, I took the sauce and simmered it with some corn starch/cold water to make it creamier and it covered my chicken better while we ate it.  SOOOOO good!  A little too spicy for me, but that's my own fault - add the peppers bit by bit and taste as you blend!

This was edible, but not worth the added calories.  Tasted like sour cream with a little kick.  I like both good flavor and good spice...this provided neither.  Won't make again

Are you kidding me?  This is delicious.  Made with mashed potatoes instead of rice.  Used 3 peppers.  Perfect spice for me.  Braised chicken legs with olive oil and garlic before roasting.

I had a 1/2 can of chiptole peppers left over from a salsa my husband made.  I found this recipe to use it up. It was very easy and very good. I used BLSL Chick. breasts and cooked in pan with olive oil and some garlic.  Then added the sauce to pan to cook with chicken. I did thicken up the sauce a bit.  I served with mexican rice and beans. Will definitly make again. It had the right amount of 'kick' to it. We like things spicy.

Not really sure what happened. Had boneless chicken breast, cooked them up first, added sauce. The sour cream seemed to separate, didn't add much flavor to chicken even after letting it simmer for about 15 min or more. Looked nothing like the yummy pic of SunnyByrd. Sorry, wont be trying this again....

I followed this recipe as written except I used chicken tenders and grilled them - Yum! The sauce started thin but did thicken while simmering - with no added corn starch.  This would make a great appetizer too!  I will definately be making this again real soon - Thanks for posting.

The scent of the puree made me wonder how this could ever live up to most of its reviews. I hesitantly heated the puree in the sauce pan and added the pan-fried chicken breasts (I didn't have time to roast!). The sauce was too thin(even when using only 1c milk), so I dissolved 1T cornstarch into 1T milk. This thickened up the sauce, and as you can see by the 5 stars, it ended up tasting magnificent. Anyone who rates this less than 4 just doesn't like chipotles!

Fantastic recipe! I loved the flavor, and the sauce over mexican rice was divine! Even picky husband loved it.  I took the seeds out of the peppers to lower the heat. I used boneless chicken breasts (all I had) and they worked out really well...browned them for a minute and then continued with the recipe as is. They finished cooking in the sauce, and stayed tender. Thanks for this easy yummy recipe!

This is a good basic recipe, but I changed the following things; I used chicken breasts that I boiled in mexican seasoned chicken stock.  Then I shredded the meat.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  I added one extra pepper as we like it spicy.  I added a chopped onion and 2 cans of black beans (rinsed) and let simmer until the onions softened slightly.  I added garlic powder (about a Tbsp) and a tsp of paprika.  Salt and pepper to taste.  I added a tsp of butter to make the sauce richer.  With simmering, it thickened quite nicely.  I served this with mexican-style shredded cheese, shredded lettuce and flour tortillas.  With the changes this made a meal in itself.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I had to make the changes but it is a good basic recipe to work from.

We love hot foods, the hotter the better.  I used 4 peppers and that was too much heat for us, but still delicious.  We will definitely make this again...but w/2 peppers like the recipe states.  ;o)

I only had skinless/boneless chicken breasts so I modified the recipe. Instead of roasting, which would probably dry out the chicken, I sauteed the breasts in 1 tbsp butter for about 10 minutes each side. I then made the sauce without the butter and added to the pan and cooked for another 10 minutes. The sauce seemed a little runny so I added 1 tbsp corn starch. I used 4 peppers because we like spicy but next time I'll cut it down to 3. It was a little too spicy. It tasted great served over brown rice. The whole family loved it!

I didn't like this. My husband said it was great but only for a change in the usual baked chicken. I found two peppers to be plenty of heat as I still needed to have my kleenex handy. I most likely WILL NOT make again.

I love this recipe!  I use a version of this recipe with chicken breasts for chicken tacos with cilantro, feta and pickled onions.  The chipotle in the chicken gives it just the right heat.  Yum!

I make this frequently and vary what goes into it in addition to the chicken, depending on what I have on hand. I always start by browning boneless chicken, usually thighs, in a large skillet over medium flame, rather than cooking It in the oven. No oil or butter needed. I usually leave the salt out and add up to half a tsp fresh ground pepper and a tablespoon of cornstarch to the mix  before blending the milk, sour cream, boullion, and double the chipotles in adobo (unless they are particularly large ones) with an immersion blender and pour it into the hot pan with the chicken. Occasionally that’s been a bit too spicy, but it has sometimes come out bland when I don’t double the chipotles in adobo. I add some vegetables... broccoli, red or green bell peppers, onions, corn (fresh or canned), black beans, poblano peppers... whatever I have on hand, stir to coat everything with the sauce, and continue cooking until the chicken and veggies are done. I serve it over brown rice and quinoa, and sometimes with some stove top stuffing on the side, drizzled with a bit of the sauce. ?? LOVE THIS RECIPE!

I made this incredible sauce as instructed but poured it into a crock pot to slow cook skinless, boneless chicken breasts(cut into large chunks).  I added one chopped onion and 16 oz sliced fresh mushrooms as it cooked.  Served over rice & topped with cilantro.  SO simple & delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I tried it as written the first time and my wife and I liked it well enough to make it a few more times. We changed it just a little in that we used legs or breast tenders instead of quarters.  The sauce is great, a bit spicy, but we like spicy, but if you don't you may want to cut back the peppers.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this website, and has been for a long time.  It's pretty much perfect--not too many ingredients, not too expensive or hard to obtain, explosive flavor.  The only thing I would suggest is that, instead of adding salt to taste, people might want to consider adding more bouillon granules instead for even more flavor.

This was delicious and easy. I took a tip from another reviewer and sauteed the chicken with half an onion and about 4 cloves of garlic. I added three peppers instead of two with a hefty dose of Adobo and it was just spicy enough. Served over rice with a salad and warm tortilla. Thank you for the recipe!

This was very tasty & easy to make but so hot! I used a small can (6 oz.) of chipotle pepper in sauce. I served it with extra sour cream & avocado to tame the heat.

Based on other reviews, I tweaked this recipe so much that I wondered if it became an entirely different dish, but it was based on this recipe. I didn't have Chipotle peppers or Poblanos, but did have ground Chipotle powder. I seasoned chicken thighs with the Chipotle powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and paprika. Dredged in flour seasoned with the same spices. Seared in a Dutch oven, and set aside. In the pan, I sauteed chopped onion, garlic, and red bell peppers. Whisked in chicken stock, put the chicken back in and braised for 45 mins. Removed the chicken. Whisked in milk and sour cream. Put the chicken back in the pot, and let simmer on Very low (or the dairy will curdle) for around 15 mins. I served it with saffron rice with black beans and corn. My daughter who generally will not eat anything but BLSL chicken breast ate it, and loved it! I'll definitely be making this again very soon!

This was great! We served this with a salad, corn tortillas and spanish rice. Would make excellent filling for an enchilada casserole of some kind - or burrito filing. Yum. If you like chipotle flavors, you'll love this.

I made this and we loved it. I made some changes though. I don't do bone in chicken, especially legs. So I used frozen chicken breast cutlets and cooked them on the 'convection roast' setting on my oven for about 30 minutes. I did everything else just as the recipe said. Turned out awesome.

I made this exactly, and it was very good-I only adjusted the amount of chipotle I put in for our taste. When it was ready to serve, I thought I would make the sauce into a gravy so I thickened it with a little Wondra flour.  I chopped up a little cilantro in a bowl on the side for people to add to their liking.  Was really good with flour tortillas and Mexican rice. Will definitely make again.

This was a quick recipe to put together.  I used chicken breasts (that is what I had on hand).  I browned them in a frying pan then put them in a casserole dish.  Mixed the sauce ingredients in the same fry pan (added one more chipotle pepper and 2 minced garlic cloves)simmered for a few minutes then poured it on the chicken breasts and baked for 30 min.  Served with rice pilaf.  Husband went crazy for it.

If you like spicy food, increase the amount of chipotles. I used three and thought it could still use more bite. As others suggested, I browned the chicken, removed them from the pan, then sauteed some garlic and made the sauce. I put the chicken back in and put the pan in the oven to finish cooking. The sauce could still use something to give it more flavor, so next time I'll try adding cilantro.

I made this for dinner the other night.  Followed the recipe except for reducing the servings. In a word "fabulous".  One of my favorite chicken dishes ever.  My family loved it and I will make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Loved this recipe.  Used chicken breast cooked on the grill with only salt and pepper to season.  The second time we mixed it up by using egg noodles instead of rice.  Can you say AWESOME?!?  I think next time we'll add bacon and shredded pepper jack cheese!

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so I subbed a couple tablespoons of broth and some salt, which worked fine.  I also doubled the chipotles to give it a little more kick and used skinless thigh cutlets to cut down on the fattiness (though you do lose the crispy texture).  Still turned out great!

My husband loved it and said it was "guest" worthy.  After reading the reviews about the curdled milk concerns, after I melted the butter, I reduced my heat quite a bit before adding my sauce mixture.  Had no problems.  This recipe will now be a household staple.  Thank you!

This was a nice flavor but very mild. I had issues with the sauce curdling and had to make sure I cooked only for a few minutes after adding the milk. The legs are so fatty, it took a while to de-fat. I might try drumsticks next time.  The sauce is quite good.

This was fantastic. I did have to finish the skin-crisping in a pan, but that was probably because of a new convection oven that I'm not used to. 

Served it with brown rice and a shredded carrot-lemon salad and it was a HUGE hit.

Absolutely delicious!!!  The only things I did different was to throw in a handful of mini bella mushrooms and let the sauce reduce to be quite thick....super yummy and will be making this recipe again and often!!!

I made Mango Chipotle Chicken- I added a mango (1/2 puree and the other 1/2 cut into chunks to add to the sauce later), 1/2 onion which I sauteed with the butter, and 1 Tbps. of sugar. Delish!

Sooooo delicious! I ended up using shrimp instead of chicken and it came out really super good!  I bet it'll be good on anything.  The sauce is super easy to make so this is now my go-to sauce for getting a flavorful dinner on the table when I'm short on time or just want something truly yummy.

I loved this recipe.  The only different thing I did to it was add 2 more chipotles.  I like spicy.  It was great!  I will make it again for sure!

This took way longer to cook than the recipe stated.  I must have had some big legged chickens!  I was somewhat put off by the amount off grease in the pan after cooking the chicken.  Also, them big legs took up alot of room in the pan but didn't seem to have much meat when we were eating them, which was a bit tricky with that giant saucy leg on the plate!  If I make this again it will have to be with chicken breasts or maybe some boneless skinless thighs.  I thought that the sauce was delicious, but way too spicy for my little ones.

We throughly enjoyed this meal. For health reasons, we removed the skin from the quarters, and baked skinless.   Also, to limit salt, we opted not to use bouillon or salt.   I served this meal with whole wheat tortilla and salad.  Overall, this was a great recipe and I will use again. Thank you for sharing.

Loved how easy this was to make.  I used skim milk, fat free sour cream, margarine with no trans-fat or sat-fat, and didn't add salt because I'd salted the chicken.  (You can probably leave out the butter/margarine altogether.)  I don't suggest serving with white rice because that was too bland of a side dish for this - maybe Spanish rice, or something else with more flavor.  Next time I will use thin-sliced boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or maybe shrimp) and fresh tortillas for wrapping.

Update: I made this recipe again for fish tacos, but this time my DH spiced it up even more with the addition of coctail onions and sundried tomatoes - worked very well.

Love it!! I use non fat milk, skip the butter and sub out the sour cream for non fat greek yogurt. I also use skinless breasts instead of legs. Tastes amazing with less fat/calories. Thank you for this!! It is one of my favs to make. And so easy too.

This is a very good recpe. Just need to cook longer then 30 minutes for chicken leg quarters. I knew I should have used a themometer. I did brine (8 quarts water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup sugar, whole pepercorns) the chicken before cooking, this really adds flavor and improves texture. Sauce was really fantastic will definatley make again.

Absolutely one of the best meals I have ever made given the simplicity.  I even took a shortcut and skipped the blender. I just crushed the peppers coarsely with a wooden spoon while making the sauce. All my three boys gobbled this up and reqested it for lunch the next day. Simply OUTSTANDING!!!!

delicious! i used butter instead of margarine, but that's the only change i made. you can control the heat of this dish by taking out the seeds of the chipotles - that's what makes it spicy. i like making it pretty spicy, and i eat it with rice so i can drizzle some of the sauce over the rice.

EXCELLENT recipe.  I only made a few minor modifications.  I baked for an hour and simmered for 20 minutes or so in the chipolte sauce.  I also doubled the sauce so there was plenty to pour over rice.  Just personal preferences - I like meat falling off the bone when serving over rice.

Very tasty.  I doubled sauce as some recommended and thought it was way too much sauce.  I spritzed chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic powder. I cut back on chipotle peppers (used 3 for double suace recipe) and it had plenty of heat for us.  Next time will try using 1 chipotle pepper.  If cooking in oven, allow more time for chicken to cook.  Mine took closer to an hour to brown and cook through.  This would be really good browned in a frying pan and then simmer in the sauce on the stove top.

This is so tasty!! I like really spicy but my husband is a spice wuss, so the perfect amount is two or three peppers with the seeds scraped out per cup of sour cream used. I also add 1/4 onion and 2-3 cloves of garlic to the blender when i blend all the ingredients together.  I add frozen peas and browned chicken to the sauce and then serve over linguine.
So good!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I had to puree the sauce a second time after it cooked down a bit. It was really grainy. I use 2% milk so maybe that's why... Next time I will definitely use breasts because our family prefers white meat to dark. I think this would be really yummy served along side grilled chicken.

A winner!!! Everyone in the house loved it.  It can be as spicy as you wish, just add more or less peppers.  The sauce would also be good with shredded chicken on soft tortillas! YUM!!

I browned boneless, skinless chicken breasts in oil and added to the sauce.  I really liked this a lot.  chipotles can be really hot but I love the smokiness of the chilis.  As usual, I used fat free evaporated milk in place of the cream.

I only had chicken breasts on hand, so I browned them in oil and than put the sauce together. I used plain yogurt, and it came out a bit watery, so I added some spinach to thicken it up. Came out very good, had a nice, smoky heat.

Very good, this recipe kept the chicken legs moist and flavorful.I spiced the legs up with cajun red rub and started them on the charcoal grill for extra flavor.

I won't make this again. The sauce was bland w/ only 2 peppers so I used 4 - fine for my fire-breathing husband, but too spicy for the rest of the family. The kids tore the skin off and removed the meat to roll up in flour tortillas (messy!) Sorry, but there are too many good chicken recipes out there to bother w/ this one.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Quick and easy and I had everything on hand, which is always a bonus!  I used a little more of the chipotle that was asked for and I also added a couple of tablespoons of flour to the puree mixture to thicken a bit.

We did not like this at all.  There was a terrible smell from the adobo sauce and the chicken was bland.  Maybe we just don't like chipotles?  I usually put them in chicken salad with cilantro, perhaps the cilantro is covering the 'smoke,' taste?

Spicy and delicious!  There were no leftovers and that never happens in my house.  I used legs and thighs, and while the flavor was scrumptious, they didn't really crisp up in the oven.  I think next time I will use boneless/skinless.

This was really good, and very spicy!!  2 chipotles were plenty!!  I can't imagine the people who did 8!!  I did what others suggested and only used 1 cup milk, but I also added 1 Tbsp corn starch and the sauce was super thick!

Loved it!! BUt I don't know how some people put 5 chipotles!! I put 2 and it was so spicy and we are used to them.  I make chipotle mayo and put them on burritos...YUM.  Anyways, I also browned boneless chicken breasts and then followed the recipe :)

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I made it with chicken legs, rather than leg quarters, but it was really delicious. The sauce is great. The smokiness of the chipotle peppers and the heat of the adobo sauce were wonderful with the creamy base. I'd like to try this sauce with other foods, as well. Maybe shrimp or chicken wings...I might sprinkle it with some fresh chopped cilantro next time, too.

The only changes I made to the recipe was using 8 legs (not quarters) & I used a tbp of chicken base instead of granules. Also, I  used a light sour cream (it's the only kind I buy). I served this w/ Tex-Mex corn on the cob (from this site) & it paired really well but I wish that I had also served some spanish rice as suggested by the submitter...the sauce would be fantastic on spanish rice. This was perfect for a night when hubby wanted mexican food but I didn't want the calories or heaviness of traditional mexican fare. We served this w/ chips & hot sauce & mexican ceviche as appetizers, this dish & the corn for the main course & caramel glazed flan for dessert...YUMMY! Thansk GUERAGUERRERO...we really enjoyed it!

This would have been a lot better if my husband didn't try to "help" in the kitchen and double the sauce and use the whole can of chipotle even though I was only halving the recipe.  But I can see how it would have been wonderful. =)

Oh my goodness this was FANTASTIC 10 stars from my 12 year old, it was a little spicy so my 3 yr old had nuggets instead but everyone else loved this recipe thanks so much we will do this over and over.  The only thing I changed was I blended the sauce in my blender and poured it over the chicken, returned it to the oven for 20 minutes until the legs were done.

I used 8 chicken drumsticks and browned each side for about 4 mins (flipped 4 times so total of about 12 mins browning) While the chicken cooked I blended the sauce but added 1/4 onion and 2 garlic cloves and pepper.... I personally didn't use salt as chicken knorr has enough. Simmerd on low for 30/40 mins and served on white rice. WOW.

I made this but since my husband is sensitive to lactose I substituted a cashew cream sauce for the milk. It’s very creamy and thick and almost has a cheesy flavor to it. I’m sure we will be making this again. May only do one chipotle next time since my husband has very “blandinavian” taste buds as well. great recipe though, I love how quick yet flavorful it is!

This is definitely one of the best recipes I’ve made from this site! Sooo delicious and flavorful. I didn’t change a thing except sautéing some onion and Serrano in the butter before adding the chipotle sauce to the pan( my husband loves spicy food). Otherwise I followed it exactly and it was delicious!

Good, but I agree that the sauce as written lacks depth. After tasting it, I made a few changes. I added some garlic and green onion as well as another chile, plus some adobo sauce. I did not add salt; in fact, I found the bouillon alone made it too salty and will decrease the amount next time.  It still needs something, but I am not sure what; however it is definitely worth some tinkering.  Btw, I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and seasoned them with a little salt, pepper, garlic, and paprika.

This was very good.  The chipotle peppers in adobo were perfect for giving the recipe enough zing and an interesting smoky flavor.  I used 1% milk but would guess whole milk would be better tasting.

I followed other recommendations by adding chopped onion (~1 cup)  & garlic (3 cloves) to the butter in a cast iron skillet, sautéing until soft before adding the sour cream/chipotle purée. I also sprinkled the leg quarters with garlic & onion powder along with some salt & pepper before roasting it. I suggest you add some of the chicken juices from roasting to the skillet to thin out the sauce. It’s quite good with these modifications. I’ll be making this again.

Adjusted the recipe for 12 legs but use 12 thighs instead, just to make sure we have plenty of that great sauce for our rice.  When in Mexico I use only 2 chipotles, they seem to be larger or hotter, maybe both, then when we get home in the states, I will use 3 chipotles.  Haven’t had much luck with the beef or pork in Mexico, so we do a lot with chicken and ground beef.  Goulash Supreme from this site is another favorite, kind of a mexican twist on homemade Hamburger Helper.

Thanks for posting your recipe!

Oooooo girl, you hit it out of the ballpark with this! The only ingredient change I made was to sub plain yogurt for the sour cream. I used one pepper and removed the seeds 'cause I'm a weenie. I made half the recipe with 4 thighs. (Baked with skin on then removed before simmering.) Served it with the sauce over cilantro lime rice. Delish!!

The sauce was bland with a slight heat to it.  I used the chillies in adobe sauce with the lowest sodium and it still tasted pretty salty to me. I do not use a lot of salt in my cooking or on my food. A pinch, typically is more than enough.  Will not be making this again.

The sauce is amazing.  I would just leave the chicken in the oven a little longer (about an hour) but maybe my oven is a little older and it takes longer for my chicken to cook.

I was very impressed by this dish. I think the next time I will buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco and shred the chicken and mix it in the sauce and serve as tacos with onion and cilantro as the topping.

Super simple and very yummy. I added 1/4 t cumin for added flavor. I also substituted Mexican Crema for the sour cream and cut that and the milk in half. No added salt needed since the chicken was already salted and bouillon has salt. Be cautious with the Chipotle. They are very hot. For those that don't handle spicy heat, add just a teaspoon of the Chipotles or half of one, mince or add it to the blender. When the sauce is assembled and cooking taste. If more heat is desired add more of the adobo sauce. You can keep adding a little at a time until it is just right. If you get too much, add a bit more crema or milk.

My Mexican husband was not impressed. He says it lacks flavor. I used 4 peppers and it was not very hot. Maybe by adding cumin and garlic to the sauce it would be better. It needs something but I'm not sure what.

This was wonderful! Browned the leg quarters in the oven about 40 minutes, then smothered in the sauce and baked another 10 minutes. Added a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Soooo easy and delicious!! It's a keeper!!

Will make again.  Seasoned the chicken first with powdered onion, garlic salt, cumin, Mexican oregano, black pepper, poblano chile powder.  Used 3 chipolte peppers instead of 2.  Served over white rice, and carrots on the side.  Yum!

This is a good base recipe. I did change and added some stuff to up the flavor. I first marinated the chicken in some adobo, smoked paprika, and ground garlic and ground oregano. For about 20 minutes while I was preparing the other stuff. I than chopped up one medium onion and minced 4 garlic cloves added it to the oil/ butter mixture. I sautéed the onion/ garlic for about 5 minutes and than added the chicken to the pot in the mixture and browned the chicken.  In the blender, I omitted the chicken granule because I didn't have it. Blended the rested of the stuff. Added to the chicken add chicken stock  2 cups let it simmer on the stove on medium heat for 30 minutes added chopped cilantro towards the end, adjusted the salt and pepper. It was wonderful that my hubby couldn't get enough of it.

I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted with cream cheese (one block) and I used just one pepper for a milder sauce.  I also added chopped onions and minced garlic.  Seriously this is definitely going into rotation!!  Even if I didn't add the onion and garlic this would be so good, lots of flavor and different than the usual chicken dish!

This recipe was very delicious.  Before I roasted the chicken in the oven I lightly seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder.   I wanted a little more sauce so I used 16 oz of light sour cream and 2cups of milk.  I kept the amout of chipotle peppers and chicken bouillon the same.  It was a hit with the family. Very flavorful and creamy.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I improvised because I didn't have chipotle in adobo, but it still came out great! I used 2 tsp of chipotle powder, 5 tsp of ketchup, 2 tsp of apple cider, and tsp of minced garlic in place of the adobo. To add a bit more heat, I also added some red chili pepper powder (will probably tone this down next time though haha). I also used chicken breasts like some of the other reviewers, and the whole family loved it. Will definitely make this again, and I'll try to have all of the ingredients next time! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this almost to a T except added chili peppers instead of chipotle peppers. My pickiest eater ate all of her plate. My "eater" didn't care for it at all. I may make this again but definitely with more "heat" and with boneless chicken instead.

This is one of my family's favorite chicken recipes. I always double the sauce and serve it with a Mexican rice recipe that uses chicken stock, celery stalks and a whole serrano chili pepper to cook long grain white rice after sauteing the rice a bit in olive oil. Sometimes to save time, I use cubed chicken breasts instead of legs. My adult son always requests this when he comes home. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum! I halved the recipe and cubed chicken breasts. Brown them at a high heat, and then removed them, added garlic and onions and then the puree sauce. Added the chicken back in to simmer for 15 minutes. So tasty! Thanks!

Easy and delicious.  I shredded chicken off bone and let it marinate in the sauce, served with rice, black beans, guacamole on flour tortillas. I will try on shredded pork as well.  I would like to try making chicken breasts in the crockpot to shred easier necpxt time, I did not feel like the roasting was that much of a benefit.

Loved this, great flavor. I did sauté onions and garlic for more depth of flavor and added to sauce. My husband prefers boneless, skinless chicken so I will try that next time as others have suggested.

I'm a big fan of spicy food, and I love canned chipotles. Be aware that not all chipotles are the same--some of naturally hotter than others. If you're concerned about the heat, start with one. You can always add more, but you can't subtract. Be sure to include some of the adobo sauce from the can--this is what makes canned chipotle peppers particularly special. Again, beware of the heat in the adobo, too. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added about 1/2 of a small onion and several cloves of garlic (sautéed first) to the sauce. In the end, my sauce was good, but it needed salt. While the recipe says "salt to taste," more specific guidance would have been helpful. I also would suggest seasoning the chicken before roasting it in the oven--it's important if you want to develop layers of flavor. At the very least, use salt and pepper on the chicken. I noticed one review where the reviewer curdled the sauce. Sorry, but that's not a problem with the recipe, it's a problem with technique. If you pour the sauce into a really hot pan, of course the milk will curdle. If you start it in a cold pan, and heat it slowly, it will be fine. I served this over rice. It's a good, but not perfect recipe. But, it's super easy--and that is a big plus in my book.

I make this recipe at least once a month, it's a great base. The reviewer stating that one can of Chipotle peppers was so hot it was inedible apparently doesn't like spicy food. I personally put two cans of Chipotle peppers in the blender (la costena are my favorite) along with most of a head of garlic and one bunch of cilantro. it tastes amazing, and just spicy enough!

For a faster cooking time, I dice boneless chicken breast and sauté it on the stove, then add the sauce on top to cook for a few minutes. Served on warm flour tortillas it is a huge hit at our house

I love this recipe!! The only reason I'm giving it four instead of give stars is I felt it needed more than just the could flavor. Second time I made the recipe, I cooked half and onion and one Clove of garlic with the butter before adding the pureed sauce, then topped with chopped cilantro. Fantastic!!!

WOW. That sauce was amazing. I added an extra chipotle for some more flavor and it was perfect. I cannot wait to make this again. Make sure you have some rice on hand to soak up the sauce!

I find this tasty as is, but reduce the chicken bouillon by 1/4 or more, planning on trying low fat sour cream next. I do prefer to add extra chipotles for spice but really this recipe doesn't need the addition of other ingredients. I only make it with boneless breast but betting brown chicken tastes even better. 
Yesterday I decided to use the sauce as enchilada sauce. Cooked the chicken in the sauce still, just reserved the better part of it for the enchiladas. Some yellow corn tortillas, jack and cheddar cheese and this was a hit, just thinking about it now is making me hungry.

I loved it, make it all the time. I substitute sour cream for greek yogurt. Plus I season my chicken with chicken seasoning and olive oil rub it thoroughly. And then put in the oven for 2 hrs at 350 degrees. at the end goes the sauce. Its great.....

Yum! This had just the flavor I was looking for.. It was a bit salty, so next time I'll cut back on the chicken bouillon (I didn't add any extra salt). After blending the sauce & tasting, I decided to add an extra chipotle pepper, a bit of paprika & freshly ground black pepper for personal taste & added color. I do advise tasting before adding extra, though, as the heat can vary a lot in the peppers. I served it over rice, with streamed broccoli & a fresh salad on the side. The sauce flavored the rice nicely, too. This is definitely going into the rotation. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make exactly as written, the only change I make is sometimes I use pork chops instead of chicken.

My husband is the chef in the family but loves this every time I make it!  I use just thighs and thicken the sauce with a cold water/flour mixture.  I also add an extra chipotle pepper and some of the adobo sauce for extra spice!

The taste on this was really good.  It had a lot of flavor.  I followed recipe exactly and it was way to spicy for my family.  I am a lover of spice and I could tell it was spicy.  I give it 3 stars because out of the 3 of us only 1 ate it.  But for my it was tasty.

This gave me the idea I needed to get what I wanted. I added chopped tomato, chopped onion, oregano, cilantro, 2 cloves of garlic. The adobo sauce was too spicy for my clan, so I rinsed off the peppers and only blended one into the sauce, and let the other one simmer without cutting it open. The sour cream helped to soften the spice, and still gave me the chipotle flavor that I really wanted. I also used chicken breasts.

Made this tonight and used all the ingredients in the proportions listed in the recipe. Opted to change the method of cooking. I removed the skin from the chicken. Browned (half cooked) the chicken in a covered skillet, added the sauce and finished it off (covered) in the oven. So easy and EXCELLENT flavor.  Served over white rice. The sauce is delicious.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and this turned out great. Very easy, simple, and quick. A nice change from the typical chicken recipes. Very good flavor.

Good base sauce recipe! I did tweak mine. Sour Cream, milk, 2 cubes of bouillion and chipotle was a bit bland. So, I sauted garlic, onion and quartered cherry tomatoes in the butter, added 3/4 C red wine until reduced, then slowly, a little at a time, added the sauce mixture. No curdling here, but I did take the pan off the heat before I added the sauce to the saute. Do taste your sauce first before adding more salt, but I put in fresh ground pepper and fresh ground corriander seed if you're being salt conscious. 4 chipotle peppers was the perfect amount if you like a little more heat. I rubbed salt, pepper and onion powder on my chicken legs and baked for 50 mins. Finally, when you've added the chicken to the sauce, sprinkle chopped cilantro on top for that extra exotic flavour.  Everyone loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

The sauce is delicious! It goes without saying to customize the heat to your liking.  I made it as is (removed the seeds from the peppers though) and it was pretty much perfect.  I used chicken legs and added a bit of garlic, but other than that I followed the directions completely.  Great dish.   I'll make it again for sure.  I love the sauce so much I do want to try boneless thighs or breasts shredded and just serve it over rice or as tacos.

I loved this! I used an entire 7 oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce since I'm a total spice nut. I thought it was absolutely awesome. 

It did not curdle on me but I was careful after reading those reviews. To keep it from curdling I made sure to add the cream to the margarine slowly, while whisking continuously. I kept the heat very low to make sure it slowly came up to temperature. It takes a few more minutes but it's totally worth it.

This was FANTASTIC!!! Everyone in the family household absolutely loved it. I doubled the sauce portions which I thought made a great compliment serving it with Quinoa. I looking forward to the leftovers. I might try using thighs next time.

My husband and I enjoyed the sauce.  I used half and half instead of milk.  As others, I only served the sauceon the side, I did not want my chicken skin to loose its crispness.  With each mouthful, the more I liked it.  We also decided it would make a goood wing sauce.

I loved it!  I did not have to change a thing.  I was hesitant about the chipotle but the sour cream tamed the heat.  In fact i added a little bit extra chipotle for more heat.  I will be making this dish again.

I made this with boneless chicken breasts fried in vegetable oil and served this with plain white rice.
I added some tomato sauce since I probably put 3 chiles instead of 2 by accident and also added some currants (raisins would be fine too) since this cut down on the heat a bit from the chiles.
Most spicy and delicious!
This is a go to recipe!
Easy to make and yummy, just need milk, sour cream and bouillon!

Really like the sauce...but the sauce to chicken recipe is not adequate.  Also, don't use chicken leg quarters - yuck!!  Next time, I would try boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Was good, different, just not exciting. I started with seasoned chicken leftover from a roasted bird, sauteed some onions & garlic in the butter prior to adding the pureed mixture. I doubled the chipotles & added a few spoonful's of the adobo sauce. Definitely needed some salt but even then didn't have as much flavor as I'd expected. It was good enough for me to try again but I will play with adding more flavor next time....

This was a time I should have totally ignored what others said and gone with what I knew from past experience.  A friend of mine used to make her version of Chipolte Chicken by blending the peppers with tomato sauce and sour cream, letting the chicken simmer until tender (she had prebrowned it), and she would add some thinly sliced onions and peppers, mostly for color.  One of the reviewers suggested whirring onion and garlic with the sour cream mixture; I'm still simmering to try to get rid of the raw onion flavor!  My advice (that I should follow) is to use a recipe as written, then tweak.  I'm learning from my mistake after having to find something else to eat tonight!  I will say, it's not greasy.  I'm not sure why one or two people had that problem.  I'm hoping this will be delicious tomorrow.

This was an excellent dish and easy to prepare. I made a few changes instead of 8 leg quarters i used 4, i also doubled the sauce recipe and i used 2% milk and fat free sour cream. My family loves extra sauce for the rice and honestly i can not beleive that the sauce in recipe was enough for 8 leg quarters.

Way too hot for this Irish kid.  I removed the seeds from the peppers as suggested and still hot to me.  Actually I could tame down the heat but the taste wasn't really to my liking either, but again, not really a fan of Mexican food in general.  I do appreciate others fill find this is right up their alley.  --enjoy

DELICIOUS!!!  Came out very salty, but that may have been user error!  Next time i will try it with less consume (chix bouillon)  served it with medium sized pasta shells, which was excellent because it nestled the sauce beautifully with each bite.  Yum!

This is such a fantastic recipe! I use pretty inexpensive manager's special chicken legs with this recipe because you simply cannot tell any difference! I use whole milk but reduced fat sour cream and since my husband and I love spicy foods, I use 3-4 of the chipotle peppers. I think this is my husband's absoulte favorite dish and it could not be simpler. Four meals for two comes out to about eight dollars, including rice and green beans. You can't beat it. Thanks!!!

3.5 stars:  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (sliced) and thickened it with cornstarch at the end. My husband had seconds, which surprised me considering he does not like a lot of sour cream-based dishes.

Man, I LOVED this recipe! Came across it tonight and was going to make it because I thought I had sour cream...but didn't. Had to substitute it with a cup of not only of yogurt, but vanilla yogurt (looked it up and had to add a tbsp of flour and 2 tspn of water to be sour cream substitute). I also added one extra chipotle pepper because I figured the recipe would be mild and I like a bold/spicy taste.  It was awesome with chicken breasts!  Will definitely make it over and over again!

Our family loved this recipe- very tasty! However -unsure if this was operator error or not- but the skins on the chickens never got crispy even after an hour in the oven. We threw them in the sauce anyways and they came out very soggy. Other than that it was great. Neigh.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I have had a small can of chipotle in adobo sauce in the pantry calling my name, this was perfect.  Although I will say, like one of the other reviewers- I added way too much chipotle (about 2/3 of the small can) b/c my 8 yr old thought she was supposed to add the whole can and I didn't catch her until it was already blended... so it was very spicy, but good enough to know that with a little less pepper it should be great!  I did cut up b/l, s/l chix breasts and sautee those with seasoning then added sauce and served over brown rice.  Kids put theirs in tortillas.  Winner!

The sauce was delicious and spicy! I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts (chopped) and sauted them with diced onion and montreal chicken seasoning.  Followed the sauce exactly, except I added in a garlic clove.  This made a TON of sauce.  Served with Vigo yellow rice.  The BF loved it so it must have been good :)  Would love to try this as enchiladas at some point...

I made this couple of days ago and Tracy's tip from 2007 was helpful. Do not go over board with the peppers.  Everybody liked the dish and it is a definite repeat. I had to go with a bit more milk because I did not have enough sour cream. Next time I will try skinless chicken because the skin left a lot of grease.

Every time I make this, it seems to come out even better! Even my husband, who can be persnickety about food, goes back for seconds and thirds.  One touch that I like to add is tossing one can of drained whole pinto beans into the sauce at the end with the chicken. We then serve over unenriched/gluten free brown rice, with tortillas on the side. Delish!

I loved the basic flavor ideas of this recipe, but changed it pretty drastically to fit ingredients that I had on hand.  From several comments, I liked the idea of browning chicken breasts (boneless, skinless).  To lighten up on calories and fat, I used chicken broth as the primary liquid. *Lemon-thyme sprigs and a small amount of minced, sauteed garlic added add’l flavor.  Keeping the chipotles, I reduced the milk to @ 1/4 cup and the sour cream to a generous tbl., but omitted the marg and bouillon.  With lid on, the chicken finished cooking in the sauce for @ 15 minutes while the rice cooked.  After that time, I removed the chicken and let the sauce reduce for another 5-ish minutes, adjusting salt and pepper needs.  *The lemon thyme (about 6 sprigs) gave a mystery hint of lemon to the sauce without the actual "taste" of lemon.

Delicious.  I slow cooked the chicken at 300 until it hit 180 degrees, then simmered it in the sauce for 15 minutes.  Was falling off the bone, tender and moist.  Also added an extra chipotle pepper and about a teaspoon of garlic powder to the sauce.  Very, very good.

This was very good and easy. I didn't have the chipotle peppers it called for so I subbed chinese garlic chilli sause. It turned out great!! I didn't use anything to thicken the sause so it did curdle, but still had great flavor.

This is a amazing and really simple! I modified the recipe a little by just pouring the sauce ingredients over the legs and returning them to the oven for about 15 minutes.( One less pan to wash) I also added a little flour to thicken slightly. I omitted the margarine. I served it over basmati rice. I imagine it would be great with noodles as well. Big hit with my husband.

I cooked this for dinner the other night. It wasn't a big hit with my husband but I totally loved it! I didn't have chicken bullion cubes so once the chicken got done roasting in the oven I put all the juices from my pan into the sauce mix. I cooked it white rice and a side salad.

I cooked this for my mexican husband and his family. They loved it. The sauce was absolutely delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like chipotle peppers! We served the chicken over rice and poured the extra sauce on top. Fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good, but not something I would probably make again. Too saucy I guess, although the sauce was good. I don't know, just didn't live up to my expectations.

Wow!  Fast, easy and tastes fantastic... This doesn't need modifications unless you want to alter the number of peppers to raise/lower the heat.  Only used 1 chipotle pepper and several tablespoons of adobo sauce because husband prefers blander food and it was perfect for him. Served over rice.

H says "Great!" We really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly, and then pulled back on the bouillion at the last minute - used about half - and am glad I did, it would have been a little too salty for me. I also had to roast my chicken about 20 minutes longer than stated, but I had a BUNCH that I was cooking for another meal - with fewer it might be shorter. I'd like to make this again using sliced chicken breast for easier handling. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a really good dish, something different. I wanted something authentic for a Mexican potluck I hosted.  I cooked the chicken in a pot of a little water, then took the meat off the bones.  I made the sauce and then added the meat and simmered for a bit, then I served with rice.  It was delicious!

This recipe both introduced & made my fiance a fan of chipotle! Since we're both sick I wanted a bit of spice. Too avoid extra dished I baked this cassarole style. I used skinned chicken legs, added an onion, a few cloves of garlic, mushroom (they soaked up the flavor the most!), and subbed a few tsp of chipotle powder since I had no fresh ones on hand. Thank u for sharing!

This was a very good, authentic dish.  It was a little too spicy for me, but my husband loved it!  I also added mushrooms and sliced red onion to the sauce.

This is so delicious!  I like to put in one whole pepper and then throw in 2 more with the seeds scraped out.  The only other thing I do differently is that I use whatever chicken I have and I always remove any skin.  My little guys aren't huge fans of spicy food, but they love this!  They guzzle milk all through dinner, but they eat it all!  :)  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

great recipe with just a few ingredients.  Used bonesless, skinless chicken breasts, cooked in skillet while I prepared the sauce.  Used 3 chiles with the seeds scraped out - a bit of a kick, but the kids loved it.  I used a half cup of evaporated skim milk & 1/2 cup of 1 % milk.  Also used lowfat sour cream.  Finished the chicken while simmering the sauce.  Quick, easy, delicious.

Yummy, this was soooo good, love the smoky heat of these peppers!  I actually used 2 bone in skinless turkey thighs (they were dinner size to yield one each) as I had them out of the freezer.  Roasted them in the oven and sprinkled before hand with granulated garlic and pepper.  For the sauce, I cut the milk (1%) down to 3/4 cup, used the amnt called for in sour cream (low fat) and used 3 chipotle peppers (took out some of the seeds). I didn't have any bouillon, so skipped it.  Added my pureed sauce right to the dish that I cooked the thighs in just towards the end of cooking and just kept coating them every few minutes while they finished baking.    Next time would definitely try with boneless chicken and since I kept the sauce amnt the same, had a ton which would have been great to use with rice, so in hind sight, should have cut in half...oh well!  Regardless, really enjoyed this, thanks for sharing!

I really liked the flavor of this chicken. I didn't like it so much by itself, but I cut it into thin strips and served it inside of a corn tortilla and it was great.  I also added black refried beans, mexican rotelle tomatoes, and mexi corn (all simmered in one pot), mexican rice, lettuce, shredded mexican cheese blend, and sour cream into the tortilla.  Regarding the sauce, I thought the milk made the sauce a bit too thin.  Maybe next time I will try cream instead. I also used 4 small chipotle peppers instead of 2 and thought that the amount of chicken boullion made the sauce a bit too salty so I didn't added more salt to the simmering sauce.  Will make again, thanks!

This was simple to do. The sauce was tasty. I put in 4 peppers and I didnt have any chicken bouillion so I used chipotle bouillion (about 4 small cubes). Next time I am going to use chicken breasts - my family hates skin on their chicken and when you pull off the skin, the sauce and flavor is gone. Great recipe! Thanks!

This was fabulous!  I served it with brown rice and roasted asparagus.  I do have to agree about the lack of spice.  I put 5 chilies in and think it gave it just the right amount of kick.  Everyone raved about the sauce and I used Chicken leg quarters just because it is what I had on hand.

This recipe is a good start, but I had to make some changes.  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of drumsticks, and I cooked them with some of the adobo sauce, and white wine.  I also thought the sauce was really watery, so I used just a splash of milk, instead of the 1 1/2 cups it says to use.  I also added some garlic powder.  This recipe is really good served with rice.

My family thought the sour cream alone makes it taste a bit flat. Instead I pureed 1/2 cup of cottage cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, and a 1/4 cup milk instead because I think it gives it a fuller flavor. Also used chicken breasts and sliced them into strips, dipped them in the sauce, re-baked it until it started to brown a bit on the edges, then sprinkled with cilantro. I've made it a few times now and people love it, especially at the Cinco de Mayo potluck.

Super easy dish with a lot of flavor...quote from my husband: 'This is the best chicken dish EVER.'  Roasted chicken separately in oven, then added to sauce at the last minute to retain crispy skin.  Made sauce with half yogurt, half sour cream, and really enjoyed the tangy flavor.  I found the sauce to be a little thin even when reducing the milk amount to 1 cup...I think I will reduce even further and increase the amount of sour cream.  Maybe evaporated milk would solve the problem?  This is definitely a good recipe to experiment with further.

Awesome!!!  I used soy based sour cream guacamole flavor due to food allergies in our family, and it was still awesome.  No change in texture or off taste.

Delicious, although 2 chipotle peppers were too spicy for my wife's taste. I added a few sprigs of fresh cilantro to the blender, along with a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in a tablespoon of water, and used one cup of milk. The sauce came out nice and thick--and plenty of it, too! I will make this again.

I did not like this at all. In fact, after a couple of bites I could not finish it and ended up eating a bowl of cereal for dinner. I followed directions except seeded the chipotles and used low-fat milk and sour cream. The sauce is just strange, the flavors do not meld at all. I love chipotles but will not be making this again. Only reason for the 2 stars is because my husband said he sort-of liked it, but I think he was just being nice.

This recipe has great flavor but it was hot!!!  I suggest adding the chipotle gradually and testing it. We were dying at only 1 pepper. Maybe our peppers were extra hot--the can had been in the pantry for a long time. We saved the dish with sour cream served on the side. I'll definitely be reworking this recipe to make it more in the range of our 2-3 star Thai taste.
