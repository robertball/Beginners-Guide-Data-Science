This was just too strong of a bourbon taste.  Maybe I will try again with only 1 cup of bourbon, add some soy sauce, liquid smoke, and garlic and just let it marinade while I drink the other 2 cups of bourbon.

I tried this because my husband loves whisky, but the whiskey flavor was so strong even he had a hard time eating it.

I modified this recipe by rubbing a small amount of bourbon and dark brown sugar on the steaks and resting them in the frig for a couple of hours. My wife and I thought the steaks were fantastic.

Excellent recipe. Made this with only 1/2 cup of bourbon and it turned out fabulous. I put a different seasoning on the kid's portions and they decided they didn't want theirs and instead wanted the grown-up version. Very, very nice.

I loved the taste of the dark brown sugar!  I didn't use as much bourbon because I didn't have two cups.  It came our great!  I made it on my George Foreman grill - which I wouldn't recommend (came out a bit dark).I also made an Au Jus to go on the side by combining two tablespoons of the dark brown suger, 1/4 cup Worchester sauce 1/4 Teriyaki sauce and 1/2 cup water - heated for a minute in the microwave-turned out to be a nice dipping sauce!

Bourbon & Brown sugar marinades are EXCELLENT for steak! However this is a BIG WASTE of ingredients! Overkill. 1/2C bourbon & 1/4C brown sugar are more than enough for just 2 steaks. (A bit of soy and a sqeeze of lemon juice in the marinade wouldn't hurt either)

These steaks come out very tender.  You do have to be very careful about the sugared side burning however.  They also have a lot of flavor.  A great simple marinade. However, I wouldn't suggest them to anyone who didn't like the taste of bourbon.

I did not care for this recipe. The bourbon flavor was overpowering, and it was far too sweet. I ended up reducing the leftover marinade somewhat to burn off the alcohol, then adding a cup of beef broth into which I mixed 1-1/2 Tb cornstarch. Added the juice of half a lemon to try to cut the sweetness. It was a marginally better, but was still too sweet.

I did not grill the steaks instead I cooked them in the oven.  I added just 1/4 cup of bourbon because I think that bourbon has a strong taste.  I used 1 1/2 cups of light brown sugar.  Additionally, I added 1 tablespoon of worchester sause and soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of parsley flakes and onion powder.  The results were tender steaks with a sweet (not over bearing) taste.  I will use this recipe again but I will decrease the brown sugar.

Did the allrecipes.com staff try this before allowing the post? 3 cups of bourbon to marinade 2 steaks? i used 1 cup with the 1 cup of sugar and brushed the steaks with it, threw them into the fridge for a few hours and grilled.

All we could taste was bourbon!  Maybe I cooked it wrong, but I wouldn't waste an expensive cut of meat trying this again.

very good, but it's right on the cusp of being incredible. i only used 2 cups of burbon and 3/4 cup of sugar, and it came out a bit sweet. I think a pinch or two of salt will kick this up to the next level. I really can't wait. :D

I used 1 inch thick Kansas city strip steaks and didn't cut or mallet them. I mixed together 1 shot of bourbon and 1 shot of brown sugar and let the steaks  marinade in the mixture for an hour. With a little salt and pepper they were great. They had a very subtle flavor that enhanced the meat. I would use this again

Just last night, my roommate and I served this recipe to 7 guest and everyone just loved it.  I am not a whisky drinker nor where most of our guest.  But our dinner was a hit. Everyone loved the taste, it was so juicy and sweet. We didn't use has much Whisky due to not having very much around. But what we had was perfect.  the mixture of the whiskey with the dark brown sugar just gave the meat a nice coating.  I would recommend this recipe for anyone.  This recipe is diffenatly one that's going in my recipe box.

Tastes amazing off the grill! Marinaded rib eyes for about 20 hours in Zsip-Loc bag with this, kneading occasionally to prevent the brown sugar from settling too much. Seared the steaks over flaming coals while continuing to baste with this marinade, then moved the steaks to the 'cool' side of the grill and continued to baste them while grilling to an almost-perfect medium-rare. Served with a fairly dry Cab Sav and some honey-butter flaked biscuits, this is a phenomenal marinade.

I tried this recipe twice, the first time was absolutely fantastic, but my wife didn't want to try it, so the next time i made it for both of us and it was WAY too sweet and neither of us liked it.  I'm not sure what I did differently, but there is some promise there. Maybe I will try it again.

Not bad. I also, like everyone, cut the whiskey down dramatically. I tasted almost buttery - nice - maybe some mushrooms ina  reduced sauce would be great with it!

I reduced the brown sugar and whiskey by more than a half and still found the recipe too sweet and the bourbon overpowering. This recipe was not my thing.

Like others, I didn't use nearly as much burbon as the recipe calls for.  I used about a shot cup worth, if that.  Also used enough brown sugar to make a nice rub out of it.  Let marinade for about an hour before grilling.  Very good flavor and the burbon wasn't overwhelming.  The sugar makes a nice carmelization on the outside of the meat.

We thought this was good, but not amazing.  Maybe because we're not huge fans of bourbon, I don't know.  The flavor was a bit much for us.  We prefer the savory garlic marinated steak recipe on this site.  But it's still a great marinade and it was nice trying something different.  Thanks! :)

i thought this was great but i like sweet.  My husband on the other hand thought that it needs some liquid smoke in it to mellow the sweetness down. However it was great to me.

This was my first time cooking a steak, but it turned out wonderfully! My steak was thick, so it took longer to grill than the recipe called for. My husband was shocked by the sweetness when he took his first bite, but he ended up loving it!

This is just a wonderful recipe, though you do have to enjoy bourbon a good bit to enjoy it.

I read the reviews beforehand and agreed that 3 cups seemed like a lot of whiskey to use for 12 ounces of strip. Plus, my hubby's bottle of Jim Beam was getting a little low and I didn't want to use it all in cooking so I went with 1/2 cup as another suggested and I let it marinate for almost 10 hours. Strong whiskey taste yes but I think that is the whole idea of the recipe. We both enjoyed it but I do think it could use a little bit of liquid smoke and salt in the marinade and will add them next time.

My 24 year old and I loved it, My 17 year did not.  I put 1 cup of Bourbon and will put 3/4 cup next time,  1/2 cup brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I do not usually marinate steaks, this was a delightful change, served with rice and green salad.

I read the other reviews and so I changed the recipe up a little, I used a 1/2 cup of bourbon, and 1/2 cup of coffee. It turned out prettygood.

The marinade did make the steak very tender and moist but the taste was nothing at all like Applebees Bourbon Street Steak. If that is what you are looking for this isn't it. Not even close. Won't try this again. Oh- did follow the recipe exactly.

My husband and I love this recipe. We use a little less bourbon, but the bourbon taste adds so much to the steak. I am not a huge bourbon fan, but these steaks are delicious!

We could not get our grill to work so we had to commit the sin of making them in a frying pan, but it worked out since the pan kept in the sugar and bourbon so it carmelized nicely.  I think I would use even more sugar if I made these on the grill, the sweetness of the juices was amazing.

Hmmm.  I wanted to absolutely love this steak... It was really good, but not excellent.  I only needed half the amount of bourbon...it just seemed like too much with the full amount.
Definitely worth a try, though!

This was good. I marinated my steaks for about 7 hours. The flavour of the bourbon really went through the steak and the sugar caramelised the outside nicely.

i didn't use as much bourbon. rubbed on brown sugar. dropped a bunch in the bourbon and rubbed both sides.
sat for an hour and a half.
on the grill, once it was a nice even hot grill, seared 1 side for about 3 minutes, flipped and did the same.
flipped back to side 1, and added more Bourbon Sugar mix. fire will jump up so be careful. did both sides again for 2-3 minutes.
flipped to side 1 again and added a bit of soy sauce and a dash of lime juice. (i had no lemon juice)
just prior to taking off the grill, i added a dash of pepper to 1 side.
let sit on plate for a few minutes, and well, they steaks were gone in minutes!!

This was very tasty.   The only downside was the cost of the steaks and the bottle of whiskey.  We could have eaten the same meal in a restaurant with a professional chef cooking for almost the same cost.

I only used 2 cups of bourbon. I thought that 3 was a bit much for my steaks. The grill went rouge on me but I caught it in time to save the meal. It turned out amazing. My son, daughter n law and my grand baby made a special trip to enjoy it with us.

steak was nice on its own, did mine in the George Foreman, nicely seered and evenly cooked to medium. Served up with grilled courgette and a home made slaw/salad. Also used the remaining Bourbon and sugar to make a Tennesee Bbq sauce.

I made this for my husband and used a cup of bourbon whiskey or less with brown sugar. It was delicious. He really enjoyed the steak. Perhaps, this recipe should be updated to reduce the cups of bourbon whiskey .

My husband didn't care for these at all, he says he wants his whiskey in a glass, not in his steak. Since I'm not a fan of steaks I thought this was ok, because whiskey covered the taste of meat, haha. We won't be making these again.

The sweetness gives these steaks a taste that I just couldn't handle. A big load of calories with an undesirable steak taste.

This recipe is great.  It is so easy to make.  My husband  I have used this on other types of steak  it has turn out just as good each and everytime.  You won't be disappointed.
