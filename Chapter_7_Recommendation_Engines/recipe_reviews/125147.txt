This recipe was very good but the times listed are deceptive.  I didn't read closely before going to the store and went by the "ready in 20 min" at the top of the page, but in reality, the pie requires about 2-2.5 hours to set.  It should appear as 20 minutes of prep time, but ready in about 3 hours!  The pie was really tasty when it was finally ready though.

This recipe was really simple to make, and turned out great! My husband raved about it. We both love graham cracker crust over regular pie crust, and the flavor goes great with this filling. We used fresh rhubarb and strawberries. My gelatin started thickening in about an hour's time.

I reduced the rhubarb on this recipe and used Cool Whip and it was so delicious.  I shared it with my neighbors and they are eager for me to make another pie.  Especially since the Rhubarb is grown in both of our backyards.  

All though the time on top reads 20 minutes and it is more like two hours.

Everyone loved this pie. To use what was on hand I made quite a few changes - raspberries and raspberry jello, a tub of cool whip instead of the envelope, and both the jello and cool whip were sugarfree. I was wary of boiling the rhubarb so briefly, but the pieces were perfectly tender (mine were about 1/2 inch long). The pie had enough sweetness to be a treat, but that punch of rhubarb I love wasn't lost. Thank you very much for sharing this refreshing pie!
