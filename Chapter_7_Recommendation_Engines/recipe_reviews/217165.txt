This recipies is not for Texans that are used to Texan food. IF you like Real Mexican food this is the recipie for you. This is Authentic Mexican dish and it is served with Beans. We call them Frijoles de Olla and it best eaten with Corn tortillas.

Being a native Texan and having the luxury of eating real Mexican cuisine on a regular basis, I have to say that this recipe was a huge disappointment to say the least. My number one favorite entree at a local hole in the wall Cantina is Carne con chili and it's packed with flavor. I hate to knock anyone's recipe as I am not a cook by any means but this dish wasn't even remotely comparable. There is no flavor. It tasted like green tomatoes with an overwhelming amount of heat and I love spicy foods. 

I guess the only positive thing I can say is that it's likely a good start to a decent sauce but needs much more flavor added.

This is a real good recipe! I just made it, and it tastes amazing! You can also change it around, if you want more of a red sauce, by adding more tomatoes and less tomatillos. Also instead of discarding the garlic, I added it to the blender with the rest of ingredients. either way, it's REALLY good and very easy to make! Also if you don't have or can't find chile de arbol, you can use Cayenne peppers :)

It was very very good. Spicy though. I love spicy. My kids like the low heat stuff, but this was soooo good they ate it as giants beads of sweat rolled down their face. Lol.
Thank you for this great recipe.
(I will have to take it down on the peppers next time, for the kids. Lol)

Delicious! I made with leftover flank steak that I sliced and saut√©ed prior to adding the salsa mixture. I played around with adding a few of the peppers in the blender at a time until I was happy with the heat.
