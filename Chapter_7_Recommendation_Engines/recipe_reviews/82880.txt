Great for Oysters.  Maybe a little too much garlic and in general I think the recipe makes too much butter for the amount of shellfish.  The flavor is good, but I tried it on clams too and was not a fan. Probably more because clams taste too fishy too me.

Very very good! Probably the best Oyster recipe out there. Try the butter on clams and mussels as well!

These are REALLY delicious. I mourn not living in an area where I can get fresh oysters, but it still worked out very well, minus the extra work to open the oysters that wouldn't open on their own. HIGHLY recommended.

Great Recipe! I celebrated my father's birthday with a seafood night and the butter was a hit! Hits the spot with steamed/grilled shrimp, oysters and crab meat! Will definitely use this recipe again.

I made a version of this for a tailgate party at a football game. I didnt add the Sriracha sauce merely because I was trying to make the butter with ingredients I had on hand. I also used red onion instead of shallot. It was awesome and definitely a hit. Next time I will make this with the chili of some kind, and maybe a pinch of grated Havarti on top of the oyster. I will make again.

This is an awesome recipe, although if you are making a dozen oysters, cut the butter sauce in half and you will still have some left over. Speaking of which....I used my left over sriracha butter to put over salmon a couple nights later, and it was absolutely killer.

Delicious, don't change a thing, BUT...forget about the butter log, wrapped in wax paper etc...you don't need it.  Use room temperature butter, soften slightly in the microwave if you must add all other ingredients and let it start to harden on the counter before you cook...makes a soft paste.  Follow directions and glob on a spoonful at the end of cooking!  OH YUMMY!

I lost recipie but had all ingredients when we went camping at the coast. I whipped up all the ingredients to the best of my recollection. 
Wow, everyone could not stop raving and eating them. People who don't normally eat oysters dug in as other encouraged them because of how good they were. Even people who don't like cilantro ate them and said they were delicious. I would easily give this recipie a delicious!

These were fantastic, and a great combination of flavors.  I made this in a rental condo in Florida, and we didn't have a grill.  The oysters opened easily using the oven.  The only other changes I did was not bothering to make a butter log, but just simply spooned the softened butter mixture onto each opened oyster, and then topped them all with Parmesan cheese before putting them back into the oven under the broiler to finish them up.  So good!  The Parmesan cheese is a must.

I've tried this recipe 4 times now and its freaking awesome and I've only got the best of the best compliments when I make it.  I see no reason to hot shuck the oysters.  I think shucking them cold is much easier, and it allows you to prepare ahead of time.  It tastes just as good to cook them open face with the butter, just be careful of flame-ups and turn the grill down a bit once you place the oysters and butter down.

Yummmmmmm!  This turned out great!  Only modification I had to make was to sum minced onion for the shallot.  Sriracha is a must, don't leave it out.  As other reviewer noted, this makes way more than needed for 12 oysters.  I baked Costco frozen halibut filets for dinner last night and topped with pats of the left over butter in the last 2 minutes of baking (11 min. total at 400 degrees). Another hit in my house!  Thanks, Chef Dad, for this tasty recipe.
