This is a good recipe but it would be blend if followed exactly. So, here are the changes I made: (1) Use cooking spray.  Butter would be too heavy and the leftover is greasy. (2) Marinated whole chicken breasts with 3tbsp each of soy sauce, lime juice, and tequila for overnight. To make the paste (made a day ahead): (3) Doubled the amount of the ingredients for the paste (I actually shopped 2 jalapeno peppers myself!). (4) Also added ~2/3 cup finely chopped cilantro. Sauté the garlic, jalapeno and cilantro together then added the chicken stock, tequila and lime juice (doubled the volume of the liquids too) and simmer to a paste (took ~40min). (5) Drained marinate and brown the whole chicken breasts. Removed the chicken breasts from pan, let cool slightly then tear to strips about the width of 2-fingers. This gave a much better texture than cubed. (6) Because I didn’t think the flavor would be enough with just the paste so in a small saucepan, I reduced 1 cup of chicken stock with 1/2 cup of tequila, 3 tbsp of lime juice, 1tbsp of soy sauce to ~1/2 the volume. I think in the future, I would use more tequila, stock and lime for the paste and eliminate this step. (7) Sautéed the pepper slices for 1 minute and remove from pan (don’t over cook). (8) Sautéed the onion slices then mix in the chicken strips. Sprinkled a pinch of flour (to absorb grease). Mix well. (9) Mixed ~1tsp of arrowroot starch (or any thickener) with ~3/4~1cup of half-&-half, then added to the chicken/onion mi

Delicious! But I had to make a few of my own changes to get there. I left out the oil and used much less cream (extra chicken stock for liquid). I used yellow bell pepper instead of red & green, and seasoned with extra lime, sea salt, and cilantro and a small bit of honey at the end.  My husband loved it!

I love this recipe! My husband and I have been making this for over a year and it is our favorite.  It is delicious over rice or pasta. Unless you love heavy cream, I would recommend using about 2/3 the recipe amounts. For tequila lovers, use up to two times the recipe amounts for stock and tequila. It is also much quicker to put the chicken in one skillet and the veggies in another so you can cook them at the same time. A pinch of cayenne also makes a great addition.

Great dish. I used green bell pepper, and white onion. Instead of using heavy cream I doubled the chicken broth. I also added green chile and used corn starch to thicken once the flavors cooked in. This one is a winner!

Update to my previous review!  Ok, I've done this dish now four times and it has to be in my top 3 chicken dishes I've prepared so far from this great website.  It's sooooo tasty!  To make things more interesting, I doubled the amount of tequila!  Other than that, I followed the recipe as instructed and it turned out absolutely great.  As a side-dish, I cooked the Mexican sour cream rice and it's a great combination...along with savory deviled eggs!  An absolute winner of a combination and dish!  Kudos to Brenda, the author of this great chicken recipe!

This was soo good! I made a few substitutions though, I used tequila sunrise (a gift I will never drink) and I left out the cheese mostly because I forgot. Served over rice. It was such a nice light meal and I'm sure the orange changed it alot but this will be made many many times

We make this all the time! Grill the chicken- it is really good this way. We like to add a whole onion-it is not too intense, just adds more veggies. you can add whatever color peppers suit your fancy. Penne pasta is our favorite to pair w/ this. ENJOY

Even my picky son likes this one. It took me 30 minutes to thicken the sauce, but it turned out great.  Served with Mexican rice and corn.

This is good stuff! Although it took me about 45 minutes to cook the sauce down to a paste. I added fresh ground pepper and a little cumin. Omitted the green and red peppers. Served it with spaghetti. Delicious!

I used bourbon instead of tequila because I didn't have any.  I served it over mashed taties and it was good.  It needed some more flavor though, I'm not sure what.  I would double the jalapenos though; I couldn't even taste them.  I will make it again but try some modifications.

This was really good - I just made it with rice and am completely stuffed.  I used a shredded mexican blend instead of romano and doubled the tequila paste.  I have to admit, while this was rich and delicious, the tequila paste I didn't taste much - next time I might I make some modifications.  Delicious start though!

Like others stated, it took an hour for the sauce to boil down, and even then it still wasn't quite a "paste".  I lowered the butter for the sauce to just 1 tbsp per others' suggestion.  Next time I'll double the "paste" portion, keeping everything else the same.  I felt the tequila/lime flavor could have been a little more prominent.  I only used about 1/2tbsp of oil for the chicken.  I also didn't add the full amount of heavy cream (I probably used about 1C or so).  I omitted the cilantro (didn't have any) and used grated Parmesan in place of the Romano.  Served over rice.  Despite the discrepancies, it was delicious!  I'd make this again with a few tweaks!

I made this as posted. It took nearly an hour to cook down to a paste. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was delicious. I will reduce the amount of butter for the paste the next time as it was a bit greasy. I'm giving this 5 stars since my husband who hates sauces went back for seconds.
