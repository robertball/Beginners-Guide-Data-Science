These were a big hit at my house and didn't last long at all! I think they would go well with a side of rice as a fun, different meal.

These were very good- though I'm glad I followed my instincts and cut way back on the salt.  I used 1 TEASPOON Diamond CrystalÂ® Kosher Salt, the called for amount would have made this dish inedible.  The recipe makes more than enough filling, even after piling the mushrooms high (and scooping out a sizable amount of the inside of the mushroom as the recipe called for) there was extra.  I'm not complaining, though- I could (and did!) eat this stuff with a spoon.  I ended up having to bake these for 10 minutes more than the recipe called for in order to get the mushroom to cook, and I probably could have left them in longer.  In the future I think I would increase the baking temperature to 400.  All of that being said, the filling is REALLY tasty, this is definitely a keeper!

This turned out very moist and delicious.  I would like to sub crabmeat for the chicken next time!!     I made as per the directions, but did add some white wine to the pan to cook them in.
