My first time making a shrimp stir fry, and itâ€™s really good! Made adjustments to bring the taste up. I marinated the fresh veggies (onions, chopped garlic, snow peas, chopped zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, red/yellow/green chopped peppers, sliced baby carrots) in stir fry oil until not quite soft. Added kikkoman soy sauce, soy vay island sauce/marinade (for a sweet tang), 8 oz. packaged Chinese noodles (cooked for 3 minutes; drained, and rinsed), 2 tsp. chili & garlic sauce for some heat, 2 lbs. frozen cooked (tails on) shrimp, canned/sliced water chestnuts; baby corn; and bean sprouts. Simmered for about 1/2 hr. The following day it was even better!

DH liked this but thought it was a little bland as is and thought it could use more sauce and some salt. Still a good base recipe that can be easily tweaked. I substituted some things based off what I had on hand: sweet mini peppers in place of bell, and added bean sprouts in place of water chestnuts and left out the baby corn.

Great recipe, quick and flavourful! I chose to not rate it with 5 stars only for the reason that I had to make minor substitutions due to my own lack of ingredients. I used soya sauce instead of oyster sauce and was out of bamboo shoots. My husband has already asked if I will make it again.

This was a fantastic meal. I am an inexperienced cook and it still turned out great. It is fairly spicy, which I like, but others might not prefer.

It was an easy recipe to follow, and it was delicios. I, however, made it with rice and did not keep to the actual amounts that they suggested.

Really good but I feel like it's missing something
