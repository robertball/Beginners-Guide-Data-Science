Definitely a GREAT breakfast muffin... my batch turned out perfectly moist, but i did make a few changes. Instead of buttermilk, I used two cups of plain yogurt, and i replaced two tablespoons of butter with two tablespoons of apple sauce. I added half a cup of raisins which upped the sweetness. Chopped dates would probably work too. Like others, I added brown sugar: a 1/4 cup. I also used a little more whole wheat flour and a little less white flour. Finally, instead of an egg, I used egg replacer. The mix was not extremely wet and i was worried the muffins would be a little dry, but they werent at all!!!

These muffins are extremely moist and delicious.  I added 1/2 c. raisins, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/4 t. cloves.  I will definitely make them again.

good, healthy muffin. I made few slight changes.  Replace wheat bran with 1 c wheat bran and 1/2 c flax seed (ground). Replace 6 TBS molasses with 4 TBS molasses and 2 TBS honey.  Also add 2 ripe bananas.

I have been using this recipe for over one year ~ I scaled it up to make 48, which I freeze 7 per bag ~ and I find that they are delicious and very healthy.  I also add crushed walnuts (3 cups), which adds extra taste and texture, as well as nutrition.  These are the best muffins I have ever tasted.

I was worried that these wouldn't be sweet enough so I added .5 cup of brown sugar. I like that they make 2 dozen muffins. One dozen in a recipe just isn't enough. The kids ate them up like crazy so these are definitely a keeper.

Yum! It totally worked for me but with some vital changes-used whole wheat pastry for the white flour, added 1/2 cup Splenda & 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinn & used honey instead of molasses. I also used applesauce for the butter. Don't worry about these changes upping the calories-it stays low & I got 24 muffins out of this. Loved the healthy ingredients. Thanks so much!

Moist, with a nice texture, but I thought it needed a bit of sweetness.  I think I'll try again with a bit of honey or sugar.

Pretty amazing. I added about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar though. They taste wonderful and they are so moist! I bake about 3 dozen muffins every week and these will become a regular pick. Thanks!

I tweaked this a lot because I was afraid it would be too dry but wanted it more healthy and to use oat bran and frozen blueberries which I had on hand - 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup oat bran, 1/2 cup wheat bran, added 3/4 tsp baking powder, only 4 tbsp molasses and added 1/4 c brown sugar because some said not sweet enough, 2 eggs to make it more moist, 3 tbsp applesauce instead of butter, 3/4 c frozen blueberries and it was amazing!  Still might not be sweet enough for some but it was just right for me and it was really, really, moist!

Delicious! I made as stated but used honey instead of molasses and added some mixed dried fruit. I halved the recipe but now I wish I hadn't! These aren't very sweet, which is exactly what I was looking for, but other people might like them sweeter. I might add just a pinch of cinnamon or something next time for more depth and interest.

This was one of the better bran muffins I have made -- I think the molasses makes a big difference in moistness and flavor.  I added one very ripe chopped pear (I needed to use it for something) and lots of walnuts, also ground flax seed which I add to most of my muffins.  This makes a big batch.

I was searching all over the internet for a good but very healthy recipe for bran muffins. I tried recipes from other websites including Americas Test Kitchen and Martha Stewart but still couldn't find the right one. This is a VERY GOOD recipe but I made it better and arguably healthier. I used all whole what pastry flour instead of half whole and half white. I used a 50%50% mixture of wheat bran and oat bran. As other posters have noted, the muffins are not very sweet so I also added a 1/4 cup of honey and a 1/2 cup dried berries. I used one egg and one white instead of just the one egg called for in the recipe. I also substituted canola oil for the butter. Lastly, I doubled the size and only got 13 muffins but they rose higher and had the traditional "muffin top" dome. In order to keep the calories down I can only have a half a muffin for breakfast though.

I didn't listen to previous reviews about adding sugar and I was sorry I didn't.  I was worried these muffins would not be sweet enough and I was right.  They were definetely moist and with a little butter, I was able to tolerate the lack of sweetness, but I should have added sugar.  I was not crazy about this recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and is pretty good. My husband really loves them, and says they're just sweet enough for him. They weren't for me, so I added a mashed ripe banana and they were really awesome! Good recipe for a breakfast or snack muffin!

Excellent!  I really like this one.  I used margarine instead of butter and it still turned out great.  I will definatly make this again, maybe next time adding a bit of honey.
YUM!

Great recipe! Very moist. The only changes I made was to add 1/2c brown sugar mixed in with the liquid ingredients, and I exchanged 1/2c of the bran for ground flax. They turned out great.

Great muffins! Was looking for something healthy and easy for breakfast.  Made a few changes - replaced molasses with honey, buttermilk with regular milk, used all whole wheat flour and oat bran (was the only bran i could find), and replaced butter with applesauce.  I added a cup of walnuts, 1 large grated carrot, 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple and 1 teaspoon each cinnamon and cloves.  Still not sweet but I don't mind as I don't care for things too sweet.  Make sure that you grease the pan!  I used paper cups and the muffins stuck...what a waste of a good thing.

I really enjoyed these muffins, but I did make some changes suggested by the other reviewers.  I used all whole wheat flour (2 cups). I used 4 tbsp molasses and 2 tbsp honey because I don't like a strong molasses flavour. I used 2 egg whites instead 1 whole egg, and 3 tbsp unsweetened applesauce (instead of butter). I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I've added 1/3 cup of raisins to a batch, and between 1/3 - 1/2 cup of mixed blueberries and raspberries to another and they've both been delicious. Next batch I'm going to try either banana and walnuts, or cranberries and blueberries. Yum! A lot of the changes I made were just to make them a bit healthier, but they'd probably be good without the changes too.

Very good! I love the description below calling this a no-nonsense muffin, because it's so right! It has just enough sweetness with the molasses. The buttermilk is perfect, and it's quite healthy (you can buy a lower fat version) as it's a probiotic. The acid in buttermilk reacts with the soda, which helps with the leavening (so to get the best results, try making your own buttermilk with vinegar and regular milk or just use buttermilk). I love the huge amount of bran in this recipe! One tip though. I don't know what I did exactly, but somehow the melted (hot) butter hit the raw egg and the egg got cooked in my muffins! So make sure you cool your butter first before adding it in.

I really like this! I made it even a little healthier by using all whole wheat flour instead of some white flour. I added some wheat germ in place of a little of the flour. To help it rise well with all whole wheat flour, I used a little extra baking soda. I added some raisins... it was nice to add some sweetness. I don't think it needed any sugar added.

This was a fine bran recipe! Both kids ate them for breakfast without complaints! I made the following changes: used 1/4 c. molasses instead of measuring out 6 TBSP, added 1/4 c. packed brown sugar, used vanilla soymilk instead of buttermilk, used olive oil instead of butter. My baking time was 17 minutes - these rose very well. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe EXCEPT from reading past reviews I added an extra 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 cup of plumped raisins, 3/4 -1 cup of walnuts(I'm nuts about nuts in everything),1 tsp. of cinnamon,xtra 1/2 tsp of baking soda,1/4 cup of brown sugar and 3 tbs of splenda.
The muffin exceeded my expectations,  from the ingredients I thought it would taste like cardboard. I just ate two warm from the oven with  butter and grape jelly-YUM! Produced  16 medium sized for me. Very fast to whip up for breakfast.

I had some "All Bran" cereal so threw it in the food processor for the bran part of the recipe.  Added 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 nutmeg, tsp. vanilla, and used applesauce in place of the butter.  These baked up like a picture, were fluffy nice and had a nice flavor with the spices.  This made 12 regular size and 4 giant size muffins.  Very healthy and when you consider the nutrition value w/such few fat grams and the fiber, they are really great!  A wonderful breakfast muffin with a cup of coffee.

This is a good recipie, however could use soem extra flavor. I put in some orange rind and sugar on top to spice it up a bit. You could also substitute bran for bran cereal (just place in blender and make smooth).

Seemed to only make about 15 the way I filled the cups.  They're not sweet, but I made them as a joke [iced them as cupcakes for someone turning 45], and no one realized they weren't a cupcake.

These are not my favorite bran muffin for a breakfast or snack because they are not very sweet, but they are good with soup or salad-with some butter for a splurge (how I get my daughter to eat them). I have added a few tablespoons of brown sugar. If using baking soda it is important to have an acidic ingredient , such as buttermilk, to activate the leavener. These muffins are a little small, but so full of fiber. Thanks!

I think I am in love! These are awesome muffins, and so guilt-free! My slight changes were: I switched the molasses out for honey because I prefer it, added 2 tsp of cinnamon, did the 2 TBS of white vinegar plus enough skim milk to equal 2 cups in place of buttermilk, and added applesauce for the butter. They baked about 15 minutes and I just gobbled two down! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I made these for my toddlers story-hour group. they were a hit! Since it was christmas timem I added chopped dates. Oh, also I oddly had no eggs, so I upped the baking soda by a tsp, and used 1/4 cup applesauce and Tbsp of canola oil. I used regular milk instead of buttermilk... they were still aswome!!!

I have made 2 batches of these muffins now and the last was quite a bit better.  I too used 3 tbs of molassis and 3 tbs of honey.  I then added 1/2 cup sugar free sweetner.  They were lighter and had just enough sweetner.  I did put a little nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla in too for a little extra flavor.  We loved them

I like the texture and healthfulness of this muffin, but it is *not* sweet at all.  Next time I would try adding at least some raisins or dried cranberries.

Not very healthy with molasses and buttermilk, so I substituted with 3 tbsp molasses, 3 tbsp wild honey and replaced buttermilk with vanilla soy milk.  They taste just as good without the guilt!

This is an awesome recipe!!!! I did take one other's reviewer's suggestion, and used applesauce instead of butter, vanilla soy milk, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, When I ground up the allbran cereal in the blender, I added the soy milk with it so I didn't burn the motor out on my blender.  I added a little extra cinnamon(about an extra tsp) and a little extra brown sugar (about 1 Tbs). Then to top it off I added a tiny bit of unsweetened cocoa.  Dried cranberies are a nice addition.

This is a good basic bran muffin recipe. I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full, and it made 14...nowhere near the 24 indicated.  I added a half cup of raisins. They had the right amount of sweetness for me.  I don't like an overly sweet bran muffin because I serve them w/ jam or marmalade. I will make these a regular at my breakfast table.  A good, healthy, no-nonsense muffin.

I love these!  I've been searching for good bran muffins for years, after having some quite awhile ago.  I have finally found some I like.  I also replaced 2 tbsp. butter with unsweetened applesauce, and added just a little bit of brown sugar (maybe 1 - 2 tbsp., I didn't have much left so I dumped it all in).  I also added a cup or so of frozen blueberries.  They are very good!  I froze them so I could eat them a little at a time and they are good when thawed too!

pretty good... made my own changes. half recipe makes 12 small muffins. instead of buttermilk I used a milk vinager mix. I replaced molassess with .5 cup brown sugar. Ididn't have any bran on hand so I used 1.75 cups of whole wheat flour and ommitted the white flour. I recommend using 1 extra egg, the mix was sort of dry. orange zest mixes in nicely for a little kick. overall, nice and easy.

These muffins were pretty good, but a little bland. Next time, I will try adding mashed ripe banana, as another reviewer suggested. I will also try a suggestion from someone else(franconia57)to add raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Thanks.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16543/bran-muffins-iii/ ... 5 17 17 ... Pretty good, not bad  'Definitely tastes like a bran muffin, which you'd think would be fine, but if you're trying to sneak in bran, this isn't the one for ya.  They're sweet enough for bran muffins, but you don't taste the molasses.  I used AllBran for the wheat bran & subbed  oil for butter.  'Made 18 regular sized muffins.

This was the first time I've made this particular recipe. If anything, I found them a little dry, but bran muffins have that M.O. Super fast, and quite nutritious. If you don't put the raisins in, you might have an issue with sweetness. I love raisins so I don't have that issue.

Great recipe, nice moist muffins with a hint of molasses taste. They rose nicely and look real good.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and two egg whites for the whole egg, left only 1 1/2 grams of fat per muffin.

Moist but they need baking powder to make them rise and I used black strap molasses which made a big difference.

Yuck.  Tried some of the changes people suggested, and it still didn't help. Why does healthy have to be so nasty?

I'm sorry. I followed the recipe precisely. The flavor was akin to that of wet paper towels. I should have suspected it would be, when I saw the only sweetening was 6 Tbsp of molasses. I had to cover one with 2 Tbsp of honey just to get it down. Disappointing waste of ingredients!

I halved the recipe and used oat bran instead of wheat bran, and all whole white wheat flour instead of part all purpose flour.  I also used honey instead of molasses, accidentally used the full amount of salt, and used a whole egg.  They turned out great!  They are very dense and hearty, more like drop biscuits in a muffin cup.  I really like how they turned out though.  My fiance has even been eating them.  They're good reheated in the microwave, with a little bit of jam or honey or margarine.

This is a great recipe.  I modify it all the time though. I find it a great base then add stuff like walnuts, sunflower seeds, ground flax seed, grated carrots, choc chips, yogurt, raisins, blueberries.  Great way to start the day with a healthy bran muffin and a coffee, then I'm good to go for my power walk.

They were good, not too sweet...i didn't have molasses, had to use corn syrup instead...  and I was out of the baking soda so I threw it baking powder instead - mine were a bit dense, but very tasty!  I will try them again with the proper ingredients.

These were just ok. I pretty much stuck to the recipe but used regular milk instead of buttermilk and I added some blueberries at the end. Even with the blueberries, the muffins were still not sweet. If I made this again, I'd add some sugar. The consistency seemed a bit off as well. I'm not sure how to improve that. But they were edible.

Great recipe.  I did substitute Splenda for most of the sugar, and used all whole wheat flour instead of any white flour.  I also added blueberries to some of the muffins and those were good too.  This is a good healthy muffin for breakfast.

I had to give this recipe 4 stars, not because they aren't great tasting, cause they are but the recipe stated you could use paper cups.....BIG mistake!  The muffins stuck to the paper cups.

Very dense and healthy-tasting - in texture and flavor. I used robust (blackstrap) molasses and a milk/vinegar substitute in place of buttermilk. To add interest and a little sweetness, I added 1/2 c. powdered honey, 1/4 cup half'n'half, and 1/2 cup each of raisins, white raisins, chopped dates, and currants. Addictive muffins! I love that no refined sugar is involved. Thanks for a doable recipe!

Very small muffins (did I mess up?) I only had about 3/4 cup of buttermilk on hand so used nofat plain yogurt for the rest. Also added a cup of raisins - gotta have raisins in my bran muffins. Thanks for the recipe.

after reading of the blandness from other reviewers, i decided to add 2 small ripe  bananas and 1 cup of  raisins, and these muffins turned out really nice. i also added 1/2 a cup of wheat germ for added nutrition. they are just sweet enough too. very nice for breakfast.

I'm picky and pregnant, and I needed something healthy for breakfast.  These muffins hit the spot.  I didn't have raisins on hand, but I wish I did.  These muffins are moist and not too sweet.  I added candied fruit to a few of em' just to see how they would turn out.
