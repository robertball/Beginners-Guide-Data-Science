This was really tasty.  I didn't have cream cheese on hand, but it was still creamy and a good consistency.  It might have been the noodles I used, or my instant pot, but next time I would set it for 2 minutes instead of 1, as the noodles were still a bit chewy.  When I first opened the instant pot, it looked like the ingredients had curdled a bit on the noodles, but when I added in the remaining ingredients that was no longer apparent.

This was excellent.  I imagined a flavor, but I underestimated
how the flavors would interact.  The flavors blended into a rich creamy flavor that was different than the Alfredo I thought it would be.  I did make one change and it was minor.  I substituted Almond Milk for regular milk.  I can not tell you what it did to the flavor, but the outcome was well worth the effort.
