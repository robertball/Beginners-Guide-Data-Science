This was easy to make, and not as sweet as most American candy!  I added a little cinnamon as extra spice.  Great tasting!  I'll be making this again!

Very easy to prepare I added a little more Cardamon than it called for and I topped mine with some crushed Pistachios that I added a very small amount of brown sugar to when I crushed them.  It was a big hit will definately make this again Thank you for the recipie

instead of cardamom, i used half teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and it was so good that it tasted like pumpkin pie.  infact, on a creative day, i might even use this recipe in a pie crust..it was a hit!

I had some leftover chickpea flour from making Nan Khatai and decided to try this...I'm not familiar with this type of Halwa, so it was a new experience!  I substituted butter (not quite sure how much I used) because I didn't have ghee.  I may have needed more...the flour mixture was very lumpy so I added a bit of oil.  Since I don't know what this is supposed to be like, I'm not sure if it turned out...what I do know is that the cardamom flavour was wonderful, and I really enjoyed this sweet treat!

This is great.  I followed the recipe as written and it was easy to make.  Didn't bother to cut it up in diamonds just put the whole thing in a bowl and decorated it with almonds and pistachios roughly chopped up in a coffee grinder.  Got many compliments.

I have made this recipe several times, and it always comes out great! It is easy and if you can't find Glee (or sometimes it's too expensive) I use butter instead, and it comes out just as good. Anyway thank you for sharing.

Followed directions as is - minus the cardamom as I did not have any on hand. It didn't take more than 5 minutes after adding the milk. Came together perfect. Thanks for an amazing recipe! :)

Perfect proportions, tastes just like my grandmothers. Important to cook the ghee-flour mixture until it is fragrant and just browned. I used just slightly less sugar, but I think what the recipe calls for is actually perfect. Delicious!

Wow! I thought for a while there that I was going to end up with soup but I was amazed how quickly it thickened up as I added the milk! It was almost instantaneously! I substituted coconut oil with a little butter for flavor, used only 1/4 tsp of cardamom along with 1/4 tsp tahitian dried vanilla extract (great stuff!) and toasted my almond slices for crunchiness. Pleasantly surprised! Next time I am thinking of either rolling it into toasted coconut or just adding shredded coconut to the mix. Should be lovely!

This was just delectable! It was really so simple and doesn't require many ingredients. I replaced the cardamom with cinnamon, ghee with coconut oil for a healthier twist and reduced the sugar slightly to 3/4 cup. I will most definitely make it again n would like to try the original too. The whole family loved it!

I put more cardamom and a splash if vanilla in it. Topped with pistachio and pumpkin seeds.  Really good!!! It was gone before it fully set!

Very easy to make.  I used more cardamom and sprinkled crushed pistachios on top. I also let mine set in a 9" square pan and cut it into 16 squares.

I have some besan, but didn't know what to do with it.  This recipe was a blessing.  I didn't have ghee or cardamom, but substituted with canola oil and cinnamon/nutmeg. I think it will not set as it should (since I used the oil), but it still turned out delicious.  I crushed some sunflower seeds and peanuts to top. I will definitely make this again.
