It was terrific.  We added a bit more garlic and vinegar but it was a great side dish.

Even my mom who is skeptical about cabbage loved this!  I did change a few things up however.  I omitted the coconut oil, b/c w/ bacon, I feel that it is unnecessary.   Left out garlic.  I cooked the bacon and onion, added cabbage and apples like it said, and then when I added the vinegar and sugar mixture, I tossed it and coated it in the pan and then added to the crock pot on low for 4-5 hours and the cabbage and apples got really nice and tender.  The things I'd do differently next time are add only one apple and use a Granny smith l ( I accidentally used a sweeter variety and it was too sweet for my liking ).
