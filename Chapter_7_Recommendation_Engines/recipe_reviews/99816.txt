As-is, the taste was rather...bland.  Granted, I completely forgot to add salt and had to sprinkle it on top when it was done, but it still needed more of a kick.  I was only feeding 3, so I halved the amount of squash and noodles, but ended up keeping the rest the same.  I liked the result of having a higher ratio of eggs to noodles/squash, but that would be a personal choice.  I think this dish could become very good with some tweaking, though, so next time I will double the amount of onion that I caramelized (I used one medium sweet onion), add salt TO the dish (heh), and add more seasonings.  I'm also going to stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup chicken broth, because it ended up rather dry.

I made whole wheat noodles, used only whole eggs, and added more pecans than called for.  This was eaten right away!  Delicious!

Delicious. My husband's not a big squash fan, and even he loved it. I think it's better without the nuts on top.

The one star was because this is healthy, but the taste was MIA. There definitely seems to be something missing! Though the smell was wonderful, my whole family was disappointed with the end result.
