I made a few changes in this recipe which I think helped it a lot, and will make some more the next time I make it.  I used cider vinegar instead of plain distilled, which made the eggs a nice light "tea" color.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of salt and about 1/4 cup of sugar.  Next time I'm going to increase the sugar to about 1/2 cup, will leave out the bay leaf (there's plenty of that in the pickling spice) and maybe add another clove or two of garlic.  A good first effort for me at pickled eggs, and I'm enjoying them (hubby and daughter won't even get close!) :o)!

Rave reviews from the Tudor feast I did this for, for 60 people.  As I forgot to pick up the Pickling spices at Penseys, I made up my own using the same usual ingredients.  Packed it in a huge mason jar, sealed it and left in the cold garage for a week.  And because I am lazy, I used the minced garlic in a jar (the wet stuff from the produce section)  Worked excellent!

I will definitely use this recipe again!

have been looking for this recipe for awhile.  Had it and lost it.  Try cooking the ingredents with sliced beets and the pickeling spices.  Pour the hot mixture over the eggs and refridgerate.  Can be eaten the next day.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!

I finally made these and was not disappointed! Exactly the flavour I was looking for, thank you! Followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/2 tsp crushed red chili flakes. Enjoy with a cold beer!

I had never made pickled eggs before, so when I found this recipe without beets (my husband HATES them), I said a little prayer that these would be good.  I needn't have worried.  He sneaked an egg out of the first batch before they were ready and informed me that I had better be planning another batch.  He shared a fully-aged jar with a neighbor, and word spread.  I have people wanting to pay me for these because they're so good (but I don't charge).   We think they're better than the ones we can get in the supermarket.   Thank you so much!

The was really easy to make and delicious!  I used canned quail eggs instead if regular eggs (I bought them in Chinatown) they taste the same as hard boiled eggs but are tiny.  I made several jarfuls for my family members and couldn't keep up with the requests for more!  They make great exotic deli gifts.  Thank you for sharing!

A good recipe with a good level of sourness.  Intersting mix of seasonings I wasn't sure I would like at first, turned out very good.  It just doesn't have the store-bought picked egg taste I was looking for.

A+++. My boyfriend LOVES pickled eggs. I have been trying to find a recipe to our liking. I tried several others and they just didn't hit the mark, well, this one passed the test! We added extra garlic to a few jars and some dried red peppers to another. They all turned out great! Thank you so much for sharing!

I made these for my dad on his birthday. We used to get them at a bar that stopped selling them and he really liked them. I added about 3T Tabasco sauce because he likes them hot. The only trouble I had was peeling the eggs, but that's not the recipe's fault. I doubled the recipe. Beware: they have a very strong smell...

This recipe is THE BOMB! I used a very similar recipe before but I didn't use the bay leaf. I made 40 of these and I used the exact recipe only I used 5 bay leaves and multiplied the recipe by 1.5. Boiled the ingredients after the eggs were peeled and had a bay leaf for each jar. I put 8 eggs in each quart jar and let them simmer for 10 days. Now I have people asking me to make them!!! I tell them to boil and peel the eggs and then we swap jars for them. SO GOOOOOOD! Thanks man!

These were really good. Just what i was hopping for. This was my first time making pickled eggs and i will be making them many more times. Only thing different i did was add a sliced onion. Otherwise followed the recipe as is. Thanks!

Took Liane's advice and  used apple cider, 2 tsp salt and 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also dropped the bay leaf and used about 6 cloves of garlic.  I've made the recipe a few times at this point and tried re-using the pickle juice with mixed results so I'd recommend creating new pickle juice every time.  I now use 18 eggs instead of 12 and find it works out fine  which helps stretch the recipe a bit.  

One hint: use eggs that are at least a few days old.  Fresh ones are very very hard to peel and result in all sorts of divots and unappealing gouges.   Older eggs peel much more easily. I know it sounds weird that you wouldn't want fresh eggs but trust me, you don't!

 Warning: the eggs go fast! And we can never wait 8 days.

O.K..I had never tried a pickled egg before the thought of it sounded pretty good because I like pickled veggies. This was very good the key to this recipe is allowing the eggs to sit in the brine mixture so the eggs fully develop the flavor. I made these again today and added jalapeno peppers to the mixture.

I don't change the recipe other than a 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground hot pepper mix from my garden.  I always bring them to deer camp and to the cabin for other guy weekends. 
I steam my eggs for 10-11 minutes then cool under cold water.  Ive gotten eggs from mt friend that are hours old, and they still peel easily.  Steam your eggs folks!
I make these a few times a year and even my 4 year old son, and 2 year old daughter ask for them.  My wife on the other hand threatens divorce when the house smells of the brine.

To anyone who tries this please remember that newer eggs are harder than heck to peel...buy your eggs at least a week in advance then pickle on...

I love this recipe!! We like eggs a little tart and spicy so I added a few peppercorns and a pinch of crushed red peppers and a few sliced onions.  Also, I did not add the sugar.  We just opened the first jar after 9 days!!! Wonderful!!  Can't wait for my kids to try them!!  Josie

I love pickled eggs. Always wanted a recipe. I bought some jalepeno eggs from the Amish and decided to make my own. Didn't change a thing to the recipe except added hot peppers and a dash of red pepper flakes. Wonderful easy recipe.

i made these eggs and followed the directions, but the flavor has not penetrated the eggs, and it has been 9 days. i will probably make another batch and experiment. still not a bad recipe though.

I was wondering do you know the expected shelf life of these? I made a smal batch to try it out and they were good  so I plan on making a really big batch of these and was wondering how long they could be stored.

I made them and nobody liked them. When you eat a pickled eggs you do not expect them to be so sweet. Had to throw them out.

Egg-cellent (sorry, had to do it)starting point for pickled eggs.  Mix it up by varying the components (acid liquid, non-acid liquid, and/or spice additives).

Our latest adventure used olive brine for the water component and crisply fried, lean, thick-cut bacon, sweet onions, olives and peppercorns.   Turned out great.  Bacon was yummy pickled.

Next time I'll cut the water and add more vinegar and leave the bay leaf out (there's already bay leaf in the pickling spices I used).  Good, but not great.

I didn't have the recipe in front of me so I kinda winged it. I didn't exactly sterilize the jars and lids. I put one tablespoon of pickling spice in each jar along work a bay leaf in each and used about a teaspoon of pickling salt in each jar. About a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar was convenient. Three weeks later they turned out to be the best (and strongest flavoured) pickled eggs ever.

These were very good. Almost like the pickled eggs from our local deli, but just seemed like they were missing something.  Can't quite identify what, but something.  I will keep using this recipe though, and maybe see if I can tweak it and find what's missing.

Did not like the pickling spice at all.  Helped the recipe out by adding jalapenos and red chilli flakes.

An easy way to peel the eggs is to soak them in white vinegar overnight, next day the egg shells will be very soft and easy to peel.  Also no more brown spots

I cooked the eggs in the Instant Pot® but otherwise made these as written. The eggs really need to sit in the vinegar mixture , IMHO, for 4 weeks before they're ready to eat.  I will most definitely make these again, thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe according to ingredients listed other than I added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Once the 12 days in the frig were reached I tried one and was not impressed. There was very little flavor other than a slight vinegar taste. Tried one again 3 days later (15 days of pickling) and it was decidedly better....far more tasty. I still think I would add some salt and more red pepper flakes next time and let the eggs pickle for   at least 15 days.

I made a batch a couple of months ago, and really loved them! This time I am adding more garlic and some sugar- just to see how it turns out. Was surprised by how much of a hit these were.  This is a great way to preserve my fresh eggs from my happy chickens.

When you boil eggs add a tbsp of baking soda to water for easy peeling, I also peel under running water no divots then ;) I added onions and jalapenos from my garden , good stuff

These are really good!(I grew up with the pink pickled eggs made with pickled beets, but I like these kind a lot more) I use a few sliced jalapenos, a whole bulb of peeled and chopped garlic, 1/2 white vinegar, 1/4 apple cider vinegar and 1/4 balsamic vinegar. I don't add a bay leaf, or pickling spices- just a lot of garlic and jalapenos and various vinegars, about 15 whole black peppercorns and about a 1/4 c. sugar. The eggs look brownish (due to the balsamic vinegar) and not very appetizing but they taste out of this world!
