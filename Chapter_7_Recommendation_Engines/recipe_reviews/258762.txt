Just made it to taste, didn't even measure anything. Pesto is SUPER easy to make and delicious. Added to spaghetti noodles and some blackened chicken to make an awesome pasta dinner. Everyone had seconds (some had a THIRD plate.)

I used a food processor to blend everything.  Does anyone know how much a bunch of basil equals in measurement? I don't know if I had enough leaves so the pesto had more oil than what I'm used to making.

Great recipe but I added 2 cups total parmesan cheese - I misread the recipe and saw 1/2c +1 1/2 c (not tablespoon!!) but it was fabulous!!! I will definitely make it again...and probably add the 2 c grated cheese too!

Very good pesto.  I have so much basil in my garden I will have to make at least 25 more batches before it's over. I did add a small amount of spinach to add a little more color and it was really tasty. Everyone loved it at work.

Delicious! LOVED the combo of the Parmesan and Romano. I used my food processor for this. One of my favorite ways to use fresh basil from the garden. A keeper, for sure~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
