100% my favorite tofu so far! This was my first go at grilling tofu since going vegan 4 months ago, and it was amazing. I replaced the soy sauce with liquid aminos but everything else stayed the same. Did quick marinade for 45 mins. Pressing your tofu is key! This will become a staple, I already know it.

I am sure the original would be wonderful too, but I modified for what I had available. I used rice vinegar, sesame oil instead of the canola oil and sherry vinegar and I added a tsp of siracha for a little kick. I omitted the extra salt as soy sauce is salty enough.

Even with the low sodium soy sauce, I found this too salty for my taste.  The texture was great, though, and it worked under the broiler instead of on the grill.  I may try it again with less soy sauce, eliminating the added salt, or maybe adding a bit of honey.

I made this recipe and I loved it I only added a few things not because it needed it because I cannot help it wink

Before marinating the tofu I added agave syrup about a tablespoon just to balance it out with a little sweet. you do not need to add salt because the soy sauce works just fine I use Braggs Amino Acid (much lower in sodium) While I was cooking I brushed a little truffle oil on top and then when I slipped it I brushed it on the other side again real thin nothing major for the sauce afterwards I added lime juice because I thought it was a nice little addition to the marinade for dipping or to pour on top are use the stove top iron grill that I got super cheap at the kitchen store works fabulous

I love this recipe. I added 1 tablespoon of dales for an extra kick, and it seemed to work out well.

Perfect Grilled Tofu Haiku: "Halved the recipe, didn't boil and use 'sauce'. Just marinated." I followed half the recipe's ingredients for 1 block of well-drained tofu, marinated it for 4 hrs. and slapped on ye olde George Foreman for lunch. Tasty!
