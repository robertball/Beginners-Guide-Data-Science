I made this several times and love it. I use raw sugar insted of splenda, better than any mango sorbet I've had before.

Made this yesterday for the first time and it rocked.  I did two things differently, one was to use all the mangos I had (about 5) and only 1/2 c sugar (we don't like the after taste of Splenda).  Turned out very well.  Needless to say it is gone.  Will definately be doing this again and probably with other fruits too.  Yum!!

AMAZING!  Such a simple recipe that made my family very happy!  It did take a lot longer than expected to freeze (could have been me!), and because my mangos were so ripe, I halved the sugar (I just used regular white sugar), and it was still very sweet.  Next time, if I use very ripe mangoes again, I may omit the sugar completely.  Taste your mixture before freezing so you know what would be best for you.

One of my favorites! I've made it many times. The only time it wasn't spectacular was when the  mangoes weren't quite ripe enough. I always use a little sugar in place of the Splenda. It's also great with a bit of pineapple and with the juice of a lime added.
