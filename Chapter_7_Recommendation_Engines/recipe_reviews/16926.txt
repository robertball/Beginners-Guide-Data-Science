Excellent recipe as written... and if I may.  To the reviewer who said it was too tomato-y...  Isn't it Tomato the first name of the recipe????  And to all of those alter the recipe and then give less than 5 stars... Please stop.  Write your own recipe, submit it for approval, and then let the public decide.  How you can make a recipe your own, then rate the original recipe is beyond me.  Please stop it.  Rate the recipe as written or give it 5 stars if you alter it.

Some times I consider making a different soup, but then I remember how consistently satisfied I am after eating a bowl (even 4 times a week), so it keeps me coming back to this one. Note: I usually soak the barley in a bowl of water while chopping and sauteeing vegetables to help it cook a bit faster. This is a great recipe to bring for a winter potluck at a chilly house.

A great base recipe that you can adjust to your own preference.I agreed that it needed more seasonning. i omitted the oil and sauteed with a bit of cooking spray, then added grated zucchini, green beans, a can of tomato paste, basil, parsley, bay leaf and a touch of Mrs Dash. It turned into almost a cream based soup but really low in calories. A great healthy soup that seems decadent.

This soup has a wonderful, mellow flavor!  Prior to adding the barley, I pureed half the soup as my family doesn't care for vegetable "chunks".  I also made a quadruple batch of this for a Soup Supper at church.  It was a big hit.  Thanks!
More info 10/08:  Can't tell you how many times I've made this soup and always, always get positive comments from young and old alike from simple and sophisicated palates.  My advice: don't add any extra flavors such as basil.  Resist the temptation! I also thought it would be good, and luckily just modified a small amount of the pot.  The results made for a different soup entirely.  The only thing that I've changed is to omit the water and substitute all chicken broth (low sodium is best)
 I do agree that drastically changing the recipe makes it hard to rate what is written for the original, however, I often find it helpful to read what others have tried, and sometimes substituted in a pinch.  In my opinion, please keep sharing.  That's part of why I come to allrecipes.

Very good flavor. However, it produces a very brothy soup so if you're looking for something a bit more hearty, omit the water altogether and put 2 cups of the cooked soup in the blender, puree it and add it back ...

This was excellent, although I did make some changes. I used 1 full cup of barley and instead of water and chicken broth, I used two 14.5oz cans of vegetable broth, added a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of cannelini beans and some shredded red cabbage! YUM

Very nice soup.  I made it exactly as written although I agree it could have used more barley - perhaps 1/3 cup.  Very nice colour to the soup.  The smell was wonderful while cooking.  I'm at home with two sick children and the whole house smelled of "comfort".  I'll definitely be enjoying this for lunch.

This soup was delicious. I did add some dried basil and salt to it for a bit more flavour and also some tofu (extra protein). I substituted the celery for zucchini which was fine too. It was a great hearty soup for a winters night, and my husband loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This was really good. I did up the barley to 1/2 a cup.  It was a very satisfying soup.  I usually like more complex flavours in a soup, but this was simple in a good way- BUT I may try to jazz it up in the future because I felt it needed a little something.  Tip: When I was chopping the vegetables, I ended up with a lot more celery than the other veg, but I decided to throw them in anyways.  You could definitely taste the flavour imbalance, there was too much celery, so don't do what I did!

This was such a simple soup; I wasn't sure if it would taste bland, so I made sure to follow the recipe. I made it exactly as written, except for the fact that I have no fresh tomatoes, so I simply skipped them. The soup was still very "tomatoey" with just the can of tomatoes. I used the amount of barley it called for, and it didn't seem like enough the first day. By the second day, however, the barley had thickened and enlarged considerably, and the soup was perfect. I was surprised by how flavorful and delicious it was! I love healthy soups, and this is another winner recipe. Thanks so much for sharing...I'll be making this again!

I adjusted the recipe just a little and after adding 2 cups of Play sand, I thought it was just a bit dry.  --- I agree with the gentleman that say you should not rate a recipe your have not tasted.  if you modify it you are actually rating your own mess, but it affects the rating of the recipe submitted. STOP IT!!!

This recipe was good on its own. But I added a dollop of sour cream, parmesan cheese and shredded some cheese on top. I also added a can of kidney beans to the soup and some extra salt. My chicken stock was homemade and I had not added salt to it.

Good soup! I added some chicken for my hubby's benefit. Used veggie broth. The only herb I added was to simmer a bay leaf in the soup. I did throw a handful of frozen chopped spinach in for the last ten minutes. That made it perfect.

Nice. Bright and sort of sweet. I didn't have fresh tomatoes so just stuck with canned. Added cabbage towards the end and a dash of chili powder.

This is a very easy soup. I added extra veggies.
Tastes like minestrone soup without the beans.

I really like this soup. I made the soup exactly as the recipe was written the first time. Then I changed a few things. I sautéed the veggies in 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of canola oil until almost tender. I omitted the fresh tomatoes and used 2 cans of the canned tomatoes. I omitted the water and used a 32 oz box of chicken broth. (Veggie broth when my vegetarian nephew comes to visit). I also increased the barley to 3/4 cup. After adding the barley I reduced the heat to low, covered the pan and let the soup simmer for 45 – 60 minutes. I wasn’t ready to serve right when it was done so I turned the heat off and let it sit, covered, for an hour or so and the barley absorbed more of the broth and the soup was thick like a stew. My family loved it that way. I will be making this a lot.

Excellent - hearty and easy!  I did not follow the recipes exactly but I felt the changes were not significant and I loved this soup. 

I substituted a 14 oz. can of beef broth for the chicken both because that's what I had on hand.  I also did not use canned garbanzos - I cooked them from dry and used that (if you have the time, I definitely recommend).  I used 1/3 cup barley and felt I could have gone up to 1/2 cup easily.  I sauteed my veges in Pam and omitted zucchini because I didn't have it one hand.

As others have written, this is a decent base recipe.  We added additional vegetables & herbs (basil & fresh parsley) along w/ straight chicken stock (no water).  It’s okay but most likely won’t make again.

As others have said, this soup is satisfying and delicious.  I usually do have to thin it out just a bit as it makes a pretty thick "stew" like meal.

This wasn't bad but it could have used some more spices. Per others, I did add some hot sauce to taste and added some shredded cabbage halfway through cooking. Still, I had to add some extra S&P to make it more flavorful. Maybe some chili powder would help? Made for a decent lunch with some grilled cheese sandwiches.

This soup is DELISH! I followed the recipe almost exactly -- didn't have veg oil so used EVOO, used veg broth for chicken since i am vegetarian, and upped the barley to 1/2 cup.  it came out hearty and so yummy, and it was super easy to make.  this soup is definitely going to be a staple in my house for the coming winter. highly recommend it!

IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT A 5 STAR YOU NEED TO ADD SOME CHARACTER TO THE SOUP.  ADD, AS YOU CHOOSE, CHILI POWDER, CUMIN, GARLIC POWDER, BASIL, OR OTHER SPICES OF YOUR LIKING.  YOU CAN ADD AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE OF EACH AS YOU WISH TO SUIT YOUR OWN TASTE.  THESE WILL GIVE YOU DEPTH OF FLAVOR I FOUND LACKING IN THE BEGINNING.  I ALSO ADDED A HALF CUP OF WHITE WINE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL FLAVOR.  GOOD SOUP BUT NEEDING A LITTLE HELP.

YUM!!!  This was wonderful - even my husband, who typically doesn't like homemade soup, gobbled it up.  I did add about a teaspoon of granulated garlic and a few tablespoons of Mexican-style tomato sauce to the soup, and also followed other reviewers' suggestions by pureeing some of it and adding it back in to the pot for the last 5-10 minutes.  I could have eaten the whole pot by myself in one sitting.  Superb!

I love this soup and have always made it according to the recipe with the exception of adding a little basil and more barley. Today, I made a mistake and used a can of diced tomatoes with basil,garlic and oregano. Still great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Nancy.

This was so wonderful.  Follow the recipe and you'll have no problems.  My boyfriend cooked this for me when I was overwhelmed with homework one night but really wanted to have this soup with him.  He doesn't cook often, but he had no problem mastering this recipe.  I was so proud of him!!

This recipe was ok. A little bland for my taste so I added extra salt and a teaspoon or so of basil. I plan to add a little chili powder now as another reviewer suggested. Hopefully that will fix it or I'll probably not make it again.

Great base for "extra room" to play with,
I minced my vegetables and added beef broth, diced pieces of leftover round steak and rice ( didn't have barley)
I did take the advice of others and added some basil and kosher salt. 
What a hit!

yum!  a tasty, healthy soup with plenty leftover for lunches tomorrow.  tomatoes available at the store weren't looking too great, so i used a 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (which i cut up in the can) and a 28oz can of diced.  opted for vegetable broth, cut back on the water and used about 1/2 cup of barley.

This is a great soup already, but I jazzed it up by using canned tomatoes with Italian seasoning in them (not stewed tomatoes, but you could probably use those, too); and by adding 1-1/2 tsps Italian seasoning towards the end of the simmer, a cube of chicken boullion, and a can of chick peas (could go with navy beans, too).  Dee-lish!!

I love this soup!  Last time I added cabbage and leftover turkey.  Vegetable broth instead of water gives a little more flavor - though I like it anyway.  Very easy to make too and keeps well in the fridge.

Really like this recipe. Use my stick immersion blender to puree half of the soup then add it back to the broth/chunky veggies. Even better when you throw in a little sachet of jamon bouillon and some diced ham.

I give this soup a 4 only because without seasonings (sea salt, parsley and a tad of basil) it was kinna bland. We also blended our soup since it was  easier for little kids to eat and we love the smooth texture. Thumbs  up from the kids

Very easy! It tastes really good for such a simple ingredient list. I used all fresh tomatoes and vegetarian broth then added a pinch of salt and more pepper.  It's filling comfort food, but also very light. Next time I will probably put the tomatoes through the blender before I cook them because I like a slightly thicker broth. Will make again & again.

I love it! The barley gives it such a great texture, and all the veges make it so hearty. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I just used an extra can of diced tomatoes.

Amazing soup!  I used 3 cups chicken broth, added some fresh spinach I had on hand, a dash of basil and a bay leaf.  I pureed a quarter of the soup before adding in about 3 cups cooked pearl barley I had left over from the night before.  I appreciate that I could mess with the recipe and it still turned out delicious!

Fantastic!  Nutrient dense,low-fat,high fiber and delicious all in one pot! I followed the recipe except I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth and I added extra barley (about 2/3 cup).

We enjoyed this soup. I followed the recipe pretty much as it is. I used roma tomatoes so I upped the quantity to three, and since they were store bought I added just a little pinch of sugar (xylitol actually) to make up for the lack of natural sweetness.

I absolutely hate tomatoes, but I really like this soup. I followed some raters' suggestions, and added more than the suggested amount of barley (1/3 C total, but I think next time i'll add even more), and i pureed a few cups of the soup and then returned it to the pot (just to thicken the soup a bit). Also added some celery salt, and it tastes great.

Excellent recipe.  Despite the lack of flavoring elements, this soup had a really robust taste just from the vegetables themselves.  I added 1/2 head of small cabbage and liked the textural contrast.  Every meal with this soup was great - even towards the fourth day, there was still enough liquid left with the soup.

I found it to be a little greasy from the sauted veggies. I would recommend not sauteing the veggies in oil. I would have also added more barley.

Absolutely delicious.  I did add a little more barley after reading some reviews and also a zucchini plus some cabbage.  I had some homemade vegetable stock, so I used that instead of the water.  We live in Norther Ontario and this is a wonderful, tasty soup is great in this really cold weather. Thanks so much Nancy for this recipe.

The soup was really great ! I did puree half of the soup and poured it back into pot, for a little creamier texture. The only thing I did different was add a potato. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this soup was great.  I would just like to recommend that when simmering leave it covered.  I had to add more broth due to evaporation.

Great healthy satisfying soup!  I used 1/2 c barley, added 1 tsp basil, used all chicken broth, 1 small can tomato sauce, and 2 cans diced tomatoes (didn't have fresh), and it was delicious!  I also cooked it 45 minutes with the lid off of the pot, and it thickened up nicely to a stew-like consistency.  I will definitely be making this again :-)

I'm a "guy cook" who just took up cooking for the fun of it. I love this recipe exactly as written because it is so healthy ... especially when you use vegetable broth. Without really changing the recipe as written, I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis as part of the canned diced tomatoes. It added just the right amount of ZIP!

Excellent soup!  Add a can of chick peas to get a complete protein.  No need to use vegetable broth.  Substitute water and the flavors will blend together very nicely.  This also happens to be the kind of recipe that helps you use up whatever soup-friendly veggies happen to be languishing in the fridge.

I only gave 3 stars because I found it very bland after following the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I did different was to add course salt and pepper to the vegetables as they were sauteing. After tasting the soup and realizing it needed something more I added basil, oregano, thyme and margoram. I also pureed half of the soup to thicken it up a bit. With those changes it tasted better, but I think next time I might add a can of V8 juice to add even more flavor and omit the water.

This receipe was tasty. Made it with a few Changes. I used 1 Large can of Diced tomatoes that was seasoned with Onion, Garlic and Basil.Then I sauteed the onions and celery and minced garlic in olive oil. I cooked the sliced carrots in Microwave til about done;then added the diced flavored tomatoes and chicken broth. I omitted the water. My husband loved it. I doubled the receipe next day and made more. Delicious! This is a keeper. Barb-B

Excellent!!!  Except for stock, we never make soup.  We followed the receipe exactly but we added some cooked polish sausage. We sliced it into about 2 inch pieces and put it in as we turned the soup down to a simmer.
My wife and I ate it with sourdough bread and loved it.  The receipe was enough for anbother meal.  It is in the freezer for another day.
Thanks, loved it.

First of all, message to photog....  RIGHT ON!  I give this a 5 star even tho I did change a few things (chagrin chagrin) because I wasn't paying attention.  I did NOT change any of the ingredients, I just boo booed with the quantities. You just can't miss with the flavour base of onions, celery and carrots.  I had accidently frozen 3 fresh tomatoes (don't ask)and needed to use them. I didn't look at the can and it was 28 oz not 14. So I did not add water at all, but used home made chicken broth, at least 48 oz and maybe more. Plus, because I don't highly salt my broth I did add a bit more salt (canned chicken broth can be pretty salty).  I also ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup barley (did I mention I love barley in soup?)
Thank you Nancy, it's perfectly wonderful!

I thought the recipe as written was bland, but a good base to add to. I sauted garlic and sausage meat and added that to the soup along with some grated cheese. I may try it again and use beef pieces to make a beef barley soup.Four stars for a good "base" soup!

This turned out to be a great soup, after making some changes/additions. I was short on time so I cooked the barley separately (quick cooking) and added it right before serving.  I used between 1/2 and 3/4 cup uncooked.  I didn't use any water, just 2 cans of chicken broth.  I added about 1 tsp. basil (the frozen from Trader Joes is better than dried), 4 or 5 shakes of chili powder and salt and pepper to taste.  In addition, I used 1/2 small can of tomato paste.  I wanted a thick, not broth based soup, so I pureed about 3/4 of the soup, just leaving some tomato and onion chunks.  Before serving, a added about 1/2 bag of frozen, chopped spinach.

I doubled the batch and tossed it in a slow cooker with cabbage.  I did not toss in the water, but did do the broth and it ended up as a stew rather than a soup.  It was very hearty and quite delicious.  Thanks

Yum yum yum. I added white beans and chili powder based on a suggestion here. Very tasty, and the carrots (slice them long) add substance and unexpected crunch and flavor to tomato soup. There are plenty of leftovers (even after serving 3) and I'll definitely make this again.

This was wonderful. I made the recipe exactly as written except to replace most of the water with low sodium chicken broth and it was fantastic.  It does not need any extra spices and I feel that adding any would change this soup completely. This soup will become a regular recipe in my home. Thank you for a great, simple recipe.

This recipe is good but for the summer we like a soup that is cold.  I usually use canned diced tomatoes with seasoning in it.  The rest of the ingrediensts come from cans, carrots sliced, cannoli beans, kidney beans, sliced potatoes, and anything else you want to put in it. I also add V8 to make it souppy and this will add more flavor.   This really hits the spot when you are hungry but want something that is cold rather than hot.  Allso I make bean salads this way too.

I have been making this soup for YEARS, and love it every time.  If you're doing it for other than diet purposes, & want it thicker, just cook biscuits or fluffy dumplings on it before you serve!  The little starch makes the broth a little thicker, and nothing says comfort food like dumplings or biscuits served on a soup as great as this!!!  HTH!!

A nice thick and hearty soup.  We like the consistency of this soup and the delicious flavor the barley added.  I made this as written, but would have liked it even better if there was a little spice to it.  Maybe by adding zesty canned diced tomatoes or a few red pepper flakes.  All in all this was very good served with a thick slice of homemade bread.

I cannot even count the times that I have made this soup! My husband and I, in West Central Florida, look so forward to winter and soup weather in particular because of this recipe. It has gotten to the point that I don't even need to reference the recipe any longer because I have made it so many times. That being said, I do have to say that I add more barley than called for because husband is a confirmed "stewp" guy, so a little thicker towards the stew end of the spectrum is how he likes it! 

A really easy switch-up, along the line of Nancy's cabbage suggestion, is to add chopped kale when the soup is ready to serve. Just grab a bag of the prepped stuff in the produce aisle and add as much as you like. Give it a quick stir, and if you like your greens with some "tooth" left to them you are ready to go. Otherwise, you can let them soften up as much as you like which takes practically no time at all.  

For just a little chopping, it is soooo darn good and warms you right through. SUPERB as a "planned over" too -- nothing quite like soup the second day. On many occasions I have gotten out the BIG soup pot and made a double batch just to have a stash in the freezer. Such a great timesaver when needing something good and satisfying after a day that has left you with no desire to cook. Grab from the freeze and pop it in the microwave while you change outta the day and decompress for a little bit. 

I know what is on the menu tonight!

Loved this!!  I doubled the recipe; used homemade chicken broth and homemade stewed tomatoes; also added some thin sliced cabbage as the submitter suggested.  It was even better the next day.  Took some for lunch and froze some for a quick week night meal later.  I will add extra barley next time as some reviewers noted.  Thank you for posting a wonderful soup, Nancy Olsen.  This one is a keeper for sure !!

I used homemade chicken broth rather than the canned and water, and added mixed vegetables and cut up leftover chicken.  Also used about 1.5 cups of leftover rice and lentil blend (Trader Joe's) rather than the barley.  It made a warm, hearty supper for a cool fall evening.

Not saying it is best practices but pulled this off with some frozen veggies, a little Penzy's Forward, and it was still fantastic. A good staple recipie to modify and make your own. Thanks for sharing this!

We absolutely loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was use Better than Bullion instead of the chicken broth.  We really enjoyed the heartiness of this recipe--my husband (who likes his meat) thought it was such a good veggie dish that he insists I make it again!! The barley gave a nice, hearty chew to it which made him not miss meat at all.  And even without adding any spices it still tasted fantastic.

this is great and all love it.  I double the veggies and add a yellow pepper and a box rather than can of broth and if too thick add water that I boiled chicken in.  Also use one cup of barley instead.  I boil 2 chicken breast to add to it

This soup was really awesome however I did add some sea salt.  Going to try adding chicken and perhaps a different spin using beef broth and beef stew meat and see how it turns out!  Quick and easy preparation!

This was DELICIOUS made exactly according to recipe and was perfect! It will be a nice dish just to have in the frig when a little hunger pang hits. You can eat something healthy. I plan to make this again and again.

I’ve made this recipe twice now. I like to make it in the crockpot (30 minutes = 2 hours on high, or 4 hours on low). The first time I added some leftover veggies such as bean sprouts, water chestnuts, and chili peppers. It was okay. The next time I basically followed the instructions (shredded carrots, vegetable broth instead of chicken, a little salt, and minus the onions because I don’t like them). It was even better. So I recommend keeping it simple. It’s different than any other soup I’ve had before. I wouldn’t call it vegetable soup, wouldn’t call it carrot soup, but I wouldn’t call it tomato soup either. I would rather eat this than any canned soup I’ve tried recently. And I usually have these ingredients in the house, so I don’t even have to shop. I’m looking forward to making it again.

Really good soup! I added more barley as others suggested (maybe a bit much as it absorbed a lot of liquid) and it was a tasty and hearty soup.

Excellent soup; very easy to make. I didn't add the two diced tomatoes, as I didn't have them on hand, and I'm sure we never missed them. Makes a really good and thick bowl of soup; you won't even need crackers!

Just right! I added a little extra barley and a little more broth (veg broth). I also used the can of diced tomatoes that contained green chiles. Yum!

This was an awesome recipe. Going off the recipe and adding the cabage lended itself perfectly to a new variation. I was short on time so I used condensed tomato soup instead of making it. We also added some crispy crumbled bacon, basil, and whipping cream to add a little more to the soup. It was awesome!

This soup was very hearty and filling but it was nothing special.  It seemed like it was the "Zero Point" Weight Watchers soup with barley added.

Yummy soup! I used all broth instead of water, and I used one cup of barley. I also zapped the carrots in the microwave for a couple of minutes before adding them, to shorten the cooking time.

This soup was wonderful and the entire house smelled delicious.  I ommitted the chicken stock, didn't saute the veggies - personal preference - and I upped the spices & barley for more flavor.   In addition to the ingredients, I also added cabbage and about 20 minutes before it was fully cooked I added zucchini and squash.  Great for a chilly day!

A bit bland, but definitely a nice fresh-tasting soup.  Mixed in some sofrito and that gave it some more flavor.  I'd also use more barley next time.

Great Soup! I added a can of black beans and zucchini. I also added tiny tofu squares (i cut them teeny-tiny and added it with the rest of the vegetables). It was really good and they were so cute floating in the soup. I will add them to other soups that I make that don't need to be pureed.

This soup was really easy to make.  I liked the taste, but I enjoy very simple flavors.  My husband and brother in-law both added hot sauce to the soup because they found the flavor a little dull.  I think the soup needs some more spices... right now all of the flavor comes from the tomatoes and the pepper.  Also I found the soup needed some salt.

A nutritious soup, but needs a little help: maybe some sauteed ham as a first ingredient and a can of kidney beans or garbanzo beans. A dollop of pesto on top. Or serve with crusty baguette smeared with goat cheese. Something. Otherwise, just another healthy soup, forgettable.

The flavor of the broth in this recipe is amazing! My only complaint is that for a tomato barley soup, it did not have much  barley. I doubled the barley called for in the recipe, and I still feel like it was a little light. I also added some browned hamburger to make it a heartier meal soup. Honestly though, I think the meat took away from the flavor of the soup. Next time I think I will just serve it as a side soup, and forego the meat. Oh, also added some fresh basil in the last 5 min of cooking because basil and tomatoes go so well together.

After a few minor alterations I would definitely give this a "5" as it is a quick soup to make that is not too heavy, yet hearty.  Basically, since I did not have two fresh tomatoes, I used a second can of diced tomatoes.  After the soup simmered a bit, I added salt to taste and some dried basil to taste (probably 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp) to give it a little more flavor and "zip".  Sprinkling some grated Parmesan cheese on the individual servings also gave it some extra flavor.  Will make this again.

I really liked the final outcome of this soup, but I will admit, I did make a lot of changes based on some others' suggestions. I added 2/3 c. Pace mild salsa with the tomatoes. I used three 14 oz. cans of beef broth in place of the water and chicken broth. I also added a bit of cumin and about 1/2 tsp. chili powder. Next time I think I will also add some beef. This was very healthy, very tasty, very easy and froze wonderfully.

I must admit while I was cooking this I was pretty certain I was throwing it out.  I couldn't stand the smell.  Well, with that said I tasted anyway after everyone's rave reviews.  It's wonderful.  My husband ate it with grilled cheese & said it was a nice change of pace.  You can add any protein you want to leave it as is.  IT'S ALL GOOD

This soup was excellent.  I added 1/3 cup more of the barley and some dried basil, more pepper and some kosher salt.  Topped it off with freshly grated romano cheese.  We couldn't stop eating it.  It was so delicious and healthy.  Thank you!

This makes a very nice soup but it was bland. I like that it's healty and it's worth making again, but next time will add more seasoning.

This soup was average.  I thought it needed some more ingredients.  I took the soup & ran it thru a blender to puree it & then I added cheese tortellini.

Being a bit of a soup novice this one was fantastic!  It was easy to make, and used ingredients I had already.  I will definately be making it again, though I think next time I'll be throwing in some chicken for a bit of protein.

My husband and I really liked this soup. However, I used two large cans of diced tomatoes, and instead of fresh tomatoes, I used two cans of stewed tomatoes one of which was Italian flavored, a pinch of red pepper flakes and 1 Tbsp chicken boullion instead of broth. I didn't add extra water as I didn't cook the barley in the soup.  In fact I put some of soup in a blender to thicken and I got the consistancy I wanted. I then divided the amount to be used as two seperate dishes. One I added boiled potatoes to since I didn't have any rice or barley on hand, and the second I actually added the barley to on another day. Great low cal soup, and it was easy to make!

This is really good. I did add a bay leaf, upped the chicken broth to 2 cups, and a tsp. of Kosher salt. Other than than I kept the recipe as is. It is very healthy and filling. It will be repeated again and again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

A nice soup. I used the slow-cooker, and pureed part of it to thicken it. It's easy to add any herbs and seasonings one desires. I'll be making this often.

Really enjoyed this soup! I added in 1 chicken breast, diced, as well as a handful of corn, red pepper flakes, and cayenne. Otherwise followed the written recipe. Turned out great! Will definitely make again.

My husband and I enjoy this soup.  I've made it pretty much as stated in the recipe, except I use home canned tomatoes from our garden and I use 1/2 cup barley.  I made it earlier this week and added fresh corn cut off the cob and that made a nice addition, giving it a little crunch.My husband likes things a bit spicy, so he adds some sriracha sauce to his portion.  A satisfying soup.

Every single time it's so good! I usually make it with about twice as much barley and some extra broth instead of water for more flavor and texture. I pre-cooked the barley by accident one time, but if you do that, just put the cooked barley in when all of the veggies are just about done. There was one time I didn't have two tomatoes so I added about 2 tablespoons of ketchup... still awesome!

EASY FRESH   Definitely a tomato soup and very good.
Light somehow but had substance with the barley. I liked.
Husband not a barley fan but still enjoyed. I used all chicken stock. That was only change.

This was great, but again it's one of those recipes that I'm changing to my taste, which is why I am giving it 4 stars, not 5. It just seemed like it was going to be somewhat bland. So I added an extra garlic clove, and Italian seasonings. I also added way more broth, a couple of glugs of red wine, a can of tomato sauce in addition to the can of diced tomatoes. I also added many more veggies- Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Green Beans, Cabbage. I did as another reviewer and used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup, but left it mostly chunky. I topped it with Pesto from Trader Joe's and fresh grated Parm Cheese. Everyone liked this one, and seeing my kids happily shovel a variety of different veggies in their mouths makes me happy, so it was a win win for everyone. Making this again for sure.

This is a great soup!  I made it just as the recipe stated other than adding a bay leaf and a small grated zucchini ( never knew it was there), but I did have to add more broth because I made it a day ahead and it thickened in the refrigerator.  Next time I'll chop the carrots smaller (or maybe grate them) and I'll definitely add some cabbage per another cook's suggestion, and a little more barley (say 1/3 cup).  I did use an immersion blender for  a few whirls, but left plenty of nice chunks.  Surprisingly filling and hearty for a vegetable soup.   This will be a regular here, and I'll feel free to change/add whatever is on hand now that I've followed the recipe the first time.

We loved this, so very satisfying on a bitterly cold night with some warm corn bread.  Made as written other than using homemade broth for both the broth and the water quantities, added a bay leaf and doubled the barley.

Pretty good.  I followed exactly as written.   I found it in desperate need of salt, which was to be expected.  It had a nice, fresh light taste, but was a little too light for us.   If I make again I will sub in salted butter for the vegetable oil to start with.   That should help a bit to boost the flavor.   I would probably also add in some parsley.   Maybe replace half the broth with water and bouillon for another layer of depth.

Added meatballs to the soup.  I found the tomatoes a bit acidic despite adding the other ingredients.  The meatballs took down the acidity a bit. One of my girls liked it and the other not so much.

I made this exactly as written except for adding a chopped small zucchini.  Also, I had 2 cups of home made chicken broth in the freezer that I used, then added one cup less water. Before adding the barley, I used my immersion blender to thicken, but left some chunks.  I was skeptical about the lack of seasonings, but he flavor is outstanding...hearty but healthy. I will make this again.

Loved this recipe just as it is.(Winter I add 1/4 more barley).  It is a harty delicious nutricious soup--great on a cold winter day or nice as a delicious light lunch in the summer with a big slice of home made bread.

I like rich beef recipes, so I altered it to include beef in beef broth, but photog is right.  If the recipe is enough on it's own to make my mouth water and can't wait to try it...we all have our own fine tuning...I give this a 5

I hate to give this recipe such a low rating because it is a good BASE.  However, it had NO FLAVOR!  I think if you added some spicy ground sausage and maybe used flavored diced tomatoes, it could be much better but as is, it was bland city.

Absolutely yummy!!!  Doubled the water, carrots, added 3/4 cup uncooked barley.  Left out the fresh tomatoes, just added the can of diced tomatoes.  A little dried basil, a few bay leaves.  Didn't have the can of chicken broth, threw in 2 chicken boullion cubes.  Also added chunks of leftover sirloin tip roast.  Will add an extra cup of water or will get a can of broth for next time.  Enough left over for my husband and I for another meal.

This is an excellent recipe.  And very easy.  The only addition I make is some chop suey meat that I add, already cooked, about 10 minutes before the soup is done.  My 9 year old daughter constantly requests this soup.  I make this almost weekly during the winter months.  Thanks for a tasty and healthy recipe.

Good and healthy.  Put it together for a Girls Night Out (everyhone was on special diets, and this looked pretty safe).  Went together quickly and everyone liked it.  Used about 5 cloves of garlic (I had help and wasn't watching).  I think most people liked the extra garlic.  Otherwise, made it to the instructions (very rare for me).

This recipe lacked flavor.  I was disappointed because of all the rave reviews.  I wanted a smooth texture so I put the tomatoes, celery, and onion through a food processor but I don't feel that would have made a difference.  I also realize the soup would be better if it were made in the summer.  I added V-8 juice and some basil to spice it up.  It also needed salt. It was much better that way. However, when I served it for dinner both my husband and I had to throw it away.  Bummer!

It tastes good but needs a little somthing. Mine didn't turn out looking like the picture...the broth was thick and rich looking in the picture and mine came out close to clear.  I will doctor with some tomato sauce to give it a richer taste.  I will also add a little lime juice and cilantro to give it a kick.

Delicious and versatile.  Didn't have fresh tomatoes or celery on hand, so used a can of condensed tomato soup, and added fresh spinach and thawed frozen french green beans cut into 1-inch pieces.  Followed other suggestions and beefed up the spices (I used fresh parsley & dried basil). Topped with grated parmesan.  Tastes like a tomato-y minestrone.

Well this soup was good and very healthy. Unfortunately, I'm not experienced with cooking barley, and after eating it I realized that I should've cooked it longer than the 40 minutes, as my barley seeds didn't open up, as I think the picture of the soup shows. I added just a little bit more seasoning, but I felt that the soup could've had a little more taste. Oh well, I would try it again, especially for when one needs an immune boost. This seems very healthy - which was nice for a change!

Good, but nothing exceptional as is. It reminds me of a base recipe for minestrone or vegetable soup. Will make again, but how I usually do. You should use the Italian tomatoes in the soup for more taste.

Pretty good soup but I added some chopped left over roast beef,made it even better.If you try this don't forget to add salt,if I hadn't added any,this soup would've been really bland.I'll make this again.

I cooked and diced a couple of chicken breasts. This addition plus salt made it a great hit while watching the football playoff games.

I thought it needed a little more seasoning to make it interesting. I also added some ground beef to make it a full meal soup.

OK,this is from an Englishman who REALLY loves soup and I have to say this is one of the best.Just a few changes, I added a handfull of pasta twists used garlic salt instead of a clove and just a splash of olive oil seved it with a sprikle of parmesan and wholemeal bread .

I got so many compliments on this recipe. It's perfect for a cold winter day meal. The only things I did differently was to add more barley,a can of corn, a pound of ground sausage and some cumin & garlic powder. You'll be lucky to have leftovers!

This was very tasty. I added twice the barley.
