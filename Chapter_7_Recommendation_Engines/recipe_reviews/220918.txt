I did not have dill pickle relish but I did have garlic dills, I used four full garlic dill pickles in this recipe. I also added a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I made no other changes. For us, this was a little too mayonnaise-y though the combination of ingredients is fantastic. I will make this again but I will cut back the mayonnaise. I loved that this recipe called for light mayonnaise.

This is the best ham salad I have ever eaten. I say that because I don't particularly care for ham salad yet this was good. I used hamburger dills only because I didn't have any dill pickle relish. I really liked the mayo/Dijon dressing.

This is great for Easter leftovers! My modifications: Used more egg than ham, chopped up a dill pickle instead of using relish, used horseradish mustard, omitted the onion, added tarragon and celery seed. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  It's a great way of using  extra Easter ham and the extra hardboiled eggs.  Serve it between 2 pieces of toasted bread and add a layer of lettuce and you've got yourself a treat. Thanks for sharing.

No need to buy slices of ham.  I had the Deli shave 1 lb. of ham.  Then I chopped it up.  Not a fan of djon so I used yellow mustard. Mixed all ingredients except mayo. Green onions were my choice using both white & green, Then I added mayo slowly until I reached a nice mix to my liking.This goes really well on a good rye bread.  I'm thinking of trying horseradish next time instead of mustard.

I made mine with sweet relish and red onion. A definite twist on ham salad with the addition of the eggs. I spread it out on a roll with garden tomato and american cheese.
