I really dislike quinoa, so I confess I didn't make this recipe as written. However, I did really like the combination of vegetables and spices. I would make it again.

My husband, who is not a fan of quinoa, liked this very much. 
I would probably add more apple and herbs next time, it's a definite keeper.

Definitely has potential! It took way more prep time for me, also more salt, pepper, and Gara Masala. The apples disappeared and I didn't taste them much, so maybe I will try more and larger chunks next time? Lots of little variations and tweeks I want to try. I also had to simmer at the end for about 10 minutes longer than recommended.

Titis recipe did take more timed or me  to prep and cook. The flavor was very good and it was a complete  warm meal on a cold winter night.

I just cut my chicken into pieces from the get go.  I found that when the 20 minutes was up, there was still far too much liquid left so I cooked quite a bit off.  The apple had totally disappeared in the dish; I think it disintegrated during the 20 minutes.   I really had to adjust the seasonings.  It needed more salt, pepper, garam masala.  I think this was a nice way to use up both the leftover squash I had in the fridge and the apple sausage links that I had in the freezer.
