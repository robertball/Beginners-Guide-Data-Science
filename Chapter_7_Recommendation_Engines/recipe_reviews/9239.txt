Very delicious. I tried to make this before & it was a disaster.  Thank you for proper instructions.!! My only comment is to tell folks to heat the fat in the pan at 400 degrees for 15 min. before adding batter. Some may think it's sizzling after 5 min. & results won't be as good if fat not hot enough. Do Not open oven door while it is cooking.  And also - I had to use a blender to get it light & frothy.  Wisking by hand just didn't do it for me.  End results - great.

I just tried this recipe and it was fantastic.. I altered slightly, using 1/2 the H2o recommended, subbing 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c oil for the fat (I like to save the drippings for gravy) and using whole milk.  It puffed out nicely with a crisp crust that is a pleasure to serve to company.  The most important step to good Yorkies is to heat the fat first!!

My husband and I have been trying forever to find a good Yorkshire Pudding recipe.  We have tried dozens of them and none of them would rise.  So we tried different things like letting the batter rest for periods of time, including overnight.  They would taste good, but there was not enough rising.  We tried this recipe and the results were AMAZING!  We have never been so excited about this!  We had such success.. they turned out HUGE!  I'm not sure what the trick was here, but we beat the batter for a long time to make sure it was really smooth, and even without letting it rest they turned out beautifully.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe Mort Tibble, you have made us VERY happy!

I have been making Yorkies for the last 20 years on a weekly basis and have some tips for those people who say that their puds don't rise. First of all, I use yorkshire pudding pans I bought in England. If you don't have these use muffin pans. Second, I use 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or vegetable shortening per slot. It has a higher smoking point than butter and olive oil. Thirdly, put your pan in the oven for at least 15 minutes before filling with batter. I take mine out of the oven and put the pan over a direct heat from the oven top and I also put the batter in a jug and pour them in while the pan is over direct heat. They will sizzle and set and THAT is the key. Put them back in the oven and set the timer for 25 mins. They will rise beautifully. I usually make the batter about an hour before I put them in the oven and have never had a problem. Do NOT use any leavening agent such as baking powder/soda. They just don't taste right. I also cut the salt to a half teaspoon and add a good grinding of freshly milled black pepper. I hope this helps those who are having trouble getting their puds to rise.

I didn't use a casserole dish, instead I used a muffin tin and tripled the recipe and it was great! The puddings were crispy on the outside and stayed "puffed" even after I took them out of the oven. I didn't use the beef drippings though. I prefer the flavor of melted butter instead. All 12 of my Christmas dinner quests raved! I'll make these again and again.
UPDATE: I made these again tonight only I used a mini-muffin tin. I liked the texture and size even better than the regular muffin size. Next time I will try adding Parmesan cheese to the batter to see how it tastes. So many possibilities. Another Update: Don't add Parmesan cheese .... it's too heavy for the batter and they wont rise.

This was fantastic.  I was looking for a recipe that compared to my mother's (she was from Coventry)----and this was as good as it gets.  Thank you so much for a pudding that is light and puffy.  I had always thought you had to chill the batter before putting it in the hot drippings, but I've been proved wrong. I did them in indivdual pans the way my mother used to do them ( I used 6 small loaf pans), and baked them for 25 minutes.  Each pan took about 2 Tbls. fat and a tad less than 1/2 cup batter.
Thank you for a great recipe.
I've copied many recipes, but this is my first review---because I absolutely needed to
let everyone know how great this is. Good job.

Excellent recipe.  I can finally make yorkshire pudding.  I didn't have much fat from the roast so I used appx. 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c olive oil instead.  Turned out great.  Thanks.  Its a keeper.

I come from Yorkshire and this recipe is exactly like my family have been cooking for generations, although we use Yorkshire pudding tins and cook each one individually, we have them every Sunday. They are esp nice with a sweet salad

I make a traditional prime rib each Christmas and this is the best Yorkshire Pudding recipe I have found.  Letting it sit overnight is more important that people think.  I have tried a lot and this is my favorite (and now only) recipe.  Thanks for the submission.

I made these as part of a British meal to celebrate Harry Potter's birthday today with my daughters.  I've never had Yorkshire Pudding before, but you can sure bet I'll be making it again very soon!  This stuff was phenomenal!!  I didn't have time to let the batter sit for an hour, so it only sat for about 20 minutes.  I baked individual puddings in a muffin tin, using butter instead of beef drippings, as recommended by some reviewers.  I served it with roast beef, gravy, Mushy Peas I (from this site), and butterbeer.  We are already planning our next Harry Potter feast, to include this Yorkshire Pudding!

When I was young my grandmother of English heritage always made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding for Christmas dinner.  When she passed away, so did the tradition.  So this Christmas I made it for my daughter and her boyfriend, using this recipe for my Yorkshire. I doubled the recipe and baked it in the roasting pan from the roast and it was absolutely perfect!  We all loved it and I had such fond memories that I made the yorkies for myself two more times in the next week!  I hand whisked it all 3 times and it was fine.  I also didn't make it ahead or use room temp ingredients and it was still fine.  Today I put all the ingredients in the bowl and mixed them together at the same time.  And it came out just as wonderful as the other two times!  I did, however, heat the drippings (butter last two times) till it was very hot and sizzling.  Perfect Yorkshire just like Bama used to make!  I just wish I could give it more than five stars!  That person who wrote that it was the worst recipe they'd ever encountered...all I can say is "you MUST have done something wrong" because this recipe is perfect!

I've been making this recipe for the past 25 years.  Putting the ingredients in a blender is best and letting it sit for at least 30 minutes before adding to the pan.  The pan, whatever type pan you are using needs to be preheated in the 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, that fat needs to be hot, hot!!  I use giant size muffin tins and sometimes popover pans.  Makes better individual size servings.

This was very good, but I cut back on the amount of liquid and only used milk. This was the first time I made this recipe in a dish rather than a muffin pan. I found that I prefer the individual muffins as they come out so much prettier. A good basic recipe that went nicely with our prime rib. Thank you!

Perfect side to my holiday prime rib roast.  My wife said the neice and nephew wouldn't like the dinner.  Boy! Was she mistaken!  When it came time for them to leave, the boy said 'be sure to let us take some of that stuff!' meaning the Yorkshire Pudding.  (Now I have to say this nephew is 21 and his sister is 17, so I wouldn't call them 'kids.'

This is almost identical to the recipe my mother-in-law gave me over 30 years ago. I would never cook a roast without making Yorkshire. We use the beef drippings to make gravy to pour on the Yorkshire and mashed potatoes.  So we coat a muffin tin very well with oil and place in oven while it pre-heats, then pour in the batter. To make 12 our recipe uses 1-1/2 c. milk, 1 c. flour, 2 eggs and 1/2 tsp. salt. Easy to double or triple.

Pretty good.  It stuck in a few places.  Be sure to swirl hot fat around pan and then pour batter into center of pan.  A nice additon to the usual potatoes.

I have been on the hunt for a good Yorkshire pudding recipe for a few years now  .... I have tried a few and they are always quite heavy... This one was lovely and light.   The puddings rose beautifully while cooking.   I think it is because it has milk and water in the recipe.  I put a healthy teaspoon of canola oil on my muffin tins and   I cooked them for 20 minutes and 450.   Super!

This is the traditional English version of Yorkshire Pudding that my English grandmother used to make.  She never made her Yorkshire pudding in little cups.  We always ate this with roast beef and gravy with English roasted potatoes.

Served this at a dinner party tonight.....Came out really puffy and nice - Should have served it immediately as it deflated after about 7 minutes.  Flavor was very good - could have used a hint more salt...

Following this recipe to the letter, I whipped up a batch on Christmas day.  Like last year – the first time I tried it – I used drippings from a very nice prime rib roast.  Also like last year, this recipe turned out as promised and scrumptious!  Reasonably quick, very easy, with a minimum of ingredients and maximum culinary enjoyment, this Yorkshire pudding recipe makes a wonderful addition to your holiday meal.  It is also a nice change of pace from rolls or other breads.  This one has earned a place in our traditional Christmas meal.

I used drippings from a pork roast & some bacon grease & cut recipe in half which called for 1 & a half eggs. I used 2 & I used half and half(out of milk) FYI - Preated drippings at 400 for 15 min and they began to burn. Other than that and being a bit too salty from the pork drippings, it could have been great!  Next time I will use beef drippings and heat them for less time.  TY for the recipe!!

We make these at least twice a month, and always enjoy them. They taste delicious though I have never been able to get them to rise properly. Since we serve it with roast chicken we use olive oil rather than beef drippings. Additionally, my daughter has Celiac so we use gluten-free APF, with no apparent difference in taste.

Love this recipe!! My Fiance had never eaten Yorkshire pudding before and he loves these so much it is now a staple food in our house.. and so easy to whip up! Being (mostly) vegetarian we use oil instead of the beef drippings (about a tbsp or tbsp per muffin cup).. YUM!!

I use butcher bought beef fat to supplement roast drippings or when I cook beef that has little fat drippings. Plus it lets me time the pudding better with the rest of the meal. I prefer using a cupcake pan for better surface area and crisping.

I found that adding 3/4 tsp baking powder seems to give it more of a lift.  My mum was British and this is what she always did.  Also, make up the batter before you put the roast in the oven, then refrigerate it. The colder it is when it hits the drippings, the more it seems to raise!

Took the advise from others, heated up the drippings and some margerine for 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven, then poured the batter over the top.  It puffed up, and turned out very good!  Love it!

I can't give it five stars because I have never eaten Yorkshire pudding before, so I don't have anything to copare it to. That being said, when  my son and daughter went to England this became their favorite food, and THEY said it was great.

Simple and tasty. I've used this with sausages or as a side dish. If I don't have beef drippings, then I use butter or oil.

I made it for the first time a few weeks ago and they turned out fantastic!! Heating the oil in the muffin tins really is key - in the past, members of my family had trouble with Yorkshire Puddings deflating by the time they came out of the oven - and they never did heat the oil up. Mine stayed nice and fluffy! These tasted just like I remembered. Thank you for this recipe!

LOVE THIS!!! My Grandmother is from England and made these often. I lost a recipe and found this one! Amazing just like Grandma's! I did however change the flour..Grandma always said use white unbleached flour and decreased the water to make it more of a pancake consistancy. Wonderful! Thanks!

This was pretty delicious.  It did take double the time to cook in my oven, though. I had never had this dish before and it was a great fluffy delicious side served with prime rib. I will definitely make this again.

GREAT!  I've tried Yorkshire Pudding many times, this was the best.  I did make 2 minor changes: 1. The Prime Rib I cooked didn't have quite enough liquid so I added a little Olive Oil before heating drippings to a 'sizzle'. 2. I have had trouble getting it to rise enough in the past, so added 1tsp of double-acting Baking Powder.   Everyone raved and said this is a 'save' and 'do again'!

This recipe works just fine as it is. Many serve the pudding with the meat and the gravy, which is fine, however Yorkshire Pudding is traditionally and best served as a side dish or before the beef. Gravy, sodden pudding defeats the whole purpose of baking high. I dislike individual Yorkshires', reminds me of a catered function, nothing worse.

This recipe turned out perfect.  I think having the eggs and milk at room temperature made the difference, for it rose perfectly.  Rather than sink or not rise, when I have made this side dish before.

Great recipe.  My roast doesn't give many fat drippings so I used avocado oil instead which can take a high temperature (500 F) .  I made the batter in a blender so that it would whip very frothy, and i used a muffin tin as well.  The yorkshire pudding was great...crispy on the bottom, and light and fluffy even though I let it sit for only about 20 min.

Sooo good.  Great advice from other reviewers. Heated the fat for 15 min in hot oven.  I also had to use the beaters on the batter.  I didn't let the batter rest. ( time limit) and they turned out gorgeous! Crispy on the outside and soft inside.  I made too many so I froze and bagged the few leftover.  Reheated in the oven when I made my next roast for a few minutes.  Just as good as the 1st time.  Will make over and over, every Sunday from now on.

This recipe was good but I mixed everything in a bowl and used 1 1/2 cups of milk that I heat up for more flavor.The eggs should go into the bowl first and just beat them to break them up.The milk goes in next but make sure you pour in just a little milk at first so you temper the eggs.The last thing you would mix in is the flour. No salt is need because of the salt in the drippings.If you use muffin pans you might want to put the drippings in the mixer if not put the drippings in the baking pan

UNBELIEVABLE! These were PERFECT! I read at least 40 of the reviews and felt like I was armed with the perfect information in order for these to come out FABULOUS! And they did! Here are the few minor changes I made:
* I heated up really HOT the butter/Olive Oil/drippings mixture I had poured into the bottom of the (6) muffin tins in the oven before I poured the batter in.
* I used my blender to mix the batter and let it sit at room temp for several hours.
* I put in 2 T. of additional flour so the batter was a little thicker.
A-W-E-S-O-M-E results! THANK YOU for this recipe. :)

Favorite Yorkshire Pudding recipe!!  Tastes just like the ones I had in Wales... and husband thinks it's better than his mothers!  Substitute butter for drippings.

All thumbs up.  I made mine with butter instead of meat drippings to satisfy vegetarians in our midst.  Very easy.  Very good.  I did heat butter to bubbling and I also used one and a half cups of flour.  Great for Christmas and other holidays.

I am soorry to say that I have to agree with the few negative reviews that I read prior to making this dish:)) That was the worst Yorkshire pudding I have ever had. Maybe it was just too easy to make... The consistency was nice and moist, but too salty and rubbery. I will try one of the other ones as I love a good Yorkshire pudding!!!

Super easy to make.  Don't worry if things don't seem to mix smoothly at first.  Let it sit for a while.  Then mix again.  The lumps will work themselves out.

This was awesome.  It came out better than I expected.  I made it for Christmas with Prime Rib. Due to time, I did not let it sit.  Once it became frothy, I just poured the batter into the hot dipping.  What I did different was, I added olive oil to the drippings, I used a muffin pan and I filled them to the top.  They looked like huge art roles. Also, I let them cook for the full 30 min WITHOUT opening the oven door. They did not droop for a few hours

This is similiar to the recipe I have been using for about 30 years.  The difference is I use my blender for mixing and pouring and use my fresh Thyme and Rosemary (minced for this) that I use on the outside of my Prime Rib along with garlic, kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper.  Try putting some herbs in you may like it! God Bless you.

Wow.  I've been trying to make YPs for many years, unsuccessfully....in the past they either stick to the pan, NEVER hold their height.....and are just poopy.  These were awesome.  Tall, and hold their height.  Amazing.  I've made them successfully with both white flour and whole wheat.    Nummy nummy.

I'm giving this only 3 stars because I ended up with hockey pucks.  The hockey pucks were tasty though.  Anyone know why mine did not rise?  I don't live in a high altitude area.  I used to use the package mix and it always turned out high and fluffy.  I followed the recipe and only changed the serving size to 4 and made them in muffin tins.

Just to comment on one review that said flour ,salt and milk made a thick batter. Yes it does ( I mixed by hand) then I got out my trusty hand mixer and beat in the eggs then water until light and frothy. Voila , the perfect batter. A shame that she gave up so easily and missed out on a delicious treat.

I made this for the first time Christmas 2015.  The recipe was wonderful.  A word of advice - if you are using a muffin tin, 1/2 cup of drippings divided between the wells may be too much.  My grease bubbled over and smoked us out.  It was so bad I had to clean my oven before I could use it again.  Next time I will try 1-1.5 tsp. of grease and put foil under the muffin tin.

This was marvelous! Made it for Christmas dinner and it went over big time! My husband is from Yorkshire (lost his mothers recipe, therefore haven't made it for years. I baked it in individual tins (bought in England) and they puffed up beautifully! Tasted like Mum's and looked even prettier! Thanks for the great recipe, Mort!

This was amazing! However, I couldn't use horse radish due to an allergy, and a lot less olive oil. They're very rich, but my family loves them and I'll be making them again soon.

The recipe as presented was not clear;i.e. what size should the muffin pans be? And 1/4 tsp each? My husband and I wanted super delicious pudding;this, to us was NOT easy. May try another recipe. We did eat them..our first try..and added the 4 T butter[Smart Balance for us] plus the beef soup base as one reviewer described. Still couln't taste any beef flavor. I still am soooooo hungry for Yorkshire Pudding.....guess I will have to purchase an expensive roast or cut of beef to get it right.

Judging the photgraph,this pudding was heavy. It has not risen  less flour needed, bread flour is ideal for yorkshire puddings.

Served beef stew over the pudding and it was amazing!  I used beef broth instead of water.  Also, I added 1 t garlic powder, 1 t thyme, and 1 t sage to the pudding mixture.  I was very flavorful and everyone raved about the meal!  A true keeper!

Didn't have enough dripping for both gravy and yorkshires so I used melted butter and olive oil and it turned out great. Hubby raved at how well they warmed up the next day. Will make these every time from now on!

I've made this a couple of times, and each time was just GREAT! This is by far the best recipe for Yorkshire Pudding I've found, and it is definitely a keeper! The first time I made, I had no juice left from the roast I made, so used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. Marvelous! The second time, I used the the au jus from my brisket...YUM! Thank you SO much for the great recipe!

My pudding cups did not turn out that nice. If I thought that I did everything right than I would have given it 3 stars but I'm bumping it to 4 stars in hope that I'll succeed with another attempt. I followed the recipe to a T except I put it in muffin tins instead of a 9X13 pan. Also, the drippings that I used were the gravy that was made from a pot roast cooked in a crock pot made with condensed soup and dry onion soup. Not sure if that made a difference. Finally, I'm not sure if my oven was hot enough. I had it on full blast but often find that it tends to be a cooler oven. I will try this again and see if it works because my british/south african friends all rave about this staple side in their home.

It turned out well. I didn't have to bake it a full 30 min., mine was more like 25 min.

I’ve failed at multiple recipes and figured I would give this one a shot!  I am pleased I did as I think this batch came out amazing crisp on the outside, riser perfectly, and soft and hollow on the inside!  Very happy with this recipe and have saved it to the family’s recipe book for future dinners too come!

This didn’t work.  The batter was actually the consistency of dough, and I couldn’t salvage it.

I didn't have enough drippings from my roast, so I substituted 1 tsp of butter per muffin slot in my muffin tin with great results! The recipe made over a dozen small puddings, and there was not a single one left after supper!

turned out just the way I expected.  It was great that I could do most of the prep work the night before as the oven was already a busy place and timing was everything with Prime Rib.

This was good but I believe it needed more seasoning. Without additional gravy from the crown roast it was quite bland, however, adding the gravy made this incredible. I will definitely make this again, but I will add more salt and include pepper next time.

Ran into some smoke issues while cooking, using beef fat/drippings rather than oil. I think this would have happened even had I used oil, but regardless, these guys were delicious.  They puffed beautifully, and were quickly devoured when served with a smearing of whipped cream cheese, chopped chives, and thinly sliced prime rib. My 62, 21, 18 yr old, and neighbor, ate them all in one setting. 
Will definitely try again, probably seeing if straight oil reduces the smoke (likely will). 
Also noted that these browned more because of the use of beef drippings. I really don't care because they were so tasty.

The amount of oil used ran over into the oven and I had to put out a fire that started up. After I cleaned that up the second batch stuck to the pan. I’m going to try again with a new nonstick pan, less oil and a lower temperature on my oven to see if this helps. As for Christmas, I should have made my homemade dinner rolls.

I did all the steps written and used the reviewers suggestion to use vegetable oil instead of beef drippings.  The puddings puffed and were very tasty. The procedure caused a major mess in the oven with overflow oil. Tasty and puffy and messy without using a cookie sheet under the muffin pan.

I made this in the muffin tins and it didn't rise.  Batter was room temp, roast drippings were sizzling and we ended up with little flat pancake shaped "muffins".  I have made this before, just not this recipe.  Taste was okay but very disappointed in presentation.

I made it exactly as it states in the recipe. It was my first time and it came out very well. The only reason I didn;t give it 5 stars is because to be perfect it could of raised a little more, but still it looked and tasted great!

This is our Christmas Dinner. I make them every year in the larger muffin tins- 1tbs veg oil per tin, pre- heat for 10-15 minutes, then 1/2 cup batter- makes 9 individual puddings which I stuff with a cranberry-ham concoction. Kids love watching them cook, and I love serving something fun and different!

My mother is English; I grew up on Sunday roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  Despite that, I never knew how to make it.  This recipe is spot-on taste wise.  Pro tip: make sure the pan is at least 9x12 or make sure you don't pour the batter too thick otherwise the middle will remain doughy when the outside is done.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe in a muffin tin. It turned out beautifully! Additionally, everyone was able to have the best part- the edge! I made this with prime rib, so I also tossed a couple of bleu cheese crumbles in them as soon as I pulled them out of the oven. So delicious and absolutely beautiful! My dinner guests were very impressed!

I love Yorkshire pudding with my prime med rare roast beef.  You should heat the container for it before greasing and make sire everything is room temp. Mix well, I like it look frothy on top.  Pour in the warm muffin tins , have the oven 450*  then turn down to 35o* watch them rise, and try to serve immediately.

I don’t mix it the way it says to in the recipe. I get my ingredients to room temperature and then just throw them all in and stir them till it’s mostly not lumpy. The quantities and ingredients are absolutely perfect though. I tried cooking it all together in a 9x13 pan and the result is included as a picture lol. I normally use a mini loaf pan to cook them in.

An easy recipe. All these years and I had never bothered to try making them, even though they were close to a “staple” whenever my mom cooked a beef roast. This recipe is simple. I did take one other reviewer’s advice and heat up the drippings in the muffin tin beforehand, so that it would stay as warm as possible. Once done and on the table, they disappeared quickly. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I was amazed how well these turned out! They rose beautifully.  I used 1/2 cup of water and used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of oil. Very pleased!

I made this recipe multiple times and every time it comes out delicious. I don't use the muffin tins like my mother did. I use a large roasting pan to make my yorkie. My family loves it! I change the serving size to make in my roasting pan.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the recipe to the "T", it was good, but not great. The second time it came out perfect!  The second time, I was in a hurry and forgot to bring the ingredients up to room temperature. I also only had about 30 mins to let it sit while the oven and pan was heating.  I used 1/4 c each of melted butter and veggie oil since I also didn't have the beef drippings in time.  I heated the muffin pan for 15 mins, added the butter/oil and returned for another 5. Poured the batter into the tins (makes 12) and baked for 30 mins. These came out amazing!  I now have a recipe to rival my sisters,  who won't tell me her secret. Now I have a secret recipe all my own. Thanks!

This is by far the best recipe I have used for Yorkshire Pudding and it turned it perfectly both taste and appearance.

Love Yorkshire pudding and i always make it when I make prime rib. I do use muffin pan instead of the baking dish, but everything else is the same. Always a wonderful addition to my holiday dinner.

Never made this or ate it before, but saw the recipe and had planned to make a roast beef anyway, so I gave it a try.  It was phenomenal!  Both my hubby and I ate more than half the pan.   I followed directions for the ingredients, except added 3/4 tsp of baking powder as one reviewer suggested, made sure batter was very cold (refrigerated for an hour) and that the drippings from roast was sizzling in the cast iron skillet before pouring in the cold batter.  This is a definite keeper!

These turned out perfectly despite not waiting till the milk and eggs were room temperature. And I only let the batter sit for half an hour.  I used coconut oil to grease the pan and they came out easily, I made them in a muffin pan and it made 8. This recipe is a keeper.

I followed the recipe completely, except for (1) using 1/4 butter and 1/4 oil instead of drippings, as suggested by one reviewer; and (2) leaving it out to prove for around 4-5 hours. It was very easy to mix and make, and rose up beautifully. In my oven, it took 25 minutes in a 9 inch square pan.
My only problem was that it smelled terribly eggy the next day, even after warming it up.

First time I've ever made yorkies and we really enjoyed them. The only problem I had was on me. I did not have enough drippings from meat so I used half canola oil and half butter. I didn't care for the canola oil. Next time I will have to try something else. Ty for a nice easy recipe.

Did not rise. The edges were yummy and crispy with pan drippings. The center was doughy.

It tasted good.  I had to use butter as my fat. I used about 1/4 cup in each muffin tin.  It raised but then fell.

After reading many recipes and reviews, decided on this one and I couldn't have been HAPPIER!!!  I made the batter the day before and beat it with hand held beaters for about 5 mins. Then pulled out of the frig about 2 hrs before cooking to let it get to room temp. Also made sure to heat my beef fat for ~20 mins in the oven, then poured in the batter. I had sides that were 2-3 inches above my pan!  I received A+++'s from my guests!  Follow this recipe exactly with room temp batter and HOT beef fat!

Hadn't made these in many  years and your recipe was  perfect. I used muffin tins and made about a dozen. My boyfriend had never eaten Yorkshire Pudding and the whole family polished them off in short order. So yummy with our standing rib roast and twice baked potatoes on Christmas eve ..... Ty

great recipe, they raised up beautifully (I was concerned as we are at 3400 ft elevation).  I used an electric mixer as trying to whisk 3/4 cup milk into 1 1/2 c flour proved to be too hard.  I used olive oil in muffin cups as I want the drippings from my roast for gravy.  My British Grandmother always mad them in muffin pans.  Very pleased with this recipe and highly recommend it.

Works out every time! Using a mixer helps get it  frothy. I've found there seems to be not enough fat in the drippings so I'll rub my cups with oil and leave a little in them as well.

First time making these and I thought I was seriously going to mess them up. I started halving the recipe without realizing that meant I had to half an egg. Then I didn't let them rise for an hour - I was lucky if the batter was sitting for 30 mins before it went in the oven but they turned out really good! This time I used oil in the muffin tin cause I'm not giving up pan drippings when there's gravy to be made. Next time I might try mixing from beef stock with the oil to get the flour in the puddings too.

It doesn't make sense. Whisk 1-1/2 cups of flour with 3/4 cup of milk? All you get is a lump at the bottom of your whisk.

So easy to make and really delicious! Served them with a roast and poured some homemade gravy over them. The secret is definitely heating up the oil long enough in the oven before pouring the batter in and baking. I used a muffin tin and put 1/4 tsp vegetable oil in each cup and put it in a preheated oven of 400 degrees for 15 min. Then remove and quickly pour the batter about 3/4 the way up of each muffin hole and quickly put in oven. You have to be quick so the oil does not cool down.

I made this for Easter dinner with a lamb roast.  I had a friend over who hasn't had Yorkshire Pudding since her Nana passed away over 30 years ago.  It was an absolute hit!

Made this according to recipe as written, turned out fantastically! I've also has success using canola oil, rather than beef drippings, and they turned out equally delicious (just heat up the canola oil a bit longer before cooking, like 15 minutes).  I don't have a traditional Yorkshire pudding pan, but found using a Whoopie pie pan worked well - they look exactly like the puds I had in England.

This was the 1st time I have made Yorkshire. I tried a large muffin tin which worked well. I used them as a side for roast beef with au jus and they were a great replacement for the heavy rolls I normally put out with the meal. I didn't let the batter set at all and the puddings still rose well.

Better than Better Homes and Gardens cookbook version! And as a devote, that is high praise from me. The recipe is essentially the same, but every year at Christmas  (until I found this), my pudding separated when I mixed everything together and though the final product tasted good, it was always misshapen. Room tempts the key, friends!

We had some filet mignon steaks to grill up the other night and I wanted something different as a side dish besides the usual potatoes. I know this dish is typically eaten with roasts but I thought I would give it a try anyway. We were not disappointed. It was perfection. I made it exactly as written other than the cooking time and the beef drippings. I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 oil as did a previous reviewer. Also, I pulled it out of the oven at 25 minutes instead of 30 otherwise it would have been overcooked. We were delighted with the results and will be making this again the next time we have a roast.

you def don't need to refrigerate overnight.  I let sit on my counter for 15-20 minutes while the fat drippings are sizzling in the oven and it turns out just like mom's.  nom nom nom.

Excellent!  The timing was perfect, since I let the standing rib roast rest for about 40 minutes, just the time needed to cook the pudding.  Only change I would make is to heat the dish for awhile before adding the oil to it.  That should make the cooking time even slightly shorter.

Great yorkshire pudding recipe.  I'm from England but can never remember the ratios unlike my Dad so it is handy to have a recipe.  I made the batter the night before and used it to make toad in the hole.  Turned out a treat!

This was a great recipe.  We all enjoyed it.  I made a batch for myself with barly flour instead of wheat and although they did not puff (bacause of the type of flour not the recipe) they were still tasty.  The wheat flour ones puffed up great.
An earlier reviewer wondered why her crock pot drippingd did not work.  The recipe is calling for fat it put in the pan.  Try the recipe again but use fat.  Substitute butter and oil like others have if you are serving these with a crock pot roast.
