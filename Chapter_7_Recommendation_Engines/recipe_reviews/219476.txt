To make things easier, I mixed the brine ingredients together before adding to the bag instead of trying to dissolve the salt after it was already in the bag with the turkey. I could not find Mandarin oranges and used cuties instead. That was the only change I made. The turkey turned out super juicy and smelled awesome while roasting. This is a 5 star recipe all the way!

My husband was going to attempt his first turkey smoking and thought a brine would probably be a good idea. This was also a first for us.  Noticed that majority of brines had sugar. I am diabetic so him finding this was great.  We did the brine and with his Kamado Joe and some hickory we had one of the tastiest turkeys weâ€™ve had in some time. Kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe.
