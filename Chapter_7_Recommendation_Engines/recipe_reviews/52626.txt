Don't leave anything out of this salad.  I thought the walnuts and avocado would make it weird, but they are perfect in the salad.  The only thing I changed was using green olives because I ran out of kalamanta.  Let it sit for at least an hour before serving for better flavors.  It was perfect eaten with some homemade foccacia bread.

I had this salad at my sister's last night.  I made her put it back in the fridge so I didn't eat the entire salad, it was so good! The avocado adds a rich taste and texture that is normally missing in a salad with an oil and vinegar dressing. I think it would also be great with chopped, cooked chicken breast for a light supper salad.

This was a delicious recipe!  I have made it several times so far since salads are great summer food.  Once or twice I used dried basil instead of fresh because my plant was not big enough and it was still delicious.  I have also added some roasted red peppers in there and that was a great addition as well.  We will continue to make this!

My husband didn't prefer these flavors blended together, but I thought it made for a unique salad. I might throw a few of the ingredients together again when dining alone, but will eliminate, or decrease, the green onions next time, simply due to those having somewhat of an overpowering flavor compared to such delicious other ingredients. Made for a quick side item, and meal, when paired with baked chicken breast sandwiches.

I was trying to decide between two kinds of Greek-sounding salads and ended up combining them.  Used this recipe and just added about 2 1/2 cups cooked orzo.  Gave the salad more volume and blended nicely with other salad ingredients.  Think I would do it this way again.  The fresh basil tasted wonderful with this dish.

This was delicious! I've made it twice now and it's turned out perfectly both times! The only changes that I have made is that I used an oil and vinegar dressing just because I was trying to use it up and have one less bottle of dressing in the fridge. 

This salad is really good, especially if you let it sit a bit before you eat it. The dinner party I took it to devoured it, and there was 4 of us though the recipe is for 6! Compliments all around! Tastes great and easy to transport and take to parties and potlucks and things!

This was delicious but very rich. I omitted the walnuts because of personal preference (I did taste the salad with a few, but I didn't think they added much flavor--just a nice crunch), and I used black olives because I didn't have kalamata. I used 4 oz of feta instead of 6 oz, because that's the size of the container I had, but I think next time I'll use about half that amount. The basil added such a wonderful flavor, and the creamy avocado gave the dish a great texture. It didn't make the greatest leftovers, though--best eaten on the first night.

We really enjoyed this as a refreshing side dish.  I used just plain feta instead of the basil/sundried tomato feta, and skipped the walnuts because my husband doesn't like nuts in food.  It was really good, and I will make this again.

I took this to a 4th of July party and it was a huge hit!  People were eating it as a salad and (since I cut up all the stuff fairly small) dipping tortilla chips in it.  I didn't use the red pepper and only used 4 oz of feta (that was the only size package I found).  It didn't make up a ton the way I made it.  I could have EASILY made a double batch and it would have all disappeared.  I really feel the fresh basil is a must, dried really wouldn't give it the same vibrant flavor.  I was sort of skeptical when I first read the recipe  because it seems like a strange combination of ingredients but it is really, really good.

This is a great easy salad. My husband and I love non leafy salads and this is great.  I used regular low fat feta and green stuffed olives, but it still turned out great.  It will become a regular.

WOW! excellent salad, bursting with flavour. And it looks beautiful as well. I used the best balsamic  I could find and that makes a huge difference. The only sub I used was cucumbers instead of avocados which was perfect and roasted peppers out of a jar because life is too short. ( I actually think they taste better than freshly roasted.) Have made it twice and will make it again for dinner parties etc.

Holy Cow!!!! This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really, really good. This winter when I want a little bit of summer I will be making this.  The flavors were very well matched and I think next time I may roast some pine nuts and try them instead.  Great recipe!!

Awesome recipe.  So tasty - the different flavors and textures went together so well.  It was really easy to put together as well.  I could not find fresh basil - so I used dry and turned out great anyway.  Everything else was included as is.  I also let it sit in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors mix.

This is delicious. I added some fresh llime juice to keep the avocados from turning brown, but otherwise this is a perfect recipe. You just have to like all the ingredients!

This was pretty good.  I mistook it for a main-coarse salad and it wasn't until I had almost finished prepping it that I realized it really needed some lettuce to help stretch it and help calm down to sharpness of the feta.

Great salad with a myriad of options.  The olives provide a slight saltiness that blends well and would be complemented with a bread.  I left out the avacado and still had many compliments.
