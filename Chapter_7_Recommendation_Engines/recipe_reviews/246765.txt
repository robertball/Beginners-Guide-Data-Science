Delicious cake though too sweet using 2 cups sugar.  I used just over 1 cup and it was great.  Made individual trifles with whipped cream, pudding, and strawberries.  Perfect.

Will definitely be making this again for all sorts of fruit desserts! Light and fluffy and so easy to make! I baked mine in a cookie sheet to have thinner pieces! Was a huge hit!!

6.4.16   This was the perfect choice for strawberry shortcake.  In an effort to get calories down, I used skim milk and Truvia® Baking Blend in place of sugar, and it still turned out awesome!  If you want your butter to melt quickly in the microwaved milk, I’d recommend cutting it into small pieces or grating it.  For a nicer presentation, I cut into rounds using a biscuit cutter.  The texture is light, almost fluffy, it had just the right amount of sweetness, and it soaked up the juice beautifully.  As soon as peaches come into season (very soon), this will be made again.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, used an 8x6x2 baking dish, and  ended up with six round cakes that split horizontally were just about perfect for layering berries in the center.  I’ve always made the biscuit-type shortcake, but this just might become my go-to recipe for shortcake.  LOONEYPROFESSOR thanks sharing Mom's recipe, it's a winner!

I made this last night for strawberry shortcake and it turned out awesome, even with one error on my part and a substituted ingredient...thus 5 stars for a forgiving recipe.

First, I replaced the vanilla extract with a tablespoon of honey (no vanilla onhand).

Second, I forgot to warm the milk and poured it in cold. Oops.

Well, the end result was a perfect sponge cake with strawberries AND eaten plain later. In fact, it was perfect by itself. 

Thank you for the recipe and I plan to play with more vanilla substitutes (like fresh lemon).

I followed the direction to a T...I like the flavor, cake itself did rise inside the oven...took it out and flipped on a cooling rack and came out flat and dense.  Will recycle to cakepops.

Loved it! Since I'm allergic to milk, soy, and eggs. I replaced the milk with almond milk, and eggs with flax seeds+water mixed together and it turned out great.

I made this today. After reading the reviews, I used 1/2 cup less sugar. i followed the directions otherwise, baking it about 30 minutes, which probably could have been cut down a minute or two. It rose beautifully and came out golden brown. Taste wise, it was light, fluffy, and plenty sweet with sugared berries and whipped cream. Next time I make it, I may add more vanilla because I just love vanilla. There will be a next time because I can see having this with any kind of berry or fruit, or with chocolate or caramel sauce, or anything you want to top it with. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the best sponge  cake I have tasted. I have tried several recipes this year. People mean different things when they say sponge cake. This is like a store bought angel food cake but MUCH better. Very light, spongy and flavorful. I did bake it quite a bit longer. I baked it until the edges started pulling away from the sides of the pan. Since oven temps vary, I always go by the edges of the cake. I really  appreciate the detailed instructions as far as how long to  beat or microwave ingredients because I think that's made all the difference. King Arthur Flour has great instructional web pages on baking matters like properly creaming butter and so on. It's taught me allot of simple  baking techniques that have made a big difference. I'm going to use this recipe for trifle and strawberry shortcake. It's really good plain with coffee.

This was super simple and turned out great.  I used a scan 1+1/2 cups sugar and I did whisk together the flour and other dry ingredients.  It rose beautifully.  Thanks for a really good recipe.

if your eggs aren't whipping add the baking powder to them, it acts like cream of tartar would in a meringue.

I followed the directions pretty closely, but I added a teaspoon of almond extract (I was just in the mood). This cake came out WONDERFULLY moist and delicious. I made it to go with strawberries and cream. I only got to eat a couple of pieces though, because my husband scarfed it down over three days. He didn’t even add the toppings because he loved it plain.

I loved this recipe! All the ingredients already on hand. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband loved it. I would probably try a bit of lemon in the batter as well next time. I needed something quickly for fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Superb!

This was so perfect! It was light in texture but rich in flavor. I made it for a small dinner, so be forwarned, if you don't adjust the servings, you get a LOT of cake. It was a tad sweet for me so I may reduce the sugar next time by 1/4 cup. Otherwise, this was  amazing.

After the first bite my husband exclaimed, "This is the best shortcake I have EVER had!" I think it was a hit! I love how light and moist this shortcake is. It is rather sweet so I might reduce that a little but, wow, soooo good!

I made this recipe just as instructed but there seems to be a problem with the cooking time.  I have a convection oven, which usually cooks a little faster, but this time the cake was not done.  I cooked it the 30 minutes as instructed and then cooked it an additional 10 minutes.  I put the toothpick in and it came out clean, but somewhat wet?  First time I've made it I thought - ok!  It was not ok.  After sitting for 15 minutes the cake fell and I could tell it still was not done in the center.  So disappointed!  Also, the photo provided shows circle cakes?  These instructions said a 9x13" pan - which I did?

Excellent sponge cake for strawberry shortcake! We reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup, and it was sweet enough. I may even reduce it to just one cup next time! With sweet berries and sweet cream you don't need a super sweet sponge cake! Delicious thanks for the great  recipe!

I followed the recipe and method.  Cake came out so soft and bouncy.  I would definitely make again. I posted a pic of an empty plate with crumbs... me and my family devoured the whole lot and that was the best pic I could take!!!
