Fabulous pork dish! It was super easy and took little prep time. I made some modifications. First, I too didn't use fresh herbs as suggested by other folks. Instead of rosemary and sage specifically, I used dried oregano and Italian seasoning. I also added 1/2 lemon juice into the paste - it made the paste slightly watery but I think it added to the flavor and kept the pork loin moist. I also quartered about 6-7 red potatoes, salt-and-peppered them and drizzled with olive oil, and placed the potatoes around the pork loin to roast along. About 30 mins into roasting, I topped the pork and potatoes with slices of red onion and let the onion cook to a crisp.  The whole ensemble was amazing! Try it - it is really easy. I served the roast pork with a tomato mozzarella salad with homemade vinegrette. We had plenty for leftovers too, so the next day we had it with a side of chicken and mushroom rice. Delicious!

Different cuts of meat are so hard to judge in any recipe, I did use a pork loin roast but not one of those thin rolled pork tenderloin roasts. They do cook fast but my roast wasn’t anywhere near done and still red in the thickest part after the exact timing on this recipe. It was called a “premium pork loin roast” I think. I had fresh garlic, but did use dried spices and had to use vegatable oil because I was out of olive oil but after I got it cooked through, (and believe me I am not shy to eat pork that’s a little pink, but rare isn’t good) it was delicious. It was super easy. I made the paste and let it sit to marinate in the fridge for the afternoon. Just some philosophy; Seems to me that people don’t eat pork roast a whole lot. But they aren’t that relatively expensive per serving. They have some kind of reputation for being fussy and time consuming (and they’re not) and are a great treat to wow company like you slaved all day in the kitchen over a fancy, pricey piece of meat. In the end mine came out juicy, tender, and spiced just right to give it a real gourmet flavor infused in the meat. I had used another recipe in the past that I marinated overnight, but this one tops it and I will make this again. I think there’s something to that hot oven for a few minutes in the beginning and then turning it down to a lower temperature to finish cooking that really brings out the flavors in the paste rub.

This was a wonderful recipe and I didn't even use fresh spices. The flavor was amazing and even better the second day when my husband and I ate some in our hot "garlic-herb pork roast" sandwiches.

yum! I covered with foil and the result was tender and juicy with just enough seasoning! I did have to increase the cooking time quite a bit because I don't like any pink in my pork!

I did not mess with this recipe, except that I did not have sage on hand!  What makes this so exceptional, is the fact that it is so moist and tender.  Also I often rate for freezing.  I sliced partions, and froze them.  Pleased with the results!

This was amazing!  It was the most tender and juciy pork roast I ever made.  I used some extra garlic - which was great, but the house still smells like garlic.  I used a pork loin roast, not a tenderloin so it does take more time to cook.  I used a thermometer that I can keep in the roast and read it from the outside.  I cooked it to 160 and it rose to 165 while resting, and it still turned out juciy and slightly pinkish.  I also added a tsp of lemon juice to the paste as someone else had suggested and I used dried herbs from my garden.  Yummy!

This was a quick and tasteful dish. I used boneless chops instead of the loin and it was perfect. I served it with root veggies (parsnips, turnips, carrots). I'll definitely save this to use in the future when we have dinner guests.

Great flavor! Easy to prepare. Picked the herbs right out of my garden. My husband loved it although we found it a bit salty. Will definitely make again, but with a reduction of the salt. Thanks for the recipe!

The rub was very good.  I used a 4.5 lb loin and it was ready within 1.5 hours.  The second time I used a 2 lb (enough for 3-4 people) and it was delicious again.  It was ready in an hour on 350 the whole time.

This is quick and delicious. I used the herb mix on a loin and on a shoulder roast- both turned out great.  My house smelled like a restaurant while this was cooking. I added a little more oil to make it easier to run onto the meat. I substituted thyme for the rosemary and the flavor was perfect.  XOXO Joce

I made this with a pork tenderloin and it was delicious.  I actually marinated the pork in this mixture (used dried herbs) for about 4 hours.  This baking method produced the juiciest pork ever!  I had to cook it at 300 degrees for about 35 minutes to get it up to 150.

More like 3.5 stars.  Nice paste, but this takes FOREVER to cook.  I cut it up and pan seared it at the end.  Also, the taste of the paste doesn't make it's way inward very well.  I could see this as a great seasoning for pork chops though.  I used dried herbs (1/3 dried to 1 fresh) with good results.

This recipe is super easy and pork comes out soft and moist. I didn't have fresh herbs, so I added Italian seasoning, and a splash of lemon juice like someone suggested. My 2Lb tenderloin also fell apart upon opening in 2 long pieces. Because of that it took only 15 minutes at 300 degrees and the temperature reached about 155. I served it with double baked mashed potatoes and fresh salad. Everybody loved it. Definitely will make again!

I cooked a 5 lb roast and it took about 3 hours. I put a little bit of water in the bottom of the dutch oven and roasted it at 450 for 30 minutes. I reduced the heat to continue cooking. About 1 1/2 hours in, I added quartered yukon gold potatoes and onion wedges; topped with lid and baked to 150. Ended up with a wonderful au jus.  I didn't have the right herbs, so I used Stubb's ginger and rosemary rub. Next time I'd like to try it with the sage and rosemary. Hubby loved the meat and potatoes!

I took a chance by making this recipe with all dry herbs but was very pleasently surprised by how amazing it turned out.  It also makes such a beautiful presentation with roasted carrots, onions and fingerling potatos. Thanks!

Good, moist roast but it took way longer than the 20 min at 300 as stated.  Maybe that was per lb?  Let it go til temp was right and was all good.  Will make again, giving it more time or a higher temp.

I had some fresh sage I wanted to use up, which was why I decided to try this recipe.  I mixed all the ingredients of the rub minus the salt, used it on the pork loin and then marinated it overnight.  I sprinkled some salt and then broiled the pork for 10 minutes on each side and then roasted for an additional 10 at 300 degrees (I was cooking a single serving hence the short cooking time).  It came out wonderfully.

Wow!  I believe it was the cooking method that made this the moistest pork roast I've ever made, and we loved the combination of garlic and herbs.  This is now my go-to recipe for pork roast.  (used a pork roast vs. pork loin, took 1 hr on 300)

I made this last night and it was unbelievably good. My partner is finicky about pork and she asked for seconds!! I took the drippings and made a gravy. Don't add extra salt to the gravy as the drippings have plenty. Served with a rosemary and shallot popover (great to dip in the gravy). I am gleeking just thinking about it

I was not a fan of this recipe.  My husband said it was good, but I'm not sure if he was just saying that to spare my feelings.  I just thought it the flavor was too overpowering and it was a little too salty.  Maybe I put the paste on a little too thick?

This was super easy and really good. The next time I make it I would cut back on the salt, but the flavor of the spices with this roast were great!
I baked it for about 20 minutes at 425, then lowered the tempature to 300 and cooked the roast to 145 degrees, then took it out of the oven and let it rest for about 20 minutes. 
AMAZING! Thank you!

This was really delicious. I was skeptical because it looked so simple, but everyone loved it. I needed to cook it about 20 mins longer than it called for, even though I let it rest at room temp for an hour before. It was still a little pink, even with the extra time.

Used dried herbs as didn't have fresh.  Just used less.  Came out very moist and tender, could cut it with a fork.  I made two loins, thinly sliced the leftover for sandwiches.  I would like to try this again basted with barbecue or another sauce.

I rubbed the paste on the meat and let sit in fridge overnight and WOW - so flavorful.  Cooked overnight in crockpot on low with enough water to cover meat and the pork was so tender.  Used liquid to make gravy and served with mashed potatoes and peas.  This might just be my new favorite!

Cutting this recipe in half worked well with a one pound pork tenderloin.   I just had to adjust the cooking time - 425 degrees for 25 minutes.  It was simply excellent.  Tender, juicy, perfectly cooked and deliciously flavored with an ideal blend of seasonings – proof that Chef Aidells knows what he’s doing.

Everyone loved this. The only thing I changed was the salt, since I did not have coarse salt I used regular table salt and halved it to 1 tsp. It did take a lot longer to cook at 300 but was very moist and delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this recipe with pork roast on the bone which required closer to 60-minutes at the lower heat.  It was fabulous.

The recipe is one of our pork favorites!  Typically, we triple the amount of paste ingredients, gives it more flavor.  DEFINITELY make sure you use fresh sage & rosemary.

Aside from not having rosemary, I made this recipe as written and it is AWESOME. The pork is very moist and tender. This recipe is very simple and quick to make, which is a plus for me. My husband and I work 10 hour days and this was the perfect meat to cook after work!! Thanks!!

Halved the salt and didn't use rosemary.. this was fantastic - about an hour to cook 2lbs. Update: Today I'm trying it in the crock pot with potatoes and carrots (seasoned with salt and pepper) and 1 1/4 cups of water. I'll get back to you! Edit: The crockpot version was still good but not as great as the oven. Note to self. :) Today I'm trying it with 1 1/2 cups of beef broth.

Very good.  I was only making a 1 lb pork since it was just for my husband and I.  I reduced the ingredients by half but otherwise followed the instructions.  It did take me a full 50 minutes to get to the correct temp but it was perfectly cooked with great flavor and was very juicy.  I plan to make some  yummy tenderloin sandwiches with the leftovers.

This is by far the absolute best pork roast in the world.  You will do yourself a huge favor using this recipe.  The flavor is incredible and it is so moist.  Just don't overcook - please use a meat thermometer whenever doing a pork roast.  Nothing worse than dry pork. The fresh herbs are a must.

Oh my gosh.  SO good.  The paste was to die for. It cooked a LOT longer than the recipe said but that may be because I had potatoes roasting in the oven as well.  Will DEFINITELY make again, and may use the paste for other things too.

This is one of my fav recipes on this site.  It's so full of flavor... use fresh herbs if you can, but I've made it with dry when my fresh herbs were needing a break and it was still fantastic.  Don't skimp on the garlic. So tasty and moist... yum!

Outstanding! I had a 6 lb pork loin so it took longer than the 15-20 min stated.  I also added potatoes and olive oil with fresh rosemary to the pan as one person suggested.  The whole meal was full of flavor!!

This roast is excellent!  I made the rub just as the recipe called for.  The only thing I MIGHT change is to use a little less salt... but otherwise, it is perfect, just the way it is.  This has become a staple in my house for dinner since I have all of these seasonings already and I usually buy pork roasts in bulk from Costco and always have them on hand. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I was a bit afraid of the lower cooking temperature, (because the packaged instructions said 350 for 45 minutes) however, I tried this method and it came out wonderfully. My bf said it was amazing and looked like a chef had prepared it (so I guess I have the referenced chef here to thank). It was very juicy and flavorful. I am definitely using this again in the future. Thanks!

This was fantastic.  I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used dried herbs and I added a bit of lemon juice.  I also made it in the slow cooker.  The juice from the bottom made an excellent gravy (although a little salty).  Will definitely make again!

This was really good. Mine was a little salty but that could be on me I think I added a little more than it called for. I was worried that it wouldn't be cooked all the way because everything I have read says that pork should be cooked to 160, but I checked it again before serving and it made its way up to 160 so I was happy. I used dried (ground) herbs and this was still really good. THANKS!!!!

Absolutely delicious. I was looking for a quick pork loin recipe that was moist and delicious but didn't require a marinade, and this fit the bill. I didn't use fresh spices and the flavor was still out of this world! I just added a tablespoon of lemon juice and left the rest of the recipe the same. My loin was only 1.15 lbs and although the amount of spices worked perfectly, so did the cooking time (barely). So if you have a 2 lb loin then you'll definitely need to cook it longer.

First time I have managed to roast a regular (not tenderloin) pork loin without it coming out tough.  I roasted potatoes with the pork, and then stirred them around in the drippings after the pork and potatoes sat under the foil for 10 minutes.  It came out perfect!  (I did have to cook the pork about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.)

Absolutely Delicious! I loved it but I used spices instead of fresh herbs and vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  It turned out wonderful but the cook time is off. I  ended up cooking it 20 minutes at 450º and 75 minutes at 300º to get it fully cooked.

I followed the directions to the letter, and mine came out hard and dry even though there was a lot of juices in the roaster.

If I were only rating the flavor it would be 5-stars for sure - delicious! But the cooking times were way off for me so I finally adjusted my oven temp up to 350* to get it done. The leftovers made excellent carnitas the next day. Just fantastic flavor!

Best pork roast I've ever had!  I even used dried sage and rosemary.  I can't imagine how good it is usng fresh.  I had a 5 lb. roast and doubled the recipe.  And, it was soooo easy!

Followed this recipe with a pork loin with ribs roast and it came out great - very juicy.   Toook longer to cook because of bone and size.

I gave this 5 stars for the wonderful flavor and the ease of cooking/prep. I also used dried herbs with fresh garlic and it was wonderful. The cooking time was a bit off for me, even though I used 1.5 lbs. I ended up needing it to cook for about 50 minutes.

I bought a hughe pork roast and sectioned it off for this recipe.  The smaller portion cooked faster.  It was very moist.  I didn't have fresh sage but the dry sage worked just as well. My family loved it!

I've changed the spices up and used this recipe numerous times and it's always a winner.  I find that my roasts seem to take a little longer to cook, but that's easily adapted to so it's no big deal.  Super easy even for those of us who aren't chefs.

I added a little lemon juice as suggested by others.  I ended up marinating it for a few hours just due to my schedule.  It was well liked.

My husband was so thrilled when I found this recipe again. The last time I made it he couldn't eat enough of it! The pork roast came out so tender and delicious. I used 5 fresh garlic cloves and 1 fresh onion minced. Used Italian seasoning for the sage and rosemary.

Delicious pork roast.  I make this recipe a lot.  In my oven, it's 15 minutes at 450 and then 45 minutes at 300.  I have used fresh and/or dried herbs for this and they're both good.

I Love this mixture for seasoning meat.  I have used a substitution, using minced garlic in olive oil, and I have reduced the salt, but it's wonderful.  My family likes it quite a bit, including my brother, who "doesn't eat pork".  He eats this when I make it.   I have also used the mixture to coat a cut of beef, and chicken.  It works great!

Very tasty and moist roast pork. I made the recipe as written, except I used a few extra garlic cloves. I poked holes in the roast and stuffed the extra garlic cloves into the meat before roasting. Very flavorful.

This was tasty! BUT, I was surprised that it took much longer to cook than what the recipe called for, taking 1 hr and 10 minutes. The internal temp would not get to the 145 degrees (used two thermometers: a digital and dial). It was, however, worth the wait! It would be a 5 star, but because of time had to increase, I'm giving it 4 stars.

For those of you who said it took longer to cook than the recipes states, the recipe says: "Turn oven temperature down to 300 degrees F., roast for 15-20 minutes, TAKE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE using an instant-read thermometer. WHEN THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF THE ROAST IS 145 DEGREES F (63 degrees C), REMOVE FROM OVEN".  That means just to take the temp after 15-20 minutes AND LEAVE IT IN THE OVEN until temp is 145.  Just wanted to clarify that.  I'm putting mine in the oven now.  Update:  Mine came out dry. I let it go to 150 F internal temp.

Tried it twice, twice it was great!  For those who tried it and it came out dry, perhaps you used a tenderloin...big difference.  And Joanne,  where did you ever get the idea that pork needs to be cooked to 175 degrees?!  You may call yourself a cook but nobody else does....

Great recipe! Used dried Rosemary and table salt. But it was really good. Like my husband said, the flavor from the paste was all the way through the meat.

This was fantastic. I made some changes though. First, instead of pork loin, I used salmon - Sockeye specifically. I swapped the oven out for a smoker running around 215 deg F, and added to the spices a St. Louis style dry rub. My version turned out great - thank you all other reviewers for giving this such a high rating for your individually proposed changes. Really great recipe thank you. This rating system is without flaw.

Excellent--timing was perfect, very easy and quick, made rub exactly as described except dried herbs and minced garlic from a jar. Short cook time with initial roasting yielded perfectly done, very juicy and tender roast. I accidentally let it roast a little longer at 450 than instructed due to interruption by my kids. Turned oven off just as it barely hit 145 degrees on the meat thermometer, covered loosely with foil, left in the oven, ran to basketball practice, came back and it's perfect. I mixed the rub in a mini food processor and used pre-minced, jarred garlic. My roast was 2.8 pounds. When it was roasted smelled like sausage. Definitely a keeper!

Tried this on a 7-1/2 pound top loin pork roast from Costco. Tripled the garlic, 2 TBsp salt, 1 TBsp pepper, 1/4 cup sage and 2 TBsp dried rosemary. Enough olive oil to make a paste -- it was more than triple or quadruple the recipe amount. It took about 3 hours for the internal temp to reach 145. Our guests raved about it. It looked and tasted fantastic. A definite do-over.

Best pork ever. The flavor combination paired with the crispness of the outside are delicious. I make it as is except I cook it all the way through. When my husband gets too full to eat any more, he cuts the tops off so he can eat more of the crusty outside.

Very good!  I used dried sage (1 tsp) since I didn't have fresh.  From other reviewers' advice, I used very little salt.   I also added 3 large red potatoes, quartered, drizzled with olive oil, around the small pork roast.  15 minutes at 450, then 300 for 60 minutes. I turned the potatoes over halfway through.  I used a meat thermometer to verify when the meat was done.  A keeper recipe!

Easy, will make again, dried spices work great as does minced garlic in oil. Instead of a shallow roasting pan, I used a glass dish with as many cut vegetables (onion, baby carrots, garlic cloves, mini sweet peppers, etc) as I could fit all around which were coated with olive oil. Once I turned oven temperature down to 300-deg F and roasted for 20 minutes, the internal temperature was still 150-deg F, so in order to get it to DONE at 170-deg F, I added an additional 50 minutes (checking at the 30 minute mark).  The temp did not increase while resting. I scooped out the veggies and juice and put them in a pot on the stove to serve on the side extra hot.

My husband loved this dish, he said it was the best pork dish he ever had! I used 1 tsp of dry sage and 1 tsp of dry rosemary instead of fresh. I rubbed the paste on the pork and wrapped it in foil in the morning to marinade, so all I had to do in the evening was put it in the oven (still in the foil). The cooking time for me worked perfectly and there was no clean up of the roasting pan. The meat was very tender and you could taste the marinade even in the middle of the piece. Served it with the large salad and grilled asparagus. Love it!!! Thank you very much for the recipe!

So simple but very flavorful. I did need to cook about 40 minutes at 300 degrees after the initial 15 min/450. Would definitely make this again!

I cooked it on a rack in a shallow roasting pan at 450 degrees for 15 minutes and 350 degrees for 30 minutes, added a little water to the pan for the last 10 -15 mins, and it was juicy and cooked to 165 degrees.
Fabulous taste.

great recipe! I cooked it to 165F and it was still very juicy. I also guess that the different timing people claim to have used is a matter of taste and the oven you have. the thermometer is key to ensure you cook it to your liking. definitely try this recipe!

I tried this recipe the other day and I will admit I am NOT one of the worlds better cooks, but I can hold my own.  But copying this recipe and "clearly" not thinking it through, I did as it was printed.  I cooked it until the internal temperature was 145 degrees. WHAT?? PORK?  I think not.  Pork is 175 degrees. Needless to say - we ate the potatoes and the asparagus that I prepared to be done when the pork would be done, about 1/2 hour before the meat was done.  I'll double check the recipe next time. It was delicious - just not eaten with the other sides I prepared.

The taste was good.  I would never add salt like most recipes call for, so only added a sprinkle.  The cooking time was way off for me, it almost looks like they meant pork tenderloin not centre cut loin.

It took a little longer to cook, but it was worth it.
The pork was moist (which surprised me as it was cooked uncovered) and tasty.
Easy prep for a tasty meal.

Excellent.  The next time I would only use a quarter of the salt.  I did have to cook my roast for an additional 40 minutes as it was very thick.  Added quartered red potatoes and some carrots at the start of cooking.  Will make again!

This is delicious!  It made wonderful sandwiches the next day too.  I will probably use this rub on all kinds of meats. It is super easy and very flavorful.  It is extremely salty, and you could reduce the salt, but I don't recommend it, as the salt is supposed to form a "crust" to seal in the juices.  Just knock a little of it off and mix it into your mashed potatoes!  As for the increased cooking times that some are reporting, this recipe probably refers to the tenderloin, which is about 2 inches across, and will cook very quickly.  If you are using a whole loin which is usually about 4 inches across, or a roast, you will need to cook it longer.

I will make this again.  It was moist and delicious!
Other reviewers were absolutely correct about the salt-I used 1 tsp. sea salt and it was still a little too salty for us.  Also the baking time, I needed more time, but I suppose it depends on the thickness of the meat and also oven temps. seem to vary.  Using a meat thermometer is best.

We just made this recipe tonight. My entire family liked it even my kids which are picky eaters. The only complaint I have is that the pepper is overwhelming and makes it somewhat spicy. I will definitely make it again but next time I will add about half of the pepper.

A little to crusty w/ all the herbs. The kids really turned their noses up to this one. Sensory overload. They wanted to know what every speck of spice was..
