I used fresh broccoli and fresh potatoes (peeled & julienned) & added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to the soup stuff. I had to cook it covered for 90 minutes at 350, but it was delicious... not soupy or mushy.

Great recipe although I did make a few 
changes.  First, I used Tater Tots and
baked them 3/4 time first.  I layered Tots in baking dish.  I exchanged cheddar
cheese for the parmesan.  I used 1/2c 2%
milk and low fat mayo. only using about
1/8 cup.  I mixed everything together and
added a "sprinkle" of Santa Maria style 
seasoning and a tsp+ of dijon mustard.
I mixed 1 cup of cheddar cheese with the 
mix.  I baked for 35 min and then sprinkled the top with more cheddar for 
the remaining 5 min.  Wow, quick, easy,
and delicious.  Not runny at all.  Great
for leftover holiday ham.  Would definately make again.
Forgot to mention that I used fresh broccoli.

This was really, really good.  I did add a few touches of my own.  I used frozen hashbrowns a little onion powder and garlic.  And instead of layering the ingredients, I mixed it all up with the soup and mayo.  So what you come out with, is a very creamy dish.  This is a good quick meal for the family on the go.

Delicious! Here are my adaptations: I layered four thinly sliced potatoes in the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish. I sprinkled garlic powder and chopped onion on top of them and baked for 35 minutes at 375. I mixed chopped smoked kielbasa (didn't have ham), defrosted broccoli, two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 can of milk, 1/4c mayonaise, 1 cup of shredded monterey/colby cheese, 1 4oz can of mushrooms together and poured over pre-baked potatoes and baked for another hour.  There weren't any leftovers!!

WE THOUGHT IT WAS A KEEPER. I SUBSTITUTED SLICES OF PARBOILED POTATOES INSTEAD OF THE FRIES, ADDED ONIONS, AND CHEDDAR CHEESE.

I changed it just a tad, I used hashbrowns instead and added some mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.For the last 10 minutes, I put some more shredded cheddar cheese on top with only 1/2 the called for parm. cheese, and then sprinkled some french fried onions on top of that. My family ate it up! I will be making this again, and again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover ham and tried this.  It is delicious and easy!  I used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan.  My family of very picky eaters loved it and gave their thumbs up. I put this one in my recipe file.

Wow, this was sooooo good!  I used cornbread on the bottom instead of french fries.  It gave is sweet, yummy taste!  I never really knew what to do with left over ham except for mac and cheese.  Thank you for your new idea!!!

First, this recipe is great comfort food.  I did add about a cup of Cheddar Cheese to the soup/milk mixture, along with a can of sliced mushrooms.    After reading the reviews, I opted to use hashbrowns instead of French Fries, and I shredded my own potatoes rather than using frozen -- mostly to make sure the potatoes would cook thoroughly.  They cooked fine, but the dish is really not very appetizing to look at when made this way with hash browns.  Next time, I will use potato slices that I parboil for a few minutes first to ensure they cook through.  I will also add some sauted onions and garlic, along with some salt and pepper to taste.  Will definitely use more Cheddar Cheese next time too.  Even without my changes though, I think this is a great comfort food and my whole family liked it.

This casserole is devine.  Extremely creamy.  I used 1 can of sliced potatoes in place of french fries...other reviews states that makes it mushy.  I had to cook for 60 & then let sit for 10 for desired consistancy.  Next time I may cut milk in half to allow for less cooking time.  I also combined all ingredients instead of layering and topped with approx 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese.

I made this with leftovers from Christmas dinner.  Used mashed potatoes on the bottom, 1 - 16 oz bag of frozen broccoli, cut up leftover ham,  1 can of cream of broccoli soup, not quite a full can of milk, and the mayo.  Added shredded cheddar-jack cheese on top and baked for 45 min.  Turned out wonderfully.  Was a little runny, but not to the point that it made a big deal.

THIS WAS FABULOUS!!! I used Lisa D's review as my main reference. I used kielbasa instead of ham
(I like the flavor better!) I layered everything in this order: Potatoes, Onions(I follow Lisa D's advice and baked 35 min) brocoli, Kielbasa. I then poured the liquid mixture over everthing and put a layer of cheese over the top! ( I kicked the mixture up a bit with a little hot sauce-I'm a soul food cook at heart) 
I would suggest lettiing this set a good 30-45 minutes if you have the time after it bakes for an hour! I have leftovers for lunch and I can't wait to eat them! :) Thank you Lisa D for your revision! It was so helpful! 
Definitely give this a try!Bon apetit!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except for substitutions of ingredients I did not have on hand and it was WONDERFUL! I par boiled 2 sliced potatoes, added a chopped onion on top of that layer, added petite frozen peas as I had no broccoli on hand, 1 cup each sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese and added 1 Tbsp mustard powder to the soup mix! Very good - the hubby loved it and had seconds! It makes a bunch so shared with the neighbors and they asked for the recipe!

I seen this recipe on the newest reviews and recognized it. I got a Taste of Home cookbook that is for casseroles. I have made it a few times. The ingredients sound strange but it really is good. The difference is the one I make calls for broccoli soup instead of mushroom, cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, and a little more mayo. It is called ham and tator bake. Steak fries also work the best with this recipe.

I made this for supper tonight. I did a few things different, though. I used hash browns instead of fries, sliced ham cold cuts, 2 cans of cream of broccoli soup and about 1/2 lb. American cheese. I omitted the mayo and Parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again.

If you  double this recipe use two 9X13 pans.  The scaled recipe does NOT tell you this.  I put it all in the one pan and who knows what will happen!

Great way to use up leftover ham. Not having the french fries I sliced up potatoes which I needed to use up. Other than that the recipe was followed except.... I didn't read all the directions and added the Parmesan in with the soup and milk. It was still good. Also, I added about 2 1/2 cups of ham. The stated amount didn't seem like enough for us. Not sure what this dish has but my husband, along with quite a few others, just loved this. If I didn't stop him he would have gone for thirds.

After following Lisa D's advice, we loved this recipe. I tweaked her recommendations a bit, but they work really well. I sliced some peeled potatoes very thinly, layered the bottom of the dish with them, put some diced red onions on top of them, and lightly coated it all with garlic powder. I baked them at 375 for about 30 min. I put defrosted broccoli on top of that, then cut up "Carving Board Ham" from Oscar Mayer on top of that. In a separate bowl, I mixed together 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, and 8 oz of canned milk. I spread that over the top of the casserole and let it sit for awhile (so that the liquid could reach the potatoes). I cooked in at 375 for about an hour and it was awesome! Great recipe! Will make again.

I took this to a church function and it was quickly gone...which I believe it the best test of a recipe.  My life is busy so making something simple is imperative.  I followed the advice of others and mixed everything together.  I did use just half of the evaporated milk. I was using frozen hashbrowns and frozen broccoli which added more moisture.  The consistency was great and was not watery or too moist.  I would definite make this recipe again.  Takes minutes to make and is very tasty.

I also used hashbrowns instead of french fries to avoid the soggy factor, but it was still too soggy and soupy for my taste.  Perhaps frying the hashbrowns first to give them a crunch would be better??

My daughter loved this dish! As other people suggested, I used hashbrowns. Since I used a slightly smaller baking pan than it called for, I cut down on the broccoli and didn't use the mayo. It came out just right. I used a mix of Italian shredded cheese and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top.

Used frozen country style hash browns in place of french fries.  Added some Seasoned salt.  Sprinkled cheddar cheese on the top at the end of baking and let it melt.  Yum!

YUM! I thought this was really, *REALLY* good! You would never think because of the simple ingredients but oh my! I used Kielbasa sausage in place of the ham. Next time, I will use tater tots, as others suggested, or sliced potato.

This turned out much then I thought it would. My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again. I used 2 1/2 cups ham, only a 1/4 cup reduced fat parmesan, and 1 1/4 cups reduced fat mozzarella, and instead of the mayo, I used 1/4 cup of fat free ricotta.  I also did not put the mozzarella on until about the last 10 minutes of oven time.  I was afraid that it was burn if were in the oven for 40 minutes.

B/c of the add'l ham, it made 8 servings.  For anyone one on Weight Watchers, I calculated this recipes with my modifications to 5 points per serving. Note: I used the lowest points value Ore-Ida french fries I could find.

What a great dish!! I was looking to use up some Easter ham, & chose this! I used tater tots, frying them in the deep fryer first, as some reviews found bottom to be mushy. I also used cream of chicken as I didn't have cream of mushroom, and used heavy whipping cream in place of milk as I had some to use up. This recipe is sure to go on our regular meal list!!! Thanks!!

Very Interesting.  Also extrememly easy to make.  To tell you the truth, I was afraid that it would not taste well.  But, I tried it anyways and actually liked it.  I did, however add a layer of cheddar cheese on top of the layer of french fries.  I also noticed a few people saying it was a little soggy, so I cut back on the milk some.  All and all it was not bad, the kids liked it and I will definitely make it again when a quick and easy meal is needed.

Delicious! I used tater tots instead of fries, and since I don't eat gluten I made a gluten free cream of chicken and replaced the cream of mushrooms. It was delicious!

This is such a great recipe... I used frozen hash browns (that I thawed first) instead of the frozen french fries. I also added about a half a cup of grated cheddar cheese to the soup milk and mayonaise mixture and I did reduce the milk to just 1 cup instead of the 10.7 oz.
For the topping I substituted the parmesian (because i didn't have any) for grated romano cheese. Then I topped with some buttered bread crumbs mixed with some french fried onions. (the kind that are crunchy used for "Green Bean Casserole"..... This dish came out so good, not runny but firm and the buttered bread crumbs and fried onion gave it a great flavor and it really browned up nice! delicious! Will be making again.

Have been making this recipe from here for years. Finally reviiewing it !! Have made with all types of different vegetables, made with chicken or ground beef, and different types of frozen potatoes ( Love making it with tater tots!). Last week I planned on making it again, but forgot the steak fries !! I did have a box of Mrs T's sweet potato pierogies and a box of Wegmans whole wheat pierogies in the freezer. So I used them instead. Fantastic turnout !! ( Made this one with ground beef). Just a good, easy and flexible recipe!!

Great dish!  I have a habit of getting as many veggies in dishes as I can, so i cut up potatoes and sweet potatoes in french fry size..broiled 10 mins first..but I also added parsley and french fried onions on top. My granddaughter, who is four, wanted more!  This is very very good!!

I added a half cup of cheese and one small onion, and used only half can a milk, but it was still too watery at the bottom. I think this recipe would be better if the the ingredients were not all frozen, cause they end up defrosting right into the dish. Best to cook or defrost beforehand. Other than than that, the casserole had a great flavor and it was a nice way to use up leftovers.

Mu husband and I loved this!  My daughter who is 3 liked it but I think the whole mess of it on her plate made her wonder....  I made some changes as I did not have the soup.  I put in only 1/4 cup mayo, added 1/3 cup sour cream and about 1/2 cup half and half.  I also used about 1.5 cups fresh shredded cheddar and a healthy shake of grated Parm.  Dont forget the garlic powder. Also after 30 minutes I topped it off with 1 egg beaten with a shake of bread crumbs and more parm cheese and about 3 or 4 tbls poons half and half.  Whisked it all and poured over the top. It gave it some crunch.  It was very thick and creamy.  If you prefer it more loose you could do milk instead of half and half... YUM!!!

I took the idea of the recipe and cooked a ham slice in a skillet and cut into cubes.  In a large casserole dish I put 1 can broccali cheese soup, 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup Helmans, 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup shredded chesse and the ham.  I added the hashbrowns and broccali and added potato toppers, seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Added half and half until creamy.  Sprinkled with parmesan and baked for one hour at 375.  It was delicious.  

Next time I will add more ham.

Easy to make and I microaved the broccali 4 minutes to break it up.

I was looking for a recipe for "Musko night" (everything "must go").  Had 2 half bags of frozen french fries, half a bag of broccoli and leftover ham so thought this would be right up our alley.  It was really better than I expected but I think if I made it again, I would substitute grated cheddar cheese for the parmesan.  Easy and quick for leftovers.

I gave this 5 stars because it freezes very well and is easy to put together.  It tastes really good too. I am always looking for dishes that I can make ahead of time and freeze for my family or to give to friends with new babies. I used tater-tots.

This was OK. I scaled down and put in a smaller dish otherwise we wouldn't eat it all.  The kids looked skeptical but eventually picked out the ham and a piece or two of broccoli - leaving the potatoes to swim on their plates.  I thought it tasted pretty good but the appearance wasn't much to be desired.  I may make this again but not for a while.

Very good! I used fresh, chopped broccoli florets instead of frozen. Also, I used hash browns instead of fries. I added mushrooms, garlic powder and onion powder. Everyone loved it! I'll be making this for a pot luck Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks!

I made the non-fast-food version of this and instead of the frozen fries, mayo, canned soup business I par-boiled and sliced some potatoes and made a cheese sauce from scratch with some mushroom soup bouillon that you can get here in Prague. Layered the whole lot, covered in the sauce and grated some more cheeese on top. It came out nice and tasty. I'm having this for lunch the whole week and I'm quite happy about that.

This was a Weird recipe... It was good and I ate eveyrthing on my plate but I don't know if I loved it or not. I used the tator tots like others suggested and the kids did not like that part at all... it was cold and all mushy, all of them picked the veggies and ham out of it and ate them leaving the tots. But for all the faces they were making they did eat most of it. Also I'm not a huge Parmesan cheese fan so although it tasted good when it was cooked, the smell while cooking kinda turned everyone off to the dish before we even tried it. Oh And 40 mins was not enough for us.. I started it all frozen like the recipe said but the tots were still cold and mushy and the veggies were still slightly hard. I'll probably make it again b/c my hubby really liked it and the kids did eat more than I thought they would but I will probably try it w/ fries next time just to see the difference in taste and I'll change the cheese to chedder like others said.

I was looking for an easy dish for using up left over spiral glazed ham.  With the cinnamon topping it sometimes makes certain combos taste strange. I made one dish following ingredient listed on recipe and another version using sweet potato fries instead of reg., and substituted asparagus for broccoli.  I also added extra cheese, muenster.  Everything else was same. 
 I liked the original version -but frozen brocolli left casserole alittle too wet, so next time I would use less milk to compensate.  The real winner was the sweet potato french fries and asparagus, muenster version.  Simple, and when  the tops of the spiral ham is used ,slightly sweet.  Best of all surprisingly delish!

I am not usually a big fan of casseroles with the typical heavy cream of mushroom style.     I made this one  as written except used cheddar and lightened the sauce a bit with lowfat soup and less mayo and by applying the soup mixture sparingly.    This  was WONDERFUL!!!!     SO EASY!!!!!!!!!!!    Nutritious and pretty healthy!   Delicious comfort food- not a drop left on the pan- even the kids were getting second helpings and grown ups agreed it achieved the ideal of comfort food and tasted homemade.  I am so delighted (if you couldn't tell) to have a really truly easy recipe that is actually enjoyable AND is wholesome and pretty darn healthy!    I reduced the mayo (light) a bit and used nearly fat free soup.  Then I added lowfat milk just a little at a time to a desirable consistency for spreading the soup layer because I didn't want it too soupy/creamy but more of a coating of sauce- it looked like a sparse soup layer at the end but was perfect for our taste.  Then I  used the healthiest oven fries I could find (simple frozen alexia brand, mine purchased at whole foods), used individually packed Ham steaks that I diced, frozen broccoli, cheddar.   So easy, so fast to put together and sooooo  delish!!!!    (Oh and I raised the oven temp to 425 to speed things up).

I parboiled the potatoes sprinkled seasoned salt on them and used fresh barely cooked broccoli.  I followed all the other instructions as written in addition to one teaspoon of Dijon mustard.   My family gobbled it up!

We did like this.  I used some onion, sour cream instead of mayo and a can of mushroom chunks  added to the sour cream/soup mixture.  Also used fast food fries fries(baked them for 14 minutes first), thawed/steamed the broccoli, then mixed everything (but the cheese and tater tots) together and  poured over the fries.  Also used shredded parmesan.    I did try it using crinkle fries, extra mushroom pieces and mayo and it tasted kind of gross.   I don't like mayo as a rule.

I have never tried this recipe before because I don't eat broccoli but, it was awesome lol. My fiance,daughter & I both enjoyed it very much.  So even though I don't eat/ never ever like broccoli, I was willing to try it( something different). So what I did to change it a little, I cut the broccoli up to about the size of a dime seasoned it, and cooked it on top of the stove for 5 mins. & I used both parmesan & sharp cheddar on top. It was a little more creamer than I excepted but still was awesome. Oh & the broccoli was not over cooked even after I put It in the casserole, it was perfect( my fiance told me lol). Would definitely try it again.

The recipe was great but I did some things a little different.  I used hashbrowns instead of french fries & chunky chicken breasts that you can purchase in a can. I did not use all of the canned milk either,  just 1/4 cup. When using the chicken, I seasoned it very well and used hot sauce with the chicken mixture.  My children really enjoyed it, which means it was really good :)

worried that this was going to be bland as written, i seasoned it up with some dry ranch dressing mix.. i subbed some cauliflower and a couple of small carrots that were begging to be used up in the fridge since i didn't have any broccoli.. used some polish chicken sausage for the ham and tater tots for the french fries.. also added a cubed up russet potato.. i was being lazy and didn't want to pre-cook the tater tots, but i do believe they'd be better for it.. i, like others, mixed everything together and just threw it in the oven.. covered for 45 min's and then uncovered for another 15.. it was still kind of soupy when i took it out and this was with only using 3/4 cup milk (soy).. it did eventually firm up to consistency i wanted.. this is for bf's lunch but we both tried a bite and agreed it was pretty good with the modifications.. ty for the recipe

Yummy ... I did make a few changes ..... used Cream of Celery soup, hash brown potatoes, zucchini and Worcestershire sauce.  I used two small baking dishes.  In my husband's I added sliced (fresh) mushrooms.  If you want comfort food, then this is it!

This is great! So flavorful and delicious! I didn't have french fries, so I just cubed some potatoes and coated them with olive oil and S&P. I baked them in the oven and used that instead of fries. I also cooked the broccoli first. I will definitely add this into my recipe rotation. YUMMY!

I have made this one time, exactly how the recipes is, no substitutions and I found it was really salty for our liking.  I think instead of canned milk, use 1% or skim, and instead of parmesan cheese, just use mozzarella and cheddar and it would be a nicer flavor.   I would also pre-cook the french fries on their own first, so they stay crispy once the layers are added to it.  We found the fries mushy.

So so good!  I did change it up...but just a little bit.  Used Tater Tots and cooked them about 3/4 of the way before adding the rest of the ingredients (per another reviewer's suggestion)...also instead of layering the ingredients, I mixed them all together in a bowl.  And I topped it off with some colby/jack cheese.  YUM!!!!!  I will make this everytime I have ham leftovers.  There were NO LEFTOVERS of this casserole though!

I loved it, but I had to use other ingredients because I didn't have everything on hand. I had to substitute frozen roasted potatoes, chopped broccoli, and cheddar cheese. I also topped the casserole with crushed up Lays Garlic Cheese Bread Chips. It was delicious, but next time I will add some more salt and pepper. I do plan on trying it the original way too.

We found this to be just OK. Per other reviewers, I added seasonings (onion powder, garlic, etc.). I added additional cheeses & I pre-cooked frozen Steak Fries. I didn't really care for the texture of the fries on the bottom. I might like it better if everything was mixed together.

I used tator tots. Cooked for 15 min at 425 and then added everything else, inc the poupon.  I didn't have any milk so I subbed some sour cream and water and mixed it all together.  I had some leftover kidneys and added those but they didn't really add to it.  I liked the broccoli.  I only had one head - wish I had more, and some onions

I made this for supper last night. My boyfriend really lliked it. I used potatoes and fresh broccoli.  I cooked it for 45 mins., but it wasn't done, so I put it in the microwave. Will precook them next time. It was also quite watery. Will used less milk next time.

Super easy prep.  I used 2 stalks fresh broccoli. Came out a little runny and French Fries were undercooked so I left it in the oven 12 more minutes then turned the oven off and let it stand in the oven another 10 minutes.  Came out much better.  Next time I will bake the FF by themselves for about 20 minutes THEN add the rest of the ingredients. Just needed a little salt & pepper at the table.

I used a can of sliced potatoes rather than the french fries. Just as easy & a bit healthier. The whole family enjoyed it - I did add hot sauce to 1/2 of it for me & my husband.

This was good. I made it with real potatoes and no ham. It needed something though. Something other than meat.

Very good recipe.  I will definitely make this again, although next time, I think I might change it up slightly and use tater tots as a top layer as I've seen some other casserole recipes.  I just like the potatoes crispier.  -just a personal preference, but LOVED the flavors in this recipe, and my 2 year old cleaned his plate!

My husband is a picky eater and he ate two servings of this dish.  I am rating it a five because he seem to really like it.  I am not a broccoli fan, but I did eat it and thought it was good for a broccoli dish.

I used hash browns & fried them prior to spreading them in the dish. Just mixed the rest, along with some cheddar cheese, spread it over the potatoes & added some more cheddar on top. Great recipe! It would even make a good breakfast!

I was very dissapointed by this recipe.The combination sounded great but once everything was put together it was nasty.It was extreamly bland.I made it without tweeking it.The only thing I changed was that I used seasoned fries.I don't belive I'll be making this again.Sorry.

This was pretty good, although I was not crazy about the mayo in it, next time will maybe use sour cream instead.  The kiddos were split with one liking it and the other, not so much, but the husband did really like this!  Probably will make this again as it is a snap to make!

This recipe is good for leftover meats. I followed it exactly except used some leftover grilled chicken. The meal was good and no one in my family complained They did say it wasn't something they would ask for. The fries were not as well done as I would have liked. Next time I make this, I plan to bake the fries or maybe hashbrowns, before I add the other ingredients to the top. Hopefully they will be more cooked.

I made this tonight but used chicken instead of ham as I didn't have ham in the freezer like I thought. Next time I make it I plan on using a medium cheese sauce instead of the soup. Now I have a new recipe for the next potluck, I am sure everyone is tired of the same old dish I take all the time.

I actually used chicken instead of ham; added a little garlic salt and a extra layer of hashbrowns on top and then added lots of shredded cheeses. This was a great recipe and will be making it again and again!

I too substituted hash browns for the fries. I was trying to use up some Easter leftovers so I used fresh broccoli. I also used mild cheddar instead of the parmesan cheese.

My family (which includes 2 small finicky children loved this dish. The cheddar probably added to the saltiness of the ham, so I'll follow the recipe and use parmesan next time.

Very easy and really quick to assemble. Add a salad and dinner roll and you have fast, complete dinner for those busy weeknights.

This one's a keeper for me! My changes were to use, in layer order:
2 cups diced leftover baked potatoes
1/2 leftover roasted onion chopped (if I didn't have that I'd try 1/4 fine diced raw onion)
3/4 cup fresh broc cut into small florettes
3/4 cup frozen corn
same amount of ham
for sauce I used 1/2 cup parm and 1/2 cup diced cheddar which stayed on top and made a nice cheesy topping, plus 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a good grind of pepper
Next time I'll only use 1/2 cup milk as the sauce was a bit soupy. Yum! Having the leftovers for lunch right now! :)

I do not understand the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with a gooey, tasteless mess. The french fries turned out a mashed up, soppy mess. Won't be trying this one again.

Excellent!! I just used sliced potatoes and layered the broccolli and ham cubes on that followed by the creamy mixture over everything and little shredded cheddar and there you go. Took about an hour on 375. Delicious!

I changed the soup to cream of chicken (my boys don't like mushrooms), and mixed everything but the potatoes together.  I shredded some Colby Jack on top, then TOPPED it with the tater tots to keep them crisp.  The boys loved it.

I make this all the time however i just gave it 4 stars because i change it just a bit.  I use frozen steak fries and cream of broccoli soup, i add a little bit more ham and instead of parmesan cheese at the last 15 minutes of cooking i uncover and sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese on it. Also, i thaw the broccoli before i layer it on.  I also usually have to cook it for an hour or so. My family LOVES this.

This was surprisingly good! I took other suggestions and made with tater tots and used kielbasa instead of ham because that's what I had. I was sceptical at first, but ended up really enjoying it.

we made this tonight. my husband and i loved it, it was absoultely delicious. i needed to use up the left over easter ham. for the french fries i used seasoned crispy kind. It turned out good, it wasn't crispy but it was soft (potato-like). I used fresh broccoli. I also topped it with cheddar cheese. It was amazing, we loved it. it's a keeper!

Looking for a quick side when I came across this great recipe. I mixed my mayonaise with a little ranch dressing mix before adding it to the soup mix. Made this for my hubby and dad. Both thought it was excellent, as did I.

Was concerned about this as I was making it, was surprised at the results.  I love the fact of using french fries for a quick fix.  Will definitely make again, maybe using leftover turkey or chicken next time.  This recipe is a good base recipe....use different meat, different soup, different cheeses.  I loved this!  Thanks!

This recipe was so tasty.  I didn't find it soggy at all.  I did double layers of fries, broccoli, and ham.  I also used seasoned wedge fries, eliminated the mayonnaise, and used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the parmesan.  You could also use pork sausage instead of ham.

My elderly father asked me to make a meal to serve his out of town guests. I chose this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand, and it looked like an easy, quick meal.

I'm so glad I chose it! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! After hearing their rave reviews, I made it for my family, to see if it really tasted that good! It did!!  I will be making this dish again and again! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My whole family loved it!! It was fairly cheap to make. It was one of the easiest  casseroles  I have ever tried to make. It will be one of my monthly meals that I make.

This was yummy!  I don't buy frozen french fries, so I used 4 potatoes, peeled and sliced thinly.  I placed the potatoes in the bottom of a buttered 9x13 pan and covered the pan with foil.  I then baked the potatoes at 375 for 30 mins.  While the potatoes were baking, I sauted 1/4 c. chopped onion in butter until soft and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the saute pan and cooked for 30 sec.  When the potatoes had cooked 30 mins., I removed them and layered them with the ham and broccoli, as directed.  I mixed the sauce as directed, but I also added 1 tsp of dijon mustard and the onions and garlic to the sauce before I poured it over the meat, potatoes, and broccoli.  I used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan.  After recovering the casserole with foil, I baked it an additional hour.  Delicious!

Very good!  Not sure why many people chose to alter the recipe?  Found the original recipe (though scaled it down a bit for 2 people) was excellent.  I precooked the french fries for about 10 min. in a 425 oven.  I also precooked the broccoli in the microwave for about 5 minutes.  Delicious and great alternative to scalloped potatoes and ham.

I used cooked egg noodles instead of french fries for the base.  Added 2 tsp champagne mustard to the liquid mixture, and steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen chopped.  This is a versatile recipe, don't be afraid to jazz it up!

This one is another keeper! I did make a few changes;
I par-boiled fresh potatoes with the skin on, thinly sliced them, 
sauteed a small onion. I layered everything in the baking dish
and seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder,
dried thyme and a dash of dried chipolte  to taste. Shredded cheddar cheese on the top and covered it with foil for the last half hour, total time: 90 minutes. Delicious!

I have a newborn, so quick comfort food is where it’s at. This fits the bill for me. My husband, who doesn’t care for ham usually, enjoyed it here. My toddler refused to eat it,,but she never eats anything but toast these days.

I made a mistake and used evaporated milk instead of using regular milk poured from the soup can (I assume that’s what the recipe means?) it didn’t turn out soupy, just casserole mushy. So I’ll probably continue to do that.

Changes I’ll do next time I make this:
1) add buttered bread crumbs to the top for texture
2) mix half the cheese in with the sauce. As it is, all the saltiness is at the top.
3) top the bottom layer with as many chunks of ham and broccoli as the pan can hold.
4) add onions

Other additions that might be good: Dijon mustard, hot sauce, and herbs. My husband also would have liked it as some kind of pasta bake. This will be on my list every time we have ham to use up.

A tasty way to use up leftover ham.  I didn't have any frozen vegetables so I improvised. Instead of the frozen vegetables, I used fresh sliced baby Yukon gold potatoes that I steamed in the microwave for 15 minutes and fresh chopped broccoli that I steamed in the microwaved for 5 minutes. I did not use canned milk, (didn't have that, either) I used regular 2% milk and only 1/2 cup. I added 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon garlic granules and 1/2 Tablespoon dried onion to the soup and milk mixture. I also combined 1 cup of Mexican cheese combo in with the soup mixture. (didn't have parmesan) I sprinkled on a little more cheese on top for the last five minutes. I will definitely make this again and try the original and all the variations suggested in the ratings. It seems to be a  very versatile recipe and can easily be adjusted to personal tastes and what is on hand. A relatively quick and easy way to use up leftovers.

I made this recipe because I was looking to use up some items we brought home from our camp freezer! I used frozen steak fries and a chunk of frozen smoked ham, added fresh broccoli cut into small pieces, and used sharp cheddar cheese. It was so easy to put together and was a great meal for a cold and windy night. I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this ! I’ve always made scalloped potatoes with cheese and cream of mushroom soup so when looking at this recipe I thought it looked familiar. The addition of broccoli ,kielbasa and garlic powder takes this dish way over the top ! I’m sorry I didn’t try exactly as written...not fair to Surelee ...but as a base recipe...this is amazing and I can’t thank you enough for submitting it ! I followed suggested modifications using thin sliced raw potatoes, didn’t thaw the broccoli and used a pound of extra sharp cheddar. It did take initial 35 mins.for potato/ onion and then an hour and half covered to finish.Be sure to Pam your pan ( clean up so much easier ) and next time I think I will use baked potatoes to cut the baking time. Great recipe ...wonderful combination of flavors  .

I made this recipe exactly as described.  It's a good basic recipe that was yummy, but a little soupy and not quite the amount of sauce that was needed for this amount of meat and vegetables.  I noticed that a majority of reviewers made changes to the original recipe, so I'll be rewriting the recipe before it goes into my meal rotation.

Very yummy :) I think I'll try it with seasoned french fries next time to give it a little kick. As for the cans of evaporated milk and cream of mushroom soup, I got a 12 oz can of the milk and a 10.5 oz can of the soup and it turned out great just like that. Also, I used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. A recipe you can really make your own :)

This is the first time I have altered the recipe before rating. I followed other suggestions and it was delicious. 1 lb potatoes peeled and sliced on bottom and cooked for 15 minutes. Steamed 1 lb fresh broccoli and added to 2 cups ham (2 small steaks), and the other ingredients including 1 c of cheddar instead of parm. Poured on top of potatoes and cooked another 30 mins until potatoes done. Yummy!

this is a great basic casserole recipe!.  I had never thought of frozen french fries in a casserole, but it got raves from my family.  It is easily adapted to any leftover poultry or ham and most vegetables.  Definitely a repeat for this household!

This was very good but salty which probably was the ham I used.  Very easy to make!!  I used cream of chicken soup as I don’t care for cream of mushroom.  Also I used frozen broccoli but it was not chopped up type.  It was more flowerettes. So I had to cook it almost 30 minutes longer so broccoli cooked.  It was still cold after the 40 minutes.

Made this with par-boiled sliced potatoes as the bottom layer. Delicious! Next time I will dust about 2 T. flour over the potatoes to help thicken the sauce.

I gave this 4 stars only because I walked away feeling hungry after a good sized helping. The taste was fantastic. I did bake the fries for 15 minutes before adding the rest. Next time I will double the broccoli so I don't have to feel guilty for eating more.

Made  it the same with some additions that I think went well: added 1 egg, garlic, and spices to the soup mixture, used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, added portabella mushroom, onion, and swiss cheese. So yummy!

Really good!  What's not to like about ham, potatoes with gravy/sauce, and broccoli.  The only thing I will try next time is using "Southern" style hash browns.  The French fry texture wasn't to my taste.  I used a reduced sodium ham from the deli, and there was plenty of salt flavor in this dish.  Thanks for a keeper!

Made this a few times, once for dinner and again for the church covered dish. It went over as a big hit both times! I did sub julliened potatoes for the fries and used cheddar in place of the parm. Added a bit of fresh minced garlic and 1/2 c of chopped onions. Really a great comfort food!

Super easy to make and really good. I used tator tots to cover the bottom of the pan, added a little more ham (bought a 16oz package of diced), 1/4 cup of chopped onions, halved the parmesan, and 1 cup of cheddar cheese. I make a broccoli casserole that is similar without the potatoes and the meat, that everyone loves.

very hearty casserole and a great way to use leftover shank ham! I did modify this a little bit - i used frozen tater tots, 2% milk, and added cheddar cheese to the topping. Delicious, satisfying meal!

I wasn't sure about this, but I took a chance.  My family is very picky.  I can't tell them the ingredients or they won't eat it.  Fortunately they didn't see me making it or I'm sure they wouldn't have eaten it.  But I liked it and they did as well.  I'm sure I may make it later but try using chicken.

I normally follow the recipes exactly, but I switched a few things like an earlier review had suggested. I used frozen tater tots (that I precooked some) and cheddar cheese instead. I also used more of everything to fill the casserole dish (minus the soup mixture, that stayed the same). It came out amazing  and my husband LOVED it. Definitely going to be using this for leftover ham. Might try adding cayenne next time.

I made this using Yukon gold potatoes.  These potatoes have such thin skins I didn't peel them but you could peel them if you like extra work.  Another plus to these unsung heroes of the potato world is that IMHO they're a bit "softer" than the regular russet potato and slice beautifully. I also substituted fat-free cream of mushroom soup, light mayonnaise and skim milk for the canned milk and cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan.   I had to bake it about an hour to get the potatoes done.  In spite of all the changes I feel it is fairly true to the spirit of the original recipe, just a "lighter" version.  I'll make it often!!

I used hash browns instead of fries. But I was really disappointed, it had very little flavor. Might try it with Dijon mustard next time.

I used scalloped potatoes on bottom that I cooked a bit prior to adding to pan. I thought there was not enough soup mixture to cook potatoes and broccoli so i added another can with 1/2 milk and it came out too watery ( although everything cooked)
I also added thinned carrots too. One dish for everything and easy to make and to adjust to your liking.

Wasn't impressed but can change some things and that may make it ok. The flavor was really lacking. Next time I will cook my potatoes and broccoli half way before baking. All the water from the frozen stuff made this way to runny.

My family loved it!! Even the pickiest of the bunch. Few changes to accommodate my pantry however I bet following exact instructions would be amazing too: used frozen tator tots instead, baked 3/4 of the way first. Added a small amount of frozen corn with the broccoli. Used chicken and mushroom soup and added liberal amounts of cheddar too along with a sprinkle of Parmesan.

My whole family loved this, which never happens! I used tater tots and pre baked them.   Wisked the soup, milk and mayo together seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Added diced ham, frozen broccoli and shredded cheese. Mixed everything together and poured over the tots. Baked for 40 mins at 350. Feeding my family WIN!!!! Thank you for sharing!

Made a few changes. I used seasoned french fries (baked them up ahead of time), added garlic powder and substituted cheddar cheese. My ham was really salty so it was a little salty because of that but overall good. I would use it again for left overs! My picky eaters ate it.

Great with some alterations: instead of ham, I used sausage, in which I sautéed the onions in prior to adding them. Used sour cream in place of mayo. I preferred to brown the diced potatoes in the oven first so they'd be slightly crunchier. Then serve with some spicy ketchup (or Sriracha) on the side!

I used hash browns instead of fries, Cream of Onion soup instead of Cream of Mushroom and cheddar instead of Parmesan cheese.  I was a little hesitant about adding the mayonnaise but I used it.  My friends gobbled it up.  Served it as an Easter morning brunch with date/nut bread, mixed fresh fruits and berries.  I'm planning on serving it again for Christmas morning brunch.  I love these types of recipes for brunch because I can make them the night before and just pop them in the oven the morning of the brunch.  I know they will fill up my guests and I can spend my creative side making special baked goods like nut breads or croissants.

I served this recipe for dinner to my family two nights ago. Everyone thought it tasted great. I followed the recipe exactly. For the can of milk I used evaporated. It doesn't say but I thought that's the type of canned milk that would go in a casserole. Lots of leftovers and they have been eaten for lunch. Very easy to make and we will have it again.

I changed up a few things with this recipe.  Instead of French fries, I used Simply Potatoes diced potatoes with onion (in the refrigerated section of the store), added some dill to the soup mixture, and used sharp shredded cheese instead of parmesan.  Not greasy at all!  Great comfort food and a wonderful change from chicken and beef.

So tasty and very easy. I did make a few changes thou. I used 3/4 bag of Tater Tots and Cream of Celery soup instead. Also added shredded colby & cheddar cheese and garlic and onion powder to the soup mixture. And on top sprinkled a light amount of shredded cheese w a spinkle of Paprika, Chives and Parsley. Great Meal and so quick to put together.

The whole family loved it.!  My children normally don't like cream sauces and they asked for it to be a re-do. I crumbled about a cup of corn flakes mixed them with a couple of tablespoons of butter and sprinkled on top. It gave it a nice crunch.

I love this recipe.  I use red potatoes that I have cut up, seasoned, and baked ahead of time.

I have also tried it with fresh broccoli and cauliflower.  Yum!

Great use of leftover ham. I cubed my own potatoes and mix them with a packet of ranch dressing. I also used frozen Normandy blend veggies. For the topping I mixed the parmesan cheese with Panko bread crumbs.

Everyone loved this recipe, and I loved that it was a whole meal in one dish. Very easy to make, and tastes great for any age. I did add a bit of garlic powder and minced onion and I used shredded lunch meat (sliced) instead of cubed. Thanks for a great recipe!

The picture does NOT do this justice!! I made this for my family of guys and they LOVED it! If you don't have French Fries on hand, do what I did and add/layer thinly sliced potatos on bottom of dish. I used fresh broccoli but either would have been fine! It was amazingly bubbly, creamy and so yummy I posted it on my FaceBook page for all my friends to try! Great job! I had an entire ham to devour and this made it easy! (guess Ham Salad is next!)

i tailored as others did by adding a tbsp of dijon mustard and some cheddar cheese  in the sauce. I had fresh brocolli that i steamed a bit and used potatoe julienned and boiled for a few minutes as everything else was cooked to save time. was delicious, will add to my favorites for sure!

We really liked this! I used crinkle cut ff, and pre-baked them, fresh broccoli, mushroom soup with roasted garlic, and cheddar cheese. Baked it for 50 min. Yum! My 4 year old even liked it, although he doused it with ketchup.

The whole family loved this, even the small kids! I made a few small changes. Based on another review I made the first layer mashed potatoes. Instead of frozen broccoli I used fresh raw broccoli and I also added a can of corn (drained). It was yummy and healthy since I used fat free evap milk and light mayo.

Good and easy meal.  Instead of using broccoli, I used mixed vegetables.  It turned out a little salty but there was nothing I could do about it since all the ingredients have plenty of salt.

This dish may not be the prettiest but it is certainly great tasting.  I used hash browns and pre-cooked them in the oven 5-7 minutes each side (while I was making the topping).  Added 3 tbsps. minced onions and used 3/4 (soup) can of skim milk.   I also decreased the parmesan to 1/2 cup but sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Over all excellent.

This was a hit with my husband! I liked it, but he seemed to love it! I didnt change the recipe, just doubled the amount for two casserole dishes. I gave the second dish to the local Mormon missionaries since they don't get home cooked meals often. We'll see what they think when they return the dish.

Did not have frozen ingredients on hand so used fresh instead. French fry-cut 2 large russet potatoes and used 2 cups fresh broccoli crowns; neither were cooked beforehand. Instead of mayonnaise, I used (1) 1.0 oz pack of Ranch Dressing powder and added 1/4 cup water to it. No Parmesan cheese; used sharp Cheddar cheese. Overall, the taste was godd but could have had more spunk so next time will try adding 1/4-1/2 cup chopped onions fried in bacon drippings. Thanks, Surelee, for sharing your recipe with us.

Great recipe to use my leftover spiral ham from the holidays.  I did use shredded hasbrown potatoes.  Next time I may add a little onion, was somewhat bland but with a little seasoning it will be perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very Yummy. Definitely will make again. I made some changes. Mine came out watery watery so next time I will do less milk. Instead of mayo I put about 1/8 c of Blue cheese Dressing. Used Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Added cracked pepper on top and seasoned salt. Very flavorful, very delicious.

The family liked this. I added 1 T dried onion and 1 T dijon mustard to the soup/milk, and omitted the mayonnaise. I also put the grated cheese right into the soup/milk, and poured over. I kind of expected the french fries to be crisper, they definitely were mushy but it was good nonetheless.

I omitted ham in this recipe to fit a vegetarian diet. I also used four idaho potatos instead of french fries. I microwaved the potatos for 20 minutes so it wouldn't take so long to cook. This was a very easy to prepare and it was quite tasty. If you omit the ham make sure you salt the dish.

I had leftover mashed potato, ham and a handful of fresh broccoli florets.  So I used an 8 inch square pan, layered the potato, cubed ham and minced up broccoli like the recipe states.  I had the evaporated milk but no soup, so I melted a tbsp butter, added a couple tbsp of flour and stirred in the milk- thickening the whole thing over some heat.  Oh, and for flavor I added a vegetable soup bouillon cube, salt & pepper.  I did NOT put in the mayo.  I then added to the top some grated med cheddar plus some parmesan (as I didn't have much of each).  Then I cooked it per the recipe.  It came out good!  I was pleased to use up leftovers in such a yummy way.  It was not too goopy, but definitely casserole consistency.  Kids liked it, hubby loved it.

This was great. I made it ahead and froze it unbaked. Then put in the oven frozen in the oven frozend on the moring that I was ready to have it. Set my oven to come on and bake before I came home from work. Yum! Tasty, hot meal when I walked in the door. My husband commented that he really liked it too. Didn't change anything.

This was so tasty and very easy to prepare!  I took some of the other suggestions and used hashbrown patties instead of french fries.  I popped them in the toaster to defrost them first.  I also combined all of the ingredients  and added a cup of cheddar cheese.  Baked it for 40 minutes then sprinkled with parmesean cheese and more cheddar.  I thought with the cream of mushroom soup it would taste like green bean casserole, but it didn't at all.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent! My husband and daughters loved the casserole but not the smell of the parmesan cheese.  I made a few changes, I am allergic to ham so used 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  I cooked and drained the broccolli after reading reviews that it was soupy.  Very filling!

We made with hash browns. While the flavors were very nice-especially the parmesan cheese flavor from the topping-the casserole came out cold (the broccoli mostly), and it was a bit soupy. We may try it again with either longer cook time or somehow thicken the sauce.

I made this using hash brown potatoes and fresh broccoli.  It was a little bit on the bland side, so next time will season the potatoes first.  We also found this a bit soupy, but still quite tasty.

Made this last night for the family and they loved it. But did use cheddar instead of parmesan (however its spelled) and tator tots instead of french fries. It's definitely a keeper.

I enjoyed this very much. I used potatoes and cut them and baked them for a while first (with seasoning. Added fresh steamed broccoli and then cubed ham. Added cheddar to the top. Nice and rich.

very good recipe.  I had to use garlic flavored broccoli and cauliflower vegetables though, as I had no just broccoli cuts, and I liked it tha way very much. It looked like it turned out like it should and it had great flavor.  

I also used a small can of evap milk(again because that's what I had)and used 2 percent milk to make up the difference.

I used hashbrowns, fresh steamed broccoli, cream of broccoli soup and cheddar since that is what I had on hand.  It was good, but not great.  I might make it again if a quick meal is needed.

very good.  I baked it for 50 min for the potatoes (I made my own french fries) to get done.  I also added shredded cheddar cheese on the top & cut back the parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup.

I was concerned that 40 minutes wasn't enough time to cook the frozen potatoes and broccoli, but since the casserole is not very deep it was not a problem.  We really enjoyed this all-in-one meal and I would make it again.  It would be good with chicken, or even tuna, and there is room for much variation with the soup used.

Excellent! Like some other reviewers, I used cream of broccoli soup instead of cream of mushroom. Also, since it's just my wife and me I used an 8x8 pan with just enough french fries and broccoli to make the layers. It was outstanding and a great way to use up the leftover Easter ham.
