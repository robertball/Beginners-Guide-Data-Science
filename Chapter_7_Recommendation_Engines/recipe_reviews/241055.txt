Very good! I added garlic powder and a little salt with the thyme and pepper.  I also added broccoli instead of peas as my husband doesn't like peas.

My husband did this while I cooked another dish. I thought maybe it tasted too lemony, and next time would try maybe a little heavier on the spices.

Really good. I left out the almonds but followed the recipe other than that.  Will make again.

Very simple rice to make. Tasty. I had never "roasted"? he rice with margarine/butter before adding fluids, it keeps the rice nice and clean and not sticky.

We really liked this. I am always looking for simple but interesting ways to prepare rice. We paired this with salmon and it was delicious. Super simple but great flavors!

Delicious and easy to make.  I love anything with peas in it so this was easy!  I served this as a side to a salmon dish and the hint of lemon flavor was just perfect!

Absolutely amazing dish. Simple and easy to make with great results. I used brown rice instead of white, and adjusted cooking times accordingly. I'm from the UK and thus don't have the specific brand of lemon juice to hand, so I used a generic brand one. Accidentally put in too much lemon, washing out some of the other flavours and giving it too much of a lemon kick overall, but that was on me and not the recipe. I know with a little less lemon next time the flavour combination will be amazing

Turned out great!  I changed the recipe a bit.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice, jasmine rice and 1/8 tsp of whole thyme and 1/8 tsp of turmeric.  I didn't add the peas or almonds.
