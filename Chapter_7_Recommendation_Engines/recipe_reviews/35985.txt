This is a good straight-on dish. Being from Texas, I eat and cook a fair amount of Tex-Mex, Mexican and Southwestern food. This is a comfort food type dish and works extremely well at that. I happened to have some cooked pintos and made my own refried beans. I also had some leftover smoked chicken that  I used. I cut back on the bell peppers a bit in deference to my 12 year-old's taste. It was great! I am sure it would have been as good had I stuck to the recipe completely. I will be doing variations of this recipe in the future. It's a fun one to play with not to mention eat!

Though this takes a little time to prepare, it is worth it. I did do a short by using packaged pre-coooked smoked chicken. I also cut the amount of refried beans by half...family preference, and used more ground beef. This is a hearty dish, that can feed quite a crowd. Be sure to let sit about 10 minutes, then it slices into nice size serving squares. You can have so much fun changing this recipe around each time you make it!

This is really, really good. More like a Mexican Lasagna than a pizza, in my opinion.  I did cut down on the red and green peppers as I felt it would be too much.  Also, I only had a 15oz can of refried beans, but this turned out to be great as I'm afraid it would've been to soggy with the called for amount of 30oz.    I also added sliced black olives because we like them.  The only other change I would make is serving it with guacamole along with the picante sauce.
A keeper, but be warned; this makes a lot! If you're feeding four or less, I'd halve it.  
Thanks for a terrific recipe!

My husband is not a fan of mexican food, however, he loved this!  This recipe is very easy to improvise when you don't have all the ingredients. Thank you!

This was OUTRAGEOUS!!  Not at all your typical pizza.  The flavors were suberb.  Prep time was longer than the 45 min. indicated but worth every minute.  I will do again!

Sorry - I did not really care for this.  It was not yucky, but just not great.

This thing is huge!!!  I used black beans and only green pepper but it was so yummy.  We topped it with tons of guacomole and even the three year old wanted more.  Next time I'll cut it in half and freeze the second portion.

This pizza was very good!!!!  I also cut back on the peppers for personal taste. I added a little bit of breakfast sausage and used dried red peppers for more heat. Well worth the time and effort.

This is a great recipe!  I had to omit a few things that I didn't have at home: peppers, chicken and some of the seasoning but it was still delicious.  I'm not sure why it's called a pizza, it seemed to taste a lot like enchiladas but is made like lasagna.  I only made two layers, that's all I had room for.  My husband now calls it 'tacosagna'.  It makes perfect leftovers! Thanks for the submission!!

I made this awhile good. It was good I thought kinda of tricky to put together if I remember right but I think it was because I used small wheat tortillas. This could feed an army, I condensed the recipe and made it not so big, I left out the whole chicken layer and it was delicious.

Super good but too much cheese. I added chorizo in place of chicken and it was delicious.

This is really really yummy. But it makes A LOT! I like to make things exactly as written the first time and decided to do the full amount so I could bring some to my grandparents and cousins. If your only cooking for 4 people expect a lot of left overs. Next time I will cut back on the cheese because there seems like too much. Its really quite delish though!

This pizza was delicious.  It looked good with extra green and red peppers on the top.  It would have been better with less sour cream and more chicken.

Really, really good. Takes some effort but is worth the work. Absolutely huge when made as instructed, you may want to scale it back unless you are feeding a crowd.

This one is awesome and well worth the effort it takes to assemble.  I added black olives to the second layer.  I also have no idea how you can get 3 layers out of this.  I did 2 layers and it was up to the top of the pan.  Regardless, it was VERY yummy and I will definitely make it again.

Soooo good for pizza.  I am not the biggest fan of pizza and this makes me want it.
