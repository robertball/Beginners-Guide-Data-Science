My son made most of this dish by himself, with me a relief cook just jumping in when he needed it. I asked him to increase the garlic in the sauce to a few more minced cloves. There were no other changes made. The sauce was simple and meant to not overpower the meatballs, which were obviously the star of this dish. My youngest boy was the only one who liked them. Everyone else thought they were oddly sweet and the grahams didn't pair well with the flavor of the parmesan. The graham flavor was really out of place with the homemade marinara. I appreciate the ease and playfulness of this dish and my son and I had fun making it together but it really wasn't a hit with all of us. I think the meatballs would have been better with a cream-based sauce (think swedish meatballs, maybe) or even as BBQ meatballs?

This was the first time I have ever made meatballs. I was intrigued by the use of graham cracker crumbs in this recipe and thought I would give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth texture and the flavor.  However, I was not overly impressed with the sauce. It was acceptable, but next time, I will probably use my own.

This was excellent. The sweetness from the graham crackers wasn't overpowering, but made this stand out.

My first thought was "hmmmmmmm...graham crackers...." ---- but the meatballs  were good!  Both boys (7,9) loved them.  Smooth taste.  I added chopped onions and cracked pepper.  ***  WALNUT size, stay consistent with the size   ****  Next time I will PRE-roll the meatballs so I can cook evenly.  I didn't make the sauce, so I am only rating the meatballs.(I use Paul Newman sockarooni)

Super tasty! Will definitely make these again. They seemed a bit mushy when making them but they turned out great.

Just made the meatballs:
I was worried they'd be too sweet, so I made sure to get plain graham crackers (NOT honey or cinnamon), used a bit more meat, some salt, pepper, minced onions, and some fresh basil in the meat mixture. It was great and had more of a hint of sweet than an overpowering, which definitely would have been the case if not for the changes I made. It smelled wonderful while baking, too.

My husband said these were the best meatballs I ever made, and I've made a lot of meatballs! I bet they would be good as an appetizer in cocktail sauce, too. thanks!

I used Cheese Itz instead of graham crackers cuz that's what I had and I found the consistency to be almost unmoldable. Maybe the graham crackers make the difference?? But I also used 16 oz of meat instead of the called for 8 oz so I dunno!  I also used Motzerella cheese (again, what was in the fridge) instead of parmesean.   All in all, they turned out very tasty ~ not pretty, but very good!  Thanks!

Always add at least 1 small can of tomato paste to the gravy. Makes a huge difference. Use Progresso Italian flavored bread crumbs.  Also, never add sugar to the gravy (sauce) just put in 2 to 4 baby carrots.  They add a little flavor, and sweetness (meaning they cut the acidity)  Lastly, simmer the meatballs (Don't over cook when frying; they will cook well in the gravy) for at least 1 hour to absorb the gravy.

I only made the meatballs. I used 16 oz of ground turkey and added a little chopped onion and salt and pepper. These were too sweet for my family. My husband said they tasted like "meat candy" which wasn't really a great thing. Maybe if you only use 1/2 cup per 16 oz meat, they would probably be good.

Loved the meatballs.  Smooth texture and good flavor slightly sweet but we liked it.  I definitely will make again.  Didn't make the sauce.  I had a jar and I was in a hurry.

My husband loved these! To me, they were a little "graham-crackery," I would maybe cut the graham down slightly and fill with a little breadcrumb... Overall they were delish! Definitely a great place to start for someone who's never made meatballs before (like myself).

i did not like the meatball flavor of graham cracker. This dish went largely uneaten by the kids and hubby (and me) and went in the trash after dinner was over. There was nothing redeeming about this recipe.

This didn't work in my house.  8oz of ground beef is not enough to feed 6 people as the recipe claims, so I tripled the ingredients, and thought I'd give it a chance.  Meatballs didn't taste quite right, and it was the graham crackers that were the culprit.  I think some tomato paste, and a little oregano would have helped the sauce some.

I liked the fresh flavour, but I would reduce the onion and chop it finer, add more liquid and more spice

this was an exceptionally tasty dish; the only change I madrhat I made was to add  a jar of extra chunky spaghetti sauce to make it thicker. The graham crackers made the taste very interesting & my family absolutely love it! Accompanied with a salad & garlic bread sticks...this will definitely go up as one of our family's  favorites. Thanks Rachael.

Meatballs were edible, but definitely not my favorite.  Liked the texture of them, but the taste was weird.  I'm sticking to bread crumbs or saltines next time - no more graham crackers!  They make the meatballs too sweet.
