This was such a FUN recipe to make!! Made it with my son and his friends last night -- and they're all in college!!! They loved the filling. I made my own frosting using 1/4 c confectioner's sugar, dash of vanilla, and 1/2 T water. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Fabulous crust! make sure chill the dough- makes all the difference in the flaky crumb. we subbed organic strawberry preserves for the filling & made icing for the top. These are even toastable at a low setting. They come out soft & melt in your mouth Delicious.

I found rolling the dough out to about 1/16"- 1/32" was the desired thickness for a actual pop tart. I also ended up needing about 1/2 c of water to get ingredients to incorporate.

this was my first pastry experience. The recipe was well written and made it easy. I made the pastry one night and simply cut and filled everything the next morning.

These tasted pretty good, but the dough was not the best. I made it exactly as written, and it was quite crumbly. I added a little more water, and it did come together eventually--though it was difficult to work with, and still kind of crumbly even with extra water. I thought that as it would bake, it would come together a little more, but it really didn't. It's still super crumbly and makes eating these pretty messy. The overall flavor is good, just too crumbly. If I made these again, I would probably use Chef John's pie crust recipe instead, and then make the pop tarts from there. I also filled mine with blueberry jam, and they tasted great.
