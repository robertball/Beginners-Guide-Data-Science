we really enjoyed this salad. it was a little labour intensive as i don't have a zoodler or what ever the gadget is to make zoodles. i did it by hand with a veggie peeler and a very sharp knife to cut the strands. very refreshing flavours. next time i will make the dressing way ahead of time to let the oregano infuse with the oil and perhaps add a little red wine vinegar for a little extra flavour! thanks for sharing your great recipe LilSnoo!

We LOVED this salad! I did reduce the oregano to 1/2 teaspoon, per our personal preference, and I didn't have kalamata olives on hand, so I subbed black olives, which worked out great. So fresh tasting! The whole family gobbled this up...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Don't change a thing - it's perfect as is! I made this tonight to pair with baked lemon chicken, and it was incredible. The longer it marinates in the dressing, the better. Per the recipe's recommendation, I used extra tomatoes as well as extra olives. Will make again!

Everyone in my family - including my 6 year old - loved this recipe.  It seems to release a lot of water once assembled.  Even over the course of our dinner, so maybe 20 minutes, the remaining salad in the serving bowl was swimming in liquid.  However, the flavor was really excellent.

I cooked my zoodles in boiling water for 3 minutes to soften them up and make them more pasta-like. I wish I left them cold though because they were a little too mushy. I also used black olives and diced tomatoes with basil and oregano. I will definitely try  making this again!

I made this today, used my Vegettie to make the noodles. Followed the recipe pretty close, although I only used one zucchini, and I did add some quartered cherry tomatoes. I like to make my own Greek salad dressing, but it's made with the same flavors called for in the recipe, oregano etc. I was a little nervous about this because I've never eaten zucchini raw before, but this was outstanding! I would think a person could just pour a little bottled Greek salad dressing on this if they wanted to. This was so good I could hardly stay out of it, DH tried it when he came home and loved it as well. Thanks for a low carb, healthy and easy salad.

Fantastic!  There is so much wonderful Greek flavors in this, I could eat it all day :) Please do not cook the noodles before hand, they are meant to stay raw and cold for a reason!  They do not have a raw uncooked flavor to them once you get them spiralized up and dressed in the dressing.  SO GOOOOOD!!

I typically make a recipe exactly as directed the first go round. That helps me know how to make it our own. In this case the dressing was too bland. I added a touch of red wine vinegar and granulated garlic. Next time I'll add fresh garlic.

A fresh, tasty salad that you just feel good about eating! I just bought a "Vegetti" and couldn't wait to try it out. I just happened to have all of the ingredients for this on-hand, and it was a nice side salad to our pizza margherita tonight. I'll be making this one all summer long!

This was just ok for us.  Although we cared for the dressing by itself, once it was on the salad it was only ok.  We may have again when we have a lot of zucchini to use.  It was pretty though when using the zoodler and super fans of zucchini will most likely love this salad.

This is so good.  Great way to use up veggie extras.  Made as written, except used fresh, chopped tomatoes.

Excellent!  I cut my zoodles early in the day.  Wrapped them in a towel and put them in the fridge.  Doing them this way eliminated all the excess water.  I used fresh oregano because I grow it in my garden and eliminated the feta because we don't care for it.  Otherwise the recipe was followed as written.  This one is a keeper!

Made this for the first time tonight and loved it!  After reading other reviews, I did cut my zucchini spirals into fork-manageable lengths, and I put it all together except the cheese about 2 hours ahead of time and kept it refrigerated & covered.  Tossed it again with the cheese just before serving - wonderful!  I don't care much for raw red onion, so I subbed 3 thinly-sliced scallions, white and green parts.  My husband isn't a big fan of lemon juice, so he thought the dressing a bit tart, but it didn't seem to keep him from eating it!!  I may try 1 T. lemon juice and 1T. red wine vinegar next time.  Also, I used a few more  kalamatas and tomatoes - maybe 15 of each, and about one and a half baby cukes.  Thanks for a great salad!!

Delicious! This recipe is a keeper and it’s a nice change from a regular Greek salad too. My only suggestion would be to use feta crumbles as opposed to cutting up the feta from a block. I used the block of feta and it’s moisture content was just a tad too high. I think the crumbles might not disintegrate into the salad as much. Great recipe and veg simple to make.

This is absolutely delicious!  My husband and I cleaned out the bowl in minutes.  I only changed a few things because of what I had on hand.  I used regular black olives and sun-dried tomatoes in herb oil. I love feta cheese so I sprinkled it liberally and I was not disappointed! My husband said that this will be the dish we take to family gatherings from now on and I completely agree. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

No changes except I didn't have red onions on hand; plus I buy calabasa squash because it is way cheaper than zucchini.  This recipe is such a healthy, delicious addition to my menus!  Even my grown son who turns his nose up on veggies ate the whole bowl sans my one portion!  Additionally, this is beautiful on the plate.  You MUST try this!

Excellent as is (do not cook the zucchini!). This recipe is perfect. I did add some garlic salt, but the kalamata olives and feta cheese were probably flavorful enough. Definitely cut the pile of spiralized zoodles in half to make it more manageable. I also dug the seeds out of the cucumber. Thanks for a flavorful salad!

I just got a spiral slicer to make zoodles and tried it out on this salad.  I also made zoodles out of the cucumbers too.  It was a nice and refreshing Greek salad.  Didn't miss the lettuce at all.

My husband made this salad to accompany grilled chicken and roasted potatoes, and it was WONDERFUL. If you love kalamata olives, tomatoes, and cucumbers you will make this salad again and again. It is fresh and perfect for summer.

This salad is almost perfect. After cutting your zucchini into zoodles, put them in a colander to drain while you cut up all the other ingredients. Then pat the zoodles dry with a paper towel and assemble your salad.  This one simple step will raise this recipe to 5 Stars.

I made this for dinner tonight and was not impressed with it at all.  I made it as directed only changes I did not use feta cheese as I don't care for it and I used plain black olives.  I love all the ingredients in this recipe, but not this recipe.  I will not make this again.

I used more of everything except for the zucchini and dressing since I served this as a main dish with hot crescent rolls.  Family loved it.  First time I used my spiralizer and was fun to use.  My first zoodle recipe was a hit.  Thank you for this.

I made it per the recipe and it was very good. The reason for the 4 stars is that the dressing lacked zip to me. Perfectly fine, and I would gladly eat it again, but I probably wouldn’t make for company.

With zucchini season around the corner, i was looking for more zoodle recipes, and this is the best by far.   My salad is usually a greek style so the ingredients were right up my alley.   I only used half the oregano and it seemed to have plenty of flavor.   I did put the dressing together earlier in the day so let the flavors mingle.   Don't dress it too soon before eating or you will end up with a soggy mess.   I tried to dry the zucchini and cucumber with paper towels, but still ended up with plenty of liquid at the end.   I drained it off and will have some for lunch tomorrow.   Waiting to see how that will hold up for day 2.   Thanks for sharing!

Great zoodle recipe! The combination of flavors was wonderful. I made it just as the recipe calls for but added chicken on top. It is perfect for a light, summer meal...not to mention health too!

Upon first reading this recipe, I thought raw zucchini?  Yuch!  But after reading a few reviews that said cooking it first makes it soggy, I tried the recipe just as written.  It was surprisingly good!  Cooking the zucchini is truly not necessary.  It's a refreshing salad I will make again.  But personal preference, I'll make more dressing next time.   Thanks for a fine recipe!

Excellent salad even without the delicious feta cheese. Needed it to be dairy free so eliminated the cheese but with it, it will be amazing. Simple, clean dressing that really soaks into the veggies and gives it just the right flavor.

I absolutely loved this salad! I did not have cucumbers but I see myself making this a lot come summer. The dressing was simple yet delicious with the feta. Next time I may add the zest of the lemon too. Delicious!

Soooooo good!  I did add sweet peppers only because I had so many of them and used regular black olives as I'm not a huge fan of the Kalamata ones.  I also added a little granulated garlic to the dressing and used Greek Seasoning instead of the oregano.  Perfect!  I'm having the leftovers for lunch!

Delicious.  I don't have a noodle maker so I used my mandolin to slice the zucchini then cut it into strips.  Worked just fine.  Love the flavor combination.

I left out the cucumbers, and added a bit of cavatappi pasta.  I put some dressing on the warm pasta so it would absorb better.  It is definitely a keeper.    It would be great with some grilled shrimp.  I served it with roasted lemon chicken.

I really liked this recipe.  Next time I will quick-cook the zoodles so they are more like noodles and not so crunchy.  I will also consider adding avocado and replacing oregano with dill.  I was able to buy the zoodles so didn’t need to find the tool make them!

As is, this is pretty bland. It definitely needs some more Italian herbs, use good olive oil and I added some shrimp for texture. Good place to start but you'll need to put  some flavor into it if you plan on serving it to other people.

Delicious! I opted to use real Feta cheese from Greece which gave it a more complex taste and really took the dish to the next level. Real feta cheese is from Greece and made with Sheep and Goats milk. It is miles away better than the domestic cows milk stuff. Everyone has their own favorite brand but if you've ever been to Greece you know Dodoni is the King of Feta cheese. Hope this helps!

Two "spiralized" zucchini seemed like too much, but I didn't want to waste any, so I simply doubled the other ingredients, more or less (didn't really measure), and the salad turned out perfect!

I made this last night along with turkey burgers and it was great. I didn't change a thing and everyone in the family loved it. I didn't have any issues with too much water but I prepared the salad early, about an hour before dinner, refrigerated it and didn't toss the dressing in until about 10-15 minutes before serving.

First time using my new spiralizer. Made as is - very good! I thought the olive oil taste was a little too strong - might use a lighter version next time but other than that, very enjoyable.

Just got a spiralizer and was looking for a good lunch recipe. This is really good! For a single serving lunch, I only used 1/2 a zucchini, 1/4 cucumber, and halved the other ingredients. i will definitely make this often.

Delicious!  I adjust quantities to suit my own tastes: more cucumber and tomato, less zucchini and olive oil.  It's fun to spiralize the cucumber as well as the zucchini.

It was my first time trying zoodles or raw zucchini and found that I prefer cooked zucchini. Overall, I do enjoy zucchini and squash whereas it's not my husband's choice of vegetable. However, my husband enjoyed the salad and preferred it over our typical grilled/roasted zucchini. The dressing was good. I made the recipe as written, but subbed the kalmata with some chopped black olives.

Made exactly as written.  I didn't think the quantity of dressing would be enough for the amount of zoodles I had, but it was perfect!!!  Every bite had flavor.  Great recipe!!!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!

I made this today for a client (I am a personal chef) and it was a WOW!

My client's do not eat cheese, so I substituted extra firm tofu that was pan-fried,and it was great!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe.  I did put more tomatoes, feta, and Greek olives than the recipe calls for.   It feed more than four.  Easily 6 servings so less calories.  I also liked that because of the dressing, you don't need to worry about  Summer's temperatures.

Simple and tasty. I used herbed goat cheese instead of feta because thats what was on hand, and that worked well, but the goat cheese sort of melted into the salad, so instead of chunks of cheese, the effect was of a creamy goat cheese dressing. Still yummy, but I think feta would be great. The zucchini and cucumber do give off some water, so if it sits a while it gets a little soggy at the bottom of the bowl. I have seen other recipes that recommend salting and draining the zucchini and cucumbers before combining, and I may try that next time.

Loved it~ Added more tomatos, olives and cheese than called for (because they're hella) and threw in a whole cucumber. Tastes similar to tobula, but that's to be expected with the ingredients.

Addictive!! This will steal the show at your next potluck.  It's so good, it makes you forget the other stuff on your plate. I'm serious. Make extra so your family won't fight over the last bits in the bowl. I added some radishes to the mix. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a great recipe except for the dressing.  I was not thrilled at all with the flavor.  I mixed olive oil, lemon juice, a bit of balsamic vinegar and just a touch of  oregano.  I got great reviews on the salad.  I still wish I could find a better dressing recipe though.  If anyone has one to recommend,  I'd love to hear about it!

12.22.15   What a fantastic adaptation of a traditional Greek salad.  I was expecting somebody to yell  “Opa.”  Wouldn’t change a thing, we cleaned our plates!
