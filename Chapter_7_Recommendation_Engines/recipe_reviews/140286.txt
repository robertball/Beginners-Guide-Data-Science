just wanted to make a comment.  I am a "natural" feeder as well and make all my own foods.  One VERY important thing to remember here is dogs do not chew their food 100 times before swallowing, therefore, it is extremely important to ensure veggies have been ground fine to ensure nutrients can be absorbed by their bodies. When swallowed in whole form, nutrients are locked in and will not release.  Also important to note many nutrients, minerals and vitamins come from different sources, therefore ensuring you alternate between ground and root vegetables, adding ground/powdered egg shells for calcium and different oils for the omega fatty acids is a must. Our dogs may look great now, but it is when they hit their older years we will see the affects of what we fed now. Also, soft foods will not promote healthy gums and teeth.  Therefore, feeding RAW (and I stress RAW) meating bones are also mandatory.  Cooked bones splinter.  Raw bones are what wolves and coyotes have been feeding from for thousands of years.  Good luck!  It is well worth the research and effort to know your dog is getting only the best.

I think this is a great basic recipe to add to.  I ususally double this recipe and make the following changes.  First I vary the meat each week, sometimes turkey, chicken, beef and occasionally some liver added.  I used 2 1/2 pounds of meat which is just a little more than the recipe calls for, but I also add 6 beaten eggs which I whirl into the boiling mix as it cooks.  I think variety is very important so I also change grains with each week.  I have used lentils, barley, brown rice or even oatmeal.  Make sure your garlic is cooked as raw garlic can make your dog sick, and never use onions as a vegetable as onions make them sick as well.  I use a variety of vegetables and mix and match them in each batch.  I don't use the gassy veggies like brocoli or cauliflower as my guys have tender tummies and all the gas just wouldn't be good.  I do use a mix of fresh and frozen veggies usually carrots, peas, green beans and squash.  It is very important to cook your grains well and also to whirl the veggies up in the blender since dogs have short intestinal tracks and can not digest these carbohydrates easily and won't get the nutrition that they need from them if they are left whole.  Make sure they get their calcium!  I save all my egg shells and rinse them out.  I bake them for 10 minutes in a 300 degree oven to get them nice and brittle, then blend them until they are powder.  I put a spoon of eggshell powder and a spoon of Omega supplement on each feeding.

Actually it IS a very healthy recipe.  No where does it say this is all your dog can eat. Like humans, we need different foods.I just spent hours this morning researching healthy foods to feed dogs.  This one pretty much sums it up. Again, not the ONLY thing to feed your pet.  But this won't hurt them either. It may be a little too much garlic.....a little garlic is very good, but not a lot. Vegetables are great but need to be pureed for the dog to be able to digest them.

This is a pretty good start, but you should add 1/2 Tablespoon kelp powder to it (unless your dog has hyperthyroidism), as well as 1-2 Tablespoons finely chopped garlic (yes, be sure to cook it). I just began cooking for my dog and have done a ton of research on it. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is critical to very the meat, grains, and veggies. (CORN IS NOT A VEGGIE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS YOUR GRAIN, EITHER.) Also, it is best to use ground meats sparingly. Using whole, fresh meats (with bones and skin) to be deboned after cooking is best that your dog can get some of its calcium, glucosamine, and chondroitin from the bones. As other reviewers have mentioned, the broccoli and cauliflower may cause gas in some dogs. Root vegetables (yams as well as carrots) are very important as well. Finally, definitely throw this is the blender! Use within 3-4 days. If you're looking for more info on cooking for your pet, get the book "The Whole Pet Diet" by Andi Brown and/or visit the website.

This is not a bad basic recipe, but there are a few things not addressed. I have been making my own pet foods for several years now, and while the protein to carbohydrate ratio in this is not bad, there are no organ meats to provide added essential nutrients (I would throw in a couple of chicken hearts and livers), there is no calcium source (a couple of tums with calcium would do), and no table salt to add iodine. Also, dogs do not chew as humans do, and their bodies will not break down vegetable matter as well as ours can, so all vegetables should be well pureed so that your dog can get the maximum nutritional value from it. It should also be noted that while many well cooked, pureed veggies are fine for your dog, onions, raisins, garlic, grapes, and even tomatoes should be avoided, because they contain naturally occurring ingredients that can cause various health problems in your pet.  I would also prefer to see a little more fat in this recipe for a normal weight dog, their bodies need more fat than ours do. My dog is on a 35% meat, 15% fat, 40% grain (always rice, corn and wheat are allergens) and about 10% vegetable matter diet, and he does very well. This recipe is good in principle, it just needs a few things added :)

My dog loved this!  I made very few changes. Instead of mixed veggies I used a couple of carrots that I grated and a half a bag of frozen french cut green beans that I minced.  I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and added 1 tbsp milk.  I boiled everything together uncovered until it nearly all the moisture was out.  I also added about 1/2 cup of leftover shredded chicken from our dinner last night!  I plan to make this often and change up the ingredients along with adding some bone meal.

I have a dachshund who has Cushing's and is also gluten intolerant so this is great due to the brown rice.  I don't add the rosemary but do add a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. turmeric since it is a natural anti-inflammatory.  I agree with other reviewers, its a good idea to puree your veggies - also real important to give some natural uncooked bones for healthy teeth and gums.

I have to say that this is what I have been feeding my guys for about a year,  and thankfully you are using a complex slow burning carbohydrate with the potential for a lower glycemic impact.  My one guy was a rescue and he is diabetic and allergic to almost every dog food there is.  I will say that the best veggies to use are chopped broccoli and various other chopped versions.  If I know what will happen with my guys they will chuck the other veggies on the floor first then go back so I chop even the most basic veggies.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I never though to add the seasoning till now n they both love me more for the garlic

I have 4 Chihuahuas and have made this recipe for them since there was a problem with commercial dog food containing melamine from China so it has been a long time.. I had started with a high quality dog food but did not want to risk feeding my babies something that would hurt them. My four are 12,10 and two at 8 years old and they love this. For convenience I buy rolls of frozen ground turkey, bags of frozen peas and carrots, brown rice and all bran cereal. I make sure I cook the ground turkey thoroughly and I blend the peas and carrots plus the cooked ground turkey in my food processor. I cook the brown rice in my rice cooker and then mix the meat and veggie mix together with the brown rice and all bran cereal. They each have 1/3 cup for breakfast and 1/3 cup for dinner.When they finish they get one chunk of a dental dog food I buy at the vets to help clean the soft food off their teeth. I do add a small spoon of a nutritional supplement to their evening meal that supplies any possible missed nutrients plus glucosmine. They are thriving and love this mix. Currently  I use three cups of rice to one pound of turkey but next time I plan on changing the ratio to two cups of rice to one pound of ground turkey.

Thank you! After much research, this is the recipe that I used to get started making dogfood for my two senior dogs. I have migrated to chicken - whole ones that I boil, debone, and grind. I cook the rice in the chicken broth, and the vegetables separately for longer than the package directions. When ready to assemble, I add canned pumpkin for fiber and yogurt for calcium. My dogs love it!

Warning to anyone using this recipe to feed their dogs long-term (more than 3 months)...this contains no calcium and is deficient in many vitamins and minerals. If you want to cook for your pet long-term, find a veterinary nutritionist.

I think this is a great recipe. But I have a tip. If you own a pressure cooker you can take the chicken bones that the meat was deboned from and cook for about 45 minutes to 60 minutes in the pressure cooker with the broth water from the chicken you cooked until you can crush between you fingers. The bones will be really soft and put in blender and blend into a liquid.  This way you get all the marrow and the calcium. Mix some of it in the dog food . gives great flavor too.

I eat this almost every day and am healthy as a horse.  All in the neighborhood are jealous that my owner feeds me this instead of that canned . Go make yourself something healthy, but keep feeding me this.  I love it!

good basic recipe but I would omit the cauliflower and broccoli. causes horrible gastric upset in dogs (as in gas). I cook fresh ground turkey, add brown rice, cooked chopped carrots and a 1 TBS of plain yogurt and 2 TBS of cottage cheese. My vet told me that cottage cheese and yogurt are great for dogs with upset stomachs. Also adding a touch of canned plain pumpkin (not the kind with spices) to their diet is very good too. Canned pumpkin also helps with constipation!

This recipe literally saved my chihuahua mix  dog, he suffered from a uti and cost us over $500! He had been fed a high quality dry dog food - after r3searching diets-I chose this one. I put all three dogs on it (one was a senior dog) and within a week or so - the changes were amazing-Melvin was urinating without pain and our old dog was able to start cllimbing the stairs again without our help.  My recipe goes like this :5 lbs cooked ground turkey, 5 lbs cooked, diced carrots, 4 cups brown rice, cooked. Mix all together-Lasts us about 5 days for all three dogs. I had to adjust amounts - more for the older, bigger dog and less for the two chihuahua mixes.. Substitue spinach, peas, broccoli, some oatmeal. Our vet was amazed at the difference - even though she was not sold on homedade dog food.

This recipe lacks calcium and vitamin D, both nutritional requirements for dogs. It is also deficient in canine vitamin E requirements.  A dog's digestive tract is very short, and the vegetables in this recipe should be ground in order for the dog to get the full nutritional benefit of the vegetables. Current thinking in canine nutrition is similar to people, in that dogs also benefit from DHA, which is in their mother's milk. Fish and fish oil are good sources of this. I would add some safflower oil, for vitamin E to this recipe, and some salmon oil for omega 3 fats and DHA. Additionally, some sardines would provide vitamin D. Some cottage cheese and/or yogurt would provide calcium. Another option for calcium would be bone meal.

My senior pooch loves this recipe (with a few additions).  She is a good eater, but has an allergy to beef that gives her seizures.  She adores all of the beta carotene veggies... Pumpkin, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash...  So I add a can of mashed sweet potatoes or pumpkin, blended veggies, and a teaspoon of garlic powder ground with a teaspoon of rosemary.  I brown either ground turkey or chicken, use 1 cup  brown rice and 1 cup oatmeal, 2 chicken bouillon cubes.   But here's the kicker, I put that all in my slow cooker with the 6 cups of water, on low, before bed.... in the morning I turn it up to high for 1/2 hour or so and add two eggs and eggshells as described by other reviewers.  Voila! Dog food for breakfast!  I just have to keep my husband out of it.  He he he

This food lacks so many nutrients! There is no calcium, no fats, no minerals to speak of.  This would be fine for a treat once in a while but as a daily food, it would leave your dogs malnourished and possibly lead to bone disorders.

This is a good basic pecipe to add to. First a lot of research has been made, since this recipe was written and reviewed, into the good/bad of garlic. It is fine for dogs. You just adding a small amount if you add it. I sprinkle a little on each meal.For calcium I give Cooper a spoonful of yogurt. He also gets 1 sardine per day. I use peas and carrots. For snacks he gets banana chips and plain popcorn. Also latest research.... Brown rice has more nutrients but it is not digestible in dogs so white rice is the better option because it is easily digested, just make sure you are cooking it very soft and dont drain rinse etc. Oh, and one more thing, do not use liver everyday. That is WAY to much iron. There is new research and tons of it. Use it.

This is a good recipe and a version of what I fed my dog. I used white rice, I use white and brown rice for the family as well. I didn't add the rosemary or other herbs but it's a great idea. My dobie lived 16 years and I'm convinced it was due to taking her off conventional dog food. I don't think y'all need to be such sticklers just get them off the company garbage. Like I said she lived to be 16 almost unheard of for a large Doberman Dog. Sabrina 1997 to May 22, 2013. I'm still grieving.

As with most people, I am getting more concerned with the quality of store bought food even if you buy high quality.  I make something like this recipe for my dogs every week.  I buy chicken legs on sale.  Bake them, remove all meat.  Make broth from bones and skin. Add finely chopped chicken meat, sweet potatoes and carrots to broth. Cook rice in broth. I give them half store bought food and half chicken and rice for each meal.  The dogs love it and it is healthier than 100% store bought food.  If I knew I could give them all the nutrients they needed in homemade food, I would totally eliminate store bought food and dog treats.

my dog loved this recipe...i cooked it twice as  long as it said because the water needed to absorb into the rice...i too use different meats...turkey, chicken, or fish and for veggies my dog likes sweet potatoes, carrots, and his favorite is pumpkin...i did notice that when i tried peas , he picked them out and put them in a neat little pile beside his bowl..lol..i have been making homemade dog food for  years with a recipe similar to this one, but this is so much easier...my vet recommended i add a tbsp of plain fat free yogurt or cottage cheese to make sure he gets the calcium he needs, so i add that to each serving right before i feed him...thanks for sharing your recipe

A couple people mentioned that they add garlic powder to the recipe, NEVER GIVE A DOG GARLIC! I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. Onions too, even in powdered form they are extremely TOXIC... to dogs.

I made this for my Golden Retreiver and he loved it!  I mix a few spoonsful into his dry food in the mornings, so he's not missing out on some of the missing nutrients like calcium.  So one batch of this lasts for a long time.  I freeze most of it in muffin tins so that I can defrost a little at a time.  For his evening meals I squirt a capsule of fish oil over his dry food.  This gives him a nice shiny healthy coat!

I love this recipe as a basic recipe. I've learned to use as lean as meat as possible. She (Leila, a chihuahua/dachsund mix), was vomiting solid hard kibble like chunks that reminded me of a piece of meat and fat. After realizing what it was, I stopped the cheap ground beef and am now buying the leaner beef or turkey. I vary the veggies just a bit too using green beans and carrots and sometimes spinach or other leafy greens. Blending them in the blender with a little water provides a minced texture that makes it easier for them to get the full nutritional value and digest. Then I add it to the meat and fiber; which I boil first. I also mix up the fiber by using brown rice and white mixed or lentils. Another idea for added protein is to add 2-3 eggs directly in the boiling water allowing them to cook the last few minutes. The only thing I'm really stuck on is getting enough calcium. The dark greens help a little, but I think she needs more. My cousin/veterinarian said to use calcium supplements. 

Anything for our canine companians right??? And that's my 2 cents....

Great basic recipe that I have been using for my German Shephards for years, who are tip top shape and very happy! I found that not only does it keep them pysically healthy but it also makes them calmer. My girl had anxiety that resumed with this homemade feeding protocole. I use this recipe as a foundation and try to vary the ingredients as often as possible. I slowcook it for a long time depending on the grain and veggies I use. I will sometimes add one or two of the following: yogourt, cottage cheese, sardines, lentils and fruits, such as pears, apples, peaches, bluberries and local beef hearts and liver, in small quantities. When upset tummies, I use white calrose rice as the grain, grated carrots and canned salmon or whitefish. I add bentonite clay and probiotics and it restores the tummy in no time without having to fast. I use local products as much as possible and try to use meat that is free range. I am thinking of starting to add a liquid children multi-vitamin, just to be on the safe side. All that I can say is that my babies are better fed than myself!!!

Good recipe. I started making my dogs food 4 years ago. I went the raw route. I like everyone's comments. I've done the research too. I finally invested in a powerful grinder. I wanted to stress the calcium that has to be added. The egg shells are great and I still add them when they eat beef etc when I can't grind the bones of most poltry and rabit. They all get raw meaty bones, fish oil, prozyme, kelp, and ester c. I very the ground vegetables. Cale and collard greens are high on the list. Carrots, apples, blueberries, cranberries, greenbeans.  I also switch back and forth between brown rice and Quinoa. The toxic foods were already mentioned. Thanks.

My dog loves this recipe. I take the veggies and the drippings from the pan (from browning the ground turkey in a bit of olive oil) and puree them with roughly 2 egg shells per recipe (for calcium.) I cook the rice separately, and stir all the ingredients together in the end. I've done a ton of research, and as stated before, this is a great base. You could do this with beef, chicken, venison, or lamb as well.

I found this recipe 2 yrs ago & have modified it, now using frozen chicken breasts which are easier to cook than turkey plus is lower in fat.  I eliminated cauliflower & broccoli, use only green beans & carrots.  I make it with 2-3 pounds of chicken breasts, one cup brown rice and 20 oz. veggies, grinding cooked chicken & veggies in processor.  Our vet recommended modifying the ratio for more meat and less grain.  I freeze it in 2-cup bowls; each lasts about 4 days.  I feed my 14-lb dog about 1/2 cup a day plus 1/2 cup kibbles.  He was overweight 2 years ago & has lost down to a desirable weight for his size now.  He loves this mix, turns up his nose at commercial canned food, so it must be good.

This is a good base. I make it with different meat for each batch. Once I will use lean ground beef, another time I will some kind of fish (easy to research whats good for your pup) and then another time Ill use turkey or chicken. I also add fruit like blueberrys and apples I also add egg, spinach other fresh veggies I just don't use frozen produce much). All  it takes is a bit of research to see what you should and shouldn't add to this great start! I can say since Ive started using this recipe, my dog who was on a special diet, still had skin problems, and was developing other allergies has completely started healing. Her skin is getting better her health issues are going away, small bumps and other things are all healing. I also fed a top brand pet food..so goes to show....good, all the way around!

My very fussy 12 yo shih tzu LOVED it and has had so much more energy. I add an egg and cottage cheese
(for calcium) and then place in food processor as she has not many teeth left. I keep in fridge and warm to room temp before feeding. So thankful to find a palatable recipe for her. 
I change up the meat for variety and once a week include organ meats for the iron. I have been buying ridiculously expensive tin foods from my vet and still had to coax her to eat. Not with this food she willingly gobbles it up and is healthier then she has ever been and I am spending less. A win-win.
 Thank you for this recipe redgirl !!

I've never posted a recipe review, so it's pretty funny that my first one is a dog food recipe.  I have to say, my dog absolutely loves this, and it cured what I think was an allergic reaction to multiple organic and regular types of dog food.  My modifications:  I've substituted ground beef for the turkey, and oats for the rice, and she likes both combos.  I add 3 eggs, one egg shell very finely ground then strained (for calcium) and 3 Omega 3 tablets.  I sometimes use peas and carrots, sometimes a large squirt of catsup and a very tiny sprinkle of garlic.  She's so happy!

I think this is a really nice base recipe, but that tweaking it a little is a good idea. I stuck with the brown rice and ground turkey, but left out the rosemary, as I don't think it's necessary. For vegetables, I added diced sweet potatoes, which I boiled and then mashed afterward for easier consumption. For calcium, I added a couple spponfuls of fat-free, plain Greek yogurt. My 10 year old Chihuahua-Jack Russell mix went wild over this. You can also substitute the ground turkey for boiled chicken breast, which can be shredded after cooking.

Ok, so i cooked this recipe.  I added some Natural omega-3 fish oil.  I also added some dog vitamins to it to help balance it out and not have to feed it to him later in the day.  I am using fresh zucchini and squash along with a banana. I put a tablespoon of peanut butter, and some peas in it.  I added parsley to help with his breath.

 

Just to comment on other posts, you should never add GARLIC of any kind to your dogs food, it is very bad for them and is a poison to them. It causes gastrointestinal problems, and red blood cell damage can occur as a result of feeding garlic to pets!

I just started making my Rat Terrier his dog food and he's been healthy ever since. I put a couple boneless chicken breasts, a lb of baby carrots in a slow cooker w/ a lot of water and cook all day. The last hour I add frozen green peas and brown and white rice. (No seasonings, herbs, or spices). When it's done it's like Chicken Stew. I freeze individual servings and remove from freezer daily. My dog loves it. It's easy for me too.

I make something similar to this, however, I use chicken livers instead.  I boil the livers and chop them finely and use a rice steamer for the rice.  Once the rice is done, I add in the frozen peas and carrots and let them warm through.  I mix the liver, rice, veggies and broth together.  Once cooled I put them in freezer bags and freeze until I need it for the pups.   So easy.

I love making dog food for my pets. I have used basically this recipe baked not boiled. However, I refuse to add garlic. Garlic is toxic to dogs as is onion.  Give any dog enough garlic, especially on a daily basis, it will kill them.  I give a prescription tablet for fleas from my vet to my dogs.  My vet said the food is healthy and DO NOT EVER GIVE A DOG GARLIC! three stars because of the garlic

I have tried this recipe also I love it and my dog loves it. I feed him the raw and dry also. I changed a couple of things. I took 12 eggs blended them up with shell. I pureed two packs of mixed frozen vegetables. I also added some liver and gizzards which I pureed.I used lentils instead or rice its healthier. I added more ground meat i use 2 lbs of ground meat. I also added 2 cups of hulled hemp seed.  Hemp seed is wonderful for humans and dogs.

Recipe looks good, in regards to some of the comments, garlic is a no no for dogs (along with onions, raisins, grapes and of course chocolate).

Just made this for my Great Dane and Chow puppies & they loved it!! They are currently passed out on the tile with full bellies:)) 
I've really been wanting to try something like this because they both have such sensitive stomachs.. So I was thrilled to find this recipe. So I made a double batch and it cost me around $8 for everything, it made about 16 cups and I will be only feeding them each 2 cups a day. So it should last me for 4 days. Let me stop there and let you all know how amazing that is considering the prices of dog food, if you get the good brands -I've tried them all and spent $$$$ on stuff that just didnt agree with my pups stomachs. Anyhow I did decide to change a few things, I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and 2cups of fresh carrots, squash, and peas mix, 6 lg eggs, and 4 cups of rice and the rosemary that the original recipe included, I did find that next time I will probably cook it all separate to save time and then combine them after.
Thanks again for the recipe, definitely will be feeding my babies homemade food from now on!

I would change a few things because this is not really a balanced diet as it lacks calcium. I vary the protein source each week and add calcium, yogurt or cottage cheese, (or make sure your giving a good multi vitamin). I also add spinach and/or apples on occasion.

I just started making dog food because we tried to upgrade our dog food and he quite eatting and wouldn't eat his old brand.  Was I happy when he ate and carried his empty dish around the house!  I learned many good tips and will try roasting egg shells and grind them to a powder for calicum.  I have not ground the veggies but will in the future. Who knew dogs have small intestines? Bone meal and punkin were good suggestions. I have been picking dandeline leaves and adding that in the pot. I did celery too and my husband wants to know why the dog is fed better then he is!  Thank you for all the good tips.  I have one for you, when I told my vet the dog spits out his pills she told me to wrap it in sandwish cheese and he won't even know he ate it.  I doubted she was right but she was.  the dog needs calicum cottage cheese and yogart will work for that but fish oil or vitimens will be wrapped and gobbled up for sure.

My Airedale suffered from a full body yeast infection and was lethargic. I was using the Wellness brand dog food because my vet told me she was allergic to gluten. The new food didn't really work. I found this recipe and I have been making it for 6 weeks, Sophie is a new dog.

I was searching online for some home cooked healthy dog food. My Siberian Husky mix is now 13 years old, has bad hips (can't walk on tile anymore) and also has cancer. I was told she had 6 months to 1 year maybe longer depending on the tumor and how fast it grows/affects her. She is on a pain pill, anti inflammatory and also a liver supp. Up until about 5 months ago she was eating fine but then she would go days without eating the expensive holistic dog food I know she loves. So recently I started feeding her chicken, cheeseburgers, pizza, anything to get her to eat. This recipe gets her to eat without FAIL! She eats down the veggies too. I do think like other people have said that you can change it up a bit if you want to add egg shells or even a vitamin supp but this is a easy basic recipe that can be made in about 15 to 20 minutes.

An extra note: Rosemary is widely regarded by herbalists as a natural stimulant, fine for most dogs, it is often suggested that it should not be given to epileptic dogs as it may increase the incidence or severity of seizures. Kelp would be a great addition as well as egg and the shells ground up for "natural" calcium not chemical. I also found dogs with colitis (greenish poop) have a hard time with the rice so I have been feeding one of my girls a 50/50 mixture of yellow sweet potato (not yam) and regular potato. I have been making my own dogs food as well and I think variey is also the best choice.  :)

I some times wonder what has happen to common sense in people.  Most people do feed their dog dry food (kibble) which will include various vitamins and good nutrition.  I know my little dog eats mostly kibble that contains all the nutrients he really needs.  However, he does eat wet food each day and it's mostly what I cook for him.  He is a small maltese and he doesn't eat much.  He does not like the can foods on the market and many of the can/wet foods in stores, are junk.  I think as long as you're feeding your dog a healthy kibble daily and topping with a little wet food such as this recipe, your dog will be fine.  I don't add garlic, tomatoes, rosemary and the various spices when I cook foods for my dog.

This is the first time making food for my dogs. I have been using store bought food and this year they both have been breaking out pretty badly that I have been having to give them benadryl. My parents both suggested that I start making their food and I found this recipe to try. The only thing that I added to this recipe was some beaten eggs for the added calcium. I also used chicken livers instead of the ground turkey for the iron content. it is cooling right now and my dogs can't wait to try it; they have been following me around into the kitchen because they smell food. My husband even said that if the dogs won't at it that he would because it smelled good. I sure hope this works out much better for my dogs because I feel bad for them with all of the itchy bumps they have developed. All in all, this was a very easy recipe to make and smells very good. Right now it is a little soupy but I hope that as it cools some of the water will be absorbed.

This is a great basic recipie and that is what I have been looking for to know portions to add of each ingredient! Since I have 2 dogs, one eating 4 C a day and the other eating 2 C a day, I tripled this recipe and froze what I would not use in 3 days.  I also cook seperate and add Yams finely broken up. I also add just before feeding a scoop of Ultimate Canine Health Formula.

I tasted this and it's delicious.  No wonder my two dogs scarfed it down. I used my potato masher to break up the ground turkey in the liquid.  I substituted rice milk for some of the water because the brand I buy has calcium in it.  I also added eggs with omega-3 and ground the egg shells and added them.  Next time I make it, I will vary the veggies as broccoli can irritate a dog's stomach.  Broccoli is good for dogs as long as they don't eat very much at one time.  I have read that broccoli should not be more than 10% of their daily food. I don't expect this one recipe to be all the nutrition my dogs need.  But it is an easy recipe with lots of good nutrition.  My two dogs are Bichons so this makes a lot of food for them.  I put it in the freezer in small containers.

Everybody should read Louries comment... there is not enough in this to make it worth doing. think Whole Foods, Natural foods~I pressure cook the entire turkey, less visibal fat. and save the liver for later addition. Add squash as a filler, think barley to lower calories (also not digestable~~like corn the next day :).) fills them up. Pumpkin is a great. Like you think color. Dogs eat not only meat, but the inside of the intestines too!...

I just made this today for my Golden. The only thing I modified: I used white rice instead of brown because lately research has shown it's easier for dogs to digest. One other thing I do for my homemade dog recipes is I boil rice in water with a few beef bouillon cubes (low sodium) just for added flavor. I feel this recipe needed it because it seemed a little carb heavy. Either way, great recipe, and I add a hard boiled egg (with shell) per day. One thing-I doubled the recipe and somehow only got 12 cups...not sure how that happened.

I have been making this recipe in my crock pot.  I will often put in chicken breasts or thighs...left over vegetables..brown rice..   Put all the ingredients in and let it cook all day with a bit of water.  The rice turns soft.  I always mix it with a high quality dry food to give them the nutrients.  They love it and my chubby one has lost weight on it!

My Bichon will be 15 in a few months and was having trouble digesting his food. I've given him this recipe the last 2 weeks and he hasn't thrown up or had loose stool since. I think this recipe saved his life! Yay! I've also read and taken the advice tips from the comments section. Thanks for posting.

This is the first time I have made this food for my beloved Border Collies.
They love it. They have been on a holistic brand of food for many years until
the price went through the roof. I am mixing this with the kibble and wow,
it's chow down time. They lick the bowl clean.

My Chihuahua is eating this food as I write this, and licking the dish clean. When I make this again I will double the meat - and I am actually thawing another pound of ground turkey now to cook separately and add to the original recipe. I might cut down the rice by a third or so. I also put mixed veggies in the blender and chopped them fine before adding them. He's a very picky eater, so I'm glad I found a basic recipe he likes. Thanks for posting.

Having rescued a very malnourished dog who does not like commercial dog food, I thought I would try to make my own.  This was the first recipe I tried and she loves it.  I do vary it depending on the ingredients I have on hand, and sometimes just make the rice and veggie mixture, then add canned chicken or poach a chicken breast in broth.  Make a batch once a week and put into separate ziplock bags for easy use.

I made this for Dolly our Mini Schnauzer and it is a keeper!  I froze some meals to be heated up later and will alternate veggies and grains.  I chopped all the veggies in the food processor. I also topped with a a half tsp of ground egg shells per serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wilbur loves it, I change lean meats from turkey to beef to kangaroo. Mixing grains incl brown rice to white to quinoa to barley, we also add in a soup mix that consists of lentils, split peas, barley. Carrot and Celery as well as other root veg added. I also add coconut oil at the end. Add it to his kibble. Going to try the eggshell in the oven for calcium. Thanks for recipe :)

My dogs love this food!  I sometimes add more veggies, whatever I have on hand.  Sometimes I switch the meat and use chicken thighs which I cook and then remove the bones.  I then add the thigh meat back into the broth, add the brown rice cooking again until the rice is done then stir in finely chopped veggies.  My dogs are also supplemented with Greek yogurt daily, and raw beef marrow bones a few times a week for additional benefits.  This recipe should not be the only food that a dog eats.  They need a variety of things like we do.

I have added eggs and ground up the shells for the calcium but I am concerned about the other nutrients my dogs are missing. I switch out the meats, using hamburger, leftover chicken. chicken livers (they like this the best but I don't want to give them too much) as well as cheap canned tuna.

I have a pom terrier mix who turned 3 yesterday :) I made this recipe right on time for his bday and he is a little bit overweight and I adore him and want to feed him fresh food plus he loves veggies and fruits!!! I give him 1/2 for breakfast and another 1/2 at dinner, and oh how he loves it. I followed the exact recipe and I think it will last 2 weeks which is great, I want to serve it fresh everyday. Bonus, pop each meal in the microwave for 16 seconds, my dog feels human :) Great recipe. Please add an easy and cheap recipe for treats please!!!

I have two min. poodles, both have some food allergies and the younger one is a VERY picky eater.  I've been going nuts trying to find foods that meet her allergy criteria that she will actually eat.
Not any more.  Both dogs really love this food.  After a few days my dog usually gets bored with any food, but not this time.  She really loves it and eats everything in her bowl.  I do put a spoonful of full fat yogurt on their food as well and I do augment the homemade food with some commercial food as well.

I give my dogs veggies all day every day. Even onions.. My dogs LOVE onions. I DO NOT however give them carrots because I had one that was deathly allergic to carrots so much that the vet thought she had parvo and wanted to put her down. I refused to let him and thank god I did cause she lived to be happy and healthy after she got better. I never gave her carrots again, and I dont want to go through that again, so I will never give another one of my dogs Carrots.. Also, Garlic is GOOD for them. It keeps fleas off them and its good for their heart. I give my 50lb dogs each a 1/2 of a garlic clove once a week. No fleas. I think you should just trial and error to see what is good for your dogs.. My lola loves broccoli but my Buddy and Vivian do not. When Im chopping up broccoli for our dinner, she comes running and sits beside me and eats the whole pieces that I drop to her. I have NEVER given them meat though, so if I try this recipe I will be stepping out of my comfort zone. I definately want to try it though with all the pet deaths and sicknesses going on from treats that are coming from China. I want to know what my furbabies are eating..

The garlic is not harmful in right amount for your dog.  It helps reduce parasites, inflammation and boost immune system.  Someone asked about the Rosemary.  It is in the herbal anti-inflammatory (Zyflammend) I give my dog, so it has anti-inflammatory properties.  Adding the eggshells, yogurt and a little pumpkin can improve the nutrition of this great-tasting recipe (yes, I tried it).  Although I was too lazy this time, boiling a whole chicken for added nutrition is also a good idea.  Marcy loves her new food- and it cost less than ALPO canned food!

I'm assuming the brown rice is already cooked?  I want the proportions to be right.  I bought some brown rice but it needs to be cooked longer than that....  So the rice is cooked but the ground turkey and veggies get cooked up in it?

My non finicky but older pit bulls loved it. They do have sensivite stomachs and being in their senior years, makes me want to spoil them even more. I used basic recipe 1st time, but the next time I used chicken livers and breasts. 2nd time was livers and ground turkey.  It didn't matter what the meat, they just loved it.  (hope they love me just as much!)

I have a very fussy Poochon he loves tinned food but it made his breath & coat smell awful, he will eat raw meat but needs other nutrients. I found this recipe today & tried it straight away using chicken breast & stock, white rice, cauliflower leaves, green beans, peas & a touch of herbs, he absolutely loved it & kept going back to lick the bowl. I will keep making this now experimenting with different veg & meat & adding supplements. Never thought I'd see the day when Oscar would eat veg & enjoy them!!!

I just made this dog food and let my dog try a little. She seems like and ate them all. Like some people said I did blend all the vegi. One of the reason is my dog is old she is almost 12. I am glad that I found this site and I think I will keep continue to made this dog food for my girl. Thank you!

The dog loves this.  I have made it three times.  I have cut the liquid in it each time.  4 cups of water is enough.

This is the first thing I could get my dog to really eat after an illness where she lost quite a bit of weight.  She's a 5 lb Yorkie, NOW.  Except I used a different veggie mix, as broccoli and cauliflower can build up toxicity in dogs, but maybe just raw.  I used a drained can of VegAll, drained, after cooking while still hot.

I do mine just a little differently, but my dog is tired of it and he needs coaxing to eat. We boil chicken breast, when the chicken is almost done we throw in a bag of rice (brown or white) we mix canned sweet potatoes, peas and carrots. Everything is put through the food chopper and refrigerated.

My dog loves this recipe!!!! Eating this food is the highlight of her day. I use mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas). She digests this food perfectly and never gets tired of it. I store some of it in the freezer for later use.

This is amazing! I have a little Chihuahua that has refused to eat dog food ever since I adopted her. The only thing she would ever eat was scraps from human food, or few select treats. I tried this out and SHE LOVES IT!!!! I have never seen her eat like this before and has so much more energy now! To anyone with a dog that is a finicky eater, I recommend trying this out!!!

Just food for thought: What dogs ate in the wild and what "nature" provided only needed to keep them alive long enough to reproduce. I doubt any of them lived to the old ages our pets manage. So much for the value of "natural" diets. Same goes for humans.

I made this for my 10 year old girl. She loved it! She spent as much time licking the dish clean as she did actually eating her meal. I will be feeding this all the time now due to more reports of harmful ingredients in more pet treats & food. Thank you for this great recipe!

My 2 chihuahuas love this recipe. I add vitimans & a vet. recommended fish oil every day.
Recipe calls for 2 cups of rice & I'm not sure if it means cooked or uncooked.

Have made two batches already for my chihuahua. Decided to do some homemade food for her when her anal glands had stopped up awhile back.  She hasn't had any problems since eating this, 1/4 C. every morning like clockwork.  I like that I can change up the meats, veggies, and such each time I make a batch! Thank you for this recipe!

This is a great, easy to cook recipe. Turkey is a favorite of his (and one of the only meats that doesn't upset his stomach), so I was very excited to see it as one of the main ingredients. I have a little 8lb yorkie, so I didn't include the veggies in the recipe, instead I mixed some jarred baby food veggies in with each serving. Obviously this isn't economical or necessary for large dogs though. I don't mean to add too many variations to an already wonderful recipe, but the 2nd time I made it, I used some chicken broth in place of the water to add a bit more flavor. Thank you to redgirl, this recipe has been very useful!

My black lab/ golden mix has allergies and I decided to try a more natural approach to see if it would help.  I use a pound of ground turkey, switch off between the white and brown rice and throw my veggies into the blender after cooking and before adding them to the mix.  I mix her dry dog food with equal parts of the homemade and she loves it.  Still gets her nutrients and crunch with a lot less scratching!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm basing my rating on ease of creation and how much my Jake likes it.  I read some of the other comments and altered the recipe slightly by adding chicken stock right at the point where the water had all been absorbed so that it maintained the flavor of the stock without it evaporing off too much.  I used some frozen mixed veggies that I boiled just to soften up and then chopped them in my little chopper so they weren't so bulky and would be easier to digest.  Jake looks happier and seems perkier than with the crummy store bought canned food, although this is 3 times the cost.  I'm happy knowing what he's eating and that he's happy to eat it.

I have been making this recipe for almost a year and my dog loves it. We would waste so much money on store bought food that he wouldn't eat. He enjoys this food so much that he literally licks the bowl clean.

Ran out of dog food this afternoon so quickly googled homemade dog food. My dog just loved it!! It was easy and I know all the ingredients she just had. I did cook the veggies and then used the blender but wow ... she just cleaned the bowl like there was no tomorrow. HA She definitely loved people food!

This is an excellent and healthy alternative to canned foods!  I do a lot of variations of this, usually using leftover meat so no cooking is involved. I also make sure to puree it in the blender to make it easier for my dog to digest.  You can also throw things in like garlic powder, nutritional yeast, brewers yeast, kelp, whatever.  My dog loves it and he's got a full soft coat and is brimming with good health.

This recipe is good base for home made dog food. It is is to tweak for the needs of different dogs or according to veterinarian recommendations. One thing that puzzled me was why the rosemary until I made it with out. It's to cover the odd smell of boiling meat. I also change around the meat and veggies.

I just tried making this and changed it up by adding an extra cup of brown rice and 1.5 boneless chicken breasts. I also put in some split peas to compliment the veggies. 

It made about 10 cups of wet dog food. I recommend putting them into smaller, freezable, containers unless you plan on using it all at one time. We will just keep dethawing the small containers from the freezer until we run out.

My dogs loved eating this on top of their dry dog food. This seems cheap, easy, and healthy. It's a no brainer. Next time I make a batch I plan on adding a few scrambled eggs.

Thank you for sharing. My vet as put my doggy on a basic homemade diet for a few days but I didn't think to ask the ratio! Thanks again! Jenny says, "Woof! Woof!" and gives it two paws up.

I just made this recipe for my dog who (for an unkown reason) did not eat much of his regular dog food for a day & half.  It made me so happy to see that he absolutely loved this!  I mixed it about half & half with his dry dog food and he loved it!  I also boiled chicken breasts instead of the turkey.  I will continue to use this recipe and modify it for different instances, but this is a great base to start off from.  Thank you very much for adding this recipe.  TIP: I put all finished ingredients in my food processor until minced texture.

So I read the recipe and the reviews. And I couldn't understand why everyone uses the Dutch  Oven. So I browned the ground turkey in a skillet with some dried rosemary and turmeric. Cooked the brown rice in the microwave. And roasted about a third of a bag of frozen Normandy mix veggies. Once the veggies were cooked until soft, I put them in my nutribullet. Mixed the cooked  ground turkey, steamed browned rice, and pureed roasted vegetables together. And voila! Tasty food for my dogs. And once the sweet potatoes come out of the oven I will let them cool and add them to the mix. The boys love their sweet potato!! :-P

Both of my dogs loved it, but it gave my Great Dane heartburn. It smelled really bad, but that was likely just the homemade bone broth I used in place of chicken broth and it would be well worth the smell if my dog could digest it better. I would recommend checking with your vet before changing to homemade dog food, I plan to before I try again.

I have Yorkies so picky they would go hungry several days rather than eat dry kibble dog food. I tried lots of other remedies, but this recipe did the trick! I added sweet potato and spinach to on batch! The pickiest one cleans his bowl every time. I'm anxious to know the weight he ha gained. I highly recommend this as it got them to eat the kibble too!

We were running low on kibble and I thought Iâd give this a try with a few modifications in the InstaPot . I threw all the ingredients in 3 chicken thighs, 2 c brown rice, 2 c water, 2 red potatoes, 1 apple, 1 red bell pepper, and 1/2 c carrots. I cooked it in the InstaPot for 20 min on high pressure and let it naturally release. I then blended half of the contents at a time with 2 eggs in each blended batch.
I cooked the egg shells at 300 degrees for 10 min and ground them into powder to add to the dog food  as suggested by another fabulous reviewer.
My dogs loved it and I donât feel pressured to go to the store to get kibble as the remaining wet dog food will last for another couple days for my 2 medium sized dogs.

My Standard Poodle is 11 years old and decided she did not want her dog food anymore after surgery to have a cyst removed. So I made this recipe doubled and added one pound pressure cooked mashed carrots, 6 beaten eggs and I add in cottage cheese for extra protein & calcium just before serving. I give her 2 cups twice a day as she is 40 pounds. So far she loves it thank goodness because double the recipe makes lots.

Pleeeease omit the rosemary if you have a dog with a seizure disorder.  Some research has shown that it can make seizures worse (you can look this up online).

Made it as directed. My dog loves it! I was feeding him one of the fresh food brands and he liked it but I noticed it sometimes would make him sick after eating it depending on the âflavorâ.  That does not happen at all with this food. Very glad I tried this recipe.

My golden doodle loves this first batch.  After reading reviews the only change I made was using carrots and peas instead of broccoli and cauliflower.  I precooked the carrots in microwave first to be tender.  Then both veggies were pureed in my Ninja.  Dog has never growled over protecting her food before until now so this is new and will need some correction.  :-)
As a followup my my review - I am a little concerned that this recipe does not meet all nutritional needs so I am continuing to research.

Our dogs got sick when the manufacturer of their food changed their ingredients; we tried other dog foods but they didn't do well. I found this recipe on line and tried it. What a difference! No more sick dogs, no more itchy dogs. After two months, both dogs are in gorgeous condition and their coats are sleek and silky. Many many thanks for sharing this. We use ground chicken or beef, and peas or green beans for the vegetable.

Thank you for a great basic recipe that is keeping my 14 year old dog interested in living. 
My old guy has merrily eaten his dry food forever...until he stopped. And then he wouldn't even take a bite. And that made me worry he was on his way out. So, I wanted a recipe that I could just use as an additive to his dry food, and this recipe has worked great.
I switch the meat every week (boiled chicken breast, ground turkey, shaved steak when it was on sale), a bit of chicken livers, sometimes eggs scrambled in the micro, mashed sweet potatoes, boiled and half-mashed carrots, boiled and half-mashed peas, and brown rice.
Oscar's coat has become soft as a silk and he literally prances when I am making up his meals. I couldn't ask for a better result.

i made it for the first time,I added blueberries.   I have 3 chihuahuas, two are 4 yrs. old and their baby is 6 mo. old
To me it seems like an awful amount of rice, a lot of starch ya think? I followed recipie exactly, it took over an hour for water to absorb, I added a few blueberries.  New food so the dogs were a little picky, we'll see. I have about 10 days of food

I'm a hero...to my dogs at least... We have two pups, one picky little Chihuahua, Belle (pictured) and one finicky senior rescue, Sebastian who has been quite ill. His recent medications made him lose his appetite for far too long. We tried all his favorites and nothing enticed him. This absolutely did the trick but for him and Belle. I made a couple of minor changes in an effort to avoid salt and onion. I used fresh carrots, baby food peas, added fresh chicken livers and oatmeal. Happy, happy pups! Thanks so much!!!

Love it, we add half a dozen eggs, and use 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of the chicken then add chunked chicken when done, we have a German Shepherd so she needs lots of protein.  She knows when Momma is cooking her casserole and lays down at my feet the whole time.

My dog loves it! I did make a few changes when it came to the cooking time. I would suggest cooking the rice (only a 1/2 cup) 15 to 20 minutes before adding other ingredients because it takes longer for rice to cook, then cook for another 30 minutes. I've also tried it with ground chicken and ground beef. I even changed the grain to quinoa  (which only takes 15-20 min to cook). I add 2 eggs to pot about 10 min before done and I use only a cup of peas and carrots that I grind in food processor. Thank you so much....before this recipe my dogs was a picky eater.
P.S. I add this mixture to his kibble with some baby food (sweet potato or pumpkin) mixed in.

Both my Multipoo and my Chow/Terrier love this dog food.  It is extremely healthy and tastes good too.  Humans should eat this well.  What I like about it is you can hide liquid vitamins, other supplements or Rx as prescribed by the Vet.  The rosemary is strong and can mask the smell some what.

My 1 year old GSD baby was spayed and decided that she was not happy just eating dry kibbles I tried to buy Petfresh and she liked it but I wasn't sure if I should keep her on it so I found this recipe and yep it's AWESOME she actually likes it better than the expensive Freshpet and she literally cleans her plate of kibbles and this 5+ recipe. THANK YOU FOR NIKKI'S GRAVY AND THE EXPENSIVE FRESHPET WILL NOT BE NEEDED IN MY HOME ruff ruff Nikki voted too.

I added chopped spinach and doubled the vegetables. I also used salmon instead of ground turkey and added 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil for added fat. We are going to add plain yogurt to this as well for added calcium. I read the reviews and noticed that the recipe lacks calcium, so I google calcium rich foods and spruced it up a bit!

I made this recipe and my dogs loved it. I am wondering if anyone knows approximately how many calories are in an 8oz portion in this mixture so I know how much to feed my 4 dogs, two are about 15 pounds, one is 8 pounds and the other is a giant Labradoodle that weighs a 100 pounds. 
Thx for anyone and everyoneâs help

Here's the thing - it's a good starter recipe if you add supplements to it (calcium, spirulina, vitamin E, cod liver oil, etc). On its own, fed over time, it would cause deficiencies in your dog. Also, with homemade dog food, you need variety!! That is why you are switching from boring old kibble to something fresh, so you can give your dog the same treatment you are giving yourself and your kids. Feed them a variety of proteins, organ meat (5% of protein), veggies, fruits, grains.

I made this for my dog. He's 19 months. To make sure he has all the proper vitamins &  nutrients he needs I added boiled skinless chicken, rice, peas and baby carrots to his already fresh pet chicken patty. He loves it. I put fresh green beans on the side(his favorite treat)

Very similar to one I make, but have been told dogs can't divest Brown rice...I use white. I also use potatoes and carrots & peas. Whatever you use..Homemade is better. I agree with other reviewer...some crunch is needed to help with teeth. Add some kibble.

I uesed this recipe a few years ago for my older dog Rio. 
she was diagnosed with a tumor on her liver and we were told to take her home and make her comfertable. My family decided to take a different path, this meal and some Milk Thistle for dogs and she stayed around 2 1/2 more years as opposed to the few days the vet gave. now  I make it for our Vizsla .

I have been wanting to make this for awhile. I made the rice in a rice cooker and then combined ingredients. Make sure veggies are soft and tender. I chopped them up in pan until they were close to ground. My dog (maltese) absolutely loves it! He is 13 pounds. I am transitioning him giving 1/6 a cup of dry and 1/3 cup of this recipe twice a day. So far no issues tolerating the change.

I made this for my 8 year old Golden who has become a picky eater!  He loves it, and devours it with his kibble.  I added some Wholistic Pet Organic supplement to make sure he was getting the right nutrients.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I followed the instructions to the letter (right now to the recommended Lundberg rice) and it was very watery, like soup.  I'm going to cook it longer and see if it doesn't help.

Easy recipe but please note that you can NOT cover while simmering, otherwise there's too much liquid when it's done.  I had to boil for awhile after I added veggies in order to get the consistency right.

I have been buying a can of dog food to split between my Cane Corso mastiffs (8yrs and 11 yrs old) each night, so that I could get them to eat the glucosamine tablets.  One dog was having allergic reaction to the food.  On SALE this food was costing me $6 week for 7 cans.  This recipe cost $1.90 for a week.  Just gave it to my dogs and they licked their bowls clean AND ate the tablets!  The only thing I did different was that I didn't have any frozen vegetables, but after the food was cooked, I drained and added one 15 oz can of mixed vegetables.  Would highly recommend!

I doubled this recipe because it sounded so good and a change from others I tried. It turned out like a thin soup, very watery. Not sure if that is how it is supposed to be, but very disappointed.  Hopefully they will  eat it over kibble. Feels like a waste of money right now.

I made mine with leftover roast turkey that I had frozen in slices.  I thawed it in the simmering water, then took it out and ground it in my food processor.  Then I ground some carrots and green peas (my dog's favorites) and added them to the pot.  I used approximately 1/2 c rice and 1/2 c quinoa, because that's what I had on hand.  I used a little salt and the rosemary.  I like that it came out a little "wet" because I need it to hide her medicine in.   She absolutely loves it, and I will be saving a fortune in canned dog food!  Thank you!

My dogs were super impressed!  One is picky, one is elderly, and one eats anything. Lol. I added a can of plain pumpkin, a can of sardines with oil, and some plain nonfat yogurt for calcium. I then placed some fresh blueberries that I had on top. That did not go over well and were spit out around the bowls and my cubby furbaby ran around and ate them all. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make and my 2 Maltipoo Dogs loved it!  I used fresh carrots instead of frozen and added a little bit of chicken broth to give it some flavor for them.  Will make again.

Tired of buying gross canned dog food but my senior dogs will not eat plain dry dog food.  This was super easy to make and cheaper than the canned food I was buying.  And the best part, the dogs love it.

The first batch I did as instructed.. put everything in one pot. But I found everything congealed into sort of a mush. But the second batch I made I steamed the meat, rice, and vegetables separately, then combined. It came out a better texture. Great recipe.. and the dogs love it.

I love how simple and basic this recipe is!! I served 1 cup (tweaking it down to 1/2cup for the future) and half of a diced honey crisp apple on the side. 

What do you serve your dog (serving size) and how many times a day do you serve your dog? 

I have a 10wk old American Pit Bull Terrier. (If that makes any differences for appetites and different breeds?)

Iâve made this for our two dogs.  Theyâre small and donât eat a lot so I freeze portions to keep on hand.  Also, I take the cooked mixture and process it in the food processor.  My sensitive yorkie has no issues digesting it.  I use it to supplement with their normal hard food.  Additionally, it comes in handy if I need to kennel them and they get stressed and donât want to eat.

I make something similar but your missing an essential ingredient a fatty acid. For those unfamiliar with canine health please read up on it. Corn or Walnut oil from what I have seen by nutritional resources.  Fish oil is not as good. The aforementioned are better.  IF you add this too your mix I didn't see it.

We make this recipe all the time and frequently substitute ground venison.   We use this as a supplement to high quality dry kibble.  It is absolutely loved by our collie/shepard mix, beagle, and our large boxer.  It has definitely "turned the clock back" for our 9 year old collie/shepard mix, BeeGee!

We recently got Dolly from a family member, she's been through a lot in her 1st year of life, we had a hard time getting her to eat her store bought food but she wanted table food. I looked online for a homemade dog food recipe and found this one. Dolly loves it, for now we're mixing in the store food until it's gone. Knowing exactly what's in it and nothing we wouldn't eat is great. We are going to change it up a bit with different meats, grains and veggies so she has a variety. This has been a God send.

We make this on a weekly basis for our two smaller dogs.  Typically we double the batch and freeze half.  Our dogs really love it!  We warm (microwave) a small bowl full for about thirty sec. before serving and will then mix in a small handful of dry kibble to give it a little crunch.

It's a good base that I've seen elsewhere. I would note to change cooking time based on the actual variety of brown rice you are using. Twenty minutes left me with uncooked rice, so I looked at the instructions on the bag of rice which said 40-50 minutes. If seen other varieties say 30 minutes. Unless there's a reason we want the rice to be partially uncooked?

Great basic recipe.  I add carrots and spinach and green beans.  Also, I fry the meat in coconut oil.  I shred the carrots in the food processor.  I also add a can of kidney beans.  My dog is old and is completely blind now.  I started fixing her meals when she was having trouble digesting dog food.  She has been doing great on this new diet!!  Her coat is shiny and she has more energy!!

I had a lab who at 10 years was diagnosed with a very bad liver.  She could no longer receive vaccines because she became so very sick from them.  I was told to put her down.  I began cooking chicken/rice/mixed veggies for her along with a canine vitamin and she live another happy, healthy 3 years (without any more vaccines).  I would add eggs and cottage cheese on occasion and she did just fine. Thanks for all the suggestions about varying the recipe with fish, sweet potatoes, liver, egg shell, lentils, etc.  I am going to begin to do this with my current 9 year old lab who is showing early signs of slowing down.  With all our modern appliances and freezers, this is an easy thing to do for your pet.

My husband and I followed the advice in the review by Andrea and have been switching out the meat, grain, and veggies in each batch we make. We have a 45 lb. pitt mix and we mix 1 cup of food from this recipe with a little over 1/2 cup of her kibble twice a day. When we did that our first batch lasted 4 1/2 days, or 9 feedings. The first time we made it she sniffed at her bowl and then looked back at me like she wanted to make sure we hadn't made a mistake and she was actually supposed to be eating people food instead of that nasty canned stuff we were giving her before. She always scarfs it down so we're glad that we've blended the veggies up really well first so she's not swallowing any big chunks whole. The dog is super happy with her new food and we're super happy to be able to feed her something that tastes good and is well balanced and good for her. (We've also been adding the roasted, ground up egg shells to get her some extra calcium). Couldn't be happier to have found this recipe!!

My picky dog who decided he didn't want to eat for a day, gobbled this up in no time flat. I could never get him to eat veggies or fruit, but this combination works. He gobbled it up in no time. I used turkey wings and pressure cooked them and pulled the meat off the bone. I will try ground turkey or beef next time. Will definitely add this to his rotation.

Great recipe! I am sure its tasty cause both my shepherds finished it off rather fast and were licking the bowl after being done. I did supplement with Vitamin A, Vitamin E, some vegetable oil and a scoop of Nupro Joint supplement.

In the future, I will add either Bone Meal powder or egg shell powder to this recipe as a calcium source.

Really don't car for this recipes as it can not be made with anything other then rice (tried making it with oatmeal) and unfortunately my baby girl can't have rice. So it turn out more like a mush
