My son was on the Ketogenic diet for a while for health reasons and since I do the cooking ;) we all were.  We lost a TON of weight and now we are doing a modified Atkins diet, this is an AMAZING addition to the menu.  Full of taste and such a healthy full bodied meal!  Thank you sooooo much for the recipe!

Made this as part of a ketogenic diet, and loved it! Puréed half of the broccoli to infuse flavor and give it more bulk.

Delicious!!! I started eating keto last month and am always looking for new recipes to try. I was a little hesitant about the canned chicken, but it really works well and doesn't end up tasting canned at all. Such a rich flavor to the soup.  I simmered it on the stove, covered over low heat for about 20 minutes instead of using a slow cooker. The only other comment I have is that this makes very small portions...I wouldn't say 16. More like 8.

This was absolutely amazing! I would DEFINITELY make it again. I did puree the broccoli  (texture preference for me) and I added some cayenne pepper and I used sharp velveeta and sharp shredded cheese as well as onion powder as that was what I had on hand. It. Was. Amazing.

One of my favorite low carb recipes. I normally add a little velveeta to make it creamier but with or without that it is very good. A satisfying meal!!

I made this as part of my ketogenic diet and it's awesome. The only things I did differently are 1) made this on the stove top. I broke the broccoli small and simmered it in the chicken broth about 10 minutes before adding HWC and cream cheese. 2) added about 2 cups extra cheddar so it was cheesy.  I don't think this took much more than 30 minutes, and the broccoli was falling apart. Yum!

This is a delicious low-carb soup. Next time, I might use my immersion blender to make it drinkable. Or use it for half the broccoli. Definitely would make it again.

My bride and I are on the keto diet. She returned to university for another degree so I do  a lot of the cooking. This soup is too easy and won for me lots of hugs. The only extra I did was steam the broccoli stems, puree them and add that to the soup.  Thought of adding xanthan gum as a thickener but didn't need to.  This soup is gonna be a regular for us this winter.

Was a personal chef for a couple who were on keto. They had me make a double batch of it EVERY week! For five weeks straight. Suffice it to say it’s a great recipe.

Soup has excellent flavor!  I didn't have any chicken so just made it w/o.  Also had to substitute half & half since didn't have any whipped heavy cream.  I also added potatoes to use some up.  Instead of onion flakes, I used fresh onions that I diced up, sautéed till soft and added to the recipe.  I also added more grated cheddar cheese, like two cups!!!  I made the 16 servings amount.   I myself had 3 small bowls it was that good!

SO delicious! My whole family loves this soup. It’s one of my most requested recipes. I don’t use the crock pot, I just simmer it on low for an hour or 2.

Just started a keto diet and looking for new recipes to try.  This was such a good soup.  I didn't have canned chicken but did have precooked chicken meatballs. I quartered them and added them.  I  used my food chopper on half the broccoli for the texture.  I didn't realize this was a slow cooker recipe until the end of the instructions but it turned out delicious on the stove top and very flavorful.  Definitely filling

Good but too milky for me. Doubled the cheese which didn’t seem to help. Doubt whether I’ll make it again.

I’m not very “good” at following recipes since I tend to make lots of substitutions based on what I have at hand and feel like putting in. For this recipe, I omitted the chicken and beef broth (I’m a pescatarian), as well as the whipping cream and onion flakes (didn’t have them). Instead of beef bouillon, I used vegetable bouillon, and instead of the cream, I used about a cup of tofu (mixed in a blender). I seasoned it with fresh-ground salt and pepper and after letting it simmer in a regular pot over stove for about an hour, I put it all in a blender and got a nice, even texture. I prefer a creamy texture to chunks in my “cream of blank” soups. Turned out yummy!

Good keto soup!  Texture a little different but the flavor is great. I omitted the chicken but added a little chopped ham before serving. Used frozen chopped broccoli.

This is soooo good! And filling too! I made this on the stovetop and omitted the chicken. I used a whisk to get the cream cheese smooth. Thank you for the recipe. This will be a regular part of my keto diet.

Great recipe! I threw everything but the HWC, broccoli (Frozen), chicken, and cheese in to my instant pot on sauté until cream cheese and butter was smooth. Once smooth, I tossed in the chicken and broccoli and pressure cooked for 13 minutes. After I released pressure, I put it back on “sauté” and tossed in the HWC & cheese (I used 1 cup). At no fault of the original recipe, my broccoli was mush which I did not want. I wanted it lightly steamed for this recipe. It was so mushy that it basically blended in with the liquids. To fix it, I just steamed some broccoli for a couple of minutes in the microwave and tossed it in! It was great! I ate 2 bowls myself and it was VERY filling. I added a little Parmesan and a little franks red hot sauce to mine :) . And while the canned chicken was good, especially if you are on a time crunch, I will probably use fresh chicken next time. Also, I made this scaled at the original recipe and I agree with other reviewers that it doesn’t make as much. My daughter and I ate 2 reasonable sized bowls each and there may be enough left for 3 bowls.

As is, this recipe is great! Good for keto dieters like myself.  I sometimes make myself a pot on Sunday for my lunches during the week. I do cook down some chopped sweet onion and fresh garlic in butter and add in rather than onion flakes and have tried adding velveeta as well. Yummy.

Really loved this soup.  Low carb and delicious.  Next time I am adding one-half extra on heavy crème and chicken stock.  I live my soups brothy and I lost some in the cooking.

This soup is rich and delicious as well as easy to make. I took suggestion from another and cooked the broccoli in the broth before adding cream cheese and butter and stirred to melt them. After adding the cream I took it off the heat and shredded the cheddar to add to it and stirred till incorporated. Start to finish was no longer than an hour on stove top and the broccoli still had a little crunch. Really enjoyed this recipe and thanks for posting

I eat a ketogenic diet and tried this recipe out in my Instapot.  The only changes to ingredients I made were adding some garlic, and I doubled the cheese.  And of course I added a tad of hot sauce to my own bowl! ;)  My daughter loved it and even came back for seconds!  Using the Instapot made it so quick and easy.  I set the Instapot on high for 15 minutes (likely could do less for more crisp broccoli) with all ingredients added, except the hwc and cheese.  After that was done, I sautéed for another 5 minutes, with the hwc and cheese added.  Perfect!

This soup is terrific!!! I made it for a birthday party for my brother, who’s on a keto diet, but this is perhaps the best soup recipe I’ve made. I was making it for a group of eight people, so I doubled the recipe; the quantity was perfect (enough for second helpings and a little left over). I used half & half instead of heavy whipping cream and more canned chicken and a little more cheddar than called for. I also added some black pepper, garlic powder, and ground red pepper to taste. I also added some salt because I used unsalted butter. Amazing soup! I will definitely make again!

This is very good. I like garlic so added some of that and a little black pepper. Instead of onion flakes are used a sautéed full white onion, I added a bit more broccoli but overall stuck right to the recipe. Very good!!

It’s turned out better than I expected. I used a whole diced onion instead of flakes and added 6 cloves or minced garlic. I will be making this again.

This is fantastic! And it's a great base. You can add your own taste to it. I used frozen broccoli and it has a bit of water in it when it is frozen solid, so I reduced the amount of liquid. I used 3 cups, 24 oz, of water and four chicken bouillon cubes. I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra cheddar cheese. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. Added some salt and pepper to taste, which for me was about a quarter teaspoon of salt and 1/8 of teaspoon of pepper. I let it simmer right on the stove. I have an electric stove and my two setting, out of 10, is about the same setting as low on a crock pot. I let it hang out on the stovetop for an hour and a half or so before taking out about 2 cups of the broccoli, giving it a rough chop, and adding it back to the soup. As mentioned in other reviews, it is slightly more runny than I prefer. Chopping some broccoli or otherwise blending it gives the soup a bit of body. Other thickening agents would work as well including xanthan gum and cornstarch. But, very good. I've been looking for a way to use the canned cooked chicken I got on sale at the grocery store. This was perfect. The kids asked for seconds! And it fit perfectly into my keto diet. Thanks for sharing!

I made a smaller batch at my first attempt ever making broccoli soup and it was great taste and smooth but could have been thicker.  I will make again and again and again.

The taste was rich and the texture was perfect; I didn't think homemade chedder broccoli could turn out this well, much less a low carb version. I broke the broccoli into especially small pieces so that it blended easily. The soup stores best if you avoid using the "keep warm" option on the slow cooker for a lengthy period of time.

Great flavor and easy to make! The serving amount is a little misleading, though. I made 8 servings according to the recipe which yielded 4 bowls of soup.
