wow never though i'd see this recipe in print. I'm from PA and my family are pa dutch and i grew up on this.  We make it a little differently, we make it with cabbage, sausage, onion and carrot (for color) dice all the veggies and mix with the sausage.  then stuff the stomache and bake for several hours until a sharp knife slides through easily. (we don't precook any of the veggies) add salt and pepper to taste as well.  wonderful food my whole family loves!

Wow! Not your typical recipe, but it is unbelievably good! You just have to get past the thought. I'm adventurous in the kitchen so I just had to try it!

I grew up in PA but I'm in the military now.  Every time I go home, I ask my grandmother to make this for me.  As a kid, I refused to eat it because of the name (Pig's Stomach) but the melt-in-your-mouth taste makes you ask for a second helping.  If you are from the PA Dutch area or adventurous, this is a definite keeper.  Try it and I'm sure you will love it.  We omit the salt when cooking it because it can be added later.  Serve with Shoo-fly Pie and you are cooking like the PA Dutch.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

My husband and I grew up on this as we are both from York, PA. Yummy! Recipe defers from family to family. I omit the cabbage because we never made it that way. I also use half ground beef and half bulk pork sausage and some diced onion. I don't pre-boil the potatoes, just mix it all together, stuff the maw (pig stomach), sew the opening closed and bake. The maw is no different than a sausage casing, but does impart a wonderful flavor to the filling.

I grew up in Maryland on this recipe and just about my favorite meal. However, my family does not like the cabbage in it. We prefer a nice cole slaw on the side. It's all a matter of personal taste.  Hence, only the 3 stars because of the cabbage, and, I love cabbage, just not in this recipe.

Thank you! My husband is PA Dutch(I'm not) and has been asking me to make this for a long time. I finally got the courage and this is good stuff! Not an easy recipe to find so thanks again.

I enjoyed this because I like hog maws, heck I like it all tail, ears, feet you get the picture.  However it was a tough sell to the rest of the family. I stuffed it with sausage, onions, cabbage, potato and carrots.

No one knew what I was talking about.  They all looked at me like I was crazy. God bless this web site now I can eat foods from grandma's cook book. I grew up on this food.

One night we were craving it and found this variant and decided to give it a try. It was godaweful. We called his mother and she gave us theirs. 
I highly recommend NOT cooking the potatoes first. Mix them uncooked with everything else. Leave on a low heat in the oven (about 240 degrees) for about 5-6 hours. This gives everything enough time to simmer  slowly. It also leaves time for the pig to cook thoroughly. 
Another variation is if you can't come across a pig (or the thought disgusts you), you can wrap it up in a tin foil-like log. 
Leave a little water on the bottom (with or without the pig) so nothing sticks to the pan and the juices tenderize the meat.

My mother in law made pig stomach for us and I have not had it since she passed 11 years ago.  So I need to know basics such as oven  temperature an bake time.  I sautéed onion, celery, diced potatoes and corn for ten minutes, stuffed the stomach, used the steel pins from my MIL and baked for 1.5 hours.  It was fantastic!  Almost as good as "moms!"

Very good. Only change I made is I used a baking bag because I couldn't get a pig's belly. But still very good. I had my first taste with my ex wife's family. Her grandmother made it and I loved it. This is exactly the same type of ingredients she used.

We do not add cabbage or sausage, instead only potatoes, a pork tenderloin cut in small pieces, onion and parsley plus salt and pepper. Make an extra park roast , this makes excellent gravy.

I'm Lancaster County, PA Dutch. Pig Stomach is widely loved here and surrounding counties. It's on of my all time personal favorite dishes, and I've eaten many foods here and globally. My family didn't use the cabbage. But, I know I'd love this version. Agreed, do not pre-boil the potatoes. And never, never overstuff the stomach. It'll explode in the oven! Bon appétit!

Just the fact that you used "cabbage" brought a tear to my eye.   However...Never, NEVER pre-cook the potatoes.  Low and slow in the oven for 5-7 hours -- Perfection.  Make sure you salt the potatoes well.   If you don't like the cabbage: YOU are just a poser
