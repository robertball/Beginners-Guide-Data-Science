I increased this recipe to serve 8 and think maybe something was not ajusted completely right.  The sauce seemed more like a brown sugar sauce than a caramel one. It was very sweet.  Everyone liked it, especially the kids (6). Just make sure that you use a pan big enough on the bottom to put all the dumplings in at one time to cook.  That way you will not have to reheat (bring to boil) the sauce a second time like I had to.

My mother made caramel dumplings when I was a child and they were the best. The result of this recipe does not compare. Corrections to consider- a well-seasoned cast iron skillet is a must (no exceptions), use white granulated sugar and brown it in the skillet (this takes practice and good timing), and try it with some butter-salted pan seared pecans on top. The crunch is nice and the salt with the sweet is nice.

I enjoyed the taste of this dish, but my hubby and kids hated it.  It wasn't difficult to make, but not what I would consider easy.  I'll make it again, when I get an urge for something very sweet and my kids aren't at home.

The dough turned out very dry and crumbly. On my second attempt I decreased the flour to 1 cup. The dough should be soft. The caramel sauce is awesome! Since most of the original sauce was absorbed by the dumplings, I made a little extra sauce to top individual servings. Serve while still warm. Toasted and or sugared pecans would be wonderful with these. If you like pancakes, you'll like these. Fun recipe!

It's quite possible that I did something wrong when making this recipe, but it turned out horribly. The sauce was watery and the "dumplings" were very hard.

This is very easy and good for a quick dessert. Simple idea and works well.
