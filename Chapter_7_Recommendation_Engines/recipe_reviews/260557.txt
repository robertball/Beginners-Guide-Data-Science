This is sooo good. The flavor is so rich and smoky it becomes a  unique protagonist for Taco day. I doubled the recipe and froze half. It’s not too spicy, so it’s perfect for the kids. I used a traditional pressure cooker (7 qt). I cooked the meat exactly 20 minutes after the whistle began and allowed the natural release, which only took about 10 minutes. It was tender enough to shred it with one fork. Thank you for the recipe.

Both hubby and I loved this recipe.   We saw it in Allrecipes magazine and thought it looked good but dont have an instant pot.  So made it in my old trusty crockpot.   I browned the pork cubes on the stove top first, deglazed the pan with some water (I didnt have any broth home, so just used water) and then added to the crockpot.    I also added extra garlic, pepper, and a couple of bay leaves to the crockpot.  Cooked on high until the pork shredded, about 3 1/2 hours.

The ancho sauce makes a lot, so would probably half  it next time.

Served on corn tortillas with crumbled queso cheese, mexican crema, cilantro, citrus pickled onions, thinly sliced cabbage and avocado slices.    Put sliced radishes and lime wedges on the side.  I think the pork would also be really good served over creamy polenta.

The citrus pickled red onions and queso really added a lot to the tacos.

To pickle the onions:   1 large red onion thinly sliced into half rounds.  2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar, juice of 1 lime,  heaping teaspoon of sugar, a couple shakes of ground pepper and salt

This was delicious. Just the right amount of heat. I prepared it in the pressure cooker per the recipe, added the chile sauce, then let it sit in the slowcooker so we could pick at it all day. Made excellent tostadas, tacos and taquitos. The next day I added honey and BBQ sauce and served it with mac & cheese...so good!

Delicious! Added about a teaspoon of salt. Next time will add additional garlic and cumin. We made tacos with the meat. A definite. Repeat.

Delicious, and so easy to make using a pressure cooker (I used my InstantPot). I wasn't sure if I needed to remove the seeds from the dried peppers, and I did remove them all (because I'm a spice wimp). I think I could have handled leaving a few of them in though, and will do that next time. We made tacos with this the night I made it, and today I'm using the left overs for tamales. Thanks bd.weld for the recipe!

Easy but lacks flavor. Recommend adding more herbs and spices of your choice to enhance flavor

This was the second thing I’ve made in my new instant pot...I only have a 3qt so I was afraid to add all the oj to it...my 4 oranges made so much juice. Very tasty...Would make great tacos/burritos.

I was disappointed,  the flavor was bland. I added red pepper flakes and taco seasoning
