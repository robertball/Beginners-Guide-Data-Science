Yummy! I made a double recipe for a potluck and the group *raved* about it!  It was definatey a popular choice for the attendees.

I doubled the recipe and followed it almost exactly except I baked the chicken in foil packets with a little oil and some celery.

I also reduced the amount of balsamic vinegar to 2 Tbsp. (for 3 1/2 pounds of chicken) and I didn't have any cranberries so I used 1/2 an apple.  I know, I know, it's not really Cranchick salad without the cranberries but it was SO GOOD the way I made it.  I'll definately make it again.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  I followed the recipe exactly except I prebaked the chicken in the oven (375 for 35mins).  I used light mayo.  Next time I'll cut down on the mayo just a little, maybe 3/4 cup.  That's just my preference.  This was an awesome lunch!  So pretty.  A great way to get some spinach too!  I had mine with quite a bit of spinach to "cut" the mayo a bit. EDIT:  Two years later, I still make this and get requests for the recipe ALL the time. Try it!

I make this all the time and the only change I make is raisins for cranberries.  Love this recipe because it's simple & delicious.  My only advice is make a big batch, enjoy for days and be sure to thank Deb!

I was surprised how wonderful this salad was!  My kids loved it.  It didn't look too appealing, so after I mixed it together I sprinkled more cranberries on top and whole walnuts.  It helped a bit.  My son likes the salad for sandwiches with pita bread, too.

Wow, I love this recipe! I have received so many compliments every time I have made it - it has now become a party staple and when I ask what to bring to a friend's, this is the request! The recipe is perfect as is, but for my personal taste, I add green apples and grapes. I also put less red onion.  I follow the advice of another reviewer and bake the chicken in the oven at 375 for 35 minutes with some olive oil, salt and pepper. Even with people having several helpings, the original recipe makes way more than 4 servings. I doubled the recipe for a party of 20+ people and there was still a lot left over (which is a great thing!).   I highly recommend this recipe!

This is one of the most delicios recipes I have ever tried on allrecipes. I recommend using Tyson All White Chicken in the can and Ocean Spray cranberries. Both are a little more expensive but keeps this recipe looking colorful and appetizing.

Wonderful recipe. The only minor change is I used white balsamic vinegar. I used this recipe for our wedding (gave it to the caterer). We got many compliments!

This salad was very delicious.  We added extra cranberries and put in some wonderful sweet red apple pieces.  Every flavor was balanced out and the balsamic vinegar really made it pop.  I would definately service this again.

This is the best chicken salad recipe I have ever tasted.  As for the color, it doesn't bother me.  It look about like tuna fish salad does.  I boiled the chicken while I chopped the other ingredients.  I don't think it would have tasted much different had I grilled it.

Replaced cranberries with chopped red grapes ; excellent.  The vinegar/lemon juice gives the salad a subtle kick..

I made this recipe this evening to give to a friend who just came out of the hospital. The salad tastes great. It looks, however, disgusting. The salad is a pasty mud colored mixture. I added extra cranberries and some apple, hoping to have distinguishable color, to no avail. I also used roasted chicken instead of the sauteed chicken breasts If you make this, be prepared for an off-color salad. I think I will try this again using white wine vinegar or tarragon vinegar instead of balsamic.

Definitely one to keep around!  I used 2 cans of chicken and added mayo a little at a time until it was the right consistency.  I didn't have any red onions on hand but am sure it would have been great.  I only did around a tablespoon of the Balsamic because I was afraid it would be too strong, but it wasn't really noticeable.  Next time I'll add more.
Nice Job Deb!

Love this salad! make it often and eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I like to use about 1/4 cup frozen concentrated orange juice in place of the vinegar.

This is exactly the chicken salad recipe I was looking for!  I cut the balsamic vinegar in half and it still gave a great taste without such a drab appearance (as was others' concern).  I also cut the mayo a little bit because I thought it was too moist.  But that is just my preference.  The taste is still perfect. Definitely five star recipe!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I just wanted to let the other reviewers and anyone who wants to try know that there is a white balsamic vinegar.  The flavor is a little different than regular balsamic but it will solve the color issue most people seem to have.

Wonderful blend of tart and sour tastes.  The celery and onion (I used a small shallot) add a nice crunch.

I made this for a group coming over and everyone loved it.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the color the balsamic vinegar turned it.  It didn't seem to bother anyone else.  They ate every bit and asked for the recipe.

Man, this is the best chicken salad I have ever made! Thank you so much for sharing! I didn't have any balsamic vinegar (which could have made this even better!) so I substituted red wine vinegar and about 1/2 tsp of sugar. YUM! UPDATE: I made this again and used the balsalmic vinegar and it did turn a funny color. It tasted awesome, but for better presentation I think I'll try finding the white balsalmic other reviews mentioned.

I suppose that it may not be fair to rate this so low, because I cut back on the mayonaise, as we don't like things so mayonaisey, but it just did not do much for our family. I liked the basic concept of cranberries, walnuts and chickens, but next time would replace the balsamic vinegar with mustard, and perhaps add some apples or grapes.

This was phenomenal, and on whole wheat bread, it was a truly filling and satisfying sandwich.  I used leftover chicken breast we'd grilled the day before so it took no time to prep.   Definitely a keeper!
