This is definitely your standard buttermilk pound cake and the classics never die! However, I added two more eggs to increase the moistness. I also used 2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp. of real lemon juice. I served this with fresh fruit and real whipped cream. Loved it!

The classic pound cake is this recipe but with two additional eggs.  The buttermilk typically can be swapped with a cup of sour cream or an 8 oz. package of cream cheese.  I was curious to see what the difference might be using four eggs rather than six, all other ingredients being the same.  It might have made a minor difference in richness and moisture, but you'd really have to be on high alert for it.  This cake rises tall provided you cream the butter and sugar well, add the eggs one at a time, and alternate the flour and buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour.  This was a lovely pound cake, with pure vanilla and butter flavor.  I served this with "Microwave Lemon Curd" and "Honey Fruit Salad," both recipes also from this site.

This cake is the TRUTH. I have never wrote a review before but this cake is sooo TASTY I had to.The only change I made was that I added almond extract like another reviewer. I put the caramel frosting from the caramel pound cake recipe (also on this site) over it and it was wonderful. This is an amazing cake!! I will be making this again and again.

I was in search for the perfect buttermilk pound cake and have been trying many recipes. This one was good but did not make the top of the list. It needed something with it - which if you're planning to serve it with some fruit, ice cream, or chocolaty sauce you should be fine.

Excellent pound cake, we all really enjoyed this. I used 1/2 tsp almond extract and a 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, the flavor was so very good. I used my bundt pan, and the baking time was a bit longer, I just kept a close eye on it. I used a basic powdered sugar, milk & vanilla glaze for this, it definitely could stand alone or just a dusting of powdered sugar. The texture and crumb of this cake is wonderful. I will use this very often, thanks for sharing :)

Excellent! This was my first time making pound cake. I did mess it up but that was my fault. My tube pan must be smaller than the normal size and I overfilled it. It went over all over my oven - but I was able to salvage it and it still tasted awesome. Next time I will make half a recipe though and I think that will be just enough for my pan size. The cake was moist not heavy at all and not too sweet. We topped ours with fresh strawberries and raspberries but you could do so many different variation of toppings with this one. Thanks so much for the recipe! UPDATE (12/25/19): Even the larger of my two bundt pans is not big enough to hold all of the batter. Only fill 2/3 full next time using the larger 10" bundt pan. Do not use Bake Easy (didn't release well). Next time grease and flour pan.

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  I wanted a dense pound cake- similar in texture and flavor to the store bought kind.  This was not too dense and for us, the 3 cups of sugar seemed to be too much.  I may tweak this and try again, but I think it can be improved upon as written.

This easy pound cake recipe makes a nice basic cake. Dress it up with whatever suits your fancy: chocolate glaze, strawberries,lemon or raspberry sauce. You'll get the best results when all ingredients are at room temperature.

Very good recipe. Not too sweet or too oily or too dense/heavy. Perfect base for ice cream or for other flavors (lemon, almond, orange), but also great on its own. Very tender - esp. if you use all or part cake flour (properly adjusted quantity).

I cater small parties and am a cake decorator and this is hands down one of the best pound cakes I've ever made. There's only one hiccup with this recipe; the top develops an almost cookie like crust as does the inside around the tube. I use the recipe as stated with no revisions and get the same result (cookie like crust) each time. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen or has any ideas on why it happens. I will continue to use this recipe cookie crust and all because the taste is great!

A fabulous pound cake - a bit bland though. It would be great as the main dessert accompanied by a "buffet" of toppings, sauces, and fruit. That is what I did, and it was an absolute smash! This cake tastes extraordinarily great with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Mmmmm!  Oh, and one more thing. I found that this is the perfect pound cake for trifle. It is soft, yet slightly firm, and to top it off, it absorbs "juice" well without becoming mushy. Yummy!

Made no changes to recipe.  There is way too much sugar in this cake!! Other than that, is was delicious - very tender. I would definately make this again, but would reduce the sugar.

This cake is delicious! Because of the comments about 4 eggs or 6 eggs, I used 5.  I used 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. orange extract.  You couldn't taste the orange, but it gave it the extra umph that it needed!! THank you!

It gets 5 stars just on the appearance.  When it comes out of the pan, this cake is so beautiful; a nice golden brown. The outside is very crunchy and I love that.  My boyfriend loved the flavor.

This was very easy to make and the texture was great, dense but still nice and moist. I thought it was a bit too sweet. I think next time I'll reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 cups.

MMMMM, excellent!  Made this over the weekend for my mom and dad's birthday dinner and it was fabulous!  I did cut back the sugar to 2 1/2 cups as well as using 1/2 tsp each vanilla and almond extract.  I decided to use the same 'icing' that I used over the Christmas holidays from Cranberry Orange Cookies found on this site.  Wonderful!  The icing has orange juice/zest, icing sugar as well as some almond extract I added to complement the cake.  YUMMY!

This cake had great texture and moistness.  As written I felt there was far too much sugar so I put 1 cup less sugar in mine.  As it turned out I felt it was STILL far too sweet.  Next time I make it I will use only 1 1/2 cup or less.  Other than the sweetness it was just perfect.

Love this recipe. I've this pound cake twice and both times it was a hit! The only changes I made was I omitted the baking soda and placed the cake pan into a cool oven. A cool oven is a must when baking cakes. Other than that, you can't go wrong with this cake. Enjoy!

Very sugar heavy cake! However the batter is a joy to work with.  I decided to lemon mine up and the batter was firm enough to put half in, level out, make an indentation with a teaspoon all the way round the middle and pipe in some lemon curd before sitting the remaining batter on top, smoothing down gently.  I also added the zest of a couple of lemons to the mix.  It looks and tastes amazing!

Very good pound cake.  I have made this at least 6 times in the last year.  I sub almond extract for the vanilla, simply because I love almond poundcake.  I also use softened butter to grease the pan, it gives it a delicious crust.  Very versatile recipe.

This cake is awesome! It came out so moist. I changed the sugar so that my mom (she is diabetic) could have a piece.  I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  My house is extremely dry so I increased the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups and sifted the flour before measuring. I put this cake in a bunt pan and a 8 inch layer pan.  So I got 2 cakes out of this recipe!

Very good and lighter (less dense) than regular pound cake.  I brought it to work and served fresh strawberries on the side and people raved about it.  Make sure you grease the bundt pan well.  I didn't and half of the top got left behind.  I may try adding some lemon extract next time to give it a little more zing.

This cake is so addicting I make it every two weeks. I used 5 eggs. So moist. If you don't have buttermilk, use sour milk. 

1 tbsp vinegar
Milk

Put vinegar into measuring cup and complete with milk to make 1 cup. Wait 5 minutes to use. It is still as good.

Yummy!  Had some buttermilk I needed to use up  so I decided to try this cake.  Boy, was I happy!  My family, too. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious cruchy top (or bottom, once it is out of the pan).  I did NOT think it was too sweet, as some other reviewers mentioned.  I followed the recipe exactly except my cake only needed to cook for 1 hour 5 min.  The adults had it with strawberries and whipped cream, the kids with chocolate ice cream.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This cake looked lovely and had a nice texture.  The problem is the taste which is very bland.  Even serving it with fresh berries and whipped cream didn't help it any.  I won't make it again.

I have made this several times now and the family loves it.  The directions are clear and easy.  Sprinkle powdered sugar on top if you want it sweeter.  It does have a different flavor the first bite (not exactly sour), after the second bite you love it.

I  have made this cake several times always with excellent reviews, most recently at our annual open house. I had baked in a tree shaped Bunt pan and then dusted it with confectioners sugar to look like snow. It was "too pretty to eat" as I was told, but once cut and served with some homemade preserves I had on the side the cake was gone in minutes. This is definely my "go to" recipe when I need to bring something sweet to the party.

I really liked this pound cake but I would add Salt. I tasted the batter before I put it in the oven and I realized it was really missing salt. I added 1/2 tsp salt and that was even with salted butter. Then it turned out lovely.

Just for kicks I added 1/2 tsp butter flavoring and 1/2 tsp almond extract which was a nice flavor boost, which I do to all my pound cakes. But that is a personal taste thing.

Really great pound cake.  I get great reviews on this cake whenever I take it anywhere.  It is one of the most requested items from my daughter's friends at college.  I have also used it in a layer form for a friend's wedding.  It was a huge success.  The only change I have made is to increase the heat to 335 to make sure that it is done all the way thru.  NEVER EVER substitute the butter with margarine or butter flavored Crisco.  Gave the recipe to a friend and she tried that.  It was a horrible decision.

This is just what I was looking for, lighter than regular pound cake, yet rich, moist & dense. I poked holes in it & glazed it with a thin lemon/powdered sugar mixture. The cake is better the next day & reminds me of an old fashioned buttermilk bar (doughnut) so good, we can't stop eating it!!! Also, it is a very easy recipe.

I baked this cake today and  it had a great flavor but was a bit too sweet. I also could have shaved off 10 minutes of baking time because it came out rather brown. I think I will use only 2.5 cups of sugar the next time i prepare this cake. I used large eggs that were more medium in size.... I will be baking this cake again in 2 weeks and would really like to know.

I have made this pound cake several times and it has been consistently perfect everytime.  We prefer a bit more vanilla and a bit of almond flavoring in pound cake and this one will be one of the best keepers!  I will always try new recipes, it's a hobby!  Thank you!

This is excellent!
I made it yesterday with some buttercream icing for my husband's office at work. I could smell it cooking the entire time. Everyone says it's great and commented on how my husband should "do this more often"
Excellent, excellent pound cake!

Wow, this is one of the best pound cakes I've ever tried! The flavor was magnificent and it had such a moist, fine crumb. I'm so surprised that it has so few reviews! The only problem I had with it was that is rose out of the pan, creating a hump on the top that wasn't so attractive...next time I make it, I will be put some of the batter in my small teacake pan so that the cake won't rise over the top. Thanks so much for sharing...this is one I will make again!!

This wasn't what I was hoping, I was looking for something sweeter, but we improvised and it made a fabulous base for a trifle.  It was the perfect texture and the sweetness went well with fruit and pudding.  YUM!

This cake is so moist and yummy! Would love it even more if it did not call for so much sugar. It also freezes well.

REALLY good but also really sweet, I would cut on the amount of sugar.

This was the BEST pound cake I've ever made. My family LOVED it! It was very easy to make. I especially liked the nice, delicate, sweet crunch the top of the cake had. This recipe is a keeper.

Great flavor. Very dense and very moist, but too greasy. I used it to make the Strawberry Angel Dessert on this site. (Which is really good.)

This is the first pound cake I have ever made. It was absolutely delicious. I followed this recipe exactly and received a lot of compliments. It's a new family favorite. My son actually asked if he could have a slice for breakfast!! I definitely plan to make it again!!

I used two cups of sugar and added almond extract. My family liked it.
