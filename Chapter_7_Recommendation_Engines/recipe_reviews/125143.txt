This was excellent!  Just a word of caution...if you use half the amount of spare ribs, do NOT cut the sauce in half.  It isn't quite enough and burned a little in the bottom of the pan.  They were still excellent.  The meat fell off the bone, but next time I will make the entire amount of sauce.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I am very picky about my sauce for ribs and I have to say this is one of the best I have tasted.

This was fantastic.  I am never crazy about anything that is too sweet, and this was just right for me.  A nice way to get away from the same old BBQ sauce.

we bought half a hog and the spare ribs came with it.  didn't think i was a big ribs fan but i was very suprised at how good they were. especially considering it was the first time i ever prepared  ribs.  i followed the recipe exactly.  i cooked them for the first hour and then an hour and a half more with the sauce.  will definetley buy spare ribs now and make this exact recipe  again.  thank you for the post.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for. A nice thick, heavy sauce. It was the best. I will keep this one in the recipe box.

My husband really liked these a lot.  (I don't like ribs so I can't include my vote.)  The sauce was really tasty and I will definitely try it on some other kinds of meat.  The only change I made was to grate the onion and celery because I didn't want a really chunky sauce.

Really good tasting recipe!  I didn't like the sauce at all when I was cooking it on the stovetop.  But after brushing it onto the ribs, it really changed to a nice flavor.  I cooked the ribs in the oven, but I must say that grilled is better.  It chars the fat nicely, whereas the oven-cooked makes for a fattier rack.

I used the cooking technique. I was at a vacation home with limited ingredients so I didn't make the sauce. I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce because it has really nice tang to it. I cooked the ribs for 1 1/2 hours, covered, then put the sauce on and cooked for another hour, uncovered. This was my first attempt at cooking ribs in the oven and everyone thought they turned out great and we had none left. So much for left-overs.

Excellent recipe - meat falls off the bone and the sauce is delicious. Easily doubled for a large crowd.  Also easy to prepare ahead of time and keep in a warm oven (did not dry out even though I put it in the warming drawer for 45 minutes).

I followed recipe EXACTLY and my sauce was runny and the taste of ketcup was overpowering.  Had to make quite a few changes to it.

Delicious!  My family will go to lengths to pick out bits of celery and onion in any dish... I substituted these with chopped green & yellow peppers and a dash of onion powder, cooking the mix a little longer so that the peppers were well-cooked.  The flavors were wonderful mixed with the recipe ingredients as shown.  I'll certainly use this recipe again!

excellent sauce - wanted to tinker with it, but I was glad I didn't as final product was outstanding. So all of you out there, try it exactly as written, and then alter if you choose.

These spare ribs turned out AMAZING!! We love the sauce so much, my husband wants me to make the sauce to use with cube steake (like a swiss steak). I used beef ribs and boiled them before baking them. I also added some boneless stew meat because I was not sure I had enough ribs for all of us. I boiled it also and then baked it right along with the ribs. It ALL turned out AWESOME!!  The meat fell right off the bones, which is how we like it! It was all very tender and had THE BEST flavor!! I will ONLY use this recipe in the future! I never even liked ribs untill this recipe came along! : ) Thanks for sharing with us such a fabulas, delicious recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I used it to make pork spare rib - rib tips, and had to modify the sauce since I didn't have a few ingredients but the ribs were cooked to perfection and delicious!  I'm making them again right now.

Very easy and delicious. Next time, add more brown sugar and less acid to make sweeter, less tangy.

Fantastic! My sauce didn't get on the ribs until the last hour instead of 1 1/2 hour, and it was fine. I added some Liquid Smoke and a squirt of honey, but otherwise followed this recipe exactly, and it gave fabulous results. Don't be intimidated by oven-made ribs... these were awesome!

Edible. Greasy. I'm not sure what would make this dish better-maybe the celery makes all the difference, since thats the one thing I didnt have. It did get eaten, but will not make again.

My husband begs me to make these all of the time. Instead of making dinner rolls out of this I make mini loafs, which work great for sandwiches. This is a great recipe and the only change I made was adding a bit of honey as another reviewer suggested.

Fabulous!  I loved this recipe.  I had some of the sauce burn though, so next time I'm going to cover it or add the sauce a little later in the cooking.

The sauce this recipe makes is awesome!  Simmering for 10 minutes didn't give me the consistency that I personally like, so I just simmered longer.  Definitely keeping this recipe!  Thanks!

I did not find these greasy at all-I expect that had more to do with the quality of the meat used.  I purchased boneless beef ribs at Costco; dredged in flour then browned.  Put them in the crockpot with the sauce and enjoyed smelling them all afternoon.  Fabulous-making again tomorrow!

I made this recipe exactly, except that I used boneless spare ribs.  The sauce was very, very good.  I was sure to chop the onion and celery very fine, after reading another review.  Admittedly, the meat ended up a little dry and overcooked but I'm pretty sure that's because of the boneless cut that I used, and cannot blame the recipe for this.  I'll make this again, but cut back on the precooking before adding the sauce and perhaps lowering the temp of the oven.  Very yummy!

I made these when I was 38 weeks pregnant and didn't feel like making the sauce as directed, so I just substituted with Sweet Baby Ray's. When I first put them in the oven, I sprinkled them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika and baked them covered for 1 1/2 hrs. Then added the bbq sauce and baked for another hour. These ribs turned out fantastic!! Tender, falling off the bone, great flavor! We've already bought another rack of ribs to cook these up again. Easy and delicious!

This was REALLY good. Great alternative when not grilling outdoors. I added some chilli sauce the second time I made these an it was also good. Thanks for sharing.

This sauce was great!  I was actually looking for a sauce to use for pulled pork bbq and this turned out to be perfect!!  (I excluded the celery from the sauce but only because I don't like celery) Thanks!

I wanted to try something tangy and I got more "twang" than anything else. We weren't too crazy for this. My family's tastes are in favor of smoky and mesquite-BBQ which is probally why we didn't care for it. Smoky BBQ lovers beware of this one.

I can't praise this dish enough! Everybody in my family adored it, especially my two teenage sons. They said it was the 'best dish you have ever made mum!' I followed the recipe exactly and served it with cajun potatoes. Yummmmmmy!

This recipe is simple and delicious!  I made it with boneless spare ribs/tips and cooked it for a total of 2 hours. It was tender and tasty.  The only two things I would change are: simmer the sauce longer to make it thicker and put foil in the bottom of my pan for easier clean up.

THIS IS ONE GREAT RECIPE.  The sauce is one of the best I've ever had.  In fact, I will be making this sauce for use when grilling outdoors.

These were excellent.  I would agree with others that there is enought sauce for about 2lbs of ribs, which is how much I made, but I would think you would need to increase if you had more.  I have never made a home made barbeque sauce before and this was very good.  I only kept the ribs in for 1 hour after I added the sauce and they were perfect.  I will definitely make again.

These ribs were so easy but my son complained that the sauce was too sour.  I will probably use less vinegar and lemon juice and add more brown sugar  next time.

The sauce had a great taste and perfect thickness, and the meat fell off the bone.  I love this recipe...the only thing I wished I had done was double the sauce, but it was still great!

These were very good - a little tangy for my taste, but the rest of the family liked them a lot.  Will make again, but will probably use less lemon.  Thanks!

I guess I should've paid more attention to the "tangy" title, but I assumed w/ such good ratings that I couldn't go wrong w/ this recipe. This had way too much of a ketchup flavor! It was not good. And the only change I made was I doubled the brown sugar. Luckily my husband will eat most anything and he finished them off, but he complained the whole time about it, saying that this is definately not the kind of ribs we eat in KC! Should've just gone w/ a bottle of BBQ sauce instead of the recipe sauce.

This was very good.  I omitted the onion and celery but followed everything else.  After cooking for the full amount, I broiled the ribs for about 5 minutes with the sauce on top to make it stick and to brown the ribs.  Turned out great.  Thanks!

Like another mentioned, I may be a bit partial to more smokey flavored BBQ sauce, but nonetheless this recipe is fool proof and very tasty!!
