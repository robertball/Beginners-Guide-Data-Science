My aunt has been making this recipe for years & has given me a few pointers....as Hollyfae said, be sure & make sure your cream cheese is all the way to the edges of the pan & sealed (to keep the jello from seeping under the cream cheese & making the crust soggy). It's also helpful to chill the cream cheese really well before topping w/ the jello.  Sometimes I like to add an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple in w/ the strawberries (Paula Deen's version)

A hit every time I make it!  Do not try to substitute low fat cream cheese or cool whip... the white layer just won't come together as nicely.  I learned the hard way.  Multiple times.  Make sure to spread the white layer all the way to the edges and get a nice seal so that the jello layer doesn't seep into the bottom.  In the spring and early summer, when strawberries are in season around here, I also slice some fresh berries into the jello for presentation.

I love this recipe but found it much better if after the jello is all disolved I add 4 ice cubes until melted then add an 8 oz tub of whipped cream to the jello mixture and mix til smooth then adding the strawberries after. It stays more firm and has a wonderful creamy taste to it.

SOME TIPS:  This is an easy recipe to follow, but I can understand why people are having a problem with the layers.  Thru my experience, this is what I did and didnt seem to have a problem with any of the layers seeping thru.  FIRST-COOL THE CRUST COMPLETELY!!  SECOND-CREAM THE SUGAR AND CREAM CHEESE THOROUGHLY!  SPREAD ON PRETZEL MIXTURE AND REFRIGERATE AT LEAST 30-45 MINUTES.  PREPARE JELLO AS DIRECTED BY DISSOLVING COMPLETELY FOR TWO MINUTES  AND ADD FROZEN, SLICED STRAWBERRIES.  LET SIT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES STIRRING FREQUENTLY DURING THOSE FIVE MINUTES UNTIL IT IS LIKE A JELLIED, SOFT TEXTURE.  I USED A METAL WHISK TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. POUR OVER REFRIGERATED CREAM CHEESE LAYER.  REFRIGERATE UNTIL SET, ABOUT A COUPLE OF HOURS.  HOPE THIS HELPS!!!!

This was really fun to make. I only added just a little vanilla to the cream cheese/whipped topping layer. Other than that, I made no changes. I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and chill the layers in-between layering. Made for an easier time of layering. I also made sure to go right to the edges with the cream cheese layer to keep from the jello layer from seeping through and making the "crust" soggy. Fun! EDITED NEXT DAY: I LOVED the top and bottom layers. They were wonderful together. The bottom layer was.....just not right for this dessert. If I were to make this again, I'd double a recipe for graham cracker crust and use that instead of the pretzels. It just wasn't good. EDITED AGAIN A WEEK LATER: I made this again today with a crust made from Lorna Doone cookies. I just followed the same recipe, only using two sleeves of crushed Lorna Doone cookies. Much better.
EDITED YET AGAIN: I made the top layer today with Blackberry Fusion Jello and this summer's blackberries. Fabulous. Not as overpoweringly sweet as the strawberries.

I wasn't sure how fine to crush the pretzels...I opted for somewhere around coarse, but it wasn't right.  Next time, I'll crush more.  Nonetheless, my guests enjoyed this wierd dessert and one person even asked for the recipe --  and knowing the tough crowd I prepared this for, that is the highest compliment!  I'll be making this one again.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I mixed up the jello, boiling water and frozen strawberries and let it sit at room tempeature for 30 minutes while the crust and cream cheese layer chilled.  Then I let the whole dessert chill overnight.  I also only baked the crust for 8 minutes.  This is a very tasty recipe and people absolutely love it.

Also good with Raspberry gelatin and use frozen raspberries....not in juice, just frozen.  I also use 1/2 cup of powdered sugar rather than 1 cup of sugar....it's plenty sweet. The cream cheese layer does need to be chilled for about 45-60 minutes and I chill the gelatin for about 40 minutes then add the frozen berries....pour that onto the cheese layer.  It is a great potluck recipe.

Love this recipe & I get requests for it all the time. Make sure to spread the cream cheese mixture all the way to the edges - it keeps the jello from making the crust mushy. Thanks Betty!

Followed the recipe to the letter.  Looked like everything set but when I cut and served it, the strawberry top slid off the runny middle and was a mess.  Tasted good but was not pretty.  Any suggestions as to what could have gone wrong?

This is a great recipe, it turned out perfect.  A word to the wise, however--I needed my 9x13" pan for dinner, so I thought I'd try to use a 7x11" pan for the pretzel salad instead.  That was a mistake--I ended up having to leave out some of the delicious strawberry topping!

My grandma fixed this recipe when I was a kid and I LOVED it. I keep seeing everyone's hints to make sure the cream cheese mixture completely covered the pretzels, but I had trouble getting it to spread! It kept picking up the pretzels and I ended up with a mixture of pretzels and the cream cheese mixture. What did I do wrong?!?! I really, really want to perfect this recipe as it is part of some of my favorite childhood memories!

This is awesome-I served it at a party recently and everyone loved it.  I would recommend making it the night before serving so it has plenty of time to set.

I could eat this all day! I never know what there is to get excited about with jello, but this recipe is an exception! One downside is that it does NOT keep well I think the crust gets mushy pretty much no matter what you do but you will not usually have any leftovers anyway. Note that recipe calls for 2 cups crushed pretzels, not 2 cups of pretzels crushed lol. Or you'll be staring at the pan like me for a minute saying "huh?"

I've been making this recipe for years, but I make a few modifications that make it even better.  First, instead of strawberry jello and berries, I use raspberry jello and frozen raspberries.  The day before, I let the berries thaw over a collander.  Once I have collected that juice, I combine it with boiling water to make the 2 cups the recipe calls for.  Makes the top layer much more interesting.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except lessening the water added to the jello a little bit due to juices in some of my frozen strawberries.  I cooked the crust just 8 minutes to avoid having a too hard crust.  Also, I chilled the cream cheese layer for a half hour or so before adding the jello.  I recommend letting the jello firm up a little while in the fridge before pouring it over the cream cheese layer if you are having a mixing problem.  This was great!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I make it slightly different than the recipe though.  Instead of using a 9x13 pan, I use a bundt pan and make the recipe in the opposite order (jello part first, then the cream layer, and the pretzels last).  Of course, I am not able to toast the pretzel part, but it still turns out really well.  Spray the bundt pan with non-cook cooking spray before starting and then turn over onto a plate once it is done setting.  It looks as great as it tastes!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. OUTSTANDING!!!
As I read other reviews, I also refrigerated the cream cheese layer while making the strawberry topping. Definitely need to make......

This was very tasty and it got rave reviews.  Someone else was unsure of how fine to crush the pretzels, and I would recommend crushing them pretty fine.  Otherwise, you get big pieces of crunchy pretzel.  I would also recommend using frozen sliced strawberries.

After reading numerous reviews, I made this, and it turned out "Perfect"! Everyone is saying that the crust gets 'soggy', I have made this 5 times and it has never gotten soggy, even after it has been in the fridge for several days. I made it exactly like the recipe says except for this: I am a diabetic, so I used sugar-free jello, and I used Splenda instead of sugar. If it is made correctly, the crust will not get soggy. It is not the recipe that causes the soggy crust; it is the preparer. A wonderful recipe!!

My sister-in-law gave me this recipe several years ago, but she prepares it with the layers reversed. Jello on the bottom, then cream cheese layer and crushed pretzels on top. This way the pretzels don't get soggy. We serve it in a clear salad bowl. Very good. The whole family loves it.

UPDATE:  I've been making this recipe for 7 yrs now, and it never disappoints.  I always have someone asking me for the recipe.  This is great for potlucks, family reunions, and was recently away visiting family and was asked to make this for my nephew to take to his workplace.  Never a need to worry about there being any leftovers with this one.         I've tried different versions and have found the crust to sometimes be too hard. This recipe made the perfect crust. I use butter pretzels(I like the flavor),and use a quart of fresh strawberries instead of frozen. Perfect dessert and again the crust was perfect.

this is a party hit! the salty-sweet is what makes this dessert so addicting! You can also get away without all that butter for the pretzel crust. i only added 2 tbsps to the crushed pretzels and it turned out just fine. it was still savory and salty- and a bit less fatty.

Mmmmmm this was good; it did take a bit more time with the chilling of each layer.  I used fresh strawberries and kept putting it in the freezer to hurry up the chilling process.  My only problem was that the pretzel crust seemed to stick to the bottom of my dish and was hard to cut through; maybe greasing the bottom would help.

The first time I made this, I cut a lot of corners calorie-wise by using fat-free cream cheese (I figured it'd be okay since the crust was the only thing being baked), fat-free cool whip and sugar-free jello, and half splenda.  Man, do not do this.   Usually I'm not picky with those things, but this is one of those recipes that you think you can do that with because it doesn't involve a lot of baking, and it just does not work. The second time was much better. I used brown sugar on the crust and it was a little less chewy and a little more savory. Oh, and I would definitely recommend letting the jello set up a little before pouring it over everything else. If your strawberries are frozen, the jello will set quickly. I used fresh strawberries once and couldn't for the life of me get the jello to set, but then added a few ice cubes and that took care of it.

I made this exactly as the directions stated, it was delicious!  Starting in the AM, I baked the crust for 8 minutes, and let it cool completely. I added the cream cheese layer around noon and put it in the fridge. Around 8 PM I finished with the jello layer and put it in the fridge overnight for an afternoon party the next day. It was a hit and while I had some leftover (small party, big dessert) I don't mind because there's just enough for me to enjoy!! Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!!

Oh this is so yummy. I divided mine into two 8 inch square pans for 2 parties I had to attend in one weekend. My grandma made this when I was little and I loved it, but she made it using Raspberries and Raspberry jello. YUM! To mix it up sometimes she used a can of crushed pineapple ALSO. So, I decided to make this using raspberries and crushed pineapple. Well, I ran out at both parties and people were asking for more! You need to chill the cream cheese layer for about 40 minutes. Also chill the jello before adding fruit for about 40 minutes, then add friut, then pour over chilled cream cheese layer.

My sister has been making this recipe for years. For some reason I never asked her for the recipe. When I saw the recipe, I called and asked her if it was the same one she used and she said "yes" I made it and it was wonderful.

My sister-in-law made this and we all really liked it.  I think the pretzel crust is really interesting and I may use it in something else.  (I am still not sure why this is called a "salad" though.

My grandma made this when I was little and I love to make it for special occassions.  One thing she did and I do that takes it one step up, is to make the jello with heated pineapple juice and a large box of jello rather than 2 smalls.  I also use powdered sugar for the cream cheese mix rather than regular white.

My jello topping never really set, therefore the pretzel crust turned quite soggy.  And it wasn't a "pretty dish" to serve.  Thank goodness it was only for me, my hubby, and two small grandsons.

All time favorite of my family for holidays! Tips for crushing pretzels, put in ziplock bag and use rolling pin to crush as fine as you prefer. Make sure to pull the cream cheese/cool whip mixture to the edge of the pan or jello mixture will seep onto crust. Let jello/strawberries mixture stiffen up while you make crust, however don't let set entirely or will not smooth over cheese nicely.  Enjoy!

Suggest NOT to use large/thick pretzels-when broken up they absorb the butter and don't turn into a 'crust' as well as the thin pretzels.  Still, its quite tasty.

Yummy recipe.  We serve this for big family get togethers and holidays.  It's a great tradition.  I only add 2/3 c. sugar to the cream cheese layer.  Everything doesn't need to be so sweet as the strawberries and jello already are.

This was super delicious.  It was a little hard to spread the cream cheese over the pretzels.  Made it work and it was worth it.

The perfect combination of "sweet" meets "salty"; took it to work and it was devoured with lots of requests for the recipe; make sure to completely seal the crust with the creamcheese topping prior to adding the jello to avoid a soggy crust; i used the pretzel rods instead of regular pretzels I think regular pretzels work better...the rod's were harder to cut through. i used brown sugar in the crust instead of white.

Every time I make this my family INHALES it. Although calorific, it is extremely tasty. I do suggest crumbling more pretzels though- mine didn't cover the bottom. Also, slicing the strawberries makes it a ton easier to eat.

I have had this before, but it was impossible to make!

The crust did not cover the bottom of the pan.  So I added to it.  Then I could not get the cream cheese layer to spread over the crust.  The crust kept lifting.  It was a mess.

It took forever to get the jello mixture to set.

Yum!  Great recipe!  I followed as written with the exception of using only 16 oz of strawberries vs. the 2-10 oz packages recommended.  That's what I had and although 20 oz would have been better the 16 oz worked just fine!

Fantastic recipe!  I always substitute sugar free jello/cool whip and use splenda or sweet-n-low for the sugar.  Strawberries are great, but so are peaches (with peach jello!)...  Yum!  Also, I find it helpful to refrigerate after each step, that way it doesn't all mix into one mushy mess!

I made this for a ''Birthday Dinner''... It looked yummy and it was.. My guests all raved about the ''pretzel crust''... It is time consuming, I took some other reviewers advise and let the crust really cool, then the cream cheese layer stayed in the refrig for about 45 min.. I also made the Jello mixture, adding fresh sliced strawberries, and let that cool in the refrig until it jelled.. Make sure you ''seal'' the cream cheese mixture all the way to the edges... I had a few pieces leftover, it stayed crunchy for several days!  I will definitely make this again!

Reduced amount of water by 1/2 cup after reading stories about it being runny. Cooled the pretzel layer, than firmed the cool whip layer prior to jelly/berries. Hubby said it was a bit difficult to remove pieces from the glass pyrex. Unsure why. Big hit at a get together.

YUMMY! I've had this multiple times, but have never made it myself. My friends loved it as I had made it for our weekly dinner get-together. I was so delighted that it turned out as well as the others that I have tried. Helpful hint from the reviews was to make sure that the cream cheese mixture completely covers the pretzel mixture to avoid sogginess from the strawberries. Thank you Betilda for posting this recipe!

I make a similar salad but I flavor the cream cheese filling with a little cocoa to make it a chocolate strawberry pretzel salad, except my mom always called it jiggle-fluff pie.  I find that it needs to be eaten quickly because the pretzels will get soggy otherwise, so I sometimes halve everything and make it in a 8x8 pan for just me and hubby.  Always a hit though!

Oh well.. try it and love it. =)

I liked this a lot....but maybe not as much as I hoped I would.  The crust layer seemed a bit thick...and turned out pretty crumbly....maybe I should have baked it a little longer than 8 minutes, but I was paranoid about it turning into a rock like some people complained.  And whoever suggested that putting the jello mixture in the fridge to set up for an hour before pouring on the cream cheese layer steered me WAY wrong...because my jello was completely set in 15 minutes and I had to scoop it onto the cream cheese.  It still looked okay, but not what I was envisioning.  All in all, taste is very good....I'll make again.

Yum! I love this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing. I have made this dish for several years now, and your version of the recipe is very nice. Since I am usually serving a crowd, I used my 10 x 15 x 2 clear glass pan. I used your recipe with one extra block of cream cheese as I like a thick layer and had a bigger pan. I couldn't find 2 (10 oz) pkgs of frozen strawberries, so I used one 16 oz bag. I also like my strawberries not so whole, so I used a potato masher on them. For the crust I cooked it for 8 minutes this time, but it was sort of fragile. I have cooked it longer and it has gotten too hard... So for my oven I think 10 minutes is perfect. VERY IMPORTANT: Spread cream cheese all the way to the edges of the pan to keep the strawberries from seeping into the crust and making it soggy. Also, you must chill the strawberry mixture before you put it on the cream cheese layer, or it will melt its way through. I also chill the cream cheese layer while I am freezing the strawberry mixture until it is thickened. I am also very careful when adding the strawberry layer... I spoon the strawberries on and then slowly/carefully pour the rest of the juice. You must leave plenty of time for this to chill as it needs time to harden. I always make this the day before.

I've been making this dish for many years. One varition: I sometimes use fresh strawberries, just add some ice cubes in with the jello and berries to help thicken it better. Also, I use sugar free jello & you can't taste the difference.

Being philosophically opposed to Cool Whip, I made my own whipped cream in a stand mixer with 8 oz. of heavy cream. I used 20 oz. fresh strawberries which I washed, sliced and froze on a piece of wax paper on a plate. Pretzels went into my food processor in two batches, approximately 7 oz. total thin pretzels. Crust was magnificent, baked 10 minutes. I allowed it to cool completely, no rushing.  Cream cheese layer kept the jello away from the crust exactly as advised after spreading it to the edges of the glass pan. I chilled the second layer before adding the jello. It is a delectable, attractive layered dessert, cuts easily when cold. New favorite thing!

I've mad this recipe for years and I'm always required to take it to potlucks and family gatherings.  I add about 1/2 cup if powdered sugar to my cream cheese mix to give it more of a cheesecake texture/flavor.  I also let the strawberry jello mixture partially set in the freezer before putting on top of the cream cheese mixture so the cream cheese doesn't mix with the jello and it stays more firm.

I love pretzel jello.  This was something my mom made every holiday and has lots of fond memories attached to it.  With this particular recipe there are just a couple problems.  First there isn't enough pretzel crust.  You need 3 cups of pretzels so that the crust isn't too thin and hits all the spots.  When you add the extra cup of pretzels don't increase the butter.  There was too much.  And as for the delicious white, middle layer.  Yummy!  But there is far too much!  If I had put it all in the pan there would have been no room to pour the jello on top.  So cut the recipe for the white stuff in half.  The awesome thing about this recipe is you can do it up anyway you like.  Try lemon jello and raspberries.  Super pretty!

i used reduced fat cream cheese and frozen topping; i used 2/3s of called for butter, and i used 3/4 of called for sugar.  had no problems, all worked well and tasted great!  don't know why some have said not to go for the reduced calories...

My mother has been making this for our family for years now and it has become a tradition at every holiday. It is ALWAYS a hit and everyone loves this! It is delicious as is and we don't make any changes in the recipe.

We always have this as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and this recipe is exactly like my mother-in-law's. Every now and then my aunt will use orange jello and mandarine oranges for a change up...and I was skeptical at first, but it is actually just a delicious that way too!!!

I have made this for years, it's the most requested salad/dessert for our family.  I use a little bit larger glass pan, also 16 oz. of lite cool whip, otherwise everything else the same.  I even get requests to bring this to pot luck's at work. Definitely a keeper, one we will continue to make for years to come!

This is one of my husband's favorite desserts. However, I prefer to omit the jello layer altogether, and just serve each portion with strawberry puree drizzled on top and around plate. If it's going to a party, I make long lines of the puree on top of the whole dish, and drag a table knife in shallow, perpendicular strokes across to make a pretty presentation.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My kids LOVE it! Don't try to make it the day before. The crust turns to mush (still very tasty - just looks bad).

Not very exciting or flavorful.  I made it for a party, and everyone liked it, but it wasn't the knock-out dish I thought it sounded like when I read the recipe.

Made it with peach flavored jell-o and canned peaches that I cut into smaller pieces.  It was such a hit that I have made it twice in less than a week.  Pot Luck luncheon and game day with friends.  Will keep this in the rotation.

I must have done something wrong, the flavor was great when I was able to get it out of the Pyrex pan.  Can't imagine it being difficult with that much butter.  Also jello just slid off the cream cheese mixture.  I'd like to try it again if I knew where I goofed.  Could it have been because it got a little past the egg white consistency before pouring it on the cheese mixture.

I liked it. I read many reviews that said it was runny and not very good after a couple of days.  I accidently did not buy enough jello and only used one 3 oz package along with extra frozen strawberries and it came out great and held up well for over a week.

LOVE THIS!! 
Here's my changes:
read reviews about mushy pretzels.
I DID NOT bake the crust for 8 to 10 mins. Turned out just as good!!! Used fat free cream cheese, fat free whipped cream. And really you could leave out the 3/4 cup butter and 3 tables. of sugar and add less than 1 cup of sugar to make it way healthier. Granted, if you are going to take it to a wedding or baby shower you should probably use all the fatting stuff but just for family outings it is REALLY and truely just as good and actually amazing as fat free!!!

I heavily altered this recipe. I used real, homemade whipped cream. I heavily sweetened it, so I didn't add any when I creamed the cream cheese. I also left out the jello and strawberries and topped it with cherry pie filling instead. It was delicious.

My mom always makes this and everyone one loves it, thought I would try my hand at it and take it to a 4th of July Party and it was gone within the hour! very easy to make, I followed the advise of others so the jello wouldnt seep down and turn the pretzels to mush and that was a huge help---thanks

This was THE best..Definetly a favorite. We doubled the filling and the crust, as it did not cover the 9x13 dish. Also-  we put the jello mixture in the fridge, for about 25 minutes until it was the right texture.

When I saw this combination I knew I had to try it.  Both kids & adults seemed to enjoy this dessert.  I really like the combination of the salty pretzel crust with the sweet layers.  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.

This recipe is great!  What a nice texture with the crunch bottom, cream cheese middle and jello top.  Everyone in my family loved it!

I used a wee bit more of the pretzel crust and cooked exactly 8 minutes. Then let it cool on a rack and in the refrigerator for a little bit. After I made the cream cheese center, I also refrigerated it for a little bit as well before I spread the mixture over the crushed pretzels making sure to cover all the edges. I added 2 ices cubes to the jello and let it gel. Simple, Quick and Easy recipe. I put it into the refrigerator overnight for a delish desert to serve at a Church function! PRETTY DARN YUMMY!

I have been dreaming of this for about a month, and I jumped at the chance to make it at our next family gathering. However I was a little disappointed. The filling and topping was wonderful, but as good as I thought it would be I did not enjoy the taste of the pretzel crust with it. If I make it again I will try a graham cracker or cookie crust as some suggested. A splash of vanilla to the cream cheese layer adds more flavor and made it very yummy. I used frozen sliced strawberries w/ syrup, so I decreased the amount of water by about 1/2 cup to account for the liquid with the berries. It made the topping very good. I am looking forward to trying some other flavor variations.

I found that, if you chill it once the cream cheese topping is on, it sets better when you add the strawberries. also at serving time, if it comes right out of the fridge when you are ready to serve it, its less messy.

I've been making this for years. It has become my requested dish for extended family gatherings. I have added a third box of jello without increasing the liquid to help the jello set. My hint for spreading the white layer is to use 2 spoons to spread & a lot of patience! Also,once the crust is baked, you can transfer it to smaller containers or nonbakeware to finish jello. The smaller containers help it last longer, as it only gets soggy after initial serving.

If you want a beautiful patriotic holiday dessert, add a layer of Cool Whip on top of the strawberries and then sprinkle fresh blueberries on top of that. Stick a tiny American flag in each serving, and you've got a real winner!

Sweet and salty makes me happy. :)I was careful with the crust as the reviews suggested. However, I found that the jello was a little overpowering. Next time I will double up cream cheese or use half the jello. I'd like to point out that there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for sharing.

What a perfect Springtime desset!  It was enjoyed by all.  I used frozen sliced strawberries and they did not need to sit long in the jello to begin to set.

I have made a version of this for years using raspberries and raspberry jello. Instead of using a rectangular pan, I layer it as a salad in a large clear bowl: jello layer first, cream cheese layer and then the pretzel mixture, baked, and then sprinkled over as a topping. Oh, so good!!

I love this salad!  My grandma used to make it all the time and I haven't had it since we used to go to her house for the holidays.  Awesome to find it here!  Made as written, although I did cool the cream cheese layer in the fridge for about 45 minutes before adding the jello layer.

This has been a tradition in our home each Easter and Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. People who haven't tried it before leave asking for the recipe. I have tried it with other flavors of Jello (such as raspberry or cran-raspberry and use mixed berries). It's always a big hit!

I use the sqaure pretzels--just personal preference, don't know if it makes any real difference! And full-fat everything :)  Fat is less-bad for you than the extra sugar low-fat products have in them anyway. And fat = flavor.

Very easy to make and yummy! I actually did use light cream cheese and cool whip and it turned out great. I just made sure to completely cover the prezels to prevent the jello from seeping through.

fantastic recipe as always! I add a bit of extra juice to the frozen strawberries; find ones that are already cut up into smaller pieces, if possible.  To speed up the jello process, I stick the pan in the freezer for a few minutes.

I make this for parties in the spring and summer.  It's a GREAT recipe and there's never any leftovers!  The last time I made it, however, I did learn a valuable lesson.  Do not use cream cheese that's been in the freezer and defrosted.  If I buy cream cheese on sale, I'll usually toss it in the freezer.  It's ok in something that you bake (cheesecakes, etc.) but NOT good in something that is meant to set up in the refrigerator.  The middle layer remained too runny and never really set up well.  It still tasted great, but I knew it wasn't perfect!

A delicious treat.  Be prepared to spend time in your kitchen though.  I takes time for the crust to bake and cool, for the gelatin to dissolve and cool and for the cream cheese to come up to temp for smooth mixing.  It wasn't a problem for me because I was making several other things and started with this first.  A great way to use up leftover pretzels.   -- I just made this again and used the bottom of the pretzel bag. I don't recommend that as the crust was pretty salty. I didn't have frozen strawberries, so I used canned pineapple. Delicious!

This is very good.  For 4th of July, you can reserve some of the cream cheese filling to make stars and stripes and buy a few blueberries as the stars backdrop. Follow Directions exactly, do not thaw out strawberries.

I love this recipe! I think if I made it again I would leave a lip of cream cheese filling around the outside edge so that the strawberry filling does not overflow and soak the crust. I do not like that you have to eat this quickly or the crust is soggy. I also would bake the crust a bit more to make it extra crisp. But I LOVE the taste of thsi dish!

I was not aware of this website until I tried this dessert at a friends house and asked her for the recipe.  I never would have thought under this delicious strawberry-jello-cool whip dessert was....crushed pretzels!  It was so good, I'm trying to think of a reason to invite friends over so I can make it this time!  And I found a great web site because of it!

I first tasted this classic recipe in the 60's. I was sold! The buttery, mildly salty pretzel crust is a delicious contrast to the sweet strawberry and the cream layers. I most recently brought this to our family reunion, and everyone went back for seconds! Easy to prepare; I used Neufchatel (lower in fat) cheese, and this did not alter the taste or consistency.

This is so yummy! I took it to a potluck and it was gone quickly. I got many compliments and people were surprised that the crust is pretzels. Many thought it was made of nuts. I used pretzel sticks and put them in the food processor to chop them. It worked well. Definately try this recipe!

We absolutely love this dessert.  We've tried it with other jello flavors and it has been equally good.  Even without the fruit.

I made this for a party, but it was so good I kept it for myself and took something else.  I can't wait to try this again, maybe with another fruit such as raspberries.  A keeper!

The crust tastes like praline pecans....every time I make it people are amazed it's pretzels....I could (honestly) eat the whole thing...even though it make take me a few days! Some guests eat it with the buffet meal, some eat it for desert (or both)!!

This turned out perfectly!  I crushed up one 8 oz bag of mini pretzels and made certain the crust was completely cooled; even chilled in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.  After making the whipped topping, I also put it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Just need to make certain the crust is COMPLETELY COOLED and the whipped topping is THICK & CHILLED.  Like other reviews, I made certain to spread the whipped topping to the edges and in the corners.  I wiped down the pan to clean up any stray whipped topping.  For the jello topping, I boiled 2 cups of water and poured in the jello packets, stirring for about 2 min.  I then turned off the heat & added the sliced frozen strawberries.  I took my salad chopper to crush up some of the strawberries, then stirred, let it sit for 5 minutes, stirring a couple of times.  It was pretty thick and ready to spread on top.  Looks picture perfect!!!

Alright yall. I was a little confused if I had to make the jello like the actual BOX or just the boiling 2 cups of water and add strawberries. SO glad I listened to my gut and just did the 2 cups boiling water and then mixed the strawberries in. PHEW! Like all the reviews say, Make sure that crust is COOLED! Also make sure you spread the cream cheese mixture with no holes in it and seal it so no pretzels are showing and nothing can seep into it. Then chill the pretzels and cream cheese in the fridge for 45-60 mins. Then pour the jellowed strawberries over it! Refrigerate for a couple of hours. I made mine the day before I needed it and all was well.  NOMZ! Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition!!

I've  made this several times and have started to have problems with the recipe - sometimes the crust gets too hard and is impossible to cut through and get out of the pan and also doesn't make enough to cover the pan.  The most recent time I had a problem with the strawberry layer sliding off of the cream cheese/cool whip layer.  Why does this happen and what can I do to prevent it?  Cream cheese layer was refrigerated prior to adding strawberry layer.

Sounds delicious and would count as one of your servings of fruit for the day....but no way does this fill a 9x13 casserole pan. I also see lots of posts about the jello not setting...you are not to follow the jello box instructions...follow these, you are cutting uwater in half from box...hey sugar and dairy never killed anyone, right?..just double your workout routine for the week

This recipe is flawless as-is! Nothing needs changing in any way, for a really easy to make dessert. The proportions are spot-on and the flavors mesh very well. I really dont understand why some reviewers had problems but if you folow the directions to the letter, it will turn out perfectly. I used a Pyrex 13x9 dish which was ideal. This was my first time but wont be my last!

I'm gluten free, so I used Glutino pretzels and also substituted regular white sugar with Truvia baking blend and cut back just a little on the amount. My Grandma and Mom were crazy about it! That's my lower sugar, gluten free version!

I just love this for a summer dessert!!! I used blueberry jello and mixed berries an mango fruit (very tasty) I fin figured out that the whipped cream whips better when it's left out a lil bit and the cream is at room temp (it seals better)

I have made this recipe many, many times and never had a problem till today.  Everyone loves this dessert and I'm expected to bring it to every family gathering!  However, today, I burned the crust.  I think from now on I'll heat the oven to 350 and leave it in for only 8 min.  I also tried something new, as I'm making two today.  I am using peach jello with frozen, sliced peaches.  I'm hoping this will taste as good as the strawberry!!

I always loved this Salad but hadn't made it in years.  I read all of the helpful ideas from previous reviews and added my own.  I made sure that the whipped cream and cream cheese was cold before putting on top of the pretzels.  Making sure to go all the way to the edges to not allow the jello mix to seep into the pretzels.  Also the jello and strawberry mix I let is sit for about an hour before adding to the top making sure that I stirred the mixture to blend the strawberries into the jello.  Other than that easy and simple recipe.

This recipe should not be made in a 9 x 13 pan if you are expecting a nice serving presentation use a smaller pan for depth. with that said. the ingredients listed work fine.

Delicious!! This is one of those dishes I always associate with summer BBQs but have never thought to make it myself. I decided to make it for our Memorial Day BBQ this year and am so glad I did! The only change I made was decreased the butter in the crust to 1/2 c and used 2 heaping cups of pretzels as I like a thicker crust. I followed the numerous suggestions to chill between layers etc and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for posting!

It's been so long since I ate this wonderful, flavorful salad/dessert. Salty to sweet and the fruit flavor takes me back many years to my Mom's experimentation with food. She was only told how to make the crust and from there developed a dead ringer for this one.
Thank you.  I made it and love it all over again.

I've loved this recipe since I was a child.  It is absolutely the best if you use the Butter Snap pretzels for the crust.

Thanks sooooo much for the tip about making SURE the cream cheese covers the crust! I made this one before and it was so soggy, I was so bummed. Didn't know what went wrong though! Awesome recipe!! :)

Very strange.  I made it for company based on the reviews.  We all agreed that while it tasted okay, it was strange looking and a bit unappealing.  If I were to make it again, I would follow the advice of one of the other reviewers and combine the middle layer with the jello layer and use a grahm cracker crust.

This gets rave reviews every time I make it. A co-worker made it for a meeting and I got to try it.  A few weeks later, I made it for a family gathering.  It has been requested several times since.

I have made this recipe for at least 20 years.  My sister requests that I make it every Thanksgiving & Christmas.  It's a great make ahead (2-3 days) recipe.  The classification as salad is really stretching it - it's really like a strawberry pie.  Yummy!

I finally decided to make this and it was wonderful. The crust is so delicious and so is the cream cheese filling. Didn't care too much for the jello; might try strawberry filling next time but, everything else a-ok.

Wonderful! Just like I remembered, my husbands Aunt used to make it and I hadn't had it in years. I made it for July 4th BBQ, it was super quick and easy. My oldest son ate 4 servings and ask when I was going to make it again. Thanks

The only thing I would have changed was just using fresh strawberries on top.  It was great as is....but I think it would have been even better without the jello.

My grandmother made this recipe forever and it's one of my absolute favorites! The only difference was she didn't put sugar in the cream cheese/whipped topping layer.

I took this to a potluck last night.  It got wonderful reviews.  Plus it was very easy!  I did allow it to 'rest' in the fridge after the cream cheese layer.  Truth is I got busy and couldn't finish it right away.  After about 1 hr, I had the time to add the Jello layer.  Loved it!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is my family's all time favorite.  One tip I will give is when making the jello.  Dissolve the jello in the boiling water and then add your frozen strawberries.  This will speed up the cooling off process for the jello and make things much easier!

This was decent. I used a 9x13 pan and the recommended amount of crushed pretzels didn't seem like enough so I ended up adding more, same problem with the cream cheese mixture it didn't spread very well because there didn't seem to be enough. Also the pretzels got soggy after a day in the fridge on the bottom.

This was a big hit at my husband's family reunion. I wanted to make something to impress my new in-laws and this worked. I'm severly allergic to berries so I made my with cherries and cherry jello instead. I used frozen cherries but had to quarter them. Overall the recipe turned out great!

Very tasty!  I make this with fat free or low fat cream cheese, "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter, and sugar free jello for a delicious but lighter tasting version.

This turned out perfectly.  It's always a hit with my husband's family and I was asked to bring it to a family picnic.  This was the first time I ever made this dish. I follwed the recipe to a 'T' and had no problems whatsoever!  I pulsed the pretzels in the food processor to speed up the process.

This is sooooooo good. I will never make it again just for us, because there's too much of it and we will eat it ALL...But its great to take to a meal or BBQ and have the recipe ready, because everyone will ask you for it.

hahahahaha I have to laugh this is the same receipe my family uses every year and for every family get-together. Only one change the name, we call it "stupid" pretzel salad, for reasons only known to the women in my mom's family.

I made this for Thanksgiving Nov.27,08.  I have tried other recipes like this one but this was the best.  I made it a little different based on a previous review.  I added 1 cup only of boiling water, and then the slightly defrosted strawberries.  I Let it set in fridge for an hour before layering on top of the cream cheese layer.  It was like a very thick strawberry topping when it was set and chilled.  The pieces cut cleanly and evenly.

amazing, just like my mom used to make.  make sure to let each layer cool enough or it will get soggy and mush up together.  it's great though!  yummy!

Perfect recipe!  I have tried this salad 2 times previous, but thanks to this recipe and tips from other reviewers, this is the first time it came out right!  Now, I don't have to rely on my grandmother to make it for me!

I love this, but a minor change, my husband didn't care for the pretzels as a crust, { I liked it,} so I opted for grahmn cracker crust, fixed exactly the same way,,  this is a winner,,,

This recipe is part of our traditional holdiay meals.  It is to die for!  The salty flavors of the pretzel with the sweet jello and whipped cream are a perfect combination.  I always make it exactly as described.

This went over really well.  Everyone loved it and it was the perfect mix of sweet and sour.  I did top the jello with a thin layer of cool whip for a more finished touch.  It was perfect for Thanksgiving, thank you

I have to say, this dessert was the first to go at my Thanksgiving dinner! My 15 year old daughter made this. It was quite easy.  She used unsalted pretzels which she first put in the food processor to get them almost like a breadcrumb texture.  When she baked them, they all baked together...YUMMMMM! Now we are going to make this again soon using peach jello and frozen peaches.

This is one of my family's favorites!  Sounds odd, but Oh So Good!  We don't mind when the pretzels get soggy, I think it tastes even better that way!  This is definitely a recipe that gets into our Family cookbook!

I tried this recipe because of the high ratings here, but it just didn't go over as well as I expected. The taste was okay, but nothing to write home about. I followed the recipe exactly, but just didn't taste the sweet/salty combo everyone raved about. My daughter thought the crust was made from granola, and my granddaughter took one taste and wouldn't take another bite. It was okay, but I probably won't try this one again. Sorry!

I have looked all over for this recipe! This is even better then my grandma's! I just spread the cream cheese layer all the way to the edge of the glass and chill it for 30 minutes or so while I am mixing the jello and waiting for it to set a little. AWESOME!!

Nice mix of sweet and salty.  I may not have made the pretzels small enough, or didn't bake it long enough, because they didn't come close to making a crust, the pretzels went everywhere when I put in the coolwhip mix.  It tasted great, though.

This is a recipe my aunt used to make for me years ago.  I was thrilled to find it again, and I made it for our Christmas Eve celebration.  Don't let the thought of the pretzels fool you!  It is a surprisingly great combination that everyone loved.  Now that I have the recipe again, it will definitely be a repeat dessert at our house!

My mom used to make this from a Weight Watchers cookbook (probably a little lighter recipe) and I loved it.  This is really good!  I especially like the extra salt that's in the pretzel bag in the crust-- salty/sweet, so good!

The crust was too hard the 1st serving, then just got mushy for leftovers. The taste of the pretzels as the crust was what made this dessert so good. Just don't serve it as leftovers.

I love this recipe.  When I make it, I use "raspberry jello" instead.  It gives it a tart flavor instead of the sweet strawberry.  I have a red and white enamel-ware pan that I use for this salad.  It looks really nice on a buffet table.

This is an excellent dessert, it got many compliments. I couldn't even taste the salty pretzels, which was an excellent idea. I find it tastes better if you serve it before the jello has fully set.

This is a must at all my family gatherings-the
salt goes so well with the other ingredients.
We prefer to serve this as a salad with the meal
rather than as dessert. Try it ,everyone loves it.

I love this dessert very much and have made it for years. Only difference is that I use frozen sliced strawberries not whole. And in recent years started making it with gluten free pretzels so my grandson can eat it. Turned out to be an improvement because the gluten free ones don't get soggy so I now make this even if not going to be sharing at a potluck!

Love this recipe!!  This is my favorite dessert, I had it for my birthday two times in a row and I made it for all the partys I go to. Now my family actually ask me to make it for them for their party because it is so good. I totally suggest trying this recipe if you haven't already.   I have tried 3 or 4 other recipes for this dessert but this is the best one. It is simple and easy. Good flavor and the proportions and the amounts are spot on, for the best tasting dessert at the party.

This is the first jello salad I have ever made.  It turned out perfectly.  I took it to Christmas and everyone raved about it.   

I read many reviews and do not understand how anyone could "flop" this and not have it turn out.  

Never use generic or low fat CoolWhip (you will not have a good outcome if you do).  Do not use low fat cream cheese. 

The pretzel crust is the perfect blend of salt/sweet and complements the jello/strawberries perfectly.  I would not change this pretzel crust to a graham crust.  

When spreading the cream cheese layer, like others suggested, make sure to spread this layer all the way to the edges, so the jello layer doesn't seep through to the crust and get it soggy.  

Good luck keeping this for leftovers, everyone will want a second helping.

Don’t change a thing. This year I doubled the jello and strawberries and it wasn’t as good. My jello wasn’t set enough and it was a real mess. Also I think the strawberries were too large of pieces and weren’t totally thawed, releasing excess juice into jello overnight.

My family liked it very much.  For me,I added 3 table spoons of maple syrup instead of 1 cup of sugar and the same amount to the pretzels , because the jello is sweet and no need for more sugar. I used blue berries. .

Delicious & easy to make for the holidays! This is my favorite dessert. My grand mother started this dessert tradition in our family, and now I make it for everyone! I was out of whipped cream & all of the grocery stores were closed, so I made my own with heavy whipping cream. Even more satisfying!

If one follows the directions closely, AND seals all of the sides and corners with the cream cheese layer, AND chills each individual layer to set up,  there will not be a leaking incident. Use a good spatula to pack it in. Great recipe!

Beware! It takes much longer then 45 min to be ready. You have to let the jello set and that is going to take a couple hours minimum. I chilled the jello in the fridge prior to pouring it on top of the cream cheese. As I prepared this once before and it never set. It taste great  but takes a while to be ready to serve!

Very good! Easy to make. 

1. You can use a food processor for the pretzels, pulse until they are pinky nail sized pieces at least.
2. I used Snyder's gluten free pretzel sticks to accomodate my sister and they were very good, they stayed really crunchy.
3. Watch your crust carefully since the edges can burn a bit.
4. Make sure you seal the edges with the cream cheese mixture to keep the jello from leaking down and making your crust soggy.
5.I would prefer more crust so I think you could easily add an extra 25-50% and still have great results, you might need to bake it more though.
6. I added vanilla to my filling for one batch and did not like the results, there was already flavoring enough in the whipped topping. 

If you are wondering what the difference from "Judy's Strawberry Pretzel Salad" is, here you go:
Hers has:
25% less pretzels
150% more sugar in the crust
Double the cream cheese
20% less strawberries
I did not try her recipe so can't judge.

I love this dessert but it is way too sweet as written. I use unsweetened strawberries (fresh if you can get them), omit the sugar for the crust and only use 1/2 cup of sugar for the filling. I also cut the butter back to 1/2 cup.

I have actually been making this for a couple of years now. It is absolutely delicious (sweet and a bit of salty! Yum!) but my boyfriend absolutely LOVES this strawberry pretzel salad and can demolish the entire salad in one night haha! I ask him what he wants for his birthday....strawberry pretzel salad. Christmas? Strawberry pretzel salad. Columbus Day? He will use any excuse for me to whip one up for him! It is easy to make and sooooo good! Seriously!! Try it!!

I didn’t find frozen strawberries at the market so I bought whole fresh berries and cut them up. I froze them overnight so they were cold to go into the jello. Probably had more than twenty ounces. Received many compliments on it and have been asked for the recipe.

Love this recipe!  the key to success is to make sure to chill well between adding each layer. and as others have said make sure the cream cheese layer goes all the way to the edges so the jello doesn't seep down around it. The first time I made this I used only one 10 oz bag of frozen strawberries instead of two.  I think I like it better that way but that is just personal preference. I also cut the sugar in half in the cream cheese layer and it is still a nicely sweet dessert instead of sickeningly sweet.  again just personal preference!

I used butter pretzels for the crust so the buttery taste was awesome. My Ninja ground them up nicely. Not too fine, and not too coarse. 
I also made mine with raspberries and pomegranate. I let them partially thaw. 
My Jello called for 1 cup of boiling water per box but I used a total of 1 3/4 cups for both boxes before mixing in the frozen fruit.

I added a few pineapple tidbits with my strawberries. For some reason my jello didn't thicken. I ended up draining it off and just spread the strawberries around on top. Took it to a fourth of July outing and every last morsel was eaten! I will definitely make this again!

I have made a version of this many times and then I lost my recipe. I made only slight changes to this one based on my memory of the other recipe. I used powdered sugar instead of granulated and I only use 1/2 cup of sugar in the cream cheese layer. Delicious.

Strawberry Jello Pretzel salad has been a favorite of my family's since I was a kid growing up, now I get to make it. This is my favorite go to recipe. 

 I don't  measure the pretzels, just enough to cover the bottom so 2+cups. I use a cup of butter. I've found when making this, Refrigerate or even freeze the cream cheese whipped topping onto of the pretzel crust before adding the jello, this really prevents it from leaking down into the pretzel crust and making it soggy. I like to make mine with a few pretzel chunks along with the crumbs.  I also like to add other frozen berries to mine.

Thanks for the recipe! :)

The recipe tastes great but the cream cheese and cool whip layer did not seal. Even though while I was spreading the middle layer taking care to spread to the edges. Unfortunately, the jello layer seeped under which made the 2nd layer float. Does not look very appealing. Disappointed with the outcome especially since it was not a cheap desert.

this is incredible. We had it for Thanksgiving (unusual gelatin is a tradition), and it was a smash. The salty pretzel crust with it is just heavenly. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

I've made this over the years, but lost the recipe when I moved.  This recipe was just like it and turned out great!  I made sure to buy small pretzels twists (a little thicker than pretzel sticks) and instead of crushing them, I broke them into smaller pieces.  This helped the crust stay crunchy until the dessert was almost all eaten.  In the past, the crust would get soggy almost immediately, ruining it.  This dessert somehow became our Thanksgiving go-to.  It makes it so much easier to find the ingredients in the store at that busy time of year.  No going from store-to-store trying to find pumpkin pie mix, pie shells, etc...Plus it's not as expensive as the pecan pies I make. My family gobbled it up fast!

I accidentally bought one package of raspberries and one package of strawberries. I continued on with the recipe anyway and it was delicious!  My very finicky 11 year old son helped me make it and he loved it! I recommend watching the video before making it. I cooled the crust for 30 mins in the fridge  before adding the cream cheese layer. (Cover crust completely or strawberry mixture will seap through!)

This recipe tasted great.  I made one change: I used fresh strawberries, prepped, mashed a little, then  froze overnight.  In the future, I will try different crust: graham cracker or the vanilla wafers idea someone suggested.  I also will try powered sugar as someone had suggested.

This is very good! The  only thing I would suggest is to make sure your dish is deep enough for the second and third layer.
Mine wasn't and it ran over some.

A Thanksgiving  favorite every year. Definitely better to blend the cream cheese and cool whip mixture very well. Also, I didn't plan very well and ran out of time and so mine did not set up well before our Thanksgiving dinner so I would recommend making it the night before so it has plenty of time to firm up (ours was a little runny but still delicious!), it was better later that night after it had firmed up lol

I read 40 reviews of this dish before I made it.  I opted to add the brown sugar to the crust and only bake for 8 mins.  I made sure to spread the cream cheese all the way to the edges to create a seal.  The top layer, which should be easy, looks awful.  Tip#1 - if you make the jello layer and add frozen, sliced strawberries, DO NOT let sit for an hour before you spread on cream cheese layer - the jello will have gelled. Only let cool for about 15 mins in the fridge before pouring over cream cheese layer.  I am so sad to be taking this ugly dish to my relatives party today.  Tip#2 - always buy extra ingredients.  If I had, I would have remade the jello and tossed the original attempt.

I made this for work, because my coworkers like this type of thing.  It is like no-bake cheesecake, which is not as good as regular baked cheesecake. The comments were helpful (cool each layer before adding). The cheese layer must be room temp for spreading, so don’t do what I did: make it ahead of time and store it in the fridge.  Mix the cheese layer right before you need it..

This was really good and light tasting.  Great spring/summer dessert.  I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly.  I had everything on hand but pretzels so I used gram-crackers instead.  The rest I followed and it came out fantastic!  I had no problems with the jello slipping at all.  I used a spring form pan and it looked beautiful!  Thanks for the easy and lovely recipe!

It was a HIT with my family!  I made the recipe exactly as stated in regards to ingredients and amounts.  I only made the following 2 changes: 
1. I baked my crust for approx 12 minutes in hopes of a crisp pretzel crust...it worked!
2. I refrigerated the dish for approx 30 min after adding the cream cheese layer. 

I will definitely make this again, and again...

Turned out great! Really need to make sure you seal all holes and the sides up with the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture so the jello doesn't seep through.

This is a family favorite. I’ve been eating this dish since my childhood, now I make it for my children. It’s kind of time cosumimg to make asceach layer needs time to set.  I usually spread it out over the whole morning.  I have recentky altered it due to a strawberry allergy in the family,  using  Rasberry jello and frozen blueberries.  It was fantastic, maybe even better than the original .

Yummy!  Such a hit in our family, we made it for both the recent holidays! Make sure you follow the tip about the jello being the consistency of egg whites before putting it over the cream cheese. This last time I didn’t and it didn’t work as well. Still tasted good. :)

I finally made this as I heard others rave about it for years., I was not disappointed. Better the 2nd day. If I had one critique it would be lightly salted pretzels next time. But the salty/sweet combo was refreshing. A great summer cookout dish.

I make this exact receipe all the time and it is a family favorite.  I see how many people comment not to make with low fat cream cheese or sugar free jello because it will not turn out right.  I however, always do and it turns out perfect.  I use neufchatel cheese and after folding in the sugar free whipped topping, I put the mixture in the fridge to set for about 30 minutes while the crust cools.  I put the strawberry jello mixture in the freezer until it gets to a bit firmer than the egg white consistency and then spread the lumpy mixture on top of the cream cheese filling.  Let it set the rest of the way in the fridge for a couple of hours and it all comes together seamlessly!

This is a great dessert for those who like the sweet and salty combination. I don't understand why someone would want to change the crust. The salty pretzel crust is fabulous just the way it is!

I forgot the  frozen whip topping at the store but I had a can of whip cream so I used that! It was delicious!  The pretzel crust and cream cheese center really add dimensions to the jello.

When I made this recipe, instead of using frozen whipped topping, I used real whipped cream. I took heavy whipping cream and whisked it with a hand mixer for about 3 minutes until I had a thicker consistency. As other reviewers have noted, the gelatin "leaked" into the pretzel layer, making the appearance less than ideal. Still, the taste is a fantastic combination of salty and sweet.

I made this last night to have at lunch today.  Other than the ribs, it was the favorite dish at the get together. I may try it next time with less butter, but that's just because of calories.  It was delicious. It doesn't keep well due to softening pretzels, but we finished it off at dinner tonight so leftovers aren't an issue.  This recipe will be used again!

I made this for a cub scout banquet and it was GONE within a few minutes. I was worried some of the pickier eaters might not be interested in it and then I saw plates with this dessert heaped on. Make sure to crush the pretzels a little finer so there is plenty to go on the bottom of the pan. :)

This jello pretzel salad is a friends and family favorite. It works best for me with extra butter in the pretzel crust and baked 20 minutes in the oven instead of 8-10. Allow ample time to cool between layers for the perfect effect.

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is a family favorite.  However, when I make it I put the jello mixture in the pan first as the bottom layer, put it in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight and then spread the cream cheese cool whip mixture on top of the jello.  Sprinkle the pretzels on the top for a crunchy topping.  This guarantees that your jello mixture sets up properly.

I  mix chopped walnuts with the pretzels and it's awesome. I just make a 1/2 version of this recipe along with full recipe, instead of adding 1 cup more of pretzels I add 1 cup of chopped walnuts as well as halving all of the other ingredients and it's awesome!  I've tried making the basic version w/1/2 nuts and 1/2 pretzels but the" crust " doesn't  hold together as well. Nevertheless it's a holiday staple.

Quick and easy. But after a few tries I've made some small changes I feel improve the flavor and presentation.
I use less sugar (1tablespoon) and butter (1/2cup) for the crust, and add a tsp of salt. This increases the salt/sweet ratio for me. 
I also cut the sugar to a 1/2cup for the whip as well. It really doesn't need a whole cup to be really sweet.
Finally, I prefer 1 box of jello, and to slice the strawberries really thin. It has a nice look and evens out the topping to whip flavor in each bite.

This dessert was a huge hit on Christmas Eve. Three (3) cups of fresh strawberries with a about a teaspoon of sugar were used instead of frozen. I froze the diced strawberries in a flat dish. This helped set the Jell-O much faster. I refrigerated the cream cheese mixture until the Jell-O was ready which helped the Jell-O set better. The square butter pretzels worked well. Crush them pretty small...but not too small. The pretzels were still relatively crunchy two days later....not soggy at all. I will make this recipe again and again.

I have been making this for 10+ years and my mom has been making this for me since I was a baby (I am 28 yrs old). I don't change anything except the way I do it. You want to press the pretzels down with parchment paper to make it more compact like crust. The cream cheese I thaw out still in the aluminum packaging in warm/luke warm water so it will mix easily with the whipped cream. Mix the cream cheese with a hand mixer alone first before mixing in the whipped cream. I flash cool the pretzels after being in the oven for 10 min. After I layer the cream mixture on the cooled off pretzels I put it in the fridge overnight or you can put it in the freezer but keep an eye on it. After making the jello you want to make sure it is not anywhere near hot because it could seep through the middle layer and bond to your crust (which makes a really weird texture). I don't usually add any fruit but that's obviously optional :)

Will make again, but no cool whip. just add whipping cream to the cream cheese mixture and beat it, no major extra time. Puree frozen strawberries and use plain gelatin, stop taking shortcuts.

This is an awesome dessert but I think the 45 minute time was off. Like a few other commenters said, you should cool the pretzel bottom and cream cheese middle for awhile to harden so the jello won't seep through. I would also reccomend using the quick set option on the jello box because if not you will be waiting forever for your jello to reach that "egg yolk" consistency. Still really good and will make again with the tips and tricks I picked up this time.

Tastes great.  Looked horrible.  The pretzel crumbs didn't hold together.  The cream cheese & Cool Whip was too runny.  The jello was fine.  Serve it and it was a gigantic mess.

The recipe turned out well as written, however I had a couple pints of fresh strawberries so I had to make one modification.  When making the jello, I dissolved the gelatin completely with the two cups of boiling water but then I added in a large hands full of ice cubes to help it set faster before adding in my chilled strawberries.   It came out just fine and I also used slightly less sugar with the cream cheese.

I followed the recipe and a couple tips (added a couple ice cubes to help the jello set faster),  let the cream cheese layer cool in the fridge before adding the fruit on top, and spread the cream cheese all the way to the sides.  It turned out perfectly - no juices went to the bottom and the layers were great.  I thought it was good, but not great, only because it's REALLY sweet.  Next time I will serve much smaller portions, because cutting a 9x13 into 12 pieces was WAY too much.  24 servings from one pan will be better.

Awesome, simple dessert. However, you do not need that match sugar!! I keep it the same for the crust, but when beating the cream cheese, I use 1.5 cups (sometimes a little less) . Also I use low fat cool whip and its fine. ****Be sure to let middle layer set before throwing boiling water on it. Other than that, perfect recipe.

Since we watch our sugar here I only added 1/2 cup sugar to the cream cheese. I also used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese along with sugar free Cool Whip. I chilled each layer well before adding the next. I used an eight inch glass dish - it was full to the brim but it was delicious. It was sweet enough.

What a wonderful dessert salad! I used frozen unsweetened sliced strawberries (wasn't sure if I should use the kind in syrup or au natural, but this worked out well), one of each sugar-free and original strawberry gelatin, and substituted neufchatel (1/3 less fat) cheese for regular cream cheese to lighten it up a bit. This was a big hit at a potluck, though in the future I would make sure to bring it in a dish or container that is designed to stay cool. After sitting out for a while the gelatin got a bit runny and the presentation wasn't as pretty (though this did not affect the flavor). 

In the future I may try to freeze the pretzel crust & cream cheese/cool whip portion first, then add the gelatin and strawberries an hour or two before serving. I think the frozen middle will help it to stay pretty longer and add another texture. If it's a hot day, I may also place my 9x13 pay into a larger pan filled with ice to keep it cool & pretty.

Do make sure that the whipped topping cream cheese mixture  completely covers all the pretzel crust. If there are any gaps the gelatin will leak down into the pretzel crust and make it soggy.

The combination of sweet/creamy/salty is sure to please the palate. It's one of those dishes that even people who normally don't like jello will enjoy & go back for seconds!

Great! Only thing I did wrong was not to crush the pretzels enough. They were big chunks. Should have been a powder. Used fresh strawberries because they were cheaper  than frozen and no sugar. Excellent dish!

I followed the very nice tips from Sharon 2/27/2011. If anything different, I would buy sliced strawberries instead of whole. Recipe doesn't really indicate whether sliced/whole. I would prefer sliced, which I did by slightly thawing strawberries, slicing, then placing back in freezer until jello was ready.

Ah, wonderful.  Comfort food for any time of day for me.  I prefer this recipe as some call for 16 oz. of  cream cheese.  I used mostly Stevia instead of sugar, and cut the  total amount of sweetener by 1/3.

I'm not sure if giving this 5 stars is OK, as I didn't make the strawberry topping in the same way. I didn't want to have a Jello-like topping, so I just cut up the strawberries and sprinkled on a bit of sugar on them to create a "sauce". When serving, I put the strawberries on top as if it were shortcake. The crust and cream centers are completely delicious!! Best to eat fresh though because the pretzel crust got a bit soggy, as the days went by. Great recipe!

I found out that pineapple makes your jello not set (it says this on the box but I didn't bother to read it). I remade the dessert with only strawberries and it was delicious! Very well received amongst my coworkers. I made sure to chill each layer before adding on so it wasn't soggy or runny, and I made sure to spread the cream cheese mixture evenly and smooth to all edges so the jello did not seep through.

Excellent, this came out perfect! I mashed the pretzels up pretty good for the crust and did not bake it over 10 minutes. I added a tablespoon of Vanilla Extract to the cream cheese filling and fresh sliced strawberries to the jello. Will make again! Loved the crunch pretzel crust. I made it in a 8x11 pyrex dish.

Im not a big sweets person so this was a perfect dessert. Not too sweet not too salty! I did double it but didn't feel like it needed any additional sugar passed the original recipe. Very neat dessert!

I've been making this for years.  I never bake it.  I put it in the refrigerator after each layer.  I use 3 cups of coarsely broken up pretzels with no added butter or sugar.  My family and co-workers absolutely love this dessert/salad.

This dessert has been my favorite since childhood.  I made it for my Egyptian husband (instead of jello i used a kosher/halal gelatin) my husband loved it so much he ate almost the whole batch and he's not too fond of sweets in the first place! :)

I put as many  fresh strawberries as I could fit in the jello. That meant modifying the recipe and had to speed set the jello by putting in the freezer for about 15 min. Left some of the pretzels in bits for more texture. 
Took it to a party, it was eaten up quickly. Mostly by people coming back for seconds and thirds! 
Easy and kind of fun to make, plan on making again.

This is a great dessert that everybody loves.  The only change I made to it was increase the amount of pretzels used for the crust to between 2 1/2 - 3 cups and adjust other crust ingredients accordingly (sugar & butter).  Definitely a keeper!

I used pie filling instead of jello and mixed it with cinnamon and nutmeg to bring down the sweetness.  It was really good and not too sweet the sweet and salty combination was very satisfying.   It was a large amount so we couldn't eat it all therefore when I make it again I will half it up and give the other half to someone.

This tasted great, but I have trouble with sugar.  Next time, will use sugar free jello & whipped topping & cut back a bit on the sugar in the cream cheese layer.  Will make again!

I will make it again, it was my grandmother's favorite holiday treat.  My only change and suggestion is to put the Jello in the refrigerator until sets a little more, mine did not get to that 'egg white" texture with just the frozen strawberries and a couple ice cubes, so it ran down to the bottom layer a little. But my mom says that if you let It set a little longer first in the fridge it will help it remain on top :)

I love this recipe but I do like to use flipz white fudge covered pretzels instead. That way the dish doesn't get as soggy when preparing ahead of . This time when I'm making it I'm going to color dye the cream cheese layer green, so I have red,white, and green colors.

I have been making this for a long time and love it although I did make a few changes.
* I use one package of raspberry danish dessert instead of jello. It sets fine , and I like to flavor much better. you could do half dainish dessert and half jello. 
*  I use heavy cream in place of cool whip and add sugar to taste.  I am not a cool whip fan! It 's a great recipe either way so enjoy!

Great recipe!  I prefer to up the cream cheese to 1 1/2 sticks or 12oz, crumble the pretzel pieces, don't crush them to be really fine.  I've also found to help with the consistency keep it frozen after putting in the jello and strawberries and keep frozen until right before serving.

Fantastic dessert! Here are a few tips I've learned while making it:
1-Chop the frozen strawberries to bite size before putting in jello.
2-Spread the white filling all the way to the edges of the pan so the jello does not ooze down to the pretzel layer.
3-works really well with frozen rasperries and raspberry jello too. In fact, I prefer the raspberries because it gives a nice tart taste to the sweet and salty.

I give this a 3.5/5. Using a 9 x 13 inch dish was too big and would recommend using a smaller dish, I will use my 8X8 dish next time. Also I would double the crust next time as I like the pretzel crust very much. I would also increase the amount of strawberries. I did add the sugar slowly and titrated to taste. Otherwise a good base for this recipe and uses considerably less sugar than most recipes.

I do like this recipe so far, although it is still chilling in my fridge. I have not tasted the finished result yet. I  am bringing this to a Church potluck tomorrow. I wish the recipe was more specific about the pretzels. I measured 2 cups of pretzels and then crushed them in a ziplock bag. I wish that I would have known that I needed to measure 2 cups of crushed pretzels. I also recommend applying the cream cheese layer very gently, so the pretzel crust does not accidentally get "pulled" into the cream cheese/whipped cream. I will update my review tomorrow, after the potluck!!
   Update, everyone at my church potluck was raving about this!! It was a huge success, and I am changing my rating to 5 stars. This is a fun dessert to make with the perfect combination of salty and sweet. I love that this is not a heavy dessert!! It truly was delicious. This will be brought to many potlucks again in the future. Very happy with the finished result.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I was asked to make it again for Christmas dinner with our family (both mine and my hubbys) and the kids wanted it again for New Years! My mom has already asked me to make it for Easter :)

Very easy to make and was a big hit at our party. But Next time I make this, I will leave out the cup of sugar to the cream cheese and whipped topping. It was too sweet.

This recipe is the one I remember from when I was a kid. It is great! I didn't change a thing. Thank you for posting! Make sure you seal the edges though.... You will get a soggy crust from the jello.

Wow, loved this dessert. Although this was listed under quick and easy desserts it maybe easy but not so quick, we took other reviewers advice and made it in stages.
We did change up the frozen fruit and gelatine but that's the great thing about this dessert, "Change the fruit change the taste"
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used 1 bag of strawberries & 1 bag of blueberries for a 4th of july party. It was pretty & delicious! But it took longer than 1 hour for the Jello to completely set up more like 2 hours.

Wow!  Perfect summer recipe!  Made it this morning for a cookout this after noon.  Followed recipe exactly but I added blueberries on top just to make a red white and blue theme.  I don't think I let it set long enough though as the strawberry top was a tiny bit runny so next time I will make it the night before. EvEveryone loved it though, including myself :)  so easy to make and looked so pretty!   I will definitely make this again,  but as I mentioned, will do it the night before so it sets longer.  I was worried it wouldbe too heavy a dessert, but it was absolutely perfect!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My family lives this recipe.  I actually use fresh cut strawberries and freeze them instead of the packaged frozen strawberries.   I used the tips from others....Make sure the cream cheese mixture is sealed one the pretzels, refrigerated the cream cheese layer before adding the jello/strawberries.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe and a great dessert!  My only suggestion - if you want a thicker crust, I'd double the pretzels.  All of the other measurements and ingredients are right on!  Thank you BETILDA!

We really like the salty and sweet together.  I use sliced fresh berries and add them to the jello after it has set up a bit.  This keeps the jello mixture from making the crust soggy. I have used part Splenda, sugar free Jello, and lite Cool Whip and lower fat cream cheese without a problem. A little Cool Whip on top of each serving made a pretty presentation for my bridge club.

I made this yesterday, and it's even better the next day!
The pretzel crust and the cream cheese layer I made almost exactly as the recipe states -- the only difference is that I doubled the cream cheese layer because my baking dish was a bit taller.  I used mini pretzels that didn't seem to be quite as salty as regular-sized pretzels, so I felt like I didn't get quite the contrast between sweet and salty as when I've tried this dish in the past.  Really, the Jell-O layer is where you can put your own spin on this: I used a bag of frozen strawberries (thawed) and a can of crushed pineapple and I boiled the strawberry liquid along with the liquid from crushed pineapple to go in the gelatin. Also used one strawberry and one cherry Jell-O, which really gave it more of a "tart/sweet" flavor.  In the end, i'm glad I doubled the cream cheese layer, because the gelatin layer ended up being intensely concentrated, and I believe the larger cream cheese layer balanced that fruity flavor nicely.  I also pureed half of the strawberries to give a better overall texture, and placed the fruit in a bowl in the freezer to help it "gel" the gelatin quicker.   
I might be in the minority here, but in the past I've had this with the pretzel layer "soggy," and didn't really mind it. But again, that's a personal observation.

This is always a hit. We owned a restaurant for several years. Every Friday this was on the menu. I have made it 'quick' many times. I always let the jello get thick before putting it on. Yes, the crust will sometimes get soggy but we rarely had any left for Saturday serving. I read the one review that said they did not like the pretzels. I can't imagine! That is what makes it a taste sensation!

For those who found the jello layer to be runny ... The recipe I have only calls for 1cup of hot water for the jello layer and then add the frozen strawberries when the jello begins to set. And of course refrigerate between layers. The rest of the recipe was the same. Turned out great!

Super simple and tasty. I use fat free cream cheese and fat free cool whip and it comes out just fine (sorry, Paula Deen). I add pineapple but that's a personal choice. Also add some vanilla and brown sugar to the pretzel layer for the same reason.

I fixed this as a dessert for my son's wedding rehearsal dinner.  Everyone loved it!!!  I also used peach jello with fresh peaches and it was delicious as well.  This is a great summer dessert when you want something on the lighter side.

This is a delicious fruit salad! Definitely a keeper! For the pretzel crust, I lowered the heat to 340°F, as my oven tends to run a little hot. Be sure to use a good sharp knife or cake server when cutting the salad into serving size pieces. The crust is salty, buttery and crunchy ... perfect when combined with creamy and fruity. Yumm!

I was searching for this recipe. Someone from my family reunion had brought it. This is exactly what I was looking for! My only suggestion is make sure you have a group ready to eat. Because it's very easy to send the kids to bed and pig out on this dish!

I like to use strawberry-banana jello and sometimes even slice up a fresh banana and mix it in with the jello or throw on top of finished dessert.

everyone in my family liked a different layer of the salad, but didn't like the layers as a combination with each other.  To me, it was really sweet all over. I used a springform pan as someone had suggested, but the butter melted and seeped out of the pan and all over my oven!  never again.

Love, love, love this recipe!  Made it for my monthly Bunco party and every member enjoyed every bite!  I took the advice of Jenna Everhart from her Dec 20, 2003 post and my strawberry pretzel salad/dessert was perfect!  When I check out a recipe I usually read the reviews also.  Thanks!

I have to say this was pretty good. Although I didn't use pretzels. I ended up getting chocolate covered granola for the base, and used fresh strawberries. But I don't think it detracted from the point. It was light, yet sweet and a lovely cool food desert. Keepin' the recipe for sure.

I have made this recipe for years and it is a must have at all our holiday meals. I use pineapple juice instead of water in the jello and I add a tablespoon or two of pineapple juice to the cream cheese mixture to make it spreadable. After adding the cream cheese mixture to the pretzle layer I pop it in the freezer until firm before adding the cooled jello layer.

Today is the day before Thanksgiving. I am sitting here making all the deserts for tomorrow. I always make this but I forgot how much butter goes in the crust. I was reading the ingredients and I almost died with how much sugar they use. I am a diabetic so I only use 1 cup to 1 and forth cup. It is sweet enough. But try it before you pack all that sugar on it. You also got to relieve the jellos and strawberries add some more sweetness to it.

This is always a favorite at all my parties, but instead of cream cheese I use plain greek yogurt mixed with a little more sugar. Amazing turnout!!!

This dessert is fantastic!!  I have been making it for many, many years and it still seems "fresh" and new every time. I love the contrast of the salt and the sugar in the crust and with fresh in-season strawberries, you can't go wrong. Make it and enjoy!!!!

Sooooo Good! My husband and guy friend absolutely love this dessert! We opted to use fresh strawberries, organic butter, organic sugar, and omitted the gelatin. We used sour dough pretzels that I loosely crushed which our friend mistook for walnuts--try it, this is a winner!

WOW!!!! I almost don't know what else to say! This is an outstanding recipe. Instead of pretzels, I used graham crackers. I crushed them all up by hand,(ouch!! I would definitely recommend a food processor or something of the sort) and I added some chopped pecans to the crust also. I made this for the first time yesterday, and had my mother-in-law over for dinner and her and my husband were crazy about it and so was I!!! Makes a great summer dessert! Thanks for sharing!

It turned out great.  I was in a rush for it to set so I sat it in the deep freeze, which worked great.  The recipe didn't call for sliced strawberries, but it helps keep the bites more uniform. I also substituted Splenda for some of the sugar in the cream mixture and didn't miss the sugar at all.

This was very easy to make.   I used fresh strawberries and added them to the jello mixture after the mixture had cooled a little bit so that the berries didn't start to cook.

The only thing I did different for this recipe because I was short on time I used a chocolate already made crust instead of the pretzel crust.  I got some many great compliments.  I have given my sister the recipe because she liked it so much.

This was fun to make with the kids... very easy and they enjoyed helping.  The crust and the middle was good, however...  the top was not at all.  We didn't like the idea of whole strawberries, so we mashed them up which made it better, but out of 6 of us, only 2 liked the dessert as a whole.  I think, for us, it was just a weird combination.  I'm sorry.  I think with a different topping...?  Thanks for the recipe, though.

I love this recipe, and get requests for it all the time!  I've substituted frozen blueberries or cherries (with corresponding Jello flavors) when people have strawberry allergies, and it still turns out fantastic.  I agree with the other posters that you need to be sure to spread the cream cheese layer to "seal" the edges of the dish so that the fruit and Jello doesn't seep and make the crust soggy.

Family loved this dessert at a BBQ we had. Used gluten free pretzels so every one could eat it. Will make again!

We have had this salad at parties before, but just made it yesterday for the first time.  I misread the amount of strawberries and only had one package, but it still came out delicious.  The sweet and salty combination is so addictive!  Very pretty and once it's set looks like it travels well for carry-ins and potlucks.  Thanks for sharing!  I'm eating another large helping as I write!

This one never fails to please at our family gatherings.  Friends and family who have never had it wonder what the crust is--nuts?  No, pretzels!  The combinations of sweet, salty and creamy make this dessert fun to eat.

The topping and the cream cheese is the only thing we really liked. We felt that the pretzel crust really didn't work well with the rest. An unusual combo.

This dessert rocks!!  I have changed it up by using different crusts such as short bread and waffer cookies and it still tastes wonderful.

This is pretty close to the recipe I've been making for about 15yrs, but lost in our move... I increase the pretzel crust ingredients for a thicker crust as well as use butter pretzels instead of regular pretzels, and decrease the whipped cream for more of a cream cheesy taste and texture. I like to add blueberries for a "Red, White, and Blue" theme, and make on the 4th. Certainly a classic in my books!

Absolutely AWESOME! It was the hit of the party. I did actually use a food processor for the pretzels - just to get them in smaller pieces. Only do it for a 5 seconds at a time, you dont want the pretzels to be powdery. I also only found a 16oz bag of frozen strawberries - which was more than plenty. I cut them up into smaller pieces. But other than that - it was PERFECT! My biggest success to date.

I love pretzel salad, and this is a good and easy recipe.  I did have to double the filling to get a good seal on all the edges of my 9 x 13 pan.

This was incredible. I accidently made the jello according to the box so I added more water than I should have...it still turned out really good and I can't wait to make it again. My Husband about killed the 9x13 pan all by himself.

Read other cooks reviews before making this recipe. Loved the taste, which was much different than expected - great idea mixing salt and sweet together. Instead of using white sugar, I substituted it with Altern (WalMart-brand) sugar. Rather than use frozen strawberries, I sliced fresh ones. Was disappointed that the pretzels did not form a crust during cooling process - it looked great in the glass dish before it went into the frig. I may use more butter next time. Pretzel crust was more like powder - a friend solved that. He turned the pretzel crust upside down instead of putting it on the dish. The pretzel powder covered the rest of the dessert; great taste, he said. After making the second time, I will come back and give another review.

I didn't like how thick the jello actually is on top and I didn't like the frozen strawberries.  Next time I'll probably use about half the jello and slice up fresh strawberries.

This was good, but im not sure what happened....my jello topping seemed kinda runny, had a hard time cutting in without it being kind of sloppy. It was still tasty, just not the big hit i was going for.

I took this to a picnic tonight and came home with an empty dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except (after reading other reviews) I chilled the jello/frozen strawberry mixture in the refrigerator for an hour after I combined them.  That was too long and the mixture was completely set.  I had to stir up the jello before pouring it over the cream cheese layer so it was not a smooth, pretty layer.  Still looked OK and tasted great however.  I used low fat whipped topping with no problems and plan to use low fat cream cheese the next time.

Very good, not to mention very easy!  It does take a little time until it's ready to eat, but worth it!  I used one package strawberry and one strawberry banana; if I make this again I might increase the jello to 3 packages.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good...this is one of the best desserts I've ever had, we doubled the amount of jello on the top...but while you're at it, go ahead and double the  whole recipe! :)
You won't regret it!!!

A friend of mine made this for me, and I thought gross based on the description.  However, this is AMAZING.  I have made it three times since then.  The only thing I do differently is add two containers of frozen strawberries, as I like a lot of them.

I made this for Easter lunch and it turned out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it. Others said not to make it the night before because it would be soggy but mine wasn't at all and will make it always the night before to allow extra time to set and for convenience. Thanks for sharing.

I have always loved this dessert!  I hate jello, this is the only way I will eat it.  Just make sure you eat this the same day that you make it because the pretzel base will get soggy after about a day.  We never have any leftovers though, so it's not a problem!

Wonderful recipe.  This recipe has been in my family for about 6 years.  I love it everytime I have it.  My grandmother use to fix.  She passed away a few years ago, but I still make it like she does.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it!  I was expecting to take home leftovers, but there wasn't a pretzel crumb left.  Oh well, I guess I'll make two next time!

This was a very good dish. Yes, it is a little on the fattening side, but it is worth it!!We served it as a side dish at Thanksgiving since we had so many deserts!!

I don't care for pretzels, usually, but in this case I make an exception.  The pretzels add a salty taste quite unique.  I will be making this recipe again and again!! Thanks.
