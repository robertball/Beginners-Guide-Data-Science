Tastey & easy. Instructions didn't say to grease the pan, so it stuck. Next time I'll know better.

This has definite possibilities but I'm going to tweak it a bit.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar & added raisons instead of the dried cranberries (so there'd be no extra sugar).  Next time, I'm going to spray the pan with PAM, increase the applesauce (I used unsweetened) to 1/2 cup, increase the Splenda added to the mixture to 1/3 cup, & decrease the amount of Splenda & cinnamon used in the topping.  I also will bake it for at least an hour as the apples weren't soft after 45 minutes.  I'm also going to use whole wheat matzah.

Made it last night for the sedar. It was wonderful. I did substitute raisins for the dried cranberries. I doubled the reicpe so I'd have some left over for tonight. Great

Great tasting side dish or dessert!  It was simple to make and bake!  I loved the fact that it was a low fat - low calorie dish that didn't taste low in fat and calories!  Good addition to any dinner meal!  I used Gala apples in mine and adjusted the recipe to yield 12 servings and baked it in a oval baking dish!

Very good, especially for a Passover recipe.  Used 2 very large apples and raisins instead of cranberries.

Two years in a row, I've been the star of both seders and chavurah (friends) gatherings with this simple but utterly delicious recipe!!  It is a teen favorite too, and can cross over to dessert as well as entree.  Very healthy too. One of the most successful matzo recipes ever!!

Made this Tues. It went over so well that I had to make another one right there and then- everyone was willing to wait for another piece- this was a crowd of people who watch their weight so I substituted the baking form of splenda and sugar free applesauce also spread a thin layer of  applesauce on top and left out the cranberries I also put 2 tablespoons of potato flour to make it a more firm texture i made it to serve 15 and did not have enough!!!Even the kids loved it

Excellent recipe!  I usually don't enjoy kugel, but I found this recipe to be quite tasty.  I used only 3 matzo crackers, and crushed the heck out of them.  The dish was moist, sweet and delicious.

This is a wonderful kugel. I have been making it for years. I always have an interfaith seder and even the non-jewish participants liked it and asked for the recipe. I highly recomend this dish.

This is a very similar recipe to one my mother makes. However, it is possible to find kosher for passover wide noodles and substitute for the matzah for a more "real" kugel texture and taste. Either way, a variation of this recipe is served at our seder every year, and always goes over very well.

This is a keeper.  I did use matzo farfall instead of breaking up the matzah.  Everyone at the seder liked it and now this will be the recipe I keep!

This was good! I cut way back on the sugar, per the other reviews, and used raisins instead. Everyone at the seder loved it. I think, next time, I will bake it in a 9x13, so it's a little thinner and crispier. This was very soft, which is fine, but I like a crispy kugel!

I brought this to a Seder potluck dinner, it went over pretty well.  It was something sweet, but different than the usual desserts.  It was also pretty easy to make and smelled wonderful :)

This was delicious! I used less salt than called for and the result was excellent. I agree with the other reviewers and will spray the pan next time with a non stick spray.

I made this for Passover the other night. I doubled the recipe and put into a 3 quart dish. The apples were a bit of a pain to chop, but the recipe turned out wonderful. The entire family loved it and my grandmother told me it was the only good Passover kugel she has ever had! Thanks!

Very hearty, and fits in with our house's desert favorites. As a dairy variant, I created tried adding about 1/3 cup of shredded sharp cheddar, which was excellent!

Was very tasty. I agree with the user that recommended using more of the sugar in the kugel mix and less on top. I also needed to bake mine as extra 10 mintues.  But my family loved it and it will become a Pesach staple in my house!

This was a huge hit for my Passover seder. I used raisins instead of the dried cranberries though. Everyone raved about this and I will probably use this recipe whenever I need a kugel- not just for Passover!

My family thought this was great - even the kids.  It is a sweet dish so keep that in mind.  I used unsweetened applesauce and it was still sweet enough.

Made this for 2 passover dinners and guests at both loved it and asked for the recipe. I used raisins instead of cranberries and a bit less sugar on the top than what was called for. It is really more of a dessert than a dinner item- almost a matzo bread pudding. Very, very easy to make.

I reluctantly tried this because I had most of the ingredients (not matzo crackers) for a last minute brunch.  It turned out fabulous and made my kitchen smell so wonderful.  As for changes, I used regular crackers and grahams instead of matzo (not sure even what matzo are - perhaps unleavened?).  I also used one pear and two apples to switch up the flavor.  It took a bit of time to peel and core the fruit, but was otherwise extremely easy.  Next time I will add a few nuts as well.  Thank you for a new and interesting recipe to add to my "brunch favorites."

It turned out great.  I just wondered why the salt says 1 teaspoon, divided.  I only saw it once so I cut the quantity in half.

I did not have the Matzo Crackers; however, I had Ritz Whole Wheat and replaced 8 crackers for one Matzo cracker and use whole cranberries.  It was a hit, a very light desert and complimented a Holiday Dinner party perfectly!

We love this kugel.  Key is not to add too many apples as it falls apart so if apples are too big, I add 2 instead of 3.

After reading some of the reviews, I realized this may be too sweet for my family. So I added only half the sugar and added more raisins. Next time I make this and there will be a next time. I will add a bit more sugar and definitely more cinnamon. Very enjoyable!!

Really fantastic recipe-- I didn't change a thing (for once) and it turned out perfectly! I served it with some vanilla ice cream and it was fabulous. I shared with several friends who had never had kugel before and they loved it!

Very tasty! I wanted a more solid consistency though, so I will try adding in another egg or two next time. I used the dried fruit I had handy, so substituted apricots and prunes for the cranberries.
