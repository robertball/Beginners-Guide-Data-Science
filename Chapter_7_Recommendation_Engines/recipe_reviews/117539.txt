My hubby doesn't like apples in non-desert food so I skipped that but I think raisins would be better than apples. Found the curry flavor very bland so tripled it and added a two dashes each of cinnamon, cumin and chili powder.  Also substituted low fat coconut milk for the regular low fat milk, tasted more like curry and added a few carrots to the mix.

This recipe has a lot of potential when the changes that others mentioned are made, and my rating is for the tweaked version.  I doubled the curry powder, and added 2 cloves of garlic, mushrooms, carrots, cranberries, salt, pepper, and the spices recommended by others, apart from the extra chilli. I added a splash of soy sauce at the end, too. It turned out beautifully.   I think it would probably go better again (although would require a little more work) by frying up the spices, onions, garlic and chicken before popping them in the slow cooker.   I noted someone was concerned about too much liquid in the final result. The apples do release a lot as they cook, so I decided to eliminate the milk, which can separate in slow cooking, by adding a 50g sachet of powdered coconut milk to the stock, which I made up with a full teaspoon of powder in a cup of boiling water.  This was great. :-)

Followed recipe exactly.  Really lacks flavor.  Next time would motify with more seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic cloves, and herbs.  Mushrooms would also be a good addition.

Really good. I enjoyed this meal with the additions of carrots instead of celery, cranraisins for color and tartness (put in just a few minutes before serving) and the additional spices of cumin, cinnamon and chili powder that another reviewer recommended. Also, for some texture, I didn't add the apples at the beginning but rather about half way through. I also used yogurt instead of milk. I served it with baked potatoes. The one thing that I don't like is that there seems to be more liquid left over than one may expect - but it still tastes really good and has some really unique and different flavor combos.

Really liked this recipe, however I added some extra quinoa and a touch of lemon juice.  Served it with plain yogurt.  Next time I may add some raisins too.

I tripled the curry and added garam marsala which I believ to be the wonder spice of eastern food. Delish!!!

Four stars after the modifications. I listened to other reviewers and doubled the spices/added cinnamon, curry, chili powder and garlic. I omitted the apples and replaced them with potatoes. I also doubled the grains. Very tasty end result!

SUGGESTIONS: Double all spices and add cinnamon, cumin, garlic and salt. Omit the apples and double the amount of quinoa. Add carrots.

Based on the other reviews I was already planning on greatly increasing the amount of curry.  But, when I started throwing things in the crock pot, I realized that I was almost out of curry!  So I used huge amounts of all of the spices listed on the curry container, and was glad I did.  I will agree that the apples seemed out of place and would use potatoes instead if I fixed this again, and would also add raisins for extra flavor.  I also added well over the amounts of carrots and celery, and was glad for the color.  Since the other reviews said that it was watery, I used double the amount of grain, which worked out well.

This was okay.  With my changes, I would have given it 4 stars, but as written, it's only 3.  I added cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, garlic cloves and carrots.  The leftovers the next day were better then the first day.  The quinoa must have soaked in all the favors by then.

Like others I doubled the curry and quinoa, and used coconut milk instead of milk.  I exchanged the apple for dried cranberries because that's what I had.  It was a delicious meal to come home to!  Very moist, definitely not dry.  Was able to take the 2/3 cup quinoa and still be moist.  I am always looking for good, real food, crock pot recipes (no canned soups or mixes, etc....)  Will make again, maybe trying the apples next time.

I found this very watery, even though I used greek yogurt instead of the milk.  Also thought the flavor was bland.

Added sweet potato instead of celery, and coconut milk instead of milk, and threw in some fresh red pepper. Also a sprinkle of nutmeg.

Even after adding the additional spices suggested by other reviewers, this dish was completely bland.  I could taste the heat of the curry in the quinoa, but the chicken was completely dry and had no flavor.

really enjoyed this dish. I liked the apples. I did add carrots and used coconut milk and will add raisins next time. I have very strong curry I got in South Africa and the alloted amount was plenty strong, and i like strong curry. I will do this again and will try it without chicken and add vegetables to make a side dish.

I loved the idea but also read other viewers comments before making. Increased the Curry to 3T, added 1T Garam Masala and a dash of Paprika. Instead of apples put a couple handfuls of Cranberries at the beggining and a couple at the end. I would agree with another reviewer on roasting the onions and garlic first, I will defiantly do this next time but add some pine nuts. I used a full can of cocunut milk but also put about a cup of quinoa in the end. Will continue to make this recipe and tweek everytime. Also will not add carrots next time because they were still hard in the end.

Easy to make, really moist chicken, my family (young kids) loved it! Added a bit of garam masala, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper for extra zip. Forgot to add some fresh spinach at the end. Overall, a healthy, low fat, and nicely balanced dish.

I was expecting more flavor.  I found it very bland.  I think I will try it again and maybe double up on the curry and paprika.

This turned out pretty good.  I increased the curry seasoning to 3tbsp (the only change I made) and it was still a pretty mild flavor, although good.  It was not as hearty as I thought it would be.  Maybe I didn't use enough chicken, but I would serve it with whole wheat bread or something else on the side next time.

This is really yummy and easy with a few tweaks.  I used coconut milk instead of nonfat milk.  Used chicken thighs for tenderness and more nutrition.  I also added a big squirt of agave nectar and extra curry.  YUM

VERY bland.  Like others, I had to add tons of spices to get any flavor at all.  The apples were unrecognizable and flavorless because they had cooked so much.  I have to give it a 2 as written because of all the additions I had to make to make it palatable.

I used bone in chicken breasts, left out the milk because I didn't want it to be too liquidy, used half raisins/half granny smith diced apple chunks and 4 coarsly chopped carrots. I didn't use the quinoa because I had quite a bit of cooked basmati rice to use up so I threw that in for the last hour (on the warm setting). The chicken was unbelievably tender and the flavour was really delicious and mild. Next time, I will definitely feel confident enough to triple the curry powder and add the chili powder that another reviewer recommended. This is a keeper for me.

I followed the recipe and it was so bland and watery that we tossed everything but the chicken, added a Caribbean jerk marinade and put it over rice just to not waste the chicken.

It really needs a sauce to go with it. Comes out too dry, imo.

very bland.  couldn't taste curry or apple.  Quinoa sucked up all the sauce.  I would use coconut milk instead of milk and add raisins and more curry powder if I were to make it again which I won't.

4 stars for the revised recipe. I swapped celery for a yellow bell pepper, and doubled the quinoa and broth. I added a half tsp garam masala, dash cinnamon, and dash cumin. Subbed full fat coconut milk for the skim milk. It's delicious! Tangy and flavorful. I'd probably add cayenne pepper and a lot of black pepper if I didn't have a toddler who's going to be eating it too.

I added more curry and used smoked paprika since most reviews said increase the spice. I used coconut milk for the milk. I added a bunch of shredded carrot as well. This was quick and easy and was delicious.

I followed the advice of other reviewers to up the spices, but it still didn't help. The apples definitely didn't add anything.

Curry flavors were good after we doubled it, added salt, pepper, garlic and red pepper flakes. BUT  it was mushy and not very appealing . Will not make again. Might be better on rice instead of quinoa to give it more body.

Very tasty once I made the spice adjustments as recommended in other posts. I doubled the quinoa, used chicken thighs, and added carrots, yellow and orange peppers, and a handfull of raisins. I kept in the apple as I have always used apple in my curry.  Will definitely make again.

I had to change a few ingredients so it tasted the way I wanted it to. I like green curry, so I used green curry paste instead of curry seasoning, omitted the apples and added turmeric and red pepper flakes. I also used almond milk, but I think coconut would have been better. This gave it more of a Thai flavor which I like.

I like how the apples pare with the celery in this recipe, but a minimum of 3 times as much curry needs to be used in the recipe. Even with that carrots need to be added too in order to get the texture right. If those changes are made it makes the recipe good, but recipe is bland and only okay without the changes.

I should have read the reviews before cooking this-- I found it really lacking in flavor and in need of more seasoning.  There are some good flavors in it, so upping the seasoning would probably make a huge difference.  I would probably use a bit more quinoa too

It didn't have much flavor.  My husband and kids didn't like it at all.
