Like the recipe but too many steps.  No need to skillet saute.  Boil them then coat with butter then roast in oven.  The oven will do the browning.

I'm a big fan of Brussels sprouts when I eat out so I wanted to see if I could create the same taste and texture at home. As usual, chef john's version didn't disappoint -- easy and delicious.

Absolutely loved it. I just left em in the oven longer because I like the taste of it when they're more browned. Will make again!

How do I rate a recipe for Brussels sprouts?  I tried this recipe because like another reviewer, my childhood experience with them was traumatizing and after fifty-seven years, now that I'm all grown up, time to try again.  At seven, I felt betrayed by Brussels sprouts.  I was told that we are having Brussels sprouts and they were one of my Grandma's favorites.  Then they arrived at the table looking like cute miniature cabbages.  What's not to like?  Well you know what happened!!! One bite, one bitter, probably over-boiled bite.  LOL.  I made this per the recipe except that I steamed the sprouts and shallots (couldn't find the cipollinis) in the skillet instead of boiling each separately, drained, put the skillet back on the burner for a few seconds to evaporate any water left in the bottom of the pan, added the butter, and proceeded per the recipe. I can safely say that they were the best Brussels sprouts I've ever eaten = ) I am giving five stars; I think this is a great recipe and method for cooking these little gems...but not sure I'm a convert!

Holy cow.  My childhood experience with sprouts was traumatizing.  I'm really glad I tried this.  I only had a "garlic and herb" butter available in my fridge, but it turned out to be a nice addition.  Thanks, Chef John.  Another great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. I wondered about all the steps until I put my cast iron skillet in the oven and heard the sizzling happening right away. They came out nicely browned and so yummy! Thank you for an awesome recipe.

Only 3 out of 9 at our picnic that like Brussel sprouts, but all 3 of us agree this is the best we ever ate.  Made them exactly as the recipe.  Can't wait to buy more fresh Brussel sprouts.

Made this for Easter dinner last night and have to tell you Chef John, these are amazing.  My husband and I love brussel sprouts and I usually steam them but with the quick boiling and putting them in cold water really made them firm when you fried them.  I don't know what cipollini onions are so I used pearl onions.  I did not put them in the oven as I had too much other stuff in there.  I drizzled fresh lemon juice just before serving...amazing thanks.

I've liked other recipes by Chef John but I felt that these sprouts were lacking something and were too complicated for the end result. I'll definitely try more of his recipes but not this one again.

This is the first time that I have rated a recipe although I have been using allrecipes for several years.  I have also recently discovered Chef John.  He is fabulous!  I followed this recipe exactly except I added some fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top before putting in the oven to roast. I also coarsely chopped a regular onion as that was all I had.  Just delicious.  My husband and I loved them. Will try with pearl onions next time. This is a five star recipe.

This is such a wonderful recipe! Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone asked me to make again for Xmas. None left to take home! Second time I made it, I saut√©ed in some  bacon grease (reduced butter) and crumbled the crispy bacon into the pan before placing in oven. It was a hit, Yummy!

Like others I had brussel sprouts in restaurants and they tasted fine.  The onions separate this recipe from the rest.  I didn't have the cipollini onions--just some pearl onions frozen.  I took some other reviewer's suggestion (from another brus sprts recipe) and just steamed the veggies first.  In my case also because I was using frozen onions.  
I liked mine 'greasy'.  But I eat 90% paleo-style and extra fat is not an issue as I'm very healthy.  
Today I'm using a regular yellow onion and will update on the results some other time.

Wonderful!  Yes, lots of steps, but easy, simple steps to follow while you're preparing the main dish.  I used pearl onions, which are already perfectly bite-sized.  I personally was never a fan of this veggie, and have only recently tried them "steamed in a bag", but buying them fresh (which I usually do with all my vegetables) and trying this recipe was totally worth it!

We have been enjoying the taste of a variety of roasted vegetable and this is our new favorite.  Did not saut√© s as suggested, however made sure that they were dry before covering with olive oil.  Used cauliflower instead of the onions and  used preserved lemon rind instead of fresh.  Thank you for this brussel spouts cooking lesson chef John.

Flavors were nice, problem was getting them browned without turning them to mush. I think they need to be thoroughly dried, and maybe parboiled less. It was a lot of fussing with 2 different boils, ice bath, sauteing, roasting... think I'll just make Chef John's duck fat roasted brussels spouts next time, easier and delicious.

I followed the recipe as written but used four small yellow 
onions as I had them on hand. Still was very tasty and I will
be cooking brussels sprouts this way again.

I skipped the oven and only boiled and fried in butter on the stove.  Added salt to the water that I boiled the brussel sprouts in and they were delicious!

I skipped the step of blanching the Brussel Sprouts - they still turned out very nice. Served them with roasted chopped nuts as a vegetarian meal, will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe except i had to add some flavor to it, i added onion powder, some garlic powder, and a touch of rosemarry. They were tender and just right.Even the children liked them with the mini onions.

Wow, this was truly amazing.  I followed directions until it said to put the pan in the oven.  I don‚Äôt have a pan that I can put in the oven without killing it so I tossed everything onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  20 minutes later I had roasted Brussels sprouts that were cooked through and so flavorful.  Also, my onions didn‚Äôt burn to a crisp using this method.  Before this recipe, my onions were crispy critters and the Brussels sprouts were a little on the crunchy aside.  But no more!  This recipe....it‚Äôs a keeper for sure!

Perfect brussel sprouts. Do yourself a favor: when you saut√© the sprouts, do it in a ovenproof pan and then throw the whole thing in the oven - ultra  easy. These are so buttery and delicious that it feels like a guilty pleasure... until you remember how nutritious it is. :)

Husband and I loved this! I don't hate boiled/steamed Brussel sprouts, but I prefer them roasted. My husband will eat them, but not a big fan either way. Cooking them as directed  creates a soft-textured inside and brown outside with a velvety butter flavor. Yum! Best ever!

I only used the brussel sprouts so I omitted steps 3 & 4. After boiling the brussels for 2 min, I drained and patted dry (no ice bath) and tossed in some olive oil, season salt, pepper and baked in the oven for 20 min! It turned out GREAT! I had a teenager who hated brussel sprouts going back for seconds!! This recipe only took about 30 min from start to finish! (I was under the gun bc I botched my timing of dinner!)

The onions are nice but expensive addition. Lemon is different. But the Brussies were too soft, suggest skipping their parboiling step completely.

At first I was going to complain because peeling and cleaning the little onions is a pain.  However.  The finished product is amazing!! I halved the recipe for two of us but we could have easily eaten more.  Followed the recipe exactly otherwise.

These were fantastic. I substituted a regular onion because I already had it at home and it still turned out great (but since the pieces of onion were smaller, I decided not to boil them - I only sauteed them in the butter for a few minutes before adding the sprouts at the end). 
Boiling the brussel sprouts first really helps keep them moist while cooking. I had struggled in the past with brussel sprouts drying out too much when cooking them completely in the oven. This did the trick! 
Also, by cutting them in half, the first layer of leaves fell off the outside which was fantastic because these individual leaves browned in the oven and I ended up with brussel sprouts mixed with crispy brussel sprout "chips". Absolutely delicious!

These are wonderful!  I followed the recipe and procedure with one exception: I don't use butter much, so I tossed the sprouts and onions in olive oil, instead.  Excellent!  Caramelized, sweet, and crispy.

Yet another amazing Chef John recipe!  Served these at a dinner party and they were a huge hit.  Delicious exactly as the recipe called out - no need to add or enhance.  BTW, find those cipollini onions!  They are the sweetest tasting onion ever!  I prepared Chef John's Baked Lemon Pepper Salmon which was the best salmon dish anyone at the table had ever eater.  Try pairing these two recipes for a wonderful meal.

This worked very well for me.  The sprouts were tender without being mushy and the sprout eaters in the family liked the dish.  Of course, not everyone likes sprouts, even if they are done to perfection.  I have never remembered to garnish with lemon, and I don't think it is required.

Yum! I've always loved Brussels sprouts; they're one of my fav's! This was delicious. However, I couldn't get the non-eaters to even try it. Boo! They totally missed out. They were great.

I had boiled Brussels sprouts once as a kid and hated them. I decided to give them another go, roasted this time, and these were fantastic! I added a sprinkle of garlic powder to mine. Will definitely make again.

Awesome.  I am one of those who thought she did not like brussels sprouts.  Now am buying a lot since I can find them fresh in the grocery stores.  I have tried several recipes and have enjoyed all.
