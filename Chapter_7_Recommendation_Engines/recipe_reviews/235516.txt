Had to use leftover cranberries from the holidays, so I made a lot of substitutions - didn’t want to make a special trip to store. It turned out fabulous - family loved it! Used 1Tbsp red pepper flakes for jalapeño; used diced 1/2 small red onion for green onions; used cider vinegar for red wine vinegar; reduced sugar to 1/4 cup; added 1Tbsp avocado oil and cilantro as garnish.Turned out fresh, just the right zip,  flavorful. Used on grilled chicken breast and tasted gourmet! Family wants it more often!

I doubled all the ingredients for a party of 8.  This salsa was the perfect mixture of spicy and sweet. I recommend making it for a Thanksgiving  app.

Very good. A bit different. Got lots of compliments.
