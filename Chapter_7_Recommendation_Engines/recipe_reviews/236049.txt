My husband loves casseroles, so I tried this for dinner last night.  It was wonderful -- everything you need in one dish.  I used white basmati rice, and a 12 oz. boneless skinless chicken breast (pan cooked).  Most of the ingredients are things I already keep in stock, so didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  The different flavors came through, and it was also visually appealing.  I just served it with a green salad.  Definitely will prepare this again.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was AMAZING. Everyone loved it (including some picky adults and kids). I used rotisserie chicken and jasmine rice (based on other reviews). I substituted peas for mushrooms (due to allergy). It was easy to throw together and can be prepped in advance. It looked colorful and beautiful! YUM!

This was so delicious! I made the chicken fresh and used jasmine rice made in chicken broth for some extra flavour. Havarti replaced the parmesan since I was out. My family, including the twin four year olds, loved it!

It was very, very bland. The texture also left much to be desired. While I enjoy casseroles, this one has an especially mushy texture. I tried the recipe a second time to amp up the flavor with different spices, but I just couldn't get past the texture issue the second time around. I won't be making this recipe again.

It was delicious!  I had leftover rotisserie chicken and fresh spinach.  Had frozen yellow, green and red (sweet)peppers and used brown rice. I also added a touch of red crushed pepper.  The last 10 minutes I put some mozzarella cheese over top. I will be making this again. ..the best part? ...i had everything and it didn't require a trip to the store...and super easy to make.  Served with garlic bread....yum, yum!

I omitted the peppers because I forgot to buy them at the store. I used fresh spinach and cooked and diced my own chicken breast. It was delicious.

I made a couple changes as my husband doesn't like mushrooms but otherwise we really liked it! I will probably try a few more spices and change up the cheese next time but overall, this will become a regularly served dish.

It sounded wonderful but I made a few changes.  I used 1 full onion, added almost 2 cups broccoli, used Poultry seasoning instead of thyme or marjoram, used 3/4 of the bagged 8 oz spinach (where you get the premixed slaw), used the meat from a cooked rotisserie chicken from the store, & added fresh chopped bacon.  The flavor needs a little more.  I am going to add more clove of garlic, use 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, & 1/2 tsp pepper.  I love green onions so I am going to add some to the next attempt.

My husband hates mushroom so I switched it for zucchini. I also used fresh vegetables and chicken instead of frozen or already cooked. I added extra garlic and while the sauce was thickening I added a bit if hot sauce, about a tbls. It doesn't add spice but a really nice addition of flavor! Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty precisely! So good!

This is was a good start but could be excellent with the right changes I think. I used fresh grilled chicken. I recommend some type of marinate or spices for the chicken to get more flavor. Also 12 ounces of chicken wasn't enough, I would do 16 ounces. Overall pretty good but I think some spices or something could make it a wow.

I really enjoyed this dinner and so did my family. I had some left over rotisserie chicken and used jasmine rice. I also topped it  with a little extra Italian blend cheese. It was great and healthy. I will make it again :)

Because I am allergic to dairy, I used cashew milk instead of regular milk and omitted the cheese.  So good!  Easy to make, tastes better the next day.

It was good. Next time I will add more milk or a less flour. I seasoned to my taste.

I didn’t use the flour and I used cream of mushroom in place of the milk, and I added pieces of baked potatoe chips to add crunch.. it turned out beautifully.

I love this casserole. Definitely my favorite and healthier than most. The only reason I didn’t give this 4 stars is that it appeared dry before baking. I added a can of 98% Fat Free Cream of  Mushroom Soup and it was wonderful. I also used Portobello mushrooms and didn’t have any marjoram. I will be making this again.

I had most of these ingredients at home.  I used green beans because I had them instead of the peppers.  Also, I used cauliflower instead of rice and did not add the flour to the sauce.  Instead, I used heavy whipping cream to make the sauce. It was delicious and would definitely make it again.

My kids and I really liked this recipe. I'm a big fan of vegetable-forward one-dish meals, and this one fills the bill. I did make a couple of substitutions to make it healthier and gluten-free; I substituted potato flour for the regular flour, and riced cauliflower for half of the rice. Worked perfectly.

more cheese in the milk sauce might be a good idea.  Fresh spinach was perfect though

I made this for dinner tonight using fresh spinach and chicken breasts.  I used garlic olive oil to cook the spinach and chicken.  It was good.  I will make it again, but will add a little more seasoning.

Overall, a tasty and satisfying dish. The mushrooms were a little out of place for me (too "earthy" compared to all of the really fresh flavors). I think next time I'd sub zucchini like another reviewer did. But definitely worth making again!

I used the basics but did make a few changes.  Instead of the red peppers I used zucchini and yellow squash (I had to use them up!) and cooked fresh green beans with the rice.  I also needed to use up some cream cheese so threw that in as well!  OMG creamy!  So good!  I will definitely make this again!

Based on others reviews, I substituted 1/2 tsp. of Basil instead of using Thyme.  Also had canned mushrooms so used those instead of fresh.

Easy and delicious!  Always searching for casserole recipes, this was is great!  I often tweak recipes, the only change I made is deleted the thyme and added tarragon.  AWESOME!!!

When preparing this for dinner tonight my only planned change to the original recipe was to use chili pepper (seeds removed) in place of the sweet pepper due to what I had on hand. However, when going to pre-cook the chicken I noticed I had Italian sausages in the fridge that needed using, so I made this with those rather than chicken as well as the change in pepper. I think the dish made with these two changes is 5* worthy, as the chili gave a nice kick and the sausage gave a great flavour, but I imagine the recipe as written would have been quite bland with only chicken, hence the 4* rating. Will definitely make this again with the sausage substitute the next time I have some that need using and feel like something different to the usual pasta dish I make with them.

This was a great dish for the first snowy day of the year. I liked the use of so many veggies in it. I added halved grape tomatoes that I had on hand and wanted to use, and that added brightness to the flavor. I didn't give it five stars because I did feel the thyme was heavy-handed and overpowered the flavor. I would make again, I may replace the thyme with dried basil next time...

This recipe was good, but there was just too much thyme in it for my liking. In fact, I might leave the thyme out entirely next time. I'll likely make it again because it feeds many people and is healthy and simple.

I rarely make casseroles, but this one caught my eye.  I already had grilled chicken and cooked rice in the freezer so this came together quickly.  I used fresh spinach and I didn't have enough, so I just used what I had, which worked out just fine.  The only change I'd make next time is to add some panko to the parmesan that goes on top.  My parmesan didn't crisp up as much as I'd have liked so I think the panko would help to give it a little crunch.  I'd make this one again!

Delicious. I keep an eye open for casseroles and other recipes to use up all the vegetables that accumulate in a week or two. This is perfect. 

I swapped out the milk, though. And I added a lot of zucchini (chopped) and leftover corn and onions to the mix, so I would have normally added twice the rice but discovered I was out! Instead of milk, I added a cup of dry white wine to let everything simmer, and I had a lot of potatoes which I mashed, made a crust for the bottom, on which I poured all this succulent mixture. I had mixed in some grated cheese with the Parmesan on top. It was spectacular. A crowd-pleaser! And a budget-pleaser too!

Would try again with broccoli instead of spinach, spinach was overwhelming although the flavor mellowed the second day.

I used Quinoa instead of rice and fresh instead of frozen spinach. Very good!

I cooked this exactly the way the recipe asked for but the rice was never fully cooked. Was very dry.... Rice needs to be cooked before adding the skillet in my belief.

This was a very good meal! Instead of mushrooms I put in frozen carrots and peas, then I added zucchini. For the chicken I seasoned my own and cooked it on the stove top first before adding it. My whole family of 5 liked it and had no complaints. I look forward to the left overs!!
