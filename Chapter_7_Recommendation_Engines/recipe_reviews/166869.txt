I think it needs more ice cream. Perhaps that's personal preference, but I like a tiny bit of ice cream in every bite. Also, it melted very quickly due to the ratio and I ended up with a "drink" within a couple of minutes. Without the bit of ice cream, the bitterness of the guinness shines through (pro or con depending on your taste) I enjoyed it, who would have thought?

I tried this experiment without the added cola, when I was a freshman in college back in the mid 90s.  It wasn't very enjoyable once I got past the ice cream.  With the addition of cola, it's more palatable, though still not a "dessert of choice" for me.  I'd prefer a straight pint of Guinness, followed by a straight root beer float, over this concoction.  However, it's worth trying once, just to say you did it.

I thought it was just OK. I don't know how much flavor the soda added, but the ice cream added the creaminess.

Good, not great. I like Guinness and I like floats, but for some reason was not a huge fan of this. It was alright, nice to try it once, but will probably never make again.

it was bitter to me (not being a stout ale drinker though) and I didn't add nearly as much stout, only about 1/3 cup but it tastes great to me and maybe others if you add 1-2 tbsp of chocolate syrup :-)
