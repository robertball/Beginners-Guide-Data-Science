I believe i should have used chicken or turkey broth instead of water because it came out very bland and tastless.

This stuffing was amazing. I used some leftover hotdog buns for the bread. I did substitute chicken broth for the water for more flavour and pecans for the sunflower seeds as I didnâ€™t have sunflower seeds. We all love stuffing and agreed this was a keeper.
