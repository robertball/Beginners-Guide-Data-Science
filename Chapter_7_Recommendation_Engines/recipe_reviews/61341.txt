This recipe is delicious. I added about 1/4 cup more chicken stock to the sauce and used 1/4 cup kalamata olives. My husband thought it was one of the best pork tenderloin recipes he's ever tasted. It's great with sauteed spinach and garlic, small red potatoes and hearty whole grain dinner rolls or bread.

This was a delicious pork recipe, and turned out a lot better than I expected. I love the flavor of kalamata olives, which is a must if you make this recipe. One word of advice, however. The recipe says to brown the pork then let sit on a plate. For some reason, I assumed you just brown the outside and it would all cook thoroughly later. I was wrong. You must cook the pork thoroughly when it is in the pan. Probably a blonde moment on my part, but if you are reading the recipe, understand it must be cooked during the begining.

I live on the island of Crete in Greece, and quite honestly I could not say I have tasted any better similar dish locally.  It is terrific and I will make it again and again, maybe adding a little of some fresh herbs we have here, and using some local wine.  Fantastic recipe and thank you so much!

I have made this recipe several times and it is a huge hit with my family. I am Greek and we all enjoyed the wonderful aroma of this dish. I did of course change the recipe a bit. First I tenderized the meat real good then I made a marinade using wine, lemon juice, EVOO ( extra virgin olive oil),rosemary and cut up pitted kalamata olives. I let the meat soak in this for about 1/2 hour. I then follow the rest of the recipe according to how it is written.  The difference is incredible as far as taste.  When cooking meat, it isn't just the taste but the wonderful aroma the accompanies the dish.  I served the meat with red greek style potatoes and greek style green beans with feta and regular kalamata olives as an appetizer.  This dish is favmassio!  OPA!

Good, easy recipe. I substituted Perdue chicken cutlets (or the Perdue fresh chicken tenderloins) instead of the pork & the recipe worked just as well. If u don't like the strong taste of the kalamata olives, cut back on these just a little.

This was GREAT!!  I do not like rosemary and substituted basil.  I keep it frozen in my freezer and grabbed  about 2 cups and it was DELICIOUS!!  I even added more Kalamata olives than it called for b/c I love the flavor it adds.  The pork was very tender.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was amazing! I know many reviewers thought the olives were overpowering, but when I saw the amount was only 1/8 cup, I stayed true to the recipe. My husband RAVED about this pork, and my meat-hating children devoured their entire portion! I found it easy to make and pretty much fool-proof... this one's a keeper! I would have never thought of pairing kalamata olives and pork! So flavourful!

I have made this twice in two weeks because my husband loved it so much the first time. Great recipe! The olives are very strong, so if you don't love them as much as we do, you might want to cut those down a little.

I don't like olives, so I left them out completely.  Yeah, yeah, I know it's called -Kalamata- Pork Tenderloin, but it was so good without those pesky olives that I'll give it five stars anyway.

The sauce is great.  I served it on top of couscous and it was perfect.  Very easy to make too which is a bonus!

Really good - the sauce is great. I do agree with the reviewer that thought the sauce takes a little long to have your pork just hanging out waiting. I would probably make the sauce first next time, using flour and oil or butter rather than relying on the floured pork.  I'll probably just roast a tenderloin in the oven and serve the sauce over it and forget about pounding and flouring altogether. Still, this is a great dish - well worth making. Thanks for the recipe!

In fact, this is our favourite recipe ever. I serve this on special occasions.  Loved by all.  I make it with Chicken and double the sauce otherwise everything else is as written.  Served with green salad, baguette, avocado and hummus... great combination.

I decided to try this out and see if it was worthy of Christmas dinner.  Honestly, it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Ever.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made mashed potatoes for a quick side dish and the sauce was even good on the potatoes.  I will definitely be serving this to my Christmas party.  Thanks a heap for this awesome recipe!  (psâ€”it took me all of 10 minutes to make)

Wonderful entree! I made this tonight using boneless pork chops - didn't bother pounding them thin - just cooked them like I always do which is to brown them on the stove top in a cast iron dutch oven over med hi heat in a little olive oil, once browned, toss about 1/2 c water in the pan, slap a lid on, turn the heat down to Lo and let them cook for an hour - tender everytime! Once they were through, I removed them from the pan, made the sauce and voila! A fantastic supper that the whole family enjoyed!

This takes me back to the wonderful 7 weeks we spent in Greece.  This is definitely something different for pork tenderlon because not many recipes have red wine.  Thanks again for submitting - we are actually going to have it for Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this for a Valentine's Dinner for my hubby.  He declared this the best meal he'd ever eaten.  (and he's a very meat and potatoes kind of guy, so anything gourmet is kind of a risk.)  I doubled the sauce recipe and even then it needed more liquid.  I added some butter to the sauce after putting the meat back in.  Absolutely to DIE for meat.  Definitely a KEEPER recipe!

This quick and  easy recipe is great for something different to do with pork tenderloin. i forgot to add the lemon zest and it still tasted great. i did slightly reduce the black olives since it is very  "olivy" but i like black olives. would also taste great without the olives.

Loved this recipe.  I actually didn't even use the sauce!  The pork alone was so tender and yummy, the sauce just took away from it!  While cooking the pork I placed a heavy cast iron pan on top and i think it made for a more even cooking experience.  I also added a little paprika to the flour for a little added flavor!  Will deffinately make this again, just without the sauce!

We love this--it is one of our family favorites. Very bold flavors that blend well with a simple pasta dish (i.e. linguini tossed with olive oil and herb mix) and salad. We love it, and our guests always do, too!

I made this and it was excellent. Had one small change though - I marinated the pork in the chicken broth, wine, olives, garlic and rosemary first. Then, prepared exactly as written. What a difference - great flavor. Yum!

This was not my favorite by any means. I think the kind of red wine you use makes a big difference. I used some leftover Syrah and the taste of the sauce was very bitter. Used regular black olives. Very pretty but think white wine may be better with this one. Served with mushroom risotto.

Although this recipe came together quickly, I found the flavors a bit underwhelming and although everyone liked the pork - no one really seemed like they would care for it again.  The ingredients in this do tend toward the salty especially if you're using a dry red wine, I would not advise cooking wine for this at all.

This was an excellent dish! My husband who is a "new" food skeptic really enjoyed the mixture of flavors.  I served it with garlic rosemary smashed potatoes,asparagus with lemon butter and a wonderful bottle of merlot in a romantic candlelit setting.  Thank you for this recipe.

We really didn't care for this dish. I love Kalamata olives and just about anything cooked with red wine, but I was very disappointed in this. I thought with all the wonderful reviews, it would be a 10. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I'd give this one 5 1/2 stars if I could.  Very elegant.  My husband said this should be a standard when we're having company.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe which is impressive but easy too.

This was pretty good, I add cornstarch to the sauce just to thicken it.

Wow this was a simply SUPERB recipe. Me and my mom cooked it up for a nice dinner with some guests and everyone loved it and complimented on it!   Totally authentic, it tasted exactly what like what i ate in Greece. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this a 4 because my husband thought it was a 5 and I thought it was a 3. It was too salty for me (and I love salt!) and the sauce took forever to reduce. The meat was tender and the flavor was good if you could dial down the salt. I will try it again with a few revisions.

This is one of the best dishes I've ever made.  It's quick, simple and looks gourmet and like it took all day to create.  I make it exactly as the recipe says and it's perfect!

My husband and I both loved the sauce, and it smells so good too.  I don't think I pounded the meat enough maybe, because our pork was not as moist as it could have been.  Good flavor though, just wasn't 100% perfect for me.  I will probably make it again and see if it turns out 'perfect' next time. :-)  Very pretty dish though.

Overall good recipe.  Too much rosemary for my taste (clumped like mud in the finished dish) so second time i made it I cut rosemary back to 1 tsp and increased the olives to 1/4 cup.

EXCEPTIONAL!!  We thought this was exceptionally good!!  I deviated from the recipe just a bit.  I didnâ€™t pound my medallions, used white wine instead of red and didnâ€™t add the lemon zest (didnâ€™t have any).  I cooked the pork completely before transferring it to a warm oven and then proceeded to the sauce.  My sauce didnâ€™t seem to want to thicken so I added a little cornstarch and water, just before adding the olives.  WOW!!  We were in pork tenderloin heaven!!  Thank you!

I think this recipe has potential. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried. I wouldn't recomend that. Mine came out a little bitter tasting to, so I had to add sugar. I think if you use the right ingrediants then this would be a really good dish. I definetly will try this again though.

OK, but not great. I used pork loin chops and pounded them  - but I know it wasn't as good as pork tenderloin. Sauce was just OK - that's the vote from everyone in my family.

Loooooved this. Note, it's very salty (which is a good thing in our family)-- so you can use the sauce sparingly on the pork. Don't ignore the lemon zest, as I almost did. It really adds a great dimension.

OK, this was absolutely wonderful.  Pork tenderloin always has to be flavored in some way, and I dislike the pre-flavored brands because if you read the fine print, they've usually been injected with salt water (key word "tender" on the label).  I bought a fresh tenderloin, sliced it and whacked it thin between sheets of wax paper, then followed the recipe exactly. It's well worth using fresh rosemary. It was delicious, fast and healthy.  While you can refrigerate leftovers, it's best served freshly made.  I made orzo with lemon zest and parsley, with a little bit of olive oil and butter, and a side of our fresh garden green beans.  Yum.

Fantastic! and so very simple. I would just ADD 1 more ingredient...Top with Feta cheese just before serving, THAT to me adds to the Greekness. nummy ps the pounding down to 1/4 inch is the key to the quick cooking. For sure marinate the meat 1st. for awhile too. Thank you so much for this

YUM!  This was so good!  I doubled the recipe for leftovers, so it took a little longer for the sauce to reduce, but it was well worth it!  I used a Cabernet Sauvignon for the sauce.

This was more like 3 and a half stars.  I thought it was too lemony.  Other than that, it was good.  I'll try it again with maybe half the zest.

We're vegetarian.  So, we substituted soy chicken strips for pork/veg broth for chicken and loved it! I would make a little more sauce next time though.

Did not care for this at all.  The lemon zest was overpowering and the meat had no flavor unless you covered it in the bitter sauce.    Sorry.

This recipe was good.  I made the mistake of adding more kalamata olives because I like them, but the result was overpowering.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly as is.

Enjoyed this very much. I didn't have any rosemary so I added thyme instead. Very nice sauce. Will make again.

I'm going to be the lone dissenter here.  I LOVE all these flavors separately, but didn't think they worked together.  I got the rosemary as the top note going in my mouth and the lemon as the back note, but I also got a bitter taste which I think was the kalamata olives- which I love.  I just thought the rosemary was the dominating flavor of the dish.  It smelled wonderful as it was cooking and when I put the lemon zest in I thought "boy is this going to be good"  I was sorry it disappointed me.   Thanks for sharing.

I would have given a 5 but my hubby and 3 boys all said 4, so there you have it.  I took another reviewer's advice and marinated overnight in olive oil, garlic and lemon, I added some fresh rosemary to the marinade.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients, can never have too much sauce but can have too little.  Pan fried the meat  but wanted to make sure it was cooked through so after making the sauce I simmered meat in sauce until done.  Dissolved some cornstarch in water and brought to a boil, after removing cooked meat, to make sauce thicker...I like thick sauce. Will make again, unique flavor.

Great Recipe, easy and quick. I did use more garlic and olives. Would definitely serve to guests.  I'm always looking for a new way to fix pork tenderloin.

Excellent! This came out perfect. The only changes I made was that I used 4 cloves of garlic. Also ommitted the Kalamatra olives as I dont like them.

Not really what I expected...flavor just wasn't what we really like...but still enjoyed trying out and think this is a really great idea...may try again with a few changes...not sure what that would be yet but will keep an eye on the reviews and see what others are doing.

Sorry, but I hated this recipe (and I love olives). The best thing I can say about this recipe is the meat was tender. I could think of many other delicious things to do with pork tenderloin. I will not be making this again.

This dish would be excellent for guests.  However, I used one tenderloin for Paul and I, so it is best to yeild one tenderloin for every two people.

This was an easy to make and tasty recipe. I didn't have tenderloin, but removed the bone from pork chops, and pounded the meat - it worked very well. The combination of flavours is unique - but all contributed to the deicious meal.

This is an amazing recipe! I didn't use the olives because my boyfriend is a picky eater.  But my god, the pork tasted so good! I love the smell of the wine boiling with the rosemary.  A definite addition to my recipe repetoire.

Pork without mustard??? But this was very tasty. Does need more liquid, probably another 1/4-1/2 c of chicken stock or wine. I thought the pan would retain much more of the flour mixture from the pork medallions but not so. So I put the pork back in the pan and let it simmer in the juices. In all, it needs a little adaptation but itâ€™s very good.

Delicious!  My DH doesn't care for kalamata olives and he LOVED the sauce.  Followed recipe to a T.  It was SO easy and SO good.  Have a suggestion for the reviewer's concern  about not cooking the medallions throughly, she only browned them.  Make your favorite roasted potatoes recipe and roast in oven until almost done.   Put the "browned" pork medallions on top of the potatoes.  Let the medallions finish cooking in the oven.  This way some of the pork juice will flavor the potatoes and the medallions with be fully cooked and crispy.

The flavors are delicious, but I reduced the sauce by more than half and it was still too watery for me. I added extra olives at the end and that seemed to make it better.

This was excellent. My pork was too small to cut into medallions so I just cut them into pieces. We couldn't taste the olives, which was okay. The sauce was amazing though. Such a deep, rich flavor! It was hard to stop eating it. :) Thank you for such a lovely recipe.

This was surprisingly good.  Not a blow-you-away dish, but awfully good considering the simple preparation.  Notes: don't skip the lemon zest and wait for the wine to reduce.  It's quite allowable for the sauce to be on the salty side, as it will blend perfectly with the bland pork.

I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't try it. But my picky husband Loved it. I didn't have the right olives so I used basic black ones. And used Basil instead of Rosemary. He cleaned his place. Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll be making this again!

We love kalamata olives and I was looking forward all day to our meal.  I marinated the meat for 2-4 hrs. as several reviews mentioned.  I doubled the sauce...but it was just okay for us. It wouldn't be something I would serve to guests. The meat while moist, just didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. Will make again and maybe add lemon juice along with the zest.  Also will make with Greek Potatoes as a side and hope the potatoes add some needed flavour. ( did add additional kalamata)
