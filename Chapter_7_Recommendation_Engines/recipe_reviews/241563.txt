Best pasta salad I have made in a long time.  I used Wishbone Italian Dressing!  Made it the night before and it was great the next day. Will probably leave the cheddar out next time but otherwise will not change a thing!  Thanks!

This is delicious! The only thing I changed was I saut√©ed the whole mixture after it was made because the raw onion was a little too powerful for me. As far as too much chopping; no problem I used my food processor...done in minutes;). It made a lot so we ate it once as pasta and then again on French bread. Yummy both ways.

Tastes just like a muffaletta - minus the bread of course. I loved it. Unfortunately, my family doesn't like pasta salad apparently. My coworker's were grateful though ;) Also, I used black olives because kalamata olives trigger migraines for me. Still tasted like a muffaletta.

Admittedly I am a rookie cook, but there are LOTS of ingredients and a lot of chopping in this salad.  Well worth it.  Excellent.

Loved it!!!   This recipe made a lot of food, which I enjoyed for a few days.  It was even better on day 2 than on the day I made it.  Next time, I'll make it the day before I serve it.   It was a lot of chopping and took some effort to make, but it was worth it.   Yum Yum Yum!!

I could just eat this salad as the main course. So many different flavors all in one dish.  I love it!
