Surprised no one had made this yet. I had this for dinner this week and it was a nice meal.  The chipotle  and all the black  pepper was a little too spicy for me... I didnt add the second dose of the chipotle either. The filling was a nice idea nut it didnt seem to pick up much flavor from the  bouillon..I would recommend some salt to the filling and a little queso .. would make it a little easier to cut if the filling stuck together a bit more.  This is a nice recipe and just needs a few tweaks for me  I had the leftovers with some avocado and greek yogurt... I think that improved it for me
