I love the taste of this soup, but I really think the instructions need some modification so that the rice and spinach aren't overcooked.  Next time I will bring the mixture to a boil before adding the rice, then add the rice and simmer for 20 minutes, only adding the spinach in the last five minutes of cooking.  I will definitely make this again though -- the flavor is wonderful!

This soup is simple yet so delicious.  The lemon makes the broth taste outstanding.  (Use only fresh lemon juice.)  If you like really tasty soup, then this is it.  (And thanks for a rare soup recipe that doesn't use milk or eggs!)  I poached the chicken breats in some chicken broth before cutting them up & adding them to soup.  I added a little more rice than is mentioned.  I used fresh spinach but I think you could easily use frozen & it would come out just as good.

Just loved this recipe! I couldn't use fresh lemons as recipe & reviewers suggested, which made me wonder if this could actually have been even better! Used 3T concentrated lemon juice which suited my taste buds perfectly. A "touch" of unexpected tang. Also added 2 celery ribs & 1 med. onion both chopped.
A few chicken bouillon added as needed. 
Another reviewer made me think to use brown rice.  Even added some of the broth to our dogs dinner bowl to his delight!

I'm giving it five stars because I thought it was absolutely delicious, in addition to being quick, easy, inexpensive, and super healthy!  My family, however, probably would only give it three or four.  (One thought it had too much chicken; another, too much vegetables!)  We are, however, adding this to our cookbook to be made often.

(I used brown rice, added to the water once it reached boiling.  A couple handfuls of bagged fresh spinach was added toward the end, when we were ready to eat it.)

I thought this soup was very good.  I made it with well-seasoned homemade chicken broth, and I did not have fresh spinach on hand, so I used frozen chopped spinach.  I can tell that fresh spinach would give it a better flavor, so I will definitely not substitute next time. I served it with a Greek salad and warm, crusty bread, and I think it would also be very good as a first course with fish. 

Thank you for a flavorful, nutritious soup recipe - I will definitely be making this again.

Great gluten-free recipe!!! Followed the recipe exactly and we were quite pleased with the results! My husband said it was "excellent" and that he could eat it all week! He even preferred this to a greek lemon chicken soup elsewhere on this site! This was quick and super easy to make.  I think it's important that you use fresh lemons and fresh spinach as I did though to get the best flavor. Oh, and don't forget the black pepper, it really does add the perfect finishing touch!

After making it according to the recipe, I then tried it with brown rice.  It is delicious and more substantial.  Vigorously boil the rice in the water about 30 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  A great recipe for leftover chicken.  I also use organic frozen chopped spinach rather than fresh.  This goes to the e-coli issue plus making it even simpler to assemble.

I love this soup.  It is nice and light.  I leave out the spinach and carrots, make a big batch and freeze in individual containers.

This soup is great!  My family makes the classic greek version that includes egg, but in looking at recipes that included it I knew I couldn't be bothered worrying about having the egg curdle.  I made it a couple of weeks ago when I had a cold, and now I have the flu and am planning on making it again tonight (yes, I work in a school--hence, the frequent illnesses!).  I left out the spinach just b/c I didn't have any and tonight I'll probably just add some scallions.  Thanks for the easy, soothing recipe!

This has a nice change of flavor from regular soup. The broth has a really good tang to it from the lemon, and the carrots and spinach make it pretty and taste great. I really wanted to use wild brown rice in this but I didn't have the time to go get some, but I'm sure it'll make this soup even better the next time I make it.

It was really good. I did add onions, celery, bell pepper, and some corn to it. I think I added a little too much spinach but it tasted fine. :)

Delicious!!  For the chicken, I used a rotisserie chicken and instead of rice, I used orzo.  This was great, but it needs more seasoning like oregano, garlic powder and onion powder.  I will be making this again!

This was just right.  I'd been thinking about some lemon rice soup I used to get from a local Greek restaurant and thought I'd give it a try.  Soups are foods that I've been trying to make more of, but they usually don't excite me.  The flavors in this were simple and delicious.  Took others advice and saved the spinach until the very end  :)

This is a great recipe!  Very simple and very delicious.  The lemon adds a wonderful little zing.  I added 2 stalks of celery and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt to my chicken stock and because I love mushrooms but my fiance can't stand them, I added a few slices of lightly sauteed mushrooms to my bowl. I will be making this again! Thanks!

I used 2 cups frozen spinach, 2 cups frozen crinkle cut carrots, 8 tablespoons lemon juice concentrate, and 5 chicken breasts (cubed).  I didn't add the white rice until the last 20 minutes.  It was all good, but I think next time I will use less lemon juice, cut my chicken even smaller (to half inch cubes), and maybe use brown/wild rice (but add it at the begining with everything else).

Certainly is an easy recipe, even with starting off with raw chicken and poaching it. I made some changes, including sauteeing the carrots and an onion, chopped in about a tbsp. of oil for a few minutes until tender, then adding salt, pepper, about 1 tsp of dried thyme and about 2 tsp of dried parsley, and continuing to sautee for another minute. I added the broth and rice and simmered for about 10 minutes before adding the lemon juice (only used 2 lemons and this was lemony enough) and the cut up chicken and then gently heating for about 10 minutes. Went over well with these modifications. Serves with sourdough rye bread. Thanks!

Hearty and Nutritious, Easy and Uses ingredients readily available.  A nice soup with the addition of lemon.  Adds just the right bit of something interesting/new.  I added too much pepper, avoid doing that.  But otherwise, delicious.  Did add two stalks of celery and a can of a cannellini beans for extra protein.

I omitted the spinach and added celery and although the veggies are undercooked, this is one of the best soups I've ever eaten!  So delicious!  Great on a cold, dreary day like today.

This soup is amazingly good "as is". I followed the recipe exactly other than I added an onion and it turned out soo good. The lemon isnt overpowering at all you notice that its there but it doesnt take away from any of the other flavors. Next time I think I will add a bit of celery but thats all it really needs. This soup is definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe.  Sub turkey for chicken since I only had 1 1/2 cups cut the recipe in 1/2.  I had roasted the turkey so I dripping left over.  used 2 cups of this then added 2 cups of water and 2 cups of low salt chicken broth.  Simmered without the spinach for a couple of hours.  Just before serving I diced up the spinach put in the bottom of the bowl and added soup on top.  Worked great will be making again.

Made this tonight, also added onions, celery and garlic powder.  Turned out pretty good, I like the flavor, but still seemed like it was missing something.  Maybe some garlic was that something.  However, I would make this again.

This recipe is pretty good, and I've come up with a few variations.  For a different taste, add a few cloves of garlic(to taste, I like 2 or 3), and instead of lemon juice, try lime.  It feels, smells, and tastes good, especially when I have a cold or it feels like one is beginning.  If I'm getting sick, I add even more garlic and lemon or lime to it!

I LOVED this soup, looking forward to having it again for dinner ... YUMMMM! I waited and added a big bunch of baby spinach during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and also used whole grain brown rice instead of white. I'll definitely make this again.

It was okay for a lunch, but I probably would not make it again.  however, I may be tainted by my husband's excellent chicken soup.

Solid, easy, tasty soup recipe! Is it going to be as good as chicken soup totally from scratch? Of course not, but it was tasty, the lemon gave it a nice tang and even my toddlers ate it! Great recipe to keep in my back pocket for those cloudy days that beg for comfort food.

My husband and I had bad colds and I remembered a chicken soup we had eaten at Panerra's that was very good. So I found this one here at Allrecipes.com which was very similar sounding. I simmered some boneless chicken breasts in water with salt and some herbs. Then used that broth along with some good quality canned broth. When the chicken was very tender, I cut it into bite size pieces, and put it back into the broth. I shut off the heat and added the spinach, but no carrots. Instead of using rice I used a cup of hot cooked orzo. I squeezed some lemon juice into the broth along with the orzo, and floated some lemon slices on top. Then I turned the heat back on to very low, bringing the soup to steaming again and served immediately with crusty bread. With just these minor changes this soup is a huge winner, and great for slurping when sick with a cold.

Really good soup! Simple and easy to make. I didn't get enough broth, I only had 6 cups instead of 3 quarts, I didn't reduce the other ingredients either and it still came out good. I will definitely make it again with the right amount of broth.

Great recipe; cooking the chicken with lemon pepper, onion and garlic pepper also added some good flavor to the dish.  I'm stuffed.

This soup is phenomenal! I halved it, but used the juice from 2 lemons instead of 1 and a half. I used low sodium chicken stock, but ended up adding some salt at the end. I used about 3/4 of a bag of baby spinach, and subbed macaroni for the rice. This was so easy to prepare and the end result was delicious! I have never had a soup with lemon juice before, and I am so glad I tried it. What a great way to use up the leftover chicken I had from the seven pound bird I made a few nights ago. I can't stop eating!

I really loved this soup! I did not have any rice but I had quick cook barley. I substituted one cup of rice for one cup of barley and it was perfect. The next day when I was having leftovers for lunch I had the soup with some avocado it was really yummy!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I was excited to try this recipe because it is a healthier meal than many other meals on this site.  We used brown rice and less chicken. I used fresh lemons.  Unfortunately, the lemon/chicken broth taste just didn't work for us.  A very strange taste.  I make a similar recipe based on Wedding Soup with turkey meatballs, brown rice, carrots and spinach in chicken broth that we much prefer.

The lemon in this soup gave it such a fresh and wonderful flavor. I used orzo intead of the rice and in lieu of the chicken meat, I used a nice piece of Cod fish and let it simmer until it was just cooked thru. So good and very healthy too. Thank you Marlee!

Adding a lightly poached egg brought this to another level. Also changed the rice to wild rice for texture and fiber. Added the rice to boiling broth and cooked for 25 minutes, then added the rest. Added the spinach 5 minutes prior to serving.

This is the second time I’ve made the soup and this time I substituted orzo for the rice. I cook often and share it with my friends and they requested that I make this again. It’s been a little cloudy here this week in California… And it’s spring! It’s a perfect soup for any time of year in my opinion! Cheers!

I made this...it was delicious and so easy!  I had homemade chicken stock from a roast I had done the day before.  I used baby spinach and did not put it in until the very end (it only needs 1 min to wilt).  
The only significant change I made was I used tiny pasta instead of rice (only because it's what I already had).  I added it once the soup came to a boil and had 10 min left on the simmer.  I will try it with rice in the future for sure!

Yum! This just became one of my top two favorite soups! I used two Lemon Pepper Rotisserie Chickens for the meat so they already had some lemon flavor. Not being a fan I skipped the spinach in favor of an extra carrot. Like others I used orzo pasta instead of rice. I also added dried minced garlic and onion (because I add them to almost everything) as well as some parsley and a little rosemary and thyme. It was amazingly good and really easy.

A very filling and wonderfully tasty soup.  It made so much we had it for dinner one day and then I had it for lunch the next several days (which was fortuitous because I came down with a cold and this soup hit the spot).  I used the meat from a Costco rotisserie chicken.  I added a extra carrots, little extra rice, and a little extra fresh lemon juice.  For being so simple, this soup has tons of flavor.

Nice, light and quick dinner for a cold weeknight. I used wild rice instead. The next day, it absorbed a lot of the broth so I may use a little more the next time. Will make again!

This was outstanding! I was looking for a variety on basic chicken soup.  The lemon gives it a great zip!  I took some reviewers advice & added celery.  I pre-poached the chicken which worked well. I also used cooked brown rice made in the microwave with a PC rice cooker. Unbelievably good!!!

Yum!  Great flavor to this soup and so easy to make. I, too, waited until I started the simmer to add the spinach and rice, and it turned out just fine. Can't wait to experiment with different little things but this is the best tasting soup I've made so far.

I liked the idea, but found that the lemon was a bit too much. I really like the taste of lemon so I thought it would be great. If I choose to make this again I will consider using a touch less on the lemon. The soup just had a very sour favor to it.

Wonderful soup, perfect for a cool spring evening!  Just the right amount of lemon flavor, which went so well with the spinach.  As other reviewers suggested, I didn't add the spinach until the last couple of minutes of cooking.  I also didn't use as much chicken as the recipe states, but I did add some onion.  UPDATE 01/21/11:  I just love this soup!  Very healthy and detoxifying.  This time I added some onion and celery and served with cornbread.

This was ok  - simple to make - I unfortunately did add a bit more rice since I wanted to use up the bag of rice I had - don't do that - the next day the rice had soaked up a great deal of the broth so I had to add more chicken broth and it took away from the flavoring.

Wow!  I was surprised how good his easy soup was!  It will certainly become a staple.  I even cooked it for friends who loved it and had no trouble with soggy rice or spinach despite cooking it ahead of time.

This is a good starter recipe but it just needed something more.  First, I added 8 oz of dry white wine.  Then substituted 1/2 cup each of fully cooked brown rice, wild rice and fancy red buhtanese rice for the one cup of uncooked white rice.  It got raves at a recent party.

It was fantastic. it taste like a nice homecooked tom yum soup but not so spicy. i did add some corn which made it taste a little sweeter but not that much and baby spinach was fantastic. omit the rice for a delicious no carb meal

This was just alright, the spinach was really slimy in it. I think if I were to ever make this again, I would probably substitute it for either frozen spinach or another hardier leafy green like chard or something. Also I think this would have been nicer with some orzo or other tiny pasta rather than the rice.

What a great tasting soup!  Its such a different flavor.  I changed the recipe a bit though: I started with sauted celery and onions, and along with the ingrediants the recpie calls for I added carrots, acini de pepi, sundried tomatoes, and chicken bouillion.  I left out the chicken, however, and used this as a veggie side dish.

Vrey good recipe! Easy to make, and it take very little time to cook this soup. Everybody in my family liked it a lot.
