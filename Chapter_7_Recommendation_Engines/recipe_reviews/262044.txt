I made this for a Super Bowl gathering. I made this and two other soups. I should have just made this one - it disappeared in a hurry and our guests wanted copies of the recipe before they left our house! I made it straight up according to the recipe and wouldn't really change anything. The cayenne does give it some zip, so if you're not into spices you may prefer a tamer version. It's not burn your mouth spicy, but there's definitely a kick. I can't wait to make it again.

Safety tip: Don't put the squash peelings in the disposal. I thought I was fine, but ended up with a majorly clogged sink. Rookie mistake on my part.

This was a delicious and super easy recipe that will definitely be made again. I did decide to roast  the squash (peeled and cubed before roasting for 24 minutes at 400 degrees). I also skipped the maple syrup and used less creme fraiche. I am the boss of my squash, right?

I had a roasted butternut squash that I was eager to use so I made this tonight and it was outstanding and easy! I was out of tomato paste so I substituted a couple handfuls of chopped sweet cherry tomatoes. I also didn't have heavy cream so I substituted half and half. I'm sure it would only be better with the real thing. I served it with finely chopped bacon on top. The combo of the sweet bisque with the salty bacon was outstanding. Nice job once again chef John!

The soup was ok, but I feel the onion is over powering it.  Are there any suggestions to cut the onion flavor other than using less onion?

Made this Butternut Squash Bisque, It taste great! I could not find a 2lb  butternut squash, used a 3lb one, followed the directions, added a little more butter (5 tbs) and needed to add some water at the end because it was too thick. Thanks Chef John

I love Chef John! This is one of the best bisque I’ve ever made! Even my kids love it and one of them hates most vegetables.

This bisque has been one of my favorites, and I really don't prefer soups of any kind. I used onion powder instead of the actual onions, and I took off the pomegranate seeds and chives. Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly- 10/10 recipe for me!

Love recipe as is without garnish. Instead. Use a dash of cinnamon and sprinkle with a little brown sugar. Get the tingle of hot with a little bit of sweet. If you want to chew something, add chopped walnuts.

I didn't have any heavy cream so I used the almond milk I had on hand and served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Very delicious.

Made exactly as is but with a tablespoon of brown sugar added as well. Amazing. Garnished with pomegranate seeds made it so good. Will make again.

This soup is as delicious as it is beautiful and easy to make.  I roasted the squash a few days earlier along with prepping the onions.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth today as I finished it. It's a wonderful addition to the other soups I make!

We made no changes to the recipe except to leave out the salt (low-sodium diet) and doubled the amount.  It is delicious.  Not sweet even with the maple syrup and the cayenne gives a nice little tang.  Will definitely make this again.

It is very creamy, I roasted my squash first and used it as a main meal with some homemade crusty bread.
