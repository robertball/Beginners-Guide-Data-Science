This was good, but you forgot a lot of ingredients to make this great!  First of all use LIME JUICE!!!!  It really gives it that needed 'punch', I usually use a whole lime juiced.  Also, I add some cubed up avocado, and usually I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Add the lime juice for sure though and you won't believe the difference in this reicpe!

Holy Hannah... After the changes I made, this is borderline perfection!!! I used two tomatoes (large dice), a half of a large red onion (really fine dice), one green onion (finely chopped), very little jalape√±o, 3 sprigs cilantro, Low-Sodium salt, and some lime juice (didn't measure - just went to taste).  I mixed it all in a colander, to drain juices.  I might end up chawin' this all down before the Fiesta tomorrow!!!

The recipe is basic, it's not terrible, but you can add more to make it taste a lot better the authentic way. And I'm sorry but the picture you have up looks more like a mango salsa than pico de gallo... pico de gallo should be a little more wet than that and should have more cilantro & (fresh) garlic with some lime & maybe even avocado (tastes great!). I do add salt to taste but usually don't need pepper for salsa(yes pico de gallo is a type of salsa). You should always taste along the way as you're making it so that it fits your taste.

Apparently a lot you customizers ignored her recipe and description. SHE HERSELF called it a basic recipe.. great as it is plus open to changes to perfectly suit your own taste. Why customize it then rate it low? This is an excellent simple recipe with a multitude of customization options! Thank you grneyedmustang! I wanted a good basic recipe to learn and start with... and you gave me just that! And it is wonderful as it is!

Very good, but needed a little tweaking. First of all, 2 sprigs of cilantro is not NEARLY enough for my family. I used 2 tablespoons of cilantro, chopped in the food processor. I also only used about 1/4 of a white onion and 3 green onions, added the juice of 2 limes, and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder. (This was for a double batch BTW.) That said, it was an awesome pico! Everyone loved it, even my 2-year-old. With the adjustments to make it more authentic, it's definitely a keeper. Thanks for the inspiration, Paula!

A very good recipe indeed.  I would suggest adding fresh lime juice to taste. Also, word to the wise:  When working with fresh jalepenos, always wear protective gloves if you don't want the juice in your skin for days!  Especially if you wear contact lenses!  OUCH!

This is a good basic pico de gallo. However my family likes more cilantro flavor, so I used a half bunch and added fresh lime juice and minced garlic, rather than powder. Yummy with chips, tacos, or even mixed into bland chicken salad.

To be fair, this recipe is not "bad", it is just missing lime juice (fresh!) and please use fresh garlic (1clove minced) for a great big difference.  Otherwise it is a good point of direction for those looking to make pico.

Very good!  I will double the recipe next time...the cilantro is a MUST... whatever you do don't leave it out.  If you don't have this ingredient go to the store and get it because it is what gives pico de gallo a unique flavor.

Excellent!!  I added way too many peppers from my garden, but was making a HUGE batch, so I got a little crazy.  This recipe is good right after mixing and FABULOUS after a few hours........but not so good after a day or two.  It gets really watery.  Make it in the afternoon for supper and ENJOY!

My family loves this recipe.  You can put pico de gallo on anything and make it tast wonderful.  We make it now instead of salsa.  It doesn't fall off the chip or squish out of a fajita like salsa does.

Avocado (aguacate) does NOT go in pico de gallo. Of course, people can do whatever they want with a recipe. Add chocolate if you want, it won't be authentic but if you are into it... go ahead. Lime, however, DOES go. Garlic ... I rather press a garlic clove into the pico de gallo than using garlic powder. Green onion ... again, not authentic but I don't see why I'd hurt anything. This recipe is good but it is missing the lime and I always skip the salt for health reasons. It really doesn't need it anyways.

this recipe would have 5 stars if it was written as i doctored it up. i doubled the recipe and used a half bunch of cilantro - popped that in the food processor, 1 garlic clove, a full onion, 3 green onions (all minced in the food processor) 6 roma tomatoes, chopped, a pinch of salt and pepper, 2 fresh limes squeezed and 3 minced jalapenos (seeded). with this recipe you get a cereal- bowl amount of pico and it isnt that dry  is is packed full of flavor and slightly watered as it should be. enjoy!

Great! I agree with the majority, however... it tastes even better with fresh lime juice, fresh garlic, and more cilantro. I served this with Fish Tacos from this site. My boyfriend ate the remainder of the pico de gallo with tortilla chips.

This is a perfect starter for Pico.  I add some balsamic vinegar, white vinegar and cucumbers (seeded).  I also use half a bunch of cilantro.  I use a red onion instead of white for the sharper taste.  I make a large batch of this and add it to my families eggs in the morning, sandwiches for lunch and tonight I have some fresh shrimp and will add this to the shrimp with some steamed rice.   Using this in place of canned (high salt) sandwich spreads saves money and is a healthy alternative.

Equal parts tomato and onion was way off to me.  After adding more tomato, less onion, fresh garlic rather than the garlic powder and a good splash of lime juice this was much improved.

This is fantastic.  The only things I did different was used red onion instead of a regular onion, drained my tomatoes after dicing to prevent it from becoming too watery and did a squeeze of fresh lime juice like she suggests in the introduction.  YUM!  Definitely a keeper!

Thank you for the recipe! I was so excited to try it, but unfortunately, it just wasn't right for me.  I found the onion/tomato ratio way off.  I even added another tomato and it was still so very strong on the onion flavor that we couldn't eat it without our eyes watering.  I used the food processor and used fresh garlic, the juice of a lime and extra cilantro, as per other reviewers.  I would try this again but I would only use half the onion and would add an extra (3) tomato.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I had been craving pico de gallo when I had it at a mexican restaurant on a recent trip. I found this recipe to be very bland. It needs extra stuff...perhaps lime juice, fresh galic might have made a difference, and maybe avocado...needs improvement, but a good base.

Very basic recipe for Pico De Gallo, a great starter though. Added fresh lime juice from 2 limes and about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro and 2 green onions and BAM! From basic to fantastic!

Terrific recipe, and not too spicy-hot (for wimps like me)!  I have tried for years to like cilantro, but just can't.  My loss, I think.  My daughter doesn't care for green onion.  Also my loss because I love it.  We added fresh lime juice after trying it without.  It added a little zing.  We used freshly picked vine-ripened tomatoes.  I think that's the secret to this recipe.  Now what will do when tomato season is over?   :(

A good starter / idea base for pico de gallo.  I agree with other reviewers that this recipe needs lime juice.  I used the juice from one small (almost key lime) lime and felt it was the right amount.  I used more cilantro, double the garlic powder, and threw in another half tomato.  I also used all green onions.  Keep in mind that the yield is relatively small.  It's so good people will gobble it down quickly, so I suggest doubling it!  Many people eat this with chips, but I like it alone as a side salad.

Very boring! Nothing like authentic pico de gallo. I agree...you forgot the basic ingredient to pull it together...lime juice. Not nearly enough cilantro. It is really not even basic. Sorry!

Would probably make again except . . . 
1) Use some fresh lime juice
2) More cilantro
3) Either a sweeter onion or less yellow onion (really strong onion flavor so would want to pull it back a little)

With some modifications, this is a really good & simple pico de gallo recipe. Like others have said, half an onion is plenty for this recipe. Use one or two cloves of FRESH minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and you'll be happy that you did. :) We prefer ours with much more cilantro & a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Thanks for sharing the recipe!  :)

Be sure to add a squeeze of fresh lime juice and you'll love this recipe. Simple and yummy. I did cut back on the oinion, using just the green onion rather than a whole one plus a green. To tone down the spiciness (I am a heat-wimp, I fear), I used chopped green chilies instead of the jalapeno.

You know I find that the very best tomatoes to use in this kind of salsa recipe are Roma tomatoes. They small and firm. I always take out some of the seed so you don't end up with watery salsa.

A good basic recipe. I changed most of the amounts though. I used half a large onion, two tomatoes, a large handful of cilantro, omitted the green onion, and two cloves of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. Also I added lime juice, red wine vinegar, a little oil, and fresh ground sea salt and pepper to taste. It was good enough to eat some right away but I'm looking forward to tomorrow!

I agree with some of the previous posters that this is a good basic recipe.  I did not think there was enough cilantro or garlic the first time I made it.  This last time I added about 3 more sprigs of cilantro, 1 tsp. of minced garlic and 1 TB of lime juice.  This improved it quite a bit and by the next day the flavors had mingled well and it was a bit more wet.

I used Anaheims (for flavor) and Cerrano (for heat if desired) peppers instead of Jalapenos. I prefer to use Roma tomatoes for this because I like the flavor and they're usually less watery than traditional vine tomatoes and lead to less juice but more solid and flavorful chunks. They're less acidic so they probably won't keep as long as other tomatoes, but the addition of lime juice to the recipe sort of makes up for that and the lack of juice from the tomato switch, for the most part. As far as fresh versus bottled lime juice goes. To the average palate it won't make much of a difference and in making large batches or canning I'd say bottled is superior because it's typically pasteurized and that means fewer live microorganisms going into your cans, also it's less work than squeezing your own. But for small batches I'd go with fresh limes because it's more cost effective. One final thought is that I use white onions for applications like this because they have a more crisp gardeny flavor than yellow or reds that compliment the tomatoes well...but that's all just my opinion.

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I would add some bell pepper and leave out the green onions.   Also for those of you who think it's too watery, I always chop my ingredients, especially the tomatoes, into a  collender to drain off the excess liquid.  Fresh lime juice is definitely a must.  Also fresh garlic.  A dash of olive oil also adds a little more flavor.

Made this per recipe and was very good.  Then I took the suggestion of lime juice (1/2 a good sized lime), avocado, and increased salt using Janes Crazy Mixed-Up Salt and more pepper and more cilantro... then it was exceptional!  Thanks for the great recipe.

We enjoyed this a lot. I felt like it was missing a little seasoning so I threw in some taco seasoning, which added a little kick to it. Also squeezed in half a lime. Great recipe though, as you can adjust things easily according to your taste.

So much better than what I've had at restaurants!  I omitted the pepper for my 6-yr-old and accidentally forgot the garlic.  I added 1 packet of True Lime.  Everyone requested that I make it the same way from now on.  It was outstanding!!!

A refreshing and tasty salsa to use over tacos and any mexican dish for that matter. I used one medium red tomato, half of a white onion, chopped, half of one jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced, 2 sprigs of fresh local grown cilantro, a little green onion, diced,  and 2 fresh garlic cloves, finely minced. I also added a little rock salt (pinch), black pepper and 1 whole lime for that extra flavor and "kick." Lime was actually needed in this to complete it. In my opinion, the more cilantro and lime juice, the better the flavor. I always use FRESH ingredients. I can doctor up the taste in this to make it less spicy and add more ingredients if I want a larger amount. This amount called for in this recipe was good enough for the two of us. This made one good batch size (soup bowl) and I chilled it before using it and also to let the ingredients set. I served this with, "Carne Asada Tacos," and "Spanish Rice," also from this site. Delicious!

This is decent, but a very basic recipe.  As many others have mentioned, adding fresh lime juice and minced garlic rather than garlic powder makes a huge difference.  This is a great addition for any fiesta.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making Pico de Gallo myself, it is very simple and I was very pleased with this recipe and plan on making more again this week. The only change I made was I opted to use fresh garlic in place of garlic powder.

Its better with 3 parts tomato, 2 part onion, 1 part jalapeno and salt to taste. Serve fresh. This a good recipe but Im not a big fan of cilantro.

I was looking for a basic pico de gallo recipe and this was just the right thing.  I will try many of the suggestions from other reviewers too, but sometimes the simplest form is the best.  Thanks!

I must have done something wrong, because mine turned out pretty yucky. I will try this again sometime, perhaps I misread an ingredient. I ended up making my botched pico de gallo a layer in a baked bean dip instead, which was perfect:).

To be fair. I did make this recipe with the guidelines. I didn't have a medium tomato, I had Romas. I used 7. I seeded and removed the membrane from 5 of them, and the other 2 I used the seeds and membranes for the "juice factor". This recipe, was good but as with the other comments, I folded....it did need fresh lime, and more of a kick and a bit more heat, to our liking. So...here's what I did. I used the Romas, as mentioned. I used 5 springs of cilantro, 1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and membrane removed, juice from 1 large lime and 1/2 tsp cumin, as well as the correct measurements of the other ingredients. I give this an actual 3 star, but with the modifications I did, it was a 5 star, soo to be fair, I am giving this recipe a 4 star, and will make again, with modifications.

Almost, but not quite. Use more cilantro, garlic cloves rather than powder and fresh lime juice (squeezed from 1 lime). Also, the white onion is too strong for this dish; add more green onion instead. Pico de gallo, however, is based on taste preference, so adjust amounts to your specifications.

Thank you SO MUCH Grneyedmustang for giving us SUCH a great BASIC recipe for all of us to learn our own proportions.

This is a wonderful, BASIC recipe.  Typically almost all Pico de Gallo recipes have fresh lime juice in them (to taste), as well as garlic. Pico de Gallo means "fresh", I think, (but I'm 50 years dated since High School Spanish .
Therefore "Pico" should be made with fresh garlic cloves, (unless no choice), fresh "instead of canned" tomatoes, fresh sqeezed lime juice instead of bottled lime juice.

Now, the best part.  Use this to top SALADS, virtually calorie LOW!  EGGS, ANY Mexican or South American cuisine, (duh!), cooked SHRIMP, TACOS, VEGETABLES, FISH, guacomole, you NAME it!  Tust me, you,ll LOVE it.

Hope this gets you going, cause you may want to make up a BIG base recipe, (without tomatoes, like I do a day before Cinco De Mayo) and add the tomatoe's  about two or three hours before you want to serve the "salsa". Then leave the rest of your base in the refrigerator for another few days adding tomatoes until its gone (sniff!)...  Mine lasts (sans tomatoes) about 3 to 5 days.  HTH!

Hubby and I thought this was very good.  I really don't like cilantro, so I left it out.  Otherwise, I did pretty much what the recipe suggested (although I must admit I didn't really measure anything).  I'm saving this recipe to make all the time.

This is a perfect recipe for your basic Pico De Gallo, the way it is suppose to be.  You can doll it up with other stuff if you like.  I also make Bob's Habanero Hot Sauce - Liquid Fire from this website and I combine the two for a chunky salsa.  Very good!  Thanks grneyedmustang!

This is good but it does need some lime juice.  I had it without and just felt I had to add some so I did, and then it was perfect!  I do love the addition of the green onions ;)  We served this on Slow Cooker Carnitas from this site.  Thanks!

This is very much the way my Mexican friend used to make it, although she wouldn't be got dead putting garlic powder into it.  Always fresh garlic and fresh cilantro.  Also, she used no salt or pepper.  I found her cooking fairly punchy with the jalepenos but never salty.  I think it's only the American tastes that have brought that to Mexican cooking!  Cheers!  This recipe is lovely with just about anything!

we LOVE fresh salsa and pico, eat it everyday with tortilla chips instead of snacking on junk food. i love cilantro so i add a lot and i use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, omit the salt and pepper.

it was good, but I learned I would prefer less onion and a little more tomato.

Not bad, but definitely bland.  Like suggested by others, I used fresh garlic and added lime juice.  We let it sit for 24 hours.  This recipe definitely needs something...

Loved it!!!  This is a favorite of mine that I get to have at our favorite mexican restaurant, and now I can make it at home.  Made as written and let the flavors come together in the fridge overnight.  It was wonderful with our enchiladas.

My husband doesn't like uncooked onions, so I mixed it up and cooked it on a small casserole for 7 mins.  Then I cooled it and served it on tacos and burritos.  Everybody loved it!

Solid recipe. Changes I made that bring it to a 5 star rating: 1. Use fresh garlic. 2. Add lime juice (to taste). 3. Add a dash of cayenne pepper (to taste).

This recipe was good. I give it four stars though because I added other stuff to it. I left out the jalapeno because some of my friends do not like spicy food. I added lime juice to taste. I also used fresh garlic (3 cloves, because we tripled the recipe) instead of powder.   It was a hit and it was healthy.

Good! I did use quite a bit more cilantro and added lime juice. I also used fresh garlic, just out of preference. I made this early in the day and refrigerated for about 4 hours, which really let the flavors meld. Thanks!

So simple and flavorful. The only thing I changed was using serrano chiles and no cilantro. Very good and easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe.

Good recipe.  I used sweet and red onion and also added 1/4 of a green pepper.  It adds color and crunch.  I also like other reviewers used lime juice garlic salt, garlic and lots of chopped cilantro.  I am glad I made it in my colander as it let the ingredients drain.

This is a great base for pico. I used 3 tomatoes, 6 sprigs of cilantro, chili peppers from the garden (2) juice of 2 limes, no pepper and a dash of salt. I have even added diced cabbage if I have it in the house. Thanks. The family loved it.

Definately add FRESH lime juice (I used 1 whole lime).  Stays good for up to 2 days...if it's not gone in 30 minutes;-)

I did like this recipe as a starter, but i don't think that it would have been as good if I did not take the previous suggestions and add fresh garlic and lime juice. I also added quite a bit more cilantro than called for.

I prepared this last night to compliment some fajitas I'll cook tonight. Like others, I added minced garlic, lime juice and salt.  I chopped everything up separately and then threw all of it into my chopper  and it was excellent! This recipe is a keeper and the ingredients are right in your fridge.

This was ok.  I added green, yellow, and red peppers and used at least 4 T of cilantro.  I added a second smaller tomato. I used 2 whole jalapeno peppers.  It needed salt.  I added the juice of one lime as suggested and had to pour a bunch of it off.  All I could taste was lime. (Ilove lime so that was not the issue) 
The recipe as posted would rate a 2.  Using my changes it would be a 4 for me.  So I split the difference and gave it a 3.

I liked this. I've always wanted to make it but never knew quite how. I used half an onion instead of a whole, more cilantro and I used some lemon juice because I didn't have any lime on hand. It turned out great. I give it four stars since I made some mods to make it taste just right. Thanks for sharing this!

The pico turned out extremely well.  I omitted the green onion, garlic powder and pepper and added the juice of a half of a lime and it tasted just like the stuff the restaurants in South Texas serve.

Not a good recipe as written.  Has way too much onion.  I guess it is a good starter recipe.  It needs to be changed to suite you taste.  I like other peoples idea of using lime or lemon juice.  I will try that next time.

This recipe was great. It was so easy that I was surprised I didn't think of it myself. I, too, only used half an onion, and I also added orange bell pepper and extra cilantro. Muy delicioso!

I was so excited when I found this recipe, because our favorite authentic mexican restaurant serves the BEST pico... but theirs is hot.  This was not.  I'm not giving up!  This recipe was a good base, so I'll tinker with it (definitely more jalapeno!).

My husband loves this!! I'm not a huge onion fan, so I mix it with bottled salsa to tone it down a little. It's also good on hash browns, baked potatoes or scrambled eggs - you'll find lots of uses for it! It tends to get stronger after a few days and doesn't have a great shelf-life, so fresh is best!!

Trying again to leave comment. I usually don‚Äôt leave anything other than the star ratings. I personally don‚Äôt care for reading negative comments about another‚Äôs recipes. I feel thankful that they took time out of their busy lives to share it with us. It‚Äôs a good recipe. If it helps you to see what your missing to make the dish complete or so your able to make your own come out better. Most are making a dish for the first time so try to be appreciative to the recipient of the recipe. Give the recipe a rating. If you feel a comment is necessary try to be nice & helpful....not rude, big headed or a know it all. If your incapable......move on. It‚Äôs rude to start off telling them they have left out several ingredients or as most put, the ‚Äúkey‚Äù ingredient. Obviously it is to their satisfaction, and others likings or they would not have posted it. Each to their own I say and  of course most of all........BRAVO!!!!  Im a wife of 17yrs & mother of 2 healthy eating boys. I‚Äôm told by so many that I‚Äôm an amazing cook but I‚Äôve never been brave enough to post one of my recipes, out of fear of being ridiculed so I‚Äôm happy to have another‚Äôs to try. I feel lucky enough to have access to all the wonderful technology this day in time to find recipes and help with my own recipes but I will never act as if I know what another‚Äôs recipe needs to be perfect.  Thanks, LeLesBoys03

I don't eat Pico but lots of my family does. I substituted homegrown onions for my batch but it was a massive hit! There were only 2 people eating it and I have none left! Definitely a great simple addition to the party!

I have now made this twice in one week. Love it. I find myself using it on burgers, in burritos & on many other dishes that needs some flavoring + the bonus is that it's all fresh ingredients & home made.

I had everything on hand except the jalapeno and green onion, but it was still delicious!  I squeeze a whole lime and mix into all the ingredients.  I'll never buy it from the store again!

I had a few veggies from a late garden harvest and wanted a quick, fresh pico de gallo.  This recipe was perfect.  I only substituted fresh garlic for the garlic salt (I didn't have the garlic salt).  I served it on my veggie omelet and it was outstanding.

I make Pico all the time and this recipe is definitely off.  It's a good starting point but the amount of tomato to onion is really wrong - I use 3 or 4 tomatoes to 1 onion.  I add a lot more cilantro because we really like it and 2 sprigs is almost none - why bother?  Fresh garlic is a must - just put it through a garlic press and it adds so much more flavor.  With herbs and spices, fresh is always better.  Last of all, lime juice is required.  I'd use at least 1 whole lemon, juiced - about 2 T. or even 3.  Sorry but if I have to correct the recipe it's never a 5 star.  I rate the recipe as stated, not as I make it.

The ratio of onion to tomato is waytoo high, there need to be way less onion, or way more tomato. There is no lime, and there needs to be fresh garlic, never powdered. Also, there needs to be more cilantro, as well as a little bit of green bell pepper.

This is a great BASIC recipe, as she said. That means tweak it to your taste. Personally, I used Serrano peppers,lime juice, diced garlic and fresh parsley because my husband is allergic to cilantro.

It was good, but very basic Pico De Gallo. It needs some lime juice and may even some halibut or something.

I have used this recipe for years only didn't know it belonged to someone else.  Yes, fresh garlic is a must and more cilantro.  It gets watery, yep, so I put it in my blender and it makes the best tomato/vegetable juice even.  In fact, I use one cup jelly jars and actually can it and water bath it for winter.  I had a cup this morning that I had canned in 2012.

I really liked this but had to modify due to not having garlic powder/salt & jalape√±os. I used a garlic clove that I had and a different type of pepper that I had that is green but not a jalape√±o. I also added lime juice for a kick but you were right, once you have this with Mexican food, you won't want to be without it!

Thanks.

I think that this recipe is fantastic.  I added more cilantro also as we are big cilantro fans and I also cut the onion in half.  I have tons of fresh tomatoes from the garden and I need to use them up.  Thanks for putting this up lady.  I appreciate it.

As written it's good.. but it's exceptional if you up the cilantro [I used about a 1/3 of a bunch] and squeeze in the juice of one lime. Truly exceptional!

I had chopped my onion fine.. and diced my tomato small.. but I then poured the bowl out and minced it much smaller. It allowed for the full bang in each bite, instead of tasting just one ingredient.

Must make this!! I'll be making it regularly: our whole family [including our 5, 3, and 1.5 yo] loved it!

Don't use garlic powder. Use a little fresh garlic. Also add fresh lime juice. The acidity is a must.

Fresh garlic is always best. Cilantro is a love/hate herb and i think your portion is perfect to have a nice balance. I use a mix of Persimmon and Pink Girl tomatoes to make mine when available. Gives a good mix of sweet and acidic. If i make it for myself i use white pepper and a pinch of cumin.

This was a huge hit at a pot luck I attended.I have friends with food allergies and most were able to eat this because it didn't have lime.

Never thought my first try at making Pico de Gallo would be successful, but everyone LOVED it! I added a little lime juice and I used freeze dried cilantro but it still worked!

This recipe is simple and my whole family loves it but the proof is when your 18 month old twins cannot get enough of it! They just sat eating it by itself and with chips. I originally put it with burritos.

Good start as a base.  I have to agree with others about more cilantro.  Also, I added just a pinch of oregano, substituted minced garlic for the powder and then adjust from there to taste for heat, citrus and seasoning.

I substituted three large Roma tomatoes and added the juice of one whole lime. I also used one fresh garlic clove. Great with your favorite Mexican dishes or try mixing it with sharp cheddar(Two parts cheese to one part pico de gallo) and using it as a base to make quesadillas. Add chicken beef or whatever you desire. Tastes great and so easy. Use it however you choose but please add the lime juise it makes all the difference.

With the helpful reviews, this recipe turned out beautifully! I thought the ratio of tomato to onion made the onions opverpowering so I added more tomato. After rinsing a small bunch of cilantro, I ripped off less than half of the top portion and discarded the larger stems. Be sure to dry the little leaves off with paper towel and use a dry cutting board so they won't stick to everything while you're chopping them! LOL I used diced cherry tomatoes (it's one of the few varieties the grocery store is selling this week due to the salmonella scare). I added: 1 clove fresh garlic, 1 fresh jalapeno (seeded and deveined), juice of half a lime, and 1 Hass avocado. With my additions and modifications this salsa was enough for about a dozen fajita tacos. Delicioso!

We have been using this recipe with few modifications for quite some time.  We do not add the green onion, but add a small amount of lime juice.  This recipe is great!

Exactly as promised.  Went well with the black beans.  For my cilantro-challenged friends I used some flat leaf parsley and a little cumin.

I thought this was great, but needed a little red wine vinegar. I added ~ 2 Tbsp. Will definitely make again!

I agree with other reviewers, lime juice is essential, otherwise it's pretty good.

Thanks Amy C for the lime juice tip.
I now remembered that lime juice was
used in other recipes, had forgotten
that...

This is a fantastic Pico De Gallo.  Made recipe the same except used red bell pepper as that's what I had and used vidalla onion.  Did not have celery salt so used 1/2 t. salt and 1/4 t. celery seed.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will make this often!

This was exactly what I was looking for. But I think I'll make it at least a couple of hours in advance next time so that the onions have time to mellow out.

It took a good bit of time to chop up everything but this tasted very good.  I added extra tomato so that the onion wouldn't be too overpowering.

This was good. It wasn't wonderful but it was just as good as the stuff I've had out at mexican resteraunts. I guess Pico De Gallo is basically hard to screw up. I will make this again, but double or triple the recipe as I ate all of this in 1 1/2 days!!

Definitely use fresh garlic!  If you don't like the crunch of the onion add a little oil to the onions to soften.

This recipe is excellent!! You can add more jalapeno if it's not hot enough, and reduce the onion content if you are not too thrilled about the onions. We will definitely be serving this with many Mexican dishes in my house.Thanks for the great recipe!!

It's not terrible, but I have to rate it as Mediocre at best, but I want a stronger, yet mild flavor (good jalapeno flavor without the "heat").

My husband is very picky about Mexican dishes and he loved it! Said it was absolutely delicious! Unfortunately I did not have fresh cilantro, but the dried worked quite well! I used about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoon.

Great. Just made a few adjustment. I used a Vadalia onion instead of the Red. Also and Very Important, Add LIME JUICE to it. The difference is huge. When making it, I diced up the onions  put them in a bowl with a little salt on them to the side ( few minutes ) then drained. It pulls out the bitterness

Use one clove of fresh garlic finely chopped and a small handful of Cilantro sprigs coarsely chopped instead of a few or powdered garlic.

It came out great! I HIGHLY recommend adding in a splash of lime juice (fresh, to taste) and a little more of each spice to taste. It was a little bland until I added more of each spice. But a great base recipe!

Like many others said, it is a basic recipe.  I used 4 tomatoes, 1 large onion and several kinds of peppers from the garden to add interest.  I made a larger batch because who wants to make that much of a mess for such a small amount:-)

It was an ok recipe, but needed some tweaking.  I added lime juice and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I would also add more cilantro next time.

Great Recipe! We use Roma tomatoes seeded skin on cut in chunks  and multiply this 7 times or so lol. It is fantastic the way it is but we add a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil and the juice of one lime.

My husband loved it.  I did make a few changes, some intentional and others by accident.

I skipped the jalapeno, forgot the green onion (will include next time) and added a little lime juice.

Like most reviewers lime and minced garlic are a must have. I've made pico a dozen different ways and enjoy it with a couple tabs of sugar to sweeten it and reduce the acidity a bit.  Other options include red wine vinegar or some old world jalepano infused vinegar.  Have fun with pico! Fresh Roma's, best to de- seed (pam says always take the snot out!!!) of your maters, any onion, cilantro and a good pepper are the bedrock of a good dip or seafood, chicken,pork  garnish. Gotta love Mexican food.

I used green peppers instead of jalapeno and I didn't have green onions. I added lime juice since so many recommended it and I agree. It needs something to tie all the pieces together.

loved it! Didn't have cilantro and didn't miss it a bit. Added squeeze of  lime per other reviewers.  I'll keep some of this on hand from now on.  Fresh and light!
Fast and easy.

I loved this recipe except I found the onions to really over power the dish and I also added the lime juice. That was a must! Next time I will be putting the onions in a hot water bath to soften the kick of them, otherwise this was a great and simple recipe.

Soooo delicious.  I swapped out the green onion for red because I was already using green onion in a different taco topper I was making, and I also used fresh garlic instead of powder and added a splash of lime juice.  Will make this a staple side with all Mexican dishes from now on.

This was amazingly good. I did, however, add a few squirts of Lemon juice and Lime Juice to give it a little extra pizzazz. Took it to a party where a few guests are regular travelers to Mexico, and received high praise from them :) absolutely delish!!

This was just okay as written. However, after tasting it, I did add some lime juice and diced red onion, which is just my personal preference. It's okay without it. Really yummy with my chips, and I can't stop eating it!

This recipe is OK for beginners. I had used 3 small/medium red vine tomatoes, 1 whole jalapeno, 1 whole yellow onion,  like 3 times the cilantro, a couple shakes of salt and pepper and little less garlic powder, one green onion and about 1 lime juice. I really used this as a guide line more than anything. But for first timers this recipe is fine. Just dont put too much salt it will draw the water out of the tomatoes and make the pico de gallo watery.

Excellent base recipe!! I made it for a friend and we both thought it was better than the fresh at the farm market in her neighborhood. My five-star rating is based upon the recipe itself; however, I did make some very basic alterations. I used roma tomatoes and used three for the one tomato as listed in the recipe. I did not use green onion as I missed that in the list so I didn't have any, but I doubled the recipe (using six roma tomatoes) and used one full, medium-sized onion. I chopped the tomatoes, onion and pepper very fine. I also substituted one large clove of garlic (minced very fine) for the garlic powder. I don't feel as though my alterations were much of a departure from the original recipe, and it was delicious! Exactly what I was looking for! When I served it, I squeezed a half a lime over the bowl and stirred it together. YUM!!! Oh, I did use A LOT more cilantro - love cilantro!

I prefer this over regular salsa. It's so fresh tasting, and I think the lime juice I did use had a lot to do with it. I went with two small tomatoes, but I think I added too many onions. You go with what works for you, otherwise you won't like it. Cilantro is key, and I will admit that I used those dehyrated ones that you reconstitute in water. I didn't have fresh jalapeno, so I gave a few shakes of cayenne pepper. Also used fresh garlic. Thanks for the great recipe!

I prefer lime juice to the lemon juice, but this was still wonderful and fresh tasting, an easy base to work off of.  The only change I made was to use less onion, just a personal preference.

This was very good, I only added fresh garlic and lime juice. I also used more cilantro, because we like it. 
Those who are saying to add avocado are making guacamole, not pico de gallo. Pico de gallo can be used in so many ways. Thanks for posting this

I make a variation on this using all of the ingredients here plus lime.  Fresh garlic is best, but I have used the powder before.  I think the more you refrigerate the pico, the better it is.  I know a lot of people who absolutely hate cilantro.  If you are one of them, leave it out.  Add more or less of the main ingredients to make the recipe yours. Use the freshest ingredients available to impart the cleanest flavor.

Very basic recipe. Needed more liquid. After making it and after reading other reviews the second time I made this I added a little lime juice and a dash of hot sauce. Overall, very good.

this is what I use to make a mesquite smoked red sauce. Because I am too lazy to dice I set the ingredients, coarsely diced onto the top shelf of my smoker while making the rest of dinner. when all else is done I scrape the ingedients into a blender with a little pinch each of lime and lemon zest and a splash of their juice = perfect sauce every time.

Great recipe.  I did add more cilantro than it calls for, and as did several other reviewers, I added fresh lime juice.  Otherwise, we loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added a few more things to it because I love spicy food!  I added some finely diced habanero's and garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  I also added a 1/2 can of whole kernel corn for color!  Thanks so much!

Great home-made salsa. I used tomatoes and pepper from my garden and added lime juice to the recipe as well. Great flavor and great smell.

This is a great base for pico de gallo, you can just add a lot more of ingredients. I would use real garlic and not powder and lime juice really helps bring out the flavors more.

This is a good start.  I add chopped sweet onion, one each fresh squeezed lime and lemon, fresh garlic and salt to taste.  I leave the juice in, as it is too yummy to toss.

I really like the garlic and cilantro taste.  Made it to go with pork tacos. Yumm. Used my food processor "minced" everything. Next time depending on the time of the year--I would use canned chopped tomatoes with better flavor than what is available now.

I never made Pico De Gallo before & used this recipe as a base. I taste tested as I added each ingredient. That helped me to decide on a slight change. I added about 2 teaspoons of lime juice, added more cilantro, and skipped the pepper. I served it over top a grilled top sirloin steak & my boyfriend INHALED it.(he doesnt even like tomatos!)

I was really disappointed in the flavor, it was very bland.  I spent as much time doctoring it up as the original recipe took me.  The end result was pretty good, I added alot of cilantro, juice of one whole lime, fresh minced garlic, and one T. of tabasco for heat.

everyone likes to make changes which is fine since we all have differant taste. When i go to mexico ilive on pico because being vegetarian i don't have alot of choices. It is always fresh tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalepenos And lime juice ,salt . Doesn't get any better than that. I've never been served pico with green onions. Usually regular onion. Love this stuff

Nice bite to it, & so easy to make. I used cloves of garlic instead of powder, just a personal preference. I can't see buying this at the store when it is so easy to make fresh.

Yum!  I made this for a make-your-own-taco buffet at work, and everyone loved it!  I agree that it's much tastier if you let the flavors mingle overnight. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not have spring onion, so I didn't use it. It still turned out good. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Will make again.

This was a good recipe. Thanks! I added an extra green onion and a little more cilantro and some fresh lemon and lime juice.

This was pretty good!  I used a whole jalapeno, and wow was it hot!!  This tasted better the next day as I am sure all Pico does. Something is still missing though..I am on a quest!

It was excellent.  I love pico de gallo, and it's very easy.  Instead of using powder garlic, I used fresh garlic and also added one and a half lemon.  It came out great.  The fresh squeezed lemon really makes a difference.

Real flavorful, I used this with the super fajita marinade (this website) and it was a true authentic taste.

I thought this was a little heavy on the onion.  I will definitely make it again but reduce the onion and possibly increase the tomato and cilantro.  It seems to go well with so many things.  I served it over a little shredded lettuce as a side with the southwestern grilled chicken with lime butter (also on this site).

This is so wonderful and tasty, I could just eat it by itself.  It's even better than Taco Bell (where they do use all fresh ingredients) and Chipotle.  I took it to work for the Mexican feast I made for everyone and they loved it!  Thanks Paula!

REALLY good.  I could eat this with a spoon.  Omitted the jalepeno, because I don't like those, but still...YUM.

So tasty!  I probably quadrupled this since we go through salsa like water.  Used fresh minced garlic instead of powdered.  Also used more jalepeno in ratio since we like ours very spicy.  Will make this all summer long with fresh tomatoes.

This was great.  I did substitute the fresh garlic.
