This was very good. I used round steak that I had on hand and it worked fine. I didn't have any hoisin sauce so I made some.  There's not a recipe on this site so here's the recipe for hoisin. 4 Tbsp Soy sauce, 2 Tbsp Peanut butter,1 Tbsp Honey/molasses,2 tsp White vinegar,1/8 tsp Garlic powder, 2 tsp Sesame seed oil, 20 drops Chinese-style hot sauce, 1/8 tsp Pepper.  My family said "it's a keeper!

this was AWESOME!! word to the wise, its quite sweet, so if you dont like sweet, cut back on the sugar. we loved it!! flank steak was too expensive, so i substituted flap meat and it was so tender.served it over white rice. i also added chili garlic sauce to kick up the heat, maybe 2-3 Tbsp. loved the flavor combo spicy/sweet. thanks for a ridiculously easy and delicious recipe!!!

This was a really good meal. I spread it over a bed of white sticky rice and my wife loved it.   Things I may change for the next time I make this: I used Teriyaki Sauce instead of soy (I didn't have soy sauce), so I should reduce the amount of brown sugar. I would also throw in the green and white onions at about 2hrs into cooking so they don't just turn into sauce, I think if they cooked for less time they would add more appeal and substance to the dish. I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up a little, I think I put in about a tablespoon and it was a mild spice.

I doubled the amount of meat but left the sauce amount the same.  I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and think next time I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce slightly since it seemed a bit overwhelming taste-wise and left an aftertaste.  Followed another reviewer's suggestion to cook 2 hrs. and then add the onion and green onion and cook an additional 2 hrs. and this worked well.  I also skipped the pre-browning in a skillet - since the steak is cooked in a very dark brown sauce, no one could tell that it wasn't pre-browned in a skillet. One less pan to wash!

I used a 2 1/2 lb flank steak so I doubled the sauce, which was probably not necessary since there was so much in the end.  I only added half the brown sugar called for and it was still very sweet.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of asian chili sauce to give it some heat and saved the green onions until it was almost done.  I thought it was excellent!  Served with white rice and green beans.

This was amazing!  My son made it for dinner.  we did double the meat  and there was plenty of sauce for it. Its very tasty...We ate it over rice  and had stir fry on the side.  not really spicy so if you want some heat you need to add it.

Amazingly good! Wanted to try something dfferent. I used 2 lbs. of thin bracciole meat that I sliced thin on an angle into pieces....I coated with the cornstarch and did not fry in the oil....just added right to the crockpot. For the sauce, I used 1/2c. soy, 1c. water, 2 tblspns of brown sugar, 3/4c hoisin, 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Mixed that together and pour that over the beef, onions, and grren onions. Cooked on low for 6 hours... The smell was so great! The sauce thickened nicely and the meat was so tender. Served over steamed broccoli instead of rice for carb reasons....Delicious with pleanty of sauce that was not too sweet. My family loved this dinner. Thanks!

I made this for dinner yesterday, the flank steak was too pricey so I found some thin sliced top sirloin which work fabulously. The meat was very tender, I did though cook 2 pounds instead of 1 and for some reason the hoisin sauce seemed to overpower the soy sauce and as one reviewer mentioned it was too much brown sugar, even for 2 pounds of beef. Overall it was close to the Mongolian beef I like at the Chinese restaurant. The next time I will try to add a little Chinese five spice....

Used Pork Tenderloin because I didn't have beef.  Hubs had two helpings and is now complaining he ate too much.  He did say it was a little salty but I think I might have cooked it too long and made it saltier.  Thanks for sharing

I'm giving this five stars, because I prepared it as written and it was perfect. People why are you even reviewing a recipe that you are altering and then saying it's too salty? Of course it's too salty you cut back on the sugar. The sugar cuts the salt. Where did you learn to cook? If you are going to cut the sugar you have to either use sodium free soy sauce or cut back on that as well.

This was very good. The recipe made a ton of sauce; I used 2 pounds of beef and doubled the sauce and probably didn't need to. I used about half the amount of sugar and it was just right in terms of sweetness.

With the wildly divergent views about this recipe I was a bit apprehensive going in.  I read all the customizations and incorporated a few.  I used 2.5 lbs of flap meat because it was on sale, and it was ideal - I get really impatient cutting meat, and flap was perfect for this purpose since I could practically pull it apart with my hands to make strips.  I skipped the browning stage and threw it all in the pot.  I reduced the brown sugar by half.  I couldn't find fresh ginger so I substituted a pinch of powdered.  I like my onions well cooked so I put them in from the beginning, but they were a little too destroyed after 3 hours on low so next time I'll delay them.  I used Lee Kum Kee brand hoisin.  This turned out astonishingly close to my great local chinese takeaway, about 95% there.  I'll make tiny tweaks next time, maybe a little more ginger if I can't find fresh, just a hair more sugar.  Even with more than double the amount of meat, there was still sauce left over, though I did need to stir it more often while it cooked to keep the meat covered (my slow cooker is oval not circular).  Excellent recipe, not too sweet (with modification), not too salty!  I had to stop myself from eating the whole darned thing.

I used what we call 'braising steak' here in the UK, a cheap cut of meat.Cooked it for 6 hours on low and the meat just fell apart and my wife said she could eat it EVERY day. It is very sweet though - may not add the sugar next time, otherwise, very good!

This is very close to what you would get at PF Chang's.  The only few tweaks you might want to consider are the following:  (1) Put your beef in the freezer for about 15 minutes prior to slicing.  It will make this job a WHOLE lot easier.  (2) The amount of hoisin sauce is a little too much.  In fact, to make this dish more "Chang-like" you should marinate the meat for 2 hours prior to frying (after you slice it).  After slicing the meat, marinate it with the cornstarch, 1/2 c. low-sodium soy sauce and 2 T hoisin sauce before cooking in the oil.  After your 2 hour marinating, then fry the meat.  PF Chang's uses mushroom oil.  I know this is not easy to find, so I would suggest peanut oil.  After your meat is fried/browned then continue on with the recipe as stated, however I would omit the 1/2 Cup hoisin sauce as you already have this in your meat via the marinade.  Also, as many have mentioned, add your veg in the last 1 hour of crock pot cooking.  I know this may add a bit more time, and more attention but following these few tweaks will surely pay off in the final dish.

I skipped the frying step all together.  Cut the sugar in half.  Added a few dried chiles.  Added the onions in the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking.  Thickened it in the last 15 minutes with some of the juice scooped out and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed in.  My hubby said it was better than restaurants, I don't know if I agree but it was pretty darned good! :)

This was good, the only problem I had was the sliced onions.  Not the green onions, the plain.  There was too much and they were hard to eat.

I made the recipe as written, minus half the amount of sugar... it ended up way too salty and the sauce was definitely abundant. I had doubled the recipe and added the onions in when there was only an hour left to cook - that way there was still a little bit of a crunch and the onions were all cooked through. I ended up adding in about a cup of water and some sesame oil to improve the flavor (too much hoisin sauce for me).

I've never had Mongolian Beef in a restaurant, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was simple to put together...I reduced the amount of sugar after reading reviews, but I didn't change anything else. My main complaint it that it was basically just sweet meat...not bad, but sort of one-note. We added some red pepper flakes and it was much better. Next time I'll cook it with added pepper. Not sure if it will be authentic Mongolian beef, but it will suit our tastes much better.

Mongolian beef is meant to be sweet.  If the brown sugar were decreased or omitted from this dish, then it becomes a plain brown sauce. As written, the recipe tastes like PF Chang's Mongolian Beef.  Thanks for sharing, Leith123!

This recipe came out great!  I used about 2 pounds of top round london broil..it's way cheaper than flank steak and I figured it shouldn't matter too much since the slow cooker makes the meat tender anyway.  I didn't double the rest of the ingredients though and they were perfect for the 2 lbs of meat.  I did add some fresh slices of bell peppers and broccoli two hours before it was done.  Very good!

I tried this after work because if I had left it on Low for 10 hours, no telling what it would have been (Mongolian stew?). Instead I cooked it on High for 2 hours. It turned out very well, and the sauce is fantastic. I did add about a teaspoon of red pepper pepper flakes, as others suggested, and it was just spicy enough for us (but we do like spicy). I also added the onions in the last hour, as others suggested as well. I'm giving it four stars instead of five, tho, because it needs a little crunch. I will add broccoli or water chestnuts next time.

Super Yummy with a few changes.  I could only find 1.5 lb flank steak so I went with that and like others, halved the brown sugar, put the green onions in after two hours, and threw in some broccoli florets towards the end.   The one thing I did which I think totally made the dish was throw in two teaspoons of Asian Chili Garlic Sauce (Lee Kum Kee).  The slight kick balanced out the sweetness of the sauce PERFECTLY. Of course, you can add more or less depending on your taste but I had to make it kid friendly.  Overall a great meal.

Easy to throw together for a "fix it and forget it" type of recipe. I used 2lbs. of sirloin that I partially froze so it was easier to cut it into thin strips. I fried the beef in a little sesame oil vs. olive. I opted to use a low sodium soy sauce, chicken broth instead of water and cut back on the brown sugar. To give it a little "kick" I added a tsp. of chili garlic sauce. I cooked it on high for two hours and an additional 2 hours on low. I sliced 2 vidalia onions and 3 bunches of green onion (used a bunchlength wise vs. chopping and added them the last two hours of cooking so they didn't end up mushy. I topped it with toasted sesame seeds and finely chopped green onion. Perfect over a bed of rice!

This was alright, something about the flank steak put me off. I normally have it cooked on a grill and sliced thin against the grain, and the texture has always come out perfect. I've never done flank steak in a slow cooker, and likely never will again because the texture just seemed off. As far as the sauce goes, it was good, nothing I'd write home about. This didn't really remind me of anything Mongolian, in the same way that Chinese food doesn't really taste like anything you'd eat in and around China. If the ratings broke down, I'd give the meat just 3 stars, and the sauce 3.5.

I made this recipe because I had 1/2 a jar of hoisin sauce to use up.  Hubby and I thought this was waaaaaay too sweet.

Just made this for hubby to RAVE reviews! I used skirt steak because thats what I had, sliced it in strips and cooked in the slow cooker with the sauce minus the onions (didnt have any) for four hours. In the last 30 minutes i threw in a bag of frozen broccoli and stirred it all together, served over rice it was a beautiful presentation and a tasty dinner! highly reccomend!

The family loved it! I did take the advice of several of the other reviewers.  I definate agree that 4 hours would be too much, I served it at 3 hours and it was melt in you mouth tender. I had about 1 1/2 lbs of skirt steak but I used the measurements for the 1 lb of meat.  I also used a little less than 1/2 cup of hoison and low sodium soy sauce.  No one thought it was too salty at all.  I also included some broccoli in the last 15 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe and for everyone's reviews.  I will definately be making this one again.

TOO SALTY! I bought the hoisin sauce based upon the sodium content (it had the least amount of sodium) and I just cannot eat this. I really wanted to like this recipe but I won't make this again, sorry. I gave this 2 stars due to the simplicity of the recipe but taste makes it a one.

this was great!  My whole family loved it and it was pretty easy to prepare.  I added some broccoli to it about 1/2 hour before serving just to give it more body (and veggies!).  Might try some red bell pepper next time as well. Served it over steamed rice.  True, it is sweet, but not overly so.

Cut the sugar by half and added Sirachi hot sauce to kick it up a notch.  I found it still to be a little too sweet, but my husband loved it.

Turned out really well.  I did cut the sugar in half and added some red peppler flakes as some others suggested and that was just right for me.  Had to keep stirring the meat and sauce because the sauce was thickening on the bottom but was still grainy on the top.  I added green peppers with the onion for the last hour of cooking time.  I would like to try with broccoli too.

Mongolian Beef has been my Chinese take-out standby for decades so I was excited to try this. I made this almost as written except I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and I still found it to be too sweet for my taste. The flavor on the sauce was ok, but  the onion was not predominant enough for me. I'm looking forward to making this again with serious reduction to the sugar content (less than 1/4 cup) and probably less Hoison Sauce too. I will also add more green onion. I think the cooking time can be reduced as well and that will allow the onions to retain better flavor and texture.

Really good, I took other's advice  and added chili sauce about 1-2 tbsp was spicy just like I like it.  Also added sliced red peppers to the mix in the slow cooker.  Will be making again as tastes just like restaurant quality and much cheaper.

I reduced the brown sugar and hoisin sauce as recommended. I used teriyaki sauce too. My parents owned a Chinese restaurant when I was growing up. This dish is better than I've ever tasted! I added frozen broccoli 15 minutes before it was done to make it "Mongolian Beef and Broccoli". Thanks Leith!

Great flavor.  I added a head of broccoli at the end but it overcooked.  Turned to mush.  Next time I will add veggies for last 10 minutes.

I used steak I had on hand and cut into strips. Mixed it raw with the cornstarch right in the slow cooker. Threw everything else on top  and added 3 dried oriental peppers and cooked on high for 4 hours stirring occasionally. It was amazing!! So thick and saucy!

This turned out AMAZING!  I will not order out for this ever again, though I may change the cut of beef...not sure yet.  I have made a few changes to the recipe, but nothing major.  I am adding 1/2 can of baby corn and 1 can oriental mushrooms.  I am using low sodium soy instead of regular.  I am also lowering the amount of brown sugar (not by much though).  I grate the ginger instead of mince it so it incorporates into the sauce better.  I'm not a huge fan of green onions, but they turned out well, though I cooked them in the pan with the oil before adding the beef and left them in while it cooked. Oh, I didn't use a whole 1/2 cup of hoisin sauce either.  I dropped that to about 1/4 cup.

I liked this but my family didn't, and I'm not really sure why. I did as other reviewers suggested and added the veggies halfway through the cooking time and even so, they more or less disappeared into the final dish. I probably won't make this again since I'm not usually inclined to fuss with crockpot recipes. I like crockpot recipes that can cook all day without any special input. If I need to babysit I may as well make something on the stove.

Very good! I needed to leave it on while at work, so I left the steak whole and still slightly frozen. It was in for 9 hours on low and turned out great; it was falling apart tender so I just sort of shredded it and served with the sauce over rice. I did add about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce for the last half hour of cooking. Also left out the green onions, but I think they would have added a nice touch. Boyfriend approved, thanks for an easy weeknight recipe!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written with the exception of reducing the sugar (only 1/4 cup) and the addition of crushed chilis (1 tsp) for a little Asian kick.   It was very good - hubby had 3 bowls!   Could probably have used less onion (1/2 instead of 1).   Put the onions in after 2 hours of cooking on low as other had suggested and this worked well (the onions didn't lose all of their texture).  Served over glass noodles.

This is so good. Beef is nice and tender and has lots of flavor. 

I added broccoli in the last hour it was cooking. Also added garlic chile paste in the beginning. Served over wheat angel hair pasta with peanuts. Thanks a bunch!

I think that browning the meat first makes it tougher.  There was plenty of sauce.  I used about half the amount of brown sugar, low sodium soy sauce, and no ginger since I didn't have any.  The flavor of the hoisin sauce is very strong - if I made it again, I would use half to 1/3 the amount of that sauce.  I put in frozen broccoli for the last hour of cooking.  It did only need a couple hours to cook, but if you don't brown the meat first, it might need the full time.  Flank steak is expensive which is too bad since neither me or my husband liked this much because of the strong hoisin sauce flavor.

Loved it!  My husband - not a big rice fan - said he would rather have had it over crispy chow mein noodles, but flavor was great.  Reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I cooked meat and put everything into crockpot and put in frigerator for a few hours before cooking, then added extra 1/2 hour since it was cold.  Eating leftovers for lunch!

I used chuck and it turned out great really good flavor and lots of gravy. I used it over fried rice and also plain rice. I think I liked it better over plain because it didn't have to compete with all the other flavors

This had a really good flavor to it. I didn't use the full amount of brown sugar and I used low sodium soy sauce. I have to say that it was still a bit too salty for me and I'm a salt lover. But overall, a good recipe and easy to make!

I don't own a slow cooker so I cooked it in the oven for nearly 5 hours on low. It was very tasty especially with a bit of chili. YUM.

Flavorful and simple. I used a different type of meat. My husband informed me the reason the recipe calls for flank steak is likely so the meat doesn't "fall apart" - which mine did, however it was still a wonderful meal. I kicke up the heat with a little chili oil and red-pepper flakes and served over rice noodles. Kids and hubby all had seconds and loved every bite!

This has become a family favorite ever since I first made it. I use the exact ingredients listed, but to make it even easier, I don't brown the beef first - I just throw everything into the slow-cooker (except for the green onion - I put those in towards the end) and it always turns out great!

This was good! After reading all the complaints, I cut down the brown sugar and (reduced sodium) soy sauce to 1/4 c. I got a bit carried away with the fresh ginger... just a bit. I don't like onions too much, so I just used 1/4. With the ease of preparation and that it cooks on LOW for 4 hours, definitely a keeper(:

Yummy! I did not have hoisin sauce, so I used mixture suggested in reviews by CAROLC80.  I used 2 lbs of round steak and cooked on low for 3 hrs. My kids don't like onions, so I liked the idea that they disappeared into the sauce if cooked for the full time with the meat...it worked! I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was still a little too sweet. The soy sauce was a little over powering, but that might have been due to my homemade hoisin sauce.  I  also coated meat with flour and tossed into crock without browning. I will make again with less soy sauce and sugar. Thanks!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe, but next time will most likely just double the meat as this makes PLENTY of sauce.  I did add the onions two hours into cook time, put extra ginger in with an hour left for extra flavor.

This was my first time buying flank steak, and i think it's a very good meat cut for this recipe. I did not find this recipe to be too salty nor toow sweet, however,  i did use 1.5 cups of water instead of just 1/2 cup. I also did not slow cook, i made it on the stove top and let it simmer on low for about 30 minutes. I think if i had simmered it for another 30 minutes, the steak would ahve been perfectly tenderized, but not mushy. My boyfriend was a little bit indifferent about the recipe, but i quite liked it. I added mushrooms and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.

This was unbelievable. My family ate every single scrap and were looking for more!!  I didn't have hoisin sauce so I simply added some more soy and sesame oil. Next time, I would probably put some jam in as it was a tad salty (because of my additions) but regardless.. this was out of the world!! So unbelievably tender!! A must keep!!

I always love slow cooker recipes.  This is one that I will be making again.  My husband really enjoyed the flavour.  I didn't have enough corn starch and imagine that the sauce would be nice and thick if I had had enough...I guess I will find out next time!

Given what other reviewers had said, I changed it up a bit to add more flavor - added 1/4t red pepper flakes & 1/4t chinese mustard. Also used beef broth instead of water.  Skipped the browning step for lack of time.    I personally didn't like the smell - probably the cardamom in the hoisin - but everyone else thought it smelled fine.  Tasted good, which is  the main thing.  Will probably put it in  the slow cooker rotation.

I started cooking this earlier to have for dinner tonight and can't keep myself away from "testing" it.  So good!  Can't wait for dinner!  I also added about a tbsp. of crushed red pepper flakes and ended up using dried onion flakes instead of the onion since I forgot to buy one at the store.

I made this as well as the House Fried Rice recipe. They were both absolutely awesome. Instead of doing the slow cooker though I cooked the meat in the sauce on the stove for 30 minutes at medium heat. This helped the meat soak in the flavor without the hours in a slow cooker. Delicious and less time consuming way to do it.

This was really saucy.  I'd suggest doubling the meat & keeping the sauce measurements the same.  I've never had real mongolian beef so I have nothing to compare this to.  It tasted fine, but if I'm going to buy steak I'd rather use it in a recipe that "wow"s me more than this one did.

I have made many diferent variations of mongolian beef before, but I did not care for this. I think the 1/2 cup of hoisin sauce ruined it. Maybe if it had only 1 teaspoon of hoisin sauce it would have been better.

My family liked this. I thought it was it okay. It tasted good but I could not get past the smell. The sauce smelled a little weird to me.

This was a good recipe, wish I had added some vegetables.  The sauce had a very strong, condensed flavor.

This was fantastic! I used another's post to make the hoisin sauce, but substituted red pepper flakes for the Chinese heat - I didn't want it hot at all.   Halved the sauce and it worked out just fine to coat all meat (cut up a boneless roast I had in the freezer and it turned out tender and wonderful). I also added both types of onions with 1/2 hour left of cooking so they were limp but not disintegrated.

I really enjoy this recipe.I cooked it for my Dad and I. This is the closest thing I have ever made to the asian restaurants back home in San Francisco. I used pork shoulder instead and just cut it down to size. You may want to make some adjustments depending on how sweet you like a recipe to be and also there is always room for more spice if that's your thing too. Cheers to the one who created this recipe!

Added bell peppers, carrots and sliced onions after about 1/12 hours of cooking.  Served over rice.  Very good, but is missing some ingredient (spice?), to make a five star recipe.

I didn't bother to cut the steak into cubes.  I put the whole flank steak in the crock pot after browning it.  Cooked it on low for at least 8 hours and the beef just fell apart.  I spiralized the onions instead of slicing them.  Can serve with rice, potatoes, whatever you like to soak up the awesome sauce!  What a great simple dish!

This one is a keeper.  Doubled the recipe (including the sauce) because we always like extra and followed ingredients list all as written with the exception of low sodium soy sauce and used skirt steak instead of flank (since the grocery store was out) and added crush red pepper to add some spice.  I didn't bother to pan fry the meat first but did let everything soak in the crockpot for an hour or so before I started it mostly because it was too early to start it.  I also added the onions in the last hour.   Only change I will make next time is using a better cut of meat.  Super good, super easy and relatively cheap to make.   Would be great for casual gathering of friends.

It paired well with the vegetable fried rice. After 4 hours in the slow cooker the beef fell apart. That being said, the fluids cooked down and it ended up a bit salty rather than sweet. It's also important to note, the prep time of 10 minutes is AFTER you have all your ingredients measured and places in meece cups. If you include the time to chop and measure ingredients, the prep time is closer to an hour. Still a great meal. Beats the heck out of the chain restaurants in the food court.

Quite simple and tasty! I purchased beef for stir-fry and it couldn't have been easier. We served it with white rice, stir-fry California blend vegetables and with Easy Egg Drop Soup from this site. We will definitely make it again.

I followed recipe other than cut sugar to 1/3cup. Its really tasty but bit salty for me. Next time i would cut down soy sauce to 1/4cup. And add dash of crushed red pepper flake.

After two disastrous attempts in the crockpot I cooked this in a skillet on the stove. It turned out really well. It was mushy & gross in the crockpot. I wish there was a way for people to comment on comments. Maybe I'd find out what I'm doing wrong.

I made this recipe and i must say that it was delicious.  The recipe calls for 4 hours of cooking, well, make sure you do not over cook it.  I did, i set my slow cooker for 4 hrs but after it's done it automatically goes to warm - i guess the warm setting turned my flank steak cubes to shreds.  The taste was wonderful, but this is not a recipe that you can walk away from.  I can't wait to try this one again.

Loved the flavor! Loved how easy it was even more! I thought the flavor was similar to the type of dish I would get at a restaurant. Thank you! Oh and I used less brown sugar as I knew my family wouldn't want it as sweet.

We are splitting this one down the middle.  The teenager really liked it, but my husband and I barely managed to get a bowl of it down.  It's far too sweet for us, even though I reduced the sugar by half, and the hoisin flavor was a little too prominent.  It was certainly very easy, but I don't think we'll make again.  Thanks for the recipe to try, though!  It's one the teenager can add to his repertoire, and that's always good!

Used some beef shoulder cuts. Left it in the crock pot on high for 3 hours. Threw that bad boy on some white rice and smothered it with that thick, sweet sauce. Dunzo. 

Time for a nap. 

This recipe is bomb.

I made one major mistake and it still turned out great!! I didn't cut up my meat. I seared it, then put it in the crock pot. I always use 1/2 meats when I use the slow cooker, so that may have been what saved me. I set it to low for the first three hours, then cranked it up to high for the last hour. Mmmmm.... It was wonderful! Served it over jasmin rice and now have another family favorite. Way to go!!

So excited to try this recipe for my husband and kids.  I used flap meat and half of it disintegrated into the sauce which ends up being too sweet due to the sugar.  Definitely not going to try this one again.

Did not love this.  It was really saucy and in 4 hours the onions became really limp and over cooked. The amount of hoisin is significantly higher than in other recipes.  If I had it to do over, I'd lessen the amount of sugar, only add a tablespoon of hoisin sauce, and I'd hold off on adding the onions until near the end.  Think I'll try another recipe next time.

I follwed this recipe exactly as written (other than adding onions in the last hour) and the meat was very tender.  But the sauce was way too sweet and didn't taste at all like the Mongolian beef we've had at dozens of chinese restaurants.  Almost inedible...won't be making this again.

My husband & I love this meal....i add the onions in at the last hour or so of cooking so they are not too soft or mushy.  I also double the amount of green onions & make a little extra sauce.  We enjoy this with wheat noodles.quick, easy, delicious dinner.

Delicious!! I used boneless beef short ribs instead of flank steak.  Usually I'm not a fan of the slow cooker because most everything I put in it tastes like boiled meat.  But this recipe (with the short ribs) was amazing.

I used a cheaper cut of meat because it was going to be way too much money to get enough flank steak. I wish I hadn't skimped though because the meat, while tender, just wasn't quite up to par. The recipe was good, but it didn't taste like Mongolian beef to me (but it did look like it!). I also cut the sugar, although swapping it with Orange Juice in the future might be something to try.

I was skeptical, but it turned out very good!! I will be making this again. I didn't stray too far from the original recipe... I cut back on the sugar and soy sauce just a tad, I added a couple tablespoons of chili garlic sauce, and threw in a bag frozen broccoli for the last 30 minutes.  Served it over white jasmine rice.  I think next time I may change the meat to something else, or maybe just slice the flank steak a little thinner (as I had cubed it); it seemed just a little tough.  Very good overall, a well deserved 4-stars!

I loved this ... my family didn't, which is a bummer. I thought the flavor was very good. I don't think my kids were fond of the hoisin. I ran out of time in the morning, so I just stuck a "london broil" cut in the crock pot whole and covered it with the ingredients. It cooked on low for about 9 hours. I couldn't even pick the meat up to cut it, it just fell apart. I said that I wished the sauce had been thicker, but then remembered that I was supposed to have coated the meat in cornstarch first. Duh. Anyway ... I enjoyed it. Served it on brown rice with chopped broccoli and julienne carrots.

This was very  easy. I doubled meat and didnt cut back sugar.  My husband wouldnt even taste it the first night but tried a bite from my son the next day. When i got home from work his first words were " that stuff is slammin can u make some more".  So this recipe is a keeper!

I made this a few days ago. It was a hit. I did take the advice of others and used 1/4 C. brown sugar. You must use LOW-SODIUM soy sauce with this recipe or it will be way too salty for most. This was even better the next day. I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe and took the suggestion of others, using less sugar, and it was delicious!! So delicious that it was intended to serve 4, but only fed 3 and one wanted more. I will definitely be making this again... and tripling the recipe!

This was amazing! I offered my kids a taste before dinner and they wouldn't stop eating it. My hubby also thought it was delicious and we will definitely make it again. I marinated the meat I'm the sauce overnight beforehand and added green peppers and waterchestnuts. I also added a little vinegar and some red pepper flakes to the sauce. I didn't find it either too salty or too sweet so maybe those things helped. Definite keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe up until about 25 minutes ago when I had to start drinking water like a fish to quench my thirst. The only thing I would change is the type of soy sauce and I will buy low sodium sauce just to make this recipe, that is how tasty it is. I added zucchini and mushrooms and I really could eat it every day...with less salt!

This recipe does need a few tweaks or I would have rated it much lower.

First, you ABSOLUTELY must use low sodium soy sauce.  I did this and I was able to get the flavor without it being too salty.  I suspect it would have been inedible if I hadn't done this.

Second, cut the sugar down by half (to 1/4 cup).

Third, it still would have been too sweet if I hadn't also added about 2 tablespoons Sriracha hot Asian chili sauce.  This or an Asian red chili/garlic sauce is absolutely necessary.  

As other reviewers have stated, flank steak is not necessary.  I used top round steak and it came out beautifully.  I imagine any lean beef such as a top round, skirt steak or London broil would work well. I also added a bit more ginger and garlic. Sliced mushrooms were also added in as it was very saucy and needed more texture.

The next time I do this, I'll add one or more of the following:  water chestnuts, baby corn on the cob, broccoli, peanuts, green pepper.

With the changes I did make, it's still a 5-star recipe.

I used a couple of pounds of cheap round steak cut into very thin strips.  Cooked it on low 2 hours, then added onions and garlic, cooked one more hour, added a frozen bag of stir-fry veggies and cooked one more hour.  Meat was perfectly tender and the veggies were also perfect.  Would have liked it to be a little spicier, however.

This was an excellent dish.  I had kind of a tough cut of meat that I slow cooked all day and it almost melted in the mouth.  My husband raved about it.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  It went great with some oriental noodles and a stirfry and spring rolls.  Yummy!

This was really good. I cut the brown sugar by half because of what I read in other reviews. I used sirloin instead of flank to make it less costly. I also added red chili flakes and a couple splashes of hot sauce to spice up a bit. The only issue I had was that the cooking time seems too long. I cut off the slow cooker after a little over 3 hours and the sauce was a little burnt and very dark. Definitely will make it again and modify a little bit. I think I will do what another reviewer suggested and wait to add the onions until later so they maintain some firmness.

Even with the low-sodium soy sauce it was still salty.  Despite adding extra ginger, it only tasted of soy sauce.  I don't find soy sauce nice enough to stand on its own.  I made it with chicken breast, perhaps the lack of fat made it less enjoyable.  I've never been a dark meat person though.  That being said, for those of you who do like it and want to make it with chicken breast, a good way to get the chicken to mix with the sauce (and thus keep the flavor) is to shred it into chunks.  Don't need the cornstarch this way.  I served it on white rice with steamed broccoli.

We love any kind of Asian food- Chinese, Thai, Mandarin~ not many recipes satisfy our taste for the restaurant version until this one!  I added about 2 tsp of powdered garlic, 1 or 2 more onions (and thicker sliced) and chopped water chestnuts.  On recommdtn. of others added broc., but only in last 5 min so it would stay crisp tender. It's a keeper and SO simple!

Really tasty!  I was a litlte put off when I first made it  because my beef cook down to mush.  Next time I may not leave it in the slow cooker the full time.  But once I got past the texture it was delicious.  I agree with others that the sauce is definitely super sweet - but I like sweet.  Again, I followed the advice of others and added the onions later in the cooking process (with about 1hr to go).  I also added chopped carrots at that time, to up the veggies in this recipe, trying to get them in where I can.  I served this over brown rice and with steamed broccoli.  Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent overall.   Too sweet for my taste so I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Also threw in a can of drained water chestnuts in the last 30 minutes to add a little crunch.

Really wanted this to be good and a timesaver. it was very tender, but the meat (even in the juice) was dry and stringy. I did not use a cheap cut of meat either.

I don't like to alter a recipe but sometimes you have to based on what you have on hand. I used 2 lbs of beef stew meat and cut it into smaller pieces. I only had 1/4 of soy so I made up the rest with teriyaki sauce. I did cut the brown sugar to 1/4c and sprinkled some red pepper flakes. Fresh ginger is key, it makes the dish taste like real Chinese take out. I will use another onion next time and put it in about half way next time.

I used chicken for this recipe b/c that's what I had on hand.  I liked being able to use the slow cooker, makes everything easier.  I was low on hoisin sauce so I made some with the recipe from the other reviewer.  I added onion and water chestnuts and served over soba noodles.  Overall the taste was good, but we like it a little more spicy so will try adding some chili sauce next time.

It was good but I used half as much brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  Followed others advice to add green onions later in the cooking.  At last minute I threw in some steamed broccoli florets to have more veg.  Over rice, it is a one dish meal. - Susie

Very good flavor, quick and easy preparation.  Like other reviewers, used about half as much sugar.  The only other change I might try next is to add just a little bit of small hot peppers during the last hour of cooking time, just to give it a little zip.  Thanks for the post!

I gave this 4 stars because the top round I used turned to mush.  The flavor was fantastic but the texture wasn't.  I will try it again.  I was given a new slow cooker, a Hamilton Beach and it really heats up fast and drys out too quickly.  I'm used to being able to leave it all day and not check it.  With this cooker I have to be vigilant.

too sweet, needed a punch of heat, and the cornstarch on the beef added a weird texture.

I'm surprised the rating on this isn't higher, it's really, really good. I actually used 2 pounds of steak instead of 2 and didn't bother to double the sauce as a lot of the other reviewers said there was too much. I needed to add another 1/2 cup of water about halfway through, but that's quite common with my slow-cooker. I think it cooks a bit hotter than most. Finally, about an hour before serving, I threw in one chopped red pepper, which made it look much more appetizing. We both we really liked this so I'll definitely make it again.

This was quite tasty, I was worried after reading peoples reviews as the flank steak is quite expensive and I didn't want it to go to waste, so I made it with the other peoples adjustments of 1/4c of soya and brown sugar. We added steamed broccoli after the fact.  I will def make this again but I will not buy flank steak. It was to expensive and I really thought any beef would work with this!  I will try chicken next as I kept thinking Chicken would go well with the sauce!

Wonderful flavor! When I make Asian food I always shop for sauces, etc. at an Asian market. I think their sauces are more flavorful than those you find in a regular grocery store. I am lucky to have one close to my home! I also used low sodium soy sauce and doubled the onions. This was fabulous!

always a winner in my house, the hubby & our 1,2 yr old kiddos love it. I always forget to grab ginger when I'm at the store so minus that. Then less on the brown sugar.

would've enjoyed the taste much more if not overwhelmed by the saltiness.   With over 13000mg of sodium in this dish, looking for sodium reduced ingrediants (soya sauce, hoisin sauce) if that is possible would be good.

I thought the recipe was terrible. It was way too sweet and mushy. I am upset that I wasted a pound of my venison to make this recipe. If I ever made it again I would cut the sugar and hoisin at least in half.

This smelled awesome cooking, however we served with Chinese noodles but it was way too salty. I think next time I cook this I'm going to be decreasing the soy sauce which is very salty to being with. Update: I had to try this recipe again because of how wonderful it smelled cooking, however I am sad to say I will not be using this recipe again...I decreased the soy sauce and it was less salty but I think I decreased it too much because it took the flavor right along with it. :(

Delicious!!! When I cooked this, I used a pan instead of the slow cooker. Frying the meat in a pan keeps it nice and crispy with the sauce. I also use thin cut slices of beef. It turned out amazing!!!

Chinese style not a fav at home so I changed it. Added cut carrots and sliced mushrooms toward end. Used pork tenderloin cut in 3 chunks so it could be arranged in slices showing meat's color edged in browned sear. Served slices over noodles, topped with veggies and sauce  and with separately cooked green veggi+e (whole green beans first, brocolli second night), Fork tender. He loved it. Will make again.

If you have 2 pounds of meat you do not need to double the sauce. I had 4 pounds of steak and tripled the sauce and it was too much. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will only double it for 4 pounds. Other than that I suggest adding other vegetables like broccoli. Yummmm!

Made it with 2 lb flank steak, and added mushrooms (used same amount of sauce, there was plenty).  The only change i will make next time is to add a little more cornstarch (we like the sauce thicker).We really loved it.  We will definitely make again!

I made double quantity and fed quite a few people, served with broccoli and steamed rice.
Everyone commented on how tasty it was.

It was just ok. I wouldn't bother with it again. It definitely could use a vegetable.  I would think the broccoli would be best served on the side as this dark color would take over any green veggie. Maybe even mushrooms. Something is missing and I can't figure what.  The Hoisin sauce was a little overpowering. Maybe a little less. I added a little red pepper flakes but it didn't change much. I added half the sugar.

I made this as written, except I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar because of all the comments saying it was too sweet. Definitely still too sweet for my tastes. This definitely doesn't taste like what I get at my local Chinese restaurants, but I appreciated the ease of the recipe. I'd probably only use 1-2 Tbsp sugar next time, and use less hoisin sauce as the flavor was overpowering.  The meat also fell apart into crumbles, so this could probably benefit from less time in the slow cooker. The boyfriend did say he liked it, but found it "a little sweet". He added Sriracha to his. I also agree with the others who said adding the onions in later so they don't get mushy. In terms of it being too salt, I used low sodium soy sauce, which was fine.

I tripled this recipe for family and friends and everybody LOVED it.....just loved it.   I served it with steamed rice, a red wine vinegar based slaw, sparkling water and beer, and an orange sherbet with plain wafers for dessert.  It was a hit.  Even my young friend (in college), who doesn't cook, asked for the recipe.  I added some sliced water chestnuts to the mix for crunch and interest, stirred in the sliced green onions toward the end of the cooking time, and cut my onion slices a little larger to ensure they could be "seen" on the plate.  My Ukranian friend couldn't eat enough of it....I'll definitely make this again.

Didn't taste like Chinese food at all.  My husband doctored his up with red pepper flakes and soy sauce, he thought it was ok but I wouldn't make it again.  Probably best to buy flank steak in cut up pieces from the butcher instead of cutting it yourself.

Truly simple and delicious dish.  I forgot the water but it didn't affect it at all.  Personally, I would add a few dried hot peppers to spice it up a notch but my wife is not a fan of spicy.

I added 1 tsp of chili paste for a little heat, which was awesome. I also made everything up the night before and let it marinade overnight, which I think really let the meat pick up the flavour and tenderness. Highly recommended.

This was good but we didn't feel it was overly great. Definitely sweet so reduce sugar if you are not a sweet person. Chili paste or powder would be a good addition. Flank steak  is more for stir fry and fell a part because of how tender it was. It was good just did have big chunks of steak. Will use round steak in the future. I put broccoli florets in the crockpot with ~15-20 mins left to cook which was a great addition.

I've never had Mongolian beef in a restaurant so I can't compare it.  This was good, but there was way too much sauce- it was a little over powering.  So next time I'd make 1/2 the sauce.  I also felt like it needed a vegetable, maybe broccoli or sugar snap peas.

made it as the recipe says but added green onions toward the end of the cook, used powdered ginger because I couldn't find a fresh root and used a large slice of left over prime rib which was already cooked so did not coat and pan fry the meat.

Loved the ease of this recipe. I used thinly sliced moose. Super tender. It would be great with any game meat. Kids loved it too. A tad salty but not bad. I added red peppers and broccoli near the end of cooking. This will go in my favorites. Yum!

I made this using my Instant Pot. After browning the meat, I cooked it with high pressure for 13 minutes and 15 minutes NPR. I used half the amount of sugar and thought it was still very sweet. It makes a ton of sauce! Next time I'll either double the meat or cut the sauce in half. Very good, easy recipe!

Made as directed but reduced brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. I only ended up cooking in slow cooker on low for 3 hours because It was developing a burnt weird smell. I did stir after 2 hours and there was a thick build up around the edges. I love all the ingredients in this dish.. But somewhere along the way the flavors didn't work for me. I believe it may be the onion in the slow cooker. I ate a small portion as it was my dinner. I squeezed some lime on my plate and the acidity was just what it needs to make it not a one note dish.

This was pretty good but had kind of a weird lumpy texture to it.  I used stew meat instead of flank steak and had to make hoisin sauce from a recipe since I didn't have any on hand.  I think that may have caused the weird texture.  It had nice flavor though.

I would definitely make again! I read all of the reviews and decided to make it just as the recipe shows.  Wow! It was fantastic.  This is an easy recipe and very simple to prepare. I added some red pepper flakes because I like a little more heat to my Mongolian beef and hoisin sauce isn't overly spicy.

We used rib eye steak cut up for this and used honey instead of brown sugar. Turned out just as good as my favorite Chinese restaurant makes. My children gobbled it up!

Very tasty and super simple.  I made one for the crock immediately and a second one or the freezer to crock later.   did make a couple changes as I am diabetic and the sugar content was too high and the veggies too low for a successful diabetic meal.  I decreased the soy by half and also the sugar,  I added about 3 cups of broccoli florets. I added a bit of beef stock to make up for the missing soy.

I know this is really now broccoli-beef , but want to thank the author for the inspiration of this meal.  every one loved it and the rest of the family had over white rice...I had with quinoa.  

Made a bag of all the ingredients (except the broccoli) for the freezer to crock another busy work day.  I don't like how fresh veggies go mushy when yo freeze them, so will add fresh broccoli and maybe carrots when ready to crock next time.

Thank you again for a brilliant crockpotting idea!

The recipe was very good as written; however, as a diabetic I had to reduce the sugar.  My son said it could use some more heat.  I passed him the hot sauce and said "knock yourself out". My husband  agreed the heat was perfect for us.

Will definitely make again... I took the advice of some reviewers .... 3/4 cup hoisin , 2 tbl brown sugar, 1tsp ginger . I think I should have also added the green onions the last hour maybe. So much sauce I could have easily doubled the meat and this dish would have been just as tasty!  Oh and skipped browning the meat but that's because I'm lazy! I will try that next time :) Thanks for sharing !!

As noted in other reviews, reduced sugar, hoisin and soy sauce (also used reduced sodium soy sauce)  Reduced  cooking time to three hours. Added a healthy shot of Siracha sauce. Was very good. A little wetter than I would like, will reduce water as well next time.

This was very  good. I did follow others advice on cutting brown sugar in half.  Tasted perfect. It made a lot of sauce but I'm not sure exactly how much flank steak I used.  I'm sure it was at least a pound.

Per many reviewers I doubled the meat and the corn starch. Unfortunately the sauce became a gooey mess. Meat and sauce was jelly like not appetizing. Per another reviewer or two I added red peppers, which with the weirdness of the hoisin sauce didn't work.

So, it is just my husband and me.  When I made this we both really enjoyed the flavor, I served it over rice.  When we were done, I mixed the rice in and popped it in the fridge for left-overs.  I did a quick stir-fry and it was so amazing!  It was like a bonus, two different meals with not a lot of effort.  I will be making this again, and will make sure I have plenty for left-overs :)

It was good.  I made three times the amount.  The meat was tender.  I used a little less soy sauce because I ran out.  It was not too salty.  I used a different cut of meat (top sirloin?)

This was delicious! I switched out the beef for chicken breast, however, to make it healthier and it was awesome! I think next time I will add some steamed veggies to give it some variety. Snap or snow peas, broccoli, and bell peppers would go best I think.

This is a simple and easy recipe. I was so shocked to see how it tasted just like the mongolian beef at my favorite local chinese restaraunt. Now I can make one of my favorite chinese dishes at home easily and much cheaper. Oh and a plus, the kids loved it too!

I made this with low-sodium soy sauce and avoided some of the saltiness others have commented on. I used slightly more beef and just added about 1/4 cup more of water, soy and hoisin and there was plenty of sauce. Paired it with broccoli and it was a great Friday night meal with lots of leftovers.

this was good, nice touch of sweetness to the beef.  I didn't bother w/the slow cooker; just marinated the meat over night, then seared on grill pan.

This was very good and will make again. Like some, I reduced the sugar a bit and added about 6-8 flakes of red pepper for a very slight zip. I served with Jasmin rice with roasted sweet red pepper and onion.  Family gave it a thumbs up.

The recipe is okay but I has some issues with it.  First of all it was way too dry and I had to add another half cup of liquid to it.  Secondly I added broccoli because this didn't produce enough food... Even over rice,  it didn't create enough to feed four people. 

I substituted chicken stock for water and omitted the hoisin because it was going to be way too salty. 

With these changes it was good.

My kids liked it! I substituted stew meat(which is what I happened to have on hand).  I tenderized it with a mallet, and cut it into smaller strips. After that I followed the recipie as it was.  It cooked a little too fast in my slow cooker so I am going to decrease the cooking time and add a little more water.  We also added in some water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and mini corn right before we served it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I don't think the hoisin sauce belongs in this recipe, it added a weird BBQ type flavor, and definitely add the vegetables (onions, etc) during the last 1-2 hours of cooking. 

I  recommend not cooking this in the slow cooker, I think it adds to the nasty flavor.

I was so excited to try this recipe - but what an epic failure! It was horrible.

Suggestions: hoisin sauce is overpowering so you really better like it, try the recipe with a cheaper cut of meat, and Kelly (Jan 2015) had a thought to try cooking in a skillet. Any changes have to be better than written as is.

It was not to my liking. the hoisin and ginger flavors were waay to strong. the onions and the pepper I added were mush by the time the it was "done" cooking. So i would suggest adding any veggies you want to add much later into the cooking time.

Next time, cut back on the sugar, use regular (not reduced sodium like I did) soy sauce, and follow other poster's suggestion of adding onions the last 2 hours of cooking. I also think mushrooms would be a nice addition to this dish.

Make. Eat. Repeat. This was easy and delish. Used 1 1/2 lbs of flank and meat/sauce ratio was perfect. Used 1/4 cup of sugar and sweetness was perfect.  I did put chili pepper flakes and tripled the ginger amount.  I will make this again and again. YUMMMMMMY! Served with rice and brocoli??

This was good, not great. Not sure if my crock runs too hot? I followed recommended time, but it seemed a little too done. Next time I will shorten the cooking time, and omit some of the sweetness, maybe jam.

I made this recipe because I am a big fan of slow cooker recipes. I wanted something different from the usual roast or stew kind of recipe and I definitely got something different. I had never had hoison sauce before so I did not know how sweet it was. Luckily I tasted the sauce before putting in the rest of the sugar. I only used a 1/4 a cup of sugar because I thought the hoison sauce was sweet enough on its own. That being said I probably could have omitted it all together. My husband liked the recipe more than I did, it was just a little too sweet for me. Next time I'm going to try what other people have, and add the onions later, omit the sugar, and maybe add a little sesame oil. Overall it was a good meal though.

This recipe was perfect. This is what I did: I cut the sugar in half, added some red pepper flakes, and followed the homemade Hoisin sauce recipe from the comments section. I waited until about 3 hours in to add the onions so that they would still be crunchy, and I stir fried some broccoli, then tossed it in with beef on the last half hour. The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was the perfecy ratio of salty to sweet.

I was under-whelmed by this recipe.  I did follow the recipe with only a substitution of London Broil as the beef.  While it was very tender and flavorful, it did not taste like Chinese.  It tasted more like a pot roast.

Okay this was really good, did motify the recipe, used round steak instead of flank. Reduced soy sauce slightly, only used 1/4 cup brown sugar, did not have green onion substituted with green pepper, and added 1/2 tsp. Crushed red pepper. I used double the meat but could have used alot more since the sauce in this is abundant, was worried about not doubling the recipe for sauce, there is no need plenty of sauce. Kids loved it and so did I, keeper for recipe book.

Definitely a great easy recipe for my favorite appliance....The Slow Cooker! I liked the sweetness, but next time I will put the onions in after 2 hours time has passed, they were just a little too mushy. I will also add some red bell peppers and a little chile sauce to kick it up a bit.

My family really liked this recipe. I did change a few things. I added the onions & some red & green bell pepper coarsely chopped  the last hour. I served sriracha on it to kick up the heat. Served over rice. Definitely will make this again.

Too salty. Either reduce soy sauce, or increase sugar. Too much sugar would make it too sweet, so add a bit at a time, tasting as you go. Chemically, sugar cancels out salt. (Na+ vs. OH- branches on glucose molecules). So you should reach a balance point where its neither too salty or too sweet as long as you adjust proportions slowly.
Also tended to stick to pot at the bottom. Maybe use a crockpot liner or add more liquid to avoid burning the bottom.

I didn't care for this recipe for a number of reason. It had too much sauce, was too sweet, and the onions were mushy. I would not coat the meat in corn starch as you really can't brown it with cornstarch. It should be browned in flour. And it really didn't taste like Mongolian Beef.

DELICIOUS! I used chuck steak (2 lb). Instead of hoisin sauce I used peanut sauce (Thai) and the whole bunch of green onions,not just 3 stalks. I had no fresh ginger so I used powdered.  I did not bother to brown the meat first.  I just through everything in the slow cooker and cooked it on low all day. Served it over a bed of Jasmine rice. Awesome!

I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves a rave. I followed the directions almost exactly, except I used super-cheap, thin-cut eye of round, and it turned out ridiculously well. It tastes like Korean BBQ, which is awesome, and I was surprised that the onions still had some crunch after four hours. I served it over brown rice the first night, then the second night I just put the leftovers back in the crock pot with some bean sprouts and some frozen stir fry veg, served it in a bowl with cellophane noodles, and the second time was just as good. I will be trying this with chicken next, and maybe with some water chestnuts and bamboo shoots, things that will hold up in the crock pot like the onions. Super easy, fantastic flavor, totally recommended as written, but has tons of potential. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe exactly. As other reviewers suggested, I put in the green onions for the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking so they weren't so mushy. It was a delicious recipe but was a little sweet. Next time I might cut back just a little on the brown sugar to see how it comes out but all in all, it was really good as published. Ate it with rice and steamed carrots. Yum.

Great base recipe. I use a little less soy and a little more water. Beef or chicken, I find this a favorite of my kids. I add just a touch of sesame oil as well.

I have this in my slow cooker now..it's a good recipe, but I make this on the stovetop regularly...one skillet, and, start to finish, maybe 25 minutes. If I have to dirty a skillet anyway, I'm not sure why I would want to make the slow cooker version. And I don't think I would want to put the uncooked beef in at the start. Obviously, the meat will cook thoroughly in the crockpot, but I think the slight carmelization on the edges adds something to the finished dish.

Made this for dinner tonight and absolutely loved it.  We used 1 lb skirt steak and cut it into strips. I didn't brown the steak before putting it in the slow cooker.  I put everything in the slow cooker except the onion, let that cook for 2.5 hours, then I put in the onions for another hour.  It was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be having this again.  We served it with brown rice and string beans.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe would be quick and easy, which it was. However, I followed the exact instructions and it turned out mushy and super sweet. It was inedible and I was left disappointed with no dinner after a long day. I would not recommend this recipe unless you like food that tastes like sugar and basically just hoisin sauce.

Tried it because we love Asian food. It was okay, but not the flavor I was looking for. Trying to capture the PF Chang's and Pei Wei flavor.

I made this recipe last night - following some other reviews I cut back the sugar by about a third, used sodium reduced gluten free soy sauce and added the green onion after 2 hours.  I doubled the meat but left the amount of sauce the same.  I also skipped the step with the corn starch and the browning, it didn't need it.  I sliced the flank in about 1/2 inch thick slices across the grain and then cut into about 1 inch long pieces.
I cooked for exactly 4 hours and it was tender and delicious.
At about 3.5 hours I took out as much of the sauce as I could and reduced it in a sauce pan until it thickened up.  
When serving the meat I took it out of the slow cooker with a slotted spoon letting the loose sauce drain off - transferred it into a serving dish and poured over the reduced sauce, which was delicious.

I served with broccoli slaw sauteed with butter and added a little soy sauce, rice vinegar and sugar dressing when serving and a fried rice.

I definitely won't be making it again. Way too much sauce, even when I doubled the meat portion.  If you do decide to give it a go, be sure to slice the beef very thin. Mine was cubed and the texture was strange.

Great flavor and very easy to make.  However, I would skip the step with the cornstarch and browning and just add the meat to the crockpot as is.  The cornstarch made the sauce a little gelatinous and I would have preferred it to be a little thinner.

It was quite good. I liked it, but didn't love it. But everyone in the family liked it and it tasted very good several days later and reheated well, so it's a recipe I'd make again.

I took suggestions from other reviews and doubled the amount of beef. I splurged and used cubed New York Strip, which ended up costing over $30 just in beef, but it made it very tasty and tender.

I also added Sriracha sauce to make it spicier.

Not impressed at all. I expected a more sweet flavor & instead it was very bitter. Needs some tweaking. Meat was almost too tender & definitely you need to cook way more than the recipe calls for. The was way too much sauce compared to meat.

I suggest making sure to "beat" the steak until its thin throughout so that it crisps up better in the pan.  I think I would have enjoyed this recipe more had I done that.  I also would cut the sauce down by about a fourth and add more hot spice to it.  I doubt I'll make it again unless I get a random craving for it.

This was AWSOME! Made it for dinner tonight. I got one plateful and hubs ate ALL the rest. So much for leftovers. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes since we like a bit of heat. This is a perfect recipe. Highly recommend it.

I used exact measurements for this recipe and it was unedible.  The salt was overwhelming (soy sauce) and the hoisin was entirely too strong.  I washed it off, throwing the sauce away and keeping the meat.  I will have to figure out what to do with the cooked meat so that I can eat it, I cannot throw it out, I paid $6 for it.  If I ever make it again I will adjust the soy and hoisin down to 1/4 cup each and cut the brown sugar to the same.  So dissapointing (and expensive).

great recipe! After reading the reviews I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and doubled the meat. I also cut the hoisin sauce to 1/3 cup or so. It was just the right amount of sauce! We will be making this again!

I didn't think it was awful but it definitely didn't go over well in my household.  The kids wouldnt go near it and it sat in a tupperware dish in my refrigerator until I finally tossed it.  Won't be adding to my recipe book for sure.

The recipe as is did not work for me and I am known as the crock pot queen.  It cooked for 3 hours (without freqent stirring) and the sauce thickened and burned.  The meat also has a strange consistency. I also found that it should have recommended you brown the cornstarch coated meat in a NON-STICK pan.  I was disappointed in this recipe.

This was pretty yummy. The hoisin sauce flavor/smell was strong, I think I'd like to try it again with less of that. But, overall, and easy recipe with good flavor.

We liked this, but found that it was a little salty. Next time I will take the opinion of other viewers and not use so much soy sauce. I did leave out the sugar b/c of our personal taste.

We liked this. I used a sirloin steak and let it cook for about 5 hours. I really think it depends on the hoisin sauce you use in this recipe. Also, I did think it was a bit salty, so I would probably try lite soy sauce next time. For veggies, I would recommend steamed broccoli. All in all, it went over pretty well and was very easy to make.

Excellent!!! I agree with another poster that this is quite sweet. Next time I will most likely cut a wee back on the sugar. I cut in strips and it was done after about 3 hours. Leftovers today for lunch and can't wait to make again! Thanks for the recipe!
