This recipe is on the site in two different places, somehow. I make it frequently since I found this recipe, so I thought I'd rate it in this spot too. It's a fabulous pie, and lime juice is tastier than lemon juice (I've tried both ways). Be warned that you *must* put it in two shells if you are using 8-inch shells; you will not be able to squeeze it in one 8-inch (instead of one 10-inch as per the recipe) no matter how hard you try (and I tried hard!) This is requested for all family occasions now :)

This pie is delicious. I had to use lime juice instead of lemon juice, because that's what I had on hand, and it came out delicious. One note: the recipe as written makes enough filling for 2 small pies, or one over-stuffed one. 5 stars!

Everyone liked this pie.  I made a mistake. I forgot to take the recipe   with me.  I added instant cheesecake pudding to the other ingredients.  It made the pie with more density.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

Delicious and rich.  Very easy and quick to make.  This set up nicely after chilling in refrigerator.  I used 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup walnuts just because I like them.  This makes a full 10-inch pie.

This is very good. Quick & easy. I made it as written except I used a regular 9" pie pan. It makes a generous mound, but not too much for the size pan. Makes a very pretty presentation. I would definately make this again.
