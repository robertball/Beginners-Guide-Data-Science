These were great!  We substituted ground turkey sausage once and just ground turkey as well and both work as a great substitute for beef.  DO NOT USE CORN TORTILLAS.  The fall apart and are very grainy, flour works much better.  

For clarification, do not cook the beans as suggested on the bean package, just wash them that way.  

For a faster way you can substitute pre-cooked can beans.  I would simmer them for 1/2 - 1 hr at minimum.

What is the reason for putting"cooked" beans in a slow cooker??? Soak beans till they start swelling a little and throw water away, then cook them in chicken or beef bouillon, add your favorite herbs.(1 small bay leaf and 1 thick peppercorn, add fried chorizo at the very end.

The recipe was very good and the family really liked it. Nice taste and all the ingredients went well together. The only problem was the time it took. It really was too long and took too much effort for the ending result.

This recipe was amazing!  My family loves tacos, and the addition of these slow-cooked pinto beans made the whole meal change.  Be sure to include all of the extras (sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc.) to get the best flavor.  Yum!

We liked this meal very much.  I added some diced up tomato to the hamburger at the very end of browning it.  I would serve it next time with sour cream and feta cheese (or Mexican cheese).

Very good, but I personally found the beans to be very bland prepared this way. I added some reserved bacon drippings to the slow cooker to liven them up a little. Next time I make it I will use refried beans.

I thought this stuff was pretty blah. It did mark the first time I'd ever cooked dried beans (prepared according to the package directions). I made it exactly as written, using ground sirloin (90% lean) for the ground beef. A little salt and pepper, and the diluted beef bouillon, are still not nearly enough spices to make this a tasty Mexican-style dish. I ate the first few as overstuffed tacos, but it was pretty messy, so I ate the rest with a knife and fork, like a tostada. One complaint is that I found there were way too many beans for 10 of these. I thought I was generous when ladling the beans on, and when it was over I still had two full bowls of a bland "beans in beef broth" soup left over. This recipe has potential, but as written it's only a vague approximation to a great dish. Lastly, I'd always known these as "chalupas", but maybe you're just having fun with the name of this recipe.

Very Bland. I tried to kick it up by adding tomato suace and spices to the ground beef, but still not appealing.

this was a simple yet good recipe. i love ordering tostadas at mexican restaurants and this reminded me of them. i cooked my beans in crockpot all day until tender but wound up just mashing them and adding to the meat mixture so the meat and beans would stick to the tortilla.i heated the tortillas in the oven until they were crisp but not completely dry.

* I STARTED AT 10 AM AND DID FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO BOIL THE BEANS UNTIL THEY WERE SWELLINGWITH 2-4 MORE BEEF BOULION COUBES DUMPER THE WATER AND AGAIN ADDED BEEF BOULION AS DIRECTED. I DIDN’T TRY EATING WITH A CORN TORTILLA. THE NON COOKED ONES JUST DIDN’T APPEAL TO ME. I ATE THEM LIKE CHILI BEANS AND THE JUICE WAS GREAT!

We liked this dish but we found it to be too bland for us. I made it with what I had at home. I used 2 cans of pinto beans.  One was plain and the other can was chili ready spiced beans. I put beef bouillon and 2/3 can of water with the beans in the slow cooker and cooked on low for 3 hours. I Made the meat with added onion and garlic powder and a minced clove of garlic.  I used Mexican taco cheese. I  used wheat tortillas.  I topped it with sour cream. Next time I make this I'll kick up the heat with spices.

I think has potential and is an Americanized version of Chalupas. I added about 1/2 c. of diced canned tomatoes to the beans and a packet of Knorr Home style Beef Stock. 
Chalupas are served on sopes. KristieV doesn't tell how to prepare the corn tortillas. If they are not fried they will turn soggy, gritty and unpalatable when topped with the beans. She also does not say what size ladle.
