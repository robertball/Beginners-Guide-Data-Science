I am impressed! Went looking for a tasty fish dish (in our family we do not consume enough ??). Well, this one sounded good and I made it last night. Oh my...so tasty, moist! I am NOT a big fish fan (especially if it tastes "fishy") so I never thought I would eat the whole fillet (and it was very big; 7-8 inches). I surprised myself and my husband and ate the whole thing!! Yay!! (but I do have one question...what the heck is the teaspoon of butter for?!Nowhere in the directions is the butter mentioned so I omitted that ingredient) Yummy, yummy, yummy!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I'm gonna share with my family and friends!

Made this tonight and it's delicious! I was given this type of fish from my mother and needed a specific recipe. I did not have an onion, so put in some garlic instead, but very delicious and easy to make. I did use a 9x9 dish instead of 9x13 (as I made it for two servings and not 6).

Made it exactly as directed.  Kids and husband loved it.  Cut the recipe in half, and my cook time was reduced to about 20 or 25 minutes (instead of 45 min as the recipe calls for).

This was very good and so quick to make! I just added some fresh cilantro.
