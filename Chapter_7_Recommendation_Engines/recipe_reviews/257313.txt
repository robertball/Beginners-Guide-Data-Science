We liked this. The two of us one Ecuadorian the other from the USA thought the recipe called for a little too much cumin and a bit too much cilantro. So next time will use 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 bunch of cilantro. Also may add a tsp of Aji Peruano seasoning powder for a bit more traditional flavor!
