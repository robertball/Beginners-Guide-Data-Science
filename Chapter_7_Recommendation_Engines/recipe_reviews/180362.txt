Very good! I added a can of diced tomatoes, used frozen corn, and used chicken broth instead of water. Great to be able to make chili without chopping veggies!

Great Chili!  I didn't have the hominy to add for this recipe and it made it really hardy without it.  Great taste and you don't have to have it cook all day for great taste.

This really turned out well. I was not clear on whether the beans, hominy, and corn should be drained. The answer: NO. This makes A LOT and takes quite a while to bring to the first boil. For the chicken I poached 1.4 lbs boneless chicken breasts in chicken broth, let it cool, then used the small julienne disc of my food processor. The only change: I added 1 tbl ground chipotle. I described the recipe during a radio show last night as the hosts enjoyed it. They gave it thumbs up.

I love this one.  I used canned chicken and left out the water and cumin.  I added a little tabasco. Even my kids ate it.

I loved this recipe although I tweaked it and used cannellini and black beans, and also used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup Buffalo Chicken Wing sauce for liquid and used half the spices. Delicious!!

Not too bad, easy to make due to all the canned ingredients though I was hoping for a bit more flavor from it. Followed the recipe to the T but next time will add quite a bit of salt at the very least to give it a bit more kick. Doubling the salsa should help out also. Overall we're going to eat the leftovers and will definitely make it again, if not for the taste, then just due to the cost and ease of prep.

This was so easy to prepare yet no one would ever know it was practically as simple as opening a few cans/jars.  I didn't have any hominy on hand so I used one can of whole kernel corn and one can of corn with chipotle (Green Giant) and salsa with white corn & black beans (Great Value brand from Walmart).  I also used the already grilled, frozen chicken strips (Foster Farms).  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water.  My family loved it so I will be making it time & time again.

I have this simmering on the stove right now. I was looking for a recipe to use chicken and salsa and  this recipe came up.
I made some substitutions to use what I had on hand. I didn't have hominy or kidney beans or the canned corn.
So I used a can of creamed corn, a can of pinto beans and can of black eyed peas and to I replaced the hominy with a can of fat free, spicy refried beans. The refrieds really seems to make it thick and hearty. I used a can of chicken broth instead of water.
I cooked the chicken half way in my convection toaster oven. Then I dumped all the ingredients in the pot added the chicken and am simmering it until the chicken is completely cooked. I tasted it just now and its SUPERB! I didn't add any of the spices. I figured between the salsa (mine is of the mild variety) and the spicy refried beans it didn't need any more spices.
I was looking for a recipe to use up some things I've had for awhile and wanted to get rid of. I also took a pouch of pizza crust mix and shaped it into bread stix and baked them to serve with the Chili. Yummy! Been taste testing this a little too much, lol.
My husband going to go crazy over this. Will be making this again and maybe experiment with different ingredients.

Very hearty and easy meal for a Winter's night! I used double the hominy instead of corn, and chicken broth instead of water.  Perfect!

I can't get Hominy or Pinto Beans in S Korea, so I didn't use them. In place of the Pinto Beans, I used Black Beans. Oh and don't drain the beans! You need that liquid for the chilli.   I boiled the Chicken in veggie broth (via bouillon cube) with some cumin and garlic powder spinkled on top of the chicken. After it was cooked, I pulled the chicken apart with a knife.   I added Garlic Powder (about 1 tsp)and chopped onions (about 1/2 large onion) to the chilli.   I served with colby jack cheese and fresh chopped onions on the bottom of the bowl so the cheese will melt when the chilli is put on top. Also, followed the suggestion to put some sour cream on top, which made it more delicious. Wonderful dinner for me and my husband.

very good! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beans and corn before I put them in...I did end up draining them, which was probably a mistake as there wasn't a lot of liquid.  But I just added some chicken broth left over from boiling my chicken and it worked just fine.  I'm going to make this again for sure--but probably not include the hominy- I think that's an acquired taste that I haven't yet acquired :) Husband loved it though!

I started making the recipe before reading the reviews. I always turn to a chili of some sort when I have meat that needs to be cooked before it goes bad. So, while the meat was cooking (beef) I was excited to see someone had also substituted for chicken. I was also disappointed to see that I should not have drained the beans! Meat is still only browning so I will just add more broth, which is also always a great replacement for water!!

This recipe is delicious! I changed it a little bit. Instead of corn I added half a chopped onion.  Also, I add one can of chili beans substituted for one can of pinto beans. This is a great recipe and so easy to make!

left out the cumin just because I didn't have any and used two cans of shredded chicken.  I didn't drain any of my items and so I decided to not add the water, as there was plenty of liquid.  Only used 6 ounces of salsa and used yellow hominey because its what I had on hand.  Very good and very easy to make.  And only has 5 pts plus values per cup, for those doing weight watchers!  This will definitely be a keeper!

Very good!!!
So quick and easy, Kids loved it!
Didn't have hominy and I didn't drain liquids as I read from other reviews. Also only put 1 tablespoon each of spices, in case to spicy for the kids. I figured I could add after if I needed.

Definately a keeper and I personally like things spicey so I added chipotle and cumin, omitted the hominey and as suggested, used broth in place of water! I used store bought lemon peppered rotisserie chicken and served with lime wedges, cilantro and sour cream....Perfect hit at office party!

Pretty good but nothing over the top. I made it in tne slow cooker instead of on the stove top. I used half a bag of frozen corn, and only one can of red kidney beans and one can of pinto and great northern beans mixed thogether. I used a can of diced tomatoes undrained instead of the salsa. I put two frozen chicken breast in and pushed them down in the liquid, cooked on high for about 6 hours, took the chicken out and shredded it.  Topped this with onion and shredded cheese. Great cheap and easy meal. Thank you!

We don't care for the spicy stuff, so I only added 1 T of Chili powder.  Others can add more at the table.  It's really good.

The taste of the chili was okay. It definitely needed to be thicker! If I make it again, I'm going to add a thickening agent.

Because we don't care for hominy, I left it out. I just added an additional can of corn. I did use chicken broth instead of water and added in a few more spices (mexican oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, little brown sugar, worchestershire sauce, dash hot sauce). This was okay--not bad for a quick dinner. I'm glad I added more seasoning. NOTE: I did throw all the ingredients into a crockpot, it works well cooked that way.

I made this, but boiled my chicked until it was almost done and added Knorr Fiesta Sides Taco Rice to it. I cooked it until the water was cooked out and then added it to my chili. This is one of my new favorite meals!!

This was pretty good! I only used 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of kidney beans and there was still plenty of leftovers for my husband and I.

I made this chili this afternoon...excellent! I would add just a bit more water, but it had just enough spice that even my daughter liked it!

Amazing! I used the advice of several reviews to make my rendition of this chili recipe: next time will drain the liquid from all but 2 cans of beans, as this time I needed to remove 4 cups before serving.  Used 1 cup chicken stock, 1 can yellow hominy, 3 cans navy beans, 1 can black eyed peas. Increased the ground cumin to 3Tbsp. Cooked B/S chicken breasts in crock until done then removed before serving, shredded in the food processor and added back to chili.  Served with rice and cornbread.

Good, but not amazing.  I only had one can of kidney beans, so I subbed in a can of black beans, which was a good move.  I made in the crockpot, so I could just fix in morning and have dinner all taken care of.  In the crockpot I always like the simplicity of using frozen chicken breast straight from the freezer for they always get cooked in the right amount of time, which is what I did this time.  I shredded just before serving.  I drained the corn and hominy, but didn't drain any of the beans.  I did not add any additional water solely because was doing in the crockpot.  It was a little bland as is, so added about 3/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon Chipotle chili powder.  Topping with sour cream was great.

I love this dish! It's very easy and fairly quick! I used white beans instead of kidney beans, chicken broth instead of water and used Pace Picante Medium salsa. So my chili ended up a little bit spicy, but not too much! I'll definitely make this again!

Simple and great chili!! My husband added a touch more chili powder for more kick (too much for children though). We loved it and had it ready in no time. Great meal for those nights when there isn't a lot of time for dinner.

I don't think it is fair to make a bunch of changes to a recipe and then give it a bad review, which I have seen on here.  I did make some changes, but I disregarded them when considering the review.   Made this in the slow cooker.  Since I don't like hominy, I didn't have any, but used suggestion of another reviewer and added fat-free refried beans.  Used black beans, homemade chicken broth instead of water, and Tostitos Restaurant Style Salsa.  I did rinse and drain the canned vegetables to reduce the sodium, and used additional broth.  After it was almost done, I tasted and added additional cumin, a little pepper, some garlic, and some salt.  Served with Golden Flake Maizetos Tortilla chips and grated cheese.  My husband had sour cream on his, and we both loved it.  Would like to have given this 4.5 stars.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made this for our family chili night gathering of 16 people. Everybody liked it, and it was great to have a good alternative for those who try to avoid beef.

This was pretty good except it made way too much.  Next time I will cut it in half.  From reading other reviews I also made a few changes because it seemed there was no flavor to speak of.  I added minced garlic, chopped onions, red and yellow peppers.  Also, one hot pepper, minced and I substituted the water for chicken broth.  I also tossed in a little cilantro near the end of cooking.  It was delicious.  But again, next time I will cut the recipe in half because we had enough for twenty people!

For Keto purposes, I only addd 2 cans of no sodium beans(white & pinto). I added salsa verde and then 4 ounces of sour cream to balance out the heat and make it creamier. Topped with cilantro, diced avocados and shredded cheese. It was money!!  I’ll make this a 100 more times. So quick and so full of flavor!

I cooked two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breast in the slow cooker with just enough water to cover the chicken, a teaspoon of garlic powder, cumin and chili powder, two tablespoons of a store bought lime vinaigrette, though lime juice would have been great, and a splash of tequila. I cooked it on high for a little over two hours and shred out with a fork and knife really. 
In the chili itself I didn't have hominy so I doubled the corn (frozen), and used white chili and pinto beans, also adding one can of "chili-ready" diced tomatoes, I didn't drain any of the cans so I didn't have to add water. I used a jar of garlic tomatillo salsa as well. This recipe was completely delicious and other than slow cooking and shredding the chicken, it only took about fifteen minutes and yielded about eight servings. Overall, cost about $16 to make, not including spices, and my kids (3 and 6) loved it. I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good! Made a few Improvisions I used 1 can cannaneli beans and 1 can dark red kidney beans drained, 1 can whole corn drained, 1 can diced tomatoes in sauce,  whole can chicken broth, pace medium salsa, diced chicken, and of course the seasonings required  on the original recipe left out everything else. Makes a lot but that's ok we loved it so don't mind eating leftovers

I cooked chicken breasts in a crockpot overnight and in the morning added the remaining ingredients letting it cook on high until heated through.  The only change  I made was to cut the spices down to 1 tablespoon each.   This chili tastes great.  Day 2 warmed in the microwave at work it retained its good favor.  I've made it several times with the same results.  It's a keeper!

I and my family lived it, I left out the kidney beans though personal preference, but I used both black and pinto beans, and I used Serrano peppers, I like some kick to Chili, I enjoyed it a lot though and altered it for duck and goose and it was very good then too, thank you, and Shalom.

I usually make this after I make stock.  I use the meat to put in the "chili".  I use chicken stock instead of water, that is the only change I make to this recipe.  It's a good "stick to your ribs" dish and makes plenty of left overs for future lunch/meals.  I have also done it sucessfully in the crock pot on low for a few hours when I have the time.

Really good.  I thought it sounded gross because of all the canned good, but interesting so i decided to give it a try.  I dreaded coming home from work with the thought I was going to have to cook something else for dinner.  I was very surprised how tasty this was. I put everything in the crock pot on low for the day.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was really tasty.  It was also very easy to make with very little clean up. I used shredded rotisserie chicken and did NOT drain liquid from the cans.  We served it with shredded cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream. I have two small children who love to help cook and this was a good recipe for them because they got to empty a lot of cans and stir (their favorite things).

Bland.  It needs more spice.  Perhaps some sliced roasted jalapenos and garlic.  Oh - and a little bit of salt would be a big boost.
