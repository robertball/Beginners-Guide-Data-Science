This was very simple yet very good! I added about a teaspoon of garlic salt when I added the Parmesan to the peas and pasta. I also added about half a stick of butter to the hot pot after dumping the peas and pasta in a colander. Would be great with tuna or bits of leftover ham. I'll try that next time.

Think scrambled eggs with peas, pasta, and Parmesan cheese.  It tasted good and I'd have it again, but it was bland.  If you season it like breakfast eggs, then that should help.  You like salty eggs, add salt; garlic or hot sauce, add that.

I added some garlic and salt along with the pepper to the eggs.  This was delicious and easy to prepare.  My husband was a little leery of it at first but ended up loving it.

This was fast, easy, and good. The trifecta. I could definitely see adding some chicken though, to give just a little more flavor. Also, I added in some extra frozen veggies I had.

Good & easy dish to make.  My grandson (5 yr. old) enjoyed it also.  I did add freshly grated garlic because the original recipe didn't seem like it would have much flavor.

It was good, but bland. So I ended up adding hot sauce for more flavor. After that it was very good.

Beyond my expectations good! I saut√©ed some onion and garlic on the side then added to pasta and peas mixture. I then added the eggs and stirred until they were cooked. Going to be making this again!

Okay, so I didn't cook this recipe in its entirety...but I used it as a starting point. I was cooking for a vegetarian friend and for my boyfriend who is very much NOT vegetarian, so I had to make it a happy medium. I kept the recipe in its entirety [except I used elbow macaroni instead of shells], and added a small can of sliced carrots, extra eggs beaten in, and a tad of vegetable broth and garlic salt. I cooked it in the saucepan for the guided amount of time, then threw more cheese on top and baked it for about 10 extra minutes. Apparently it went over extremely well, because the entire house of roommates and friends ate it until it was gone!

I added some garlic salt (as I do with my regular scrambled eggs) but while I followed the directions to a T, I found it so dry.  I have so much leftover and frankly, I wish I had made it with onions and chicken broth, something so it wasn't so dry?  It's good, but definitely add some broth, or sauce of your liking to it as it is quite dry.

This is bland, unless you add something to it.  I add garlic powder to it, and that helped a lot.   With that garlic it reminds me of alfredo.  We make it every so often for supper.  I like cheap, easy, and quick so for that I give it 5 stars.

Good, mostly because when I am out of food I usually still have these things in my pantry! It is good but you will need lots of salt and pepper.  I also added some garlic powder and extra cheese of course.  I didnt have as many eggs as called for but still good. Hot sauce lovers could certainly add that too.

Great recipe but I added a few things and make it a little differently. Slice some shallots or onions real thin and add them last. Add some butter and olive oil instead of the eggs and you have a real Sicilian dish, delicious.
