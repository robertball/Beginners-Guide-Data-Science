Hubs and I both agree that if you love bread with lots of gooey cheese on it you will more than likely love this. We thought it was all right, but more than likely won't make it again BECAUSE it was bread with lots of gooey cheese and mayo on it.  (I did use mayonnaise rather than "creamy salad dressing," i.e., Miracle Whip)  Both the black olives and the touch of chili powder were interesting and quite nice additions as was the green onion I used rather than regular onion.  Even tho' I used small baguettes rarher than a whole loaf of French bread, 10 minutes wasn't quite long enough to get the cheese all melty - I unfortunately found I had to nuke it.  Interesting to try, but when it comes right down to it, this was just a little too rich for our tastes.

Made it this weekend to go with my Walleye and it was wonderful!  Next time will add some black olives as well.  I did not cover in foil, but broiled briefly.  Awesome!

Made this bread my family and I thought it was yummy. Did not change a thing, when making something for the first time I try to stick to the recipe. I cannot understand some of the reviewers who change most of the ingrediients then rate it.

This was good! I used slices of leftover homemade 'Sriracha Cheese Bread' form this site, and it was great for this. Since I was doing this open-faced, I just broiled the bread until it was hot and bubbling. I used reg. mayo and red onion. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
