This dish is okay.  Put sour cream on anything and it's going to be pretty good.  I did substitute carrot for celery because that's what I had on hand.

Wow, what a refreshing change from plain old black eyed peas for New Years ... and they don't have to cook for hours and hours!  I can't wait for everyone to try this tomorrow.  It's delicious.  I only omitted the celery because we don't care for it and it was still perfect!  Thanks!

I needed to use a few cans of Black Eyed Peas..found your recipe.  It was a hit with my family.  The only things I changed was more onion we like onion, and I used Trader Joes Cilantro dressing instead of dried cilantro.

this was very easy and delish, used cilantro paste insted of dried.  Even my husband said it was good and he usually says nothing.

We really enjoyed this!  The only changes I made were to use garlic instead of onion and to omit the cilantro.
