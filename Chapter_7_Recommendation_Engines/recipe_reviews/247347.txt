I added a little basting oil (that has basil in oil) to the pesto tortellini tomato mix before putting on picks I also used sliced pepperoni and everyone enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe! I used short bamboo skewers, and added pepperoni and mozzarella cheese to these, plus a little truffle oil! Easy to make, look good, and very tasty!

Super easy and quick, but next time I would use boxed tortellini instead of fresh. The fresh ones tended to slide off the toothpicks.

I did not use tomatoes as this was for a kidâ€™s spots banquet. Instead I put tortellini, a piece of folded pepperoni and a rectangle of. Mozzarella all on one toothpick. It was a perfect mouthful. Everyone loved them!

Yummy!! Rave reviews when I brought to a wedding. I did add local reindeer salami sausage to the skewers but would have been just as good without. I thought it needed more protein.

These were really good. Our guests loved them. Might add some olives next time.
