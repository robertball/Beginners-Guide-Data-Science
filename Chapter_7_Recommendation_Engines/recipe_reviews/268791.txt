This was excellent! I’m a huge maple syrup fan anyways, but with the jalapeño heat the sweetness of the syrup just complimented the salmon. I used jar peppers and marinated probably more than recommend, but followed the rest of the recipe exact and it was so good. We eat salmon a few times a month so this will be in the rotation. I served with cilantro lime rice and a bean medley. Thank you for the recipe!
