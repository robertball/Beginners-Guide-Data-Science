I make this recipe but I add a jar of pepperoncinis to the pot with about half of their liquid.  Top sandwiches with mozzarella or provolone.  One of my family's favorites.

Meat is getting very expensive.  Save the rump for a special dinner.  I use a chuck roast, cans of beef broth or ajus & fresh garlic to taste & 2 or 3 Bay leaves.  Also add a jar of pepperocini [I trim the stems] with juice.  Sometimes I add thick slices of onion.  If I have time I brown the roast before I put it in the crock pot.  Pour a can of broth in the pan & scrape bottom to pick up the extra bits of flavor from the browning & add it to the crock pot.

Au jus is missing..... that may help......I heard Al from Als beef say he cooks his pot roast a day in advance and store it at 35 degrees over night. The next day he slices and reheats....he even makes his own peppers(carrots crushed peepers celery) just a suggestion for a REAL BEEF

This was not quite the proper Chicago Italian beef we were hoping for (I honestly couldn't tell you what it's missing, though), but it was certainly good in its own right and curbed our family's craving for the much-missed Johnny's on Chestnut and State. I recommend slicing up the meat when it still has an hour or two to go and returning it to the broth.

Meraviglioso !
Been dying to try homemade Italian Beef. Found 2 beef bottom round roasts total wt 4.96 lb.  Tried changes already suggested. Substituted a 1 qt box of low sodium beef broth for the 3 C water. Browned meat in skillet  with olive oil about 30 sec on each surface before putting into slow-cooker. Added 16  ounce jar Mezzetta brand Deli-Sliced Golden Greek Peperoncini (drained).  10 hours on Low. Shredded in a 9x13 cake pan to minimize mess. Back into slow-cooker for 2 hr  on the keep-warm setting. Bake-at-Home Baguette and Provolone cheese.  MMMM...delicious !

This was great. Used a chuck roast and added a jar of sliced Greek peperoncini's per other reviews. Made for my husband's deer hunting week with a bunch of guys and they ate it up.
