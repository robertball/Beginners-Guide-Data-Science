The only reason why I am knocking off a star is that I think you should make the recipe int0 SIX bread bowls, not 8... the size you get making six seems perfect. I also did olive oil instead of veg., and I added 1 tbsp. of sugar. I used entirely bread flour, not all purpose. I took the advice of another reviewer and let it rise with a steaming pot in the oven-- worked great! We ate this with "Super Sloppy Joes" (search for it) in the middle with cheddar cheese on top. Deliciously filling. One thing to remember though-- making six bowls means they need a little extra time in the oven, maybe 5 minutes or they are a tad doughy.

These were very good but a bit time consuming.  They baked up nice and crispy on the outside, just a tad doughy on the inside still.  Next time, I will bake 2 or 3 mins. longer.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose, perhaps that had something to do with it.  I cut back on the salt to 1-1/2 tsp., next time I will add the whole amount.  As per others' recommendations, I used olive oil and added a Tbsp. of sugar.  I made 6 bowls, which were a good size, but very filling.  (A secret I learned from Alton Brown from the Food Channel - place the dough in an oiled bowl or tall container.  Cover with a cloth.  Boil water and pour into a bowl.  Place both in the oven.  The steam creates the perfect temperature for rising the dough.   Works great every time!)

For those who find these TOO simple in taste, add 2 tblsp Garlic Powder to the recipe and when putting egg wash on, sprinkle garlic and oregano over both times. This helps the flavor of the bread tremedously!

I only made four bowls cuz we wanted hearty servings of stew -- they turned out perfect, & I don't understand the reviewers who wrote about moulding the bowls around other bowls to form an actual hollow bowl.  Bread bowls are just big ole round loaves of bread that you scoop out to make a bowl you can eat & dip with as you eat the stew or soup in it.  Anyway, to each his own, but I wanted to say that bit in case anyone thinks they can't just accomplish a good ole bread bowl by plopping four round blobs of dough in the oven.  Worked great for us, & my husband raved more over this meal than he has over most any other one!  I made the Beef Stew VI from this site to eat in the bowls.

Had difficulty with actually getting good bowl shapes as recommended.  Came up with a solution that worked great for me.  Follow recipe as given, but use an inverted oven safe cereal bowl as a form, spray with Pam, and simply take an appropriate size cut of dough and wrap it around the bowl.  Be sure its not overly thick unless you really like thick bread. Bake for 12-15 min.and you have a perfect bowl every time.

I've been using this recipe for quite some time and it is fantastic!  I usually make 6 bowls and I've never had them flatten out.  I think the cornmeal helps to keep them from spreading.  Adding a little sugar to feed the yeast also helps, and I always store my yeast in the freezer so it stays fresh longer (it also improves the proofing).  Thanks for a great recipe.

These bread bowls worked out great for our broccoli and cheese soup. I had them rise and bake in small oven safe stoneware bowls which worked out perfectly for individual servings. For those of you who are having problems with your bread rising you may want to try a few things first.  #1 Make sure you have a good active yeast, not an old one. (Note; 2 1/4 tsp of yeast = 1 yeast packet.)  #2 You may want to add a tsp or Tbs (depending on preference)of sugar to the yeast/water mix to help activate the yeast faster. You shouldn't notice much of a taste difference with only a tsp.  #3 If your dough is remaining flat, try the stoneware,oven safe bowl or foil method. It helps shape the loaf up for more filling space, rather than out.  #4 If you are personally finding the bread on the bland side, try adding some of your favorite herbs and spices to the flour mixture. Try 1 Tbs of Italian seasoning for a more robust bread. Maybe add some grated cheese to the dough. If you are having a clam chowder, try adding a Tbs of dill to perk up the flavor. Sprinkle a bit of garlic salt or powder on the tops of the loaves after the egg wash for a bit of a zing. The wonderful thing about bread dough is it can be so versitile to suit your own personal tastes. Jump in and experiment. Just remember, a little bit goes a long way when it comes to herbs and spices.  I just wanted to state that I am not adding these tips to take away from the original recipe.

Excellent bread bowls!!! I made half the recipe for me & hubby.  I added a bit of sugar to proof the yeast.  Maybe it is so dry here (-40 outside!) that I only needed 2.25 cups flour instead of 3.5 cups to make a nice dough in the kitchenaid.  After reading the reviews on about the "flatness" of the bowls, I shaped them into 4 round rolls instead.  They rose perfectly and flattened out a little bit.  I skipped the first egg wash and they came out gorgeous!  Beautiful golden, shiny on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Served them with chicken stew/chicken pot pie filling.

This recipe rocks!  It was awesome with a thick split pea soup- really makes soup special- not a lot of work for the raves, but does require advanced planning.  A TIP:  For the second raise period, split up into individual bowls on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper.  DO NOT reknead the bowls- avoid handling them directly before baking so they will stay raised.  Delish! Thanks Kerri!

This is a really great recipe! Thanks Kerri!
Mine also flattened out the first time I made them. This time I omitted the first egg wash. They turned out beautiful and round! Thanks again.

Great bowls!  The whole family loved it.  I used my bread machine, then inverted the dough over oven safe bowls and cooked it that way, using only water instead of the egg white/water mixture.  Will definitely be making these again.  Easy and delicious!

Cut the recipe in half for two people, and then made two big bread bowls. Baked them at 400 for 15 minutes then 350 for 10 minutes, and they were perfect. I did add 1/2 tablespoon of garlic and 1/2 tablespoon of oregano to the dough, and it punched up the flavor quite a bit.

These are exactly what I was looking for, a plain bread bowl like you can get at a restaurant.  I love bread bowls, have a fairly healthy appetite (even though I'm small) and the size of these bowls was more than enough for one serving for me.  Next time, i plan on making 10 instead of 8.  When shaped into 8, each bowl could hold about 1 cup of soup, so just use that as your basis whether or not you want 6 or 8 out of this recipe.  I proofed the yeast with a T of sugar and used olive oil insetad of veg oil.  These did take a lot longer to rise on the first rise, more like 1 1/2 hrs.  If you have trouble with flat bowls, you may have let your balls rise too much in the second rise. If they start browning too quickly in the oven, you can either spritz them with water every 5 min or so, or you can cover them with foil like I did.  I thought these were the perfect size, adjustable by scooping out more or less breading. I had leftovers and just reheated them at 350 for 10 min before serving.  I will make again--much cheaper than buying!

To be fair, the 2 star rating is probably more a reflection of my ability than the recipe itself.  It's my first time making bread, really.  My "bread bowls" turned out to be hard, very dense...rolls.  They didn't rise one bit, and I followed the directions as written (except for letting them sit for much longer, hoping they would start to rise).  I baked until the outside was golden brown, but the inside didn't seem fully cooked--and very tough and doughy. I'm pretty sure my error came in with the mixing and/or kneading of the dough because it was very dense from the beginning, as I was adding the flour by 1/2 cup to the bowl.  Maybe I added too much flour and/or overmixed.  And I just read another review that said I shouldn't use a hand mixer?  News to me, I thought that's what the recipe was talking about.  I used mine, along with the dough hooks that came with it.  So, I"ll try this again...someday...once I get my morale back.  :)  This was a little time consuming.

This was my first time making bread bowls and these turned out gorgeously. I made 5 bowls out of this which came out perfectly sized and to the egg white wash i added basil and oregano to give it that italian kick. Great Recipe will use again and recommend.

These were so easy and yummy.  They remind me of French bread.  Don't place too many on each baking sheet or they will grow together! (Finished size is about 5" wide.)  A serrated grapefruit spoon worked great to scoop them out.

Very Delicious but next time I will only make 4 bowls instead of eight or double it for eight bowls. The bowls were too small for my family. Also I sprinkled italian seasoning on top before baking and they were delicious!!!!! And the Cheesiest Potato Soup was perfect for it.

Absolutely delicious!  Mine were crisp on the outside and perfectly fluffly inside.  We dipped into our soup the bread that scooped out from the middle.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Next time will follow others' suggestions and will make 6 instead of 8.

I made this into two large bread bowls for dips I planned to fill them with.  I did sub a cup of whole wheat for the white, and added 1 tablespoon of wheat gluten to ensure the dough rises well.  I sprayed oil and sprinkled cornmeal into two 8" round pans, and then let the two large dough balls do their final rise in these to prevent them from spreading too much and flattening out.  Skipped the first egg wash.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Turned out very nice; the round loaves were each 4" high.

Beautiful recipe...I mixed exactly to the orginal and they did not flatten out at all; they were just yummy bowls of goodness!  I did add a teaspoon of sugar to proof the yeast, but aside from that...I wouldn't change a thing.  Very delish with homemade chili!

Great recipe, although I did have to make a few changes! Like other reviewers, I added sugar to proof the yeast, about 1 tsp. I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 4 cups of bread flour instead of the 7 cups of all purpose flour. Also the rise time of 40 mins for the first rise just is not enough, you need at least an hour! I let mine rise in a warm oven covered with a damp cloth and a bowl of hot water on the rack below, the steam helped it rise! For the second rise it also needed a bit longer, 45-50 mins instead of 35. Once you have shaped them and place them on the baking tray for the 2nd rise it is important not to move them as this affects the shape! Like other reviewers I did not put the egg wash on before baking, I baked at 400 f for 10mins then brushed, baked for another 10mins brushed again and then baked at 350 f for the last 10 mins. In my egg wash I added garlic salt and italian seasoning it gave it a great flavor! Although these did not taste as great the second day, if you freeze them the same day you bake them and defrost them at room temp, warm in the oven for 5 mins they were delicious!

As a bowl, this worked great. And it came out looking just beautiful. The taste, however, left something to be desired. I even followed a few reviewers' advice by adding 1 Tbsp sugar with the yeast, using olive oil instead of vegetable, and sprinkling herbs onto the last egg wash. But this bread needs a lot more. Probably double the salt, definitely some garlic powder, and maybe something else. The bread itself was just very boring which was a shame since it looked so beautiful and everyone was impressed by soup in bread bowls. Will try again adding more salt and garlic powder.

These were very simple to bake and baked nicely.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of baking in oven safe bowls to retain their shape.  I also added Italian Seasoning, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper to the dough and I'm glad I did.  While I like the texture, I think these would have been incredibly bland w/out the added flavors.  This made 8 SMALL bowls for me; if I make them again I will make 4-6 larger bowls instead.

These turned out wonderful! I mixed the dough in my bread machine on the dough setting and then put the dough in small disposable pie tins for the second rise. This kept them in a nice bowl shape.

super yummy! I used this recipe for the Chunky Potato soup recipe and it turned out perfect!  I added about 1 tbs of dried basil and 4 roughly cut cloves of garlic to jazz it up a bit just because we love garlic!  This recipe was very easy and turned out very well.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly except that like other reviewers I made 6 bowls instead of 8.  I didn't need to increase baking time. They were perfect after 30 min (I have an oven thermometer, so the temp of my oven was accurate).  I also skipped the first egg wash per another reviewer to prevent them from flattening and they turned out great. Easy to make and delicious!

These turned out wonderful! My husband and kids were skeptical at first but now they are begging me to make these again! I served Cream of broccoli & cheese soup in these and the bread is such an amazing compliment to the soup! I am trying them tonight with beef stew!These were very easy to make and I'm not sure about the previous comments about "molding the dough to bowl shape" but they turned out great as traditional bread bowls for me!!!

I halved this recipe so I'd get 4 bread bowls, and it halves exceedingly well.  these bread bowls are extremely easy and simple.  Not sure why people are having a hard time with this recipe--just make into very round rolls and it will bake up in large bread bowls.  So large, actually, that I wasn't able to finish mine.  We had these with Chicken and Corn Chili and they were excellent.  yes, they are bland but they are bread bowls--meant to be eaten with soup, so you want a bland bread to soak up the flavor of the soup you choose.  If you still want a flavorful bread bowl, add garlic adn other seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe!

I won't make this one again. I am a baking novice and I know that making bread can be difficult so I followed this one to the "T" I learned a couple of things. First you can't mix dough with a hand mixer.  I also learned that you have to let bread rise longer than this recipe calls for. I didn't get bread bowls. I got rolls.

Fall weather has arrived in Cleveland, and these bread bowls are perfect for a hearty soup or chili.  I placed the ingredients in my bread machine to make the dough, then baked in the oven.  The bread bowls were crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, exactly what I was hoping for.  The only change I made was to add onion powder to the top before baking, and I think I'll add some to the dough next time as well for extra flavor.  And I made the bowls smaller than called for as the ham and potato soup I served with them was very hearty.

This was my first time baking bread with yeast and it turned out much better than expected!  I served them with cream of crab soup and it worked very well.  I only made 4 bowls and they were a little too big, I would make more next time.

Added some garlic powder to give them some flavor.  They turned out great but were a *little* flat and here's why.  After you let them raise for the 2nd time-- DO NOT TOUCH THEM!  Touching or moving them after the rise makes them flatten.  I had to move mine apart because I initially placed them too close together and they got stuck together as they rose.  When I moved them, they flattened a little.  I tried covering them to let them rise again and it didn't work.  So-- my advice... when you place them to rise on your baking sheet, make sure that they are spaced well so that you don't have to touch them before baking!  I found it tough to do this (give them the space they needed) and still have room for all 8 to fit in one oven.  I placed 2 per baking sheet and only had three racks in my oven.  So next time I will only make 6.  Even though they flattened a bit, they still came out great and were able to be shaped into bowls.  Worth the effort but I definitely won't be making them often! (very time consuming)

This was my first attempt at bread bowls and I loved them!  I will be making these again for sure.  I think I may add some seasoning to the actual bread next time.  Just to experiment.

These are amazing!  I took some advice and divided the recipe because it was only myself and my husband for dinner - halved perfectly.  I added a 1/4 tsp of sugar as well.  Delicious, will definitely make again and again!

EXCELLENT!  This recipe works perfectly.  No changes are needed but I made 6 bowls instead of 8 because I wanted them bigger.  The texture of the crust was GREAT and their appearance was IMPRESSIVE.  My guests went home with a copy of the recipe which says it all!   Thank you Kerri Skrudland for an EXCELLENT recipe!

I don't know why anyone has had problems with these flattening out?  Mine are huge and I scaled to 6 bowls.  When putting the eggwash on, make sure you use a silicone brush.  These are much softer and easier to use than bristled brush.  I eggwash before and halfway through.  I have made these 5 times and never have had a problem.  Flavor is great and rise is even better.  I am an expert bread maker and never buy store bought bread.  Maybe other factors cause the failures of other bread makers.

All I can say is... WOW!!  I was looking for a nice bread bowl recipe for the simple fact that I love bread bowls with dip.  I found this recipe and tried it one night... my friends and I just sat around eating until they were almost all gone!  I actually made 4 larger bowls instead because I like them bigger, and it worked out great.  I made these the day after I first made them, too.  It's delicious with the "Best Spinach Dip Ever" recipe here.  I'm picky about the bread that I eat, and this bread was perfect... I plan on making this recipe again tomorrow!

I too added just a pinch of sugar. I also added in a bunch of herbs because they're serving my chicken noodle soup. 

Using 3 c. whole wheat flour and 4 c. AP flour, the rise was incredible! I thought it was going to spill over my kitchenaid bowl. I split into 5 rounds, although 6 would have worked just as well. 

This is a winner!

They turned out perfect. I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to proof the yeast faster and used bread flour. I ended up only using about 5.5 cups of flour.

These were not ideal for bread bowls. I changed nothing in the directions but still ended up with sorta flat bowls. Also the recipe states it makes 4 but really it makes only 3 mid sized bowls, which held about 1 1/2 cups stew. Thanks for the idea but I doubt I will be making again.

These were ok, but I don't think I would make them again.  Just not the good rustic bread taste I was hoping for.  They're alright for a basic bread bowl, but I'll keep searching for the right one for me.

This recipe is perfect as-is, thanks!!!  Why are some users wrapping this dough AROUND a bowl?  I think they must be  attempting to shape the dough into a bowl before it bakes, instead of a big round loaf that is to be  scooped out and made into a bowl -- LOL!

Some things I learned.  If you have problems with the bread getting too flat, just let it rise in oven-proof bowls to get the right shape.  You can hollow the bread with a grapefruit spoon, and instead of removing a lot of the inside just take a spoon and press bread into the sides of the bowl to make the bowl sturdier to hold soup.  Proof your yeast with 1 Tbs of sugar, and if you think white bread is bland, just add a packet of dry ranch dressing.  The bread bowls soak up the soup flavor, so I find that I don't need the ranch.  However, the bread is too dense for my taste.  I'll keep looking for the right bread bowl recipe for me...thanks!

Well, I must be doing it wrong. Flavor was excellent, but my second rise would not get much higher. I did the pan of boiling water in the oven method, but after an hour they weren't going to get any bigger. I baked them up anyway, they look and taste fine. I will try the recipe again and see if I have any better luck (I'm still not always good with yeast!). UPDATE: Yep, I tried the recipe again, followed it exactly, got exactly the same thing. Little round pita breads :(

I halved the recipe but used 3 3/4 t of yeast.  I also used 2c of whole wheat flour and added in 1 1/2 c of bread flour during the mixing process.  I opted for simple and let the bread machine do the kneading.  I let them rise in the oven in bowls.  Like another reviewer suggested, I put a large pyrex cup of boiling water in the oven while rising which worked great.  Don't remove them from the bowls or they'll crash like mine did (duh!) The egg wash is critical to get the crunchy top.  Thanks for a great base recipe.  I would recommend spices be added if you are not doing the whole wheat as the bread really needs some sort of flavor.

Wonderful.  This was my first attempt at bread.  I usually make cakes.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy to follow.  I did add sugar to the yeast, used bread flour instead of all purpose, and olive oil as per other reviewer suggestions.  I did the Alton Brown method for rising dough and it worked perfectly.  I didn't have a problem with the bread flattening out.  I did egg wash as directed and they came out beautiful.  Served with Chicken Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Family loved it.

Made these to go along with broccoli and cheese soup.  Yummy!

I would suggest making this recipe into 4 or 6 servings.  The bowls don't seem to turn out very big if you use them for 8.

This was excellent.  But there is a typo on the recipe ingredient list.  It should list 1 tbl water rather than 1 cup.

What a great recipe for a first-timer bread bowl maker! :)  I followed the advice of a couple of other reviewers, and added italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Also, I think making 8 bowls would have made so dang small bowls, and as we were using this as our main dish, we made the dough into four bowls.  This meant an additional 15 minutes or so of bake time.  Tasted great, the hubby loved it, will definately make this a repeat recipe!

I frequently bake yeast breads.  When this one did not seem to rise, I stuck it in the oven counting on eating my soup in a regular bowl and using the bread to dip.  When I checked on it 15 minutes later, I was very suprised, but very happy, to see a tall, bowl-worthy bread!  A great recipe!

The bread had a good taste..my family loved them I filled them with homemade mushroom/potato soup. My bowls did not "bowl" they were flat so i will try another method to get them to 'bowl"... My family did not care...I split the leftover bowls and toasted with butter added jam and the kids loved it the next day!!

I made these to put the Brown Jug Soup into and it was really good.  My only problem was that my bowls didn't quite bowl up.  Next time I try this I will surround them with aluminun foil to try to get some height on them.  But really good.

These turned out gorgeous and everybody raving. I added a little garlic powder and oregano to mine and only made 6. Very dense inside, delicious straight out of the oven and the next day too.

I absolutely love this basic recipe & use it all the time!  I have made a few changes: I cut the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, add 1 TBS of sugar and every now and then with a pasta dinner I will toss in 1/8Cup parsley flakes & replace the salt with garlic salt, adding 1/2 tsp of Garlic powder & about 3 shakes of grated parm.  This recipe makes fantastic, restaurant style mini-table loaves, bread bowls & all sorts of dinner rolls.  Fantastic recipe! I use my bread machines dough setting - adding all liquid, then all dry, then the yeast & I simply shape and bake.

2012.01.19   I halved the recipe and used a whole egg to glaze the bread.  Form the loaves into balls for the second rise.  Bake ten minutes, do the first glaze, bake another ten minutes, do the second glaze, then bake the last ten minutes.   Glazing before baking causes your bread to collapse.

This recipe was quite good, if you dunk all the bread in soup.  I had it with a delicious broccoli-cheddar soup.  I was able to scrape the bowls into pretty thin shells without any leaking.  But still serve these on some sort of plate, just in case.

2015.12.06
I have made these a number of times.  Now I use the full recipe and only make six loaves.  I am still using the same eggwash technique.  Tonight I used two cups of whole wheat flour in place of the same quantity of AP flour and added a couple tablespoons gluten.  This worked well.  (Also, I can never work in that last cup of flour.  I usually end up with 6.5 cups total.)

So great! I followed other's wisdom and used garlic salt and oregano when brushing the bread. SO good! I do wish I'd stuck with the 8 bowls, putting it to 6 made them too big for us. But other than that, I will definitely be repeating these.

These did not turn out for me. I wonder about no sugar or honey with the water and yeast. I'm not sure as I bake homemade bread all the time without issue. I used new bread flour too.

I prefer a crispy crust versus the chewy crust that this recipe produces, but that can be easily remedied.  Perfect with broccoli cheese soup!!!

I wasn't overjoyed with how this recipe turned out.  I thought the flavor was pretty ho-hum, and they leaked a lot.  Maybe they would have worked better with a cream soup - I made chicken noodle.  However, my husband and another guy who was eating dinner with us that night both said they liked the bowls.  I just thought the taste was lacking, compared to how delicious homemade bread usually is.

This is a GREAT recipe.  Simple and easy.  I followed the advice of several here and skipped the first egg wash.  I also only used 2 cups of flour after the initial 4 instead of 3 (total of 6 instead of 7).  If you are in Salt Lake City or a similar elevation/climate, I recommend only using the initial 4, then 2 more while kneading in your mixer.  The recipe also says to knead by hand after the flour is all in, but I just let it go in my Bosch for 5 minutes like I do with other white breads.  They turned out GREAT!  Just a side note, you could probably get away with doing 8, but I did six.  They are very big bowls.

I like to butter and toast the 'pull-outs' and serve along side for dipping. Sooo good.   Also definitely add a bit of sugar to yeast and either spray water in oven or, like others have said, place a small container of water in bottom of oven to create steam for crispness.

I made eight of these, and thought that they were the perfect size. I did add 1 Tsbp of sugar to the dough to help them rise a little better, and it worked perfectly. They baked up beautifully, and tasted delicious! I'll make these over and over, because my family and I loved them!

These were wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half, since I have a small family and followed the suggestion of cutting the original yield from 8 to 6.  So, rather than making 4, I made 3 and it worked out exactly right.  I didn't have any trouble working with the dough, though two out of three of the bowls had bottom failure (oh no!) prior to being filled.  I found that if the dough was at all folded when it baked, it would create a crease in that spot which would fail when the time for hollowing it out came.  SO!  I've learned and will be extra sure not to have any folds next time.  They were otherwise a very good consistency and taste.

I recommend making 6 loaves rather than 8.  Flatten the balls a bit before baking so that the results are more bowl-like than ball-like.  I appreciate that these are hardy so they will hold up to moist soup, but don't expect them to be as soft as classic Italian bread.  Overall, yummy and fun - I will make again.

oh... these are wonderful, beautiful, delicious bread bowls. I added sugar, italian seasoning and garlic salt to the dough.  The bowls baked up so beautiful, I didn't want to serve them for dinner, I wanted to put them on display.  Yes, a bit nerdy I know but, I wasn't expecting them to turn out so perfect.  I do have to tell you though, I made the mushroom & potato chowder from this site (very good) to go with the bowls. But for some reason they didn't compliment each other very well. And though there were mixed reviews, some seemed to love it. I would not recommend it together.  I would love to try the Zuppa Toscana or the Taco Soup with the bowls though.  I can't wait to make them again!

Don't let the bread rise too long, or else it'll deflate and get crusty.

Very delicious bread--I love the crispy bottom.  I went off one the pictures somebody posted of this recipe, and another person's comments, and modified it a little.  I divided the dough into eighths, but I only formed 6 bread bowls.  I used the extra for long braids that I arranged around the crown of each bowl.  When they were finished baking, I hollowed out the bowls inside the perimeter of the braid; it added a little more depth to the bowls, and they turned out quite lovely.

I use this recipe every time I make a creamy soup like potato soup or beer cheese soup.  I halve the recipe and put everything into the bread machine on the dough cycle.  I then shape them and let them rise and then bake as directed.  I completely skip the cornmeal and eggwash and we never miss it.  Chewy and yummy!

This is really delicious. I don't understand why people complain about it being bland.  It's white bread, it's not supposed to be a blast of flavor.  It is delicious with some butter.  At first I was worried because before i put the loafs into the oven they looked kind of droopy.  Luckily the heat of the oven activated the yeast again.  I added a little bit more sugar than I was supposed to to activate the yeast but it still came out great.  Also I baked them a couple minutes longer than I was supposed to.  I like a really nice crust on my bread, and it will hold the soup better.  I like to serve these with "Russian Mushroom and Potato Soup" on this website.  Try it out!  Make sure your yeast is still good.  Oh btw, I didn't have packets of yeast so 2 tbsp is about the equivalent.

I made these tonight to serve chili in and we were really pleased with the end result.  The only reason the recipe did not receive 5 stars is because we found the bowls a little on the small side (we had to refill them to have enough for a main dish).  Much easier to make than I anticipated, so I will be making them again for sure.

i've reviewed many, many recipes from this website with much success, but no so much with this recipe.  i was tempted to stop adding flour at 5 cups, but stayed true to the recipe instead.  i ended up with biscuit-style bread that lacks flavor.  had no trouble with rising or anything else.  i timed everything so no variation can account for the not-so-great result.  oh, well. on to a different recipe.  good luck!

It's pretty hard to overcook these. If anything, the crust just gets crustier! I serve these bread bowls with dips, and tear up the middles and serve them on the side. If you don't like your bread too dense, don't knead it half way through the rising process. Just lightly punch down and split them before shaping them, and then bake them immediately after they rise.

Excellent bread bowl recipe! I followed the advice of others and added garlic powder and herbs for more flavor. I think it would have been more bland without. I also put 3 packages of yeast since so many said that their bowls were flat. They came out wonderful! Next time I will take off 5 minutes, they were a little dark. Thanks!

Fantastic! I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and divided the dough in half instead of 8's. I ended up baking one big bread bowl with one 1/2 and two mini baguettes with the other 1/2. Filled bread bowl with  Warm Blue Cheese Dip with Garlic and Bacon from this site and cubed the baguettes for dipping. AWESOME!!!

WOW - I am still amazed that my 1st attempt at make bread turned out soo well.... I made these this afternoon and they were just the best - better than storebought!! I added the ! TB of sugar to the yeast mixture as others suggested and some basil, garlic powder, marjerom, and parsley and used olive oil instead of veggie oil - wow I just cant believe these were soo good - followed the recipe otherwise... as soon as I got them out of the oven cut the tops off, scooped out the insides and put the Brocolli cheese soup that I made from a recipe I also found on this site - my family raved and raved how good everything was- it looked like something you would have bought at some fancy soup place! 
 thanks for a very wonderful recipe - though time consuming - is soo well worth it! WIll be making these time and time again!

I've made these bread bowls a number of times, and always get rave reviews.  We usually have them with a creamy clam chowder.  Some have commented that the "bowls" tend to flatten out.  I have had this problem too, but I have a solution: purchase a couple of 5 inch diameter by 3 inch deep aluminum cake pans.  They are just the right size for bread bowls.  Although the cylindrical bowls aren't quite as interesting as spherical ones, they are just as good and are always consistantly shaped!

I loved this bread!  I also had a problem with height though.  I think I will take another users advice and wrap them in tin foil next time.  But the bread itself was good.  I served it with Chicken and Corn Chili also from this site-delicious!

A few days ago, me and my fiance went out to eat at a place with awesome soup in the most wonderful bread bowls. Well we get there and find out that they no longer serve their soup in bread bowls. We were really bummed. So I decided to figure out how to make my own. Boy am I glad I did! These were fabulous. I made them into 6 bowls, otherwise followed recipe exactly. 6 made the perfect size bowls for us. Served with PW's "Perfect Potato Soup", which is also FABULOUS! This is a definite keeper. Tomorrow, I'll be making beef stew and am so excited to use the leftover bowls with it! Thank you so much for sharing!

I love these. I have made them several times. I have read reviews about them not rising. I had this problem once and I know why. I uses my kitchenaid for the entire process. You can't do that. You can use it to mix it all together, but then you actually need to turn it out on a floured surface and knead the dough.

Worked well. These were easy to make with a little time. I did divide them into four bowls instead of eight. Eight would have been too small of a bowl. Also if you want a crusty out side use the egg wash if not don't use egg was and rub butter on tops after removing from oven, they will be soft. My family loved them!

I made these tonight and filled then with seafood chowdah! I made 6 bowls instead of 8 and added 3 minutes extra to the baking time. (33 minutes total) 
 I placed them all on the same sheet and they did bake together but it wasn't a big deal, I easily cut them apart. I also baked them for the first 15 minutes while my oven was pre-heating and THEN brushed them with egg wash so they would be set in their shape. They were perfect. I make bread a lot, so I eat all types of flavors/types and I thought these were a perfect base for a soup.

I always bake mine inside oven safe bowls (then serve them in similar bowls) that way they have the perfect shape so the kids cant punch through them with the spoon and make a mess.

I made six bowls as many others suggested, which made a very nice serving size for a main dinner portion.  I added a bit of sugar to the yeast for proffing and a few Italian seasonings to the flour mix.  The family found them to be quite wonderful.  A bowl shape was difficult to obtain I believe I needed to add more flour.  Definately a recipe I will be doing againg and tweaking along the way.

Just made these,they made 6 HUGE, absolutely delicious bowls. I was in a pinch and only let them rise for about 20 mins each time you're supposed to let them which was my bad so they were a little less than perfect because they weren't as deep as they certainly would've been had i waited the correct time instructed. All i added was after i brushed with the egg was the first time,i sprinkled with some garlic salt. Then after scooping out the middle and before adding my stew,i sprinkled parm cheese in the bottom. My whole family loved these and after the stew sauce seeped into the bread it was just as tasty as it was fun to eat.

I really liked these.  I only had white wheat flour, so I think that may have affected my overall bread.  It was a little dry, and I think I will use quite a bit more salt next time.  I made brocolli cheese soup to fill these with!  Very tasty!

I added half a tablespoon of sugar, along with the warm water and yeast. I made six bowls, instead of eight, as other reviewers suggested. I also omitted the first egg wash. My bread bowls came out great, and this was a pretty easy recipe. It makes for a great presentation filled with vegetarian chili. YUM :)

These bread bowls are great, I'll never do store-bought again!  Easy to make, easy dough to work with, have turned out great EVERY time, and i've given the recipe away to many dinner guests!  I add granulated garlic, or whatever other seasonings I like to the dough to give it more flavor.

Didn't have a great taste and although they were round before the 2nd rise, they fell a bit flat.  still workable, but not sure how great these are as bread bowls for soup.  Maybe the salad would have stayed in.  I usually buy bread bowls from the bakery for french onion soup, add soup, melt cheese over the opening...yummy.  With these I added soup, then more soup, then noticed that before I could even add the cheese the soup was pouring out of the bread at a good drip.  A bit disappointed.

They are great however they turn out a big large.  Once you have filled them with soup, its a lot of soup and a lot of bread to eat.  Next time I make these I will make them a bit smaller.

Very nice!  I only got 6 bowls out of mine, all about palm sized, so I'm not sure if I messed up somewhere or not.  I dissolved my yeast with about 2tsp of sugar in the water and added dried garlic and oregano to the dough as I was kneading it.  Since I stuffed them with spaghetti (Yes, I know, unhealthy, putting carbs inside of carbs but it's a treat if only done occasionally)  I brushed the outside with some garlic Parmesan butter after they came out of the oven.  Very nice and customizable    recipe

These bowls turned out perfect! My DH baked them and served them with chili at a guys football get-together. He saved me one and I filled it with smoked salmon chowder. Delicious! The top was lightly crispy and the inside was soft and yummy. We'll make these over and over.

Loved these- I made these earlier in the week and froze them for Sunday. They may have been a tad on the small side but not bad at all. I made them as stated:)I made 2 dif recipes and these were the winner:) Just be sure to put them far enough apart.

The best way to eat any soup... incredible... bread bowls are really good but oh so filling... I don't know how anyone could eat these... if they make 6 out of this recipe.. althouh they might be a better size for a bowl... there is no way to eat it all... my dough was a little soft... I think if I added a little more flour they may hold there shape better... it would also be nice if there was some form for the bowls to rise in to keep them from spread... but other wise these worked very well... excellent way to serve any soup

I followed some other reviews and made 6 bread bowls. They came out so pretty. Added oregano and garlic salt to the top of each to make them pretty.

Mine sure didn't look like the picture. Baked 15 and were perfectly cooked. Found the taste was rather bland. I wouldn't bother again.

Not exactly what I expected, but it turned out pretty good. I made these for my husband with some chicken noodle soup, who came home from work sick. I cut the recipe in half, and took another reviewers advice to make the dough into three bowls instead of four.  I think next time I'll do four. These were pretty big.  I agree that they weren't the most flavorful bread I've ever eaten, but I found that kind of nice because the focus was the soup, not the breadbowl.  It was really good to soak up the broth with.

It took me 3 tries to get this recipe down, not because it was difficult but because I'd never made yeast bread on my own before. Tonight they came out with a thin, crispy crust. All three times I did add 1 tbsp sugar, reduce the flower a bit (I couldn't say how much, though) and substituted garlic salt for regular salt. Tonight we paired this with the Delicious Ham and Potato Soup from this site and topped it generously with fiesta blend cheese. YUM!

Very easy to make. I used bread flour and olive oil as substitutes. I added about a teaspoon each of crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning...should have added more to give a little flavor. We ate butternut squash bisque (recipe on the site) and it was very filling.

Very easy to make. I did sub the veggie oil for olive oil because thats what was out on my counter. I served clam chowder in these bowls and they really held up well and tasted great. Thanks for taking the intimidation factor out of these with such an easy recipe to follow!!

I absolutely love this recipe.  You can use it as a basic recipe and add any flavorings you want.  I love sweet bread so I add lots of sugar.  I have also made it with half white flour and half wheat since my family is diabetic.  You can also add cinnamon and raisins.  The great thing about this recipe is it always rises nice and it versatility.  Thanks for a great recipe

Great recipe!  I used wheat instead of white flour, which still worked fine.  I also find that this recipe only makes about 6 bowls instead of 8.

These didn't turn out for me. They were too small. I just served them as round loaves. EDIT: I made these again and they turned out well. I don't know how I messed up the first time, but the second time they were good. Used whey instead of water. I had leftover bread from the insides of the bowls (we didn't use them for dipping) and used it in Bread Pudding II from this website. I agree with the other reviewers who say the flavour is just okay. It was fine for us because my son really just wanted to be able to say that he had a bowl of soup and then ate the bowl too ;)

These bowls were really delicious! I had rave reviews from the whole family. I was going to stick with the recipe and make 8 bowls, but I really only needed 6. They were a great size. Thanks for a keeper!

I agree that these bake up a bit flat.. also, I think the serving size is off a bit. As written, each bowl is pretty darn small. I haven't found a better recipe yet, though.

I was a little bit nervous because I had never made bread bowls before.  When I finished mixing it in my KitchenAid it was a crumby mess, but after kneading it for 10 minutes it was great.  I made 6 bowls with it.

This is the second time I have made these bread bowls, and I am pleased with the results. As per other members' reviews,e I added a tablespoon of sugar, but I also added White Pepper Powder and Dried Oregano to the dough :] makes it delish and smells like pizza dough! Instead of the egg wash, I use milk + garlic oil + oregano + white pepper powder. I'm also thinking of making it a bit cuter by adding little knobs of dough to the top, so it has a handle! :D

Very good.  I needed to make miniature bread bowls and tried two different ways.  I tried putting a small amount into muffin tins and I tried just rolling the balls and placing them on a baking sheet.  The ones on the baking sheet turned out better, but both methods worked.  I made about 24 mini bread bowls with this recipe.  Very delicious and everyone loved them.  For homemade bread it was that hard to make either!

Loved everything about this recipe.  It was easy and delicious.  My family loved them.  I added garlic and parsley to the dough.  I scooped out center and filled each bowl with black beans with a sprinkle of cheese on top.  DELICIOUS!!!

These bread bowls were "souper!" I followed the recipe fairly close. I added a TBSP of sugar, and didn't do the egg white and cornmeal. Instead I brushed the tops with butter. It made them super crisp, and strong, which I was worried that the egg whites might not do. Also, I took other's advice and only made 6 instead of 8 bowls. I think anything smaller would have been just a tease :o). In fact, next time, I'll only make 2 or 4. We like big servings! The perfect bread bowl for a hearty helping of potato soup. Pictures to come.

yeah, this bread was a total flop...literally!  It didn't rise right, there was no way it could have been used as bowls...but I figured "use them just as bread"...it was way to bland, even my bread devouring 8 year old didn't like it at all!  Will find a different recipe for next time!

Very good!  Nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Was a little bland in taste for me but otherwise pretty good.  I served it with some chicken stew/soup and it went over really well especially on a very cold day.  Will definitely make again.

These were not at all what I had hoped for. I found them to be pretty dry . I couldn't eat them with the chowder I made, as planned. Not bad, just not fantastic like I had hoped. I think I was looking for something a bit more "holey"... I'll keep looking...

Wow, what a great, crusty bread--and my KitchenAid mixer made quick work of it easily! I used olive oil and added 1 tsp Italian Seasoning.  After the first rise, I cut the dough into 6 pieces and used 4 of them for the bread bowls.  The other 2 pieces I cut into 3 pieces each, shaped into rolls, let rise again, and baked.  These are the best rolls--very filling and good--and they rival bakery rolls.  I'll definitely be making these on a regular basis.  Thank you!!

Great bread bowls!  I added a Tbsp of sugar as advised by other reviewers.  I also made 4 rather than 8 bread bowls, but I think I will try 6 next time.  They were very large.  Although they flattened a little more than I expected, they were still great and served their purpose as bowls.  Served with "Cheesiest Potato Soup".

This is my second yeast recipe, and they came out perfect! I took the advice of other reviewers and made 4 bowls, instead of 8 and served Angel's old fashioned beef stew in the bowls.

Dinner was a hit. The recipe is easy to follow, and makes a wonderful, crusty, Italian bread.

Thank you so much for this recipe Kerri.

I was a bit disappointed with these. I halved the recipe, and made 2 bowls. Although I followed the recipe exactly, the bowls ended up quite small and dense. The taste was ok, but nothing outstanding. Thanks anyway.

I used olive oil instead of veg. The egg wash really helps make a nice shiny crust surface.I thought these were a bit salty, but I will make them again. 8 were a tiny bit too small(kid size serving)I think I'll make 6-7 next time, I dont want a humungous bowl, just big enough for grown ups. They did flatten a bit, I think the trick is too let them rise in something so they dont spread too much.

These came out picture perfect. Airy texture, beautiful color. Thank you all for the advice of using a form. I baked them in Corningware soup bowls. They kept their shape pretty well. I also used 2 Tablespoons of yeast and 2 Tablespoons of sugar and all the flour. I mixed in the KitchenAid but had to take out the dough to hand knead to get it smooth and elastic. This is such a winning recipe. We always order soup in bread bowls at Disneyland and now I can make it anytime for my family. Thank you all who visit this site! It's my fav.

Very good. I made two big bowls for dips.  Try "Best Spinach Dip Ever", it's great in one of these bowls.

These are very good when dipped in soup. I have yet to put soup in one because they did indeed turn out too flat but next time I will try cooking them in round ramekins.

This is a very good, tasty, crusty, white bread. I had problems keeping them round, so I have made alluminum foil bowls and also have used small, round pyrex dishes, coated the inside with non-stick cooking spray, and let them rise and cook in those. The crust won't brown as nicely, but they make beautiful bowls. I usually scrape them out and fill it with either that African Chicken Stew or a chili, anything that is hearty but saucy.

Absolutly love this recipe! This bread bowl was my first attempt at making any kind of bread and I've made it several times. Love, love, love it! But instead of making 8 little bowls I make four larger ones and bake them a little longer. Turns out Great!

I rate these a 5 for simplicity, appearance and functionability.  I received many compliments on them...not just taste, but appearance too!  They look like a bakery item when finished, so don't skip the egg wash!    Thank you Kerri!

If you know how to make bread, this recipe is very simple!! We split dough in fourths for bigger bowls. We also used stoneware bowls to form our bread bowls. Grease stoneware and sprinkle cornmeal in bottom. Plop your little dough baby in the stoneware and let raise to desired height. Egg wash, we used the whole egg (not just the whites). Follow original directions from here??
Ps season your bread however you want!! Different seasonings go well with different soups. Listen to your tongue and nose!! Be creative?

I LOVE THESE!!! It was my first time making homemade bread and my nephew thought I was a chef they were so good. I didn't change a thing I only cut the recipe in half and made four deliciously golden brown chili bowls. I am making them again now (its on the 1st rise) and the dough seemed very dry and tough, so hopefully they are still as good as the 1st time.

I too have a problem with yeast breads but I finally did it right! Halved the recipe,  kneaded with my stand mixer and dough hook for 6 mins  on med low. Proofed 1 hour in oven with glass bowl of hot water (preheated oven to 200 then turned off). Punched down dough then formed 3 equal balls. I was worried about balls flattening out like past attempts so I made foil bowls by placing  double sheets of heavy duty foil over the bottom of a normal cereal size bowl and shaping my own oven safe bowls. I sprayed with oil and dusted with corn meal. I sprayed the tops of dough and dusted those with corn meal also. Put the dough balls in the bowls then placed on baking  sheet. Sprayed plastic wrap , very important to spray well and covered. Back into my oven for second proof about 45 mins. I baked at 400 for 10 mins BEFORE I used the egg wash so there was no chance of deflating them. Worked great. Having with lobster bisque. I also added the garlic powder when mixing.

Made these  lined with cheese and filled with tomato soup.  My four big boys loved them.  Saw the recipe on facebook, but lightened up with a lower fat provolone and muenster.  I made six instead of eight which worked out nicely.   I am not a huge baker, but these were super  easy to make, had the perfect balance of light crispiness on the outside and soft chewiness on the inside.  They rose quickly.  One of my sons did walk by and slapped one of them causing it to deflate, but it popped back up in the oven pretty well.  I found that cooking spray and the cornmeal on top caused less sticking on my second batch.  I was going to buy bread bowls at 3 bucks each which would've costed $18 for six of them.  I ended up only spending a little over  3 bucks to make all of them, and they tasted like something from a restaurant.   I did only have to buy yeast and flour. ...had the oil and cornmeal.   My 25 year old, who has expensive taste, said they were gourmet quality.   The boys faught over the last one, and after much refereeing  I convinced them to split it.  The boys requested them with french onion soup for next week.  Seriously, if I can make these....anyone can.  Great recipe!

I will make this again. I did add a tablespoon of sugar to the water and yeast.  Then I put everything in my kitchen aid and let it mix for 6 min. I let rise for 45 minutes. I used a whole egg for the wash, not just the whites, because I think it gives it better color. Was amazing, smelled amazing cooking and was an easy recipe!

I didn't make any changes and I felt they turned out great, my husband and I filled one bowl each of soup and ate one bread on the side it was more than enough. The top was firm the inside was soft and spongey and the bottom was nice and crunchy. They made the perfect soup bowls, we've been wanting to make these for a while and it turned out great. 
I didn't have any problem with them leaking soup or sticking to the pan.. I will def use this recipe again. Thanks

I made this recipe a few days ago and loved it. I am the bread maker(literally, I'm always making bread) in this household, and my husband wanted to help. When he put the egg wash on, the loaves flattened and I was sad. So, this time I did it myself. The bread stayed up for a few minutes and then flattened(although not as bad.) That's the only problem with this recipe. The dough is very delicate. So, next time I will not be putting the egg wash on before I put it in the oven. This is actually my new go-to bread recipe. As for alterations, I almost always add vital wheat gluten to my breads since I use wheat flour. 
Also, why do people keep saying they're having a hard time forming a bowl for the oven? You form a ball, cook it, cut the top off, and gut it.

10-18-15 ~ Loved the ease and the taste of these delicious bowls.  The first time we had soup served in a bread bowl was in San Francisco in 2013 and my DH has not forgotten it.  He is a HUGE bread eater.  I made as written and weighed the dough out so that I would have 8 even pieces to work with.  The bread rose beautifully and was delicious served with 'Gamma Brown's Corn Chowder' from AR.  I didn't need eight bowls, so my DH enjoyed the extras loaves  for days, making a sandwich with slices and had it toasted for his breakfast.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  If you want smaller bowls, that could easily be done with this recipe.

As suggested by the reviews I added a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast. I also added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder (I love it garlicky ) to the flour , and garlic and oregano to the eggwash 
Tastes amazing ! The house will smell wonderful 
Nothing beats baking your bread ! 
I halted the recipe and it made 4 small/medium bowls which I thought were perfect
 25 mins prep (10 while the yeast activates and 15 for kneading cause I don't have a machine) 70 mins proof (divided) 30-35 mins baking 
I kept spraying the oven with water while baking 
Already made twice and planing to make more

No substitutions. Good, but not perfect! The texture is just right - soft on the inside, crisp on the outside. The flavor on its own is nothing to brag about, but you're filling it with your favorite soup, so it's not that obvious in the final product.

This turned out well! I used 2 Tbls. of sugar and instead of vegetable oil I used Tuscan seasoned olive oil.  I also add wheat germ, ground flax seed, and chia seeds. It was delicious with broccoli cheese soup on a snow day.

I feel inadequate rating this recipe since this was my first attempt at making bread bowls.  The dough reacted well in the rising stages though, I believe I put too much flour in it and ended up with some weird shaped bowls.  The final product tasted a lot like biscuit and I don't think the soup I used was very complementary to the bread.  If I can get over my embarrassment at the failure, I will probably try to make these again, the right way next time.

I cut this recipe in half and made 3 bowls.  They were a good size, although I think I could have easily made 4, per the recipe.  This was my first time making bread bowls and I had a bit of trouble with them flattening.  The flavor was okay, but if I make them again I think I will try adding a bit of seasoning to kick them up a notch.  thanks for sharing this recipe, Kerri Skrudland!

This was really easy and SO good. I made it to go with homemade chili. It was the perfect accompaniment. I made the recipe "as is". In the future I plan to try making 10 portions instead of 8, as the bowls were slightly larger than my preferred average portion.

Delicious!!! Made just as recipe says, used bread machine and it was a bit much so I had to stir a few times and then cover with a damp towel when it rose higher than lid. 8 was great.  Used for pepperoni pizza soup and then sliced a couple extra to have along side dinner the next couple of nights.  Great flavor Can't say enough about how much I loved this recipe

This will be the second time I have used this recipe, I am not knocking any stars because of my ability to cook (I'm a great cook) or because I divided the dough into a smaller amount than recommended. I am giving it all stars because it totally deserved it! GREAT RECIPE!!

I make bread a lot and was very disappointed in this. For one, I should have listen to other reviewers and made 4 bowls and not 8. As is, this recipe makes for very tiny bowls that are fairly flat and not suited for soup. The bread was also very bland. Spices are definitely needed.

Good although they did flatten some but still goodfor soup bowls. I added italian seasoning, a pinch extra yeast, a tsp. Sugar to feed yeast, 1 tbls butter and garlic powder to the egg wash which created a wonderfully subtle aroma while enjoying my broccoli cheese soup. (Also on this site) my husband liked them both as did my 11 month old daughter.

These came out tasting really great, but I think I messed up and should have re-shaped them into balls after the last rise. They just came out too flat for bread bowls. :( We still tried, but it wasn't as practical as it would've been if they were deeper.

Next time that's the only change I would make, otherwise they're great.

Also, for the rises I covered the dough with a damp towel and put in the oven with the light on. Worked perfectly!

Love this recipe. Yes time consuming, but it is rising bread and that's part the fun. 
I made these for St Patricks and spooned in Irish stew. It was great! And a fun change for my family.
On a side note...having the bread turn out nearly perfect the first time (and the first time I ever made bread) gave me a little boost in confidence as a baker and mom...brought back some memories if my own mom baking when I was little.

Made these to serve with chicken stew. They were pretty good but quite a lot of work - I'm not sure I'd make them again for this purpose. 
I made 6 bowls but probably should have made 8 - I found them very large and filling. 

I added 1.5 tsp garlic powder and 1.5 tsp thyme, and used 3 c ww flour and 4 c flour.
I cooked for 30 mins at 400 - maybe should have cooked longer? 
Tips: Use egg wash over as much of bread as possible (not just tops) to firm up crust. Take off baking pan ASAP onto cooling rack. Internal temp should be at least 200F. Overcooking is probably better than undercooking for this purpose.

I have wanted to make these for my wife for some time. I read other reviews and opted to change the recipe slightly to add more flavor. I added honey for a sweetener (1/8-1/4 cup) as well as substituting a garlic salt for the salt in the recipe. After brushing with egg white I also added a light coating of garlic powder and oregano. I was thrilled with the flavor as it did not overpower the soup but complimented it. My wife really liked the flavor of the bread and ate the whole thing. I cut dough into 6 pieces instead of 8. This was fine but if you are adding a side salad you may not want to do this. If you have some really hungry people I could see cutting to 4 bowls. Overall I was very satisfied and will make again.

I cut the recipe in half and make 2 larger bowls for my hot spinach artichoke dip!  The bread is nice and dense and holds up well to this!  I usually use quick rise yeast and I can bake the bread in the time I am preparing my dip.

I made the recipe pretty much just as it was written.  It turned out fantastic!  The only change I made was instead of 8 bowls, I made 6 (which increased the baking time a little bit).  Overall, this made them the perfect dinner size.  The bread itself is a little flat-tasting, it could use about 1 tsp more salt (for a total of 1 Tbsp).  But with the soup inside, it was just right.

We made these tonight and loved them.  The bread is very simple in flavor which let our soup really shine through.  When the loaves first came out of the oven I was concerned because they seemed small.  Once I finished one full of soup I decided that the size was actually just right.  We filled ours with a hearty broccoli cheddar soup.

The only changes I made was that I added 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, and separated the dough into 4 bowls, not 8.
4 bowls, give a nice cereal bowl size, that easily holds about 1 to 1 1/2 cup of soup.

Easy to make. Delicious!

I made this recipe for the 1st time today.  I would make 6 bowls instead of 8, add more salt, and not as much flour.  I thought the recipe worked well but, for me, the bread was too dense and lacked flavor (I'm at a little over 3, 000 ft. elevation).  I hope to try this again with these revisions!  :)

I am a complete novice when it comes to bread, this was such an easy recipe I too made 6 bowls rather than 8 simply because i was cooking for 6.  My husband and kids raved about them even the fussy one who refuses to eat the crust off bread ate the whole bowl......:)

Just started making bread again.  Flour water ratio good.  I did add sugar as all the recipes I made in the past always used a bit.  More kneading time required to get nice firm spring back dough...but you'll need to add bits of flour in if you knead it longer.  More rising time needed on first round.  Second round was just about right.  I have never put egg wash on my bread.  Something went wrong.  The loaves started to shrink..perhaps the water in the egg was supposed to be hot?  Will try again as the process was simple compared to a 3 round rise recipe I have.

These were great! I used half of the recipe and threw on some yummy seasoning on top of the bowls during their last set it in the oven. They didn't rise as much as I expected (I think my "damp cloth" was too heavy) so next time I might not make it damp at all. I made these on Valentine's Day and cut them out in heart shapes. It was so cute! I made the garden fresh tomato soup recipe with these and it was all delish!

I made a double batch of this following the directions exactly.  As I read through the reviews, I think I know why those that struggled with it falling flat was.  Yes mine also fell somewhat flat.  The ones that fell flat were no longer warm. They had gotten cold and fell.  The others that I had closer to the stove and heat stayed puffed up.  So I will make these again but make sure the area is warmer when making them.  I did use the oven as one reviewer stated with a pan of hot boiling water on one side of the oven and the other side with the dough, it rose very well that way.  Other than that this is a fantastic recipe and will be made more times in the future.  I look forward to making a pasta bowl out of it.  Oh, and for the second rising in 8 rounds, make sure it is in a warm place as that really helped it to rise well the first time and the second time.  I just got to find a place to put it while it waits for the oven.

I am not an expert bread baker.  Living at 7,000 feet often adds to my less-than-perfect results.  However, this recipe turned out fabulously!  I followed the advice of others and made the dough into 6 generous bowls, and added Italian herbs and garlic powder, as well as waiting to bruch with the egg wash until  after the first 15 minutes of baking.  i intend to use this a lot -- and not just for bread bowls!

I generally cut this recipe in half and make 3 bread bowls instead of 4. This creates bread bowls of a more suitable size for our tastes. 

I prepare the dough in the bread machine (using olive oil in place of other oils), utilizing the 1.5 hour "dough" cycle. I then form the bread bowls and let them rise on the stove top (with the oven on) for about an hour. 

The dough itself as it stands is a bit bland for my taste... I generally add a handful of fresh rosemary and a tablespoon or so of garlic powder. Instead of an egg wash, I use a butter "wash", which complements the rosemary and garlic nicely. These also require a longer baking time than mentioned in the recipe to crisp the outside of the bowl (25 - 30 minutes). I just play it by ear (or eye) and watch for the bowls to begin to brown. 

With those changes, this is my "go-to" bread bowl recipe. :)

Sub 2 tbs for 4 tbs butter for taste. Bread flour will give you a better, fluffier bread. I never use electric mixers to kneed bread, you get better results by hand. Also when dissolving yeast in warm water make sure it dosent get hotter than 110 as it will kill the yeast, sprinkle with a pinch of sugar, the yeast likes sugar.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made the standard 8 bowls (they each hold a serving but the bowls are sturdy enough that we just ate the top and middle with the first fill and then refilled the bowl with more soup :)  We used four of the bowls and I individually wrapped and froze the other four.  We've been thawing those out and slicing up for bread with dinner, which makes enough for the four of us with each "bowl".  I also added Italian Seasoning and onion flakes to the dough before baking and they go perfectly with savory dishes.  Will definately be putting this at the top of the recipe pile!

I loved this recipe and everyone loved it also. But I will have too make 2 batches next time because even after I formed it into 6 balls they were still too small. Other than that It was a great recipe and I will use this all year round all the time!! Thank you!!!!

The bread itself is a nice simple bread and turned out well, though flatter than I would have preferred (but that is not necessarily the recipe's fault). However, as a bread bowl, this bread is awful. It absorbed so much of the liquid from the soup that it started turning to mush. The crunchy crust on the outside was the only thing that didn't turn to goop.

These bread bowls looked so appetizing, making a simple creamed soup look very appealing.  The texture of the bread was perfect, holding up wonderfully to the soup.  This is a great way to make a simple soup look exceptional.

Great recipe!  I only made a few MINOR changes....I split the recipe in half since it's just my husband and me.   I also added a tsp of garlic powder to the dough and then topped the bread bowls with some butter and minced garlic instead of the egg white. We really enjoyed eating them!

I could not have been happier with these bread bowls! I do agree that the size would be a little nicer if I would've made 4-6 instead of the 8. I will definetly use this recipe again! I think my next go will be for Christmas with cheesey broccoli soup and baked potatoe soup. This was my 1st attemp ever and I was VERY happy! Thank you for the excellent recipe and the AWESOME instructions!

People who complained about these not getting big enough might look to the instructions. Basic bread making gives 1 hour to do the first rise and 1 hour for the second rise. The rising times are too short in this recipe but respect basic bread rising times and you should be good.

These were very good!  I made six bowls so that they were a little bigger.  I found that it worked better to make the dough into balls, instead of trying to make a "bowl" shape with a flat bottom.  I actually made two batches, and the "ball" shape turned out better.  As they rise, and then bake, they tend to flatten out a bit anyway.  If you make them too flat before rising, you get flat bread not really suitable for a bowl (but good for eating anyway).  The taste of these was very good combined with the soup (I made broccoli cheese soup to go with it).

These tasted fabulous!  I made a creamy chicken soup to go in them, and the bread bowls made the meal!  Mine came out too flat, my husband called them bread plates, but it still worked.  I need to figure out how to make them stay round.

Very easy recipe, even for people without a logic experience making bread. I agree with the reviewer who said that this only makes 6 bowls - if I had made 8, they would have been tiny. I mixed garlic powder with the egg wash. Otherwise, they would have been very bland, even filled with soup. I made minestrone soup to go in the bowls, and it was a big hit!

I just made these and they look wonderful-haven't eaten them yet but if they taste as good as they look, they are going to be wonderful.  I did add about 1 tsp. of sugar cause I thought you need sugar and salt to cause the yeast to react.  Also, I only needed about 6 and 1/3 cups of flour, not the seven cups.  baked a total of 25 minutes @ 400 degrees. I am filling them with vegetable soup.

Great recipe as written.  I noticed several reviews recommended making 6 bowls instead of 8, saying 8 was not big enough.  So I made 6 too.  They were huge.  I think 8 would have been a much better size.  Next time I'll stick with 8.

These were easy to make, and everything happened in the times listed.  I usually use a bread machine to make doughs in, but made these by hand.  They turned out great, and everyone loved the idea of having potato soup in them.

oh gosh, these are good. I tried some of it with butter and it is so good.  And it is great as a soup bowl.  I did add some Italian Seasoning and some garlic powder to the dough.  I did as others suggested and made 6 bowls.  Next time I will make 8, or even 7.  There is alot of bread to have to eat also, and I couldnt finish it all.  I did butter the tops and the big chunk out of the middle.  I guess I could have saved that instead of serving it.  I also scooped out more around the edges that I did save for bread crumbs for another day.   I noticed some creases that I was afraid might compromise the sides when I put soup in it but they seemd to hold up just fine.  Anyways, will make these again and again.  They werent difficult at all and the end reward is so worth it.  Thanks for sharing!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had to proof my yeast twice. The 1st time I followed the instructions and my yeast did NOTHING. So I proofed more yeast with a teaspoon of sugar for the yeast to feed on voila creamy frothy yeast. Obviously my bread had a TINY touch of sweetness but I didn't mind much as the bowls were filled with chili. I also agree with the previous post which recommends making 6 bowls not 8. Other than that it was a fun easy FANTASTIC recipe!

Really good taste, and did the job as a bowl well.  I made six loaves, and the bowls were the right size.  My mixers were straining after only 4 cups of flour, so I had to stop and knead in more by hand.  Even then the dough was saturated with four at 5 1/2 cups!  If this happens to anyone else, don't worry, the bread will still turn out.  I also learned the egg white is important to giving it a tough "shell" to be water tight as a bowl.

After my second attempt these turned out great!  However, if you want nice sized bowls you can only get 5...maybe 6 bowls out of this recipe.  Everyone loved them!

Amazing! Great as bread bowls or make smaller for dinner rolls. I used Bread Flour instead of All Purpose the 2nd time and they turned out even better!

A bit time consuming but well worth the effort. My family was impressed by these yummy bread bowls and the shrimp bisque that I made to go with it. I followed others suggestions and added 2 Tbsp garlic powder to the dough and then sprinkled dried parlsey and basil when I brushed the breads with the egg white wash. Next time, I will try making these with some rosemary to give it more flavor.

I love to bake bread and have tried a ton of recipes! This is an extremely easy recipe! I used the leftovers, sliced, and served with warm cream cheese dip for appetizers-AWESOME FLAVOR! Makes a great bread for Panini's too!

Wow!  I'm pretty new to bread baking, so I decided on this recipe because it seemed fairly straightforward.  It came out delicious!  I didn't use as bread bowls, just shaped into small, round loaves and sliced.  Delicious!  Thanks for making me feel practically professional!

I love this recipe! It is the first time I made anything apart from the whole wheat loaf, and I am so glad. I served it with Zucchini Bisque and salad.   My husband after dinner - "So, where did you buy the bread from?" Needless to say, he was shocked by the answer.   I tried brushing it with olive oil and toasting as one reviewer has mentioned, but I didn't feel it was worth it considering the extra calories - the bread soaks up the soup anyway, so I'd rather skip the toasting. But I think I'll add a little garlic to the dough next time for flavour, it was a wee bit too bland for me.

Truly easy - which is a must with 5 kids.  Loved the idea for the bread bowl shaping.  Worked very well.  Filled with a free-form lasagna I make - sprinkled w/ cheese.  RAVE REVIEWS from the family.  Will be coming back to this over & over.  Thanks!

Followed most of the recipe. Did add extra spice per reviews. Used the Kitchenaid to mix 2 cups of Whole Wheat flour with the rest of the AP flower. The dough came up very high in the bowl and punched it down and cut into 6 portions. I oiled the tops of the buns with EVOO and set them on a cookie sheet on top of the gas range while heating the oven. The buns came up very tall (about 4 1/2") but when I brushed on the water and egg white mix the dough deflated. Bummer Dude!! The bread was still a big success tonight served with Beer Cheese Soup VI. The ladies asked if they could have some of the buns to take home and with what's left some will be split in half and turned into personal pizzas! Did I say this bread tasted great??!! I'll try the bread bowls again but next time I won't put the eggwash on!     ****UPDATE**** Tried this again and they turned out perfect. I think I just over proofed the fist time through. I am going to do it once with out the WW flour just for giggles and grins!

These were fabulous!  I made a few changes per other reviews: used Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil, added 1 tbsp sugar and oregano/garlic/black pepper to dough while kneading.  I made 4 bowls.  They were rather shallow, but held our soup just fine.  Filled with the "Delicious Ham & Potato Soup" from this site.  My husband and I both thought these were wonderful and I will definitely make them again!

These were delicious!  I did make a few changes.  First, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, I added 1 tsp of a garlic/Italian seasoning mixture. Also, to avoid the bowls being under cooked, as a few people mentioned, I cooked an additional five minutes.  I also only made 5 soup bowls since I do enjoy the bowls a little bigger.  Soup in these bowls are so delicious you can even eat the dishes!!!

I love this bread recipe and i use it when making all my bread anymore.  It's wonderful as is and when you want to go alittle fancy i like to add wheat flour, or oatmeal, or 5 grain creal to it.  It is great with alittle garlic and italian seasoning, and parmesan cheese added to it, depending on what your serving it with.  Tonight I'm making sweet potato bisque and am serving it with this bread that I added sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom to.  Delish!

We haven't actually sat down to eat them yet, but I thought I'd put down my thoughts.  The recipe is nice.  (I used part (maybe 1/3) Whole wheat flour. Oh and I added spices and skipped the egg wash.   They do, as most have noted, seem to flatten out and become more wide than tall.  Next time I will make sure and get them in to bake as soon as they have risen just enough.  I also tried re-kneading the balls and letting them rise some more and it looks like it worked out.  Maybe skipping the first kneading and just kneading the balls twice?  or once if I can get them in fast enough... lol. Certainly one to have fun with...  I'll post again if I figure something out...  (once I've totally and maybe unnecessarily re-written the recipe as I have a habit of doing... lol.)

This is a great recipe. A bit time consuming as you have to wait two rounds for the dough to rise, but otherwise, easy to make. It was a bit tough to use the electric mixer while blending the dough during the "half cup" stages. I ended up shutting the mixer off after about the 6 cup and mixing it by hand. I didn't add any herbs like some of the other reviewers, but next time around I definately will. I made 6 bowls, which seemed to be the right size. I flattened my bowls out a bit, but next time around, I will try to make them rounder and higher. It seems while baking they flattened out even more, so they weren't as deep as I would have liked. Otherwise, great recipe! Thank you...

I followed the directions exactly and got enough dough to make about 5 - not 8 - bread bowls. The bread itself is extremely plain - even after following another reviewers suggestions to brush the outside with herbs along with the egg wash. I think next time I'll add some wheat flour and herbs right to the bread mix and hope it turns out more flavorful.

I added a few teaspoons of sugar to the water and yeast. That helped it rise great both times. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I added some garlic salt to the dough.  I did use cornmeal and I agree I think it helped prevent the dough from spreading flat. I used a whole beaten egg as a wash before I put it in the oven. It browned up great. I did cover it during the last 10 minutes. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would make these again with these changes.

Easy. Yummy. Tasted just like the ones from the store. I added a T sugar as suggested by other reviewers. I think next time I will make some "mini" ones for my littlest kids.

Absolutely NOT a bread bowl. It rose like it was supposed to, but when I put the "loaves" in the oven they expanded, but were flat. Perhaps you could put a spoonful of soup in each one, but they looked nothing like the pictures. The egg white wash made them brown too quickly. I will not be making these again any time soon.

This is a great basic bread bowl recipe.  I suggest if you want flavor do as others have suggested and add spices and herbs.  I made mine with a special italian seasoning salt spice that I had on hand!  The smells were beyond amazing!  I will definately be referencing this recipe again in the near future!

These were so great. My Family really enjoyed them. I put the beef stew VI that I found on this recepie. 

I was a little concerned about them flattening out because of all the reviews. However, I had no such problem. I made one minor and one major change though:
 Minor stuff:
As suggested by several others I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, made six instead of eight and put in a little extra flavoring. I added one of those ranch mix packets to the dough and it gave it a delicous flavor. My family loves ranch.
 Major thing:
I prepared and mostly baked mine the night before for about 20mins. (The trick is to not open the oven door before the bread has a chance to set- just like a cake) I refrigerated the rest of the egg wash and brushed the bread lightly with a little olive oil to keep it moist. Then I left the bread (still on the baking sheet) ontop of a cooling rack by the stove. I used a cookie sheet and a cutting board on either side to drape a towel to keep it covered but not touching. I checked it in the morning and brushed it again lightly with a little more oil. That evening I took a paper towel blotted off the oil and put another coat of the egg wash on. I baked them for almost 15 more minutes until they were golden brown. They turned out perfectly and was a great time-saver too!
Thank's for the recipe and all the wonderful variables/tips.

I didn't have any problem with the yeast rising, I made the dough in the bread machine and it turned out great.

My 8 year old son and I made this as a way to work on fractions, learn about yeast and of course, have some great bread. All missions were accomplished.  The bowls rose nicely. we forgot to add the garlic and herbs to the mixture, so we melted Earth Balance margarine (no dairy), and mixed it with olive oil and fresh garlic and used it in place of the egg wash. They came out perfect. We made several sizes.  BIG one for daddy, Medium for mommy and progressively smaller ones for the children.  Followed the directions and did spray twice during the cooking time which made a nice firm and crunchy outside, but the bread inside is soft and good.  Thanks for a great recipe! My son says, "It's really fun and easy!"

These were good w/the soup but kind of bland just for eating.  Mine didn't look like they were going to be deep enough for soup by the time they had doubled in size on the last rise, but to my surprise they popped up while baking and worked well.

My first ever bread without the bread machine.  A huge hit - my husband thought I had bought the bowls at first and then saw them on the counter.  My kids loved having their own dipping bowl!

These homemade bread bowls are so fun and delicious!  I found them quite easy to make.  I followed the recipe as stated as bread is not my speciality.  I made 4 bowls with this recipe; each dough ball was around 4" in diameter when I shaped it initially.  The end result was so tasty with the broccoli and potato soup I served!

Very good bread, i may not have let them rise enough because they came out a little flat, too flat for bowls, but we used them for dipping in the soup instead and they were delicious.

I've made this recipe several times.  I've found that when dividing them into 8 bowls, they turn out more like giant rolls.  We prefer to make 4, they're bigger and hold more soup.

This was good, however it didn't rise anything like I thought it should have, so the bowls were more like little cups.  I made them again and added sugar as well as a little wheat gluten and they rose better and were a little sweeter to the taste.  Wonderful!

After reading the reviews I used half whole wheat flour, and the taste was good. They did not rise like the picture, though, and that was disappointing. They still worked for bowls, though. I cut out the inside and put some chicken and cheese on the bottom, broiled that and then filled with cheesy broccoli soup from this site. It was a hit!

Not impressed at all.  Have been baking many years and have never seen a bread recipe that did not call for at least a little sugar to feed to yeast.  Mine turned out flat and very tough.  I know that I did not overwork the dough.

These were so good. It was my first time doing non-bread machine bread and I'm pretty pleased with myself!    I used the dough in 6 portions - 2 big, 2 med. and 2 small bowls - for the different appetites in my family.  Every single one of them wanted more!  I used the Smoky Potato Cheese Soup (this website) to fill them.  Everyone thought they were yummy!

This was the very first time I have ever made a yeast bread! It was lots of fun and rather easy actually. I would suggest mixing in the flour with a wooden spoon instead of electric beaters. The taste was a little bland on its own but once you put the soup into to it took on the flavours of the soup.
The only problem was that they were very small, next time I'll make four instead of eight.

These were very good bread bowls.  They lived up to the name because the outside was very crusty while the inside was soft like a good Italian bread should be.  I actually prefer the crust on my bread bowls less crunchy, but that's just my preference.

I made the recipe as stated except I used olive oil and baked them without the egg wash (both of my kids are allergic to eggs).  I made 6 bowls instead of 8.  They turned out the perfect size for a hearty bowl of chili or soup.  We have good appetites in my family - for kids or smaller appetites, 8 bowls would have been fine.

I will make these again unless I find a recipe with a slightly softer crust.

I don't think I let them rise long enough...  My house is typically very chilly as of late(I'm pregnant) so the loaves didn't rise enough to use them as a bread bowl.  Maybe I'll try this recipe again later, when the house is warmer.  The bread tasted good but it was very dense...

i was very impressed with this recipe. i've only made bread a couple of times, and this was SO EASY!  i just made them this morning for the first time, and my family LOVED them.  it tastes just like at a nice restaurant!  i did add a tablespoon of sugar to the yeast and water, and i made four big bowls.  i served "potato leek soup I" in them, from this site, and it was a hit! i will make this over and over again!

This is a great recipe!  I'm making it this weekend for the third time for a ski trip and filling with stew.  I tried a couple without the egg wash and they do not come out as well...very dull and cracked.  These are best hot out of the oven but can be saved for leftovers too!  Thanks - Fantastic!!

These turned out great!  They were perfect for chili.  I, too, added about 1 Tbsp. of sugar.  Also, because my yeast was a little past its prime, I used 3 packets instead of two.  I had no problem with them being flat.  From some of the reviews, it seems as if some are trying to making the dough bowl-shaped before baking.  That's not how bread bowls work!  You have to cut off the tops and scoop out the bread inside (and save it for bread pudding!).

First time that I've made bread bowls and they turned out wonderful. I took the advice in another persons review and added 1T. of sugar to the dough, and I only brushed the tops with water before placing in the oven. Next time I will only make four bowls instead of eight.

Great recipe.  This bread recipe was not only easy to make but the bread is VERY tasty!  Some bowls tended to be a little flat but still worked great for a soup bowls.  The girls LOVED them at our last ladies night - soup and salad - YUM!

easy to make.  I just put everything in the bread machine.  But this is way too much bread for my liking.  I made two big ones, big mistake, they were way to big. 4 small ones would have been better.
It is a good recipe but just not for my family, you realy have to like bread a lot to eat this.

I was really looking forward to a good recipe, but these bowls are much too small and too flat for a good bowl of soup. I followed the recipe to a T.  Still searching for a good bread bowl...

yummy, but a little crunchy.  The bread was beautiful looking, but slightly dense, even though it rose well.  I'll try again.

Very tasty, but rather flat. I noticed others said that, too, and I've made quite a bit of bread (with just as many flops as successes!), but how can you remedy this flatness? Otherwise, this was an easy, fun recipe. I added Italian Seasoning when I added the flour. My kitchen aid dough hook made this recipe even easier, too.

Very good.  We ate homemade cheesy potato soup in these bread bowls and they were great.

I tried the tip of having the dough rise the second time in bowls but it still kinda flattened out.  Just a little though, they were still round enough to use, just not a HUGE bowl.  Great for kids.  I'm proud of my first try with yeast bread, and will definently be making these again.  They were golden the first time I pulled them out for the egg wash so the second time I only had them bake for about five to ten minutes.  That was more than enough...

These bread bowls are awesome!!  They are the perfect consistency to hold stew.  They didn't get mushy or leak!  The inside was fluffy and tasted great with the stew.  Next time I will make 4 big bowls, instead of 8 small ones.

The bread bowls turned out perfect!  They were crispy on the outside and tender in the center.  I am a beginner at bread making, but these were easy and delicious.  My family can hardly wait to have them again!

At first I thought the bowls were going to be too small. When I put the soup in and got done eating, wow! I love anything in a bread bowl from cilli to alfredo to potato soup. Yumm!!!

My family loved this recipe.  My husband and I had a house fire in July and we live with my in-laws.  There are 10 people in our house and everyone of them loved the bread bowls and begged me to make more.  Thank you for your yummy recipe.

I followed the recipe but I made my loaves a little larger. I should have given them a little longer in the oven but that didn't change the fact that they were delicious. The egg wash gave them a perfect crust. This worked well as a bread bowl but are on the small side.

I'm making them again!  Need I say more?  Make sure to measure your flour properly by spooning into the cup and then leveling with a knife, don't tap the cup or scoop with it as it will put too much flour into the recipe.

Ok so used a kitchen aid with dough hook. I added flour in half cup intervals after the first 4?until it was clinging too the hook and not the sides took it out dusted kneaded it a few times put in big bowl in my oven on the proofing setting. I know I didn’t use 7 cups of flour. I also added sugar to the yeast as others have said. Now listen I am cooking at 14k feet. So yeah lol also added old bay garlic seasoning to egg wash. Only washed half way through. They spread some LoL but not a lot. Oh and taking my time in the cooking when time was up turned oven to warm didn’t care if it dried out I was adding broccoli cheese soup to it when I got done :-)

Very good recipe!  Easy to follow, not many ingredients, versatile.  It’s titles Italian, but I put chili inside.  Because there are three in my household, I cut the ingredients in half & made three large bowls.  They baked perfectly at the same time & temp.

Made this to use with Italian sausage-tortellini soup.  It turned out fantastic. I used the bread hook on the KitchenAid to knead.  I only divided into 4 sections so I would have bigger bowls.  Using the recipe as is provided good bowls without the need for other tricks.

This was a good hearty bread to use for bread bowls. I heeded the advice of previous reviewers and did not make discs. I actually have 4" spring form pans that I greased and sprinkled with cornmeal Once the dough went through the first rise, I divided into 4, rolled into balls and placed them in the pans for the 2nd rise. Came out beautiful, smelling fantastic and came out of the pans without a single issue. I had made shrimp etouffee and the bowls did fantastic with this. Will be making again!

This recipe was awful. Bread looks nothing like the photo. Based on other reviews, I made 6 instead of 8 and added garlic powder in the dough and on top while baking. They rose to the size of ciabatta rolls at best, flavorless, doughy.

I bake all types of breads and doughs, this recipe should be avoided at all costs.

The whole family loved these!!! I did take the advice of some other reviews and made six bowls instead of 8 and they were the perfect size, also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I only had one bowl that was a little flatter than the rest, so that's a win in my book, considering I've never even attempted to make bread. The only problem I had that I didn't see others had, was having to add a few teaspoons of water to the dough as it mixed. Next time I think I'll just stick with doing that instead of adjusting the amount of flour.

Very easy to follow, so good! I added about a tablespoon of sugar to the warm water/ yeast mixture. I made into 6 bowls instead of 8 so I increased the second bake to 20 minutes instead of 15, it was perfect. I did not use cornmeal on the pan.

They were ok.  I added a little garlic powder and sugar to the yeast but they still didn't have much flavor.  The texture was nice though.

My family loves these bread bowls with thick soups and stews. Our favorite dish to pair with them is the "Delicious Ham and Potato Soup" from this site made with leftover ham from the "Always Juicy Baked Ham," also from this site. I add a little sugar to help the yeast along, then make the dough in my bread machine and let it go through the first rise to simplify the process. The bread bowls always turn out tough enough to stand up to a second helping of soup. They have a crisp, crunchy crust and are soft and chewy inside. I butter the tops instead of using an egg wash, which I think adds a nice flavor. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made it as described . The bread does not brown based on this recipe.  The last 4 minutes I turned on broiler (inside my oven) and they came out nice and golden. 

The bread is heavy.  Soft inside crusty on the outside.  It went well with my beef bourguignon.

Easy Peasy, this second attempt I added Italian Spices and some Butter beads to flavor it up!  Yum, with homemade Vegetable Beef Stew!  Yum.  I love how AllRecipes makes it all so available, easy, and possible.  EABenites

Fantastic bread bowls! I made a half batch and got 4 perfect serving sized bowls. I used a mix of all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, and flax meal just because I like a more multi-grain style bread; and also added in a touch of honey for flavor.  This was a perfect match for butternut squash soup on a cool Fall day! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe. I like to add my own spin with cheeses and different herbs. Im confused on why so many reviews are using bowls to shape the bread though. That seems like alot of work and mess imo when all you need do is make round loafs and core out a wide cone shape, fill and place top back on or on the side for dipping.

Never made bread bowls. This recipe made it easy. Turned out great for me. Only thing I had to do differently is the egg was. I ended up using the yolk also because when I was seperaating the whites, my yolk broke and got in the whites. Instead of wasting the egg, I used it. No rob,em. Got a nice crusty loaf. I recommend this recipe

Excellent. Crispy on the outside, super soft and fluffy in the middle. I took some pointers from other reviews and added garlic powder and onion powder to the dough. Semolina instead of cornmeal because I prefer the finer texture. Due to timing I made the dough a day ahead so it went straight out of the kitchen aid into an oiled XL ziplock and into the fridge. Much to my surprise it rose rapidly. The next day I divided into 6 sections and I think these are pretty substantial but not excessively large. Covered in Saran Wrap and placed in a slightly warm oven to rise. I let them rise for at least an hour. I added garlic powder, oregano, and dried parsley to the egg wash and baked according to instruction. 
***anyone who is getting dense bread***
Be patient! Make sure your yeast activated. If not, just stop there and don’t waste your time and your food, start over with better/fresher yeast or check your water temp. Also, LET IT RISE!! You want it to rise so aaaaall those air bubbles blow up that dough : ) 
Next time I think I will cover the dough in egg wash before covering with Saran Wrap because I noticed my dough fell a bit after I brushed it. I could have taken my own advice and let it rise more but it’s late at night and I’m ready for bread (that was the best Freudian slip ever- I meant bed). TL;DR add more salt and let your dough rise rise rise.

This bread was delicious and perfectly textured. As in other reviews, I would recommend baking in a bowl for a better bowl shape.

Wow! I really wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do this, but I did. I am SO proud of myself for pulling this off. After reading some reviews, I added some herbs for flavor and loved it. I think the bread would be good without this addition but we like that extra taste.  This is how I made them. I substituted garlic salt for the regular salt. For the other change I added italian seasoning during the egg wash while baking. The hardest part was of course kneading the dough, but I got a good arm workout! I made 6 bowls and actually put the dough in ramkins to bake to make sure they rose instead of spreading. I made a bowl out of aluminum foil for one of the bread bowls and it was also good height, probably the best size of them all. I think I will use the aluminum foil the next time. I also will go with 8 bowls the next time as we like to eat the remaining bread and with the amount of bread with just 6 bowls was too much to finish. I baked them for the full 30 minutes and the inside was perfect, not doughy or dried out. I did throw aluminum foil over the top of the bread bowls the last 5 minutes as I was afraid they would get too brown. I cutout and pulled the center out and used homemade potato soup to fill. Everyone loved the meal. I still am a little surprised I did this. I would just have to say if you are on the fence about trying this bread recipe...go for it. I'm not an experienced bread baker at all. I have used a bread machine in the past. You might surprise yours

So it took me 3 times to make this. It was my first (second and third lol) time to ever make Homade bread. Thanks to all the tips the third time was a charm. Really adding the sugar helped the third time. I also took the suggestion of adding garlic to the flour. And garlic and oregegano to the top and It was yummy. I did it on six. Only thing is even with six it doesn't hold much soup. So next time I'm going for 4 or 5. Thanks..

I would love to make these bread bowls the same as many other I imagine. However this will be something of a challenge to everyone who does not want to watch the video as the written ingredients and instructions leave out a very important thing. The amount of warm water to be use for the dough it's self.

These were awesome!! The only change I made was I made 4 smaller bowls and three larger. Eight bowls would have been just right. I will definitely make again. The recipe was easy and the bowls rose nicely.

I was fortunate enough to once work at a culinary school, specifically in the baking department.  I spent a year learning from great bakers, who shared their recipes with me. I would go home and try to replicate what I saw the students doing in class.  It was a great experience and free education!  Recently, I decided to make homemade soup and mini bread bowls for a work potluck.  I decided to make one batch using the Italian Bread recipe that I got from one of the bakers at my former job, and the second batch was this recipe.  I  read a review that this recipe is bland, but it also received many positive reviews so I decided to try it.  I added garlic to the dough just in case it did turn out too bland.   I really had high hopes, but this recipe fell short for me.  I know I did everything correctly, but the finished product did not taste good.  Even the garlic could not help its flavor.  I decided not to serve the second batch because I didn't want people telling me that it was good to my face when I knew it really was not.

This was good! The only change I made, I had a water based soup cooking so I decided after reading they may be a bit bland I used the broth from the soup instead of the water to mix with the yeast. At 110 degrees just like the water would have been. Turned out great! Excellent recipe!

Substituted half (3.5 cups) wholegrain flour and let rise about  90 min to compensate for flour weight and maintain extra hearty fluffiness. Added basil, oregano, and minced garlic into the pre-kneaded dough while mixing for full herb flavor, as well as a tsp of sugar for the yeast premix. Great every time!!

I halved the recipe although added the full amount of salt since many had said it was bland. After the first rise, I separated the dough into 4 individual oven safe soup crocks. After they rose about 30 minutes I popped everything in the oven, skipping the first egg wash so not to disturb the risen dough. I brushed them with egg wash after about 20 minutes. They came out perfect, high round rolls that when hollowed out made great soup bowls. See picture. Delicious.

Simple to make. 
Added Italian herb mix for flavor. 
For some reason, the dough balls flattened out after putting the egg wash on the first time so they ended up rather flat but we're rather good. Everyone loved them with the pork green chili stew I made. 
Gonna play with this and see if I can get it to work right.

Turned out great, was able to eat with whatever soup we had. 
These lasted a long time in the fridge. I imagine they would freeze well too.

These were very good, nice and crusty on the outside with a nice soft crumb.  I also made six larger bowls and was very careful to shape them into nice tight balls for the second rise.  They fit pretty well on a half sheet pan, only barely touching after rising.  I was worried they would flatten out but that did not happen.  They turned out perfect and were delicious with beef stew.

I give it 5 stars because I'd never done anything like this before, and following the directions as written was a success. I will say, it was quite a challenge on my part when it came to using the electric mixer. The Dough kept climbing up the beaters, almost forming like a funnel, and pulling my beaters out. I had to keep removing the packed dough so I could put the beaters back on in order to keep adding my flour. Dough and flour flying in different directions. I found it quite amusing and glad I wasn't on video. My kitchen was a disaster, lol. I made 6 vs 8. They only held one ladle of chile, but very filling. My husband really enjoyed it, and that's what counts.

I added 2 TBS of Sugar to the recipe and used Olive Oil in lieu of vegetable oil... I also used rapid rise yeast, so only had to rise one time.  Great bread inside and crust on the outter side... will be perfect for bread bowls... or any use to be quite honest!

Excellent recipe, split into 6 bowls, added 1Tbsp Sugar, 1Tbsp shallots, 1Tbsp oregano and turned out great. A bit flat for soup though.

The submitter calls these "cute little bread bowls" and isn't lying!  They are tiny.  Next time I'll cut them into 6 portions instead of 8 because I found them to be too small to serve soup in to adults.  Otherwise, this is an excellent recipe!

I am making these again! Going to make broccoli and cheese soup and put it into these. As others have stated I also make only 6 bowls out of this recipe. Does anyone know how they are if frozen for a few weeks?

I used a mix of wheat flour and bread flour and added about a tablespoon of honey to the yeast and warm water to help it bloom...and I used a full egg for my egg wash instead of egg white. The hot pan of water in the oven with my dough helped it rise, and my bread bowls were a bit rounder because I tuck-rolled the balls of dough like you would do with pizza. Not sure if that's a good technique for bread, but it kept it round! Nice and chewy, crusty on top, and soft and chewy on the inside. Made half the recipe for 4 small bowls, which is a good amount of bread to have with soup. Will make again!  Didn't take off any stars because I think the recipe would be great as is. My edits were very minor and unnecessary.

Best bread bowls ever! This recipe is SOOO simple even beginners can get it, add their own flavors to tailor the bowls to their food. (Garlic oil instead of regular cooking oil is my favorite with 2 tbsp Italian seasoning) but anywho, back to business. The recipe is great and no sense fussing over a big recipe or one that makes small bowls, literally just cut the dough into larger pieces, like 4 or 6 mounds instead of 8 if you plan to use this as the main starch/grain of your meal. Use smaller bowls (more cuts in the dough)  for starchy soups like potato or bean soup, or have your cake and eat it too by doing BOTH!  It's really not hard and is such a great foundation recipe that I made sure this was one of the first bread recipes I taught my now 10 year old daughter... 4th grader/aspiring chef and she makes the best breads with this recipe. Thank you so much for making it available!!

Well they are in the oven I made a couple changes.
1. Didn't use cornmeal didn't want the grittyness.

2. I added garlic powder 2 tablespoons.

They smell great I broke them into 4 bowls per batch ( I made 2 batches) these bowls are destined to be fluffy as they rose ALOT. Going to put chili or chicken Alfredo in them.

This is probably my 10th attempt at making yeast bread in my 35 years...... And FINALLY it worked! This recipe is SO simple! My boyfriend and I were so excited to see it rising (my biggest point of failure), and when they came out of the oven, we were burning our fingers to try and get a taste! Definitely will be making this again!! I can't knock off any stars because of my novice skills, but there are some changes I'll make next time. I did add sugar to the yeast and water while proofing, didn't affect the flavor of the bread. Next time I'll use half the recipe, as we ended up with WAY too much. Plus, my stand mixer was really straining at 7 cups of flour. The texture was a bit dense but we filled these with French Onion soup, so it was perfect. The crust was a-MAZ-ing!!! I was really REALLY impressed! Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was very easy to make and I'm glad I chose to follow recipe instead of making 8 like other reviews stated. I think six would be too big. My family loved them though and I will make these again but maybe add sugar next time. Also the reviews that say to let rise in the oven with a bowl of boiled water in the oven were very helpful because the cold climate I live in my house is normally only at 60 degrees F not ideal for letting dough rise.

I placed all my ingredients in my bread machine in order taht I would normally put them into the bread machine with the yeast being last to go in. Set it for dough cycle when finished I put dough on floured surface and cut into 6 shapes that I formed into balls. I then placed in my convection Microwave to proof they grew so big it was awesome! After about an hour and a half I proceeded to bake them for about 20 minutes or so. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I felt the bread needed more flavor so next time I will attempt to add in seasonings for extra flavor of the bread.

This was my first time making  bread bowls and they turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly, except I allowed the bread to rise a little longer. I have a cold home and it took a little longer to rise. I also added the garlic and oregano to the dough prior to mixing which was a great addition. I will definitely make these again. I also made 1/2 the recipe for 2 large bowls (similar to the ones you can buy at the store).

These were fantastic! My stand mixer had a little trouble with the dough after adding all 7 cups of flour (in fact, the dough looked so good after 5 cups I had a hard time adding more), but glad I followed the recipe. 

Changes I made: 

~~I added 1 tsp of sugar with the yeast, to help the yeast proof more quickly and completely. Since I buy bulk yeast and keep it refrigerated, I find that sometimes it has trouble proofing without that extra boost. The sugar could not be tasted in the bread.

~~I added a bit of garlic powder (maybe 1/8-1/4 tsp?) and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning to the dough once it was incorporated. When I make this again, I will add it at the beginning with the original 4 cups of flour just to make it easier to incorporate evenly, as the dough is VERY solid once it is done. 

~~When adding the egg wash, I added another sprinkle of garlic powder and italian seasoning each time, to give it an extra burst of flavor. I filled these with beef stew, and the added spices were perfect! But my husband was mad because he wanted to dip his leftovers into coffee and they were too garlicky. 

~~I did not hand knead the dough, instead using a stand mixer with a dough hook, although I think I will when I make them again; as I mentioned, my stand mixer had trouble kneading the final product. 

~~I made 6 bowls instead of 8.

Definitely will be making these again!

Wonderful recipe.
I made only a few small changes to the recipe, and the bowls were fantastic.

I dissolved 2 tablespoons of sugar along with the yeast in the warm water, I used bread floor instead of all purpose flour, and finally I added 4 tablespoons of enriched powdered milk to the dry ingredients. I ended up using only 6 cups of flour, but that's most likely due to where I live, and nothing to do with the recipe.

The bread bowls were simply wonderful. I used then to serve potato soup, and they stayed soft yet firm, and amazingly tasty all the way until the end. I made only 4 bowls because I wanted to serve hearty portions of soup, and I'm very happy that I did make only 4. I'll definitely be making these again.

I love the taste and texture, was a bit disappointed that mine didn't turn out so round, they were a bit flat, but not too dense. Next time I will take the advice of one commenter and bake them in ceramic bowl, and freeze the ones I don't need immediately and bake them fresh. I added some fresh garlic to the dough and it added a great flavor.
I plan to use the filling to make croutons.

I cut the recipe in half  due to only having 4 people to feed. I am not sure why everyone is saying the size of the bowls is too small, because mine turned out huge. They were like buying a round loaf at a store. The flavor was good and worked great for stew.  There was so much bread everyone was full really quick.

Bread came out perfect! The recipe was very easy to follow and turned out exactly how the recipe shows. It was a huge hit with my family! They went nuts over it--we put potato soup inside and it was a perfect combo. Loved it!

My first time ever making bread bowls and it was super easy! I followed the instructions exactly and it came out wonderful but next time I think I'll try adding some granulated garlic and oregano to jazz it up a bit! Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe! I always make these when I'm making a soup, just awesome. I do agree with the suggestions of making six bowls instead of eight and to add a little sugar to the yeast/warm water mix to help get the yeast going.  I also don't really use the egg wash anymore and the bread is still nice and crispy on the outside, just less browned. Decided to leave it out because I always have a good amount of egg wash left (plus the egg yolk) and I don't like the unnecessary waste. Either way, this is a very adaptable recipe that is a staple in my kitchen!

I really enjoyed this recipe, served it with potato soup, my own special recipe. Company loved it every bit as much as I did.

Won't make these again. I made 6, which was the right size for us. They seemed pretty tasteless for some reason. Biggest problem I had was how "stale" they were on Day 2, even after being kept in a plastic bread bag over night. Can't imagine how bad the 2 in the freezer will be. Will have to make toast out of those, I  think.

this is a great basic recipe that can be seasoned to your own liking.   I made half the recipe.  They came out awesome!  Will definitely be making them on a regular basis.  It cracks me up when people mention that they are too time consuming.  The active work on this is minimal.  The end result is amazing!  :)

Great base recipe! I added about 2 tsp of granulated garlic and 2 tsp of dried rosemary. Served with broccoli cheese soup, great match.

It's a reasonably simple recipe for very basic bread bowls, but this doesn't even come close to making 8 reasonable bowls. I cut it down to 6, as other reviewers suggested, but even then they felt too small to be useful for a dish like soup. If I try the recipe again I wouldn't make more than 4 bowls out of it.

I was very disappointed.  I wanted a nice bowl as depicted in the photo.  What I got was a flat piece of uneatable bread.  I followed the directions exactly and it was a mess.  My yeast was new, the water was 115* the flour was good, everything was ok until the division into separate balls. I'll be looking elsewhere.  sorry it was very bad.

Super easy.  Made the dough in my bread machine.  Proofed the yeast first in sugar water, added the rest of the ingredients (used bread flour) and started the dough cycle.  After my dough was kneaded, I removed it and let it rise in the oven with the light on with a steaming bowl of water on the bottom rack.  After first rise I followed the rest of the instructions, but omitted the first egg wash.  I spent maybe 15 minutes of time prepping these, not time consuming whatsoever!  Great recipe!

I made this in my bread machine on the dough setting. I added a tbsp of brown sugar also. I took it out of the bread machine and punched it down and put it on a floured surface. I just smoothed it out and divided. I made the balls and let them rise for 40 mins. I only did one egg wash and put in yhe oven for 25 mins with a pan of ice and water below it. I covered them with foil after 15 mins because they the crust was brown already. They came out perfect!

These are wonderful! They are great with Broccoli Cheddar Soup! I could not get 7 cups of flour to mix in evenly, so I ended up only using 6. I gave myself a concussion making them, so take care when kneading the dough!

This was a big hit with my family filled with some broccoli cheese soup!  I did make to minor changes, I added a 1 tsp of sugar to help activate the yeast and substituted Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the vegetable oil (just a personal preference). Aside from that I followed the instructions exactly and the bowls came out perfect!

Completely in love with this bread bowl, it was perfect and everyone at home enjoyed it. I replaced egg wash with milk wash as we don't eat egg and replaced corn meal with parchment paper.

Great Recipe! One Suggestion for those trying this recipe out for the first time however is to hold the Egg White Finish until the bowls have firmed in the Oven, (around 15 minutes in) otherwise its easy to have your proofed dough fall.

I made the recipe the first time as is except for making 1/2 a recipe since I'm the only that eats soup in my house.  The first time the outside wasn't quite as crisp as I wanted so while the oven was cooling I left the rolls in.  Really enjoyed these perfect little bowls!

Unbelievably delicious, and exactly better than any paneria.  My family and guests raved. I agree with the tablespoon sugar into the yeast mix and also make 7 bowls, not eight. I'm not sure all the cornmeal didn't just drip off with egg-white.  Why not stir in the cornmeal into the egg-white mixture?? Baking it to a crusty brown is the way to go and serve with soup while they are still warm.

Followed the recipe to a T, but they flattened when I baked them in the oven.  They were hard on the outside and still doughy inside.  The egg wash made them brown too quickly and they looked nothing like the picture.  I was really disappointed.  I guess I'll keep looking for that perfect bread bowl recipe.  D:

Not sure what I am doing wrong, I've made this recipe 2 times now, each time my bread bowls do not rise. No clue what I am doing wrong. I made 6 bowls instead of 8 as stated in recipe. Any clue what I am doing wrong?

hmm, I don't know what went wrong. I make all kinds of breads. This recipe went flat on me. NO Bowl for me!! I made 6 instead of 8 but that should not have matter. I added sugar to the water for the yeast and it sat for 10 minutes. Nice and bubbly. It rise nice for a hour and on the pan. No clue what happen.

A little flat which might have been my fault. In the end they still worked great for my super chunky beef stew. The flavor was alright and sort of bland but i didn't experiment with adding extra spices since it was my first time. They were a lot of work but I think I will make them again because they really brought some excitement to our normal dinner routine!

For the effort it took to make them, the flavor was just alright, even though I added a few Italian seasonings into the dough. Outside shell was too crunchy, but held its shape pretty well. Overall satisfied, they made a nice change to our dinner.

Excellent recipe. I always end up using less flour than the recipe calls for and double the salt. Blending the flour into the yeast mix before adding the salt will make sure that you don't kill the yeast. Other than that, excellent!

I scaled by half then divided that into 3 rather than 4.  Baked in tortilla shell pans for a little shape. Brushed with garlic butter instead of  egg wash. First try I added some rosemary, second time I added Parisien Bonnes Herbes.

Made the dough in the breadmaker and then let it sit to rise while the soup cooked.  I served Butternut Squash soup IV from this site in it and my pickiest eater loved it.  He ate all the soup and then devoured the bread too.  It's not a very flavorful dough, but I think that's specifically what it's meant to be.  That allows the flavors in the soup to shine through and also allows that any soup can be served in it.  I may make again for chili!

I made these so I could serve "Erins Cheese Broccoli Soup"  (on this site) in them.My family loved the bread bowls, I did sprinkle with granulated garlic and dried italian seasoning after I did the first eggwash. Personally I thought that the insideof "bowl" was just a little bit bland, but overall it did the job. I will make these agiain to serve soup/chili in. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Loved it!!!! Made homemade chilly with it and it turned out GRRRREAT!!!!... The only thing I changed was I added a tablespoon of sugar to proof the yeast, and I did not have the cornmeal, so I did not use it. With these two changes it was still really gooood!!!!

First time making bread, and it was a two-thumbs up success! My kids loved it! They had one cracked open eating it before the soup was done. Thank you so much.

I should've listened to the other comments that said to make 6 instead of eight... they were tasty but very small.

I save and freeze the bread that I hollow out from the centers, and use it to make breakfast casseroles.  That way, there's no waste!  These bowls are delicious, and come together easily.  A nice way to dress-up soup!

I used white wheat and some gluten instead of all purpose flour. And after reading other reviews I added a teaspoon of adobo and 1 tablespoon of sugar. But the amounts of the rest and times were spot on. I did mix it all in my kitchenaid and didn't knead it by hand at all. I think 8 is the perfect number so they aren't too big.

So easy using the bread machine to make the dough.  I halved the recipe so it would fit in the machine.  I proofed the yeast with 1 TBS of sugar first and then added the rest of the ingredients, along with 1 tsp of garlic powder and some dried basil.  I did not have cornmeal, so I sprinkled some seasoned salt and onion powder on top.  I skipped the first egg wash as it will only make the bread flop by touching it.  It is best to just leave them alone.  I don´t know why other reviews stated that making 8 bowls made them very small.  I thought they were perfectly sized and would not make them any larger.  I have made several batches and they look great.  Hold soup well and I will be making these again for sure.

Bread can be tricky to make but if you follow the instuctions you shouldn't have any problems. This recipe was very helpful and it turned out great. I followed another reviewers tip and let the bread rise in the oven with a pot of boiling water, that worked like a charm. If you have a kitchenaid stand mixer this recipe is a breeze. The bread turned out great and made perfect bowls! I will definitley be using this as my go to bread bowl recipe.

My bowls completely flattened out. Next time I will omit the first egg wash since this seemed to deflate them a tad.

Very good soup bread! It spread out some when baking and wasn't as tall as I would have liked so I'm going to try baking in oven safe bowls of some type instead of on a cookie sheet next time to try to get a higher bread bowl. Great texture, thick hearty bread. Added garlic powder to batter and on the outside.

A great and easy to make recipe! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 unbleached white flour. I also added 2 T honey to the water and yeast, and 1 egg to the dough. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe! I just did a few things different. I used canola oil instead of veg. oil, and I made 6 bowls instead of 8. I also added garlic and onion powder and italian seasoning into my egg and spread it ontop to give the crust some flavor. But these were a big hit and I will be making these alot. The directions were very easy to understand, which is great cause this was my first time ever making bread of any kind...thank you for this recipe!

These are awesome bread bowls! I am not a fan of sourdough bread, and this was just what I was looking for. They were AMAZING fresh out of the oven!  I halved the recipe but otherwise MADE JUST AS THE RECIPE STATES! This is 5 stars for the recipe with NO ALTERATIONS!  YUMMY YUMMY! Note: they look a tad small if halve it and make 4 bowls, but trust me once they bake and you add your soup, its more than enough!!! PERFECT!

These were fantastic.  I have tried several different bread bowl recipes and this is the only one that worked for me.  I added a little sugar to the yeast to help if proof and didn't exactly measure the flour, I just added it until it felt right however, these came out wonderfully!    They are a little small so I made 4 instead of 8 but I can't complain!  Also, I only did the second egg wash and not the first.  No one believed that I made these and didn't buy them at the local bakery!

I really want to give these three and a half stars, but I'll go with four.  These made good loaves, but mine fell flat.  I tried to be gentle when putting on the egg wash, but they flattened anyway.  Next time I'll just put the wash on after the first fifteen minutes and skip the first wash.  The taste of the bread was good, but not with soup.  It would've made a nice dinner roll to go with barbeque or something.  I filled mine with the creamy chicken and wild rice recipe found on this site.

I've made these a few times. The first time I realized that corn meal and egg white are a mess, so now I just bake on a silpat mat and brush with a light egg white wash. I dont care for the flavor of the bread, but the texture of the crust is good for cleaning out the "bowls" and for holding soup. I'll keep using this one until I find something better.

These made me look brilliant...even though I goofed and only put 2 packages of yeast, they came up beautifully!  I added a pinch of sugar to the yeast, so maybe that helped.  The bottoms got a little bit too hard, I'd cut back a few minutes of cook time next time.  Also, I didn't use these as big bread bowls.  I cut it into 12 pieces and made individual dinner rolls to go with my thinner soup.  Perfect and so EASY!

These are perfect! I halved the recipe and made 3 bread bowls. They were the perfect size and tasted great...and so easy too! I will make these every time I make soup now. Tonight it was clam chowder...yum :)

Only giving 4 stars as bread bowls spread out to much so they were too flat. I proofed the yeast first and the yeast was excellent active yeast. Liquid temp was checked with thermometer ( not too hot, not too cold), used bread flour and formed each bowl into nice round balls before placing on cookie sheet sprinkled well with corn meal. These loaves did double but as I stated they spread too much out instead of high.

I have tried many bread bowl recipes and this was by far the best!  The easiest to work with (used the bread machine) and shape.  Chewy, dense inside and a shiny crispy outside...I filled with pasta (in an attempt to copy dominos!)  Will definitely use again

I have made these twice now and they went flat both times.  The first time I let it rise for 1 1/2 hours, the second time 1 hour.  It was better the second time, but still not nice and round.  I will try 35 minutes next time.  I added 1 tsp of sugar as others suggested.  Both times I forgot the cornmeal.  I am not sure if this made a difference.  They tasted  good.

followed all the tips, from skipping the first egg wash, to adding some sugar to help the yeast out. Was good, next time will make 4 or 5 instead of 8, as they were smaller than I thought after rising. I added some oregano, and I think they would have been better without it...will make again, after I get a standing mixer. Used a hand one, and practically had smoke coming out, the dough was too thick for it.

I think it was user error, I made these, they tasted fine. I put oregano and garlic pwdr on top and let them rise in the oven with the steaming water. It was fairly time consuming but they turned out to be more like Frisbees. I was pretty disappointed.

These turned out pretty good. A couple of tips though: They need all the salt and all the oil that it calls for, if not a tad more. Anything with flavor, including Italian herbs helps too. I put a couple tablespoons of an Italian spice mix (that also had salt in it) and they tasted good. I too made my dough in a bread machine, however, due to the size, I didn't let it rise in the machine. Just took it out and put it in a big greased bowl. Another tip,  when shaping the loaves they need to be narrow and tall and I found that the damp towel I was using to cover them during the second rise kind of squished them and they turned out flat. Might have been better to baste them with a little oil and skip the towel so they could rise higher. But the crust turned out nice and crisp and the inside was good and chewy.

Wow! Mine came out looking just like the picture.  I did make modifications much like other reviewers:  6 bowls instead of 8, added the tbsp of sugar, italian herb seasoning, garlic salt in place of salt, used olive oil - I am very impressed by how easy these were to make, how beautiful they turned out and how great they taste!  Thanks Kerri.

I did all of the dough prep in the bread machine on dough cycle (though as per other reviewers I added some sugar to help the yeast, as well as some dried basil and granulated garlic to add some flavor), which made this very easy. I cut the recipe in half to fit in the breadmaker, as I was planning on making 4 bread bowls. My main problem was, of course, the size these turned out. I knew from reading reviews that these would be on the small side, but I didn't realize that they would be WAY to small to use as bread bowls for soup - they turned out about 3.5 inches in diameter. I had planned on serving Irish stew in bread bowls (it was for a St. Paddy's day dinner), but I ended up serving Irish stew with bread balls on the side. ;) Good flavor and texture, though, so I'll try again and just cut the serving size in half to get larger bowls.

I've made these three times - with Spicy Corn Chowder, Chunky Potato Soup and the last time with my own Indian creation.  Delicious!  We always add one or two teaspoons of sugar to dissolve the yeast with because this helps get that nice fluffy rise.  It is very plain, but we like it that way since we always eat it with a flavorful soup.

This was really good and easy to make.  I gave it 4 stars because I added sugar to get the yeast foamy.  They are really good with soup or plain.

Beautiful dough, although spread too much while rising and came out rather flat. BTW 8 were the perfect size 6 would have been too large.

I will try these again,I made 8 of them. Next time I will diffently make 6?. Right now they look like large sandwich rolls. I used butter, cornmeal, and cracked pepper. I did use them for chili bowl,[small ones] I just put it in a bowl large enough for more chili to go around bowl.

Fantastic! After a poor experience with another bread recipe, I was nervous whether I could make this turn out. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle some Italian seasoning on when I did the egg wash. It was perfect on the first try. No need to look for another bread bowl recipe. Thank you!!!

these turned out really well, although could use a little tweaking. The texture and appearance were perfect. My only issue was lack of flavor. I will mess around with seasoning next time. Also, I made 4 and served with cream of broccoli.

Some recipes are worth tweaking if they have potential, but this is not one of them.  Not only do they bake up flat, but they are positively TASTELESS.  If you don't mind wasting your time and good ingredients, then this recipe is for you.  I personally will not make again.

These were ok.  Mine came out flat like some of the other reviews said.  They would have also been very bland, but I added italian seasonings to the dough and garlic on top with the egg wash.

Just served these with beef stew last night. Was very good! My husband said it was better bread than he's had in most restaurants and our dinner guests took their extra bread home. I made the recipe as is, except in 4 loaves instead of 8. Next time I'd like to experiment with whole wheat flour.

This was a great recipe, everything it promised to be. Both my husband and I ate too much because we wanted to finish the whole bread bowl. I made six instead of eight and thought they were a really good size. We ate them with a potato and corn chowder. My 8 month old daughter really liked the soft warm bread on the inside of the bowls!

These were awesome for a good thick chili!  I used olive oil and also changed the salt to a garlic salt with parsley flakes for a little extra twist.  I'm sure my husband will expect these with his chili every time!!

I followed the recipe exactly (only added a few herbs to the dough) and my bowls weren't really bowls, they were huge flat loaves. They were good, but they were flat. So I don't know if I missed something but I think I'll try the oven-safe bowl method next time to give them a nice big round shape.

these were good - i cut the recipe in half and got 2 decent sized bowls and one mini bowl (for my 4 yr. old) at first i too thought they were too small but actually were just perfect cuz we were so stuffed from the soup (restaurant quality baked potato soup from this site)that most of the bowl went in the garbage anyways!
will make again - but only on the weekend as the bread is a little time consuming with all the rising it has to do....

I tried these today with soup. I baked them as directed, but I did add a bit of garlic to the egg wash and I only divided the dough into six pieces. 

They look really, really cute when you take them out of the oven. I had no trouble baking them. They didn't turn out flat or anything, and the crust was great.

They're just too bland though. They're certainly not comparable to the Italian bread I've grown up with. They take a lot of time and planning, and I just don't think they're worth it.

I might try to make bread bowls with a different bread recipe. I think guests would think they're adorable. ^^

Nice taste but not as round and high as I hoped for. Next time I will either put them in a pyrex bowl or try the foil trick someone else posted.

I cut this recipe in half, because I read reviews of this comming out flat, and I'm glad I did.
 The bread itself tastes fine and would be great with a soup or stew, but mine, like so many other reviewers came out as flat blobs.
 Does anyone have a solution to this?

Wow made this recipe exactly as called for and yet I got flat bread rolls not bowls.  Bread was okay not really tasty enough for me.  Although the boys liked it but they they like any bread hot out of the oven.

A very easy bread recipe with surprisingly no sugar.  I had very large loaves considering my home is 62 degrees. I added garlic for a little touch.

Perfect Italian bread taste.  Went very well with thick hearty lentil soup.  I will make these again.

Ok.  Good for entertaining, but overall not too impressive in taste and still a lot of work.  I got 6, not 8, but they may have been big.

This is the first time that I have ever worked with yeast bread.  I followed the directions exactly, but, somehow, they didn't turn out quite right!  I'm assuming it was the cook's error and not the recipe.  My bread bowls ended up rather flat.  Since we couldn't use them as bread bowls, we just dipped them into our soup.  The bread alone didn't have much flavor.

I just made these today to put potatoe soup in them.  First, I did add some italian seasoning to the dough, and then I had problems after the second rising....they came up perfectly, but my towel stuck to them and they fell.  So then I tried the pyrex bowls and they turned out beautifully.  Kinda frustrating at first, but thank God for the reviews to go back to to make adjustments or additions.  I will make them again...learning by trial and error!

These were ok but not outstanding.  I mede the dough in my breadmaker and then formed the dough into bowl shapes for the second rise.  The flavor wasn't bad but the texture was a little tough/dry for my liking.  Great idea, though, and i'll probably use it again :)

These were sooo good.  I only did four and added some italian herbs to the dough before the first rising.  They came out golden and yummy.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I did add sugar to proof the yeast and also baked the bowls in oven proof bowls,  as suggested in reviews.  I will use this often.  Thank you

I added 2 T sugar and they turned out with a really good flavor.  I should have listened and made 8 bowls but I made 4 humongous ones instead.  Next time for sure I'll use 8.  I used inverted dishes to make them round and I think I'll try it without them next time.  Yum!

This was my first attempt at making a bread bowl. I read all the reviews and decided I would make 1/2 inverted over pyrex dishes and 1/2 the way the recipe said. They all turned out good. I did add about 1 tsp. of sugar thinking it might help them rise higher. I don't know if that worked, but these were delicious! The bread is delicious even on it's own. I served chili in them and even my kids kept saying "Mom, these are really good!" Great recipe I will use often.

These were really good, but they were really flat when they came out of the oven.  I may play around with some other recipes, but this will be kept in the file.
