Good good good!!!  This is so versatile and quick!  I love messimg with recipes and this a cake you can do that with.  I made this maple-flavored with maple flavor extract and used brown sugar.  I'm going to try this again different ways, for sure!

This was very good! I love using yogurt, so this recipe peaked my interest. I ended up adding some salt and vanilla, out of habit. Then I took Beth's suggestion and added some orange marmalade, dried cranberries and some ginger. Excellent! Very moist! Thanks!

Well, the first time I tried to make it, I forgot to add eggs!  Needless to say, that version wasn't a success.  But I tried it again, and I'm glad I did.  It was a yummy moist cake that went perfect with our ice cream sundaes.  Will make again; it's a great way to use up yogurt.

Such a great recipe! As a previous reviewer posted - so easy to modify and play with :)  The modifications I made were as follows - 1) I used homemade yogurt, which has the consistency of Greek yogurt 2) Instead of the 1 C of white sugar, I used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar 3) I substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil 4) just as a note - 0.25 oz yeast = 2.5 tsp yeast, which I used. 5) For additional spice, I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, and 1/8 tsp cloves.  For aesthetic appeal, I spiraled honey over the batter (which is quite thick so the honey doesn't sink in or anything), and the finished product had a pretty top :)  Lots of changes, but it turned out great!

The only changes I've made to this recipe is that I've used margarine instead of oil and added 1.5tsp of vanilla. This recipe isn't very specific about how much you should beat the ingredients, which is really important for the texture! Mine came out WAY too dense (didn't beat enough?)... I also used large eggs, and it was WAY too eggy. The sweetness was good just right, not too sweet, but I could still taste the baking powder (I used 1tsp). Overall, the amount of ingredients is right (for 3 small eggs), but this recipe should give more directions than just 'mix everything until combined'. Also, definitely do the variations because it's rather bland, even with the vanilla.

Judging from the recipe as written, it would have been very bland, thus 3 stars. I added cinnamon, vanilla and ground cloves, as well as replaced 1/2 the sugar with packed brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested. I will say that the yeast in this recipe, IMO, serves no purpose because a yeast needs time to activate. 
The next time I make this, I will replace the yeast with 1/2 t. baking soda that will react with the yogurt to create pockets of air and give this recipe it's cakey-ness. :)

I altered the recipe slightly, as well. I used 2 eggs instead of 3, added a little vanilla, used 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of yeast and split the 1/2 cup vegetable into 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup margarine.  I also added the zest of a lemon, and it turned out a wonderfully light lemony dream. To make it into more of a dessert I made a lemon glaze by heating a tablespoon of margarine, a tsp of vanilla and the juice of the lemon I zested over low heat. Then I dumped in a bunch of confectioner's sugar until I got the consistency I wanted.  I can't wait to try other versions of this recipe! Maybe next time I'll add dried cranberries or cherries and almond slivers...

Wow, sooooo yummy and really easy to make!  You really just dump all the ingredients into the pan and bake.  So good, haha.  Altho I didn't really understand the whole 13" round pan, and I just baked it in a 9" round pan, which was definitely big enough.  I also did the cinnamon version, and it was sooo good.  I also added a little more yogurt and less sugar, yum!

My husband and I thought this cake was very nice. Mine came out heavy. Maybe next time I'd sift the flour instead of using it right from the container. I used 1/3 cup dark brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar plus 2 tsp cinnamon. It was good with a glass of cold milk.

Quick and easy - this cake made a delicious and satisfying late-night study snack. The ingredients were simple and there's plenty of room for interpretation. I left off the sugar on top, but added some jam! These would be nice as muffins too.

Added more yoghurt than what was called for after tasting the batter as it didn't seem to have much taste. The cake comes out dense, not your average cake with crumbs, more like.. chunks. I added cinnamon and raisins and I thought it tasted okay but it didn't have a distict flavour so I'd say go with the flavored yoghurt or add fruit preserves or definitely eat it with something like ice cream.

I really liked this--it had a good dense crumb, stayed moist, and one of those styles of cake that should have their own name--like kitchen cake or something.  Not a birthday cake, just something tasty to have with your coffee (but, not a coffee cake).  very good--thanks.

This recipe is perfect for someone on a diet. Just substitute the sugar for splenda, and you have a perfect low cal treat. I made these into mini-bundts so that I could eat mine plain, and those not on a diet can top however they want. Didn't quite get 5 stars because the texture is a touch dense. I will sub the yeast for baking soda as mentioned in step one.

This recipes was a pretty big hit in my house. I didn't have any vegtable oil, so I used Canola and it turned out very well , the flavored yoghurt makes it really nice. I used icing sugar instead of bakers, and it was the perfect addition.

I made  it three times in one month... 
Some varieties that come to my mind is... adding lemon zest, chocolate coating, or maybe making it with swirls of cocoa batter... like marble cake :-)
But these are so far only dreams. have not tried them yet

This is amazing! I used a full 6 oz of blueberry yogurt & added 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp baking soda (in addition to the yeast).  I also added 2Tbl lemon juice. I whisked VERY WELL before pouring into 8x8 pan. Baked 35 min. I glazed with the "Lemon Glazed Date Stick" glaze recipe.  My kids & I devoured it.  I will make again for breakfast & any time I can make up an excuse to :)! Thank u for this scrumptious recipe!

Yum, this was so good. We needed to use up a bunch of yogurt and this did the trick. I found it to be addicting so I can't make it too often!

It tasted OK.  It did come out a little dense.  I used the brown sugar/cinnamon variation.  I think without it, the cake would have been too plain.  I also used Vanilla flavored yogurt which did add some more flavor.  Maybe I will give it another try with the other variations in one of the other reviews.

My only complaint was that it was a little dense.  It has a great flavor, though.  I had it warmed up with berries and a scoop of yogurt on top for breakfast - delicious!

This was a good recipe-very quick and easy to make.  The only thing is that i found that they took a while to bake, and they were a bit plain.  I used fruit yogurt and put them in muffin cups to quicken the cooking time.  Will definitely use this recipe again! :)

Moist and rich, kinda' like a pound cake.
