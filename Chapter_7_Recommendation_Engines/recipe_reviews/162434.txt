I got rave reviews of this.  I filled with romaine lettuce and grape tomatoes tossed with blue cheese dressing.    I tested out making smaller ones using my small pastry/candy sized baking tin (normally I use it for peanut butter cups) and although they didn't make as pronounced of a cup shape, they worked really well and turned into bite sized BLT bowls!  The large ones were difficult to share as well as made for a lot of bacon for one person to eat during a party (only appetizers were set out) and for 15 strips of bacon I only got 5 big cups. I got several little cups from just a few slices so I'll work on perfecting the smaller size next time around. I'm guessing if I wrap around (rather than weave) I could manage smaller cups.

AWESOME!  This is a BLT without the bread.  (You could add croutons).  I made a 6 slice by 6 slice mat on a piece of parchment paper.   Then cut through the paper and bacon with kitchen shears, making 4 bowls.   I flopped the bacon mats on the backside of oven-safe "monkey dishes"  (little ramekins) and peeled off the parchment paper.   I baked it at 350 until it browned (350 so my dishes wouldn't break).  Then I put the mat of bacon inside the dish and back in the oven to get the other side browned.  Be careful, it's hot!  I used "ove gloves".   It took a while and I thought it was a pain, but first bite it was OMG!  So crispy and delicious!  This is 5 stars all the way!!  I will be making these again.  Thank you KoalaFace for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!

So fabulous.  Ok, so your house might smell like bacon, but these are truly wonderful.  I put a little squirt of mayo on the bottom of the cups before i put in the lettuce and tomato.  Also, my bacon generally needs about 20-30 mins to bake.  I take a piece of bacon and cut it in thirds.  Halfs is too bit but sometimes thirds is a bit small to put over the mini muffin tins.  But this size is perfect for one big bite.  I brought it to three different holiday parties and it was the first app to go.  Enjoy!

I made these last year for Thanksgiving. They look really great. I just threw together a regular old salad and tossed with dressing and then placed into bacon bowls at dinnertime. My guest were really impressed.

Made these for SB XLVI...everyone loved them. I didn't use the cheese, and instead of foil, I  used muffin cups. Will make again!

yum!  Made these tonight and put in the Fresh Express apple cheddar salad in each one and served with a  dinner we had with friends.  The combo of the Bacon and Apple and cheese was excellent.  and since it was a quick to put together salad mix I did not mind the time it took to make the bacon baskets at all!

Skipped the cheese and mixed the lettuce and tomato with a little bit of mayonnaise.  Tasted just like a BLT without the bread.  I used a muffin tin turned upside down on a cookie sheet.  It took about 40 minutes for the bacon to get crisp.  I figured that the cookie sheet restricted the heat somewhat therefore taking longer to cook.  It didn't matter they still came out perfect.

I made the mistake of using thick cut bacon so my bowls 
were too shallow.  I put them in cute cupcake liners and 
they worked out great (picture posted)!  Good recipe!

This kind of worked. Some bowls stayed together, some didn't. The bacon shrinks a lot. So it was more of a bite than a bowl, maybe would work as an appetizer. Tasted great .
