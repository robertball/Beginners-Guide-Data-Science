For the flavour I give this 4 stars but for the vague instructions and really 'off' proportions I would give  1 or 2 stars. First the issues with this recipe...where to begin? The amount of rice was too high, as was the sauce. I used 1/4 cup raw brown rice per person and didn't need the reserved sauce.  Next time I'd make half the amount of sauce. Also the instructions to use different pans/skillets was baffling. I just cooked the sausage first, when it was just done I removed it to a plate; used the same skillet for the beans and tomatoes, and when they were just cooked I added the sausage back in and mixed to warm through. Overall the recipe makes a lot too, almost twice the amount  it states (I halved the recipe for three people and have two leftover servings).  I made other changes based on preference and circumstances: I have a rice cooker so used that, used fresh tomatoes; used twice the amount of sausage (tofurkey). The rice/beans seems like it would be really bland but the banana and sauce are there to balance it out. It's really a nice combination. Oh and I accidentally added way too much rum but it was still darn yummy. Maybe I'll do it that way from now on :)
