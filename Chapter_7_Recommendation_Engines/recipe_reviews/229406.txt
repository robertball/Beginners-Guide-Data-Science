I have made these for years, but without the extra cookie underneath.  You can really do a lot with mint oreos/dark chocolate, white chocolate/vanilla oreos, etc.  All great.   

As another reviewer said, cool dough is the best.  I freeze the cookie balls for a few hours before I dip them in chocolate.  It makes it a lot easier.

Definitely not as easy as it sounds. I used both white almond bark and chocolate chips for a big batch. The almond bark melts into a smooth consistency way better than the chips. I refrigerated the balls before covering, however I recommend freezing them. The balls still crumbled and "dirtied" the white melt. I also used toothpicks to remove the balls after rolling them in the melt. This helped a little, as using fingers left bare spots.
If anyone has tips on how to make them as smooth as the pictures above, I'd love to here. They taste great, however I am disappointed with them visually.

I really like the idea of this recipe, just plain cute! I modified it to make it a little more realistically possible.  As other reviewers have said, make sure your dough is very cold.  I also used a double boiler and melted my white chocolate chips and added about an inch of parafin wax just like I do with my buckeye balls. The parafin helps the chocolate set up better. For decorating, I used colored chocolate discs melted in decorator bottles.  It is thicker than the gel and not as messy.  They were adorable!

I tried this recipe and found it extremely difficult to work with the melted chocolate.  I did freeze my dough balls and followed the advice of the recipe reviews. This task is really frustrating and I find it hard to believe it ever ends up looking like the picture displayed on the recipe.

Yummy!  I have made different variations of oreo balls for years.  They always taste awesome!  (dangerous on the scale though!!!)  I apparently make my balls bigger because I tripled the recipe and I still only ended up with about only about 22.  The store didn't have red oreos so I used the green mint ones instead.  I also used vanilla almond bark.  I also was a little generous on the cream cheese because I wanted to make sure they would stick together well.  I did put the snowman faces on them, but they sure don't look as cute as the professional ones.  However, I work with kids so they won't mind at all.  I didn't have problems with making them solid white, but I did put them in the refrigerator for about 30 min before I warmed up my almond bark, and when I made them into balls I rolled them in my hands like play-dough to make sure they were put together well.  These were fun to make and I will most likely do it again before the season is over.

These did not turn out like the picture. They looked like  dirty little ghosts (due to cookie crumbs) I think we will do this for Halloween but not for Christmas.

This recipe is super cute. I make the Oreo ball part with yellow Oreos --tastes like cookie dough but adding the extra cookie under it for me makes it just too sweet. Also difficult to eat.....crumbly.

I must have done something totally wrong because I followed the instructions and the mixture was sticking to my hands like crazy. The chocolate I melted were white chocolate chips (which didn't melt smoothly.) Also when rolling the balls in the chocolate the mixture started to run into the chocolate so, like someone else said, they looked like dirty ghosts. If I ever try to make these again I will chill the mixture so it doesn't stick to me and I will try a different kind of white chocolate.

I had a great time making these. Easy and fun. Took me two tries to get it right. Had a hard time dipping them as I tried to take them out with my fingers, which left bare spots on the sides and ruined the round shape. I then dropped the ball into the melted chocolate and used a spoon to spoon more chocolate over top. Scooped out with the spoon and tilted the spoon forward and back, to drain off the excess chocolate, then carefully wiggled the ball off the spoon onto the cookie.This gave just enough chocolate for the base. I also waited for the chocolate to set a bit and used the back of the spoon to gently tap it on top to get that cute peak in the pictures. I melted white chocolate wafers that you can buy at any bulk store. They melt really easily. Needed to make more filling in order to get enough. I think I will quadruple the recipe next time as they were a big hit!

Several things, I used my food processor to prepare the crushed cookies, and I used blonde Oreos.  I put the balls in the freezer for 20 minutes before rolling them in the melted white chocolate!  No problem with crumbs or any discoloration.  Good luck!

If you really want to make it look like a melting snowman, you could also use the white fudge dipped Oreo's.

OK...seriously...one of my top three favorite cookies of all time!!!!!!!!!!!  The taste is absolutely decadent; out of this world!!  I made them because I thought they were cute; I never expected them to be so delicious.  Great job, Oreo, on making a recipe using your cookies that I would actually make for taste along, not counting how adorable the melting snowmen are!  My only change would be to try refrigerating the cream cheese balls before dipping in the chocolate because mine melted a little in the chocolate, making the white appear a bit "dirty" in places because of the brown chocolate mixing in.  Overall, I am very pleased, though.  THANKS!

I was excited about making this supposedly easy recipe for an office luncheon. Needless to say, I'm going to have to take something else. The chocolate was the hardest thing to work with and I ended up with very dirty looking blobs atop the oreo cookies. Decorating that wasn't exactly cute. I did freeze the filling and that worked well but the chocolate didn't melt well and the filling bled into the chocolate creating dirty looking snow .who wants to eat that. Needless to say, I cannot take these into work and have to make something else. I'm not much of a candy maker and maybe one needed to have more experience doing that. I tried melting white chocolate chips and they didn't get soft enough and then got too hard. So, I tried a doubleboiler and another bag of white chips with Ghiradelli baking chocolate. That was a little better but still not smooth or good enough. I gave up I'm sorry to say. If you make them and are successful, good for you. Just have a back up if you're going to have to take them somewhere.

Looking at this picture gave me an idea to just use Vanilla ice cream instead and then freeze them. Simpler, but still fun. My kids won't eat cream cheese. We will see how it goes....

I read all the reviews followed the tips and mine definitely did not turn out like the picture. I froze the dough before rolling in white chocolate but it was still messy and not smooth. We still enjoyed them but they were not cute little snowman, just yummy, but messy little white balls!

These were really fun to make. But I do reccomend using almond bark instead of white chocolate, and putting the Oreo mixture onto the Oreo and then freezing it, instead of freezing them and then putting them on the Oreos. The almond bark hardens after about a minute so you don't need to put them in the fridge. ??

The worst recipe ever! di not look good. Not impressed.
