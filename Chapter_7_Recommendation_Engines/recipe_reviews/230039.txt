This was very moist, not too heavy, just lightly spiced, and very fruity.  I followed the recipe as written except I cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2c and it was just sweet enough for my tastes, cause I like tartness.  I used a handheld mixer to mix it all up.  The batter might not seem like it will cover all the fruit, but it bakes up beautifully.  I cooled it for 15 minutes in the pan on a rack, then turned it out to finish cooling.  You could easily substitute other fruit or use all one type of fruit.  Would easily accept other spice combinations as well. I might try pears and ginger next time.

I actually made a lot of modifications to this recipe because I was afraid it wouldn't be moist enough, sweet enough or spicy enough.  So here's what I did:  I used 3 eggs, 2 cups of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of regular sugar, 3/4 cup vegetable oil, 1-1/2 tsp. baking soda, and I added the following spices:  1/8 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 t. allspice and 1/2 tsp Chinese 5 spice.  I baked it in a tube pan for only 50 minutes.  I also used a mixer instead of only hand mixing.  I added a brandy glaze made with sugar, butter, half and half and brandy and I sprinkled sugar crystals on it. It was moist and delicious.  I took it to a gathering and everyone loved it. The photos above are mine so you can see what it looked like.

My family has been making this cake for over 25 years and it's a favorite everywhere we take it! ****The only missing step is BUTTERING AND FLOURING your bundt pan before spooning the batter in. You will NEVER have a problem getting the cake to fall right out of the pan if you do this! Just let the cake cool 30 mins before turning out onto a platter.**** Also note that the batter will be very stiff when stirring the fruit and nuts in. A thin coating of oil on a big sturdy spoon makes the stirring much easier. The finished batter will look like more fruit than batter but it turns out perfectly every time. Don't skimp on the apples, either, or your cake will be dry. I use slightly mounded cups when measuring the apple pieces. Don't overdo the fruit either, otherwise the cake can be too moist.
The ingredient proportions are perfect as is, the cake is sweet, and icing is unnecessary. Powdered sugar is a must, and looks beautiful on top.

The first time I try a recipe I don't mess with it. After it's been served if there's something lacking or that might enhance it, in my perception and/or to those that have eaten it, then I'll make notes for the next time it's made. So, out the chute, so to speak this cake was a winner. I took it to a potluck at which there were many desserts from which to choose and all but three pieces got eaten.  That to me was testimony to the recipe as is.

Made this exactly as written, and it was excellent.  The cranberries flavor complements the sweet and spicy cake. Not dry at all.  Had a little trouble getting it out of the Bundt pan, but with a little patience it came out fine.  Just sprinkled a little powdered sugar over the top to serve.  Great recipe, have saved it to make again.

Other reviewers have commented about the cake breaking when releasing it from the Bundt pan. I have never had an issue with this since I discovered “Magic Cake Pan Release”. 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup oil, and 1/2 cup flour, mixed together. Use a pastry brush to paint the pan. It lasts in the pantry in a Tupperware container. Love this stuff!

09.11.16 ~ Delicious! A dense, moist cake that is packed with flavor. I baked it in a Bundt® pan so that it would be easy to cut and share with many. It only took about 1 hour and 5 minutes to bake. I added a simple icing as I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. We really enjoyed this cake and with cranberries in the freezer, I'm sure I will be making it again.

It's a good thing I read the reviews before making this.  I usually make recipes as directed but I had a feeling it wouldn't turn out as written.  The dough was VERY stiff.  So, I added an extra egg and 1/2 t. of baking soda.  Made all the difference.

Great recipe!  I omitted the nuts because my husband doesn’t care for them, but it still came out perfectly.  No trouble getting it to come out—you can’t beat the old tried and true buttering/flouring the pan.  He couldn’t stop eating it!  Plenty sweet without icing.  Thank you again— this is a keeper!

This is a delicious cake!!!  I like to eat healthy when I can, so I made a few substitutions.  Instead of using oil, I used unsweetened applesauce.  I also substituted turbinado sugar for the brown sugar and millet flour for the white flour.  I didn't have enough nutmeg on hand, so I used 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cardamom and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves along with the 1 tsp cinnamon.  It tasted fantastic!  No one had any idea it was a healthier cake!  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again!!!  Don't be alarmed at how thick the batter is.  It bakes up beautifully.

The batter amount turned out to be perfect. I didn't stress about filling gaps in the pans (I used 2 glass loaf pans, which needed an hour bake time, as the author indicated.) I just loosely pressed the batter into the buttered pans, and they baked up great! Perfectly moist, full of fruit and flavor, and a good level of sweetness. I might cut the sugar by an additional 1/4 C next time, but think the recipe would satisfy most people's idea of a good level of sweetness for a cake.

I am excited to take this to a Thanksgiving gathering, and am sure the family will love it! One thought I had was that decreasing the sugar and adding a cream cheese glaze would be a great way to serve it!

This is easy to make and delicious.  The only change I made was instead of using 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  In my oven, and in a Bundt pan,  the cake was done at 55 minutes.  Also, the recipe says to pour the batter into the pan, but it is much too thick to pour and you have to spoon it in.  I will definitely make this again.  I had to give most of it away for Christmas, and didn't get enough of it!

I made the recipe as stated. But I added 3 eggs, and 1/4 c of half and half. I also used olive oil as my oil. I think it should have been cooked a little less longer, like 50-55 min.  I think I would add more cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg, maybe a splash of rum or brandy also, why not!

Make this exactly as the recipe called for.  Love the cake.  Didn't take a picture since the cake stuck to the pan.  That didn't stop us from enjoying this wonderful cake.  Will be making it again for sure!

I read the reviews first before baking and took the advice regarding the sugar (only used 1 cup) and then added my own spin to it. Instead of oil, I added my own home made baked applesauce from Ina Garten's recipe, and added raisins instead of nuts. I didn't need to add chopped apples as the sauce I made was a chunky home made sauce. It was done within an hour and 15 minutes, was tart, moist and so delicious I will make again!

The cake was dry and I even added 1/2 c buttermilk to it. The sweetness was way to much.  If I try it again I would add 1/2 cup applesauce and take down the sugar to  1 cup.

I will make again. I reduced sugar by 1/2 c. 
Needed to add approximately 1/2 c. milk-
batter just too dry.  Only baked for @40mins- but I have convection oven- maybe that's why the bake time was so much shorter. Everyone loved it - I added a simple vanilla glaze with cinnamon to the top when cooled. Love that it is not too sweet. Excellent balance between tart and sweet . Great for Fall themed events.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were because I didn't have apples, I doubled the cranberries and used almonds instead of pecans.  Moist, delicious and a huge hit!

I was afraid this would end up dry, but it's great! I followed the exact recipe and it's delicious.
