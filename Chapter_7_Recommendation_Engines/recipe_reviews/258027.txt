This was a good basis for a recipe. However,  I did make some changes. I added pepper, about the same amount as salt, 3 finely minced cloves of garlic, a tablespoon of dry oregano and basil, and cut the parsley in half and used dry.  I will definitely make these again, especially being they freeze great so I can make a batch,  eat what I want and freeze the rest! To heat, just stick in the microwave for one minute and finish in toaster oven and heat at 300 degrees until hot.

I baked these after forming them using my medium-sized cookie scoop.  Instead of adding just parsley (I used 2 tablespoons of dried rather than fresh), I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of my Papa's Seasoning from this site.  I made these without using a sauce other than catsup with added hot sauce, but next time I'll use a marinara.  Thanks, weeble!  We enjoyed our dinner a lot!

I always try to make the recipe exactly as it is written before I  review it, but I only had plain bread crumbs on hand.  This being said, I added  1 1/2 Tbsp. of Italian seasoning to compensate.  The meatballs were delicious!  Try are firm but still moist with a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor.   I did turn the meatballs 1/2 way through cooking to brown them evenly.  I did not add them to my spaghetti sauce or simmer them. I highly recommend these!

I had a half pound of leftover turkey from another recipe I made. I wanted to find something quick and easy so as not to waste it. My husband thought these meatballs were great. I asked him if I should make again, he said OH YEAH!

I made these to roll into mini meatballs for Italian Wedding Soup. I cooked them right in the broth. They turned out really well. Plenty of flavor, and a good basic meatball that can be used in so many different ways.

Theses were really easy to make. I used dried parsley and added basil, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder to the mix.

Add 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts to these meatballs and you won’t regret it. Sounds weird, I know, but my family begs for these once a week at least.

Nothing spectacular! The meatballs were very bland, and my hubby didn’t like it! Will not make this recipe again very disappointing! Especially when your husband says they have no taste.

Excellent and easy to follow recipe! I sprayed the meatballs with Pam cooking spray and gave them a tune every 5 minutes to brown more evenly on all sides. Used dry parsley and hand shaped the meatballs into more 1/2”-1” in diameter.

These meatballs are delicious. i substitute the italian seasoned turkey as it gives the meatball more of a sausagey flavor.

This was very easy to make.  The meatballs could use a little more flavor in my opinion.  However, they were picky-husband approved.

These were good, after I added a couple of grinds of black pepper, and 1 clove of finely minced garlic.  I suppose that you can also make this mixture into patties, which I'll make at a later date.

I added a good amount of oregano.  These were very flavorful and extremely moist.
