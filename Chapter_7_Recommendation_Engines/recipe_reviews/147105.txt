This is certainly an acceptable recipe, but nothing extraordinary. Make some mashed potatoes and add some onion, bacon, garlic and rosemary.  It's as simple as that. There's nothing wrong with this, and it IS a step up from  plain old mashed potatoes (although there's certainly nothing wrong with plain old mashed potatoes!), there's just nothing here that blows your socks off. I added more butter, no milk.

Potatoes were a bit dry - I would suggest adding a tad more milk.

The flavors didn't blend well - I think a heavily carmelized sweet onion would have been better than the red onion.

I think these are TERRIFIC!  The flavors blend together so well.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I used 8 small red potatoes and kept the skin on.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt in the water to boil the potatoes, and then added 1/2 tsp. kosher salt to the finished potatoes.  I added 1/4 tsp. fresh groud black pepper and replaced 1/2 of the butter with light sour cream.  I served these with the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs from this site.  These potatoes were my favorite part of the meal!

I absolutely adore these mashed potatoes.  To think something so easy could be so wonderful.  There was a perfect balance of flavors.

Very nice change from regular mashed potatoes.  I like the recipe as is but also tried a variation where I substituted yogurt for the milk &/or butter.

I thought these potatoes were FANTASTIC! My entire family disagreed.  I'll admit young boys 9-4 are not the target audience for this dish so take the rating with a grain of salt.  They gave it a one and I gave it a five. Used 2 big russets and made as written.  If your family loves plan jane mashed potatoes like mine- they may not like this.  But I did!!

I wish the recipe was more specific on the kind of potatoes and how big they should be. That aside, I used about 8 red potatoes, with the skins on and added a spoonful of FF sour cream when mashing the potatoes. I did heat the milk to almost boiling to make a fluffier potato. My family was divided. The husband and I liked this but the kids did not. I think it's a nice blend of flavors and quite different than your usual mashed potatoes. This went really well with Reunion Meatballs, which are also from this site, and garlic broccoli. I plan on using the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast by making them into fried potato pancakes.

This was a real nice change from plain old mashed potatoes. I used yukon gold potatoes and fresh rosemary, minced. I used a little buttermilk and a 1/4 cup of butter. The potatoes were creamy and fluffy enhanced by the bacon bits and hint of fresh rosemary. The bacon really adds a lot of flavor to the potatoes as does the garlic. I added a little of the bacon grease to the mashed potatoes. All the flavors balanced well together. I served this with, "Incredible Cheesy Turkey Meatloaf," and "Browned Buttered Vegetables with Almonds", from this website.

I added another teaspoon of rosemary as I had a lot of potatoes and I didn't add the bacon; so I cooked down the garlic and onions in an extra virgin olive oil.  These are delicious mashed potatoes

Do NOT miss this one!! It's awesome! It's not specified to peel the potatoes, so I chose not to. went a bit heavy on the bacon & perhaps just a bit more rosemary. I left the texture a bit chunky. SO tasty & SO easy! Thanks.

I am giving this a 4 because I changed it a little. I didnt have bacon so I sauted the onion and garlic in half vege oil and butter. Im sure with the bacon it would deserve a 5! They were still good without the bacon. No gravy needed. Tons of flavor!

Pretty good, I made this with stuffed pork chops. They went well together. Not extraordinary though.

These are unfreaking believable, I did use 2 shallots instead of the red onion because I find those to be too overwhelming...my left-overs will be used for potato cakes because they are that good!

Part of the nephew' birthday dinner...forgot to do the bacon, so that was missing...but had some minced onions and used dehydrated rosemary for seasoning...rather than use milk to mash potatoes, I used half a stick of unsalted butter and 8 oz sour cream...was pretty good, cooked about 7 lb of potatoes...duh, no clue what I was thinking! We had enough left to send home with everyone, along with some of the baked chicken...even the little kids liked it!!

It was extremely delicious!   The bacon and rosemary were not over powering. All the flavors mixed well together and was very creamy. Very easy to make!

I think these potatoes were delicious! I used red potatoes with the skin on, substituted 1/2 cup of chicken broth for the milk and used home-grown rosemary. The aroma that's left in the air after cooking the bacon, onions, garlic and rosemary is great!

I made this today for Thanksgiving :) it turned our very good & I would have definitely caramelized the onions with the bacon. But it smells delicious & I hope everyone like it!

What a nice change from just plain mashed potatoes!!  These potatoes were so good.  I will be making this dish often.  Thanks for the recipe.
