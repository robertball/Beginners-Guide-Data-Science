Everyone loved this fresh, summery dessert, but I couldn't fit the jello and cantaloupe into a regular pie shell. Only the cream cheese mixture fit. Next time I would be sure to use a deep dish pie shell, or better yet, make a graham cracker base in a pyrex dish, cook it first, then add the cheese mixture and jello.

this recipe is similar to a strawberry dessert that i make, so i made a pretzel crust instead of the pastry crust. i also made this in a 9 inch square pan instead of the pie pan based on other reveiws, next time i will make in 9"x13" pan. overall, a very refreshing dessert and i will definatly be making again and again.

i tried this recipe. it is really perfect for summer, as it is very fresh and cooling. the best thing about it is that it is not too sweet at all.

Overall, the pie tasted good. However, next time I will use a deep dish pie crust. Also, there was no more for the jello after the whip cream was in the pie crust so I scrapped the cream out of the crust and mixed it in with the jello. I also think that I will not add the cold water to the jello.

Light and tasty pie!  As others have already said, the jello does not fit into a pie shell.  (I used a deep dish pie shell and it still didn't fit.)  I'd suggest either using a smaller box of jello or using a larger pan.  It's good pie though!
