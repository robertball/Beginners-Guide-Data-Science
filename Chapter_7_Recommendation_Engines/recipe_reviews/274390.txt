Another great option for eggplant! I used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and instead of the sauce, and I sprinkled a bit of garlic, oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes on top before the final bake because sauce usually has spices, while the diced tomatoes do not. It was very tasty, and I will definitely make it again. I served it as the main course with brown rice and quinoa on the side. I think it would taste great with some grated Parmesan or other cheese melted on top.

DELICIOUS and sooooo comforting!!!  The only thing I did differently was to use the entire 15-oz. can of tomato sauce (I didn’t have a smaller can and didn’t want to waste any).  Even my husband, who isn’t particularly fond of eggplant, enjoyed this dish very much!  Thanks for a lovely, healthy recipe!!!  Will make it again!
