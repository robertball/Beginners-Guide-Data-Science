I always enjoy trying new tea bread recipes since I drink a lot of fresh brewed tea from leaves in the winter.  Since there were no reviews I decided to halve the recipe to try it out.  DELICIOUS!  My dates were already bought chopped and were slightly sugar coated in the package.  I decided to cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup (halved recipe) to make sure the bread was not too sweet.  I used 2 "mini" loaf pans and baked on 350 for 45 minutes.  They were slightly darker than I would have liked them to be so next time I will start checking at 35 minutes (this may allow an even moister bread).  The bread is slightly dense, moist and has a nice sweetness with the dates.  Personally, I would 'not' add cream cheese on top because I think the bread is sweet enough on its own.

Wow, what a great little baked good to take along during the hollidays. Very good as is, however I did add about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the wet mixture.

Did not have cream of tartar, so replaced baking soda and cream of tartar with 2 teaspoons of baking powder.
Worked a treat, lovely moist and delicious
