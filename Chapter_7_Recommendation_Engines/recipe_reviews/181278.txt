I loved it, Loved It, Loved It....Yummmy. I did make some changes, to make it low calorie. I used sugar sub (equal and splendar).  I've been looking for a recipe that was quick and easy this one was perfect.  So, Yummy with my coffee Easter moring. I dld make some spice changes.  I used cinnamon instead of apple pie spice and changed the butter to low cal butter sub.  I cut each biscuit in four pieces.  I put six pieces in each muffin cup. And as a Weight Watcher each muffin was only 1 1/2 points.  This was so good it truly reminded me of a "REAL" cinnamon roll from the donut shop.    Thanks Lindsay. great idea.

I used the bread dough from the Cloverleaf Rolls, which is also from this site (I don't usually keep whomp biscuits on hand). Because the recipe made twelve "muffins", I had to double the rest of the ingredients. This was good, though next time I'll just do what I usually do with monkey bread and dip the ball in butter and roll in the sugar/spice blend. I did make a cream cheese drizzle for the top of these which the boys flipped for. It took a little more time with a homemade bread dough but the outcome was great. The kids especially liked these. NOTE: I used my small cookie scoop for this and made three balls in each muffin tin, just like I did for making Cloverleaf Rolls.

I didn't have pie spice in my cupboard so I used cinnamon and nutmeg. I used 7 muffin cups but could have spread it out to 8 or 9. These got rave reviews from my kids and my dad. Super easy to make. These do not last long. Update: Made these again and they fill 9 muffin liners nicely.

Absolutely Fantastic!! However, I did make a few changes. I only had a mini muffin pan so I used that instead. I cut the biscuits into six pieces and put 3 pieces in each... I was short 12 pieces so I had to cut up 2 more biscuits from another can and I just doubled the spice sugar mixture. I put my pieces into a plastic bowl and put a top on it so all I had to do was shake it around and the pieces were coated. I added a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the butter mixture while it was cooking and spooned it on. Took eight minutes to bake and is absolutely wonderful! (I made an account just to write this review! XD)

These were excellent and super easy to throw together. This recipe makes it easier to serve a small crowd without breaking out the bundt pan. If you're like me and didn't have apple pie spice on hand, you can use the following measurements to arrive at the total of 1 tsp apple pie spice: 1/8 tsp ground ginger, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, heaping 1/8 tsp ground allspice and 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon. This recipe will be added to my recipe box for sure!

My Husband LOVED these. I give this 4 stars instead of five becuase I had to search elsewhere for a recipe for biscuit dough, as I do not purchase premade dough. Heres what I used for my dough-2cups flour, 4 tsp powder, 1 tbsp sugar, 1/2 c butter, and 2/3 c milk. Filled 12 muffins well and had enough to have a few plain biscuits on the side.

Simple receipe to follow. My son is going to a early morning potluck on Sunday so I wanted to try this out before hand...yes I use my sons a guinea pigs. I read through most of the reviews and used a lot of their suggestions from those reviews. I used the Grands Original (16 oz) which meant I needed to tweak the measurements for the mixture you rolled the pieces in. I also used a ziploc bag to get all the pieces covered completely (one biscuit cut up at a time). I used the apple slicer someone else suggested putting 6 of those covered pieces in each liner. I was sure not to over fill the those liners with the sugar mixture by using a spoon to drizzle it on and making sure all the pieces were covered somewhat (because one review said it all pooled at the bottom). I reduced my temp to 350 degrees as someone else suggested and ended up extending the time by 2 min increments (total of 16 mins) until they were done on top and sprung back as the recipe calls for. We shared one to make sure they were done all the way through and I must say we all gave them two thumbs up.

These are sooo good & sooo easy to make. Introduce your children to the kitchen. Let them help you make these. My grandchildren all want to bake monkey muffins when they come over. We use Grands muffins. They are large so we cut them into 8 to 10 pieces. I cut the pieces. They put them in a covered tupperware bowl. Shake Shake Shake. Then they put them in the muffin tins & I finish them off. They put them in the oven. I take them out & they are so proud of themselves. If there are no parents around we make up little gift bags for them to take home for a surprise for Mommy & Daddy. At Christmas time they wanted to make some for their teachers. For the apple pie spice mix I use: 4 tsp cinnamon 2 tsp nutmeg There is an "Apple pie spice" recipe on this site & that one calls for 1 tsp cardamon. This is a spice which I never have on hand & the recipe tastes just has good w/o it. Have Fun!!!!

These were delicious! I tore each biscuit into 3 or 4 pieces and put 5 pieces in each liner. I used one 12oz can and two smaller 7.5oz cans and had enough for 20 "muffins". My only advice is to be careful how much of the brown sugar mixture you spoon into the liner. I spooned a little too much into a couple liners and the sugar bubbled over and burned to the side of the "muffin". Otherwise a great recipe...one I will definitely use again!!

This is more of a question than a rating/review but I'll give it 5 stars in advance based on other reviews. How far in advance has anyone made these? I want to make them before we head to our in-laws for xmas (today is Thursday and we would have them for Xmas brunch so two days in advance). Is that too early? I plan to just heat them back up in the oven on a low settinghttp://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Monkey-Bread-Muffins/Detail.aspx#. If anyone has made them in advance please let me know I'd like to hear your experience.

This was so easy and tasted great! Love that it takes such a short time to make and bake...I had some very impatient kids waiting for them! They loved them and gobbled them up and begged for more! Next time I will double the recipe! I did not use the apple pie spice though just cinnamon sugar because some of the kids don't like the apple pie spice. This is a winner!!!

Yummy!!! This was perfect for the breakfast get- together that I had to attend! I doubled the recipe & came out with18 muffins. I also toasted some pecans & then added them to the butter & sugar mixture as it was melting. I will keep this one close at hand!!!

Very good for bite sized muffin bread and extremely simple to make! Be advised that if you follow the recipe for 6 muffins they will be huge! The biscuits puff up and over the top of the muffin so I'd recommend spreading it out of 8-9 muffins.

OMG! these made my pregnant tummy happy! perfect sweet and biscuit combination! it almost makes me wish I had made the dough too. and not going to lie I was a bit nervous when I put the brown sugar "sauce" over the top of the dough because I thought they were going to turn out super sticky and I had already promised my kids one so I just prepared myself for a sticky mess to clean up but they are definitely not THAT sticky! I will definitely be making these again in my house!

These were delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe said but I could have spread the pieces out to make an extra biscuit or two if needed. Also I did not have any apple pie spice so I made my own using 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/8 tsp allspice 1/8 tsp ginger. I baked them for the full 12min until they were a nice golden color. I saved some of the brown sugar mixture to drizzle on top after they were finished and I'm sure glad I did b/c most of what I drizzled on before baking pooled at the bottom and was left in the pan when I took them out. Great recipe and super easy! Thanks!

These are pretty good. I found the recipe slightly confusing in terms of how much dough was supposed to go into the muffin cup. I only had a 7.5 ounce can of biscuits so I made that into seven muffins. I just ripped up a few of the biscuits and dispersed the dough among the rest of the seven biscuits to fill the muffin cup more. I didn't have apple pie spice so I just used cinnamon. Also I didn't use water I used vanilla extract. I didn't drizzle the brown sugar/butter over the muffins I actually rolled the muffins in the mixture and then put them in the cups. I thought that would ensure every bite had flavor. Then I added the remaining white sugar/cinnamon to the top. The only reason I didn't give five stars are because try as I did some bites just didn't have any flavor and simply tasted like canned dough but the bites that did have flavor were delicious.

very good tasting. was perhaps a bit more of the brown sugar / butter mixture than I needed but very pretty and tasty! (I also made a tube into garlic/onion/ s&p with butter drizzled on top - those too turned out very good. Am anxious to make other combinations

To save time I put the sugar mixture in a plastic bag added the biscuit pieces and shook to coat. What I love the most about these is the caramel sauce that forms in the bottom of the muffin cup.

Awesome recipe! The Pillsberry biscuit dough was on sale at my grocery store so I bought them... and then I saw this recipe so it was perfect! I've always wanted to make monkey bread but I've never had the time to. This recipe is way faster and easier and my whole family loves it. I will make this again and again! Thanks so much

Pretty good. I used a 7.5 oz can of biscuits and made 6 muffins which turned out to be too few as the brown sugar mixture overflowed everywhere. The flavor was good but I think Monkey Bread that uses butterscotch pudding mix tastes better.

This is a fast easy recipe that is good to make with young ones. Using a pizza wheel my 8 year old granddaughter was able to do a large portion of the recipe herself. We added raisins and chopped walnuts. It is easy to serve and no mess. The only disadvantage I found is that the brown sugar mixture seemed to settle at the bottom. Everyone loved them. Thank you Lindsay Deaver for sharing your recipe.

Bravo bravo bravo! I couldn't find apple pie spice so I made by own by using 1.5 tps cinnamon 0.125 tps all spice 0.125 ground ginger and 0.5 tps nutmeg. I still have leftovers for next time. I made the mistake of making as an afternoon snack. My husband and I ended up finishing all the muffins so we had to skip dinner:-p

Oh my goodness these were so simple to make but just so good. I followed the recipe exactly other than cutting the biscuit dough into 10 small pieces rolling into balls and then dipping in the apple pie spice and sugar. I used cupcake liners as I have so many pretty ones in the house. (also used the apple pie spice recipe off this site). So good I know I will be making these again. Good quick simple breakfast for a lazy sunday morning!!!

Easy and tasty. Changes I will make next time: use foil liners. The brown sugar mix leaked through the paper The number of muffins I got was 10 just the right size. All depends on the muffin pan size. I cooked the syrup in the microwave and with a 2 cup glass cup it worked well.

My son signed me up to make monkey bread for his class breakfast. Who wants 25 kids with cute yet grubby hands picking at the same loaf? This was a PERFECT idea. Each kid gets their own little serving. I made a test batch for my family to see how they'd come out and they were great.

I too didn't have apple pie spice but I did have pumpkin pie spice (approx. 3/4 tsp) and added about a 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Also I had to use a 9" cake pan to bake these. Baked about 3 min. longer.

I liked these! I thought I had Apple Pie spice but it was Pumpkin Pie and it till tasted great. I used Grands Buttermilk and gut the pieces a little smaller than called for. I also drizzled a little of the sauce over the hot muffins right after taking them out of the oven.

These turned out just how I hoped they would. They had a wonderful almost carmel-like flavor and they were really fun to eat. It took me about ten minutes to prepare everything and they were easy to assemble. My family and I loved them. When I told my husband about the child calling them "monkey sins" he loved it and started calling them that too.

Making monkey bread in muffin cups is built-in "portion control". Quick and easy. Would be fun to make with the kids. Much better warm than cold but perhaps that goes without saying.

My family really liked these. I had a problem with them sticking to the muffin liners which made them hard to eat so I'll probably just skip the liners next time. I didn't have apple pie spice so I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp each of ginger and nutmeg.

I just made these 2 mornings ago for my sons...they loved them & they looked so pretty! The only things I did differently was use just cinnamon & to save some of the caramel to drizzle on top before serving. I kept the caramel warm & also added an extra TB. of butter to it so it was a bit thinner and would drizzle better. (The caramel is quite thick otherwise) I used non-stick spray in my pans instead of butter and put 7 biscuit pieces into each cup 6 in the last one. Make sure you pour the caramel more towards the center of the biscuit pieces & just a little around the top edges. I used a knife to push some caramel down between the biscuits. Be forewarned...these will bubble over during baking. To avoid a gigantic mess in your oven put the muffin tin on a foil lined baking sheet before placing in the oven. Any caramel lava will flow onto the foil instead of the bottom of your oven! I also let them sit for a few minutes to "set up" a little as I felt they would fall apart if I tried removing them from the pan right out of the oven. I used a skinny spatula to GENTLY pop them up on one side then used the spatula & my other hand to place them onto the serving plate bunched together in a circle. I then drizzled the remaining warm caramel over the tops. Beautiful & very yummy. I had found this recipe on the Pillsbury site when looking up Monkey Bread recipes and was so glad that I ran across these. They have lots of other great recipe ideas on their site too!:-)

Awesome! I had one can of "Grands" & it easily made 8 muffins! Tasted great I used cinn & nutmeg in replace of all spice (didn't have). I prefer these to the big ring that I have sampled before I was nice & gooey-we loved it!

I always wanted to know what monkey bread tasted like and decided to try this recipe. I had 2 7.5 cans of canned biscuit dough from a holiday leftover and used that. I didn't have apple pie spice so I used pumpkin pie spice but think I would like the apple better. I just melted the butter and brown sugar in the microwave for 1 minutes stirring well after 30 seconds and when done. With 15oz of dough I got 9 huge pull apart muffins cutting each dough piece into 4 with scissors. They actually have a really nice appearance out of the oven and I like the caramel sauce. Something though keeps reminding me these still taste like fancied up biscuits. Love the idea though of individual portions. ty

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I did use a full size can of Grands and it made 12 muffins. I dumped the remaining cinnamon sugar mixture in with the carmel makings. One other small add and that was a tbsp of white karo syrup to the carmel so it didn't get hard.. I didn't change the amount of carmel either. It was perfect for all 12. I will be sending this one to my kids and maybe having at the next family gathering. My boyfriend asked me to make sure this recipe is at the top of the rotation. MMMmm

AWESOME!! If you like traditional monkey bread in a Bundt or tube pan you will love the convenience of muffins! Plus it doesn't make a huge amount since you're just using the one can of biscuits! I got 8 muffins from mine 5 pieces of quartered biscuit per cup. I skipped the apple pie spice since I had none and used cinnamon instead. Delicious easy Sunday morning breakfast!

Okay so this is a grand idea. I changed it up a bit by using refrigerated crescent dough and did not put the dough into muffin cups. I just rolled the dough in the apple pie spice and sugar mixture then poured the brown sugar/butter mixture on top of the rolls. These turned out fun! I'm not sure it is really Monkey Bread but the flavor was good and it is a fun twist to using the refrigerated dough. A small bonus since I poured all the butter/sugar on the dough I wound up with a puddle in the pan which after cooked became a kind of stiff caramel which was quite tasty. Fun to make and fun to eat!

This was a wonderful idea. My 15 yr old son changed it up a bit by omitting the apple spice for rum spice and nutmeg and used homemade biscuts instead of premade ones. With a gas stove I found that 350 is the perfect temp as well as only cooking the biscuts ( he called pirate cakes) 7-10 mins. All in all a wonderful recipie!

I can't review yet because I haven't made them but I have been making Monkey Bread for over 20 years and it always gets rave reviews but my recipe calls for 4 cans of biscuits...wayyy too much for one person. Can't wait to try this version..and keep asking myself why I didn't think of doing it this way for alll these years. Thanks so much for a great idea!

Good stuff! Simple quick and easy to throw together for a breakfast treat. This yielded 12 muffins for me. I was out of cinnamon but did have a little cinnamon/sugar grinder I was able to use. I can't wait to make them again w/heavy cinnamon (not a fan of apple pie spice). I chose to top w/a simple 10X sugar/milk/vanilla glaze. THANKS for the recipe Lindsay Deaver!

This turned out nicely except for the fact that the topping bubbled out over the top of the muffin pan and onto the bottom of my oven! Make sure you place a cookie sheet underneath to catch possible run-over. Next time I will just use a bunt pan instead.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and followed other's advice and baked them at 350 for about 12 minutes. I sprayed the pan and they came out easily. I made my own "apple pie spice" like other reviewers suggested. I also added thin slices of apples amongst the layers and that was a fun addition!

I made these in foil cupcake liners based on other reviews that the sauce pools at the bottom. That was an understatement. The sauce bubbled up and was all over my cupcake pan and under the liners making a huge mess. I would probably half the sauce if I made these again since so little of it actually stayed on the monkey bread. That is my major complaint otherwise 3 out of 4 of my kids and my husband gobbled these up

These are great and my kids (four and two) loved helping make them! I actually used a smaller can of biscuits (7.5 ounces) pulled two out for a different recipe and used the rest and then halved the remaining ingredients in the original recipe. This made four good size muffins which my kiddos scarfed down. We will definitely be making these again.

These are soooo delicious! I made these for a co-worker's going away lunch. You can't even tell they're made from biscuit dough! I got 21 muffins from 2 16 oz containers of biscuits. I too added a bit of fresh grated nutmeg because I didn't have apple pie spice or cardomon to make the spice. Smells fabulous! I did layer in between the biscuit pieces just shy of a tablespoon of chopped apple. Will definitely make these again.-Kathy

This didn't work out well for me. The sauce ran over the cups onto the bottom of the oven. The biscuit pieces puffed up too much. I couldn't bake them long enough because of the burning sugar - smokey kitchen. So the bottom pieces were doughy. Sigh.

So easy I have made this several times for breakfast on school days. I like to add about a teaspoon of finely diced apples into each muffin tin to give a little more depth to the apple pie spicing and a little more bite. They are delicious!

genius using muffin tins instead of full tube pan esp for kids. we had girls sleepover and kids loved helping make this for breakfast. really no right/wrong way with how big/many biscuits per muffin cup- eyeball it. we did add 1T vanilla into the melt butter- small touch but divine smell; and cinnamon as we didn't have apple spice.

This is so simple and so good. I did have way too much of the sugar/spice mixture as well as the brown sugar sauce. However it may be because the roll of biscuits I got was smaller (????). I will buy two tubes next time... can't complain about having too many of these on hand.:)

I had to buy the Grands Biscuits so they were a 16 oz.pkg. I adjusted the recipe for 8 servings. I made my own apple pie spice with cinnamon nutmeg allspice and a dash of ginger.The sugar and syrup was plenty and it made 20 muffins. Was perfect. I cut each biscuit into about 6 or 7 pieces but each muffin cup had 3 pieces.I kept the temperature at 375 and cooked them for about 15 min. All in all they were delicious and super easy to make. The family loved them!

Fantastic easy recipe. The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of water for the drizzle but I needed 2. Just plain yummy and the kiddies loved them. I think I will get adventurous the next time and add some slivers of apples.

These were super easy and quick to make. My husband really liked them. If you want to do them ahead of time do everything but the topping. Then make the topping pour it over the buns and pop it in the oven. Great for warm breakfast buns. With the exception of adding a little cinnamon I followed the recipe. As I didn't want a lot of them I got the small container of biscuits. It made 8 muffins. Also be very generous with the topping... yummy.

This is a good recipe I will just use cinnamon instead of apple pie spice next time it didn't taste like real monkey bread. The muffins looked too plain when baked so I drizzled some icing over them and they looked awesome and tasted even better. Thank you for the recipe will make again!

Made these once and they were a huge hit. I like to use an apple slicer to cut the biscuits into 9 or 10 little pieces quickly roll them in the sugar mixture and voila. I tried the pizza cutter and knife method but the apple slicer is so much faster. They are great right out of the oven and even a day or two later if you microwave them for about 10 seconds. Yum!

Great delicious and easy!! I doubled the recipe to make 12 muffin cups. You definitely need to use a muffin pan with raised edges so the topping doesn't overflow. I would suggest pushing the biscuit bits into the cups because they raise a lot.

Easy and yummy they did not last long at all! Only change I made was to add the extra cinnamon sugar I had left over after coating the biscuit pieces to the butter and brown sugar. Boiled lightly for a minute or two and spooned over cups. Will make again soon!

Turned out pretty good...the second time.  I pretty much  followed the recipe as is.  I’m not really a baker so maybe it was me but the original recipe left off details.  Like divide all the glaze you make divided evenly among the muffins another recipe said add about 2 Tbsp per muffins.  I used Pillsbury Grands muffins

These were delicious and pretty easy. A couple suggestions: If using muffin liners don't use cheap ones. If you do double them up because some of the Brown sugar mixture leaked through the bottoms of my liners leaving a buttery mess. Also after I cut my dough pieces I rolled them in some melted butter before applying the apple pie & white sugar mixture. I wanted to jazz up my biscuit dough which was an off-brand. I baked these for 16 minutes to ensure they were cooked thoroughly. As they were cooling I slathered on a little Marzetti's old fashioned caramel then caramelized on broil for just under 3 mins. These will not only make a good breakfast in the AM but they'd make a sweet treat for special friends as well. Thanks for sharing:)

I didn't have biscuits in the fridge so I used the biscuit recipe off a bisquick box (bisquick milk). Instead of dividing the dough into muffin pans I just spread it out into a big oval on a foil lined greased cookie sheet threw in a can of fried apples (drained) sprinkled in some of the apple pie/sugar mix folded it over & topped with the apple p/sugar mix brn sug sauce & chopped pecans. This mess didn't last 10 minutes:-) I was temporarily stumped when most of the brown sug sauce ran off & started to burn; I just flipped it onto a plate after it cooled & the burnt sauce broke off like thin peanut brittle when I peeled off the foil. Next time I'll use a hard pie pan to keep all that gooey goodness in but this was still a hit! My version was a fast cheap delicious apple cobbler of sorts that's a definite keeper. Great base recipe to experiment with.

Made from leftover Pizza/Bread Dough. Although it came out delicious I suggest sticking too biscuit or muffin dough. Also added chopped pecans to the brown sugar topping and found roasting the leftovers made an equally delicious snack.

My boys thought this was a great breakfast! I reduced the sugar to 2 T white and 1 tsp cinnamon for the coating. Then I used 1 T butter 2 T brown sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla for the glaze. And I added peeled and chopped apple. It was definitely sweet enough! Yummy!

My family really enjoyed these. I made a few changes based on what I had at home. I had 7.5 ounce cans of dough so I used two cans but the same amount of sugar to toss and still had left over. I didn't have apple pie spice so I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg mixed with the half cup sugar. It made 12 muffins. I kept the same amount of glaze too. Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I used 2 cans of refridgerated crescent "biscuits". They are shaped like biscuits instead of the crescent triangles and I cut each into 4 pieces. I put about 6 pieces into each muffin cup. I used splenda/brown sugar mix (just 1/4 cup is equal to 1/2 cup standard brown sugar) and poured a bit of my leftover sugar mixture in. I also used someone else's mix for apple pie spice from another review. Made 10 full size muffin cups. If I were to make again I might only put 4-5 pieces in each cup and make 12 cups total. Perfection!

Easy to make for I had all the items in the Fridge or pantry. I didn't want to waste the sugar coating mixture so I added it to the brown sugar mixture and added 1 Tablespoon of butter for keeping similar proportions. You need to work quick to spoon the mixture into the muffins before it starts to cool and set. It worked out great for hungry teens in the morning with a great taste!

Great little sweet treat. I followed the directions but put close to 5 pieces of the dough in each cup not 6. I think it's only a judgement call based on the biscuits you use. Some are larger than others. I also used cinnamon sugar and but it in a sandwich bag and coated 6 cut slices at a time. We all liked these treats for breakfast this morning and I will be making them again.

Turned out really good! And I ended up using the extra sauce and spiced sugar to make candied pecans. So thanks for the recipe!

Ok I used a large container of buttermilk biscuits (1 lb) which had 8 biscuits. Cut each into 4 pieces rolled in melted butter and dredged in cinnamon sugar. I placed 4 pieces in each paper cup and into my muffin tin. It then made 8 monkey muffins. There was a little melted butter so I poured it over the muffins. I also had a little cinnamon sugar so did the same. Baked for 25 minutes. They came out so deliciously crispy on top. I made these for breakfast yesterday morning. I nuked one this morning for 15 seconds but it was not as tasty as freshly made. My suggestion eat them all when first made.

I find if you dip your balls in water it rises much higher. Used cinnamon & sugar.

Addictive and delicious! Easy to make too! Family gobbled them all up in one morning. I used grands juniors and it made 12 muffins for me. I didn't have apple pie spice but per other review I went with 1/4 t. Allspice and 3/4 t cinnamon. Used three balls per muffin liner and the foil liners per multiple reviews. No burnt mess because I was cautious with amount of brown sugar mixture on them. Thank you Lindsay- a new breakfast treat for Sunday's around here!

It was amazing with many Fall flavors within a baked dish, it was rather splendid.

Quick & easy substitute for cinnamon rolls. I did not have apple pie spice so used cinnamon. I had 1 can of jumbo biscuits so cut those into 6 pieces rather than four. Baked about 20 minutes. The kids gobbled them up. Hubby thought they could have been sweeter & it would be simple enough to drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze next time. I ll certainly make this again.

Love this! I did cut the brown sugar in half, and the apple pie spice/sugar blend was enough for two batches. My husband requested this one to be repeated!
