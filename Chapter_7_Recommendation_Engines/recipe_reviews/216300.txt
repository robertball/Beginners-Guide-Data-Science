This was fabulous! I added some Italian spicy sausage and used diced tomatoes instead of the soup as suggested to me. The rice however took forever to be tender and ready to eat.

Probably wouldn't make this one again.  I found that the liquid dried up too quickly while cooking and I kept having to add water to keep it going in the skillet.  It didn't seem like an easy recipe while you're making it, because each step and preparation take a while if you follow the directions exactly like I did.  I'm not one to vary from a recipe, so unless someone has a great alternative to these directions, I'll pass.  Sorry!

My husband especially liked this! I used Tobasco sauce in lieu of the cajun seasoning (didn't have cajun seasoning). I also simplified this by using some precooked chicken breast I had in the freezer. Just threw it in the pot. I served it with crackers and my husband said, "You need to keep that recipe." Really easy and really good!

Soooo yummy! My boyfriend and I loved this. After reading some of the reviews, it didn't sound like it had much bite so I chopped up some jalapenos and tossed those in, it was fabulous!

The rice wouldn't cook at all and it just tasted like tomato soup. I will never make this again!
