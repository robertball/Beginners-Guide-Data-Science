As the author of this recipe, I would like to point out that  the stated 5 cup yield is a bit of a stretch. To ensure the full flavour is achieved it might be wise to not overly dilute. If possible use chicken stock rather than water should you decide to do so. Any extra liquid above what the recipe calls for should be added in small quantities. Taste as you go. I hope you like it. Enjoy!

This took a long time to make but it was so worth it. I made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit. I added shallots to the mix which made it less sweet. Very rich flavor and a darker gravy which is delish in my opinion.

Very good, I made this gravy with BWAYE's Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes and MISSJEN's Lemon-Herb Turkey.  Everything was FANTASTIC!

This gravy was perfect..... until I added the tomato paste and currant jelly.  It took on the distinct flavor of tomato sauce and ruined what otherwise was a delicious gravy. I also had to add a an instant gravy mix and a lot of spices to save it.  I did like the process of this recipe though and will use it as a base to make up my own.  Also, not sure how others made it but it didn't work for me in the roasting pan as I used a disposable aluminum one, so I just used a sauce pan.

I agree with the comment of liking the gravy until the tomato paste and jelly were added. Then I found it too sweet and could really taste the tomato. I wished I had a gravy packet to save it, but I didn’t and didn’t have time to tweak it so unfortunately had to serve it as it was and I was very disappointed.

I wish I would have read the review from the recipe submitter before making this.   I loved the procedure of this recipe, but found it severely lacking the turkey flavor that I wanted.   It tasted watery.   Using all chicken broth would have helped a lot.   When I added in the tomato paste I got an unwanted distinct tomato flavor instead of blending in as I was hoping.   Ultimately I had to add in a turkey gravy packet (which I despise doing), sage, thyme, pepper  and a fair bit of salt.  In spite of all of that, I liked the procedure so well that I think I will use parts of this recipe again.   I will definitely using only chicken broth instead of water.   I will add in sage and thyme and half of the tomato paste and jelly.
