So-so. I made this without the cauliflower (because I don't like it) and without broccoli (because I didn't have it). I felt like this soup was fine and I would eat it again, but not good enough to make again. Decent flavor. I liked having the curry flavor... kind of interesting. Just not interesting enough.

This was delicious! I left out the chicken pieces because my son didn't want them in. Next time I am putting the chicken in and I bet it will be even better.I thought this was quick and easy to make. It was a last minute late supper I had ready for my son when he came home from playing in his school's basketball game. He told me it gave him a warm cozy feeling inside..aaahhh comfort food.He hates veggies but loved them in this.

I made this almost exact to the recipe. It came out great. My method was with a single pot though. I saut√©ed my aromatic veggies in olive oil and garlic. Added the mushrooms, then stock, roasted chicken meat, when boiling, added cauliflower and broccoli. When cooked, added flour/milk mixture. Simmered until thickened (not boil milk), adjust seasonings with a little white wine. AWESOME!!

Excellent;  used Garam Marsala spice rather than curry
