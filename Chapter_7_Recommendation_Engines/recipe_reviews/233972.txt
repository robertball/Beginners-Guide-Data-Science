The instructions are incomplete. You need to add the mushroom/garlic mixture back in:) Of course, I did that. My husband and I enjoyed the dish a good deal. The lime at the end adds a lot. I wasn't sure how much to buy and ended up with extra mushrooms and red onions. Because I was using leftover chicken, I had less chicken. I'm not suggesting altering the recipe, just pointing out that it's flexible. I have been learning more about using quinoa, and I find that because I'm rinsing first as recommended by many, I use just 1 cup of water for cooking the quinoa.

The recipe was very easy, and tasted pretty good. The word "Thai" in the title is misleading as there is nothing Thai about this recipe. Will probably make again.

I thought this recipe was rather bland. It wasnâ€™t until I added some hot sauce that it had any real flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe.Besides adding the ingredients which had been left out in the procedure, I added fish sauce and reduced the amount of salt. Thanks for sharing

Aside from an unusual name, and incomplete instructions, I found this to be a healthy dinner. Protein from the quinoa, and chicken and a burst of zest from the lime and cilantro...not a bad recipe. I imagine this could be changed to a vegetarian friendly meal with some modifying. Thanks for sharing
