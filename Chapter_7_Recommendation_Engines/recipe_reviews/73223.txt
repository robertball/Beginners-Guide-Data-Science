We ate this tuna salad at the Trout Lodge in Missouri.  When we asked for the recipe, they gave us a print out from this site!  We can't wait to make it at home!

Don't you just hate it when people change the whole recipe and then rate it, I do...but here I am doing it, sorry...I basically combined Barbie's Tuna Salad, on this site, and New Wife Tuna Salad. I used: 5 hard-boiled eggs diced * 7 (6 oz) cans tuna, drained * 1 stalk celery, chopped * 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion * 1/2 cup mayo * 1 TBLS honey mustard * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/2 tsp seasoned salt * omitted dill pickle relish and celery seed * ADDED: 3 TBS Parmesan cheese, 1 TBLS dried parsley, 1 tsp dried dill weed and a pinch, or sprinkle, of garlic powder. This was great as an open face sandwich topped with cheese and broiled in the oven just enough to melt cheese. Thanks to both TANAQUIL (author of Barbie's Tuna Salad) and JMOR777 for New Wife Tuna Salad...

Good tuna salad - I cut it back to one 6 ounce can and used one hard boiled egg.  I didn't have honey mustard so I used dijon. To lighten it up I used Hellman's light mayo and added just a little more. I cut back on the onion a bit and added a pinch of garlic powder. I served this on toasted multi-grain bread with lettuce and a thick slice of tomato.

I have never made tuna salad from a recipe before, I always just mixed tuna with mayo and celery. When I saw this recipe it looked so interesting I just had to try it. Wow! It was delicious. My son and husband liked it too. It was very tasty. Thanks!

I love this recipe. It is actually exactly how I make it except I use actual dill pickles cut up because my whole family loves dill pickles (Clausen). And instead of honey mustard I use plain yellow mustard, but the honey mustard sounds good and I will be trying it that way. Thanks!

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I did add some garlic powder for personal taste and hubby prefers sweet pickles instead of dill but it still tasted yummy!!! I've added this to my recipe box!

Delicious!! This is exactly how I make tuna salad accept I've always just used plain mustard. The honey mustard gives such a great underlying sweetness that contrasts really well with the tart relish. Also added some diced carrot. With the carrot it is 5 stars. Try it and you will be hooked :)

Love tuna, check. Love celery, check. Love hard-cooked eggs, check. Love dill pickle (I mince two baby dill pickles instead of the relish), check. Old Bay instead of seasoned salt, check. The wife and I love this recipe and like to make “tuna wraps” with it. Use large flour tortillas covered with a single layer of large lettuce leaves. Spoon the tuna salad onto the lettuce. (I add halved cherry tomatoes too) and fold up like any other wrap. Thanks for posting!

Made this exactly as the recipe said and all I could taste was tuna fish. The next day I added more dill relish, onions, honey mustard and celery and didn't tell my family. After lunch I inquired if it tasted any different than the day before. Everyone said no. Just tuna fish. I was very disappointed in this dish. It seemed like a waste of ingredients for a very bland one note flavor. It would probably taste better without the tuna just the eggs and other favors. Taking this one out of my receptive box

This is awesome stuff. I loved the addition of honey mustard as I usually just add regular  mustard to my tuna salad. I did probably triple the amount of honey mustard but thats really personal taste. I did not think there were too many eggs in this. I almost halved the recipe but it turns out after lunch for 3 adults I only have enough left for a couple of sandwiches so it must by yummy!!!

Very good recipe. Not a traditional tuna salad with the eggs and all, but I love egg salad and this was a combo egg/tuna salad. I really don't care for just tuna salad so this was a great alternative.

Best Tuna Salad I've made.  I did use sweet pickle relish, dijon mustard, 1 T honey mixed into the mayo.  I made it for 6 servings and only used 2 hard boiled eggs, which is enough for us. Will definitely make again and again.

I'm surely not a new wife, but after 39 years of marriage, my husband said this was the best tuna I ever made!  It was very good! Only thing I did diff was I had no honey mustard so used some stone ground and added a squirt of honey. Good stuff!!

Like another reviewer mentioned, I used to make tuna salad by throwing ingredients together without really measuring, which is maybe why I never really loved tuna salad.  I was really surprised at how much I loved this recipe.  All the ingredients came together nicely and resulted in a mild (but nonetheless delicious) flavor.  If I'm feeling experimental one day I may try adding something else (maybe dill or a bit of lemon juice), but I won't be making tuna salad the old way, this is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is incredible. Like the egg salad, I used to do this wrong and my husband would turn away from it. After following this recipe, I barely even got to eat my own tuna salad... husband stole it and finished all of it. I had to make another batch the next day - which he also stole and finished!

This was really good! I was looking for a quick dinner and this hit the spot. I served it on toast with lettuce and a fruit salad on the side. It was better then the normal tuna salad that I make. Thanks!

Excellent recipie, everything mixed together so well. I used fresh Stripe Sea Bass instead of tuna for something different and it still came out nice, creamy, and full of flavor.

Our favourite egg / tuna salad recipe, I'm calling it "New Wife Tuna Salad Swiss Melt" ! Makes a good amount of food, 10-14 slice bread servings depending on size. Make a few personal tweeks: used 1 cup light mayo. 3 diced baby doll pickles, dash of pickle juice + 1 teaspoon capers; to replace the relish. Also added 1/2 teaspoon honey to 2 teaspoons regular mustard.  Lightly toasted one slice of bread topped with a few spinach leaves to cover, and the New Wife Tuna Salad, topped finally with thin Swiss cheese. Put in oven to broil at 450f for 2-3 mins until cheese melted. This is our favourite salad for meals and sandwiches!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I did tweek it a bit for my familys taste. Used 1 more egg and split the relish... half sweet relish & half dill relish. Also split the mayo between Hellmans Light & light Miracle Whip. I also use green onions and regular or dijon mustard if i don't have the honey mustard. I've made this soooo many times & was told by my father-in-law that it was the best tuna salad he had ever had! Coming from him, that's a great compliment! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

The celery seed makes this delicious, outstanding tuna salad--one ingredient that is a must.  I added a 1/2 tsp of onion powder as I like onion in mine, so I just added this for the flavor. A definite keeper.

This combines the best components of my Mom's tuna salad (eggs & a touch of sweetness) and my MIL's (onion & dill pickle relish) as my husband and I have never seen eye to eye in this arena. I did have to skip the celery seed due to a health condition, so I added celery flakes instead. Thank you Graden for sharing your recipe! Now if my husband and I could only agree on how Beef Stew should be prepared...one recipe at a time, I suppose.

Been making this for over a year now.  I will never make tuna salad any other way.  I leave out the celery seed for my partner's sake. This recipe is perfect!!!  Flavor does get even better the next day,  if we have any left that is!

My husband loved this.  I had some extra bacon leftover from breakfast and threw it in too.  I didn't have any relish so I used chopped up dill pickles and they added a nice little crunch.  Great recipe!

The best tuna salad I have eaten in a long time!  I modified this to my family's personal taste by using sweet relish instead of dill and no onion.  The honey mustard added a surprising great flavor to the tuna and takes this recipe from good to great.  This recipe is a keeper!

I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill and omitted the celery seed.  This is especially good served on rye bread.

Delicious Tuna Salad!  I made this to have something different for our lunches.  The only ingredient I didn't use, due to personal taste, is the pickle relish.  I chilled the salad and served it over a bed of lettuce and veggies.  The next day we had it in a flour tortilla.  When making again, if I want it for more than 1 day, I will cut back on the mayonnaise a little.  It does get a little "soupy" after it sits overnight.  The flavor is still great, just a little wet for wraps.  Thanks Graden for sharing your recipe.

Good, but you know, to me, it tasted like pretty basic tuna salad, not anything different from what I've tasted befofre. I always make tuna salad the same way, so it tastes much different from what I usually do (which is very basic) but it tastes similar to prepackaged tuna salad, only chunkier. Which is fine if that's what you're going for! Don't get me wrong, it's good and I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it tasted diffewrent from many other tuna salads.

I was looking for a tuna salad recipe and picked this one. It really stretched a can of tuna to which was nice. I made 1/2 the recipe. I was pinched for time so left out the eggs, although I have used them before in chicken salad. I do not like celery seed at all, and find it over-powering, so I left that out. I did use all of the other ingredients, but the pepper I just added a small dash. I didn't have relish in the fridge so I chopped up some hamburger dill pickles to relish consistency. I had made my own honey mustard and used that. I even added about a teaspoon more as I really liked that added flavor. To cut back the saturated fat and calories, of regular mayonaise, I used Kraft mayo with olive oil and it worked fine. ty

This is super tuna salad. I used (3) 6.4 oz pouches of tuna in water instead of canned and 3 claussen dill pickles instead of the relish. I also added another stalk of celery. The whole family enjoyed it in pita pockets with romaine lettuce. This is how I make "tuna" from now on!

Made this tonight for myself with my wife out of town. It was quite easy and turned out great. I ended up changing it up a bit. I used green onions instead of sweet onions, halved the recipe and put some craisins in to add a bit of sweetness. Delicious!

Wow tuna salad wow! I normally hate tuna salad but my boyfriend just loves all things smothered in Mayo.  So I whipped up this dish for luches the other day and just can't stop making it.  So delicious.  You can add more of less of the relish, mustard mayo taste as you prefer but I found this recipe to be perfect!

This is a great tuna salad, everyone loved it!  I left out the salt & pepper, but only because I was having one of those days and actually forgot to put them in the recipe.  But even without the salt & pepper, it tasted fantastic.

This is very similar to the tuna salad I make, but I was curious about a couple of things that she suggested that I hadn't tried.  I made this as is, with a couple of changes only cause I feel they are minor and personal taste (no reflection on my thoughts on her recipe).  So I always use mayo, but I also use half salad dressing, so I split the recipe into half a cup each.  Also, I don't typically like honey mustard, too sweet.  I buy this stuff in the deli ( I can't recall the name) but it's in a bottle and says "sweet and spicy honey mustard".  I used that in this recipe and gave it a nice taste.  Only other thing I do sometimes, that I didn't do this time is add 1 Tbsp lemon juice.  Don't ask why, a friend taught me this years ago, it was how her grandma made it :)

Pretty good. I cut this in half. I didn't have pickle relish, so I used a couple chopped garlic dills. No celery seed so I omitted it. This helped us get rid of those last few hard boiled eggs from Easter.

Running low on mayo so I cut the recipe down to 3 servings. Still didn't have quite enough so I added just a bit of asiago peppercorn dressing...used old bay for seasoning salt & all I had was a honey dijon mustard so I used that. Had it for lunch on WW honey bread...very good! Thanks for the recipe!

I was craving tuna salad and liked the fact that there was honey mustard in this recipe. Something just a little different for me. I enjoyed it with a few crackers and didn't bother adding the salt. Tuna's got plenty. Threw in a few capers too. Thanks!

This is a tasty tuna salad.  I switch out some mayonnaise with light sour cream or plain yogurt.  The curry spice blended well with the other ingredients.

I simplify this recipe by only using the tuna, the mayonnaise, the eggs, the celery, and the seasoning salt.  Also, I use half the mayonnaise it calls for and about 3/4ths of the seasoning salt it calls for.

This is a very flavorful tuna salad. I had to use 5 cans of tuna because mine were 5 oz cans not 6 oz. I added two celery stalks because we love celery. Used sweet relish.  Did not have honey mustard so I used regular... 3/4 tablespoon and 1/4 tablespoon honey. Also used Adobe seasoned salt. I put all the ingrediants except the tuna in the food processor then added to the tuna. I Love this recipe

This is usually how I make my tuna salad...  Only tonight I will be adding bacon, lettuce and tomatoes.  I'm giving it a 5 star because I already know my family is going to love it!

I made a very minor change to this recipe.  I didn't have any celery seed, just celery salt so that's what I used and I omitted the reg. salt.  Oh, and I didn't have any honey mustard.  This is the best tuna salad I have ever made, by far!!!  (I also thought about adding this to macaroni and bell pepper to make pasta salad.  Or how about adding apples or grapes to this recipe?  Oh, so many wonderful ideas are going through my mind!) Thank you so much for this recipe, Graden!

I've never made tuna from a recipe before. I always just mixed tuna, mayo, onion and pickle relish together (sometimes ranch) and slapped it on a sandwich. I like the addition of the eggs the most, and the celery gives it a nice crunch!

i usually like my tuna salad with a lot of vinegar/mustard.. this was a nice change from the norm.. i dont like honey mustard so i used regular yellow mustard.. used shallot for the sweet onion.. and used chopped pepperocini in place of the relish.. loved the celery seed in this.. ate this on celery so didn't add the celery to the salad itself.. ty for the recipe

I don't use relish, I cut my pickles from whole. I also add about 1/4 cup of the juice before I add any other ingredients and stir it in with the tuna. Then I add about 2 tblsp. of dried dill and 1 tblsp. lemon pepper.

Love this recipe. I used Hickory smoked flavored tuna and southwest spicy mustard because that was what I had in the fridge. I also left out the celery, celery salt, and celery seeds because I didn't have any. I also used sandwich spread instead of regular mayonnaise. This was so different, but so delicious for sure!

Amazing!!! The only thing I didn't have on hand was celery seed.  Also I used sweet relish instead of dill, but that's just a matter  of preference.  I tasted it right after mixing and it was the best tuna salad I've ever made!  Thanks!

my first time making tuna salad and I thought it came out really well.  I didn't change the recipe (aside from using regular mustard and no celery since I didn't have celery). Quick, easy and a keeper

Loved loved loved this! First time making tuna salad with HB egg too, and it was great. My bf loved it for something different in his lunch and will be making it again. Skipped the red onion and swapped honey mustard for spicy brown mustard. May use a bit less mayo next time.

This was very good.  It's really filling with all the extra ingredients so a little bit goes a long way.  I found it to be true to scale in regards to the serving sizes.  I will make this again!

Awesome! I hate eggs so I eliminated them and I added a couple chopped jalapeno slices. I didn't have relish on hand so I chopped a dill pickle up. YUM. This is a keeper

Great tuna salad recipe. I skip the relish and use chopped dill pickles and also add cubed sharp cheddar. It goes great on whole wheat or crackers.

Okay, I've made tuna fish for years. Now all my children are grown except one. Her boyfriend came over and this tuna was gone in less than 2 hours. My whole family loved it. The only thing i did different was add fresh lemon juice and shredded carrots..this is by far the best..you go "New Wife"!!!!

The first taste is pretty strong with the onions and other flavors. My husband and I ate it on Ritz crackers and it became a very nice snack.  I agree that there was a good amount of egg, which I liked.

Tasty on good multigrain bread with a salad. I had to improvise a fair bit with the ingredients but followed the main idea with eggs, tuna, celery, onion, mustard, mayo and added herbs.

I am basing my review off the reaction this recipe created.  I took this and "summer chicken salad" to work.  I thought everyone would ooh and aah over the chicken. It was the tuna that had everyone going!  I got compliments all day.  I don't like tuna salad but of course I tried it.  I thought it was spicy and not even a hint of sweet.  Everyone else loved it, so that's fine with me!

This was very good tuna salad. The first bite I thought had too much celery taste, but after eating it, now I don't think that. I used honey mustard salad dressing, miracle whip light, celery salt instead of chopped celery, onion powder, doubled the pickle relish, and left out the egg. Such a wonderful recipe, I will definitely use this one again. My family devoured this and there is none left. Thanks for sharing this great tuna recipe!

Very ggod, though I'll use regular yellow or brown mustard next time instead of the honey mustard. The hint of sweetness was weird.

Sounds like how I make mine.  Except lessen the eggs to 3 or 4.  I add horseradish, diced green pepper, diced celery, dill and tarragon.  Heaven.

Very tasty! I omitted the celery and relish only because I didn't have any on hand, but it was still delicious. I would like to try it with celery next time for a little extra crunch. This definitely satisfied my craving for tuna salad!

Made as stated and it was really good on white, whole grain bread! Not sure what I would change in the future. I feel like something more could be added to make it 5 stars. I did really like it this way, though!

It's pretty close to the tuna salad my grandmother used to make, though a bit sweeter. Probably spot on with the celery and celery seed, both of which I didn't have.

Quick to make if you have the ingredients, otherwise the boiled egg is the longest-lead item. I made it using one 5oz can of tuna, 1 boiled egg, about twice as much sweet onion as it called for to produce two servings (because mine was getting extra weak from spending too much time in the onion saver in the fridge and I didn't have any celery), celery salt (due to lack of celery seed), McCormick Season-All (because childhood memories and I think this is what grandma used), dill relish (as specified), some sweet-hot mustard I had in the fridge (basically honey mustard), mayo, and a few twists of black pepper from the grinder.

I served it on spinach leaves instead of crackers; it was delicious.

Was similar to my usual, but the addition of the celery seed and the honey were really good.  I didn't add the hard boiled eggs because I was also making egg salad.  Really enjoyed!

Whenever I need a simple dinner or lunch option I keep coming back to this. I don't always follow the instructions exactly but it always turns out good. I use chopped up spicy pickles instead of relish which is too sweet for me. And I also use regular mustard instead of honey mustard. Sometimes I add chopped carrot if I want a little extra veggies in there. The raw onion is too strong for me, so I usually use less of that, or leave it out, or use something more mellow like green onions in its place.

I scaled this down because I only used one can of tuna, and it  was 5 oz. I used one hard-boiled egg and added mustard and honey in place of the honey mustard. When mixed, I wanted it a tad sweeter, so I added a little more honey. I also chopped up a small dill pickle in place of the relish. A different and delicious twist on standard tuna salad!

This is a great tuna salad! I wanted it to be smooth so I ran the tuna, eggs, mayo (using only a bit more than half a cup), and spices through the food processor. Then I pulsed the pickles and celery into small pieces and mixed it in. This was delicious and flavorful.

This reminds me of the tuna salad my mom always made. I made a few changes to make it more like hers-- cut back on the onion, used yellow mustard, and regular salt. My mom didn't like relish, but I like the relish in it.

I prepared this almost exactly as instructed with the exception of using green onions instead of sweet onions. This is the most delicious Tuna salad I have ever made it eaten. Brava!

Great recipe!   A little sweet for my taste but my fiancé liked it a lot.  I think next time I will experiment using something other than honey mustard.

While I made this exactly according to the recipe, and the family enjoyed it, I personally prefer a recipe where the tuna can be tasted. I really thought the flavor combination was so complex that the tuna itself got lost. Just my own personal notes for future consideration!

One of the best tuna salad recipes that I have tried. I did not have any pickle relish, so I had to skip it, yet the salad was still very good. 
This is my tuna salad recipe from now on :)

this is a very good recipe. I made it using regular yellow mustard and Tastefully Simples Seasoned Salt. Does not taste too fishy and the kids liked it.

Pretty good.  I did a few omissions.. which one was eggs.. only because I didn't have any.  Next time I'll try some eggs in it.  I also didn't add actual celery I used celery salt.  I also added 1 tsp of sugar and salt.  Overall it was a really good tuna fish!  I really like the added honey mustard as well it adds to the zip.  I prefer it zippy vs. plain/boring.  Thanks!

I have been shopping for a good tuna salad recipe for some time and haven't found won that made me want seconds.  I was a bit skeptical of this one because of the egg, but let me tell you it was amazing!!!  I made two batches in one week!  I kept the recipe fairly true, however I did change a few of the following things:  I omitted the celery seed, used green relish instead of the dill pickle and added dried dill to the recipe.  I also used a bold mustard!  Yum!

Amazing! My husband was very skeptical about merging egg salad with tuna salad, but we both devoured this. He had his on bread, I just ate mine plain. I followed the recipe, with only one change- I didn't have pickle relish, so I just chopped up pickle instead. I will absolutely make this recipe again.

To be fair, I don't really care for tuna salad but my husband does so I thought I'd give this a try.  Quite delicious.  I also used regular mustard (we didn't have honey mustard) and I had to skip the celery seed because I couldn't find it!  I served this salad on toasted bread with shredded cheddar cheese.  My husband had seconds! Yum.

I wish we could give 1/2 stars here- I probably would give this a 3.5.  This is good a little different than how I usually make my tuna.  I didn't have dill relish just sweet, although, I actually prefer dill.  If I made again I would omit the celery seed.  I always find it to be bitter and with the real thing in it I didn't think it needed it.  I liked the idea of the hard boiled eggs.  Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't willing to hard boil any eggs, and I'm not a big fan of onions (I'll  use in cooking, but not raw), so I left out those ingredients.  I added in some dried minced onions for the onion flavor.  Not quite enough pickle flavor for me, but I'm a bit of a pickle freak.  I like the celery and celery seed in this tuna salad.  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have the mustard or the dill relish, but I DID have hotdog relish (which also contains mustard) and it came out terrific!  Tastes great as a tuna melt with whole wheat bread, too.

Really enjoyed this "kicked-Up" rendition of T.S.
