This recipe turned out very well. I used 3/4 inch delmonico rib eye steaks. They were very juicy and tender. I used a sweet brown sugar BBQ sauce. The cooking time worked well for the size of steaks I bought. Great recipe!

As a Kosher Jew this worked fine for me without the bacon of course. Everything on the ingredients can early be found Kosher and the steaks can be cooked well enough to do away with any blood. Makes a dinner fit to share with the Rabbi.

This marinade is amazing.  I've always thought I couldn't cook steaks on a grill, but I followed this recipe carefully and my steaks were truly incredible.  I was so proud!!! (I left off the bacon...didnt need it.)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great.  We rarely eat steak these days but this was a great way to eat it for sure.  Easy as long as you have time to marinate it!  We will cook this again for others for sure.

If you find the bacon is not getting done when moving to indirect heat, try cooking the bacon indoors until about half-done.   You could also fully cook it indoors and put it on the steak during the glazing.

The flavor was alright, with the times listed, my very nice ribeye was vastly OVER done, and the Bacon was nearly still raw.  I wound up having to cook the bacon further once I brought it inside.

Good flavor, but my husband complained about the bacon grease dripping onto the coals, creating fire flare-ups.

The bacon grease was a problem, so I took it off half way through. Great steak though! Family LOVED it!

This is probably one of the best marinades I have tried.  I am always looking for something new, but I think I will be using this one for a long time!

We liked the flavor butwere perplexed by the bacon. I don't know if I liked this enough to make it again and would probably give it closer to a three but my husband liked the flavor a great deal.

My husband & I agreed completely on this one. The steak was very tender & juicy but the bbq sauce took away from the whole "steak taste". Will not try again.

Used sirloin not ribeye.  Did rub and timing the same.  I marinated one hour not four.  I used one 12oz can of coke not two. I spread one side of steak with barbeque sauce.  It was favorful, juicy and turned out to be medium rare.

I just didn't think this is something I will try again. The steak did remain juicy even if it was overcooked by my husband's standards but this just didn't do it for me. Sorry.
