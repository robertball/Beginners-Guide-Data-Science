I have made this recipe.  One hint:  cook pasta as directed.  Marinate several hours (up to overnight) in Italian dressing.  Also, add artichokes to marinade if purchased plain).  Thread as directed.

These were SO delicious!  I think you're right about marinating the tortillini - they simply sang with flavor.   Used the Fabulous Greek salad dressing mix (already had on hand) for marinade.  These were great with sliced pepperoncini as well.  Thanks so much for recipe.

Guests gobbled these up!  I assembled the night before and placed in a large baking dish and covered in Newmanâ€™s  light balsamic to marinate overnight.  Perfect for a buffet, easy and delicious!
