This is an excellent chicken salad with minor tweaks. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the mustard was too much. I reduced the mustard in half and I think I actually could have reduced it further with 1 tablespoon total. I will use sliced green onion the next time too. Come to think of it, a few more cherries would be nice also......maybe as a garnish. Make sure you make ahead and chill to blend flavors. I served this over romaine with a handfull of candied pecans to garnish. Thanks CHARISMOM this was very good and is going into my salad rotation.

Very good. My wife and daughter prepared it according to the recipe last night. They served it in pita pockets. The basic chicken salad would be good by itself but the dried cherries add a note that makes it memorable.
I wonder if there are any leftovers?

Loved it.  I used dried sweet bing cherries.  Worth a trip to Trader Joe's for the cherries.  I served it on a croissant for a treat.

I liked this a lot. I served mine on croissants. Next time I will add a little less mustard though.

I make this chicken salad often.  The recipe is delicious as is. 
Everyone I've ever served it to liked it very much.  I sometimes make it without onion and it's still great.

I am always looking for a good dressing to put on cherry chicken salad and this one was great. The Dijon mustard is a new twist for me and I hesitated to use all that it said. I thought 2 TBL was enough for the chicken amount. It was better after the flavors blended together the next day, though. I'll definitely use it again.

This is a favorite for summer boating. I serve it wrapped in a tortilla, or other flat bread, with lettuce. We like 1/4 to 1/2 cup blue cheese mixed in too. I think it compliments the cherries nicely.

I have been trying various chicken salad recipes from this site over the summer and this one is by far my favorite one.  The only thing I changed was I cut down to 2 tbs of Dijon mustard per other reviews, but I think it would be fine as written too.
