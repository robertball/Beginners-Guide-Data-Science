Since the other review said it was bland I added a few things. I added some pepper, italian seasoning, and a sprinkle of italian seasoned bread crumbs (I had some I wanted to use up) to the meat. I also topped it with grated parmesan cheese. Oh, and I used green bell peppers. It turned out really great! I served it with bread and butter with a bit of garlic salt sprinkled on it. It went really good with it. It was a hit with my Husband, I will make this again for sure!

We tried these the other night! They were GREAT! I made them with these changes: I used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned, added some chopped baby bella mushrooms, italian seasoning, a little extra garlic, pepper, and I used parmesan instead of cheddar.  I was out of chicken broth so I used beef instead. Super Tastey! My husband and I both really enjoyed them. I will use this recipe again!

These really are easy!  My family really liked them, but I found a little more flavor was needed. I added more herbs and Worcestershire sauce.  I "overstuffed" pepper HALVES which I softened briefly in the microwave. The chicken broth isn't really necessary, it just adds an additional savory element.  These freeze extremely well, so I made up a few lunch containers that my husband can just "grab and go!"  Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this very much.  It was definitely easy to make and was on the table quite quickly.  I followed some other reviewers' advice and added some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.

Great filling, but need to cook longer as peppers were a little underdone for our taste.

Needs more flavor. I will adjust the recipe next time. It wasn't bad, just lacking in flavor.

A nice change to use up some ground beef.  I also added rice, salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings.  Nice flavor and fairly easy to prepare.

It needs a little worcesterhire sauce. This adds the flavor it needs. I used my fresh roma tomatoes from my garden, and some fresh parsley as well.  Thanks for posting!

I used a combo of red, yellow and orange bell peppers. And pepper jack cheese in place of cheddar, although I think cheddar would be good as well. I think in the case of the blandness, the pepper jack cheese compensated for it. And I opted for a baking dish rather than muffin tins, I can't imagine that could work out well without being prepared for spill over in the bottom of the oven.

Turned out incredibly well. Added salt, pepper, Italian Seasoning and rice. Used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Accidentally forgot about the chicken broth and cheddar cheese.  It all fit into 4 large red bell peppers. Baked for 40 minutes until a good portion of the skin wrinkled.  Peppers were too large to fit into the muffin tins I had on hand but used the idea of open air vertical baking by standing them into small loaf pans. Will try it with the cheese next - didn't seem to need the broth, probably because I added partially cooked rice.

This recipe is amazing. The chicken broth and the cheese really add a fantastic flavor. I added salt and rice and I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomato's. It was a great success.

No flavor.  I wish I had read reviews about adding seasonings but was in a hurry to get dinner on table.  Peppers were very hard.  The recipe said cook 30 min and then the sidebar that I didn't notice until later said cook 40 min. Needs rice and seasonings to make better.

Very easy way to do stuffed peppers. I will probably spice up the beef a bit more next time, and put more veggies in it, like mushrooms.

These turned out great, wish I kept a picture of them. Juicy and tender in the middle but crisp on the outside, can’t wait to make more.

Have a picky eater who loved these and ate up all the leftovers while I was at a meeting two evenings later. In my book, that is a win because I struggle to find things he will eat. I don't like eating the same thing over and over. Might experiment with mixing additional veggies in next time.

I made this recipe almost as written.  I didn't use the broth to pour over the peppers.  My husband just loved the peppers as made.  I am used to peppers cooked in a tomato sauce.  I have to admit that the flavor was really good, we just added a little bit of seasoned salt.  The recipe is very quick and easy and you really don't have a big mess on your hands.  Good recipe.  Thank you ChefDaddyo!

This was the first time that I made stuffed peppers. I did as others suggested and added salt,  pepper and Italian seasoning. I split the peppers in half because it seemed easier. The yellow peppers worked great. This was easy to assemble and turned out fabulous! Great flavor. Thank you for sharing. Making this weekend for dinner guests.

It's was decent but a little bland. We'd recommend using a spicier pepper or adding some zing to it.. also, make sure you drain the tomatoes or don't use soup. Ours was watery and we didn't use soup.

I used ground turkey and seasoned meat while cooking. I used low fat shredded cheese for a healthier version. I also used green and colored peppers. My fiancée and 5 year old loved it. They are already requesting it again.
