Without a doubt the best Hot meat sauce I have ever tasted ! I made it exactly as written. It has Just the right amount of spice and even a little kick. We cannot eat hot dogs without it and this is a staple at every cook out.  I also froze it in several small containers and use when needed.  Everyone loves this recipe! 5 stars all the way

"THE BOMB"  Thankyou thankyou.  This recipe is marvelous as written.  I held back on the black pepper and red pepper some.  I think it would of been better if I would of just added them.  This stuff is pretty hot.  Whoever doesnt like hot stuff isn't going to like this anyway, so go for it.  This reminds me of Betty's world Famous Hotdogs sauce.

This is my hot sauce recipe and if you make it and it is too spicy for you add a cinnamon stick to it and let it sit overnight in the fridge and the cinnamon stick will help mellow the spice. As I said in my description play with the amount of heat but this will become a staple for every BBQ you will have.

On vacation w 13 friends from upstate NY and needed a quick easy meat sauce for our garbage plates (google it). I added diced onions, nutmeg and paprika. Simmered in a crock pot for three hours to perfection. They all loved it.

Love this hot sauce!!! Only addition I made was to sprinkle in some mixed cinnamon and sugar. We make it for every cookout and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!

Kathy, this was delish!  I did have to substitute V-8 for the tomato juice since I don't ever buy plain tomato juice.  Hubby
loved it!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This is a great base recipe for a basic meat hot sauce! I ended up adding some additional ingredients - Garlic powder, ground clove and a touch of cinnamon. It was delicious and went great on our Garbage Plates.
