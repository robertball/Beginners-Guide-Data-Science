Far far too much vinegar. It over powered the entire sauce. Maybe if it were decreased by maybe half this sauce would be far better. Sadly we will not give this version a second go.

reduce amount of vinegar by nearly half. Beat eggs & butter with cooled vinegar mix until fluffy. Microwave half way through cooking beat again till fluffy very easy.

Vinegar sauce. Chefs say that Bearnaise Sauce is tricky and this short cut doesn't cut it even close. Skip this recipe.

drop the vinegar amount to 1/4 cup and use champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar. Also did not use a microwave but a double boiler:)

As is the sauce has way too much vinegar and tasted nothing like a bernaise sauce. I made a second batch using about 1 & 1/2 tbsp. vinegar fresh tarragon and 1 tbsp. of cream just to be able to use it. I was also not a fan of the microwave method. It didn't thicken up as much as I would like.Unfortunately I can't recommend this recipe.

When I microwaved the sauce the last time it ended up cooking the egg. Do you microwave it on half power?
