Pretty good, especially on the BBQ. Peanut sauce is a quite bland and it helped to add a little soy sauce.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that this one goes over really well with the kids.  On a personal note, I think that I would add more spice to the sauce, but then, the kids might not like it :)  I would highly recommend trying this recipe though.

Not bad, but way too salty.  It was also a little bland -- no texture.  On the whole, it was a disapointing experience given the rave reviews.

This recipe was excellent.  Fast, easy, and I had everything on hand.  My kids are not big meat eaters, but they did enjoy spearing their peas with the skewers.  I served this with cous cous.  I would even make this for party food.

It was very good - although not a favorite.
Will make again on occasion.

Good, but not the best.  The sauce has a very strong peanut butter taste.  It is like dipping the chicken into regular peanut butter, so if you aren't a fan of it don't bother.  The smell isn't bad, but it is very strong and tends to linger in the house.  I probably would make it again, but next time I will adjust the sauce for more flavor.

This is pretty good. the marinate is great. i have used pretty much this exact recipe for a chicken marinade for years.(except no b.sugar, more oil, and fresh shredded ginger) its good by itself for the kabobs, grilled chicken and the grilled chicken is great in green sauce chicken enchiladas.-i need to submit that one. my husbands and I's fav. the peanut sauce seemed to be "missing something" it was ok. i think i used too big of an onion and i added some sugar to try and sweeten it some. its decent but i might try to find another peanut sauce and try this again.

The chicken came out very tasty without the peanut sauce. though with the peanut sauce it was also fantastic, I just had to add extra hot sauce and nuts. I will probally use this for party food.

A yummy dinner, and fun because it's on a stick.  I had some trouble getting the peanut butter sauce to be thin, had to add extra water.

I liked that kabobs, but not the sauce. I think you can find better sauce recipes elsewhere.

Make a lot of this recipe, it goes quick. I added a little milk to the peanut sauce and it really made a big difference.

My husband I really enjoyed this recipe, and the kids liked the  chicken without the peanut sauce.  Next time I think I'll add a little more pepper sauce to kick it up a notch.  Served with couscous, it was a real treat.

We don't have children so I cannot verify the kid-friendliness of this recipe, but my husband and I sure do love it!  So good, the peanut sauce is optional.

This tastes great, and would have been better if I marinated it longer.  As it is, I'm very lazy and didn't.  I used the hot peanut sauce recipe with this...now a weekly feature.
