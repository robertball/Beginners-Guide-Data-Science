I'm always looking for banana recipes because my younger daughter Tyler devours them. I omitted the orange zest and used real eggs. I also spread a bit of her "soy butter" (tastes similar to peanut butter; she's allergic to the real stuff) on both slices of bread and continuted with the recipe. My little teenage monkey loved this version of french toast.

I've always loved french toast, and this was a great variation with the orange zest. 

I made for 2 only (ie, 4 breads to make 2 french toasts) and used 2 eggs, whilst downsizing everything else. I didn't have the vanilla extract on hand and used vanillin sugar instead, and it turned out fine. I'm sure it'll become a regular to our usual french toast breakfasts.

Wow, I really like the addition of orange zest to french toast.  Yum!  I only made 2 sandwiches so I really eyeballed the amounts and just used this recipe for the idea.  I know I added tons extra orange zest (about 1 teaspoon for 2 sandwiches) and am glad I did.  I used a regular whole wheat bread, and I think it would have been better with white bread but that's just personal preference.  I think in the future instead of making a stuffed sandwich I'll just top the french toast with some bananas sauteed with some brown sugar and cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe, especially the orange zest idea.  That really made the french toast special!

Husband didn't care for this at all. I'll stick with making him regular French toast. Thanks anyway.
