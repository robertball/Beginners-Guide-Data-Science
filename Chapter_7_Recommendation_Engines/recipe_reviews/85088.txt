I served this rice today to 40 people, along with "Baked Havarti Chicken".  What a superb meal fit for Royalty! High praises to me, Thanks to you!  Only suggestion I can offer is to go light on the Cardamom.

I gave this recipe a three.  I really liked it, but my husband said that cinnamon and rice just shouldn't go together and there was something wrong with it.  I enjoyed the spiced flavor and found it a really nice change from regular white rice.  I didn't have cashews, raisins or mango on hand so left those out.

This recipe was excellent.The combination of all the flavors together make this recipe. If you are missing one or more ingredients it will not taste right.

My mango wasn't ripe, but that is not the recipe's fault. It had a good taste anyway.

Cooked this to accompany Malaysian Beef Rendang (by Trevor Hobson) - what a divine taste combination. Talk about the spice of life!
