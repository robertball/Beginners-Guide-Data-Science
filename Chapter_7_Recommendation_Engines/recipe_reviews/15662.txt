This is a wonderfully different sort of cake. My great grandma made this when I was a kid, when she lost her mind to alzheimer's disease the recipe went with her. The only thing I can say is that I think there may have been a typo on the baking time. I baked this for an hour instead of thirty minutes and it came out great. Due to the oil content of the cake the toothpick came out clean even though it was not all the way done. Also, I remember when my grandma made this she poked holes in the cake for the topping to seep into the cake which I think makes it all the more better.

This cake is delicous, especially for fall.  I cut the oil in it!  I sub'd 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil for the 1 1/2 cups oil it asked for.  The cake was perfect!!!

I haven't made the recipe yet, but a friend did and it was fabulous.  Hint: My friend made the cake the night before and it seemed to moist and runny so got up in the morning and cooked it a while longer and it was great.

Excellent cake...moist and yummy.  I shredded the apples instead of chopping them for a smoother consistency.

Add cinnamon - use at least a half of a cup more sliced apples - up to a cup more.  Bake longer.  This is one of our family's favorite recipes!

Batter baked for 45 minutes in tube pan, yet failed to cook through to the center. Maybe too many "wet" ingredients (calls for 4 cups of apples)?
 
Sweetness of cake made caramel topping superfluous. For fans of dense, sugary cakes only.

Excellent! I made this for a pitch-in that had a German food theme. I took the suggestion to use 3/4 cup applesause and 1/4 cup oil instead of all oil and it turned out just fine. Next time though, I will put the cake on a plate that will hold all the extra carmel icing that falls away from the cake.

The cake was somehow dry even with 1 1/2 cups of oil and 4 cups of apples. I had to cook it for almost an hour for the center to be done and by then the outside was hard. I love the caramel topping and if this cake wasn't doused in that I wouldn't bother eating it.

This is the 2nd time I have made a German Apple Cake. The first was using a different recipe in a cooking class. I followed this exactly as it is written here only in both cases the cakes took 1 hr to bake. Its worth the wait! Delicious it wasn't dry  or overly mushy. If you want a sweet dessert do not skip the caramel sauce as the cake itself is not that sweet (this may depend on sweetness of your apples too I guess). I drizzled the cake with about a quarter of the caramel sauce and then reserved the rest in a small container in case others need more. I did myself once go back and get more sauce. Its great with whipped topping and if you didn't have caramel sauce whipped topping would make a good (less sweet) substitute.

this is a really good cake, but it took an hour to bake instead of 35 minutes as instructed.  i also added cinnamon and nutmeg as i felt it would be bland without it.

This cake was good but I felt that it would have been even better if I had added cinnamon, clove, allspice, etc. If I make this again I would add some of those spices to the batter. My caramel sauce harded up on the cake but that was O.K.

Takes about an hour in a tube pan. Delicious! I substituted pecans for the walnuts. I love the fact that this cake doesn't use cinnamon with apples. The result is a much more German flavor and not so American "apple pie."  I've made this twice now  - reducing the oil to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup plain no-fat yoghurt. It's better with the 1 1/2 cups oil, but if you're trying to reduce the fat content, this substitution works okay.

I made this recipe tonight and my friends loved it. The only things i did differently were caramelizing the apples beforehand with brown sugar and cinnamon, adding chai tea mix to the dry ingredients, and using a bundt cake cupcake pan to make them smaller. There is enough batter to make roughly 30 little bundt cakes. The chai tea mix makes the cake taste better and caramelizing the apples guarantees that the apples are soft when you finish baking them. Just remember to shorten the baking time for the little ones.

Waste of good apples. All I can taste is oil. I'm so confused about the positive reviews this has received. I'm tossing it. Blah.

Caramel Sauce was amazing on this cake. However, I found the cake to be a bit oily. I would replace some of the oil with apple sauce or use butter rather than oil next time. But overall, a quick and yummy cake.

My Husband likes this cake and he's pretty particular about what he'll eat (dessert wise). So, after reading all the reviews I thought it might be wise to bake a "test" cake first using my convection oven for 1 hour. I didn't use as much oil, and still felt what I did use was still too much, being a cook, I could taste the oil a little too much, I added a bit of butter to the batter, put lemon juice over the apples to keep them looking fresh, added some cinnamon (since I love it). It cooked through perfectly! And after the taste test, I made 2 more, yes, 2 more for an October Fest event scheduled for the next day. I'm hopeful they will love it too.

Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing  this because I didn't make the glaze (I wanted to cut calories). Perhaps the glaze transforms it - the cake itself is rather bland a bit dry.

Turned out nice and moist in a bunt cake pan. I didn't have any nuts, but added  Cranberries
 instead. It gave it a fruitier taste. The caramel topping is perfect for this cake.

DANG the batter and glaze are delicious. I cut the oil by 1/4 cup and added an extra cup of chopped apples, like others said. I hate dealing with tube pans, so I made 2 8" rounds and layered them in a pool of caramel heaven.

Mmm! My grandma and I always bake very unoriginal things but we decided to change it up and this was an awesome surprise! The caramel topping is delicious, next time we make it we will substitute some oil with applesauce though.

Made this for a luncheon and everyone loved it.  It was moist and delicious.  I made it (in a tube pan) the day before, poked holes with a bamboo skewer in the cake as soon as it came out of the oven and then poured the sauce over.  All the sauce sank into the cake.  I baked it for 75 minutes because my oven seems to be off lately.  I will definitely make this one again.

Baked longer as suggested and it came out absolutely wonderful!  The aroma in my house was amazing!  Thank you for sharing.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made one and didn't cook it long enough.  When I made the glaze it was too heavy and squashed the not-fully cooked cake.  I immediately made a second, cooked it long enough, but didn't use the glaze.  I frosted it with white frosting and it was a total hit at our family german fest dinner.

This cake is perfect just the way it is. The batter did scare me, because it was very stiff, but after I added the apples and walnuts, it was fine. I slapped chopped my fuji apples and that may be what gave it the "juice" it needed. I did have to bake it for 60 minutes too. To make it healthier next time I will add 1/2 apple sauce instead of all oil, 1/2 whole wheat flour instead of all white flour and throw in some flax seed. May use some fall spices, but I really do love it as-is.
