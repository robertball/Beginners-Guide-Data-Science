I found this recipe to be quick easy and delicious. I also found that frozen corn can be used and is equally good.

Great with grilled beef. You can also use canned kidney or pinto beans. I like to add sliced green onion and a pinch of chili powder just before serving.

I bet fresh chopped cilantro would put it over the top.

Excellent! I made this with the slow cooker cilantro lime chicken and some tortillas and it was a big hit!  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed.

I expected it to be more "corn". I cut up the green peppers to about the size of the corn and used olive oil instead of canola oil. Still excellent!
