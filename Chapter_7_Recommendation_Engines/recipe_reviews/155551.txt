I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the egg whites before mixing and only used half the sugar and these were AMAZING! Everyone was singing my praises.

I doubled the recipe and easily made about 40 good-sized macaroons. I found that if I only baked them for 10 minutes instead of 12, they kept their snow-ball white look with golden brown tips. Pretty and tasty! At 12 minutes, you get a browner, chewier macaroon. Still tasty, less snowbally.

These cookies were just what I was looking for in a macaroon recipe, but they were a bit to sweet. I know I will make them again, but with a little less sugar!

WOW!!!  So easy to make, and wonderful.  I made these for a Christmas dinner at my Mom's, and had multiple people tell me that they are better than the traditional sticky kind.  I ran out and had to make a second batch.  Also, you must be making HUGE macaroons to only get a dozen.  I got 18-20 making normal size cookies.  Thanks.

Amazing!!   Added 1 tsp of vanilla to the egg whites and didn't have sweetened coconut so I used unsweetened.   After the Macaroons cooled, I dipped them in melted semi sweet chocolate!!  They look amazing and taste delicious!  It's a saver!!

Possibly one of the quickest recipes I have ever made.  5 minutes (or less) from cracking the eggs to oven.  These were so simple and very good.  If you like an airy, sweet macaroon with a sticky tangle of coconut, these are perfect.  I baked on parchment for 12 minutes.

This is a winner! This made exactly 12 macaroons using a 1-Tablespoon cookie scoop. Per previous recommendations, I cut the sugar in half (total 1/4 cup per batch) and I use unsweetened coconut flakes (because that's all that I had). In the next batch, I will try the 1 teaspoon of almond extract and unsweetened shredded coconut. Once cooled, I dipped half the macaroon into melted dark chocolate (see my photos). Let's just say that the 1st batch disappeared and now I can't wait to make a second batch.

Tasty and easy recipe. Absolutely no fuss. The texture was great to work with.

I made Coconut Macaroons III and hated them, which is how I came upon this recipe... it's MUCH better and deserves better reviews.

Delish.  Made these for a party.  Fortunately or unfortunately, only 2 of us like coconut so between the two of use we nearly wiped them out.  Impossible to resist and so simple.  Much less messy than eating the coconut straight out of the bag!

These are very good and very easy starter recipe you can custonize. I intend to try adding walnuts and crystalized ginger. Dried cherries would be great too! This recipe makes a lot more than 12 cookies they puff up a lot, use a small spoon to put on greased cookie sheet. Don't bake for full time without checking, the cookies will look white on top but may be burned on the bottom if you aren't careful.

Yum! I made these for a Passover Seder and they were a hit! I cut the sugar in half, and I melted some dark chocolate chips, and dipped the cooled macaroons in the chocolate. I will definitely make these again!

This is the first time  I have made Macaroons, these turned out lovely! I followed some of the reviews, doubled the recipe... added vanilla, increased coconut level, sub'd unsweetened coconut, decreased level of sugar to 1/3 cup, and as I used a small cookie scoop I got approximately 68 macaroons out of the changes.

These were wonderful! The first batch I made exactly according to the recipe. And they were great. Save your self time double the recipe the first time. Bc then I needed to make a second batch. So in the second batch I tried one of the other review suggestions and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Holy cow! I didn't think these could get better but they were mind blowing with the vanilla. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies were absolutely yummy! I read the reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste (my favorite baking secret) and they were perfect! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based on the raves it got from guests at our Passover Seder. Macaroons are a traditional dessert at Passover because they don't have any flour, which is prohibited during this Jewish holiday. These were fun and easy to make, and people were impressed that they were homemade. They were a bit too sweet for my own tastes, but apparently not for others since they were gobbled up. I added a bit of vanilla and baked them on a non-stick silicone mat. They unexpectedly turned an odd shade of pink in my oven, though--I'm not sure why. I will try them again next year and wouldn't be surprised if they become an annual favorite. Thanks jollygreen23!

I made macaroons for the first time for our family Passover Seder.  Everyone went nuts over them!
They were so easy to make!!!  On the last batch I ran out of vanilla extract so I used marshmallow flavored vodka.  Everyone went triple nuts over those.  I think I might use less sugar the next time though If I were to make any changes at all.

Very easy and great tasting cookies! I used 1 tsp. almond extract as another reviewer mentioned, also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used unsweetened coconut. Still plenty sweet if you are watching your sugar intake. Yum!

Great recipe, easy and fast to prepare.  Good for 'bring a plate' kinda thing or last minute option.  I would make it again but probably cut the sugar back to 1/2 as I find it too sweet.  (Maybe our coconut here are far too sweet here - New Zealand)

These were yummy, but the texture was a little weird to me.  I think they would have been better with just a little bit of flour to hold everything together.

Amazing! Simple recipe. I used unsweetened coconut flakes, mainly because sweetened coconut flakes have propylene glycol as an ingredient. They turned out great, not too sweet, perfect texture and sweetness.

My macaroons rose beautifully in the oven, but as soon as they came out, they went flat. Don't know where I went wrong. I usually score big on my first attempts. But this was not a good result for me. Think will stick to my cookies, cakes, and pies instead.

We love this recipe at my house!  I add a dash of almond extract for a little more of a nutty flavor and I also chop the coconut up finer.  With or without these changes the recipe is fantastic!!  These macaroons practically melt in your mouth.  YUM!!

Excellent and easy recipie.  Made em for my husband that had never had macaroons and he loved em.  Used only half the sugar and they are plenty sweet.  Left em in the oven a couple of minutes longer, they still came out great!

Delicious,  but I’d rename this recipe to “marshmallowy macaroons “.  This is not a traditional macaroon at all. My 3-star rating is because, as recommended, I cut sugar in half & added almond extract. While they are tasty & easy, I wouldn’t want to disappoint guests by calling them macaroons.

The macaroons taste amazing.  I suggest using slightly less sugar if you don't want something completely sweet.  Next time I make it, I'm going to try salted caramel in it.

Doubled the recipe, but used only the minimum sugar required to achieve a glossy meringue (about 2 tbsp). If you use sweetened coconut, you really don't need to add any extra sweetness. 

I made 20 from the batch. Approximately 20 minutes at 375 C gave nice browned tips with soft centres.

These were good although a little sweet for me but I will adjust sugar the next time. I prefer egg white macaroons as opposed to sweetened condensed milk so this recipe hits home.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of the coconut as I didn't want to leave it in the bag in the cupboard.  These cookies are wonderful!  Light, sweet, and delightful.  The best part is that I can serve them to my family and not worry about putting out a treat that those with celiac disease can't have...there is NO flour in them!

I followed the advice from other reviewers and halved the sugar. They were delicious! Plenty sweet, partly due to using sweetened shredded coconut.  Very easy to make.  I kept thinking "I can't believe I've never made these before." I will definitely be making these again!

I like them  a lot, but I couldn't find unsweetened coconut  at the store and sweetened coconut makes them way too sweet. Use  unsweetened coconut. Overall its a great recipe though.

As instructed I used a teaspoon to drop the mixture onto the tray, however even with heaped teaspoons, I've ended up with about 30. I guess they were too small and the first batch were in for 12mins, but this seems to be slightly too long- they are a tad too dark all over- they still taste ok, but don't look as appealing. I reduced heat to 170 for the next batch and reduced cooking time to 10mins and these came out more like the the pic- White with touches of golden brown. Perhaps they were supposed to be table spoon heaps, however I do prefer this smaller size. Anyway, even though they were difficult (for me at least) to get the temp and time right, I've ended up with more than expected and they taste pretty yum!

I doubled batch as cookies just disappear at our house.  I add cream of tartar about 1/2 tsp for dble batch and almond extract 1tsp.  I decreased the sugar to just under 3/4 cups.  Omg they look and taste awesome.  I am going to dip half in dark chocolate.  Have never mastered these before wondering if it is the kitchen aid mixer we got.  They were never this beautiful consistency before.  So easy too!

These r super easy and very good. I followed a tip from another review and used a bit less sugar and and added a bit of vanilla. I also ground about 12 almonds into powder (about a 1/4 cup) and added that to my coconut, using about 1 3/4 cup coconut. They are beautiful and toasted looking. Super easy!!

PERFECT! I was looking for a simple macaroon recipe that I could make that's relatively low carb. Since I used Bob's Red Mill Unsweetened Coconut, this fits the bill and it's still plenty sweet.

Made these for christmas, they were the first cookies gone! I didn't have a melon baller or cookie scoop, so I just made them with a tablespoon size "stack". They turned out with, nice crunchy edges and chewy inside, not too sweet and very light, Every one wanted more! Next time I will double it!

I thought these were  just OK and I won't be making them again.  I will opt for a recipe that's more cookie-like so it gets some crunch or texture.

I love restaurant macaroons, but I had a tough time with my first batch! That was until I figured out that I beated it for too long. I re-did the batch and it was great! Not as great as Sue's though.

These are delicious!  Like others did, I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I baked them on parchment paper.  They had a sweet custard taste.  My family loved them.

I made it as written; I thought it was okay, but my daughter thought it was wonderful. The cookies were kind of like meringues with coconut added.  Second time around, I increased the salt to almost 1/4 teaspoon and the coconut to 3 cups, and I added about 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  I liked it much better after the change.  They were chewier and richer-tasting.

I burned them twice! I adjusted the time down to 9 minutes. I tried without parchment as stated and with parchment. I like that i did not need to add sweetened condensed milk to this recipe all the other ones seemed to need that.

Very easy. And I took someone else's recommendations from the reviews and added almond extract too. Melted chocolate chips in the microwave for a minute or so and pipe on with a baggie to decorate with chocolate.

THE recipe I have been looking for.  Just like the macaroons I learned to make as a child.  I made a double recipe because I had 4 egg whites leftover, and added 1 tsp of Vanilla extract. I also drizzled with melted dark chocolate to entice my husband to try them, he LOVED them!  I took the rest to work (so I wouldn't eat them all myself! LOL) and they were gobbled up immediately!  I'll definately be making these again.

Maybe I did the whipping wrong (?) but mine turned out a bit goopey and crumbly. Not the nice round coconut ball I was expecting, but my husband loved the flavour and ate them all up, so that was good!

Excellent & easy recipe!  For some reason, I thought whipping the egg whites by hand would be a good idea... not so much.  I never achieved more than soft peaks.  However, I persevered anyways, and they came out great!  I baked for them for 15 minutes (I made them large, and we like them chewy) then dipped them in melted semisweet chocolate chips once cool.  Fantastic and even more moist after a night in Tupperware!

Amazing!  So much lighter than traditional macaroons!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 3 squares of melted baker's chocolate after adding the sugar and getting stiff peaks.  It was the perfect complement to the coconut and a great way to satisfy a chocolate craving (and adds less than 20 extra calories)!  Will be making these again - thanks!

amazing - they were great out of the oven, and yummier still the next day - chewier.  i don't know about the day after that.  there were no more.  i'm craving them again - will make them in the morning.  my changes:  unsweetened coconut and sucanat instead of white sugar.  then there's totally no guilt in eating them all myself
