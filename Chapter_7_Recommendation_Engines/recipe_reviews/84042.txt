Excellent!!  This is the 4th pound cake I've tried from this site and I've finally found a keeper.  It's exactly what a pound cake should be in flavor and texture: dense, moist and rich.  I did increase the vanilla to 1.5 tablespoons, used the mace (it gives a nice sublte aroma, but taste wise, you can't tell it's there), and when I don't have sour cream, I've subsituted it with plain yogurt (both the lowfat or whole milk works) and decrease the temp to 325. Like other posters, mine baked perfectly at 1 hour 10 min. too.  This cake holds up very well, and as long as you keep it covered, it's stays moist for a good 3 days.  Good old fashion ingredients that gives you a classic pound cake.  TIP - whip the heck out of the butter/sugar (until very pale and fluffy) and whip even more when combining the eggs.  But once you add the flour, fold it in BY HAND ONLY or else you'll get a tough cake.  Also, if your cake is browning too quickly half way through, just lightly cover it with foil.  This will be my master pound cake recip.

To say this is a "moist" pound cake is a misnomer.  It is a "butter saturated" pound cake. To discuss using lemon versus mace, no mace, more vanilla, less sugar, more sugar, adding baking powder, etc., isn't even important. None of it matters unless you reduce the butter in this recipe to 1-1/2 cups.  Only then can variations be relevant. Even tho' as an experienced baker I knew better when I saw 2 cups of butter in this recipe (when most others would call for half that) I foolishly went ahead with this as written anyway, mistakenly assuming  100+ glowing reviews couldn't be wrong. Live and learn--they were wrong. Before making this, please do check out other pound cake recipes and compare the ratio of butter to flour--you will find this is an extraordinary amount of butter for the amount of flour which will NOT result in the dense, moist, fine crumb so prized in a good pound cake.

I've been looking for a moist heavy poundcake and this is it. I did make two small changes. I omitted the mace. I wanted a rich buttery stand alone cake that would marry with berries.  Removing the mace gave me what I wanted. I also added a 1/4 tsp of baking powder. The result is a silky cake that's heavy, but has some air in it. Just perfection.

I was very pleased with this recipe. It gave me a cake that had a good texture and taste. I did make two technical adjustments and one based on personal preference. I added the 1/4 tsp. baking powder mentioned by other reviewers, and I added 3 Tbsp vanilla because mine is weak (if you have stronger extracts, this would probably be too much. I like a more pronounced vanilla flavor). After reading how quickly this cake browned at 350, I decided to try starting it in a cold oven. I set it to 325 after the pan was in place and did not open the door for 60 minutes. It rose well and browned golden, not dark, with a nice crust, taking a total of 70 minutes. The recipe didn't specify type of butter, so I used 2 sticks salted and 2 sticks unsalted; the full 3 cups of sugar; and 1/4 teaspoon mace. I use Baker's Joy Spray in my pan, and it popped out easily and intact. After it was cool, I brushed it with a glaze made of softened cream cheese, unsalted butter, half and half, glazing sugar, and vanilla and lemon extracts. This does make a large amount of thick batter, so make sure you have a true 12 cup Bundt pan, use a larger Angel-food type pan, or plan on making a second smaller cake that will have to come out of the oven sooner. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe! Great cake! It was dense as pound cake should be, but not heavy at all. This was my first attempt at making a pound cake and it came out perfect! I used three sticks of butter, egg substitute, fat free sour cream, omitted the mace, used the zest and juice of one lemon, 1 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract. I followed the advice of other viewers and beat the sugar and butter for seven minutes. I mixed for one minute after the addition of each egg. I folded in the flour mixture and sour cream and I was very careful not to over work the batter, so that the cake would not be tough. This is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Wow...what a moist and flavorful cake. I've been searching for a sour cream bundt cake recipe like my mom used to make and this is it. I made the following modifications after reading the reviews: Omitted the mace, added 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and increased vanilla to 2 teaspoons. Baked at 325 degrees on middle rack in my oven. Cake was done after 1 hr and 10 minutes. This is delicious plain or drizzled with vanilla glaze. I plan to use this for strawberry shortcakes in the spring and for trifle.

I had a lot of eggs and wanted to bake a cake to get rid of them.  This one (with 6 eggs) turned out great.  Very moist, very tasty.  Tips: use a little more than a pinch of ground mace (up to 1/4 teaspoon) and watch the cake closely for the final 15 minutes (I almost left it in the oven too long...next time I'll bake it at 325 degrees).  This one is a keeper!

One of the best pound cake recipes I have every made.  I baked mine in a slightly cooler oven (325)and it came out a beautiful golden brown.  I had a little bit left over after a week and I made trifle with it.  Yummy!

I have to say, I was shocked when I tasted this... I did not care for this. I thought I was going to love it.  It literally tasted like I was biting into a stick of butter.  I was so disappointed, and a little embarrassed - I made it for a group of friends, and I could tell no one liked it!  I followed the recipe exactly... sorry, but this is the first time ever that I have to rate a recipe this low.

This is a great recipe!  I omitted the mace, did not have sour cream on hand so I substituted by adding 1 Tbl. lemon juice and enough whole milk to make one cup (like buttermilk).  With my oven I baked less than 1 hour, you definately need to keep an eye on it while baking.  I also iced it with the recipe for "Perfect Chocolate" Frosting, on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can.  My family LOVED it!  There was a piece left almost a week later and it was just as moist as the first day!

The best pound cake ever!! You must beat the sugar and butter about 10 minutes before you add the eggs and beat after each one for at least a minute. This is a must for any cake that says to beat until light and fluffy. Everyone loved it and I will bake again and again.

This cake was the best pound cake recipe I've tried. I omitted the mace and added twice the amount of vanilla to give it some extra flavor, which helped it stand alone. I also recommend cooking it at 325 or the top becomes too brown!

the taste was good.  I added lemon rind and no mace.  It was not moist, it was greasy.  Maybe I did something wrong.

This cake was very,very moist, but the texture was not very fine-grained. I'm not sure whether I am the culprit or the tremendous amount of butter in the recipe is the culprit.....but, 2 lbs is a LOT of butter!

This makes a tonne of cake, I barely had a bowl big enough to mix all the ingredients!!

This cake is very moist and buttery, best served at room temperature to bring out the flavours.

I omitted the mace and used the zest of one lemon instead, because I was in the mood for something lemon-y and fresh.  

I made sure to mix the eggs and butter and sugar very well since that seemed to be the biggest concern with most of the reviews.  You definitely need a mixer to incorporate those three ingredients, doing it buy hand can cause them to go granular and seperate.

Wonderful recipe!  I did as another reviewer suggested and omitted the mace, and added the baking powder.  I also agree that it should be baked at 325.  About 30 minutes into baking I saw the crust browning much too quickly and I lowered the temp to 325.  It came out great and is a delicious stand-alone cake, or with fruit and whipped cream.

I've tried hundreds of pound cake recipes over the years looking for the perfect cake.  This one is it. (OK, I don't use mace in it.)  Every now and then I'll try another recipe, but the cake never measures up to this one.

I tried this recipe many time, and I tried the other pound cake to. But always back to this cake. I'm using this cake for my carving cake. It sturdy and dense. I read someone said, she experience baker and said it suppose to use half size the butter. Okay, now I asked you..."why people call this pound cake ?" This is almost the original recipe my husband's grandma bake. She bake without baking soda or baking powder. I added baking powder a bit.

YUM!! Ive made this 3 times in the past week to perfect it. Here's what I've come up with. I used cake flour, and sifted it 3 times.  I beat the butter and sugar for 5 minutes, then once all the eggs were added, beat it for another 5 minutes.  And don't overmix the flour. These are the secrets to a perfect texture pound cake.  Instead of sour cream, I used heavy whipping cream. Very moist, and has a lovely crust.  My family's favorite.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This pound cake recipe is awesome!  It's moist and desnse just like a pound cake should be.  I omitted the mace and added more vainilla.  I baked it at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes as suggested and it turned out perfect!  This is definitely a keeper.

THIS CAKE WAS FABULOUS.  I ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS AND TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE USING THE RECIPE.  THE ONLY THING I DID WAS TO LOWER THE OVEN TEMP. TO 325 BECAUSE THE BATTER WAS SO THICK.  I USED A BUNDT PAN AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER AND I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

Excellent. Crisp crust, moist inside, not too sweet. A very traditional pound cake, and best prepared a day before serving. Given the density of the ingredients, it needs that time to firm up, and the crust of the cake seals the moisture in. Anyone looking for a really pronounced sweetness or strong flavor may not be happy with this. It's great to serve with some fresh fruit, or toast it and serve w/some ice cream, etc. Also - I don't stock mace becuase I rarely if ever use it, and it was expensive - $4 for a small jar?!?! I looked at the back of the jar at the store, and it said an equivalent substitution flavor-wise was nutmeg. I think 1 part mace to 3 part nutmeg. Grated some fresh nutmeg with a Microplane, and could barely tell it was there in the finished product. That said, you could probably sweeten and/or spice this up with some extra sugar, vanilla, lemon/orange zest/extract if you dig that.

Fantastic!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, except I didn't have any mace, so I excluded it.  I also lowered my oven temp to 325° because my oven runs hot. This is hands down the best pound cake ever!!

I have made this cake twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it came out dense, dark, and too sweet.  The 2nd time I reduced the butter and the sugar by 1/2 a cup, added lemon flavoring, and 1/2 tsp baking powder, and baked at 325.  It came out lighter and fluffier.  I think maybe a good tip would be to beat the daylights out of the batter before adding the flour.  Thanks grandma, this is a keeper!

Recipe as written has too much butter.  I should have read through comments and reduce amount of sugar and butter.  I'll try with some of the recommendations.

Absolutely fantastic recipe.  I think the pinch of mace really makes it.  I've made this five times and the only thing I do that is different is I substitute one cup of self rising flour for one cup of  flour that's called for in the recipe and it comes out phenominal. In other words I do 1 cup of self rising flour and 2 cups regular flour.  Still dense but deliciously perfect. I like use vanilla bean also.

I dont cook much but I was in the mood and my Mother-In-Law was coming for the holidays and I wanted to bake something. I found this recipe and made this cake. I read the reviews and the modifactions that others suggested, such as leaving out the mace, adding more vanilla and mixing for at least 10 minutes. My husband and in-laws are excellent cooks and picky eaters....they LOVED this cake and ate it ALL. My mother-in-law even asked me for the recipe!  AWESOME cake! Definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I've tried another pound cake recipe from here, and this is by far the best.  It really has that "fresh from grandma's" taste.  I only had 1 cup of butter (actually olive oil spread) in the fridge, so that's what I used.  Also, I had no mace, so just added a touch of cinnamon.  It came out moist and delicious.

this cake rose but sunk a bit in the middle. as suggested by some,i added baking pwd 1/4 tsp, 3 tsp vanilla, and whipped the heck out of the butter/sugar, folding flour by hand, and decreased the baking temp to 325. the cake rose but sank in the middle, the crumb was fairly hard, and the color of the cake was dingy-yellow and kind of translucent inside but nice and golden on the outside. the recipe Does have more butter per flour than most pound cake recipes and so the flour may have been too saturated. the flavor was good but couldn't thoroughly enjoy due to the hard crumb. (i used organic gold medal ap flour which works well for all my other recipes. so i think this recipe really needs to be made with Cake flour to hold on to all that butter and sugar, And i will alt. adding the flour/sugar to get this cake more yellow, softer, and rounded in the middle. i'll give one more try like this

This is amazing poundcake, I love it.  I added 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, upped the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons, and decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups as some reviewers suggested.  I think I am going to go to 3 cups sugar.  

I am doing the following 2 variations this week for a party:

1. Lemon:  I am resplacing the sour cream with lemon yogurt and adding the zest of one lemon and a couple TBS of the lemon's juice.

2. Chocolate Marble:  I intend to separate out 1/3 of the batter and blend in some Hershey's syrup.  Then put regular batter, then chocolate batter, then regular batter, and swirl it up with a knife.

I am a southerner and southerners love their Pound Cake, and this one is mighty good!  I'm not really sure if most folks understand that a really good pound cake is dense, moist and if  baked correctly, will emerge from the pan with a lovely buttery and brown crust, which makes it absolutely delicious.  Pound cakes are not suppose to be "light" in texture, so those who are looking for that type of cake need to look elsewhere.   This recipe is FABULOUS!!!

Let me say initially, if a recipe requires this many modifications, I don't hold it as a good recipe for me.  However, I did add more vanilla and the baking soda.  The top puffed up, separated from the cake, and even though I covered it loosely with foil when I realized it was browning so quickly, it still was crusty and ultimately flaked off the cake.  In the end there were dense, unbaked pockets at the bottom.  Won't use again.  :/

Excellent cake. Moist and wasy to bake. I did cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 Cups. Thought it was a bit too sweet. That's my personal taste. Cake is great as is.

This is an awesome cake recipe.  My guests at Christmas dinner loved it.  Like the others, decrease the tempature to 325 and add 1/4 tsp baking power, and cream the butter and sugar for at least min 5 minutes.  The cake is wonderful.

This cake is really good, I tried it and my family and friends really loved it. I didn't have mace but added the vanilla and lemon extract and it turned out great. I also make a lemon glaze to go over it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.

This was really, really good!  I'm not a big lover of pound cakes, but this with homeade whipped cream and fresh berries was fabulous!  Received lots of compliments.  I did bake at 325 and added 2x the vanilla extract.  The only thing I may change next time is to add more mace.  I'm not sure a pinch did much.  I couldn't taste it.

Definitely a great recipie. The cake is delicious and creamy, and has a sweet taste despite the large amount of sour cream in it. The only problem with the cake is that it doesn't last very long at all.

This pound cake was great. I've been searching for a good sour cream pound cake recipe for a long time and I think I've found it. I always cut back the baking time to be safe and then I add more if it needs it. I baked only for an hour, poked it 20 times with toothpicks, and every single one came out clean. However, after cooling and putting on a plate, it was still underdone! So, next time I will bake for 1 hour and ten minutes. I also baked at 325, cut back the sugar to 2.5 cups, and added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla. Ran out of mace, so omitted it. Tastes really good with fresh strawberries!

I used 3 T. of lime juice instead of mace for a little bit of tangyness... WOW! I also increased the vanilla to 2 t. and added 1/2 t. of almond extract. Finally, I poured a light citrus glaze over the top. Perfect, perfect! Simple Citrus Glaze: 1 T. soft butter, 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 T. + 1 1/2 t. lime, lemon, or orange juice. Drizzle over hot cake and serve immediately!   ***UPDATE: I stirred in 3 large sliced fresh peaches for a beautiful peach pound cake. It was incredibly moist and peachy!

I used this recipe in a cupcake mold for my daughter's first birthday (photo posted).  It was outstanding - flavorful and moist.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much! Left out the mace, replaced with grated lemon rind and made a lemon icing sugar glaze.  The cake was devoured.

OMG!  This pound cake was Awesome!!!  I did take the advice of some of the people who said to use a little less sugar.  I used 2 ¾ cups sugar, and increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon and it was so good.  It was equally appealing to the eye as well as the palate.  This is bar none the best pound cake ever.  The cake was very simple to prepare and I lowered the heat (as suggested by some) to 325 degrees and had no problems, browned nicely and cooked perfectly through out.  Thanks for this recipe, will defiantly make again.

This cake was a staple in our house.  We used 1 cup of butter and no mace. This will be my Xmas indulgence.

I made this cake a few days ago. I took the suggestions from the comments and added the baking powder. I also felt that the cake needed more extract so next time I will add a tbs of the vanilla and  1/2 tbs almond. I cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup as I felt 3 cups would be too sweet. I think if you are going to use a glaze then the sugar can be reduced an additional 1/4 cup ( I don’t like overly sweet cakes)Also, beat the sugar and butter for the 7 to 10 minutes as suggested by others.  I think this is a helpful step.   I only used 3 sticks of butter as per a few other reviews, it was greasy. I baked at 325 degrees for the suggested time. Cake came out perfect. Moist. Nice crumb. Won’t choke you. Not greasy. Haven’t had a good pound cake in a loooong while and this hits the spot. It’s been 4 days since I baked it and last piece is still moist and the flavor is better. So I would suggest baking this a day or two before you serve it. I am baking another one later. This is a keeper! ( I gave it a 4 star only because of the changes that had to be made)

This recipe truly makes a lovely cake.  Beautiful color, texture, crumb and taste.  Despite a couple of really negative reviews can so many positive reviews be wrong?  Everyone loved it at our dinner last night.  I drizzled a simple icing over it but it could have stood on its own easily.
I made one bundt cake & had enough batter to make a medium sized loaf as well.  Baking time was right on though I turned the heat to 325 for the last 10 mins.  I may have reduced the sugar by about 1/3 c..  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to beat the butter/sugar for 10 mins. It takes that longs to get to the fluffy, light-colored stage.  An easy delicious cake. Will make it again.  UPDATE: I just doubled the recipe and got 8 tin foil loaf pans of this cake.

It was good, but I couldn't find any mace, so I use nutmeg instead, I mean mace is just the outer coating of nutmeg, so it would taste, and react similar to mace than anything else

Made this recipe 2 times today.  Needed it for a "Bag lunch" I am doing for Relay of Life tomorrow.  Best pound cake I has ever tasted.  My eggs were a little small so I used 7 eggs in this cake.  Next time I make it I will try cutting the butter to 1 1/2 cups.

Truly devine! I did make one major change, I lowered the sugar to 2 1/3 C., only my preference though! I don't care for mace, so I added 1 T. of vanilla, some orange zest, fresh raspberries, and a cup of chocolate chips. What a perfect consistentcy, texture, rise, and just everything! I had enough for a little (6 inch) cake and a 10 inch fluted bundt cake pan. It turned out beautiful and delicious!

I had heard about sour cream pound cake and I wanted to create a cake from scratch. I read some reviews and made a couple of adjustments. I didn't have 2 cups of butter so I used 1 1/2 cups (really that was all I had...lol) and I didn't have mace. I bumped up the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder.  I followed the instructions and my cake turned out great. My oven was too hot at 350 degrees and I almost burnt my cake...325 next time.

2 cups of butter just seemed like wayyy too much to me, so I cut mine back to 2 sticks. It came out brilliantly and I already have requests for more!  We take slices of the cake, toast them in the toaster oven and put peanut butter on top. It's delicious!

This recipe hasn't been reviewed in a long time, and I thought it definitely deserved a 5-star update!  I baked in an angel food cake tube pan and it was beautiful and delicious.  It had a slightly crunchy top which was perfect.  I served it with fruit (from the Summery Lime-Mango Shortcakes   Recipe on this site) and home-made whipped cream.  Delish!

Me and my husband made this last night and as the saying goes "It's so good it makes you wanna slap your momma!" Never had a pound cake that called for mace but it gave it a really nice flavor! We followed the recipe to the T and made no substitutions even after reading the reviews! You can't please everybody i guess! My husband took some to work and his co-workers loved it! The only thing that was kind of weird was that while it was still warm it had kind of a cornbread taste to it but it went away once it completely cooled off!

This is the best pound cake ever!  Easy to put together, just follow instructions.  I didn't have mace, so I just doubled the vanilla ( I use vanilla bean paste).  We are having Strawberry Shortcake for desert tonight, but this is so good I may eat my strawberries and cream, and have my cake on it's own!  I did make a small loaf with the extra batter, it was too much for my bundt pan.  Oh well, I guess I just got a bonus cake!

I didn't have any mace so I left that out.  I followed some of the others advice and increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp and baked at 325. That was all of the changes I made, which wasn't a lot. It turned out perfect.  I was a little worried it would spill over because I filled my pan all the way to the top, but it didn't.  My whole family loved it!

One of the best pound cake recipes I've encountered by far. I followed other users' suggestions and beat the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and 1 minute after each addition of egg. I didn't have the ground mace on hand so I omitted it and see no reason to use it next time. I did have a bit of overflow that I didn't mind because it was a perfect crust.

This recipe turned out beautifully.  I made a few modifications by omitting the mace, doubling the vanilla and adding 1 tsp of lemon extract.  I also lowered the temperature 25 degrees.  The cake was golden yellow without a crust and very moist.  I would recommend using lemon zest instead of lemon extract.

I prepared this cake for dessert for my family last night.  We had it w/ BB homemade vanilla ice cream  and it was absolutely divine!  I woke up this morning w/ it on my mind and decided to bring some to the office to have w/ coffee.  Well, I must say that it is EVEN BETTER today.  This is an incredibly wonderful recipe that reminds me of being a little girl and eating the cakes the deaconesses would bring to church for Sunday evening services.  The only thing I did different was bake chopped pecans into the top of it, omitting the powdered sugar.  Thank you for a great, old fashioned recipe! It will be the one I use from now on!

I made this for my son's fourth birthday.  I used it to make a train and cover with fondant.  It was dense enough to hold its shape and still tasted great. It was very moist. I frosted underneath the fondant with a cream cheese buttercream.  I would highly recommend this.

This pound cake is very good.  It's even better the next day.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is that the crust ends up being thick, don't know if it's my pan or not.  Still good.  I've already made it twice and I will probably make it again.

Easy to whip together and what results!  Moist, buttery and delish.  I brought this to a Mother's Day get together with my boyfriend's family, and although other (store bought) desserts were laid out, this pound cake was the one that everyone flocked to.  I received RAVE reviews and everyone loved the simple strawberry topping I made to go along with it: two pints of strawberries with 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.  Let the berries sit at room temperature for at least thirty minutes so the sugar dissolves and the natural juices of the berries come out.  Spoon some of the juicy berries on a slice of this cake, add a dollop of whip cream, and ta-da!  Yum.

This is great!  Came across this tonite and whipped it up.  I followed the directions exactly.  I did make sure that my butter and sugar were creamed well and beat quite a bit after adding the eggs.  I added the dry ingredients by hand and then folded in the sour cream.  I would rate this up there with a slice of pound cake you would get at a high end bakery.  Just great:)

What a great cake!  I made it for my visiting daughter and her family and they loved it.  The five-year-old wanted it every morning for breakfast.  I served it the first night of their visit with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  I added 1/2 more teaspoon vanilla and left out the mace.

Amazing! Hands down the best pound cake I have ever had. I didn't have a bundt or tube pan, so I divided the batter between an 8" cake pan and a loaf pan and baked it for about an hour. Perfect!

This was my first pound cake and it was really good.  Family enjoyed it as well.  I didn't do any glaze since it was sweet and tasty as is.  Made two loaves and they were both gone between 4 people in 2 days.

I have looked for a pound cake recipe that I could actually make without it coming out like a sponge for a while. This one is really good. Just do not over work the flour mixture. I think that is the key!

I made this recipe using the modifications from the other reviews and it turned out AWESOME!!!!  We're only a family of three so I divided the recipe in 2 and made a small bundt cake.  My Husband and Son loves it.  This is our new family recipe for pound cake.  Please thank your Grandma for me.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I was trying to duplicate the pound cake that my parent's neighbor gives them every Christmas - the perfect pound cake in my book - and this is it!  I did change one thing: I omitted the mace entirely and instead used the zest of one lemon.  Watch the cooking time on this - it only needed 1 hr. 10 min. in my oven.

This cake was so great, my non-pound-cake-eating husband converted. He loved it!!  I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and since I didn't own mace (nor do I know what it is) I didn't use it. Tastes yummy with sweetened strawberries. Warning: Make sure you have a deep bundt pan. Mine ended up overflowing. It still looked great after some trimming (Lol).I will keep this recipe forvever!

Oh my what a wonderful pound cake recipe. I followed the hints of the previous reviews and it turned out wonderfully. I didnt use the mace, I added a touch of nutmeg and used 2 tsp of vanilla as i was out of my good vanilla. This is a keeper, I have made it twice now.

This cake is amazing!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.  I did not have mace so I omitted it.  I have requests from my parents and aunts and uncles to make this again!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Awesome cake recipe though I was a little disappointed at first when the cake was a lot lighter than I thought it should be. Pound cakes are traditionally quite dense but this one wasn't. However I did use cake flour instead of AP so that may have had something to do with it. Also I found that after it has completely cooled and sat for a bit, it firms up nicely.

Amazing! The only chnage I made was substituting zest of one lemon for the mace. That lemon zest gave so much fresh, light citrusy flavor. I made it on a Wednesday for a Thursday and it was good, but I had the leftovers for another event Saturday and it was even better - it got even more moist! It continued to get more moist throughout the week and even a full 10 days later, was absolutely moist and perfect!!

I wish I could give this cake ten stars. It is so moist and delicious. I mixed and baked just as directed, and it turned out so delicious. Next time, though, I will bake at a little lower temp. My old oven tends to get things too brown. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe--it is my new favorite pound cake!

I'm making this cake again today to bring to a luncheon tomorrow.
I have to say it's the best ever pound cake recipe - I followed other reviewers' recommendations re the baking powder,  less sugar, and I add lemon zest since I don't have mace.  Also, 325 deg. 1 hr 10 min. works best in my oven. Also, whip the daylights out of the batter before folding in the dry ingredients, as suggested.
One other thing, it makes  too much batter for my bundt pan, so I make a few cupcakes or a small 9 X 9" cake pan. 
This cake is really awesome. I'm always asked for the recipe !!

This was my first time to make a pound cake,although I have been baking many other types of cake. To be on the safer side I baked only half the quantity & after reading the other reviews added bakingpowder too.The results were excellent.The cake is moist with very good texture.It smells wonderful while baking.I would surely make it again and again.Its added on to my family favourites!! Thanks for sharing it grandma.

This is a Great Recipe!! Thank You Grandma. I did like some of the other bakers. I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar. I really creamed the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, and did the same when I added the eggs. I used 2 tsp Vanilla, 1/4 tsp Baking Powder, and no Mace. I also hand mixed in the dry ingredients, I know that over working the flour will make it tough. 
I did however take out about 3 cups of the batter and mixed in a 1/4 cup of Unsweetened Cocoa Powder. Then layered the plain with the chocolate and marbled them together. We loved it!! I might even add some chocolate chips to the chocolate part next time. Thanks Again, We Love It!

This was the first pound cake I have ever made and my husband's 87 year old grandma loved it.  I did elimate the mace, added 1/4 tsp. of baking powder and another tsp. of vanilla.  I also crushed some fresh strawberries and made whipped cream to add for anyone who wanted it.  It was fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading the other reviews, I too decided to change the recipe around.  I omitted the mace, lowered the sugar content to 2 1/2 cups, added 1 tsp almond extract, lowered the temp to 325, but still cooked it for 1 hour 20 minutes as suggested.  It turned out beautiful!  This was the first pound cake I ever made, and I think it is a good one for me to use as a base to experiment with...like adding different flavorings and such.  I had a friend eat some of it and she is still putting me in her "good cook" category, so if you are inexperienced at pound cake, this recipe will make it seem as if you were an old pro.  And if you are wondering what I thought of the cake, my oinion doesn't count bacause I still have a cold and foods don't taste the same right now...my husband is the one that gave it 4 stars...

This cake is awesome. It is TOTALLY a stand alone cake. I omitted the mace and used madagascar vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract. I also used 2 sticks of salted and 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Baked it a 325 for an hour and made a simple glaze of 1/2 stick of melted utter a tbsp of mik and 2 cups of powdered sugar. YUMMY!

DO NOT USE 2 CUPS/4 STICKS OF BUTTER! It will ruin this cake. Only use two sticks/1 cup of butter

This is the best pound cake I have ever had!  I make it almost exactly as directed with the only exception being I don't use mace.  I have never bought that and it is fabulous without it.  It is not too anything and I have always gotten rave reviews when I make it.  Goes great with a cup of black coffee after dinner.  Ingore the haters and just follow the recipe and you will have a winner

This was my very first attempt at a pound cake. It was so easy! I had heard that pound cakes were hard, aggravating. Not this one. It tasted just like I remember my "Grandma's" tasting. It was buttery, moist, and had a soft texture. My husband said to definitely remember this one. I would recommend this one for anyone.

No baker, just really getting into baking... this cake is wonder & very.easy to make !! :-)
I followed recipe then after placing batter in pans l added fresh frozen peaches in one of the cake pans.
For the top layer of my cake.
Im baking a birthday cake for someone an they love peaches.
It turned out really good an moist
It did take 5min more longer to bake for the cake batter l added the peaches to- than other, probably be be same time if l would have added fresh or defrosted fruit.
I put cream cheese frosting between the cakes, l set the cake with peaches on top. Used chocolate fudge frosting to finish.

I was a little concerned over how much sugar this recipe calls for, but I tried it anyway. Should have trusted my instincts. This cake is much too sweet. It was, however, very moist but I had to bake it for 30 minutes longer than what the recipe indicates. Won't be giving this one a second try.

Excellent when I made adjustments recommended by most other reviewers (reduce sugar to 2 1/4 cups, add 1/4 tsp baking powder, increased vanilla to 2 tsp). Definitely make with 1 pound of butter as this IS a pound cake (thus, the name)! If you don't like a very moist, buttery cake this isn't for you. My family loved it and I will make it often.

This recipe was so delicious and moist. I could not believe how well this recipe came out. The only thing that I did differnt was sift the flour through a siffter. Thank you for this recipe, my family truly enjoyed it.

Big hit!  Lots of beating--but worth the time.  Only four stars because batter is too much for pan and, while overflow is nice and crusty, the cake comes out a bit lopsided.

This is a really good recipe. I ended up using yogurt instead of sour cream due to what I had in my fridge, but I will definitely try again with sour cream.  I should have cut back the backing time just a tad to keep it a little less crusty, but it was delicious and I had no complaints.

I reduced sugar to 2 cups, doubled vanilla, added the baking powder, and oh wow was this delicious! Such a nice delicate flavor from the eggs and butter, balanced off with the vanilla. Excellent cake~ my whole family and I loved it, and so did my friends. Regarding baking time- its a mixed decision for me, I baked it at 325F for 20 mins before getting impatient and turning the oven onto 350F, and baking for a additional 30mins. (50mins in total) Its hard to say how the heck the cake got cooked so well, but it was nice and moist. Despite the strange baking method I used, I think I'll stick with it.

WOW! I loved this cake! Very easy recipe! One tip though would be to at least halve the sugar.
(I only used 1 1/2 cup sugar, and It was still very, very sweet.) 
Also, the cake was done at only 45 minutes, at 350 degrees in my oven.

I will recommend and I will make again and again.

I used lemon zest instead of the mace, and that worked out really well. I think next time I make this cake, I'll also make a lemon glaze for the topping to help moisten the crust.

my hubby LOVED this recipe.  So awesome.  I didn't use any mace though- I used some grated lemon peel and fresh squeezed lemon juice- then dusted with powdered sugar- next time I'm going to do a lemon glaze as well.

Wonderful very rich dense looking but light tasting pound cake! In all my baked goodies, I reduce the amount of sugar. Only added 2 cups of sugar which was sweet enough! Highly recommended.

I'm pregnant and I was craving pound cake - odd i know - so I came to look up a good recipe. This was perfect. I didn't have mace so I substituted all spice. You can barely tell it's there but it does add a little something. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly, cooking time and all, and it came out perfectly. Perfect texture, perfect flavor. I think I'm going to eat the whole thing... :)

PERFECT!!!  I had never made a pound cake before, and was a little nervous about this recipe since many of the reviewers changed the ingredients, but for the first try I decided just to follow the recipe.  I'm so glad I did! 

The finished product was absolutely perfect.  Moist yet not crumbly, just as a pound cake should be.  The sweetness was just right.  I made this for Easter dessert to use for strawberry shortcake.  The cake was so good by itself that I find myself sneaking pieces without even putting any strawberry topping on them! :)

My husband loves pound cake and says that this recipe is a keeper.

I did use nutmeg instead of mace.

Sooo good! Next time, i'll cut the sugar to 2 cups. I used nutmeg instead of mace (FYI, mace is the ground nutmeg shell, so you can just substitute) and I used two loaf pans instead of a bundt pan. I followed other user's suggestions, and beat the butter/sugar/eggs until fluffly, and folded in the flour mixture by hand. I'll be making this over and over again!

I used only 1 1/2c butter and 2c sugar (suit my taste), skipped the ground mace.  Great! Next time, I'll try 2c butter. Thanks.

Mmmm! Wonderful! I'm not a great baker, but this turned out perfect. Instead of mace, I used 1 tbsp vanilla. And I beat the sugar, butter and eggs a lot. Crispy on the outside, moist and wonderful on the inside.

Yum.  I wanted to make a pound cake for my mother in law.  She was impressed which is always a good thing.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have mace.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp more vanilla for flavor.  Baked in a bundt pan for the time stated was perfect although I did cover it with foil for the last 15 minutes so it wouldn't get to dark.  Definetly a keeper.

I baked mine in a tube pan and it took exactly the time it said on the recipe.  You definitely need to "make" time for this cake with the preparation and bake time and I did mine with a Kitchen Aid but the killer is really the 1-1/2 hour bake time!  I used 2-3/4 cups of sugar and the cake was sweet enough but the next time, I'll add a little more sugar because I think it can be a little sweeter--not exactly 3 cups but close to it.  So, I ate a piece when it was still warm and I have to say I wasn't crazy about it--I wasn't sure if I will make it again.  I love pound cake but I thought the taste was kind of boring and nothing special.  But then, I had a piece this morning and it was very very good!  The texture is valvety and it has a crunchy crust.  I haven't put any powdered sugar or icing on it but I will when I get home.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been baking for almost 3 years and of the many pound cake recipes I've tried, this is by far my family's favourite.  My husband says it's possibly the best cake I've ever made.  My sister-in-law says she likes it the best.  The sour cream made it moist yet kept it light and not too dense.  The only thing I might try different next time is to use 2 1/2 cups sugar instead since I personally found it a tad bit too sweet.  Overall a wonderful pound cake that is a keeper and a new family favourite.

This cake is delicious. I halved the recipes and followed MommyfromSeattle's advice. I did not add mace but added blueberries. Yummy!!! I finally found a pound cake that I can bake successfully. Thank you so much.

Excellent!  Very moist.  I did add an additional tsp of Vanilla because I like a lot of flavor.  Be sure to bake at 325 instead of 350 as well.  This will be my primary recipe for pound cake from now on.

I made this cake for husband - who is the ultimate pound cake critic and he loved it. I will definitely share this recipe and keep making it for generations to come.

I ran into the same problem as some of the other reviewers - with it browning too quickly so I think I will lower the heat to 325 next time and watch it during the last 15 minutes.

Soo good and I'm not even a pound cake lover..at least not until now.  Family loved it, except my son, the butter minimalist, but even he had several slices - so he didn't love it but he sure liked it a great deal!  Thanks...

Excellent Cake!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and have received several requests to make this again!  I used egg substitute, 2 sticks of light butter and 1 stick of regular butter, fat-free sour cream--Very Moist, Very Moist!!  Also, I used a lemon glaze instead of the recommended powdered sugar.  EXCELLENT!!!

I love to bake and this recipe is very good. However, I did add an extra tsp of vanilla extract and baked it at 325 for 1 hr and 10 min as others suggested. The cake turned out picture-perfect. I would not consider this a stand-alone cake. It is so rich in butter that I believe the addition of a fruit on top of a slice would compliment the cake. A very good recipe but extremely rich. I could only eat a small slice since it was very filling. I gave it four stars because I modified the recipe a bit.

What an amazing cake!  It was the best ever pound cake I have ever eaten!  The best part about it was the crispy crust.  I omitted the mace because I didn't have it, decreased the sugar to 2 3/4 cup, increased the vanilla to 1 T, and baked it for 1 hour 10 minutes at 325 like the other raters suggested.  My star bundt pan seems a bit smaller than the regular one.  I was afraid it would overflow, so I baked a second small 9x9 cake with the leftover batter.  I made it for the first time for a party tonight and was asked many times for the recipe!  Thank you!!

this is a delicious and moist cake! I had some fat free sour cream that I needed to use and this recipe was perfect. it was actually a little too sweet for me, so the next time I will not use as much sugar. Didnt have any mace, so I used a pinch of nutmeg. i also added a tsp of vanilla extract and a tsp of almond extract for a littl more flavor and was not disappointed. very good with vanilla ice cream. this will definitely be added to my list of favorites. thanks for the post :D

The flavor of this cake is pretty good.  I don't think it's a stand alone cake though.  I think it would be better with strawberries and whipped cream or something similar.  It was very easy to whip up.  I also liked how moist it was. I omitted the mace because I didn't have any.

I should have paid more attention to reviews. Way too much butter. I usually use 1.5 cups. I am a seasoned home baker. This cake was heavy and greasy. 
I will use it in a trifle.

This is fabulous! 
Thank you for sharing your recipe, @LVJOANNE. The only thing is I got confused the first time I tried it because the baking soda and salt are not listed in the directions. I added them to the flour mixture and it was fantastic. EDIT: I see the online recipe has been edited since I printed it out. Thanks!
I’ve made several pound cakes from this site that were very good-but this one takes the cake!
I did not use mace, nor a substitution. I baked it at 325°     
It makes enough batter to fill my “Heritage” Bundt pan and a loaf pan. It freezes well and stays so moist.

I halved the recipe to make in a loaf pan.  Adjusted temp to 325 because my oven runs hot, and baked for one hour.  Dense, moist and delicious!  Thank you, LVJoanne!  Another reviewer suggested greasing the pan and then using sugar instead of flour.  I did that even though I wasn't using a bundt pan (duh), but the outer crust of the loaf had a wonderful crunch to it  that I will repeat next time using the bundt.

Save your time, ingredients, and cooking time!  I should have read the reviews before making this cake.  I thought I'd done something wrong, and even went to my 82 y.o. mom for advice on what I may have done wrong... it wasn't me, it's the cake. You could tell something was wrong when you dumped it onto a plate.  It's so heavy & saturated with butter,  it caved in on itself in the middle while it was cooking; I mean there was literally a dent all around the cake.  When you cut a piece and look at the inside you can see a different color which led me to think it wasn't cooked long enough, even though I cooked it like the recipe called for.  Nope, that was butter.  YUCK!!!

This is the perfect pound cake recipe. It’s easy, quick, and bakes up beautifully. I overheard comments of, “just like Grandma’s” and “grab the rest of the cake and let’s go!”   Followed the recipe exactly. I recommend this recipe!

This is the second time I made this cake and both times, people didn't like it.  This time I only put a tiny pinch of mace since the first time I used too much and that was off putting to people.  Another mistake I made the first time was over beating the ingredients- I gently folded in the dry ingredients until just combined and the texture was much better.  I don't know what it is, even with those two fixes, no one really ate the cake.  In general I much prefer homemade stuff to store bought but this cake doesn't capture the richness or the texture of a store pound cake that so many like.  Maybe its the bundt pan? I don't know but I don't think I'll be giving it a third chance.

Sounds like the same cake a friend use to make in SC it was delicious, but she wouldn’t share her recipe, so I’m glade you shared yours. I haven’t made it yet, but I plan to. Hope mine turns out as lovely.

love this recipe. I and extra egg yolks (2) and found it very moist and delicious.  It also was enough for two cakes and i added pomegranates to one and OM goodness! Amazing. I have an abundance of them and have been looking for ways to use them other than juicing.

Worst cake I ever made. Too much butter, too much sugar, didn't cook, too oily. Yuk! Only rated one star because I had to.

Love this recipe.  I only make two adjustments. I love lemon flavor so I add a teaspoon of lemon extract for a subtle hint. Then I spray my bundt pan with baker's spray, then I coat/"flour" it with granulated sugar. It gives the cake a wonderful little surprise, crisp sweetness on the outside.

Delicious and beautiful.  I served mine with an orange glaze and fresh mixed fruit.  Everyone loved it and not a crumb was left on anyone's plate.

I have made this quite a few time in the past.  I followed the recipe. The only thing I differently was add a orange glaze to 
cake.  I bake cake at 350.  The top did darken quite a bit.
After I was finished I reread the reviews and see several people
bake cake at 325 due to this.   Must have bake cake at 325
the last time because I don't remember top of cake darkening
like it did at 350.  Will bake again

This was the best pound cake I've ever tasted!!  I didn't make a single substitution. It doesn't need anything extra or different!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will definitely be making it again!!

My husband is in love with this cake. The only change I made was omitting the mace, simply because I did not have it on hand. After reading several reviews, I thought it safe not to use it and I simply do not know how this cake could be any better.

This was a very good pound cake.  I baked it for my co-worker and her and her boyfriend loved it.  One suggestion is to lower the temp to 325 degrees instead of 350.  It browned very quickly.

Good, simple recipe with several changes. Omitted the mace.  Not common so don't sweat it if you don't have.  Just add a touch of vanilla as this recipe doesn't call for enough.  2 TSP is needed.  Add 1/2 TSP Baking Powder.  Needed a bit of air.  And no way need as much butter.  Cut in half.  At 350, its 55-60 minutes.  Use lower rack.  Butter foil and cover last 15 minutes.

Best pound cake recipe for me.  I use it as the base for my Raspberry Trifle which I serve for Christmas dinner desert.  Any leftover cake morsels get gobbled up quickly.  It is so delicious with a cup of hot tea.

Made just like the recipe said and it came out great. It does above the top of the pan so make sure you put something under it in the oven. Will make this again for Christmas.

It was ok.  Not one of my favorites.  Not a tender pound cake kind of course.  But came nicely out of the pan and the flavor was just ok.  Although that being said, my husband loved it.

I made this for a party tomorrow and it's a mess.  It was too much for my Bundt pan so I left about 1 inch at the top and put the excess in a small Bundt.  The big pan is dripping all over the oven and the small pan fell.  I haven't had this kind of catastrophe in years and years.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  I thought maybe I'd whipped the butter too long but in reading the reviews I don't think that's it.  I live at an altitude of 4000+ feet but generally I don't make any modifications to recipes.  I'm baffled and very disappointed.  Now I'll have to make another.  :(

Super tasty. Only change was cutting the mace; however, baking time was just under an hour. Be sure to check this one often or you may end up with burnt cake.

Cake was delicious.  However, it formed a crusty top which cracked and came off.  Any ideas how to keep this from happening ?  Baked 1 hr. 20 mins. at 325 degrees.  I have baked this for holidays and added 1 cup pecans.  Never had crust like this before.  Thank you,

I made this to take to a going away party at work for a colleague. It was a total hit! I had people IMing me all afternoon asking if I made the Bunt cake and could they have the recipe. The only thing different I did was to add a tsp. of lemon extract because I like it. Obviously, I wasn't the only one.

I absolutely loved this recipe. After reading a few reviews, I did tweek it a little. I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder and I added 2 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also turned the oven to 325 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I thought the sugar was too much, but some how it came out great and not overly sweet. It also was very moist!!!

this is my first time making pound cake. it turned out real  moist . I would definitely make it again.but I think I would add more vanilla and more mace in the I would use real butterhopefully that would give it a little bit better flavoring.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great and gets rave reviews. This time my 14yr old niece helped and was a little rough with the "folding" in of the dry ingredients but the cake turned out perfectly. I added 1TBS of vanilla. It was so moist we ate it straight off the plate without whipped cream! Next time I'll try adding some orange or lemon extract for a change.

Wow!! This is my grandmother's sour cream pound cake recipe too!!  It is always a hit at every holiday or get together.  I love the flavor the mace brings to the recipe.

This cake was so moist & delicious, I didn't add 1 tsp. of salt, I only used 1/4 tsp & it came out perfect. Thanks for this recipe. I will be making it often.

The cake comes out to be light and wonderfully flavorful, though I admit I followed one reviewer's suggestion and increased the amount of vanilla by a bit when I found I didn't have mace.

First of all, this makes A LOT of cake.  I made it per the recipe but cut butter to 1 3/4 cups, cut sugar to 1 1/4 cups, added a touch more vanilla, used no mace, and added about 1/4 cup of pinapple juice as I was making upside down cake.  I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  I baked at 325 and used a sheet pan.  Cake took a little over 2 hours to fully bake.  And the cake is PHENOMENAL.  Awesome, moist, perfect crumb, light, fluffy, buttery, just delicious.  This is a keeper, but I think I'll cut the recipe in half next time.

I modify this into a RUM cake by adding a tablespoon of red rum and rum flavoring.  I left out the mace.

The aroma as this was baking was mouth-watering and the flavor and texture were wonderful.  I baked this in two loaf pans at 325 for 55 minutes.  Will use one for trifle and freeze the other for another day.

Grandmasssssssss had it going on!!!!!!!!!I have made many pound cakes doing baking competitions and this is a very moist and perfect texture for a pound cake. I did add one teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of almond extract. I also used a half of cup of shortening and a cup and half of butter. Loved it !!!!!!!The best cake recipe I have tried on here.Thanks Grandma
