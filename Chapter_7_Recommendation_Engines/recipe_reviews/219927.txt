I want to make pickled sausages like the Penrose brand or a Louisianan brand.
I’m not a beginner I’ve been canning and pickling since the late “70’s”. I’ve pickled eggs, beets, green tomatoes, okra etc.  I’ve made this recipe twice and there is no way two 14 ounce packages will fit in a quart jar let alone with onion and banana peppers.  The 1st time I followed it exactly and I thought it had way to much spice and the Little Smokies’ shouldn’t be boiled they are a fully cooked product. The second time I didn’t boil them and I cut all spices in ½ added 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 6 whole garlic cloves, left out the pepper rings. This time they are edible but get a little better now that they have set for a week. I will keep trying to get the recipe I want but this is not it – too many flavors going on and non of it is the sausage. Sorry to poster and thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a really interesting idea. I can see how it COULD work for me but as  written, it just didn't. I think it's something in the pickling spices that turned me off. Gave me something to think about, though. Thanks, smitty. :o)

I made two jars, one as written and the other I cooked and simmered the little smokies for 20 minutes in boiling water. Opening them after 3 weeks in the fridge, I preferred the ones that were cooked, they seemed less "grainy" from their fat. I found the pickling juice also way too tart for my tastes, and next time I will throw in 3/4 cup of light brown sugar to sweeten it out a bit. I did like the pickling mix and will hold on to that for other recipes, thanks.
