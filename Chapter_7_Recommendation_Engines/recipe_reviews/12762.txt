I've been using this recipie since 2001, and I've made a few adjustments, and it always turns out great.  I don't use any celery, and I omit the condensed golden mushroom soup.  I add 1 small can tomato sauce to the rotel tomatoes.  Also,I add 2 cloves of garlic in with the onions and bell peppers.  You can use frozen crawfish tails, or shrimp too!  For spices I add 1 bay leaf, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and Tony Chachere's to taste.  My whole family loves it everytime I make it, and it is a great recipie to double for company.

Not at all traditional Cajun or otherwise. To clarify: I've had this dish before, and it is fine (good even) as a crawfish dish, but it's not an etoufee. For one, it's missing a roux. "Etoufee" is French for burned/burnt, which means, you've gotta burn something (hence, the roux). Also, traditional Cajun/Creole cooking does not involve any condensed soups. If you're looking for an etoufee, there are plenty of good recipes on here (look for butter or oil and flour in the recipe). But if you just want to have a nice, creamy crawfish dish, this'll do.

I actually live in Louisiana, in Acadiana, and I actually am a Cajun, and I recognize this recipe. We make it all the time. My grandmother tells me she stole it from Picadilly! We love it, and it doesn't take much watching.

I grew up and still live in the heart of "Cajun country" and I just wanted to tell you that there is NO TOMATO in crafish etoufee.

Obviously not authentic, but still pretty yummy! I used Campbell's soup and RoTel tomatoes with green chile peppers and I used shrimp instead of crawfish. Nice easy recipe, made a lot!

I love this recipe.  I've been using it for seveal years.  I've passed it on to my family members and they use it too.  It's quick and easy to make.

I've had "real" etoufee in the and this recipe may not be authentic, but it pretty close and tasty for "cheap knock off".  I understand that many Cajun's will prob disagree, but I love this recipe, and so do many of my friends and family, especially when you can turn up the spice just right to where makes your nose run!

I'm not sure if this recipe is authentic or not (probably not) but it tastes pretty good for a quick and easy meal.  Like one of the other reviewers, I omitted the can of golden mushroom soup and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to give it more flavor.

I don't know how authentic this is, but I do know it tastes great. I did add about 1 teaspoon of tomato paste in with the simmer and sprinkled chopped green onions on top before serving. This is definitely a keeper.

If you don't like to cook and are looking for an easy recipe (like me) this is a must!  My husband and I loved it!  I just added some Creole seasoning and Louisana Hot Sauce to it.

got this recipe originally about 25 years ago in the Baton Rouge Advocate!  Born & Raised on cajun food and this is a great recipe.  Love it, it is  much easier than making a traditional roux (which I do for gumbo).  We cut down on the celery since it is not a family fave but even my teen who is learning to cook can make it and we all love it.  Shrimp can be substituted easily, raw & peeled, will cook in about 5 minutes in sauce.

I have tried this recipe for a few years now.  Try and add crab boil when you add the rotel tomatoes.  Or you may try the powder version...just a thought!!  Chad

My daughter wouldn't eat it but that was my fault for telling her it was crawfish!!  I am from New Orleans and this was the equivalent to a McDonald's etoufe.

I am from Louisiana and am very picky about cajun food.  I must say that this recipe is pretty good for how easy it is to make.  I added about half a can of tomato sauce to get a nice color and a little tanginess, left the celery out (not a big fan) and it came out fairly well.  I also spiced it up with cayenne pepper, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.  Next time I may add a splash of cream to smooth it out a bit.  Otherwise, this recipe is a decent base and with some tweaking may end up a ~monthly meal.  Thank you!  P.S.  It is a sin to serve this without buttered french bread and Tabasco.

I've tried this recipe with crawfish and it was excellent, but it's hard to get really fresh crawfish, so I've used chicken instead and it's deliscious.  Took it to work and fed a dozen people and had to print out copies of the recipe for everyone that tried it!  Shrimp works well too!  Thanks for the good eats.

I am eating it right now. I made two changes to the recipe. I absolutely hate bell peppers. I left them out because of this. For the tomatoes, I went with a can of the Rotel hot version. I love spicy foods. These tomatoes have habenaros in it. This made it very spicy, but I love it that way.
I will definitely be making this again. Awesome recipe.
