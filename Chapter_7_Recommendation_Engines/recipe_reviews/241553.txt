This is the best 100% buckwheat pancakes I have made.  Fairly simple and tasty.  I doubled the batch when I made it.  My only substitution was buttermilk, since I never buy it.  Whenever I need buttermilk I mix 1:3 parts greek yogurt and whole milk.

I was looking for a simple buckwheat pancakes recipe. I substituted a few items: I used coconut sugar, almond milk (instead of buttermilk), and coconut oil (instead of butter) to cook in. It came out very good. I will make again.

These were amazing! Light and delicious. I added two tablespoons melted butter, a little cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. I also used Maines Bouchards Farms Buckwheat flour. Sooo good! Mainegal.

I had previously made this recipe as is.  Because we loved the pancakes so much, I decided to make them again.  Because I had only 1/2 cup of buckwheat flour, I used gluten-free flour for the rest.  They were absolutely delicious!  Oh - I had two left and froze them.  They freeze very well, and reheating does not diminish the flavor.

Best buckwheat pancakes ever! Light and fluffy and delicious! Mine were MUCH darker than the other pictures though... I used 100% organic stone - ground buckwheat flour which was very dark. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used Greek yogurt and water using a ratio of 1:3 respectively. My batter was still a bit thick so I added a few tablespoons of milk. I think letting the batter sit helped make them tender, fluffy, and delicious! These will definitely be made often. I will never buy a mix again!

Will definitely be making these again, I was wanting to use buckwheat because of its high protein content and it worked great in these pancakes! Very light and fluffy. The only changes were I used regular milk since I have no buttermilk, and I added blueberries. Delicious! :)

This recipe is so good, I've decided to post my first ever review (despite using allrecipes for years!).  Have tried dozens of pancake recipes trying to find something semi-healthy the entire family will enjoy.  This is it.  No modifications necessary, but this recipe takes changes well.  We added some melted butter and a bit more milk.  Makes pretty pancakes with a hearty, grainy flavor that goes well with anything... maple syrup and cream for the kids, fruit preserves for the bigger kids, even ripe avocado with melted butter and pepper for the true health nut.  Thank you to the chef!

We were in the mood for waffles and this recipe did the trick!  I set my waffle iron to the darkest setting and still needed to add about 30 seconds, but these were delicious.

I served them with butter, blueberries and pure maple syrup.

I will make these again.

Thank you, Chef John

Yes, you CAN make VERY GOOD and tasty fluffy pancakes with 100% buckwheat flour using THIS recipe. I just made them. YUMMY! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used what I had at hand; 1 cup almond milk and 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar and add about 2 T half and half. I also used 2 T maple syrup instead of sugar. This turned out fantastic! I used Bob's Mill organic whole grain buckwheat flour (the grey color). Next time I will try this recipe with Anthony's organic buckwheat flour, which is in white color with no hulls and makes fluffier buckwheat bread (100% buckwheat, 2 t yeast) than Bob's.

This a wonderful recipe. I've tweaked it a bit. Added cinnamon as others suggested. Instead of white sugar I use maple syrup (the real stuff).  Regular (non fat) milk (don't usually buy buttermilk-although I'm sure that would be delicious.)  The "big" change is I add 1/3 cup of instant (no sugar added) oatmeal.  It gives the recipe added body.  If you would rather use old fashioned oatmeal then soak those in the liquids for 30 minutes before adding all the other ingredients. Because of the added oatmeal you will need to add more liquids  I also cook them with blueberries or cut up bananas.  I always have left overs and eat those for breakfast during the week.  I find these pancakes are very hearty and "rib sticking".  I mean that in a good way. :-)

This was a very easy recipe.  The only changes that I made was adding  a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and increasing the vanilla to a teaspoon.  These pancakes are light and delicious.

I had never made buckwheat pancakes before, so didn't really know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. These were very good. Some tips for other buckwheat newbies: 1) the consistency of the batter is odd, but the pancakes are perfect; 2) I had to cook them at a much lower temperature than I usually use for pancakes; 3) letting the batter rest makes a significant difference, but after you let it rest, resist the urge to stir it any more.

Made these today and they were great!  I did add extra sugar (I have a sweet tooth) and since i’m Dairy free, I switched out the buttermilk for whole fat coconut milk.  Delicious!! Thanks for this recipe!

If you use high quality buckwheat flour then these are delicious "as is". I've made this recipe a half dozen times and everyone in my house enjoys them. I always make extra and freeze them in stacks of three for quick weekday breakfasts!

Makes incredible pancakes! I didn't have buttermilk, so used 1 tablespoon of lemon for each cup of whole milk and it turned out great.

I first had these served at a Greek Orthodox Church function. I fell in love...  I am trying to stay clear of wheat and refined foods as well. These are PERFECT!!! So much more flavor than any traditional pancakes. A must try, you will love them..

I  liked this pancake a lot. I did make sour milk with a bit of vinegar and I added a couple of tablespoons of butter to the batter . They were very good with a bit of fresh fruit on the side and real maple syrup.

Finally buckwheat pancakes that taste like buckwheat! I also enjoy them more because they don't contain wheat, which gives me a stomach ache. 
When making them again, I will probably try adding some melted butter to the batter, or maybe a mashed banana as they were a bit dry.

Great recipe, I double the recipe and use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of coconut flour in place of similar amount of the buckwheat flour. I also use 1T chia seeds mixed with 3T warm water and left to sit for 10 minutes, per egg, and swap out buttermilk for butter-goats or coconut-milk, adding 1T vinegar per cup of goat or coconut milk. And use golden sugar as I prefer the taste ??

I was looking for a buckwheat pancake recipe that I could make gluten and lactose free. So glad I found this one because they turned out soooo good! I substituted vanilla soy milk for the buttermilk and vanilla, and cooked them in light olive oil instead of butter. Great nutty flavor with nice crispy edges.

I was really glad to find a recipe for pancakes made from 100% buckwheat, and not a little buckwheat plus a lot of white flour, or a little buckwheat, a little whole wheat, a little soy powder, a little this, a little that . . .   These are simple and tasty. My one change was to melt the tablespoon of butter and put it into the batter, and then use grapeseed oil on the griddle--as little as I could manage. The advice to wait until the edges are dry before flipping is EXCELLENT.

Never before have I been able to make pancakes which are light and fluffy and also incredibly healthy. This recipe is absolutely brilliant. 
The batter does take a little longer to cook than regular pancakes, however, I just put the first few on a plate in the oven on a very low temperature while I cooked the rest. With regular pancakes, the oven heat can dry out or harden the pancakes, but these buckwheat pancakes remained light & soft in the oven. Amazing.

I am not a fan of the taste of buckwheat but need to avoid gluten so I suffer it. With this recipe, I enjoyed the texture and look of a wheat flour pancake with only a hint of the buckwheat taste. I have tried a couple other buckwheat pancake recipes, but this one is the best. 
I think the buttermilk is a must to balance the earthiness of the buckwheat. And make sure you let the batter sit for a couple minutes to thicken.

I've tried several buckwheat pancake recipes but this is the first one that I would make again and serve with confidence.  It's easy and quick, and the results are fantastic. Last time I made them with fresh blueberries (1 cup) at room temperature added to the batter just before cooking.  Yummy!

These were fast, simple and delicious. I added a smooshed up banana and used brown sugar instead of regular. Next time will 
add some cinnamon.

Delicious recipe! I added a few ingredients to this recipe. I added 2TBL of melted butter to the dry ingredients and mixed and blended it well with my fingers. I also added 2TBL spoons of honey to the dry ingredients as well and used almond milk instead of buttermilk. It's important to mix the butter and honey well with the dry ingredients otherwise it will not incorporate well with the cold wet ingredients. I also added a mashed banana. Even my kids loved these pancakes and they are really not fans of buckwheat!

Made these exactly according to the recipe.  The texture was great but the depth of flavor was a little lacking.  Next time will try adding a few tablespoons of melted butter and a little more sugar to the batter.

Love this recipe! I had to make some tweaks since I didn’t have every ingredient on hand. I didn’t have buttermilk so I swapped that for organic whole milk, which required only one cup of milk since it’s not as thick as buttermilk. 
I also swapped regular sugar for stevia. I only had baking powder but no baking soda, so I hoped for the best and thankfully it turned out just fine!

These were delicious!  I’ve never had buckwheat pancakes but wanted to try them.  This recipe was perfect.  I did not have buttermilk so added in a tbsp of vinegar to the milk and let it sit for a few.  I forgot to add in the sugar to the batter but it didn’t need it anyway.  I did add in some cinnamon and a bit of almond extract with vanilla extract.  That’s just personal preference though, not because the recipe needed it.  Will definitely make these again!

Dry and thin when making as written. I doctored the rest of the batter after the first pancakes came off the pan and were taste tested. I had to almost double the flour, add another egg, and more of the salt, baking powder and soda. I also used Splenda in place of sugar and added maple extract with the vanilla, something I always do when making pancakes. They were still dry, but I think that that's a condition of buckwheat. Next time I'll tinker and do half whole wheat and see if that helps. Whole wheat also soaks up more liquid.

The pancakes in the photo for the recipe look too pale to be made with buckwheat flour. Ours was much darker, which made it a bit hard to figure out when they were done and when they are starting to burn.  I added two mashed bananas to the recipe. I thought they were pretty good, but one of the kids didn't like it.

This is an easy recipe and the buckwheat has a much better flavor than regular flour, I’m probably going to stick with this from now on when my family wants pancakes. It is easy to get the pan too hot over a gas flame, so I make sure to turn it down soon after I pour the pancakes.

These are the best pancakes ever....better than any I have had in my 73 years of life.  So light and tasty too.   I made no changes other than using unsweetened soy milk and added lemon juice to it to make a buttermilk alternative.  (1 1/4 cup soy milk + 2Tbls lemon juice — and let sit for 5 minutes while putting the dry ingredients together).   My husband used to ask for pancakes in past and I would make them, but not enthusiastically because pancakes were always so heavy before...now he doesn’t even have to ask as these are so light and good!  Thank you Chef John!

Excellent- flavoursome, light and fluffy.  Because I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I used plain yoghurt instead and an extra 1/2 cup water.

These turned out so awesome! 

I'm not very good at following directions, and changed it up a little. Had no buttermilk, so I used plain yogurt and water (about 50/50). The batter was quite think, and the first pancake was a little dense, so I added a splash more water, and a bit more baking soda. Put some frozen blueberries in one, and served with fresh peaches and whipped cream.

This was THE  BEST Buckwheat PANCAKE recipe that I've ever made.  Light and fluffy, and delicious.  I doubled it for my granddaughter, husband and I LOVE them.  I did exactly what the recipe called for word for word.  YES  you can use all buckwheat flour, I just did it an hour ago.  "Bravo"to the chef!

The only thing I did different, I never use butter on the griddle, I use avocado oil all the time.

Best buckwheat pancake recipe by far! And I’ve tried a few. I use 1:3 vanilla Greek yogurt to milk instead of buttermilk and use coconut sugar instead if white. I top them with either berries or peanut butter, banana and hemp seeds.

First I try the recipe exactly as written and the pancakes were delicious. 
The second time I added a banana to the mix and it tasted great as well.

No changes and YES you can make great pancakes with Buckwheat alone! I followed Chef John's recipe to a T and they turned out yummy! Being gluten intolerant, they are very satisfying and filling. Lately, I add 1/4 cup vinegar to regular milk to make buttermilk (Can't buy small containers of it) and add 2 TBLPs of lemon juice. Yum)

This is my first time to make buckwheat pancakes and they were wonderful! The only change I made was Greek vanilla yogurt and vanilla almond milk for the buttermilk (1:3 ratio).  Added some blueberries and yum!! Very filling.

Added chocolate chips and some arrowroot powder to thicken a little. Made my own buttermilk using coconut milk. And my highly food sensitive daughter loves them. Been making it since I found the recipe about a month ago! Thank you!

Had buckwheat flour from our local Deercreek Malthouse. Wanting to try a 100% buckwheat recipe, we were NOT DISAPPOINTED! These pancakes were fluffy, and, although a dense flour, delightfully light in texture. Next time, I would add more vanilla.  Dark amber maple syrup compliments the robust, almost nutty flavor. Delicious!

Beat the socks off my attempt to make buckwheat pancakes without wheat flour a few years ago, when not really in style.  Think it is extra sugar, vanilla, butter in the batter, and BUTTERMILK.   You owe yourself a breakfast or two but 1 cup of flour makes a heckuva lot of batter, even for two.

This was my first time making buckwheat pancakes and these pancakes came out great! My children age 4 and 9 asked for seconds, thirds, and forths of these pancakes! These pancakes are going to be on regular rotation at my house! My only complaint was that I wish the color was a little more appealing.

I had to make my own buckwheat flour from groats and mix my own buttermilk from a powder, but the extra work was worth it for these lovely, fluffy, flavorful pancakes!

Batter was thin so I added more buckwheat which resulted in a drier pancake. Will try with thin batter next time. 

I did however want a gingerbread flavored pancake so I changed some things. 

Did 1 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup molasses, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2tsp cloves.

Chef John you have made the ultimate buckwheat pancake recipe.  I have told so many people about it.  They are light and fluffy and just the right texture.  My husband and friends loved them so much.  We ate every bite and they were delish!
Thank you for this recipe.  You are a treasure.  I am looking forward to more recipes from you.  :)

Extremely tasty recipe that is perfect with maple syrup and bacon or sausage.  Using only buckwheat flour gives it a wonderfully nutty flavor that is so much better than plain buttermilk pancakes.

These are good - light and fluffy.  If you're not a syrup fan you'll want to add a bit more sugar to sweeten them up.

Just made and ate a plate of these and they are wonderful!!! I did not have any baking soda and used almond milk but they were still awesome! I also added some blueberries. I’ve been on a diet this summer and avoiding white flour. I tried a few almond/coconut flour pancake recipes and they were disgusting. I am so excited that these are so good!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are delicious. Light (for pancakes), flavorful and easy to make. Added chopped walnuts and blueberries. Substituted kefir for buttermilk. Used cooking spray in the pan to cut back on fat.

After reading a critical review, I used 1/4 C. Gluten-free flour and 3/4 C. Buckwheat flour.  I also melted a Tablespoon of butter and added that with the liquid ingredients.  This was amazing!  So glad I tried it.  Light and fluffy and tasty!

Great recipe!  You can't expect them to taste like wheat flour pancakes.  That being said, they were light and fluffy for buckwheat.  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and added 2 tablespoons of vinegar to turn it into buttermilk.  My first pancake was heavy because I didn't let the oil get hot enough.  After that, I made sure the oil was hot and the rest of the pancakes were fluffy. Excellent recipe. I'm dairy- free so no butter, I used grapeseed oil.  I also added 3 teaspoons of coconut sugar and I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

I made exactly as recipe. I made some with blueberries and some plain.  The plain were on the dry side.  My  teenage son asked for  syrup- we never use syrup...
I made some bananas foster and topped the plain ones.

I bought several packages of  Bob's Red Mill organic buckwheat flour because it was a discontinued item at the grocery store and remembering how good the buckwheat pancakes were at IHOP when they used to offer it.  This recipe is really delicious and I like that there is no additionaI flour.  I did add chia seeds into the mix and topped it off with grass fed butter and agave syrup.  Yum yum.  This will be my go to pancake breakfast from now on.

I was craving buckwheat pancakes, but most mixes and recipes add regular wheat flour (I am very intolerant to wheat).  I was skeptical that these either wouldn't turn out correctly and/or would taste awful.  Neither of those came true!  I followed the recipe as-is. I'll never make pancakes any other way ever again!  Fluffy and perfect-tasting.

I had trouble with these. Maybe it was my buckwheat flour, but they were way too sour and texture wasn't that great compared to other buckwheat pancakes I've made. It seemed to me that the mixture had too much gluten/protein. I added more water to thin it out but it was still very stringy/protein rich as if it was made with bread flour. Maybe all buckwheat flour isn't the same. I like the "Tasty Buckwheat Pancakes" recipe better that uses 1/4 buckwheat flour.

I made this and plan on making it again, perhaps substituting coconut milk for buttermilk.
Mine were light and airy in texture, dark in color.  Looking forward to making more.

Very nice texture, and they are fluffy. I ground my own buckwheat flour, didn't have quite enough, so added 1/4 c spelt flr.  The only thing I found objectionable is the strong baking powder /soda taste. Seems a lot of leavening for the small amount of flour. Otherwise, great with blueberries simmered a bit with maple syrup.

I made these for my husband who needs to eat gluten free. They turned out delicious and the kids even loved them. Instead of following the recipe exactly, I made some changes based on other reviews.  I used 2 tablespoons of sugar, a drizzle of molasses, a pinch of cinnamon and used 2 tablespoons of melted butter. This is my new go to pancake recipe!

I love buckwheat pancakes and these are far and above the best I've ever eaten.  They are light and fluffy and so tasty.

These are amazing. My 2 year and 6 year old devour these things. Only thing I change is I add an over ripe banana -mashed, and cinnamon. So good!

I made these and they were great!!  I did make a few changes though.  I used no buckwheat flour and added coconut flour instead, replaced the buttermilk with regular milk, added a scoop of both soy AND pea protein, and a spoonful of cinnamon.  I didn't have any vanilla extract so I left it out.  Also I used only baking powder because baking soda is gross.

I made a couple of changes to accommodate my egg and milk allergy and these still came out great - especially with blueberries!  I substituted the 'flax seed/water' mixture for the egg and 'unsweetened almond milk/apple cider vinegar' for the buttermilk.  Thank you for this recipe!

I made a few changes: used stevia,  egg whites, water , coconut oil  to fry them, salt substitute  and coconut milk. I topped them with a syrup made of ghee, stevia and vanilla extract.
I made my own buckwheat flour from hulled buckwheat. So I think that's why they were actually pretty light in color.
These were still delicious!

I found this recipe for my husband who loves buckwheat pancakes. I never expected to like them as well. But, man, we both love them! They are tasty, tender, and not at all gritty like other buckwheat pancakes. I now make these about once a month instead of buttermilk pancakes.

It tastes fab, i used 1 cup semi-skimmed milk and 1/4 cup greek yogurt instead of buttermilk and used 2 egg whites instead of a large egg as i have lots of egg whites to use.

Oh & i cooked it using coconut oil instead of butter... stunning!

My family enjoyed these pancakes.  It's gluten free and has lower carbs than the traditional buttermilk pancake recipe.  I added 1/4 cup of canola oil to add some moisture to the pancakes.

Easy and tasty, with a nice nutty flavor, these 100% buckwheat pancakes were very enjoyable.  I still prefer buckwheat pancakes to have a little AP flour to lighten them up though.
