Because I commute 1 hour each way to work, I simplify this recipe. I also use more ground beef, 1#, I buy the cubed hash browned potatoes in the freezer section, along with the frozen diced onions. I use whole milk, and make this recipe as stated. I shave lots of time from assemblage with the 'easy' ingredients. Very hearty, creamy, filling on a cold winter's night. My family loves this, we have been making it for about 5 years now, I was surprised to find it on this site. To thicken this use potato flakes, it works great! The potato flakes make it a richer, thicker soup with substance.

This recipe was okay (as it was written)...I am only giving it 3 stars because as it is written, I do not love it.  But after changes were made it was a pretty good cold day soup.  I did not use the celery or carrots, that is not on a cheeseburger.  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and the second time I made it I used velvetta instead of cheddar.  Cheddar does not get that creamy when melted.  I am going to try a pasta in it next time instead of the potatoes.  All in all, good basis for a very filling soup.

I was frantically searching for a similar recipe featured in one of the first editions of Taste of Home. It's my husband's favorite, and I lost the recipe! I couldn't get it quite right until this one! I also add one seeded, minced jalapeno, crumbled bacon, and some cayanne to the adult's portions. He thinks I found the original recipe, but this one's even better!!

I really liked this soup.  The only thing I changed was adding two cloves of chopped garlic, some fried bacon and Valvetta vs cheddar.  I also used frozen cubed hashbrown potatos only because thats what I had.  To the person who said they didn't add the celery & carrots because thats not in a cheeseburger, no wonder you gave it only 3 stars.  This is soup, not a cheeseburger and virtually every good soup starts with onions, celery & carrots (and garlic in my opinion).  I served this to a group of 6 guys during a fishing trip and it got 12 enthusiastic thumbs up.

I'VE MADE THIS SAME SOUP FOR YEARS. THE KEY TO MAKING THIS IS TO ADD THE FLOUR/BUTTER MIXTURE TO THE VEGGIES AND COOKING ON MED. HIGH FOR TWO MINUTES BEFORE ADDING THE MILK. THE KIDS LOVE IT.

This soup is so velvetey smooth and delicious. I did do it alittle different though. I made mine in a crock pot so what I did was: cook the hamburger in a skillet and when that was done I quickly put all the vegetables (onions, carrots, celery and potatoes) in the skillet with the flour, butter and some of the chicken stock to deglaze. After a few minutes I put the hamburger, vegetables and chicken stock in the crock and let cook all day. Then about 1/2 hour before we ate I put the cheese, milk and sour cream in the crockpot and let melt/cook. Wonderful!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I have made this for my husband and I several times. I make it just as the recipe states and it turns out perfect every time.  I use my food processor to chop the veggies and it makes the soup a perfect consistency.  You may like to experiment with different chesses and you might want to add alittle more hamburger to it... but I don't think it's that necessary.  I always double the batch and freeze half for a later date.  It reheats very well.

I would give it a 6 if i could--- Everyone loves this soup. I use shredded cheese instead but I've made it more than once and it is perfect! It makes more than enough for our 3 person family. And it warms up nicely.

As is, delicious but very watery, which isn't what I'd imagined while drooling over the recipe. TRY THIS: the second time, I doubled the cheese and beef (ground steak, instead) and added the potato as pre-cooked and prepared mash half-way through - this was a thicker, silky-textured chowder which is much more what the title evokes. (NB use fresh flat-leaf parsley and fresh basil, as dried parsley is one of the most tasteless and pointless of dried herbs :-)  ) I was also inspired to abandon the soup idea and make it as a kind of cheese con carne, served on the plate risotto-style (slightly down-sized the seasoning to avoid it being over-rich). Its worth a try! :-)

Good and filling!  Cut the recipe in half (just the husband and I) and it made enough for two very large meals.  Here are the things I did differently: 1. Used 1/2 lb 90/10 hamburger, browned and set aside. In the same pan melt 3 tbsp salted butter, add 3/4 c each DICED (unpeeled) carrots, onions, and celery.  Add 2-3 cloves of garlic  2. Cook until soft and add 1/8 c flour.  3. Cook for a minute or so and slowly add 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk.  Then add 1 can (14.5 oz) reduced sodium beef broth.  4. Add 2 teaspoons dried basil, 1 tsp dried parsley, salt and pepper to taste.  5. Used 2 cups frozen Potatoes O'Brien from OreIdea.  6. Grated a 8 oz block of sharp cheddar cheese - the pre-shredded stuff won't melt as well!! and used 1/8 c light sour cream.  7.  Topped with chopped fresh basil, a dollop of sour cream, chopped bacon, AND CHOPPED DILL PICKLES!!!  The dill pickles 100% made the soup for me.  I would never make the soup without them again.  8. Added Tabasco CHIPOTLE Pepper Sauce to taste - FANTASTIC flavor added.

This is my family's favorite soup~hands down.  I make it often.  It is time-consuming to make all at once so sometimes I prepare the vegetables a day ahead and refrigerate them until needed.  I also use frozen hashbrowns in place of the potatoes, to save time and because they are the perfect size.  This soup is wonderful!!

This soup is heavenly. I have made several changes, it makes it so much easier--I just melt some butter and sautee' the hamburger, MINCED onions (if my teenagers see an onion, they revolt), carrots, and celery in a pan, bring the broth to a boil in a big pot (I use more than is called for) and throw in FROZEN FRENCH FRIES to boil for a few minutes--they cook quickly, they are delicious, it is so much less work, AND when I called this soup "cheeseburger and french fries soup", all the teenagers gobbled it up, and they loved it--they would not have tried it otherwise. When the french fries have boiled for a few minutes, I throw in the sauteed meat and veggies and let them all bubble together for a few minutes more. I warm two cups (or more) of half and half, and shake it up with 1/2 cup or so of flour--add it to the bubbling brew, and it thickens instantly. (Add a little cornstarch in water if it is not thick enough). Then I add the cheese and the sour cream. Everyone at my house shouts for joy when they smell this cooking...and I never have leftovers to pack for my lunch!

This was great! I didn't add carrots (not a big fan) and added can of tomato paste and a can of "no salt added" diced tomatoes. My husband had two bowls of it!! We're having leftovers tonight! Thanks for the recipe

This soup was good but similar to a potato soup recipe I already have (no beef). I used chunks of Velveeta because I like creamy/cheesy soups and turned out fine. Even though it was tasty and we all enjoyed, I think I'll stick with my meatless version of this soup.  Thanks anyways!

I decided to make just as the recipe says - I'm always hesitant to do this with all the reviews that make changes.  It was REALLY good.  My husband even took left overs to work for a couple of days for lunch.  He would text me at lunch how good the soup was.  Four Stars are because I don't think the name represents the true flavor of the soup even though the flavor is Yummy.  Make as is before changes :-)

Amazing!  This recipe is a great comfort food.  The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 bag of thawed hashbrowns in place of the cubed potatoes.  Yum!

I've made this twice now - once with a ground beef substitute (I don't eat meat) and the second time with black beans.  Both times I've made it without carrots and the second time I used half mozzarella and half cheddar.  Tasted great both times, although I'm guessing my husband will prefer the ground beef to the beans.

Great recipe Auntylene!  This one went right to #1 in the soup section of my recipe box.  My teens love this one in their thermos for lunch.  Great way to get those veggies into them (I even snuck some broccoli in and they loved it ... Ha!).  I too used fresh herbs, a good white cheddar, and reduced salt beef broth.  Bonus stars for coming up with a lunch bag winner that's healthy, appeals to kids/teens, and freezes well.  XO

I doubled the ground beef (1 lb) & used 4 cups of cheese (2 c sharp cheddar/2 c mild cheddar). I increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup, added a tsp of garlic powder & a dash of pepper to taste. I boiled the potatoes in a pot of water on the side & added to the soup at the end. Serve with garlic bread.

With some alterations, this really does taste like a cheeseburger in soup form! Like many, I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, used Velveeta instead of cheddar, and smooshed the potatoes a bit to thicken the soup.  Additionally, I added black pepper, a touch of cumin (which I compulsively put in almost everything), and two healthy hits of Worchestershire sauce.  The Worchestershire sauce definitely was a good call to give it a more "burger" than "really fancy potato" soup taste.  Also chopped up four big mushrooms and added them halfway through the potato cooking stage.  I did need to simmer the potatoes an extra 10-15 minutes.  Definitely will make again, especially if it freezes as well as everyone says!

This is one of our faves, but I make it low fat. I either use 96% lean beef or ground turkey, as well as skim milk, more veggies, fat free sour cream and low fat cheddar. This revised recipe has all the flavor with a fraction of the fat and calories.

I liked the basic recipe and adapted it for a slow cooker. I set slow cooker on "high" and added hot chicken stock (microwaved in a 4-cup Pyrex measuring cup). I sautéed diced potatoes in 2 tbsp. olive oil in 10-inch skillet for the first 3 minutes. Meanwhile I diced onions and celery and added to potatoes. I had no carrots but found parsnips and cut them up in small pieces. I added them to mixture and sautéed mixture another 3-5 minutes. Potatoes had nicely browned, so I sprinkled 1/4 cup flour to veggie mixture and tossed to coat before stirring into to slow cooker containing broth. Using same skillet I added ground beef (90/10 meat/fat) and broke up while cooking. When no long pink I added parsley and basil AND chopped celery leaves (they add a nice flavor to meat). I cooked for another minute before adding meat mixture to slow cooker. I covered slow cooker and cooked on HIGH for 2 hours. I added milk and cheese and heated for another 1/2 hour. I turned off slow cooker before adding 8 oz. of plain greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). The soup was creamy but not too thick--perfect for me. Here's the real game saver: after serving into bowls drizzle the top with your favorite catsup. You can swirl or marble it for artsy presentation. The catsup adds to the cheeseburger taste even more!

DELICIOUS! My only changes were to use more meat (like about 1 pound, very lean), and used Velveeta(R) instead of cheddar because I like the way that melts better. I got a little scared when it said to stir the milk into the flour mixture until smooth, because, (and I tried EVERYTHING), it would not combine. It was fine though, once I pored it into the soup it blended in perfectly. Super simple and really great flavor. I know I'll be making this soup often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Hubby and son went back for seconds and everyone else said they liked this. I had a couple more small potatoes than called for that needed to be used up so I threw those in and added an additional cup of low sodium chicken stock. I also cut back the sour cream to approx, 1/8 cup (personal pref). My family likes sharp white cheddar so that it what I used. Very comforting and filling and I'm sure we will enjoy this again in the cooler months to come. Thanks for sharing!

I hate it when I don't have positive things to say, but I have to admit that sometimes negative reviews help me more than positive.  That being said, here goes...This was very average soup.  Not bad, but not great either.  I would have given it three stars, but considering how much chopping is required it's just not worth all the effort.  I found it rather bland and didn't like how the hamburger was tough after all that cooking.  Sorry!!

this is an ok soup.  i found it to be lacking something.  i used velveeta not cheddar and maybe that was the problem.  it needs a little zing as it's quite bland.  i used tabasco sauce (a few dashes) but it didn't help.  i was really hoping to like this but i don't think i'll make it again.

After seeing this soup in the daily email, I was excited to try it.  In the end, I didn't see what is special about it.  It came out under seasoned and thin.  After seasoning, and adding dry milk to thicken it, it was satisfactory.  I did like that the carrots and celery sneak some veggies in for nutritional value.  For the high calories and fat content, I do not think it was indulgent enough.  I would not make this recipe again, but I'm not sad I tried it.  For fewer calories, a hearty chili would be much more satisfying.  For cheesy, creamy indulgence, I'll go for a broccoli cheese soup before making this again.

Edit: I came back to edit my review.  Two days later, after sitting in the fridge, I ate more as a leftover.  The soup was A LOT better after sitting for awhile.  The flavor profile developed more.  I give this recipe 3 stars on the day it's prepared.  I'd bump it to a 4, with more seasoning, thickening with dry milk, and sitting in the fridge for two days.

This recipe is a good general recipe.  

I ended up putting the chicken stock, seasonings, and veggies (plus some fresh garlic) together and let them cook for about 30 min.  I grabbed a good beer out of the fridge and added that to the mix. (Kona Brewing Co. Fire Rock)
I took mushrooms and some green chilies and sauteed them in a skillet.  I added the beef and browned the beef with the mushrooms and chilies. (I added wart sauce and some Montreal seasoning to the meat)  I then added the milk mixture to the soup and let that cook for about 10 min.  Added the meat mixture to the soup and let that cook for a bit.  Lastly, I added the cheese, cream cheese, and I added about a cup of Velveeta.  Let the three above melt, then serve with some bread.  

Its a variation but its very good.

Wonderful stew-like soup. Every person I've served it to has loved it, but when they hear the name they're a bit put off... so I end up just saying it's soup. :) Very versatile recipe, so I often change it up and add different veggies or cheeses, with great results every time. Perfect for cool fall or winter days.

I used 1 1/2 lbs hamburger and frozen diced potatoes.  Followed rest of recipe.  I did my veggies and hamburger then threw in the crock pot with frozen hash browns on my lunch hour.  I cooked the butter, flour and milk and added to crock pot with the cheese.  My family really enjoyed this soup.  Very filling.  We changed it up just a bit with a garnish of crumbled bacon, making it bacon cheeseburger soup.  Will make again for sure

I made this recipe for a lrge crowd and it was a sucess... I added Jimmy Dean Sausage Crumbles to it and it gave it a little kick.  I think I will add more next time.  I made it for 24 servings, used 1 package of the sausage as well as 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger meat.

Great Recipe!  I tried it with chicken broth and beef broth with success both times.  The 2nd time I used shredded cheese from Aldi and it didn't melt.  I'm not sure why, but Walmart brand did just fine.  I may try Velveeta next time.

What a delicious soup...great comfort food!  Only made a couple of changes.  We used the frozen cubed hash browns to save time, used beef broth instead of chicken and substituted mushrooms for the carrots.  I also added in a bit of chipotle powder for some kick.  The soup was a big hit with my family.  Even my picky kids liked it!

Really good soup.  Made a few changes.  First cooked the hamburger added onions and celery when the meat wasn't quite done.  Then added flour right on the meat and stirred.  I didn't need any butter. Other then that I followed the recipe and it turned out great.

This is a very good hearty soup.  The only changes I made was I used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 velveeta and I substituted corn for carrots.  I added the corn at the end while it was heating.

This soup is AWESOME!  I did follower other reviewers' suggestions and used one pound of ground beef.  I also omitted the 1 T of butter to brown the beef and drained it well.  I added a little garlic powder also.  I think next time, I will cut the amount of basil in half as it was a little overpowering.

Since we're trying to eat healthy, I did everything low-fat:  I used 1 lb ground turkey, NO butter (a little olive oil for cooking veggies in the beginning), skim milk, fat free sour cream and fat free shredded cheddar.  I was running low on potatoes, so I used about 2 cups of potatoes and made up the rest in sliced mushrooms.  Recipe turned out great.  I'd make it again!  Next time I'll try beef stock as suggested by other users.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup yesterday and it was a major hit at our house.  It's very creamy and cheesy. We did not have any cheddar cheese in the house so I made it with colby and it turned out wonderful. I wish I had know about this recipe a long time ago. :-)

Loved this soup total comfort food for a crisp fall night! The only things I changed were instead of using ground beef I used ground turkey and also only used 1/2 cheddar cheese just to cut down on calories. If someone wants more cheese they could add more to individual servings. I also didn't have basil or parsley but spiced it up with garlic, salt and pepper that's it! Simple easy and delicious!

My family absolutely loved this soup.  I too, used sharp cheddar and colby jack.  It had lots of flavor, the texture was nice and creamy.  My husband says that I need to make this again and again.  No complaints on this soup.  Thanks for posting.

It was edible, but a lot of work, chopping, dishes, and to us it tastes just like Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni, only with potatoes instead of pasta, and the occasional taste of celery....won't make again.  Instead I will continue to make Hamburger Vegetable soup from this site, which I always ALWAYS serve with Garlic Bread Fantastique from this site...it is a very flavorful soup.

Try adding 1/4 cup cooked bacon or Real Bacon Bits. mmmmmmm! I also substitute the Velveeta, just a creamier cheese to put in soup, cheddar tends to melt lumpy and oily.

Without looking at my recipe from Taste of Home, it looks the same but I use land o' lakes american cheese.  We love it.  It's actually my son's favorite and must ask for it at least once a week.  I often make a huge pot and freeze and he'll eat it after school and on weekends.  Everyone I've brought a bowl to loves it and for ladies night we each had to make a soup for dinner and I substituted the beef for ground turkey since one of the ladies does not eat red meat.  Just as good, couldn't tell the difference.

Eh. Next time I will just make my cheese soup using mashed potatoes (leftover) and what ever kind of cheese is in the fridge. The texture of this was grainy from the hamburger. And really not much flavor. Must say that my husband really liked it. But, bleh. Will not make again unless he asks for it. Sorry.

This is the perfect recipe for a cold day, especially since it doesn't take very long to make. I used 1 pound of beef and added mor cheddar cheese and sour cream. We did potatoe bread in soup and it was yummy. My husband said the soup is good, but after a few bites he said it doesn't taste as great, but I didn't think that. He is too picky of an eater and a little on the strange side :)

Very delicious.  I doubled the ground beef.  I only had a little bit of cheddar, so I used part cheddar and part mozzarella (and added tapatio sauce and cayenne pepper to liven up the milder flavor of the cheese).  I used a little bit more carrots, celery, and onion.  I also used beef broth because I had it on hand, but I imagine chicken broth would be just as delicious.

This is now a favorite!  I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper and Worchestershire sauce.  For ease I used frozen Southern Style hashbrowns.  I also used a mixture of munster and cheddar cheeses.  Great recipe!

This was just okay.  I've had some pretty good cheeseburger soups in restaurants and they don't have potatoes in them and taste more like cheeseburger.   It was an okay soup, but I wouldn't classify it as "Cheeseburger"

Made this for dinner, served with crusty whole grain bread--seriously yummy! Kids loved it, even my very picky 8 year old. Used Velveeta instead of cheddar cause it melts better and my kids like it. Also added some minced garlic. Will definitely be making this again!

I don't give anything 5 stars unless its downright awesome. This soup was definitly good and i would make it again but it wasn't downright awesome. I was contimplating between 3 or 4 stars but i decided to give it 4. The only slight modification i made to the recipe was the use of scallions because i had some around oh and a bay leaf. I think the key to this recipe, as for any recipe that calls for it, is homemade chicken stock. Chicken Stock/Broth from the store will not compare and it won't taste nearly as good. I also think its better to use a waxy type of potato like a red potato or a yukon gold in this so it will hold its shape and not break apart. The things it think you could do to improve on this recipe would be to use roasted garlic or substitue half-n-half for milk.

So GOOD!  I did add a little more  chicken broth by like a cup and a quarter!  More than I wished!  We hat THICK soups with little liquid so that what I thought this soup would be.  It wasn't so if you are debating on adding liquid....don't!!!!  It is delicious though, cheesy and meaty just like a burger ;)

Pretty good.... While not anything like a cheeseburger, this was decent nonetheless. As top reviewer Cindy Carnes did, I too streamlined prep. Instead of peeling / cubing potatoes and chopping an onion, I purchased a bag of refrigerated Simply Potatoes brand cubed potatoes with onions. To further speed prep, I subbed a bag of matchstick carrots for freshly grated ones (they worked just fine). I stuck with a half pound of beef and really wish I would have upped it to 1 lb. :( Because my hubs is not fond of sharp cheddar and I am, I compromised by using one block of the sharp variety and one block of mild. NOTES: My potatoes were not cooked thru after 12 minutes (the high end of the suggested cooking timeframe). Fifteen minutes did the trick. And, regarding the veggies.... Yes, carrots and celery seem out of place (they are not traditional garnishes found on a cheeseburger), BUT it is the veggies that add flavor to the soup so don't leave them out! One final note. This does NOT reheat well at all (we had what was left for lunch the next day and it was mediocre at best...). All in all, this was an "OK" soup, but not one I'm anxious to make in the foreseeable future. Thanks anyways, AUNTYLENE! :)

This was really good! I made it as written with no changes. I was leery of all the potatoes but it turned out really well. Thanks for a tasty soup! I think, though, next time I'll probably double the meat. Thanks again for posting!

Amazingly good! Almost addictive! I forgot to add the sour cream and the soup was still great! I did add one minced garlic clove - I can't make anything savoury without some garlic. It was great! Very easy to make, very filling and flavourful.

I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese and it was great.  I made sure I let the milk mixure thicken a lot before I added it to the soup and it made for a great consistancy.

We weren't fans.  I think it's because I had a pre-conceived idea that it would actually taste similar to a cheeseburger.  It was cheesy, and meaty, but nothing like the flavor of a cheeseburger to us.

This was good. Easy to put together, but I think I'd prefer it without the hamburger, so I guess that would just make it cheese soup!

I made this a few days ago and did not really care for it. I expected that it would taste more like a "cheeseburger," because of the name. I thought it took quite a lot of time with all of the peeling and chopping. The 1st review had a good idea of using the frozen cubed hashbrown when pinched for time. The hamburger broke into such small bits when boiled with the potatoes that it couldn't really be tasted and they became tough when that happened. Little meatballs would have been better, I think. 1/2 lb. was also very little considering it was the main ingredient in the title. The soup didn't taste quite cheesy either for having 2 full cups. Overall, it tasted like potato soup with hamburger bits. A lot cheese, ingredients, and work for the final taste. If you like regular potato soup though, you may like this.

Loved it!  I used more beef and beef broth instead of chicken.  I also seasoned with salt & pepper.  Next time I am going to try it without the celery and carrot since it was a little odd having it in it.

I made this early this morning as a quick soup. I did add a couple cloves of minced garlic that I sauteed with the other vegetables and I used organic chicken broth. To cut back on the fat a bit, I used ground turkey and I only needed one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to saute the vegetables in. I did not need the flour. I only needed about 1/4 cup of fat free evaporated milk to make the soup creamy and 1/2 cup of reduced fat sharp white cheddar to give it the flavor without adding much fat. I used reduced fat sour cream. To really cut back the carbs, I used four cups cauliflower that I cooked in the organic chicken broth to up the flavor. I know it's quite a bit of changes but it all lightened the soup quite a bit for me and was hearty without being heavy. Not quite cheeseburger soup for me, but tasty nonetheless and I appreciated that it was done in under thirty minutes. NOTE: After taste-testing it, I did add a touch of dijon mustard and a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. Next time, I'll add some chopped organic red pepper.

Right now I've got this soup simmering on the stovetop waiting patiently for dinner, but after the couple spoonfull "tests" I've done already, I'm about 20 seconds from eating it straight from the pot!!!  I followed the recipe, omitting the veggies as I didn't have any on hand.  I am lazy tonight, so I used canned diced potatoes to speed up the process, and you'd never know the difference.    For the cheese I used 1/2 and 1/2.  Half a bag of Velvita Shreds, and 1/2 a bag of a 3 cheese crumble with Montey Jack, Cheddar and Colby.  I did add a few red pepper flakes, and I seasoned the beef with onion soup mix (I do this to EVERYTHING!!!).  I also fried up some bacon to crumble on top of each bowl, and threw just a small bit of the grease into the pot for the real "bacon Cheeseburger" flavor.    Everyone has to try this soup, it's amazing!!!

OMG!  The thought of hamburger in any soup but chili wasn't appealing to me.....but I tried this soup and we loved it!  My husband went back for seconds, which means he loved it too.  I made the recipe exactly as written, using sharp cheddar cheese.  This isn't the healthiest soup, but for a cold winter's night, the calories  might be good.

I like this soup but I changed it from adding the veggies it calls for and made it the way it says, without veggies.  then when it was almost done I added chopped lettuce and fresh tomatoes chopped up to it til heated through.  It is so much more like a cheeseburger.

How do you spell YUMMY!  This is a doozy of comfort food.  I thought while making it......what do I like on my cheeseburger?  With that in mind, I added 1 tsp. prepared mustard and 1/4 cup catsup and 1/4 tsp dill.  Also used Velveeta.  When the veggies were cooked, I partially mashed them with a potato masher.  Made for a VERY thick soup.

I don't know why I made this. A wave of nausea came over me when I first saw it, but then I saw all the good reviews. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good AT ALL.. What I learned from this is to always listen to the nausea, not the reviews.

This soup is really very tasty!  Here's what I did ... I would put more meat in it (about 1/2 pound more), it just wasn't meaty enough for my Hubby.  Instead of cubing the potatoes, mince them.  4 cups of potatoes is approximately 3 medium potatoes.  When making the milk mixture, either make certain that your milk is room temperature or dump in the flour/butter and the milk separately.  (When you pour cold milk in with the flour/butter, it makes the butter immediately solidify.)  I think it would be better with whole milk, but it still works with 1%.  I added a jalepeno, cayenne pepper, and bacon bits to taste.  My Hubby would like to have had me make it without carrots.  It is just a very good soup and we'll enjoy it for awhile (I doubled the recipe so I could freeze it).  Thank you!

Not a good idea.  The soup might be better if  made with ham or even chicken, but this recipe was a waste of good ingredients. Will not make it again.

This was a good recipe..  I browned my meat first and drained it good..  I also used some red potatos and some frozen veggies..  I thought the soup was very thick, but that could be because I added Valveta cheese.. maybe too much but I love cheese.. But this was a filling meal and good with some corn bread.. Thank you Arlene!!!

Very good flavor, but if you like more substantial soups this is really lacking in meat and vegetables as written more like creamy broth with a few things floating in it, maybe it needed more cheese and thickener. Next time I will add 1 lb of ground beef, bigger slices of carrots and celery and more of them, and more potatoes!

This soup is good for a cold wintery night.  It kind of tasted like boxed scalloped potatoes that you acn add beef to.  But the soup is better. I did change some things though.  I used 1 pound ground beef. I added garlic to the beef when browning. Salt and pepper to taste.  A few dashed of hot pepper sauce.  I shredded the cheese.  I may have also added Worcestershire sauce, I made it two weeks ago and I forgot whether I did or not.  I will make this again, but next time I think I will also add a bag of mixed veggie.  We are veggie eaters and makes it better for you.

I added 1 lb. of ground beef, garlic, and used beef broth instead of chicken and 9oz- 3 cheese tortellini in place of potatoes. I also used Kraft Cheddar Classic Melt: Cheddar & American for the cheese.The soup was great my family loved it!

This was fantastic!  I left out the celery and used shredded cheddar instead of cubes, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  I made a loaf of french bread for dipping and it was heaven.  I recommend this to anyone who likes good cold-night comfort food!

This soup is excellent!!!  I first found this recipe in a TOH magazine and took the soup to a church dinner.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  My kids all love it too.  The recipe I have calls for American cheese instead of cheddar though.  I shred my carrots and celery with my food processor.  This makes the preparation a little quicker.  Try this recipe!!!

I normally make a hamburger soup and I thought I would try this one since it uses real cheese rather than Velveeta. We liked it a lot. I did season it with salt, black pepper and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I also added more chicken broth since it looked like there wasn't enough liquid in it. I omitted the carrots only because I didn't have any. It was still very good. Will make again.

This was a fantastic recipe and even faster and easier to make than I would of thought.  I did not use butter when cooking the meat and I also halved the amount of butter that is mixed with flour and did not use as much milk.  Added a bit more to the thickness of my liking so it was too runny.  Will be making again!

My Grandchildren love this soup served in a bread bowl! I changed the chicken broth for beef and evaporated milk for the regular milk. This is a great base recipe to use with other ingredients such as ground turkey or chicken. I even made a Mexican version with canned chilies, Jack cheese, and spices.

Hubby thought it was great and went back for seconds. I thought that the boiling the ground beef that long made the pieces too small.  If I make this again I think I will remove some of the larger pieces and add them in at the end.

This is a wonderful soup for fall and winter! This time I made Chef John's No Knead Beer Bread to go with it, and since I was using beer anyway, I substituted beer for some of the chicken broth. WOW!  Delicious either way!  Thanks AUNTYLENE!

My son rated this 10 million stars and said it was the best soup ever... and I make soup A LOT.  I used ground turkey which cut down on the grease with everything getting sauteed all together.  I doubled the recipe and cut back on the cheese a bit - instead of 4 cups, I used 3.  I also added some salt, pepper, and about 1/8 teas. cayenne.

This recipe is awesome!  The only thing that needs to be changed is Velveeta cheese needs to be substituted for the cubed cheese.  I used about 12 ounces of Velveeta and 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese  Yes you can add both, but the Velveeta makes it sooooo creamy and rich.  Excellent!

I made this recipe several times, but the basil and parsley never quite did it for me flavor-wise.  So, this last time I asked myself, "What do I put into my hamburger before I pattie it out and lay it on the grill.....Ahh! Steak seasoning, of course!"   I highly recommend omitting the basil and parsley in favor of 2 tsp. or so of steak seasoning.

I'd tried another cheeseburger soup recipe in the past, and it went over lukewarm with the family.  But this one gets full approval from both kids and the husband.  The only changes I made were to double the ground beef, omit the celery, & use frozen hash brown cubed potatoes.  Turned out GREAT!  Definitely will be making again.

Was definitely a keeper! Did change the chicken broth to beef broth as others suggested. Was easy, delicious, & my picky-eater even enjoyed it.

This soup was fine, but I probably won't make it again. I found it bland and the meat seemed unnecessary.

LOVE this soup.  We have made this many, many times.  I usually have to double it though.  Use twice as much ground beef than what is called for.

I thought this soup was really tasty and filling, the kids loved it too.  Only made a couple changes, used 4 cups beef broth instead(by accident), which works for me because I like my soups, soupy lol. I used a pound of hamburger instead of 1/2 lb and then only added a little sea salt, pepper and 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of ground mustard.  Also used plain yogurt in place of sour cream because I was out.  Turned out great! I will be making this again!

I used beef broth as suggested.  I do think the end result needed some more cheese.  I had added the chedder so I also put in a few slices of velveeta and left out the carrots, they didn't make sense to me in a cheeseburger soup  It was OK, not sure I'll repeat though.

I've made this twice now, the first time I had no potatoes and used noodles instead. This time I made it as recipe calls except I left out the sour cream...and added some processed cheese instead...that was very good and gave it that extra creaminess it needed. This soup is so good on a very cold night...perfect comfort food and the whole family loves it. I like both noodles and potato...either one...it is great.

Great comfort food!  I was a little skeptical, but after all of the great reviews I got from my family...this is for keeps!  I used a pound of ground beef and increased the amount of vegetables slightly.  I also used one 8oz block of sharp cheddar and one 8oz block of medium cheddar which I cubed myself.  I think it is the perfect soup for a cold snowy day.

Awesome base to a great soup.  I definitely used more meat, beef stock and extra velveeta and shredded chedder.  I also used sea salt flavored red potatoes from the grocer's freezer.  Def a keeper.  Whole family enjoyed it.

Cooked potatoes, celery and carrots in the chicken broth.  Cooked onions with hamburger. Used fresh parsley and a little cheyenne pepper. Good and hearty cool weather meal. Followed recipe only changing how it was cooked.

This is one of those recipes where tweaking is expected. After all when we create a recipe the ingredient amounts are approximate. I rate it as a 4, as it presently stands, but made the following changes: doubled ground beef, carrots and onions (maybe basil and parsley too?); used 1 can beef broth, two cans chicken (would have used 3 beef but didn't have another on hand); I have no idea how much white sauce I made (1.5), but I made it a cheese sauce using 2 c. shredded extra sharp cheddar; added two cups shredded xshch at the end and a little bit of cooked bacon (didn't need it). 17-year old took it to school for lunch even though the container required a gift bag with a handle and "lots of tape around the edges." He has a very big football game tonight and I feel honored and so should you, Auntylene. You could contribute to three touchdowns!

Flavorful and filling.  We used closer to a pound of beef, two small cloves of garlic, a little marojam, rosemary and thyme in addition to the basil and parsley, a bay leaf, some cayenne/red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to jazz it up a little.  Instead of making a separate roux, the flour was added to the beef and veggies after the meat was browned, then the milk and only 2C broth stirred in and allowed to thicken before adding the potatos.  Cooked until the potatos were done (which, for us, is longer than 15 minutes), then turned down the heat and melted in the cheese and sour cream.  Yum on a cold night.  I don't know if "cheeseburger" is the right name for this soup, since it doesn't taste like one, but we got a nice, chock-full-of-veggies, beefy, cheesy soup.  Next time, I'd like to add some peeled, diced tomatos.

Very good, more like a ground beef chowder though. Since I had a slice of bacon I needed to use I chopped it up and added it to the beef and veggies. I also had 3 cups of beef broth leftover so I used that as well plus a can of chicken broth. Served with cheddar onion drop biscuits from this site makes a great lunch of dinner.

I have made this soup many times and love it. A twist is to use ham instead of ground beef. I cook the ham bone for the stock and cut up the ham. I also use Velveeta as others have said it makes it creamier. You can also make the stock ahead of time, without the potatoes, and freeze it for future use.

Excellent soup... incredibly flavorful.... with all the veggies i don't know how much of a cheese burger it is... but it does have cheese and burger in it and tasted delicious... I used a full pound of burger and just up all the other ingredients by about 25 percent... very good

We loved this!  I used beef broth instead of chicken, only because it's all I had this day!  I also added a can of mushrooms and some gourmet burger seasoning.  oh - and I had some half and half that needed used so I substituted that for the milk - really low cal!  I added some seeded bun croutons on top!  Yum!

Yum! I'm 23 and I love to cook. I had made this soup a while ago for my friends and family and everybody loved it. A little hard on the waistline and the soup is so rich that a little goes a long way. I always alter recipes a little here and there but results were satisfying. Good job!

I honestly did not care for this.  I think it tasted better before I added the sour cream.  It wasn't full of flavor like I had hoped and I am clueless at how to improve on it.

I have to say I did not like the potatoes in this...for me I felt that it didnt belong. Having said I did use beef broth, 1 lbs. of beef(browned and added later), added a  jalapeno and used american and chedder shredded cheese. I think next time I make this I would add more jalapeno's, red peppers, diced tomatoes and maybe broccoli.

Doesn't really taste like a cheeseburger.  It is good though.  I'm only giving 4 stars because I want to note that my kids didn't really like it and I think it's mis-titled.  (I use the reviews to try to figure out if foods are kid friendly or not.)  If you are looking for a stick to your ribs soup, give this one a try.

I made this soup last night and it was the best! I deleted the carrots, celery, basil, parsley. I added tomato and lettuce (yea lettuce) last after everything was done cooking as I didn't want the lettuce and tomatoe to lose their bite. I also used velveeta like another reviewer, its creamier. Simply delicious on a cold day and when you don't wanna spend time in a restaurant.

A few changes, used skim milk, low fat sour cream, low fat marble cheese and low sodium beef broth.  FREAKIN UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Similar to hamburger helper but WA-AY better!

I did not like this at all - perhaps I went wrong somewhere in the recipe but it tasted more like potato soup with beef and cheese in it. I was expecting more of a cheese flavored base in the soup.

This was very tasty.  Only differences I did, I used celery seeds since I was out of celery.  I mixed the flour in with the meat/veggies before adding liquids.  I had almost tripled the recipe and didn't feel like cutting potatoes so I used a 10 cup package of shredded hashbrowns.  I wasn't sure how that texture would work out, but I thought if they didnt hold up, it would just help add to the creaminess/thickness.  But they held up just fine.  I slow simmered all morning.  Thanks for sharing!

Omitted carrots and celery... decided to use pasta instead of potatoes... turned out pretty good... I disagree with others that said they would use velveeta, Cheddar has a much better taste... Family ate it up!

This soup is absolutely amazing. I double the ground beef to make a much more satisfying main dish. I don't use butter or sour cream, I haven't been brave enough to use the basil, and as long as we're making a nutritional splurge of occasional yumminess, I make my annual use of (gasp) Velveeta as well. I highly recommend the addition of dry MUSTARD to the soup pot, or a squirt of yellow mustard atop a bowl. Serving with pickles is the cherry on the sundae (to mix metaphors) =)

Rich and hearty!  This was great, I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 velveeta.  Followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  Hubby loved it which is a huge plus!  Thank You

Delicious! We didn't have any carrots or celery, so I added shredded zucchini instead.  I used beef bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth. This is a great recipe, and easy to alter to fit what you have on hand.

This did taste like a cheeseburger-reminded me a little of Hamburger Helper.  I didn't have celery or parsely.  Added extra cheese, only added two cups potato (did not have enough potatoes for 4 cups) and skipped the flour in the soup.  Family loved the soup.  I liked the soup, and probably will make again.  A also added about two cups of small pasta bows since I didn't have the 4 cups of potato.

This recipe is good, but I found it a bit bland. It is better with sharp chedder, and a dash of salt to taste. It has a better flavor with sharp cheese.

Love it!  I have made this several times. I reduce some of the fat by using corn starch to thicken rather than butter.  I simmer the veggies in chicken broth.  Use reduced fat cheese - all of those help and it is still delicious!  My family loves it.

my family enjoyed this soup.  I used half cheddar cheese and half velveeta, so it would be creamier.  My husband doesn't like a meal without meat, so with this I get my potato soup and he gets his meat too.

If you aren't used to eating really greasy food - don't try this soup.  I'm not sure what it was about it, but neither my husband or I could eat it. We made a double batch ... sad day.

Thiis is great.  Next time I would add a little less cheese and butter just to make it more heart healthy.  I used fresh herbs as well, this recipe had plenty of taste so it probably wouldn't suffer much from being made a little healthier.

I left the white sauce unattended and it scorched! :( Rookie mistake, I know. Of course, it was the last of the milk and I didn't want to run to the store with a hungry toddler. I had an instant cream gravy package I swore I would never use, but couldn't bring myself to throw away(a friend brought it over). It worked surprisingly well and saved me a trip. I mixed it in, boiled it couple minutes, removed from heat, and stirred in the cheese and sour cream. I have made this recipe as written and it is good. It does have some room for improvement, so feel free to spice it up a little. A easy way to boost the favor is to swap out the dried spices for fresh and triple them. Use a good quality chicken broth and whole milk. Always shred your own cheese, the powder they put on it to keep it from sticking together in the package tastes bad and can ruin your dish. I know it says cubed cheese, but I know some people will try to take short cuts. Also, celery leaves have more flavor than the stalks. You can cut them up too and toss them in.

Don't be afraid of the veggies! I use my chopper for all the vegetables (fast & easy) and even non-veggie lovers enjoy this soup a lot. I always use shredded extra sharp cheddar for ease and extra flavor. It's terrific with the chicken broth but I once accidently bought beef broth and liked that even better! I've been making this soup for years and never found anyone that didn't like it.

Very good, but I admit I added some things: salt and pepper, dash of hot sauce, a garlic cloved minced. Used beef broth instead of chicken. I tried a test bowl in the afternoon before dinner, and quickly had a second! A pinch of dried dill (on top after the soup is dished out) is a tasty addition too.

It's different,I'll say that. I made a few changes,1 cup of chicken broth and 3 cups of beef broth,it just seemed to me to need more liquid. and instead of celery,I used a half of yellow bell pepper,I made it for lunch and was going to freeze the rest because we are having deer steak for supper but I was told 'We'll have that also!' Okay.

EXCELLENT!  Great way to get rid of some veggies that are sitting in your fridge.  You can make it with cauliflower, mushrooms, celery, corn - anything!  Kids liked this one too.

We thought this was very good but I did find it a little on the bland side. I used quite a few different seasonings, threw in some Franks Hot Sauce and used Pepper Jack Cheese for some kick. After adding the milk to the roux I added in the cheese as well to make a sauce before stirring it into the soup. Kids enjoyed this very much and I'll certainly be making this again as I think you could have a lot of fun playing around with this recipe. Thank you so much!!

This is a handy soup recipe for winter time, and the kids like it. I use processed cheese instead of cheddar and make it as cheesy as I want it. Kids love to put ketchup on it.

The soup was ok but I thought it could use a little "pow" so I added some salsa as well as some green chilies. I loved the mexican flavour! I also added a few cheese slices, it gave it that smooth cheezy flavour.

This was very hearty and filling and quite tasty!  Since I'm not one to measure I added a "pack" of ground beef, a "couple" chopped carrots, celery, etc.  I also had leftover chicken and beef broth so I put both in (probably closer to 4 cups).  Oh, I also forgot the sour cream and used a half-block of Velveeta instead of cheddar.  Will definitely keep in the rotation, I only wish it wasn't 85 degrees out today when we ate it.  :-)

Overall, the flavor of this soup is good.  The one thing that some may not realize is that the cheese will not automatically melt to make a homogeneous soup...you definitely need to make a roux with this, or take the risk of having unappetizing cheese sludge on the bottom of your pan.

The only change I made to this recipe was to omit the celery and sour cream and that was only because I was out of both.  This is still on the stove with the cheese melting and I have to say it is wonderful.  I will make again with the sour cream.  How it can improve such a good soup, I can only imagine.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is delicious.  I definitely recommend using SHARP cheddar cheese because it is easy for the chicken stock and potatoes to dominate the soup.  I also added some Jalapenos for an added kick!!

First off, don't eat this soup if you have to do anything for a while after the meal, you'll be too weighed down! I'd rate this as average. It's thick potato soup with cheese and hamburger. I was surprised though at how good the addition of dried basil was. We garnished with a squirt of ketchup and dill pickle (my husband added a LOT of ketchup).

I have the best luck with soups from this website.  This was delicious, easy and filling.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I may try elbow noodles in place of the potatoes to make my life a little easier (less chopping), a great weeknight throw-together dinner.  This soup is rich enough to stand alone, and economical to boot.

This soup was horrible.  I thought maybe I did something wrong with the recipe since so many people rated it so high. (I didn't) No one in my family liked it. This is the first time I made a five star recipe from allrecipe that was a bust.

Holy cow.  Another winner from the allrecipes.com website!  I didn't have quite enough cheddar cheese on hand, so I used up some leftover cream cheese.  Also, I used low-fat sour cream, which I also had available at home.  I used over a pound of hamburger and may use even more next time.  Even with chili, I rarely feel like I have enough hamburger.  It isn't made completely clear if a separate pan is used to warm the butter, milk and flour mixture, but I did.  I suppose it would work the other way, but using a separate pan helped me avoid any lumps.  The rest of my family hasn't had any yet, but they better hurry before I finish it up!!!

This was very good but not quite what we were expecting.  We thought it would be more of a cheese soup with meat in it.  It's more like a cream soup with a little bit of cheese.  I added about 3/4 lb. of burger and am glad I did because it still didn't seem like quite enough.  I will use closer to 1 lb. next time.  I cooked the beef first so there was no extra fat.  This is a 4 star soup the second day!

This soup is the BEST!!! My family absolutely loved it. And best of all, it was super easy to make. I used left over baby red potatoes from the night before and added green peppers too. Next time I'll use a pound of ground beef and maybe some bacon. Thanks for this recipe. I'll be using this alot in the future on cold Wisconsin nights!

This was delicious!  I followed the suggestions of using Velveeta and doubling the beef.  I added a little extra broth to cook the potatoes and a little extra cheese.  May try with cheddar next time, it was almost too rich.

I served this on Christmas Day 2002.  My sister brought a split pea soup.  The Cheeseburger soup crock went empty.  Everyone loved it, even finiky Peary.  I agree with the Valveeta over the cheddar, the beef broth over chicken plus I used a Tbsp of Garlic Tobasco.

My family loved this recipe.  I increased the meat to 1 pound and added a little hot sauce for added zing but other than that I left it exactly the way written and it was terrific.  This will be wintertime staple at our house from now on.

This was the best soup I have ever had.  However, I used velveta cheese instead of cheddar and it had a wonderful taste in the soup. Though, next time I will leave out the carrots and celery because this seemed more like a potato soup and they really didn't go well.  But, otherwise it is a wonderful soup for cold nights.

My husband loved this soup. Kids noticed the carrots but ate it anyway! We added a dash or so of pepper sauce to adult servings for zip. Terrific!!!

Great and Easy soup.  I used a little more meat than recipe calls for, as was suggested in earlier reviews.  A very filling dinner, perfect for a snowy evening.  Great with the Cheddar Bay Biscuits, also on this site.

Really lacking on flavor. It's not awful but both my husband and I aren't huge soup fans so if it doesn't punch us in the face with flavor then it's pretty "meh" to us. Maybe some garlic powder, onion powder, all of those soup related seasonings could help, salt and pepper aren't mentioned in the recipe but is a must. I also needed an extra cup of broth to be able to cook all of the potatoes, which I didn't have enough potatoes on hand for 4 cups but the 2 cups I did have I think is plenty. Heavy cream or half and half is seriously a must for any dairy based soup and I think is what this is primarily missing and could really benefit from, but of course it is fat and calorie heavy, very unhealthy, but delicious! As is, with salt and pepper, it's not terrible, I would be content with eating it every day, I'm just not crazy for it. I'll toy around with the recipe but it's pretty good!

Great soup!  Needs more hamburger.  Also, drain the fat off before you add the chicken stock.  And, if you are using it for a main dish, this makes, really, 4 servings.

The recipe as written is alright but it's missing a bit of flavor. I added some salt, paprika, garlic, soy sauce(just a splash), red pepper flakes, and some steak seasoning to add some dimensions to the flavors.

I didn't have any sour cream, potatoes or celery, so I added some fries at the end as a topping and left the celery and sour cream out.

I think if I tried this again, I would add some bacon bits and chives as a topping.

I increased this to about 70 servings for my job. Made a few adjustments but was really enjoyed by everyone! My tip is to be sure to drain your browned hamburger real well, otherwise you'll have a layer of grease on top. Ground turkey works wonderful as well

This is a very good, hearty soup.  I even won a competition at work with this soup with the following tweaks I made.  The recipe leaves out salt and pepper to taste, which I found necessary.  I use beef broth instead of chicken for deeper flavor.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. mustard powder.  For the cheese, I used about half cheddar as suggested, but used Velveeta for the remainder for a smoother melt.  

When taking this soup to a lunch potluck at work, I made it the night before, leaving the potatoes undercooked.  I then put it in my crockpot set on low, stirring occasionally.  It was perfect by lunchtime and I have a little trophy to prove it.  LOL!

As written, it's just okay. As I'm making it I'm thinking where are the spices? Not even salt or pepper?  Turns out pretty bland. Next time  some salt, pepper, onion powder and a touch of cayenne kicks it up.  I love lots of cayenne but just a pinch to stay close to that true cheeseburger flavor.

I made a cheese sauce in the microwave then blended into the soup.  I combined the 3 tbsp butter with 1/4 cup flour cayenne pepper in a medium size bowl microwaved on high for 2 mins.  Whisk.  Slowly add milk, whisk.  Microwave 2 mins.  Whisk, microwave 2 mins.  Slowly add cheese, whisk.  Slowly add to soup.  Add 1/4 sour cream stir serve.

I have made this soup twice now.  My daughter and I love it the first time and I would give it 5 stars. However, I wanted to try it in my crock pot so it could cook during the night and I could take some for lunch the next day. I tried some of the adjustments others suggested like using my blender to mash up the veggies a little and thought it completely backfired. I just didn't like the way it tasted smashed up and creamy. I like the brothy look and feel better.

I am not a huge fan of potatoes in soup so I just added a little more ground beef and a little extra of the veggies that were called for and 3 slices of bacon( cut up and browned with the veggies). I also had 4oz. of cream cheese that needed to be used up so I threw that in too..( Isn't soup the greatest to use up those little leftover portions). For a little added interest I diced up 1/2 of a dill pickle and stirred it in at the very end .  It was marvelous!

LOVE this soup! I've made it several times for potluck dinners at church and it's usually gone by the time I get through the line...started setting aside a serving for myself before putting it out! I add a bit more cheese, other than that I follow the recipe exactly, great recipe, thank you!

I made this soup for our weekly super Wednesday for the church.  I had to increase the recipe to feed 80 people and I have to say, this soup was a big hit!   I followed the recipe exactly, I think the only thing I would do differently is season it a bit more.  Some of the people garnished it with dill pickle relish, chopped onion and cheddar cheese...they said that made it taste more like a cheeseburger.   I will definitely make again.

Made exactly as written. DH said we can add this to the list of soups he likes, he usually doesn't like soup for dinner. Edit: I also make this with a pound of sausage and gluten free flour and it is very good.

I adjusted it to make 9 servings.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of grassfed beef/ground venison mixed.  I added 3 t salt, 1/2 t pepper, 3 cloves of garlic and even 8 oz diced mushrooms.  I used butternut squash instead of potatoes.  I used half pepperjack & half colby cheese but not quite the full 3 cups for the 9 servings.  I can't keep myself from sampling it as I wait for the cheese to melt!

It was delicious and pretty easy - I would add more hamburger next time (maybe a pound?) and it needed salt for sure.  Otherwise, loved it!!  Thanks for a great recipe to eat after shoveling tons and tons of snow!
Edited to add:  I've made this two times since the first time.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and about 2X the cheese and it's amazing.  Really great recipe that my kids love - thanks!!

This turned out pretty well. I doubled the beef as others suggested to make it heartier. The recipe neglects to mention any seasoning, and it definitely needs salt and pepper throughout. I added s+p to the mirepoix, the beef, and after adding the liquids. I also used another's suggestion to use frozen diced potatoes (hash browns) because that's what I had on hand. It worked out well except the potatoes were a bit firmer than I would have liked, so if you go that route, simmer it a little longer and be sure to taste test the potatoes.

Being an Allrecipes Brand Ambassador I was asked to pick a recipe and use Johnsonville's Italian Sausage. That being said I subbed the ground beef for Johnsonville's Sweet Italian Sausage links. I cut the casings off and and fried like ground beef. I also chose to precook the potatoes and carrots separately, personal preference (I was afraid they would get overcooked otherwise). In a separate pan I cooked the onions and celery in the butter, added the flour and made a roux.  I then added my homemade chicken stock, half and half and seasoning and cooked until thickened. Slowly I added shredded cheese, a little at time, until melted. I then added the cooked sausage, potatoes and carrots and cooked until heated through. I found that the amount of flour called for in the recipe was a little skimpy and made the soup a tad too thin for me so I added another tablespoon, sprinkling in a little at a time and whisking briskly until I got the desired thickness. Can't vouch for how it tastes with burger since I made it with sausage but it was good as I made it. I think adding a spicier sausage could possibly make it tastier.

I stumbled across this soup and decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe somewhat strictly since this is my first time making it and I invited my grandparents over for supper. I only added extra spices and some salts and threw in some fried bacon crumbles at the end. Regardless to say, the soup was amazingly delicious and filling. Next time I will try velveeta instead of cheddar. Definitely will be making this soup again!

This is a great recipe! I doubled it to use up some stuff in the kitchen. I traded out the milk and cheese mixture for just some velveeta like another reviewer suggested. Then i thickened it with cornstarch and it was great!

Great tasting fall/winter soup, but I'd call it Cheeseburger-potato soup! I also used sharp cheddar and fresh parsley, chopped, along with half 'n half for more richness.

Excellent as written. A family favorite. We have also tweaked it to lower the carb count a bit by adding a steamed then puréed cauliflower head in place of the flour and potatoes. Tastes just as good! Kids don't know the difference.

This is very good!  I thought it was going to be more like cheese dip but it certainly was not.  I really want to try it with some elbow macaroni in place of the potato.  I think that would be very good as well.  Here are the changes I made.  I doubled the ground beef, cut the carrots and celery down to 1/2 cup, added a little garlic, used Velveeta instead of cheddar, and salt and peppered to taste.  At the end, I added a 4oz can of green chili's and a little cayenne.  I gave this a 4 instead of 5 because when i tasted it, it was a little bland...so hence the green chili's and cayenne.  It turned out fabulous!  Oh yes I also cut the butter down by a tablespoon as I did not use one to cook/brown the vegetables and beef.  I melted the remaining 3 tablespoons in a small sauce pan, made a roux with the flour added the milk slowly until mixed in and then slowly added the mixture to the soup to thicken it up.  I never let it boil in the small saucepan just heated it enough to ensure no lumps.

Delish! Great soup for winter! I followed it exactly. Only thing I did different was used shredded cheese. Tasted better the next day.

This is THE recipe for this hearty soup.  My very minor modifications: 1 tsp Worchestershire sauce, 3 cups of beef broth instead of chicken, 1 tsp garlic salt, and fresh ground pepper.  I left out the celery because I didn't have any.  

A technical note - I made my white sauce (butter, flour and milk) in a separate sauce pan and added it to the soup, so there wouldn't be an un-cooked flour taste or lumps in the soup.

This soup is good but does not remind me of a cheeseburger in any way. The potatoes are front and center and the beef and cheese are a second thought.  It is good though.  I followed it to a T and it was just right in consistency and was satisfying for a cool night.  But Cheeseburger soup it is not!

So dang delicious! I also used 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 shredded cheese because it's what I had on hand. Otherwise, super good, rich and creamy. The husband absolutely went wild for it. Thanks!

We didn't really like this much. Not sure whether it was the texture or the taste, or both; perhaps it would work better with a less finely ground beef. Doubt I will make this again.

out of 13 items in the Ingredients list, only 3 of them are on a burger. this is more like cheese, beef and potato soup. some people said they want it more cheesy tasting. all you need to do is add very sharp cheddar. Chicken Broth in a beef soup? why not beef broth in a beef soup? some sliced Green onion would work with this soup.

AMAZING.  I adjusted the recipe to 11 servings so I could use a 4 cup box of chicken stock and one pound of ground beef.  I added two minced pickled jalapeños and used a handful of fresh chopped parsley, 1 Tbsp. Minced fresh thyme and 1 tsp. dry basil.  To save some of the fat content, I just added the flour to the sautéed beef and vegetables to make my roux, no butter and a big splash of red wine to deglaze the pan and the milk after a few minutes.

I have already reviewed this soup as written but I have found that by adding some more veggies and meat and using a slow cooker I can make an exceptionally cheap, easy, nutritious meal that requires little of my time and is a good way to sneak veggies into my grandkids  although it probably can no longer be called "cheeseburger soup" by the time ive made my modifications, I hope some others will find my additions useful to them. I start by sautéing one bag of frozen bell pepper/onion mix in a little oil until soft. I then add 1lb of lean ground beef and brown that. I pop it into a slow cooker with some diced potatoes and carrots, a can of chopped green chillies, a can of diced tomatoes and 2 cups of beef broth and cook on low for 6-8 hours. I add shredded 2% reduced fat sharp cheddar and cook on high for about 15 minutes to melt. I notice that many are using velveeta but for myself anything that is called "cheese food" is so altered it is just a chemical laden glop in the mix. That's just my opinion. For thickening I like to mash a few of the potatoes in the soup. After putting each serving in the bowl I top with a little more shredded cheese and a dollop of light sour cream. As a distance runner, this provides me with excellent nutrition that is easy on my wallet and my time.

I used mixed veggies instead of just carrots, didn't have celery so added some celery salt.  Also added some dry mustard and pickle juice for those extra flavors that I like in my cheeseburger. :)  This was great!  Perfect on a chilly fall evening.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I know, everyone hates when people alter the recipe and then write a review. But I did, so eat it! But alterations are small, in my opinion. I added cooked bacon at the end, because I add that sh!t to everything. And I used half milk, half heavy whipping cream (instead of 1 1/2 cups milk) because I needed to use it up. I followed everything else to a T and it turned out amazing :)

This was delicious on a cold fall evening.  I altered the recipe a bit.  I used one pound of ground beef, didn't add the 2T of butter for the browning (I didn't think it needed it) and I drained the fat off the beef once it was done cooking.  Also, I used shredded cheddar instead of cubed so it would blend quicker.  I didn't add the sour cream at the end - it doesn't need it.  I will definitely make it again!

Nice recipe.  The recipe doesn't suggest draining the fat off of the beef before adding the broth and next time I would do that.  Also, I shredded some of the cheese and spooned it on top of the soup before serving - nice presentation and the gooeyness on top made it seem even more like a cheeseburger!

This was a very good soup for a cold and wet Minnesota day. I did double the ground beef and increased the carrots and celery just a bit. I also added some salt to the ground beef before browning it. I sliced the potatoes in my food processor rather than cube them. I also shredded the sharp cheddar cheese as well. 

One thing I did do was add the cheese and sour cream to the milk mixture once it was smooth and I took it off the heat. The cheese melted beautifully almost immediately and then I mixed in the sour cream. The sauce turned out smooth and creamy. I then added the mixture to the simmering soup.

I made this exactly as directed, and it was really good.  Then, because no hamburger is complete without dill pickles, I added a tsp. of dried dill weed and 2 tsp. of wine vinegar.  Then, it was outstanding!

Had this tonight for dinner and it was really great.  Next time I am putting it in a bread bowl and not putting in the celery (just did not seem to fit)  Side note to the directions that step three needs to be done in a separate skillet; you are making a rue and then adding the thickened mixture to the soup which thickens the soup.Without reading ahead this could really mess up your soup. Overall GREAT fall soup.

This is the best soup EVER!! I was looking for something to do with hamburger and found this. We could not stop eating it! My husband liked it so much he didn't leave any for leftovers! I will be making this again very soon. I used shredded cheese instead. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used water and the chicken flavored seasoning cubes.

One of my favorite soups!!! Celery & carrots are not on burgers but they really make this soup so much better (especially the celery).  I use 1# of chopped chuck and I also cook & mash about 8-12 oz. of cauliflower which helps thicken the soup & add more veggies & the kids don't know any better - I do the same when I make cheesy potato soup. We also add bacon on top & sometimes a dollop of sour cream. Oh and I prefer using beef broth but have used chicken in the past.

The soup could use more beef and less potatoes and celery. It should be more clear that the fourth step is done separately from the soup mixture.

I always like to read the reviews prior to making the recipe.  I used the base recipe, but did add some Cajun Spice and extra ground beef and omitted the sour cream, it turned out great and I will make again.

An awesome recipe and a keeper that's for sure.  I think the key is good quality cheese (I used Henning's Cheddar and grated it).  I also added one chicken boullion cube as well as two cloves minced garlic in with the meat/veggie mixture.  This was gobbled up quickly.

This was very easy to make and VERY tasty. I did make a few changes based on the reviews of others and to try make it a bit "lighter." First I sauteed the vegetables including a bit of minced garlic and omitting the onions in a bit of olive oil. Then I added the meat increasing to 1 lb and using ground turkey (no butter needed). I used Ore Ida frozen potatoes O'Brien which has both onions and peppers in it already with a low sodium broth. I added the flour to 3T of I Can't Believe it's not butter and added skim milk. For the cheeses, like many other reviewers, I used half Velveeta and half Kraft 2% Colby, Cheddar and Monterey Jack cubes. I adjusted the seasons at the end adding a little salt and pepper to taste during the final simmer. It came out hearty and satisfying on a cold winter night!

It was good. My hubby and mom-in-law thought it was so good they went for seconds. Due to a constant lack of time, I did use the helpful ideas for your reviewer (Cindy Carnes). I had to double the recipe because I had slightly over a pound of ground meat which had to be used.

Auntylene, I thank you. I had never heard of this type of soup before. Simple, quick and good :)

I made this with frozen hashbrowns instead of cubed potatoes and the sharp cheddar but it still came out amazing. My family loved it and my husband took the rest for left overs the next. He did say the left overs weren't nearly as good as when I first made it though but we will def be making this again!

OMG, this is Restaurant Quality. The Sour Cream really tops it off. We used 1 1/4 Velveeta Cheese and Beef Broth. It was so delicious. We will be adding this to our monthly menu plan.

I followed this recipe to a tee. And everyone (including my 13 month old) LOVED it. It was the right consistency for soup. Not too watery and not too thick. The only thing is we had to salt it a bit. Will definitely be making this again!

This was really good - but doesn't look very appetizing. I increased the ground beef to 1 lb and kept everything else the same. We thought it was a good ratio and everyone enjoyed the dish - even the kids!

We all loved this hearty winter soup. I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted beef  for the chicken broth and omitted the sour cream. Just sprinkled a little shredded cheese on top as a garnish. I will def make it again!!

I doubled the meat , veggies, & seasonings but only used 4 cups of broth and left the roux, cheese and sour cream as is.  Instead of soup it was like a stew and everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I served it with biscuits and a salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, though I did tweak a bit.  I used more beef than the recipe called for, did not use celery, and did not use the milk (I didn't think it needed it).  I don't really think it needed the potato either.  Also, I used half cheddar and half velveeta.  With this changes I thought it was pretty good for a cold-night dish :)

This was awesome!  I doubled the meat, veggies, & spices, and used 3 cans chicken broth + 2 large russet potatoes.  I made the white sauce with only 2 Tbl. butter in a separate pan, then added it to the soup mixure (saved time!).  I also added 2 tsp. salt to the final mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was way beyond amazing!!!  I made this for my husband's deer hunting party.  Prepared exactly how it was written with one exception.  I added a jalapeno pepper to give it a little kick but not to much where it was gonna hurt!  It was a huge hit!!!! Will be making this often!!!

This is a fabulous soup!  It's super easy to change it up to fit your family's tastes.  I like to add half velveeta and half sharp cheddar and I double the meat (we use ground turkey).  I also add beef broth instead of chicken.  I only add about half of the potatoes called for.  I make this about once a month and always making a double batch to throw in my freezer.  Its freezes and reheats beautifully.

I went with other reviewers and added bacon bits and jalepeno.  I used velveeta and diced frozed hash browns (saved a lot of time).  I used boullion chicken cubes instead of stock.  I skipped the basil because I didn't have any.  I used the sour cream but didn't find it necessary (I tasted it with and without).  VERY YUMMY!!

Really good soup, faster with pre-packaged O' Brien potatoes.  I cut back on the butter, used skim milk and light sour cream and it still tasted rich and creamy. Added coarse ground black pepper to taste. Great way to hide veggies for kids.

This is one of our new cold day favorites! I used ground turkey and shredded sharp cheddar because that's what I had.  I also added a cup of frozen peas when I added the milk sauce.  For those that think Velveeta is necessary to make this creamy - just take the pot off the heat and stir in the cheese in a figure 8 motion; it will come out super creamy and delicious and no need for processed cheese food!  Just a couple of tweaks and this was perfect - thanks for sharing!

This soup was okay but tasted nothing like cheeseburger. I follow the directions as it was stated but I think the potatoes were what made me not like it. The taste of potatoes overwelmed everything else. I won't make again.

My whole family loves this recipe.  I use it as a crock pot recipe.  I brown the ground beef with the onions and then mix everything in the crockpot.  Right before serving the soup, I make the milk mixture and just stir it into the contents of the crockpot.  I also just use the cheese and sour cream on top of each individual serving.

I didn't add the carrots or the basil (none handy), but this was awesome, and will eat this no matter the season! Lol.

I also used shredded cheese as opposed to cubed cheddar, but other than that no further modifications were used.  YUMMY!!

This was wonderful.  The reason I gave it only four stars though was because it was a little watered down but from previous comments, I added some instant potatoes and it thickened up.  I think it did take some flavor away, but I just added MORE CHEESE!  I had waaay more cheese than directed but it was delicious.

I thought this was very good. I love soups that are just easy and perfect on a winter night. Will make again.

This was an instant hit at our house!  My husband was a little leary about cheeseburger soup when he asked what was for dinner, but raved once he took his first bite.  I like it because its easy and quick to make and usually I have all of the ingredients on hand.  This is a definate keeper.  Thanks!

Loved this!! I did add a few things though.  Definitely needed more meat for my family of 5 so I used about 1.5 lbs of lean ground beef.  While browning the beef, that's when I added the spices along with minced onions and garlic powder and dash of Tony's.  We took the advice in the reviews and used the frozen cubed hashbrown potatoes, used half of the bag in the soup and fried up the other half on the stove to use as topping option.  Also had some crumbled bacon for topping.  I used Cheddar cheese in a block, just cubed it myself.  I omitted the celery and just used the carrots.  If you don't want the extra nutrients, don't worry about it.  I did it to sneak the kids some veggies.  I grated about 2 1/2 large organic carrots VERY finely, it totally blended in with the meat.  The sour cream gives it a good tang, I was asked if there was Worc. sauce in it, so glad I didn't add any, the sour cream does the trick. Will be saving this recipe and doing it again for sure. My kids (12 and 9) loved it.  My 4 yr old won't touch meat, so no verdict there.

We used Velveeta which is a favorite of some here. Too much Velveeta for me though. We'll try classic cheddar or colby/jack next time - I imagine this will give it a better taste.

This soup was really tasty!  I actually changed quite a few things, though.  I didn't think carrots, celery, or potatoes would go well because I don't put those things on a cheeseburger.  So I left out the carrots and celery and substituted macaroni noodles for the potatoes.  I also added in some minced garlic and also some ground mustard.  Since I left out the carrots and celery, I used cornstarch to thicken instead of flour.  I just added a tablespoon or so in with some of the milk, then poured that into the soup.  It was really tasty!  I served it with a simple green salad and a mustard viniagrette to tie in with the flavors of the soup.  Delish!

Made this soup tonight and the family loved it. The only changes I made were to add salt and pepper, didn't have cheddar, so used american cheese and a little more broth because I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef. My husband said it was kind of "stroganoffy" but he loved it. Served with fresh made whole wheat bread, perfect for a snowy winter night.

Very good recipe! I read other suggestions for ideas. Used beef broth instead of chicken.  Topped with chopped lettuce, tomatoe and pickle.  Tasted just like Cheeseburger. Will make again.

This was really good!  I didnt add the celery and only put in half the carrots.  I added an entire package of bacon (cooked and crumbled) and probably 1 more cup of cheddar cheese.  I also just used grated cheddar instead of cubing up a block of cheese.  So much easier! My daughter thought garnishing it with a little mustard sounded good and after she mixed it in to her own bowl of soup and thought it was good, I ended up doing it as well. I didnt do it, but read where others used frozen hash brown potatoes instead of cubing their own, and I will definitely do that the next time!

Made a few changes.  Omitted the carrots.  I put it all in a crockpot except the sour cream and cheese which I added at the end.  As a final touch, my son recommended added pickles at the end.  My family loves it!

Awesome soup!  I used a whole bag of cubed potatoes, new in frozen food section and microwaved as bag stated and shredded cheese instead of cubed to save time.  I also topped with some dill relish.

One of my family's favorite soup recipes.  Very easy using most ingredients kept on hand.  I took the advice of many to mix in flour/butter mixture before broth.  Turns out perfect every time.  Another change I made was adding the potatoes with the rest of the veggies, this decreases the cook time by a few minutes.  Just a thought.  Thanks you for sharing this!!

I really enjoyed this but as written I can only give it 4 stars.  A few minor changes and it will be 5 stars.  First, it was a little bland -- beef and veggies need a little salt while browning.  Next, I would decrease or eliminate the potatoes...in my opinion, they make a heavy soup even more heavy and for flavor, they are not needed.  I would increase the amount of beef to 1 lb to compensate.  Finally, I would increase the cheese to at least 3 cups.

This was delicious and I will definately make again soon! I used ground turkey instead of beef. My husband and I could not stop eating it. Because of that we had enough for dinner and then one more round of warm ups the next day.

Absolutely delicious!  I used frozen hashbrowns (diced-style) and defrosted them in the microwave.   Pre-shredded carrots also saved time and effort.  I will be making this again soon for a family get-together and I know it will be a big hit.

Really more like 4.5 stars. This is a good solid recipe - easy, unfussy and you probably have all the ingredients in your kitchen already! Some changes I made were using pre-cut carrot slices, omitting the celery, punching up the seasoning and using beef broth instead of chicken (since I had beef broth on hand.) I also used frozen cubed potatoes which worked well. I didn't stir in the sour cream but dolloped it on top with some sliced green onions. Even my veggie-averse 'tween had two bowls of this one. I'll absolutely make this one again!

It was o.k.  Suprisingly, my kids did not enjoy it.  I just didn't think there was enough flavour...I even added extra spices to it, but found there was something missing.

My family loved this soup but  I did add a few more vegetables.  I put one can of kidney beans, some fresh mushrooms and one yellow pepper as well as the carrots and chopped all up very fine in the food processor (had to disguise veggies for one picky eater in the family).  The only other thing I would do differently is try to keep the hamburger more chunky instead of the way it turned out (very fine).  I also added about 3 crushed cloves of garlic.  Very tasty and filling.

This soup is OUTSTANDING! I used a full pound of ground beef and american cheese as that was what I had. My only recommendation would be to increase the broth by at least a cup as the soup is very thick. I will make this often.

I loved this recipe!! To make this a healthier recipe I used ground turkey, added some broccoli and tomatoes, and cut out the potatoes entirely. I also added some pepper. Based on some of the other reviews, I also used 8 slices of velvetta cheese. It still tasted great!

Excellent!  I did cook the beef separate so I could drain the fat but that was the only modification.  I also found it needed a little salt and pepper but it was fantastic!

Yummy! I followed the recipe with no modifications and it was extremely full of flavor and very hearty. I will make this again, but will only use extra lean ground beef, or pre-cook the beef half way and drain off the fat, to save on some calories.

Thank you for this recipe! We loved it. I made it as written except for these changes: I used more ground beef (because that's what I had thawed), I used Velveeta and some shredded cheddar, I omitted the basil, I used Milnot and whole milk (because I was out of sour cream), and I added a handful of crumbled bacon (because I had it on hand). It was a really hearty soup that was very quick and full of flavor. I will be making this a LOT this winter! =0)

Wonderful!  I got this from Taste Of Home several years ago - only difference being that it called for Velveeta, so I've always used that.  It's fall now, and I've been getting many requests.  Great football food too!

Luckly, I had everything I needed to make this meal.  It is delish, and ready to be served this evening for dinner.  I used ground turkey instead of the beef and will like to use velveta cheese next time, but still DELISH!!!  Thank you! 
9/30/10, I had to edit this. My kids asked to have the leftovers for lunch at school!  What a hit this is!

This is a solid, easy soup.  I used about a pound of lean beef, skipped the celery and carrots, added about half a pound of sauted mushrooms. Used Velveeta, as another reviewer suggested. Probably not the healthiest soup, but very tastey!!

Delicious!  I forgot about the sour cream before serving, but it was great without it.  I also used half cheddar, half Velveeta to use up the Velveeta in the fridge.  My husband also really liked this, and I will definitely make it again.

Very good recipe. I followed the instructions as written and the soup turned out rich and creamy. I did have to salt and pepper to taste to enhance the flavor a little bit. Overall, very good soup. Husband and son gobbled it up. Will make again!  Next time I will try using sharp cheddar cheese and see if that makes a difference.

It was very good.  I used half a bag of frozen veggies that I chopped in my mini chopper!  It was very thick, and cheesy and I didn't even add the sour cream!  I let the broth simmer for quite a while becuz supper was delayed becuz DH was getting home from work late SO there was very little broth left in the beef and pot, just barely covering.  I made the butter, flour and milk roux and then melted the cheese in that pan and then poured it into the soup and just mixed and we were ready to go!!  YUMMY!

Great cold weather meal, and left overs heat up well too.  I did use beef broth instead of chicken, and also seasoned the ground beef for more flavor.

Very tasty, hearty soup for the whole family! I used 2% Velveeta in lieu of the cheddar cheese. I also left the skins on my diced potatoes, used a whole pound of ground beef, and 32 oz of chicken broth. I wouldn't use any less beef! It was perfect!

Very tasty. I used pre-packaged hash brown potatoes for convenience. I realized that this recipe is quite similar to my fave potato soup recipe from this site, only that one uses ham. I give this 4 stars solely because I prefer the ham to the hamburger meat.

This is a great, family (and budget!) friendly soup! My family, who can be very picky, really liked it. This soup was warm and comforting, as well as rich and filling. I made it exactly as written, except that I added about 2 cups more broth, because it seemed extremely thick to me. I also used shredded cheese, which was all I had. It worked perfectly; melted very quickly and was not grainy at all. Thanks so much for sharing...this is an easy, quick recipe that I will turn to often when we want soup on a cold night!

OMG, too good to be true.  My hubby who hates soup loves this one soo much he volunteered to make it tonight for dinner.  A staple in our house. I super finely shred the carrots and celery because my hubby doesn't like those but he loves this soup.  Going to try it with meunster tonight.   MMMMMM.

I love this soup!  To make it vegetarian, add a package of vegetarian beef crumbles (Boca brand or MorningStar Farms).  Awesome!

This is a great recipe!! I really liked it because I didn't have to add my regular seasoning to it.  It was simple, and the kicker. . .  don't forget to add the sour cream at the end because it goes in a whole nother direction.  Awesome!! Thanks for sharing!!

Fantastic soup! My husband ate it for 3 days and he hates leftovers. I used Velveeta this time but think I will mix in a little cheddar next time to cut the richness of it.

This was really, really good.  I'm not a soup fan but the entire family is so I was looking for something comforting and quick and not too "soupy".  I used precut hashbrowns (next time I'll cut them in advance) to save time and grated my carrots, celery and cheese in the food processor.  I wasn't paying attention and put 1# of ground beef in the pot so I did have to add an extra cup of chicken stock but that also gave me an excuse to add an extra cup of shredded sharp cheddar!  ;)  It was a bit bland so I threw in an entire jar of Tastefully Simple's Corn Black Bean Salsa and WOW!  It's more of a mexican cheeseburger soup with this addition and absolutely a recipe that is going in my countertop recipe box!

If I could give your recipe 100 stars I would....this is the best soup recipe! The only thing that I did different is add a sprinkle of garlic powder to the meat while it cooked. Everyone loves this soup! A million thanks for such a tasty yummy soup!!!

Wonderful soup!  The only change I made was I used Velveeta instead of cheddar, and did not peel the potatoes.  This was a huge hit and will me a winter regular!

So good!  I didn't brown the meat in butter and only used 2 T in the recipe.  I doubled the hamburger.  Used extra lean beef and reduced fat sour cream (1/2 c).  Thank you for this recipe!  Maybe tomorrow I will eat only one bowl instead of indulging in two like I did tonight...or maybe not :)

Kid friendly recipe. My toddler declared, "I love soup!" But the adults sprinkled on the hot sauce. It was bland but very rich and cheesy. My only regret was I used tator tots and they made the broth too thick. I'd like to make this again.

I have actually had this recipe for a long time. It's been a long family favorite! I always quadruple this so that I will have enough left to freeze. Great for a cold day. Also I chop veggies very fine in my food processor so the kids will eat it better. One recipe would not make enough for this family of five.

If there was a 3.5 option I would give it that - don't get me wrong, it is fast, easy, and pretty good.  For some reason I think it is only something we would do when looking for something cheap and fast to do on a weeknight.  Nothing super spectacular but will do the trick if in a pinch!

We really liked this soup.  The only thing that we changed is that we added some worcestershire sauce and black pepper.  I am not sure how much we added.  It was added after the soup was dished out.  Some of us decided to add a few splashes to our bowl to add a bit of flavor.  Otherwise, it was a hit!

I love this recipe, but I gave it 4 stars for all the fat and calories.  I make it as directed with a few minor cuts to the diet.  I use lean turkey chop meat, no butter when cooking the meat and veggies, 1% milk and low fat sour cream.  Doesn't change the taste and cuts out a few calories and grams of fat! This soup is a keeper though!

This is an awesome hearty soup recipe.  I like to use sharp cheddar cheese so you can taste the cheese in the soup.  I also use ground turkey insead of ground beef so I don't have to drain any grease off.  I have made this soup several times, and there is never any leftover!

My fiance and I love this recipe. It's not overly time consuming and it always turns out great. I do not put in the basil or the parsley as I don't like the way basil tasted in the soup. I don't put parsley in anything, as I don't think it adds anything to a recipe.

"Very Good Hun, Very Good!" Those were my husbands exact words. This was really tasty soup. It was like a potato soup with meat. I used a whole lb. of ground beef. I did add 4 oz of velveeta as well since I thought it would add some creaminess and it melts better. My husband liked this really well, he even commented and asked if there was enough to save a bowl for his lunch tomorrow. I did use dried minced onion 1 Tbl and a tsp onion powder and dried celery 1 Tbl as well. I also used some crinkle cut carrots from the freezer, a handful of those. Great soup, husband asked for this again! Thanks!!!

Feeding as many people as I do (7 children), it's hard to find something that everyone likes.  This was a hit, even when I served it for lunch the next day.  Everyone loved it.  Be sure to use a good quality cheese; that makes a big difference.

I have a soup and sandwich shop and I had one of my customers come in and request this soup recipe that I had made the week before.  The only addition I make is I add garlic.

This soup recipe is delicious.  I have been making it for several years.  It is similar to a favorite recipe in the TOH collection.  I omit the celery to suit my families taste and add a few extra potatoes....I found the longer you let it simmer, the thicker it is.  It is even better as leftovers!

I should probably just write another recipe and I might.. just thought I would let you know that this soup idea is great!  I browned my meat and onion together.. then diced my potatoes and threw them in the crockpot.  I then poured 2 cans of chicken soup in the pot and added 4tbs of butter and let it cook for 3 hours on high.  After that it was time for dinner, so I threw in small can of diced tomatoes, half and half (8oz) sour cream and mixed.. then took some of the hot mixture out .. mixed in a little flour.. and then put it back in.. mixed it up.. left it for 30 minutes on high.. and then done!  ok.. i think i just made a whole new recipe.. but hey.. this one gave me the idea!  its super tasty!

Exceptionally yummy. I hate when people change the recipe and then rate it... I followed the recipe exactly, but I did add a can of diced green chiles. I will be making this over and over again for sure, thanks.

I sliced the carrots instead of shredding them and added a minced jalapeño to jazz this up a little, and ended up with the perfect cold weather soup.  Thanks!

Just so happened that I had some left over (homemade) hamburger patties and left over baked potatoes in the fridge.  Chopped both of them up and used that!

This was great and  my four kids loved it, 3 of them had seconds and my 3 year old was done first!!

Will certainly make this again!

I make this once a month and this last time, I used a 16 oz. package of breakfast sausage.  I sneak in more veggies when possible, and increase the flour to make a bit thicker.  Love it with a couple shots of hot sauce in the bowl!

The taste was five stars but I only gave it four because I needed to work on the consistency. Took some of the others advice and did use 1 lb. of ground chuck and shredded cheddar. The shredded cheese worked out fine but I think I let the ground chuck brown to long and it broke up into finer pieces. Maybe next time I'll make mini-meatballs instead. I'm also not a shredded carrot fan so I cut baby carrots thinly. I added one too many cans of chicken broth which I will cut down the next time. My six year old loved it as well as the rest of us. This will be one that I will definately make again!

This recipe was a hit at our house. My husband and I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and the kids got home from school and were mad at us because we didn't save them any. I doubled the hamburger, veggies,liquid and sour cream. I cubed the potatoes a little too big, so when they were tender I smashed them in the pan with the ladel. It also made the soup a little thicker. Served with cresent rolls. Yum! We have also used frozen cubed hashbrowns or red potatoes.It eliminates the peeling of the potatoes.

This is a very rich and filling soup.  I served it with hot rolls.  It was perfect for this cool rainy day.  I used light velveeta and shredded hasbrown potatoes because they were quicker.  It turned out great, I will make this again.

I've made a similar recipe from Taste of Home magazine many times with these changes: No carrots, brown 1 lb ground beef with onion and celery,drain, add broth, seasonings (I include some minced garlic and worchestshire)  and potatoes (cut into small chunks) and simmer in 3 cans chicken broth until potatoes are tender.  Use 1/2 stick margarine and  1/3 cup flour to make a roue and add to mix , wisking well .  This breaks up the potatoes some and makes it thicker.  I add only about 1 cup of milk, and a mix of american (2 slices), monterey and cheddar cheeses (about 2 cups)..a touch of pepper jack cheese and/or red pepper flakes gives it some pizazz...sour cream optional .

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. Easy to make and tasty. I went with the whole pound of hamburger and I liked it. I think that next time I will add chopped broccoli just because I think it will taste good in it. My 4 year old that never met a soup she didn't like, ate 2 bowls! My non-meat eater ate carrots and dip and my teenager sampled but the rest of us were satisfied. This will be on the menu again. I accidently forgot the sour cream, but I don't think it was missed so I'll save the fat for something else. I also skipped the butter when browning the meat and veggies, I didn't see the need for it.

Our family loves home-made soups and this will stay on our list of favorites!  Sometimes melting cheese makes a soup greasy, so I used about 1 1/2 c cubed Velveeta.  Smooth, creamy, cheesy, and delicious!

I served this soup when all my children were home.  They ate it up!  But, it needs more cheese.  I put grated cheese on the table and they added quite a bit individually.  I will also put more hamburger into it for a meatier flavor.

At first it sounded suspicious but I loved it and there was enough for at least 8 people!  The only drawback is that it requires a lot of ingredients.

I just made this last night and I liked it.  The kids even ate it, and my husband said it was okay (he doesn't usually get excited about food, of any kind!).  I used a whole pound of ground beef, and a garlic/herb seasoning mix instead of the basil.  It's not a pretty dish, but it has good flavor (make sure you season the ground beef as it cooks).  I even thought about adding some bacon bits as garnish (bacon cheeseburger soup)!

I make this soup a lot and I really love it, but I found that using velveeta is much better than cheddar, but i add some cheddar to make it a bit sharper. I also use more basil and more pepper.

I doubled the meat and used meat broth and velveeta cheese as others had mentioned.  I also used macaroni instead of potatoes.  It was great, although next time I will definately make this w/  the potatoes. It just seemed more of a potato soup than pasta.  Definately a keeper!!

I made this for the family shortly after Christmas, everyone loved it.  I used about a one pound of ground beef and did use the cheddar cheese.  Next time I am going to try the Velveeta.

Very good!  I used beef broth instead of chicken.  Next time I might use more than a 1/2 pound of ground beef.  My kids said it's great, but where is the cheeseburger part??

This was GREAT! Although unless I made it completely wrong, it would better be described as "stew" It took awhile to cut things up (I'm a novice in the kitchen) but other than that, it was fairly easy, and my husband and 2 year old daughter LOVED it!

I made this recipe last night and loved it! I live in the Midwest and love soups on cold evenings, so last night fit the bill. All the ingredients worked together. I would suggest using shredded cheese as opposed to cubes, though. Otherwise I wouldn't change anything, other than to adjust quantities to suit your own taste. Definitely use one pound of hamburger though. Yummy!

My family loved this! I’ve actually made a few times and listened to the reviews. I didn’t add carrots or celery and I used cheddar and velveeta cheese. I also used beef broth instead of chicken.

I used about 4 lbs of baking potatoes. Peeled then cubed them and then coated with some salt and olive oil and baked at 350 covered with aluminum foil for about an hour. Blended half with the milk and broth. I replaced the milk with almond milk and the sour  cream with Greek yogurt. I probably used close to 2lbs of ground beef as well.

After reading the reviews, I was encouraged to make the ground beef have more of a cheeseburger taste. I tweaked the recipe & seasoned the beef like a cheeseburger: chopped onions, bell peppers, garlic, steak sauce, worcestershire sauce, & hamburger seasoning. I also used Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar & beef broth instead of chicken broth. Thank you for sharing this recipe & thanks fellow reviewers for your ideas. Omg, I LOVED this soup with these changes!!

I thought as-is this recipe was really bland. The base of the soup is good, but prepare to add a lot of seasonings. I added salt, black and white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and ground mustard. I would also season the ground beef while it's browning because that layer of flavor is really missing. Doctored up, this would be a solid 4 stars.

Probably the best soup I've ever made! So good! I made a few changes. I added double the amount of ground beef, because it just didn't seem like enough. It was very strange that the recipe didn't call for salt and pepper, so I added a teaspoon each, plus oregano, plus a Tbsp or two of minced garlic. I used an entire box (900ml) of chicken stock. Once I tasted the cooked potatoes (I left the skins on BTW), I decided it was going to need more flavour, so I used some jalapeño Monterey Jack and some shredded taco mix cheese. The soup was so flavourful and delicious! I will definitely be making it again.

I added broccoli, and used  sharp cheddar cheese.  I also used 1lb of ground chuck . Seasoned with lawry’’s seasoned salt. Added a lot of flavor. Before we thought it was bland.

Loved it and added bacon and chopped dill pickles.  If you’ve never had dill pickles in cheeseburger soup, you don’t know what you’re missing!

I made some minor changes to suit my taste and it turned out great! I used beef broth instead of chicken. Added extra onion and garlic. I drained the meat and added it to boiling broth and potatoes so it wasn’t greasy. Otherwise I followed the instructions and topped with hot sauce and it was fantastic!

Made as listed, after tastings felt it needed something.  I added salt and pepper along with cayenne. It improved but will add jalapenos and bacon next time.  Still good and the kids loved it.

I’ve tried other , different versions, this is by far THE best and tastiest of all I have tried. Every potluck i go to or family gathering, it’s the most requested food I get asked to bring and the most requested recipe I get asked to share! Velveeta I’m sorry,  is awful ! You must use REAL cheese, **Sharp**  cheddar and don’t skip the vegetables.  The soup will get thick as it cooks and the sour cream helps give it a velvety creaminess.  Have made this recipe so many times, I know it by heart now

I altered the recipe a little. For starters, 4 cups potatoes is a bit excessive compared to the amounts for the other ingredients, so I halved that. I don't tend to like cut potatoes in my soups and stews, so I used tator tots, instead. They broke up but they still add a texture and flavor. I added chopped red and green peppers  that I first cooked up in butter and white wine, to add another flavor so it'd be less bland. And also, I cooked the cheddar béchamel separate from the cooked beef mixture, then added it to it, and ended up needing an extra 1/2 to 3/4 cups of broth, didn't measure it. Next time I would add double the amount of carrots. Oh, I used sliced carrot, not shredded.

This turned out great! I also used frozen cubed hash browns for the potatoes, and Velveeta for the cheese (based on other’s suggestions). My kids and hubby gave it a thumbs up! Other than those 2 things, I made it exactly as the recipe states.

This is one of those “feel good” soups.  I’ve made this once before and we love it.  I used velveeta cheese instead of cheddar as it melts a little easier.

My family & I loved this recipe!  I didn't add celery, but the carrots were great!  I just moved & couldn't find my grater, so I just sliced them.  You could really personalize this recipe to whatever fits your likes & dislikes.  I love it the way it's written.  Its rich, hearty & comforting!  I saw that some people used velveeta cheese instead of shredded cheddar.  But just an FYI, it is creamy with the shredded cheddar.  And if you make it as written, it is thick.  No need to add potato flakes or corn starch....  Sooo good!!

I made this in my instant pot and substituted pepper jack cheese as we do not use Velvetta.
The taste of this soup is to die for. I made this following oral surgery and shared it with friends. I mashed mine and they ate it as prepared. They ate it is understatement, they ate every bite and I had doubled the recipe. This is a keeper recipe, thank you for sharing it.
I will be making this often.
I rate it 5 stars plus and I think the pepper jack took it over the top.

The cheese burger soup came out great, I had a jar of dill pickles on the counter from lunch, so I added some pickle juice to the soup. Also used beef broth and precooked potatoes in bacon grease. The soup turned out bacon cheeseburger soup with a hint of dill. Also added velveeta cheese and cubed cheddar.

Made this in crockpot exactly as written. Cooked the butter and flour then milk on stovetop until thickened. I added to crockpot and then added cheese. It was pretty good but it needed more seasoning. Perhaps a little hot sauce? For sure a bit f salt and pepper.

Based on other comments I made a couple of changes.   Added 8oz fresh sliced mushrooms, used 1 lb of hamburger,  and 1/2 cup flour.   I did not have chicken broth, so used beef broth.    It was super hearty.   My husband gave the 5 stars!

I did not fallow the recipe to the details b I made some variations. I used1/2 of a 26 oz can cream of mushroom soup and a full 12 oz can of evaporated milk, 1/2 8oz bag 4 cheese mexican blend, one package of onionsoup mix, and the cheese powder from dollar store mac&cheese dinner and one 15oz can sweet peas and about 1 1/2 cups mini shells pasta. It is AWESOME. I will definately make this again. There are several veriations that could be done with this recipe. My 9 year old little boy loves it. Thank you Allrecipes.com for this great recipe and so many others thatI have used to my families delight.

A very good soup which I will make again for sure. I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat and used homemade veg / bone marrow broth instead of chicken broth.

Definitely making this again!  Used all ingredients,  except sour cream as I didn't have any, but changed the quantity.  Used 5 cups potatoes, a full pound ground beef, made a little extra thick paste and added extra flour to that to make it thicker and through in extra cheese!  I LOVE IT!

Of course I made changes.  I doubled the ground beef.  Instead of adding the cheese to the soup, I made a roux and melted the cheese in it then added it to the soup.  There is NO salt or pepper in the receipe, so saying, I added a teaspoon of each to the roux.  Even my "soup hater" loved it.

Didn’t care for this at all so I ended up doctoring up the recipe by adding another 1/2 lb of beef and additional seasonings.  
Salt and pepper are a must, I also added garlic and a couple of other spices with a touch of worstershire.  
I didn’t like the cubes of cheese in the pot as it melted and changed the texture and flavor, instead I would opt to use it and the sour cream as a garnish once it’s been plated, and would definitely grate the cheese instead and top with green onions or chives & a little jalapeño if you like a little heat.  

I also served black bean tortilla chips on the side which really complimented it.

My family loves this soup. I've been making it since our Amish rest. Served it. My husband claims I didn't make enough. Of course when someone's stops in they got to try it!  Lots of raves. I use 3 c. Of Velveeta cheese. Very cheesy!

Great recipe!  I added a bit more beef and salt, and frozen hash browns because I was out of potatoes, but I kept everything else the same.  For those who found that it was too thin, simply make extra roux (flour/butter mixture).  This is a fabulous recipe!

I always make a recipe as written first to give an accurate rating. My husband and I both agreed that this was pretty bland as written. We added some diced pickles, mustard and Lowry’s seasoning salt to make it a 5-star recipe!

This was delicious!  I made a few changes:  I used 73% lean ground beef, so I used the fat rendered from it to saute the veggies in and the excess I used in place of some of the butter for the milk sauce.  I also used american cheese instead of cheddar (it's all I had) and beef broth instead of chicken to give it a beefier flavor.  This was utterly delicious and will definitely go on the rotation again in the future.

My family raves about this recipe; however I thought it was a little bland. I added quite a bit of season salt once I served myself a bowl. I also added more cheese while cooking. My daughter suggested adding mushrooms and more sour cream next time so I will definitely try that.

1/25/19:  For a 11 year old recipe, this Cheeseburger Soup is well crafted genius!!  Thank you, Auntylene for sharing this with us all!!  My 2nd time making this soup --was quite good; I cubed a 16 oz. soft block of Velveeta, but it's not sharp enough....and an 8 oz. bag of shredded sharp cheddar  still wasn't enough.  Healthy dash amounts of Italian seasoning and Mrs. Dash ( Table Blend ); good call there.  Low on milk, so I added 1 can of Cream of Cheddar soup and 1 can of Cream of Celery ( what the heck, right? ).  I browned my cubed potatoes ( after browning ground beef ) with a nice blend of small diced green peppers ( I forgot the fine diced onions---but I didn't need them ).  And all THIS, went into my pressure cooker for 15 minutes, OH YEAH!!  Family approved--and am looking forward to some other tweaking ideas!! You GOT to make this soup: Great winter day comfort food.

This recipe is fantastic! I did tweak it a little. I used chicken broth and beef broth, a whole pound of ground beef and a shallot instead of an onion and added a bay leaf. Delicious!

With a name like Cheeseburger Soup, what is not to love? My family was excited to try this soup but sadly of the 4 eating it only 1 liked it. Their biggest complaint was that it didn't taste how they were expecting and thought it was bland. 
To make the soup, I doubled the recipe and make it primarily in my crockpot which I think let to my soups darker appearance than most other pictures (AR will only show the first page of pics for me). The soup did not thicken up in the slow cooker so I did end up transferring to a large pot and adding maybe 1/4 cup of gluten free all purpose flour and that did the trick.

Just made this recipe, it is Awesome! I added Kale, to give it some more veggies, and use a full pound of ground chuck. Other than that did as directed. I will definitely be making this again, I may even try replacing the ground chuck with simmered stew beef.

We really liked this quick and easy recipe.  I used one  cup of Gouda  cheese shredded in place of half the cheddar.  Very smooth and not the least bit oily.   A winner!

I do this recipe, but double the ground beef, onions, and celery.  I also use Velveeta as most recipes call for that instead.  It is much worse for you,  but way tastier.

I love this soup, my whole family likes it and they are all super picky eaters. In the recipe online it forgets to say you have to make the roux (flour, butter, and milk mixture) in a separate pan and then add it to the soup, it just says add it but you guys left out separate pan, but besides that, great recipe!!

I used 1lb of hamburger meat. I don’t like to cook with onions so I used onion powder. I also left out the sour cream. And used a block of velveeta for the cheese. Also added an extra cup of chicken broth. It was perfect!!!

This soup is definitely worth making, but only with a few adjustments. I added some cayenne pepper to it and bacon bits. For the cheese, velvetta is more agreeable for the creamy texture, and I would add a lot less as it turns out overpowering. I would add more basil, onion, carrots, and celery. Other than that, this soup is so good! With my adjustments, 4.5 stars; without, 3 stars.

I found this recipe in a small book years ago. I always have to make a double batch to share. Everyone loves it. Thank you for posting it. It’s much easier now that I don’t have to search for the book each time I make it. It’s a really great soup!

Very good soup. Like another reviewer said, I thought since it was a "burger" soup I should use beef stock, but I think that may have been a mistake, as it over powered the cheese flavor and I'm all about cheese. I even added extra cheese, 9 slices American cheese, and it still was not cheesy enough. I now know that is why the soup is to be made with chicken broth as it is milder in flavor and the cheese will not get lost in the soup. After all this is "cheese burger soup" and not "burger soup". I may try adding some bacon next time for a bacon cheese burger soup. I'd add sliced mushrooms, but my husband doesn't like mushrooms. I will definitely be making again.

Love this soup.  Couple of slight tweaks to the preparation.   I put the carrots in a food processor.   I also tweaked the cream preparation.  Melted flour and butter and when I added the milk, I made sure it cooked enough to make almost a custard like consistency.  I shredded cheddar cheese and added this to the custard prep and heated until cheese was melted.  I then added this to the meat, broth, vegetable mixture.  This gave the liquid a nice even consistency.

Pretty tasty. I followed others suggestions and used frozen cubed potatoes.  I also upped the meat and used 1/2 & 1/2.   My batch came out thick and creamy the way we like soup. Though I love me some sour cream I may try it without it the next time.  Great comfort food.

I used cooked cauliflower instead of potatoes and just put them in right before the milk flour mixture. Husband thought they were potatoes at first. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had. I added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder at the end because it needed a little more flavor.  I'm sure the kind of cheddar you use can make a big difference. I used a sharp white cheddar. It melted wonderfully.  Very delicious soup.

Base recipe is that solid foundation, but this is definitely a soup that lends itself to 'tweaking'.
My not so secret, secret ingredient? Tater tots. They come apart in the soup, help thicken and from a size/texture perspective they blend perfectly with the ground beef.

Unanimously, the family thought is was an ugly soup. The teen said it looks like dog vomit ... and he wasn't wrong.

But ... I doubled the recipe and in feeding 5 people, we had none leftover by the time dinner was done.

I think this recipe is a great foundation, but like it's namesake, you will probably want to play with it and discover your own fixins'.

If you try the tater tod mod ... and I highly recommend it, be aware of salt. Between broth, cheese (we used 1/2 velveeta for that buttery color and 1/2 cheddar, with some leftover taco cheese thrown in), check to see how much salt the tots add.  I cooked the tots for about 1/2 the recommended time, so as to not throw frozen tots in the soup.

This is a WONDERFUL dish to make. It's simple and easy. I did make changes to make it more of a "Cheeseburger Soup". I took out the celery and carrots, basil and parsley. I added 2 -3  tablespoons of yellow mustard, salt and pepper, 1 medium tomato and a chopped small head of lettuce. I stirred in these veggies about 10 minutes before taking it off the stove. 
This quickly turned into a family favorite. Its also something you can prepare the night before, and take it to a potluck.  Save adding the lettuce and tomato until just before serving.

I will try this one more time, but I will not use sharp cheddar.  The only change to the recipe I made was beef instead of chicken broth.  My husband is allergic to chicken, so this was a necessity.  I found the flavor to be lacking.  I tasted the sharpness of the cheese, and that was it.  I sprinkled bacon on top of mine, just to give it some flavor.  I think between the onions and the carrots there might have been too much sugar??  I will say that my husband gives it four stars.  I gave it two, so I averaged the two scores.

Almost identical to the Taste of Home recipe mentioned, I used a pound of extra lean beef.  Changed the cheese to 1 cup each cheddar and velveeta and replaced the milk with cream.  And of course, corn starch for flour to make a gluten free version.  The most requested soup at our house".

I didn't have celery, so I used zucchini instead. I also always use plain nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, so I used that instead as well. It was SO DELICIOUS!!! I topped it with dill pickle slices and ate it with rolls. Tastes like a cheeseburger! YUM-O!

I my family loved this recipe , I did make some adjustments to it. I used more ingredients to make more of the soup. I also drained off some of the grease from the meat , seasoned it, and I added in bacon. I topped it with cheese and pickles. I will definitely make this again

As written, it was pretty good! I made a few changes, of course, and it really pushed it over the top. I drained half the grease from the meat, and browned the meat and celery/carrots with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and 2 tsp of beef bouillon granules. I also did beef broth instead of chicken, and added chopped dried chives. It was delicious with the changes, and I will make this again!

Really good. Would give it 10 stars for taste and ease of preparing it.  Only thing I did different was cooked the meat and onions in skillet, drained it and then added it to big pot. Family loves this with French bread and a side salad. I have to make a double batch every time.  Thanks for sharing.

I have very picky eaters and this soup was a hit. I diced the celery, carrots, and onion super fine so the kids wouldn't know it was in there. I made a double batch, I didn't have enough milk so I used evaporated instead and it was so good. I probably will add a little garlic next time...my son is already asking me to make this again. The double batch was gone by the second day.

6  It didn't last even 24 hours!

I made this almost exactly as written, except I used 1/4c. cream cheese instead of the sour cream.  Ironically, this is the same recipe on the Taste of Home website.  It was a bit bland so I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, some Worcestershire sauce, and some bacon grease.  I know, I know but I could have sauteed the vegetables in a bit of bacon grease, but I forgot.  Or,  you could sprinkle some chopped, cooked bacon on top.  Who doesn't love a bacon cheeseburger?

Just made this at work. It is delicious. And as long as you actually prep everything before making it. It really is a fast and easy recipe to make. I used red potatoes with the skin still on to bring more color to the soup. And I substituted 12 oz of beer for some of the chicken stock. Made for an even more tasty soup.

I doubled the meat and used velveeta.  I also thickened with potato flakes. I think what really made this was the garnish.  We used a pinch of cheddar cheese,  sour cream and pickles!  The pickles were a hit!

This has got to be the most bland soup I have ever tasted. I followed the instructions to a 't'. Just don't bother with this one. I was able to save it by adding bacon and some seasoning salt, but its still not great. When making a new soup I usually make a single batch, but normally regret not making a double. This time I made a double and am so sad that I have so much of this soup to eat.

Made it, used Velveeta because of a couple suggestions, and I forgot to add sour cream at the end. But... it was a winner! I might suggest some green onion at the end as a topping. Oh, and I added pre cooked bacon, too. So good and filling!!

Very delicious soup!  If it's lacking a bit of flavor, add a few teaspoons of chicken bouillon till the taste is to your liking! I also used 1 c. Kraft White Cheddar and bacon cheese, and 1 c. regular sharp cheddar cheese!  Yum!

love, love, love this soup.  sometimes (if I have it), I substitute Velveeta cheese for the cheddar.  I think it makes it a bit creamier.  but there's nothing wrong cheddar!!!  my husband RAVES about this soup.  and at times, we have taken some to people that were struggling with health issues.  they went crazy for it!!!  and it doesn't really take a long time to make........and it's a ONE-POT soup!!!

Although I didn’t use cheddar cheese this recipe was so easy and so good. Kraft has a Smokey bacon cheddar shredded cheese so I used that instead and ohhhhhh man was it good plus my kids loved it!

I was looking for something different in soups.  Found this recipe.  Made it exactly the way the recipe was written and it turned out fantastic! My husband wasn’t so sure he was going to like it but now he’s asking me to make it again 2 weeks later.

very good. cheesy and the veggies make it better than just having cheese and ground beef. Kid friendly. I used 2 blocks ( the small individual ones) of velveeta and shredded sharp cheddar as well.

I just love this soup. One of a few recipes that I really do not alter.  The only thing I do is triple it for a small group meeting and they like it too.   Really like   allreciepes.com .

As many do, I used what was on hand.  I had ground venison and I also went with a recommendation from another review to use velveeta.  It would have turned out great had I stuck strictly to the ingredients too.  This just speaks to its versatility.

This recipe as written seemed the tiniest bit bland. It needed salt & garlic to give it great flavor. Because it reminded me of a creamy potato soup with meat, I added 2 cups of frozen corn to make it a heartier chowder. We loved it!!

Delicious! I made the recipe without sour cream and no herbs since i have none, and it still turned out great! I saved this recipe and will definitely make it again. I shredded my carrots too fine and they disappeared somewhere in the soup, so make sure to shred the carrots thicker than a zest haha

I made this recipe with part cauliflower/part potatoes to cut down on the carbs. I've done this before in several other 'potato soup' recipes. Didn't work well with this one. Maybe my proportions were off?  Not sure...but this was excellent, except for my cauliflower sub. I look forward to making again. I will follow the recipe next time!!!

Five stars with some changes. I added salt and pepper (a good bit, I didn't measure because I was adding it and tasting) Cut way back on butter and I used beef broth instead of chicken to increase the beefiness. Great for tonight's cool rainy weather.

Hubby and I were really looking forward to making this. I made the soup as is and did not like it at all. Not enough flavor. Added some velveeta cheese I had in the fridge which made it a tiny bit better but not much. IF I make it again, I'll add different spices and only do a whole velveeta cheese to give it a creamier cheesier taste.

I loosely followed this recipe with what i had for spices in the cupboard. It  turned out really good. I froze it in portions in the freezer and take out single portions for work or a snack.

I found the soup salty even though no extra salt was added, must have been in the chicken broth. Personally I would increase the sour cream and sharp chedder. Over all a good tasty soup for cold weather.

I made a few changes.  
I didn't have enough potatoes so, I added a head of cauliflower.
Instead of shredded carrots, I sliced them.
I used 1 # of Ground Beef and I didn't brown the meat in the butter.  I felt it was not necessary.
Instead of using all sharp cheese, I used a marble cheese and farmers cheese.  
I made my roux separately and added the cheese to it.  Once the cheese was all melted, I added it to the soup.  

Thank you for the recipe!!! It is a KEEPER!!!

I decided to make this recipe on a snow day and let me just say...WOW!! This recipe hit the spot!! My husband is the pickiest eater ever. He normally turns his nose up to anything that has vegetables in it and he LOVED it!! Normally, the first time I cook a recipe just as it reads. I had to improvise a little bit with a couple of things though since we were snowed in! I didn't have any celery on hand so I used cream of celery soup. I used 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of broth which is just slightly more than 3 cups. And I had to use 1 1/2 c. of shredded cheddar and I used a couple of Velveeta sliced cheese because I didn't quite have enough shredded cheese. I also omitted the onion and just added onion powder to my ground beef. We're not much on onion. I highly recommend this recipe! I will most definitely be making it again!!

Added one diced jalapeño and some diced dill pickles for the full cheeseburger soup experience. Subbed potatoes with rices cauliflower. Love that this recipe doesn't call for canned soups and processed cheese.

My kids and I loved it. I used 1 full lb ground beef and I added some garlic and bacon bits. I also used frozen hashbrowns to save on time.

Very rich so I added a small can of diced tomatoes which I was surprised wasn't included anyway.  Would also be good with some pepper jack cheese to replace some of the cheddar I think.

Very, very yummy! Highly recommended! I did use beef broth (4 cups instead of 3) and added some garlic (personal preference) and pepper. Also, cooked/drained ground beef prior to cooking vegetables and started the potatoes in the broth while beef was cooking. Super easy! I would assume bacon, mushrooms, etc would be great thrown in!

I made this with 1/2 plain sausage, 1/2 ground beef.   It gives it a nice flavor.  I also split the batch and used 1/2 Jarlsberg, 1/2 White American in one and cheddar in the other for a different twist.   Both were very good!

Really good soup! Perfect for a fall day. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added salt, pepper and garlic powder. Followed the advice to add roux to soup before the milk and it made the perfect consistency!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I followed the instructions, but then ended up browning some more hamburger and throwing in some bacon because it just wasn't meaty enough for my family's taste.

This was okay as is, but I think the soup needs beef broth instead of chicken broth. I could still taste flour, so next time I will, in a separate pan, make a roux (stir flour into the melted butter) and add the cheese to that, before combining with the broth mixture.

This soup is a definite keeper! Everyone loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe. I did put in twice the chicken broth and extra cheese and sour cream (we like our soup brothy). I also used frozen potatoes obrien instead of fresh. This was so delicious, everyone had seconds and told me they want me to make it again. Even my teenager who won't eat a vegetable. (little did he know how many are in here).

This soup is so good and so easy! I've made it multiple times. Friends always ask me for the recipe when I serve it! You can add/change anything you want. I usually use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and coconut flour instead of white flour. You can't even tell the difference. I'm adding mushrooms today for a little twist. So good!

Loved this recipe!  I read the reviews and did the following:  cooked beef and drained; added small can of green chiles and spices and onion flakes & celery seed.  Cubed 2 large potatoes w/skins and thin sliced carrots - cooked in microwave, covered, w/some water until soft.  Added veggies to meat and poured in broth; brought a boil, then back to simmer.  In another pan, I melted butter and flour mixture - cooked on med high, stirring constantly,  for about 2 minutes until thick and then gradually added milk until smooth.  I gradually added milk mixture to soup, stirring constantly.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer for 2-3 hours (really combines the flavors better). Before serving,  I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese until melted.  Totally awesome!

This is a good soup but lacks a pop of flavor due to the lack of spices and heavy reliance on cheese for flavor.  Beware, it takes quite a while to make so make sure to allow time for this recipe. I'm not sure how much I'll make this one as it is not a healthy choice for my family and this recipe has got to be a diet buster even with the low fat choices I made with the ingredients.

I like it just the way it was. However, if I changed anything I would add bacon, pepper, garlic and green onion but thats just me. I used frozen chunk hashbrowns for the potatos and that saved alot of time and turned out great.

Amazing, my kids all agree this will be a keeper! The recipe is not very clear, however when you melt the butter you want to gradually add the flour and continuously stir to make a roux, once you have a paste then gradually add milk. This is how you get the thickness. I also doubled the hamburger and cheese and omitted the butter to the hamburger mix because hamburger is greasy enough! Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!!!

I make this ALOT. It's a family favorite for sure. I just started a new diet which means no carbs. So Instead of potatoes I just warmed up a big bag of frozen cauliflower. Minced it in the food processor and added that in. The 8 year old didn't notice a difference at all!!!!!! I won't tell.  Very good!! Oh and instead of flour I just thickened with a little corn starch slurry.

This is a delicious soup. I slice the carrots instead of shredding them. I also use 1 lb of ground beef as a few others have suggested. I combine the flour and butter in small skillet and stir together until bubbly and then gradually add the milk, stirring until smooth and then I add it to the soup mixture to thicken.

Great Soup, just tweaked it a little bit according to what I had on hand.  I use beef broth instead of chicken and half and half instead of regular milk to make it creamier. I also used whole wheat flour and diced up a red pepper to substitute for the celery that I didn't have.  I also had some cabot's seriously sharp yellow cheddar on hand and used that along w/ a few slices of cooper sharp.  I also used more meat than the receipt called for.  I'd say I used a full pound of 80/20 ground chuck.  I also added a some salt, pepper and lawry's seasoning salt at the end to taste.  Great cold weather soup.  Can't wait to eat it day 2!

I use recipes off of the site all the time, and never really review them. This was a soup/stew that my entire family, little kids and teenagers and husband all loved. To sum it up, I used half cubed cheddar cheese and half velveeta cheese, I used half cubed up Raw potatoes and half frozen tater tot's, I microwaved bacon nice and crisp and crumbled it up in the mix as well. With the exception of the flour and milk and butter mixture, I did everything in one stock pot which made it much simpler. Instead of shredded carrots, I simply cubed up the baby carrots from a bag. Everyone loved it!! It is stick to your ribs good for a perfect cold day. Not a weight watcher meal!

This was a HIT in my house during a blizzard-y weekend! My husband went back for seconds... And then thirds! I left out the celery and dried parsley because I didn't have any on hand. I also added a cube of beef bullion to up the flavor. This was simple, delicious, and I'll be making this one again for sure!

This is a good recipe, very comforting on a cold night and kid friendly. I doubled the beef, and doubled the parsley and basil. I also added 1 cup more broth and 1/2 cup more milk. It was a little bland so I added a dash of onion powder and some pepper.

Like some other reviewers, I simplify the recipe (and save time) by using a 28 oz. bag of hashed brown potatoes, thawed, and a 12 oz. bag of frozen mirepoix.  I usually add a full lb. of hamburger as well.

Just made this today. Deeeeelicous and filling. My changes: 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 gouda cheeses. I added some salt and pepper. This is a keeper!!

Key to making it thick... make the roux, then add milk and let it get thick and creamy. Add this to the soup and it is not watery at all. Very hearty meal.

I had lost my original recipe for this soup and my family requested it. I altered it only slightly and was very happy with the outcome. I use a little more ingredients-just about double-as I have six mouths to feed. I used Velveeta instead of cheddar because I had it on hand. I don't care for parsley in my beef base soups, so I omitted that, chopped all veggies, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and used frozen southern style hashbrowns rather than potatoes. Tasted just as great as my original. This one is in the favorites file, for sure.

I give this three stars because my husband really liked this recipe. I personally would have given it one star.  I didn't care for this at all.  I found the taste unappealing. Can't quite put my finger on what was wrong, but I won't make this again.  Really didn't like this recipe.

This soup was tasty but it reminded me nothing of a cheeseburger. It definitely needed more ground beef. I used a pound and still wasn't  very meaty also couldn't taste the cheese at all Im thinking maybe some velveeta cheese would have been better. More rich and creamy. This tasted more like a vegetable soup with a hint of ground beef then anything else. Tasted good though.

I didn't have the basil but made the soup as directed. My husband and I loved it. I have different ideas for add-ins if the mood to strike: bacon, jalapeños, mushrooms and Swiss cheese. I'm looking forward  to trying different flavor combinations!

The base of this recipe is good I made a few changes, I used noodles instead of potatoes but I boiled them last in a separate boil to keep from getting mushy. I used a can of Rotella to add a little kick to it. I also used beef broth instead of chicken and I used velveta cheese.

This had an incredible flavor aftertaste. I did not have the sour cream so I added some leftover turkey bacon, crumbled. I also substituted the beef with lean ground turkey.  

I loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again.

Very delicious... the perfect hearty winter comfort soup.  Didn't change a thing. Served with homemade bread...mmmm, good.  Thank you for a non-Velveeta recipe for this soup.  Note: My prep time was a lot longer than 20 minutes; more like 1 hour for me.  I also doubled the recipe.

This is a good "tastes like summer" recipe.  I also upped the hamburger to 1# and added garlic after sautéing the vegies and used that fat to cook the flour. I also think the beef stock recommendation was a good idea so I did that as well.   The additions  that I like are, after the liquids,  a big squirt of ketchup and about a tsp. of dry mustard to really give it that cheeseburger taste.  Being a California burger gal, I added a chopped head of romaine lettuce....dang....If I wait a hour, can I go swimming?  thanks for a really good (which is a great compliment, as 5 stars is for the OMG recipes)  addition to this , go-to site.

Turned out great! We added a bit more cheese. I mean, hey, you can't go wrong with more cheese.

I made changes to my husband's liking as I'm a vegetarian: 1lb beef, dijon mustard, French fried onions & reg, green pepper, garlic, worchestershire, liquid smoke, beef broth, pepper jack & Colby. I didn't have sour cream and omitted carrots, celery, basil & parsley as I do not use that with homemade burgers. The possibily is endless. How about mushroom & swiss next time? Diced tomatoes, corn & jalapeños? Grill your burgers, add a quality liquid smoke or smoked cheeses to make it more authentic tasting. Add what you like to get the results you are expecting or to mock your favorite burger. I will make a vegetarian version soon ;) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious. I used 1 lb of extra lean ground beef and omitted the celery.  I used frozen shredded hashbrowns, 8 oz of cubed sharp cheddar and 8 oz of cubed velveeta.   This makes a thick soup.  Will definitely make again.

Yum!  I was really looking forward to indulging, so I used a full pound of ground beef, 4 cups of beef broth, 16oz Velveeta cheese, and a full 8oz sour cream.  I added the cheese to the butter/flour/milk mixture and seasoned with salt and pepper before stirring into the soup.

I've been making this for a few years. The only thing I changed was substituting the potatoes for hash browns for time sake. Very good and simple to make, the little kids loved it. Feeds a family of 7!

I couldn't find my old cheeseburger soup recipe so I tried this one.  It came out kind of bland and as other reviewers mentioned I will leave out the potatoes next time.  It ended up to me like an average potato soup  with a little hamburger thrown in.

This soup is excellent! All the food groups are represented, meat, potatoes  , veggies and cheese! I make this all the time in the fall & winter months, my family loves it. There is never any leftover. For simplicity & to get more vegetables in I use the frozen medley package of veggies and I sauté them in the butter with onion & garlic.  I add 2 pounds of hamburger( we like our meat) and about 6-7 cups of low sodium  broth for a bigger batch ( 2 teenage boys & a husband who are big eaters)
 This makes it very hearty.

Excellent recipe! Definitely make it a day ahead. I doubled the recipe,  used Velveeta cheese in the cooking and topped each individual serving with sharp shredded cheese.  I added half chopped red pepper  to the other vegetables for  presentation purposes only. I also, finished sautéing the vegetables by adding the flour to that mixture. An excellent crowd pleasing recipe!! Thank you for sharing it. BTW, I added Worcestershire sauce for flavor....that took the soup to fantastic!

In some ways I don't know if I should rate this recipe because when I make it it is completely modified.  This is a great base/idea recipe.  The one major thing I do differently is I add shell pasta or barley instead of potatoes.  I have a kid that doesn't like potatoes.

Me and my family absolutely love this soup! I always recommend it to family and friends! I do leave out basil and parsley which to us doesn't make a difference. I had garlic seasoning to the hamburger meat while it is cooking. I cook meat and onions first once meat is brown I then add the carrots and celery. I finish everything like it says. Once put together I let the soup cook for an hour or two on low not boiling or simmering because of the cheese. I added a couple of cubes of velveta with shredded cheddar cheese this time. I also add more sour cream because we LOVE sour cream.

Excellent! Uses basic, common ingredients and has great taste. I usually use more than a 1/2pound of meat and have played around with using bacon and/or breakfast sausage with or instead of the ground beef. I usually use sharp or extra sharp cheddar, but have also thrown in the last of whatever cheese I have left in the fridge. I also like to add dill weed for a little extra tang!

Pretty good.  I used ground turkey.  I did not use the parsley or basil.  I used pepper, lawry's seasoning and adobo. I would also skip the carrots next time.  It was perfect because I just happened to be sick and I love hearty soups.

Perfect as is but. Because I can be lazy I made some changes to speed up the process. For doubled recipe: used 2# XTRA lean meat, a little olive oil and only 4 tbsp butter. Used precut onion (1 1/2 of 8oz size pk) precut celery (2 pks 6oz size) and shredded carrots about 2 1/2 cups. Seasoned with the basil and parsley but added salt/pepper/cayenne to taste. Added flour directly to veggie/meats. (Used xtra flour as I used xtra "BEEF" broth as well 2-4cup containers) and used Ore Ida frozen "steam n mash" cut russet potatoes. (All found at publix) added potatoes to larger pot partially mashed and then the browned meat/veggies and then broth/milk/cheese. Easy!!

This is my go to recipe for cheeseburger soup!  I add garlic powder to the meat and veggies while cooking.  I use mostly thyme instead of basil.  While making the roux, I use half and half or cream instead of milk.  I add more meat (twice as much) and if I double the recipe (which I always do) I use 2 cups Velveta (it melts so much nicer) and 2 cups sharp cheddar.  Any recipe can be tweaked to the cook's taste and preference though :-)

My family loves this soup. I use shredded cheese simply because that is what I always have on hand, and I add garlic (because I add garlic to just about everything).  This is easy to make and super yummy.  I prefer it without the tang of the sour cream, but it's good either way.

I use a jar of queso cheese in stead of the cubbed cheese makes it creamier and also adds a little kick to it. Love this recipe. Also serve it in a sour dough bread bowl.

LOVED IT!!! And in the name of carb-control, I replaced the potatoes with diced cauliflower stems. My husband (who is NOT a huge vegetable fan) couldn't tell the difference! Will most definitely make this again.

Pretty good!  Basically another potato soup recipe.  It definitely needs salt and pepper, maybe the author thought that was implied.  I added a good bit of garlic powder as well.  Doubled the ground beef which I think is a must.  Fresh parsley instead of dried helped quite a bit.  Not as great as I hoped but enjoyed making this one and my son really liked it.

My son is a huge cheeseburger fan.. I made this with deer meat and left over deer sausage.. (Husband is a huge hunter) .. I cooked it over 50 mins 1:15 I cooked before adding my cheese (used velveeta) stirring consistently.. Added chopped garlic and 1/3 green pepper with browning meat.. Was great.. For those who thought  it was watery.. Add corn starch to thicken..  I served with steamed corn and crusty bread and chopped cooked bacon on the side..

delish!! I used 1 lb. of ground beef, no celery, or basil because I didnt have it on hand. I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of chicken and used velveeta cheese instead of cheddar. Easy to throw together! And we topped with bacon as per other reviews!

A few additions...followed advice and used beef stock instead of chicken.  Added 1/4 cup bacon bits and 1 tsp. of garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce.  It was still missing a little zing at the end, so added 1 tsp. season salt, several dashes of Jalepeno hot sauce and fresh ground pepper. Beautiful!

Awesome soup! For the most part I followed the recipe. I omitted the butter though and did use velveeta cheese. It has become one of our favorite soups this winter.

We LOVE this soup.  My kids both love it, and that is unusual, lol.  I make it just as is, except for using velveeta instead of cheddar.  There is actually less calories in Velveeta, too!  I like to double this recipe and freeze some of it too.

I used left over taco seasoned ground turkey instead of beef.  I didn't have regular shredded cheddar cheese and so I used velveeta cheese instead.  I didn't have celery so I added in broccoli.  Everything else in this recipe I used.  It was the perfect recipe to use up left over meat.

Delicious soup! I use beef broth and also usually make it the day after we had meat loaf (once even used leftover burgers), as the meatloaf left over is never enough for the whole family. But with this soup it is plenty!

I love soups on cold, rainy nights and of my many good soup recipes, this is in the top three. It's very filling and delicious.  Tip: Don't cut corners with this recipe. The fresh ingredients are what make this a superb soup. I also highly recommend only using sharp cheddar cheese. I made it once with frozen veggies and once with colby jack cheese as I didn't have what it calls for, and it was not even close to the same flavor either time.  Per a different review about cheeseburgers not having celery and carrots - you don't actually taste those flavors in the soup but they are necessary in it and you can't rightfully give this recipe 3 stars without putting them in it.

I omitted the carrots and basil, added about 1/2 tsp of paprika, and at the end it was so creamy that I didn't think it needed the sour cream. I took this to an event and it got tons of compliments!

After reading some of the other reviews I decided to add 1/2 cup heavy cream in addition to the milk and also added a packet of velveeta cheese sauce along with the shredded cheese. It was so thick and creamy. I also made home made bread to go along with it and my family gobbled it up! Perfect for a lazy Sunday.

Tried this as written and it was pretty good but it needed a teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper. I wasn't crazy about the sharp cheddar but then that is just my taste I guess. I'll probably try mild cheddar next time and then possibly velveeta another time to see which everyone likes better.

So good on this cold and windy evening!! I read some other reviews and made some minor adjustments. As another person suggested I used a pound of hamburger. I omitted the celery, used Italian seasoning in place of the parsley and basil, added season salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic salt to taste. Also, I added a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoe purée. This gave the soup a little kick but not too much because I wanted it to be kid friendly. I used 1/4 cup butter with the flour instead of reducing it by a tablespoon like the directions read.  I used a little over a cup of milk. Other then the small changes I followed the instructions and this turned out great!

I made the recipe to spec and I was pleased with it as it's written and that's what my rating reflects. I did make some changes my second time around. I shredded my cheese instead of cubing it. I added some paprika and cayenne pepper to spice it up. In the spirit of cheeseburger goodness I diced a dill pickle spear and garnished my soup with it. I really think this recipe is an awesome foundation because there are many different places you can take this recipe. May add cooked and chopped bacon next time. Have fun with this and thank you for sharing!

I loved the recipe. I added a few different spices  and used beef broth instead of the suggested chicken broth.

I have made this soup many times for my family and it is always a Home Run! It is our absolute favorite go to cold day soup! Once you've made it a few times try experimenting with different veggies. I love to use ground turkey, diced tomatoes and Velveeta!

Big favorite at our house now! My four year old asked for a bigger bowl... :) we added a few peppers from the garden before they froze...  Couple mexi bells chopped and a little garlic. And I used all lowfat cheeses, milk and sour cream. Low sodium broth! I will definitely make again!

I really, really liked this recipe!  Very hearty and I topped each serving with some shredded lettuce, diced tomato, fresh bacon bits, and shredded cheddar just for that "cheeseburger" feel and theme.  SO GOOD!  I used beef broth (didn't have chicken)and used closer to 5 cups of potatoes.  Once the potatoes broke down the soup was very thick, which was exactly what I was after.  I'm not huge on processed foods (velveeta/potato flakes) which other reviewers subbed with, they have a funny after taste.  I had no issues with the block extra sharp cheeses I shredded in the food processor not being creamy enough.  If it is too water, just let it cook down, not a biggie (but a little extra potato and flour helps).  I have made this several times and love it each and every time!

This soup was good. I will make it again but will definitely use less potatoes and more meat next time. Seemed more like cheese potato soup instead of cheese burger! But as another review said, it is a good base recipe! Oh, and it should have said to add milk slowly. It just says to add milk to butter and flour, should be smooth. Well, it wasn't smooth at all. It was lumpy flour in watery milk. So I dumped the milk in another bowl and re added the milk a little at a time while stirring to get it smooth. But the recipe should have explained that.

Absolutely excellent. Wasn't sure about the basil (?) but it worked. Cooked carrots/celery in a separate pan in beef broth (didn't use chicken 'cause it's a beef dish), and potatoes in separate pan because of cooking times. Then added them to meat/onions and continued with roux and cheese. I had some really good sharp NY cheddar. Perfection!!!

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe and it was a big hit at my house.  It has wonderful flavour and it's a nice, thick soup that would be great for those cold winter days.  I saw someone else in their review say that they add crumbled bacon to it, which would be an even nicer flavour so I may try that next time I make it.  This one is definitely going into the "Best Recipes Yet" category at home!

This is my kids new favourite soup! The only thing I changed is we use a gluten free flour mix due to celiac. Made it for a couple of potluck dinners and it is the first soup to go! I always double the recipe and there is no left overs.

This soup is so delicious - hearty but not too heavy.  I used 1% milk and only half the amount of cheese (1 cup) and it was great.  I had the idea to substitute cauliflower for some or all of the potato as well. I think I'll try that next time!

This was so tasty and very very thick, I was unsure mixing chicken stock with ground beef but it was great, might cut back on the flour next time as I said super thick. I did use two pounds of beef and cut way back on the potatoes as we do not eat a lot of carbs. My son suggested jalapeño peppers be added next time for some kick. It is a great soup!

The first time I made this soup, I followed the recipe to the letter with excellent results.  The next time I made it, I did add more ground beef.  I also didn't have sour cream on hand so I left it out and didn't miss it at all. 

I served this to friends last night.  I made it earlier in the day and kept it warm in the crock pot, which worked well. It was a definite crowd pleaser.

Followed recipe as stated, doubling so I would have leftovers.  Turned out great... wasn't watery at all like some others have mentioned although I may have been a little heavy on the potatoes I put in.  Reheats great as well!

I thought it was very good. I used more beef. I made a mistake and cut the celery too big. I did use pasta instead of potatoes. I liked the pasta. The seasoning was good. I would have to triple the recipe to serve this to guests. I doubled it and 2 people ate most of it at one sitting.

I too, searched for this recipe after making it several years ago. Its a family hit but misplaced my recipe and my own memory just was NOT cutting it lol. I also use velveeta for creaminess and beef broth instead of chicken. And I often added bacon :)

Added a half a package of bacon (perfect amount) and even had to add an extra cup of stock. Still comes out more than hearty..definitely a winter soup.

Didn't turn out as thick as I would have liked personally but the taste was good.

We really liked this soup. Forgot to add the sour cream at the end. It should be called cheeseburger potato soup, since there are more potatoes in it than burger!

Loved this!!  Had some good cheeseburger soups at restaurants but wanted to try to make some myself.  This recipe was just right.  I used half and half instead of the milk for a richer flavor and also used Velveta instead of the cheddar cheese as it melts better.  It was very tasty and my family loved it.

I just made this soup and it is so good! I made it as written except I chopped the carrots instead of shredding them and I used 8 oz. Velveeta instead of cheddar. Will definitely make again. I may use another cup of broth because the cheese makes it pretty thick.

I thought this was good, but not great.  In defense of the actual recipe, I did use mostly lower-fat versions of many items (Low-fat mild cheddar, 1% milk, ground turkey, etc).   Next time I'll choose a different cheese and I"m sure it will have more flavor.

This was a good recipe! My son loved this soup - he is a teenager.  I added jalapenos at the end as garnish.  He even took it in to school for his German club party and the kids really liked it.

We made this for dinner last night. My whole family liked it, it was hearty, satisfying and tasty. I used some velveeta  with the cheddar because I needed to use it up. Very good main course soup.

My husband really enjoyed this soup. I have a corn chowder recipe with meatballs that uses cheese whiz. I have been trying to find a recipe using real cheese. This fits the bill well and I don't have to make meatballs. The only changes I made were to double the ground beef and I halved the potatoes and used corn for the other half. My husband thought adding some green beans would also be a nice addition. This is not a healthy soup and I will not make it often, but I know it will be a nice comfort food when the need arises.

Very Delicious!  Really liked this soup!  I made no changes to the ingredients of this recipe. All I did was add 1# ground beef and 3 cups cheddar.  I will make this again on a cold Winters Day!  Yummy

I was a little "iffy" about this recipe. Amazingly, it turned great! Followed exactly the way it's written and kids each had 2 bowlfuls! Made it on a cold, blustery day...and bellies were warmed and full.

Definitely a good staple for the cold months.  I put in 1 lb of ground beef to make it meatier, and used hash brown potatoes as others had suggested.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the tee, and there is plenty left over.  I would serve it with a pasta dish, personally, but it is also good alone

As written, pretty bland especially with mild cheddar.  Tried it again with some changes, of course, and much better. For speed followed other reviewers and used frozen onion and O'Brien potatoes plus medium cheddar and a squirt of chunky garlic paste. Still pretty blah, so added a good measure of Montreal Steak seasoning - that did the trick! Also did not heat with sour cream, instead served a dollop of that in the soup bowls.

I added the two cups of cheese, and it still looked a strange gray/brown color and tasted like watery roast beef. I ended up doubling the cheese, and it looked and tasted better.  Next time I will add more onions. Overall a very good place to start and easily adjusted to your tastes. My family didn't like it, but I'm keeping it to take to pot lucks and such.

Excellent soup!  I used stew meat (boiled until tender) instead of hamburger & I thickened mine w/ cornstarch & a little water.  Also, I used beef broth, since that is what I had & just slightly less than 2 cups of cheese for our preference, & a little cayenne pepper.  The sour cream was a nice touch.  We loved it!!!

Love it! Only changes were to use frozen Obrien potatoes and used a third of a stick of Velveeta instead of cheddar. This soup was outstanding. Mashed up some of the potatoes to make thicker. Great fall meal!

Excellent soup.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I used water and added 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of cumin.  I also used 10% fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

Delicious! Used up the Velveeta I had on hand (1 1/2 cups)and put in 1/2 cup of shredded mild cheddar. Added a tiny bit of salt and pepper. Thick, tasty, comforting soup.

Stuck mostly with the recipe & the whole family loved it.  My changes included doubling the amount of ground beef & using about half the potatoes as that was all I had on hand.  I only had a purple onion & it was fine.  Half of the cheese was shredded and the other half was cubed but both were medium cheddar.  This recipe could handle a more robust cheese, but it melted great, leaving just a few "strands" here and there to remind us of the cheeseburger quality.  My daughter wondered why there were carrots in her cheeseburger and my son wanted to know why there weren't jalapenoes in his, but they both loved it as it was.

Delicious!  BUT it is NOT a 20 minute prep time...not even remotely!  It is a 2-3 hour soup for sure, beginning to end. But it's definitely worth it; one of the best soups I've ever tasted and my family of 6 all loved it!

I made this and served it for three guests.  I didn't care for it.  It seemed too rich to me.  My guests like it but no one raved about it.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Made this last night.  It was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as it was written except I omitted the basil.  My mother absolutely hates basil.  I also had some sweet corn left over from the night before & dumped that in as well.  If does make a ton.  Am freezing it for a later date.

I was disappointed in this, probably because of all the fabulous reviews I thought I'd like it better.  I'm not sure about the basil in there, but no pepper or garlic.  I did use velvetta since IMHO, you have to use a ton of cheddar for flavor, and it doesn't melt well.

Not bad.  Be sure to drain the meat before you add the veggies.  I added more meat after reading reviews and also added some bacon grease instead of butter.

Made this for dinner last night and it was delicious.  Used shredded cheddar, about 3 cups of potatoes.  Let out the sour cream, but added it to my own bowl.  Yummy!  Will opt for shortcuts next time - frozen hash browns, add flour to sautéing veggies to save time and fat content.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. The only changes I made were 1) doubled it 2)used shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese 3)used baby carrots and 4) used a couple shakes of garlic powder. I'm having it again tomorrow. I wanted to eat it all  because it tasted so good. But I stopped when I was full. Fantastic!

My husband finally let me cook this recipe for him. After countless excuses of why soup was not a good idea, he tried it and said, "wow, this recipe is a keeper". I followed this recipe but changed the type of cheese. We love in Japan and cheddar is expensive and hard to find. I use cheese that was meant for fondu . It was still really good!

I'm not giving five stars to the recipe because it lacked salt! I did it just as stated and the potatoes did not have much flavor, or the meat because salt is not mentioned anywhere... To make it taste better I added bits of bacon and that saved it... My boyfriend said without the bacon he didn't like it, with bacon much better! So my advise: put some salt in the meat when browning it and put some salt in the broth when cooking the potatoes, or the soup will be very bland even with all the favors it should have!

Oh that's just superb.  Such a thick and tasty soup - a real warming lunch on a cold day.  I'll certainly be making that again, probably very soon as my other half who doesn't like any soup other than Chinese style chicken & sweetcorn loved it!  Good news is, we have enough to take to work tomorrow to warm up for lunch again.
I added a sprinkle of cayenne powder when I added the basil and parsley, just because I like a bit of chili relish with a cheeseburger.

This was a great recipe.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and added a bit of rice for texture and body.  Easy to make but a bit time consuming.  Next time I think I'll make sure to have the veggies pre-chopped to speed things along, especially with a houseful wanting food right now!

This was very good and fairly simple. I think this recipe is a great one to make for crowds because almost everyone likes potatoes and hamburger. It would also be easy to replace the meat with fake ground beef for vegetarians. The only thing I changed was that I cut up the carrots instead of shredding them because it seemed easier.

This is really good and pretty easy to put together.  I also like that it doesn't make a huge batch as there are just two of us.  (This way we don't eat it for a week!)  Husband kept saying, "It's a do-over!"  I did spice it up with a dash of cayenne and some dry mustard.  Really comforting on this cool rainy night.

My husband and I really liked it!  It was very filling.  I used a whole pound of hamburger, and 32 oz. of chicken broth and 1/4 teaspoon more of the basil and parsley.  I really feel it needs 1 pound of hamburger, a half pound wouldn't be enough.  I will definitely make this soup again.

This soup is DELICIOUS!!!!  Don't worry about having too much ground beef.  I ended using about a pound and it didn't matter.  I chopped up my carrots like the celery and onions.  And I used 4 cups of chicken broth just to use up the entire quart.  I also used shredded sharp cheese because that's what I had on hand.   My husband can't get enough of it.  He calls it potato soup.  The more it sits in the refrigerator, the thicker it gets.  So yummy!!!

Good base recipe.  I followed exactly but it was just a bit bland.  Really felt that it needed some diced tomatoes but since my girl doesn't like them I resisted the urge...seasoned with Goya adobe seasoning and black pepper, still not enough so I crumbled a cube of beef boullion into the soup, better.  Don't get me wrong, it is good, but lacks the zip I would expect from a "cheese" soup.

I searched for a gluten free option, but alas, all recipes include flour, for thickening the soup.  Instead of flour, I used a bit of instant mashed potatoes.  It gives the soup a rich hearty broth.

This recipe was great especially during the winter when I keep ingredients for soup on hand i.e celery, carrots and onion.  I've tried the potatoe and ham soup, and I prefer this by far.  My boyfriend thinks it's a keeper and so do I.  Love it.

the end product was pretty good. Not gourmet, but nice on a cold night. I had the flour and butter smooth, but in adding the milk I got tons of lumps and had to strain the liquid before adding to the big pot, which was a little annoying. If anyone was interested, it took 4-5 potatoes to reach 4 cups of cubed. In the future, I'd go with a sharper cheddar.

We really loved this recipe, and made few changes. I used some lighter ingredients and added a pound of lean ground instead of a 1/2, and I also added the seasonings I wanted. It was wonderful! I will definitely be making it again.

Made this soup for dinner tonight and it was excellent. I will definately make this soup again. I might have to try the frozen hashbrown potatoes the next time but other than that I would not change a thing and I usually change something around in a recipe.

We love this recipe! I used to make this as written, but then my husband was diagnosed as a diabetic so I altered it to make it more diabetic friendly.  I omitted the potatoes altogether and at least doubled the vegetables. Also, I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. Very good!

This came out great! Only 4 stars b/c I changed a few things.  I didn't use carrots or celery...I used mushrooms and onions...pureed them.  I used 1/2 beef broth.  I pre boiled the potatoes and mashed them. I used Bacon Cheddar cheese (OMG this made it amazing) along w/ reg. shredded cheddar cheese.  Used fresh herbs and salt and pepper.  I did the milk and flour mixture on the side first..I did't need to add all of it to get the right thickness and I didn't use any sour cream.  Came out amazing!!!!

I had no problem getting the consistency where it needed to be.  You have to remember to let the béchamel (butter, flour & milk) thicken before adding it in to the first mixture. Added about two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce.  Didn't measure the cheese by cups. I added 1 1/2 lbs  sharp cheddar and about a 2 inch slice off a regular log of Velveeta.  Minimized chopping time and bought matchstick carrots and threw the onions and celery in the food processor. Buying southern style hash browns does work very well, I appreciated that suggestion from another reviewer. This recipe doesn't work well with low sodium chicken broth. It needs the salt to bring everything together at the finish line.  I added about 2 teaspoons of salt at the end along with extra basil and parsley. It's a very good creamy soup. My husband, who doesn't like hamburger likes it.

This soup was really good and tasted JUST LIKE a cheeseburger.  Unfortunately my husband didn't think so but did say it was good.  It was REALLY thick and rich however.  You really needed to eat it with some crusty bread and even then you couldn't eat a lot of it.  All in all a great recipe but I don't think I'll be putting this on rotation.

I had to add quite a large amount of spices to this to make it tasty. Perhaps I didn't add enough cheese though. There's definite potential to add spices to your personal tastes here for a 5 star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Not bad. Wasn't as cheesy as I had expected but still decent soup. 
- 
I've changed my rating to loved. The first comment was with a 4 star. Since the first time, I now add a can of cheddar cheese soup, and I get the cheeziness I was looking for, and now I love this soup.

It was OK.  Needed so many extra seasonings in it...worchestershire sauce, season salt, garlic, salt and pepper, hot pepper flakes...

This was amazing!  My family absolutely loved it!  Some changes I made - didn't have celery so I skipped it.  I used Italian seasoning instead of basil and parsley, and I added 2 packets of Sazon seasoning.

I follow the recipe exactly and my family loves this soup. It's very hearty and goes great with a warm, crusty bread.

I did not change any ingredients, but I did roughly triple the recipe, leaving the amount of cheese at about 2 cups, and the butter/flour at 6T/half cup respectively.  Both times I have made this it has turned out fantastic.  It's better with homemade broth vs canned (obviously) and real butter, and I'm sure would be great fully loaded (full amounts of cheese and butter), which I will do for company.

After adding the flour/milk mixture, immediatley after it started to boil I added cheese and transfered to crockpot (I hate that grainy, curtled milk texture) to keep warm.  Added sour cream just a bit before serving.

 Thanks for a recipe that all seven members of my family enjoy!  Oh...a little bacon garnish is nice, too.

I used a full pound of hamburger because otherwise there was not enough meat and too much potato.  I loved that I was able to "sneak' veggies into a soup but overall this soup was just okay.  I used mild cheddar and wished I would have used sharp cheddar just for a little more cheese flavor.  Not sure if I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! Didn't have enough cheddar so added velveeta and left out the sour cream but still tasted awesome.  Oh also added about 1 tsp salt and increased everything a bit so I'd have leftovers. But I'm sure its wonderful without me muddling the recipe :)

We found this very comforting on a cold evening. I had all ingredients on hand but I did add Bacon, jalapenos, and bell peppers.  My 3year old asked for more twice (and normally she eats like a bird).  If I had fresh tomatoes I would have added them to top when served.  I will be making this again (maybe even try it with ground Turkey).

This was really good.  I left out the basil(family preference) added lots more veggies and used sharp cheddar, but kept everything else the same, and it was a hit.  Served with slices of hot beer bread.  Mmmmmmm,  tasty!

I absolutely love this recipe!  Its my favorite soup and I fix it every October around Halloween.  I just made it today and devoured two bowls.  The only thing I did different is I swapped celery for green peppers.  I would have used the celery but my husband doesn't like it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My family really likes this soup, so I've made it a lot. I prefer a thicker soup, so I use a full pound of ground beef, two cups of shredded cheddar cheese and four 14.5oz cans of Swanson Chicken Broth (which cooks down nicely during the boiling/simmering process). There is definitely enough salt from the broth, butter, and cheddar cheese, so I'd avoid adding more.

Good solid soup recipe.  Made as directed with two alterations.   Omitted celery and used goose stock in place of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  

Overall, a decent recipe if a bit too traditionally Yankee bland for my family's taste buds.  Will definitely be playing with the recipe in the future. 

For anyone having trouble with the soup being too thin:  let it cool slightly before serving.   Cheese thickens as it cools, so simply turn the heat down for a few minutes to cool and serve when warm- not piping hot.   

If still too thin at that point, you can try adding a slurry of flour/cornstarch and water -or- simply reduce it down if you have the time.   Next time, add less liquid or more potatoes.     

Again, an average soup recipe that works as a decent meal.

Really great soup. Made a few changes to add a little extra flavour including 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and approximately 6 strips of bacon. I also omitted the butter as other soup recipes I have made did not require it unless making a roux first to thicken.

My family said that this was the best soup I've ever made.  I read the reviews and made one change...instead of broth, I used 3 cups of water and 5 chicken boullion cubes.  It definitely didn't need any salt.  It's a wonderful recipe and I certainly plan on making it again.

I just made this soup last night and it was mmm mmm good!  I did add more vegetables though - the veggies shrink when you cook them with the meat!  Therefore, I doubled the quantity of veggies and the carrots added an almost sweet taste to the soup!  DELICIOUS!!!!  I will be making this again!

I love the recipe!  I serve the meat on the side for my vegetarian daughter.  The vegetables are a great way to get them into our diets. I serve it with fresh fruit and garlic/black bean chips.  It is cold in Michigan and this soup keeps us warm.

My boyfriend had cheeseburger soup at a local restaurant and made me look up the recipe to make the next week. He loved it!  I used the recommendation to use velveeta, we used 12 oz. because he likes it super cheesey!  This week we made it with pepperjack velveeta and I used a dash of oregano, garlic powder, and chili powder in place of basil and parsley and he also loved it!

Yum, I used 1lb of angus beef and about 2 cups diced velvetta cheese, diced frozen hash browns.  Everything else was pretty much as stated in recipe.  My dear husband didn't think it sounded very good but loved it and went back for seconds!  If you love cheese, I don't, I would add more but mine with 2 cups diced velvetta was perfect!  Thanks, will be making again!

The family loves this soup!  I make a few changes such as double the ground beef, add a bit more carrots & add salt/pepper/garlic salt.  I shred my potatoes without rinsing them and skip the flour.   You really can't mess it up!  Makes me hungry for it just thinking about it.

I make this at least every other week during the winter.  Definitely one of the meals we look forward to most and the leftovers never go to waste.

I love this recipe!  The only things that I changed were using 1 pound of beef rather than 1/2 and I used only 1 cup of cheddar cheese but added 1 cup of velveeta cheese.

I use 2 pounds of ground beef and lots of sharp cheddar for a more flavorable dish.  I also use some Velveeta for a smooth, cheesy base.  This does make is more of an orange color, but also more cheesy, which my family prefers

This is my family's new favorite soup! I have made it three times in the past 2 months. I use a pound of ground beef, and I add some salt, but I gave the recipe 5 stars because those are simply my husband's preferences. :) GREAT recipe! A perfect hearty, winter soup!

Very good soup! I increased the hamburg to a lb. I cooked the hamburg and veggies (minus carrots) along with the butter and 1/2 pkg dry onion soup, I increased the broth by one additional cup, I almost doubed the cheese using half velveeta and half cheddar.......oh and I only used one cup of potatoe. I threw in some dry mustand and in the end a little extra milk to get the consistancy that I wanted.

I thought this was excellent. I used extra beef, added the veggies by eye (I like more!), used beef broth and frozen hasbrowns and did not add sour cream. It tasted wonderful and froze great!

Delicious!  I doubled the ground beef (actually used ground round) and broth.  Used chicken and....VEGETABLE broth - it really makes a difference in the flavor.  Also added pepper & garlic powder to browning meat/veggies.  Per other suggestions - used 16oz Velvetta & what the heck...I added 2 cups of shredded cheese as well!  Everyone loved it!  Going into our winter soup rotation.

Wonderful and hearty soup.  So easy to make and it was absolutely delicious.  I used F/F Milk, F/F sour cream and olive oil instead of the butter.  You couldn't even tell the difference.  AWESOME!

I made this for dinner one evening but added some additional ingredients.  I added one can of corn and also a can of stewed tomatoes with green chilies.  Also included some other spices to "spice" it up a little.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I will certainly make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good but it seemed more like a Potato Soup than Cheeseburger Soup. Might just leave out the ground meat next time.

I made quite a few changes with the recipe, but I'm giving it 5 stars because the recipe gave me a good foundation to work with... I did not add carrots or celery. If the aim for this recipe is to taste similar to a cheeseburger then it only makes sense to exclude celery and carrots.  I also used pasta instead of potatoes. I used beef broth instead of chicken broth (with beef in the recipe it only makes sense to me). I can't say how the recipe would taste if I followed it exactly, but the way I made it turned out great!

My family loved this soup.  I did make a few changes though. I left the basil out.  I added 1 tsp. garlic powder, a can of corn, 3 dashes of worshestire souce and a pound of hamb instead of the 1/2 pound of hamb.

YUMMY!!!  Made this for the first time tonight.  Served it in a sourdough bread bowl and my whole family of 5 devoured it!  Luckily I made a double batch.  Can't wait for another bowl tomorrow.  (Can't possibly eat anymore right now!!)

My husband and I loved this soup! It was so easy and I followed someone's recommendation and used half sharp cheese and half medium cheddar and it was SO wonderful!

I love the recipe! It's great, and makes great leftovers.  The only thing I changed, was using Velveeta instead of cheddar cheese, and shredded hash brown style potatoes from the freezer section instead of cutting my own! Will make this again!

This recipe was excellent.  It almost reminded me a little more of a potato soup, but was very good.  I added additional salt and pepper for some seasoning and also a few bacon bits.

Excellent.  I doubled recipe, added can of corn, black pepper, few dashes of cayenne pepper and garlic.  Did not add flour or basil.  I put all ingredients mixed in a crock pot and cooked for 6 hour and it came out perfect.

Very good soup. Did make a few changes, added an extra cup of chicken broth (thought it did not have enough liquid), minced garlic and increased the beef to a pound (still thought it could have used a little more).  Everyone thought it was a good addition to our soup collection.

Made this soup for a cool evening meal. I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth because it only makes sense! We don't have cheddar here in Bolivia, so I grated up a mix of aged gouda and american cheeses. It tasted awesome! Also, no sour cream, so I mixed some white vinegar with some heavy cream and it worked perfectly. Ate it again for leftovers and it made us smile all over again!

Yum!  I used 12 oz of hamburger, chicken stock instead of broth and half and half instead of milk for extra thickness because I was out of sour cream.  Nice and thick and hearty - love it!

This was so delicious! Instead of cheddar cheese, I added Velvetta cubed and simmered it in a crockpot for about 3 hours. Added some sour cream and bacon bits and you have a great dish!

I used the sharp cheddar, substitued heavy cream for sour cream and used 2-14oz cans of low sodium chicken broth.  This soup was delicious!  It did take me longer than 20 minutes for the prep.  Definately worth the 5 stars.

The taste and texture were wonderful and hearty.  However, I cannot imagine anyone being able to prepare all the ingredients in 20 minutes, no matter how experienced.  The whole process took me double the total time quoted.  But, it was worth it!

Good recipe that included a lot of leftovers I needed to finish off in the fridge.  Will definitely be a great leftover. The only change I made was added 1 lb of ground beef since I wanted to use it all.

This was wonderful. The only things I did differently were to add garlic to the ground beef while it was browning, Velvetta for the cheddar cheese and I also crumbled up Bacon and topped each serving with it. The whole family really enjoyed this! Really wish I hadn't put off making it for so long! Will make again.

I brought a double batch to a family function recently for my dish to pass.  It was the hit of the party.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  That in inself tells me it's a keeper!  The best part was it was so simple to make.

Very yummy....we all really liked this one. I cooked my ground beef seperate and drained all of the grease from the meat...then I added my chopped veggies. I also used fat free milk with no problem thickening and sad to say...I totally forgot to add the sour cream!!! There are leftovers...so I will add some to that...but all in all....very tasty and conforting. Kiddos loved it...it was a request per my 11 yr. old...so I tried it. Thanks!

Oh I loved this soup!! I've always made Cheeseburger soup a different way, only using hamburger, velvetta cheese, beef broth, sour cream, and rice...which is also a good recipe, but a completely different taste! I loved this recipe!! I doubled the recipe so we could have lots of left overs and I'm so glad I did b/c this soup tastes a million times better after it has sit for a while! So it just got better and better every day! When we had it for dinner right after I made it, it was a very runny soup, but after a day it turns more creamy! It takes a while to prepare, chopping everything up, but totally worth it!! Thank you so much for sharing!

My whole family LOVES this recipe! I have probably made this close to 20 times now, and I love that it has some veggies in it! We just tried a little crumbled cooked bacon the last time, and it was FABULOUS!

I love this soup! My good friend from college was the first one to introduce me to it, and I've been hooked! The only thing I regret about it is that it isn't fat free, :) cause I'd like to eat the whole pot myself sometimes!

Very good.  My 1 y.o loved it.  Omitted the cheese and used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, and 1 lb lean ground beef to make it healthier.

We love this soup! I, too, used twice the ground beef, and I used Velveeta, since it melts so easily. The first time, I made the thickening, but felt it wasn't necessary, so I haven't been using it lately. I think it's thick enough. It sure warms you on a cold winter's day! It's always a hit at our Super Bowl party!

Made this last night for supper.  My husband loved it and so did I!  I thought the consistency was more like a stew than a soup, which was great because that's our preference anyway.  I only changed one thing which was to use a whole pound of ground beef instead of half.  I will definitely put this in my rotation!

Flavor was really good.  I used Velveeta cheese and it was just a little too much cheese.  Maybe using a different cheese or cutting back would give it the extra star.  Will make again, just with about 1/2 the cheese.

I love this recipe. I tried it for the first time just a few months ago, and it's already become a family favorite. The only thing I do differently is stirring the sour cream in after the soup is ladled into the bowls. It helps the soup to cool off faster, and I can reheat the leftovers to boiling without worrying about it.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made some changes like omitting the carrots and celery.  Added more ground beef and used beef broth added salt and pepper to taste.  Also added onion while browning the meat. I would reccomend browning the meat then draining it, then put it in the pan with the butter.  Also added bacon pieces before the sour cream.  I won a soup cookoff with this soup.  Also tastes sooo much better the next day.

This is a great base recipe. I used a lb of beef. Frozen onions and potatoes. 4 cups of beef broth. Fresh parsley and velvetta cheese. I also added garlic to the beef mixture and then threw it in a crock pot. For more flavor I added cumin and chili powder as well as some bacon bits. Hubby went back for seconds. I froze the leftovers!

I really liked this.  The cheese wasn't overwhelming, the flavor was great.  Really good.  I did use a pound of beef instead of half and I thought it was a good amount.  I think 1/2 would have been too little.  Great recipe.

Good as is but even better with some additional spices. Perfect for a chilly night. Becareful with your cheese. I added mine while the soup was too hot and ended up a little gritty. Not sure if this is a common problem but next time I'll let mine sit off the fire a minute before adding the cheese.

This was delicious!  It really did taste like a cheeseburger.  I omitted the carrots and celery.  I also added an additional three cups of chicken broth, and it was still thick and rich.  I will be making this again!

Love the heartiness of the soup plus the fact I always have everything on hand except maybe the carrots, and that it was quick & easy.  It wasn't bad but...... we felt something was off on the recipe.  I added more cheese (the cheddar as the recipe called & then I added velveeta when you couldn't taste the cheese). I also added two more tators than the recipe called for.   Hubby said it was okay to fix a couple of times a year but not in the rotation so that's why I rated a 3 star.  HOWEVER, the first day we ate it as the recipe called for but the second day we added a can of cheddar cheese soup.  After the cc soup was added, he said yummy, yummy fix it whenever!   Thanks for the recipe.

Enjoyed it very much!  Made a few changes - used 1lb of ground turkey, cut the butter down to save on the fat a bit, used 2% shredded cheese & light sour cream & steamed frozen baby carrots on the side & added to soup at end.  Topped it off with some crumbled whole grain Club crackers.  Definitely will make again!

This soup is very good.  I used one pound ground chicken because I didn't have beef.  I didn't double the remaining ingredients and I forgot to add the sour cream.  Great on a rainy, cold day.

This soup was awesome!  My kids licked their bowls clean, lol.  I did have to make some changes because I didn't have everything for the soup, it was a last minute idea.  I had no celery, so I used 1 can of cream of celery soup and I didn't have any potatoes but I did have a box of scalloped potatoes so I used that instead with the seasoning packet it came with.  I will make this again and again!!  Thanks for posting this soup, my family enjoyed it!!  :)

I've been making a lot of soups lately, but the kids never seem to get too excited about them.  This one was a hit though.  With "Baking Powder Drop Biscuits" on the side, this makes for a nice weeknight meal on a cold winter day.

this was oh so yummy! i was surprised on how little time it took for it to be ready.....even with all the chopping. it for sure doesn't take 50 minutes total if you cut the potatoes in small dime size pieces. to cut down on the calories and fat i substituted beef for ground turkey breast (normal ground turkey is just as bad for you and ground beef....just so you know) as well as light sour cream and 1% milk. i tried to find a reduced fat cheese but had no luck unless i went with something other than cheddar. i also used shredded cheese so i didn't add to the chopping process and used more than two cups (used about four.) so good on a cold winter night, very filling and hearty.

So good! I used a full lb of beef and omitted the celery. I used a cup of cubed velveeta and 2 cups of cheddar. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I think I may use this as a base and then tweak it to my liking, maybe a bit creamier and maybe some bacon.  My boyfriend thought it was delicious as is.

Wow! This is awesome. I used 1 lb beef, no carrot and no celery. I used 16 oz low fat Velveeta for the cheese and low fat sour cream. I used 4 cups of shredded hash browns for the potatoes. The texture was perfect. I crumbled bacon on top. I froze the left overs.

I left out the carrots and celery - I just didn't think that they belonged in a cheeseburger soup. The soup was very good - very rich (sort of a "gravy" consistency). However, I couldn't help thinking that it was "missing" something - maybe some cayenne...or something to just give a little jumpstart?

This is one of the best soups I have ever had! My husband and I both can't get enough. I did read a handful of reviews before I started so I made a few changes. I used 1.25 pounds of ground turkey instead of the beef. I also added in 1/3 of a 4oz can of diced jalapenos and 8 slices of crumbled bacon. This is not going to last very long in our house!! The sour cream is a really great finishing touch.

This was surprisingly good!!!!~ Made it true to recipe..the only change - or addition I made was when my husband said I should sprinkle bacon on top to make it a Bacon Cheeseburger soup....So we added bacon bits because I didn';t have real lbacon.

It really needs some pepper and maybe some garlic, but this was a very nice change from the typical cheese soups out there.  The kids didn't care for it, but my husband and I enjoyed it!

Great recipe - I wish that I had used my food chopper on the veggies to really finely chop them.  The soup was delicious, I used a blend of sharp cheddar and velveeta which worked out perfectly.  What a pleasant surpise and a delicious soup for a cold fall night.  Thanks.

Not bad, a little bland for my tastes.  I would add some garlic, salt, pepper and maybe some red pepper flakes to add some kick, otherwise, good.

Excellent!  I made it exactly as written, except I chopped the carrots. Oh, and I used bacon grease instead of butter (I'm from the south, what do you expect?).  It was perfect for a cool football Saturday lunch.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I only had baby carrots so I tried to slice them thinly.  They didn't get as soft as I'd like.  I also left the potatoes a little big so they took longer than the recipe stated.  Very yummy creamy soup.

This was yummy, except I did not include carrots, celery, basil and parsley - I don't associate these with cheeseburgers.  I did add more potato, since alot of times, cheeseburgers are eaten with fries, or jojo's.  I also did not use chicken broth - I think it's wierd to have chicken broth with beef;  I used water instead.  This was delicious, I love green onions, so I had a bowl of chopped green onions for those who wanted to add to their own bowl.  I will be making this again.  Good with wheat crackers or 100% whole wheat toast.

Easy to make and it turned out great.  I made a few minor changes.  I used velveta cheese instead of shredded cheese and at the end I added a small amount of instant potatoes to thicken the soup.  I chose not to use the sour cream, carrots and celery as well.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

My substitutions.  I used beef broth instead of the chicken.  And, since we had no basil I just used a shake of Mrs. Dash.  It was great for this damp October day.

This soup was pretty good but my kids (2 and 4) didn't really love it and when I asked my husband if this was a repeater recipe he said "I don't think so".  Not sure if I will make it again for all the work it wasn't that great.

A 4.5 for sure.  Great sort of twist on cheddar-potato chowder.  I've tried doing half cheddar/half Mexican Velveeta(that has the peppers in it).  It added a nice texture and just a hint of spicey.  A little more beef would be good if you like a lot of meat, but I like it kind of sparse as called for in recipe.

rave reviews from all that ate this soup (i dont eat beef but it looked great)!I would consider it a stew as it is very thick. I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 pounds hamburger. Glad i did. Serving size would be very small to get 8 from a single recipe. I think i will just eyeball the amounts next time. This is a recipe that really doesnt need measuring of ingredients.

Very good. I added a bit more liquid to make it more soup-like, but it was still very good.

We *loved* this---even my picky stepkids said it was awesome! I subbed corn for the celery, and used a whole pound of ground beef. I ended up having to add more chicken broth as it was too thick. But it tasted delicious! This was perfect for a gray fall day!

I gave it a four because it didn't look very appetizing, but actually tasted very good. I will make it again. I love potato soup and this was a nice change. Mine was WAY too thick, I'm not sure how it was too watery for some people. I had to add liquid to make it less dense. It turned into a casserole type thing.

This warmed us up on a crisp fall night.  My 14 month old snarfed down the meat, potatoes, and carrots. Everyone else enjoyed it.  I didn't use celery, or the sour cream.  I thought it was plenty creamy without.  Didn't have any chicken broth so I used 3 cups of water and 3 bullion cubes. I would easily make this again.

Great soup for a cool fall dinner! I made a few changes...I used a full pound of ground beef and two chopped jalepenos to the meat/veggie mixture. Then, in addition to the chicken broth, I added a can of condensed cream of celery soup and a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup to give a nice creamy consistency without having to add milk. The cheese soup also allowed me to cut the shredded cheddar in half. I didn't add the sour cream, as I am freezing half the batch and will be re-heating the soup for lunches at work. But I am going to serve it with sour cream and extra shredded cheddar. Thanks for a great soup recipe!

It wasn't out of this world but I will definitely make again! You could easily get away with using one lb of meat instead of half.  Also the serving size was much less than 8.  It was more like 4.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving it a 3 because of the soups blandness. I tasted it before adjusting it and it had no flavor. I added to taste: sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, worcestershire sauce. Once I added a lot of those ingredients the soup was great and would be a 4 star rating.

Wonderful, fast, easy recipe. Although I did swapp out the veggies for ones I had on hand and used ground turkey. Instead of diced potatoes I used whole new potatoes. They were small enough I didn't have to dice or peel them saving me a lot of work. The better grocery stores sell them already washed so they are a quick and easy addition to a meal.Next time I would like to try thickening it with potato flakes like a previous reviewer did. I just didn't have any on hand and didn't have time to go to the store. Thank you for a different and tasty recipe that is easily adjusted to different dietary needs and likes.

wow! really, really good! My husband and I really liked this. The only thing I did different was use beef broth instead of chicken,as another reviewer suggested. I didn't have any chicken broth on hand any way. Makes a nice soup with simple ingredients most cooks have on hand. I will make this again for sure! Thanks

I just got done making this soup, and I am not a cheese soup lover, but this one gets a 5*! Easy to make, I even doubled the recipe. I used the chicken broth, and a box of velveeta.I did leave out the celery and carrots though like others did.   I usually make my husband try things like this. I'll make it, but won't eat it! But, this might be the recipe to change that. I tried a teeny spoonful which has lead to a small bowl full. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but lacked something for us.  I used homemade chicken stock combined with organic chicken broth.  My stock is not very salty.  Once I added salt and pepper, this turned out great.  I used 3/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup milk to get an ultra creamy taste.

This soup was a nice change from the usual homemade types of soups. I thought it would be heartier than it was, but I did not follow the exact directions because cheeseburgers seem to me to consist of ground meat, seasonings, cheese, tomatoes, maybe onions, but certainly not celery and why would you add chicken broth to a beefy soup? (I used beef broth.) If I make this again, I'm adding tater tots to it instead of the hash browns others suggested, and possibly sliced flank steak instead of the ground meat (in which case I'll just slow cook it). This recipe, as everyone has made it their own, should be called Burgers and Fries Soup. It's really different, and I offer my kudos to the author of the recipe for inspiring everyone to switch things up!

I followed prior suggestions, doubled the beef and used Velveeta instead of cheddar. Since I used the velveeta I',m not sure the sour cream was necessary since it made it creamier than cheddar would have. All in all a great recipe. I love great base recipes that leave room for additions and this is one of those.

This is one of my favorite childhood recipes, so I was very excited to see it here.  I've made it twice, once using chicken stock and once using beef stock.  I thought it was better with chicken stock because you could taste the other flavors better.  The beef stock tended to disguise the other great flavors, especially the cheese.  But a great recipe!

I made this recipe as is. I like that it is simple, quick, and easy. I rated this a 4 because it tastes good, but it is not wowing me. I feel that this recipe does not taste like a cheese burger. I would have to say that this tastes more like cream ground beef soup.

Love this have made it for alot of dinners/potluck/tailgate. The only thing I have changed is that I use frozen hashbrowns sometimes. This holds well in a crockpot. Special note to Arlene I made this for a friends family that had just lost their father. They loved it I took it by that day and they still are thanking me so thank you for making my friends more comfortable on this day.

The bf and I really liked this. I took advice and added more beef. I also left out the onion and sour cream, we don't care for either. I put fresh diced jalapenos and croutons on top of mine. Will make again for sure.

I have made this soup several times and although I don't like it when people don't follow the recipe, I did make a few changes to suit my family.  Add the velveeta!  Half of a big block of it is about right.  Celery is not right in it and I love celery.  Use a little corn starch/flour to thicken it if it is too thin.  We weren't sure about this recipe at first, but now we love it.

My husband, brother-in-law, and I loved this recipe.  I did add a couple of things.  I small can of mushrooms (we are mushroom fanatics) and the cheese I added a little soft munster and 3 slices of american.  We also crumbled bacon on top, but it was great even without the bacon.  *****+ stars!!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I do think it should be called a stew instead of a soup because of its consistency. Either way it was very good and I stuck to recipe as written! Thank you.

This was very good.  I didn' have any milk and used a can of evaporated milk instead.  I used a mixture of sharp cheddar and white cheddar cheeses. I seasoned with montreal chicken seasoning and italian seasonings because that's what I had.  I also didn't have sour cream.  I was out of everything :)  I don't think I missed the sour cream and it cut down quite a bit on calories and fat.  Thanks for sharing

So, this started out pretty bland.  I fixed it with additional seasonings...salt, pepper, garlic powder.  I read through the reviews, and found the following changes fitting for us...1) used a full lb. of burger instead of 1/2 lb.  2) diced my carrots (small) instead of shredding.  3) Omitted the celery.  4) Used beef broth instead of chicken.  5) Used a bag of potatoes o'brien instead of plain cubed potatoes.  6) Used half cheddar and helf Mexican Velveeta.  I know that's a lot of changes, but the original recipe would have been good without them, just a little bland.  I made these changes, not because I think the recipe NEEDED them, exactly, just because I knew we would like it more WITH the changes.  It would, in my opinion, be a definite 4 star without the changes!  Thanks!

This is amazing! I would make it once a week if it wasn't a heart attack in a bowl. It tastes so good and is a wonderful comfort soup on those cold days. A few changes I made, based on other reviews and availabilities (I'm overseas): I omit the carrots and celery (I'm sure it would be good with it, but I just don't see it in my cheeseburger soup), add jalapeno peppers (minced), shredded cheese (I've tried it with cheddar and gouda since cheddar is hard to come by here - both are terrific) and omit the sour cream (trying to make it a little healthier). It is fantastic and I'll be making it again and again. It's usually gone within a day (there is only my husband and me)...my husband will even have it for breakfast! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good soup. It wasn't my favorite, it seemed to be lacking something...it just tasted okay, not outstanding. (I want my food to be sensational, not just okay:)

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe and left out celery.  I also made these changes simply for convenience: I had a pound of ground beef browned already so I threw it in a crock pot with 2 tablespoons dried onion, the basil, parsley, and butter.  On the stove I boiled the potatoes and carrots in the chicken broth for about ten minutes and then poured in crock pot.  I cooked on high for about an hour and then poured the milk mixture (from the stove) in stirring with a wisk.  I cooked another 30 minutes then added the cheese and sour cream at the same time.  Stirred every 5-10 minutes for another half hour or so and then served.  I was making homemade dinner rolls and this was much easier than having to watch several pots on the stove!

I thought this soup was pretty good, but it had a distinct taste that wasn't my favorite.  I decided to add in a little bit of cream cheese at the end which helped a little.  I probably won't make it again only because the flavor wasn't for me.

We really liked this soup, and made a double batch almost as it was written, except we used double the ground beef. We also added spices per our personal taste, including (per batch): 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp fresh ground pepper, and 1/2 tsp mixed steakhouse seasoning.  I added the spices at the end, once I tasted the soup, but next time I'll saute a couple of garlic cloves with the meet, and add the seasonings.  I definitely think this soup is best with fresh ingredients (red potatoes cubed with the skin on, and shredded sharp cheddar).  Thanks!

Excellent recipe..a "keeper"!  I used what I had on hand..margarine instead of butter.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth ( closer to 4 cups).  Substituted shredded fiesta/taco flavored cheddar cheese ( has a mixture of monterey jack with cheaddar and some seasonings).  Also added some salt/course ground pepper/ and some white pepper to taste.
Yum.   It made 4 bowls.  Was even better left over the next day!

My family really enjoyed this soup.  I did change the recipe slightly--I added 3/4 cup of chopped broccoli, and 1 tsp of garlic powder, and black pepper.  It's even better the next day.

As written I thought this was bland. I added quite a bit of garlic (fresh & granulated) & pepper. I also thought frying the ground beef and veggies in butter was not neccessary since gb is so greasy so I left it out. Used a mix of shredded cheddar & a little bit of leftover Rotel dip from the Cowboy Game - Go Cowboys! Skipped the sour cream - trying to watch a few calories. I could also taste the flour so I might skip that step next time & see how it turns out. Hubby absolutely thought is was delish! He would have rated it a 5. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe, the only change I made was I used velvetta cheese.  I will make it again, as we enjoyed it.  Easy to make, and it hits the spot on a cold winter night.

Great cheesy soup!  I have only made this one time so far, but I believe the next time I make it I will use half Velveeta and half cheddar for a more creamy consistency.  Also, the cheddar tends to separate from the other ingredients on the following days when reheated in the microwave, so I believe different cheese added in like this will help on this issue as well.  Great taste overall, perfect for cold days!

Delicious!  It was thick and creamy, very hearty and would be great on a cold night.  The only thing I will do different the next time is add more ground meat, you could barely taste it.

I left out the celery because I don't like it.  I also used venison instead of beef.  I thought it lacked a little flavor so I added some garlic salt and pepper after I had tasted it.  Overall, it's a good recipe and I plan to make it the next time we have soup & sandwiches at church.

This is a revised review....originally I gave this 2 stars because I found it somewhat greasy which just made the whole texture/consistency kind of unappealing.  It wasn't creamy at all.  The cheesey mixture just sat in a pool of grease that wouldn't mix in with the other liquid no matter how much I stirred.  In all fairness....today is day 2.  I just went to have some and had to skim the top of all of the chicken fat that had congealed.  After I did that, I heated it up and it was 1000% better.  Apparently in my attempt to be a "real" cook (which obviously does not come naturally) I used actual chicken stock (as opposed to a can - my norm).  Stick with the canned stock, there's too much fat in the real deal.

Very creamy and nice comfort food taste.  It was missing some taste at the end, so will work on what I want to add next time.  Will definitely make again.

I think this is the best potato soup!  I disagree with the review where the person did not like the hamburger.  THat is what makes it even better.  I double the beef and the broth, and like the recipe even more.

What a yummy, creamy soup!  I made this last night during our "holiday blizzard" and it was the perfect comfort food.  I added 1/2 a bag of frozen veggies and used turkey instead of hamburger, but otherwise made as written.  It's great!

Delicious! I substituted corn for the celery and used Asiago cheese instead of the cheddar. I had to season it a little more at the end with salt and pepper- then the soup tasted great.

I LOVED this!  The rest of my family only gave it 3 maybe 4 stars.....they aren't crazy about cream soups.  I did not saute the veggies and beef in butter....just browned my ground round (1 lb) and drained it before adding ALL of the veggies in with the broth.  I added salt, pepper, and minced garlic,(I was out of basil) and I also used just a tad extra flour in the roux.  Stirred in finely shredded mild cheddar and sour cream....YUM!  This was thick and rich....great comfort food!   Will make again for myself and friends....probably 1/2 batch though, since it wasn't a hit with my picky family.  Thanks for the recipe :)

It is a lot of work with cutting, chopping and shredding, but it is worth the work.  I have had this recipe for a while now, and it is the meal that I bring everybody when they have had a baby!  It is also a terrific soup to eat around the campfire...mmmmmm!  I cook my beef seperately and set aside, then cook the veges and then add back together in the broth.  Yummy!

This was great!  I skipped the basil because my family doesn't care for it and used noodles instead of potatoes.  I also added a little garlic.  My family loved it.  We'll definitely make this again.

ALL Time family favorite for winter comfort food.  I add extra cheese as a family preference.  My 2 children LOVE this and I have yet to make it and someone not like it. Picky eaters, kids who don't like veggies, people who hate onion, all agree this is THE soup for winter.  I have tried useing frozen hashbrowns but it didn't taste the same.  Also don't use velvetta for this soup.

Pretty good.  I used 1 pound of burger and wished I would've added more veggies.  A bit too much liquid but overall not a bad soup.  Will make again.

I thought this soup was amazing.  Much better than I thought it would be.  I did use a pound of hamburger and about a cup on all the veggies.  I also used sharp cheddar.  The whole family was pleasantly surprised.  This will definitely be a staple this winter in our house.

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all of the great reviews. I made it exactly as it is written and no one in my family liked it very much. It was edible but nothing special for us. I thought it was bland and not very attractive.

This was really good. I did use beef broth instead. Similar to beef stew. My husband does not like cheese, and this soup is good w/o out it too. Will make again.

I was hesitant to make this, but I am so glad I did!  I did add more ground beef, garlic, some mushrooms I needed to use up, and shredded (instead of cubed) the cheese. Both my husband and I thought it was delicious! Very rich.

I made this soup exactly to recipe, with the exception of using shreaded cheese.  It turned out beautifully and was super easy.  No need to mirco the veggies.  The flavor and consistency are good and it's a filling meal.

This is as good as it gets!  My picky 18 mo. old ate 2 full bowls!  The only changes I made:  Used ground sirloin (didn't even have to drain fat), did not use butter to saute meat and veggies (no need), used Velveeta cheese, and used 1 can regular chicken broth with some of a can of roasted garlic seasoned chicken broth without the garlic pieces to make up the rest of the 3 cups.  My combined "melted butter and flour then add milk" was very lumpy, so I heated it a little in the microwave to help make smooth.  This tasted like it should have come from an upscale restaurant.

My Family and extended Family, loved this recipe.  I didn't have any celery so I didn't put that in, and I didn't have carrots, so I used part of a can of carrots that I cut up really small and added after the potatoes.  It turned out delicious.

i liked this soup. i used closer to a pound of ground beef and seasoned it really well while i was browning it. it was more like a potato soup, which i am not so crazy about, but the extras made it much better. i used velveeta in the soup and topped with shredded sharp cheddar.

Yummmmmmy!  Followed previous reviewers and used 1 lb. ground beef.  Also, added 1/4 tsp. salt and a pinch of black pepper.  Would recommend using sharp cheddar for maxium cheese taste. Hubby liked it as well as my 2 & 1/2 yr. old and 15 month old.  Will make again!

I used this recipe as a base for my own creation. I substituted beef for ground turkey, potatoes for macaroni, and since I didn't have any broth i used water and powdered cheese from Kraft mac and cheese. I also used green peppers instead of carrots. Either way it's delicious!!

This soup is fantastic!!!  Even my husband loved it and he is not a huge soup fan.  I used 1 lb of hamburger instead of 1/2 to make it a little more filling, and a little less onion.  Definately a soup you can make for a meal.  Great with a little homemade bread!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I'm the big soup eater at my house but this disappeared in a flash.  When I went back for leftovers, there were none.

My husband and I enjoyed this hearty soup. It was unique and had a good flavor and texture to it.  I think it is also something kids would enjoy eating too.

I've made this recipe twice and it is excellent!  Try using elbow macaroni in place of the potatoes.  Fantastic.

This is a great recipe! I work at my sister-in-laws restaurant,  I made this recipe
there and it was a great hit.  We have customers coming back asking when
were making it again. They loved it.

This is an awesome soup!  Leftovers become more like a cheesy stew.  Both my husband and I loved it.  I also added shredded zucchini and my picky husband was never the wiser!
