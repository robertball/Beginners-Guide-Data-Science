This potato chip chicken recipe was absolutely delicious. I did read a few reviews before trying out the recipe and made the following changes: adding garlic powder to the crumb mixture and adding Parmesan cheese to the mayo before spreading on the chicken.  I did not have paprika or onion powder, but I substituted the parsley for basil and it still tasted absolutely amazing. I baked the chicken at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes, turning over at 15 minutes to get a nice even crisp. A+!

Used BBQ chips.  Didn't bake in microwave, used oven 400 or 25 minutes and used drumsticks.  Kids loved it.

This was pretty good, and fast. I had to modify it a bit because I only had about half a cup of the crushed potato chips, so I filled in the rest with dry bread crumbs. I also left out the salt. The chicken was moist. Will try it again using the whole cup of chips.

I baked per other reviewers' suggestion, rather than using microwave.  Smelled divine.  I loved and the family liked.  I really needed more coating than what called for in recipe. (I also added parmesan to mayo as suggested, and garlic to coating)

It was delicious! My entire family loved it! I did add parmesan cheese to the mayo before dipping the chicken in it, and I also fried it in a pan with a small amount of butter (my microwave isnt big enough). Will definately make again!

Loved the flavors of this recipe and I was shocked by the cooking method, but tried it anyway.  Kids and hubby all liked this.  The kids LOVED helping to crush the chips.  I added a little garlic powder and onion powder to the mayo and added garlic powder and season salt to the ship mixture.  VERY TASTY.  Also cooked this @ 375 for 40 minutes in the oven - slightly crispier and super delicious.

definitely a keeper. try using flavored potato chips instead of regular( i used the lays BBQ). i also added in garlic powder.  i didnt have paprika, but it still turned out good! i also made it in the oven- 400*F for about 25 minutes (it was with an electric oven).  Real quick and easy, especially for college students that feel like experimenting; which is how this turned out!

I absolutely loved this recipe, as did my entire family!  It had such a great flavor and the chicken was so moist.  I made this exactly as written with the exception a some added garlic powder.  Definitely a keeper!!

5.28.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/118526/potato-chip-chicken/ ... I doubled this recipe, but didn't double the paprika.  'Turns out maybe the onion powder shouldn't have been doubled - or just omitted.  That flavor doesn't "fit" ovenfried chicken, in my book.  :D   Years ago, I made a recipe similar that used Ruffles brand chips & it was very good.  This was similar, but notsogood.  I'll continue to look for the "good" one & maybe even post it here.  :)  Oh, I used melted butter brushed on instead of mayo........1/14/13: Found it! Combine 1 1/2c crushed chips, 1t salt, 1/4t pepper, dash paprika.  Combine 2 slightly beaten eggs & 1/4c milk. Dip 2-3# fryer pieces in egg mixture then chip mixture. Melt 1/4c butter in pan.  Place chicken in 325 oven 45 minutes. This is from Ruffles chips.

This was a great switch up from the usual baked chicken.  I am keeping this recipe in the dinner rotation for sure.  I did not have fresh parsley so I just used 1 tsp. of dried and minced dried onion since I can't seem to find onion powder anywhere lately.  I also baked it in the oven.  I look forward to trying BBQ chips in the future, adding parmesean cheese and working with the seasonings.  UPDATE:  Tried with BBQ potato chips and not as good (just okay).

I am giving this 5 stars because it was very good AND very easy.  For the ease of preparation, it's a very good little recipe!  I am searching for gluten-free recipes (and also where the ingredients are readily available), so this was great for that.  I baked it, too, as others suggested.  It's strange but I didn't find it greasy at all.  I thought it was crunchy and delicious.  I definitelly will make this again.

I baked this per reviews. I thought it was flavorful but really greasy. So greasy that I wouldnt make it again. I served it with steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes and gravy.

It was ok. The chip crust didn't go over well in my house. Baked the chicken like some other reviews said, chicken was very juicy and tender.

We really enjoyed this delicious recipe. I increased the recipe by half and used 3 boneless skinless chicken breast halves which I butterflyed into 10 pieces (we don't like thick chicken!) and the amount worked terrificly. My husband couldn't stop raving about this chicken. Thanks for sharing!!!!

My family liked this recipe.  I used sour cream and onion flavored potato chips and added parmesan cheese to the mayo.  I will be making this again:)

This was very tasty.  I followed the advice of others and added parmesan to the mayo and garlic powder to the crumb mixture.  I also baked it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes total, turning it over halfway through to cook both sides.  Mine did not turn out crispy, but it was tasty anyway.

Used Jalepeno Kettle chips and it was really tasty.  I baked it in the oven so that's the 4 stars reason.  Didn't add the seasoning since the chips had plenty, but did add a few tbls. of seasoned bread crumbs.  Baked as recommended by others at 400F for 25 minutes.

This is a great way to use up those chip crumbs that nobody will eat.  Even my pickiest eater loved this recipe.  I baked mine in the oven at 400 degrees like another reviewer suggested.  I too added Parmesan cheese to the mayo.  I used barbecue chips but could see this working with any flavor.  I added garlic powder to the chip mix.  This will become a regular recipe for us!!!
