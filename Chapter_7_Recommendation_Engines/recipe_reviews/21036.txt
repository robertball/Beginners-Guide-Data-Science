While I like these ingredients others may wish to substitute a meat spread for the liverwurst.

Thanks for the recipe(TFTR)

The recipe is basically good, but needs to be "punched up" a bit.  We added 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard, a dash of onion powder, and 2 teaspoons of Tabasco.  A bit of sea salt and fresh ground pepper (to taste) is good too.  A little mayonnaise on the tortilla helped it spread more evenly.
We garnished each bite sized piece with a pearl onion on a toothpick.

I love all of the ingredients in this recipe, but not in the proportions given.   First it was very bland.   You can only taste the liverwurst and none of the crab meat.   Second, there isn't nearly enough filling per tortilla.   It's about 1/8 cup per 10 inch tortilla,  maybe less.  Third, it needs other flavors and textures rather than just smoothed mush.   The idea of the recipe is unique and I think it could be good with some major tweaking.
