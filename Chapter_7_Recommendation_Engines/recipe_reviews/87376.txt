The pie crust should be baked on the outside of the pan and after baking, place another pan over it and turn right side up. Gently lift the origianl pan off the crust and let cool. The crust will not shrink and will cover the pan. This was changed. Also chill before rolling out.

Thank You!!!!  I'm chef for the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth and made this (25 of them) and a couple of other desserts for a retirement celebration.  They absolutely LOVED it!!!  And, if it pleases nuns (possibly the worlds harshest critics), you know it's very good!  Thank you!

This was delicious! The sauce is so summery and refreshing. I could practically drink it with a straw!! I did use a refrigerated pie crust but that didn't cause any problems. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was very soupy and didn't sit up like I expect a pie to do. But it is 5 stars for flavor.
