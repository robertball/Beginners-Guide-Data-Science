Yum. Mashed a banana first then added all the ingredients although subbed some Pineapple Juice for the some of the vodka. Tasty, but didn't think it was very strong so I stirred in more coconut rum. Served at party in 2 ounce plastic condiment cups (similar to jello shot cups) and with a plastic spoon. Quite  thick, prob because of the banana.

These were very good - and very strong!  They were definitely a hit with all who tried them.  I added pieces of pineapple and maraschino cherries to the top for fun.
I had a bit left over, and served it with Nilla Wafers the next night - it was a hit again!

Made it for a work party, it was well loved! Made just as written, put in disposable condiment cups. People asked for the recipe! Super easy! Yum! Will be making again! Thank you!
