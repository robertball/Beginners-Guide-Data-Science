I deviated from the recipe a little and boy was this good!  I prepared this in more of a stir fry fashion, using beef tenderloin that I cut into strips and marinaded in the fajita seasoning and a little vegetable oil. I sauteed the peppers and onions first, using a pretty and colorful blend of green, red, orange and yellow.  I then stir fried the beef tenderloin strips, deglazed the pan with a little water,and added the pepper mixture back in. At the last I added some chopped, fresh cilantro (sure loved that contribution of flavor!) and skipped the lime juice. I served this over a bed of rice. This was quick, easy and delicious--I had dinner on the table in about 20 minutes.  I confess I don't think I would have liked this prepared as directed--it would have taken much longer, and I don't care for the idea of cooking a rib eye steak for 30 minutes to an hour.  Stew meat, maybe--ribeye, not. Prepare this quickly by sauteeing a good cut of meat and there's no way you could be disappointed.

What a disasterous way to ruin a good ribeye.  IF I make this again it will be with a cheaper cut of meat.

Delicious! I followed the recipe strictly as I do with any first-try, and it's a winner. Those who cry "dry" must have either cooked this on too high heat or had a bad cut of meat: the steak was incredibly tender and juicy. Very easy, too - while it simmered (I let it simmer 1 hour), I was able to get other things done and clean up the kitchen too!

My husband & I both agreed that we prefer our steak grilled.  This did have a good taste but next time I would grill the steaks and saute the vegetables seperately.

Excellent recipe!!
Instead of searing the steaks in a pan, I popped them on the gas grill on high for about 3 or 4 minutes for each side. Then followed the rest of the instructions.
Absolutely delicious!!!

This recipe ruined the ribeye!  The veggies were good.  Next time I would just cook the veggies as described and grill chicken to make fajitas!

Everything was good with this recipe until I added the fajita seasoning.  It made a pefectly good steak taste like a taco.

We loved it!  It was so tender and juicy.  I used the whole package of fajita seasoning.  After sprinkling on both sides of steaks, I placed the steaks in a baking dish, covered with foil and put in the oven on 250Â° for about 2 to 3 hours.  We will be having in again this week.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor. I used an iron skillet and cooked very slow for 1 hour. Also, added sliced fresh mushrooms.

I was pretty disappointed with this, I was hoping that some of the negative reviews were exaggerations and just picky people, but I wish I would have grilled the steak and the lime was a little overpowering. Won't be making it again.

This recipe was FABULOUS! My husband can be a bit picky about new things, but loved it! VERY JUICY! I used all of the fajita spice packet. I also kept a lid on the entire time I cooked it (about 1.5 hrs.) and it was YUMMY! Definitely a keeper!

This was wonderful and richly flavored. I was worried that the steaks might dry out, but the natural juices from the meat, peppers and onions made the meat come out tender and moist. I cooked it for 40 minutes. This is now a regular on our family menu.

Alright- the taste was good...however cooking a beautiful ribeye this way essentially turns this wonderfully flavored steak into potroast....if your going to use this recipe use a chuck roast.

Yum, I have made this many times since I discovered it.  The only thing I do differently is that I rub/pat the fajita seasoning onto the steaks before and after  searing and then sprinkle over the vegetables before squeezing the lime over the pan.  Good stuff!!

Just average -- probably won't fix again.  The flavor was good, but the steak wasn't tender.  I used a good cut of ribeye.   If I do fix this again, I'll use chicken -- which should taste great!

I tried this recipe strictly as published. It was really good. I like a grilled steak, too, but I'm in a dorm room right now and this was a very good substitute. I'm a big fan and I'll definitely try it again.

My husband who loves his grilled steaks said I could ruin his steaks like this anytime!  I did not measure the seasoning or the lime juice.  I followed the directions except I did as another suggested and baked the dish at 200 degrees for two hours but increased it to 350 while baking my biscuits.  I am not a steak eater at all but enjoyed this for a change.

I altered nothing  and did it in the crock pot and served over rice. It was fabulous and the kids said it  needs to go on our make this again soon list. I was in a hurry and tossed in bell and sweet red peppers whole. They came apart easily after it was done. 8 hrs on low

I made this recipe pretty much step by step (I added mushrooms to the veggies as the only change)and my husband and I both agreed that it was a wonderfully different way to have steak.  Ours wasn't dry at all, and I will definitely make this again!  Since it used fajita mix, we served it with spanish rice - delicious!!

This was GREAT. If you look under another recipe on here under baked mushroom and make both of them the way there instructed. You will have the BEST fajita's you've had in a long time.

Good for something different.  Husband didn't care for it cause he likes well done meat.

This was just "eh" in my house. I made it in the slow cooker, on low for 3 hours. Nothing special, probably won't make again.

Made it, a waste of good steak. Maybe with a cheap cut of meat it would be, just O.K.

Although the flavor is "unique" it really dries a great piece of meat!

I have followed this recipe for years.  I can cut the steak into small pieces and cook a large pan of them. I make extra peppers and onions which means I have either enough for company or to freeze the extras. I cook it on low and for hours which makes it easy for those with dentures.  It freezes very well and is a quick and simple meal for those rushed dinners.  It is simple and easy and my guy loves it.

I don't like what the cooking method did to the texture of the ribeye.

Very good. Great over rice. I made everything in the oven. I cooked it covered in foil at 350 for an hour. Easy and quick meal

I used New York steak, because it was on sale.  Great start to the recipe; I added my own spices; cumin, chili powder, coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper and added about a cup of salsa in the simmering stage.  I never follow recipes directly -- this was a winner. I recommend simmering as long as possible - you might want to cook the meat in the crock pot with spices, lime juice and salsa and then saute the onions, peppers and garlic later.  Then a pot roast could be used and have excellent results.
