As with most recipes on this site I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1 cup of frozen broccoli and 1 cup chopped brussels(both cooked) as well as some Season All, Garlic Powder, and  Old Bay (for seafood)spices. I also uncovered the dish and added a cup of shredded Cheddar cheese the last 5 minutes. (this made the noodles crunchy on the top which I like) 

The end result was WONDERFUL! It was very creamy and filling. I will definitely add this one to my recipe box. Thanks!

Fantastic!  I'm a big fan of tuna noodle casserole, so I was curious to try a recipe that did not have condensed soup as its base.  I was not disappointed!  I used light sour cream and light mayo to make it healthier.  I also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder (yum!) and some shredded cheddar cheese on top (added the last 5 minutes of baking).  I loved the red pepper.  If you are a tuna noodle lover and like creamy warm goodness, then try this recipe!

"It was good.  I liked it.  4 stars.  No, I'm not getting into this( this being giving a detailed rating)"  I made this for Mr. LTH and I won't touch tuna noodle casserole with a ten foot pole, so that's the best I could get out of him for his rating.  (He did, at least, take a photo for me)  I crushed potato chips for topping and added shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture.  TY for making his night!

This is a very good recipe.  One can add to it too, like seasonings.  Along with the salt and pepper, I added Emeril's Essence.  I also use chicken in place of tuna.  Very good and easily.

Out of this world! My husband won't eat any "cream of.." soups but wanted me to make a tuna casserole.  I didn't think I'd be able to find one that didn't use soup as a base, but when I saw this, I decided to give it a try.  I did not have any onions, so I used some mushrooms instead. I also added some garlic powder with the other ingredients, and some shredded cheddar cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking.  This just LOOKED delicious in the oven and I couldn't wait to try it.  It was soo good.  Everyone had seconds, and my husband even had thirds! Definitely will make again!

Such a delicious casserole, my picky kids gobbled it up! I added extra shredded cheddar on the top the last few minutes.

This was very good.  Best part is that you can use all your leftover veggies to put this dish together.  I sauteed mushrooms, onions, red bell pepper, celery together and added spices as per preference (garlic powder, onion powder, salt/pepper, chili powder, etc.)  then combined these with the cooked noodles and followed the rest of the recipe.  I also crushed some saltine crackers on the top and added shreddeded chedder to it.

This has become my standard tuna casserole recipe. I increase the salt to 1/2 tsp, and use large shells instead of small. They really capture the tangy tuna filling. I also like to top this casserole with a handful of shredded cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes of baking. Yum!

I loved this casserole!  I didn't have enough sour cream so I used half a cup plus a cup of plain yogurt, which lightened it up, and added some grated cheddar.  Also I didn't have the broccoli so I substituted chopped brussel sprouts (cooked), and it was very yummy!  Will make again.

We really enjoyed this!  Per reviews I seasoned a smidge (garlic and onion powder & salt/pepper) more!  I also used 2 cans of tuna.  I didn't have broccoli so I used canned peas!  Will def make again!

This was nice and colourful, and a great way to fancy up a can of tuna. My whole family ate it without any complaints. I did not have green onions so I subbed celery.

Great way to get some broccoli into a picky toddler!  Excellent recipe that will be going into rotation at our house.  I used 1 c lowfat plain yogurt and 1/2 c sour cream and topped with grated cheddar when serving.  Delicious.

VERY GOOD!  Even my picky eater liked it.  I made a little less since our four are not real big eaters.  I topped it panko bread crumbs for a little crunch.

I tried this because I was looking for a non-condensed soup tuna casserole recipe. I just didn't like it. The creamy texture of the sauce was nice but I didn't like the flavor at all, it was very tangy. Husband said it tasted like ranch dressing, which is NOT a compliment in my house. Won't make again.

I did not like the sour cream and mayo combo. I guess I will stick with the cream sauce from scratch w/flour...

Yummy! I hate when people change the recipe and write a review but we added cyanne pepper, minced garlic and used broccoli. I topped the casserole with leftover french onion and then added shredded cheese for the last 5 minutes of baking time. Also I used 2 cans of tuna, regular mustard and only had 3 1/2 cups of cooked pasta. lol. delicious!

Made recipe as is and wasn't creamy enough for me, next time I'll add spinach for more moisture, and a little more mayo or sour cream, and 1/4 cup heavy cream or maybe 1/2 cup of milk... just ideas. Also added 2 stalks of celery. For pasta, I used cooked egg noodles (after making tuna casseroles that have called for egg noodles before, I can't be led astray! :-P) but I cannot wait to try this recipe with cooked rice! Also, I topped this off with shredded colby-jack cheese last 10 mins of baking. Thanks for such a good hot tuna recipe!

This is a fantastic tasting tuna noodle casserole.  I did make changes based on the picky people I cook for...left out the broccoli florets and sweet red pepper (served the broccoli on the side ...I think it would be even better with these added to the casserole) and I added a bit of shredded cheddar and a hand full of crushed up potato chips on top for a crunch.  Love that it has no icky condensed soups added.  This is my forever go to recipe for tuna noodle casserole now!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this! My new favorite tuna casserole, glad I have this recipe going into Lent! Used 1/2 c of plain yogurt and 1 c of sour cream. Used egg noodles instead of pasta shells. Used 3/4 T. minced onion as a timesaver. Wish I would have had sweet red pepper but didn't, still yummy without it.

I made this exactly as written (except for putting cheese one top), and my family didn't really care for it.  It seemed lacking in flavor.

This was so good!  It was nice to find a recipe that didn't call for cream-of-something soup (nice to have the option).  I used miracle whip instead of mayo (personal preference) and substituted frozen peas for broccoli (or else hubby wouldn't have touched it) but other than that I made it as written.  We both loved it!  A yummy, creamy comfort food.  Will definitely be making again, and soon.  Thank you, Ellen, for this excellent recipe!

You can't mess this recipe up.  My entire family loved this a lot.  I took the advice of many of the reviews and tweeked it a bit.  I added more broccoli, and put sharp cheddar cheese on top as well as adding extra dijon, garlic powder and  sour cream to the sauce.  I'm making it tonight for dinner ~  mmmmmmm.....

The family really liked this recipe.  I made it as written but had to leave out the red pepper and green onion.  Didn't have them.  I used bow tie pasta and to make up for the missing green onions, I sprinkled in a little onion powder.  Next time, I will also pre-cook the broccoli a bit so it's not so crunchy.

This was so-so for us. I didn't really like the broccoli in this and I like broccoli, it just didn't taste right in this dish. It was kind of bland too and I even added other seasonings. Thanks for sharing though, I always like to try new recipes!

Very nice change from the cream of mushroom version. Didn't have the red pepper or green onions so I just used some diced onion. Also added a 1/4 tsp garlic, though I don't know if it mattered. It was really tasty comfort food.

It turned out great for people who like mayonnaise in their casserole. I learned by making this recipe that I am one who does not. ;)

Didn't have much time, so skipped several steps, yet it tasted great!
I used two cans tuna but skipped broccoli, red pepper and green onions.
While pasta cooked, I mixed first seven ingredients in Pyrex 2 qt baking dish. Used garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. 
After adding cooked pasta and stirring, I added enough shredded cheese to cover the top. Placed the whole thing in the microwave for three minutes and served.
My family LOVED this dish. From cupboard to table took less than 30 minutes.
Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

Mmm! Tuna casserole for grown ups!!  I loved the creamy sauce and the red pepper in it.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 tsp. garlic salt and 1 tsp. old bay seasoning.  We also had left over fresh cilantro, so I added it too.  The end result exceeded my expectations!

this was a great recipe for me to model my casserole after.  just made a few modifications:  i used creole mustard instead of dijon and i added paprika, curry powder, some minced sauteed garlic and roasted green bell pepper i had from another recipe.  i enjoyed this quite a lot.

Loved this!  I didn't add vegetables to it and didn't have milk to add either. So I added a little half & half and water, garlic powder and some american cheese.
Love that it doesn't have a "cream of..." soup in it. Thanks!

Best tuna casserole ever!  Didn't think swapping out the condensed soup would make such a difference.  It did.  Added leftover roasted brussel sprouts, mushrooms and chopped kale.  Did without the cheddar on top and it was great!

LOVED IT! I used one small can of tuna, doubled the broccoli and added white onion as I had no green onions also added shredded cheddar cheese into and on top at the end to crisp up. My husband  totally dislikes  tuna cassarole.  He ate two servings and said it was awesome!

I used whole wheat egg noodles, and I did NOT cook them first - they would have been really mushy! I substituted the red pepper with fresh, sliced mushrooms and the broccoli with frozen peas (the steamable kind, they have a nice texture). I added a little Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder and dill. I cooked the casserole for 40 minutes with foil over it, and then I sprinkled a generous amount of sharp cheddar on top. I let it cook uncovered for about 7 minutes. I also want to point out that this seemed dry to me, so next time I plan to cut the sour cream and add more milk.

Tuna Noodle Casserole = comfort food, and this recipe did not disappoint.  Cheesey, creamy, full of flavour, not to mention easy to make.  I did make some minor modifications based on other reviews.  I used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of mayo, and rotini pasta because that is what I had on hand. otherwise everything stayed the same.  Will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks, Ellen!

i really enjoyed this!  to keep hubby happy i actually used canned chicken instead of tuna.  also i used light sour cream and light mayo and still ended up with a creamy sauce, you couldn't tell it was made with lower fat ingredients!  yummy and kid friendly too!

Tuna Noodle Supreme Haiku: "I 'lightened' mine up. Loved its lack of cream-of soups. Also made ahead." I prepared this a day ahead (I try to make several dinners on Sun. afternoon to ease into the work-week w/ minimal extra work) and did as the recipe submitter mentioned in her description about swapping lower fat ingredients, so I used Duke's Light Mayo, along w/ light sour cream. (I can't bring myself to use the fat-free versions as they really are totally tasteless.) I sprinkled cheddar and panko crumbs on top of half of the casserole b4 baking (to de-lighten it lol for my husband and daughter), and I ended up liking the "lighter" side better, but used a couple splashes of hot sauce. Very good, and I love how seashell pasta's little noodle crevices absorb all the tasty tuna creaminess.

Very good! Made this exactly to the recipe, and turned out delicious. I also uncovered for the last 5 mins of baking to get the top golden brown, will probably add some potato chip crumbles to the top next time.

Good; I changed the vegetables to suit my family's picky eaters.  I used onion powder, green beans, olives and celery... They still picked them out!  It was a nice comforting dish; hubby said it needed to be a little creamier, so next time I'll add less sour cream and more mayonnaise!

excellent dish. I used all low fat substitutions and I didn't have red pepper so I used green instead. I also used 1 and 3/4 of a can of tuna vs just one can. I added sharp shredded cheddar cheese to the top during last 15 minutes which added great flavor and texture. Next time I'll try roasted red peppers instead of fresh red pepper. YUM! everyone loved it!

My husband stuck his tongue out when I told him that delicious smelling casserole in the oven was tuna-noodle. He wasn't even gonna try it. Once he had a bite, he wouldn't stop eating it and my kids loved it too. This will be a regular at our house! The leftovers were gone pronto. I used light mayo and sour cream and didn't have broccoli. Next time, I'll try it with broccoli, but it was great without too.

This is great!  I only had about a half cup of sour cream, so I added about a cup of crema Mexicana.  I also put about a tablespoon of Dijon--we could barely taste it, even increasing the amount.  I skipped the chopped red pepper, but added chopped green chile.  I topped the casserole with sharp cheddar.  It was very good--thanks for the recipe!

Very good comfort food recipe.  My husband even ate the brocolli in the dish.

So glad I found this recipe, because I didn't have my standard cream soup I normally use. I did change it by adding a dash of garlic powder and only using 1 cup of sour cream and adding 3oz of softened cream cheese. I also left out the green onion and added shredded cheddar and french fried onion the last 15 minutes as another reviewer did. Will never use creamed soup for this again!!!

Pretty good. I used a can of green beans in place of the broccoli, because that is what my husband likes. Used all low fat versions of the recommended ingredients but still had a nice creamy consistency.

I know so many change a recipe to make it spicier, but there are some of us older folks who need to have a little more blandness in their diet. This recipe is wonderful, I even took away the pepper and the salt. If you want kind and gentle this Tuna Noodle Supreme really works.

This is a keeper! I used regular mustard, and it still came out fantastic! My husband loved it!

Very delicious! I used light sour cream and subbed light Miracle Whip for mayo. My husband loved it and he won't eat most veggies.
