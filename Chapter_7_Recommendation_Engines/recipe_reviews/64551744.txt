This is my own recipe but Allrecipies no longer allows you to make notes so I'll do it in a review.  I have made this with using pineapple chunks instead of rings (I was out) and have made it using the pineapple juice in place of eggs as well ( I didn't have any eggs that time either).  Both turned out great.
