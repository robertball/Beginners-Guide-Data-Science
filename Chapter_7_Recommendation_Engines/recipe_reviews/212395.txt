This should be called Southwestern Pasta Surprise!  I kinda expected a bit of italian flavor even with the salsa but there was nothing italian about it.  However it was really good!  Not gourmet by any means but a nice hearty super fast and easy yummy meal.  I used whole milk instead of cream because thats what I had and it seemed to work just fine.  Thanks for the idea!

Definitely different but very good!  I was concerned about the lack of spices so added a handful of chili powder and then probably 1/3 cup of sweet chili sauce (in the Asian section).  We all enjoyed it but I am rating 4 stars due to the changes.  I don't like it when people change recipes and then vote them 5 stars..  Ha.

This was not quite what I expected for rigatoni. Not Italian at all and more like hamburger helper with a mexican flair. I used wagon wheel pasta instead and onion powder instead of fresh onion. I was an oz short of tomato sauce so I added some ketchup to make up the rest. My husband didn't like this while the rest of the family did. I added a little extra shredded cheese. Thanks, this was a nice flavorful dish without much fuss.

This was very easy and a pretty quick meal.  Not my favorite, but certainly not bad.  Thanks for a simple solution after a long day!

I used spaghetti noodles since that's what was leftover.  Garlic powder, onion powder, and minced onion.  No bell pepper.  24 oz tomato sauce (one can no salt added).  I used heavy cream since it was leftover, but I think fat free half and half would be OK.  Was tasty!
ETA:  Made again with rotini noodles and FF half and half.  Still very good!  Added green pepper, too, and real garlic.

This is pretty good. I did change things a little bit. I added some taco seasoning to the meat while it was cooking, and used a whole bell pepper. Also had some cheese sauce that needed to be used and since it was cheddar I used that. Added half and half instead of cream topped with some Monterrey Jack cheese and olives. I didn't have any rigatoni so I just used fettuccine. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious and very husband friendly. I used half and half in place of the heavy cream, added a couple of dashes of cayenne for a little kick and added mushrooms and additional peppers. This made a great comfort food meal for a cool, fall day.

I have made this a few times now and would rate the first time (exactly as directed as a 3 1/2 or 4 but with the following additions it made it a strong 5!  I followed the advice of adding 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream.  I also added chili pepper and cheyenne pepper.  I added zucchini for extra veggies and used Barilla PLus penna pasta and an extra handful of cheddar.  I thought the additions made a huge difference!

Meh.  It's not bad, but it's not as good as the reviews led me to hope.  Kind of a bland Hamburger Helper type dish.  Again, it's not bad, just more of a Midwestern hotdish.

It was a lot of extra work for something that was just okay. I followed the directions exactly and there was just nothing really special about this dish. I don't think I will be making it again

This was good. A little different taste than what we are used to and I'm sorry but I can't really explain it. We did enjoy it very much. Have to say that it makes way more than 8 servings. Probably about 12. I ate it for lunch the next day and it was just as good. The only thing I left out was the green pepper and that's because I just didn't have any on hand.

A wicked good recipe. I tried to make it a little more healty by using whole wheat rigatoni, and it worked out great. It made it a little more al dente, which prevents the mushiness that some reviewers reported.

This was good; not spectacular, but good.  And it's an easy weeknight meal.  I used ground turkey and a random assortment of pasta I found in the cupboard; some of it was elbow macaroni, which I think gave it a little bit of a cafeteria-beefaroni feel, but when my husband took his first bite he made happy "mmm" noises so I imagine we'll definitely be having this again.  Thanks so much!

Came out great. Used linguine, since that was in the pantry; 2& milk instead of heavy cream and put it in the oven for 15 min.
