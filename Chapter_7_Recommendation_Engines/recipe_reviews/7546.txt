Ok, I've made this cheesecake about 8-10 times perfecting the recipe.  I have it down now.  Don't you hate how the outside of the cheesecake is rought but the middle is creamy.  Follow my adjustments and it will be same texture all the way through, nice and creamy.  Also, make sure you make some restaurant style strawberry topping.  Try the "supreme strawberry topping" recipe here at allrecipes.com.  Adjust cooking time on it as appropriate (about 15 minutes).

Cheesecake recipe adjustments:

Do not cook at 400 at all!  Do NOT preheat oven.  Prepare according to recipe and put in springform pan.  Put pan in over.  Now turn over to 200.  Cook for ~3 hours & 10 minutes. (give or take 10 minutes).  Should be a little firm when you turn the over off, but not real firm.  Turn oven off after the 3 hours and about 10 minutes.  Crack oven open and let cheesecake cool in over for 1 hour (or longer if you wish).  The put cheesecake in refridgerator for AT LEAST over night.  Best after full 24 hours.  Prepare "supreme strawberry topping" and put in refridgerator.

Walla!  Best cheesecake ever.  Raves from friends of mine:

the skeptic: "Its creamier than cheesecake factory.  Its hard to compare them...Honestly, I like this better."

cheesecake enthusiasts: "I used to eat cheesecake a lot.  Honestly [pause as she recounts all the cheesecakes she had ever had]....this is the best cheesecake I have ever had.  Really, this is the best.  The topping was good."

SUPERIOR RECIPE BUT ONLY GIVEN FOUR STARS BECAUSE
SUCCESS OF RECIPE DEPENDED ON OTHER REVIEWERS DIRECTIONS. CHEESECAKE TURNED OUT PERFECTLY USING THESE DIRECTIONS:  (1)  USE A GREASED 10-INCH PAN (2) USE ONLY 1/4 CUP SUGAR FOR CRUST (3) ADD 2 TSP. VANILLA TO CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE (4)  DO NOT PREHEAT OVEN; DO NOT USE A WATER BATH (5) BAKE AT 200 DEGREES FOR 3 HRS. AND 10 MINUTES  (6) TURN OVEN OFF AT END OF BAKING TIME (4) PARTIALLY PROP OVEN DOOR OPEN AND ALLOW CAKE TO COOL AN ADDITIONAL HOUR IN THE OVEN (7) REMOVE CAKE FROM OVEN AND REFRIGERATE 24 HRS. BEFORE REMOVING FROM PAN OR SERVING.  THESE DIRECTIONS  MADE A PERFECT, PERFECT DELICIOUS CHEESECAKE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CRACKS!   TIP:  I ALWAYS PLACE A CARDBOARD CAKE CIRCLE INSIDE THE CHEESECAKE PAN.  I GREASE THE CARBOARD JUST AS I WOULD THE PAN. THE CARDBOARD WILL NOT BURN AND THE CAKE AND THE BOARD CAN BE REMOVED AT THE SAME TIME FROM YOUR PAN.  USING A CAKEBOARD ELIMINATES THE PROBLEM OF SCRATCHING THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PAN, OR LOSING THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN IF YOU ARE SERVING OR TAKING YOUR CAKE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME.  ENJOY!

This is an old, tried and true NY cheesecake recipe and is absolutely the BEST (and I've tried lots of them).  I make mine with a few slight variations (I use a little less sugar and add lemon and orange zest).  
While I have no objection to people making changes to a recipe to suit one's own taste, I am always astounded when people rate a recipe with an average or poor rating, then go on to describe how they've COMPLETELY changed the original recipe.  Apparently these people don't realize that, when they rate a recipe based on their own concoction that has little resemblance to the original recipe, they are SKEWING a recipe's rating, and possibly altering other readers' opinions about whether to try a recipe or not.  
I would like to kindly suggest to persons who drastically change a recipe to refrain from rating it.  What you have created is a NEW RECIPE.  You should post it and rate it elsewhere on this website as such!

I followed the modifications suggested by Heislord5 on 10-02-01.  Cook 3 hours 10 min at 200 degrees, leave in the oven 1 hour after cooking time.  Turned out perfect.  I also added the suggested vanilla to enhance flavor.  A trick a chef friend of mine recommended was instead of the white sugar, substitute with confectioners sugar.    I also used 1/4 cup of flour instead of 1/8 listed to add thickness.  I had never cooked a cheesecake before and following this recipe with the suggested modification, it turned out perfect!

This cheesecake rivals anything you will ever buy in a bakery or a fine restaurant! I've read all the tips and here's the scoop on the "Undercooked" problem. I baked it according to the directions but after the hour at 200 degrees, I simply shut the oven off. DO NOT PROP THE DOOR OPEN. I left the cheesecake in the oven for a few hours. Actually, I went to bed around 1am when the baking was done, got up for work at 5am, took the cake out of the oven and put it in the fridge. There were NO cracks and it was set perfectly! This is the best cheesecake I've ever had and can be the basic starter for any additions you may want to make, like chocolate chips or carmel sauce... give it a shot, it's easier than you think!!

The BEST a true New York style cheesecake! All who have tasted it say it is the best they've had. Many people ask to buy this cake from me. I have made this cake many times and have used some revisions in the reviews. Make sure all ingredients are at room temp. before starting. I bake my crust at 325F for 10 min. and let it cool on a wire rack while mixing batter ingredients(use 1/2 stick of butter,crust will hold up better) Completely blend cream cheese. I also add 1 tsp. vanilla. I blend one ingredient at a time with a SLOW beater, don't over blend. Over beating will cause air bubbles on the top of cake. Absolutely use hot water bath (prevents cracking and drying out, boil water before then add to a sheet cake pan, or roasting pan and put on the bottom rack of oven before putting in the cake). Bake 3 hrs. 10 min. at 200F( Lower temp. will keep the cake from browning and drying out on the edges),  Crack oven door and cool for at least 2-3 hrs in the oven if you don't want any cracks (should be room temp.)Important tip: Chill the cake in the refrigerator at least 48-72 hrs. before cutting and serving it. Like fine wine, it needs aging. I have even froze left overs for a month and it is still incredible. I love it plain, but have fun and drizzle chocolate or caramel sauce on the top. Great with a berry topping too, but put it in a pretty bowl and serve it on the side. The top will get mushy if it's on the cake to long. Awesome recipe!!!!!! I love Allrecipes.com!!!!!!

I am a great cook, and have won many awards for my desserts. When I say this is the best cheesecake you will ever make, I mean it.Only a few changes I made.Cook cheesecake at 200 degrees for 3 and half hours, at a preheated oven Then shut off oven and leave door ajar  for 1 hour. I also added vanilla to the batter. Came out perfect. This is the best New York cheesecake you will ever make. Thanks

I give the recipe 'as is' only 1 star, because if someone followed it exactly, they'd end up with a very undercooked, yucky cheesecake. Even though after an hour of baking, it's obvious that it will have to cook MUCH longer, for someone that doesn't read the reviews first, this could be a disaster/waste. Luckily I did read reviews first, and anticipated having to cook for the 3 hours instead of 1. I didn't alter the sugar amounts, but now I wished I would have. It was WAY too sweet, even for me, and I have a sweet tooth. :]Also, it is better if it sits overnight. Gives it plenty of time to set, otherwise it's a bit mushy. I don't know if there were typos in the original recipe or what, but with the adjustments of cooking time, and much less sugar, this is a 5 star cheesecake. Without adjustments, it's a mess of a recipe. Thanks to all that reviewed with the heads up!

My first time making cheesecake.  Leave out the sugar in the crust (it was too sweet).  Add a couple of tbsp of lemon juice into the cheese mixture to enhance flavour.  I baked this cheesecake as another reviewer had suggested:
200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes.  It was absolutely creamy and delicious, and it didn't crack because I let it cool down in the oven for another hour after turning it off.  My guests were VERY IMPRESSED.  All of them say that it was the best, creamiest cheesecake they had ever had. An easy recipe.  Go for it! You'll be glad you did.

This is an excellent, creamy cheesecake!  My sons have always refused to eat cheesecake and they loved this one!  The only things I did different were to add 2 tsp. of vanilla and I made my crust from an old recipe - 1 stick butter, 2 c. graham cracker crumbs and a couple spoons of sugar.  I baked in a water bath at 200º for 2 hrs. 5 min. and let cool with the oven door open just a bit.  It turned out perfect with absolutely no cracks.  Very rich and creamy.  I have used all kinds of toppings from cherry to blueberry but it is just as good plain.  Made for our potluck and everyone raved - a real winning recipe!

I made this cheescake for a Holiday party that I went to recently and it was a total hit!  
People were telling me it was the best cheesecake they every tasted!  This recipe really
is superb.  My tips are:  use the cinnomin graham crackers and use 2 cups and 1/2 cupts of 
butter so you have a thicker crust.  Also, cook the cheesecake over a water bath at 250 degrees
for about 2.5 - 3 hours.  I didn't have one single crack in the top by doing it this way.  Cook it until
the top is golden brown and the filling is firm!  Good luck!

I rarely review a recipe, but I just had to review this one.  I made it for a friend of my daughter's and when asked her how it was, her reply was "AMAZING!!!"  I then asked her to compare it to Cheesecake factory and she said, "Oh, my so much better, the best I have ever had!!!!"  So needless to say, this is a keeper.  I am going to even try making it with Splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic friends.  I did follow some other's advice and did not go past 1 on my mixer and mixed it on low the entire time, scraping down the sides really well.  Then when ready to bake, I put it in a cold oven, turned the oven on 200 and baked for 3 and 1/2 hours.  Turned the oven off and left it in there (oven door closed) for about 3 hours and then refrigerated.  I also added 2 tsp. vanilla to the mixture. I have never seen a prettier cheesecake.  I whould highly recommend this recipe. I also made the breakfast blueberry sauce from this sight to add to the top when sliced. That also turned out wonderful.  Make and enjoy and just wait for the compliments to come rolling in.

This cheesecake is stunningly good.  I seriously think that it is the best thing I have ever made.  Ever.  I only gave 4 stars simply because of the cooking time issues.  For those just finding this recipe, I am condensing the adjustments I obtained from reading a thousand pages of reviews so you don't have to dig, I truly believe they made all the difference in the world.  The last two are optional, but the cooking time and temp are absolutely essential.  My cake was wonderfully creamy, perfectly cooked, and not a crack in sight.  Make.  This.  Cake.  

1.  Thanks to all of those who suggested this, I believe this made all the difference.  Place a water bath on the lower rack, and place the cake into cold oven, set to 200 degrees, and bake for 3 hours and 10 mins.  Turn the oven off, and leave the cake to cool for a couple of hours.  Place in the fridge at least overnight.

2.  Add 2 tsps. of good vanilla.

3.  I also added the zest and juice of half a Meijer lemon, it totally wakes up the cream cheese.

I love this cheesecake. Have made it several times with great success. However, I just purchased a new springform pan (non-stick and dark). I made this recipe again and it got totally messed up. It ended up with a huge crack in the center and it got all puffy and then deflated. Can anyone help me with this? I am assuming maybe the dark finish of the springform pan messed with the cooking time. I had been following the 3 hour 10 minute rule at 200 and then letting it sit in the oven for 1 hour. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Okay - the reason for only 4 Stars is because of the misleading directions.  READ others reviews!  This is a 5 STAR recipe, but the baking directions are way off.  I have never made a cheesecake before and wanted to make one for my daughters birthday.  After heeding everyone's advice, I bake the cake for 3 hours and 15 minutes at 200 degrees, then turned off the oven, cracked the door and let the cake cool for 1 hour.  I then placed it in the fridge for 12+ hours.  It was AMAZING!!  I did add cinnamon to the crust, a tsp. of vanilla, fresh lemon juice and zest to the batter.  My son-in-law, who LOVES cheesecake, said that it tasted like a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake.  I also baked in a 9 inch springform pan and it came out really thick but tasted light and fluffy!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely  best cheesecake we have ever eaten. Not sweet and not dense at all. It turned out light and fluffy. I did follow other reviewers and baked for 2 hours, then turned off the oven and let is set for 1 hour before putting it in the refridgerator overnight. It is so good we have decided not to share with the kids.

There was some conflicting reviews - use water bath don't use water bath; cook at 400, 325 and 200 degrees. So this is what I did. I added 2 tsp of vanilla (as suggested), I used the water bath and I did not precook the crust; I also cooked the cheesecake at at 200 degrees in an non preheated oven for 3 hours and 10 minutes (as suggested) then shut off the oven cracked the door and let it sit in for another hour. The outcome was pure perfection. It was by far the creamiest most flavorful cheesecake I have had the privilege of joyfully consuming.

I made this cheesecake for Christmas Eve and read the reviews first before baking it and I followed what pretty much everyone else said about cooking it at 400 for 10 minutes then at 200 for 3 hours. Well it came out absolutely perfect. I also took the advice of some and reduced the sugar just a little in the cheesecake batter. I only used 1&1/2 cups instead of 1&3/4 cups and it was just right. Everyone loved it and asked where I got the recipe. I kept the cheesecake plain and brought with it a variety of toppings (fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberry sauce, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream) and let everyone decide for themselves how they wanted to top their own piece. It was a big hit and I will definitely be making this cheesecake again!

This is a very good cheesecake, the flavor is delicious and it is easy to make. I made it twice and the first time I encountered the same problem that many of the other reviews had found with the time of cooking far off. The second time it turned out perfect. The thing that I found out that can be useful to you regarding the cooking time is to make sure you use a 10" spring form, because with the 9" the cake is to thick and it takes forever to cook. In the 10" it has the right thickeness to cook in 1 hour as the recipe suggests. Another thing is to grease the pan or it will stick (even if it is a non stick pan).
Let it cool in the oven. And refrigerate overnight. When the cake is done the center (approx 2-3 inches)is not as hard as the border. I inserted a toothpick and it came out clean in the borders but not in the center. Once it cooled down it become harder. And after refrigerating it overnight it is perfect and creamy. If the cake is overcooked it becomes dry. Good recipe, better than what you can buy in the stores, good flavor! It is worth the time and effort to make it.

I have been using this recipe for quite some time.  When I am invited to a party the invitation is to the Cheesecake with me as the guest.  A good friend of mine has eaten at the finest restaurants in the world, but says that when I make this cheesecake it tops any of them.    One of the best things to do is to bake it like others are saying.  A 200 degree oven for three hours then turn it off and crack the door for an hour.  Add the vanilla for a nice flavor.  I have also used almond extract and have incorporated sliced almonds into the crust.  When I bake mine, they keep a creamy color without browning.  (I will upload a picture to show you what I am talking about).    Try this one, you wont regret it and people will love it.

Absolutely fabulous!   I followed the suggestions of most all of the other reviewers and cooked in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for 3 hrs & 10 minutes and let cool in the oven for 2 hours with the door cracked.   Perfectly creamy all the way to the ends-no cracks and I did not use a water bath.  It was a huge, huge hit! Very important to remember to have all your ingredients room temperature - the eggs & the whipping cream.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to make.   reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups.  I found baking at 210 for 3 hours was best and chilling in the fridge overnight.  So it's best to plan to make this one a day ahead of your special occassion.

This was a HUGE hit.  I did use the tips in previous reviews, i.e. put a pan of water in the oven, added one teaspoon of vanilla and increased cooking time to 2 hours at 250 degrees. I made it for a VERY special dinner and it went over really well.  Thanks!!!

Cheesecake is my oldest daughter's favorite dessert. It is her standard request for her birthday cake. Typically I buy a frozen Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from Sam's Club. I have never made one myself before...a little intimidated by it for some reason. Well, that is no more! I made this yesterday for our Easter dinner today. I followed the ingredients exactly, but added 1 tsp of vanilla. It was super easy to put together. I did follow the baking suggestion of a non-preheated 200 degrees oven for 3 hours 10 mins. and left it sit in the stove for about 3 hours after turning it off. Then it sat in the fridge overnight. The process was somewhat time consuming, but, the end product was perfect! Granted, it is very filling....what else would you expect from 5 blocks of cream cheese, 7 eggs (combined) and heavy cream...but it was delicious! I will never buy a frozen cheesecake again!!

I also am rating with four stars due to other posters' advice. I did not cook this cheesecake for an hour as recipe had stated. I can't see how it would have even been done in that time. I cooked at 200 degrees for 3 hours and then let it sit in the oven for an hour. I did not use a water bath and I did not leave the oven slightly ajar either. I also used 2 tsps of vanilla in the mix. Now, I must say this was the creamiest and most delicious cheesecake I have ever made--and I've made many. There were absolutely no cracks and the cake did not have those dark, brown edges. This came out better than those expensive cheesecakes.  It was simply divine. I will use no other recipe.

This recipe is incredible, and worth the time it takes to bake.

I've made at least 40 of these and I've never had one fail. I did have one crack (only one), but I added too much flour and I knew it right when I did it. The taste is so rich and creamy!

I use a 9" springform pan and even though it's non-stick, I always spray the sides with cooking spray. Once I pour in the batter, I bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, then 200 degrees for three hours. I then turn off the oven and crack the door for an hour or so, then right into the fridge. Let it sit in the fridge at least 24 hours before you serve. I always serve with various toppings (strawberries, cherries, blueberries, whipped cream, etc.), but most people have a forkful with a topping and then no more...plain is just that wonderful!!!

This cheesecake is MAGNIFICENT.  It was sooooo good.  I have been asked many times since to make another and another.  I baked it for 10 minutes on 400 then baked it the whole time on 200 for 3 hrs and 10 minutes with a water bath.  I let it cool with the oven door cracked for about an hour and then let it chill in the frig over night in a 10-inch springform pan.  Follow these directions precisely and you will not be disappointed.  Your cheesecake will be the talk of the party.  Good luck!

This is as good as any expensive cheescake you can buy - maybe better.  It does take a pretty big time investment but it is worth it.  Follow the advice of many other reviewers and you will have a perfect cheesecake that will bring raves from everyone you serve.  Most importantly, bake for 3 hours and 10 minutes at 200 degrees.  Do not preheat the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven (with the oven door cracked) for at least an hour.  Refridgerate for at least 24 hours before serving. I also used a water bath on the bottom oven rack.  Before you begin be sure to allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature sitting on the counter for at least an hour.  It is very important that your mixture be smooth.   The cheesecake tips on this site and the reviews for this recipe are full of excellent information.  If you want a professional quality cheesecake take the time to read the info and you will be thrilled with the results.

OMG!! Rave reviews at the family dinner. Everyone told me to quit my day job and start a cheesecake business. Honestly, in my 40 years of baking, this was the FIRST cheesecake I've ever made! It made me very nervous, since there are so many varying recipes out there. I was sold on this one after reading reviews, and followed Heinlord5's cooking directions (200 degrees). PERFECTO!!! Not too dense (or sweet); And beautiful as well! Taste and texture rivals any New York Deli, for sure!!!

three for the  actual recipe......five stars for  all the "thank god I read the reviews" adjustments. at the actual recipe...this bake time was so offf....runny, not even close to being set...perhaps the cook should edit this recipe.....another reason for rating the actual recipe and not rating it based on the much needed alterations....leaves the actual recipe to be very misleading....will i make it again...only on the five star alterations and combinations of some very good cooks...if i were to use this recipe as it reads....it would be in the shredder....thanks for all the alterations..it made the money spent well worth it...

#1 Cheesecake ever if you cook at 200 degrees for 3 hrs. 10 minutes then turn oven off but leave cake in oven with door partially open for an hour.  Chill and eat the next day.  I did not do a water bath and I had NO CRACKS.  I topped with the following: I brought 10 oz frozen strawberries with 1/2 cup sugar and 2 - 3tbsp. of cornstarch to a boil until sugar disolves and sauce thickens.   Be careful addicting!!!

Holy!! This cheesecake is heavenly good! Next time, I will use less sugar when making the crust, its too sweet for me. I made this at 10 pm and baked it at 200 degrees for three hours and 10 minutes, I then propped the oven door open just a bit and left the cheesecake cool in the oven until the next morning at 6 am. I then put the cake in the fridge and added some chocolate chips on top of it. There were no cracks whatsoever nor brown spots! Everybody loved it! The cake is so rich in flavor, I can only eat half of a slice, its so delicious!!  Thanks Muffy!!

The cooking time was so far off... after all that hard work, then to find out it was raw in the middle!  The flavor may have been great, but what good is that without having a correct baking time?  I baked it an extra hour and it still wasn't done.  This recipe needs some work!

This was by far, the BEST cheesecake recipe I have ever made.  I followed the ingredients to a T, but used HEISLORDS review regarding baking at 200* for 3 hours, shut the oven off and crack open to let it cool.  Perfectly made cheesecake, no cracks and everyone LOVED it.  I wont ever make another cheesecake again.

Phenomenal !!  Absolutely Phenomenal !  This is it! And I've made many!  Followed the advice of 200 degree oven for 3 hours and 10 min (9" pan takes a bit longer) and it's absolutely perfect!!  If you like just great tasting CHEESE cake, don't add any flavorings, this is perfect on it's own. I won't make anything else.  I am always looking for the best of everything recipe and trust me, this is it.

So bummed to give this less than average review.  I've made this three times now, and the last one was the worst.  I cooked it for almost 3 hours, and the center was still liquid.  that was in my 9 inch pan.  The 10 inch pan ones came out a little better, but still had to be cooked for over 2 hours.  I guess I've just got to move on and find something else.  :(

EXCELLENT!    Almond in cheeseckae mixture, cream the cheese before adding to the egg mixture (no flour for more creamy texture), bake at  200 for 3 hours in MARY'S BATH, didn't open door - just left it in there until cool.  At least a day in fridge (covered with clingwrap).    Only suggestion that I should have done was CARDBOARD on bottom of spring-pan. Will do that next time.  THANK YOU YOU!  EXCELLENT!  Better than Cheesecake Factory by far.... so CREAMY.

Well, i was very intimidated on making a cheesecake period, even though i have a lot of cooking experience under my belt, but i was very dissapointed with the outcome of this. I didnt like the taste, (didnt taste to me like the way a new york style cheesecake should taste) I even used the adjustments of the reviewers, and i was just very dissapointed. I think three hours is very long, and it should only be about a little over two at 210 degrees, and left in the oven after for a couple of hours with the door closed, and then refrigerated for about 24 hours. that makes the consistency very creamy. I will definately look for another recipe. Dont know what all the raves were about on this one

I have tried several different recipes, this one being the best ever according to my family members and friends.  It is better than what you get in most restaurants.. we have found the key is to let it age for a couple of days to achieve maximum cheesecake-ness :)  Yummy!!

Great basic cheesecake recipe!!!  I actually doubled the crust and made 3 small cheesecakes (5 inch, 6 inch and 7 inch.)  Turned out great.  I baked it 3.5 hours on 200 and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there 1 more hour.

Seriously the best cheescake I ever had.  I had to use a smaller pan (9") so it was in the oven a little longer (an hour longer) But I guess the best thing to do is just follow Muffy's directions and just keep checking your cheesecake until it is done.  I topped mine with a simple can of canned cherry pie filling while cooled and still in the spring form pan and then put back in the fridge.  This helped it to keep the cherries on top in a pretty design which I removed it from the pan.  I made this for my fiance on his bday.  People raved. (except for my jealous brother in law to be who refuses to eat anything I make) :)  This is the first cheesecake I have made that did not crack without having to fuss with pans of water in the oven etc.  It is simple and seriously the prettiest and best tasting cheesecake ever. 100 Stars to you Muffy! You are a star chef!

Truely the very creamiest and decadant cheesecake I've ever made! This is now my favorite cheesecake! mine took about 2 hours and 20 minutes to bake. I think it could be do to the fact that I baked it in in a bath. BUT it was perfect! I also added 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract just for a little extra flavor enhancer plus i used baker super fine sugar and silks cake flour. The results were smooth and creamy perfection. I love this recipe!

okay, I am not happy. This is the second time I made this and the second time i couldn't eat  it! I thought I would give it a second chance because the first time I made it the taste was good but the consistency was lumpy. I mixed it longer and cooked it 30 minutes longer that the recommended hour, let it cool, then refrigerated it for an hour and still had soup!

A "true" NY cheesecake, according to a famous NY cheesecake maker, has NO crust. And the texture is rich, creamy but has very fine pores like a cake. Read this:

I am so happy!  I finally made the perfect cheesecake.  Thanks to other suggestions, I baked for 3 hr 10 minutes at 200 degrees, didn't need a water bath, and it was perfect.  Thanks!

This is an astounding cheesecake.  I baked it for 3 hours & 10 minutes in a 200 degree oven, as someone else suggested, & it was absolutely perfect.  I'd put it right up there with any restaurant for looks and taste.  It was perfectly set, even, & creamy inside.  Everyone raved over it: "This is awesome!" & "Wow...how did you DO this?!" & "This is the BEST cheesecake!"  I served it with the Supreme Strawberry Sauce on Allrecipes, and they were wonderful together.  Yum!!

i've been using this recipe for the last 3yrs and think it's a great cake and my family begs for it .the only thing that i find in the recipe wrong is with the crust don't put all that sugar in the graham crackers and not much butter is needed either it makes it to hard remember graham crackers are made with sugar and butter so you don't need to add so much more i also used vanilla wafers again not so much butter and sugar my family likes it best with the wafers and for the cake itself after you beat the eggs in try not to beat the batter to much cause if you over beat thats what causes cracks in you cake and i noticed if you let the eggs and cheese get room temp befor you start you won't have to cream  so much save your beating for after all the ingredients are added
 then beat for about 2-3 mins also i think this is the most important thing preheat the oven at 400befor you start mixing and bake at 400 for 10 mins then turn the oven down to 375 and bake for a hour turn the oven off and crake oven open and leave in until oven is no longer hot and put on the countertop let cool to room temp and put in fridge overnite it always comes out perfect this way i've been using this method for years and it works everybody loves it

I made this yesterday as a dry run for a dinner party I'm hosting this weekend, giving it today to the folks at work who happily volunteered to be my taste testers. The responses were great -- flavor was right on -- but everyone agreed it needed to be cooked a little more. Like other reviewers, I made it according to the alterations of those who came before me: reduced the sugar in the crust (1/4 c) and the filling (1 1/4 c); added 2 t. vanilla; all ingredients were at room temp; baked at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes with a water bath on the rack underneath and no preheat; cooled in the oven with the door cracked; fridged overnight. I can say it was very easy to make, looked fabulous (no cracks!) and tasted great, but it was just slightly underdone. The oven thermometer read correctly, so I'm not sure where the problem occurred. I will remake tomorrow morning, try cooking for 10 minutes longer before turning off the oven, and update my review after.
UPDATE: it’s the day after my event and I am updating my review. I made the same cake as above, but increased the temp to 205 and cooked it for 10 minutes longer. This seemed to make a great difference (even with a 4.2 earthquake and several aftershocks in the middle of baking!). To say it was a smash hit is an understatement. I served it with a mixed berry couli on the side. I wasn’t asked for the recipe, but was told to expect to be asked to make it for all of our gatherings. I will now play with flavor variation.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it twice and the second time was a charm!  I took some advice and used 1T of lemon juice and 1/2t vanilla extract and the taste was outstanding.  I also used the hot water bath and baked it at 10 min. 400 degrees,and 3 hours at 200 degrees.  I left it in the oven for 1 hour, room temp for 3 hours and in the fridge until the next day.  Thank you for the best cheesecake recipe!

I made this recipe for a family Christmas gathering this year. I followed other posters advice and cooked at 400 for 10 min. and then 200 for 3 hours. Then turned off the oven and cracked the door open for 1 hr. It came out perfect. Beautiful and no cracks. I cooked mine in a 9" springform pan. I also used vanilla wafers instead of graham crumbs and decreased the sugar in the crumbs to a couple of tablespoons since they are already sweet. Served with cherry pie topping. Unfortunatly I never got to try it myself as my son came down with the flu and I stayed home with him while the rest of the family went. I did however recieve many phone calls raving about this cheesecake, some saying it was the best they ever had. As soon as I get my springform pan bottom back (my husband forgot it) I will make another just for us.

This is the best cheesecake that I have ever had -seriously!!!!  But ONLY because I followed the directions of fellow reviewer, HEISLORD5 posted back on 10/2/01. Read her review so that you dont have to make this 5 times before getting it right. If you love a THICK, HEAVY, yet still MOIST, poundcake then you have found your recipe!!

This is very similar to a recipie that I use as a "Cheesecake Staple" in my house. I add a secret ingrediant though... 2tsp. vanilla ( not immitation here use the real stuff and if you can find alcohol free even better cause the flavor is more vanilla) To avoid the "Cheesecake crack" I use the pan of water on the shelf below the cake but for added insurance I wrap the springpan in foil and a lip around the top also like you would a pie crust. I have also used Oreo crumbs for the crust with butter to bring it together. I love cheesecake and I know you do too  :-)

My Boss was a chef from NY and he went crazy over this cheesecake, He said it was the best he ever had, as did my husband.  I never finally had to try it (not a chessecake fan) but wow!!! now I see what everyone is raving about!!  I'm making my 5th cheesecake tomorrow everybody loves it!! thank you so much!

Wow!!!!  This recipe is out of this world.  I did add the vanilla and I took HeisLord's advice about cooking time.  I have baked many a cheesecake in my lifetime and while 55 minutes at 350 degrees works, it always resulted in a cracked cheesecake that didn't taste anywhere near as good as this one.  Again wow!  I think some of the reviewers that didn't get good results here have to realise that baking times do vary as a result of altitude and oven make.  Try it again at 210 degrees for 3 hours, give or take 10 minutes.  Thanks, HeisLord and thank you, Muffy!!

This cheesecake rivals any I've has in a New York deli! A nice firm decadent 
dessert. I did put a bowl of water in the oven while preheating and during 
cooking to keep up the humidity. I didn't open the oven until it was cool, but it 
still had a crack in the middle. I will lightly grease the sides of the pan next 
time so the cake will be able to pull away from the sides as it cools. Delicious!

One of the best recipes that I have found.  If I might add one thing, add a dish with water in the oven at the same time to keep humidity up.  This will keep the cheesecake moist and prevent the cracking and skin from forming on the top.  If you do this, increase the baking time by 30 to 40 minutes depending on your oven.

I am not sure what happened but the cake fell apart. I followed the recipe perfectly. Beware the cake gives the appearance of being done then once you let it cool and release the spring form pan it FALLS apart. Knowing I wasted all that money in cream cheese made me want to cry.

My God!! Is all that needs to be said! I used all the tips from The Cake Maker, however the very center was still a lil goopy. Not like pudding or anything, it stood on it's own, just wasn't the same texture as the rest of the cake.  No matter at all of course, but will try 3.5 hours at 200 next time.  Also, all of you giving this recipe negative reviews yet didn't even make it that way.....how the heck can you criticize a recipe you didn't make? I for one have made a cheesecake (not this one but a diff recipe) following the high temp for an hour and it comes out quite wonderfully. Yes, it isn't as pretty and the edges are a bit rough and the crust is a bit crunchier, but I still gave that recipe 5 stars because it deserved it! Rate what you make, not what you don't....that is all :D

Best....cheesecake....EVER!!! Love this recipe, it is very very creamy and perfectly sweet so my family cant get enough! I have to admit I do cheat, I buy the store bought gharam cracker crust and this recipe yields 3 of those crust and to keep it good and moist I place them on the rack in a cookie sheet water bath or a pan filled with water on bottom of oven, either way it comes out delicious! Try this recipe you wont regret it, have fun with it and good eating!

Outstanding recipe.  I added a sour cream topping from the Libby's Pumpkin Cheesecake recipe and allowed the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door cracked and heat off for a couple of hours.  That and thoroughly tapping the cheesecake batter in the spring form pan  before baking to allow the entrapped air bubbles to escape reduced the cracking of the surface.

Really tasty dessert. I bake it for two hours, though and it turns out perfectly. I've made it twice now and have gotten lots of compliments each time. Be sure you have plenty of people to eat it, though, because even a small slice is enough richness to satify the strongest of sweettooths!

Fabulous cheesecake recipe!  Got excellent results as written except I only had 2 boxes reg. fat cream cheese and 3 boxes reduced fat.  Added a smidge more flour to counteract wateriness and since I like a lot of graham cracker crust, added another 1/4 cup plus 2T butter.  Had to extend baking time, for whatever reason, but as soon as internal temp reached 165 I shut off the oven and let it cool inside for an hour.  Then removed to counter.  Had a bit of a crack around the edge, but DELICIOUS nonetheless.  Best cheesecake I ever made!

This is the exact recipe-minus lemon zest-out of my old Betty Crocker cookbook my mom gave me when I was first married :) I've made it at least once a year for 16 years, and even when my husband dropped a beer unside down into it once, it has always been fantastic!

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious. However, I gave it only four stars because, as some other reviews stated, it did take about three hours to cook, and I was not expecting to wait around that long. 
If anyone is interested, I did use this recipe again for mini cheesecakes in 4" springform pans, and THAT took about an hour and ten minutes. Did it just the same otherwise. If you make a smaller cake, I strongly recommend cutting down the amount of egg used.

The flavor of this cheesecake is unbelievable. My oven stopped working- and I had to pull out our smaller electric portable convection oven.  I was using the revised instructions to cook at 200 for 3hrs and 10 mins... but since the oven stopped working at an unknown point, I took the cheesecake out of the main oven, and put it in the smaller one at 350 for 45 minutes. The majority of the cheesecake set up really well. After letting it sit in the fridge over nite, it set up even more. This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, and I am sure had my oven worked properly, would have had a BEAUTIFUL cake. I will use this recipe again- the FLAVOR is amazing, simple, creamy, cheesey- and despite it not being completely set- was still a hit dessert... Wonderful Cheesecake Pudding LOL :) Can't wait to make it again and not have an oven fail me!

I thought that the cheesecake was creamy and delicious I made 15 of them for a graduation party and they were all gone in 3 hours.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used one sleeve of graham crackers for the crust and only 1/4 c. sugar.  I also added 2 tsp. of vanilla.  When I made the cheesecake so that it didn't fall in the oven I didn't preheat the oven and I baked at 200 for 3hours and 10minutes.  The outer edges will not brown but it is baked all the way through and looks wonderful.  I then turn off the oven and prop the door open leaving the cheesecake in for an hour to cool then remove and refrigerate for 24 hours.  The process is time consuming but you won't be disappointed it will be delicious and won't  sink a bit.

Delicious!! The only thing I am going to do next time is to bake crust a little bit before putting cheese cake filling on it. It didn't seem to get crunchy enough for me, but the taste was phenomenal!! I will make this many, many more times.

Soooo good and easy. The only change I made was I baked it in a water-bath 450 degrees for 10 min., turn oven down to 225 degrees for 1 and 1/2 hours.

I didn't like it.  It tastes too much like eggs.  Really disappointed, because of the high ratings.  Maybe I'm the only one that doesn't want my cheesecake to taste like eggs?

I have made this 3 times already, with a few changes when I read all the other reviews. The third time making it was absolutely the best! The more you make it the more perfect it gets and it is the BEST cheesecake around! We don't have it in the fridge for long:) I didn't preheat oven or Preakness crust. I made everything then put it in oven n turned oven on 200 for 3 h 10 m then turned off n cracked oven door for an hour. All ingredients were just about room temp n I mixed til super smooth. Let set for 25+ hrs n was best ever!!!

I cannot rate this high enough....it deserves 100 stars! I followed all the reviews and double foiled my pan, baked in a water bath on bottom rack at 200 degrees for 3hrs and 10 mins, let cool with the door cracked for 2-3 hrs, and chilled for 24 hrs. Not even the littlest crack! The top was as smooth as glass....and the taste brought me back home to NY. This will definitely be my cheesecake recipe from now on. It didnt even last through the day before it was gone, and a request for another came in, lol. I made a delicious blueberry sauce for the top, and it was excellent!! Thanks for this great recipe!!

Without a doubt, a true NY cheesecake recipe. But do follow all the other comments on cooking times, instructions, and addition of vanilla. I used a bit more butter in my crust and a little less sugar, and without a doubt this makes enough batter that a 10 in pan is almost mandatory. Minimal tweaking and well worth 5 STARS!!!!!

This is excellent, my husband can't stop talking about it. I did change a few things as recommended by other readers. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup in the crust. I added 2 tsp. vanilla to the batter. I baked as was directed by other reviews at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes. However, as beautiful at it turned out, it was not quite set in the middle. The next time I make it, I'll try baking at 215 degrees for about 3 hours and check on it. I served it with sliced fresh strawberries. The taste is wonderful. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I needn't look any further.

I used this recipe as a base so I made several changes.  It came out very nice. No cracks but mine came out a little flat and slightly brown.  I only added 1/4 cup of sugar to the crumb mixture, next time I will leave the sugar out altogether as the base is sweet enough without it.  I left out the 2 egg yolks because I didn't want it "eggy" (next time I will put them in).  I put 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4 and added 2 tsp. of vanilla.  I used sour cream instead of whipping cream because I like the flavor of it in cheesecake.  I think mine came out a little to brown because I baked it on 400 first and then turned down to 200 for 2 1/2 hours.  Next time I will just back it on 200 for 3 hours and not preheat the oven.

Totally amazing!  Closest thing I have had to a New York Cheesecake that wasn't from a bakery!  I used the serving scaler to change the amount for my family as we needed one for 4 servings and I baked it in a a small 8 inch cake pan and it came out marvelous.  I topped it with some fresh strawberries and voila(!) a beautiful dessert that I actually didn't put a whole lot of effort in like other cheesecakes I have made...give it a try!

Yummmmmy :) So smooth, thick & rich! My brother (who doesn't like cheesecake very much) said "This is VERY good cheesecake!" This is an awesome recipe to get a response like that from him! My other family members raved about it too! I goofed a little though... I cooked it at 250 for two hours before realizing the oven should have been at 200. SO, I cooked it two hours at 250, one hour at 200, then turned off the oven and let it sit for two hours with the door cracked open. A beautiful cheesecake with no crack!! I added 2 tsp. of vanilla too! Thanks to Muffy for my new favorite cheesecake recipe! :)

Absolutely the best cheesecake. It was perfect. I tried it first with a water bath but it didn't cook all the way through (maybe with another 45 minutes it would have). Without a water bath it came out perfect and didn't crack at all.  My guests could not stop raving about it.

This is a very good recipe. I did lessen the sugar to 1 1/4 c. When I make my crust, I always sprinkle a bit of cinnamon in the mix, just to add a bit of flavor(less than 1/4 tsp.) I did bake it on 200 (no pre-heat) for 3 hours in a water bath, then I opened my oven and let it cool over night. In the AM I put it in the fridge. I also made homemade cream cheese frosting and frosted the top. This was by far the prettiest cheese cake I have ever made. It is a bit rich, so portions were smaller. BTW, I read in a review that you can't give a recipe 5 stars if you have to change it. Well, I was brought up that a recipe is just a guide line. You bend it and tweak it to you and your families personal taste. If you have good guide lines in a recipe and your dish comes out wonderful, then you have found a winner!! When looking at this recipe I read every ones reviews and wrote them down on the copy I printed. So,I give this recipe and all who reviewed it 5 STARS.

No way, I use a recipe I got back in 1960, and it certainly is a less expensive recipe.Besides, it tastes just like New York style cheese cake.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever  had.  First time making it too!
I added 1/4 tsp lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  Cooked at 400* for 10 minutes then 200* for 3 hours.  Let it sit in the oven for 1-2 hours. Then let it cool on the counter for another 1-2 hours.  It turned out perfect-no cracks!!  The only thing I would change is maybe a little  less sugar next time.  It is just a touch sweet.. but still VERY GOOD!  Thanks for this recipe!!  So very generous to share with everyone!

I have stuck gold in my search for the perfect cheesecake. After reading ppl's suggestions, I baked it at 400 for 10 min, then 200 for 3 hours, then turned oven off and let it sit in there for 1 hour. People were raving about how rich and smooth and savory it was. Also added vanilla to it, and used an oreo cookie crust and dusted the top with cocoa powder. Thank you for this fabulous dessert!

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!! Followed recipe exactly but varied the cooking time and temp as suggested by others. First I made the crust and baked it for 10 minutes. While it cooled, I made the filling with all my ingredients at room temperature, first beat the cheese until fluffy, then added the eggs and egg yolks one by one, mixing well after each addition. Then the sugar mixed with the flour, and finally the cream. Then poured it on my prebaked crust, placed it in a waterbath and ended up baking it at 400 for 10 minutes and then at 200 for 3 hours, then turned the oven off and cracked the door semi-open for another hour, then straight to the fridge for 24 hours, served it with butterscotch morsels sprinkled about and drizzled some butterscotch caramel over before serving. YUM!!!

I am not kidding when I say that everyone that tried this cheesecake said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had, including myself. It turned out perfect and was delicious. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then turned downt he oven to 200 for another 3 hours. I put directly in the fridge from the oven and I still had no cracks. I advise refrigerating for at least 24 hours before serving.

This cheesecake tasted great but was a runny mess - should've looked at the reviews instead of just going by the rating... I'm trying it again with suggestions from other reviews. ADDED LATER: Tried again and it was perfect - best cheesecake I've ever had. Used vanilla wafer crumbs instead of graham crackers(didn't follow the crust recipe in this recipe). I also used the suggestions of others and baked it for 3 hours and 10 minutes. I didn't preheat the oven or use a waterbath. LOVE IT!

It's a keeper!  Follow the directions for baking 3 hours and 10 minutes, then leaving in the oven for the next 2 hours.  For the water bath, I put the pan of boiling water on the shelf below the cheesecake.  It seemed easier.  It came out perfect.

WOW A+.  This cheesecake is SO SO creamy.  The key is like you have seen a few people mention.  I baked it at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes and did NOT preheat the oven.  I then let the oven cool for one hour with the door propped open a little bit.  Then I stuck it in the fridge and let it cool for about 18 hours before we dug in.  The wife and kids loved it!

Excellent creamy cheesecake. I followed the suggestion of baking at 200 degrees for 3 hours, 10 minutes. I then slightly propped the oven door open and let it sit in the oven for two hours. The cake was perfect. Smooth, creamy with a white top, just like you would buy at the bakery. I served it with the Betty Crocker Raspberry Sauce found at this website. I would suggest decreasing the cornstarch for the sauce. I had hoped to drizzle the sauce on like they do at restaurants. However, I had to spread it. It tasted great, but did not look as pretty as you see it served at elegant restaurants.

Absolutely wonderful!  The best ever..I'll never use another recipe.  But the other reviews are correct..bake it for 3 hours at 200*.  After that, I turned off my oven, left the door closed and went to bed.  The next morning, I put it in the fridge.  No cracks, perfect texture.

This cake took a much longer time to cook than indicated. I lost track of how long it took but believe me, it seemed forever. I must say, I was a bit nervous waiting for the outcome. I mean let's get real here, I did have to use 5 packages of cream cheese on the darn thing! 
The outcome: Though I put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake in order for it not to crack, the thing still cracked! I think this happen because the directions were to beat the cream cheese and eggs together. Advice:I read in a book that you should beat the cream cheese and sugar before adding the eggs. Once you add the eggs you should beat gently. 
Anyhoo, my 10 year old daughter LOVED this cheesecake! I thought the taste was good and I think I might make it again but not for a very long time. Thanks!

The taste was good, however I followed the cooking time and temp. and ended up with a runny mess. I checked the reviews and now understand I should have baked at the 200degree for 3hrs. NOT the 1hr. as indicated.Poured the mess in another pan and baked at 350degrees,ended upvery dry and cracked

I followed the advice of Suaede (the review before this one) and made all of the changes she mentioned. I did have a problem with it cracking though which was probably because I put it in the fridge before it was completely cooled. It looked fine before putting it in the fridge but then when I looked at it the next morning there was a big crack in the middle. Also I topped it with fresh sliced strawberries and glaze about 8 hours before serving but when we cut it the middle was very wet and mushy. (I'm pretty sure it was cooked in the middle when I took it out of the oven but I guess the juice from the strawberries and the glaze leaked into the crack which caused the cake to be so wet) We sliced the 10" cake into 16 pieces but it was so heavy we didn't feel so good for about an hour after eating it, so keep the pieces small. The next time I make this cake I will top it with something other then strawberries or even keep it plain.

Amazing Cheesecake!  I made this to bring to a family BBQ on Memorial Day and it was a HUGE hit.  I prepared the recipe slightly different that the original though.  I used 1 stick of butter, 2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 2 tablespoons sugar for the crust and I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and an additional 1/4 cup flour to the cake batter.  I also cooked this in a 200 degree oven for 3 hours 10 minutes (as many other posters suggested) and put a roasting pan of boiling water in the oven as well.  I think let the cake sit in the oven for an additional hour with the door open a bit and then I refridgerated the cake for about 36 hours before serving.  It had no cracks whatsoever, came out of the pan easily and was it perfectly creamy and delicious.  I will make this again and again and again...

I made this last night and gave my boyfriend and piece and he loved it! I ended up baking the cheesecake in an 8 inch springform pan and it was VERY thick, but thats how we like it. I added some chocolate chips to the batter and once I chilled it in the fridge I put a thin layer of Dove dark chocolate hot fudge, chopped walnuts more chocolate chips and I made some homemade caramel sauce(sort of like a turle cheesecake) Looks storebrought and I saved about $30 by not getting it at The Cheesecake Factory!!!!

I made this for my hubbie's birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  My mom, who hates everything, tried it and demanded that I make her one.  I used the suggestions below like adding a water bath on the rack below, adding 1 tsp of vanilla & baking at 200 for 3 hours then allowing to cool off in the oven with the door slightly ajar.  Unfortunately, I did not taste this as I do not care for cheesecake.

I have tried to make many cheesecakes before, and most did not turn out with the restaurant quality I wanted.  With this one I finally did it!  It is so creamy, I made it with the idea of eating a slice or two and having my husband take the rest to work, however I don't know that it will make it there!  I followed some previous suggestions and baked it at 250 over a water bath, however I wound up baking it for almost 3 hours before only the center jiggled.  I then turned off the oven and propped the door open a little to let it cool.  One thing I would do different next time is to make sure the water is boiling from the beginning when I put it in the pan because it does take a long time to heat up.  But there are no cracks, no brown spots, just yumminess.  I have some Junior's chocolate mousse that I may try and top it off with tonight like we had found in one of our favorite restaurants.

Fantastic! This was our first attempt at cheesecake. Company was so impressed! The finished product looks and tastes like it took hours to prepare, but is really easy.  We have never tasted better cheesecake anywhere before.  Hints on how to make a cheesecake on this site were very helpful for first timers.  Thanks to everyone!!!

Great cheesecake! PS cheesecakes crack because they are cooled to quick and the cake stays with the pan and pulls away from the center. Leave cake in slightly propped open oven until cooled, this will also finish setting.

This was the MOST delicious cheesecake.  It did take longer to cook than stated.  The only thing I did to make it even better, was to add vanilla extract, and I substituted the crust from the "Basic Cheesecake" recipe on this website.  Truly fabulous.

Amazing!  Agree with all the other reviewers-use baking instructions to bake at 200 for 3 hrs 10 min, leave in oven with door cracked one hr, then put in refrigerator.  No cracks, smooth and delicious.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla extract as others have recommended and used a chocolate cookie crumb crust.  Topped with homemade caramel sauce and candied pecans for my version of turtle cheesecake.  Perfection!

I am a Professional Chef and thought the cook time for that temp(200 degrees)looked way off but decided since it was a new recipe to me I would follow the recipe. Following the recipe exactly you will come up with an extremely undercooked cheesecake.  Made once by recipe and then made it again using the recipe modifications suggested.  2nd time was much better.

STOP and read reviews before making this! There are LOTS of great recipes out there for cheese cake. This ain't one of them. IF you find and follow all of the advice in the reviews, you'll probably end up with a good cheese cake -- but why not just use a different recipe?

I made this for my husband's birthday yesterday. I baked it at 200* for 3 hours and 10 minutes as suggested. It was wonderful. I greased the sides of the pan to avoid cracking. I also forgot the sugar in the crust and I didn't miss it a bit! I had to use my oven to bake dinner so I pulled it out and put a towel around it rather than letting it cool in the oven. Seemed to work just fine. I also planned on serving it that evening (mama of 3, running out of time!) so I popped it in the freezer for an hour. It wasn't cold when we ate it, it was more like room temp, but it was SO yummy! And the texture was perfect. :-)

Creamy!!  Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature and mix it until it is SMOOTH.  No cutting time there.

I thought this was only OK...definitely not the best.  It was much too sweet for my taste and not the right consistency to be a NY cheesecake.

Awesome! I did follow the review adjusting the cooking time to not pre-heat and cook for 3 hours at 200 degrees.  Turned out perfect!

This recipe is fantastic! my first time making cheesecake. I used a store bought keebler crust (2extra servings) and still had enough batter to fill 6 more mini keebler crusts.

I skipped the water bath, and 200 degrees for 3 and a half hour (as suggested below). Left them in the oven for another 3 hours. Let them sit at room temp for 2 hours before putting them in fridge. Had them a day or two after baking and they were sooo goood.

Definately sticking to this recipe and making more soon! Thanks!

This is truly an amazing cheesecake.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the sugar in the filling down to 1 cup and added a teaspoon of vanilla and almond flavoring.  It's very creamy and even better the following day.  I served it with strawberry sauce and got raves on it.  I will make this again for sure over the holiday season!

Finally! I have been looking for YEARS for a cheesecake recipe that tasted like this. I always wanted it to taste like a resturant cheesecake and I finally found it. This cheesecake definetly tastes better after it sits in the refridgerator for a couple days. I did bake it for 3 hrs and 10 min and use the 2 tsp vanilla. It turned out perfectly! I couldn't be happier! Thank you so much for sharing this excellent recipe! It was definitely a success!

This is a wonderful creamy cheesecake.  I made it for my son's birthday.  He requested cheesecake because he doesn't like traditional birthday cake.  All my kids raved over it and now they want it for their birthdays !  The only change I made was to bake it at 200 degress F for 3 hours and 10 minutes.  My son in law said it was the best cheesecake he'd ever had !

This takes way longer than an hour to bake. If the instructions were modified to say that, I would probably give it a much better rating.

WOW! This is a good recipe. I baked at 200 for 2.5 hrs then turned the oven off for about 30 minutes. Once removed, I let it sit out for about an hour then added the raspberry sauce and strawberries. Also, I did not add the 1/8c of flour- still came out perfect! I'll upload a pic!

I must have done something wrong because I followed this recipe to a T and my cheesecake did not set up! I left it in the oven after baking to cool down and then put it in the fridge overnight and still gooey. Only 1/2 inch around the edges turned out good enough to eat and boy was it good! I'm trying again!

I made this cheesecake yesterday for Easter. It was my first attempt at cheesecake as I've always been a bit scared of it. I condiser myself to be a decent baker. I wanted to rate this recipe with 1 star but couldn't bring myself to do it. This would be because of the need to add cooking time. I cooked mine exactly as the recipe stated (my oven is the correct temp) and after cooling and then refrigerating it was rather liquidy except for the outer 2". I did put it back in the oven to see if I could rescue it. I will know when I get home tonight and try a piece. If I would have read all of the reviews I would have known to cook it for 3 hours instead of 1 but it really should state that right in the recipe. I was very disappointed last night. I will try to make it again, however. I will follow the cooking directions found in the reviews and see if it turns out as well as everyone says.

It tasty very "eggy" and had several large cracks on top.  I followed all of the tips and baked it at 200 degress for 3 hr. 10 min.& left in oven for 1 hr. with door open.  I would not make this again, mainly because of it's eggy taste.

I made this for the office, and everyone loved it.  I also made the praline sauce found on this site to pour over each slice.  Very good.  I followed other recommendations and cooked it for longer.

Wonderful!  I made it for a good friend and he loved it.  The only change I would consider is if you are baking it on 200 degrees, then it took me about 3 and a half hours to bake rather than one.  When in doubt, if the top part of the cake is smooth and solid enough, take it out and let it chill overnight.  Good recipe!

Creamiest cheescake I have ever made. I did not add any sugar to the crust. Crumbs are sweet enough. And I used 1/2 cup butter. To the cheesecake batter I added 2 tsp. vanilla and used 1 1/4 c. maple syrup instead of whte sugar. (you could add a little more if you like it sweeter. We don't like it real sweet.) I used a 10" springform pan and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 min. then turned the oven down to 200 degrees and baked for 3 hours. Then I opened the oven door and left it in there until it cooled before I put it in the fridge. Wow! Was it creamy! We all loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Incredible.  I followed all the suggestions given by HEISLORD5, plus I added 2 tsp. vanilla per The Cake Maker.  It was soooo good and did not crack.  The texture was wonderful.  I was told that it was my best cheesecake yet by several people.  Thanks for the recipe and the extra hints from others!

THIS IS THE CREAMIEST! I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES. I USED A STICK OF BUTTER WITH THE 1 1/2 CUPS OF CRUMBS TO MAKE THE CRUST, ELIMINATED THE SUGAR, AND PREBAKED IT FOR 10 MINUTES AT 325 DEGREES. I THEN TURNED THE OVEN DOWN TO 200 DEGREES. I ALSO ADDED 2TB OF VANILLA TO THE FILLING. I SLOW BAKED IT AT 200 DEGREES OVERNIGHT FOR 7 1/2 HOURS. IT WAS THE CREAMIEST CHEESECAKE I'VE EVER EATEN. I TOPPED IT WITH THE HOT FUDGE SAUCE RECIPE FOUND ON THE INSIDE OF THE NESTLE'S PREMELTED CHOCOLATE(CHOCOBAKE)BOX. EXCELLANT!

This was the creamiest cheesecake I've ever had. I did all of the suggestions and it was wonderful. I do suggest making it in a 10" pan because there is a lot of filling.

I made this cheesecake this past weekend for a family gathering.  The only change that I made was I added two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and followed the other reviewers advise to bake for  3 hours at 200F.  There were no cracks and it tasted amazing.

Soooo delicious and fairly easy to make! I followed the suggestion to only bake at 200 and it was perfect.  My only thought is... what would happen if the flour was left out?  I have a friend who loves cheesecake but has an allergy to gluten.  I wonder if it would still turn out ok??

I was given the same receipe by a 93y/o lady.  Her receipe calls for a macadamia/vanilla wafer crust and a topping of crushed pineapple, coconut and macadamia nuts--

I made it in the Kebler ready made crust and baked it at 200? for 3 hours and let it cool for 1 hour it turned out perfect!  If you only want to make one of those I would cut in half, otherwise you will end up with a couple.  I didn’t have a spring foam pan and only had one crust and after pouring into it I thought……… uh-oh, luckily I found that I had 4 packs of the individual pie crusts as well and used all of them.  This was the best cheesecake I have ever tasted

Absolutely delicious! I only needed 4 packages of cream cheese, not 5 and I still had batter left over. I also topped the cheesecake with sliced strawberries sauteed with a little brown sugar. So easy and really impressive. Thanks for sharing this!

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out great! I took the advice of others and lowered the sugar in both the crust and the cake, added vanilla, and baked for 3 hours at 200, leaving the oven door ajar for an hour or so after I turned the oven off, before putting it in the fridge to cool. I made a raspberry coulis to go with it and I will definetly be making this recipe again!

My husband and I own a cafe and due to personal matters our chef had to quit - leaving us in a major bind.  Our customers loved his cheesecakes - but the recipe was in his head!  After two other employees tried to make cheesecakes (one has a culinary degree) they could not step up to the plate...
THIS WAS MY FIRST CHEESECAKE and many customers said it was the BEST they have ever tasted.  I used the directions posted in the recipe exactly using a CONVECTION OVEN.  I am by NO means a baker/chef, just the owner's wife and it came out PERFECT!

I am very pleased with how this cheesecake turned out, it was the best one I ever made. I took reviewers advice and baked 10 min at 400 degrees and then 3hrs 10mins at 200 degrees, then let sit for about 1hr before refrigerating. I also lessened sugar by 1/4th cup, and added 1 tsp vanilla. Everyone enjoyed it very much! Thanks for the great recipe.

Great cheesecake. Ive had better but will make again! I made an oreo crust using 24 finely crushed oreo cookies and about 3 1/2 T of butter pressed into a 9" pan. I then put the crust in the freezer until I was ready for it. The 9" pan was all I had, but I would reccomend using 10" bc the cheesecake was so thick. Start with all ingredients at room temp.  Before I started, to avoid overmixing, I blended the sugar well with the flour to avoid lumps. I used 3T flour instead of the 2T in the recipe for a more cake-like texture. I also lightly whisked the eggs and yolks with the whipping cream and set aside. I creamed the cheese until smooth with my Kitchen Aid.  Then  added the flour/sugar mixture in two parts blending only until smooth.  Then added the egg/cream mixture in two parts blending till smooth. I added the 2t vanilla last and blended it in producing a thin, glossy batter. I then gently folded in 15 oreo cookies that I had quartered ahead of time. They all floated to the top and made the top of the cake really nice. I baked it for 3 hours at 200 degrees. Remember to carefully slide a knife btwn the cake and the pan to avoid the pan pulling the cake apart which will result in cracks. I let the cake cool in the oven with the door cracked for about 1 1/2 hours. When I removed the cake, it was still pretty warm. I refrigerated over night. This is important! It tasted great (after refrigeration) and the consistancy was...very dense and heavy.

Well, I followed the recipe and used the slow cooking method as suggested...came out runny/undercooked...I gave this three stars because, after finding numerous recipes that were identical to this one, the poster wasn't specific as to HOW to COMBINE the ingredients and the cooking temperature and time were off...

I am hopeful though because...a) it does have great potential...(the filling tastes incredible)...and b)the other recipes used higher heat to start for 10 minutes and c) were much more specific as to how to combine the ingredients which, as I've found out, is crucial...so, we'll see what happens!

In short, this recipe needed to be more specific...

We've made this one three times.  RITZ quality.  This is the standard by which all cheesecakes should be judged.  Very heavy and firm, but retains just enough creaminess.  You can turn this cake upsidedown in the palm of your hand without breaking it.  Great with mini-tollhouse chocolate chips stirred in.  We used the waterbath. Good no-crack recipe.

This cheesecake recipe is fantastic!  I baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, followed by 3 hours at 200 degrees (I read the reviews before I baked it).  There were no cracks on the top of the cheesecake.  The cheesecake has a delicious flavor and a light and fluffy texture.  My family loves it!  This is, by far, the best cheesecake recipe--the search for a perfect recipe is over!

This was So EASY to make.  I did some variations -they couldn't be avoided-  I opted for Vanilla Wafers, instead of graham crackers (I didn't have time to go to the store) I also attempted to lower the fat/calories and was very pleased by the outcome. Instead of Sugar, I used Splenda. I used 2 regular Philly Cream Cheese, 2 1/3 less fat Philly Cream Cheese, and 1 fat free Philly Cream Cheese. I added about 1 1/2 tsp almond extract -just to give it a surprise.  I also topped some slices w/ warm carmel, and some with cherries.   THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!!  I loved that it didn't have sour cream, for those watching the fat/calorie intake,  you can make changes, and the flavour is not affected a whole lot...great recipe!  Oh another thing I need to add. I followed the directions on cooking the cheese cake as far as the temperature, but what I did was I baked the crust first (for about 8 minutes) then I filled the crust and followed the baking directions from that point on, no problems, the crust didn't fall apart, the cheesecake didn't crack either!

I was torn between this recipe and another (based on # of reviews) but I'm glad I stuck with this one.  I live in New York and this is just as good as Juniors, one of the best cheesecakes in the city.  Next time I'll probably use either a 8 in. or 9 in. pan to get a thicker cheesecake and I plan to double the crust recipe and chill it before i bake it to hopefully avoid sogginess (i think i made my crust too thin)and also to put some on the sides to avoid it sticking to the pan...follow the directions that say bake for 3 hrs at 200 degrees and don't over mix (avoid little air bubbles on top)...they are right on!...For all those who are hesitant...I gave my friend a piece and he also had another piece of cheesecake from a local bakery.  He at them side by side and put the store brought one in the trash...he said why have a hamburger when I can have filet mingon!

I gave it a three because of the discrepancies in the directions.  Should've read more reviews while it was cooking regarding how long actual cooking time should be.  Next time I make it think I'm going to try 2.5 hours.  Although it came out good, I think the cooking time should probably be 2.5 hours.

This cheesecake was great. When I made it the first time I accidently put 2 egg whites instead of 2 egg yolks and it still turned out good except it was a little sweet in the crust. The second time I made it I used a little less sugar in the crust and a little extra flour and whipping creme. It took longer than the hour and ten minutes. but it turned out great. I made this for my class and everone loved it, even the ones that didn't like cheesecake very much. I will definetly make this again.

Definitely a winner.  Like other coments I've read, a lot of people said it was the best they've tasted.  It's a very easy recipe with a lot of room for different variations depending on what you like.  I actually read the helpul comments just as I was beginning to bake the cake as intructed in the recipe, so I ended up cutting the temperature down to 250 degrees and baking it for bout 2-2.5 hours.  I only had one oven rack so I couldn't do the water bath but I also had a perfect cake without it.  I plan to add the lemon or orange like I read in another users comments for more flavor.  Definitely a winning recipe!

This was a wonderful cheesecake! Using HisLords suggestion from 10-21-01 my cake came out beautifully with no crack across the top and no rough edges around the sides. Smooth and creamy all the way thru. Served it with Betty Crockers Raspberry Sauce, this site, only I used frozen blackberries that I had on hand. Yummy! Thanks to both the reviewer and Muffy for a great New York Style Cheesecake. The ladies at my luncheon said they had never seen such a beautiful cheesecake.

This cheesecake was so good! I didn't follow the baking directions that were given but rather I read the reviews and took the advice from one of the fellow bakers. I baked it at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes, turn off the oven, let the cake cool off in the oven with the oven door cracked for 1 hour, and then I let it chill overnight in the fridge. I had so many compliments on this cheesecake! It was so good!

Very good... similar to a "family heirloom" recipe I have lost and been looking for a substitute.  We always mix sour cream and sugar and pour on top 15 minutes before done as a finish, and also to use as a pour on topping when served.  Excellent!!

My first cheesecake and it was great.  I used a 10 x 15 sheet pan & cooked it for 30 mins.  Thanks to all the feedback advice, it came out perfect.  Try it with Supreme Strawberry Topping!!

The cheesecake was amazing! My first time making a cheesecake and I took it to a party (didn't bring any home so they must have loved it).  My husband said it was better than cheesecake factory (and a lot cheaper to make) After reading the reviews, I added 1t vanilla, cooked it at 400 for 10 minutes then at 250 for 1.5 hours.  I then used the leftover cream to make whipped cream to garnish with and strawberries with glaze to finish it off.  YUMMY

I used this recipie to make my first cheesecake. I made a few modifications. I added vanilla extract and I also used 1/2 cup of unsalted butter for the crust instead of 1/4 cup. I baked it in a hot water bath 10 minutes at 400;  1 hour 30 minutes at 250. It still wasn't done so I baked it for approximately 8 minutes at 300. It browned nicely on top and didn't crack. I also added strawberries on top. The cake turned out MARVELOUS!!!

The cheese cake was delicious!!!! My family loved. I bake the crust first for about 13-15 minutes at 350, I did this because I had bad experiences with this kind of crust and it came crispy and without breaking apart, let it cool while fixing the rest of the cheese cake.
I topped it with raspberry sauce. It needs a lot more time in the oven than what the recipe says.
Thanks for a rich, creamy cheese cake.

Very good texture, very creamy and rich.  I do not recommend the crust, too much sugar and butter.  The crust was almost brittle.  Too hard to get out of the pan.

Amazing....! I couldn't wait to eat it. Might've licked the whole mixing bowl after it went in the oven. I added a few spoonful of strawberry marmalade and baked it at 200 for 3 hours. Amazing. Thank you for sharing

Delicious and creamy! I followed some of the other reviewers advice and increased the cook time to about 3 hours and then let it cool in the oven. It was tasty and beautiful! Many compliments were given at Thanksgiving and I was proud of my first every homemade cheesecake.

I've made this cheesecake about 8-10 times perfecting the recipe. I have it down now. Don't you hate how the outside of the cheesecake is rought but the middle is creamy. Follow my adjustments and it will be same texture all the way through, nice and creamy. Also, make sure you make some restaurant style strawberry topping. Try the "supreme strawberry topping" recipe here at allrecipes.com. Adjust cooking time on it as appropriate (about 15 minutes).
 
 Cheesecake recipe adjustments:
 
 Do not cook at 400 at all! Do NOT preheat oven. Prepare according to recipe and put in springform pan. Put pan in over. Now turn over to 200. Cook for ~3 hours & 10 minutes. (give or take 10 minutes). Should be a little firm when you turn the over off, but not real firm. Turn oven off after the 3 hours and about 10 minutes. Crack oven open and let cheesecake cool in over for 1 hour (or longer if you wish). The put cheesecake in refridgerator for AT LEAST over night. Best after full 24 hours. Prepare "supreme strawberry topping" and put in refridgerator.
 
 Walla! Best cheesecake ever. Raves from friends of mine:
 
 the skeptic: "Its creamier than cheesecake factory. Its hard to compare them...Honestly, I like this better."
 
 cheesecake enthusiasts: "I used to eat cheesecake a lot. Honestly

I added a tsp of vanilla extract and it was great!...the only thing I had problems with, was the time it took to cook it.The recipe  said 1 hour but it took about a good 2 hours for the cheese to set....Other than that I will be doing it  again.

Best cheesecake recipe EVER (or at least of those I've tried, and I've tried a lot).  My only alterations were to use only 1.5 cups of sugar and bake at 200 degrees (only) for 3hr 15min per other reviews. I used a 10in pan and set a separate 13x9 pan of water on the lower oven shelf. After the baking time, I turned off the oven, cracked the door and let the cake sit in the oven until cool...then refrigerated for 12 hours.
Be sure to let all ingredients get to room temperature and use your lowest mixing speed ("Stir" on my KitchenAid mixer).  I also gently tap the filled pan on the counter a few times to release air bubbles prior to baking.  It came out ultra-smooth, creamy, perfectly textured... AMAZING!

I have to say that I have never been a big fan of cheesecake because Inever had any that were truly cheesy (no pun intended). But my hubby is an avid cheesecake lover and he thought the store bought ones weren't bad! That is until I tried this recipe. Not only will he not have anything else but I'm in LOVE!! I did read thereviews first and glad that I did because it is not cheap for these ingredients. I cannot thank HEISLORDS enough for his review on how to bake this the right way. I followed his instructions to a "T" the 1st time and it was to die for and have made it twice following his advice. The strawberry topping is a must for this and I even made blueberry topping with fresh picked blueberries and they both came out amazing. Thanks to all who contributed to this. Will be making again for family during the holidays!

OMG!  I just started baking within the past year and have made several different flavored cheesecakes that everyone loved.  I finally got a request to make a "plain" cheesecake and found this recipe.  I scanned over the reviews like I always do and adjusted according to those who appeared to have the mosts experience and those who did some of the same things I've done with other cheesecakes that I made.  Though I never got taste this cheesecake the person I made it for said that it was the best cheesecake they've ever had!  They even compared it to The Cheesecake Factory!  I'm making it again for a birthday and Christmas.  I made my adjustments according to "HEISLORD5" and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Hope this helps!

I followed recipe to the tee. Baking I did was 20 minutes more and I thought just to be safe. Needless to say it wasn't long enough. My cake was 90% firm..I will try this again and will bake a good 60 minutes longer just to be safe. The flavor was great. I am so excited to know others cooked it longer with out bad results.

I made this recipe to the letter on ingredients and it came out great! The taste is not overly sweet. I swirled in raspberry filling. You can make it or use the canned at the store both taste great. I also topped it with whipped cream. This was made into a 3 their wedding cake! The only thing I did differently was I baked the cheesecake on 200 degrees for 3-3.5 hrs and then turned the oven off. I left the cheesecake in the oven to cool with the oven with the door closed was fine. It came out perfect and no cracks. Put in the fridge for at least over night and then you can use a knife to loosen the sides. I also lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper it wax paper. I greeted the sides of the pan and the paper. Once it was cooled off in fridge and I loosened the sides with a knife, the cheesecake flipped out with no sticking. You can peel the paper off with no problems. Cut and serve!

Baked this two times and it came out perfect. I used a 9 inch pan. Very Important... Do NOT bake per recipe. You MUST follow HEISLORDS review directions.

I made this cheesecake recipe for my dad's side of the family on Easter and it was fantastic.  I topped it off with strawberry sauce in the middle and fresh strawberries to line the edges.  Everybody who ate some loved it even my aunt who does not like cheesecake.  I will definitely make it for my mom's side of the family on mother's day.  The only thing I did differently was bake my cheesecake for 3 hours instead of 1.  Overall, this recipe was a success.

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the first time I made this (yes, I did it exactly as the recipe indicated), it came out VERY undercooked.  After an hour, I took it out and wondered, why is it still moving, so I put it in for another 1hr and 30 min.  Still undercooked in the center.  After reading the comments, and remembering how long cheesecake usually takes to cook, it came out PERFECT the second time around.  I strongly encourage the person who posted the original recipe to revise it with the corrected cooking time.

I used the 2tsp of vanilla in the cheesecake mix and used less sugar for the crust.  Thanks for all the helpful tips everyone!!

Made This Last Night For The People I Work With. A Big Big Hit. One Girl Said To Me " That Is The Best Cheesecake I Have Ever Had". WonderFul Recipe, And Very Easy To Prepare. I Will For Sure Be Making This Again. I Did Read Many Reviews Prior To Making The Cheesecake. And I Prepared Mine With 1/4 tsp cinnamon in The Graham Cracker Crust, Added Tsp vanilla, And Tsp Fresh Lemon Juice To The Cake. 10" SpringForm Pan, All Ingredients At Room Temperature. Did Not Use A Water Bath. Started The Cake In A Cold Oven At 200 Degrees For 3 Hours And 15 Minutes. Ajared The Oven Door After Cooking, Leaving The Cheesecake In The Oven To Cool For 2 Hours. No Cracks, The CheeseCake Is Totally Awesome. Makes A Cook Proud With All The Compliments. I Thank You From Florida!! Great Recipe, Thumbs Up!!

Excellent!  I cooked it for 3 hours 15 minutes on 200.  I added a tsp. of vanilla and cut 1/2 c. of sugar from the batter.  The cheesecake was huge, so I may do mini cakes with the same recipe next time.

OH MY!  With slight baking modifications, this is the 8th wonder of the world!  I cannot believe how pretty this cheesecake is.  I used a 9" springform pan and after following another user's advice, I put the cheesecake in the oven then turned it on to 200 and baked it for 3 hours and 10 minutes....I didn't like the way it looked at that point so I went ahead and let it bake an additional hour, then turned the oven off, propped open the door of the oven slightly and let it cool for 1 hour.  The cheesecake is absolute perfection.  I'm afraid if everyone is following the user's advice that says to cook it only for 3 hours and 10 minutes you're going to end up with a cheesecake custard instead of a cheesecake with actual cheesecake texture. I made this for Thanksgiving and did follow the advice to make the "supreme strawberry topping" and this will be a yearly Thanksgiving and perhaps Christmas recipe from now on.  AWESOME!

This is the same exact recipe Ive used my whole life that I received from my best friend whose both parents were master bakers in NYC. It's simply the best one.  The variation by HEISLORDS are PERFECT!  I always thought the problem was my ovens in various homes I've had.  I finally got the dream kitchen and it wasn't the oven, LOL! This fixes the overdone on outside and underdone in the center with no cracks.

Oh my goodness!  My husband keeps telling me that this was the best cheesecake he's ever had.  Really creamy and delicious.  I was my first attempt at baking a cheesecake and I'll be sure to use this recipe over and over again!

TIMING IS WAY OFF! I baked mine for 10 min on 400 then  2 hrs on 200 which I increased the temp to 250 half way thru because it wasnt cooking fast enough.  I added vanilla the taste is awesome just would never be ready in one hr. Mine didnt crack and i didnt use a water bath or let it sit in the oven.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever had! It came out perfect, I followed HEISLORD5's cooking instructions. My first cheesecake ever, with no food processor for the crumbs, no electric beater for the filling, just a fork and elbow grease. If I can do it with stoneage utensils, anyone could. I also served it with homemade whipped cream.

I followed the revisions because I am a perfectionist, and it came out fabulous! I added vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg, cooked 3 hours 10 minutes on 200 degrees, and cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup in the crust. I did not use a water bath. I used the strawberry topping by the same person who submitted this recipe, and it was delicious. My family all wanted this recipe. Thank God for the Email button!! I will make this again for sure!

This recipe did not disappoint! I followed Heislord5's recommendation of baking for 3h10 mins at 200 (without preheating the oven) then turning oven off and barely cracking oven door for an hour. The cake did not crack and its texture was rich and creamy evenly through.
The only thing I will change next time, as a matter of personal taste, is to make the Graham cracker crust without the sugar; the cake and topping were sweet enough as they were. 1/2 cup for crust, 1 3/4 for cake and 1/4 for topping was just a smidgen too much for me, even for cheesecake (but no one else complained, so take that for what it's worth).

Thank you Muffy Nasner for this excellent recipe!

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly except that I did add a bit of vanilla extract. The bake time was off. I ended up baking it for about two hours. It was creamy and good, but not overly sweet.

Completely awesome!! I love to melt chocolate chips and a tablespoon of butter and drizzle over cheesecake. Then I put a bag of caramel bits and a can of Eagle Brand Milk and a stick of butter in a glass bowl. I heat at 30 second intervals til melted and drizzle caramel sauce over the cheesecake. Then I sprinkle with pecan halves! Awesome turtle cheesecake!!

I am giving this 5 stars based on the following changes from other reviews.
1. I added a bit of lemon rind and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.
2. I baked for 3 hours + 10 min. cracked the oven door open and let cool for another 2 hours before putting in the fridge.

Bar none, the best cheesecake I have ever had. There were no cracks, and it had a beautiful appearance. Everyone raved about it and said it was better than any restaurant they had been to. This is definitely a supreme cheesecake.

Awesome recipe.  I did the 200 degrees for 3 hours 10 min.  My only problem is I think the cream cheese was still too cold because I could not get the lumps out to save my life.  I knew the texture wasn't going to come out good but the flavor was still awesome.  If I got the lumps out, it would have been perfection.

THE BEST taste I´ve ever tried in a cheesecake. I used orange zest and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I baked one more hour and it was very creamy. Definetely I´ll keep experimenting with this recipe.

No changes from my prior review. Recipe is perfect. Adjust time for your oven. Awesomely dense and creamy cake. Love. 

I have made this cheesecake four times - and I finally have the cooking time right for my oven!  I follow the recipe exactly - except my oven calls for the following:

225 degrees for 3.5 hours - turn off oven and leave cake inside oven for one hour with all doors closed.  Removed cake and let it cool at room temp and then refrigerated for 24 hours.

Amazing results.  Not a crack to be had and perfectly smooth and creamy.

Last note - don't whip this batter too fast. You'll have too much air which will result in a funky top.  Blend the ingredients until smooth!

Best.  Cheesecake.  Ever.

I made this exactly following the directions.  I loved it.  I did read all of the other reviews and have decided next time I will likely cut the sugar in half in the crust and I think the filling could use a squeeze of lemon to bring out the cream cheese flavor.  I loved this cake and everyone at Thanksgiving loved it too.  I was told not to show up at get togethers without one from now on.

Although the baking time was a lot longer than the recipe stated (at 200 I baked it for about 3 1/2 hours) and I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla - Then baked it with a pan of water on the rack underneath - The taste of this cheesecake was absolutely amazing!!!! It did not crack and looked beautiful also. I will make this again!

This recipe is Fantastic! I did however use the custom cooking way of not preheating the oven and cooking it for 3hrs. It turns out wonderful. I now am requested to make this for everyones Bday. This is a beautiful full cheesecake. I love baking and have been looking for a good cheesecake . My own father didn't believe me when I said I made it. He thought I bought it from a cheesecake store that we have in town. Haha. Thank you very much!

Amazing recipe.  I doubled the ingredients for the crust so that I could have it all the way up the edges of the pan.  And as many others have stated, it takes much longer than an hour to cook.  I think I had mine in for around 3 1/2 hours and then left it to cool in an off oven for about another hour.  Very dense and rich and unbelievably tasty.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

This cheesecake is amazingly creamy!  I let my ingredients get to room temperature before beginning mixing and added vanilla for extra flavoring (I highly recommend it).  I didn't bake at 400 first!  I put in cold oven and then set oven to 200 for 3 hours 10 minutes....adjust 10-15 minutes depending on oven.  Left in oven with door cracked for approx. 1 hour then refrigerated.  YUMMY CREAMY! Enjoy!

So amazing!  I got complement after complement on this and I loved it too!  Not to heavy and not to light. I followed a few other reviewers suggestions.  I first beat the sugar and cream cheese together (careful not to overbeat) then added the rest of the ingredients plus 2 teaspoons vanilla and beat on LOW (careful not to overbeat).  I baked it for 3 hours & 10 mins at 200 and then turned off the oven and left it in for about 2 hours (would have done an hour, but I wasn't at home to take it out). We ate it the next day with the "royal raspberry cheesecake" sauce and whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  So good mmmmmm.

Absolutely fantastic even if you have never made home-made cheesecake before- I was proposed to because of this recipe, but I am already married. I followed the recipe exactly except for a few additions from other reviewers (add tsp vanilla to batter, water bath on the rack below cheesecake, definitely bake a little over 2 hours, and let sit in oven for an hour after after you turn off oven). I would like to add one more change that I had to make. The first batter I made was lumpy (looked like I put cottage cheese in the batter) so I put the next in a food processor which smoothed the batter out and also thickened it up without adding air. I had even set the cream cheese out for a while to soften. I baked 2 cheesecakes at a time: one was lumpy batter, the other processed. The processed turned out much creamier and smoother. The lumpy remained lumpy, still tasted good but felt weird when eating.

This is simply the best cheesecake I have ever had. I even impressed my Italian mother-in-law with it....I was easy recipe to follow, especially for me, a beginner to homemade cheesecake. I followed the baking directions, however after 5 minutes on 400 I turned it down to 225 for 60 to 70 minutes. Checking on it every couple minutes. Everyone absolutly loved it and begged for more.. Maybe it's to good I have been asked to make 12 cakes in the last 3 weeks. O well I am happy to make them.

Amazing! Super easy, and unbelievably delicious. I followed an earlier reviews advice, and baked the cheesecake at 200 degrees for about three and a half hours (that is how long it baked before it was at all set in the middle). The hardest part was waiting for it to chill. Thank you!

This was a very good recipe. I made the strawberry sauce to go with it that another reviewer suggested. I made it for Christmas day along with a chocolate Ganache cake. Everyone was very pleased. I did use powdered sugar instead of white sugar, and put it in the oven at 200 degrees for 4 hours. Then turned the oven off and left it alone for an hour. Not a crack in sight and creamy and even textured all the way through. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was the most amazing cheesecake I have ever eaten!!! This was better than any restaurant cheesecake I have ever had. It was so easy to make too!! I added a tablespoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of lemon juice. It added a nice flavor. Thank you for submitting this fabulous cheesecake. Now a must-have at every family funcion!!

There is too much filling for the 9" pan; next time I make this, I will add one less egg, less cream cheese and I will add vanilla. I also had to bake it 1/2 an hour longer than outlined, and it still wasn't baked thoroughly.

I've done this recipe multiple times and each time it gets better and better. To prevent breaks/cracks in the cake..I wrap the entire spring foam pan in double foil and place a baking dish  filled with water in the lower part of oven while baking. When complete turn the oven off and leave in the oven until the oven is cool.   You will love this recipe.

ok, so I made this yesterday so that it would be yummy today for Father's Day...and indeed it was.  It was very dense, and 'dry' like most New York cheesecakes are.  Very smooth texture, but also very rich.  I also increased the cooking time to 3 hours in a 200 degree oven and added a dash of vanilla to the batter before cooking.  Mine did not crack at all.  Everyone raved about the cheesecake.  The one and only thing I would do different is maybe double the crust recipe because the crust was a little thin on mine...could have been because I used a larger springform pan than I should have.  Nevertheless, this is a KEEPER.  I plan on making this again in the future.  Thanks to the one who posted this recipe!  A+++++++++++++

AAAAA MAZING! Holy Cow! I followed the directions & came out simply PERFECT....the only thing i did different was leave the cake in the oven turned off after cooking which will prevent the cracking.. This cheesecake was so creamy & smooth! It was unlike any cheesecake i have tasted before and the family i served it to called it "exquisite!"

AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!! This is the exact recipe that I've been looking for. I love cheesecake but have had trouble making them tall and creamy in the past. The only additions...some cinnamon to the crust and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the mixture. This received RAVE reviews at my house!

I've made this a couple of times, the first couple times it was creamy on the inside stiff on the outside.  The last time I made it I cooked it for 3hrs10min on 200F and it was way to mushy.  I'm sure I'll try again:)  Maybe cook closer to 4 hours?

OMG.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. I made several changes.  Reduced the sugar in the crust to 1/4 cup, prebaked for 10 min at 350.  Baked for 10 min at 400 and reduced to 200 for 3 hrs.  Turned the over off afer 3 hrs and cracked the over door for the next hour.  Really, Really good!

I want to give this 5 stars for flavor.  It has the best flavor of any cheesecake I have ever had.  BUT, it did not fully bake.  Of course I didn't find this out until the next day when serving it up.  I will make it again and bake much longer to get that middle to completely set up.

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever eaten. I have made this a dozen or so times and it is always great. If you want a low sugar cheesecake just substitute splenda for the sugar and it too comes out fantastic! I also place a cardboard cake round in the bottom of the springform pan so when done I can display it without the bottom of the pan.

I've only made this once and already its a family favorite.  My brother & sister-in-law ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was gone.  Perfect balance of creamy & texture.  I did use some of the suggestions like a little less sugar and putting a pan of water in the oven.  It did not crack but I would have loved it even if it had.

I followed the recipe, but followed other reviewers' advice on baking time.  I baked for 10 minutes on 400 and 3 hours on 200.  I didn't have time to allow the cake to cool completely in a turned-off oven with the door cracked because I needed to bake something else so I was afraid the cake would crack.  It didn't.  It turned out perfect and once it was thoroughly chilled it was the best homemade cheesecake I've ever eaten.

Great flavor but beware of the cooking time.  Prep time of 30 minutes was accurate however it had to bake at 250 for 3 hours. I then let it sit in the oven overnight, cooled in fridge after that then had it at dinner.  It was yummy.

Amazing is the only word to describe this cake.  I used other's suggestions to put the cake in the oven at 200 degrees for 3 hours and left it in the oven for an hour with the oven off.  I put it in the fridge but still got a crack in the middle, but I'm not any kind of cheesecake chef so I could have done anything wrong.  I put 2 tbsp of vanilla in it, too.  This cake was sweet and very rich... so of course I loved it.  I used the supreme strawberry topping from the site... yummmm.  I will definitely make this cake again.

Great taste and simple to make. Just make sure you have a lot of patience at let bake in the oven for the recommended amount of time. Also I highly advise to make it the day before serving to guarantee perfect consistency.

Can not tell you enough how WONDERFUL this cheesecake is! I have made it several times and it comes out the most smooth and creamiest cheesecake I have ever tasted! Every person I have served it to thinks very highly of it. 
I did add 2 tablespoons of vanilla to the recipe and baked it for 10 minutes on 400º and then turned down the oven to 200º and continued to bake for approx 3 ½ hours. Let it completely chill overnight, it is defiantly worth the wait!

OMG.  This is only the 2nd or 3rd cheesecake I've ever made in my life and it came out soooo good.  Everyone raved when I made it for Easter.  I followed the advice of the cooking time of the 10 minutes-3 hours then shut the oven off.  I was so worried that I had overcooked it because it looked and felt overdone to the touch but it was magnificent.  Just keep an eye on it in the last half hour of cooking time in case your oven is off.  I topped with lemon curd out of a jar at the market and it was amazing. Will keep this one - very easy as far as cheesecakes go !

I have been making this recipe for almost three years now. Everyone who tries it says I should try to sell them.  Each Christmas I make about 20 of them for my husband to deliver to his clients.  They love it!  
I have made it following the recipe exact, but my lemon version is the most favored/popular.
Lemon:
Add lemon zest (a little less than 1/2 a small lemon) into crust mixture.  I also either use cinnamon grahams, or add a teaspoon or so cinnamon to the crust.
Add about 1 medium or 1 1/2 small juiced lemons to batter of cheesecake.  I add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  The added lemon juice makes the batter a little thin, so I make the 1/8 of a cup of flour a "heaping" cup.  Also, once all the batter is done, just before I pour it into the pan, I add the zest of  one small lemon.  
Definently do not leave out the lemon zest, it really adds something special.  

Garnish with Cool Whip or Strawberry topping.

For cooking it, I have used 5 different ovens (moved a couple of times and made it at others homes).  Just keep a close eye on it.  No oven is the same.  When you pull it out of the oven, it will still be a jiggly.  It will continue to cook as it sits on the counter to cool. If it is not jiggly when you pull it out, then it will crack.

I am eating some as i type.Excellent!!!My husband said he doesn't remember the last time he ate something better than this.I cooked it for 3 hours,added only 1/4 cup sugar and a tad of cinnamon to the crust,vanilla and topped it with strawberries.
I'm giving it 5 stars even with the wrong cooking time because i want to make sure everyone tries this recipe.

AMAZING. This is my first real cheesecake and I was so nervous because I was making it for a party but everyone LOVED IT! You MUST follow the advice from other people though, this recipe was not written correctly. I followed the advice about the baking time: 3 hrs 10 mins at 200F then 1 hour in the oven turned off with the door open and refridgerated overnight. This was made even better by the following topping: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Supreme-Strawberry-Topping/Detail.aspx

THIS cheesecake is THE BOMB. seriously. i used chocolate graham crackers, butter and sugar for the crust and swirled my grandma's homemade strawberry jam through the cheesecake mixture before baking. i also followed the advice of another reviewer and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, then 200 degrees for three hours, then turned off the oven and cracked the oven door for an hour before putting it into the fridge. made the night before a dinner party and it was a definite hit. have tossed all my other cheesecake recipes and will stick with this one from now on, thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is the best cheesecake I ever tasted even by using the PRE-MADE GRAHAM CRACKER PIE DISH. I baked it at 200 for the 3 hours and let it cool for an hour....OMG it was so good and I didnt even use the vanilla. But I will next time.

I finally found the b-e-s-t cheesecake recipe!!  Thank you Muffy!  I make sure to let cream cheese, eggs, egg yolks and whipping cream come to room temperature before beginning.  I also added 2 t. vanilla.  I made this for my husband for his birthday.  He loved it - and, he is quite picky about his cheesecake.

Eew! I don't know if it was something I did, but this turned out horribly. I followed the directions, cooked it just right... and it turned out with a mushy, uncooked center, and tasted just about like the boxed 'quicky-fix' cheesecakes. Not worth the 600+ calories per serving; I'm not impressed and more than likely won't attempt this again.

Very nice and creamy but we thought it too sweet and I omited the sugar in the crust. Had no problems with the bake time just left the door closed. I made another cheesecake the same day with a sour cream top layer that we thought was much better. Topped both with fresh berries mixed with vodka, sugar and vanilla. Now that was very good.

This is truly the best cheesecake i have ever tasted and this is definitely the only cheesecake recipe I will ever keep. really really really goooood! Thank you for this recipe! We will probably never buy  cheesecake outside again since we can make the best at home! thanks!

This was one of the best cheesecake recipes ever.  I omitted the sugar completely from the crust and used a bit less in the recipe and it was plenty sweet.  In fact, unless you enjoy sitting down to a bowl of sugar this cheesecake is rich and tasty.  I didn't want as big of a recipe so I scaled down to 6 servings...not rocket science.  Definitely try this recipe out.  If you do it right you will enjoy it.

This was the worst cheesecake I have ever tasted. WIth this recipe you can not scale the ingridients down for a smaller serving size. It wasnt sweet enough for me. I think Im going to stick to my own cheesecake recipe.

Definitely not the best I've had. I wish I'd listened to the others about reducing the sugar. I did, however, bake it for 3 hours instead of one. It still came out a little softer than I prefer. I think I'll stick with my grandmother's tried and true recipe. Thanks though...

This was my very first attempt in making a cheesecake from scratch. I made one for Thanksgiving, came out perfect.  Made it again for Christmas, again, perfect, oh so yummy! ( I made sure cream cheese was really soft, and eggs were at room temperature). Based on reading reviews, did not beat hard! Used 1/4 cup sugar for crust, and 1 1/2 cups sugar for filling.  Heavenly!!

I'm wondering if the temperature on this recipe is incorrect. Tried recipe twice; both times resulted in uncooked cheesecake. Should the temp have been reduced to 300 instead of 200 degrees F?

I made this for Easter.This is the best cheesecake recipe ever! It was so easy to make for such great results!  I had no problem following the recipe.  The key I've learned in the past w/ cheesecakes is to let the cream cheese, egg, & cream sit out to room temperature before working w/ it.  I'm so glad I followed a prev. poster's suggestion to bake at 400 deg. for 10 min then 200 for 3 hrs. Let sit in oven w/ door cracked for another hour then refrigerate for 24 hrs.  No cracks, nice & creamy. PERFECTION!!
I'm making another one this week for my friends!
Thank You Muffy!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.BUT DID FOLLOW ADVICE ON BAKING.DIDNT USE WATER BATH.DIDNT PREHEAT OVEN.COOKED AT 200* FOR 3 HOURS AND 10 MINUTES.TURN OFF OVEN,PROP DOOR,LEAVE IN FOR ANOTHER HOUR,LET COOL ON COUNTER UNTIL COOLED THEN PUT IN FRIDGE FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE REMOVING FROM PAN.I ALSO REDUCED SUGAR TO 1/4 C IN CRUST. AND I DID ADD 1 1/2 TSP OF VANILLA TO THE BATTER. INGREDIENTS WERE AT ROOM TEMP. AND MAKE SURE MIXTURE IS SILKY SMOOTH! VERY IMPORTANT FOR A CREAMY RATHER THAN GRAINY PIE.SO MIX,MIX, MIX. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!

This is an awesome recipe that you can vary in tons of different ways.  
It works much better if you bake at 450 for 15 minutes and then turn down to 300 for another 1 1/2 -2 hours or until center is set.

I did not change a THING in the directions. Even cooked for 2hrs 10 min and no cracks, no brown spots.. nothing! I don't know why so many other people had so many problems! Hubby put a piece in the freezer so he could eat it within an hour and not have to wait the 24 hours in the fridge! So rich and better than The Cheesecake Factory!

This would have been 5 stars, but I had to follow the suggestions in the reviews in order for it to turn out properly.  Since I only had one cup of graham cracker crumbs, I substituted the other half cup with finely crushed Arrowroot biscuits. I added 2 tsp of vanilla to the batter as suggested, and baked for 3 hours 10 minutes at 200 degrees. I then let it cool in the oven for a while before sprinkling the top with chocolate flakes and relocating it to the refridgerator. I let it cool in the fridge for about 36 hours before giving it to my boyfriend as a birthday cake and it tasted fantastic. It was still less solid than I would have liked in the middle, though. I might experiment with this recipe in the future.

I have never made a cheesecake before this one...and let me just say, it's awesome!  I was paranoid about under/overbaking, consistancy, etc, but it turned out perfect and tasted great.  My co-workers could hardly believe that I did it!  I used a waterbath and turned the oven off at the end and let the cake cool inside the oven for ~3hours before taking out.  Slow cooling is key!  Try this one out, you won't be disappointed!

I made this cheesecake this weekend and although I didn't get to try it, everyone just raved as to how fabulous it was!  They said it was very thick and rich but just perfect, definitely will make again.  I did bake it for over 3 hours at 200 and it turned out great!

The flavor of this cheesecake was excellent, but I should have read the previous notes on baking times.  I was on the phone when the timer went off, so didn't bother to test the cake; I just turned the oven off and propped the door open.  The entire center of the cake was still very loose.  I took it out and let it cool throughly and then refridgerated it overnight.  The texture improved dramatically (it wasn't so liquid-like), but never firmed above a fluffy whipping cream consistency.  I'm going to give it another try, though; the flavor really was fantastic.  I put a 1/2 tsp of almond extract in the batter and a little cinnamon in the crust, just to add interest.

I did a prelim. review as this cheesecake was still in the oven much longer than the recipe called for, but did not get until now with the results.  Absolutely YUMMY.  I will bake for longer next time, but I really have never tasted a better cheesecake.  I generally don't make them since I have never had one knock my socks off, but this one does.  A few weeks after I made it, we picked up a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake for company (I was short on time) and found that this one was WAY Better!  Thanks for a no fail recipe (aside from baking time)

This recipe is awesome.  Came out better than any other that I have tried.  I cooked it a for about 50 minutes and then turned off the oven and opened the door an inch.  No cracks in the top.  Definately a favorite!!!

I used this recipe to bake this cheesecake for an office pitch-in. My co-workers raved about for days!  Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had!  It was a big hit that day and I will definitely prepare this cheesecake again and again!  Nancy W.

I am giving it three stars because it did taste very good.  I followed the directions exactly and still had a very uncooked center (about three inches in diameter!).   So I cooked it an additional 25 minutes,  It was still very mushy in the middle.  This was for my sister-in-law's birthday, so I was a bit disappointed.

Outstanding. This cheesecake was such a hit I was amazed.  I love to bake so much that I bake a different kind of cake every week and take it into work.  Well, this cake went faster than any other cake I ever brought in.  Thanks for the recipe.

Incredible!!  I added 2 tsp vanilla extract to the batter and a little extra butter to the crust.  Baked it as instructed but then a little longer at 350 and left it in the oven for a little while after I turned it off.  Will be trying it with a sour cream topping shortly.

I question the 200 degree temp.  I baked it at that temp as per instructions and it was not cooked in the center after an hour.  Had to bake it an extra 40 minutes at 350 degrees.

Extremely similar to McCall's Ultimate Cheesecake recipe (hmmmm).  Adjust cook time and crust ingredients as everyone suggested.  For a different tasting crust, through a half cup of old fashioned oatmeal (uncook) in a blender til fine and add to graham cracker mixture.

I tried this recipe. It went over well. I did add the zest of one full lemon, and I tried something slightly different.. I took a can of strawberry filling blended it slightly in the blender (to break up the large pieces)...then when the crust was done baking I poured the strawberry filling on the bottom of the crust. I then poured the lemon zested cheesecake filling over it, and proceeded to bake it. I did add a few minutes to the original cooking time. Mine had no cracks and the strawberry filling on the bottom was very good. Its a pretty sliced cheesecake that way.

Simple recipe, cook time and temperature needs to be increased.  I cooked at 400 degrees for 10 mins then 325 degrees for 65 mins, I let cake cool in the oven.

I had NEVER made a cheesecake before this one, so I was a total amateur.  On my first try, I baked two cheesecakes for 15 people.  They all LOVED it!  Some said, "This is home-MADE?!", others said, "I usually don't like cheesecake, but I LOVE this!", still others said, "Mmmmmmmm, delicious!"  I put flaming cherries jubilee ontop and added a 1/4 cup of ground hickory nuts in the crust -- both wonderful additions.  The only thing that surprized me was the cooking time; I cooked them for 3 hours, but it may have been a little too long, as I had some small cracks in the pies after letting them refrigerate over night.  I LOVE this recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake, and the results were positively spectacular.  More than one person who tried it said it was the best they had ever eaten.  Given that I'm really not that great a cook (yet), I credit the recipe.  Right on target!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted.  The people I have made it for say the same thing.  I also think you should use less butter and no sugar in the crust.  I bake the cheesecake for 2 hours and 10 minutes at 250 degrees (after 10 minutes at 400 degrees).  It still has major cracks in it when cooled, but the taste makes up for it!

I read the reviews before making this cake and decided to omit the white sugar in the crust.  I also increased the temperature by 50 degrees and baked it for about 1.5 hours.  This turned out to be an excellent cheesecake!

After looking through the 200 recipes for cheesecakes, I finally baked this one. I'm so glad I did. It made my Easter!!!! You don't see many recipes using 5 pkgs. of cream cheese. It was the very best cheesecake I have ever made. All my guests agreed with me. They still rave about it.

Very good...even the kids loved it. My cheesecake should have cooked a little longer than what the recipe called for...it was not completely done in the middle. Next time I will need to cook it for an additional 15 minutes.

This is a very rich cheesecake (and I thought I used a lot of cheese in mine- with 4/8 oz. pkgs)! The richer - the better!  Thank you Muffy, from an old timer at making cheesecakes in Las Vegas, by way of Oregon.

The form didn't hold and I assume it didn't cook long enough. I will be trying this recipe again with a slightly longer bake time and see if I can improve the form. The taste was amazing though!

Followed directions- except I used crushed oreos( vanilla) instead of graham crackers. It was divine. Looking for a raspberry topping to top.

I made this for a birthday.   Everyone loved it!  I did made a mistake.  I accidentally added too much flour.  It called for 1/8 c.  I used 1/2 c.   When it was done cooking as directed it was not finished cooking.  Not firm at all.  I left it in the oven at 200°f for another hour and half.  It came out perfectly after that.  It made a lot. I made a 10in. Spring form pan. Then I made another cracker crust for a 8in square pan which was not as thick since it was what was left.

This is a great cheesecake.  The baking method is great...no domes and no cracks.  I made a couple adjustments though.   I added vanilla to the cheesecake mix and cinnamon to the crust.   For a fun layer, take sour cream, sugar and vanilla mix it up and let it sit while the cheesecake is baking.   When the cheese cake is set, take it out of the oven, turn the oven up to 500 degrees, pour the sour cream mixture in an even layer on the top of the cheesecake.   Bake for 5 minutes @ 500 degrees.   It very pretty when cut.

Best cheesecake I've ever made. I love the creaminess! I've made it for friends and they all ask for the recipe. I baked the cake at 200 degrees for an hour, then turned off the oven and let it sit inside, with the oven door closed, for another 3 hours. Perfection! No cracking, no falling, and no brown crust. Just a lovely, smooth, uniform finish.

This is the first cheesecake I’ve ever attempted.  It turned out great.  I did the 200 deg for 3hrs everyone mentions and 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 1.75.  It was plenty sweet. Next time I’ll get some of those cardboard rounds for the bottom.

I still go by the 400° for 10 minutes, but then I turn it down to 200° for another 3 hours. Without the other reviews this recipe would be “How to make expensive garbage.” But with the other reviews it’s the best cheesecake I have ever eaten. I’m making 5 today. It was requested by a friend for a fundraiser dinner. It’s that good.

This was outstanding.  I made it for Easter and everyone raved about it.  I did follow the suggestion of baking it at 200 for 3 hours and 10 minutes and then leaving it sit in an open turned off oven for another hour - perfect.  The only problem I had was my cream cheese did not completely blend - I had little clumps of cream cheese.  It did not affect the taste and I think I either did not let it come to room temperature or I needed to blend longer.

Recipe is great! The only ingredient change was for the crust; reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup. I also followed the baking instructions from Brad Reynolds. Worked fantastic. I did not make the Supreme strawberry topping.

Disappointing. I made this cheesecake using the suggestions of other reviewers. (Did not preheat the oven, Allowed all ingredients reach room temperature including eggs and cream cheese, Baked on 200, baked for 3 hours, Left to cool for one hour with oven door cracked open)  I also added caramel and chocolate to the top after chilling in the fridge over night.  I had a couple of big issues. 1) the crust stuck to the pan bottom when slicing the cheesecake 2) it has an “eggy” flavor that I’ve never experienced with other recipes unless they were over baked.                                                               I will try this recipe again and adjust my review if it turns out differently. Considering the popularity of this recipe, it’s worth another try.

very good.  i did follow the directions of a review.  baked at 200 degrees for 3.5 hrs without preheating.  no water bath.  i also added crushed Oreo cookies and did an Oreo cookie crust.  delicious.  center was set perfectly.  creamy, dense, fluffy.  perfect.  only drawback was that the batter makes way more than what will fit in a 7 inch spring-form pan.  i used a 9 inch spring-form pan and it went to the very tippy top.

I made the changes the reviewer suggested cooking it 3 hours and 10 minutes at 200 degrees.  It was absolutely perfect!  No cracks, nice and creamy.  The reason for 4 stars is personal preference, it was too creamy not firm enough. I will try the recipe again and cook it a little higher heat.  My family loved it with the strawberry sauce .  Try it!

I got nothing but high praise over this cheesecake and NO cracks. One lady said it deserved 10 stars. I followed the directions exactly as above except I didn't crack the oven door. I left the door closed once i turned it off in the oven until I new it was cool ... it was 4hrs for me then I refrigerated it. Also once the batter was mixed I lightly dropped the pan on the counter 3 to 4 times to remove any air bubbles. Make sure all ingredients are room temp and don't over beat batter especially when adding eggs. Great CAKE creamy and light.!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made!!  I did bake it at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes.  Then let it sit for 1 hour in the oven with door lightly open.  I then let it cool to room temperature and put in the refrigerator for 24 hours!  I topped it with a sour cream frosting and strawberries just before serving.....and oh my was this good!!  It literally melts in your mouth!!

This recipe turned out beautifully and delicious! I added a couple little touches - cinnamon in the crust and vanilla in the batter, but that was just a matter of taste. The only problem I had with the recipe was the cook time. It took about twice as long as the instructions said, and I kept have to adjust the temp as well to avoid burning. The next time I make this I will likely let it bake at 400 for longer than 10 min, then turn down to 250 instead of 200 for the duration of bake time.

My entire family loved it!  I have made it a few times now, once with sweet Potato pie mix swirled in the cheesecake batter and after it set  I topped it with caramel and served chopped candied pecans on the side.  

I also add a little fresh lemon juice to the batter  and I omit the two egg yolks.  I use 1/3 cup of sugar for the crust and 6 tablespoons of butter.

This has been my go-to recipe for New York style cheesecake since it first appeared in Better Homes and Gardens's Heritage Cook Book around 1975.  I've made it at least a 100 times with never a failure and needed no adjustments to the recipe. I do bake in the traditional method using a water bath and allowing the cake to cool in the oven, with the door open, for about an hour prior to moving to the cooling rack.  The creamy texture and cheese taste makes this what I expect when I bite into a cheesecake. Favorite toppings are blueberry and cherry, but I have used lime and lemon curd successfully. Always receiving rave reviews, in my opinion, it is superior to any cheesecake I've eaten, even in NYC.  Thank you for sharing an old favorite!

I have made this cheesecake several times and always receive rave reviews. I made three of these and brought them into a potluck at work I now have people asking me if they can pay me to make cheesecakes for them. The only change I make, is I add a little bit of vanilla extract.

Perfection!  My son in law who is a cheesecake expert said it was the best he has tasted in a long time.  I did follow the 3 hours 10 minutes at 200 degrees after so many had suggested that.  Well worth the extra time!

Turned out fine but we were not fans. It was not that classic texture, it was more fluffy.  My son wanted a cheesecake instead of birthday cake this year for his birthday.  He was disappointed as were the rest of us.

After following the suggestions from other reviews to change the baking temperature and time, this cheesecake (my first) was perfect!  I baked at 200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes and turned off the oven and opened the door a bit. After one hour, I put the cheesecake in the fridge.

I loved this truly NY cheesecake.  Yes, its rich, yes its got some calories but you don't have to eat a huge portion.
I made it twice and all my guests wanted the recipe which I directed them to this page.
Loved it!

I made this & I love it as long as you follow the reviewers which is the to leave it at 200 for the 3 hours. I also leave it in the oven longer to set for two hours, and add some lemon & vanilla extract. I don't really measure - so maybe just a splash of both. Probably one of the best cheesecakes you will ever make if you like a really dense New York type. So far the cheesecake types that have tried it in my family LOVE it, and have always asked me to make it for get togethers.

Great cheesecake.  The cooking time threw me so I hope the author will consider modifying the entry because many (like me) don’t always read the reviews (and adding 2 plus hours to cooking time is a big deal). I also added some lemon zest and vanilla which I think are a must.  It was a hit.

I have made this recipe 3 times the last 3 Christmas dinners. I've been told it's the best cheesecake my family has ever tasted. I would tell people to read the most popular review by Brad Reynolds if you want the cheesecake to be a success, and his strawberry topping is simple and very good. Always read the reviews of these recipes to find out  what mistakes were made in posting a recipe, or you might waste your time and effort.

Best cheesecake I ever made.  I used a 10.5 " springform  pan.  I doubled the crust portion of the recipe.  Baked 400 degrees for 10 minutes, reduced temp to 200 & baked for 3 hours.  Left in oven until cooled.  No cracks - the top was perfect!

Great recipe! But it takes a lot longer than an hour for filling to set. More lime 2-3. It tasted great and was a hit at my house. Making it for Thanksgiving.

I added some vanilla and lemon flavoring. Otherwise I followed the recipe, except I baked it at 300 instead of 200 degrees for an hour. It rose beautifully, and after it cooled for 20 minutes I was able to remove the outside of the springform pan and cut it and eat it. It was not at all runny or soft in the middle. Perfect New York style cheesecake.

So, this was my first time making a cheesecake and it tasted really good, but for some reason it turned out really runny. I followed the recommended instructions in the comments and baked it at 200 for 3 hours, left it to cool in the oven for 1 hour, and then left it in the fridge overnight. It tasted and looked great but when I cut it it wasn't firm and kind of fell apart. This was my first try at cheesecake so I will try again and hopefully it turns out better!

Unfortunately I didn't my read the reviews before making this and ended up watching the oven for 3+ hours instead of one wondering if I did something wrong!  The cheesecake itself turned out okay but kind of soft in the middle and thoroughly baked around the edges

I normally don't write reviews, but with this recipe,  I had to. As long as you follow the revisions mentioned by other reviews:
Cream chesse, eggs, heavy cream at room temperature. Put cheesecake in a cold oven and bake at 200 degrees for 3hrs and 10 min. Crack oven and let sit for an hour before taking out. place in refrigerator for 24hrs. I also used 2 tablespoons of Amaretto instead of vanilla. I also tried the recipe with an oreo crust as well (I haven't garnished or eaten it yet). Man, it came out soo creamy and delicious and there were no cracks at all (I did not use a water pan either). next time, I will try with Lime juice in the batter for a Key Lime Cheesecake

I’ve made this several times and it is amazing. I left it in the oven for several hours after as several people said, and it turned out perfect.

After reading reviews for an hour, I decided to make this. I cannot tell you how much my husband loved it!! I did what everyone else did and cooked at 200 for 3 hours 15 mins, turned oven off, cracked door for an hour then stuck in fridge. I also added a dash of vanilla. after you put in fridge leave in the fridge for at least 18 hours before serving :)

This is simply the best cheesecake youll ever make or eat. 

Make sure your ingredients are room temp and take the directions seriously and you'll have a cheesecake better than anyone, anywhere!

We enjoyed it.  I did change the crust into brownies because that is what I had and I made a strawberry sauce that went very well with it.  I will make it again

Would have been 4 or 5 star but was making from the app on my fridge and could not see the reviews. Will definitely try this again soon!

I make a lot of recipes but I rarely rate one. I have been baking for 40 years now, and this cheesecake is the absolute best I have ever made or eaten. Very easy recipe to follow also. I made one this weeks and everyone is wanting to know when the next one will be ready!

I followed some of the suggestions in previous reviews.  3 hours 10 minutes at 200, added vanilla, let it sit before putting in fridge.  So can't really say how it was before the changes but it was a home run!   Everyone at the family gathering said it was the best they have ever had.  I've never made cheesecake before and I had to do the cream cheese portion over b/c my ingredients were not room temp.  So after some research, I I found you just mix the cream cheese first to nail the consistency (the first batch was lumpy as all get out) and make sure it's room temp.  So then i added the sugar and mixed again.  Man it was good.  Thank you op for this most excellent recipe!!!

This cheesecake turned out perfect! The only  reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is because  you have to do as other reviewers say and cook at 200 for 3 hours then crack the oven door for an hour. I have tried making cheesecakes for a long time now and they have never turned out until now.

I make this recipe several times a year...DO follow the helpful comments that have you add two tsp vanilla and bake @200 degrees for 3 hours and 10 minutes, then turn oven off and prop the door open for another hour.  Perfect every time!

I made this cheesecake last week and it turned out good.  As others suggested, I put a pan of water on the bottom rack, put the cheesecake in a cold oven (on the middle rack, not in the water) and set temp to 200 degrees and baked for 3 hours and 1o min. When I checked it, it was very undercooked in the middle, (jiggled a lot), but it did not have any cracks, which was good. So, I turned the oven up to 350 degrees and baked another 30 min. and then turned the oven off and went to bed. Two hours later, I took it out of the oven and it was done and only had 1 crack on the top near the edge. My husband took this to work, so I did not eat any, but there wasn't any left and he said it was delicious.

Make sure you really let the cream cheese warm to room temperature. I recommend creaming just the cream cheese first as it's likely to get clumpy otherwise.

This was an absolute disaster as written. Either change the original directions for the necessary cook times etc or remove this. It was like cake batter. Worst recipe directions ever. If you want to follow the reviewers recommendations, great, but all these high ratings are not a reflection of the recipe. So disappointing.

I would absolutely make this again, but with less sugar in the crust. Yes, it did have to bake longer than the stated time. I made it plain, then served it with a variety of toppings (caramel sauce, dark chocolate, and strawberries) and it was loved and devoured by all.

I followed the suggestion from the comments and my family absolutely loved the cheesecake. I added vanilla to the batter and cooked the cheesecake at 200 degrees for 3 hours and rest in oven for an hour. No cracks and all around amazing texture. Will use this recipe again!!

I did really enjoy the recipe and thought the taste was splendid. I served it for a Thanksgiving party and in a few minutes it was gone! I decided to make it alongside a strawberry sauce recipe and topped it with leftover strawberries. That being said, I did make tweaks and notice a few issues.

1. I obviously didn't grease the pan but I should have, it stuck badly to the sides and I had to use a knife to scrape the sides off the springform pan in order to prevent the entire thing from cracking. 

2. I added a few drops of vanilla extract to the mixture for a nicer flavor.

3. Once I put the pan in the fridge, it unfortunately dripped and forced me to throw out some fruits that I had on the rack below it. It also dripped out while on my lap on the way to the Thanksgiving party. Next time I will cover the bottom with aluminium or put it on some type of serving platter before putting it in the fridge however the mess it left was inconvenient and sticky. 
 
Otherwise it turned out perfectly and I now want to bake one just to have for myself!

Better than any cheesecake I've ever eaten, from a bakery or restaurant.  Everyone wanted the recipe.
Reading other comments, I did have to bake longer.  Pre-heated and baked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Lowered to 200 degrees, but it wasn't done in an hour, more like an hour and 30 minutes.  Definitely refrigerate overnight.

BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!   OH my goodness.  I followed the advice in the reviews and baked it at 200 for around three hours and then let it cool for an hour in the oven.  No water bath.   Refrigerate overnight...   So creamy and light.  From center to edge it is sheer perfection.  Comments from my guests included  "This could be at Cheesecake Factory" and "This is better than Cheesecake Factory." "This is my new favorite dessert"  and lots of Mmmmm Mmmmmm

Absolutely the best!  Used Oreo crumbs instead of graham crumbs and cooked 200 degrees for 3 hrs with a pan of water on the lower rack.  Delicious smooth texture, no cracks and unmolded from pan beautifully!

This was so delicious! My sister requested a cheesecake for her birthday this year instead of the traditional cake like I'd usually make, so I got to searching. There are so many different recipes! But I chose to try this one, and am so glad I did! The only changes I made were to add a couple teaspoons of vanilla (personal taste preference), and I chose to bake it at 200° for 3 hrs- only because I didn't want it to brown on top! ;) I had cherry pie filling to put on top, per the birthday girl's request, and made some raspberry filling to go on top for those who prefer that. It was seriously so good! Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they'd ever had! My uncle even said he doesn't really like cheesecake, but he loved this one! Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at made from scratch cheesecake. It turned out beautifully! However, the reviews are correct about the cooking time. At least 3 hours at 200 degrees.

The cheesecake is delicious.  One hint would be to beat the cream cheese very well on its own and add one egg at time beating well after each addition.

This didn't come out good at all. It was too eggy and too sweet. There was too much crust/batter for a 9" pan. I had enough to make a second crust, so I did. There was just enough filling to make two 3/4 full cheesecakes. I only used 1c of sugar, instead of the 1 3/4c the recipe called for, and it was still way too sweet. The cheese flavor was completely lost in the sugar. I cooked the two cakes one at a time, but the consistency was way off. Perhaps due to the amount of egg? In any case, no way I was presenting it to my grandmother. It all went in the trash and I had to buy one from my local bakery. :/

I made this recipe and loved it.  After reading a few reviews, I decided to bake it at 200 degree for 3 hours 10 minutes. I allowed it to cool for 2 hours in slightly cracked oven. I also added 2 tsp. Vanilla to the recipe. I  topped it with the strawberry supreme recipe that's on this website.

I would say this is a good cheesecake and you should make it if you have a good blender. My blender sucks and when the cake came out there were cheese cream clumps.

I actually have some on order.

Looked at a lot of other recipes and like how this one was not tangy from sour cream or lemon. 
I have made it twice now and the texture is always light and creamy.
I did add the two teaspoons of extract  others had suggested. If you don't, it taste like something is missing. I enjoy a combination of one tsp of vanilla and one tsp of almond.
I baked mine  at 200F  for 3 hours. I have accidentally baked one for 6 hours and the only difference in the two was the later was firmer to the touch. The inside texture was the same and had the same great taste.
This will always be our family's cheesecake recipe.

With the help of other comments, this is the best cheesecake I've ever made. Changes:

1. Add more butter to the crust and no sugar, bake the crust for 10 minutes at 350 before and let cool completely.
2. substitute powdered sugar for granulated sugar in the batter. Add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. Increase flour to 1/4 cup from 1/8 cup.
3. Don't use a water bath (because no matter how hard I try, I can't keep the water out of the springform) instead put a pan of boiling water in the oven while the cheesecake bakes.
4. Start with a cold oven and then bake for 3 hours and 10 minutes at 200 degrees.

It's probably best to let the cheesecake cool in the oven but we didn't do that this time and it didn't fall or crack. We did let it cool on the counter before placing it in the fridge.

These notes are more for myself because I do love this recipe and will definitely be making it again. Thanks to all the comments that help make it the best ever! I can't wait to experiment with flavors.

Hands down the best cheesecake I have ever made.
Followed suggestions of other reviews: added vanilla to cream cheese mixture, did not pre heat oven, cooked at 200 degrees for 3 hours 10 min.  My cheesecake was fluffy and no cracks!

I have been told this is the ONLY way I'll make cheesecake going forward.  DELICIOUS!

Too sweet - not enough cheese flavor.  Crust was really good though and I use it for my other cheesecake recipe.  I did these in mini cheesecake pans.  I put a large cupcake paper in the bottom of the pan and it worked fabulously.  I baked in a water bath for one hour and turned the oven off for one hour.    You should try it and form your own opinion.

This recipe is BY FAR the BEST THING EVER! I've made it countless times (my family goes bananas for cheesecake), and never have had a cracked top. No water bath needed, no gross overcooked outside edge. Just pure delicious smooth cheesecake. The only adjustment I've made is after the 1 hour of baking on 200 degrees, the cake stays in the over for another hour or so. This eliminates the cracked top from a sudden temperature change from the oven to room temp. And of course, serving the cheesecake a day later. It's WAY better that way. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is the first time I've used this recipe. Sad to say I will not make this again. There's way too much sugar. After adding all the eggs and extra egg yolks it just turned chunky. I whipped the batter for a few and it still was chunky. 325-350° for 1 hr is all you need. This 400 for the first 10 actually made the top crunchy. After that weird temp I cooked it the way I know instead. The only good part was the graham cracker crust. After baking, cooling, setting, and refrigerating the texture came out like a rice pudding. I'm sorry but I don't like this recipe.

Supreme indeed! I was a bit skeptical because I never made a cheesecake that didn't call for sour cream to be folded in. I was also Leary of the cooking time and oven temp...don't be!! I  followed recipe (only change was adding 1tsp of vanilla) but I did follow others suggestion about 200 degree oven, no preheat for 3+ hours. After about 3 hours 20 min I turned oven off (was firm BUT still a tiny bit giggly when I shook the pan a little) and didn't open door for another 30 min or so.  Really cooked perfectly. 

Cheesecake looks beautiful-no cracks!! And tastes even better than it looks :) I will, however, use less sugar for the crust next time but that's really the only change I would make.

**Edit** my son said its the best cheesecake I've ever made and says the crust is excellent... his girlfriend said its the best cheesecake she's ever had!

I made this cheesecake and it was a hit! My husband loves strawberry cheesecake and I made a different recipe,  which came out awful! Good thing I read the previous reviews and made adjustments to my cheesecake accordingly because it came out tasting amazing on my first try. I suggest you read the reviews for instructions on making this cheesecake, before you just dive in. Other than that enjoy!!

I made this recipe for my nephews birthday and it was a winner!  This is now my go to recipe for cheesecake.   I used the Supreme Strawberry Topping recipe to go with it.  It was super easy compared to other cheesecake recipes and as always, I put it in a water bath.  This for me is a tried and true method and my cheesecakes come out perfect.  A suggestion, this recipe definitely took longer than the hour and ten minutes to cook, I believe when all was said and done it took about an hour and 40 minutes.  I believe this all depends on your method of baking and the length of time may have been attributed to the water bath. All ovens are different in my experience, gas and electric can often make a difference. No matter, I still got a great cheesecake and adjusted the recipe for baking time for future use.

this is a five star recipe if you read the reviews!! following the recipe doesn't cut it. do not cook at 400 at all! 200 for 3 hours is the ticket! i also added some vanilla extract!

I've made this cheesecake twice, and it came out superb both times. I also followed Brad G Reynolds' instructions for baking. And for the topping I used the Supreme Strawberry Topping Recipe and used  fresh peaches instead of strawberries.

I followed The Cake Maker's suggestion.  Added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and baked 3 hours 10 minutes in a non preheated oven at 200 degrees.  After the 3 hours and 10 minutes, turn off the oven,  prop open the oven for an hour and then refrigerate for 24 hours. It turned out PERFECT!

First off I would like to thank Brad Reynolds for his PERFECT recommendations on how to make this the most wonderful cheesecake I have ever tasted or baked.  The receipe is great, I edited it a bit however, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon juice to the filling.  I also added 1.5 tsp nutmeg to the crust.  But other then that I followed the receipe to the tee and Brad's baking instructions and the cake turned out absolutely PERFECT!!!!   No cracks, smooth and creamy and very heavy!   Beautiful, I will make my cheesecakes like this from now and follow Brads baking directions for ALL my cheesecakes.   Thank you Brad!

I was responsible for bringing a cheesecake to a family gathering. My Mother-in-Law is an amazing cook and I always try to impress her with something I have learned.  This was my very first cheesecake in a springform pan. I made a 9" cheesecake.  I crushed up my own honey maid graham crackers for the crust and followed the ingredients to the letter except for adding 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbsp of lemon juice and I also did the 200 degrees for 3hrs 10min turning off the oven and then leaving the cheesecake in the propped open oven for an hour after that.  I then put it in the refrigerator for about 16 hrs and took it to the gathering.  It was perfect!!!  I was told by every family member, including my Mother-in-Law that it was the best cheesecake they had ever had.  Every piece was claimed.  This recipe is easy and positively delicious!!!  Thank you Muffy!!!

I decided to learn how to make cheesecakes after a recent purchase and this recipe was my first cheesecake that didn't come out of a box. The directions were easy to follow. The only thing I was not sure about was the cooking time...since it stated or until filling is set, I cooked it 1 hour longer then removed it from the oven to cool.  The filling looked set...it was no longer jiggly looking!  The cheesecake came out perfect, no cracks and it smelled wonderful! Once cooled and sliced up we brought in the New Year with an absolutely wonderful New York style cheesecake!

I tried this recipe followed it the letter.  But the problem I have is the center never cooked. Baked it for 1 1/4 hrs. I'll try making it again let it bake for 1 1/2 hrs. I think the problem was I didn't let the cream cheese come to room temp before starting.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted. I accidentally used only 3/4 cups of sugar and the recipe calls for 1  and 3/4, but it came out fine! The slight downside is that only cooking it for 1 hour 10 minutes is not enough bc it was a tad bit undone like everyone else is saying.  So I would suggest baking it for maybe a half hour longer.

Amazing. I made this cheesecake with no modifications and it turned out great. Super rich, super sweet. A little too sweet for my taste, but that's just me; my family LOVED it.. I used baker's (fine) sugar rather than regular granulated, but don't know if that made a huge difference in the filling, I just had some on hand and used it. I had to cook it (in a water bath) for about 30 minutes longer than recommended, then turned the oven off to let it set for 30 minutes. I let it cool in the fridge for a few hours before I served it for my son's birthday-due to my poor planning I couldn't let it chill overnight, but it was very close to being completely set, and the next morning it was perfect. This is my go-to cheesecake recipe from now on. No cracking, no sticking, beautiful!   A side note, I'm a slow preparer so my oven had been preheated to 400 degrees for quite some time, which helped the oven get back to temp faster after putting the cheesecake in than it would have otherwise. I'm not sure why it seems so many had trouble with the cooking - if you wait patiently until it reaches the right consistency (I call it a firm jiggle, which is probably confusing), then it's set! The recommended time is simply a recommendation, all sorts of factors play into the time needed to cook. It could take way longer than planned, but patience pays off with this cheesecake. Love!

For me it did not bake in 1 hr( middle was just as raw). Also doesn't say what best % M.F % moisture of cream cheese  to use. What Eggs size? This recipe is  not for first timers.

Love love love this recipe. Directions are very simple. Must follow Heislord's directions for baking though. Comes out perfect. Also probably about the only thing I would change is the amount of sugar in the crust, it's a little much in my opinion. I would also double the crust or make a little more just so the bottom is thicker and can go up sides a bit more just because the cheesecake itself is pretty thick. Other than that it is an amazing cheesecake.

Like others , I followed the basic suggestions of Heislord5-- 3hrs at 200F , 2 hrs with oven cracked and a water bath in the rack beneath. I used a 10" springform and followed the BRILLIANT suggestion of a reviewer to place a greased cake circle ( foiled ) in the bottom ! Genius ! Cake was smooth , , not a crack to be found. I garnered a lot of praise , , and gave AR all the credit. Worth the time.

I did modify this slightly. But it is great the way it is. Now, I make the best cheesecake anyone has tasted. I do the slow cook method.

I haven't taken this out of the oven yet (baking for 3 hours at 200F), but I'm a batter eater, and this batter is delicious. It will be smooth and velvety, and not too sweet for me either. I whipped the cream and the egg whites separately to add a little lightness to the batter too.

This was a great recipe for the lighter, fluffier style of New York cheesecake. My husband, a former New Yorker, says that it could be served in any restaurant. It has a wonderful flavor and has a light texture. I served it with Allrecipe's Supreme Strawberry Topping. I will say that I cooked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then at 200 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes. Great recipe.  I will use it every time I make cheesecake!

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!!!!! The only review advice I used was to cook at 200 degrees for 3 hours then leave in oven for an hour afterward. The cake came out perfectly flat and round and fluffy. Unbelievably delicious! I was told it was better than Cheesecake Factory! So wonderful!!! I also used the strawberry purée recipe that another review said to use and it was the perfect amount and delicious with this cake!

I have tried this recipe several times and followed some of the reviews to tweek it.  I liked Heislords'review and baked it that way great results! On christmas eve, I put the cake in the oven at 7pm so i could turn it off at ten and go to bed while it cooled. I forgot and fell asleep so it baked until 6 am. I thought it would be ruined but to my surprise it wasn't. A little dry on top but not over cooked and very tasty. Not recommended but if you forget about it, it will not ruin it.

I can't accurately rate this since I really didn't follow the steps as written in the instructions.  I did want a really creamy texture throughout my cheesecake so I took some of the other cooks' suggestions - I baked without preheating for about 3 hours, did a water bath, cracking the oven door open and leaving it in for about an hour or so to cool.  However, my cheesecake came out way to creamy.  It was basically like a thick, cheese-flavored baked pastry cream.  Maybe I added a little too much cream in the mixture since I estimated the amount while pouring and didn't measure.  The surface of the cake was also shiny like plastic when it just came out of the oven. It was yellower than I expected.  I'll read more suggestions and tips on NY cheesecakes and get back to this recipe.

This recipes was good but the bake time needs to be adjusted as the center was underdone.  I baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then lowered to 200 and baked for 55 minutes more.  I have another cheesecake recipe which is almost the same except for the amount of whipping cream and it bakes it at 475 for 15 minutes and 250 for the remaining 45.  The texture of this cheesecake is a lot drier so perhaps somewhere between the two would be perfect.

I have made many cheescakes in my life.  I should've read the reviews first, because I also ended up with an undercooked cheesecake.  I also put vanilla in.

This was absolute perfection, WITH the following adjustments: I did cook it at 200 degrees as stated in comments for 3hrs and 10 mins. I let it cool maybe 15 mins and stuck it in the fridge over night.  I also made a sour cream sauce that I put on and broiled the top at 500 degrees for abt 8 mins until it was slightly golden brown. Received RAVE reviews for this!!!!

Followed this recipe to a "T" and it was barely cooked. Even cooked it for an extra hour at 200 degrees, then turned off the oven and left the "cheesecake" in there for another 3 hours. Thought it had set up. Will never use this recipe ever again.

My son loves cheesecake so I wanted to make him one to celebrate his First Communion and decided to go with this recipe. For a first cheesecake, and there being only 2 of us (one easily pleased), it served its purpose. However, the next time I bake this I will make some modifications. I can't imagine baking this as the recipe recommends, it would not cook through. I don't think 10 minutes at higher temp would do the trick. I did the 200 degree 3.1 hr alteration. I ended up cooking it for 3.5 hrs actually, then got paranoid, pulled it out (still very giggly), let sit and then refrigerated overnight. Still not done enough in the middle. It held up, but the middle weirded me out. I am cutting around it. Maybe it's my oven, I could touch the racks with my hands. Next time I am thinking I will cook it at 225 for 3.1 hrs and I will adjust for that giggliness. But it was my first time, I had no idea what to expect. My son was really happy though, he did not notice!

My family flipped out over this. Tastes better than our favorite steakhouse restaurant's cheesecake. I followed the suggested changes of cooking at 200 degrees and adding vanilla.

I follow Heislord5's advice on cook time. Comes out BEAUTIFUL! People ask for it time and time again! So delicious. I also make homemade brownies and use them as the crust instead of graham crackers. As soon as they are done I scoop the brownies into my springform pan, pack them down, pour in the cake batter and bake! VOILA!

I can't remember if I rated this recipe or not but it is excellent.....just be sure you use Heislords' rating and baking instructions.  Make take a bit longer but it works beautifully.  I did add a tad of cinnamon to the crust and 1 teaspoon vanilla to the batter..............Perfect!!!!  Oh and the Supreme Strawberry Topping is a must - it's awesome too!

Great cheesecake.  I think next time I'm going to cut the sugar by 1/4 cup.  I also made sure and put a water bath on the bottom rack and it worked perfect..no cracking or too dry on outside.  I think i will try the 200 degrees for 3 hours 10 min next time...the very outside edges were a little chewy.  all in all great cheesecake.

Seriously the BEST cheesecake I've EVER had.  I usually add a little bit of vanilla to the mix or I'll add a little lemon zest.  I always put fresh cut strawberries on top as a garnish.

3 stars is definitely based on the tastiness of the cheesecake.  I baked it for my husband's birthday and despite following the suggestions from all the other reviewers like baking it in a non-preheated oven for 3hrs and 10mins at 200 degrees F, and cooling it for 1 hour if not longer and putting it in the fridge, the whole cake was not set and runny even as I removed it from the oven after cooling.  As I did not have another birthday cake, I had to make do with this one.

YES! :)  Thank you!!!  It was the 3 hours on 100 C and cooling completely in the oven that did it.  Perfectly flat and pale on top, incredibly creamy and delicious - as you say, a true New York cheesecake.  Thank you!!!

EDITED: Just made this again, as above, and find it's not creamy enough.  Looks perfect.  But I think I'll keep looking for a creamier one.

Great cheesecake! Followed recipe except cooked at 300 for 3 and 1/2 hours then let cool in oven with door cracked for another hour. First time making a cheesecake. Easy to do, tasted great! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! No cracks either!

Awesome!  My family loved it.  This was my first try making a cheesecake and it was wonderful.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added vanilla and did not preheat the oven.  I will definitely make this cheesecake again.

This was my first cheesecake, and I took it to a church auction.  Fortunately the people who bought it let me try some of it because they are very sweet people, and I let everyone at the table try it.  It tasted amazing, very fluffy cooked all the way through, obviously i followed the eight hundred other reviews about the three hours thing, but I cooked it on two fifty for about ten minutes first, and I refrigerated it for probably about thirty hours.  i also took a bit of sugar out of it, and it was still very rich.

I have made this recipe over and over again using the Helsfords alterations. It is perfect. I made it with vanilla wafers for the crust and I have also made it with shortbread cookie crust. I don't think you can mess this one up unless you just go to sleep on it. (LOL I did that once. Even though it was gooey in the middle my family still ate the edges.SLOL)

All my friends and family LOVE this recipe.  They say it is the best ever.  Anytime I have anyone over, they ask for this cheesecake.  I put about 1/4 to 1/2 cup less sugar in it though.  Makes it not so sweet.  Otherwise, TOTALLY AWESOME!!!

This turned out sooo much better then I could of imagined. As my first cheesecake and serving it after Christmas dinner i was a little worried but everyone loved it. I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and cooked it at 200 for 3 hours then let it cool in the oven for 3 hours and served it 36 hours after cooking it. It wasn't hard just time consuming. But my husband who really doesn't enjoy sweets or desserts ever actually asked me to make this again for his birthday.

With the suggestion of adding vanilla & baking @ 200 for 3 hrs. it is the best cheesecake ever! I made a different one from this site for our 1st family Xmas & this one for the 2nd- no comparison- this is definitely supreme!

My cheesecake is FINALLY done. I took the advice of most reviews and cooked it for the 3 hours on 200 degrees. I did use the waterbath also, just because most cheesecake recipes say to...I used a 9 inch springform pan and OMG the slices are huge! You could feed an army since you can't possibly eat more than a sliver of this cake...So tasty! I did use a vanilla wafer crust instead of the graham crackers...I always use vanilla wafers for my pie crusts...Instead of adding the sugar I just crush up the vanilla wafers mix it with a stick of butter and press into the pan...This is definitely not for anyone on a diet!

I have made this cheesecake more than 20 times and it is my favorite cheesecake recipe BY FAR!!!! 
They key is that instead of using graham cracker, I mash up oreo cookies (taking out the inside cream) and the crust after its baked has a googy fudge like texture that is to die for! 
Also this recipe makes about 2 9inch cakes so beware and also needs a lot more time to bake in my oven.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have found.  I think I need to cook it a bit longer next time, it was good, but the middle needs to cook a bit longer.
Use this recipe over the other cheesecakes.

Excellent recipe! The only thing is, my cheesecake took MUCH longer to bake - approx 2 hours on 200deg.  I did not keep opening the door, I used the oven light, so  I'm not real sure why - but it turned out great.  Thanks for the awesome recipe - easy too!

Pretty darn tasty!  I added vanilla and almond extract to the filling.  I also added chopped almonds to the crust.  I made sure to use a hot water bath, and no cracks!
Very creamy, but still lacking something.  I will need to tweak it a little, but will definately try it again.

My granddaughter loves cheesecake so I tried this recipe for her. No cracks on the top as I used the water bath in the oven, and the taste wasn't bad. I'm just not a cheesecake person. So I'm probably not the best person to give advice on this recipe. I didn't bake the crust prior to the filling as the recipe didn't say to do so. I should of taken one of the viewers advice and cooked it b/c the crust was real soggy on the botton the next day when it was cut and maybe that would of made the difference. I made all the adjustment in baking as was suggested and the outcome was not worth all the effort to me. I ended up throwing it out because it was hardly touched. I was really upset that it didn't turn out for my granddaughter and all the time and money went down the drain(or trash)I probably want be making this one again.

This was the first time I made a cheesecake. It turned out perfectly. I was astounded at how delicious it was. The only thing I would recommend is making it teo days in advance to serving it. It got much better as the time went by.

Went along with HEISLORD5 suggestions, the taste is very good but the presentation is ok. I never made a cheesecake without a water bath until this. I will try it with a water bath next time and see if it looks beautiful and has a little more moisture. Great taste, a tad dry, but overall very good

This cheesecake is to die for!  I followed some of the suggestions the other readers left, and it was gone in one day!  My husband declared it to be the best he's ever eaten, and he was born/raised in New York City, the home of the best cheesecake!  My kids went for immediate seconds and the whole cake disappeared before our eyes!  Yummmmmmm.  This is a definate winner in our house.

Good recipe. I increase the butter to a full stick, and mix it with on package of cookies.  Elevate the pan for the butter to drip. Add on more egg. I also cook for 2 hrs at 225 and let it cool down in the oven. This is a very good recipe. Everyone likes it. Use blueberry commstock to coat.

These are the 1st Cheesecake that i made. I love it and my friends love it too.

First I didn't know i can change the people of servings, so i follow the original recipe made serving of 12, it's can fit into 1x8" and 2x6" aluminum tray. The cracker i change to Vanilla wafer & only add 1/4 cup of sugar (but next time i will not add any sugar into it because the wafers already sweet enough, I wanna taste the cheesecake more than the base of the cake). Also I listed the other reviewer add only 1 1/4 cup sugar in the cake but i still think it's too sweet for me next time i will add 1 cup only. I did hot water bath. Bake 10min 400F than 3hr 200F. it come out perfect. 
Ha ha one of my friend already request it for his b'day gift.

Iam not sure if this turned out the way it did do to me not having a springform pan or what. I followed the no fail instructions found in the reviews. I had a very large pie pan that I baked it in. First off, the cake over flowed badly during cooking (again could be because I didn't have a springform pan). Second, after baked and sitting in the fridge for the 24 hrs as noted, the top of the cake was very hard and discolored. (I simply cut the top off to get to the bottom part) While mixing my graham cracker mix and butter,there wasn't enough butter to make the crust. (The mix was very crumbly and not sticking to the sides at all) I eyeballed and added more butter. After all was said and done, I didn't care for the graham cracker crust at all, but my friends and family loved it. (Maybe it's just a personal thing) After all the changes minus my disliking the crust, the cake turned out pretty good. I will use this recipe again, but I will continue to tweek it to make it to my liking. Thanks for a good recipe!

Ok, this is a creamy cheesecake with a nice crust (actually, this is the first time i prepare my own graham cracker crust and i'm proud of myself!! lol) but i guess i'll keep making the New York Cheesecake III from this site.
I baked it for almost 2h30min and i noticed that the more i baked it the more it crackled. I left it inside the oven after done for an extra hour and refrigerated overnight. ;)

An awesome taste. I made the mistake of disreguarding the cooking time advice and we couldn't eat this when I planned.  It needed 2 1/2 hours plus cooling time to taste it's best.

This was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! I made this for my husband's birthday and our entire family said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had! (And they know their cheesecake!) I did use the suggestion of baking it slower at a lower temperature. It worked out great! I think the requests to have this made for family events are going to start rolling in!

I used the modified version with vanilla and cooked at 200 for 3 hours 10 minutes... made this for a birthday at work and it was gone the same day!  Everyone loved it... Better than anything from the store.

This cheesecake received many compliments on its taste, however, I was extrememly disappointed in its appearance. This cake had a huge crack in the center in the shape of a "T". To make light of it, I told everyone I personalized the cheesecake since my name begins with a "T"!

This is a great cheesecake recipe.  I read other reviews and baked it at the times suggested.  I didn't use a water bath and no cracks!  The cheesecake is more on the dense side than others I've tried before, which works for me because I prefer a more dense cheesecake.  Very rich cheesecake!  I forgot to add vanilla which I believe would've added a nice flavor.  I'll try it next time.  My sister said she liked this cheesecake better than Juniors which is a great compliment!  Thank you for the wonderful cheesecake recipe!!

Great cheescake, so yummy, I used a prebaked chocolate graham crust instead, the recipe makes enough batter for two of them though, deliciously delightful,worth the calories,make sure to refrigerate it before eating, it gives the best texture, too puddingy if you eat it warm.

This recipe is great!  There were changes to the baking time (as stated by other reviewers) and the sugar can be omitted from the crust, but other than that it was fantastic!

This is a delicious cheesecake!  I used two pkgs. of Neufchatel and it turned out great.  I discovered both my 9 and 10 inch pan were broken (from a move) so I had to use an 8-inch.  I had too much batter so I put the rest in a mini cheesecake pan, and two mini pie pans.  I used chocolate crumbs instead of graham crackers.  I really liked it this way.  I reduced the sugar in the crust too, to only 2 TBS.  I followed the baking time and directions, but baked at 250 instead of 200.  It looked great when I turned off the oven, but as it was cooling in the oven (for an hour or two) it developed the biggest crack I've ever seen in a cheesecake- right in the middle.  Oh well, it still tastes great.  At least the top didn't brown at all like some cheesecake's I've made in the past.  I made Supreme Strawberry topping to go on top of this.  Great combo!

This was my first effort at a cheese cake. My boyfriend requested an oreo cookie version and so I attepted to comply. I served exactly as sugested but with a cookie base.I also added gound cookies and cookie chunks mixed into the batter. He loved it and said it was without a doubt the best cheesecake he had ever eaten, but I felt the creamcheese flavor was too strong. I might as well have bitten into a plain block of creamcheese. I tink it needs more flavor to acomodate the dulling effect of the creamcheese. I did not have seconds.

This cheesecake is GREAT!! I made a 3 berry sauce to go with it, but we actually liked it better just plain. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did have to bake it for 3 hours, like the others have said.

Super delicious! My husband is a HUGE cheesecake fan and he just could not stop raving about this cheesecake. I, on the other hand, am not a big cheesecake fan, but I could not stop myself from stealing bites from his plate. I did not have time to make a fruit topping, so I just used a canned topping, which still worked out great.

So, I didn't read the reviews before attempting this cheesecake.

1. The crust needs more butter or less grahams.

2. I had about 3/4 cup of batter left over and I used a 10 inch pan, Filled to the brim!  

3. It didn't set up.  I baked it at 400 for 10 minutes then a 200 for 1 1/2 hours.  

I loved the texture (of the outside, not the middle).  I'm going to have to fiddle with it to make it right!

I am only giving this cheesecake four stars because like everyone else who gave it 5 stars but still had to compromise the recipe, I had to make some adjustments.  Baking this cake without the hot water bath would have browned the cake on top... I've done that before but the consistency of the filling was marvelous.  Not so in this case and it's probably because the temp baked at 1 hour was not hot enough.  I left the cake in the oven after turning it off for a couple hours and then let it chill in the fridge overnight.  I also added a little vanilla to the mix, so that the flavor of the cream cheese would not completely take over.  I'm a little more experienced with the graham cracker crust and advise 2 C. ground grahams, 1/2 C. sugar, and 1/2 C. butter.  My cheesecake however set overnight and while thankfully it did not sink in the middle, the filling as a whole seemed rather... glossy and a little too smoothe if that's at all possible.  It's just not what I expected out of a so called "supreme" recipe.  The flavor is good.  I made some adjustments, but overall a good framework for making good cheesecake.

Muffy, this is the greatest.  I've now made it twice.  The second time I took it to a church party for 70 people.  The class leader stood up and asked "Who made that cheesecake?"  There were raving reviews from all.  I did bake it for 10 minutes at 450 and then dropped it down to 200 for 3 hours as others mentioned.  This is the BEST

I live in an area that cheesecake is not their best known food and I grew up in Baltimore/D.C. where foods like cheesecake was always delicious!  Thanks for this recipe, it brings back a piece of home :) Cathy

Excellent! I didn't catch in the previous reviews the trick about the long baking at low temp, I just did as per the recipe, so it came out a bit runny, but still extremely good.  Will try again and am confident with the additional baking time it will be perfect!

I made this for all of my friends for christmas gifts! The best cheesecake recipe I have found so far!! I did however change the grahm crackers to vanilla wafers & used brown sugar instead of regular sugar in the crust(i like the taste better). I thought it would take alot longer to make it but it was actually very simple. A++++++

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  This cheesecake was incredibly delicious.  This  was only my second time making a cheesecake and I didn't change a thing to the recipe.  Luckily however, I read the reviews of others because my cheesecake wasn't even close to being cooked after just an hour.  I cooked it in a water bath for 3 hours and it came out PERFECT.  Not a single crack anywhere.  I don't think I will ever make another cheesecake recipe.  Everyone raved about this.  It looked and tasted heavenly.  My only regret is making it for Thanksgiving...because it's gone.

Whoa!  Can you say sweet?  I cut the sugar in the crust in half and still thought it was sweet.  I would prefer somthing with just the slightest hint of tart so I will keep looking.  Over all, the taste was good, the texture great and worth a try.  Also, the outside of my cheesecake cracked, while the middle wasnt quite cooked, but almost.

Wow… what a tasty, thick cheesecake! My only adjustments are to bake about 2 1/2 hours (at 200 degrees), let it cool on the counter for about 1 – 2 hours, then refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving. Thanks, Muffy, for a great recipe!

Keep in mind that I'm truly the world's worst cook...but even I couldn't screw up this recipe.  I'm not even a cheesecake fan, but after having a few bites of a friend's cheesecake at a restaurant a few days earlier, I had a craving for some more and luckily decided to try this recipe.  I cut the suger in the crust in half and used half white and half brown suger as well as about a tsp of cinnamon.  I also used 1 tsp of vanilla as well as 1 T. of lemon juice in the filling which REALLY turned out yummy!  I decided to go with the cooking directions most of the reviewers recommended (3 hrs @ 200 degrees - then let it sit about 3 more hours in the oven with the door propped open a bit and then I refrigerated it overnight).  Oh yeah - I also used the boiling water bath and got NO cracks at all.  My only warning would be to cut yourself about 1/3 of the size slice you think you can eat....this is one RICH cake!

this is the best cheese cake i ever made, and everyone says it better than jurniors. and the best way for you to get the best results is to cook it as instructed for the 3hrs and 10 under 200c, and then wait the 24hrs. the only thing i hate is waiting so long for it, but it worth the wait, and i just want to add, i'am a person who really don't cook and it turn out well for me. so if i could make it anyone can!

This is an awesome cheesecake!  As all previous comments state, the timing could not be more wrong.  I cooked it at 200 for 4 hours 10 minutes and the result was to die for.  Do not alter the ingredients at all.

I loved it! It was the first time I ever baked a cheesecake. It did crack, but I didn't care because I expected it. It fills the pan to the top. I let it cool for about 15 minutes, moved it to the refigerator, and topped it this morning before I brought it to work (you couldn't tell it cracked). It tasted fabulous!!! It was easy to make and is best made with a Kitchenaid mixer to make sure there are no lumps.

This is a great cheesecake!  I have served it 3 times, and always had everyone ranting about how good it was!  I've never had it crack, I followed the directions changing only the fact that I cooked it for 2 hours, and let it sit in the oven to cool, after turning it off.  Then I refrigerated it overnight.

I used a bigger pan (10 3/4 inches) and perhaps that's why this recipe flopped. I followed the other reviewer's instructions, though.. it's edible, although the top is cracked and crispy. It has a custard-like taste, probably from the 7 eggs. Cutting the sugar in half for the crust really helped, and I added about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust. The crust is very yummy. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

My cheesecake turned out perfectly.  I followed the instructions and heeded the advice of other reviewers.  I placed a pan of water in the oven during baking and increased the baking time to TWO hours.  I also used a 10 springform.  Delicious and well received.

My first try at cheesecake and I must say it is the best.  So easy.  "Everyone" loves it.
Had to increase cooking time some and increased temp to 250.

Everyone who has tasted this cheescake loves it!  I don't think anyone can mess it up...I've substituted evaporated milk for the cream, crushed oreos for the grahm crackers, and lowfat cream cheese and it still comes out great!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made!!!  Like many others, I did have to cook it longer but it was worth it!  And this recipe is not as expensive as other recipes but taste like it cost a fortune to make!  I will be offering to bring this to all of the holiday parties this season!

I am writing another review because after many of trials, I have finally figured the cooking temperature out!  I cook it in a water bath with foil around the bottom of my pan.  I Start the oven out at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then continue to cook at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 5 minutes (my oven).  Just until there is about a 1 inch circle in the middle that still jiggles slightly.  It comes out perfect every time.  When I take it out I put it on a rack and run a thin knife around the edge of the pan every so often to keep the crust from sticking and pulling the cake apart.  It is the best cheesecake ever.

This recipe is excellent. Everybody loves it. I would recommend using a water bath to avoid cracks though. The cheesecake works well alone and magnificiently with strawberry sauce. A definite 5 star recipe. Thanks Muffy.

Delicious recipe.  It may be my oven but I had to bake it a little longer than directions.  Everyone loved it.  Will be making this again.

This cheesecake was fantastic. It was quite easy to make but needed a little more time in the oven. I will make this often.

My Hubby says this certainly has five stars from him.  Quite possibly the best cheese cake I have ever eaten.  Definately the best I have ever made.  Thanks Muffy.

Since my first review years ago...I have perfected this cheesecake!! I'm famous for it! It is by FAR the best cheesecake I've ever had! Beats any restaurant cheesecake! I made some slight changes to the original recipe and it comes out awesome everytime! I bake mine in a water bath for about 60 mins at 350 degrees. I let it cool down in the oven before putting in the fridge (prevents the cake from cooling down too quick and cracking). I also eliminate the flour and heavy cream and use 1 cup of sour cream and use 4 eggs instead of 5.

I first made this recipe using 3, 9 inch  pie shells and they came out just fine, the time in the oven needed adjustment.  Everyone loved the recipe, it came out rich and dense.

I don't know what went wrong, but I baked this an extra hour and a half at 250 degrees after the recommended times and temperatures and it STILL wasn't set in the middle.  Any suggestions?  The edges were delicious.

I originally reviewed your recipe in 2000 when I first tried it, but have since modified the recipe and have had rave reviews as everyone else has. I have a little bit different cooking method because I have an old oven. I cook at 400 for about 20 minutes and then turn the oven down to 200 and cook for another 1 1/2 to 2 hrs.Turn oven off and leave until completely cool. Then refrigerate. I have found the Wal-mart Great Value brand cream cheese to be the best! It makes my cheesecakes creamier and set better than the name brands. I also add a touch of cinnamon to the crust, but no additives to the filling. I have perfected and pumpkin cheesecake for the holidays...... sub really cheap, hard gingersnaps (crushed in food processor) for graham crackers and reduce the sugar to 2 tbs. Take one cup of pumpkin puree and mix with pumpkin pie spice until you get the desired flavor (I like mine a little on the heavy side as it is going to come down a notch when added to the filling). Make filling as usual and take pumpkin by the spoonful and knife it into the filling, creating a swirl effect. Bake as usual and serve with homemade whip cream. I cannot count how many of these I have made in the last 2 years! I had 8 to make for Thanksgiving alone and another 4 for Christmas! Thanks!!!

I am not a real big fan of cheescake but this one tasted great.  The only thing is the crust was too mushy...needed less butter.  Other than that definately the one I will use to make my husband's birthday cake.
