These certainly weren't the prettiest potatoes I've ever made but they sure were some of the tastiest.  I had to cook them longer and add more half and half but in the end, these had a wonderful, interesting flavor thanks to the rosemary.

These were pretty tasty but I felt another cheese would have made these even better such as Gruyere.

I don't usually cook food that is so indulgent, but Christmas dinner only comes once a year!  With all the cream and cheese and rosemary (our favorite!) I hoped this would be fantastic, but it didn't wow us.  The cooking time was spot on for 1/4" slices (I too used my mandolin), but I would have preferred them to be much thinner.  I also think another cheese would have been a better pairing (grueyer?) as the chedder and bechamel didn't quite come together after baking.

Doubled the recipe and cooked it longer -  add 6 oz of herbed goat cheese and only use one onion - bacon on the top of course!  I love  the rosemary flavour and top with a bit of nutmeg!  I thought this recipe was great!

Made this dairy free/gluten free by replacing cheese with vegan mozzarella, half and half  with unsweetened coconut milk,  butter with earth balance and flour with gluten free baking mix.  Plus a scoop of vegan cream cheese!  I also boiled potatoes until tender to save cooking time.  I used redskin potatoes and left the skins on.

Overall a pretty good recipe. I decided to add the seasonings to the bechamel sauce rather than sprinkle on layers, I also added a large clove of garlic to the sauce, a little extra rosemary and 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese, which meant I needed more 1/2 & 1/2. .  Then I layered potatoes, onions, shredded cheese, 3 layers total then the sauce on top. It was good flavor, took extra time to cook  but I think that’ was the amount of potatoes I had. 

Next time I may add all the cheese to the sauce and then layer potatoes, sauce, onions etc...

This is the 2nd time I’ve made this.  The first time I used a vented lid (more for steaming) because it’s the only one I had that fit my 12” fry pan.  The potatoes came out undercooked.  This time I followed the directions exactly and the bottom of the potatoes burned (not black - but way too much).  Also, I think the gruyere cheese is too mild for “au gratin” potatoes.  I’ll go with a sharp cheddar and a more traditional recipe.  This wasn’t terrible, but a lot of effort for ‘meh’ results.  I won’t make it again.

Very good recipe! I've made this many times. To mix it up I sometimes add layers of sliced sweet potato as well.

Followed the recipe with no additions or changes. Came out very creamy but bland. I will make this again and double the rosemary and salt, maybe change the cheese.  Good starter but just not as flavorful as I would of thought.

The only thing I found is that you needed to add more flour in order to thicken the rue.
I also added thyme and cheese to each layer of potatoes and onions and found that it made an even nice tasting dish.

Very good. Followed the recipe, what I seldom do.... the only thing I did not add was paprika, because I was out, but I added nutmeg instead.
