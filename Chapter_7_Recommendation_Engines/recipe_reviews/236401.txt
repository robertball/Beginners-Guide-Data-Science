This is quite bland which worked nicely when I served it with maple salmon.  Since there was leftovers I added a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, nice but not great.  Don't think I would make it again but will look for something similar using peaches because it was a nice touch.

After reading the one other review, I decided to make some changes to the dressing to perk it up some.  I used basil infused olive oil, and red wine pomegranate vinegar about half and half, 1/3 c. V* Splash Peach Mango juice because I had it on hand.. I added 2 pkts of  Truvia sweetner, 1/4 c cut up fresh basil,  a tsp of Gram Marsala (because I didn't have any curry powder), a generous amt of garlic salt, and white pepper to taste.  I poured this over the rotini and the fresh peaches and refrigerated the whole dish for about an hour, while I went to the store for a rotisserie chicken.  Just before serving I mixed in a generous amount - 2 cups approx. of the chicken and stirred it gently into the pasta and peaches.  It was really quite good for a salad I  hadn't thought about.
