The flounder turned out really well in the air fryer. After reading reviews about the recipe being bland I made some changes. I added salt and pepper to the egg wash. To the bread crumbs I added 2tsp of old bay, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1tsp paprika, and some salt & pepper. Can’t wait to make it again.

This was by far, the best fish I have ever eaten in my entire life.  I bought a whole bunch of cod filets because I wanted to make beer battered fish.  I fried some up in the deep  fryer and the beer batter coating came off.  That's when I found this recipe and I made one for myself, just to make sure they would turn out alright. Way better than any store-bought or take-out battered cod, ever! The only adjustment I made was that I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil because that's all I had on hand.  Thank you!

I made this recipe and we really liked it. A lot healthier than pan frying the fish. I used the fish pre- set option on my fryer. Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious.  I slightly modified the recipe for an even healthier meal.    I used olive oil instead vegetable oil.   I used 2 egg whites in place of the 1 egg.  I also used salt and pepper on the filet before dipping in egg.   I baked at 360 degrees for 12 minutes.   It was amazing.   Will make again.

Awesome starter recipe for my new air fryer! i mixed my bread crumbs 50/50 with some potato chip dust, which added enough oil to make these babies ROCK!

This turned out great. I did add some additional spices. Mixed together pepper, paprika, celery salt  and sprinkled on fish after dredging in breadcrumbs. Will definitely make this again! Family loved it.

This is incredible! I was a little skeptical at first.  We have a freezer full of Halibut from our Alaska trip this summer and I wanted to replicate a delicious meal we had at the beach this past weekend at a nice Chinese restaurant.  Crispy Halibut with Ginger-Scallion sauce.  
I used Panko  (white) bread crumbs from Wegmans.  I also used peanut oil because I like the flavor. 
My fillets are big because the  halibut we caught was 135 pounds. 
I dipped the  fillets in the egg and then the panko crumbs and oil mixture and into the air fryer basket  for 25 mins. 
They were fantastic.   This  is a wonderful recipe. I am so happy I found it.  I can now have crispy Halibut when ever I want.

I made this with bluegills and it was pretty good. 5 min. @ 380 yielded a crispy fillet. Next time I will season the fillets prior to the egg wash. It just seemed to be lacking  flavor with the bread crumbs alone. I even used Italian bread crumbs.

Tasty. Lower calorie aspect is nice. Not greasy. The bottom crust wasn’t so crusty but the top crust was perfect. I expected this. The fish was very moist and delicious. I used Ling cod that we caught off Alaska.

Turned out great! I did have to add more seasoning because I was using catfish and live in the south. Both the BF and I were really impressed with the crispiness, color and flavor! *I'm new to the air fryer but it has been wonderful so far! Thank you for air frying recipes!

I added some seasonings to this. I hate to alter someone's recipe after they were kind enough to share it, but since I didn't see any seasonings, I decided to add some. I will make this again! I also used a different white fish.

I just made this using White Trout my dad caught and froze for me. I cut each filet in half to make dipping easier and seasoned my Italian style  bread crumbs with complete seasoning. It came out GREAT! I suggest using a little spritz of cooking spray to keep the fish from sticking to the air fryer.

We made the fish without any oil at all in the mix. That just sounded weird to us. I think next time we will try a little oil just to see if it is good that way too. We did add spices to the breadcrumbs and we used gluten free breadcrumbs. It turned out really good in our air fryer. Crispy on the outside and the fish was moist. We served coleslaw, French fries, and tater tots with it.

This recipe was amazing! Turned out perfect! I did make a few small changes. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the plain. Then I added a little bit of old bay, salt, pepper, and lemon  juice to the crumb mixture. Then in the eggs I added a little old bay, salt and pepper. And instead of flounder I used haddock. My family loved it! Even the kids who are usually picky eaters. I will be using this recipe every time I make air fried fish :)

Delicious way to make healthier fish.  I didn't add the oil to the crumbs, instead sprayed it on before frying (so I used a lot less).  Turned out crisp and tasty.  Made it 2 nights in a row!

Did catfish fillets.  Marinated them in buttermilk.  Used up Panko to bread them.  Not a good thing.  Watched some other people on YouTube so I felt confident with the recipe.  Love the Air Fryer.  Best counter top appliance introduction in the last 20 years.

I made this tonight using plain flounder filets. Not bad, but I used to much olive oil spray. I tasted the olive spray on every piece of fish. It was still dry even with the evoo. Will adjust next time.

Such an awesome texture...crisp on outside, flaky and not dry inside. I used frozen and thawed & thoroughly dried cod. I made 2 small changes besides what type of fish:

I used peanut oil vs. veg oil, and I added garlic powder, dillweed, pink himalayan sea salt, and paprika. Probably less than 1/2 teaspoon of each? Any seasoning would work with this recipe. Loved it!

I've used my air fryer for fish fillets in the past with good results but this recipe makes fish that is much crunchier and more like fish fried in oil. of course, with oil mixed with the bread crumbs the calorie and fat  content is higher but not that much and it's definitely worth the extra calories. very easy, too. loved it.

My husband and I loved this! We added creole seasoning and garlic powder, then sat inside fridge for a couple of hours until time to cook. Sprayed it with some olive oil before cooking . Flipped the fish half way through as well. Turned out so crispy and delicious! Thx for the recipe!

Per other reviews, added Old Bay, garlic powder and smoked paprika. Made it with bagged frozen cod. Set unpre-heated AT for 17 minutes. Perfect.

Nice and crunchy. Used a mix of breadcrumbs and panko and Cajun seasonings.   I flipped the fish a little more than halfway through.  Will definitely make again.

Love this one!
I did make some substitutions and additions.  Speckled Trout instead of flounder.  Didn't have avocado oil; I had some used peanut oil from last week's fish fry.  Added some creole seasoning, salt & pepper to the Panko bread crumbs.  Cut the fillets into ~3" x 4" chucks to fit better in the fryer basket.
We had my homemade tartar sauce and homemade coleslaw to go with the crispy fillets.  I will DEFINITELY do this again!

The crumb fry was great,  since I'm new to this, I could have used some seasoning direction...I have access to fresh water fish and they can be bland, especially if frozen.  I did salt and pepper but that didn't seem to make much of a difference.

This tastes just like breaded fried fish...only lighter without all the fat! I used 3/4c bread crumbs with 1/4 c panko and added a dash of oregano, garlic powder and onion powder, and the family loved it! Some recipes for air frying don’t include cooking oil in the coating—the small amount of oil in this really makes a world of difference. Thanks for a new favorite crunchy fish recipe!

I did make any changes except for the oil because I didn't have vegetable oil. So I used olive oil and it came out fantastic. It was my first time having cat fish and I really liked. I will use this recipe again!!

Crispy and delicious. Made just a few changes by seasoning the fish and the bread crumbs with a little salt, black pepper, onion and garlic powder and paprika. Cooked up great in the air fryer.

This is really good! The only drawback is that it creates a lot of dirty dishes and requires cleaning the air frier, but I can live with that. I used 1.5 filets, about 1 pound, and cut the bread crumbs down to 2 3/4 C, but this was still way too much. I
added some seasoning to the fish before dipping it in the egg and crumbs, specifically salt, pepper, marjoram, and ginger (just a touch of each so as not to overpower the fish). It came out nicely cooked in less time that specified, about 10 minutes, probably because I had thin pieces. This is much easier than getting a frying pan to the right temperature and trying to flip delicate fish into hot oil. Recommended.

Not what we expected.  Will probably not do fish in the air fryer again.

I made the fish right by the directions.  I was a little leery about the mayonnaise but oh my stars the fish was over the top.  I will definitely be making this again for my grandkids, they will love it.

I need to let the cooks know how I screwed this recipe up.  I used the Louisiana cornmeal prepackaged mix, mixing it with the oil and the batter did not cook and remained thick and powdery.  Yuk!  Then I tried dipping the fish into the egg then into the cornmeal and drizzled with oil and that worked and tasted just fine.  Next time I will follow the recipe and use breadcrumbs.  duh.

My only problem was that I used a delicate fish and I didn’t season it enough, therefore it was quite bland. But, I will make it again’

A healthier version of "fried" fish.  This was a test recipe of my new air fryer.  This is a recipe that I know I'll be making often.

I followed the cooking instructions for the air fryer exactly as written and it came out perfect.  It lacked seasonings and tasted somewhat bland.  Will definitely make this again but will add the seasonings to kick it up.

Because I love spice I added cayenne and black papper, but the recipe as written would be awesome if you don’t want the heat.
