10.27.16   This coffee cake is the BOMB!  I added a little bit of cake flour to compensate for the fact that you can’t buy 18-oz cake mixes anymore (at least I don’t see them), but otherwise followed the recipe.  This is one delicious, moist, and flavorful coffee cake, loaded with pumpkin flavor.  I seldom use cake mixes anymore, but I bought one for this recipe, and I’ll keep one on hand, just for this recipe, I think some chopped pecans or walnuts might be a good addition to the cake batter for an occasional variation.  Well done Morgan, this one’s a keeper.

I used the regular cake mix size (nothing extra) and followed the instructions. The entire cake was eaten  by 5 co-workers in the same day!

This cake is amazing!!! My husband said it was the best cake he's every had. I loved it! Perfectly moist, the crumble top with the brown sugar glaze is amazing!! I brought it to a bake sale and a woman called me the next day to say it was the best cake she's ever had. Both of my kids loved it. i made it just as described, but the recipe called for 18 oz cake mix. All I saw was 15.? oz, so that's what I used. Otherwise, kept all amounts the same. Perfect and amazing! It's my new favorite go-to for fall. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for a weekend church gathering and it was a hit. Several people are already requesting it again. I made it just as the recipe was written.

Definitely! I didn't do the crumb topping. I used candied pecans on top with the glaze and substituted maple extract.

I made this today. Wow what a light, tasty cake. I did not have a yellow cake mix, so I substituted a Duncan Hines Spice cake mix. Make sure to fold the cake mix into the pumpkin mix, it will look like pancake batter. But I think this contributed to the lightness of the finished cake. I also added chopped walnuts to the topping. Everything else I followed the recipe as written. The texture of the cake reminds me of crumb cake. Make sure you make the glaze!  I poked holes in the cake then drizzled it on the top just after we took the cake from the oven. OMG This is a keeper, you won't regret making this.

Had more of a cake consistency than a coffee cake, but it was easy to prepare and super moist. My guest really enjoyed it!

I made a few changes...I used GF flour, used Olive Oil instead of water, and toasted pecans and GF Oats to add to the crumble.

Delicious! Even worked with a GF cake mix and flour - just added 1 tsp baking powder.
