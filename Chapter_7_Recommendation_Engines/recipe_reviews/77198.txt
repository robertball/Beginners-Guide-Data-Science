MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD!!!

I prepared in the crockpot (slow cooker) combined all liquids and poured over meat.  Cooked on low for 8 hours - while at work.  Came home to the most delicious recipe I've ever found on the internet.   Served over white rice!  Can't wait to get home to have left overs!

THANKS RICK!

I made the recipe exactly as printed. It was way too sweet for me. I would advise using unsweetened coconut and only half as much, reduce or eliminate the brown sugar, use only half as much coconut milk, twice as much sour cream, and only 1-2 tsp allspice (an entire tablespoon was too too much for my taste!)I would cut way down on the butter as well; my refrigerated leftovers developed a layer of hardened butter a half-inch thick. I think the recipe has great potential, as I love Caribbean dishes.

This was great. I threw everything in the crockpot for 7 or 8 hours and then served it over rice. Yum!

Super!  My husband and guests raved about this one!  I followed this recipe exactly as suggested except added the toasted, flaked coconut to the rice.  I used Basmati rice and cooked it in half coconut milk and half water. I also fried plantains for something on the side. I will definitely do this one again!  Go Bucs!!!!!

this was sweet with a small kick, delicious and incredibly easy to make.  creates lots of sauce to serve over rice.  i seared then used the crockpot and only about half of the shredded coconut.  thanks, rick!

This was good but not knock my socks off good.  It tasted a little flat--something was missing.  As one of the reviewers said, the color is a little unappetizing.  I didn't find it too sweet.  Other reviewers probably felt it was too sweet because they may have used cream of coconut instead of coconut milk.

I'm afraid I have to give this one 2-thumbs down.  The color wasn't very appetizing and the flavor was worse.  I've been on the South Beach diet for the past 2 weeks and this recipe looked like the carbohydrate amount would be acceptable.  I served it with brown rice which was OK, but I hate I didn't get to have something really good for supper when I get so little to eat at all.

I made it exactly like the recipe was written but the steak was tough as shoe leather.  Maybe I should blame it on the cow(?)

This is the first recipe in 8 years I have made from this recipe site I was this disappointed in.

Flavorful, easy, wonderful.  Skipped the sour cream and used half of the coconut milk to lower some calories/fat, but still tasted excellent.

My wife and I really liked this. Not too sweet. It was very easy. I used a little more wine and reduced longer for a bit more flavor intensity.

I love this recipe. I tried it once in the skillet and it took way too long and the meat didn't get tender enough, definitely not after 30 minutes, but if you use a crock pot it is absolutely perfect. I've borrowed two extra crock pots and am attempting to make it for my entire class tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes!

I skipped the optional coconut, and changed the cooking method a bit, but kept all of the other ingredients as stated, and we liked it! I didn't think 30 minutes was going to be enough time to tenderize my 2 lb. flank steak to the point where it would shred easily, so I decided to go with the "low and slow" method. I browned the onions and mushrooms - then removed them to a bowl while I browned both sides of the flank steak. I added the onions and mushrooms back and mixed all of the other ingredients together and poured it over top, covered the pan and placed it in a 250 degree oven for about 3-1/2 hours. At first, the "sauce" was purple (which looked kind of disgusting), but when it was finished it turned a nice brown color. I served this with rice, sliced oranges and honey-lime marinated papaya. It was a delicious Caribbean dinner!

The husband and I both really liked this dish.  I made it on a cold rainy day for the second time last week, served it over a bowl of rice and it was a nice hardy meal for him after being out in the cold all day.  I can understand why some people don't love this dish...it probably isn't for everyone but we both love coconut milk when used this way.  If your a fan of coconut curries I think you'll like this too.  (I did add a touch of curry powder well.)  I think it has a nice balance of sweet and savory just be careful with the amount of sugar...I just eyeballed the measurement this time and I think it was a tad too much.  I also used a bolder wine this time too which helped with a darker color; more brown than gray as some others have said.

This was very tasty, and not that sweet as others were saying. Use coconut milk, not cream and you will be fine. Use half sugar to be 100% safe. The color of the dish, I would agree, is not the most attractive. The taste is very flavourful, rich and a bit unusual. It was great experiment, and we don't have any leftovers, but I won't cook it again - too unusual taste.

The allspice in this recipe was way too overpowering.  I didn't enjoy the flavor and definately didn't save the leftovers.  My kids did not like it at all and I won't be making this again.

I thought this was OK, but my husband and 5 year old son were put off by the color (gray) and how very sweet it was (hubby). I put everything except the sour cream in the crock pot and let it go all day, then adding the sour cream when ready to serve. The bonus is that the meat falls apart and there is no need to shread it. I did add some garlic powder at the end to help cut the sweetness. Bottom line: with two thumbs down out of three, I will not be making this for my family again - I can't eat that many leftovers myself. I prefer my own ropa vieja recipe made with beef or chicken.

Flavor is wonderful!  But it looks awful.  (What do you expect of ropa vieja ('old clothes')?
I used my crock pot.  Should have cut the meat across the grain into smaller sections before shredding.  It was stringy.
My husband and I liked it, but wouldn't try serving it to guests!

I made this recipe in a slow cooker as others have suggested and I really didn't care for it.  I didn't think it was too sweet...  I just didn't like the flavor though I do generally like Caribbean food. My husband thought it was pretty good but he heavily seasoned it with chipotle sauce so it wasn't "true" to the recipe.

This was so-so.  The sauce was good, a bit sweet.  I left the flaked coconut out simple because we are not big coconut fans.  I also used a crockpot, low for 7-8 hours.  Served over white rice which was perfect for the sweet sauce.
