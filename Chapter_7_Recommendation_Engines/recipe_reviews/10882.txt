My family loved these.  I did replace the orange zest with nutmeg and cinnamon because that is what we like.  Very easy took 20 minutes.  Sprinkled powered sugar on top instead of icing.  Very yummy!

These crullers tasted good but didn't have a great presentation. I had some trouble shaping them and they deflated as soon as i removed them from the oil. If i make these again I think I would just drop them by spoonfuls into the oil and see what i get.

My husband and I loved these! I took off one star because I thought the directions could use some more detail. 
When piping, twist the bag and move very slowly to get a slightly thicker donut. It also looks a little prettier. (You can do any shape you like. I made hearts for Valentine's Day last year.) Once they're on the wax paper, freeze them for about 20 minutes while you make the glaze. You will have to increase the cooking time by about one minute. 

As far as the glaze, I melted the butter on the stove top and subbed regular sugar for half of the confectioner's sugar. It makes the glaze taste a little more like in the donut shops and easier to drizzle onto the crullers.

These are absolutely wonderful. I will definately make them often and double the recipe. My family loved them. I did not have orange zest on hand and they were still fabulous.I will try them with the orange zest in the future.

Tried making these last night.

The texture and flavor were superb and turned out to be a big hit at home.  Although, I would recommend squeezing out thicker crullers for frying for what I think will be the real experience of every bite you take.  The ones I made were a bit too thin (maybe the circumference of a quarter) lessening the punch of each bite.  

There's nothing to complain about this recipe.  It was fantastic and you should try making them if you find these interesting.  I also replaced the orange zest with cinnamon and nutmeg, just like the other review said.

Great flavor but greasy.  After I took the crullers out of the oil, they would deflate.

Sprinkled with powdered sugar instead of putting cream on top. Very delicious.

I added about 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 nutmeg. I boiled the orange rind in hunks in the sugar water mix and get double orange flavor. Ugliest best tasting donuts I’ve ever made. They simple will not release from paper. I tried the freezer trick to no avail. Ended up scraping globs in fryer. This was too thick to fry to doneness without over frying. They only way to do this at this point of losing my mind over boiling oil is to put back into the press and squeeze it directly into hot oil, similar to funnel cake. Taking all that into consideration, try it, you’ll like it.

I wasn't happy with the results I got from this recipe. To be fair, I didn't do the frosting as suggested, but just a plain glaze - as is my preference with this type of doughnut.  But even with a very sweet glaze, they just weren't sweet enough for me. I just felt both the taste and texture were rather bland and uninteresting.  However, my husband did like them.

I thought this would be great. I have made cream puffs and the dough is very similar. This did not work at all for me though:(
