This salad dressing is off the charts insane. I think it would have been even better if I had smoked paprika, but I didn't. Just regular. I mixed the ingredients in my blender and added the EVOO through the small hole in the top of the blender. I did cut it down to half because I had a feeling that I would be the only one out of us grownups who would like it. (I was right.) More for me!

Fabulous dressing - another winner from AR!  I didn't have smoked paprika so I used regular (this will give me an excuse to go buy some). Other than the regular paprika I followed the recipe exactly and put everthing into a mini food processor and let it go.  Just the right amount of sweet and tang - I can't wait to try the smokey version!  UPDATE: I went out and bought smoked paprika and OMG this stuff is amazing! I'm hooked!

Hello fellow reviewers! I've been eyeing this recipe for some time now, and am SOOOOO glad I finally tried it! MY GOSH, this is G-O-O-D stuff - restaurant quality for sure!!! Because I was cooking for two people (i.e. my fiance and I), I halved the recipe. I used my mini food chopper/processor (rather than 'dig' out my blender) and slowly added the oil as I pulsed (I used the chop function in a pulse fashion - every few seconds or so). Perfect! Oh, and I purchased smoked Spanish paprika at my local spice shop (it REALLY makes a difference and does add that extra complex dimension to the finished product). I also made sure to use REAL stone ground mustard, not the dijon variety. Did this make a differnce or not? Who knows, but this sure was tasty! DC Girl's vinaigrette will from now on be my "house" dressing of choice when entertaining friends/family. It is just that good! Thanks for sharing, DC Girl. I am forever indebted to you :)

Good salad dressing, not fantastic. I made exactly as written but found the smoked paprika flavor a little overwhelming.

We loved this dressing!  However I had to make a few changes to suit my Weight Watchers program.  I only used 1 tablespoon of honey and made up the sweetness with Splenda.  I cut the oil to 2 Tablepoons and added 2 T of water.  Served this over an arugula salad with oranges and reduced fat smoked gouda.  The smoky dressing and the smoky cheese really complimented each other.  Thanks so much for the post!

WOW...super yummy!  We love trying new salad dressings and I found this one after I bought my smoked paprika, so had to try it!  Absolutely loved it and didn't change a thing (I normally tend to alter the oil/vinegar as I find the ratios to be off for our liking...usually too much oil and not tangy enough).  The smoked paprika is a must, gives a wonderful and distinct flavour to the dressing that would not be the same with plain paprika.  Sweet, smoky, tangy...mmmm good!  Will repeat this one for sure, thanks DC Girly Girl!

I had one lowly lime that needed to be used up when I stumbled upon your recipe - I almost didn't make it as I've been on a "bad recipe" roll this week.  But WOW!  Jackpot!  This dressing is out of this world great - the combination of lime, honey, paprika, etc is killer.  TY so much for a new family favorite.

This is an incredibly great recipe and it was a big hit here!  I used spicy brown mustard instead of stone ground just due to what was on hand, and my only onion was the size of a softball and I didn't feel like cutting in to it, so I used a couple of green onions and some onion powder instead.  Those changes were simply for my convenience at the time.  However, I did reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp and felt it had plenty of salt.  The recipe, as is, would get 5 stars otherwise.  It's fabulous!  It reminds me a LOT of the vinaigrette style bbq sauce from Salt Lick BBQ in Austin, TX.  I'll make this again and again.

Just made to stick in the fridge for a few hours before dinner.  If the taste now is any indication, I have found a new fave.  I didn't use the oregano and had some grilled onions that I used instead of raw which punched up the smoky flavor even further.  Smoked paprika is one of my favorite spices, so this is definitely not too strong for me, and next time I make it, I'll probably add more.  I can't wait to try this on a salad for dinner!

This dressing was a BIG hit in my household!  I had all the ingredients except red wine vinegar so I used sherry vinegar and it was fabulous.  I look forward to making it again.

This was pretty good.  I used regular paprika and deli mustard (or spicy?  Can't remember) because that's what I had on hand.  Next time, I'll try it as stated.  I did like it quite a bit, though.  I'm always looking for new dressings, as store-bought dressings are never as good and I get tired of the same old stuff, so I appreciate the recipe!  Thanks!

I made this for the first time last night after reading the rave reviews. It lives up to the hype 150%. I LOVE this recipe. May never eat another dressing again! The only modification I made was to do 2 cloves of garlic instead of one. I can't wait for the spring/summer so I can break this out at barbeques!

Thank you for this recipe! My husband has recently been put on an extremely strict diet to avoid MSG for migraines and has lost a lot of joy in food. This recipe has helped immensely and my son LOVES it too! It brought tasty back around here. Could be sold in stores, great recipe!

I made this as-is, without any changes, even though I was a little skeptical of the combination of ingredients (lime juice, mustard, and smoked paprika?), but it is fantastic. Be sure to blend it as you add the olive oil. This keep the dressing properly emulsified. My only suggestion is to double this because you will want more. One serving goes to the top of a standard salad dressing cruet.

Love this salad dressing! I made it as written, without the optional pinch of sugar, and it was delicious. Great in a tossed salad, wraps and as a basting sauce. Wonderful!

This is fabulous! I loved this and my husband raved.  It is very tasty and nice and light.  I stuck to the recipe and did add a pinch of sugar.  I used Penzeys Smoked Paprika.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this and put it over fresh black eyed peas, tomatoes, and diced and roasted celery, onion and peppers from the oven. Took it to a family reunion and everyone raved about the dressing and vegie combination. It was so delicious! I did change the red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup each rice vinegar and good sherry. Also left out the diced onions since I had roasted my vegies prior to assembling the salad.

This recipe has been on my "want to try" list for waaaay too long!  I finally made it last night and it is really, really good!  I served it on a Cobb Salad and wasn't sure it would really "go", but let me tell you it was fabulous!  Kind of like a spicy Catalina type vinaigrette.  This is an absolute keeper!  Thanks for sharing, DC Girly Girl!

Wow, Super easy to make and very good! Can't beat that combo. I'm trying to move away from store bought dressing, because it's expensive, full of weird ingredients, and half the time I don't like it and am stuck with a whole bottle. This was a great recipe to try out, for someone who is new to making dressing. I love that it only took up one dish too! When I first looked at it I thought "that's a lot of ingredients, I don't know if I want to bother" but then I realized I actually had all of that stuff already on hand, so I went for it. So glad I did!

I wanted something different to put on pasta salad and made this up for it. I used regular paprika. Gives a nice sweet tart taste and something different for the pasta. Really good flavor and easy, I just whisked it up in the bowl. I didn't have stone ground mustard, that would have made it even better! Thanks DCGirlyGirl.

I didn't have the smoked paprika, only plain paprika.  But I had everything else, so how could I not make it?  This was delicious and I can't wait to try it with smoked paprika.

This is a five star dressing with the regular paprika I used; I can only imagine how wonderful it must be with smoked paprika.  I've already put smoked paprika on next week's grocery list and I plan on making the full amount (I cut it down to 1 serving for myself this time).  Thanks for the recipe :)

I made this for a dinner party and I had tons of people comment how good it was. It probably helped that I put this on a Mixed greens, Strawberry, Feta, and Cranberry salad! I had one girlfriend ask for me to bring this same salad to a big get-together a few weeks later. Great recipe!

I have been not-so-patiently waiting to find smoked paprika just to make make this dressing.  My wait was rewarded:  this is a FABULOUS dressing!  I followed the recipe to a "T", save subbing yellow mustard for ground mustard out of necessity.  My guests were also impressed with this dressing and raved about it!  TY for a keeper in the LTH household.

This dressing is really good.  It is really sweet though, even though I didn't add the tsp of white sugar.  I also didn't blend it, just very finely minced the onion and garlic.  Would recommend adding more garlic, for a more spicy flavor and a little less honey.  But really delicious!

Yum! I eat salad daily and don't buy store bought dressing. I am always looking for a new dressing to make. This is going to be one of my "go to" dressings. So good.

This was different and pretty good. It reminded me of a French type of dressing, which isn't a personal favorite of mine. Probably won't make this again.8/11/12 UPDATE: This recipe is much better if you use a good honey. I used sage honey and it was sooo much better! I have made this for 2 different get togethers and everyone LOVES it!

Great dressing even my fiance liked it and he doesn't really care for vinaigrette style dressings! I didn't have smoked paprika so I used regular and I had some liquid smoke so I just added a 1/4tsp of that and it worked perfectly. Also I didnt have stone ground mustard and I substituted with spicy brown. I also used only 1/3 cup of olive oil instead of 1/2 cup and it was a little tangy, but I love tangy plus less fat!

I bought some smoked paprika in error recently, thinking it was regular paprika, so decided to try this recipe.  I make all my own salad dressing so I can control the salt and oil, but neither my husband of I were particularly thrilled with this recipe.  We thought it to be too smoky even though I followed the recipe as written.

This was pretty good but we had to add more sugar - the vinegar was very strong. We served it with a green salad with sunflower seeds, apple, and dried cranberries. It's a great colour and flavour, will make again! Thanks!

Incredible! Only change I made was to reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp, otherwise I made as written. Perfect way to jazz up a plain veggie salad.

Made just as written but left out the sugar. I let it sit for 2 days before using on a salad and it had exploded in flavor. Wow. Very, very good. Smoky, sweet and spicy. Can't wait to try it as a marinade.

This is really tasty! Used it to dress a pasta salad with black beans, roasted corn, sweet pepper, candied jalapeno, onion and crumbled queso fresco. It made a delicious side for BBQ pulled pork. The smokiness is a hit!  I did decrease the oil a bit and added more honey to the finished salad.

Fabulous dressing, I love it.   We double the recipe and make it once every couple weeks so we'll always have it on hand.  This needs better promotion!  Flavor comes out better after sitting a couple days.

Wow this is good really, really, really good!! Sweet, smokey, with a bite! Love love this one!! Mine has only been sitting for 2 hours I have another 2 hours before dinner and I CANNOT wait. This is one to try if you love smoked paprika. And the smoked paprika is a must as it brings such a complex flavor to this dressing. Thx for the fantastic recipe!!

Yum...! Made per recipe except that I used spicy brown mustard (not Dijon) in place of the stone-ground.  The second time, I used Penzey's smoked Spanish paprika and the dressing was even better.  Mine was kinda thin, tho.  Maybe I am just used to bottled, which probably has a ton of thickeners and emulsifiers and who knows what else!!!

Wow, delish!  I used the exact ingredients in my food processor and it turned out amazing!  I used baby romaine lettuce and a variety of veggies, with red onion slices, tomatoes, etc.  Mixed it all together with the dressing in a large serving bowl.  Then we added sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.  We're making it again Saturday night when the relatives visit.  My husband isn't a big fan of vinaigrettes but he said this is by far the best dressing he's ever had.  Told me to make a large batch and keep in frig.  Thank you DC!!

This is very good!  I love the smoked paprika taste---would be ideal in a steak salad.  It did seem like an awful lot of oil and honey though.  The second time I made this, I cut way back on those two components.  Thanks for a nifty idea and a great way to use smoked paprika!

This was so yummy and different! I mixed everything in my mini-processor, subbed a shallot for the onion and I reduced the honey at first to just 2 tbsp, thinking this would be too sweet.  However, I think it needed the full amount - I added more before serving and it was delicious!  I had bought hot smoked paprika but hardly ever use it - thanks for giving me another reason!

Lovely!!! I made just as written and it was perfect.  My husband loved it. I only left out salt and pinch of sugar. Used on a salad with grilled chicken.  Will never buy store bought again. The honey was just enough sweet without the pinch of sugar. And, I don't salt anything.  Other than that..... fantastic!!! Would have never thought of using smoked paprika, but it was the spice that made it all that. Yummy.

Fabulous!  I omitted the sugar, used a bit less than a third cup honey, and used dijon mustard.  It made a perfect salad dressing to go along side our grilled burgers.  I am saving the rest to use to marinate fish.  Thanks DC Girly Girl!

Very good dressing. I subbed a minced shallot for the 2T of onion and used an immersion stick blender to whip it all together, otherwise no changes. Thanks for the recipe.

I did not include the optional pinch of sugar. I bought smoked paprika just to make this and I'm glad I did; it really adds something special to the flavor. I will definitely make it again, but I guess I was expecting something more phenomenal, based on the comments. It was tasty, but it didn't make me see stars.

I have been using this recipe for over a year and absolutely LOVE it.  I have given most of my friends bottles for hostess gifts, and it is always a hit.  I have made it using all kinds of different vinegars, and it always turns out great.  The only thing I do consistently differently is use agave nectar instead of honey (same proportion) and double or triple the garlic (which I do in all recipes!!).  I can hardly eat salad w/o this dressing anymore!

Lots of ingredients, but the simplest was to describe this is "French Dressing... with a twist". Very tasty.

This is a delicious vinaigrette.  Must be left overnight to blend flavors, though.  Had a chef friend over for dinner and servied this over green salad and she raved about it.

This dressing is our new favorite. I was a little skeptical but decided to try it because of the ratings/reviews, the ingredients seemed like a strange combination. Our guests loved it, people are always in awe that we make our own salad dressings, they do not understand how simple it really is. We did not use the lime juice but it did'nt seem to need it. I did use a shallot instead of cutting up a whole onion. Our guests told us we should bottle it and we ended up dipping our bread in it because it was so good. It would be great as a marinade, I am going to try it as a coleslaw dressing, it would go great with BBQ.

I reduced this recipe to half-- its an excellent vinaigrette!! I love to make my own salad dressings,as they always are so much better than the bottle stuff you buy in grocery stores. This may be our new favorite.  We are having  a late crop of garden lettuce and  went well on my home grown greens!! It had  very good flavor. I made it as is, with no changes too. If any changes then  maybe a little  bit more sugar-- I found smoked paprika at rosaures and  walmart in my town -----I will be making again - thanks for  sharing your recipe.

I rated this 5 stars as it delivered on what the title promised, a smoked paprika vinaigrette.  I found it to be allot like Catalina which is funny because there are no tomatoes in it.  Maybe a little sweet but I added the pinch of sugar before tasting, sure it would be better without.  All in all a nice recipe to put in my rotation.  Thank-you for sharing!

excellent recipe!  smoked paprika is my new fave spice (btw recently I have found it in tj maxx and home goods half price).  I made the dressing and tossed it with arugula, toasted pine nuts, and shaved parmesan for a neighborhood party and people were raving over it.  everyone was begging for the recipe!

For me this was a 3 star recipe, but that just might be me.  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with the 4 stars.  This didn't have the WOW factor I was looking for.  It's good, but a little heavy on the smoked paprika in my opinion.

We really liked this recipe!  I halved it and followed recipe with the exception of using Hungarian paprika, which is supposed to be the best sub for smoked.  Very tasty.  I would like to use it for marinating chicken, too.

This is delicious! I did use a tad less honey and no sugar, but otherwise kept to the recipe. Normally I don't like things too sweet, but this dressing needs it because of all the acid (high proportion of vinegar plus lime juice). By making this in the blender and slowly drizzling in the oil it stays emulsified for a long time. Yummy. And yes, please do not substitute regular paprika.

I didn't have any honey,  so I substituted sugar.  I used about half of what the honey measurement was.  It turned out great!  Next time I'll try the honey.

Great dressing to go with Sue's Taco Salad from this site. I used a small whisk to combine the ingredients and as I added the olive oil with no problem. I just used garlic powder and onion powder just because I didn't feel like dealing with the real thing. Worked fine. Very good and unusual dressing.

The taste was a lovely surprise.  I think using fresh squeezed limes helps.  Didn't have smoked paprika just used regular kind.   Took it to a BBQ was asked for the recipe.  Our family loves it.

This is delicious. I admit that the first time I tasted it, I wasn't sure. But now I love it. It's the best thing I've done with smoked paprika.

Wow...this was excellent. If you don't like sweet dressings it might not be for you. But I found it was nicely balanced. I wasn't sure what stone ground mustard was but I used dijon mustard and that seemed to work well.

Off the charts delicious! I was in a big hurry to whip up some salad dressing after putting taco salad on the table for dinner and realized I was completely out. This recipe sounded wonderful so I gave it a shot. I cheated and used onion and garlic powders, used Dijon mustard because that's what I had, and used half chipotle powder to give it a little kick, and half smoked paprika. I also cut back on the vinegar a little and made up the difference with more lime juice. It didn't need any sugar, the honey was just perfect.

I made it. I ate it. I made it again and again. Hands down, this is everyone's favorite salad dressing. Smokey, sweet, tart and alive with its tangy flavor, this dressing is the most requested by my friends and family. It could easily be a restaurant signature dressing...it's that good.

This has to be one of the best dressings I have ever made and certainly the best I have ever had, I think.  Loved the smoked paprika,which I always have on hand anyway.  I've already made my second batch just to keep in the refrigerator for our next salad.  Thank you so very much for this recipe.  Such a keeper!!!!!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I want to advise anyone who is trying to lose weight by eating more raw vegetables - seek a fabulous new salad dressing every week and make plenty.  This recipe is a KEEPER big time!  I absolutely cannot wait for my next salad to have more of it.  I haven't tried as a marinade but it should be fab for that. Planning to spiralize some zucchini and try with that as well.
It stores well in fridge - doesn't get so thick that it won't pour and doesn't separate if it's been emulsified.  I bought smoked paprika a few years ago for a recipe and have been in love with it ever since.  It's a staple on my spice rack now.

I tweaked two ways added a little lime zest and I used 321 spice instead of the paprika (3 parts chili powder, 2 parts cumin, 1 part cayenne) a little heat never hurts :) 
I put in a quart deli and blended with a submersible blender 
Perfect for my cold quinoa and berry salad. or a chicken salad or potato salad nummy

I thoroughly enjoyed this salad dressing, though my significant other, after tasting it the first time has chosen to use a commercially bottled dressing instead each time I've put this on the table.  I haven't determined what it is about the dressing he didn't particularly like.  I did make one change to the recipe, however.  To make it more diabetic-friendly, I used only half the honey called for, then added enough artificial sweetener to bring it to about the same level of sweetness as the original.  

I've made the recipe twice now, and love serving it with a salad that includes fruit along with greens.  I'll continue to make it periodically for myself, even if my partner won't eat it as we typically put two different dressings on the table anyway.

Edited to add: I made this again last night. This time I increased the olive oil to 3/4 cup and used just 2 T honey and no additional sweetener.  It was sweet enough for my taste and I'll probably be making the recipe this way in the future.

My husband and I love this recipe. I do use avocado oil instead of the olive oil and omit the sugar and lime juice. We like it with a kick so we add Sriracha to it. We use this all the time. Try it!

SO TASTY! Had to substitute lime juice with lemon juice and didn't have fresh onions around (I know, what the heck?), so I used dried minced onions. Still awesome. Makes a good amount, too, so I've got dressing for days!

Had to use lemon and not lime, very good. I am sure lime would have given it a more interesting flavor.  I love the smoked paprika!

Made as directed and this was a hit.  Complimented the spicy chicken strips I sauteed and added on top of the salad quite well.  Nice change of pace from the usual vinaigrettes I make.  Thanks, I will make this again!

Amazing! My new favorite dressing -- almost tastes a bit like French dressing, but light and tangy.

This is awesome!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I have food allergies and am always looking for a wonderful vinaigrette full of flavor. This is definitely a winner!  A huge hit at our home!

O my goodness!!  This dressing is so yummy - you can practically drink this stuff lol.  I made this exactly as stated except I added way more than a pinch of sugar ( we like it sweet ).  I used my food processor and added the olive oil last, after all of the other ingredients were nicely mixed.   My husband and 15 year old daughter went crazy for this dressing!!  Thank you for sharing -  surely you won't find anything better than this in any restaurant!!

I make my own salad dressing because it's so much better for you, so I'm always on the look out for new dressing recipes. WELL, THIS ONE ROCKS!!!!!!! It is my new favorite, same for my husband and son!! I don't like to use onions though so I used a little dried minced onion and asafoetida powder to replace the onions. Girl ~ you should bottle this, it's the best dressing I've eaten....ever!! Thanks for sharing!!
