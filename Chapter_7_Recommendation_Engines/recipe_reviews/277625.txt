I made these exactly as directed, using Swiss Gruyere cheese.  The topping took regular mashed potatoes and turned them into something sexy, elegant and sophisticated. I'd gladly serve these at a fancy dinner party. Easy to make too! Loved them!

I made half the recipe but made the full amount for the topping. It was absolutely delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made mashed potatoes with chives - hubby loved it. Will make again with different mashed potato and cheese combinations. Great option for make ahead side dish.

I love potatoes. This recipe was easy to follow and met my expectations. Next time, I will copy the one review mentioning doubling the topping for extra goodness
