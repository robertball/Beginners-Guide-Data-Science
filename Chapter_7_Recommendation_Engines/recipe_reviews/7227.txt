Read all the reviews and made a few changes to recipe before trying it....

~3/4 C sugar *total*
~extra chocolate chips
~2 tea baking soda desolved in about 1/4 C warm water

They were airy (about doubled in size, and ended up with 18 instead of the 12 muffins) they are to DIE FOR!!!!  Just the right amount of sweetness and I used the Alaskan Sourdough starter as I had more than double what I needed for my batch of bread...

Will make thing again, and again, and again.  My favorite sourdogh dessert!!!!

I found this to be a very tough muffin.  I wonder if there is something I could do to improve it?

As suggested, I used 2 tsp of baking soda and 3/4 cup of sugar. I put a tsp of honey in it and used less chocolate chips. I had no problem with them rising, and they are just the normal density of any muffin, however I also had a little trouble with them sticking to the paper wrappers. Oh well. They taste pretty good, and I'd suggest giving the recipe a try.

I believe this is meant to be made with a sweet sourdough starter, such as is used for Amish Friendship Bread, tho Althea's recipe didn't clarify this. I made it with my true sourdough and found it to be very bland, without color and too heavy on the chocolate chips. Perhaps miniature choc. chips would be more appropriate.

I adjusted this recipe somewhat. I added 2 tsp. baking soda, subbed the sour cream for milk, and increased the sugar to 3/4 c. as dpoet suggested. Also used ww pastry flour(3/4 c.)and 1 c. AP flour.
The muffins were light and raised beautifully. Really delicious and yummy.

Pretty good muffins!  I omitted the oil and added applesauce instead to lower fat content.
The sourdough starter I used was a sweet starter, I would NOT use any other type of starter or
your muffin will not be sweet enough. By using the applesauce the muffin becomes a little more dense in texture, but worth it to lower the fat. Kids and hubby all liked them (made the mini size!).  Will make them again.

I used fresh picked blackberries instead of chocolate chips and I'm really sorry I waisted my berries.  I didn't mind it being not very sweet but they were too tough and very very bland.

Not too bad...not too good.  My muffins were not dense at all, which surprised me, because I just dumped everythng in.  Sourdough gives them a strong flavor, and I used a new started, but I guess this should be expected, after all it, is sourdough!  Mini chips are a good idea.

Followed recipe as given.  These had a good flavour and once you stopped expecting them to have the texture of muffins they weren't bad.  They are very dense and chewy, and more like a bread roll than a muffin, but the cinnamon with milk chocolate is nice.

Dense, hard, and unappealing flavor.  I followed the recipe to the letter and am usually a successful baker, but I did not care for this recipe.

I should have read the reviews and added baking soda.  My muffins turned out hard and too chewy and dense.  I guess my sourdough starter is too new.

I used Friendship Bread Starter for this recipe. I used half a cup of baking cocoa to make the batter more chocolate-y and cut the flour back to a cup and a quarter. I also upped the milk to a half cup because I knew the batter would be thick and cut the sugar back to 1/3 as the Friendship Bread Starter was sweet enough on it's own. Even with my changes, these weren't good. They were heavy, tough and bland. I ended up throwing them out. Sorry. I really tried.

These muffins are chocolatety yummy, and I followed the recipe exactly!  This is my first try at something sourdough.  They really stuck to the paper baking cups that I decided to use, though.  I won't use the paper cups again.

I didn't read the other reviews before making these muffins, and they turned out very dense.  Not at all light as I anticipated.  I think there should be baking powder in the recipe.  As for taste; I thought they were very good.  I added a bit more sugar (maybe 1/4 cup), and three tbsps of cocoa powder and some nuts.  I will try this again with baking powder.

I have to agree with the other reviews.  This made a very dense muffin.  We did not like it at all.  My son, who usually eats anything with chocolate chips, took one bite and put it down.

I tried these before reading the reviews and while mixing the batter, I noticed that it was very very thick so I knew these would be a heavier "biscuit" rather than a muffin. However, keeping that in mind, as well as the fact that I got distracted while adding ingredients and forgot the Cinnamon; I found these to be delicious! I used a young, regular sourdough starter and everything except the Cinnamon was added as the recipe stated. The flour I used was a whole wheat organic, the sugar was unprocessed organic, and the salt was Celtic Sea salt. These things may have made the difference.

Very tasty, but definitely more like bran muffins than super-sweet pastry muffins. I used whole-wheat starter, which gave a slightly nutty flavor that went well with the dense, slightly chewy texture.  I also used carob chips instead of chocolate--the malty undertaste of the carob worked better with the sourdough tang than I think chocolate would.  (Besides, I was out of chocolate chips.)

My batter seemed just a hair too sour to me, so I put a spoonful of honey in, and it made all the difference.

The sourdough gave the muffins too strong of a flavor. They were okay but not as good as I had hoped.
