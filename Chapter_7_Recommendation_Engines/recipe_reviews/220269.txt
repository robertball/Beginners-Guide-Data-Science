I made this and loved it, though I have to confess that I changed the recipe a bit.  (I use recipes as a jumping off point, not a strict dictate.). First, as other reviewers did; I did a rough chop of the broccoli and put in the pot with the potatoes.  Also, in the same vein of decreasing number of dirty dishes; I used an immersion blender to pur√©e in the pot.  As I didn't have any cheddar cheese, I used about 1/4 c Monterey Jack and about 1/2 c of Parmesan. I also added a little fresh dill as I had it and I love dill.  All in all, a good recipe to customize based on preferences and what you have in the house.

Really easy and done in 20 min. I added salt, garlic powder and onion powder at the end.

A good basic soup!  I didn't use a blender, preferring to put all but the broccoli in a pan while heating and stirring until everything was mixed.  Then I added the broccoli and heated it again.  It did seem to be missing just a little flavor of some other helper ingredient, I just don't know that much about adding the right things.

I also rough chopped the broccoli. I made mine in the microwave using a microwave steamer first and then dumped the water and added the other ingredients. It came out awesome!
