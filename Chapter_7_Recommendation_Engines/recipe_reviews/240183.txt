I've made it twice. It takes 10 minutes to throw everything into the crockpot and have a nice meal by dinner.
I use fresh turkey breast cut into strips. I also make my own taco seasoning and add fresh garlic and onions.  I added some black beans to give it a veggie option too.
Great basic recipe that can be modified to personal taste. Thanks!

Easily a 5 star recipe. A perfect way to use up leftover turkey. This review is short because I'm going back for more. Filed this under my TNT recipe folder.

I didnt have leftover turkey so I just used a pound of extra lean ground turkey instead. And I added onion to the crock pot. Otherwise, all the same. And it was DELISH! My husband and I cant wait to have it again!
