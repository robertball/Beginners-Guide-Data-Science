This recipe is wonderful, hearty, healthy and satisfying.I've adapted it to make my own version of "instant porridge".  I cook up a large batch of brown rice in the microwave (30 minutes on high).  I divide the cooked rice into individual servings (2/3 cup rice in each plastic bag). I add 2 Tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a handful of raisins to each and then freeze. At breakfast, remove from bag, put in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute. Stir in 1/2 cup milk, 2 Tablespoons of egg substitute (like egg beaters) and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Microwave for one and a half minutes. Stir and serve. Instant, healthy and yummy!

I like breakfast comfort foods and was pretty happy with this recipe.  Skipped the egg and thought it came out fine.  Tried subbing chopped apple and raisins the first time and used fresh blueberries and almonds the second time I made it.  Liked the tartness of the blueberries better.

Fabulous! This kind of reminded me of a cross between oatmeal and rice pudding. It's quick, easy, healthy, and if you have the brown rice, you'll most likely have the other main ingredients on hand. I did not have blueberries, so instead I chopped up some walnuts & threw them in. I put in maybe 3 dashes of cinnamon and doubled the honey. Depending on what you add in, you may want to adjust the sweetness. My family really loved this. Some of us added in fresh strawberries too. I added in the egg, but it was creamy enough even before I added the egg. I think it would be great both w/ or w/o the egg. I've posted a photo of this...

I really wanted to skip the egg.  I love eggs but it seemed weird.  I did it with the egg and it was fantastic.  Don't skip the egg you will be missing out.

This tremendously SIMPLE recipe was a real and true "find" for me. I don't like Oatmeal but I do enjoy some of the other hot breakfast cereals (e.g., farina, cream of rice, cream of wheat, etc.). At the same time, it just never occurred to me (after 35+ years of cooking for a family of 5!!!!) to use my own rice (or last night's leftovers, even) in order to "present" a nourishing breakfast. This recipe is GREAT !!! You start with the rice and then add whatever else you (and/or your family members) enjoy (for instance, banana, strawberries perhaps even grapes or raisins instead of blueberries; dried apricots, peaches or prunes are also considerations, also). IMHO, the VANILLA and CINNAMON are "MUSTS". As is the BUTTER. But, after that, just "fly" (molasses, white or brown sugar, maple -- or any other flavor -- syrup rather than honey; homogenized milk, heavy or light cream, half-and-half etc. rather than 2%, etc. etc. etc.). My family members are Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice drinkers, so that's what I've been using as our "side". But orange, apple, grape, prune juice, etc. or any one of the available "blends" would be appropriate, too; as would be a glass of milk. Thank you, thank you, thank you, cherry007, for your contribution. My family is eating BREAKFAST again!

Defenitely Five Stars!! Was looking for a wheat alternative during a detox and came across this! Although no allergies to wheat, this has become an absolute staple for breakfast. Will be making this for guests. The only change I made was using almond rice milk. I even skipped the honey and it was fabulous, although I'm sure it's even better with it! Absolutly delicious, so glad I found this!

This is yummy, healthy, easy to make and open to variations/substitutions.
I made this with some brown rice I had leftover from the chinese restaurant.  The first time I used low sugar pancake syrup (it's what I had), frozen mixed berries instead of dried fruit and omitted the spices and vanilla because I had none. The second time I used regular sugar, lots of cinnamon, a little nutmeg and 1/4 c dried pineapple.  I skipped the egg and added salt both times.  I love this recipe and will be making it for breakfast every day until I run out of rice and every time thereafter that I have brown rice.
A quick note:  There is a big difference in taste between using sweet fruits and tart fruits, so you may have to adjust the amount of sugar you put in depending on what fruit you use.  The pineapple might have actually been okay without any sugar but I had to add a lot of syrup to the porridge with the 1 cup of frozen berries.

I doubled this recipe. To make this a little creamier, I used half fat free evaporated milk. I threw in more than what was called for of dried blueberries, I want to say I at least doubled it. I also upped the vanilla to a full teaspoon. This was really awesome. Not only is it really cheap to make, but it uses low-calorie/on hand ingredients to make a hearty, warm breakfast. This would be good with almost any kind of dried fruit you have or even chopped apples (which I plan on trying tomorrow morning). I really appreciated this breakfast this morning and all of us thought it was quite tasty.

This is a great way to use leftover brown rice.  After reading previous reviews, I substituted dried cherries and toasted almonds for the blueberries but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  Very creamy, almost like rice pudding.  Will use much less butter, if any next time. It was a bit overpowering.

Excellent morning dish for us gluten intolerant folks. Since I am also sensitive to milk, I substitute vanilla coconut milk or vanilla almond milk or vanilla soy milk - whatever I have open in th fridge. I also sub agave nectar (much lower on the glycemic index than honey) for the honey. This may make a good rice pudding dessert with a half-teaspoon of vanilla added after cooking and served chilled with fresh strawberries sliced in a little agave nectar with about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.

I made this to use up some dried blueberries.  I have oatmeal almost every day of the week, and I am a huge fan of rice pudding, so I really thought that I would like this recipe.  It's just missing something. Even with the cinnamon, it was kind of bland.  I would have preferred brown sugar over the honey and raisins over the blueberries.  It's edible, and I did eat it, but I'm not giving up my oatmeal.

To speed things up, and to create a smooth-textured semolina-like end-product, I put the cooked brown rice (previously cooked in a rice-cooker) in a blender with rice milk, water, raw egg and vanilla, and blend till smooth. The mixture goes into a pot, a variety of dried fruit is added, and brought to the boil. When hot, the heat is turned off, a lid is put on the pot, and the porridge is left to stand for about 20 minutes to allow the heat to soften the fruit.   It is like having a dessert for breakfast!

Wonderful recipe-all the proportions are perfect. I doubled everything, substituted blueberries with dried cherries and in the very end added hazelnut-turned out to be magnificent. Every next time fruit and nuts can be changed.

This recipe was terrible.  Its super low on flavor and probably would've been bearable to eat (somewhat similar to oatmeal with milk) until we added the egg, which completely ruined the concoction.  If you're looking for a good rice breakfast recipe look somewhere else!

This was okay but I thought it needed a bit more sweetener...a sprinkle of brown sugar made it taste better.

I've never had porridge before so I was sceptical but it turned out great. I used almond milk instead of 2% milk which helped with minimizing the tart taste. I did add a teaspoon of brown sugar.  I will definitely make again however I will add apples and nut.

I look forward to making this every time I have rice.  I'm obsessed with it!  It is delicious.  I have made it as is, and with a variety of substitutions.  I have used white rice.  I also have used coconut, almond, and soy instead of the milk.  Many different fresh, frozen, and dried fruits, or preserves can be used instead of the blueberries.  Fresh and frozen (thawed) are best added at the end.  And any sugar or syrup can replace the honey.  Also it can be made without the fruits or sweetener, and those things can be served on the side so people have choices.  Oh and I always add the egg.  You are missing out if you don't.

This is a great way to use brown rice, and a nice alternative to oatmeal. I used almond milk, left out the blueberries (didn't have any), used more cinnamon (I am a cinnamon fan!), and used a little Stevia as a sweetener instead of honey - turned out fantastic. This would be good with a variety of fresh or dried, such as apples, bananas, raisins (more like rice pudding!), so it is very versatile.

I am so happy I tried this-it is very good and such a great way to use leftover brown rice from dinner! I put in fresh strawberries diced and dried mango diced. I was completely out of butter so I substituted 1 Tbsp. Coconut Oil. 
This was so good. Is defidently on our menu forever-I am sure I will be trying lots of differant fruits in this. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

Really good, very hearty.  Tried this using almond milk instead of cow's milk (I'm lactose intolerant), and the texture was a little strange.  It didn't thicken up quite like it should have, and I'm assuming this is why, since everything else was the same.  But the flavors are excellent, and it's very filling.  I'll be making this again, most likely with regular milk - and will keep my Lactaid handy.  :)

Very tasty!  My daughter loved it (she's a big oatmeal fan).  I used raisins and brown sugar instead of blueberries and honey since that's what I had on hand.  A keeper for when we have extra cooked rice on hand.

This was perfect for my left over rice!  I added extra blueberries since I had about 3 tablespoons frozen and I did not add the butter. Since I am gluten free, it's a great substitute for oatmeal.

My four year old LOVES this!  He loves rice, and now that he's tried it for breakfast with milk on it, it's his preference.

This is a good way to use up extra brown rice on hand.  This was my breakfast for 3 mornings in a row.  A good change from oatmeal.

Just got home from the Chinese restaurant with leftover brown rice. Searched the site, saw the reviews and decided to try this recipe. Absolutely delicious way to use leftover rice. So versatile use your favorite fruit and the sweetener of your choice. I used cranberries and blackberries as that is what I had. Ate some hot, was so good, just letting it cool and will have for breakfast tomorrow. This is definitely a keeper.

Really tasty (without the egg yolk, fresh strawberries instead of dried blueberries) but i gotta say I didn't try it earlier because the picture looks SOOOO awful. I had looked for a good brown rice pudding recipe and wanted to try this, but every time i looked at the photo I didn't think it looked appealing.

Made this with our leftover rice from last night!  Delicious breakfast treat.  It look/smelled good even before I added the eggs and butter.  Next time I will try leaving those ingredients out for a more healthy dish!  Thanks, we loved this one!  BTW, the nasty purple picture must be someone's idea of a joke.  Be sure to look at all the pictures before passing this one by.

Made vegan version. Replaced 2% with vanilla almond milk (vanilla soy would have worked, too), replaced honey with agave, deleted the egg completely, used soy margarine instead of butter. Sounds like a lot of substitutions, but I used the exact same proportions swapping animal products for vegetarian ones. Absolutely delish!

I think that this recipe is a really good idea. I think its a great way to get the kids off to school with a nutricious meal in their bellies and not the sugar bomb that cereal is. That said, my kids didnt like it. That wont keep me from giving it to them every now and then though. I liked it by the way.

This was the first time I'd had brown rice breakfast porridge, and it was good. I don't know if I'd ever have it again, and I certainly wouldn't make rice specifically for this. But since I had some leftover, it worked out.

I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't turn out that great. It didn't taste like porridge but rather like rice cooked in milk. Covering the pot while it is simmering might help. I may try putting it all in a blender for a creamier consistency. I didn't add butter since I consider it unnecessary fat. Added fresh blueberries after it was done cooking rather than dried. I don't like porridge super sweet but with this I found I had to add sweetener. I really like brown rice so I will experiment with this recipe.

Very good comfort food. Everyone in my house enjoys this. I usually omit the butter and add a little bit of brown sugar. And fresh blue berries on top.  Some nice variations are to cook in some banana slices along with the blue berries. Or use cranberries instead. Next time I make I'm going to use blackberries. If you use frozen berries and it makes it runny, allow to boil for around 5 minutes to get rid of excess water and then simmer.

This was the perfect way for me to use up some leftover brown rice from dinner two days ago!  I am pretty health-conscious so I made a few changes to lighten this up just a little.  I used unsweetened almond milk instead of 2% regular milk, used a little splenda to sweeten it instead of honey, and added some extra cinnamon.  I didn't have dried blueberries, so I made it without the fruit on the stove and then stirred in some fresh strawberries and blueberries before serving it. I didn't even add the butter at the end and it turned out so creamy!  My version was really tasty, so I can imagine that the "full fat" version would be DELICIOUS too :)  Thanks for the recipe- I'll never throw away dry leftover brown rice again!

This is really good! I usually only have fresh or frozen blueberries, so I just add them before serving along with some kind of nut - pecans are super. This would be great with any kind of berry.

This is my favorite thing to do with leftover brown rice.  I don't feel bad about it, in spite of how great it is, because it's made with brown rice and honey.  I will keep making this!!

Don't skimp on the fruit!
Thanks for the recipe!  It is perfect when the ingredients are added in the order instructed.  Add additional honey to taste.

Edit 10/27/13: I cut down on the butter, but I don't eliminate it.  I also usually quadruple the recipe so that we can have leftovers all week.  We cook up extra brown rice on purpose just so that we can have this.  Also, I have run out of dried blueberries, and Aldi doesn't carry them anymore.  I used half dried cranberries in their place, and I think they might be better!

Perfect for a bunch of leftover brown rice I had! Dressed it up by trading cranberries for the blueberries, adding nutmeg, and garnishing with pomegranate seeds (also leftover from last night) and toasted walnuts. I might try it with orange zest, ginger and cranberries next time!

I don't care for brown rice, but I had part of a bag that I didn't want to throw out, so I gave this a try. It was pretty good! I used more like 1½ cups of rice and I omitted the egg. I also omitted the cinnamon (allergies), added 2 TBS of brown sugar, and used raisins in place of blueberries. Oh, and Country Crock was a little healthier than butter... It was tasty! Not quite as glorious as oatmeal (for me, anyhow!), but a nice change and a way to use up that first-and-only-ever purchased bag of brown rice. Thanks for sharing, Cherry!

THIS IS REALLY GOOD! I've been hungry for rice pudding. This is really close, a little more runny, BUT GOOD! I'll definately make it again. I run a small daycare, and made it for a quick lunch today. They loved it!! I added the blueberries, but you could use raisins as a much cheaper alternative. We used both.

Great recipe! I also was a little hesitant about adding the egg but it came out wonderfully delicious. My in-laws loved it too and asked why I didn’t make more! I don’t like a lot of dairy so I made mine with half whole milk and half water, and omitted the butter (although strangely, I didn’t see in the instructions where to add the butter - or the vanilla extract, for that matter).  Still came out nice and creamy. Also I added the honey after it was all cooked, as I heard you destroy the good health properties of honey of you heat it past room temp. I had some candied pecans so broke some up and sprinkled them on top just before serving. Yum!

This was a good use of leftover rice! I used fresh blueberries and maple syrup instead of honey, both of which worked out great-I love how adaptable this recipe is!! One thing I noticed on some reviews, is that they left out the egg. USE THE EGG!!! It changes the texture and taste completely!! Good without the egg, fabulous with the egg! I would take a picture, but it's already gone. ;)

I was trying to find a recipe for a brown rice porridge that we were served in a fine hotel in Chicago - this one really did the trick.  I added raisins instead of blueberries, and then stirred in chopped walnuts right before serving.  I recommend using short grain brown rice, as is is more "porridgy."  Otherwise a fantastic recipe!

I used about half brown rice and half white rice, since that was what I had in the fridge. I also substituted coconut cream for half the milk just to give it a more interesting flavor. (It was so good I might use all coconut milk or cream next time!)  I only used about half the butter, and I left out the dried blueberries since I didn't have any. It probably would have been even better with them (or I'm sure raisins or Craisins would work just as well), but the result was still delicious. I appreciate that it wasn't too sweet.

I'm rating to comment.  I've not made it.  However, I just finished making a brown rice breakfast for myself using leftover brown rice (from making my dog's food!).  I wanted to offer this comment for those who want to make this a staple:  Pressure cook your brown rice using 1 part rice to 2 parts water for 20 minutes on high; natural release method.  It makes terrific brown rice for you to use in any way that you like.  For breakfast, this offers an nutritious and toothsome alternative to other whole grain cereals.  If you start with brown rice, make this cereal YOUR OWN with your palate-pleasing milk/dried or fresh fruit/nuts, sweeteners and spices.  Use the microwave and cover your dish to plump and make speedy.  I just finished mine with almond milk, a dash of cinnamon, raisins and walnuts.  Thank you for introducing many readers to the benefits of brown rice for breakfast.

Made mine with rice milk. I'm not a big fan of dried fruit so I made it into more of an Asian style breakfast. Used ginger powder 1/2 tsp or so, candied ginger pieces to taste, maple syrup for the honey, and coconut oil instead of the butter. (Also making up a pot of green tea  to complete my Asian morning :))Came out very good plus it's gluten free and dairy free for those interested. I will definitely make it again with my version. The only issue was that I had to boil it for a lot longer (probably 20 mins on high heat or longer) to get it to a porridge-like consistency and not a soup. This I probably because the rice milk is a lot thinner and has less fat content than 2% milk.

I gave this a 4 star as it just didn't shout awesome to me. It was my first time making porridge or trying it for that matter. I did make it healthy using almond milk and I used dried mixed berries to make it pretty. I did add some extra cinnamon as I love to use cinnamon. I will try some more recipes but this will probably be made again.

I made this with cranberries instead of blueberries and coconut milk instead of regular; it was good. I just would not add the egg next time. Wasn't a fan of the texture.

Excellent alternative to oatmeal. I used 1/4 cup real maple syrup instead of the honey and added 1/2 a chopped fresh peach along with the dried blueberries. Forgot the butter and didn't miss it. Also added some nutmeg to the cinnamon. Quick easy, and VERY tasty.

This was a great start. I did 1/2 cup brown rice, 1/3 cup plain honey yogurt, 1/3 cup skim milk, 1/3 cup frozen blueberries, 2 tbsp almonds and 1 tbsp honey. Microwave and enjoy...I'll see how it tastes tomorrow for breakfast!

Mmm, so good!  I used soy milk instead of lowfat, fresh blueberries (which gave it a cool, blue tint), and no butter.  It's a great way to use leftover rice and most important, it's super tasty!  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will definitely be making it again!!!

this is a good healthy breakfast. I recently found out if you coat the blueberries with flour first they will notcolor the recipe. I will try that next time.

Soooo good! I made this for 1 serving, and used Splenda in place of honey, egg sub and skipped the butter.  Also used 1% milk and fat free half and half.  Tasted like dessert:-) Was yummy and nutritous...Thanks!

Followed recipe exactly did not taste as yummy as I thought it would.  If I was in the woods camping I think I would really like it.  Will take on next trip.

Yummy!  A soft rice pudding that's appropriate for breakfast!  Just the right amount of sweetness, too.  I'll be making this again!
