This is one of my favorite recipes of all time.  The 'healthier' version is just as good as the original.

This was a big hit with my friends and family! Very easy to make. A couple of people thought there was a little too much garlic, but I liked the balance of ingredients.

Big hit with my husband and friends! I mixed up the ingredients the night before and refrigerated it. All the flavors soaking it together made it wonderful! It was "delish" as my friend stated. Definitely on the serve again list!
