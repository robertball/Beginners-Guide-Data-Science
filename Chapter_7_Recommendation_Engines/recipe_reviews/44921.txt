Easy and delicious!  I made in my food processor; if you use a processor I recommend chopping the onion, tomato, olives and basil and then adding the artichoke hearts at the end.  They only need 1 or 2 pulses to chop them coarsely, otherwise they get too fine and the texture of the salsa is not as good.  I also added feta cheese and served with pita chips and blue corn tortilla chips.  Everyone raved about this yummy dip.

Love artichokes, had to make it.  Great color, had to photograph it.  It lacked a little TA-DA!! Just bland. Not enough Italian herbs. I added McCormick's Grinders of Italian Herbs and Sea Salt.   Will wait to summer growing season to make this with oregano, basil, parsley, ect.  What ever your taste buds feel like.  Fresh herbs will be the best.  Also fresh grated Parmesan cheese enough to see it in every scoop. This is a great base just add your flavors.  At the Super Bowl party we served it on thinly sliced Italian bread, like a Bruschetta.  TASTY!! YuM!!!!

I made this for my co workers this past week.  Everyone raved about it.  Some people do not like cilantro so this was the perfect salsa for them.  I would definitely suggest doing at least a double batch if not even a triple batch, as it goes very quickly.  I also chopped it ever so lightly in my food processor so that the "chunks" were not so large...more bite size and easier to "scoop" up.  Thanks for a grrreat recipe.

I added extra fresh basil and some olive oil and served over toasted French bread to make a delicious bruchetta! Everyone loved it. The fresh basil is key though -- I wouldn't make it without that ingredient.

I used dried basil & omitted the black olives as I'm not a big olive fan.  It has a nice strong garlic taste.  If you bring this to a party, I'd suggest doubling the recipe.  Also just before serving, I'd drain it as it gets liquidy from the tomatoes.  I served it with blue organic corn chips at a party but I noticed some people just eating it with a fork.

Took this to a yoga potluck party and it was an instant hit.  Disappeared in all of 15 minutes!  Served it with organic tortilla "dipper" chips and I added extra garlic to make it more exciting.

This was phenomenal.  I might have to place this in the top 10 recipes that I like from this website. It was easy to put together & I would use it in a dozen ways.  On a pizza crust without sauce, just brush the crust with a bit of oil & spread this salsa on & bake. I would definitely use it on bruschetta as others suggested.  I think I would also try it on lettuce in place of salad dressing.  I have a few cans of artichoke hearts in my cabinet & next time I make this I will save the oil from the jar & use it to marinate the canned artichokes. I know I will be making this a lot & it will save me a few pennies since the canned artichokes are less expensive.  Can you tell I really loved this recipe??!! Thank you Julie for posting it!

This rates right up there with freshly made guacamole as my all time favorite dip.  I have never had anything like this.  It is very refreshing and the basil adds such and interesting flavor that ties everything together.  I omitted olives (personal preference) and used dried basil because it's what I had on hand.  This is going to become a mainstay in my kitchen!

Basic flavor was good but lacked spunk.  Added 2 T. lime juice and chilled for one hour.  Much improved.  Did not want to add additional salt because of sodium issues.

I made this for an Easter appetizer and it was so bland. It had no punch to it and, frankly, I was embarrassed to have brought it.  I would never make again, and made enough for 20 people.  It took time and I was very disappointed.

A quick, easy, and tasty salsa recipe!  I took this too a large gathering and it was all eaten up! I would agree with another comment that after refrigerating you should drain out the liquid at the bottom of the bowl.  Or, I just transferred the salsa to a new, clean dish, leaving behind the liquid.  Also, definitely double or triple this recipe!

This was unique.  Although I don't know if I would call it salsa.  Very light and mild.  I added 12 oz of artichokes; omitted olives and added capers.

Great salsa recipe.. although I thought it tasted a bit more like a bruschetta to me. I omitted the olives and used fresh cilantro instead of basil. Served with tortillas (that I baked and sliced in 6 pieces). This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent Recipe!  Made this, then let sit over tonight, the flavors melded great.  I doubled the recipe, and it made about a cereal bowl full (maybe a little less).  Also, I would recommend using it on toasted baguette or some type of bread, like brushetta.  It deserves it!

I'm going to give this 4 stars because although I didn't think it was that great, it was prob. because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used artichoke hearts in the can, because I was 'trying' to be healthier. I ended up adding olive oil anyway because the salsa didn't have much taste. I used a different kind of tomato too, which I didn't end up liking. The garlic and basil were very strong and overshadowed the artichokes. I'm going to give it another chance tho. This time I will def. use the marinated artichoke hearts, cut down on the garlic, use kalamata olives, let it sit for a while to allow all the flavors to mix better, and top with a little feta or parmesan cheese.

So so. Not quite what I was expecting. Jalepenos, cilantro (instead of the basil), green peppers, and lime and lemon juice would make this much more exciting.

This was very good. I suggest chilling it over night before serving. It had a very strong garlic taste so, if you are not a huge fan I would reduce the measurement to 1/2 tablespoon. We love garlic so it was perfect as is.

This was really easy to make and even better to eat. I had to make a double batch.  Also, I added fresh cilantro and it was the perfect touch for us.

Have made this twice this summer for parties and people were almost licking the bowl! I put in half basil and half cilantro instead of all basil.

if you like the ingredients you will like this. i would recommend making a day ahead so the flavors can mingle a little before serving. fresh ingredients are key to great flavor.

This is really awsome. My daughter-in-law loved it in spite of the fact she doesn't care for olives. Seved with Pita chips, would recommend the garlic or herbed flavored to enhance the overall flavor. Thanks for the recipe, this is what will go with me to the next office party.

Absolutely fantastic!  I've made this countless times in the past few months and everyone loves it!  I've passed out the recipe over and over.  So easy--throw everything in a food processor and you're done in seconds.  I did add a jalapeno once for some fire which was also good.  Thanks Julie!

Amazing recipe!  It was so easy to prepare, and  since I had everything in the house that the recipe called for, there was no trip to the store.  However, I agree with the other review...I am not sure that I would call this a salsa.

I used a regular tomato instead of plum tomatoes, and I used dried basil instead of fresh.

Three of my five children scarfed down this salsa even though we didn't have tortilla chips, but served with light wheat veggie flavored crackers. 

I thought it was just great and I'll definately make it again!

This was some of the best salsa I have ever had.  I did add some hearts of palm and I used cilantro instead of basil but it was still incredible.  This will be served at my wedding on Saturday.

This was absolutely delicious.  I just love that there is no oil or other fatty ingredients.  Even if you don't like artichokes or olives, you will love the combined flavors of this salsa.  My company who were not fond of artichokes devoured this dish.

This disappeared in a flash! I almost ate half of it before serving it to my guests. The basil MUST be fresh for this.

This is a simple recipe which is simply outstanding!  I found it because I was looking for gluten-free appetizers, and this was a hit.  I now make piles of it and keep it around - you can use it just like you would a more tomato based salsa, in addition to serving it as an appetizer.

I basically used this recipe as an ingredient guide-- i used at least 8 plum tomatoes, a can of olives, a can of artichoke hearts... Just served it at a party and it's all gone.. My fiance threatened to leave me if i don't make it again-- This is more a bruschetta topping than a salsa in my opinion so I served with baguette and wet mozzerella-- would also be good if you added capers to it (or subbed for olives)

Incredibly easy and so tasty! I'm not a huge olive fan so I leave those out. I've even made it when I had no artichokes and still thought it was yummy. But when making for friends, the artichokes sure add some "wow" factor. I've used both fresh and canned diced tomatoes with success. Now when I eat salsa from a jar it tastes awful to me.

This was an easy recipe to make and was a big hit at the party I took it to! Roma tomatos were not in season when I made this recipe, so I didn't add as much tomato as the recipe called for and it was still great! This recipe is definitely going in my recipe file!

Awesome!  I too used the food processor but left the tomatoes out of the processing.  I peeled and seeded the tomatoes and mixed them in with the artichokes.  I also added a little lemon juice and olive oil.

I made this and everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe and instead of "plain" jarred artichoke hearts I switched one out and used one jar that was spicy. Because I like heat I added about a tablespoon of sriracha sauce. Gave it a little heat but next time I'll add even more. Yum,  I will definitely make it again. So easy,

This salsa is AWESOME!  My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I made this exactly according to the recipe except that I added a squeeze of lemon juice and refrigerated it before serving.  If you like artichokes, TRY THIS NOW!

I made this a couple of weeks ago when we had friends over.  My jar of artichokes was bigger than 6 oz so I doubled the rest of the ingredients.  It was excellent!  We all loved it. The only thing I would do different is leave a little of the oil from the artichokes in to give it a little more moisture.  Will definitely make again.

This fresh artichoke dip was wonderful. I made it for an impromptu get together with friends. I served it with chips and everyone loved it though I think it would be wonderful over grilled chicken. My husband and I talked about next time we make it we will add a little olive oil and use itas a topping on fresh baked bread slices. We like to serve pesto with a little olive oil and Parmesan in it for dipping on fresh bread, this would be a great addition next to that. A healthy alternative to chips and dip. Thanks for the great recipe

Absolutely delicious!!  I don't realy like normal salsa so I made this thinking it would be an excellent alternative and I wasn't disappointed!  I did use less garlic than called for the second time I made it because my boyfriend (who LOVES garlic) thought it a bit too garlicy, and we enjoyed it more.  I ALWAYS keep some on hand now.  People at the checkout counter at the supermarket must have thought I was crazy the other day - when the marinated artichoke hearts went on sale for only $.99/jar I bought them out!!

This is such a winner.  I've made it with hearts of palm in place of artichokes as well and it's very good that way too Any leftovers can be used as a room temp pasta sauce.  I also added crumbled feta cheese and double the amount of fresh basil

This was a very good alternative to the run of the mill salsa.  I followed the directions as written.  I made one small change, I added a little bit (maybe a Tablespoon) of the juice from the jar just to moisten and help the other ingredients soak up the tangy taste of the marinate.

Fantastic! Easy-quick-delicious! Nice blend of flavors that is change from traditional salsa. I added just a dash of Seasoning salt, fresh ground black pepper, and one other ingredient that may not be familiar to some of you. I added about 1 teaspoon (or so) of a red chili sauce called "Sriracha Hot Chili sauce". You can get it at Asian markets, and some specialty stores. It is unlike any other hot sauce I have used. Many refer to it as 'Rooster Sauce', because there is a Rooster on the front of the squeeze bottle, and it is WONDERFUL! It adds the 'kick' that makes the flavors jump out in this salsa!

Was OK... a little bland, so I tried adding salt and garlic, but didn't help much.

Beautiful presentation! I have been wanting to make this for some time and just decided to do it right now. How quick and easy it all came together! Cannot wait to share this with my hubby. I loved the freshness of this recipe. Next time, I will up the basil amount a little.

Doubled the recipe and added a splash  of olive oil and fresh oregano along with the fresh basil. Chopped everything by hand as I did not want it to get too puréed .  Great fresh flavors. Served with crusty French bread. Delicious!

This was a great alternative to traditional salsa and was so easy to put together. I used kalamata olives and that added even a bit more Mediterranean twist, and I used a combination of fire-roasted canned diced tomatoes and chopped grape tomatoes. I thought the flavors came together well, and I think feta could be a great addition as well. (Note: The recipe called for marinated artichokes, but I always buy plain ones, and they worked just fine!)

I made it just as stated and I thought it was good, my husband loved it. I served with tortilla chips and sliced avacado on the side. He thought it would have been even better with fresh jalapenos so I will add them next time.

At times I've used Kalamata instead of black olives, and added balsamic or lime juice. I also finely chop the ingredients. This is so versatile- put on fish, sandwiches, etc. A little parmesan or feta is nice depending how you're using the recipe.  A few reviewers indicated the recipe as being runny from the tomato juice.  I've always removed the insides of the tomatoes and have never had this problem

Excellent flavor!  I was worried that it would be bland based on some reviews, but this was delicious.  I served it with pita chips.  The only substitution I made was using 1 t. dried basil in place of 2T. fresh basil.

This is a REAL keeper!  So very easy for those in a hurry or say they can't cook.    I fixed it for a cooking club I belong to and it was a real winner with everyone!   Tastes just wonderful, quite gourmet, most delicious.  We now have it for a light dinner with toasted baguettes.  Don't pass this one up.

Maybe I drained to much from the artichokes but this was really somewhat bland. Tried the addition of some lime juice, but that only helped a little. Ended up adding feta cheese per another reviewers suggestion and that helped. Ended up with the majority left over though. It was wonderful simmered on sauteed chicken breast though!

This was just OK. It is missing something and I'm just not sure what it is. We had it on salad and with tortilla chips. Very good on salad but needs to be chunkier on salad. I used the food processer as other reviewers suggested. We love artichoke hearts but this was a bit dissapointing.I used italian sessoning instead of fresh basil and this may have been the problem. Will try it again when I have the fresh basil growing outside my door!

I loved this new combination of fresh flavors... with pita chips was good... then I made a salad with shredded romain topped with brown rice, the salsa, and some avocado slices. Pretty on the plate, healthy, and refreshing.  I'll save this recipe for summertime!

Great Recipe. Simple & Fast! I made this for my husband to take over to a friends house to watch the game. A big hit. My 10 year daughter loved it. I made a second batch for us.

I absolutely loved this salsa. I tweaked it a little by adding jalepenos and it was very good with some heat. I was looking for a different recipe and I got what I was looking for with this salsa. Again, very good.

I had two partys at my house over the weekend, so i made a big batch of this because i wanted to try it. The first my husbands company party, they ate it but i was so busy didn't hear a lot of comments. The next day my familys Christmas every one loved it. We like to eat. The only thing i did differant was seed  tomatoes and garlic powder because i didn't have fresh. I sliced a baguette added ol. oil, garlic powder and placed in oven to serve with it. I will make this alot thank you

This definitely needs time in the fridge for the flavors to blend. I took the advice of some reviewers and chopped it a bit in the food processor, which made it more manageable on a chip, but less appealing visually. In the end, I think it would have been better served on crostini.

Yum!  I made this for a party recently and it was great.  I wanted to use artichokes in an appetizer but I wanted something a little lighter then Spinach & Artichoke Dip. This salsa was a great alternative.
