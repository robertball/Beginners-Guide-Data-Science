I loved the cake!  I'm allergic to milk, and I can't have any dairy products at all. I loved the cake though!

i made the cake without the frosting following the steps, and did not like  it....it had a sandy like texture (i guess because of the wheat flour). however i tried again, and used all purpose flour instead, and half  of dark coca & half regular cocoa.... and semisweet chocolate little bites....and VOILA!!!!  surprisingly good.

The cake is very dense and heavy. This isn't a bad thing but just different from what we're used to. You would not know any of this dessert, including the frosting, was vegetarian. And like the recipe states, the frosting (which made more than needed to frost the cake) is great as a pudding!
