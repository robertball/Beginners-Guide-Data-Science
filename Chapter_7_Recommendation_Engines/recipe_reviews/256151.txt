This is a great appetizer that's easy to make and sure to please.  The recipe can be scaled up or down very easily, if you need to make more or fewer. Another bonus: You can do all the preparation earlier in the day and just pop them in the oven when it's time.

My family loves this recipe. I make it a lot during football season. It's adapted from an old recipe from Sunset magazine. I added more garlic and cheese and less butter. It is so versatile. You can add crab or sausage to make it a more filling appetizer but we like it just as it's written. I hope you family enjoys it as much as mine.

I mixed a slice cooked bacon, guerue swiss cheese as well as the montery jack cheese. I put in my cuisnart  with 2 slices dry bread, pulsed it, add the soy.  I place the mushroom caps in pyrex dish, added 1/4 cup dry white wine, baked @ 400 (put it in not preheating. ) for 20 min. my friends raved about them.
