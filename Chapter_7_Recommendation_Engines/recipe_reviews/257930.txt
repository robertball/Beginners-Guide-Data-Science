Simple is good but as written this was too bland in my opinion. I added mushrooms which helped but it still needed more. I ended up adding Sriracha and that helped flavor the broth. I garnished with grated carrots and that was a nice touch. I think this soup has potential but as written I can only give it 3 stars.

I enjoyed it. I added canned carrots, onion, spicy red sauce, and crushed garlic. Also, I used vegetable stock. It came out spicy, but I liked the taste.
