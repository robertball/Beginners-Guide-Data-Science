Hi - this is Starflower and I submitted this recipe.  Just wanted to let you know...you never marinate fish for more than 30 minutes!  It is not like meat.  Per professional chefs.

oh my!!! this has got to be one of the yummiest things i've cooked lately!  i used organic DARK maple syrup.. natural soy sauce (tamrari) and made it in tin foil.. placed in a glass pie plate... opened during last 5 min or so and broiled it.. also drained off sauce.. reduced it in a small saucepan.. added a tiny bit of cornstarch, whisked it and poured over salmon on warmed dinner plates. Made carrots baked in the oven with a bit of butter and cinnamon and a cranberry wild/brown rice pilaf. :)  i'd say this is one my fav meals in a long time.. thank you soooo much.  i didnt use garlic salt.. i used 2 cloves of garlic and added a bit of ground sea salt... and freshly ground pepper. :):) sooo good.. will make for company for sure! :)

The recipe was pretty good as is. I would specify that cooking salmon is not as simple as placing in oven for x amount of time. You should cook salmon based on thickness.
Bake uncovered in a preheated 450Â°F oven for 4-6 minutes for each .5 inch of thickness. As others have stated, you shouldn't marinade fish for any longer than 30 minutes. If you want the flavor to really soak in, marinade in tin foil to keep the marinade on the filet.
Great recipe idea and some great alternative ideas!!

One of my favorites with this small variation. I bake in foil for 15 minutes and then break open the foil under the broiler for the last 4-5 minutes. This makes for a dryer crisper outer crust that our family likes.

This is a great recipe with one change.  Add fresh ginger... I use about a tablespoon, or a little more/less to taste.  I also don't add garlic salt.  The soy sauce is enough to add plenty of salty taste and sodium.  To marinade this, I just place the glaze in a shallow dish and lay the salmon in it, skin up.  This works perfectly.  This is FABULOUS

I have made this once.  My family REALLY liked it, especially me because it was easy.  The only thing I did different was instead of using a shallow baking dish I placed the salmon on foil,
poured on the sauce and wrapped it up so that there would be maximum sauce on salmon coverage.  I let it sit for 30 minutes as recommended and baked for about 25 to 30 minutes. No leftovers to store, no clean up and great fish...5 stars.  Good Luck!

************ Mondo- beyond extra stars!!!! This is the best way to do salmon- EVER!  In a restaurant or at home.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly- and added a tablespoon of horseradish.  (I knew it would be too sweet for us- we're spicy people here!)  This recipe is awesome and delish!  I cooked my salmon for 20 minutes and took the foil off for the last 5, spooned some of the sauce over the top after it came out and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!  Rock my socks good!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It is great!  UPDATE- made this again with thicker cuts of salmon and had to cook longer - maybe 40 mins.  The cooking time really seems to vary depending on the thickness of the fish.

I make this recipe exactly as is and I absolutely love it. If I lived on a farm and this recipe was a pig I'd want to keep it as a pet and give it only the finest table scraps. I'd probably name it Oinker, or maybe Oinkr in a pathetic attempt to seem trendy. I would keep trying to give it a collar (that would be so adorable!) but it would always find a way to get the collar off. It would get along famously with the dog. I would post an obscene amount of videos on youtube of the two of them interacting. Its family would still be brutally slaughtered but pigs aren't too bright so I don't think it would care or even notice.

Even though my husband doesn't often enjoy "sweet" meat, he likes this one. I purchased frozen salmon and made up the marinade as the salmon was thawing. The changes I made: I don't like to use garlic salt so I decided to omit it. I used light maple syrup so I added a tablespoon of dark brown sugar (which oddly added a nice sweet hint of molasses). I minced up a two small cloves of garlic and added some extra garlic powder on top. I double layered a sheet of aluminum foil and set the mostly thawed pieces of salmon in with the mixture. I folded up the foil into a bag and set everything into a baking dish and turned the bag occationally while the salmon finished defrosting. While in the oven I flipped the bag over twice more and then at the end I opened the bag and broiled the top of the salmon for just about 3 minutes so the sugars could carmelize a little. *My filets were about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick so I could beef up the flavor... maybe if yours are thinner you might add a little less, use your judgement.

This was an interesting salmon recipe.  The maple syrup is very nice for the taste buds, though personally, I'd use a little less syrup.  (I used the real deal organic maple syrup, though, so perhaps the taste was a little stronger?)  Anyway, the problem I have with this recipe is the contrasting tastes.  Although syrup sounds fascinating when pairied with garlic and pepper and soy, the flavors seem at odds and even compete with each other. Especially the garlic.  It's just not a pleasant complement, aaccording to my family's preferences.  In fact, I'd say the whole recipe competes too much with the natural taste of salmon.  So, if you're a traditional fan, and love salmon + lemon/lime/etc, you might want to stick to that.  However, if you love sweets and don't mind heavy unusual- tasting dishes, this might be the recipe for you.

I've made this twice. First following the recipe to the T and it was good, but I felt the flavor could be stronger.===  The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe and followed some suggestions posted in the reviews. I marinated it wrapped in tin foil to keep as much of the marinade on the fillet as possible. After 30 minutes, I placed the pouches on a baking sheet and baked them for 20 minutes at 400F.   While they were cooking I prepared another baking sheet with tinfoil and lightly greased it with cooking spray.   Removed salmon from oven. Very carefully I removed the fillets from the pouches and placed them on the second baking sheet, reserving the  liquid. Poured the liquid into a saucepan and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch.  Increased the oven temperature to Broil and returned the fillets to the oven for five minutes. Meanwhile, cooked the remaining liquid over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes to thicken sauce. Served over fillets. DELICIOUS!!! My boyfriend and his brother both LOVED this recipe.

I catch about 40-50 salmon a year so it is a staple food in the house. I made this recipe exactly as written, added a bit of cayenne because we like the heat. This is fantastic and simple! Most People overcook fish. I cooked for 13 mins at 360 and took the fillets out slightyly pink. By the time they are served they are PERFECT.. Remove fish from oven when slightly pink..Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty without overpowering the taste of the salmon.  I had 1-1/2 lbs. of salmon and there was plenty of marinade.  I baked for 20 mins., then turned the oven off and let it bake for another 10 mins.  I did not have any problem with the marinade burning or drying up.  I brushed the sauce on the salmon a couple times during the baking process.  Great recipe, starflower!
**Note to melodysmall:  You have to use real maple syrup.  Mrs. Butterworth, and similar brands, are just corn syrup with flavoring.  The consistency isn't the same at all.  Once you start using real maple syrup, you won't want to go back.  Try a medium or light amber.

This is a decent base recipe but FRESH GRATED GINGER IS A MUST to make this recipe a real winner; before I added it the dish was unremarkable. Ginger root keeps very well in the freezer. Grate ginger over the top to your desired taste. YUM!

Extraordinarily tasty--and beautiful to see!  I did this for guests and had rave reviews.  I followed several of the reviewer suggestions and it worked very well:

I used REAL maple syrup, added about 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, baked the salmon in a foil-lined pan for about 15 minutes, and then broiled it for 5 minutes.  It was tender and juicy with a gorgeous glazed look on top, and was very easy to clean up.

The sauce is very sweet but goes along with the salmon great.  Very similar to a salmon recipe you would get at a nice chinese restaurant.  It has an oriental undertone because of the soy sauce. I made this with a side dish of couscous.

We make salmon all the time and this is an excellent recipe! We doubled the garlic and added 2 tsp. horseradish  like another reviewer. The maple really gives this dish a unique flavor. We served with Pecan Wild Rice and spinach salad. great dinner.

I've made a recipe similar for years; it's a big hit esp. with my kids. I use FAR more garlic usually - I run 5-10 large cloves through the garlic press, until the glaze is almost a paste. Sometimes use a Tbsp. of fresh grated ginger as well. I've done this in the oven, under broiler, and on the grill with great results each time.

Excellent marinade. What I like about this is that the sauce itself is not strong or overpowering in any way. It is a nice subtle sweet maple flavor and works real well with the salmon. The prep, ingredients, directions and baking time were all spot on! I did place the salmon in an aluminum foil, along with the marinade, 30 minutes prior to cooking. The salmon baked up, uncovered, at 400 degrees in 20 minutes. The salmon flaked easily with a fork. The marinade smelled very nice. The maple sauce was delicately sweet and I like the hint of soy sauce and garlic in the marinade. The salmon was tender, flavorful and melted in my mouth...Mmm. I am glad that this dish turned out real well. Mahalo STARFLOWER for sharing your recipe.

Delicious!!! I used 5 garlic cloves finely minced and a few drops of lemon juice to make it zestier.   I double the recipe.  Wowwww this was a real success at home and my husband ate it at first as a favor to me and later wanted to eat more and more.

I have not tried this yet, but came across the recipe while looking for salmon with a maple pecan glaze. Has anyone tried adding toasted pecans pieces to this recipe? Seems like it would work.

EXCELLENT FLAVOR! I used salmon that was still on the skin, and didn't have to make any adjustments, other than marinating the steaks skin side up. I did double the sauce, and am glad I did as it may have been a little drier than we like our foods. I served this with Basmati rice, sauteed veggies, garlic toast and a salad. Kids weren't crazy about it, but they don't have a clue what they'll be missing when I'm not cooking for them!

I don't like straying too far from plain grilled salmon with lemon & onion, but this was a great way to prepare salmon!  I had about 1.5 pounds of a beautiful piece of fresh wild king salmon filet which I placed in foil, added the marinade, sealed it up tightly so all of the salmon would be covered with the sauce, & refrigerated for 30 minutes.  Placed foiled salmon in baking dish and baked for probably 30+ minutes (it was a thick filet), opening foil up for half that time and basting the fish with the sauce.  For the marinade, I used low-salt soy sauce, added an extra garlic minced clove, and substituted garlic salt with garlic powder.  The maple syrup gave it a very nice but subtle sweetness.  Thank you, Starflower!

I skipped the garlic salt, doubled the garlic, and, as always, used low sodium soy sauce.  This was absolutely delicious.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and marinated and cooked the salmon in heavy-duty aluminum foil.  I would definitely make this for company; there is no better recipe for entertaining than one that is well received by guests with no major kitchen clean up. This recipe is a gem!

When I told my 9-year-old we were having salmon for dinner, he carefully explained that he does NOT like salmon and would NOT be eating any dinner. Then he got too hungry to stay stubborn and tried a bite. Now I am under strict orders to make it again next week...and the next week...and the next week...turns out he was a big salmon fan all along and didn't even know it! :)

We are from the Pacific NW, so I have prepared salmon many different ways. As a matter of fact, I only use the standard lemon & dill, if I am going to be using it as an ingredient in a dish. That being said, this recipe gets 5 stars WAY up! :) I also followed the advice of another review that did not pour out the marinade, but instead added about a T (or so) of cornstarch, to create a very yummy sauce, while the fish was cooking in the oven. YUM & YUM, again!! :) Oh, and I did add approx 1 T brown sugar, but it would have still been 5 even without.

This was wonderful. I doubled the glaze so that I would have more sauce (it's great drizzled over rice), and cut a pound of filets into six smaller pieces. I was able to fit three into a loaf pan, toast oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, and it was perfect. A pound of salmon makes for six servings if paired with some rice and a simple stir-fry. My friend declared that she loved salmon (she'd never had it before), and I, who loves seafood, found it to incredible - compliments withotu overwhelming the taste. I'm freezing the remaining three filets after marinating them for six hours. . . we'll see if that turns out well. :-D ... [It turned out amazingly well - the fish was fine and was now saturated with rich maple/soy sauce taste without being overwhelmed by it.]

I have made this several tims...we love the sweet/salty flavor.
I am with some of the other posters here in marinating it longer-like two or three hours- to get maximum flavor.
I have marinated overnight and only noticed better flavor and no degradation of the salmon.

This was excellent!  I've had a similar recipe before, but I think this one is much better.  I took another reviewer's advice and broiled my salmon for a few minutes right at the end.  It gave it a slightly crispier crust and also carmalized the sauce just a tad more.  The sauce is excellent served drizzled over the top of the salmon.  A wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

Good dish for a non-fish eater. The maple syrup adds a little sweetness and cuts down on the fishy taste. Don't be afraid of the garlic...as it cooks, the garlic loses its pungency and actually acquires a mellower taste.

Fantastic-I doubled the recipe-then I grilled instead of baked to get some of the good crusty outside of the salmon.  I served with tri colored fettucine nests of pasta.  I then poured the leftover marinade into a 2 cup measuring cup and whisked about 1/3-1/2 c. sour cream into it and heated in the microwave so I could pour the sauce over the pasta and topped with pieces of salmon and snipped garlic chives.  WOW what a taste sensation!!

very good & very easy!  i didn't use garlic salt.  instead i used more minced garlic & plain salt.  i baked salmon with lid on for 20 minutes & with the lid off for 5 minutes, basting it in it's juices.  we love salmon & this is one of our favorite ways to bake it.

Live in Alaska so salmon is a staple at my house.  This recipe was a disappointment for my whole house.  The maple was pretty overpowering for the red salmon I used and by following the recipe exactly, overcooked as well.  400 degrees for salmon is WAY over the top, but since this was a new recipe for me, I adhered to the instructions.  Would NOT try this again.

This is simply the best way I've ever cooked/eaten salmon. A family member made maple salmon for dinner for me about 9 years ago, and I've always thought about it since. I decided to see if I could find my own recipe to try and recreate it, and I stumbled on this. It is AMAZING. I didn't change anything to the recipe except to double the sauce as I was using a larger piece of fish. I used some left over sauce to put over top of rice. It was delicious and there was no left overs. This will definitely be made many many times in our house! You haven't tasted salmon until you try it like this.

I've been making this recipe (as is) for at least a year and I LOVE IT! I just recently got a BBQ so I decided to marinade the fish for 30 min, and then put the salmon and half the marinade in a foil pocket on the grill for 20 min on med heat. It tasted even better and is perfect for summer BBQs. I will absolutely do it this way now because it's much less clean up as well.

Excellent Marinade!!! I used frozen salmon which I didnt particularly care for. But the sauce made it palatable! I will make this again using fresh salmon instead. I did add some dill which not only enhanced the flavor but spruced up the way it looked as well. I also had fresh maple syrup from Vermont which drastically increased the flavor of the marinade.

This would also be tasty on pork chops or for kabobs!

I made this again with a better salmon and it was just to die for!!!

Sooooo good!  i don't like salmon much, but DH wanted to start eating more for the health factor.  Even I loved it!  I used real maple syrup and 3 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp. sea salt instead of one clove and the garlic salt.

This was great! It is now my regular way to make salmon. The original poster was right- do not let the salmon marinate for more than 30 minutes. Additionally, I was unsure if I should cook uncovered or covered- I wanted to try uncovered to see if the salmon would be more flakey rather than like it was steamed. I've now tried cooking it both covered and uncovered and found that covered is the way to go. The salmon and the glaze came out the same either way, but when it was uncovered, the glaze had burned to my dish that I was cooking it in, so I will cook it covered with aluminum foil when I cook this in the future. Additionally, I used low sodium soy sauce and a little garlic powder instead of garlic salt (I didn't have any)- I added a very little salt to make up for this and it still came out wonderfully. And definitely use pure/real maple syrup, rather than maple flavored syrup- it makes a difference.

This was delicious and super easy to make.  I agree with other reviews, modify your cooking time depending on how think your salmon is.  Mine was fairly small & think, so i cooked for 15 minutes at 425 degrees, and it was perfectly done, yet moist.  I did marinate for the full 30 minutes too, as recommended, and I think this helps with good flavor

I didn't want the salmon to be too sweet, so I Halved the maple syrup.  It was PLENTY sweet, and I appreciate that we are eating less sugar.  I omitted the salt, and used low sodium soy sauce.  Again, this was a health choice, and it did not taste as if it needed more salt.  I added a little bit of fresh grated ginger (i highly recommend it, tastes quite nice).  Served this with home made fried rice (used brown rice and  steamed mixed veggies, friend it up with canola oil & onions).  Delicious & healthy meal, thank you for the recipe!

very simple & delicious.  I would definitely line any pan with aluminum foil when baking, otherwise it's quite the cleanup.  Served it with roasted asparagus and roasted red bliss potatoes.  Big Hit  & from shopping to plate was under 2hrs!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! It was so easy, and delicious. I made a few changes though, I used low sodium soy sauce and I put the salmon in a foil boat. (tin foil folded up around the edges) Then I added the rest of the marinade to cook.  So good, can't go wrong with this recipe!

I marinate mine in a Ziplock bag, then take them out, put them on a foil lined pan, and bake.

Excellent. I served it with whole wheat couscous and ratatouille.  As one reviewer suggested I added a tablespoon of minced ginger. You must use real maple syrup though. A few reviewers commented on the thickness of the marinade. If you're using real maple syrup! It isn't that thick. 
My only complaint is the burnt on marinade in my glass pan. I think next time I will marinate in one container and cook in another. Thanks for the excellent recipe STARFLOWER.

Very good. Read most of the reviews then decided to use 1 Tbsp of reduced sodium soy sauce instead of two, and 1 Tbsp of bourbon to try to cut the sweetness.  Next time, will grill the salmon and try the sauce as a basting liquid during the last 5 minues or so.  May add a little mustard too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. As a chef and mom I will tell you I had second thoughts about the maple syrup. My son said it is his top five recipes and wants this every week. He doesn't normally care for fish but he loves this and I don't normally rate these recipes but have to add this as a staple. Thanks for sharing Starflower. Great recipe.

You MUST try this recipe. It has become an all time favorite in my house. It's a dish that I actually crave! I only do 2 salmon fillets every time I make it but the same amout of sauce. After it is done cooking we spoon whatever leftover sauce is in the bottom of the pan on top of the done filets. DELICIOUS! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tasted and it's so easy to make! I didn't even wait for the salmon to marinate and it was incredibly delicious.

Great for those who don't like the stronger salmon-taste.

Got a very similar recipe from a local restaurant that was incredible and one I use always for salmon.  Only substitute bourbon for soy sauce and no garlic powder.  It is really something!

I have made this and it is delicious and so simple.  I also have made it with honey instead of the maple syrup, keeping everything else the same.  Wonderful with the honey, too.  When I make it with the honey, I sometimes add either fresh or dried ginger.

Great way to prepare salmon, which is a good source of omegas and not too fatty.  I've made it a few times now and I've made a few observations: First, the recipe doesn't have to be exact at all, just get the proportions kinda close.  It's nice because you can just eye-ball this one.  Second, make sure your salmon is well covered in the marinade, it's so worth it.  Third, cooking time really does vary based on thickness when it comes to fish, don't be afraid to pop the oven open and check the flakiness.  Finally, don't marinade over 45 minutes... it changes the consistency of the meal for the worse.

This is a great marinade and it works for some tender cuts of pork really well too, just let it sit overnight.  I've had to give this recipe out to 6 people now, it's a hit with anyone, even non-fish-lovers.

I love this. I only marinated the fish for 10 min, but it was fine.  I didn't have garlic clove, so I added onion powder and extra garlic salt.  I added extra soy sauce as well.  I'll be using this over and over again.

This is so easy and tasty! One suggestion is to use a garlic press or mince your garlic teeny tiny because the baking time is too short to really cook the garlic through.

This was OK, not something I'm likely to make again.  The sauce might be better on pork or beef than on fish.

Best recipe I've found here.  Have made it multiple times and have passed it on to numerous people.  The mixture of sweet (syrup) and salt (soy) with the added spice of the garlic and pepper, combined with the easiness of the recipe (hardest thing is mincing the garlic) makes this an immediate family favorite.  Great on chicken and pork as well!

When I was reading the lower rated reviews, I was a little nervous about making this recipe. I'm glad I made it because I don't know what they were talking about. This recipe was by far the best fish dish I've ever made! The maple syrup, soy sauce & garlic combo marinade was so tasty. Best of all, my husband who doesn't really eat fish, loved it! P.S. The aluminam foil is a must!

I was not keen about this recipe b/c of the maple syrup and I have a picky hubby. This was grrrreat!! He kept raving about it. Please try it out, you wont be disappointed. If you dont like to much sweet, add a little more soy sauce and a prinkle of ginger if you like. 5+++

Its been a few years since i've made fish since my husband doesnt like it and this was an excellent dish for starting up again. He gave the 'make it again' approval. He loved how it had a melt in mouth texture. I tasted no hint of saltiness as others had mentioned due to the garlic salt. One suggestion from a previous rating that I will use..they made a little extra marinade. Great for dipping any part of the fish the marinade didnt get to. Definately on my list of repeat recipes!

Loved it!  It will replace my brown sugar salmon recipe which was more messy.  I served with asparagus and wild rice.  Certainly a keeper.

I'm a vegetarian and do not eat fish, however, my husband loved, loved, loved this!  The only change I made was I used low sodium soy sauce and lots of fresh garlic (no garlic salt).  Thank you for posting this.  I'll be adding it to my recipe rotation.

This is simply terrific.  The only slight change I made was to NOT add the garlic salt (I thought the soy sauce was enough salt.)  I baked it in foil as someone else recommended, so clean up was easy.  Very tasty recipe--good enough to impress  company.

I am a huge salmon fan, but this didn't do much for me.  However, hubby loved it and said it was the best.  Since he's not a fan of seafood, if he loved it, I rate it 5 stars!  :)

I have been using this exact recipe for years now. It is hands down my most favorite meal. I make at least 3 times a month. I rarely leave comments, but this recipe is so good, that I needed to share it with others. Thanks again!!

Thank you for this fantastic recipe. My husband also raved about it non-stop and called it "orgasmic"! 
Hahaha. I did add more garlic than usual and decreased the soy sauce.

Tasty recipe.  Use a good quality maple syrup as that is the dominate flavor in this dish.  We're salt sensitive, so I used half low sodium soy sauce and half regular and used a very large clove of garlic (and no garlic salt).  I marinated for about 2 hrs before baking and my fish was done in 18 minutes (should have pulled it a couple of minutes earlier).  Check early if you have thinner salmon.  Will have again.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner party for 20 and it was a big hit.  Easy does not necessarily mean any less delicious. I pre-cut the filet pieces and cooked them in a single large tray then served with roasted winter veggies and a great rice dish. Garnish with anything to pretty up on the serving platter. Don't overcook!

This was really good. The only thing I wish was that it had more sauce because we eat it with white rice and ran out of sauce.

This recipe is easy and delish.  I did cook it a bit longer than the recipe said and it was not dried out at all.  I made extra marinade to drizzle on top right after taking out of the oven.  Made for 6 adults-including inlaws:) -and it was a hit!!  Moist, not too fishy and not too sweet....perfect!

I do not give very many 5 star dishes. Salmon is my favorite fish and this is now my favorite salmon dish. I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder due to availability but it was perfectly salted with the soy; perfectly sweet. Broiled the last 5 minutes as recommended and voila. Amazing meal!

I have been making this for about two years now and finally decided to review! Simply put, this is delicious.  Nowadays if someone is cooking salmon, I whip up the marinade and use it as dipping sauce...although my favorite version is just as the recipe calls for.

Delicious! My family loved it. I give it only four stars only because we have two other salmon recipes (brown sugar salmon and a rosemary salmon) we like just a bit better. I would rate this one 4 1/2 stars if I could.

I may never use another salmon recipe ever again.  This was utterly delicious.  Despite what other reviewers have said about marinating fish a max of 30 minutes, I threw caution to the wind and stuck it in there for about two hours.  It was great, absorbed a lot of the flavor.  I baked two thick fillets for about 35 minutes at 425 and it came out perfect.

This is really good, but if you want the true sweetness of maple syrup to shine through, you'll need to go a bit further than the recipe takes you. I had planned to do what DESIDERATAGRACEFULLY did, reducing the marinade at the end, because I knew it wasn't going to be quite sweet enough for my taste. Unfortunately even though I packed it in foil, the juices ran out (I probably should've used more foil, lol) and they burned at the bottom of the pie plate. So when the salmon was done I tasted it and found I was right about the sweetness level so I drizzled a generous tablespoon of my favorite maple syrup over it to finish and for a hint of spice I oh so lightly dusted cayenne pepper over that, then it was perfect.   (TIP: My favorite real maple syrup is really thick, they use invert maple syrup to thicken it up, Shady Maple Farms organic thick and rich is the brand.)   I did also use the fresh garlic DESIDERATAGRACEFULLY recommended and some ginger because I love that flavor with maple. Anyway, I loved it when I was done, and I think it's my personal tastes for sweet and spicy that needed to revise the recipe, so I'm rating it a 5.

I didn't think this was too sweet at all. I wonder if the difference depends on what maple syrup you use? I also baked it in foil. I like wrapping fish this way to make sure the sauce cooks ON the fish not beside it. I liked this very much. Next time I think I'll boil the sauce down (with far more garlic cloves) to make it thick before baking.

I liked the sweetness with the salmon, but the maple with the garlic on top of fish just got to me a little.  I think I'll make the same glaze but with brown suger instead of maple syrup.

Absolutely freakin' fabulous! I usually add or change a few things, but didn't feel this needed it. I cooked the fish skin-side up, it made for peeling the skin super easy afterwards. The fish was amazingly moist. Definately a keeper!

Perfect salmon marinade.  I have also added a little balsamic vinegar with excellent results.  The fish is best enjoyed when grilled on a cedar plank. The marinade caramelizes on the fish and the wood gives a smoky taste.

I really enjoyed this! Followed recipe but used less Salmon. I sauteed in a skillet w/1 teaspoon of butter and all of the marinade. Cooked over med/hi heat about 4 min per side. Poured cooked sauce over the salmon and steamed broccoli. MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!

This Recipe was excellent and easy to make. I ended up marinating the salmon for at least 4 hours before cooking it and (I marinated it in a zip lock bag so it was totally covered) the flavor was excellent. I made extra sauce by putting the ingredents for the marinate and put it in a pot brought it to a boil and reduced it to make a bit of a thicker sauce and drizzled it on the salmon before serving.

My husband and I went on a ocean fishing trip this last summer and came back with a frezzer full of salmon.  We are constantly looking for new recipes inorder not to get board with all this fish and this recipe has landed at the top of our list.  My husband being a very picky eater doesn't always take seconds but when he does I know it's a good thing.  There was not a crumb to lick off anyones plate.  We cooked it on the bar-b-q as a whole slab.  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME

I added a little fresh ginger into the mix and some lemon juice.  Also basted fish during cooking and again when it was done.

A few months ago my huband and I were at a Chinese Gala and they served terryaki salmon.  I am not really a fish lover but I loved the terryaki salmon.  I've been searching for a recipe ever since.  I've tried a few but they were usually quite complicated and didn't taste nearly as good. I didn't know if was the recipes or my lack of experience cooking fish that made them not what I was looking for. Then..... I found this recipe and thought it looked really easy - which it was!  And it tasted just like the terryaki salmon we had.  Even my 5 year old son who prefers to only eat cereal liked this one.  I've already recommended this recipe to anyone who will listen to me.  I love love love this recipe and will definately make it again.  It was even good cold the next day.

With a 5* rating and all those reviews, I was looking forward to this salmon.  It was awful.  I make great salmon with bread crumbs and lemon butter, very traditional.  This maple salmon recipe flunked.  My cats liked it though.

Didnt have enough maple syrup, so added some brown sugar as well.  Also added chili sauce to this for spice..and a touch of lemon juice.  Topped with chopped green onions after baking.  Very good.

we have made this twice and both times have DOUBLED the marinade.This gave just the right of wonderful goo to spoon over after it had cooked and thickened a bit. I used a metal pan the first time and wouldn`t recommend that.It cooked hotter and thickened the souce too much,overcooking the sauce. A glass pan worked much better. I have greater success with salmon if it is slightly frozen in the middle when I start marinading it and even when starting to bake because salmon is best when not overcooked . Thanks,this was very tasty and we`ve done alot of salmon recipes. I also just left the maple syrup on the table and we drizzled extra on our fish after cooking.Goes beautifully with forbidden rice (a purple rice available in health food stores) steamed veggies and fresh cut pineapple!

My family and I found this recipe to be just OK, not great.  We weren't crazy about the flavour mix of maple syrup and soya sauce.  Probably won't make this one again.

I made this tonight for the first time.  My wife generally does not like the "fishy" taste of salmon, but she thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Like several others, I did add fresh ginger to the marinade and it added a nice touch.  This came out top notch!!  I will be cooking this for my family again for sure.

Amazing. Wonderful.  Best salmon recipe ever. I'm not a huge salmon fan, but I LOVED this. I made this exactly as the recipe suggests except without the garlic salt. The soy sauce was enough salt. The sauce thickened up nicely as a glaze to pour over the salmon. I used this amount for 2 fillets, I would make a bit extra if I were making more portions. I can't wait to make this again!!!

I'm not a huge fan of fish, but I'm trying to eat more healthy. With so many rave reviews, and some that said non-fish-lovers were won over I had to try this. What a disappointment! Waaaay too sweet. Fish-loving husband and child also did not care for it. If I ever work up the courage to try salmon again, I might reverse the amounts for the soy sauce and maple syrup, or probably just try a different recipe.

Amazing flavor and incredibly easy and quick!

Changes I made - did not add garlic salt.  I used 4 cloves of garlic and soy sauce has plenty of salt in it.  I also added ginger.

Next time, I will cover the dish for the majority of the baking so the sauce doesn't get overly reduced.  Would have been nice to serve sauce along with the salmon as well as on the rice I prepared with this.

I cook salmon often, and was looking for something a little bit different. I did not have garlic  or garlic salt on hand, so I used freshly grated ginger and regular salt instead, the salmon was fantastic!

Enjoyed it very much, though it could have been a little sweeter.  Also, I baked it for 20min and it was a little well done for our taste.  It is a little misleading, salmon did not look done at all, but when I checked it it was, will cut down on baking time on the next one.

Tried this recipe yesterday for dinner and it turned out just wonderful from the very first bite to the last. Totally delicious, very flavorful and not overly sweet. I read a few reviews before attempting it and wrapped it in an aluminium foil bag while marinating, which probably helped. Baked in the foil for 15 min and then broiled it for another 3-4 minutes.So simple and it tastes like it took a lot of effort to make. Thanks, Starflower!

Delicious!!  I added quite a bit of fresh grated ginger to my version, which gave it a nice zing.  Also, during cooking, I kept basting the salmon with the sauce, just to give it a nice, thick glaze.

This was the most amazing salmon. My husband was a little nervous when he heard maple but the soy sauce mixed with the maker is the perfect blend.

This tasted almost like my teriyaki salmon which I make on occasion, but takes a lot less effort. Followed the recipe to the letter (just using light maple syrup to cut a bit on the calories) and they turned out perfect! Will definitely have to make this again some time!

This was absolutely amazing! I marinated it for only about 15-20 minutes. I cooked the salmon skin up for about 10 minutes, took it out and then peeled the skin off, flipped it over and cooked for another 10 minutes. Wonderful taste.

This was delicious! I was not sure if I was supposed to leave the salmon in the marinade and bake, or not. I ended up pouring off the marinade into a saucepan. I cooked the salmon in foil for 15 minutes, then opened the foil packet and baked an additional 5 minutes. I cooked the sauce down and then drizzled it over the salmon when plated. Served with Jasmine rice and spring salad. I will say that this by far is the best tasting salmon I have ever cooked (or eaten!) It flavor was incredibly wonderful! My boyfriend said he loved it! Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Lightly flavored, delicious, and so quick and easy! Perhaps I'll make it again when my taste buds are back to normal (darn cold...). My "I don't like salmon" boyfriend even enjoyed this! I didn't have garlic (not sure how that happened) so I subbed in a little sprinkle of good quality garlic powder. Our salmon was a little thinner, so it cooked in about 15 minutes... lovely dish!

This salmon was ok... I rated it three stars because it wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. It didn't have a super strong maple flavor, but most of the flavor seemed to have run off the salmon and what was left was slightly sweet but otherwise a little bland. I might have done something wrong to make it that way, but no one in my family is crazy enough about maple to really warrent a second try. Maybe if I had made a thicker maple sauce it might have been good!

This was really easy and fast.  I needed to cook it 2x as long because it was so thick.  I also used less maple and instead of garlic cloves, I used garlic jelly.

To play on the sweetness, I thought I would add in some ginger (a piece equal to the size of the garlic...and I used the garlic press to make sure it was crushed enough).  I also decided to not use garlic salt because I thought the soy sauce would be enough saltiness.  Instead, I used garlic powder.  So, here's what the family said:  My husband went on and on about how awesome it tasted; the kids thought it was a little sweet at first, but then liked it (so perhaps next time, I would keep the garlic salt instead of the garlic powder); personally, I thought it was fabulous!  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I changed it up...to be fair, this was probably a 5-star to begin with.  However, do add that ginger.  You will enjoy the sweet and slightly spicy combo all the more.

I don't like salmon but when I saw that fresh salmon was on sale, I thought I would give it one more try. This recipe is amazing! I got 2 lbs of salmon in 2 fillets. They had scales on them but I didn't know how or if I was supposed to take them off. I marinated them flesh side down and baked them as such. When they were done I peeled off the scales and reduced the sauce as suggested by another reviewer. Turned out perfect! I paired the salmon with honey garlic carrots and mashed potatoes. I was so surprised that I liked it! Will definitely use again!

Absolutely amazing. Sometimes simple is best and this is one of those times. The best way to do salmon. We had it with simple mashed potatoes and grilled fennel. We used good quality ingredients and it was a gourmet restaurant style meal. Wonderful. I can imagine so many variations in terms of sides.

This was very Delicious, almost reminded me of a honey garlic sauce. very quick and easy to make. i used a salmon steak instead and cooked it for a couple extra minutes due to the size. i had it with tabouli, was very nice becuz the fish is sweet, were as the salad is tangy and fresh, a nice combo. thanks for the great recipe.

I would give it TEN stars if I could! Not being a fish lover, that's a huge compliment from me. Besides beling delisious, it was so easy! We're having a dinner party this weekend and I had the menu all written up, but I just changed it - we'll be eating Maple Salmon. Thanks Starflower!

really delicious, thanks for sharing.

my variations to the recipe:
- I didn't mince garlic, I just crushed a garlic clove and added to the marinate so it can be easily removed before cooking. 
- I added to the marinate some fresh ginger root (about 1 inch)  cutted in small stripes, I removed the ginger before serving.
- I didn't use garlic salt in the marinade but I sprinkled few salt flakes on the salmon just before serving.

This was moist and delicious and I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation. I served it with honey cashew green beans also from this site. I marinated the fish in a small glass dish and cooked it in the same one with the fish swimming in the marinade. Boyfriend raved about it!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was not my favorite. It had good flavor if you like sweet fish. I'm giving it a 4 because once i added it to my salad ..it was sooo good. Try the brand:Marzetti's- Asian Ginger Dressing with your Salmon Salad...its amazing!

Very simple recipe that combines the classic taste of maple with the richness of salmon.  A true canadian classic.  One note regarding marinating times.  It is usually wise to marinate fish for 30 to 60 minutes max.  However, you can marinate longer, when you are not using an acid in the marinade, like lemon juice or vinagre.  This recipe can tolerate a longer marinade time, probably no more than 2 to 3 hours.  It will get more flavour, and the salmon is a hearty fish than can withstand the longer marinade time.  I would NOT do that with a more delicate filet.

Was so good and moist.  I did add a small pat of margarine on top of each piece as my family will not eat dry salmon.  What a tasty way to eat healthy, loved it.   Will make it again.

Followed recipe exactly.  It was good but nothing to rave about.  I will probably not make it again just becasue the Delicious Salmon recipe from this site was better.

This was very good.  I'm not a fish eater (it's more the texture than anything else), but i was able to eat this.  The rest of the family loved it.  We served it with steamed veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really love salmon and I didn't love this recipe.  It's strange because I really thought it would be a WOW.  It was not bad- I just didn't love it.  My husband vowed that he "did not like" salmon but ate this and said he did.  It was good but not great.  Made it exactly as written; no changes.

I couldn't believe how good this was--or how easy it was to prepare.  At the last moment, I realized that I hadn't bought one of the crucial ingredients for the salmon burgers I'd intended to make, so I was left with a pound of salmon and a hungry husband.  I found this recipe and, after a quick pantry-check, decided to give it a try.  WOW!  I made a few minor changes, but the base-recipe is utterly solid.  I used maple-flavored agave syrup instead of maple syrup, 1/8 tsp. ground ginger in place of the black pepper, a little extra garlic, and I added a healthy dash of crushed red pepper flakes.  I marinaded it in the recommended glass baking dish, then baked it at the recommended time for 15 minutes.  I then gave it 5 more minutes in the broiler.  The fish was perfect--moist, flaky and flavorful.  I served it (and the remaining sauce!) atop buckwheat cooked in chickenbroth with peas and carrots.  We gobbled up every last bit.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe--it will have a permanent place on our rotation!

I made this a while back for my husband. I bought a nice big fillet from Sams and got 4 good size servings. Used the ingredients listed except I gave it a splash of fresh lemon juice before I marinated the fish. I used a tsp of minced garlic from a jar since that was what I had on hand and I also added a tsp of grounded fresh ginger for a bit of heat instead of black pepper. I baked it baked it for 15 mins and than I removed it from the oven and drizzle the marinate over the fish with a tad more maple syrup and set it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes. Gave it a nice glaze! We ate it over a bed of rice. My husband loved it so much he went back for seconds and he scooped up some of the sauce to put it over his rice. He asked if I can make it again the next day!

I didn't really like this recipe because the salmon became wet and soggy. I even tried broiling after I baked as the review suggested which help a little but the overall texture was still lacking. Also it was too sweet.

This is a keeper! Especially for those learning to like salmon. This recipe is none too sweet that many fear. I did add 2+ cloves instead of the 1. Also, added a pinch of cayanne pepper to the marinade mixture.

I've been making this for a couple of years now.  It's my husband's favourite way to bake salmon.  You can't go wrong if you stick to the recipe.  Yum, yum, yum!!

super easy and oh so good! I didn't have time to marinate so I just mixed up the ingredients and poured over the salmon then baked. Once cooked, I poured the sauce over the fish and served with rice and veges. My husband said to make extra sauce next time.

I doubled the marinade--and used 2 filets. I always like to have more sauce! I also used about 4-6 garlic cloves (put thru a press), and omitted the garlic salt. I always use low sodium soy sauce, as well, and added about 1/4 cup olive oil to the marinade. I also reduced the marinade @ a low simmer by about a third or so, to have a sauce to pour over the fish. I put my salmon (wild) in a ziplock bag with the intention of marinating it 30 minutes. Unfortunately, my husband ended up having to work late, so it ended up marinating for about 1 1/2 hours, with no ill effects.   I cooked it as I always cook my wild salmon--bake, uncovered, at 275 for 20 minutes.  This is how I've been instructed to cook it by my salmon vendor/monger?--LOL! I'm on the Mexican border, so I order my fresh, wild salmon online. This turned out really good, but I would prefer to try it with some grade B maple syrup for a stronger maple flavor, as all I had available was grade A.  Good quantities of ingredients, just adjust according to your tastes!

This was really good!!! The only thing I changed was i didnt use garlic salt since the soy sauce is so salty. In fact, next time I will use low sodium soy sauce and still not add the garlic salt. We didnt have time to let this marinate for the full time... but it didnt seem to matter much- it was still AWESOME!!!! It can only get better with more time! Thanks for the recipe!  Oh yeah, I also added just a touch of cayenne pepper just to give it a tiny kick. YUM!

I didn't have any pure maple syrup, so used the "fake" stuff.  It was still delicious!  In fact, it was so good that I actually went out and bought the REAL maple syrup to make it again.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will make it over and over again!

Had this at a friends recently. It was really really good. My 15 month old ate most of my share! It reminds me of the pricey steak house terriyaki salmon dishes. I love salmon like this. I love salmon any which way you serve it to me but this was beyond excellent

We are a family of salmon lovers.  This recipe was awesome, easy!  I used salmon with the skins on so they didn't really absorb a lot of the sauce during the marinating time.  I did baste them with the marinade a couple of times during the baking time and this worked out perfectly.  I didn't have garlic salt but I did use one very large garlic clove.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely wonderful!  I tried this as a change from our usual salmon marinade (soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice & oregano), & will be doing it again SOON.  YUM!  My only change was to omit the garlic salt and use 3 minced cloves of garlic (& a pinch of kosher salt) instead.  WOW!

Wonderful Salmon dish!!! I doubled the marinade and added a touch of honey. Marinated only 30 min as recipe stated and cooked the salmon in the marinade basting twice during cooking. Served with wild rice and steamed broccoli. Will be my go-to recipe for salmon. Easy, tasty, and quick to boot! Thanks!

I had to write a review of this recipe (this is my first review!) because it is so yummy! My husband loves salmon, and now this is the only way he will let me make it at home. The salmon comes out so tender, and the sauce is the perfect sweet compliment to the salmon's natural flavor. I added a couple pinches of brown sugar to my sauce to add a little extra sweetness. You should definitely try making this one...it is a great "go to" weeknight meal!

This is a great salmon recipe - it is by far our favorite way to eat salmon. Here's a tip - add about 1 Tbsp. orange juice to the marinade; it adds just a little something that makes the recipe go from great to fantastic.

I live in Alaska and have a plentiful supply of salmon, which would be good except I have a strong aversion to the flavor!  But I really do keep trying because of the health benefits and the fact that I have 4 friends that have filled up my freezer with it!  I am glad I kept trying new recipes cuz this one is AWESOME!  I actually enjoy it and it is SIMPLE!  (although I don't like the smell it gives the house) Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I would add two things to this otherwise delicious recipe.  I would grease the pan before baking, and I would add a little lemon juice in the marinade for zest.

This disappeared at my last family get together.  My husband dislikes salmon and said he would eat this anytime. I would have given 5 stars, but I modified the recipe just a bit.  I omitted the garlic salt, but increased the chopped garlic to two cloves.  I also used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I marinated in a zip lock bag for 20 minutes and baked the filet (it was very large) in folded aluminum foil after adding fresh ground pepper and a bit of sea salt.  It was delicious!

I thought this salmon was so good. I did, however, make a few changes with the help of my Dad. We grilled it instead of baking it. This added a lot more flavor and a different take than just baking it. While grilling, we basted the salmon with the sauce. We also made extra sauce and served it over the salmon. Defintately a keeper. PLus, my family now says it has replaced their previous favorite salmon recipe which has been made for 20 years.

I have made this many times and it is wonderful. I don't alter the recipe at all except that I double it for more sauce. I cook it either on the BBQ or in the oven - both ways turn out awesome.

This is the easiest and tastiest way I've found to make salmon. I used to be afraid to even try fish because I'm very picky about it but turned out great. Marinated 15 mins and used low sugar syrup to cut calories and it still tasted great. Beginner level recipe but I served it to my friends and they raved about it like I was a pro. Don't ruin my reputation by telling them how easy it was!

After 3 years, this is the recipe that has prompted my first review. Not only was this recipe a snap to prepare (5 minutes - tops) it was easy to clean up (one small bowl only) and LOOKED and TASTED like something from a fancy restaurant. There is practically no way to ruin this - try it, you won't be disappointed. I even used fake maple syrup (please don't hate me) but now I am going to buy the real stuff just so I can try this again - soon.

I wasn't sure about the sweet with the salmon. This was awesome, but I did it a little different.
I took the advice of marinading the salmon longer and I made extra marinade as well (tripled the recipe and used a third for the marinade).
I boiled the extra marinade down (stir it often!) till it was just getting thick (it got thicker as it cooled). 
After a couple hours of marinading the salmon, I threw the salmon, skin side down, on the grill and basted the top with the reduced marinade.
After about 8 minutes, the salmon was just starting to flake, I turned it over till it was just down.
While the salmon was finishing, I reheated the basting sauce, drizzled some over the salmon the plates and served the rest on the side.
My husband could not get enough of it!

Oh - and be sure to use REAL maple syrup!

UPDATE: I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!  I have made it many times and have converted many salmon haters into salmon lovers with this recipe.  My son now asks for me to make salmon for dinner!  I usually marinate it all day, turning it a few times.  Just be careful to not over cook the salmon.  YUMMY!

I have made this several times and it is always delicious!  Last night I made it for company and it met with raves reviews and requests for the recipe!  I also used the same marinade for chicken breasts and they were excellent!  I left the salmon and chicken in the marinade for several hours.

Absolutely delicious and easy! Great for people who typically dislike the "fishy" taste. The marinate is very easy to prepare. If your fillet is thick, i recommend marinating it for over an hour for more flavor. I also baked in foil with the marinate. Excellent for busy, working people who want a quick, easy & healthy meal. This has been added to my recipe collection.

What a great way to get your Omega 3's!  Easy and so tasty.  My husband doesn't even like salmon and he asked for seconds.  Next time, I'll omit the garlic salt as the soy sauce adds all the salt you need.  I also basted the filets with the sauce halfway through the coooking time. Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

This was excellent! My first time being brave enough to try salmon because I was afraid it would be too fishy. I loved this! Made rice pilaf and mango/pineapple salsa to go with. Will definitely "do over".

It's fantastic and it's SO easy! Anyone that likes salmon will love this recipe. I have also read that fish should not be marinated more than 1/2 hour, but I generally marinade the salmon longer. The reason stated for less marinating time is the fish tends to get mushy. I've never had this problem with the salmon. It holds up extremely well and is always perfectly flaked. Personally, I wouldn't be too concerned about the marinade time on this one.

If you don't want a sticky mess, what I normally do is just put salt, pepper and olive oil on the salmon prior to baking, and I make a reduction out of the other ingredients on the stovetop.  I use maple syrup, soy, balsamic vinegar, garlic, sugar and some chili flakes, and reduce for about 15 mins (until syrupy).  Then pour it on top of the salmon.

This was delicious - very subtly sweet.  My only problem was that the marinade ran all over the bottom of my baking pan and burned almost instantly once I put it in the oven.  Next time, I will not only marinate it in the tin foil but bake it in there, too - I think it might help.

This was great - I didn't have the garlic salt on hand, but used big chunks of fresh garlic and it was quite tasty.  I wrapped it in foil as well and after 20 minutes at 400 degrees, it wasn't fully cooked (could be my oven), so I broiled it for 4-5 minutes and that worked nicely.  Great flavor!  Easy to do and will definitely do again!!

Fixed this for my cuz's 50th....smashing hit.  I put it on the barbie and made a boat to float the fish in the sauce while it cooked.  Everyone loved it even the guests that don't normally eat fish.

Delicious!  I expected it to be too sweet for my liking and made it because I knew my husband would be a fan, but actually it has a very balanced flavor and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I served it with asparagus and wild rice.  Will definitely make again.

We love this recipe.  It is healthy and delicious!  This recipe shows up under the "quick and easy" recipes.  Rememer, this has to marinate for 1/2 an hour.  So, the prep time is actually longer than 10 minutes and should not be listed with quick and easy recipes.

this tasted amazing!  and it was soooo easy.  i added a bit of horsradich(spell check that one)to the marinade and my husband loved it.  just when you get a taste of the sweetness from the maple syrup, a zing of garlic and spice comes in to balance it out.  great!  i would make this dish for company- so easy, so good!

Well, I have never cooked salmon before, until this recipe. I also have never eaten it before now, except in dips. I am finding that I do not like the "wild caught" flavors of fish, after also trying Mahi Mahi as well. I will use my husband's opinion of the dinner to review. He said that it had just enough sweetness and that he would definitely eat it again :). I can say that I liked that it was so easy to prepare and to clean up after. I prepared, Asian style vegtables for the side.

This is a great recipe for people who live for flavor! I thawed a salmon filet in the sauce overnight in the fridge in a zip lock baggie. I too found that marinating longer than the recommended time did NOT have any ill affects on the fish, only enhanced the flavor.  I served it over a salad with a diced granny smith apple and walnuts.  It was a huge hit, thanks!

First let me say that I rarely give a 5 star as that is "Thank God for this food!"  That said, the family gave this a 3.75 average.  The spouse and the kids each gave a 4 while I gave a 3.  I thought it needed a tad more flavor even though I used real maple, etc.

Will keep as part of our rotation.  Thanks!

Sooo suprisingly good. The salmon was so juicy and tender, the sauce was so delicate but so intense at the same time. Sweet....but I loved it. I am my worst critic and do not usually rave about what I make unless it's REALLY good, and I was raving.... over and over again, as I ate the salmon, how delicious it was! Perfectly cooked. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Thank you! My new favorite salmon recipe!

Yummy - this was really good.  It gets 5 stars because not only was it delicious, it was such a quick and easy meal to put together.  I did add about a half teaspoon of ground ginger, but apart from that I followed the recipe exactly; this one is a keeper for sure.

Our favorite Salmon recipe.  Mild flavor, doesn't overpower Salmon's delicate flavor.  I do use real maple syrup, which isn't as sweet & thick as, um, the unreal syrup! (we're from N.E, but the real thing is worth the price!)

We are HUGE salmon fans and this recipe was a discrace to salmon.  The combination of flavors was definately not to our liking and needless to say I will not be making this again!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever cooked. I was sceptical about the maple syrup but it worked beautifully! I wrapped the fillets in foil which definately kept them nice and moist. A surprisingly simple dish that will impress!

I tripled this recipe for 3.5 of salmon. Used exact ingredients and cook time. Marinated in a large ziplock bag for 2 hours. Very simple and excellent taste. everyone loved it and most said it was the best salmon they ever had. I think this sauce would make cardboard taste great. You cant go wrong.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this website!  I increase the garlic to 5 or 6 cloves and omit the pepper.  I usually cook this on my grill, so I double the sauce and marinate the salmon in half of the sauce in a ziploc for an hour.  I wrap the salmon in heavy duty foil and cook it on the upper rack of my grill for 1/2 hour.  Warm the reserve sauce and pour it over the salmon before serving.  This winter, I did cook it in foil in a glass baking dish in the oven when it was too cold to use my grill.  I found it was not necessary to double the sauce when cooked this way.  I have served this for family dinners and for dinner parties and received rave reviews every time!

This is a perfect balance of sweet maple syrup and tangy soy sauce.  It was superb with fresh green beans and sage and onion stuffing.  It smelled gorgeous as it was cooking because the maple syrup carmelized.  I think this would be great for someone who is learning to LOVE fish!

Really good we ate the whole thing both times.  It was better when we marinated it overnight than it was when we only marinated it for a couple of hours.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used one pound of salmon for two people, however I cut the rest of the ingredients in half to cut down on sugar and salt.  I also omitted the garlic salt and black pepper but used 1/2 clove of fresh garlic.  After baking for 20 minutes, I checked for doneness and determined it needed a little longer.  However the sugar from the maple syrup was burning in the dish, so I transferred the salmon and wrapped it in aluminum foil to finish baking for about another 5 minutes. I thought the salmon was quite tasty; my husband would have liked a little more maple taste but doesn't really want that much sugar.  I would make it again using the same ratio of ingredients but next time I will bake it in either parchment paper of aluminum foil right from the start.

Wow!!! This recipe was incredible!!!! So incredibly simple, and tastes wonderfull. I didn't use the garlic salt, as I thought there would be enough salt with the soy sauce, and the garlic clove had enough flavour by itself. Next time I'll try baking it in foil to reduce clean up - unbelievably making this recipe even simpler!

It was very tasty. Even my 2 and 5 year old like it. I did not add any salt, or garlic salt. But I did use 2 cloves of garlic. I also marinated it for 2 hours. It was great! Definitely a repeater. Thanks for helping me get my children to eat fish!

When I found this recipe online, I wasn't too sure, I thought it would be very sweet, but decided to try it anyway.  When I served it to my parents that night, they were amazed on good it was, as was I.  They both said, and I agreed, this is the BEST FISH I have ever tasted.

This is wonderful! First, I'm not a big fish fan and our family previously has hated salmon because of the "fishy" taste. However, we all loved this dish! We used frozen salmon patties and marinated them for about three hours. The fishy taste wasn't present and even my five year old loved it. Very easy, very quick recipe that will have you eating those Omega 3's in no time. Thank you very much for the recipe!

I don't repeat too many recipes, but my husband and I really enjoy this one. I have made it exactly as written, but most of the time now I put it on the grill.   Try it I think you will like it.  I also just put all the ingredients in a plastic gallon bag drop the fish in and rotate it over and over. Easy!

Loved this! I made it for my brother and I one night when the rest of the family was gone. It was quick, simple and I had all the ingredients already in my kitchen! I followed the recipe exactly and I can't think of anything I would change next time! We both loved it!

This is a staple in my home.  I don't change anything.  Great salmon.  I cook for 20 minutes and then broil for about 5 until sauce starts to caramelize.  Delish!

Definitely follow the recommendations of marinating and cooking in foil for 20 minutes then under the broiler for 4 or 5 minutes to caramelize the sauce on the salmon. I also added fresh ginger to the sauce recipe. After the salmon was cooked I also put the remaining sauce in a sauce pan and cooked it and added corn starch to thicken the sauce and served it over the salmon.

We loved this! Cooked in foil with the maple syrup mixture on 400 degrees, 30 minutes then broiled for 4 more minutes. Our salmon was 2" thick so extra time was needed in the oven.

I use pretty much the recipe given except I add slivered almonds to it and actually fry them when I fry the salmon with butter.  I also will do a butter, Parmesan cheese mixture (to taste) and do a quick fry with olive oil with asparagus when I serve this, one of the favorite meals from our guests and large community family.

I love this recipe! I am 20 years old and doubled the recipe making 2 pounds instead of one. It came out perfect and I couldn't have been happier. It was my first time cooking salmon so a buddy of mine who cooks fish often helped make sure it was done. I will definitely be making this more often!

Yummy! Great recipe, easy, you probably have the ingredients on hand. Only thing I have trouble with is keeping the sauce on the salmon while it cooks. I like to marinate it in the sauce for about 30 minutes before baking.

This was the very first time I ever made salmon and it was delicious!!!  My family loved it!  I used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt because I was afraid it would be too salty!  I also put tin foil over the cooking dish until the last 5 minutes!  Turned out better than perfect!  I made a 2nd batch of the glaze in a bowl, put it in the microwave until it bubbled, stirred then poured it over the salmon after it was finished! Definitely needed it!  Served with sweet potatoes and a side salad!  Will be a weekly dinner at my house!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Have used this several times with excellent results.  I add 1 tsp of lemon juice to the marinade. I also make sure the salmon is skinned an I remove some of the fatty dark-colored tissue. This is an easy, quick, delicious meal!

We're attempting to find ways to cook fish that my husband will like.  This recipe certainly fit the bill, he loved it.  I made two changes; I left out the minced garlic as I was concerned about too much garlic overwhelming the salmon's flavor and also substituted garlic powder for garlic salt as soy sauce is very high in sodium.  I cooked it in a foil packet for 30 minutes then opened the packet and cooked it for 15 more minutes.

Absolutely delicious!  I marinated the salmon, skin up, in a heavy duty foil packet for about 1 hour. I left out the garlic salt because I didn't have any.  I minced up some fresh garlic, and just used a tiny bit of salt, low sodium soy sauce, pure maple syrup, and ground black pepper. I baked it inside the packet placed inside a glass dish, for about 15 minutes, then opened the foil and broiled it for about 5 minutes.  I didn't add any thickening agents to the sauce, just spooned it as it was over the fish and the rice I served with it.  I loved it - my daughter said "Yuck, salmon is too fishy tasting for me" so I ate her portion too!! There is one small piece left, so tomorrow I'll have it for lunch on a bed of mixed greens - I can't wait!! I will definitely be making this again!! Thank you STARFLOWER for this scrumptious fish dish!!

I must start off by saying that I don't care too much for fish, so I'm always on the look out for a fabulous recipe that will change me from a "meh-fish-liker" to a "total fish lover". This recipe did it for me!

I followed the recipe to a T, using real maple syrup. After baking the fish, I poured the sauce residue into a saucepan, added a pinch of flour, and reduced it on high heat to create a glaze. 

I served my fish with white rice. I tasted it without the glaze first and found that the thinner parts of the fillet harboured a delicious flavour. The thicker areas retained the marinade flavour, just not as strong. I poured the glaze over the thicker parts of the fillet, just to adjunct the taste. 

Verdict: This recipe yielded the best fish recipe I have ever eaten. It will be a staple in my house.

Loved it, so did my 3yr old!!! We cooked it skin side up at first, then flipped it and did a quick broil to get it crispy on top. Yum yum yum! Served with roasted broccoli and cauliflower.

This recipe is a keeper! It's so easy and uses ingredients I already have. I ate it over a bed of baby arugula, spinach and chard and spooned the sauce over everything as a warm dressing. I followed other reviews and didn't use garlic salt and instead used 3 cloves of garlic. The soy sauce is sufficient for the saltiness in this dish. I love this recipe and will be making it again and again.

I work late and when I get home there are many adult faces looking for their last meal of the day.  This is a true keeper.  How many recipes out there have less than 5 ingredients (S&P don't count)that are a true winner.  This dish is totally simple, delicious and healthy using organic syrup and low sodium soy sauce.  Try it will be your go to fast meal.

Did not add garlic salt - as other reviewers stated soya sauce is already "salty" and added more garlic cloves (4 large). Otherwise, super easy and delicious - the sauce is delicious! Served with rice and green beans.

i have made this a number of times as it and loved it.   use the organic dark maple syrup and love the rich taste.  to give it a twist i added about 1/4 tsp of crushed chili peppers to add just a bit of heat to balance the sweet and it was also really good.

Simple and delicious! I used a ton of minced garlic. It baked on top and took on an amazing roasted flavor that complemented the sweet and salty glaze. I will definitely be using this in my regular rotation!

We truly loved it.  Yes- you have to enjoy fish with a sweet flavor, and YES- you have to use REAL maple syrup.  Forget the fake stuff for this recipe - it will change everything.  Also- use low sodium soy sauce-its less overbearing! I also added fresh onion, and I put a little butter on top of the salmon filets as they were cooking, I think that helps with the texture issue some were complaining about.  Served it with Indian style basmati rice, sauteed spinach, and scallion pancakes!  We both loved it and will try again with a little ginger!  Also, I used frozen salmon-I think fresh is the way to go for this one! Kudos!

I have been making this recipe for years.  I like to pile a huge heap of fresh spinach in the baking dish, and lay asparigus over it, then set the salmon on top of it all, to bake.  When it's done you have your whole meal ready and it only took one dish!

I have been making this recipe for years now and absolutely love it!!  I think the best part about it is that it is quick and easy, and regardless if you marinade the salmon as per the recipe or not, it still turns out delicious!  I have found that if I marinade the salmon overnight it is much better, but amazing non the less!

I saved this recipe 3 years ago and I wasn't brave enough to try it until this year! I didn't know how my family would react to sweet fish. The reviews were right and they loved it.
Perfect for the Rosh ha Shana dinner table.

I made this salmon recipe tonight, almost exactly as stated. Used the same ingredients and measurements. I did NOT let it marinate because I found it last minute so didnt have time, but it didnt matter. It was delicious! Definitely will be making again.

*Hint for baking salmon: Place pan of salmon in a cold oven. Turn oven on to 425 and bake 25 mins. Makes perfect salmon every time, no need to wait for oven to preheat. :)

Fantastic and easy ingredients but the sauce is very sweet so it needs some acidity.  Adding dill dijon mustard (you could use any dijon) made it FANTASTIC sauce...to DIE For with sweet and savory

really yummy with a few adjustments.  Use a little less maple syrup, don't use the garlic salt, add lime juice, dijon mustard, and little ginger.  But a great base marinade! Came out delicious, so good that my 3.5 year daughter ate it up!

I really enjoyed this recipe. A little sweet, but a real treat. I marinated skin side up so the fillet could absorb all the deliciousness. Baked skin side down.

Pretty good. I think I had high hopes though, because the recipe sounded so good.  I might try again with fresh salmon instead of frozen.

Awesome, but also followed the recommendation of another reviewer and poured the marinade off into a small sauce pan, added corn starch, and poured it over the salmon at the end. My filets were fairly thin, maybe 1.25" thick, so I only cooked my salmon for 12 min. at 400 and then broiled for 3 min. Very flaky and still very moist.

I have been making this recipe for 2 years now.  It is the only recipe I use for salmon.  Can't get past it to try anything else.  I make the recipe as is with no changes until it comes out of the oven.  I remove the salmon from the baking dish and place on a serving dish.  I transfer the remaining sauce to a small sauce pan and thicken with a little cornstarch & water stirring over medium heat.  I then spoon the thickened mixture over the salmon pieces.  Everyone I've ever cooked this recipe for loves it!

This recipe marinade tastes amazing! I used to live by the ocean and wish I had this recipe then! I am so excited to see how it tastes when it is done. It has a smokey-carmalized taste to it. I added ginger instead as per another "All Recipe " consumer recommendation... left out the garlic salt because the soysauce was salty. I also left out the black pepper. Yummy!!! Gourmet..... My husband is in the kitchen saying... "So good that Salmon!"

My family adored this dish.  I followed the directions exactly as it states in the recipe, except I used low sodium soy sauce.  Tip:  Line your pan with foil for easy cleanup when done.  I will be making this again.  I didn't have a lot of time to fuss with dinner today, and this was just the thing.  It was so easy, but tastes as if I slaved over the stove.  :)

I made this recipe today for Lunch. We really enjoyed it. I did omit the Garlic salt.I lined my baking dish in foil and then placed the lid over the top. For the last few minutes I broiled the salmon. I loved the hint of maple . It was very scrumptious! Thank you for the new recipe!

I read the reviews and decided to omit the garlic salt in favor of two more fresh cloves of garlic.  I would have loved to have added fresh ginger, but I didn't have any on hand, so I added some ground ginger as well as some chipotle powder for some extra kick - about an 1/8 tsp.  I baked it foil for about 10 min, then uncovered it for the last 5 min.  I used a bag of salmon fillets and served this with green tea jasmine rice and green beans.  Absolutely delicious!!

Say, that was so easy and so good! Timing is just right for tender salmon. I love the sweetness of the syrup combined with the savoriness of the soy sauce. One reviewer suggested adding a little fresh ginger, which sounds like a good addition. I'll try that next time, but it's perfectly delicious as is.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based on two things. 1) My family LOVED it and raved about; and 2) I do not like salmon and could actually eat a small fillet of this.  Can't say I changed anything with this recipe because when it comes to salmon, I wouldn't even know where to start to make it taste better.  Thanks for giving me a recipe that means I don't have to cook a separate meal for myself anymore and can reap the health benefits of salmon.

I have made this twice and the first time I listened to some of the other reviews and marinated it in the foil and baked it in the foil... AMAZING!!! The second time I made it I had ran out of foil and just put it on the glass pan... It just wasn't the same. It was too dry. I will be making this again but I will make sure I have foil!!!

Delicious!!! so good I didn't wait for my fiancee to finish eating hers to start writing up a review on it, I loved it, she loved it, easy to prepare and quick to finish, paired it with some roasted garlic and herbs couscous, some steamed broccoli and a couple of cold Heineken's, it is to die for! Followed the recipe to the letter and it worked out beautifully, thank you some much for sharing!!!

I am a very inexperienced cook and had only made salmon once before. I tried this recipe tonight and was amazed! It was so simple and tasted delicious! I live in Vermont so I had wonderful syrup to work with :) I cooked it in foil after I read some other reviews.

This was a lot better than some of the other honey salmon recipes. I found it to be just sweet enough. I made it with the chicken bouillon rice recipe from the site and the two complimented each other perfectly. Very pleasantly surprised. I will say it did not please the kiddos so I would not rate as kid friendly necessarily.

Quick, easy and great flavor. Not only do I love it, but the kids have discovered the like salmon as a result. Easy to feed the entire family with a 2# salmon and have some for salads the next day.

absolutely love this dish. it was my first time preparing a decent meal and I opted to cook this for my wife. She enjoyed it as much as I did!

I didn't have maple syrup so I used Honey and added a couple of slice of lemon over the fish while marinating the salmon (to rid the salmon of any raw fishy smell) and it worked.

Lovely dish!

Super disappointed. Not in the recipe- my mom and husband thought it was great. More disappointed that I just didn't like it. I guess I am not a fan of sweet w/ fish. I prefer a saltier fish and this just didn't do it for me. If you like sweet, it's probably good for you. The texture of the fish was good, though.

Fantastic salmon dish!  Very easy and very yummy!!  This is a great weekday dish because it's not a complicated recipe.  You can be creative with your sides too.  I served this with roasted veggies and twice baked potatoes (another Allrecipes recipe).  I highly recommend this recipe!

Yum! I had reduced sodium soy sauce on hand and it came out delicious! I probably only marinated the salmon for 15 min because it was a weeknight and I was hungry. Super easy - delicately sweet, nicely balanced with the salt/garlic.

I have just recently started cooking salmon, as I have never really cared for the fish before. For the life of me I cannot figure out why! This recipe was so easy and the end result was incredible! This is now a weekly staple in my household. I would definitely recommend trying this if you're looking for a new way to cook your salmon!

I love this recipe - so easy and great flavor!  The only change I make is to exchange garlic powder for the garlic salt (I don't like things too salty, so the soy sauce is plenty of salt for me).  My fiance doesn't like fish normally, but he loved this recipe and asked to have it again the next week.  It's worth it to get good (real) maple syrup, but I tried it with Hungry Jack syrup once when we were out of the real stuff, and it still had a great taste.  I like to serve it with a brown rice/wild rice blend and steamed carrots.

Wow!  I am not a fish lover but this recipe has changed my mind.  It was amazing!  Great flavors!  I followed the advice of another reveiwer and baked in foil for 15 minutes (to avoid burning the garlic), then opened it up under the broiler for the last 5 minutes, basting with the sauce often.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The salmon was so moist and delicious.  I am going to add this to my dinner rotation for sure!  Thanks Starflower!!

I thought this was pretty good but my husband thought it was too sweet.  I forgot to turn it in the oven but it wasn't necessary to because the flavor soaked through.

This is a delicious way to prepare salmon!  I did use tamari instead of soy and sprinkled gamachio (sesame seed/seaweed mixture) into the marinade.  We also drizzled the marinade over our fish as a table condiment.  We'll do this again, on the grill, and perhaps on tuna or salmon steaks!

I just made this last night and I will be making this ALL the time. I doubled the sauce/marinade and ended up just letting it marinade for about 10 minutes as I was pressed for time. It was perfect.

I've used this recipe many times. I do baste the salmon during the cooking process. I cook the salmon until there is just a little bit of give in the thickest part of the fillet when pressed with a fork. I've also wrapped the marinated salmon in foil and cooked it on the grill.

This was amazing! I first marinated the salmon with the glaze for an hour and then when I cooked it I spread on more fresh made glaze. I also added sliced jalapenos on top of the salmon as it cooked to add a little more flavor. me and my boyfriend LOVED it! Thanks!

This was my first time following this recipe and it came out wonderful.
The only thing I changed was that instead of marinating for 30mins.,
I poured it on the fish and just baked it with aluminum.. Wonderful recipe

I'm not normally a big salmon fan nor sweet foods..but this recipe was great! I'll definitely be making it again. I used honey because I didn't have maple syrup and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt for same reason and put just a dash of red pepper flakes.

I followed this recipe exactly (except using low sodium soy sauce, but I'd hardly count that as an alteration) and it turned out wonderful!  Perfect balance of salty and sweet, perfect texture of the sauce (marinade) without having to add anything to it.  I cooked the salmon a little longer than 20 mins, just because I had some thick filets, but the flaking method is really my preferred test for fish.  I'd recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to bake a savory, unique salmon dish.

Fantastic, even my non-salmon fan of a boyfriend wants me to make it again!

Definitely adjust the cook time as necessary, the steaks I used were pretty thin so 20 minutes would have overcooked them.

Totally Awesome! It finally was the combo of ingredients in a marinade I was looking for to put on salmon. I added some butter and a squeeze of half a lemon on top of the salmon before pouring on the marinade....it turned out perfect! Thanks.

The marinade is good.  It doesn't completely penetrate the fish just from marinating for 30 minutes, so if you want to mask the taste of the fish, I'd suggest setting aside some of it before marinating the raw fish in the rest, bake your fish (12 minutes at 190 C worked for my smaller piece), then cut up the fish into pieces and pour the marinade that you set aside (that did not touch raw fish) over the cooked fish pieces.   That will help hide the salmon flavor, if that's your goal.  I am new to cooking salmon, but this sauce is good, I don't find it too sweet at all, used real maple syrup and soy sauce, a large garlic clove, and just plain salt and pepper.

This was great! I made the recipe as is with the exception of wrapping the salmon in foil with the marinate and cooking it in the foil. Really, really good!

I tried this recipe with suggestions from reviewers to marinate salmon in aluminum foil instead of in a glass plate. Followed directions, but increased # garlic cloves to maybe 6 (we love garlic!). We cooked our salmon steaks in the aluminum foil on the bbq instead of in the oven, and they turned out fabulously! The flavour was excellent and it was delicious! Probably the best way I've ever eaten salmon! We're about to make it again for dinner tonight! Would definitely recommend anyone to try. It was SUPER easy for someone who doesn't cook much!

Quick! Easy! Delicious!  I made this today for the first time. I marinated it for 30 minutes (15 minutes on each side).  The only alteration I made, was adding 1/8 tsp of grated ginger to the marinade.
This dish came out fantastic!

Five stars due to the uniqueness of flavoring salmon this way.  This is a solid, uncommon dish.   Nice variation from lemon juice and dill...

The sauce can also be used as a good dipping sauce for grilled chicken.  We cooked out at work today for lunch, and both the grilled salmon and grilled chicken went with the maple sauce very well.

I put the marinade/sauce in an 8x8 aluminum foil pan, put salmon in, placed (covered) in fridge for 30 min.  Took out, wrapped in aluminum foil (poured a little marinade on bottom of foil before sealing), threw on a med/med-high grill for 15 minutes.  Came off the grill light-pink and perfect.  Made a second batch of the maple sauce for dipping.  Zer gut!

Very good dish. This is a great meal if you have folks that are not really fans of fish.   

The only thing that I changed is that I used a baster to re-coat the salmon a few times during the baking time. It also took about 40 minutes total to bake not the 20 listed.

This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE salmon recipe I have ever tried. It's amazing and so much better than any salmon I have had in any restaurant. My salmon was thick and it took about 35 minutes at 400 degrees. I can't stop making this recipe!!

Oh my!!! Just finished making this and it was so tender and juicy. I was worried the maple syrup would be overwhelming in taste but it was just perfect. This is a perfect recipe to impress your friends and family with (and soooo easy!)

On the right track - simply add a tablespoon of minced ginger to the marinade and it turns to 5 stars real quick.

Superb!  I cut this recipe into quarters and I use it frequently with one 4oz. salmon fillet.  It's easy to make just one serving!  I like to use butter rich maple which adds a different twist to it.  I favor this over plain teriyaki glazes any day!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe, I have made it several times and my family loved it.  I used Organic Maple Syrup, Tamari Sauce, and Cayanne Pepper.  Thank you all for the information on marinating fish for only 30 minutes.

I am a big fan of salmon, but sorry, this just didn't do it for me.  It could be that I am not a fan of sweet flavors in fish.  But I also felt that there was a distinct flavor of both maple and soy when I was eating it.  I was hoping the flavors would "blend" together better.  I only kept it marinating for 20 minutes.

Yikes!  I guess with 4.5 stars and 1,500 reviews I had higher expectations. No one in my family cared for it. I followed the directions and the result was an overly sweet, overly garlicy, overly salty flavor that was not enjoyable.  I used real maple syrup (is that sweeter?). There goes a pound of wild salmon, which makes me sad. :(

This was a very good, almost asian style salmon recipe. I made this dish exactly as the recipe called for, including marinating the fish for only 30 minutes and the result was very good. The salmon has a nice sweet flavor from the maple marinade, without overpowering the fish. A very nice alternative to the usual lemon flavor or spicy salmon recipes out there.

This was excellent. One comment: be careful about overcooking. My fillet was only about 3/4" thick, and therefore was done in about 10-12 minutes. I think the 20 min cooking time refers to 1-2" thick fillets. Will definitely make again.

Not crazy about salmon - did it mainly for the health benefits. The maple syrup (not a cheap $$ ingredient) gave it the best (read: sweet) flavoring it could have. Overall, a good tasty dish (for fish).

Quite good.  I used pure maple syrup made fresh from the sap of the Wisconsin sugar maples that my mother gave to us.  We served this with white rice.

This is a wonderful recipe with great flavor using just a few ingredients.  It takes no time at all to put together and is great for a weeknight meal.  I am going to try this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs tonight.  The chicken is marinating in the fridge.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!

essentially teriaki base.  We added a full teaspoon of crushed chili pod w/ seeds-still very sweet glaze overall.  It was good.  Apreciated the suggestions to use of foil!  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely tasty!!  My wife had huge doubts using maple syrup on salmon.  I also had a little bit of doubt because we had the frozen fillets from Costco.  I cooked the salmon as it said to on the bag, and I used the marinade posted here.  My wife and I LOVED it!  I wanted to make more but ran out of salmon!  Time to make a trip to Costco :)

I made this as per the directions with one tweak.  However just a minute or two before it was ready to come out of the oven I sprinkled brown sugar on the salmon and put the oven on broil. Watch it carefully so it won't burn and then pull out when the sugar is bubbling. It was perfect. I also glazed the salmon with the sauce 3 times throughout the cooking process.

Excellent recipe - very tasty!  I just have two recommendations:  1) Add 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar to the marinade - I like a little bit of extra sweetness; 2)  Cook each fillet in a little foil packet.  Wrap each one in aluminum foil (leaving some space for the air to circulate inside) and cook at 425 F for about 15 minutes.  Doing this makes the fish super moist and very flavorful!  Overall, great recipe!  It tastes great and it unbelievably easy to make!

Very good recipe.  And very easy.  I didn't think it was at all too sweet....it was just what I expected from reading the recipe.  My husband didn't love it as much as I did, but he's not a big fan of salmon anyway, so his vote doesn't count.  If you like salmon, and you understand....surprise, surprise...that maple syrup is sweet, you will like this recipe.

We absolutely love this recipe!!  The only thing we have done a little differently is double the marinade.  This way we have more left after it is done cooking that can be poured over the fish when served.  I have also cooked the salmon in a saute pan while spooning the marinade over it.  Both ways turn out super yummy!!

Very, very good.   We actually grilled this after marinating for 30 minutes. The salmon had a bit of a glaze over it with a slight maple flavor. DH said what ever you soaked this in, do it again next time!

Like some others, we did things a little differently from the recipe.  Instead of marinating the fish in the fridge, we just made an aluminum foil boat and put the salmon in with the maple syrup mixture on top.  We closed the boat up and stuck the whole thing in the oven to bake.  It turned out pretty good.

I have never rated a recipe before.  This was so delicious I felt I had an obligation to rate it and recommend it.  I followed the recipe as is and could not get enough of it.  And I truely dislike salmon.  I have tried it in the best of restaurants and just can't eat it.  Thank you for a recipe that my entire family loved.

This is a wonderful easy salmon recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, the only caution I have to give you is to watch the cooking time. I have made this more than once and the first time I made it I followed the temp/cook time and my salmon came out over cooked so adapt to the size of your fillets.

This is great!  I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It was the perfect combination of savory and sweet.  Be sure to use real maple syrup, not the fake stuff!  I marinated and baked in a foil packet - makes cleanup a breeze.  I highly recommend this recipe!

"Perfect combination of sweet and salty" raved my friend. She though the fish had a good "asian" taste to it, just like her mom makes at home.

Excellent.  I made it according to the instructions - the only change I made was I inadvertently grabbed the jar of garlic and ginger paste instead of just garlic (I use this instead of minced garlic and we love it) - so I got a little ginger flavor into the marinade.  My husband said it was wonderful.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Starflower for a great recipe.

This was the BEST salmon I have ever made. I used real maple syrup and I think that is a MUST. I served it with a side of whole wheat couscous with sauteed veggies and it was fantastic! I cooked it 10 minutes per inch of thickness, and it came out just great!

This was delicious! My husband and I are on diets but we desperately want to keep taste and flavor.  Thank you for this one.  Even my kids wanted seconds. I served it with fresh spinach sauteed in olive oil and fresh garlic.  I did not have maple syrup the second time I made this.  I used mollasses, worstershire sauce and soy sauce. It was just as good.    Also, I marinated it a few minutes less than the recipe said...guess we were just hungry...and the sauce is devine with one little slither of toasted bread as a garnish.  It tastes good and makes a great presentation.  I am putting this one in my "entertainment" category.  Thanks Starflower!!!

This is my favorite recipe for Salmon! I usually bake the salmon in foil packs when I make this instead of a baking dish, easy clean up and it keeps the salmon really moist!

My husband and I were not fond of salmon until we tried this recipe.  We both loved it.  Since then I have ordered it at our favorite restaurant where they use just maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard.  I am going to try this variation next.

W...O...W.  This recipe was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't want anything too sweet, but I wanted something different than the other 2-3 salmon recipes I make all the time.  I followed CourtneyGriff's suggestion and added horseradish! Here were my modifications: 1) 2 cloves garlic instead of 1  2) Omitted the garlic salt 3) Added 1 heaping TSP. of horseradish (was afraid of adding the recommended 1 TBSP, but I think the amount we added cut the sweetness perfectly) 4) Wrapped in foil for about 25 minutes, then broiled on low for 3 minutes.  Probably could have broiled longer - it didn't get crispy on the outside.  This was the moistest salmon with just the right touch of flavor.  Perfect enhancement.  Thanks for the recipe, Starflower.  We will make this often!

Wonderful! I made this dish for my boyfriend and his grandmother the night I met her for the first time, and they couldn't stop complimenting me on it! I just added a few crushed pecans on the top of the salmon before placing them in the oven, and the nuts really complimented the dish! Thanks so much for such a simple, tasty dish!!!

This salmon was fantastic! I was skeptical at first because I thought it would be too sweet 1/4 cup of maple syrup, but it turned out really good. The only thing we did different was to grill it instead of baking it, we prefer this way. Served with roasted vegetables and baked sweet potato. Thanks for sharing your recipe Starflower!

What a fantastic recipe! It was simple, quick and used ingredients that I had in the pantry! I placed the salmon fillets in a foil âboatâ and let them marinade while the oven heated. Then placed the boat on a baking pan and cooked for 20 minutes. They came out perfect and there was no clean up!! I will definitely be making this again.

This was a very easy recipe for a quick...I just got home what can I make for dinner??  If you have salmon on hand of course. The syrup was not too overpowering.  Just PLEASE make sure you use REAL maple syrup.  You will not get the same taste with an imitation.

This is absolutely delicious! After making this several times, I've decided that doubling the marinade is the way to go. You can easily reduce it on the stove-top until it reaches the consistency of a glaze, or thicken it with cornstarch to create the consistency of a sauce. We always omit the garlic salt, as soy sauce tends to be salty enough on its own. I think the addition of ginger truly adds to this dish, whether you use dried or fresh minced. Add it to taste. Also, if you don't have maple syrup, table syrup makes a great substitute though it may taste a little sweeter. You can do this on the stove-top as well, but I find it less flaky and juicy as opposed to baking the salmon in the oven. Great with rice and steamed vegetables.

Very good.  My kids love it.

I spiced this up for my husband and me.  I just used maple syrup, low sodium soy sauce and added 1 T of chilie garlic sauce (the kind from asian markets)and eliminated all the other ingredients.  It was excellent.

Sorry, but we did not care for this recipe!.. I don't think that sweet goes best with fish!...  The reviews were promising since so many others liked it, I guess it just wasn't for us!  I'll stick to my dill butter on salmon, or another recipe on this website "Hudsons baked Tilapia" has a delicious dill sauce that pairs well with salmon.

I was so worried that this recipe would come out too sweet, we do not like dinner foods to be sweet usually, but I still tried it, because it sounded like a nice change from my plain salmon recipes. I am so glad I did! It was sooo good! My 9 year old could not get enough of it, and wanted me to make this all the time. For a boy that usually shies away from salmon, I think that says something! I served it with some rice cooked with peas, and salad. Wonderful recipe! Not too sweet. Perfect balance of sweet and salt.

I didn't want to heat up the house, so I made this salmon by cooking it in a skillet with the sauce. The sauce is absolutely fabulous, although with the skillet, I would probably cook the salmon a bit before adding the sauce because the sauce got reallllly sticky! But the recipe is great!

Really yummy!  I love grilled salmon so after marinating the salmon I bbq'd it for 5 min on each side, and simmered the reserved marinade on the stove. I served the fish drizzled with the sauce, rice and roasted broccoli. Delicious easy dinner!

Really enjoyed this.  Super easy and great taste.  Marinated for 30 minutes.  I did add some ginger to the mix and 3 garlic cloves.  Cooked in a shallow dish for 20 min.  Should have spooned some of the extra sauce at the end of baking over the salmon for more flavor.  Highly recommend.

Why Allrecipes never put this in their cookbook is beyond me. Clearly a fan-favorite, this dish is easy, healthy, and a crowd-pleaser for anyone who even remotely likes fish. 

With only 6 common ingredients, this is and my absolute favorite recipe (and easiest), I've already hand-written this recipe down and put in cookbooks of recipes I give as gifts (don't worry, I add the URL at the bottom to give the original inventor credit)! This recipe also works well just to marinade and grill the salmon over charcoal- wood chips, especially cedar, make this a recipe to rival any frou-frou restaurant (and gas grills just ruin the true flavor of almost anything)!

I made this for my husband and 14yr old.  My teenager could not keep quiet about how good this was!!  They both LOVED it!!  I only made a couple changes - added green onion and another clove of garlic and a bit of salt because I did not have garlic salt.

One week later, they both are still talking about it!  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe - very easy, marinate and bake in the same dish.  The only change I made was to use low sodium soy sauce, as my husband is watching his sodium - it did not affect the flavor at all!  We make this almost weekly.

Since I'm a HUGE baby when it comes to eating a type of fish that actually tastes like fish (heaven forbid!), I used the exact amount of ingredients listed for the serving of 4 people for just me and my husband, which turned out to be a little more than half a pound of salmon.  Since I'm not a huge salmon fan to begin with (and my husband can't get enough of it), I'm always trying to find creative ways to make salmon w/o having the taste overpower me.  This recipe does the trick.  SO worth trying.

This recipe was great. The sweetness of the maple balanced the fish taste. I am a huge garlic lover so I added a little extra garlic flakes just before we ate. I think that made it even better with a nice balance of sweet and salty. This is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again and again and again! A+!!!

This recipe has become a staple in our house.  The salmon has great flavor - the only thing I modify is to add extra garlic, and omit the garlic salt.  The soy sauce usually has enough salt that you won't need any extra.  Very easy prep and cleanup!

This was very quick and easy to make, and my husband and my 7-yr-old both loved it.  My husband said that salmon has to be done just right to be good, and he gobbled up almost a whole pound of this!  My 4-yr old didn't like it, but she's picky.  I personally hate fish, and this was no exception, but I liked that it didn't stink up the house and required very little working with the fish.
I omitted the garlic salt because I don't use it so I didn't have any, but it still has plenty of sodium from the soy.

There's not much to be said about this recipe than what has already been said!  We've made this recipe about 10 times over the last year and we never tire of making it!  I'm a big fan of having it with a nice almond rice pilaf as well :-)

Fantastic!  So easy to prepare, and my family loved it!  I especially liked how you marinate it in the baking dish, and it goes straight from the fridge to the oven.  The flavor is just right, not overdone sweetness, but a great combination of flavors.  I used jarred garlic with ginger, since I was out of plain garlic, and it was delicious.

This recipe is phenomenal!  My husband and I could hardly contain ourselves while eating our meal.  We both daydreamed about its yumminess the next day and are looking forward to using the maple glaze with stir-fried veggies, chicken and possibly tofu.  Yum!!!!

Wow!  This recipe is truly great for the colder months!  I only made one minor change, and that was to omit the garlic salt and instead use two cloves of fresh garlic.  I may try adding some fresh ginger in the future as other users have mentioned, but it turned out to be a wonderful dish last night "as is".  I served it over some brown basmati rice and topped it with the remaining sauce, along with a side of roasted broccoli made simply with fresh garlic, olive oil and a hint of red curry paste.  My husband even gave me the "so are you going to have seconds?" look and dove in to finish off what was left in the dish!  I will be adding this to my recipe book with pride!

I followed the recipe except I used 1/4 cup maple syrup to 1/4 cup soy sauce and doubled the recipe. 1/2 went onto the fish in the marinade.  I added another quarter cup of maple syrup to the remaining 1/2 of the original mix, heated to boiling, then simmered on low  for about 10 min. Added 1/4 cup chopped pecans 1/2 way through. Removed from heat and then mixed in 2 or 3 tablespoons cream (I can't remember how many tablespoons, but cream makes it taste a little bit like maple caramel-just add to taste.)   Delicious!

I followed the advice of my chef friend, and you all should too!  Don't bake it!  Cook in a skillet for 5-10 minutes with a buttered sheet of parchment paper on top of the salmon.  It comes out very moist this way, and it cooks all the way through in a very short amount of time.  Also, don't worry if your salmon doesn't cook all the way through.  It's not like chicken; it's ok to eat some of it uncooked!  I also used real maple syrup, I think that was key to the flavor.  I normally don't like salmon, but this was awesome!  I'll definitely be making it regularly.

This was really delicious. I have never cooked salmon and the taste of this meat was GREAT! I only made two b/c I wasn't sure if we would like it but I ended up not having one to myself. The hubby and daughter ate it all. Good recipe. Thanks!

Lovely! A tiny bit sweet to my taste, hubby loved it though. Next time I will try to add the ginger, see if that gives it more of a twang. Still, a great recipe!

I loved it, but it wasn't my husband's favorite.  We have another recipe that is almost identical but uses butter and brown sugar instead of the maple syrup.  I thought this one was great, though, and my 2-year-old ate every bite of hers.  Made it with double the marinade and used the extra to drizzle over the salmon and also our rice.

This is a great salmon recipe!  The only thing I did to it was to double the sauce.  That made plenty and it was soooo good with potatoes.  I love simple and great tasting recipes.  I have another salmon recipe I love and now I think I'll flip flop between the two!

I made this recipe over the weekend and it was really good.  To give it some added flavor I cooked a second serving of the marinade at very low heat.  I also whisked butter into the marinade while it cooked, making it creamier.  Once the fish was done I spooned some of the cooked sauce on the fish.  Excellent recipe.

Excellent! I used sugar free maple syrup, low sodium soy sauce and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Like other reviewers I doubled the sauce and served the grilled salmon on brown rice with grilled veggies. Thanks for making salmon taste so good.

This was a simple recipe, and tasted the same. I added brown sugar which created a nice sweet/tangy flavor. Also, make double or triple the sauce... for after baking.

My family enjoys sweet flavors so this was hit. I noticed comments stating the fish could have marinated longer however keep in mind fish is not poultry or red meat. Trying to marinate longer than 1 hour won't intensify the flavor nor will the flavors reach the interior, so save your time.

This is simple, fast and absolutely delicious.  I've been a member for 7 years, using this site regularly for recipes.  Not until now was I moved to make a comment.  My marinade time was cut short because my boyfriend was coming home early and the salmon still turned out superb.  Awesome!

I have no constructive criticism of this recipe . However, having taken the time to make this recipe per the exact instructions, I feel entitled to say:"I didn't like it". I used real maple syrup and for those on a budget, you know what I'm talking about, better left to using brown sugar for a glazed salmon recipe.

A very tasty recipe. I prepare fresh salmon at least once a week and this is a definite keeper. I took the advice of other reviewers and added chopped pecans (2 tbsp) on top of the salmon before cooking. Company recipe.

We made the substitution of honey in place of maple syrup; added 1tsp. fresh ginger & substituted 1minced garlic clove in place of garlic salt.  This is a simple & delicious recipe.

the best salmon recipe by far! i have tried many, and liked them, but this one is soooo good. for people who dont like salmon much because of the fishy taste, this recipe will taste good to you also. i didnt use garlic salt, since it is always too salty for me. i just used regular garlic powder and 2 cloves of garlic. turned out great!!!!!
new entry.... i used this for chicken also. i quadrupled the recipe, still not using garlic salt. i did add a little splash of white wine also. turned out very very good!!!!

Awesome. I added ginger garlic, a dash of Chinese Five Spice, and salt (instead of garlic salt) and pepper as I used light soy sauce. This recipe is fantastic just the way it is, but have fun playing with it. I also grilled it over charcoal. Delish!

Excellent!  Even my picky husband ate it up.  One thing, though - if you cook it too long, the maple syrup makes a black, sticky mess.  Just watch how long it's in the oven.  Very, very tasty fish.

This was the first real meal I had ever cooked, and I paired it with sesame green beans and rice. I made it last-minute to celebrate Valentine's Day with my fiance, who is a food buff, and he LOVED it! It's simple enough for someone who's never cooked before (like me), yet very delicious - a sure winner :)!

I used "real" maple syrup, did not use garlic salt but instead of ground pepper, I crushed peppercorns and pressed salmon into it after i took out of marinade.

The best salmon I have ever eaten. So easy, so yummy! I added a little honey to thicken the glaze up. My husband(who doesn't usually eat salmon) loved it. Delicious!

Delicious.  Took the advice of commenters and wrapped the salmon in foil to marinate and cook -- it came out juicy and delicious.

This is a great salmon recipe.  Be sure to marinate for no longer than 30 minutes.  I had a 2.5 pound fillet and I cooked it about twenty minutes.  It was about 2 inches thick but not uniformly.  The fish turned out fork-flaky and very flavorful.  This was a very easy fish recipe.

The maple flavor was excellent, but the sweetness did not soak into the salmon enough.  I am going to try to marinate for 24 hours and check sweetness.  The edges were fantastic!

I had never cooked with maple syrup before but was convinced by the reviews. I followed the recipe precisely, and found that the flavor of the salmon was subtle, but the remaining sauce was a nice dip. I also recommend cooking the last 5 minutes uncovered- the fish was initially cold.

Hold on to your hats, this one is a KEEPER!  My reluctant husband kicked his legs in delight after tasting this salmon!  The flavor is delicate, delicious, and I didn't have to jazz up the recipe at all.  I cannot understand why some people rated this one low, did they use the wrong kind of syrup or something (I used Grade A dark amber)? I'd have to say this is perhaps the easiest and best salmon recipe I've ever made! I did marinate mine in a ziplock bag and next time I think I'll make extra sauce to serve along with the salmon - I was scraping up the sauce from the corners of the pan.  Fabulous all around!

A friend of mine recommended this recipe as one that her non-fish-eating husband would eat. I had it as one of the entrees for Christmas dinner and it was great. Also...I kept it in the marinade far longer than the recipe instructed (24 hours, forgot it!) and it really didn't matter, it wasn't "cooked" by the marinade. I had leftover uncooked filets and froze them. They tasted even better once thawed and baked. Almost candied. Tastes great on its own or topping a salad.

I've made this twice now and it got rave reviews both times.  My husband and college-age son both loved this.  Easy and elegant enough to serve for company.  Served it with roasted asparagus and red potatoes for a really simple meal.

I didn't think I'd find a better recipe than the honey dijon with pecan salmon I love, but this one is amazing!  It's very flavorful and the different ingredients really mesh well!  I have to admit I was surprised, but I think this might be my new favorite.  It was a lot like the $42 salmon I got at my fancy birthday dinner!  I wrapped it in tinfoil and cooked for about 25 mins.

I've never been a big fan of fish, but with EVERYONE agreeing upon the health benefits of salmon, I decided to bite the bullet and hunt down some recipes so we could have salmon on a regular basis.  This was the first recipe I tried and was a wonderful surprise!  It took about ten minutes to prepare, the ingredients were items I usually have on hand, and it tasted great!  My husband loved it too, so it will become a permanent addition to my collection of recipes.  The only change I made was to increase the marinade so there would be plenty.  (1 1/2 was just right.)

This was just delicious! As always, I used an extra clove of garlic. Instead of the garlic salt, I used granulated garlic as the Soy Sauce is really  salty enough. Added a hefty sprinkling of red pepper flakes and served with white & wild rice and the Green Bean & Mushroom Medley recipe also from this site. We both went back for seconds last night. Thanks, STARFLOWER ~ great recipe!

Very good, however, felt it was lacking a little spice.  Tried adding some red pepper flakes which helped a little.  Overall, it was quite tasty, but not sure I will make again.  Glad I tried it.....BTW........my oldest son enjoyed it and rated it a 4.5...but my youngest son tried one bite and that was it....

Wow!  This was SO good!  I really, really loved it.  What a good combo for salmon.  Make sure you use pure maple syrup!  I followed the recipe exactly, except instead of the garlic salt, I used garlic powder, and reduced sodium soy.  Served with Ginger Veggie Stir Fry and brown rice.

I make it in a frying pan. To make the sauce thicken and stick to the fish, cook it quickly on high.

This was good. I would recommend baking it in foil so that it will stay moist -- it is very easy for salmon to dry out.

This was INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS and EASY!!  I can't say enough for this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly (used real maple syrup) except that I finely crushed up walnuts (pecans would have been good, too) and put on top of salmon right before baking, then carefully spooned the marinade on top of the walnuts.  I baked for 10 minutes, then spooned the marinade again on the salmon and baked for the remaining 10 minutes; 20 minutes was the perfect cooking time.  I've had a dish that tasted exactly like this in one of my favorite restaurants, so I will surely be making this often!

This recipe is divine!  The maple glaze would be wonderful on other meats, too.  I'll be trying it on chicken next.  I used real maple syrup (not just maple flavored) and doubled the glaze recipe since my salmon piece was around 1-1/2 lbs.  I didn't think it would be fully cooked in only 20 minutes, but it was!

This recipe didn't seem to make any sense to us. The flavors of maple, garlic and salmon just didn't go together.  I get super-fresh salmon and we like it without anything sweet on it.  Just thought I'd try this for something different but it wasn't a good idea.

this is a really brilliant idea that works for chicken as well as salmon. I actually flipped the ratio of syrup to soy around, as it was a bit too sweet. Sauce cooks up really nicely and mixes in well with roast vegetables.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I just cooked it for my husband, his father and my 4 boys and everybody loved it.  I followed the advice to line a pan with heavy duty foil and baked for about 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I even used regular old pancake syrup.  I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with a tomato/pinapple salsa and garlic mashed potatoes.  So good.

I had a similar dish at a restaurant that included sauteed red onions.  It was really good!  I would add butter-sauteed red onions to the maple, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper mixture.

This is a wonderful recipe. The maple gave it a wonderful flavor. However, I would recommend marinating overnight since the flavors do not make it past the outer edge in 30 minutes. Broiling gives it a crispy and tasty outside while baking it gave it a greasy mouthfeel.

Oh my!  What a great recipe.  I have lived all my life in the Pacific Northwest in a fishing family where salmon is almost a staple and this is one of the easiest and tastiest salmon recipies I have ever made.  I baked the fish in the marinade and, although it mad a bit of a mess, the fish was fantastic and very moist.

This recipe is great!  I marinated the fish overnight.  I think it helped infuse the flavor.  I did make the mistake of adding the leftover marinade when I baked the fish.  It ended up being a baked-on mess!  However, the end result is a great piece of fish.

Good recipe, but I was expecting more based on the reviews.  I marinated my salmon for exactly 30 minutes, but if I were to do it again, I would marinate longer.  I just didn't taste the maple/soy/garlic taste after cooking. (perhaps running it under the broiler for a few minutes after cooking would bring out some of the flavor?)  And I would highly recommend you line your pan with foil - - cooked maple syrup can really be a mess to clean up!

My brother made this recipe for my family and it was great.  He marinated it for most of the afternoon, then coated the salmon in ground black pepper to seal in the flavour.  Excellent and Easy!

This is quite possibly the best salmon recipe I have ever tried.  I love the combination of the sweet of the maple and the salty of the soy sauce.  I use real maple syrup (it really makes a difference in my opinion...) and doubled the sauce to drizzle over the cooked salmon when it was time to serve.  Great recipe!

My husband made this dish for me for Valentine's Day, and it turned out beautifully! The flavor is delicate, and all of the flavors of the marinade blend very harmoniously. I too would double the marinade recipe, as it tastes good drizzled over the finished salmon and rice at the end. I will make this recipe many times! Thanks Starflower!

This was a really delicious and simple preparation. We eat salmon at least once a week and this was a nice change from the usual pan roasting. The recipe is so easy that my 4 year old put the marinade together with me. My 2 year old loved the fish and ate a full portion.

Yum. This is good.  It is tasty, easy, and healthy. I doubled the marinade and saved half  for after baking  and before serving. I served salad greens. My salmon cooked in 12 minutes.  So so good.

This was fantastic with asparagus and garlic parmesan roasted red potatoes.  Added like 1/4 teaspoon of sesame oil to the marinade.  Gave a great flavor to it.  Other than that, did not change a thing!

Excellent recipe. I made a second batch of the marinade and added three Tablespoons of honey to it and tossed russet potatoes in it and then baked them with the salmon. I had a little leftover marinade and I used to season sautÃ©ed mushrooms, onions and garlic which I topped the cooked salmon with.  Itâs become my wifeâs favorite meal.

SO GOOD! I modified only slightly- I put 3 garlic cloves and used regular salt. Like other suggestions, I also baked it first in foil packets, then placed the fillets on a sheet under the broiler just to crisp the edges a bit. I placed the liquid in a pan with a sprinkle of cornstarch to make it thicker and spread a bit onto the salmon. Served it with rice and asparagus and YUM!

I have made this for company too many times to count. It is fail proof and delicious for such an easy recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and started adding a little fresh ginger and omitting the garlic powder- use an extra clove of garlic instead. .

This was super and my family of 5 all enjoyed it. I used  5 oz pieces of fish per person which was perfect. It's not easy to find something my teenagers all like. But I took the fish out of the bag of sauce after 30 minutes and placed it in the pan, skin side down. I then put the sauce in a small pan and added some corn starch. It boiled for a while. I drizzled it over the fish. This is absolutely what made the difference for the kids and why they liked it so much. I will make this again.
I made it again  Jan 2019 and my boys and fiance liked it even more.  We doubled the recipe with a 2.5 pound salmon.  I had tons of sauce to boil with corn starch. But the sauce, again, made the difference to the kids.

Very good. I cut down the cooking time to 15 min. and I would suggest letting it marinate 60 minutes.

Just made this tonight.  Very easy and very good! Minor change just in the handling.  I marinated in a plastic storage bag, then cooked wrapped in foil on a cookie sheet.

This was a delicious dish!  Its hard to believe that one pound will serve four, I bought a pound of fresh salmon for the two of us and we ate every bit.  I followed the prep exactly but did add a small amount of horseradish (about a large teaspoon) and I baked it as directed.  Served it on a small amount of wild rice blend and a cold crispy salad.....divine!

One of the easiest, fastest Salmon recipe I know of that still deliver a flavorful fish. When I am in a rush, I just use garlic powder for the fresh garlic.

Seriously easy. Seriously the best salmon I have ever made. I cooked on 375 for 20 minutes using a convection oven and broiled on 400 for an extra 5 minutes which made the glaze thicker and a slight crust on top.

One of the suggestions was to add ginger. That suggestion was a delicious addition. I added a little sesame oil also, just so that there would be some oil to brown the salmon.  So tasty.

Also, I have to disagree with starflowers last comment in your recipie, there is no such thing as "over marinating". Even in fish, I marinated the fish for 50 minutes and it was still superb!

Doubled the recipe due to the amount of salmon  we cooked.  A serious must  DO NOT OVER COOK YOUR SALMON.   We cooked it till it was medium rare then took the salmon off the BBQ and let it rest for a few minutes - PERFECT every time!
Great recipe

The marinade is wonderful! Thanks to the other reviewers for their ideas, which I promptly stole. :) Doubled the marinade ingredients and used low sodium soy. Marinated the salmon filets and then cooked them wrapped in foil (still in the marinade). Halfway through, I moved the marinade to a sauce pan, thickened with cornstarch, and served atop the filets. My teenager cleaned his plate and I wanted to lick the serving spoon. The marinade/sauce would be amazing on many things, not just salmon. Thanks to Starflower for the easy and delicious recipe!

My boyfriend and I cooked this for an anniversary dinner and we loved it. Really easy to make (he was a little intimidated at first). Only thing we did was make a little extra marinade to pour on the fish before served. We paired this with roasted red potatoes and garlic green beans.

Delicious! Because of the soy sauce, there's no need to add the extra salt called for. I used low sodium soy sauce and it didn't need any more salt.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! So quick, no fuss and so tasty! I followed the recipe exactly. I marinated 2 pieces of salmon flesh side down and started baking it flesh side down for 10 minutes and then flipped it over, skin side down to complete the cooking. 20 minutes ended up being perfect for the nice thick piece of salmon I purchased. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe!!

Really excellent.  I wasn't sure how the maple syrup and the soy would taste together, but they were delicious.  Also, I didn't have garlic salt, so I just used garlic powder, and it still tasted great.  And so easy!  This is going to become my go-to salmon recipe.

i have to say, this one is my most favorite salmon so far, it have a salty from the soysauce and sweetness from the maple syrup, it was a great combination.  my boyfriend is a ginger fan and sesame oil, therfore i added about 2 tb ot sesame oil, 1tbs of fresh ginger and one green onion. i marinated it in the fridge for just a little over an hour and pop it the oven for 25 to 30 min and remove cover and leave it there for 10 min. it tasted great

A good flavor and a quick weeknight dish. The maple wasn't as sweet or over powering as I was afraid it would be.

I thought that the maple taste totally overwhelmed the salmon. My husband liked it, but I won't make again.  Sorry.

We aren't big Salmon fans but I buy it because it is good for us and a nice change. I liked it and so did the hubby. I made the marinade, without the garlic salt, using granulated garlic. I placed it into a baking with the fish, marinated 30 minutes and put it right into oven for 20 minutes. I pulled skin off and served with quinoa, peas and green salad. It was good, maybe a little sweet, and I will reduce syrup a little next time or maybe use light syrup as suggested by another reviewer. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe

I actually listened to some reviewers and omitted the salt, but you actually need it.

Baked in covered foil packages. Still messy because all the sauce leaked out but its ok.

But tasty! I added red pepper flakes and a bit of lemon juice to the mixture.

Excellent!  I tweaked it a bit as I'm a health nut.  No aluminum - toxic.  Used a cookie sheet to marinade and bake in with a handful of snow peas in the sauce too.  Also added some ginger and instead of soya sauce I used Bragg's soy protein which tastes the same but without the sodium.  Did 2 cloves garlic instead of garlic salt and used maple syrup from a friend's sugar bush in Ontario which I know is pure - awesome dinner.  Thanks for posting.

Good, but sweet. A good recipe if you're trying to get a youngster more interested in salmon. Although it is sweet, it is a sophisticated sweetness.

This is the best salmon I've ever had. Only cook it for 15-17 minutes though since I prefer my fish more rare.

I just tried this for the first time tonight. My boyfriend was very skeptical at first but asked me to make it again soon, he loved it! I left out the minced garlic, only using the salt. The cooking time was perfect.

This dish is perfect because it is both easy and delicious and now it's the only way I fix salmon. The first time I made it I didn't have soy sauce, just teriyaki sauce. I decided to go ahead and it was just great so that's how I've continued to make it. It's good with any maple syrup, but the one time I made it with the really good (expensive!) stuff, it took it to a whole new level. I triple the recipe and use a 3 lb slab of salmon from our local warehouse store. That way there are leftovers and it reheats very nicely (I keep all of the sauce).

I am not a big fan of any fish. But, I like to incorporate it once or twice a week into our menu. This was actually quite good and I would recommend it. I did not make any changes to the recipe.

It was VERY easy... I took the advise of the tips on reviews and cooked it in foil to keep the flavor. Easy, taste great, very quick... if you could figure out a way for an easier clean up from a pan with Maple syrup cooked on it I would give you a 6 out of 5 ;-)

the sauce tasted too sweet so I mixed in chicken broth and a little more soy sauce. I also left out the salt since soy sauce is salty enough. tasted delicious

This recipe is excellent.  The marinade has great flavor, not oily, and does not overwhelm the flavor of the fish.  So quick and easy to make, everyone LOVED this recipe!

Awesome! Wish I used the foil trick though. The sauce candied and stuck to the pan. Hard to clean.

Either cook the salmon in a small dish that fits it well, or in aluminium foil. I cooked it on a pan and the maple burned everywhere except on the fish. Granted, it was some of the best salmon I have tasted regardless. Will be trying this recipe again. (I'd also add more maple)

I love this recipe! I altered it a bit and added dijon mustard and fresh ginger. I made it for company and they loved it as well. My hubby asked me to make it again next week. It's a definite keeper.

I just made this recipe for dinner and it was really delicious! Added a little extra kick to my standard salmon meal so I will definitely be making this again. However, next time I am probably going to make a little extra marinade on the side so that I can reduce it in a saucepan and use it as sauce.

Even my 6-year old eats this one!  Love the "sauce".  I usually scrape the pan and add a little hot water to allow for serving with the meat.

I don't usually love salmon, but couldn't get enough of it prepared this way. Used a dark Vermont maple syrup and left out the garlic salt. Marinated it for about an hour. It was perfect.

This was very good for a change but I found I prefer savory vs. sweet salmon. I served this with butternut squash risotto. Squah or pumpkin filled ravioli would be good too.

This recipe is great, easy, and a crowd pleaser. I would recommend adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the marinade. Also, there is more than just "flaking the fish" to check and see if it is fully cooked. Be sure to use a food thermometer in the thickest spot of the fish and assure that it cooks to 145 degrees. Don't need food poisoning!

Made this tonight for dinner. It was good but not outstanding. Followed the recipe and took some tips from other reviews by making a sauce with this reserve marinade and cornstarch. I also put a thin layer of brown sugar to broil, after baking the salmon. Would probably make again.

Amazing!  I'm pretty new to even eating fish & I've never made it at home before today.  Took couple of recommendations. 1. cut out garlic salt and did extra fresh garlic (there's plenty of salt in soy sauce) 2. Marinated then baked in foil to lock in flavors 3. Opened foil the last 5 min & broiled to get crispy.  Will totally make again!

So delicious and so easy! I cook salmon frequently in a foil pocket, but did everything else the same. Drizzled the extra marinade from the packet over the salmon and jasmine rice. Amazing! Will be my go-to salmon recipe!!

Don't add too much garlic it can be a bit pungent and over-power the flavor of the fish. I bit too sweet for my taste. If I try this recipe again I will try adding something to cut the sweetness just a little bit. I would like to try this marinade with another type of fish too.

Easy and tasty recipe, but I find the sauce overpowering the natural flavor of the salmon.  I would give the recipe a 4 or 5 star on a chicken dish, but not salmon.

We live in Oregon and often a neighbor will bring us fresh-caught salmon.  THIS is the recipe I use.  It's amazing.  It lets the natural flavor of the salmon shine through, but adds delicious flavor.  I've made it many times, exactly as written.

DELICIOUS! I shared this with my mom and a good friend the day after my boyfriend and I ate it for dinner. Super easy to prepare and very tasty! Be sure to remove skin before marinating.

I was really looking forward to trying this dish, it sounded so good. Perhaps I did something horribly wrong, because it was a huge disappointment.  I followed the directions exactly, but  the marinade/ sauce apparently slid off the fish.  This resulted in a burning bubbling mess in the dish, so the salmon had no flavoring, and was kind of dry. Maybe I'll try it again with some major changes...

This is my favorite way to eat salmon! The recipe is so simple and yet so delicious. The better quality maple syrup, the better the dish. Just make sure not to overcook the salmon.

Saw this on the "daily" recipes and thought it sounded interesting.  I had just defrosted a large salmon filet and hadn't decided what to do with it yet. We are presently vacationing in a rather remote location and this recipe with its 5 basic marinade ingredients fit the bill nicely. Prepared according to directions & added a sprinkle of red pepper on top of the salmon just before I cooked it in the convection toaster oven. It turned out great! I lined the pan with foil & non-stick spray before inserting salmon pieces & marinade. Went from frige, to oven & cooked uncovered at 400 for about 30-40 min. Salmon was moist with slightly crusty top & the marinade had thickened by itself to a nice sauce. Because of cooking spray, nothing stuck to the foil. Hubby loved it too. Afterwards, he just rolled up the foil & clean-up was done! Thanks for the recipe; this is a keeper.

I thought this was ok.  Nothing that really blew me away....but maybe it was just the Salmon I purchased.  I may try again with another piece of Salmon as it looks like it should be awesome!

My family absolutely loves this dish...its perfect just the way it is we haven't added to it or taken away from it last night we made it and since my mother doesn't care for salmon we made extra glaze and bought some large shrimp pulled off the tails and glazed them generously in a glass casserole dish and baked them until pink and juicy...she loved them....thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us...

I made this tonight and my family had seconds and thirds!  I doubled the sauce per another reviewer. My husband does not like any fish that tastes "fishy" so I'm always looking for good fish recipes that I think he'll like, especially salmon. Thank you so much for posting this ..I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this dish several times now and my husband loves it! I myself was not a salmon fan until I tried this recipe and now I'm hooked! I also marinated the salmon in foil which really brought the flavor out.

I made this for one. My salmon weighed 4 ounces so I cut ingredients in half. Best salmon I've ever had since I am not a fan of dill sauce.

Everyone in the family LOVES this recipe. I cut the maple syrup in half and add a bunch (maybe 1 1/2 tbsp) of grated ginger for some zing.  A rare find that the 5 year old, the 8 year old and parents all love it (emphasize to the kids the maple syrup to get them on board).

So easy to make, but so reliably good. Have made it a few times and it was delicious every time.

Awesome recipe! If your not a Salmon fan this will surely change your mind, add a bit of pepper and you'll fall in love!

This is far and away the best recipe for fish that I have ever had. I am not a lover of maple syrup, but now I don't make fish any other way. I also used a small amount ginger and this was outstanding.

Great recipe! This is perfect and it is guaranteed to impress any guest. My boyfriend can't stop bugging me to make this. It's his favourite dish of all timeâ¦This includes the cooking of all the women in his family, hehehe. Keep an eye on the salmon and make sure its not overdone. Salmon comes in different sizes so mine was perfect in less than 20 minutes. Another piece might take 25.

This was so delicious and easy! I omitted the garlic salt because I didn't have any (plus I think it would have been to salty!). I did cook it in tin foil as others suggested, and would like to try the fresh ginger on top next time as well. My husband stated the meal was gourmet! I served it with spinach and couscous- Delish!

I only review recipes that are 5 star or 2 or less! This baby is 5! Simple, tasty, perfect. followed to the letter, can't improve this one. Salmon is easy to under-overcook, 20 min @ 400, spot on.

I make this a lot. It's great ;)  Everyone should try it and if you want to do it a little healthier get the Alaskan salmon instead of farm raised.

Used this recipe for a cooking contest.  And I won.  I added a little honey to the mix.  I used tamari sauce instead of soy sauce.  Took the salmon out of the oven and placed it on a bed of spinach.  Very good recipe and I will continue to use this for guests that love and hate fish.  I had people that judged the contest that said the hate salmon but they actually enjoyed this dish.

This was absolutely terrific!! I followed the other reviewers' suggestions, and omitted the garlic salt, added more garlic cloves, and added some grated ginger. I doubled the marinade to have extra, so I used 4 ish garlic cloves, and 1 Tablespoon grated ginger. I also used low-sodium soy sauce. I covered with foil and baked. It turned out SO good!! I can't wait to share this recipe with my family and friends.

I HATED fish with a passion - my girlfriend didn't know this and she made this recipe for our valentines day dinner one year. I remember saying to myself, no matter how much you dislike fish just eat it - sure enough, it was AMAZING. This recipe has become a staple in our house. 

MODIFY - add a little orange juice to the marinade 1/4 cup or so.

The marinade was delicious. Not too overpowering. I just placed the salmon and marinade in a zip lock bag and placed in the fridge for 30 minutes. When ready, I placed te salmon in a tin foil pack and barbecued for about 15 minutes - turning once half-way through. Delicious!!

This was an average salmon recipe--I didn't love it and I didn't dislike it. I've tried a lot of different salmon recipes over the years. I love the taste of maple syrup with salmon, however, I don't think that it paired well with some of the other marinade ingredients.

At the last minute, I discovered I only had teriyaki sauce (sweeter) not reg. soy, so it's probably my own fault that this was a bit sweeter than expected.  No add'l. changes other than switch plain garlic powder for the garlic salt.  Easy and YUMMMMM!!

We followed this recipe as given. I would omit the garlic salt. Overall, we thought it was very good. We did not find it too sweet at all, since the glaze doesn't really "soak" in the fish. Will make again, Thanks!

fantastic! my adult son and 2 teenage daughters love salmon, so I tried this.  So easy - everyone has soy sauce, maple syrup and garlic in their kitchen.  I covered the salmon in foil in the oven for the first 20 minutes, then uncovered the salmon and put it under the broiler for the last 15 minutes.  Crispy, tasty, tender - - I can't write enough positive adjectives!  This is a hit and this is fast - in 1 hour everyone is eating dinner!

Maple syrup is a product of Maine where I live so how could I not try this.  I downloaded it this morning and made it for lunch.  It was wicked awsome.  In Maine that means it was great.

Wonderful recipe.  I've made it several times.  It's easy to prepare and always comes out absolutely delicious.  It's better than what you would get in most restaurants.  

A couple notes: 1) Be sure you are using a glass dish.  If you don't have one on hand, you can use a metal baking pan, but know that the maple sauce will start to burn on the pan so you need to keep an eye on it closely and be prepared to scrape your metal pan clean.  The fish will still be delicious, though.  2) This recipe sometimes takes longer than 20 minutes to cook fully.  Even if the fish is flaking, check the center to make sure it no longer has a somewhat jelly appearance.

Really great recipe.

Followed the recipe as written even though I had my doubts when I made this the first time last week. I wasn't sure about the combination of maple syrup and soy sauce.  I was very happy with the outcome; this salmon is not only very good, it is so easy & quick to make. I marinated the salmon in a glass pie plate and then just put the plate with the fish and marinade in the oven making for a easy clean up also.  Even my mom who always claims she does not like salmon had two helpings and finished the leftovers the next day! It was perfect for both of us. This recipe will deffinately be a regular for us, especailly on Friday's during Lent

Wonderful way to cook salmon. I cut down on the garlic, otherwise followed recipe exactly. We loved it! Next time, per some of the other reviews, I'll try broiling the salmon for the last few minutes to caramelize the sugars and thickening the drippings left in the dish and pouring it over the fillets.
Served with swedishmilk's "Oven-Roasted Asparagus" and the sweet  and savory flavors complimented one another very well!

Turned out wonderful! I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and I had some and I DO NOT like salmon and it was REALLY GOOD! Lots of flavor and no fishy taste. Will definitely make this again.

This is simple and fantastic ! My husband flipped for it, he said it was better then going to a restaurant, and so easy for me to make, I did not change a thing in this recipe, and yes it is as easy as marinading it and popping in oven, a salad on the side, rice or potato, you choose !

Starflower, just to let you know I added this to my recipe file back in April 2010 and since then to date, I've made it many times.  My family loved it just the way you wrote it so I don't bother to change it when it works!  I marinated it for 15 minutes on both sides and baked it til it flaked easily with a fork.  That depends on the thickness of the salmon, too.  I try to select the salmon in pieces that are all relatively close in size. No guesswork for me and no worries about one thinner piece being more done than the rest.  Again, we loved it.  I apologize for not having written a review until now. Great flavor. Thank you for sharing an out of the ordinary delicious fish recipe!

My  husband and I both loved this recipe. I did make a couple of changes: deleted the garlic salt and added about a tsp. of fresh minced ginger. Very nice served with rice. It's also really good reheated.

I was so skeptical...but was I ever surprised! My husband loved it as well and I shall say he was just as skeptical as me.  Followed the recipe exactly-doubling the sauce. I did marinate for several hours only because my husband brought home dinner the night I intended to prepare this dish. I will marinate each time I prepare this recipe. I sprayed my glass dish with Pam and the clean-up was easy.

Incredible flavor; next time I will probably take the suggestion of other reviewers and cook in foil for the first 15 mins, then broil on high for the last five.  Otherwise, perfect.

A classic meal in our house.  I marinade the sauce the night before and instead of marinating the fish for 30 minutes, I cook it right away.  Marinading the sauce overnight really gives it rich, fragrant flavor! Love this recipe!

This has a really nice flavor and worked well as the recipe is written. I also made it with the addition of a bit of champagne vinegar and Dijon mustard in the mix and a few shots of chipotle tabasco and bitters. Next time I make this I plan on going back to the original recipe and only adding some thinly sliced jalepeno peppers. My family really enjoyed this prepared both ways.

Even while it was cooking I knew it was going to be good. My husband, who normally doesn't care for fish, thought this was the best thing since man landed on the moon. I needed to cook the salmon a little longer than specified, but that's why it gets checked. Well done, will be making again!

This is a fantastic marinade!  The maple syrup caramelizes as it cooks.  My husband kept commenting on how good it is and he usually doesn't like any marinade that is sweet.  I did use fresh garlic, added 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger, and skipped any salt since the soy sauce has plenty. The leftovers reheated nicely the next night, too.  I'll be using this marinade regularly and think it will be delicious with chicken, too.

I give this recipe 4 stars!  It's very easy to put the marinade together and turns out very well when cooked on the barbecue.  I would have given it five stars except that only my 8 year old son and I really enjoy it, my husband likes it but prefers less sweet sauces and my 5 year old daughter doesn't care for it at all...though she hasn't been liking much of anything these days.

The marinade is so delicious! I didn't cook it according to the directions from the recipe though. Instead, I used the directions from allrecipes.com's video of "How to cook salmon" because it's a no fail way to make sure your salmon comes out "restaurant style" moist! I wouldn't cook it any other way!

Absolutely amazing! Will definitely be a staple in our home! I have to add that there is a trick to this recipe with respect to the marinade.  If you found it too bland, it is important to keep "basting" the marinade over the salmon. So, 1) during the half way point while still in the fridge 2) prior to baking 3) shortly before being done and 4) when served. I added an extra 5 mins to baking time, but people forget that location (aka altitude) may vary cooking time.

Super easy! have made this 3 times now. It's a keeper; used minced garlic on thrid time around. The liquid burned a bit the first time; turns out I didn't have it in a glas dish as the recipe states. Fab recipe!  I'm a novice and this doesn't get any easier and taste GREAT! Thanks!

OMG!! This was amazing! My husband will eat anything I put in front of him but he rarely ever says that I should make this for our neighbors but keep the glaze a secret! He loved it and so did I. Being a young house wife I've started cooking something new everynight and this recipe is certainly going into my binder!

This is the BEST way to prepare salmon I have found. I am really sensitive to that "fishy taste" undertone that salmon sometimes has and there was no trace of it with this recipe. I added a tablespoon of fresh ginger as someone else suggested and it came out delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe - I make it at least once a month. It works best with fresh fish, but I've tried it with frozen and it was still tasty. Highly recommend!

I thought this tasted good. I picked it, because it didn't require a grill. The only negative is I felt it really begged for some kind of a sauce. I also found that baking in the oven, created a slightly dry salmon that I am not used to. It was a tad too sweet for my taste, also, but it worked great for a quick meal tonight. ty

This is my go to Salmon recipe. It couldn't be easier. I omit the garlic salt because I add a tablespoon of minced garlic and the low sodium soy sauce I use is salty enough. I also baste the salmon with the juices a couple of times while cooking. It gives it great color and keeps the flavor in.

Made this tonight but 30 minutes was not enough time to marinate for me because the seasoning did not set in enough. I will try it again but might add more seasoming or may wrap in plastic while it marinates so maybe the flavor will set more, if that makes since. Oh I also used foil since glass dish is broken.

Delicious! I made it last night and it was perfect.  Mostly I followed the original recipe and the only change I made was omitting the garlic and substituting garlic salt with sea salt. I tend to omit garlic with salmon as garlic over powers the taste in any salmon dish. i got a perfect crust on salmon. I'm going to make this again :)

I reviewed this recipe in 2012 and it is still my favorite salmon recipe!!  Actually, I buy my salmon at Costco because it is very fresh and I never have to worry about it being bad.  I use the aluminum pan that the salmon comes in. I take the dill off of the Costco salmon.  I go by the recipe except I add fresh ginger or ginger in a tube and I now cook in the oven for 20 minutes and then take it to the grill for another five minutes- just long enough to make it crispy. I really want to thank Starflower for this recipe -outstanding! I have used it for several years and it is absolutely the very best!! It is my go to recipe when we have dinner guest - always compliments.

While this wasn't a horrible recipe, it was also not an extremely flavorful recipe. Both my daughter & I noted that the "maple" flavor was nowhere to be found--we were really looking forward to it too! While I can't tell you to not make this, I will tell you that I'm not going to need to make it again.

Just got done eating this and it was delicious. I grilled the salmon fillets on the BBQ, I just hit the grill with a little vegetable oil (not olive oil, it burns too easily) right before grilling so the salmon wouldn't stick. I placed the fillets skin side up on a medium high heat to impart some sexy grill lines. After about two minutes I flipped them over and fineshed them off. Nice...

I left off the garlic salt and added another clove of garlic. Thought the soy sauce had enough salt. Easy and company loved it, even 2 non fish eaters.

What a good idea for a really tender salmon steak! I used only 1/8 cup maple syrup, since I don't like meat or fish to be too sweet. I was all out of soy sauce, so I used gyoza sauce instead. I used more pepper than was called for and used regular garlic instead of garlic salt, since the gyoza sauce was salty enough. I served it with a slightly spicy, curry-like soup to help tone down the sweetness a bit. It was excellent!

I didn't add the clove garlic but instead added Webster Garlic & Herb spice which tasted amazing. I also put it on mixed spring lettuce with sweet peas. My fiance devoured it.

This is a great recipe! I decreased the maple syrup and added/rubbed the following spices after marinating: 1  teaspoon  paprika, 1/2  teaspoon  chili powder, 1/4  teaspoon  ground cumin. Grilled in a grill pan. Excellent.

I'm pretty sure I didn't use nearly as much garlic as the recipe calls for, but then I'm not a fan of the flavor of garlic.  Excellent flavor to the dish, though!  Sweet and savory of maple and soy blend surprisingly well.  I might be tempted to try this with honey instead of maple, too, just to mix it up.  Big thank you to STARFLOWER who posted it initially!

This for me was an outstanding flavor.  I tried to figure up the nutritional amounts and here's what I got - keep in mind I'm not a nutritionist and I'm just going on values from the back of the package and such.  I'm assuming the recipe serves 4.

Each 4 oz filet (quarter lb):

Sodium        154mg
Carbohydrates 13.3g
 Sugars       13.3g

Good, but very sweet (as one might expect from a maple recipe).  I baked in foil, then broiled, as suggested in the other comments.

It was wonderful!  Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like things that taste sweet, loved it!  I think it was the just the right balance between sweet and salty.

This was delicious!  One of the best (if not THE best) recipes for salmon I've ever had.  I substituted sugar-free syrup for half of the maple syrup, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was simple, quick, and delicious!  It was so good even with the sugar-free substitution that I may try totally sugar-free next time.

Amazing recipe!! The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly (minus the garlic salt, and I used reduced sodium soy). The second time I took some suggestions from other reviewers. I added about a tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger, 1/4 cup chopped white onion, and a tsp of cayenne pepper. Next time I will maybe add a little more ginger and cayenne for a little kick! Thanks for a great recipe, this will be a staple in my house...

Excellent.  I can eat salmon every day if it was cooked this way.  I normally don't like salmon, too fishy and over powering.  The maple syrup does an amazing thing to this dish.  Love it!  I make without garlic salt b/c I don't have any. Used extra garlic clove and regular salt instead.

My boyfriend liked it, but it was sweet for my taste. Then again, it is maple salmon. It also seemed a little dry to me, and that could be our oven. The boy thought it was just right. I'd give it a 3, and I think he'd give it a 5, so I'm making it a 4.

This was fantastic. I was a little worried about maple + fish, but went ahead and prepared it exactly as published ( ok, minus garlic salt). The flavor was awesome, "sweet" said one of my kids, but you didn't get "maple" too much, I think the soy offset it. Anyway, this will be a staple on our house. Thank you for a great, simple dish.

Excellent, I added green onions to the marinade. I miss read the ingredients so it was accidental. But it turned out to be a great mistake. My husband doesn't like fish much, he LOVED this. I figured he would because of the sweet flavor.  But I was surprised that I did. I usually don't care for sweet flavoring, but this was awesome!!

Ohhh my gosh, so good. I have made this for a few people and they all loved it! It's so easy but tastes gourmet. :D I make it exactly as-is, except instead of garlic salt I use garlic powder to cut the sodium. I also make a little extra marinade to put on TOP about 5 minutes or so before fully cooked... also to flavour rice if that's our side dish. :) Another option is to add a bit of cornstarch to the extra marinade, heat a little to thicken, let cool and drizzle on top of the cooked salmon - I think that would make it particularly kid/picky eater friendly! ;)

Loved this recipe. The Maple syrup and salmon go great together and the soy mellows out the sweetness.

I would give 10 stars if possible. I used fresh garlic which I think was not a good idea. Next time I will use garlic powder.

quite delicious, but I would reduce the soy sauce by a bit. Also added some almond slices for texture.

This recipe is so easy and so good.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and very little garlic salt.  The next time, I might try honey in place of maple syrup.

I used this recipe to make salmon for the first time and it turned out amazing! I opted not to use the clove of garlic (because I didn't have any) but used just a second shake of the garlic salt instead. Messy, but delicious. :D

Lovedit. Marinated for 1/2 hour, doubled the marinade ingredients, and it turned out wonderfully. My husband said it had great flavor! Will definitely make again.

Super tasty!  I actually cooked this on the grill, wrapped in heavy duty tin foil, cooking in the pool of marinade.  The flavor is fantastic!

Always afraid to cook fish, but not anymore!  Super yummy & easy.  Followed exactly. At the end made a sauce with the leftover marinade and cooked with the maple carrots that others suggested.

So far the best recipe for Salmon. I'm not fond of Salmon but try and eat it weekly for the health benefits. This makes it a very good main course and one I will use for a long time! Very tasty!

This was my first time making salmon.. I'm pregnant and don't usually eat it, but I know that it is the healthiest fish for me right now. I followed EXACTLY as shown (a little nervous about making it too dry, nothing worse than dry salmon) and came out perfect! I wouldn't change anything about this.. It's easy, fast and convenient. I did appreciate the reviews about the 30 min marinate rule.. major help.. Thanks for sharing this recipe

I changed it up just a tad & used 2 garlic cloves & had to add just a pinch of salt as it was a little sweet for my taste.  I also added just a pinch of dried red pepper flakes for some kick.  I could literally drink this marinade.  :)  I'm going to let the salmon bathe for about an hour & then wrap it up in foil & throw it on the grill.  Can't wait!

I haven't made this dish yet, but I am already convinced it will be awesome, since I could not find any recommended changes by the huge amount of respondents.  Usually, no matter how great the recipe, people want to change it.  Good job Star Flower on making all of the people happy, almost all of the time.

So simple & delicious!  Love this recipe!  Made twice and both times turned out perfect!  Used wild salmon once and it was almost as good as the farmed!  Thanks for a great recipe!  This one is a hit!

I followed the recipe with one minor change. Instead of baking I broiled the salmon for 10 minutes. It turned out perfect, and tasted exactly like a salmon dish from one of our favorite restaurant. Very pleased.

Husband's first comment was "this has a smell I can't place."  But he ate it; he'll eat just about anything fish.  I liked it; I thought the maple flavor was just right, and it certainly couldn't have been easier.  I let the salmon marinate closer to 1-1/2 hours, mostly skin side up.  20 minutes at 400* was right on target.  Thanks for a keeper!

Awesome recipe!! Simple and delicious.  I followed some suggestions and omitted the garlic salt (it was perfectly salted with just the soy).  I also added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger.  Instead of baking, I put the salmon on foil and put it on the grill.  This is the first time I felt excited enough about a recipe to submit a review.  Fabulous!

Absolutely delicious.  I made a few changes.  After marinating in fridge for 30 minutes, I baked for 15 minutes than took it out of the oven and sprinkled some garlic poweder, onion powder, paprika, sazon, salt, black pepper, and put a little bit of butter on it and then placed it back in the oven on broil for the last 5 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  It was finger licking good.  My husband loved it!

I read all the reviews and followed the directions exactly. Yet I thought this was absolutely tasteless. I used foil as another reviewer suggested both to keep the fish moist and to keep my sauce in tact. But the sauce ended up just running off and even after marinating it just didnât have enough flavor. Now I must admit that I prefer salmon with a sauce so perhaps the others like it more plain.

This is an excellent recipe with great flavor. I like to serve it with white rice and steamed snow peas. My 5, 3 and 2 year old always ask for seconds and sometimes thirds when I make this! Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe last night. We really enjoyed it!
I used more fresh garlic than it calls for and substituted regular salt for garlic salt. Marinated and baked it wrapped in foil, opened and broiled for the last 5 minutes as other reviewers have suggested. It was really yummy!!! My Husband thought it was a bit too sweet thus the 4 star review. Next time I will add some red pepper flake and ginger to balance the sweetness a bit. 
Great Recipe!! thanks!

I threw my own version of some splash cookin to get those hot and sweet flavors, I love, by adding a half cup local brew beer( Northwest thing ), a dash of spicy mustard, four shakes of your favorite hot sauce, and along with the staples of the delicious recipe of Maple Syrup and Soy, and of course garlic, I added fresh local honey, and in exchange for salt and pepper used Uncle Lou's Hot and Spicy, and Herb and Garlic for seasoning. I baked low for 15 minutes(used fresh salmon from Costco), then brolied for 15 at 500, marinating every five minutes. It came out moist in the middle and so yummily coated on top. I used a glass cooker with foil for the low part, and took off foil for the briol. Had no idea what I was doing, except I had salmon, syrup, garlic, and soy sauce. LOL

This is one of my (and my husband's) favorite recipes.  I usually triple or quadruple the sauce amounts though because we love it over rice.  Sooooo delicious and easy!

The sweetness of the maple requiers more seasoning in my opinion, ginger, wasabi and sesame oil would be a good addition, I also don't like salmon when it flakes, it is overcooked by then for my taste and dry. I prefer it when it's nicely browned on top but very pink inside and doesn't flake, it is more creamy and tastes better in my opinion, I would broil it few minutes on each side but not close to the broler, not to burn the fish, just brown it well.

Honestly, this is awesome.  Very easy and has a great flavor.  I didn't use the garlic salt (I don't think it would be very good with this--too salty) as the soy sauce adds plenty of salt but I do add an extra clove of garlic.  I have marinated it before for a couple hours and it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a dinner party & it was a hit! Everyone, including my boyfriend who doesn't like fish, ate his whole piece of salmon! It turned out absolutely wonderful!  I bought a little more than a pound of salmon & had more than enough sauce to marinate evenly. Placed in fridge for about 20 minutes. Then baked in oven wrapped in foil, uncovered for the last 5 min.  Served with rice & steamed veggies...AMAZING!! Best dish I've made yet! 5+stars

OMG that was unreal, perfect feast for Good Friday - so moist. As others mentioned, added some fresh ginger to the marinade, baked it in foil parcels, then finished it off under the griller (broiler). We had steamed mixed greens & brown rice salad with orange vinaigrette as well.  Definately a keeper! :)

I have made this for my family several times now and it is a favorite.  I don't usually care for salmon, but love it this way.  I double or triple the marinade and cook down while the fish is baking to serve on the side.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this is how I went about it: I marinated the fish in a baking pan in the syrup/soy mixture. Then I put that pan in the oven. About 10 mins into the baking time, the marinade around the fish was bubbling and burning. The fish itself tasted okay (nothing great), but the pan was a mess. I don't think I'd make this again based on the cleanup alone.

This is a wonderful salmon recipe. It has excellent flavor and my family with three young kids loved it. I also added a little bit of fresh grated ginger and it was wonderful. I'll be making it for supper again tonight-can't wait!

Delicious! Was a little wary of how sweet it would be, and I will try just glazing the fish versus using the marinade.

This marinade was entirely too salty. Perhaps I would have fared better using regular maple syrup as opposed to lite? Or low sodium soy sauce? This was such a disappointment, I had looked forward to this recipe for weeks.

Great recipe. I used pure maple syrup. I loved the flavor of this dish. After a lot of criticism from my dad for making the salmon he finally tried it and apologized.

Saw this recipe today while doing a search for maple glazed salmon.  I wanted to create something similar to what they served to us at work a while back.  We've got a really yummy cafe on site, so I was hoping I could either reproduce their effort or replace it with my own.

Suffice it to say, I'll never be able to eat the maple glazed salmon at work without wishing I was home eating my own.  This recipe was AWESOME.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Om nom nom nom nom!!!!

I guess I had high expectations with this recipe because I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be.  To get the full sweet taste, I kept having to scoop a lot of glaze with every bite of salmon.  Probably because I should have marinated the salmon for the instructed time of 30 minutes. (I took it to bake after 20 minutes. Couldn't wait!)  Another change I would make the next time I cook this is adding cornstarch to thicken the glaze, as recommended by DESIDERATAGRACEFULLY, and adding ginger. And like most reviewers stated, wrap in foil and open up at last 5 minutes.  Hope it'll taste better next time.  Overall, great taste! 4 stars.

Very Delicious.  We covered it for the first 20 minutes, then uncovered the last few minutes.  We used the idea of including it all in aluminum foil and wrapping tightly.  Perfection.  Served over Basmati Rice.

Nice dish. I have used this twice now, once exactly as instructed and the second time with some nice modifications. I used Teriyaki instead of soy, honey instead of maple and 1 large clove of garlic instead of garlic salt. Really nice with a ginger sesame rice pilaf, asparagus and a mandarin orange salad.

I too broiled for the last 5 minutes then added a bit of grated ginger and capers and closed the foil while preparing the plates. Once served, the additional flavors had soaked into the Salmon to make the dish absolutely delicious!

This was really great! It was easy to prepare and tasted great. Based on other reviews, I marinated this in foil and baked it in foil, opening the foil for the last 10-15 minutes of baking time. I agree with other reviewers who say to pay attention to the thickness of the salmon. My husband and son are not very familiar with salmon and they both ate it, which is high praise from picky eaters. I will make this again.

Even though I didn't get a full 30 min marinate time in it was still REALLY good.  I did add a few tsp of grated ginger and extra garlic.  Baked in foil and finished under the broiler.  My husband doesn't care for salmon but liked the Asian twist on this.  Next time will use a better grade of syrup, I'm sure it'll be even better!

This was great! I didn't change anything. I love the combination of the maple and soy together. Next time I might try the suggestion of another reviewer and try adding a little horseradish to it to give it a kick since my boyfriend prefers spicy over sweet.

Super easy and yummy with ingredients that I have on hand!  At first I thought this was too sweet but the spiciness really balances it out.  That sauce would be really good mixed with veggies and rice as well!

I wish I had gotten a better batch of salmon, because this recipe was divine (unfortunately my fish paled in comparison).  I followed this recipe exactly (except i added a bit of oil), and the flavor was perfect.  I reduced the sauce on the stove after baking with a bit of corn starch to create a maple drizzle, and served this over rice with fresh sauteed veggies on the side.  I can't wait to make this again with better fish!  BRAVO!

I made this recipe tonight for my husband and it was AMAZING! I was a little skeptical because it sounded really sweet but this was the perfect mixture of sweet and salty. The flavors really compliments the natural Salmon flavor well. I took the advice of others and cooked it in foil for about 20 minutes and then opened and discarded the foil and cooked it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to create a crispy skin. I served with grilled asparagus and rice. I will definitely make this again - thanks for a great recipe!!

OMG ~ I just made this Friday night for the first time and as I always do with a new recipe, I follow it to a "T" and this one came out TERRIFIC - with no modifications.  My 13 year old son and his two friends devoured it with no leftovers.  My 8 year old picky eater would not even look at it, but that does not surprise me since this recipe does not have Ramen Noodles in it, which apparently is now a staple ingredient in her vocabulary.  Will be making this one again for my family's Fish Fridays.    Thanks for the recipe!

Our family eats a lot of salmon since my brother and dad both have boats on Lake Michigan. My wife, daughter, and I all agreed that this was the best salmon we have had in our lives. I wrapped it in tin foil and opened the last fifteen minutes due to the massive size of the four pound fillet. Served with carrots made with maple syrup, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. They complimented each other perfectly, resulting in our daughter proclaiming it the best meal ever.

Very good recipe, it has a bit of sweetness to it, but not overbearing. My 3yr old loved it and he is a super picky eater! Will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I wrapped the salmon in tin foil to marinate then baked.  It came out so moist and flavorful.  Thanks.

I was disappointed in this.  I liked the sauce by itself but the flavor didn't transfer to the salmon.  So the flavor is good if it could only coat the salmon more and sink in it would be delicious.  Thanks anyway.

And I'm trying to see what else the recipe needs to help balance out the soy/syrup flavor. It's great, but it can always be greater. I tried 1/8 t of marjoram, and 1/8 of onion powder. It didn't really make a difference (although that's when I didn't marinate)

Tried it for the fourth time, but since I needed to make the salmon before it went bad and to make a movie in an hour, I didn't marinate it at all. In one bite it was blatantly obvious it wasn't the same recipe. Without the marinating process, it tastes dry like a turkey and other like other fish. Marinating simply ISN'T OPTIONAL.

I love the sweetness of the sauce. It probably only needs 18 minutes in the oven.   Love how easy to make and delicious it is!

This was quite tasty and a nice change from our usual salmon with lemon. Hubby, who is a real salmon lover, really enjoyed it. I liked it but was not completely blown away. I think perhaps I would have liked more sauce, so next time I will make extra. The only change we made to the recipe was to omit the garlic salt (used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning) and to use low sodium soy sauce as we do not cook with salt. We'll be adding this to our rotation! Thanks!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  We had fresh sockeye salmon from the dock.  I marinated this baby all day to ensure the flavor soaked through.  Kept turning the fish every hour.  I  then cooked it perfectly  ensuring it was not over cooked at all. Everybody ate everything and asked for the recipe.  I presonally added more garlic and a touch more Japanese Soya Sauce.  The real Canadian Maple syrup is the best.   Enjoy

Nice flavor!  I must admit that I picked up Apple Cranberry Juice by mistake at the grocery store.  My salmon was not very thick and was ready in 15 minutes so be careful and adjust the time by the thickness of your fish.

The maple syrup mixture didn't really add much if any flavor to the fish. It might've tasted better if I added more seasoning to it, but I  don't think I'll test that theory.

This might be my favorite salmon recipe ever.  (And we eat a LOT of salmon).  I followed the recipe exactly and I won't make any changes next time other than to cook up two filets instead of just one as everyone wanted seconds.  My five-year-old had three helpings.

Used this on fresh sockeye and it was delicious. The only thing I would have done differently is boiled down the sauce with some corn starch as someone else had mentioned.   I will probably try the marinade on other meats such as grouse.

wonderful recipe for salmon. I followed the recipe, & also added 1T of grated fresh ginger. Marinated for 30 min. The result was sweet, tender, flavorful, really delicious. As suggested by others I also thicken the marinade & spooned it over the fish,  perfect....and no leftovers! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Thi was very delicious and super easy to make.  Put a little more maple syrup if you want it sweeter.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I did broil it for few minutes at the end to crisp it up a bit.  Served with brown rice and baked carrots.

What a delicious way to prepare salmon! I have never had a sweet salmon before but this really won me over. I thought I had soy sauce in the pantry but I didnât so I did a little ad-libbing: used an asian-garlic seasoning and added a dash of white vinegar. Served with mushroom rice from AR, which tasted great with the maple sauce the fish was cooked in. Canât wait to make this again!

I am not a huge fan of salmon, but I made this last night for my son, who loves salmon.  It was delish!!  It was the perfect balance of sweet/savory.  I used frozen salmon fillets, as I wasn't sure about whether or not we would even like it, so I didn't want to go crazy on the fresh stuff.  Take the other reviewers suggestion and mince your galic REALLY well because baking time doesn't really allow it to soften much.  This was a super quick and easy dinner, and even I (not a salmon lover) would recommend it to everyone!  We are making it again tonight!

I actually got my husband to eat this which was surprising.  I love breakfast foods and the fact that I could use maple syrup with salmon was a huge bonus.  I'm giving it 4/5 stars because I made it with fake walmart syrup. You really need to use real maple syrup...

This was absolutely delicious. Sweet yet savory, after this meal you may never want to eat out again. I did things a little different. I used organic agave nectar because that is what I had on hand. I paired it with balsamic glazed  carrots, brown rice with grilled onions and a dash of brown sugar and dried cranberries. DELISH! It's oh so healthy and I've recommended it to all I know.

This was a great recipe!  I used about one teaspoon of low-sodium soya sauce and only had minced garlic from the jar, but hubby loved it as well.  Marinated in the fridge for about 10 mins while the oven heated up.  Thanks!!

Very good and so easy!  I made this exactly as written and it came out a little too sweet for my taste but my husband loved it. Next time I might use less maple syrup.

This was a great way to do salmon. My changes; omit garlic salt, use 2 cloves and about 1/2 tsp. sea salt. increase to 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper and a dash of red pepper. Baked it covered for 15 mins. uncovered and broiled for the last 4 or 5 mins. Added about 2 tbsp. of Amaretto Disaronno to small pan on med high heat for a couple of mins. and added the leftover marinade and reduced it for another 2 or 3 mins. Wow this was good.

This was fantastic. The only thing I changed was doubling it, adding equal parts ginger and garlic, and marinating it for 4 hours. Delicious recipe :)

Absolutely wonderful flavours. I did as some of the reviewers suggested, and baked it in foil, so as to keep all of the marinade for a sauce when serving. Will definitely make again!! Thanks for posting!

Absolutely love this one.  I've done this method and placed on a cedar plank and BBQ'd for about 10 minutes per side.  I've also cooked in a cast iron frying pan too and it's equally as good.  Serve it cold as an appetizer too.  It disappears quickly!

Very tasty for something so simple.  I followed the recipe but then when it came to putting the fish in the oven I enclosed it in foil for 15 mins, and then opened the foil for the last 5.  Next time I might substitute some of the syrup for wine

My husband and I are both not crazy about fish, especially NOT salmon.We only eat it b/c it's healthy...I've been looking for a recipe for a long time and finally FOUND A WINNER...!!! I grilled the salmon in my Foreman Grill, while heating up the marinade in a small saucepan... We were concerned about using sugar-free Maple Syrup, but the Salmon turned out PERFECT.  We will use this recipe on a regular basis! Thank you!

Perfect.  Simple and delicious.  After removing it from the oven, I reduced and thickened the extra sauce on the stove-top, adding some cornstarch & water.  By the way, this marinade is also perfect for pork-chops!

This is the most delicious thing I have ever made!    I used double the garlic, and marinated each side of the salmon in foil for 15 minutes.  I also set aside some marinade and put it on the salmon when it was done cooking.  Lastly, I sprinkled a little brown sugar on the top of the salmon 3 minutes before it was done cooking.  PERFECT!

Be sure to use foil packs!!! I didn't & nearly all the sauce cooked off before the fish was done. There was none left to pour over on the plates. Plus, the skin is all stuck to the bottom of my baking dish. That's great for serving, but stinks for cleaning!  Hubby loved this for Valentine's Day dinner and wants it to be our standard salmon recipe, but I'll definitely use foil packs in the future.

I didn't really care for this because the marinade is extremely strong and 30 minutes in it made the salmon only taste like teriyaki.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did different is left out the garlic salt.  I made homemade maple syrup (1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 Tbspn maple flavoring - cook over medium heat until sugar is dissolved).  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Excellent and easy!  The last time I made it I didn't even have time to marinate it at all so I just put it in a smaller pan than normal so more would be submersed while it cooked.  It came out delicious, as usual!

I cooked this for my wife and I and we both liked it. Followed the recipe except we used low sodium soy sauce.  I was a little confused from the reviews. I was not sure about whether or not I was supposed to remove the excess mixture from the salmon, but it turns out you don't.  You just throw it in the oven and that's it.  Super simple!

So delicious, quick and easy too!  I didn't have any garlic cloves on hand, so I only used granulated garlic, black pepper, soy sauce and maple syrup.  I saved the marinade and reduced in on the stop to use as a topping after the fish had broiled.  I served it with a tomato basil risotto.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

liked the marinade alot, but broiling after baking is a good idea to glaze the sauce.

Excellent flavor - My husband, who is a commercial fishman is pretty picky how fish is prepared, loved this recipe.  You have to use Wild Salmon.

This is the best fish recipe ever!! I use minced garlic in the jar instead of cloves and used sea salt instead of the garlic salt.  I also baked it skin side up in foil and then opened the foil the last 5 minutes under broil to brown it. WOW! I am not a fan of fish, but I know it is good for you so I have been trying new ways of making it.  This is by far the greatest! MMMmm, I think I found my winner. My boyfriend is a fish lover and he ranted and raved about it, we were fighting over the scraps left in the pan.

This was fabulous!  I will also wrap it with a partially cooked piece of bacon too that I top witha bit of the marinade.   Definitely one of our new favorites

Everyone in the family loves this recipe.  I used the marinade for other dishes, too.  I made a delicious chicken with it last week.  It makes a great stir fry sauce, too.  Freeze the sauce in ice cube trays, pop the cubes into a freezer bag, then use what you need as you need it.  Easy & delicious!

Very Good! Instead of getting another pot dirty - i just added about 1/2 tbsp. of corn starch to the marinade and let it cook with the salmon. It thickened up and was delicious. I cooked the salmon covered with tin foil and it came out very soft and moist.

Excellent! I wonder how much better the salmon would have been if I marinated it longer. I was afraid that this would have been too sweet but I found that I couldn't get enough of the sauce :)

Very very delicious. Easy and simple to make. The only thing I would change is to double marinated sauce so the salmon can be covered all the way.

This recipe was great. The flavor of the maple blended perfectly with the soy sauce and garlic taste. My family really enjoyed it. I will make it again soon.

Wow, this recipe is fabulous!  I love the combination of salmon with a sweet delectable sauce and this rates right up there.  In order to make this a wee bit healthier, I used garlic powder rather than the salt and I'm glad I did. There is enough sodium in the soy sauce without the addition of any more. I also feel real maple syrup is a must.  Thanks Starflower - a fantastic recipe.

Awesome recipes-didn't change a thing!!!And i normally don't even care for the taste of salmon, but i figured i would try one more recipe before I give it up entirely. Now when we eat salmon at home this is the ONLY recipe that's used. Great with fresh steamed vegetables and wild rice-Yum!!!

I've been making this recipe for years, and it always gets two thumbs up! I change up the recipe a little (minced onion instead of minced garlic, double the measurement; garlic powder instead of garlic salt, reduced to half the measurement), and grill instead of bake. I wrap the salmon in tin foil and place on the lowest rack of the barbeque for about 20 minutes. It always turns out perfect!

Fantastic recipe.  We'd gotten into a bit of a salmon rut, and I'd been looking for a new way to serve it for awhile.  This really fit the bill.  It was SO good.  Even my 2 year-old and 4 year-old gobbled it up!

I love maple syrup which is why I tried this recipe.  It was pretty good but still needed a little something to attain 5 star status.  I'm not quite sure what would perk it up but I'm going to read through the other reviews before I make it again.

WOW!!!  My husband is not a fan of salmon but I convinced him to try this for me.  He and our 9 year old son LOVED it!  I did add just a little bit of horseradish after reading some of the other comments and it was perfect!  It wasn't too sweet, it was just right!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's now one of our favorites!

This recipe got mixed reviews in my house.  My son and I (who both love grilled salmon) didnât care for the sweet taste.  I did like the texture though.  My daughter (who doesnât like salmon) loved it and wanted more.  My husband thought it was okay.

My husband found this to be very tasty. My daughter and I are not fish eaters and even took a few bites of this recipe.

WOW! This one's a keeper!  Doubled the recipe for a 3 lb fillet from Sam's Club and it was delicious.

This was very good.  I never made salmon in my life and it turned out great.  I didn't know the salmon fillets you purchased still had the skin on it.  It took me awhile to remove the skin because I didn't have a very sharp knife.  I ended up pulling the skin and scales off with ease.   One thing I would say about this recipe is that the cooking time seems very long.  I cooked it for 30 mins and it was just a tad dry- I think 25 mins would  have been better.  I guess it depends on your oven so keep checking so it doesn't dry out.  I served with brown rice and mixed veggies this was very very good and not fishy at all to my surprise!  After eating this salmon I thought wow.. why do people eat chicken when fish tastes this good!

This was a hit with my family, including my 22 month old son who of late won't eat anything just because I put it in front of him. Even days later, as I offered him chicken and other meals, he kept turning them down and saying "fish?"

You can't go wrong with this! I added scallions and made a touch extra on the side to brush on a few minutes before it was done. I grilled this on a soaked cedar plank so I marinated 30 minutes, set it on a grid over foil for about 15 minutes to let it "glaze", then put it on the plank and grilled. Oh, man, even our 18 year old picky eater commented again this morning how good it was! This is a keeper! It won't disappoint no matter how you cook it! I will be making this many times this summer! Thank you!!

I made this for the first time when we had company for dinner (daring, but I trusted all the reviews).  They each had THREE servings.  Needless to say, it was a hit.  Even my one year old loved it. This is our new "standard" Salmon recipe.  Thanks!

Not that this one needs another rave review, but my husband and I absolutely devoured this dish!  I did adjust the spices to our preferred flavors and added 3 cloves of garlic, some fresh ginger, and about 2 tsp. of basil.   The salmon came out so moist and made the house smell delicious.  Served wilted spinach and rice, this is sure to come in our regular rotation.

I made this according to the recipe plus a bit of grated ginger. Everyone seemed to like it from age 1 to 40! Asked my picky husband what he rates it out of five stars, and he said a firm four. So, there you go.

I have made this recipe twice, each time following exactly only without the garlic salt. It has been really great both times! We, at least, enjoyed the flavor of the maple and garlic blending together.

Sauce had a little too much maple sweetness to it (used the real thing); nevertheless, the recipe for the salmon is very moist and easy to follow; used 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger and didn't use garlic.  Thank you.

Great recipe. Very easy. Followed the recipe exactly and used salmon that was about 1 - 1 1/2" thick. I would suggest not using salmon that is thinner then that because the glaze is very sweet and would be overkill for a thinner piece of meat. Perfect for a thicker piece of salmon!

Best cooked salmon I ever tasted.  I always liked salmon just as sashimi or in sushi - never cooked.  This recipe changed my mind.  I'll make it again and again.

Excellent recipe. Salmon is not my favorite but this sauce made it non-fishy and sweet.  Delicious.  I made it as-is and it was perfect!  I did do it in a tin foil packet though and broiled it for a few minutes at the end.  THANKS!

I (we) made this for a cooking class I had at my house one evening.  EVERYONE, even those who said they didn't like salmon beforehand, LOVED this dish! (Even one very picky husband!)  To make this completely mess-free, we put all the marinade ingredients in a large zip-lock bag, zipped it up, smushed all the ingredients together to mix them, and then placed the salmon inside to marinate for 30 minutes.  We then made foil pockets, placed a filet in each one, dumped the marinade over the top, sealed them up, and baked as directed.  The only clean up we had were the plates we ate off!  Oh, one other thing, I had several people who couldn't have sugar, so we made some with sugar-free maple syrup and we couldn't tell the difference!  It was delicious both ways!
Enjoy!

This recipe was delicious! I substituted soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce, as it tends to have less sodium than even the low-sodium soy sauce. It was very simple also. A way to have the salmon marinade quicker is to put it into the freezer instead of the fridge. The salmon will absorb more of the flavor in the same amount of time. The salmon was also perfectly pink and tender, neither dried nor undercooked. My son even liked its sweet flavor!

Everyone loved this, even those who do not share my love of salmon.  I never delete ingredients from well-reviewed recipes, but I can't help it when other reviews add to the recipe with ingredients that I adore.  So, I doubled the sauce because I had 2 lbs of salmon- (could have easily handled 2 1/2 lbs) Added 2 T fresh minced ginger and 1/2 T horseradish.  Marinated 30 minutes skin side up.  Flipped it to bake.  Did not have any problem with sauce burning.  Spooned sauce over a few times while baking.  Garnished with chopped scallions.  Just wish I made more, so I could have some cold for lunch!  Fantastic- our new favorite for "oven" salmon.  Still love firecracker salmon, on this site, for grilling!

Absolutely good! I used base recipe. I added a pinch or 2 or salt, and salmon seasoning (can be food a most grocery stores). I wrapped in aluminum foil and refrigerated (as instructed)  for 15 mins (b/c of time restraints) and it still came out perfect.  I personally believe if you do the full 30 mins. then it may soak up ALL the juices...15 mins left only a little.  Great recipe nonetheless!

Oh yum.  This was THE BEST salmon I've had - and I can cook some good salmon.  LOVED it.  I think a really key part is to get good salmon. I've bought frozen salmon from the grocery store before and it was very fishy and nasty.  I bought the Costco frozen salmon and it is DELICIOUS! Just a perfect dinner and super easy.  My husband hates fish but actually liked this one.  Which is HUGE.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well this couldn't convert my boyfriend into a salmon lover, but we both LOVED the glaze.  It gave just a hint of maple flavor.  We added some extra garlic and also green onion for flavor and cooked in foil packets.  Next time I'll have this on salmon and he can have his on chicken!

This is a fantastic easy recipe.  The maple syrup compliments the fish well and becomes a nice glaze after baking.

I make salmon like this all the time, but I also like to add wasabi paste. Its gives the dish a little heat and really helps enhance the other flavors.

We love this recipe.  I have made following the directions and also have modified it several times by adding extra spices such as chopped onions, garlic & pepper seasoning instead of garlic salt and spiced it up with a six pepper blend seasoning.  Yesterday I marinated a Steelhead we'd recently caught and liked it even better than using Salmon.  Very easy and yummy recipe!!

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly and served with rice. 

Some commented that it was too sweet, I didnt get that at all. The soy sauce evens out the sweet perfectly. 

I will make this again.

We live in salmon country, and I've cooked it many ways . . .this is by far the one recipe my family requests over and over.  Regardless of what others have said, I think a longer marinade (more like an hour if the salmon is thicker) in the fridge enhances the garlic flavor in the recipe.  And as others have pointed out--every piece of salmon should be checked thoroughly--maybe less than 20 minutes, maybe more.  Thanks for the recipe--it's a keeper!

This is the recipe that converted me to salmon! I haven't eaten fish for about 10 years now, and after making this recipe a bunch of times, I now look for excuses to eat salmon at restaurants and at home! I want some right now just thinking about it...

I thought this tasted WAY too much like maple - I know it's in the name, but I thought with the soy sauce and garlic it would have more of an Asian flair. Definately won't be making again - sorry.

my family loves this recipe so much that they don't let me try anything else!  One thing that you've got to remember to do is keep basting it about 10 minutes into baking otherwise it will get to dry.  Great recipe...thank you for sharing it!!!

What an interesting and pleasing flavor. My whole family, including 4 children under 7, loved this. I thought soy sauce and maple syrup together would be gross, but was really good. I didn't have real maple syrup, so I used regular pancake syrup and it was still really good. I added just a touch of ginger but otherwise followed directions as given.

This was a delicious delicate mix of spices... it was delicious! However, my friend thought that is was quite sweet. But, I love sweet! With a delicate blend of spices, and not to mention the maple syrup.. this can complete any meal!

Tasty marinade!  I love that it only takes 30 minutes to marinate.  Perfect blend of sweet and salty.  I grilled the salmon and served it over spinach salad with strawberries.  Great meal for a warm summer night.

Yum! You just can't got wrong with this recipe precisely as is. I even did it on the grill with tin foil...and it was phenomenal! Every time I make it, it gets compliments. My favorite is when you use organic ingredients (but sometimes the organic maple syrup can get pricey, I've made it both ways) but really, it's just wonderful both ways. I serve it with simple side dishes to compliment the dish-either long grain & wild rice, or asparagus, or a spinach salad. You can't go wrong with this one! Thanks!

Good, but the sugar from the syrup made the sauce burn.  I should've kept a closer eye on this one as it cooked.  My fault I think. 

I may try it again one day.

Really great recipe!  I would recommend it for anyone who wants great flavor without a lot of work.  I would also agree with those who caution about the saltiness.  I cut back just a little on the soy sauce and garlic salt and it turned out great!

I am on a low-carb/low-sugar diet.  I used sugar-free syrup (Mrs. Butterworth's).  This was delicious, healthy, and extremely easy to make.  I marinated fish in TRIPLE the amount of marinade, in a ziplock (pressed all the air out), in the fridge.  I lined an 8x8 square baking pan with foil (for easy clean-up).  I poured the fish and ALL the marinade in the pan.  The fish cooked in the marinade, leaving lots to spoon on top of the fish when I served it.  It was AWESOME!  This will be a regular for me!  Thank you for this time-saving, delicious idea!!

As SANDRALYOUNGER recommended, I wrapped the fish in foil to cook. Also, like VailValleyCook did, I didn't add garlic salt and did add some ginger. It was delicious!

I made this for the second time last night and it was a HUGE hit!  I was told...this recipe is a keeper, I donât need some for lunch, Iâm eating it all now!  I marinated it longer than 30 minutes, overnight actually (I've done this before with seafood without any adverse reactions) turning it over in the morning before work.  I added crushed red peppers, cayenne pepper and Â¼ tsp of chili oil  for some heat.  The first time I made this, I added onion, shallots and green onions.  Yesterday, just before baking the salmon,  I sliced an onion,  making sure to let them sit in the marinade not just on the fish so they weren't dry; everything was so oooh oooh good.

this was really good, i used foil to wrap it up instead  to cook it in the oven. I  didn't had time to marinade it but it was still good and easy to do.

My husband loves salmon.  But unfortunetly didn't care for this dish.  I didn't either.  I couldn't get the idea of maple belonging on pancakes.  It was too sweet for me for salmon.

Exactly the right balance of flavors and aromas - yum!  Most of what you need for this recipe, you probably already have at home.  Just pick up some salmon fillets, and have this tasty dinner tonight!

I've been making this dish for a couple of years now. It's great just as it is but I add some freshly grated ginger to the marinade to kick it up a notch. Fabulous!

WOW! This was great! Maple flavor complimented the salmon so wonderfully! I doubled the recipe and served the extra mixture over brown rice.
Hubby loved it and you will too! You gotta try it!

I prepared this recipe for my family and we all enjoyed it. It was a tad on the sweet side, but it was definitely good nonetheless.  I'd make it again, for sure.  It's a nice change from my favorite salmon recipe from this site,  the Balsamic-Glazed Salmon.

This was excellent.  Even my kids ate all of it.  I also marinated it in foil.  I omitted the garlic salt and used real dark amber maple syrup.  I served it with roasted cauliflower.  My 2nd grade son actually asked for this the next day for his lunchbox!

This recipe is great. My husband (the cook) added a little brown sugar to the sauce. He baked the salmon for almost a half hour. It was delicious.

This was very quick and easy to prepare. It was delicious as prepared, however I think I will try to encrust the salmon with chopped pecans next time like a previous reviewer suggested.

This is a nice marinade.  I added a little more garlic and nixed the garlic salt. It was good on our sockeye salmon, eventhough we prefer a more traditional lemon-garlic accent.  This is an excellent marinade for baked tofu.  Thanks Starflower!

This is the 2nd time I've tried this recipe.  This time I tried grilling it and it came out FANTASTIC!  I don't like garlic salt so I used two garlic cloves pressed and 1/4 t. salt instead.  I poured the marinate and boiled it down with a little white whine for sauce.  Wow was it good.  If you can, try grilling it instead.

This is naturally a sweet recipe, and kids and husbands enjoy it. I would serve it with something simple and savory as it so sweet: an herb risotto, couscous with pine nuts, etc. I did not add garlic salt and I wouldn't recommend it. Soy sauce is extremely salty on its own, and the recipe already calls for fresh garlic. More salt plus fake garlic seems pointless. All said, this is fast,easy,and crowd-pleasing.

This recipe is pretty good.  I found out the hard way that you can't let the fish marinate in the dish that you're going to bake it in.  The excess glaze burnt to a crisp and I almost had a fire.  Then again, it wouldn't have been my first oven fire, so maybe that was common sense.  Tasty salmon resulted (slightly smoked!).

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Due to Lupus it has been recommended I eat more salmon. I am not a big fish person so i dont eat it often but this recipe was amazing and i will definately be eating more of it. I used sugar free maple syrup instead and it didnt lose any taste!

Really good recipe.  I only marinated it for 10 minutes because I was too hungry, and it was still good in the end.  Next time, though, I might marinate a bit more.

A delicious way to cook salmon. I didn't have any real maple syrup so I used regular pancake syrup. I also omited the salt and added extra garlic.

There is a salmon dish served at Cheesecake Factory that I cannot get away from ordering when we have the chance to go there and this recipe reminded me of one of the sauces they serve.  It was delicious and this is now one of our favorite dinners.  Even my son, who is sometimes a picky eater, loved it and asked for more.  Excellent recipe - glad I tried it!

This wonderful, quick, easy and healthy dish salmon I've ever had.  My wonderful husand-to-be decided to make this his first time cooking anything, ever.  The aroma when you first walk end let you know that something delicious waits for you.  I walked in the kitchen and saw and smelled the flavorable hints of garlic, maple, and other spices to make my stomach already anticipates how the perfect colored salmon would taste.  

But that's just the meat of the story.  He put it with mexican rice.  The mexican spices with the garlic and maple mixture completes the story.

I highly recommend this recipe.  I think it is great for beginners and I think it's great for a romantic evening. Excellent!

I liked this well enough. I used sugar free maple syrup and omitted the salt. I added 1/8 tsp of cayanne pepper too.

I gave this recipe five stars because this was the first time I had ever made fish and it was sooooo easy and good!  My boyfriend loved it even though after dinner he confessed he never even really like salmon before.  And it is one of the only recipes I have ever followed exactly and it turned out how I wanted. Very good stuff!

The boyfriend loved it, and it's not a bad recipe.. the soy sauce might have been too salty for me; also, the flavors didn't seem to permeate the fish, perhaps because syrup is too viscous? next time i will try the marinade with less soy and i might microwave it or something? hot water? something is missing...

Made this for a group of people (including a fisherman) and it was a huge hit. The fisherman admitted it was the best salmon he ever had. Served with vegetable fried rice.

I had never cooked fish before (or much of anything, really!) but this recipe was simple and infinitely delicious.  I did not have garlic on hand, but the pepper, maple syrup and soy sauce gave it plenty of flavor.  I am definitely going to make this again!

This was so good...my daughter and husband both really enjoyed it. I doubled the entire recipe and it still came out delicious. Steamed Asparagus was a major plus, and I omitted the garlic salt. I will definately make this one again.

I had surprise dinner guests and needed to whip up something good fast. I was nervous trying this because of the few ingredients and the soya sauce seemed strange. BUT THIS WAS THE BEST DISH I HAVE EVER MADE! It was a hit, and soooo delicious and sweet! I'm making it again tomorrow (and I didn't even like salmon!)

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. The maple/soy combination is flavorful but doesn't overpower the salmon. I made wild rice and steamed veggies for side dishes. It made a tasty
fall dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty. The first time I made this, I forgot to bake it and fried it in the marinate instead. The second time I baked as instructed. I actually like it fried better! The sugar in the syrup carmelized, adding an intriguing texture to the meat, as well as better preserving the flavor of the marinade. Baking is definitely a safer way to go though, and it came out perfectly moist and ready to serve!

This was by far the tastiest dish that I've made AND it was the first time I've cooked salmon.  I have recommended this to all of my girlfriends!  I served it alongside the Cheesy Polenta that I found on this website and it was wonderful.

I found this recipe while scrambling to come up with a marinate with random ingredients I had laying around.  Wow, and it sure paid off!  This is now one of our favorite all-time salmon dishes.  

I place the salmon flesh down for about 20-25 minutes in the fridge to make sure it soaked in good.  

Feel free to experiment with different types of syrup and seasoning...birch syrup works great too!

This recipe sold my family on Salmon. We have enjoyed it a lot. I ran out of Maple Syrup and used a couple tablespoons of brown sugar instead and it worked out really well too.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was to double all the ingredients for the sauce. I took this straight out of the fridge after half an hour and put the entire thing right in the oven...so easy! I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. I made this salmon several times in the last few months and my husband always requests it. Sometimes I use a sweet Asian glaze instead of maple sauce and it always turns out great. I make wild rice and broccoli as a side. I made this dish when having family and friends over for dinner and everyone loved it. I know I am not suppose to marinate the fish for long but I alway leave it in the sauce for few hours just to make sure the sweetness gets into the salmon. YUM

Our family of four likes salmon and we like sweet 'n salty flavor.  So when I came across this recipe, I thought I'd have a hit. I was wrong. The maple flavor (I used real maple syrup) didn't go well with this fish. I followed the directions as written. We all agreed that we have had better salmon. Sorry, I won't be making it again.

This has to be one of my favorite recipes ever! My whole family loves it, even my 3 and 6 year old. One time I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt by accident, but we thought it tasted even better that way. We use sugar free maple syrup to make it low-carb, and we use the individually wrapped salmon you can buy at GFS or Sam's Club and it is a wonderful quality. Makes for a perfect dinner. Thank you - we love this!!

We especially love this recipe cooked on the grill (on aluminum foil).  10 minutes top side down, then flip to skin side down, and brush with more marinade for 10 more minutes.  I also double the marinade, keeping half aside, so it can be used to flavor steamed carrots as a side dish.  Steam sliced carrots till tender, drain water, and saute carrots in leftover marinade. Oven roasted new potatoes round out the meal.  The garlic salt is not necessary, and make sure you use real maple syrup.  Just wonderful!

An excellent and easy-to-make recipe.  I added sesame seeds, let the salmon marinate longer than required, and grilled it instead of baking it...making for an absolutely delicious main course.

While the marinade was very good, this definitely needed to sit for much longer than the recipe called for: the flavor didn't permeate.

Delicious....I crushed some pecans and added them to the maple mixture. It was immediately a family favorite.

Made this with lite maple pancake syrup and omitted the garlic salt and added some extra fresh garlic.  Everyone liked it. Even my DH, who "doesn't like salmon", wants to make it again! Tasty and easy recipe.

This was okay, but not something I'd make again. I prefer the lemon/dill/herbs approach of preparing salmon. This made it a little too sweet and it came out dry.

Used Talapia instead of Salmon and turned out very well.  Like many others I am not a big 'fish' eater, but this had a very mild fish flavor, if any at all.  I also used sugar free syrup for a healthier version, so I didn't get that crispy outside texture that real syrup would give, but all the flavor was there.

I really loved it. I made it with ingredients I had on hand, used veri teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce, and it turned out great. I really liked how the sauce carmelized on the salmon and turned the top layer a little crunchy.  I love baked salmon and this is a great way to add a little variety.

This was quite good - sweet.  Not my very favorite salmon recipe, but certainly a great option and I love that you don't have to marinate it for very long.

At my son's request, I made salmon for my son (9) to celebrate the last day of school.  His friend was over and said he HATED fish.  I made him promise that he would try 1 bite and then I would make him a PB&J.  The boys both ate 2 full helpings and my husband and I both barely got any!  So much for hating fish!  Great recipe...easy too!

Had my doubts about the maple syrup, soy sauce, and garlic...but it turned out wonderful!  It was a nice light flavor and very tasty--complimented the salmon nicely.

Really good!  This dish was very easy to prepare and perfect for a weeknight meal.  The marinade is so tasty-- not too salty, not too sweet-- the result was a big hit at my house and I'll definitely make this again.  Since I was pressed for time, I only marinated for 20 minutes, and it still tasted great.  Next time I'll marinate longer for even more flavor.

I have never made salmon in my life, until I used this recipe last night. My family never raised me to like fish and I was quite nervous but wanted to try something new. I loved it, it was super easy and tasted great. Quite different than any other salmon I had tried (the very few times). My boyfriend is a huge seafood fan and loves salmon and he loved this! I was quite impressed with the outcome.

Made this recipe as written. It was a wonderful change from our usual salmon (using Chef Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish Magic-try it!) Maple, soy and salmon go together perfectly!

Excellent recipe!  I'm on a reduced carb diet and I used Cary's sugar-free syrup to keep the carb count down. It still turned out excellent. I'll definitely make this again.  If it was good with sugar-free syrup, then I can only imagine how yummy it would be with the real thing.

FAVORITE salmon recipe. We love salmon and this is so easy and simply the best! I try other salmon recipes but then wish I would have just stuck with this one. Remember to use "pure" maple syrup or it will be too sweet.  Can't beat it!

I made a half amount based on suggestions of 2tbsp maple syrup,1tbsp soy sauce,1 clove garlic(minced),1/2 tsp grated ginger and a pinch of crushed black pepper. It was delicious,and I know I'll make it again and again. My mom mocked me and said it was an awful idea,but she had to eat her words when she tasted it!

Oh my gosh, what a FABULOUS & easy recipe! Per other reviews I omitted the garlic salt & basted it a few times during baking. I will DEFINITELY make this again, as good as any salmon dish I've had out. And remember, if you're going to eat salmon, make it WILD (not Atlantic, it's a tricky name for farmed raised salmon)

I've been trying out lots of recipes from this site, and my husband said "This is delicious- the best one yet!" He usually doesn't like fish cooked at home due to the smell, but this didn't smell fishy. I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but I really liked this, as did my 2 yr old. I added chopped ginger, as some other reviewers suggested.  Will make many more times!

This was WONDERFUL!!!  My husband does not even like salmon and he loved it.  I added a teaspoon of ginger, but I think it would have been wonderful without it.  I used pure maple syrup, so I am not sure how it would taste with artificial.

Salmon turns out absolutely amazing, just make sure you use 100% pure maple syrup, it makes a big difference.  I also added a tbsp. of freshly grated ginger and it was really good.  I marinated the salmon overnight in a foil lined pan and then just popped it in the oven when the time came.  I allowed 1/2 hour and it came out perfect.  My sauce didn't burn off at all so I was very happy about that.    Thanks for posting.

This was wonderful. As other have said, it is a very subtle maple flavour that comes through the salmon and the result is a light but flavorful dish. I have made this many times exactly as written and it is wonderful every time. DO NOT marinate longer than 30 minutes as salmon takes on a bitter flavour if you do. 

2008- I have to now add that this recipe so impressed a guest (set-up date) that he asked me out again and a year later, we got married. I expect it took more than a great recipe (!) but my now husband still asks for the dish that "reeled him in"!!

I was a little skeptical about making this at first because of the maple syrup.  I'm not one to like super sweet things on my meal for dinner.  I am so glad I took the plunge and made it.  This was SO WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS!  The sweetness is very subtle, as another reviewer mentioned.  I will definately be making this again without question.  This was a great accompaniment w/ rice and a veggie.  YUM!  Thanks so much for a terrific recipe that's truly a keeper!

I have never liked salmon but decided to try this because so many reviews said it was great even for salmon haters.  I'm sure if you are a fan of salmon this is probably good.  I love seafood but after trying this I've realized I dislike salmon intensely.  I wanted to like it but I ended up throwing it out.  The sauce was good but beware. If you don't like salmon, this probably won't change your mind.

One of the most delicious salmon recipes I've ever made/consumed!  Even non-salmon lovers will like this one.  And it's oh-so-easy to make.

I knew I had salmon in the fridge, but I wanted to cook it differently then baking or grilling...This was so YUMMY!  It aroma of the maple turned my kitchen into a place to hang out while it cooked. The family loved it - seconds (even those little ones).

This salmon was delicious; although the maple flavor was not as strong as I expected it would be the garlic made up for it.

This recipe was okay.  If you like sweet, it's for you.  I think the syrup overpowers the flavor of the salmon.

It was only ok. I marinated it for 4 hours. My children didn't like it because it was too sweet. I thought it was ok but it really needed an acid like vinegar or wine to penetrate the fish.

This was good.  I spread some dijon mustard onto the fish before marinating, which I think really added to the flavor.  I also cooked the fish in foil and opened it up at the end to give it a nice crust.  Delicious.

I can't say that I cook very often at all. I just moved in with my boyfriend and I think the need to be domestic took over. I did have the New York City Fire Department on call just in case anything went wrong lol..... It was wonderful. It was easy enough to make and now I'm having maple salmon cravings all the time......It definitely helped to take away my fear of cooking!

This recipe was great! My whole family enjoyed it! Quick tip; I increased the serving amount to 8 people and found that it was not fully cooked in 20 mins! In fact took 30! Just something to be awear of! Otherwise it was perfect!

I did as NurseEllen suggested & added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. I did cook this in a covered baking dish for 10 minutes & then uncovered it for the last 10. Served it w/ a fresh salad w/ Pear Honey Vinaigrette & sweet potato spears topped w/ maple butter...with an array of leftover Christmas goodies for dessert.  It was  very easy, yet still elegant enough for a special dinner...thanks!

We both love salmon and I've never tried a way to cook this fish that I didn't like. But this one is an all-time winner!!! As a previous reviewer said, the sauce (maple, garlic and soy with a salmon flair) would make cardboard taste good. Definitely a keeper!

Thank you, Starflower! We really enjoyed this one. I used Grade B cooking maple- available online from Highland Sugarworks. It's a staple in my kitchen, especially for ham & pork. But now I'll use it on salmon, too! I liked the foil packet idea... kept it moist & easy cleanup, too!

I (along with most of my family) was skeptical of this one. I must say we were all proven wrong! I made this almost as written - I had no garlic salt so used almost 2 cloves garlic and a small pinch of salt instead. Then reduced the marinade down and thickened with a bit of corn starch and drizzled a bit over top when serving.  Was a HUGE hit. Have made with Atlantic Salmon and Coho. Coho won hands down. Definately worth a try... Thanks!

Wicked yummy!  The sauce is sweet without being too sweet. I served it over mashed potatoes and even my 3 year-old was scraping her plate.  Will definitely tell my friends about this one.

This was perfect. I marinated the salmon skin-side up/face down for one hour. I also took another reviewer's advice and used aluminum foil packets which made for easy clean up. I baked twenty minutes unwrapped foil and broiled for 5. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  I read reviews and followed some advice.  I baked in foil, for easy clean up and to keep the fish moist.  I carmelized the sauce by adding corn starch and whisking on the stove top to drizzle over the fish.  I topped with coarsely chopped pecans during the last 10 mins. of baking.  I served with brown rice and veggies.  The flavor of the extra sauce and the nuts were perfect!  A new favorite.  Thanks!

I absolutely loved this dish.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  My husband raved about it.  Next time I will add some crushed pecans.

I tried this but my personal opinion is salmon is sweet enough and need tang or bite. This is just my opinion and many people who like the extra sweet will like this recipe. I might try it on fresh tuna.

This didn't wow me.  The maple flavour kind of got lost, and it just tasted sweet.  I felt like it was a waste to have bought a bottle of real maple syrup to make this - another recipe I've tried from this site for grilled salmon, which calls for brown sugar, was better and more economical.  My husband didn't finish his.

This is BY FAR the best salmon recipe I have ever found. I have already gave this recipe to 5 people, and I plan on making this recipe for my parents this weekend. Just try it, and you'll know why it was given 5 stars by EVERYONE!!

I am usually not fond of salmon, but this preparation is excellent.  The sweetness of the maple syrup and the complexity of the soy sauce make an interesting combination.

My husband and I tried this last night and it was GREAT!!  I doubled the sauce so I'd have enough to thicken on the stove to pour over the salmon when done.  I didn't double the soya though...just 3 tbsp. and like another reviewer I added 4 cloves of minced garlic and no garlic salt.  Really good!

I thought this was very good.  Used wild salmon and added chopped pecans in the last 10 min. of baking.  My husband & I thought it really needed the pecans...would be boring w/o them. I think next time I will take another reviewers suggestion and add cornstarch to the marinade and make a sauce to pour over the top.  Will make again!

Wow...this was really good.  I added crushed pecans (lots of them) on the top as someone else suggested.  My husband said that it was definately restaurant quality.  This is the ONLY way that I will cook my salmon from now on.

OMG this was soooo good. I don't know how to cook fish and have only made Salmon a few times. This is my favorite Salmon recipe now! Easy and delicious. I didn't change a thing!....except maybe add a little more syrup before baking.

This is one of the better Salmon recipes I have tried.  I used real maple syrup which is less sweet than maple flavored syrup like Aunt Jemima. The flavors balanced perfectly with the sweetness of the syrup and the saltiness of the soy sauce.  Great sauce for the fish.
Thanks!

Raves all around. It was better then I expected. I marinaded in fridge for about 2 1/2 hours. 20 minutes is about right cooking time. I did over cook it a little cause I thought it was not done enough, but I was mistaken.

This was very good, and I'd rate it 5 stars for ease. We grilled our 5oz salmon filets for four minutes on a George Foreman Grill, and they were perfectly cooked. There are salmon recipes I prefer the taste of (Asian Salmon, and Dijon Baked Salmon, on this site) but this was by far the easiest.

This salmon recipe is delicious! The salmon was perfectly baked. We did add a little extra pure maple syrup, just because we like it, and drizzled it on top of the salmon before baking. This is a keeper!

This was a truely delicious dish.  At first when I was marinating the salmon, I thought the soy sauce would overpower the maple syrup, but when it came out of the oven, the sweetness of the maple and the savoury/salty flavour of the soy brought a different flavour to salmon that I would never have thought to do or enjoy.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it, will cook again and recommend it to my friends.

Wow ... this was probably the best salmon I've ever had. I don't eat much fish and I almost never cook it at home because I hate the fishy smell in the house. But this really smells wonderful while it cooks! Some people say that 20 minutes doesn't seem like enough cooking time, but personally, I thought it was perfect since I don't like fish overcooked. Also, I marinated the salmon for 2 1/2 hours to give it more depth of flavor, lined the baking dish with foil and cooked the fish in the marinade, and basted it twice with the marinade during cooking. Absolutely delicious and my husband wants it on the "regular rotation"! Thanks, Starflower!  :o)

Yum!!! So easy & so good. Wild Salmon is on sale right now!!! I think those of you who had sticking problems must have used pancake syrup. Use real maple syrup- much tastier & not as thick as, say, Log Cabin! It is more expensive, but worth it! It would probably be even better if you broil it a few minutes after cooking, but I'm lazy & it tastes great as written. It won't be too salty if you use low-sodium soy sauce. I bake mine for 25-30 minutes. I'm pleasantly surprised that the # of carbs isn't too bad! I figured it would be with the maple syrup. Thanks for submitting!!!

This was fantastic.  I doubled the sauce to have some to put on some rice on the side and I also marinated it overnight.   The whole family loved it including my 2 year old who won't eat anything but toast!  This will become a regular recipe for my family.

My husband is not a big fish fan so when he say things like "this is really good" and "this is the best salmon I've ever eaten", I know I have a winning recipe. I started marinating my salmon first thing in the morning to give it about 8 hours in the sauce. The cooking time was perfect, 20 minutes was just right. Also, be sure to use real maple syrup.

It seems a bit redundant, but let me add another rave review. This salmon is awesome! Definitely a keeper recipe, and one we'll prepare over and over again. I do agree that marinating for longer than 30 minutes is a good idea, but if that's all the time you have, that's OK too. What a wonderful flavor this fish had.

Very Good and very Easy. We really loved this way of baking Salmon. I only had low fat maple syrup to use but it was still delicious and lower in calories. I would put a touch more garlic and try real maple syrup next time though. I will definitely be keeping this recipe around!!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I've made it twice already and each time it turns out so GOOD!!! Although I don't cook it on the same pan as I sauted because the marinade burned before the fish was done. I just saute it and I also put slits in the fish so that it would soak up more of the flavor!! Thanks so much for this recipe!! Is now and forever a family favorite!!

I really love this recipe and have now made it twice.  Both times, though, I have had real issues w/ the timing--it always takes more than 20 minutes!  Does anyone else experience this?  I'm doing at least 30 minutes each time.  That said...turning it over once while baking is also really a great way to do this dish.  Serve w/ steamed asparagus and it is a great meal!

This is the best seafood recipe I have ever made or had. Everyone I serve it to raves about it...even my friend from Cape Cod who is obsessed with seafood said it was the best he has ever tasted. Do make sure you use the real Maple Syrup...it is the only way to go.

I thought this recipe was tasty, but underwhelming. My husband thought it was way too sweet. (If you don't like sweet sauces, you WILL NOT like this recipe.) Also, kids hated it. Go figure. If it was just me, I would probably make again, but family didn't go for it, so this one is out for us.

This is the only way I will serve salmon from now on!  This recipe is incredibly easy and extremely delicious!  I made two pans up, cooked them both on Saturday, ate one fillet on Saturday, heated the second one up on Sunday and it was even better the second night!  THANKS Starflower!

I had my doubts about maple syrup with soy sauce, but I have got to tell you, this is a FANTASTIC way of making salmon. We enjoyed it and I'm certain that we will make it again. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Thanks Starflower!

Excellent and simple, the way salmon should be.  I used salmon filets and marinated for a couple of hours.  This works just as well on the bbq.   Whatever you do, don't overcook the salmon.

I am from Alaska and have been eating salmon all of my life and this is one of my favorite recipes...it really makes alright salmon taste wonderful, but doesn't cover up the taste of really fresh salmon. It is quick and so simple and SO wonderful.  (I've tasted the same thing at some pretty good restaurants!!)

This was good and I enjoyed it.  I do think, though, that this is more of a dish for people who aren't into salmon (like hubby) and need a sweet sauce to make it palatable.  For those of us who already love salmon, this is a sweet and tasty recipe but not exactly memorable.

I saw this recipe on the website while I was at work.  Since I already had the salmon and all the ingredients for this recipe I decided to make it for dinner that night.  My only problem was that I would be getting home to late to really marinate the salmon for 30 min.  So as soon as I got home I mixed up the marinade an probably only let it sit for about 5 or 10 min.  Popped it in the oven for more like 30 min. instead of the 20 min. in the recipe.  I used real maple syrup and had no problem with the marinade burning up.  The salmon came out done perfectly and had a really great taste.  Next time I make this I will marinade it for the full amount of time just to see what the difference in taste would be.  If you don't have the full 30 min to marinade I wouldn't let it stop you from trying this recipe.

THIS IS FANTASTIC!  I LOVED IT, AND I'M NOT A REAL FISH-LOVER.  MY HUSBAND LIKES FISH, BUT NOT SALMON.  HE RAVED ABOUT IT ALL EVENING.  I PREPARED IT EXACTLY AS IT WAS SHOWN, INCLUDING THE 30-MINUTE MARINATING, AND IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY.  I CAN GUARANTEE THIS RECIPE WILL BE USED OFTEN.      THANK YOU, STARFLOWER

We loved this recipe. It was great for afterwork...simple, not a lot of clean up. And it tasted awesome, just the right mix of sweet + serious. It's definitely a keeper. (I used two cloves of garlic and no garlic salt...)

I used 2 large salmon steaks,which I knew wouldn't be enough for myself and 2 grown children so I added tilapia too this also. I doubled the marinade and let it sit for several hours. This is a fish loving family and no one liked this. Even though this marinated several hours  it was very suttle and didn't have much flavor. All you could taste was sweetness. The kids didn't like it and I wasn't overly thrilled. We prefer a more savory fish with spices. I ended up with 1 salmon left out of 2. If you like sweet fish you would probably enjoy this but it wasn't for us. Sorry.

This was very tasty, but I think that the name "maple salmon" is misleading.  I marinated the salmon for more than eight hours - much longer than the 30 minutes called for in the recipe.  The finished product did not taste at all like maple - the only purpose of the maple syrup was to lend a mild sweetness to the salmon.

Great salmon!  One of the best we've tried from this site.  We cooked this on the grill and it turned out fabulous.

It's a great recipe for salmon! If you reduce the leftover marinade, it becomes a wonderful sauce for the fish as well as rice.

This was great!

Just made this for dinner, and my wife and six year old son loved it exactly as written. We only had sugar free maple syrup on hand, but the flavor was still excellent.

Made a bit of rice and sautÃ©ed spinach as a side. No leftovers!

Very good. Wish it tasted a little more like the marinade. Next time, despite the warnings, I WILL marinate it longer than 30 min.

This was amazing!!  I didnât know salmon could taste so good!  My boyfriend loved it and he was upset that I didnât make extra since it tasted so good!!  I followed the recipe exactly and we will definitely be making this again!  The flavor was Amazing!

My new favorite salmon recipe! I make it so much that measurements are not necessary anymore and I throw things in by taste. If you love garlic, adding more minced garlic is definitely the way to go. Don't forget or omit the garlic salt! Even though you've put in minced garlic, the garlic salt is still needed for that extra bit of parsley flavor. Wonderful  easy recipe and I'm so glad I found it and was able to make it right without burning my kitchen down!

I made it with trout instead of salmon. Had to cook it a bit longer than it said, use parchment paper is my only suggestion. Turned out delicious!!

Great recipe!  I used a ginger garlic paste that I had on hand instead of fresh garlic, and poured out most of the marinade near the end of the cooking time as per previous suggestions.  

Will definitely use this again!

A little dry.  I'm going to lower the temp to 350 next time.  I'll also pump up the garlic and pepper.  Made it w/o salt.

Used Bird Dog Maple Whiskey for the marinade instead of maple syrup which I didn't have. (Funny I would have maple whiskey but not maple syrup!) Baked butternut squash noodles tossed with olive oil and minced garlic on a baking sheet at 400 for 10 minutes first. Then added the marinated salmon on top and cooked another 20 minutes. I poured the marinade over the salmon and squash for cooking. Very good!

pretty good! followed the recipe exactly except didnt use the garlic salt as it was salty enough. I liked the tip of marinating the fish face down so it soaked up all the goodness.. doubled the sauce recipe and used the leftover over top of my brussel sprouts

This is the best recipe for salmon.  Healthy.  Not too much sugar or seasoning.  Easy because you only need to marinade for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven.  I totally recommend this recipe.  I do this at least once a week now.

Have always loved salmon and have prepared it many ways many times. I worried that this recipe was going to be too much maple syrup taste but I followed the directions like a scientist. My wife and I were amazed. Our meal was excellent. Really, really good.

I opted to leave out the garlic and it turned out very tasty!!  Sweet and slightly salty sauce made for a delicious addition to rice on the side.  Will make this again!  New Year's Eve Meal ; )

I made this recipe exactly and added some grated ginger like others suggested.  The marinade was delicious,  but I thought it did Not go with the salmon at all. Sweet and salmon do not go together for my taste. I might try the marinade with chicken but will definitely  Not make this again with salmon.

Used pure maple syrup from Minneapolis Farmers Market and cut soy sauce in half so maple flavor would be more present. One of the easiest ways the fix either fresh or individually packaged salmon. Glad I found this recipe!

I made this just as the recipe suggested and thought it was great. I would definitely serve this to company. Everyoneâs oven is different and you have to adjust for thickness etc. It has a beautiful nice subtle flavor. Thanks for sharing!

It was delicious. I had 3 ponds of salmon and adjusted the marinade accordingly. Best salmon I have ever eaten. Everyone raved about it. I will make it again.

Delicious!
The recipe does call to marinate the salmon prior, however I just poured the sauce mixture over top of my fillets on a tin foil-lined baking sheet, and it turned out wonderfully!
A definite repeat recipe in our house.

I love salmon but because I make it a lot, my kids are over it. I gave this recipe a go, and it was a crowd pleaser! I'm always looking for something healthy but also easy. If I can accomplish a tasty meal with minimal ingredients, I'm a happy woman.
This recipe hits all the requirements: very tasty, very easy, healthy and the kids commented on how it's the best salmon I've made.

This was so good! My 15 year old daughters first time eating salmon and she loved it. I had to leave out the garlic because it upsets my stomach but I just used regular sea salt instead of garlic salt and omitted the fresh garlic. Still a fantastic recipe. Highly recommend! Iâm sure it tastes even better with the garlic!

Did it as directed today in oven.  Very good flavor. 

Iâve done this before, marinated then  drained it  and grilled it on barbecue. Sprinkled a little cinnamon on top before grilling. Very unique flavor. 

Either way a real winner.

The recipe overall is really good, but I donât feel like the taste was through the salmon. It was only on the very top and even then, very mild. Also, it need a longer marinade g time.

The seasoning on this was fantastic.  It is especially appreciated on the first day when it feels like fall outside.  There is no doubt that my family will ask for this again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did try to crisp the top, but it didn't work out quite right - that's on me not the recipe.

As someone that had serious doubt before trying this recipe, knowing how strongly âfishyâ flavored salmon in particular is, I HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Delicious maple marinade masks the salmon flavors perfectly. My boyfriend even, who hates fish, practically licks his plate clean when I make this. House smells great while itâs baking. Served here with Parmesan couscous and broccoli. Very satisfied.

Followed the recipe exactly how it was written! Delicious! The kids loved it! I marinated for 15 min face down skin up, then another 15 mins face up skin down. Put it in the oven and enjoyed with white rice and sweet corn.

Delicious. Instead of baking, I throw mine on the grill for 12 minutes per inch of thickness. Better than any Salmon Iâve had at a restaurant.

Very tasty. We used a bourbon barrel aged maple syrup. I would strongly recommend basting the salmon with the marinade during cooking OR boiling down the marinade to a thicker syrup and pouring over top before baking. The flavor not being strong enough following the directions as written is the only reason it didnât get 5 stars.

Iâm making this for dinner tonight and canât wait.  Note to  M. Blake:  the reason you smelled molasses when using your brown sugar is that brown sugar is white sugar with molasses added.  You can make your own!  I gave it 6 stars because I can taste it already!

Without a doubt, the most delicious baked salmon that I have eaten in many years.  The compliments to the chef (me) were numerous.  The dish was easy to fix, and I won't hesitate to say that it will be on our menu again in the near future.  The only addition that I made was a  small  spritz of lemon.  This is a can't miss dish....you will love it.

This was very good. One of the better salmon recipes here.
Next time I may add a sprinkle of syrup or brown sugar just before it goes in the oven.

I made it as the recipe stated using low-sodium soy sauce and 3 salmon fillets totaling approx 1.3 pounds.  The salmon came out perfectly flaky and moist - not overcooked at all.  Very much appreciate all the knowledgeable tips others provided.  I have not cooked fish too often and the extra advice really helped to ensure a wonderful meal for my seafood-loving grandson!

Loved it.  My mistake,  I added too much fresh garlic.  Sweet and tasty.   Used the leftovers in a pasta dish the next day.

Delicious! I made it exact (I did use low sodium soy sauce because that is what I had on hand) and it came out amazing. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and glazed carrots in honey and rosemary. This recipe will be going on my dinner rotation plan.

Wow! This recipe is a keeper!! The only difference I made was that instead of baking it, I cooked the salmon in my Instant Pot at high pressure for 4 minutes (do 3 minutes for smaller portions), then did a quick release. While the salmon was cooking, I boiled down the marinade in a saucepan on the stove, which turned into a thick, decadent sauce as it cooled.... think of a topping on a Sundae!! Will be doing this one again....and again!!!

For someone that hates fish,my husband had a second helping, and commented on how good it was. The salmon was easy to prepare and the marinade gave it lots of flavour as well as making it very moist. The fact that you didnât have to marinate it for hours made the recipe a good last minute choice. I served it with rice palif also in All recipes

This was by far the most delicious samon dish I have ever tasted. I made this for my whole family and they agreed. The marinate sauce was delicious and I suggest using it in other things as well. You could use it in rice, maybe even stir fry. It was AMAZING!!!

I made this per the recipe using fresh sockeye salmon. I didnât care for the flavor, even though I like both soy and maple syrup.  Overwhelmed the fish taste.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point for dinner.  Rather than use soy sauce, I subbed in 2 Tablespoons of dijon mustard.  I know, I know, this isn't the recipe.  No matter, it was yummy and DH ranked it right up there with his favorites.  Now I have to go put it on the "LIST"!

Double the sauce. Pour extra sauce on the fish when it finished cooking. Very tasty!!!

Also you can bake your veggies on the same pan as the fish.  Pour the extra sauce on the veggies too!
Yummy!!!!

I love it. I baked this for my family and it was a total hit!!! I do have to say that 1 puond is to little for more than two people so I had to double the amount. I also kept the aluminum foil on top of the baking dish while cooking it which keeps it juicy, but  you can just as well remove it and have it be more caramelized at the cost of it being more dry.

It was fabulous!  My husband has never been fond of baked salmon (from resaurants) because it was always dry and basically tasteless.  But, now he looks forward to when I serve salmon....prepared with this recipe, of course.

Boy oh boy is this a crowd pleaser! I baked a whole fillet using the recipe as written ... it came out so beautiful in the glass pan it got oohs and aahhs. It didnât last long on the plates, either! Now when Iâm having a hard time deciding how to cook the salmon, Iâll be coming back to this recipe a LOT.

I make this almost every week.  The only change I make is to lower the sodium but that is for my health.  This is a great recipe.  I prefer it with a white bean mash and sauteed spinach.  Yum!

I made this to bring to my cousins on the West Coast of Florida. Marinated overnight, kept in a cooler with ice and cooked it the  day I got there. I baked as directed and served with sour cream and baked potatoes. They raved about it!

I made this tonight. I was looking for something easy to put together and no fuss to cook. This met my priorities and then some. Few ingredients and after a short marinate period just pop it in the oven. My husband is not a fish lover but took one bite and pronounced it was good; a significant  statement from a non fish lover.

This came out pretty good. Per some of the reviewer's suggestions, I cut back a bit on the maple syrup and added a little dried ginger. My filet was not too thick, so I took it out of the oven a few min earlier. Nice recipe!

Made this  following the directions, I did wrap the salmon in foil to bake for 15min, broiled for 5 min uncovered.  I also doubled the glaze, boiled it and used it as a sauce.  It was a success and easy to make.

Very easy dinner!  Used the foil method that other reviewers suggested to ensure the salmon fillet was completely submerged in the marinade/sauce. Started with 20 minutes, then kept checking every 5 minutes until it looked cooked through. Salmon didn't  get dry at all and cooked all the way through! Served with a side of green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. Delicious, will cook again maybe with a little less maple syrup and a bit of crushed red pepper :)

I prepared it as described. The only difference was it was wild salmon with skin on so I put the salmon on tin foil skin side down before marinating. It makes it easy to remove the skin.

This has become one of my favorite dishes to cook for dinner! I used the ingredients exactly as posted. I marinate the salmon for 30 minutes and bake it in a 10" round aluminum pan that is lined with aluminum foil on the bottom. 20 minutes at 350 degrees and it comes out perfect. The sauce does not dry out while baking on the foil, and the foil makes cleanup easy afterward!

Recipe worked out great. I prepared it for my wife after she had an extremely long day plus I was off work that night. I added rice pilaf and she made fried green beans. She loved it and her friends were impressed.

I added a tablespoon of sweet chili sauce and subbed coconut aminos for the soy sauce. My filets were a little thinner so cook time was closer to 15-17 minutes. We really loved it!

My fiancÃ© made this for me for Valentineâs day! Itâs delicious, so moist, tender, and the flavour can be enhanced by spooning more sauce on top. The instructions were so simple and straightforward that he carried it out perfectly and it came out amazing. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make this again

I would give it higher but the app turns off Apple iTunes music when Iâm listening to music while cooking.  Very frustrating that I cannot listen to music with this app open to a recipe.

This was wonderful, especially for a quick weeknight meal. The only changes I made was two cloves of garlic instead of one and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Adding this to my recipe binder. Thanks!

This came out fantastic. I only used two small sliced fillets of the salmon and the sauce cooked down into a thick, delicious sauce that paired perfectly with the baby spinach, diced bacon and sweet baby brocoli I'd made as a side.

Fully recommended.

My kids absolutely loved it. Me on the other hand, I can't say I am a fan of fish with a "sweetness" to it. The syrup wasn't overpowering or anything, just not something for me. But if the kids liked it...it's a winner in my book.

This is one of the best recipes Iâve used for salmon, and I make it very often.  My kids absolutely love this dish, and Iâve made it exactly according to the recipe with no changes.  It always turns out perfect!  My husband who doesnât care for fish definitely likes this one.  Thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe.

I now like salmon because of this recipe and we eat it once a week. I double the sauce so there is plenty to serve. I didnât notice more flavor marinating it, so I skip that now. I cook for 15-20 minutes and I remove the skin before serving with the sauce. Yum!

This is our new favorite salmon recipe: tasty and easy to make.  The flavors blend together beautifully, and complement the salmon without overwhelming the taste of the salmon.  Give this recipe a try.  You wonât be disappointed.

Very good. I did wrap in foil- baking and broiling time depend on thickness of steaks. Instead of making a gravy with sauce  as some reviewers did- I sprinkled fillets with brown sugar and spooned sauce on top to broil and get a crust on. Spooned sauce over salmon when served. Delicious. You can vary his with lemon pepper, ginger, etc. all would work well. Thanks for a great recipe- with tweaks it is a 5 Star

What a delicious meal I made last night.  I've used Aldi's frozen salmon for this meal. It was so easy to make and came so well together. I would make it again. No other alterations. I made it again and it was even better.

Perfectly tender and flaky, just the right amount of maple sweetness.  This turned a bag of inexpensive, frozen, farm-raised salmon into a fantastic meal.

This was a hit, but we didn't finish the whole portion. I saved the fish and put it on salad of mixed greens (baby spring and arugula), red grapes (seedless & halved), and a nice balsamic dressing. I used what I had, but I think the key was a slightly sweet dressing, slightly tart lettuce, and the crunch and sweetness of the grapes. Also, I wrapped the salmon in the cooking foil that still had some marinade in it before I refrigerated it. Perfect lunch.

Made it as the recipe said, next time I might add ten minutes a side for a bit more crispy outside. Otherwise it was perfect.

Simple, easy, delicious! I don't even measure most of the time. Just throw it together. I have even made it without marinating before hand and it still tastes delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Nice recipe.. I just found the sauce too sweet dÃ©pitÃ© having added ginger to it ..I added fresh lemon juice to it with little olive oil (after taking out of the oven), and it tasted much better ..

Absolutely delicious recipe. We tripled the recipe to allow for a thorough marinade and extra sauce to complete the dish when serving. We used regular salt instead of garlic salt and it came out extremely flavourful. It was a hit all around!

It was ok if you like your salmon with a sweetness.  It's a taste something like terriake sauce.

Good recipe. Being from Alaska we are sort of Salmon snobs. It needed more fresh ground pepper,  and rosemary.

I see it exactly as stated, and I enjoyed it (where I donât typically eat salmon all). It has a smoky , sweet flavor, but fishy to the same degree as like tuna. My dogs loved it too, but no one else in my house would even try it, sadly. 

I cannot say I will making it again, but it is tastier than I have ever since I tried a taste of Emerilâs when I went to New Orleans more than 10 years ago. It is really great if you like salmon in general. 

I used pure maple syrup, and did omit  the garlic salt because of the soy sauce I had was not low sodium. Since I didnât add garlic salt, I added a smidge extra of minced garlic you buy in a jar.

Well, unfortunately as I was attempting to make it I discovered my soy sauce was too old. :( I tried going without it.  I couldn't find a recipe WITHOUT soy sauce (this site doesn't allow for something like that. It only lets you ADD ingredients, lol. Oh well) And maybe my Salmon was bad; it didn't smell bad. I don't know.  Maybe my maple syrup was not good.  It was pure but maybe too old.  Does syrup go bad?  I suck as a cook so it was probably just me.

This is a delicious dish! I usually use an olive oil-garlic marinade for baked salmon, but am now a convert to this sweet alternative. I followed the recipe almost entirely, although I replaced a quarter of the called-for amount of maple syrup with honey instead.Then I folded a piece of  aluminum foil around the salmon and placed it in a glass ovenproof dish for cooking.  I paired the fish with basmati rice, drizzled with Thai chili sauce (mixed with a bit of honey to lessen the heat) and topped with toasted sesame seeds. I sprinkled some of the seeds over the salmon, as well. Thanks, STARFLOWER, for this fantastic, easy-to-follow recipe!

Like Starflower, my husband didnât care much for salmon until he had this recipe.  He declared it a âKeeperâ after just a couple of bites!  I followed the suggestions to increase the minced garlic (I grated mine) and use sea salt instead of garlic salt and to bake it for about 4-6 minutes per 1/2" thickness and I'm so glad I did both.  Next time I'll cook it a couple less minutes, then broil it for the last two as was also suggested.  Also,  I only fixed  two 3/4" filets with the full recipe of marinade.  I would double the marinade if I were to fix four.  Excellent and easy recipe.  Thank you, Starflower!

I think this would have come out 10 times better if I had marinated the salmon. I just didnât have the extra 30 min. The salmon still came out pretty good. I did use brown sugar and maple syrup. I doubled the sauce, and seasoned the salmon with salt, pepper, and a creole seasoning (lightly seasoned). My  4 year old daughter, aka picky eater number 1, ate it up. The hubby and I enjoyed it, as well. Itâs a keeper, but next time Iâll definitely marinate the salmon.

My father and daughter devoured this recipe. My kid thought it could have been much better if it had more of the marinade flavor. This is after I let it sit in the marinade for almost two hours. As such, I think we will try the cardamom maple next time. Perhaps a bit of spice will liven things up. Also, the cook time on the recipe is entirely too long. I overcooked my fish in under eight minutes. Twenty could end up as salmon jerky!

I usually don't care for salmon but this was terrific. I added some fresh cilantro and reduced the marinade by half at the end. Served over white rice. Can't wait to try it with other types of fish.

Extremely simple and absolutely delicious! I did not have garlic salt so I added about 1/8 tsp of roasted garlic powder and everything else was the same. Cooked 1 piece for 17 mins (smaller) and the other for 20. The flavors work great together. This will be a new go to for my salmon dishes! :)

Excellent recipe...I followed it exactly except I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I did not marinate because I didnât have the extra time.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

I donât know if I should review this ... but there it goes, Sunday dinner and my sister with her family visiting . I had one Extra-large salmon that I did not cut up or filleted and I did not have maple syrup! so replaced that with organic honey, and I made the marinade and kept tasting it till I really liked it versus sticking to the recipe And marinated the whole fish for 4 hours then I backed it for one hour , and they loved it it was a hit

I love how the maple comes through and the garlic is not too overpowering. Hubby liked it too so definitely will add this to my arsenal of go-to dinner recipes!

Great marinade recipe, quick and easy!  For an Asian twist add just a little fresh grated, or dried ginger.  The salmon can be baked, cooked on the stovetop, or it's  delicious cooked on a smoky grill.  Be very carefull not to overcook the fish.  Salmon is easy to overcook, it dries out and loses flavor. To cook fish perfectly, remove it from the heat source before it appears fully cooked, while there is still some translucency in the middle. Take a sharp knife or fork and peek into the thickest part. If the fish flakes easily, but still has some translucency in the middle, it is done. It should not, however, look raw. Fish keeps cooking for several minutes after being removed from the heat. If you wait until the fish looks done, it will be dry by the time it reaches the table.

This was so good, it got devoured before I could get a picture. I think next time I might marinate longer than 30 min. Got some of the flavor of syrup and garlic, but not as much as I hoped for.  Still very delicious and easy recipe!!

I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but my husband loves it.  This was a great recipe, easy to follow and delicious. He even asked, what I did to season it, so it was no ordinary flavor to him.  I would make it again.

I donât even like salmon. This is the best Iâve ever had. It will be joining my food rotation.

The recipe is delicious however I echo another comment made about cooking salmon.  I cooked mine about 26 min @ 400F because it was pretty thick.  Otherwise this was a hit!! Paired it with wild rice and a Gorgonzola salad.

This is awesome. I made it and added a little more maple and wow. Donât marinade it any longer than 39 mins. Perfect timing.

Excellent! Salmon was very moist & tender. I made a sauce reduction with the Salmon Marinade while salmon was cooking.  I added a little more maple syrup to marinade & cooked to reduce to a delicious sauce to finish the Maple Salmon. I served with Saffron Rice & Ginger Carrots.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This was super-easy and kept the salmon moist. Marinade was a little too sweet for our taste. Will definitely make this again, with a little less maple syrup and more garlic. Thanks for the recipe.

I used honey in this recipe instead of maple syrup. I also used the other ingredients listed but didnt measure, just eyeballed and it turned out delicious. For those who are not accostumed to eyeballing I recommend you measure.

The maple syrup ran off the salmon and created a thick mess at bottom of pan.  Son who normally loves salmon, asked to never make it again.  Epic failure.

I added a tablespoon of fresh ginger paste, marinated it overnight. I also added heat the second time I made it - using cayenne pepper and a dash of Frank's hot sauce. Either way it was delicious. You definitely want to line the baking pan with foil as the syrup really sticks and is hard to clean.

Very flavorful and easy. I added about a 1/2 Tsp of Red Chili Flakes, just because we like a little heat and it worked very well.

The recipe has been added to my favorites!

Turned out great!  I have have to admit, this was my first time making salmon. I tried this recipe because it looked so easy and it is!  Very happy with the result.

This recipe was great! I added to the salmon (for additional seasoning) minced garlic, lemon juice and salmon seasoning. The meal tasted absolutely delicious!!!

I did as many suggested and marinated and baked in an aluminum foil packet.  Very easy and effective and no clean-up. This makes a tasty sauce, but I think I prefer salmon with more traditional ingredients like dill.  My husband really liked it.

I love this recipe.  I usually make it on baked chicken breasts actually.  I add just  a small amount of fresh ginger and a pinch of brown sugar.

I made this salmon today for my wife's birthday! Doubled everything exactly for 2.5 lbs of salmon. Salmon was absolutely tasty and delightful in every way. She and our two  adult children loved it. Rice pilaf, steamed broccoli, and strawberry spring salad completed the meal. Had I thought, I. this have added

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was excellent.  What I like about the recipe is that the ingredients are always in my pantry and it is very easy.  I gave each person a small bowl of the cooked marinade to use as they wished, I didn't want all of the other things on the plate swimming in marinade.  This meal received rave reviews from my family and myself.

I made this as well. I disagree with marinating no more than 30 minutes. I let my fish marinate overnight. We love that extra flavor of the fish.

WOW!!....this is a very tasty recipe, and quick prep.  We had large salmon filets, so it took a bit longer to cook - but easy to watch over until it is done.  The marinade is easy to put together.  For the "first time" salmon person, this will be a slam dunk - you will love it!!  Give it a try - great recipe.

Turned out perfect! (And Iâm an amateur cook at best). I might try 1.5lbs salmon or slice the portions prior to cooking next time as it falls apart once cooked and the portions are on the light side. We had mashed potatoes and broccoli on the side. My wife & Kids loved it! (Well, the salmon, anyway. The broccoli not so much!)

The first time I read this recipe the combined flavors didnât seem to make sense. But I read the reviews and decided to try it and Iâm happy that I did!  So simple and no need to shop for things you donât keep in your kitchen. We prepare this weekly. Thank you for sharing starflower and thanks to everyone else for your ratings to talk me into it!

Delicious! I didnât use garlic salt but did as someone else suggested and added 2 garlic cloves and a pinch of Himalayan salt. Served with quinoa. Used the left over sauce on the quinoa and my family raves about how yummy dinner was tonight!! Thank you!

I gave this recipe to my husband, as a parting gift when I took the kids and left him! ... Sad, but true... and the kids tell me that he serves this to them every time they visit him on alternate weekends. I did all the cooking for over 18 years, and I wanted to help him learn to cook some "real" food for himself and the kids. This recipe was simple, and with the help of my 11-year old daughter, it was an instant favorite for him. It's comforting to know that my kids are eating healthy meals at home with their dad, along with the boxed macaroni & cheese! This recipe will hopefully be the first of many that give my ex-husband confidence in the kitchen, so he can learn to cook for himself and the kids. He can rely less on take out and packaged foods, so he can save his money to pay child support. :^) THANKS for sharing this easy recipe with our family... it has made our transition just a little bit smoother for all.

Great recipe! The marinade was tasty. I added some fresh grated ginger for a bit of a zing.  I marinated for 1/2 hour and baked on foil at 425 for 16 minutes, until just flaking. The glaze carameled a bit and I sponned on the reserved liquid over the salmon twice while it baked. This was superb  as a warm salad on a bed of baby greens with some boiled baby potatoes, pearl onions and green beans. Canât wait to make it again!

I have made this several times now.  It is my favorite way to fix salmon for a husband who really doesn't care for salmon.  Followed the recipe as written.  It is so easy!

Maybe just me but I did not like the flavor of the dish. Didnât think the maple hoes well with the salmon.

I love the flavors. A nice quick & easy meal.  I served over rice & drizzled a little bit of the sauce over the fish & rice.  Very good.

Made this for a quick weeknight dinner. I actually ended up marinating it overnight (hubby wanted something else the night I originally planned to have it) so it got an extra 24hrs to develop flavor.  This salmon is delicious! And so so easy to make! We enjoyed it with some brown rice and roasted Brussels sprouts.

The only thing I changed was doubling the marinade because I had 2#'s of salmon.  My dinner guest raved over the meal.  I am looking forward to topping my lunch salad today with the few leftovers I had.

I first made this 2 years ago for a Valentine's Day Dinner. Since then, I've continued to make my salmon this way. I follow the recipe exactly, and it is amazing. I usually serve the salmon with rice pilaf, and sauteed green beans.

Tried something different for salmon and I wanted a recipe for the oven. We usually grill salmon but it's much to cold to go outside! Used 1 lb piece of fresh salmon and followed the recipe as it was written, with the addition of some minced onions to the marinade.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and the flavors really blended together! Can't wait to serve this for company!

We always make  Salmon with Lemon, garlic, butter and parsley.  When I saw this recipe, I asked my hubby if he's willing to try and he said yes.  Boy oh boy, this was so unexpected.  It is very delicious and we are going to make this again and again. P. S : I baked the a half of the whole salmon for 20 min uncovered and even the thick part came out dry.   Will try to bake covered or with less time.

Great recipe, but somewhat a bit salty for my taste.   I used a low sodium soy, but still found it salty. Will definitely be making again, but will use less soy sauce and will eliminate any other salts.

Very tasty due to the sweet and salty flavor.  The kids ate it without a fuss.  For me it was a bit too sweet and  next time, I will reduce the maple syrup.

OMG ! This is SO good! Iâm going to be a hypocrite right now because I donât like when commenters completely change a recipe but I did â enhanceâ it to my taste....lol. I prepared the sauce the same way but then added horseradish (a lot because I love it) some extra garlic, and then just dusted the filets with cayenne pepper after marination. I put them in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes, took them out and served with rice pilaf and peas ..... it was SO delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe, I plugged it into my favorites and will definitely be making it again.

I baked the salmon on aluminum foil placed in a glass baking dish. Easy cleanup. As others suggested I added ginger to the marinade. Flipped once during baking.  For the last four minutes I turned on the broiler. Was delicious!  Will be making this dish again!

This turned out very delicious. So easy to make. Covered baking dish with tinfoil, so fish would not dry out. Last 5 min uncovered. Placed fish on Jasmine rice when plating.Will be using this recipe often now.

Follwed the recipe exactly as shown. Perfect Fall dish. Goes great with maple rice that has cranberries, carrots and celery in it. My picky 22 year old took one bite and said.."Oh this is good. It's a keeper mom!"

I made this for dinner and followed the recipe to a tee other than adding a heaping tsp of horseradish and used foil in my baking dish, baked and then broiled last 5 minutes.  

This was the best salmon I've EVER had.  Even my husband, who is the salmon maker in our home, raved about it.

This was such an easy recipe itâs almost embarrassing. I made this last week and my husband and I are still eating the leftovers for meal prepped lunches and dinner this week. Itâs a great way to cook a bunch of salmon at once. I highly recommend this as a low cost but still flavorful way to prepare salmon.

I really don't like fish in general but I could eat this salmon every day. Delicious, easy and comes out perfect every time. A total hit with my husband who also is not a fan of any kind of fish.

This was an easy recipe to follow and it turned out delicious! Didn't have garlic salt so did half garlic powder and half salt. Added a little bit of grounded ginger and omitted the fresh garlic because hubs does not like garlic. We both enjoyed this dish! Will certainly make it again!!

This was really good! I didn't have time to marinate it so i cooked it all up in sealed parchment paper pouch at 375 for 15 minutes. Then i opened it up and broiled on high for 3 minutes to cook up the top. I did omit the garlic salt (personal preference) Served it with a quick spicy mango avocado salsa over brown rice. The contrast of the sweet from the maple and the jalapenos in my salsa was amazing!!

I liked the salmon. I followed people's advice and added some grated ginger on it. It gave some extra flavour. I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on it... YUM!

Used this recipe for the first time cooking salmon. Amazing. I definitely used foil to cook the salmon as well as marinating in the fridge.

Delicious and so easy to make!  I use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce & I cook it on the grill it is just perfect! I've made it a few times now and my 13 year old son and I just love it.

The salmon had a pretty strong maple flavor. I was also hoping that the maple sugar would caramelize and it didn't.

I have made this a few times and really love it.  It is easy to make, and the flavor combination just works very well.  Not too sweet and not too salty.  It is well balanced and complements the flavor of the salmon perfectly.  I like to serve this with broccoli walnut rice.

I made this for dinner a you days ago, and my family loved it. My husband even took the leftovers to work. Usually when I make salmon I end up having to turn the leftovers into salmon patties because nobody will eat them! Super easy to make as well.

Perfect! I wound up marinading for only 10 minutes per side since it was late, but I seared the filet for 2 minutes on each side in a preheated cast iron to maintain flavor before putting it in the oven for at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. An extra person came over in the time I was cooking so to help spread out the fish, I shredded the filet with a fork and mixed it into the remaining marinade to use as onigiri rice ball stuffing. Incredible!! I highly recommend it. Season every 2 cups white rice once it's done cooking with 1/5c vinegar, 2tbsp sugar, and 1tsp salt mixed together and microwaved to dissolve. Pour over rice and mix thoroughly. 2 cups wasn't quite enough for the whole pound of fish, but I was feeding four people and 2 cups of rice usually goes a long way. Definitely making this recipe again, with easy at home ingredients all I have to do is go pick up fish on my way home.

Yup this is the best recipe ever! Super tasty! Although I would definitely line my pan with tin foil because my maple syrup burned and it took some TLC to scrub off.

I followed recipe exactly  It came out perfectly cooked.  We enjoyed the salmon but next time I would change the recipe to make it a little less sweet.  Like Erin's Kitchen I used real maple syrup.  So perhaps that is the sweetness problem

Per my husband, it was very good.  "...liked the flavor, the consistency, but wish there was more sauce".  I found it super easy and quick to make, using readily available ingredients.  Next time I'll double the sauce to appease the hubby :)  This is an easy dish to prepare for guests and they'll have no idea how easy it was, but will sure enjoy it!

Amazing and so easy! Did not change a thing with the original recipe except used low sodium soy & light syrup instead of regular. Can't tell a difference.

My tip is to follow the cooking directions. I'm sure it is a very good recipe but we grilled it on a pellet grill instead of in the oven. It was okay but didn't meet our expectations.

I make this all the time. My hubby and I love this salmon recipe. My mom, dad, and brother also love this recipe when I made if for a family BBQ. I admit that I leave out the garlic salt and sub in sea salt and some garlic granules instead, so same difference I guess? My mom, who doesn't like seafood much said that this recipe made her want to have a second helping of salmon. Sometimes I do like to modify the original recipe a little and it always turns out great. I like to add a dash of liquid smoke, and some parsley to the marinade. Some days I halve the maple syrup and use a few scoops of brown sugar mixed with a few drops of maple flavoring so the salmon gets a nice crust on top.

Had a thicker piece of fish, so cooked it 45 minutes wrapped in foil. Left out the salt. This was very good. Not too sweet, but the maple complements the fish flavor well. Will certainly make again.

My wife LOVED the salmon and glaze.  She said it was even better the next day because I let the fish sit in the glaze all night and she warmed it for lunch.

This dish is amazing! My dad called me the official salmon cooker in the house. It's sweet, it's salty, it's smokey, it's absolutely delicious. Whoever is reading this, and if you haven't made this, I really recommend you make it.

This is good, but I omitted the garlic and garlic salt.  I added the pure maple syrup, 2 T soy sauce and I subbed 1 t chili in adobe. Cooked in small saucepan for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Off heat added a couple Tbls lime or lemon juice.  Marinated for 20 min then added some black pepper and applied the thick sauce/marinade with a brush and cooked at 400 for  13 min.  Then brushed again when done - BEST ever!

Made it exactly as written, was pretty good. 
Liked the maple taste but be careful what you make to go with it, as we had some shrimp and it definately doesn't like the syrup taste left in your mouth. 
Thank you for sharing.

Super easy and delicious. I make extra of the sauce and my husband puts it on the sweet potatoes, rice, or whatever I make for a side to go with it. Win!

I'm not the biggest fan of salmon but I did enjoy the fish grilled with this simple recipe. I would make this again.

I have made salmon with citrus juice before and that was my go-to recipe. But this one was definitely a surprise. I am glad that I now know one more way to make salmon.

This was delicious. Even for my picky eaters. The only thing I wish I had done was reserve some of the marinade to glaze the salmon with or to serve on the side.

Most delicious salmon dish ever!!! The sweetness of the maple syrup and the flavours of the garlic and soy sauce just blend together to make the salmon divine. Salmon is our favourite fish to eat and we eat it weekly. We'll definitely be using this recipe more often.

Personally,  too much salt.  I made brown rice and stir fry veggies and served this on top.  Good but need to adjust.

Had nothing planned for dinner. My husband stopped for at the store and got salmon and my search for a maple salmon glaze turned up this. I was not disappointed!! My kids (12,11,4) all raved that it was the best salmon that I've made. Truthfully I didn't want them to like it so much because I wanted more leftovers!! (smile)

My pickiest of eaters loved, loved, loved this recipe. I didn't have maple syrup so I substituted organic blue agave. I also cooked it, covered with foil for 20 minutes and then uncovered for another 20 minutes. The whole family lived it. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is by far my favorite salmon recipe EVER. My boyfriend isn't a fan of that "fish" flavor and if you're looking for that, this is the recipe for you. The first time I made it, i made it twice in one week. My boyfriend told me "I love this recipe so much, don't make it often!" He thinks this recipe is such a treat and I couldn't agree more. I put these in foil packets and made sure I spooned on the extra marinade in the packets. When the fish was nearly done I opened the foils and put the oven on broil for that "crust" I like on fish. If I could give this more than 5 stars, I certainly would!

Super tasty. Great way to make salmon!  Weather permitting, we grill it on cedar planks for optimum flavor.

My only changes were to add 2 garlic cloves, leave out the garlic salt and added 1 TBS of orange juice concentrate. Also, used lemon pepper and onion powder. The citrus was a nice addition. I just uncovered the pie plate I'd marinated it in, put it in the oven and 20 minutes later....perfectly delicious salmon. Rave reviews all around. Five stars for taste and simplicity.

A bit sweet. Next time I'd do less syrup. Added fresh ginger with garlic since I had some. Tried the horseradish as I person suggested but couldn't taste it. May or may not make again

I use this site every week for past like 6 years and I never leave reviews. I had to review this. This is SPECTACULAR!! Even my super picky "I only like corn dogs and pizza" 10 year old dug right in after much negotiations. Didn't change a thing, this will be in our permanent rotation

I used a wild caught salmon filet with the skin still on it, so I did not turn the fish during cooking. I cooked it skin side up, so that the fish would cook in the marinade vs. the skin. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, no black pepper (I don't like it), and real Vermont maple syrup. I placed the fish on foil in the baking dish for easier clean-up. The fish cooked just fine, but it was way too sweet for me. served with parsley brown rice, and dill carrots.

I made the recipe with a few minor adjustments. I substituted  low sodium tamari for the soy sauce , I eliminated the garlic salt and used one very large garlic clove.
Plus I cooked the salmon in an aluminum pouch and did not flip it; just cooked it for 20-25 minutes (25 mins for thick salmon filets).
Served the salmon with roasted garlic couscous & grilled yellow squash. Easy & delicious!

I followed recipe exactly except for adding a teaspoon of ground ginger to the marinade. Was done perfectly at 20 minutes and served over a bed of while wheat pasta and steamed broccoli. So healthy and restaurant quality. We all loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

I had a .88# piece of fresh salmon to make.   Unfortunately I didn't have the time to marinate, but the flavor was still fantastic.   I made as the recipe suggested other than using a couple extra cloves of garlic.  This is a keeper.

My father has a secret recipe for an amazing baked salmon which all who tried love and I'm alway trying to compete with it. I think I finally found a match! This salmon is so yummy and super easy to make, perfect for beginners or those who are unsure of how to season fish. If you love the taste of salty/sweetness and salmon this is the way to make it! I used regular salt and garlic, not garlic salt, less sodium soy sauce, and pure organic grade A dark maple syrup. Will be making this again for sure!

Amazing and the easiest dish I've ever made. I have served this to people who "don't like salmon" and they eat it up happily. No modifications necessary!

I made this for a family dinner and my niece quietly, politely paced the platter in front of her, keeping as much of it as possible (there were other protein options).  People who don't normally like seafood, love this dish.

The only variation I do to the marinade is add a little bit of ginger, probably a quarter teaspoon. It rounds out the flavor profile and cuts down the saltiness of the soy sauce. I make this dish all the time and is a constant crowd pleaser!!

Great taste! The maple syrup,  soy sauce  and other ingredients blend together well to create a mildly sweet flavor on the salmon.  Top with toasted sesame seeds for a little crunch.  Will definitely be making this again - soon!

I thought we had salmon in the fridge but it was Steelhead filet.   Two bites into it and my hubby said Wow, this is a definite keeper.   I followed the recipe as written except for the fish/  main ingredient.  Delicious!  Will try with Salmon next time.  I served it with sauted baby spinach and carrots.

Our favorite salmon recipe! It's now a weekly staple. For a little twist I added about a tablespoon of freshly chopped ginger in with the marinade and it gives it a great flavor.
Either way, we just love this.

So nice to do something different with salmon! My husband and I really enjoyed this marinade. Next time, I will use real maple syrup - I used a cheap brand, so the marinade was a bit runny and too sweet. I think real maple syrup would thicken it up and give it a better flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

Usually I like my salmon simple--butter, garlic, lemon, etc.--and if my kids are eating it too then I do a teriyaki marinade. But this time I wanted to try a simple marinade that I'd never done before.  Didn't disappoint! Very easy to make, and the kids loved it.

This was the most tender and delicious salmon I've ever made! The first time I made it, I cooked it right in the baking dish and the maple syrup became hardened at the bottom of the dish. It was a nightmare to clean up. Still delicious though. Now I marinate and cook the fish in tin foil. Tastes the same, but there is no clean up.

This turned out amazing! My husband absolutely loved it. The flavor is great! I marinade the salmon longer than what the recipe calls for.

I doubled the marinade recipe. (We like lots of sauce) Turned out fabulous. I have done a similar recipe with brown sugar, but the maple syrup adds a very nice flavor.

This is my go-to salmon dish when I'm having a gathering of people. Everyone always loves it and I love making it. Because I'm a pescatarian, I also make this just for myself and it is to die for :-). I like adding basil because I love basil, but with or without my additions, this dish is amazing.

The only change I made to the recipe is that I made the marinade as though I was making it for 4 people but only used the amount of fish necessary for two. This turned out really well. It had an almost teriyaki-like taste. I'm not a great cook without instructions, so I don't really see myself making any changes to the recipe in the future, but I really have no problem with that.

I want to explain......The recipe ingredients make a wonderful marinade/sauce.....except, I can't get it to stay on the fish.  Maple syrup is sticky..except on a cooking piece of salmon.  I have cooked it twice now, but I just can't get it to stay on the fish.  

The few parts that it did stick to....were amazing.

I added a little brown mustard to the marinade. Also, I cooked it for 10 min. covered, and 10 min. uncovered...then left under the broiler for 5 min to get crisp on the outside. But overall, the recipe was great!

Absolutely delicious!   Even 2 out of my 3 kids liked it . .  and that says a lot!   (one absolutely hates fish)  I took other reviewers suggestions and baked it in foil, then opened for the last 5 min or so and put under the broiler.  Also, I took someone's suggestion to bake at 450 degrees, 4-6 min per 0.5 in of thickness.  Mine was pretty thick, about 1.5 inches, so took a little longer.

This recipe is a keeper! Delicious. I saved a little of the marinade and drizzled it over the top halfway through cooking. I also cooked it for 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for. I should have sprayed the glass baking pan with PAM first. It was a little difficult cleaning the  baked on maple syrup.

I think if the sauce was doubled this would be much better. 

I don't bake salmon, I broil - and I feel that 15 minutes under the broiler on high (flipping once) would make amazing caramelized salmon.

Of note - I make my own salt free soy sauce and I used garlic powder in place of both garlic salt and fresh (the latter out of laziness ;) )

We love this recipe, even my super picky son. I have to leave out the soy sauce because of gluten, so I substituted balsamic vinegar and a little worcheshire sauce. I also broiled it for a couple minutes at the end.

So I marinated this more than 30 minutes, by mistake. It was delicious. "Professional chefs" can do it however they want. The important part is that I liked it. Let freedom (in the kitchen and elsewhere) reign!

I really liked this but removing 1 star as it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. I will make it again but just reduce the quantity of sugary maple syrup.

I followed the recipe as I usually do the first time, unless there is something objectionable, but that did not apply here.  The only thing I did differently was I let the Salmon marinate for an hour as my piece was pretty thick.  The flavor never did penetrate the fish, but turned out to be a very tasty glaze.  However, next time I will add a bit of ginger and a dash of cayenne (for my personal taste-the recipe is not lacking.)  The 20 min. cook-time was exactly right for my cut, as it came out tender, flaky,and just barely this side of pink.  It was so moist and delicious, with the addition of my 2 other fave ingreds., this could rival a $30. restaurant entree and one more star from me.  Next time, dear, next time.  Thanks so much for sharing; it was just what I was craving.

I enjoyed this quite a bit. I seasoned the salmon with kosher salt and black pepper before marinating it, and topped it with dried red pepper flakes before serving. I used fresh, skin-on Alaskan Salmon fillets (the skin ended up being soggy, but that was a technical purchasing mistake on my part, make sure to buy skinless fillets!). I served this with Jasmine Rice (with some leftover marinade spooned over it, topped with sesame seeds) and mixed frozen vegetables (with black pepper maple bacon bits mixed in) on the side. Overall, the salmon was really good! The balance between sweet and salty was perfect, I would recommend this dish!

Simple and delicious.  Negative reviews probably reflect a taste issue as opposed to a 'bad' recipe.  You must like sweet and savory to enjoy this dish.  We loved it and will make it often.  Only 4 ingredients!

This was so easy & it turned out so good!  The 2nd time I used some herbs and  citrus  spice  I had bought from Costco & it was perfect!  Either way it was really good,  even my DH who is a VERY picky eater said it turned out really tasty & I could use this recipe every time!

A bit sweet although I added a bit less syrup than the recipe required.  I think the taste relies on the quality of the fish.  I've learned not to buy one large piece, but two smaller pieces in case one just isn't up to par.     :  )------

Amazing salmon!  Always looking for new ways to cook salmon.  I think i ended my search.  I don't think I can find a better recipe.  Made it exactly as written, didn't change a thing.  Made this after work, on a week day, and it didn't take long at all.

This is the only salmon recipe I ever make anymore and we do have it regularly.  My husband and I both love it. I love the maple syrup/ soy sauce flavor. I do it exactly as written.

A quick idea that came together when I didn't have a plan.
Tasted great on seasoned brown rice and a nice garden salad on the side.  I used more soya sauce and less maple syrup, because it was real maple.  I also doubled the marinade so we could drizzle on the rice too.

I made this  recipe for a whole salmon for my brother's wedding.  This recipe is by far the simplest recipe I've ever followed. Due to its simplicity, I thought I'd add very subtle ingredients - namely the zest and juice of one lemon, plus  1tbsp grated ginger.  Excellent marinating tip to marinate in aluminum foil by the way! I baked the whole salmon (which was halved by the way) skin side up in the oven for half an hour. In the last 5 minutes, I tested the flake of the belly and saw that it could stand a few more minutes. So I shut off the oven and timed it for approximately 6 minutes. It came out perfect! I carefully drained the marinade to a sauce pan and boiled it and added gradually added cornstarch mixed with water to avoid clumps, to thicken the sauce. Upon serving, I flipped the fish onto its skin and garnished with chopped chives and drizzled the boiled marinade over the fish. It was exactly as I imagined it to be and it was delish! This is going to be a repeat dish in my home! Thank you Starflower!

I eat salmon quite frequently so am always on the lookout for salmon recipes. This was very good and a nice change from citrus recipes. I used local Door County, WI syrup!  Will absolutely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This was marvelous! I followed the directions and all the ingredients except that I did not have cardamon. But I looked up the substitution and followed what it said which was equal parts ground cinnamon powder and nutmeg. So the Cardamon ended up being 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon. I think next time I will go 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon because I thought the cinnamon was just a little overpowering. I also added some dried dill to the mixture. One other thing I did was that while the salmon was frying I went a head and added the rest of the liquid  mixture plus squeezed in a whole lemon. I just can't see eating any seafood without lemon. It was the best salmon I have ever cooked by far and I have tried very many different and various ways to cook salmon. I cooked a green beans recipe that also was amazing!  I believe it was called Ken-shoo green beans. I also cooked wild rice and in the rice I added dried dill  and zest a whole lemon Plus about a tablespoon of cilantro. The whole meal was D Lish!

I made this meal for my family of four and it worked great to just double the recipe. However I didn't have a glass pan to fit all the fillets so, I used metal and it stuck too much. It cooked well enough in the pan besides that.

I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to prepare my wife's favorite fish...salmon!

This recipe was a huge success.  The flavor is perfectly balanced and the crisp maple coating mixes so well with the tender, flaky salmon.

Will definitely be making this again.

This was delish! For our family I will definitely be adding some spice next time. I took the advice of others and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch after it was cooked. For those who haven't used cornstarch as a thickener you mix a little room temp water with cornstarch and stir till combined (which takes a few secs only) and pour the mix into the sauce and simmer. I didn't use garlic salt just fresh garlic. I also peeled the skin after the salmon was cooked and crisped it up under the broiler and it made amazing salmon skin.

This is possibly the easiest, really good recipe ever. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some freshly grated ginger, omitted the garlic salt, wrapped the salmon in aluminum foil, poured the marinade over it and left it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Then 20 minutes in a 400-degree oven, leaving it wrapped for the first ten minutes, then turning it over and leaving it unwrapped for the last ten. *So* good.

Wow!  This may have to go down in the book as my favorite way to cook salmon EVER.  I followed the recipe ALMOST verbatim except I cooked for 20 minutes on 450 instead of 400 since my salmon filets were a little thicker than normal.  Also, I didn't have garlic salt on hand so I used a little garlic powder and a little kosher salt.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Great recipe!

I would definitely make this again! The only detail I would change is the cook-time. On first try, I checked on it about 8 min before the end of the timer  and it was done. Love the simplicity and basic ingredients.

Everyone loved it. It was very quick and easy BUT you have to like it sweet. Served it with mashed potatoes which soaked up the sauce.

Was not my favorite. I love the  baked dijon salmon from this site, but did not have dijon. Next time I will run to the store instead of making a different one like tonight. Was expecting fabulous and just got ok, which was too bad because I used really good salmon direct from Alaska.

5 Stars!  Made as written without any changes.  Even though it has maple syrup in the marinade, it isn't too sweet.  The balance it right with the sweet and savory from the soy sauce.  My husband and I loved it!  It's good to have another preparation for salmon, we like to mix it up!  Try this one, you won't be sorry.

This was delicious and needs to be eaten just out of the oven because the fish will dry quickly.  I didn't use garlic salt because there is already fresh garlic in the recipe and I don't like salt.  Although, I did add garlic powder.  I will make this again, very good.  May try covering with tinfoil while cooking to keep moist.

It turned out wonderfully! I substituted Gluten Free Soy Sauce for the Soy Sauce and doubled the sauce recipe as we prefer sauces on our salmon... It was a hit even with the kid who doesn't typically like salmon.

I used pure maple syrup and this turned out great.  I have more than a pound of salmon but followed the recipe and the marinate to fish ratio was perfect!  This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe but I grilled it instead and IT WAS SO GOOD.  SO much easier and faster and perfectly cooked than the oven way.  I put it on the grill medium heat.. after 3 minutes I basted it with extra marinade; after three more minutes I flipped them over and basted them again.  It wasn't long after I flipped them that they were perfectly done.

I'm not normally much of a fan of salmon (eating it more for health reasons) but after making the simple marinade and tasting it, figured this one could be alright. I have to admit, I've already envisioned using the marinade for other things; it excites the taste buds.  The salmon  tasted good served this way as well. The recipe was saved and I'm sure I'll be making it again, not too far in the distant future.

I've made this twice now and both times it was amazing. The first time was made exactly per the recipe, the second I added some minced ginger and marinaded/baked it in tin foil followed by 5 min under the broiler to finish.

LOVE this recipe. My family devours it, and they all strongly dislike seafood. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try salmon for the first time, since the syrup does a great job at masking the "fishy" smells.

I made this for dinner, and doubled the marinade recipe because my salmon fillet was a large one.  It also gave me extra marinade to pour over the servings on our plates.  I made no changes to the recipe, and it was delicious.

This was great!

Followed the advice from others:
*Use REAL maple syrup
*Wrap each piece in aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes, broil for 5 min after.

Easy and delicious.  Will make it a regular recipe in the weeknight rotation!

Quick, easy and yummy. I followed the recipe, omitting the garlic salt, but increasing the minced garlic to 2 cloves. I followed others suggestions and cooked this in foil for the first 15 minutes, then broiled for 5. It was delicious. My husband and children all agreed. We will add this to our rotation!

I have made several attempts at making fish. I always find ways to screw it up or it tastes terrible. I read this and thought I would give it a try. OMG this was the best salmon I have ever had and there really is no way to screw it up very simple. If there were more stars I would check them all.

I love this salmon recipe. My boyfriend doesn't usually like fish but he always loves this one! The maple really helps flavor the salmon well and dulls any "fishy" taste. We like the combination of sweet and salty.

I hate any type of seafood and this salmon is amazing!!! when its almost done in the oven I take it out and add a bit of the sauce and the salmon fillets into a saucepan on high and let the sauce carmalize onto the fish on both sides. it gets nice and crispy on the outside and its perfectly tender on the inside!!! this is the only way I can eat fish and LOVE how it tastes. HIGHLY RECOMEND :)

My family loved this recipe - easy too!   I didn't have time to marinate the salmon, so I just poured it over the fish and  baked in tin foil.  At the end of the baking time, I open up the foil and broiled the top for a few minutes to caramelize the top.  I served this with risotto.  Delish!

Big hit at our house.  Someone wanted more "sauce",  so I had to explain that it was a marinade, not sauch.
Served it, as I usually do for fish, on a bed of rice with bok choi between.

Will definitely make again.

I loved it. I did follow some of the other users suggestions to place it in foil first. The didn't go well for me as I wasted a lot of the sauce but that's my own clumsiness not the recipes fault. Anyways it was a big hit and I am not a good cook so I was happy. My fish didn't "flake easily" but it was edible so I'll take it.

I used the general ingredients for the glaze but added my  own amounts of things, I like to experiment, but the best thing i did was add sweet peppers, Halved and cored. I added them while marinating and then used them to make some stuffed peppers and they were fantastic!

I or one am not a big fan of fish, so I used chicken breast instead. I also used a little less salt that the recipe calls for. Overall, it was one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten.

I made this exactly to the recipe.  It was ok, but seemed more a sauce on the outside of the salmon than a marinade that permeates the filet somewhat.

After trying this recipe (using everything exactly as told) I am always disappointed in restaurant maple salmon! Any maple salmon my husband has now, he always says "Yours is way better!" And I agree! This recipe is the best!

After marinating the salmon, I put in on a 500" grill (skin side down) for 10 minutes, lid closed. It was perfect. Moist and flavorful And sooo easy.

This was very easy and very tasty!
As other reviewers did, I left out the garlic salt and added chopped fresh ginger. It was delicious!
I was also fixing asparagus for the meal so I decided to try some of this marinate/glaze on them too. I put the trimmed asparagus spears in a shallow baking dish and spooned some of the marinate over them and roasted at 400Â° for about 10 minutes with the salmon. It was wonderful and I will be using this recipe again for both salmon and asparagus.

DELICIOUS! Simple, quick and as good as you'll get from a restaurant. Definitely a keeper. Now we just have to figure out side dishes that compliment it better.

This was phenomenal! I added a little fresh ginger with the marinade, but otherwise didn't change a thing. I first made it a couple weeks ago with the pecan rice from the site and have been dreaming about it ever since.

Terrific recipe! We don't change a thing and it is Delicious! My husband particularly notices a difference if you take the 30 minutes to marinate beforehand.  A family favorite, thank you!

I made this tonight. I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. I served it with riz pilaf made from scratch of course, and and side veggie. I also provided a couple of slices of fresh lemon in the event it was too sweet. It was gorgeous. I highly recommend it.

Not really a fan of fish however this came out great!! I had a question about what kind of soy sauce and maple syrup to use. If anyones wondering I ended up with Tamari gluten free soy sauce and Coombs Family Farms maple syrup.  Wich came out pretty great! Will absolutely make it again. Instead of 1 pound I had almost 2 pounds, i ended up putting just a tad bit more of both but until the end. Other wise as some of the other viewers it might have been too much sauce.

Love love love this dish! Easy and taste great. I have a 10 year old niece who hates to eat and try new dishes. Well she tried this one and it was a hit! Now I make it once a week. And FYI I don't even know how to cook.

Made for hubby's Valentines Dinner, he loved it . I will make this recipe many times over. For something so crazy good it too very little prep or cook time and rapid clean up. I followed other reviewers advice and wrapped in tinfoil, did not use garlic salt but did add some ginger which added to the aroma and the flavor of the dish. I served with Basmati Apricot Rice Pilaf, Broccoli and a Carrot recipe of my own that I reduce carrots in orange juice, a little onion, garlic, brown sugar and tarragon all to taste. It was a great hit and the rice went extremely well as a side.

Only change I made was to use garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  I marinated the salmon skin-side up for 25 minutes, then turned on the oven.  It took about 10 minutes for the oven to preheat, so my salmon marinated for about 35 minutes.  It only took about 12 minutes for my filets to cook.  I served them and drizzled some of the marinade over them.  Everyone loved it!  Quick, easy, healthy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Found the taste to be ok - I guess I am not a fan of sweet salmon. I've wrapped salmon in a tinfoil, and some of the sauce came out and got burned - probably because I've used a clay dish to bake it in..The salmon didn't taste burned, but I had to do a major cleanup afterwards.

One of my favorite salmon recipes!!! Very tasty and fast! However, I do cook it differently based on another recipe. I put two pieces of aluminum foil in a glass dish, place fillets in the aluminum foil, cover with marinade, and seal. I marinate for 20 minutes. Then, bake 35 to 45 minutes at 375 degrees (keeping fish in foil), until easily flaked with a fork.

It was delicious, the sweetness of the syrup was offset by the soy sauce.  This marinade is a really good complement to the natural flavor of the salmon.  I thought the fish came out a bit too well done for my liking, so next time I'll take it out a few minutes sooner.  I will definitely make this again, easy and very tasty.

This is a really nice alternative to our usual teriyaki salmon.   Of course using real maple syrup is a must, and the only change made was doubling the garlic since we're such big garlic fans.   Outstanding!

This is our go to recipe for salmon. Quick, simple, and delicious. We have also used the recipe on chicken and pork with the same great results.

I made the recipe as written and it was excellent!  I recommend tasting the marinade before pouring it on the fish,  I found it a little sweet for my taste when I did and added a little more soy sauce to it.  I think using foil instead is unnecessary and adds extra work.  I poured the excess sauce after baking over the salmon and it was plenty tasty.

GREAT dish for kids and adults. No spice at all here- and the sweetness can easily be controlled depending on how long you marinate and/or baste. Omitted garlic salt and pepper - didn't need it.

Simple, easy dish. A+

My Family loved this! I did not add the garlic salt, just a bit more garlic. I used low sodium soy also. I did wrap with foil while cooking and unwrapped it about 7 mins. before done. Even my picking 8 year old eat all off his plate!

This recipe was good, however I agree that the garlic does seem to compete a little. That being said, I used a little less than the recipe called for. You can also sub the maple syrup for honey. I like salmon with lemon and honey- simple but good classic flavors. It was fun to try with maple syrup though- very creative.

This is easy and tasty. A good recipe when you want to take a break from ground beef and chicken. My family doesn't usually like fish unless it's breaded and deep fried, but they like this.

My husband and son (who eat a lot of salmon) agreed this is the best salmon they've ever had.  I bumped up the heat to 450 for the last 5 minutes and basted it three times during the baking so the glaze got baked on well. It was incredibly easy and came out perfect.

I personally don't eat fish, but my husband does. I made the recipe exactly how it said, and my husband took one bite and ran to the bathroom to get sick. He said that maple syrup and salmon should NEVER.... EVER go together.

Needless to say I won't be making this again.
What a shame because  everything else I've made from allrecipes has turned out delicious.

This is an amazing recipe. I love making it for special occasions or when I'm trying to impress someone. 
I get really good maple syrup from a family friend and I never know what to do with it, so this recipe is pretty convenient for me too :)
 I always make extra sauce for the side, people like it on top of their veggies and sides. I usually make green beans or Brussels sprouts, and red potatoes.

Probably the easiest recipe I've ever found here. The flavor is pretty subtle but that's fine for Salmon. I'm definitely going to try it with ginger next time

Loved it! I tweaked it a bit and added some of my preferred spices. It was a hit and added shrimp too with the same marinade and pan fried it on the stove instead of baked.

So simple but delicious!  I make this once a week and always fantastic.  Sometimes I make an aluminum foil boat and uncover the salmon or ruby trout half way through cooking time.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

So good.  Didn't quite have 30 minutes to marinate it. I kept spooning sauce over it for about 15 minutes. Delicious.

I added a little bit more maple syrup than what the recipe calls for, and let me just say this: my brother, who hates salmon, loved this recipe. He ate 2 and a half fillets.

I make this for my family all the time, no changes to the original recipe. It's always a hit. We serve it with steamed rice (I pour a bit of the fish glaze over my rice) and a sesame ginger salad.

Not sure if marinating for 30 mins is long enough.  Doesn't have the flavor soaked all the way through.

Maple and soy sauce are such an unusual fit, but SO good!My friends and I grilled this instead of baking.  Those who don't care for salmon have never had really fresh salmon. Thanks. This is wonderful!

SOOOO Delish!! I made this for my husband's birthday dinner and it was like a gourmet meal paired with scalloped sweet potatoes and lemon garlic green beans. I didn't have any garlic salt for the marinade, so instead I added a dollop of dijon mustard and as per another reviewer's suggestion, about a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger. Perfection!

I made the recipe as written, except I didn't have a full pound of salmon. I'm terribly sad I didn't, as both of my children actually cried when I told them it was all gone! Seriously, it was that good!!

I did not make any changes to this recipe. I like it very much and I don't really care for salmon too much. My partner said it was just OK. He said that too much of the salmon flavor was covered up by the syrup.

Delicious recipe! I added an inch-long piece of fresh ginger, minced, to the marinade, and marinated the salmon in a gallon-sized freezer bag, turning the pieces halfway. I baked the fish with all of the marinade, in a baking dish covered with nonstick aluminum foil.

This was one of the best recipes that I have found on here!
My boyfriend is super picky when it comes to new food, and especially fish. He absolutely loved it!!!!
I used almost a pound and a half of salmon, just had to cook a little longer.
It was amazing! Will make more often!
Thanks

Without a shadow of doubt this was above and beyond 5 stars.  I would not hesitate to cook this for company even if they don't like salmon or maple syrup.  This recipe will make a believer out of all.  Amazing...

YUM!!!!!! This was so delicious, and easy and healthy to boot! I only had time to marinate it for 10 minutes and it was still incredibly moist and tasty. Oh, I always cook my salmon in a foil packet so that helped keep.  I served it over couscous with a side of sautÃ©ed kale.  Two of us easily polished off 1.25 pounds of salmon, so no  leftovers!

I have been making this recipe for about a year. It's very good when made as directed. However, I prefer to grill it over charcoal. (A basket is a must.) The quality of the salmon makes a big difference. Tonight we used wild king salmon, and it was worthy of a 5 star restaurant.

This just wasn't my bag.  I liked how easy it was, but the rest I didn't care for.  I'm from the Pacific northwest where salmon is our middle name.  With it that fresh, this recipe just didn't do the fatty pink jewel of the sea justice.  The timing on the cooking was for way too long.  It turned out super dry.  I like mine more on the rare side.  I think more like 6 to 9 minutes would have been better. My son enjoyed it though.  That's why I have it two stars.

This recipe is amazing, tastes amazing and super simple and easy.  I use real maple syrup, cheapest is at Trader Joes.  And I put the salmon and mixture in a plastic sealed baggie for a while (an hour) in the fridge skin side up the whole time, making sure all the meat is laying in the marinade.  

Other than that, I follow the recipe to a "t" and it is really super yummy.  

Must add, I live in the Pacific Northwest so the quality of the salmon is probably higher than in other areas.  Making this tonight with freshly caught Chinook from the Cascade Locks.

This is my husbands favorite meal. He asks for it often.  I make this as directed but add a coating of crushed/crumbled pecans or walnuts (whatever is to hand) on top of the fish just before cooking then spoon a little sauce over top of it. It adds a nice crunch and a little something extra. Worth trying if you are a nut lover like us!

Made twice in 1 week as written with farm-raised scottish salmon from a local fish market. Very easy and the glaze is awesome. Used organic dark maple, and tamari instead of soy. The only "not so positive" thing I can say is that we donât just love salmon, but we eat it because it's so good for you. Prepared this wayâ¦itâs about as good as itâs gonna get so 5 stars for the glaze, because that's what the recipe is all about!  Will try the foil method next time.

Don't be afraid of the seasonings in this recipe. All of the ingredients mix perfectly together, and not one of them over power the other. If you stick to the directions exactly as stated, you will have one of the best Salmon recipes ever. I doubled up on the ingredients for my 2 pound Salmon, but that's only common sense, and added 8 minutes.
(Bigger fish = more time) 
My review stands for the 1 pound Salmon as well.
Enjoy

The only thing I didn't have was the garlic... I used  a little bit of garlic powder instead. Still came out AMAZING. We are big salmon eaters here so I'm always looking for ways to change it up. The leftover sauce was used for chicken the next day. YUM!

Absolutely delicious!  Used the marinade recipe for 18 oz of salmon, which was perfect. Cooked in 20. Husband and I loved it. Was not too sweet, in my opinion.  Followed recipe exactly.

I would definitely make again and marinate longer.  The flavor is perfect it just wasn't enough flavor for me. Definitely take the skin off prior to marinating, I think it will soak the flavor up better.

Great recipe. I recommend doubling the ingredients if you make 2 or more big pieces like in my picture

This dish is easy and beautiful...no need to change a thing and a great meal to serve if someone is on the fence about liking fish. Perfect for a dinner party too...no mess, elegant, and presents nicely.

First of all, I MADE NO CHANGES.  This was good!  Super easy, too.  
I marinated mine in a large freezer bag to save room.

Super easy. Followed the suggestion to wrap the fish in tin foil and pour the sauce in. Even the kids gobbled it up. We got a bunch of sockeye in Seward- this will come in handy!

This is so easy to make and it was delicious.  My husband who is strictly a meat and potato person totally enjoyed the salmon!! Yay!!! I had some salmon left so the next day I made a salmon salad and added a bit of olive oil to the salad and it was tasty!!  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical in trying this salmon recipe but I'm glad I did. This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Ronnie

Got rave reviews on this recipe... served it for 12 people, However the amount of fish needed for that number turned out to be more than  what adjusted recipe said, ( 31/2 lbs) Fortunately I used over 4 pounds and only had a tad left over. At LEAST 1/3 lb  per person is a better rule of thumb!

Easy and delicious. The salmon came out perfectly cooked. I did cut down on the amount of maple syrup. Used 1/8 of a cup and then 1/8 cup of water. Also used reduced sodium soy sauce. Still tasted great to me.

WOW!!  Wonderful meal for the entire family!  The organic fish was moist & the organic maple syrup was YUMMY!  Quick & simple to make.  I served it with rice, broccoli & spinach.  No leftovers on this one.

My children LOVE this and it's the only salmon dish that my son will eat.  It's super easy.  I let it marinade over night and then just put in the oven.  I follow the recipe to the T.  I usually don't like sweet but even I think this is very good.

This is a great recipe.  Mix up the marinade, put the salmon in a zip lock bag, pour over the marinade, chill all day and grill for dinner.  What could be simpler!

We don't like salmon but loved this!  I recommend doubling the sauce so you can spoon some on top after it is finished cooking.  Fan-freakin'-tastic!

Fantastic recipe! I am not a great chef but I was able to fix a wonderful dinner for my family. I doubled the sauce so there would be more to drizzle onto salmon after it was cooked. I highly recommend that everyone try this!

Very easy, quick and delicious.  I used some garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and I didn't have time to marinate it and it still came out very yummy.  without marinating it is great for a quick weeknight dinner with some rice and a veggie.

Only complaint is that flavor was only on outside so I'm not sure if that's because I didn't marinate it long enough or what.  but dipping the salmon in the sauce was still good too! husband even liked it and didn't even know there was soy sauce in and he hates soy sauce.

Thank you for this recipe.  The beauty of this dish is that it lets the salmon's taste shine and you can't really screw it up if you follow the directions.  You can't really taste that it has maple syrup but you know there is a sweetness with the soy.  It's easy.  Use a very large plastic ziplock bag, dump in the ingredients, shake it, place the salmon in one piece at a time and turn them, then put in the fridge for 30 minutes.  My very picky teenager ate it (he hates when I cook) and asked if he could eat the rest of it - five more pieces and they were large - the answer was no because we have other people to feed.  I did add ginger but just a few swipes.  Did not add garlic salt as I didn't have it.   I doubled the recipe and it was more than enough for 3 1/2 pounds as it covered all the pieces well.  I lined a 1 1/2 inch baking pan with aluminum foil and put it into the preheated oven uncovered for 20 minutes, turned off the oven and left it in for 10 more minutes and then took it out to come to room temperature.  As a side to go with it I did a stir fry of king oyster mushrooms, a bunch of other asian mushrooms and asparagus, garlic and ginger.  Really worked well together.   I used farm raised salmon which is much, much milder than wild.  I wouldn't use it with wild salmon (the red one) as the flavors might compete.

Made this last night and was very disappointed. The sauce smelled great but the dish had very little flavor,  tasted almost like plain salmon. I had to whip up a tsaziki sauce to serve on it instead. Will not make again.

This is very simple, and pretty good, but not so good that I plan on making it again when there are so many other good salmon recipes on this site.  One thing I didn't realize was that this is very similar to teriyaki, and since my husband is not a teriyaki person he didn't really like it (just something to keep in mind).

I added panko flakes with parsley, a little black pepper, and garlic salt. I also made a sauce on the side for the salmon! Made with more maple syrup, black pepper, and garlic salt! Served it with a side of rice and tossed greens :)

This recipe was pretty good.  the flavor was good, but it didn't form a glaze over the top of the Salmon like I thought that it would.  It may have been something I did wrong?  I think I will try this again, and try putting it under the broiler for the last few minutes to see if that helps form a glaze.

I love this!! I am a seafood lover, but salmon is my all time favorite.  This recipe is amazing! I use 100% pure maple syrup, and garlic powder in place of all garlic as I usually do not have cloves around my tiny apartment.  LOVE this. :)

AMAZING!!!!!!! 

However I usually tipple the recipe ingredients so there is leftover glaze to drizzle on top of the fish and whatever I'm serving with it.

I was excited about trying this recipe because I love all the ingredients in it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the taste.  I did not like the maple flavor with the salmon and soy sauce at all.  In addition, in my opinion it needed lemon to tone down the sweetness and saltiness.  Next time I will return to honey and dijon, or just to lemon and garlic.

This was delicious. Hubby loved it.  I did use fresh garlic, and I did increase recipe and reduce half of recipe on stove while fish was cooking.  I also used the "foil method" and did broil a few minutes at end.  Be careful doing this though.  I got side-tracked sauteeing some veggies and the broiler did start to burn the sauce, but I got it out just in time.

What drew me to this recipe was what she said about her husband "not liking salmon" I'm with him, so I decided to try it. I loved it! It's definitely for someone who's not so fond of salmon. even the folks who like salmon liked it.

Wow!  So AMAZING!  It is delicious.  I pour a little bit of the marinade over the salmon before cooking it to give it a nice glaze.  The salmon is moist and the flavor is delicious!

Followed the recipe and loved it. I marinated it for about an hour. I always use double the marinade for any recipe because I like a lot of flavor and want to have enough to pour over the salmon while it's cooking. It was delicious and very easy!

This was pretty good.  I doubled all ingredients and quadrupled the garlic because we like garlic so much.  Great flavor and supper easy.  Cooking this with asparagus in the cookie sheet as well made this dinner ideal for easy cleanup.  I baked both salmon & asparagus 400Â° for 20 minutes, perfect outcome.

I increased the maple syrup from 1/4 to 1/2 cup because I had four long, thin pieces of Salmon. I also had better success with the 2 cloves of garlic and ground sea salt rather than the garlic salt. The girlfriend and I enjoyed this recipe very much! I will be making this again.

I love this salmon recipe. When I have guests over who I've cooked this for, they actually request it ahead of time. 
I use fresh Atlantic Salmon (never frozen), real maple syrup (from Costco), and Kikkoman soya sauce. Upon reading the negative reviews, I thought I would specify what ingredients might be making / breaking the dish for you. Everyone I have over loves it, and my picky toddler also scarfs it down. The sauce is amazing on rice too, mmm!

Okay to be honest, I tweak this recipe occasionally by adding toasted sesame seeds, sometimes I add in some minced scallions for a little color.  Whenever possible I use Grade B maple syrup for the more intense flavor, but this marinade is by far my favorite and I use it on more than just salmon.  It's an easy go-to recipe and tonight I'll make the fish on my grill instead of in the oven.

This has become my and my husband's favorite salmon recipe! The only thing I changed was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt to lower the sodium content/taste (and low-sodium soy sauce). This is the BEST!

Excellent recipe.  I've made this several times as written.  Marinate for 30 min. and bake at 400 degrees.  Very tasty - nothing else needs to be added to this recipe.

I made this tonight for a group dinner. Every wife and even the men asked for the recipe. I made a couple of adjustments. I used a pepper blend in place of black pepper, used garlic powder in place of garlic salt, and added Weber's roasted garlic and herb seasoning ( 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp) that's it.  I loved it and will be making it often as it is so simple to make.

Love the marinade and very simple to make.  Be sure not to over-cook the salmon (as I did the first time).

I'm going to try the same marinade on a pork chop tonight...

I added 2 tbs of Extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 tsp fresh grated ginger  as well as about a 1/4-1/2 tsp sesame seeds. I didn't marinade it due to lack of time, but wished I would have. the thinner parts of the fish were so yummy!

So delicious! I used 1.5:1 ratio of the glaze & broiled it for the last 10 mins or so. Next time I'll add some fresh ginger.

Everyone in my family loved it - and it was so simple to make!  I made one change, adding a tiny bit of horseradish as one reviewer suggested.  Absolutely delicious!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  The first time, I made the recipe with no changes and it was a huge hit with the whole family.  Since then, I've substituted agave for the maple syrup and it was just as delicious.  My son doesn't normally like salmon, but he absolutely loves this recipe.

The BEST salmon recipe I have ever had. Since finding this recipe I've made it almost every Wed night and my supremely picky kids devour it. It's even requested for their birthday dinners! The only "change" I make is doubling everything because 1 pound of Salmon doesn't get far in this house. :)

Wished I had made more!  I wish I had had some real maple syrup,so I used just used the regular maple syrup and it was still great.  I did use the rest of the marinade, to cook down into a glaze.It was perfect!

I liked this a lot.  Yes, it was sweet.  But as the poster mentioned, maple syrup is soooo yummy.  Which brings me to my first point: use REAL maple syrup.  Not the flavored high fructose corn syrup (lite or otherwise!) - when a recipe calls for maple syrup, it means the concentrated tree sap; don't substitute, it never turns out right.  I added 1/2 t horseradish as someone mentioned; it took away some of the sweet without adding a strong flavor.  I also took that extra marinade and threw it on my stove to boil for a few minutes.  Made the yummiest glaze.  The kids loved this.  In fact, I had a hard time stopping them from eating the marinade (before I added the salmon)!

Made this last night and my S/O and I loved it! The only thing I am going to change a little bit next time is the consistency of the maple glaze...We both wish it were thicker. The flavor was great though! I completely followed the recipe except for how long to cook it for. After reading other reviews I decided to bake it for 15 mins and then broil for about 3 mins (5 mins would've been too long). Will definitely make again and will use this marinade with other dishes as well!

This is now my secondary  favorite salmon recipe. It is to die for. I took one fellow chef-reviewer's suggestion by omitting the garlic salt and using ground ginger instead. I marinated it for 30 min., baked at 400 for 25 min. And it came out perfect.  I served it with Mediterreanean Summer Tomato Salad with French bread (you should try that recipe too which is also posted on this site under salads) and it was so good. It was very filling and satisfying. Thank you for posting! :-)

Great recipe and super easy. I've made this many times and it's foolproof. I always make 1 fillet just for me...I defrost frozen salmon from Costco. I use 1T soy sauce + 1T real maple syrup + black pepper + hot red pepper flakes and it's perfect. (I like spicy and have a garlic intolerance).  Wrapped in foil pouch and opened last 5 minutes as others suggested - perfectly cooked, loved the sauce over rice, and no clean up.  Delicious!  My only suggestion vs others who do last 5 minutes on broil - I don't broil with glass dishes. It's dangerous - they can explode as glass is not intended to go to 500 degrees. Safety first.

I really like this!  I didn't have salmon so I used alaskan whitefish which turned out great. After reading some reviews, I reduced the sauce to thicken and added some dijon for tang.  Will make again!

East & West agree, this is a keeper. I made this while my family hosted a Japanese visitor. I wanted something to please everyone's palate. We all enjoyed the meal. The fish was firm and flaked easily without being dried out. A very nice combination of flavors.

We loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe for our large family and had more like 2.5 lbs. salmon. I didn't increase the garlic, garlic salt or pepper. The taste was delicious, and was gobbled up in no time!

This recipe was outstanding!  Came out extremely well. My only issue is that I was expecting a little bit stronger flavor and maybe could use a little spice to it,  but thats it! I followed a few other reviewers recommendations. I double the sauce and used leftover sauce with some cornstarch and reduced. I will definitely do this one again.

I've made this twice. The second time I made it, I did not double the sauce and it cooked into a thicker glazy sauce which was WAY more tasty than the thinner sauce I got when I made it the first time.

Wonderful flavors, but the sauce was pretty runny. I used someone else's suggestion to make in foil packets. I'm not sure that made much of a difference. Next time, I might try to add a little corn starch to the sauce to get it to thicken.

Followed the exact recipe. We liked it and thought it was good, but didn't 'wow' us. Would make again because it's healthy and super easy.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe.  The second time I added some blacken season for just a little kick and wow.  I shared with a friend that also eats fish, her husband and son let her get one bite.

I recently just made this for my fiancÃ© and family. Everyone absolutely loved it! I used the soy sauce, maple syrup and garlic salt. I didn't have the clove garlic, so I left that part of the recipe out and it was just great regardless! I also used tinfoil as well to keep it more absorbed. And I bought frozen salmon. $9 bucks for 10 pieces instead of spending a fortune at the deli for just 1lb....was amazing! Will use this recipe again! Thank you so much!!!

I went to the Highland County Maple Festival this year and brought home some maple syrup. I searched around allrecipes.com for some recipes to use my syrup in and this salmon dish caught my eye. It's now my favorite way to prepare salmon. I prepare the fish as directed, then serve it with rice, red leaf lettuce, and a pickled Asian vegetable. Set out a bottle of Sriracha hot sauce (that's the stuff you see in Chinese restaurants). From their plate, diners lift a leaf of lettuce, add some rice to the top of it, put a bit of the salmon on the rice and roll it up. Add the pickled veggie to the roll, or just have it on the side. Add the hot sauce to the roll if adventuresome. Oh my yum!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to marinate the salmon in foil and just move it to the oven to bake in the same foil.  This is indeed a keeper.

made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! had some homemade maple syrup and took advantage. the maple syrup sounds like it will make the fish too sweet, but the soy and garlic balance it out nicely. i will definitely make this again.

Really easy and delicious recipe. I marinated the salmon for 2 hours turning it about every 30 min. 

Set some marinade aside for basting or dunking.

Also a yummy marinade for chicken...cook at 375 for approx. 40 minutes. Really good.

I left out the garlic and replaced with ginger in marinade for 30 min.  Kept it wrapped in foil with marinade while baking and broiled at the end to brown.  I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved, said it was as good as any salmon they had eaten.  I personally felt it was too soft and would not marinade for the full 30 min next time or would not bake with the marinade, one or the other but not both.  This is super easy and very good.

Wonderful, easy recipe as is.  No changes needed.  This is my go-to salmon recipe now.  It's so tasty for so little effort.  Great for dinner parties, too, because you'll have time to chat and mingle.

I LOVE this recipe, however I am only giving 4 stars because I have tried a few different times marinating it and it's always the best after 4-8 hours (YES HOURS) in the fridge soaking meat-side down in the marinade. I always serve it with rice with the leftover sauce spooned over top. Also, having tried it, I can say that using this on previously frozen, thawed salmon does NOT do it justice.

The glaze itself is amazing. I will be using in the future, however the fish still was over cooked even with warnings from other reviews- I only left it in the oven for 15 minutes. So I guess there is still a little experimenting for how long to leave it in the oven, but the mix of the syrup and soy sauce is genius!

Delicious!! The best salmom dish I have ever cooked and its very easy to make! I do not use oven as suggested, instead, I cooked it in a closed pan over a very small heat for 30 min or more (I dont remember exactly how long since I cooked this a month ago, but pretty much cooked until the sauce is soaked in the salmon or remains little in the pan).

I made this recipe for my husband and I and we both really enjoyed it! The combination of soy sauce mixed with the maple syrup gave it a great flavor! I also added in some spices like basil and oregano to give it a little more flavor. Delicious!

It tastes fabulous.  I substituted fresh ginger for the garlic salt. Soya sauce has enough salt.

This recipe is actually amazing. It's so simple and easy  and the salmon comes out perfectly. Although I did refrigerate it over night which I just read you're not supposed to do?

Turned out much better the second time around. 

Following the advice of other reviewers, I sprinkled ground ginger on top before baking, covered the salmon in foil in the oven, and removed the foil for a final 5 minutes of broiling.

This was an excellent dish. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the marinade and served it with roasted winter vegetables and a rice pilaf, which completed the salmon well. My roommate and I loved it but I think next time I might marinade it a bit longer, perhaps 40 minutes.

Wow was this good. I did read other reviews and the only thing we did differently was use foil. And we put the liquid in the foil as we baked the salmon. I must admit that I wasn't a big salmon fan thus trying this recipe since a reviewer had mentioned it wasn't traditional. I am more than happy I tried this. My children even had seconds. Now I have a reason to buy salmon. Thank you for sharing.

This is a family favourite! I have made the recipe numerous times. Sometimes exactly as is, and other times I've also added in some fresh ginger, either way it's great. The only thing I do differently is use sodium reduced soy sauce. Never any leftovers and my young children always ask for more.

Great recipe! Tried it for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it! I used 2 cloves of garlic and a bit more pepper to balance the sweetness of the maple syrup. I also used light soy sauce to make it less salty. Will definitely make this again, with the variations suggested!

I thought this was an excellent recipe with the perfect mix of salty and sweet. I used a 1.3 lb. mahi mahi filet instead of salmon. The cooking and marinating times were perfect. No leftovers!

Great recipe. It is basically teriyaki flavored when all is said and done. Dont use fake "maple" pancake syrup. Grade D real maple syrup works fine. 

I only marinated for like 5 minutes then used the excess sauce as a glaze. Didnt turn over. Baked for about 15 minutes then swapped to broiler like  someone else suggested for 3-5 minutes after spoonong over any sauce dripping. Came out awesomely.

I eat a lot of salmon and am always looking for a new recipe. This is a real winner! I made it only for myself, so adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I had wild sockeye salmon that I had bought  and froze. I thawed it and put it in a ziplock bag, skin up with the marinade. After reading the reviews I decided to add some fresh ginger since I had it on hand. Gave it a nice zing. I used real maple syrup, not pancake syrup. I used my Le Creuset fish skillet (which I was able to find brand new at a garage sale this summer for $4 and is the BEST pan I own.) When I preheated the oven, I put the skillet in and when the oven was ready I sprayed the skillet with cooking spray. When I lay the fish skin down it made the most wonderful sizzling sound. It was ready in 15 min.  In the meantime I reduced the marinade in a small pan on the stovetop and poured that over to serve it. Oh my, was that a treat! Thank you, Starflower!

We love salmon, but I was looking for a different way to prepare it. This recipe seemed easy, and I had all the ingredients onhand. I followed the recipe exactly as presented by starflower. My husband and I both loved it, and this recipe has become another one of our staple salmon recipes. The recipe is so simple, that it's an easy meal to prepare after a long day at the office.

I love this recipe. I have some Crown Royal Maple whiskey that my husband does not like to drink that I add to the recipe and it sends it over the top. Just add about 1/2 cup if you desire to the marinate. This is my favorite way to make salmon now.

Way too sweet for me. I felt like I was eating pancakes. I love salmon. This recipe would probably work for someone that doesn't like fish and wants to completely
 drown out the flavor of the fish.

Absolutely delicious! This has to be the best Salmon recipe I ever used... It would be great for a party it's so easy and fast, I served it with sauteed cabbage in a little olive oil and sea salt, and a cucumber salad of peeled sliced cucumbers with a little sea salt, sugar and a tbsp. or two of fresh lemon juice.... I did not have garlic salt, so I just added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a little sea salt.  Perfect! Next time I will also sprinkled sesame seeds on top, I think it might be real good too... This is a keeper!!!!

This is an extremely easy and delicious recipe.  I did not use the garlic salt as there is enough salt in the soya sauce.  My entire family loves it and I now use this as my regular "go-to" salmon dish.

This recipe is ridiculous - it is so good it actually made my kids LOVE salmon which they used to seriously despise. A few days after I made this recipe, (they practically licked their plates clean), we were passing the fish case at the supermarket. The silver brite salmon filets caught my middle son's eye. He stopped in his tracks mesmerized and muttered "Salmon?" Followed by a more excited "Is that Salmon?!" Then my other two joined in. "Where? Salmon?" They were all drawn to the case. Pressing their faces and palms against the glass all three were chanting "Saaalmon. Saaaalmon." It was an embarrassing proud moment - until a lady next to us said, "wow, they really like Salmon, huh?" Then it was just embarrassing. I cheated - I really didn't marinate, more like poured it on 5 min before cooking and then threw it on the grill. Ridiculously easy, ridiculously awesome. How the heck did you come up with this? Impressive! (Oh, the grown ups loved it too!)

This is an awesome recipe. I've made it several times and my husband has asked for it to go into our regular rotation of meals - which is HUGE because he's not a big salmon fan. I usually double the sauce, but I follow everything else to the letter. Just follow the recipe and you'll be very happy with a small amount of effort. What could be better?

I doubled the marinade so I would have some extra to make a sauce with. For some reason, the sauce was overly sweet. Not so the salmon, though - it was absolutely delicious, with a perfect balance of maple sweetness and savory soy sauce. 

I made three changes: I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, because that's what I had (the soy sauce is plenty salty, anyway); I baked the salmon in a covered casserole; and my salmon filet needed to cook about 25 minutes rather than 20.

Used 3 fillets, extra garlic, dash of ground ginger, didn't use the garlic salt, baked in a foil bag for 10 mins then broiled for a few minutes. We all loved it! This recipe is a keeper and I'm going to make it often.

I really do love salmon this way.  I add way more cracked Pepper than it calls for right before it goes in the oven and it gives it a bit more of a bite. This is also great done on a cedar plank.

The fish was delicious and this recipe was so simple.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I baked the fresh (Atlantic) salmon in a foil pouch for 18 minutes at 375.  The fish was extremely moist.

Much better if you drop the garlic salt and add just a little more actual garlic. I also marinade the fish longer than 30 minutes; if the filet is more than 1 inch thick, it needs the extra time and it *definitely* needs to be turned over halfway through.

This was good!  I of course made some modifications.  I used Garlic Powder instead of garlic salt.  The soy Sauce supplies more than enough salt!  The dry herbs I rubbed into the fish and used a little paprika. I have also used blackened season blend from whole foods (just a little).  I baked it in the oven for 20 min then let it sit in the oven for an extra 10 mins letting the remaining heat in the oven crust the salmon nicely!

This is literally the only salmon recipe my boyfriend and I like.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I added a tablespoon of horseradish.  It's completely delicious.  Any tips on getting the skin nice and crispy though?

Followed recipe exactly, except used sides of a chunk of salmon. It's very good, but I think it needs to be marinated longer to get a stronger maple taste. Served with a green salad and corn on the cob.

I have made several salmon recipes, but I always come back to this one. I keep trying new things and my boyfriend always asks when we are going to have maple salmon again. And he doesn't even really like fish, so thank you for sharing because we love this recipe.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at dinner tonight! It was super simple, the marinade was delicious. I cooked the salmon in a glass dish at 375 degrees and only cooked it for about 15-16 minutes. It was awesome!

This has become one of my favorite salmon recipes. I add a little grated ginger and leave out the garlic and garlic salt because I don't want to overpower the salmon with too many contrasting flavors. Overall though it's a simple and delicious recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Did not change a thing! Husband raved about it!I did use low sodium soy sauce to cut down on some of the salt.

Tried this recipe tonight and delish with a few tweeks: added 1 to 2 tsp fresh grated ginger, 1 tsp of horseradish and a sprig of dill.  Marinated in aluminum foil for 15 minutes and baked slightly covered for 30 minutes and opened for a 5 minute broil to crisp the top.  This is a keeper to be made again and again!

We love this recipe especially my husband who is not crazy about fish...I do use bit more chopped garlic and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, no need for salt with the soy sauce..since my husband is a diabetic, I use the light maple syrup or sugar free and I can't tell the difference when cooked.

WOW! I mean COMPANY'S COMMIN' WOW!  Great just as written (use REAL Maple Syrup). Super easy and SUPER delicious!  I served it with Saffron rice and mixed veggies.  Cheddar Bay Biscuits (on this site) would be a great sub for rice.  Hubby said skip veggies and serve with a salad beforehand.  I agree; the salmon is too bright a star to share the stage with anything other than a nice starch.  Thanks Starflower!

Very flavorful and moist. My son asks for this constantly, and there are NEVER leftovers. Generally I marinate the fish for 4+ hours, then cook the fish in the marinade according to directions. I don't bother wrapping the fish in foil as most users recommend (I am lazy & impatient), and it is a no-fail recipe. Definitely an easy weeknight dinner if you have the ingredients on hand (I generally do). Thanks Starflower!

GREAT baked salmon recipe.  
Minor changes made this dish exactly what we were looking for:
Agave Nectar instead of maple syrup
Garlic powder instead of garlic salt (soy sauce has enough saltiness & sodium)
We had to bake ours for 25 mins as our filets were a bit thicker & needed the extra time.

Will be making again!

This has become a family favorite for us. This recipe has all the things we love, sweet, salty and garlic all rolled into one. I always feel like there is too little marinade so I double the sauce, and heat the leftover on the stove to make a sauce. My favorite side item with this is steamed carrots. Yum!

So delicious and absolutely amazing. I let it marinate overnight and then saved some of the marinade to pour on top after it was done cooking. Will definitely make again.

I added a tablespoon of white flour and whisked it into the marinade.  This made the marinade thick and helped it stick to the fish. Amazing

Love this recipe! I make it at least twice a month. I cut up green onions and sprinkle them on top with some sesame seeds before serving.

This was very good! The fish was wonderfully moist with just the right amount of maple sweetness. A keeper for sure.

I made this last night and it was AMAZING!  Didn't change a thing, except I made a litte extra marinade.  When it was ready for the oven I did as another suggested and poured some of it off into a saucepan, added a little corn starch to thicken and drizzled this on when it came out.  Wow, was this a hit.  I usually plank salmon on the grill after a brief marinade and my husband doesn't like salmon.  Last night he was absolutely raving and says next time we have guests this is what he wants me to make!  Who would'a thunk-maple syrup, soy sauce, and garlic!  I'm going to adapt that for other things!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! It's quick and easy (I don't bother marinating the salmon), and has become a staple dish for those nights when I get home late and don't know what to cook. Thanks!

My boyfriend's #2 favorite of the recipes I've found. The salmon always comes out moist, and the maple with soy sauce is a beautiful combo with the salmon. We absolutely love it! 
As a side, it's very good with asparagus or even rice to soak up the juice >.

25 year old Daughter has requested this for her birthday dinner.  Typically she is not a fish lover, but she loves this dish!  Grill not bake, and may top with shaved almonds and serve with fresh grilled vegies.

My kids actually ask for this. It is so easy and delicious. You will not be disappointed. We always indulge and use wild caught salmon for this. "It's like butter," my son said tonight. Thank you, Starflower!

Delish! I cooked my salmon for 20 minutes and took the foil off for the last 5, spooned some of the sauce over the top after it came out and it was perfect.

This was a big hit today at lunch. I made few modifications though, I exchanged the maple syrup with 1 tablespoon of honey and squeezed one lemon and omitted the fresh garlic. It was easy and even baking it in the oven was quite simple without aluminium foil, you just have to adjust the time right, it took around 15-20 minutes in the oven. My husband and me agreed that the meal was a gourmet.

My family loved this salmon recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My sons (ages 5 and 8 yrs old) ate everything on their plates ;)  Very easy and quick to prepare and so delicious!  I served the salmon with brown rice and sauteed spinach. I'll definitely make this again.  Thank you "Starflower" for a wonderful and healthy recipe!

I doubled the sauce ingredients and pan fried instead of baking.  This turned out great!  Served it with rice.  My family is VERY picky about fish recipes and this one was a hit!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

It was a rave, the down turn was, I used brown sugar rubbed the slamon, not enough soy sauce.
Lost count of the minutes and the brown sugar burn, on the shallow glasss baking dis, the slamon did not come out that bad.

this was very tasty and fast.  I made 2 versions of the recipe because my husband can't have any sodium.  version 1: omitted the garlic salt and soy sauce, used extra garlic.  version 2: substituted extra garlic and kosher salt for the garlic salt.  both versions were fabulous.

This was ok.  Nothing overly spectacular in my house.  My kids didn't like it.  Will try something else next time.  Was good to use up some maple syrup though.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  I followed others' recommendations and marinated/cooked the salmon in foil for about 30 minutes and omitted the garlic salt.

This was okay for us but I like other salmon recipes better.  Followed recipe to a T ... I would have liked more soy sauce in the marinade.

I made this recipe as written.  I had a little over 2 lbs of salmon so I just doubled it and set aside a little of the marinade to brush over the salmon after it was cooked.  This is my favorite recipe.  It turned out perfect and I couldn't seem to eat it fast enough.  I will be making this again!

Really loved this recipe! I knew I would.  I added about 2 tsp. of chopped scallions.  I also had some fresh cut pineapple on hand and added that too. What a great flavor combo. I will definitely add this dish to our dinner rotation.

This was a wonderful surprise in my mouth! The sweetness of the fish was so great of a twist compared to the normal salty, fishy flavor. I did not bake it but broiled it for 3 mins on each side. It came out so juicy and tender. I also skinned it and broiled it on the side, nice and crunchy! This will become a regular at our house my husband said who does not like fish. With roasted carrots and wild rice I felt like a queen.

Followed the directions and took one reviewers advise to add some fresh Ginger. They whole family liked it.
Next time I think I'll lower the temperature or the cooking time. It came out slightly over cooked for the size of salmon I had. ( 1.37lb. fillet)

My fiancee and I love salmon and have tried many different recipes from this website.  This one is BY FAR our favorite of all of them. To be honest, when I first saw that you are combining maple syrup and soy sauce I was a bit skeptical, but after making this several times I can say they balance each other out quite nicely and really bring out some good flavors in the salmon.  Highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

This was great!  Only thing I changed was to double the garlic and cut out the garlic salt.  When I cooked it, I basted the salmon with the marinade every 10 minutes.  Delicious!

4.5 actually.  Baked 18 minutes basting every 5.  Broiled 3 minutes.  ( But my salmon was still a little frozen in the middle when I started baking.)

The sauce was very good and created a glaze over the salmon, it would of gotten five stars if I was a bigger fan of salmon and if the sauce was a bit stronger. But good overall.

THIS WAS THE BEST SALMON I'VE EVER HAD!!! Thank you so much for it! Btw, my husband thought it would be good with cinnamon. So I added a pinch to the marinade and it tasted even better! Try it :)

I thought for sure there would be leftovers with the amount of salmon we used to make this.  There wasn't.  Everyone loved it, and had seconds (and thirds).

With my husband recently put on a healthier diet, we've been eating a LOT of fish, especially salmon as of late.  I've been getting pretty sick of salmon, and decided to give this recipe a try. Now, I can't get enough salmon! This recipe is easily one of my favourites I have tried on allrecipes.  Amazing!

Delicious, light, and healthy.  Added ground red pepper to the glaze to balance the sweet of the maple.  I will definitely make this one again.  And again.....

This is my family's favorite salmon recipe. I have on occasion used regular syrup if I didn't have any maple syrup and it turns out just as fabulous!

I am an Alaskan and every winter my freezer is full of salmon. We were bored with my usual dill and italian dressing or Yoshida's recipes so I tried this out. I thought it was delicate and delicious and simple. Thank you Starflower.

So incredibly good! Added ginger paste, omitted garlic salt for ground garlic.  Retained some mixture for drizzling on the finished salmon. Yum yum yum!

This is a great recipe and my family loved it!  I would never use anything but the real maple syrup.  My husband found a great website that delivers the best maple syrup we have ever tasted all over North America, to all those who are interested, the website is www.maplexport.weebly.com

I tried this glaze lastnigt and I found it to be alright. It was sweet (which is what I was going for), but there was a tangy/salty after taste that I believe was brought on by the soy sauce. I'm open to trying this recipe again. Next time I think I'll either do 1/2 or 1 tablespoon of soy sauce or just omit it all together.

Loved the sweet and savory mix. Made the marinade just as directed, but ended up adding butter because the salmon we have tends to be a little dry. That made it perfect, and I will definitely make this again. I try to eat Paleo, and this was a great addition to my recipe repertoire!

I cooked this without marinating it first, added green onions and a little ginger and my family went crazy for it!  We really loved this and it was so easy to prepare, with things you likely have in your kitchen already.

WONDERFUL. I was unsure about the mix of ingredients when I made the marinade, but it came out absolutely delicious. The only modification I made was using a little extra garlic, b/c I love it and can't get enough. My only issue was that the salmon was not nearly done after 20 minutes - 30 was closer to the mark - but I assume that's more about variations between ovens.

Absolutely delicious, and very easy to make.  Both my 15 & 20 year old boys also love it.  They never cared for salmon before, now they are always asking me to make it.  Thanks for posting!

We've made this several times now. Wonderful. It's the best salmon I've ever had. Our 'cook' uses genuine Vermont maple syrup and adds about a scant tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger root to the marinade and grills the salmon. We will try the oven method this winter.

This recipe is fantastic!  So easy and the end result is phenomenal!  I doubled the ingredients for the marinade and used the excess to spoon over rice.  Served with steamed asparagus or spinach...sooo delicious!

We really enjoyed this meal. I did it exactly how the recipe said.  I wish I would of tried to bake it in foil for the first 15 minutes, so it would of had a little more flavor.

Absolutely wonderful and easy.  My 16 and 14 year old's LOVE IT!!!  I put garlic mashed potatoes, then garlic spinach, then the salmon on top.  It looks and tastes like it came straight from a professional!

Delicious - garlic salt not needed! Add either some fresh grated ginger or use teriyaki sauce instead of soy. I used low-sodium and it was fine.

Love the recipe.  I did add some mustard powder and used low sodium soy sauce.  Smelled awesome while cooking.   I also drained the marinade and heated up to drizzle on the fish after plating.  After eating it, my husband said he was going right down tomorrow and picking up some more salmon.  This is going in our rotation for salmon since we do eat it quite often.

Simple recipe and great flavor.  Great for a busy mom.  
I take leftovers to work (no salmon doesn't smell when you don't warm it for a long time!) along with one of the minute brown rice cups.  I flake the salmon and mix with the brown rice.  Simple and good.

It was too sweet for me and my husband. I would reduce the maple syrup and soy sauce or salt. Overall, it was good. I cooked it in foil for 15 minutes, then open it under broil for 4 minutes as indicated in one of the reviews. However, I felt the flavor of the salmon was surpress by the maple syrup and soy sauce.

Easy and excellent.  Omitted garlic salt.  Simmered marinade on stove top while salmon baked to use as a glaze when done.  Salmon finished up with a nice outer coating and color even without broiling.

Really delicious flavors. I baked it on a bed of julienned carrots and they added even more sweetness and some crunch. This is now a staple at our place. Beautiful!

If you're just starting to cook, and want to impress a girl (my wife) or whatever, do this with MSLILLY's "Superfast Asparagus".  Wicked easy to make and tastes complicated and AWESOME!

Amazing!   First off, I'm not a fish lover - don't like the "fishy" taste.  I have never cooked Salmon until tonight.   This marinade was delicious.  The salmon was tender and very flavorful.  So much so that my 3 year old ate it for dinner!! 
Thank you for such a great fish experience ..will make this again and again

Super recipe, I've made this many times.  The only thing I've done differently is add a tablespoon or so of soft honey to the marinate.

Excellent!  So savory.  The only change I made was to use a combination of red & black pepper for a bit more kick.  This is a real winner!!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I tend to find salmon to taste too fishy for me and have tried many ways of cooking it.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!  Thank you.

Made exactly as it said and it turned out great! So incredibly juicy, great flavor, and make sure to use the real maple syrup...none of that junky stuff that sits in the pantry!

This is a delicious and easy recipe for salmon. The maple and soy sauce are so good together.  I will use this again.

I have made this dish three times and it has turned out perfectly everytime.  My husband and I are not huge fish eaters, but we do not hesitate when this is served.  I have not had cloves of garlic on hand, so I add a tsp of garlic powder which seems to taste great.  I would highly recommend this recipe!  It is so easy :)

Best Salmon recipe ever and so easy to make.  It is also great served cold the next day.  I usually add it to my salad with  very little dressing since the salmon flavors the whole salad if you toss it in with the greens before eating.

Delicious and incredibly easy.  I made two variations, simply because I didn't have the ingredients called for:  Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, and plain salt instead of garlic salt.  Still came out just fantastic.  The marinade cooks down into a tasty glaze to spoon over the salmon.

The whole family loved it! I didn't have time to marinate it so I cooked the salmon wrapped in foil with the sauce, as a previous review suggested. I thickened the juices after cooking, and it worked great. This will definitely be added to our fish night repertoire.

The soy amount as it over pours the dish.

I made the maple salmon for dinner last night and it was a huge hit.  My daughter often complains about the salmon being dry and this time asked why I didn't make more.  I did substitute garlic powder instead of garlic salt and minced garlic (about a teaspoon of garlic powder) and then just baked it in the dish with the marinade and basted it several times during cooking.  It was marvelous!

The Best Salmon I've Ever Had!
Its hard for me to order salmon out because it doesn't compare with  what this recipe brings to the salmon. I make it at least twice a month if not more. Even my husband loves it who is very hard to please. 
I even make it as an entree during gatherings and people rave about it. Thank you for sharing this.

I used the foil idea and baked for 15 minutes in the marinade inside a packet of heavy-duty foil.  I put the marinade in a pan and added dijon mustard to taste and made an amazing sauce.  Did not add any cornstarch.  I broiled skin side up since my 7-yr-old loves crispy salmon skin!  This was very tasty!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe to use.  Didn't have any garlic salt so just used 1/8 tsp of garlic powder with 1/8 tsp of salt.  Rather than putting it in the over we BBQ it and it was tasty.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Yummy! Made this for hubby and myself on valentines day, it was great :D very simple, great balance of flavor. I did not use the garlic (or garlic salt--the soy sauce had plenty sodium) the only other thing I will change next time I make it is to reduce the sauce, it was delicious & we both wanted more of it on the salmon, although it was even yummy when it accidentally got in the mashed potatoes on our plates. I highly recommend this recipe, I even liked it better than the maple cherry salmon I've had at red lobster (which is really good)!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic.  I cooked at 350 for 22minutes.  I could have gone 20 minutes on it and it would have been fine.  The filets were about 1.5 inches wide and an inch thick at the tallest point.

I love this recipe.  Adding fresh grated ginger makes it even all the better.  My sister is an extremely picky eater and hates fish....she had 3 servings of this!  It is one of my favorite recipes to cook!  Thank you.

I've made this twice and love it.  I grilled it for 1  minute flesh down to get some nice grill lines and then I turned it skin side down over indirect heat until it was done.  1 lb was closer to 3 servings with a side dish, not 4.  I've marinated it for just an hour and that worked, but I think 2 or more is better.

This is delicious! I pour the sauce in a saute pan and reduce it down after the salmon is done cooking and then pour it back over the salmon before serving.

Scrumptious and simple. Like others, I wrapped it in foil for 15 minutes and then broiled on low after opening the foil for another 5 or so. Mmmmm mmmm

I used this recipe for my family of four and everyone raved! I adapted this recipe a few days later to use with chicken, and again everyone raved! You can substitute Agave nectar for the maple syrup for a slightly different flavor profile, using the same measurements. I continue to tinker with it, changing a little here and a little there to suit whatever meat I'm using at the time. Try it out! I highly recommend this one!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious.  I love that it requires a short time for marinating.  Three reasons this has now become my new favorite way to cook salmon!  Delicious, simple and flavorful!  Thanks for sharing.

Even my kids, who don't usually like the strong taste of salmon, liked it.  Cooking it on the grill added a nice flavor.  Delicious and easy.

This was really yummy! I love the glaze. Not too sweet as long as you dont put too much extra sauce on it when its done. This was the first fish dish I ever cooked (excluding fish tacos and shrimp) and it was super easy and delish for a begining fish-cooker! Thank you !!

Amazing!  I made the recipe as is, but my husband grilled the salmon.  He also basted some of the marinade on it when cooking it on the grill and got them to a perfect glaze while the rest of the fish flaked.  Even my mom who doesn't eat salmon had seconds!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a salmon recipe and decided to try this. It was excellent and very easy!  I took the advice of a few people and marinated the salmon in heavy duty aluminum foil and then baked/broiled it in the same foil.  My boyfriend couldn't eat enough of it. I was suprised there was any left for me.

YUMM!!!! This is absolutely delicious. Do NOT change a thing about this recipe. 
This would also be delicious if it was smoked instead of baked in the oven. 
10 stars!!

Salmon is not my favorite fish, but this is a pretty good and flavorful way to cook it if looking to add more salmon to your diet.

We tried this recipe and found that we should have omitted the maple syrup and in place used brown sugar and mustard with horseradish.  Did not use salt because the soy sauce,  low sodium type has enough salt. We will make this again with the above modifications.

I found this recipe and tried it out with the family.  Amazing is all I can say.  I did take out some of the marinate before baking.  Came out perfect.  My wife was asking "what is in this?" ... ha .  I used good maple syrup and did add a bit of ginger.  This is one for the Recipe Box and will be done again!  Thanks for submitting this.

This recipe is amazingly good! My husband bought me a plank of salmon as a treat (he hates fish, so I don't get to eat it that often) and I had originally planned on grilling it. However, it was cold and rainy that day and so I went in search of another idea and found this. It was so simple! I used garlic power as I didn't have any cloves on hand. I also wrapped mine in foil as some other users had suggested, and it made for an overly simple clean-up. I didn't get the crispy top others did, but I'll play with it and try for next time. Since I was the only one eating, I had leftovers, and they seemed even better the next day. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was sensational! This was my first attempt at Salmon, and I have to say this recipe was very simple and quick. it is very savory, the soy sauce and the maple syrup are a perfect combination. We've made this several times and it comes out perfect every time.

Okay, I finally made this dish for mother's day yesterday and my wife had a black eating this dish. I changed absolutely nothing about this dish what so ever about this dish and I was completely blow away with the flavor of this fish. I made with some alfredo and some asparagus and it was tryly amazing to say the least. I would rate this a 10 if I could Wonderful recipe.

this is a good recipe. I made this a few times. My wife loves it.  I also suggest marinating the Salmon fillets in milk for 10 min., take a cup of seasoned or unseasoned bread crumbs.  Add smokehouse maple seasoning to the bread crumbs, Season to taste. I use a table spoon to one cup of bread crumbs. Take one egg and beat the egg until frothy, Dip the salmon fillet in the egg and dredge it through the bread crumbs. Bake as the recipe calls for . While the salmon is baking, mix some mustard with the maple syrup. Add  1/4 cup  of syrup to two table spoons of mustard.   Also add 1/4 cup of melted butter.
Or mix to taste. Home made honey mustard works well too. When salmon is done drizzle the mustard sauce over the fillets.

A lot of people said this was too sweet, but I couldn't taste the marinade at all.  plus after twenty minutes of cooking, it was still raw.  i had to put it back in for another ten.

Delicious! I added one chopped scallion and it looked beautiful. I followed other reviewers' advice and wrapped the salmon in tin foil and poured the marinade over the salmon. It marinated while my oven was pre-heating. After baking for 20 min, I basted the salmon then turned on the broiler for 2-3 minutes. So delicious, I know I will be making this over and over!

I added 1/4 cup orange juice to it to give it kind of a citrus taste and did everything else exactly like the recipe says.  It came out VERY good.  THEN while the fish was baking, I used the marinade and put shrimp in it and then cooked the shrimp like a stir fry.  Those came out really awesome as well.

Oh my goodness!  This is so delicious!  I'm a big fan of simple dishes, and this was most certainly simple but resulted in an incredibly flavorful salmon!  I did everything exactly as stated in the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely be making this again!

It was definitely tasty, though I'm not certain that it's the absolute best way to prepare salmon...I will definitely make it again - especially if I have company that likes a sweet dinner

This recipe is a family favorite anymore. It works equally well with Tilapia.  I do prefer to use heavy soy sauce and it makes a richer flavor. I will also add Chinese pepper sauce for a change every so often.

This was very good - I wasn't so sure I would like something sweet with salmon, so I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to give it a little bit more of a savory edge. I also used lite soy sauce (personal preference).  Nice blend of flavors!

FANTASTIC! I took another person's advice and wrapped the fish individually in foil to seal in the flavor. My whole family loved this!

I have 2 picky eaters in the family...and this was one of their favorite meals EVER!!!  My husbands exact words were "this is the best meal you have ever made", and he doesn't really like fish.  I don't think anyone can go wrong with this recipe!

Love it! This is the only salmon recipe that I ever make now.  It takes away any fishy taste that salmon sometimes gets.  I usually make a little extra marinade and pour it over the salmon after it's cooked.

OMG!! I LOVE this recipe!! First off, I could eat salmon everyday of the week, but made this way it is absolutely delicious!! The only changes I made were additional garlic (I love garlic) and sea salt instead of the garlic salt. I did have to cook it for 30 minutes instead of 20- but it was a thicker slice of salmon. This is a new favorite in my house and I will be making it often!

Wow! This salmon is awesome. Normally I hate fish but made this way it is delicious. My 2 and 4 year olds also ate it right up. Definitely add fresh ginger to help give it that little bit extra "oomph" and help offset the sweetness of the syrup. I'm adding this to my regular menu. Thanks!

I made this for the first time last night, but had no time to marinate - it went straight to the oven. At 10 mins I flipped the salmon and basted with the sauce. It smelled delicious while baking, and guess what ? It was delicious, in fact it got a big thumbs up from my boyfriend, who knows how to cook! Definately something I will make again.

This was great.  I only marinaded the salmon for a few minutes, so I basted it with the mixture a couple times while baking.  Wonderful flavor!

Great recipe! I did as others recommended and both marinaded and cooked the salmon in a foil packet.  I flipped the fish over halfway through cooking and opened the foil for the last 5 minutes. turned out great!!

I am a very picky eaters. I don't ever touch fish unless it came in a box ready to microwave.

This dish was so easy to prepare and tasted so delicious.

I did add a lot of honey to it as well as a lot more maple syrup. 

Yum. I ate every bite. I will make this again. Soon.

Extremely good, restaurant quality taste.  I added a 1/4 tsp chili powder and an extra garlic clove to the mix.  The results were absolutely above my expectations.  I like fish, but limited to pan fried, deep fried and sushi; so to try a somewhat healthy baked fish dish along with cauliflower rice and garlic asparagus, I walked away from this meal very satisfied and without any guilt.  I used the leftover sauce and spooned it on top of the salmon.  This will stay in the rotation.

I also skipped the galic salt-I prefer less salt, and the soy sauce was plenty.  The taste was just right, not too much of anything, and not overpowering the fish itself.  Yum!  I had fairly thin tail sections, so they were almost submerged in the marinade (perfect!) and cooked fairly quickly.

Thank you! This is an amazing recipe! Followed exactly as described.  But, did adjust cook time based on thickness of the Salmon as someone else had previously suggested.

AMAZING RECIPE!!!! I loved it on my first try. I made only two changes: I added a small amount of organic extra virgin olive oil and also some organic fresh ginger. I will definitely make this for guests.

i used organic syrup and instead of a clove of garlic- i used granulated, and skipped the garlic salt.  

totally radical.  i highly recommend this recipe.

I have never made salmon before now.  I only ordered it in restaurants because I was afraid to make it at home and always thought salmon tasted fishy compared to other fish.  Now I know it just needs to be super fresh and that you need to remove the gray matter on the bottom after cooking.  That is what tastes fishy as it is part of the skin.  This was easy, elegant and excellent tasting.  I followed other suggestions and marinated and baked in a foil pouch then opened it at the top for the last 5 minutes under the broiler.  I didn't make any changes but I did use pure maple syrup from Vermont which is thicker and richer and I think it gave it a thicker sauce and broiled nicely with a crispy top. Thank you for the great recipe.

Very moist and tasty.  Maybe just a little bit too sweet, but a sprinkle of salt and lime juice took care of that.

I am not sure why but fat bubbles came out onto the surface so it looked somewhat less appetizing. Otherwise, it tasted so good! Thanks for the recipe!

I stuck to the recipe and it was yummy! 
I guess I baked it for 20 minutes, which was a bit longer than it needed, so it was a bit hardened... but love the sweet but not too sweet taste of it.

I love this salmon and make it all the time.  I marinade it overnight for deeper taste.  I make a sauce on the side of the syrup mixed with a bit of soy.  I brush this over the salmon and serve it on the side for dipping. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!

This was too sweet for me also.  My favorite simple
salmon recipe is to spread with dijon mustard, 
sprinkle with dill & bake - I like savory vs 
sweet.

I found it a little too sweet for my taste. My 6 year old who loves my usually salt&pepper salmon didn't want to eat this at all. I am thinking maybe some balsamic vinegar might improve the taste. Will try that another time.

This has been a staple in my menu for 3 yrs now, so I figured I ought to review it.  My 2 year old daughter and her friend love this "pink chicken" recipe!  That a couple of 2 year olds scarf this up without breathing between bites says a lot.  I have also tried it w/ minced ginger instead of garlic and it's just as good.  I have also baked it w/ a little coating of the marinade on the bottom of the pan to make a little sauce for serving.  Thank you for a wonderful and super simple recipe!

Just made this and - YUM! Definitely saving this one! The only issue I encountered was that I checked on it after 15 min, and the glaze/marinade was literally bubbling - I mean HUGE caramelized bubbles! But I just popped them and continued baking for the additional 5 min (don't prefer my salmon on the rarer side, but thats just me). It was absolutely delicious, it just really surprised me there for a minute! Also should mention that I didn't have gloves of garlic so I just doubled the garlic salt.

Easy-Peasy.  Not sure why people have described this as too sweet.  I made it nearly exact, but added cayenne pepper.  It was good.  Kinda simple fish, not sweet and a good alternative to lemon peppered salmon(you have to explore different flavors).  Cooking is supposed to be fun and this recipe has a lot of room to explore what you like.

I feel like the maple syrup I used wasn't the best kind to use, but the salmon came out ugly looking and not very flavorful. It was a slight sweetness and a taste of soy sauce. I was disappointed.

very tasty!  my only criticism would be that i with it stuck to the salmon a little more.  i think in the future i'll warm the glaze a little with some cornstrach and i'll cook the salmon a little bit without it on, take the salmon out and scrap off any fat dripping and then up the glaze on and cook it just long enough to get warm

This is now my husband and I's favorite meals. I marinate it for 30 mins. in a ziploc freezer bag. I baked the salmon on a cookie sheet covered in foil. However, before I baking I drizzled the extra marinade over the salmon. It was absolutely HEAVENLY! Thanks STARFLOWER for the excellent recipe.

Great! I made this for my roommates and myself and we all loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was I added a bit of ginger and since I'm a poor college student I had to cook the salmon in a tin pan. But it still turned out wonderful!

Loved this - so simple to make and delicious!! 
 I didn't use garlic, just the garlic salt and pepper.  I cut back a little on the soy sauce for my sweet tooth.  
I used high quality salmon from a good local meat shop, used real maple syrup which made a difference, but the store brand soy sauce which didn't seem to make a difference.  I also remembered, after baking it about 20 min. like the recipe said, that the best way to cook fish is in the microwave.  So I popped it in the microwave for a couple minutes and it came out perfect!

It was an okay marinade. I have another marinade that calls for honey vs the syrup that I'm just a tad bit more partial to for salmon.  Nothing against this recipe, it is a preference and it certainly wasn't bad, just had higher hopes for it and sadly set myself up for disappointment.  My modifications consisted of omitting the garlic salt and adding one more clove of garlic since soy sauce does have a tendency to be high in sodium.

I do not like salmon at all, but this recipe was delicious AND easy. My husband was worried that this would taste too sweet because of the maple syrup, but worry not it isn't the overpowering flavor.

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make. I didn't have enough maple syrup, so I just substituted with honey and that worked great. I also add about 1/2 tsp of ginger.

One of the best salmon recipies out there. Even better if you add a splash of whiskey to the marinade. This dish is out of this world when BBQd on a cedar plank.

Very delicious, fast and easy. I make this quite often. Sometimes I use brown sugar in place of the maple syrup since it's cheaper but always double the sauce!!!

was very flavorful.  I dont like salmon very much but I did this way.  The 7 year old actually cleaned her plate for a change :) the only thing I will personally do is reduce some of the maple syrup, was just a little sweet.

Great salmon recipe. Dont let it marinate for too long or all you taste is the marinade. I usually let it marinate for 15-20 min. Bake the fish in the sauce and drizzle with the leftover baked sauce. My wife likes it, which is a shocker, cuz she doesnt like fish. Its my and my sons favorite way to have salmon.

GREAT recipe! I absolutly loved it! I dont like soy sauce and was a little hesitant when I smelled the mixture but once cooked it is soooo good! Make sure to let the salmon sit in the mixture for at least 30 min and to pour it over the top once cooked like other people suggested! Thanks for sharing - will use agin!

Very good but I found the maple syrup taste (used 100% pure syrup) to be overpowered by the soy sauce. Next time will increase and decrease them respectively. Still very good, tho.

WOW!!  This recipe was a hit!  I didn't add the garlic salt for 2 reasons - #1 soy sauce is salty enough, and #2 hubby isn't a huge garlic fan.  The mince clove was the perfect amount - flavourful but not over powering.  I followed the rest of the recipe/directions as written and it came out perfect.

This was so tasty! I spruced it up by taking the other reviewer's advice and didn't use the garlic powder. I then used the cayenne pepper. Just a sprinkle. I put the fish in foil packets with carrots and celery. I marinated the fish for 30 minutes in the refrigerator, flipping at the 15 minute mark. I ended up baking the fish the for 18 minutes.   The result is a spicy and tangy and sweet! Delicious! Definitely make again.

A nice, mildly sweet, salmon recipe.  We grilled it instead of baking it and it was wonderful.  I did as was suggested by others and thickened the marinade (while the salmon was grilling) and used it as a sauce for the salmon and for the wild rice side dish.  I did have to add water to the marinade because it was too strong, but it turned out great.

We eat quite a lot of salmon (always wild), my husband's favorite meal. I happened upon this recipe recently and made it for the second time yesterday. Absolutely delicious! I used fresh ginger and sea salt as one reviewer suggested. Yum.

I've made this several times.  I usually add more garlic, fresh ginger and if I want it more saucy I'll add orange juice.  Excellent flavor.  Watch your cooking times...I've had to adjust that depending on the thickness of my fish. I have proudly served this to guests.

I thought I would try this out because my husband hates fish! He loves to fish but not to actually eat it! It was amazing! Loved it! So much flavor. The only thing I did different was make alot of the sauce. I did  1/2 c syrup 1/4 c soy sauce 6 garlic gloves tsp garlic powder (not salt) a few pinches of pepper  It made a lot of sauce, perfect to put over our roasted potatoes!!

I was looking for something easy and different.  Wow my family loved this recipe.  Enjoy.  It was simple, stuff I have in the house, it was great.  I even learned that soy sauce packets from the chinese restaurant has 2 tsp of  soy sauce ( cause I was a little low ).  I doubled the recipe and used it on the salmon from costco.  Good enough for company.

This was excellent! I was a little hesitant at first, because of the ingredients. I'm very picky with my salmon. My husband cooked it on the grill. This is a def keeper! Didn't change a thing.

Easy and tasty! Just what I need for a quick, healthy dish that everyone in my family enjoys.  I usually add a little extra fresh garlic and serve with brown rice and a steamed or sauteed veggie.

I really thought this was going to be wonderful. The fish martinated only for 30 minutes as advised but it turned out  poorly. I like any kind of salmon but really wanted to toss out the rest of this.

So, so, so delicious.  This recipe and the Dijon Garlic Salmon on this site are my two favorite salmon recipes.  I've tried this on the grill and baked.  I think it came out a lot better when I baked it.  (You get more of the marinade flavor.) Both ways were good though.  I would like to try this on other types of fish as well.

This recipe is wonderful. I don't think I've ever eaten a salmon dish that was moister or more delicious than this. I omitted the garlic salt, minced another clove of garlic in its place. I also cooked my salmon in a foil pouch, and put some of the leftover heated marinade back on top of the fish.

Delicious.  I wrapped it in aluminum foil to bake for about 15 min, the opened it up and broiled it for about 5 (my main reason for wrapping it was for the easy clean-up).  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Next time I'm going to reduce the glaze and add some cornstarch to make a sauce to serve on top, as one reviewer had suggested.  My husband, who claims to not like fish, ate every bit of his portion--which is a first, and, in our household, speaks for itself.

Mmm...Very good, easy to prepare with staple ingredients! No need to leave the house to impress! I used frozen salmon filets, not completely thawed. I poked fork holes in them like another member had suggested, it absorbed the marinade.  Double the recipe if you want to have extra sauce. It was great with steam cooked rice and carrots!

We love salmon, but this is by far the BEST salmon recipe I've ever tried.  My hubby and I almost fought over who was getting the rest of the fillet (and we had to fight off our 4 cats in the process!!!).  The maple syrup definitely makes this special.

This is my new favorite way to cook salmon.  I give it 5 stars for taste and convenience.  Only change I made was to poke holes in the salmon with a fork before pouring the mixutre on to marinate.  Delicious!

This produced a delicious sticky baked salmon fillet, that even my partner said he enjoyed although he is not keen on sweet/savoury combos. I served mine with a herby, broccoli rice. I didn't follow the measurements in the recipe exactly, I judged by eye. I'll be making it again very soon!

Easy and delicious! I will make again, but will cut down on the syrup, as it was a little too sweet for our taste.

This recipe was great, everyone loved it even my mom who doesn't really like fish.  I made it with pecan brown rice, it was great!

I usually don't like meat and fish to have a sweet taste but I decided to go ahead and fix this since I had maple syrup on hand.  It turned out to be excellent and my husband loved it also (not to mention my picky 2 1/2 year old took a couple of bites also).  Thanks for the great recipe!

We make this at least once every two weeks. The only thing different that we do is grill the salmon and use the marinade for basting.

Wow! I never would've thought to use maple syrup as a marinade, but it turned out GREAT. I used it for pork chops also and it was equally fantastic.

This is the best way I have ever had home cooked salmon. Period. We have started eating a lot of fish in my household and it's gotten kind of boring with lemons and some sort of herb combo. Great way to change things up! I don't like to make changes to the recipes before I've tried them as written but for this one I did... a tiny bit. I did add horseradish to mine because of the picky eaters. I knew sweet fish without any kick would probably not go over as well. Thanks again for submitting!

This recipe was good. Almost tasted like Teriyaki sauce. I used pancake syrup instead because I didn't   have maple syrup on hand.

This was really good.  I used fresh fish and it was yummy.  I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the glaze kind of slides off during baking, so I couldn't really taste the maple/soy flavors, which I was craving, because it smelled really good!

I enjoyed this. I made the receipe exactly as written. I love the taste of real maple syrup and am not a big salmon fan so this recipe provided a great solution for me to be able to eat this type of fish.

This was absolutely delicious! This is my first review on here but not my first recipe that I've tried. This one was just good enough to write about.  I accidentally used too much garlic (I used jarred garlic instead of fresh, and used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon) so I balanced it out by adding more maple syrup. It was very sweet and very good. My family is from Vermont so anything with Maple Syrup is a favorite.

This was my first time ever cooking fish, so I was a bit nervous.  This recipe was extremely easy for a novice like myself, and it tasted amazing.  I loved the sweetness from the maple, but it wasnt too sweet at all.  This will def be my staple salmon recipe!

I would have to agree that this was fabulous.  I had a big salmon so I doubled the marinade.  I saved some and put it on the table to add to our plates.  YUM!!

This recipe was so easy to put together it was awesome.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and took the skin off the fish, to help it taste less fishy.  We ate this with white rice and I chopped up some green onions and put it on top of the rice and fish to give more color...very good.

My husband loved this but I had to choke it down.  I don't think I have a pallet for Salmon.....it wasn't so much the recipe's fault!  The recipe was very easy to follow and the ingredients are basic things that most people have on hand from day to day.

This was so good! I followed the instructions, except reduced the syrup to 1 tablespoon and used 1 teaspoon of low sodium soy sauce. It came out PERFECT! My husband loved it! I always had a problem with my salmon coming out so thick and dry, but not this time! I served it with some asparagus and rice, wonderful :-) This is a keeper!

Very easy & yummy!  I'm usually not a huge salmon fan, but I really enjoyed this recipe.  The marinade only takes a few minutes to mix up.  I did put fish in a tin foil sack I made with 2 pieces of foil and then drizzled the marinade over it.  Bake for 15-17 minutes, then broil for 5-6 minutes.  A+ in my book!

I really like salmon and this is a nice way to prepare it.  The flavor is sweet and tangy without overpowering the natural flavor of the fish.  Make sure you use REAL maple syrup to get the most out of this recipe.  Also don't overcook the fish!  It should flake easily while still retaining a little color inside.  It's easy to do (trust me, I know) so keep an eye on it.  Baking per the recipe is great or you could grill the fish if so inclined.  Once again, make sure not to grill it to death!  It's a good recipe that's definitely worth a try!

this was the best salmon recipe ever, if I could give it more stars I would, the whole family raved. I used a huge fillet of salmon and quadrupled the sauce it turned out juicy and very tasty. The cooking time was longer but if you keep an eye on it, (it was more like 45 minutes) it will stay moist and wonderful. This will definetly be used at the pig roast (spelling??)

This was super easy to make and tasted delicious! For those of you who are not big fish lovers, the sweetness of the maple syrup takes away the strong fish flavor.

My sister refers to this recipe as the "stalker dinner" because if I make this for a date, he will never leave me alone.  My best friend (straight girl) proposed to me when I made this.   Lesson learned- make this only for people who you're pretty sure you'd like to have around for another 50 years.  Sooo good!

VERY TASTY.  We made this because we forgot to start the marinade we usually use early enough and were looking for a relatively quick recipe for the salmon fillet in the fridge. We made it exactly as described and the fish was moist, flavorful, not too sweet, and lifted right off the skin when I took it out of the baking dish.  Will definitely be having again.

Delicious!  Only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt since I used regular (not low-sodium) soy sauce,  which is already super salty.  Salmon was awesome!!  I took some other people's advice and poured the marinade into a sauce pan, added a little cornstarch and poured it over the salmon.

Good. Kids and hubby ate it. A bit dry, though, for my taste. I must admit I am not super confident when it comes to determining when fish is done!
Update: Tried it again. Followed the 1/2 inch for 6 minute rule. Used BBQ thick Trader Joes salmon...about one inch....for 12 minutes. Perfect! Update: Tried it with Trader Joes Sockeye. Not nearly as good. Dry/fishy. Didn't marinate either of the last two times.

I had a freezer burnt salmon that I needed to use, and this recipe was excellent for it! The maple syrup mixture provided enough flavor to cover the unpleasant freezer flavor but still let the flavor of the salmon itself through. My family loved it!

I thought this recipe was awesome - so yummy.  The only thing I would do different is check the fish a little earlier - 20 min wound up a little overcooked for me.

This is an excellent recipe especially for those who are not big on salmon. It is easy to cook, and the fish turns out juicy and tasty.   My friends found this recipe about a year ago. Weâve tried it a few times, and now it is the only recipe of salmon that I make at home. And quite frankly one of very few I like.

Outstanding! I took the suggestion of previews reviewers and heated the marinate with cornstarch and poured that over the salmon.  It was good w/ & w/o the sauce though.

I don't like salmon so I wasn't crazy about this dish but the seafood lovers in my family love this.  They say it's better than the maple salmon they've ordered out in seafood restaurants.

This was the best salmon recipe I've tasted.  I have tried many salmon recipes on here and just didn't like it it.  But, this one I will try again.

Amazing flavor for such a simple recipe! I marinated a pound of salmon in plastic baggie - doubled the recipe because I like a lot of sauce. Instead of discarding the marinade, I poured it over the salmon and baked it for about twenty minutes, until the sauce thickened. It was delicious! Very savory and not too sweet because of the soy sauce and garlic. My new favorite salmon recipe.

I haven't traditionally been a "fish" person. In fact, it's only been in the last 7 years that I've eaten it. This is a good recipe. 20 minutes in the oven was too short for my cut of fish. I liked the idea of incorporating brown sugar into the mix, wrapping in foil for marinade step, and having the fish spend a few minutes in the broiler. It was a great meal. I served with some Jasmine rice that I made in my rice cooker. Could not be an easier meal!

I have made this recipe five times. It is my absolute favorite way to eat salmon! I actually taught my non-cooking mother to make this, which she then in turn cooked for friends, who were very impressed by her sudden skill. ;-) If you never cook fish, I believe this is a great recipe to start with!  A few notes on the marinade: I've found that I always need to make more because I add it to the foil wraps. It's also important to use real maple syrup, as fake syrup has a different kind of sweet taste that I didn't like as much. I add a lot more garlic, too, because we love garlic.  Make a foil "pouch" to bake the fish in! This way, it can cook in the marinade, too, and it prevents a mess in your pan. :-) The fish cooked perfectly when I did this.

It was pretty good.  My husband thought it was too sweet even after I added ginger to the recipe.  Instead of maple syrup, I will try honey next time.

I love this baked salmon! I tried it a while ago and it's become a usual at my house. Even my boyfriend makes it (and trust me, that means it pretty good-and simple). Sometimes we use a little more maple because we prefer the sweetness. I abosolutely recommend this recipe!

Turned out perfect, and I didn't have time to marinade it. I just let it sit on the counter for 10 minutes while my oven preheated.  My 3 year old son loved this and I had seconds then thirds.  Really delicious!

This was FANTASTIC.  I added a bit of fresh chopped ginger as well to the marinade, and cooked it at 450 degrees (it was a fairly thick cut).  i HIGHLY recommend this recipe.  It is delicious and super easy.

Best salmon ever!  One of my favorites on entire website.  I ate the whole portion myself in two meals because it was sooooooo good.  Wrapped in aluminum foil to marinate, but cooked uncovered.   Used garlic powder in lieu of garlic salt.

I have to say that I don't like salmon all that much, and for some reason, I figured that Aunt Jemima would be equivalent to maple syrup...that having been said, this is definitely one of the worst 4+ star recipes I've made.  I kept finding myself trying to add more saltiness and sour flavorings...as if I could somehow rescue our expensive cut of salmon and return it to the lemon pepper we -should- have bathed it in.  Again, I'm not one to slam someone else's creation.  Maybe there was something wrong with the salmon.  And again, I'm not a big fan of it in the first place...  I'm giving it two stars, because it probably would've been better if I'd used real maple syrup.

My husband said it really made the fish easier to eat (took away some of the strong fish taste).  My kids ate it up.

This is one of my husband's favorites! We love the sweetness with the fish. I'm not big on salmon, but this marinade gives such a great flavor. I make my own maple syrup when I'm out!

The recipe is easy and quick. I used Garlic Powder instead of Garlic Salt. It was good and my husband loved it. I, on the other hand didn't particularly care for the salmon taste with sweetness. It was good, but not really my taste. We had Stove Top and peas on the side. I'd recommend, for all, but if you have a problem adjusting to sweet/fish combos, it may not be your favorite.

I made the recipe for 2 and we thought it was delicious. I served it with rice and drizzled a little of the sauce from the salmon over it.

This recipe was great! i used it exactly as followed and my salmon came out great. A hint the longer you marinate the fish, the more moisture it will retain so I usually refrigerate it for about 2-3 hours instead of the one but it always turns out great!

I have made this a couple of times following the recipe exactly was very, very good, last time I added 1 tbsp. of horseradish to marinade and it gave it a nice little zip. Will continue to use both versions best salmon marinade I've used so far.

UPDATE: I GUESS MY TASTEBUDS ARE CHANGING WITH AGE BECAUSE AFTR JUST ONE BITE, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS. MY MOM REQUESTED I MADE SALMON FOR HER BDAY, SO I GAVE THIS A SECOND GO-AROUND. I CHANGED NOTHING AND AND SOOOO GLAD I DIDN'T. THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Meh. I was hoping to recreate a similar dish I had on the Disney Wonder last year. Animator's Palate served an AWESOME maple glazed salmon over mashed red potatoes with a side of steamed green beans that was TO DIE FOR!!! While tasty, this just wasn't what I was looking for. :( The sauce is only mildly sweet and the garlic flavor is a bit overpowering (and I LOVE the stuff - 40 clove garlic chicken please!!!). Since my fiance picked up 1 lb. worth of salmon steaks, I used those instead, but would have prefered filets. I pretty much followed STARFLOWER's directions exactly except for wrapping each steak (there were two) in a double thickness of aluminum foil and drizzling with just a little of the maple syrup/glaze. I baked covered, for 20 minutes and then broiled, slightly opened for another 3. I made a sauce with the remaining glaze by heating it over med-high heat and adding 1 T cornstarch mixed with 2 T cold water to thicken. Served with refrigerated mashed red potatoes and honey carrots I picked up in my grocer's frozen foods section (I wanted dinner to be quick tonight), this was an "OK" meal. Thanks for sharing your idea, STARFLOWER :)

just finished the dish with a few drops of sauce left on the plate. It Is So Good That I Bit My Mouth. only had frozen salmon so left it out on the counter for 30 in marinade to defrost a little and increased baking time to 30 min. came out perfect. had it w/ lemony french beans. good to balance off the sweetness of maple syrup. this will be easy to make 10 or even 20 times more for a dinner party.

Great salmon recipe. It's very similar to the flavor of the "Grilled Salmon I" recipe (that one's worth trying too). I like my salmon a tad rareness just so it's extra tender so I bake it at 400 degrees and 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. It always comes out perfect!

My children gobbled this up.  My son who rarely eats fish, asked for more.  Also made this recipe when visiting family and a sister-in-law said she'll never cook salmon any other way.

Made this recipe this past weekend for a bbq. Everyone LOVED it! We made the salmon on the grill and the charcoal flavor plus the maple flavor was an absolutely wonderful combination!

I followed this recipe exactly but thought the maple syrup overpowered the other ingredients too much. I know it's called Maple Salmon for a reason, but the kitchen smelled like French toast. It was all right, just not really in line with my personal preference.

My husband and I weren't sure how the soy sauce and maple syrup would taste together but we were both pleasantly surprised. We used a little less maple syrup and a little more soy sauce than called for so it wouldn't be too sweet. Definitely a keeper!

I thought this recipe was really good.  It had a little more of the maple flavor than I wanted.  So next time I'll probably do a little less than 1/4 C and maybe a tad more soy sauce.  Also, it was little dry, so I might do a little less time in the oven.  But overall a really good recipe.  Will be making again for sure!!!

This was excellent - everyone in the family loved it.  Very nice flavor, not overpoweringly sweet.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to substitute garlic powder for the garlic clove (which I didn't have) and garlic salt.  I did not add any salt and the marinade was just fine.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was fabulous.  I didn't have any garlic salt so I used 1/8 tsp. seasoned salt.  I also cooked it on the grill basting with the marinade that I had brought to a simmer in a small pot.  Outstanding fish!

Excellent recipe and method of making fish - it really couldn't be any easier! I like to doctor mine up a little bit with some fresh ginger and hot red pepper flakes. Otherwise, this is a great "go to" recipe on a weeknight when you don't have a lot of time to make dinner. Even my two-year-old gobbles it up.

The maple syrup adds a subtle sweetness that pairs really nicely with the salmon.  I also ommitted the garlic salt per the recommendations of other reviewers.  Will definitely make again.

Made this today for Mother's Day.  It was delicious.  We actually grilled the fish because we prefer the grill when it's nice outside.  I use a lot of marinades with brown sugar and soy so this had a flavor that I like.  Very good recipe to use.  Follow it exactly and you'll have a delicious piece of fish!

My mother-in-law is very picky about Salmon and I was able to impress her with this dish.  I stuck to the recipe because I'm not an adventurous cook.

Best Salmon I have ever tried. My all time favorite recipe. Another great recipe is miso glazed, but this is cheaper and easier to make. Marinate for 30 mins then bake.

We love this recipe, this is the only way the kids will eat salmon and thats why it earns 5 stars! The maple syrup makes the fish sweet but not so sweet that hubby and I won't eat it. Thanks for sharing!

I loved the flavor of this salmon!! Even the hubby said he'd eat this salmon because it tastes like more that fish!! LOL I didn't get to cook this dish in the oven, as my heating elements fried during the preheat. I ended up tossing them in a oiled up, high heated pan until they had a nice coat on them!! Can't wait to try in the oven! TY!!

This recipe is absolutely awesome!  I have a 3 year old daughter and it is sometimes difficult to find recipes that are healthy, but have a taste that little ones will love.  We are trying to get more fish in our diet too and this is certainly a delicious way to do it.  The salmon comes out so moist and has a delicious sweet flavor.  I've already made this one a part of my go to favorites for a quick dinner for the family. Thanks for sharing!

This cooked nicely on the George Forman grill - crispy outside and succulent inside.  However there was very little maple flavor and the grill was extremely difficult to clean.

This was the best salmon recipe that I have ever made!  I'm not the biggest fan of salmon or maple syrup.  But I had all items on hand, so I figured I'd try it.  After marinating it, baked in a foil pack with the marinade.  Then opened the foil during the last five minutes broiled.  My BF LOVED it!!!!  It was quick, easy and GOOD!!!!

This sounded terrible to me, maple syrup and salmon? Yuck! Boy was I wrong! GREAT TASTE! So easy and so yummy. I had company over, who I found out later aren't big salmon or maple syrup fans. They loved it! Cleaned plates and asked if they could take some leftovers if I didn't think I could eat it all before it spoiled (yeah I think they just wanted more!) Super!

The marinade is good, but I think it would be much better on the grill.  I'll try it that way next time.

This is an easy marinade to make a flavorful meal. I love how it is ingredients I already have. I marinade mine in a ziploc for 30 mins prior to baking. I drizzle half the marinade on the salmon while baking, then add the last half of it the last 5 mins or so. This causes it to thicken up. I then spoon the sauce over each piece of salmon. I usually make more marinade then it calls for so I can have extra. EDIT: I also like to add a 1/2 tsp of cayanne pepper to give this a kick. Yummy!

Excellent! Just the right amount of sweet and salty without being too much.  I omitted garlic salt, the soy sauce adds enough salt and the fresh garlic adds enought garlic. I also listened to another reviewer and added 1 tblsp of brown sugar, because my maple syrup was light.  Sooo EASY to make and wonderful to eat.  Many thanks for this fabulous recipe!

This was great, I added a little ginger puree, and garlic powder as I dont like garlic salt.  I served this with some onion flavoured rice, broccoli and garlic bread, what a great meal!!

This was very good.  My wife and I loved it.  I made no changes to the recipe except for doubling the sauce.  I served it with brown rice, maple syrup carrots and green peas.  We're looking forward to leftovers tonight.

I've never made salmon on my own before but this came out great! I thought the garlic, maple, and soy sauce really flavored the salmon well without overpowering it. I'm not a huge fish person but the sweetness from the maple syrup really gave me an incentive to try it, and I was not disappointed!

Very tasty!  I let the fish marinade just while the oven was preheating.  The flavors are very nice and meld well together - the sweetness is subtle and the garlic/soy sauce flavors are not overpowering.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so easy and delicious. We usually don't even marinate it for 30 minutes, just slather it up and bake it (however it is a lot better marinated).

This is a great salmon recipe, probably the best I've ever used! I followed other peoples advice and added some ginger to it, very good! I wonder though if this recipe is meant for "real" maple syrup or the Aunt Jemima type...because theres a huge difference.

Full of flavor.  I wanted something different from the lemon salmon that I normally make.  This fit the bill.  Easy and very tasty.

This was VERY good, however I only used 1 tbsp of soya sauce because of the saltiness.  I also didn't have any garlic cloves so I used ground garlic powder, left out the garlic salt, and I also used ginger.  I will definitley be re-making this!!

Awesome Recipe! I made no changes to the ingredients and the salmon turned out perfect! The only thing I did different was marinate it over night, which from reading other reviews i've found out that you're not supposed to do that so next time I will only marinate 30 minutes, but GREAT recipe!

This is a super easy recipe that tastes great.  I do not like the taste of maple but decided to try this from all the great reviews.  I used light maple syrup and followed the recipe with the exception of not adding the garlic salt and instead used lemon pepper.  Baked in in the oven as the recipe states.  Excellent, even the kids liked it.  Not too sweet at all and no strong maple taste.

I have made this many times and my fish-leery family devours it. What a great way to get them to eat something healthy that is also delicious! Leftovers also make a great salmon salad the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe -- I've made a similar one with a brown sugar glaze, but this version is faster.  I also used a round tsp of dry ginger since I didn't have grated (one of the raters suggested.) I'm sure grated would be better but it still did the trick.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so simple and delicious! It was by far the BEST salmon recipe I've ever made. Next time I will buy skinless though, so the marinade can soak in even more.

Yum! Do not change recipe at all for time!  Marinate only 30 minutes.

I had cut to 15 minutes marinating time after reading the reviews and watching the salmon soaking up the syrup mixture.   Was not too sweet at all and founds ourselves scraping the juices from the pan to add more of the yummy flavor.  Next time, will marinate 30 minutes.   
This was the first time 7yr dd said she liked salmon and the fish sticks were pushed to the side.   
If you like easy recipes that taste like you spent a lot of time on it, this is a great one.
We had fried cabbage/onion with it, and for some reason tasted really good together.  I guess the sweet and salty flavors.
Will fancy up the side dishes next time we have company with asparagus and roasted potatoes.  All ready to eat this again.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit.  The sweet from the maple syrup really offsets the fish taste of the salmon.  It will make a salmon lover out of any one!  Beware, I was surprised at how expensive Maple syrup was but it really made the difference in the recipe, well worth it!

Omitted the garlic salt (too much salt in the soy sauce anyway), used about a tsp of minced garlic and used medium amber maple syrup to be exact and wow is this good. I love how everything beautifully plays off of each other. The soy sauce, the garlic, the maple. You can taste it all. I'm not usually one for sweet dishes but I love this. It's not super sweet but a bit mildly sweet instead. So unless someone just hates anything sweet they'd probably like this. Definitely something I will be making again and again.

Our first time to make salmon.  DELICIOUS!!  I'm not a huge fan of maple syrup and it sounded odd on fish, but the soy sauce cut some of the sweetness and took out the mapley pancake syrup flavor and just left a nice sweetness.  SO good.  Highly recommend.

This was DELICIOUS I was nervous because me salmon was a little fragrant, even my pregnant wife loved this. I left the leftover sauce in and it did not burn but I drizzled it on the served salmon and gave it extra kick. next time I might give it a tiny bit of hot sauce for bite. Thanks starflower

I love this recipe.  It is even easier if you buy the salmon already skinned.  A word of caution - make sure there is no extra marinade in the pan when you bake this because it will burn due to the sugar content and stink up your kitchen.

Wow, this recipe is so easy and absolutely amazing!  The fish comes out perfectly tender and the maple glaze is a perfect complement to the fish.  One time I only had time to marinate the fish for 15 minutes so I wrapped the fillets in foil with the maple marinade inside, then baked them and they still came out perfectly.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful flavor and texture! I sprinkled green onions on top of the salmon for the last 10 min of the baking and it gave a terrific balance to the sweet fish. We now make this every Christmas Eve!

Excellent recipe.  I had a thinner piece of salmon (about 1 1/2 inches) and it was only 1/2 a pound, so I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes and it turned out wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.

I also added a 1/2 TB of wasabi for an extra kick.  Wonderful.

This is one of my desert-island recipes. I make it at least once a month, and sometimes once a week. It could not possibly be easier, and it never fails to please. It's easy enough to be a super mid-week family meal, and tasty and pretty enough to be a great company meal. I generally double the quantity of sauce, and I serve it with orzo cooked in chicken broth.

I made this recipe for my two roommates who did not like salmon to begin with, but after I made this for them we have it once a week for dinner!!  This is a great recipe!  The only thing I do differently now is that one time I used a mixture of Garlic powder and onion powder because I ran out of Garlic salt.  To me this makes it taste better!

I thought this was a so-so recipe. My BF liked it better than I did, but we both thought it was much too sweet.  Kind of sticky, too.  I would try making this again, but I would cut the maple in half. I used VT Medium Amber syrup.

SOOOOOO Good!  My husband and I loved it!  It has a very subtle flavor.  I definitely recommend cooking in tin foil to get the flavor soaked in, and it also allows you to easily collect the rest of the juice to dip the salmon in if you want!

Definitely the best Salmon I have ever had.  I would suggest when making this to make more than you need... your family will want seconds and leftovers!

I didn't have maple syrup at home but substituted wildflower honey. (I guess that makes it Honey Salmon) it turned out fabulous. My husband was a bit skeptical but he loved it when he tried it. The sauce was especially a big hit. I added a little butter & cilantro to each piece. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

No complaints about this one!  I love salmon.  I grew up on a diet consisting mainly of salmon and clam chowder (or so it seemed) and I have tried a lot of recipes.  This one was at the top of the list.

This is a great recipe!  I usually alter recipes, sometimes beyond recognition, but with this recipe I only doubled the fresh garlic because we always at least double the garlic in our house, and added salt and garlic powder because I don't own garlic salt.  We were very pleased with the outcome and will make it again.  Thank you.

This was great! The amounts and marinating time were just perfect--sweet, without being too sweet. I wasn't sure whether or not to discard the marinade before baking because the recipe didn't say, so we baked it in the marinade and it worked out great! If you like salmon and you like maple syrup, you'll love this!

I know I am in the minority, but I did not like this. Perhaps the quality of the maple syrup really makes a difference, I was using a cheaper brand. I'm not sure, but I will not make this again.

We had this as a weeknight meal.  It tasted good as written, but I might try foil pouches next time as suggested by others to get a more carmelized flavor.

Great, great ,great!!! The only problem that I had was the store I went to didn't have fresh salmon. So, I had to use frozen salmon fillets. Still great though. I "WILL" definitely make this again!!! My favorite salmon recipe yet!!!

PHENOMENAL!!!!!!! I never would have thought to pair maple syrup with salmon but it compliments the fish great without overpowering. My husband said he has never had better salmon even in an upscale restaurant. The only way I prepare salmon now.

This is wonderful!  I too added a few red chili flakes to give it a little pizazz and it was perfect.  While it was grilling I boiled the sauce about 4 min. and let it cool slightly and drizzled it over the salmon. Hubby loved it !

delicious!  like some other reviewers, i omitted the garlic salt in favor of extra fresh garlic and sea salt.  additionally, i used organic dark maple syrup and low sodium organic tamari instead of soy sauce.  i also left the dish covered with foil for the duration of the bake time, in order to keep the salmon nice and moist.  very tasty!!  :)

After going through an over two year dislike of salmon (thank you pregnancy :)) I decided to try it again and this is the recipe I used.  Perfect for a busy working Mom, easy to make and delicious.  Both of my kids, and my husband loved it.  Would highly suggest it to anyone.

Excellent recipe, I make it a couple of times a month now. Just be aware that this recipe is only for people who like the taste of salmon. My fiance doesn't care for any "fishy" taste, so this is out for her, but I love the taste of salmon and the ingredients mix very well with the natural flavor of the fish.

Really good!  The maple goes well with the salmon. The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of salt since there's enough salt in the other ingredients. Yum!

I cooked this while babysitting my nephews (3 & 5yrs).  My husband loved it, and the boys gobbled it up.  The five yr old told me I was a good cook. Haha.  Great easy recipe.  Thanks!

Next time, I'd use a little less maple syrup to cut down on the sweetness. Overall, very good!

Taste really good, even with some noodle.
Yet I would prefer marinating it for longer then 30mins, in room temperature.  The juice makes it Excellent if it was in the meat!

This was quite yummy, I took the previous advice and omitted the garlic salt - the soy sauce added more than enought salt to the salmon. 
It was sweet, but not too sweet - I will be making this again!

This is the best salmon marinade.  I made it last night on our TRAEGER BBQ for dinner tonight,and it was eaten for breakfast instead.  I have made this one many times and my fisherman husband just loves it.

I live in the northwest so I eat salmon frequently and this is the best salmon I have ever had. It's so easy that I don't mind asking the baby-sitter to make it if I'm having her make dinner for the kids. 

I had guests over for dinner last night and made this and they couldn't stop raving about it.

I rate this recipe 5/5 for flavor but 4/5 for consistency. The sauce wasn't thick enough for our liking - maybe because I used pure maple syrup rather than regular thick syrup? All in all, it was delicious - next time I'll just use regular thick syrup.

Very tasty recipe, and easy to make!  I had approximately 2 pounds of salmon fillets, so I increased the ingredients accordingly.  The only minor adjustment I made was that I marinated the fish in the fridge for around 45 minutes while I made a side dish (garlic red potatoes), and I baked it for around 25 to 30 minutes (since I was using double the amount of fish).  And you know what, I didn't have any genuine maple syrup--I previously checked it out at the grocery store, and the price is a bit too spendy for my budget--so I used regular pancake syrup instead.  It turned out great!  It added just the right touch of sweetness to balance out the saltiness of the soy sauce and other seasonings.

Wow, I just made this and this really is as good as everyone says-I'd gotten kind of skeptical about salmon after eating way too much canned and frozen salmon, but I went and got fresh salmon today and used this marinade.  It came out perfectly flaky and the meat slides right off of the skin.  DELICIOUS!!!

I added dried ginger and orange juice to the marinade to enhance the flavors. Although I know fish isn't supposed to marinate like heavier meats, I would suggest marinating the salmon longer if you want the flavors to really penetrate the fish.

this recipe is incredibly easy, but my family did not like it too much because of the sweetness, we prefer seafood savory. but if you like maple syrup, this is a great recipe to try.

It was ok. I guess I'm not a big maple syrup fan and I'm definitely not a fan of the house smelling like maple syrup for days afterward.

This was pretty good.  We used twice the recipe to marinate, I think we expected it to be sweeter, and would use real maple syrup next time instead of low cal pancake syrup.  Would make again.

This is really a delicious way to serve salmon.  The sweetness of the maple syrup really compliments the salmon.  Even my husband (who isn't thrilled when he knows it's salmon night) loved it. I'll be making this again and again.

This recipe is good overall. The salmon i used was a bit big so I added the baking time a little. The next time I'd cut down on the amount of maple syrup because it was too sweet for my liking and it covers the soy sauce taste. Thanx!

I think I have reviewed this recipe before, but it deserves another one.  It is SO good.  I had a thicker piece and cooked it in an 8x8 glass dish skin side down for 30 minutes at 400 degrees after pouring the marinade over it.  The marinade gets bubbly and a little sticky, but I liked that.  Really delicious.

This is my all time fav recipe for salmon and everyone who tastes it loves it.  It tastes even better if you cook it on the bbq.  I have even used this marinade on lamb cutlets and they too taste fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe was delicious, and I'm not even the biggest fan of salmon. My husband went out to a nice restaurant the other night with his company and got salmon, and he said it didn't even compare to this recipe. I'm making it again tonight for the second time!

I was a little worried before making and trying this recipe cuz I like salmon pretty much plain. When I first tried it I wasn't sure if I liked the sweet with the salmon but then I realized I kept eating it and am now addicted! :) Great recipe I too used sugar free maple syrup and it turned out wonderful. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe came out really well!  My husband was not as enthusiastic as I was (hence the 4 stars) but my three year old wanted seconds and thirds of this "chicken".  He'd never tried salmon before, so it was great to find a recipe that he loved.  This was really easy to make, and not too fishy or sweet.  We will be serving it again!

My entire family loved this recipe. The fish was very fresh, and extremely moist. We grilled it, rather than baked. I used exactly 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and thought it could use a bit more. I skipped the garlic salt, and doubled the minced garlic. I also added a dash of ground ginger. I was worried that 2.25 pounds of salmon fillet would be too much for the four of us--but, there wasn't a crumb left!

This recipe is so easy and quick to prepare! I cook for my in-laws, both in late 80's, and they love this recipe. FIL loves salmon and really appreciates it when I make this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Very yummy!  I made 2x the marinade, and used half of it to marinate the salmon.  While we grilled the salmon, I reduced the remaining marinade to a nice sauce.  We spooned the sauce over the fish and some rice before serving.  Absolutely fabulous!

The salmon didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would after reading the reviews. Next time I'll use the foil method to marinate the fish and that would make it perfect. It took almost 30 minutes to cook.

This was really good.  I didn't have time to marinate it for as long as I would have liked, and I will double the sauce recipe next time to have more to drizzle on top.  But my family really liked it.  I will make this again.

I was born and raised on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and everyone in my family fishes.  I've had many a salmon dinner and this BY FAR stands out as thee very best.  And it smells divine while cooking.  My hubby doesn't eat seafood, but lemme tell ya, I'll still be making this...!  (He can have chili!).  It's hard to believe that such a simple and easy recipe can produce such fabulous results!  Enjoy!

I wish I could give this ten stars due to the taste, simplicity, and a quick dinner!  I marinated the salmon in a foil packet for 30 minutes and then cooked it in my toaster oven.  I used lite syrup and since I used full strength soy sauce, I used garlic powder versus garlic salt.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks.

I usually order salmon when I go to a nice restaurant, and this is *probably* the best salmon I have ever had. I made twice the sauce so I had enough for leftovers, but the sauce is so flavorful that I didn't need to.  I also added 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, minced, to the sauce. I served the maple salmon with roasted asparagus tips and mustard mashed potatoes.

So easy and so amazingly good!! This recipe is the only way that I want to cook salmon.  If you serve it with a nice white wine and a side of the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes it makes an amazingly wonderful (and possibly romantic) meal.  Good luck!!

This is by far the best salmon recipe I have tried!  I never thought to use maple syrup as a marinade but it is great!  I put some chunks of onion on top of the salmon and in the dish when baking and even those tasted like sweet deliciousness.  And best of all the kitchen smelt amazing!  I am going to have to try this one again and again!

I LOVE this recipe. I make it at least once a month, if not more. I always add more of each of the ingredients because we love the sauce. I know you're not supposed to marinate for 30 minutes so forgive me but I usually prepare it in the morning before I go to work, stick it in the fridge (all in a big ziploc) and pop it in the oven when I get home at night. SUPERB!

Simply awesome for a beginer cook like me.  I left out the garlic salt, added a dash of powdered ginger, let it marinate for 6 hours, and VOILA - perfection. 
Thank you, thank you!!!

This was such an easy and delicious recipe!  Even my 6 year old ate it and the rest of the family loved it.  It has a mild taste although I didn't have enough time to marinate it the full 30 minutes.  Very good.  :)

So simple and SO GOOD!  I wrapped the individual salmon fillets in tin foil to seal in the marinade and stop it from burning all over the baking dish.

Wonderful!! My husband normally hates fish, and was actually able to eat it using this recipe. Next time I'll double the sauce so we can both have enough to spoon over our fish :)

This is delicious. I cooked it on my George Foreman grill for about 3 or 4 minutes. Even my youngest daughter who won't eat salmon ate this. I'll definitely be making this agaian. YUM.

This is an excellent recipe. The sweet maple syrup went so well with the salmon.  The recipe was easy to make, and tasted delicious!

My wife referred to this as "strong candy flavors trying to cover up the strong fishy flavor," and I agree.  The flavors were competing with each other, not blending well at all.  Still, that being said, it was edible and okay.  I probably won't make it again, but it wasn't horrible.

I omitted the garlic salt because of the salty soy sauce.  Great flavor, and when you cook it in the marinade it's great served over rice.

My goodness - I love marinades with maple syrup! This was no exception! Really yummy.  I also wrapped in foil to reduce clean up. I also used garlic foil instead of garlic salt to cut down on saltiness.  Definitely try this!

I made this one for a date.  Homerun.  She loved it, I loved it.  Per another reviewer, the almond wild rice with golden raisins was a perfect side dish.  I also omitted the garlic salt and used more fresh garlic.  Thanks for the great dinner idea.

This was very good, it almost has a flavour similar to honey-garlic.  My family gobbled it up.  I made only two minor changes  by doubling the quantities for the marinade and increased the marinating time by about another 20 mins, not likely enough to make much difference but that is just when I got around to cooking the salmon.

A wonderful recipe. My husband and I have never been big fans of salmon, until we tasted this recipe. In the marinade, I added fresh dill and it was great! Thank you so much for a wonderful way to fix salmon.

This recipe is so simple and very quick. I just can't believe how big on taste a few simple ingredients can make.  Frozen salmon is always in our freezer, and I didn't even have to go out and buy ingredients because they were already in my cupboard (I don't know why we had maple syrup).  Superb, simple, and quick...now if only I could find a good side recipe to go with it.

No one in my family likes salmon, but I thought after reading other reviews I would give this a try.  My family hated it, and I could eat it if hungry, but it didn't change our minds about salmon.  If you like salmon, it would be a great recipe, but it can't change the salmon from fish to meat.

Delicious! My husband, who HATES fish, absolutely loved it prepared this way. I changed it a bit by adding more minced garlic and no garlic salt (we figured the soy sauce had enough) and it was great. Awesome! Easy! I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious.  I made double the marinade, and I also used the foil to wrap it up instead of a shallow baking dish.  We had a large supply of Salmon from a fishing trip in Canada.  My family loved this recipe, and we weren't out of Salmon in no time at all!

This is our favourite salmon recipe. We've tried others - too ho  hum.
It's quick and easy. I don't even bother with the marinading. Just mix together the sauce, pour it on the salmon and bake as per the instructions.
If we don't happen to have maple syrup in the house, we substitute honey. Still wonderful. Enjoy!

This is by far our favorite salmon recipe. It's different, delicious and soooo easy to make. I used 3 6 oz salmon fillets and doubled the sauce and there was probably enough for 1 more fillet. I didn't change thing and can't think of any way to make it better!

I've been here for years but this is the first recipe I've tried that compelled me to review it. 5 Stars all the way. This was so easy and so delicious. It was even better the second day - had the salmon cold and just warmed up the extra sauce and oh my goodness it was fantastic.

Fantastic...both for simplicity of the recipe and a fabulous result!  I made this a couple of nights ago and the only change I made was to omit the garlic salt and simply use 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I also used real maple syrup and low sodium soy, YUMMY!  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe; I used chopped shallots in place of the garlic powder and added about a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. 

Excellent.

Love this!! Did the 2 minced garlic with the longer marinade time.  Just what my husband needed to now eat salmon without all the heavy sauces.

Just look at the ratings!  Delicious. I used pancake syrup instead of maple syrup and was still very pleased with the results.  I did take the advise of others and increased marinade time to 3 hours.

Another 5 star from my picky hubby! I made a few changes and it was 10 stars in my book. No garlic salt, only fresh garlic. I replaced the garlic salt with seasoned salt, added a pinch of ginger, placed all in foil and put in fridge for 30 minutes. Then I sauteed in a skillet with 1 t butter and all of the marinade, top salmon with a piece of buttered parchment paper (sounds crazy but keeps the moisture in, yummy) and cook 4 min each side. Served with rice (topped the salmon and rice with sauce from skillet) and some southern greens....restaurant quality

Delicious and very easy to put together.  I used garlic power instead of garlic salt and it blended well together.   The recipe is much sweeter than other Salmon recipes, definately a keeper.

This was my first attempt at cooking fish of any kind in many years!  I'm not a huge salmon fan, but this tasted great!  Very tender and flavorful.  The 20 min. cooking time was perfect.

My family loves this recipe.  I added a little more garlic and soy sauce for more flavor but overall it was great.

I followed this to a *T* but it just didn't have much of a flavor...  The salmon was good - none the less but I was expecting more flavor and it didn't have it.  My house had a wonderful maple syrup smell though.

This was really great - my husband said it was ridiculous how good it was. I did think it was just a little bit too sweet and next time I will probably use less maple syrup and add a lot more garlic with some ginger.

This was yummy!  I added ginger to the marinade, too, to add a little more flavor to it, and it turned out great!  This was one of my first tries cooking fish, and it was easy and really very tasty!  I will definitely make this again :)

This recipe is more about accentuating the flavor of salmon instead of overpowering it! Delicious! I love the subtle flavors. I used pure maple syrup and loved the woodier flavor.

I am not a huge salmon fan, but this glaze makes it taste great!! I also made extra and used for brown rice (also not a big fan of, but trying to be healthier!).  LOVED IT!  I added a little brown sugar to the glaze, and used the refrigerated minced garlic instead of fresh. Worked just fine.  I grilled the salmon, also.

Quick and easy, with a yummy teriyaki-type flavor!  I add ginger to the marinade mix, and blend all ingredients together before applying.  I salt & pepper the salmon and let it rech room temperature with the marinade over it.  I usually save some of the marinade mix to baste the salmon with as it cooks.  This also allows me to pay ver close attention as the salmon cooks, as I can't stand overcooked fish.

Very good
I didn't add the soy sauce and I used garlic powder and a little onion powder instead of garlic salt.  Plus I used a little sea salt.  Great with brown rice
and a dark leafy green salad.

This has become a dinner staple in our home - so quick, easy and delicious. Only change is we double the sauce so there is plenty to pour the rice as well - also use 1tbsp crushed garlic rather than the clove. I have shared this with many others and they all love it too. Thanks for the GREAT Recipe.

This was definately good. Unfortunately, I did not realize I was out of tinfoil before I started this, so I was not able to follow suggestions of other cooks. I also did not marinate this, as I was planning on just putting it all in a tinfoil pack. It still turned out really good.

This was so simple & so yummy! The only thing I added was some sesame seeds, right before I baked them.  Even DH, who is not a real big "fish" eater, loved them!

I've only made this twice (both time for dinner parties) and it was a super hit each time.  Didn't change a thing.  Cooked on a grill, wrapped in tin foil soaking in the marinade. Very, very moist. Awesome!

Delicious!  I do love salmon but am often disappointed by overcooked & bland fish when I order out.  None of that here!  A great flavor combination & sure to please!  Followed the recipe exactly & will definitely make again (and again).

Have prepared this in the oven and on top of a wood plank on the grill.  Both turned out wonderful.  The wooden plank is a mighty impressive was to serve this tasty fish. Just remember to soak the plank and keep the heat on medium.  Found fresh Sockeye Alaskan Salmon at a fair price at Costco's.

I made this for my family. It was quick and easy. I followed the suggestion of leaving out the garlic salt since the soy sauce is already salty. It was very good, but not spectacular. The marinade imparts a delicate flavor and I would have liked it to be stronger. Perhaps I should have poured the remaining marinade from the pan over the salmon after baking. A pretty good no muss, no fuss meal.

This was good. The maple flavor was not overpowering, but was pleasantly present.  If I was better at cooking salmon it might have been great.

I made this but left out the garlic salt and used reduced sodium soy sauce. Instead of baking, I grilled on a cedar plank. This was some of the best salmon I've ever eaten. We'll try it baked in the winter, but the grilled was special.

My husband really liked this and I am not a huge salmon lover but I enjoyed it.  I would recommend that you marinate in a zip loc bag and then transfer to a cooking dish.  The marinade will get baked on and smoke if there is too much in the dish, but the more you have on the Salmon the better.

This is absolutely delicious.  I've tried many different salmon recipes but my husband always says this is the best one.  Don't get cheap and use fake maple syrup (like Hungry Jack or Aunt Jemima) - I've tried both, and the real stuff tastes 100% better for this recipe.  I like to make rice for the side dish and then spoon the extra sauce over the top.  So good!

I love this recipe. The first time I made it I baked it with all the sauce in the pan. The fish was really well flavoured but the pan was a mess to clean. The second time I took the fish completely out of the marinade then boiled and thickened the extra marinade on the stove and served it with the fish. It worked great.

This recipe was simple and delicious!  Restaurant results, quick preparation, and no fuss baking.  Thank you!  It was wonderful.

My spin on the recipe included adding 1/8 tsp of ground ginger and substituting sugar-free maple syrup for a lower calories alternative.

This was super quick and easy - I was able to make it with a baby on my hip, always a plus... I wish I would have marinated it a bit longer. I cooked it on the grill and I loved the marinade, but the flavor was not very intense after only a half hour marinating.

Really liked this one.  It is a sweeter glaze but if the fish is thicker it doesn't overpower the salmon taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I was a person who always made salmon one way and never deviated. This recipe has made me change my mind about that! This is a wonderful recipe and everyone I have served it to has LOVED it. It's light and very tasty, while being very easy to make at the same time. We made it one time using cedar planks for cooking and it was fabulous!

I cooked this for my kids ages 3 to 8 and they loved it.  The 3 year old asked for  more.  This has become an easy staple in our house.  I have marinated the salmon overnight instead of for the hour like the recipe suggests!  It turned out fantastic!!!

This was such a great recipe.  My friend served it to me at a party, and I had to serve it at a party the next week!  Just remember to scale the recipe for the amount of salmon you are cooking, or your marinade will end up short!

Absolutely loved this! I'm a big fan of salmon to begin with, but this was fabulous and so simple, easy and quick. I've made it three times now, once in the toaster oven and each time it came out perfect.  Great recipe, have recommended to many people who also ended up loving it!

Great recipe--quick and easy to prepare, nice flavor.  My husband and kids loved it.  Will certainly make it again.  I used real maple syrup, not the "fake" stuff, btw, made a perfect glaze.

This was delicious! My daughter loved it as did my 4 yr old grandson. I did not have garlic salt so did not use. I had it with brown rice and  a green salad for a perfect nutritious meal.  Since I usually cook only for myself, I used 2 Tablespoons of maple syrup and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. I used real maple syrup which I think is important for the subtle taste of this dish. Thank you for a great recipe

Totally scrumptious! I agree with other reviews -- skip the garlic salt. I did. This dish is salty enough with the soya sauce.

I made this just the other day and it was quite good.  I didn't have any soy sauce so I made it with teriyaki...which obviously worked out fine b/c it tasted great.  It's definitely easy enough for a novice like myself.  I did âboil-a-bagâ rice and served it with layered pea pods under the salmon.  It's most certainly going to become a regular at my place.

I had 1.75 lb of salmon and the only thing I changed on the marinade was using only 3 tablespoons of oil and this was a perfect amount of marinade. I marinaded it for a half hour in a pyrex dish and then baked it for 25 minutes without using foil. Worked out just fine!

This recipe was good for salmon; I'm just not a salmon fan.  I try it every which way because I know it's good for me but... Thanx for the recipe, though.  It was a nice variation.

A very good recipe.  I accidentally used teriyaki sauce instead of soy, but it turned out really well despite the change!  I also tried adding a bit of Worchestshire sauce last time, and that was good too!  One of my husband's favorite meals, though sometimes a bit sweet for me (but this might be due to the teriyaki sauce substitution).

Delicious!! 
My sister emailed me this recipe..
We also remove salmon from marinade and pat topside only into cracked pepper to coat. Place fillets, pepper side up, on foil. 
Yummy!!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  I didn't like it at all, but I am chalking this up to a dislike of salmon, which I didn't know I had.

This recipe was great.  My family does not like to eat fish but decided to make this since it has a sweet marinade.  Needless to say, the whole fish was eaten!  I took the advice of deleting garlic salt and added the fresh ginger.  I also used lite maple syrup and less sodium soy sauce and it was just wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.  This one will be a favorite!

This is so easy and tastes great!  I usually try and marinate it all day.  I also like to make an extra batch of the marinade and heat it and serve it over some rice.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I made this for a special dinner for my parents. Everyone raved about it, even my children! It was light, but very flavorful and everyone went for seconds. Definitely a keeper! Oh, I used sugar free maple syrup and it was still delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is very good.  After reading some of the other suggestions about adding the grated fresh ginger.  Also, the marinade is very good on other seafood.  I marinated some shrimp along with the salmon and grilled both.  EXCELLENT too.

Guests had not had salmon before and really enjoyed it.  I thought it was good, but prefer less sweet, more spice.  Still good.  I just don't care for sweet fish.

I'm with the vast majority on this one. While it was tasty, there wasn't much flavor. I wasn't wanted the flavor to be overpowering, but for marinade that smelled that good, I wanted it to be a little more in the fish. I even tried marinading it in aluminum foil and then basting it over the salmon frequently while cooking. Not as impressive as I expected for the rating.

I did not like this recipe as much as most people (and I am kind of a sweet-tooth)  I think it lacked "something".  It turned out well, however. To me, it was just so-so.

Very easy to put together and it looked and tasted fabulous!  My hubby commented that next time we should double the sauce/marinade mixture and marinate it longer or baste as it bakes.  Very good maple flavor and moist.

VERYYYYYY GOOD! So tasty and easy. I served with asparugus and rice and our plates were licked clean. I added horseradish as others suggested and it was a perfect blend. I marinated the salmon for a couple hours. I would probaly use just a tad LESS maple syrup but with the horseradish it was heavenly!

FABULOUS! EXCELLENT! GREAT! This was so fast to do and great tasting.  My boyfriend hates salmon, but because of a cancer scare accepted salmon as part of our weekly meals.  He wanted me to rate it a 10.  I baked it 15 min because I like my salmon med/rare.  It was perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was greatly appreciated.

Very simple to prepare and I found it added a great taste to the salmon.
I will certainly use this recipe and pass it on to friends.

i really enjoyed this dish. I have just recently ate salmon for the first time, and decided to try it at home. It was so easy, and tasted awesome as well. It is definitely going to be made at my home again. The only bad thing is the cost of the Real Maple Syrup ($15 a bottle.) Which I am willing to deal with, as it is a pretty big bottle and should last awhile.

This was excellent and will become a staple recipe for me.  I did marinate the fish for about 3 to 4 hours.  I will probably do longer next time.

My husband and I love it.  It's a great glaze for salmon.  I did wrap it in tinfoil and let it marinate. I also cooked it in the tinfoil still wrapped for 15min and then opened it and cooked for an add'l 7min.  If you like sweet stuff then this is the way to go!!

This was a very easy recipe to make however my family did not like it at all. They tasted the sauce then out of left field they tasted the salmon. It didn't mesh well. However they did like the sauce drizzled over their brown rice.

This was yummy. I used lower sodium soy sauce and lite syrup (low calorie). It might have been 5 stars if I used the regular ingredients, but I'm willing to sacrifice a little taste to lighten it up a bit.

Firstly, my family really liked this salmon recipe. The marinate gave the fish a really nice glaze.
But the next time, I would probably let it sit in the marinate for even longer as the taste didn't quite get into the insides of the salmon.
Nonetheless, great recipe! =)

Very good salmon recipe.  I think it needed a little more kick though.  I will try what others suggested and add a little red pepper.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I don't normally like maple but it was a nice compliment with the soy sauce.

This recipe was pretty good, slightly bland.  I think next time it needs to marinate longer and have a splash of red pepper to give it a small kick.

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've ever tried - and I've tried many. The only thing I'd do different next time is marinate it longer. Thanks for a winner!

I had my doubts about this recipe, but I tried it because of all the great reviews.  It was EXCELLENT!!  The sweetness of the maple syrup balances the richness of the salmon, giving it a nice glaze and a delicious flavor.  We'll be making this often!

I sprinkled the salmon with steak seasoning first and let the flavors soak into the salmon for an hour in the fridge. Then, I poured the sauce on the salmon and baked it for 15 minutes and used a baster to put the sauce back on the fish. I baked it for another 20 minutes. It was a big piece of salmon. It was delicious and my husband agreed.

Just great! It was a big hit in my house. It is easy to make and takes no time at all. I added half a small lemon to the marinade and thought it gave it a lighter taste but great without too.

This is a fabulous recipe!  Simple to prepare and absolutely delish!  I was looking for a salmon with glaze recipe that bakes in the oven as opposed to on a grill and I hit the jackpot with this one.  I've made it for company now twice (in the span of a week and a half!) and have had serious rave reviews!

This was a "pretty good" salmon recipe. I think for best results, you should marinade it over-night. One thing that bothered me a bit was that all the maple syrup really takes away from the inherent healthfulness of salmon...oh well

This was good, very good, but not the absolute best salmon recipe.  I will give it the benefit of the doubt though and it might have been the cut of salmon I used.  I have been looking for a maple sauce that browns and crusts a bit and this didn't, but again it might have been my cooking technique and not the recipe.  But it was very good, but I will keep looking for that perfect one!

This recipe was pretty good but didn't have that wow factor I was looking for.  I think I will try marinating it for longer next time.  Overall a nice way to have salmon.

This salmon was delicious.  I used two cloves of garlic and omitted the garlic salt and added pecans like some others suggested.  Also we cooked it on heavy duty foil.  Easy cleanup!

I was concerned by some of the reviews that stated it was sweet because I really like the flavor of salmon and wanted to make sure you could still taste what you were eating. I took the advice of other reviewers and added fresh lemon juice and marinated it for five hours and thought it was fabulous!

This was good!  I tried it twice, once marinating for two hours then again marinating it overnight.  My only issue is that when I marinated it overnight, the marinade only penetrated the top layer of the fish so the flavor didn't go all the way through (which I would have liked).  That is probably more to do with how I marinated than anything though (I've never marinated fish before).  Also the maple flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked, but I also used grade a medium instead of dark, so that might have had something to do with it.  I'll definitely try this again and keep tweaking until I find the right way to do it for me.  Overall a great recipe though, I definitely wouldn't have thought to prepare it this way!  Thanks!

I doubled this so we could have leftovers.  The flavor was OK.  If you prefer salmon well done, then this needs to bake for 25-28 minutes, depending on how thick the salmon slices are.

I had given up on making salmon because it just never turned out right...until I tried this recipe.  I allowed it to marinade for about 3 hours.  Next time I think I will also make a sauce for the side, though...just for that extra oompf!
It was wonderful...not the best I've ever had, but definitely wonderful.  We WILL make this again!

This was delicious...though next time I'll let the salmon marinate a bit longer.  I wrapped the fish and marinade in a foil packet before baking which made it very moist.  I'll definitely make this again.

5 stars. Not too sweet either. I doubled the marinade (since I used two large salmon steaks), added an extra clove of garlic, and left out the garlic salt. Boyfriend gave it 2 thumbs up. This one's a keeper.

Has the potential to be wonderful: Though the flavor was delicious,it didn't permeate into the thickest part of the fish. And not the moistest salmon I've had either. Also, in reading the other reviews in retrospect, I personally didn't have any problems with clean up. But I used corningware.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was delicious.  I had friends for dinner and they loved it.  One of my friend was hesitant to taste it because she doesn't like the after taste of salmon. But she liked this one.

This was very good, but just a little too sweet for my tastes. I made this for a romantic dinner for our 14th anniversary, and my husband really liked it. But I think he would have preferred something more savory. Still, it made a great meal, and there were NO complaints that night! :-D

I'm a new cook who loves to cook but is timid about messing up and this recipe was PERFECT!  It was super easy and didn't require a lot of attention.  I got off of work, whipped up the marinade and was able to relax while it cooked!  My family loved it and I am no longer timid! This recipe is a keeper... everyone wanted seconds!

My first time cooking salmon.  My husband doesn't like fish so I used the same recipe for chicken.  I loved the salmon and he loved the chicken.  I will add walnuts to the chicken next time just to dress up the presentation a bit.  Great recipe.

Good, easy to make.  The flavor was very subtle.  My maple syrup was Grade A medium amber; I bet this recipe would turn out better with dark amber.

This was delicious. We marinated the salmon for 2 hours before baking. It was sweet and so filling. This one will be made again and again.

This was great!! I was a bit skeptical, especially since I didn't have enough maple syrup, and I ended up using maple and butter syrup, but it came out just perfect. I left the salmon in the oven a bit longer than suggested just so the thin sides would carmelize some more. This was a hit with my fiance... he says I could serve this at any restaurant.

I used this for Steal Head Trout and it was incredible, I thought it would be too sweet but it wasn't at all. The flavor was so different that I will try this with chicken next.  It was easy to do for a weeknight and very little mess.

really good, but i used pancake maple syrup and the salmon wasn't as glazed as i wanted it to be. I would really recommend to to use actual real maple syrup for the best outcome.

Simple, easy, and VERY, VERY GOOD! I was skeptical at first because of the simplicity of this recipe but it was amazing. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out great. I made some extra sauce to drizzle over the salmon when it was done. Awesome recipe if you don't have a grill.I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!!  I never dared to eat salmon before.  When I saw this recipe had maple syrup, I decided to dare.  I now love salmon!  I am saving this recipe for our annual Christmas eve dinner with our closest friends.

This tasted excellent. I doubled the recipe since I had a bigger salmon steak, and put everything in a ziplock bag for a few hours. The salmon came out great and flaky, and the tastes all were just perfect.

Just one more vote for terrific.  Unusual for me to make a dish exactly like the recipe, but this one seemed right.  And it was!  We loved it.  Used chicken cutlet (very thin chicken breast) for the no-fish eater, cooked the cutlet for 17-18 minutes.  It was wonderful, too.  Thanks, Starflower.

My sister found this recipe a few years ago... Love it!  When marinading the salmon, using a zip lock bag works really well.  The salmon is coated in the marinade and you can turn it very easily.

I used Pollock and marinated overnight. It tasted much more like a teriyaki sauce than maple. If I was going to try this again, I would halve the soy sauce. I doubt we will try this again, although I was really excited about finding a maple fish recipe. :-(

I don't normally like to eat salmon, but I actually didn't mind eating this at all.  My boyfriend loves salmon and gets it almost all the time when we go out to eat and he actually said that this tasted better than what he gets at a nice restaurant.  The only downfall to this recipe was the sauce gets stuck to the baking pan and you have to soak the pan right away and still scrub pretty hard to get it clean.  But the salmon tasted so good that the extra effort in cleaning is worth it.  :-)

The sauce seemed to overpower the flavor of the salmon- hence i gave it two stars originally, but since Hubby, who detests fish, loved it and asked me to make it again, that jumped it up to four.  It's my way of weaning Him into healthier eating, though this is fairly high in sugar. Served with my own version of green beans, and over a bed of rice.

This was easy to make and delicious.  We eat salmon often and this was the best salmon I have had in a long time...I marinated the salmon for 2 hours and as the salmon was quite thick I cooked it for about 35 minutes.

I have never made Salmon before.  I selected this recipe for a dinner party for 4 couples.  I bought 4 pounds of salmon and scaled the recipe to 4x.  I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated overnight and lined the dishes with foil (new Reynolds Release non-stick foil).  This was amazingly easy.  Exactly 20 minutes and it was perfect!  Everyone raved about it saying it was the best Salmon they had ever had.

This was wonderful.  We aren't big fish people, but my husband and I both loved this.  The flavor was so good, I think next time I'll double the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Heres a tried and true !I made this with fresh caught coho salmon /full fillet wrapped in heavey foil twice .Then turned it a few over an outdoor woodburning fire pit at the campsite!I doubled the marinate because the fish was a good 8 pounder!After cleaning and gutting the coho salmon, I just poured the marinate inside and sealed with foil !All the other fisher/ campers agreed it was the best! Very few times can you find one that will work for fish over an open wood camp fire !PHENOMINAL and no mess to clean never used a pan or roaster!Made twice since excellent !!!!

This recipe was easy and very tasty.  The second time I made it i made some changes and used honey and scamp instead of maple syrup and salmon.  It was very good this way also!

I grilled the salmon in foil with the marinade instead of baking it. It was the delicious and easy to clean up. Best salmon recipe.

I marinated overnight... and it could have been longer.  The outsides of the fillets were tasty, but the insides just tasted like fish.  The sauce is good, though.  Maybe I should have poured all the marinade over the fish, then baked them?  I like salmon at restaurants -- what I am doing wrong??

This was great!  I substituted sugar-free syrup which probably made the mixture a little thin, but it was still very good!  Thank you for the recipe.  We'll definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I made this for my family and guests for a special get-together and everyone LOVED it - even those who didn't think they really cared for salmon.  I told my co-worker about it and she had to try it too.  We both think this recipe is worth 6 stars - and she likes it cold too!

This recipe was AWESOME.  My boyfriend raved about it, saying it was the best salmon he had this year.  It was really easy to make; I marinated it for about 7 hours.  The sauce is a bit sweet so if you don't like sweet, you may not like it as much.  It's a WAY better flavor than teriyaki.  I would definately make this one again!

Fabulous flavor! I didn't deviate from the recipe except for the fact thta I added a splash of orange juice because the maple mixture seemed awfully thick. Although I didn't really detect the orange flavor in the cooked fish it was absolutely wonderful! My family couldn't stop talking about how great it smelled! :)
Went really well with steamed white rice and broccoli.

Very good change of pace for salmon. I cooked mine on the grill and it came out great. Basted several times with marinade. Will be a regular at our house.

I am not a huge fan of salmon but it is good for me so... But I loved this. It was excellent. It will definitely be something I cook on a regular basis. I actually made it with frozen salmon fillets so I am sure fresh must be even better. A great and simple recipe. Thanks!

Wow!  So quick, easy, and tasty!  I never would have thought that those ingredients could be so delicious together.  This is definitely my favorite salmon recipe so far.
