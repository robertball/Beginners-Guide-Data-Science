I was really surprised when I found this recipe.. it's almost EXACTLY like the one I make. The only difference is I use 1 full teaspoon of all of the spices and only two eggs. I also serve it with cream cheese frosting.. it's always gone over GREAT.

This cake is amazing! I have to admit I've never made it with this frosting I always use "Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting" found also on the wonderful website. I can't tell you how many times I've made it for many different people and it's always a hit.

It tasted good but it looked scary when it was done. I don't think I beat the frosting enough even though I did it for 40 minutes. So after I frosted the cake it looked very frothy an hour later. Two 9" pans work well with this recipe I would just use different frosting.:)

I tried this recipe with the Cream Cheese Frosting II (basic) with 1 tsp cinnamon. It tastes really great with the extra spice added.

It's a little dry but would make it again using the frosting as a filler as well. To the person that took 40 minutes for the frosting you must have had some egg yoke mixed in with the white of the egg. If that happens start again because no amount of whipping will make the yokes stiff.

This recipe was a failure. It smelled bette than it tasted. It didn't have enough taste to it. I thought it was bad but maybe it's an aquired taste.

The frosting would go nice on a regular cake but not like a bundt cake as shown the frosting is creative but the cake tastes very bland. I agree witht he review that said it smells good when baking the taste leaves a LOT to be desired.

I did not care for this recipe. It came out flat so i figured id cut it in half and make a layered cake and i tried a piece but did not care for the taste. I am a baker who prefers handful and dash to cup and teaspoon but i know spice cakes are tricky so i followed it EXACTLY. the only thing this recipe was good for was the frosting.

Made this last night. Followed the recipe as given. Once cooled I double wrapped in plastic to ice today. Iced them and.sliced it this evening after dinner. Dry. It is definitely not a cake to eat unloved or just dusted with powdered sugar. Next time I'll add more butter.

I love the cake. I needed to cook it an additional 10 minutes. I did not like the frosting offered with the recipe. I only used one egg white.. I loved the actual cake. I would change the icing next time. maybe a maple glaze.

This is bar far THE MOST requested cake in my house. Its moist and delicious. I use cream cheese frosting and add more cinnamon because I always add more cinnamon to any recipe that has it in it. Everyone loves it.
