WONDERFUL!!! My family couldn't tell the difference between this and "store bought" syrup. I did not have maple flavoring so I just used 2 TBL butter instead..tasted GREAT! I added the extra brown sugar for thicker syrup and I think that next time I wont...but it was good with or without!! WILL MAKE AGAIN!! "Trust in the LORD with all your heart"-Proverbs 3:5

I can't have high fructose corn syrup and real maple syrup is soooo expensive for a big family so we tried this, it was great.  We even made it once using vanilla instead of maple flavoring.  That was very good.

This is excellent. The same exact recipe Mom made for syrup when I was a kid. For those who use Splenda instead of sugar, you can substitute Splenda and Splenda brown sugar blend for both the white and brown sugars. I like to use half and half of maple flavoring and butter flavoring so it mimics the butter-flavored syrup in the grocery stores. Once you make this, you won't ever go back to the stuff in the bottle.

Tasted delicious, but was too thin. I cooked it for about 25 minutes to get a thicker syrup. I also added two tablespoons of butter.

I added 1/8 tsp cornstarch to the sugars before mixing in the water to give a thicker syrup.  Also, a few people wondered why it turned to crystalized sugar, the longer you cook it the more it turns to crystalized sugar. Only cook it the length of time in the recipe.  Rock candy is made by cooking sugar/water for a long time.

Very quick and easy.  I could not find maple flavoring, so the first time I made it I used 1 tablespoon vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  This time I used a tablespoon of imitation rum.  We really like it, it saves us money, and no high fructose corn syrup.  I never thought it would be so easy to make it homemade, and the flavor options are endless.

I rated it a 5 for the good flavor, but especially for the simplicity.  It's easy to whip up a batch in no time.  You know what's in it, no unhealthy ingredients like store bought syrup.  The cost is just pennies and you can change it up by changing the flavorings.  My favorite is vanilla.

EXCELLENT- will never buy store-bought-mystery-ingredient-syrup again!
I used 1/2 the recipe proportions, and added 1 Tablespoon of real pure maple syrup for the flavor(grade B, labeled "For Cooking Only") then I poured it into a perfect little jelly jar!! YUM!
..FYI on the pure maple syrup-- I bought a little jar at a specialty Maple Store.. about $11 for a little jar-- it is BETTER than maple extract!!! and more natural!!  I used this over the maple extract!
FYI the lighter the color of maple syrup, the sweeter it is.. the darker the maple syrup, the more maple-flavor it is.

Maple is one of my favorite flavors(right along with chocolate, coconut and vanilla) and this syrup is perfect! It tastes so much like real maple syrup with out costing as much! I love pancakes, but never make them because I can't stand store bought pancake syrups. Now, that problem is solved!!

After making pancakes for breakfast I realized I didn't have any maple or pancake syrup left. I tried this recipe. It was as expected. It tasted much like dark corn syrup. It resembled nothing of maple syrup or even the store bought pancake syrup. In a pinch it sufficed, but I will probably not make this again.

This is TERRIFIC!!!  Used all white sugar and it tastes almost exactly like real maple syrup!  Next time I'll try it with brown and white sugar.  I will warn you though, if you're recycling a bottle that had store bought syrup in it, let the syrup cool before putting it in the bottle.  Mine melted and then I had a "DUUUUUUUUHHHH!  That was stupid!" moment.  :)

This is close to our recipe.  I love the brown sugar.  It seems to be more of a rich tasting syrup.

This is absolutely wonderful!!! I did not have maple extract, I substituted vanilla and 1 tbsp of butter.  Used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1 1/2 cup of brown sugar and boiled 20 mins to thicken up to consistency of my liking.  Will never ever, ever buy store bought syrup again! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I just made this and LOVE it. Only change I made was to use one and a half cups of brown sugar and half cup of white sugar. So much better than ANYTHING store bought!
On another note: Does anyone know if this has to be refrigerated??

This recipe saved my daughter's birthday sleep-over.  Making pancakes for the girls' I realized NO SYRUP!!!!  Ugghhhh!  Thankfully I found this recipe and the girls loved it.  I added a tsp. of butter and a cinnamon stick:)  Cooked longer to try and thicken it up and it its cooling off the burner as we speak and I suspect it will thicken up even more.

Made strawberry syrup! Reduced water to 1/2 cup, pureed, in blender, one bag of partially thawed/frozen strawberries - 12 oz. (it was a very thick mixture), used 2 cups of brown sugar and 1/2 teasoon of almond extract. Followed cooking recipe to a tee. Let cool. There was a small amount of sludge on the top of the syrup, but it was very easy to skim off. I will try mixed berries next time!

As others have said, we will never buy syrup again! We loved flavored syrup and it's so expensive. What a find!

My kids used the last of the pancake syrup without telling me.  I knew I had this recipe saved, so I gave it a try and it was fantastic!  I don't care for maple, so I used vanilla and rum extracts, about 2 tsp of each.  The flavor was phenomenal and I love the fact that there's no corn syrup in this.  No more store-bought pancake syrup in this house!

I've been making this for years and everytime no one believes it's homemade!  I add 1 Tablespoon of butter flavor and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and my family loves it.  You can use other flavorings to suit your tastes!  To make it a thicker texture I add 1-2 tablespoons of corn starch disolved in cold water and add it after I'm done boiling the syrup!

No more store bought syrup for me...this was delicious on our pancakes.We all agreed this was better than Mrs Butterworths.The syrup thickened up perfectly after it cooled a bit and I cooked it for the exact time given.I did follow one reviewers suggestion of adding 1/8 tsp of cornstarch and I guess that helped thicken it.I also added just a tiny bit of vanilla along with the maple extract.I couldn't get over how delicious this syrup was..much better than I expected.It's so good warm on pancakes!

I've always made a version of this maple syrup because my mother did this.  You can get a lot of syrup out of one little bottle of maple flavoring. It keeps forever in the fridge and I just microwave what I'm going to use to take the chill off.  Very economical.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid. I don't use the white sugar just 2 cups of brown. My kids love the flavor and I love that there is no High Fructose Corn Syrup.

This is a great recipe to use but I boil it longer than the 3 minutes it calls for.  i have a candy thermometer so I boil until it hits the syrup stage, which makes it thicker if you do this.  I use vanilla instead of maple flavoring and it is great.  For an added touch you can add 2T of butter for that taste as well.

Simple, quick, and delicious! I used 1 tbsp butter, and 2 tsp of molasses, instead of maple flavoring. My family loved it!

We make this all the time in our house now. Once you have this stuff, you won't go back to that store-bought thick brown glue. I can't believe some reviewers were actually disappointed that it didn't taste like store-bought. This is way better and probably much healthier for you. The recipe is so simple, we all have it memorized. You can control how thick your syrup is by how long you simmer on the stove - cook longer for a thicker syrup. BUT be aware that a thicker syrup will also become more crystalized after a few days. We usually go for thinner so we lose less of our syrup to rock candy. We increase the recipe by 50% and add a dash of both maple and vanilla at the end. I also add a dash or two of salt at the beginning; seems to give it more depth.

I have tried this a few times. The way it's written (minus imitation maple-read the label), with suggestions of other (longer cooking time, additions of vanilla, butter) and this recipe is just *meh*. I've been looking for a replacement for store bought. I don't care for the price, watery quality or inconsistent flavor of "real" maple syrup. I will keep looking for another recipe. By the way, despite the recommendation to cook longer for thicker syrup, that only works if you use it right away otherwise it will just crystalize.

My kids are on the Feingold diet, which eliminates anything artificial (flavors, colors, preservatives) and the high grade maple syrup is very expensive for a household of 6. We have been using a recipe just like this for the past year minus the maple flavor. We buy 1 bottle of the high priced, good stuff and will add just a tablespoon to this recipe just before bottling. My whole family prefers it now to the chemical tasting, artificially flavored, commercially prepared stuff. Who doesnt like warm, homemade syrup on top of made from scratch pancakes with eggs that your hens laid and a glass of raw milk from your local dairy farmer? Nobosy, that's who! We all want our food as close to nature as possible. Do yourself a favor and give this recipe a shot, you won't regret it.

I ran out of syrup one pancake morning and tried this in a pinch.  My whole family loved it, even my super picky husband. I'm so excited I don't have to buy expensive syrup anymore!!

This was good, but too sweet for my family. Next time, I'll use only 1.5 cups of sugar.  I'll have to reheat this leftover syrup and dilute it with water next time we need it.

Made this in a pinch. Turned out great! Caught my five year old scooping up the syrup from his plate to eat it. This is "Mr. Picky" we're talking about, so I know this recipe is a keeper!

Due to being out of syrup a while back, I went in search of homemade syrup. We've tried several, all of which we liked, BUT this one we loved!! It's perfect:) So simple, yet so much better than store bought. Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!! ***Made again with sugar in the raw...even better than before!!***

In the past we've always used real maple syrup, but didn't quite have enough this morning so we made this. It's fabulous. The flavor is almost as good as maple syrup, and I'm going to use it a lot more in the future. Maple syrup is pretty thin, but if you are used to something thicker, like Aunt Jemima, you might want to add 2 TBS of cornstarch to the sugar and mix well before you whisk in the water. It thickens as it cools.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I tried it because I was curious as to how homemade syrup would come out, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have any maple extract, so I used the suggestion of others and added 2 Tbs. of butter and a little vanilla extract.  It was really good.  I made the fluffy pancakes this morning (from this site) and used the syrup.  The two paired together so well.  Thank you.  this was a nice change of pace from the store bought stuff we are used to.

This was a quick and easy syrup to make. It was my first attempt at homemade pancake syrup and I was very happy with the results! Reading the other reviews and suggestions I decided to add butter and vanilla extract since I didn't have maple. The flavor was quite good, however I think next time I'll skip the vanilla for a more "store bought" taste.  I will definitely make this again!   A little side note; some other reviews said it was too runny. I'd bet they reviewed it before the syrup had cooled. It does seem really runny when you first poor it out of the pot, but it thickens as it cools. It was the perfect consistency!!

This IS NOT maple syrup. It is PANCAKE syrup. It is faux, ersatz, fake maple syrup. Maple syrup is made from maple sap and nothing else. 
This may well be really good pancake syrup however, I question the need to bother making it as it can be purchased cheaply.

Mine didn't resemble anything like syrup. It looked good, but as soon as the temp dropped to a degree that was somewhere near edible, it crystallized to the point there it was not pour-able. I mean, the flavor was still fine, but it seemed more like you were making some kind of glaze rather than syrup because it hardened on my pancakes and made them crispy.

Love this!! So simple to make and tastes so good! No more store bought syrup in this house! Added a bit of butter to push it over the top. Finger licking good. 
Store it in the fridge and microwave just enough to take the chill off before using.

This is a great recipe.  I make it for my Mom who doesn't like Maple flavoring.  Years ago, there was a brand of syrup called "Tea Garden Drips."  My Mom loved it and they stopped making it.  I make this recipe/syrup with butter and vanilla and it tastes just like she remembers.  I use 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of water and after boiling, I add the butter and vanilla.  Yum!  My family likes the maple flavoring.

I've been making this syrup for years and use different flavors depending on what I've made.  Maple for pumpkin waffles, coconut syrup for banana pancakes and so on.  Great alternative for the store bought so called "syrup" goop.

I came up with this exact same recipe and I think it's much better than the recipe on the back of the maple flavoring box!  Tastes as good, if not better, than store-bought, and is "healthier" than store-bought, if that's the right word!

This is so easy I can do it while the pancakes are being made.  Even my kids request this over the brands we used to buy.  I add just a tablespoon of butter once I turn the heat off.

perfect!  Saved me when I had four hungry boys, a stack of pancakes and a 1/4 inch of syrup in the bottom of the bottle!  It was so fast and easy I may start doing it this way from now on!  Cheaper and no corn syrup.

My god this was amazing! In fact my family and I finished most of it in one night(breakfast for dinner day) needless to say this was just as good as my mothers recipe I did add a small amount of butter so i balanced it out with a bit more sugar. Thats only because my husband likes buttery syrup. This is the first good review i have given in a while. Im picky, a great cook, and expect a certain level of quality for my food. To the creator of this recipe please direct me to more of your recipes this was amazing!

Excellent.  But consider adding 1/8th Tsp SALT!  Tempers the sweetness (plus most bottled ones include salt as well).

So simple, so cheap, so great. This is how great this stuff is: My 11 year old started licking her plate after all the pancakes were gone (not that I condone such behavior, but I understand), my 6 year old syrup snob couldn't tell the difference between this and store bought, and my 4 year old followed his 11 year old sister's lead.

its pretty good. had no maple extract so i used 2 tbs butter. i would recommend maybe only using 1 and a half tbs butter - has a "hot" taste i didnt rly enjoy. after adding the butter w turn down low, simmer for the 3 minutes, and WAIT after the concoction gets frouthy and dies down before turning down the fire

Very good flavor, I added 1/4 cup of butter and a pinch of salt to this recipe.  It was very thin, but the flavor was good....doubt I'll be buying syrup from the store anymore! Its way less expensive to make your own!

Very good - made it with orange extract and liked it.  Next time I will try it with the maple extract.  It was extremely sweet so you only had to use a small amount.

I've never made syrup before and this was super simple and had a great taste. I also love that it doesn't use corn syrup. I actually like it a little runnier cause then it absorbs into the pancakes and french toast a lot easier. I also just substituted vanilla extract for the maple :)

This recipe saved our Christmas morning!  I didn't have the maple flavoring on hand, but added 2 TBS of light butter and 1 TBS of vanilla instead.  It was quite good and saved us some of the less desirable ingredients found in store bought syrup!  Thank you!

I added about 1 Tablespoon butter.   It's pretty liquidy so I think we increase the brown sugar ratio next time to get it a little thicker.  We are going to start making our own syrup, it was great and so easy!

My husband gave me the "look".  He said it was tasty, but I know what that means for him.  He did mention it had good flavor, but he prefers the familiarity of the store bought bottle in front of him.  So I had to resort to the leftover bottle I had from CB.

Not maple syrup but it is really good and a lot cheaper.  I remember making this recipe when I was a teenager.  We couldn't afford real maple syrup or even store bought.  It lasts for quite a while in the frig.   I did add a butter extract to it the last time and it gave it a little bit of a creamy taste.  I will keep making this syrup.

3 Tbsp of maple extract is too much - I ended up doubling all the other ingredients to balance the flavor.  Next time I will start with 1 tsp of maple and test taste at that point.

Made this for my girls and to go with our cake batter pancakes, it was delicious.  I didn’t have the maple flavoring, so I substituted vanilla and added two tablespoons of butter.  Best syrup I’ve tried in a long time because it’s not too sweet!  Con

This was wonderful.  I served it to some guests and they were all oohing over it.  It is thin as the recipe is written, which is typical of homemade syrup.  There is a tip on the recipe to double the brown sugar for a thicker consistency.  I will try that next time.  But it is delicious as is.  Definitely using this one again.

Maybe my idea of syrup is different than most, but I thought this  the syrup made by the recipe was much to thin. I did sub vanilla extract for the maple extract, but that wouldn't change the consistency. I started out by adding 1/8 tsp. corn starch as suggest by other reviews, and after 5 minutes of simmering, it was still water and thin. Then I tried adding an additional 1 tsp. of cornstarch, and after simmering 10 minutes, this helped some. The  flavor of this syrup is very good, but it's a lot thinner and runnier than any syrup I have ever had. I didn't try adding butter, but I don't believe that would thicken the consistency.  I don't think I will make this one again.

Tastes just like store bought pancake syrup, if not BETTER...when you add a few things. I recommend adding 2 tbl of butter, maple extract and vanilla extract  and adding cornstarch to thicken. Make it the day before you want to use the syrup and let it thicken overnight in the fridge, find a bottle to put it in, keep it refrigerated. Never buying store bought syrup lol. PLUS there are so many things you can do with it!

If it is crystallizing, you are cooking it too long. Don't leave bad reviews if you don't know how to cook lol.

After reading ingredients on pancake syrup labels, I couldn't bring myself to buy any of them (I mean, cellulose gum? Hexametaphosphates? Artificial flavors?). But this recipe...I used the two cups of brown sugar and vanilla extract... came out great!  It's the right thickness, plenty sweet enough, and considering how little is actually poured onto pancakes, any lack of real maple flavor isn't noticeable.  Took 10 minutes, cost a fraction of what even the cheapest brand of syrup costs, and I'm very happy with it!

I made it according to the exact measurements, even though I used considerably more extract.  It is very dark and "rich" with a bold flavor, but was really good. May play with the measurements the next time we make it.

I loved this syrup so much! I had tried making syrup on my own a few times, "free styling" the measurements, and it always came out great while hot, but as soon as it cooled down, became hard as rock. So I googled how to make syrup, and came upon this recipe, and put it to use.  I followed the directions with the following changes: instead of two cups of white sugar, I used one cup white, one cup dark brown, and instead of just one tablespoon of maple extract, I used that in addition to one tablespoon of butter extract. I saw the footnote and will certainly use 2 (and a half maybe) cups dark brown sugar next time as I love a thick syrup. I love it dark in color as well, so I especially look forward to the 2 cups dark brown for next time. This is my first time successfully making syrup and it was a hit! My daughter and I loved it, which is a big deal because she's only used to store bought. The long and the short of it is, make this syrup, follow the directions, and you'll be happy to avoid high fructose corn syrup and chemicals. Big Mahaloz! ??

Good recipe.  Consistency was good.  The flavor was OK, could have used more maple.
Next time I make it, I'll use 1.5 cups brown sugar and 1.5 tablespoons of maple extract.  Thicker and a bit more maple flavor.

There is nothing better than indulging in pancakes with this warm syrup every once in awhile. My mom used to make this when I was growing up. We never used store bought. To this day store bought syrup doesn't taste anywhere as good as syrup made with this recipe.

This is a great base recipe. I added vanilla instead of maple because I don't have any maple. And I added butter because I like butter. I'm planning on reading through the comments though to see what other changes and ideas others have made. Like maybe a strawberry syrup or something...

I've been making this syrup for over a year now, I've made it three different ways: 2 cups brown sugar, 2 cups white sugar and then 1 cup white and 1 cup brown as the recipe is written. By far the best one is 2 cups brown sugar. It's thicker, richer and tastes better. I have even made the recipe on the back of the maple syrup extract bottle and it's definitely NOT as good as this recipe. I don't change this recipe or add anything to it, except for the 2 cups brown sugar and it's perfect the way it is.

I added 2 Tbl butter after I removed the syrup from heat. Makes all the difference in the world! Also added about 1/8 tsp of cream of tarter to thicken up the sauce while it simmered. Last time I made it, I had run out of maple extract. We live in Europe where I can't buy more... I substituted with 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp rum extract. Still very good!

I didn't have any maple so I used vanilla and added an extra cap full as well. It was thin but I will make it again and try adding an extra cup of brown sugar to make it a little thicker. It was tremendously delicious!!! My kids loved it!!

Great recipe, but only needs 1 teaspoon maple flavor, it is too strong and dark with 1 tablespoon!!    Tastes like store syrup without the artificial ingredients, doesn't taste like pure maple syrup.

I made this syrup and love it.  The tablespoon of flavoring  is more than most recipes but more is better  with this one.  Most of them call for a tsp.  I cooked it  for about 15 mn. This would make  great syrup of any flavor and could just use all white syrup instead of the brown.( I'm  thinking strawberry). After reading about the butter i wish i had added some but  still very good.

We like this syrup. I make it often.  One thing people need to realize is that when you initially cook it, it is thin and does not resemble store bought syrup.  After it cools and is refrigerated it does.  If it's too think, add some water.  You really can't mess this up.

I have decided to stop buying syrup at the store.  This is so much better and has no high fructose corn syrup.  I like to add cinnamon and a little butter to the recipe and reduce the amount of maple flavoring to a 1/2 tablespoon.

Although it thickened after cooling, it was way to sweet, not my preference but maybe for someone else.

I didn't have any maple extract, so I used raspberry extract instead. It's wonderful with blueberry pancakes!

This recipe is amazing!  Quick and simple with phenomenal results.  It has just the perfect consistency: not too runny, not too thick.  I added some vanilla extract along the the maple.  Will definitely use it again.

Wow! I scaled back the white sugars about a 1/4 cup and added brown instead. Even though I didnt have real maple extract it came out delightful. I also thicked it a bit with cornstarch.

We love this syrup!  instead of the maple flavoring, we add a capful vanilla and 1/2 cup blueberry puree.  we have even done this with strawberries and it was amazing!
If you use raw sugar, it is darker, but adds a whole new dimension to the flavor!

This is real good...I added only tp at first as misread at first had funny taste but after adding more extract it was delicious I still only added in long run 1 and 1/2 teaspoons and it was good... But I went to pour it in bottle for my super. The pan unforantly fell on my foot and their went the syrup.. Luckily had couple tb of syrup for my meal though... I will make this agin.. Plus I added 1/8 of tp of corn starch like suggested... I am uses to real maple syrup... So I could went with out it... If use to other pancake syrups you might want to add the 1/8 to possible up to 1/4 of teaspoon

I was so glad to find this recipe when I was in a pinch. Oddly I had maple extract on hand, but I used a lot more than the recipe calls for (maybe a couple tablespoons) and also added some vanilla extract. I also found the original consistency after 3 minutes to be way too thin, so I continued to cook it for another 15 mins or so. In the future if I make this again I will start it on the stove before I mix up my pancake batter, and then it would cook up to be the perfect consistency. I would guess about 25 minutes would be sufficient.

EXCELLENT!   This recipe was a pleasant surprise!  I was out of maple syrup and needed it to make candied bacon.  Coming across this recipe kept me from having to run to the store.  Once I tasted it tasted it I knew I had a winner.  Now I'm craving pancakes and waffles!   Thank you LUCYNDA for sharing your EXCELLENT recipe!

This was pretty good... if you are used to pure maple syrup you will be dissappointed if you expect it to taste like that. By itself it's not very good but when eaten on our french toast it was good. I'd say better than what you'd get with aunt jemima or mrs butters worth. I think next time I will add a bit of butter to the syrup.

It was easy!  Better than store bought!  It was a little thin but with either cooking it a little longer or cooling it would take care of that.  But we were fine with it the way it was! My whole family loved it.  Even those that usually don't use syrup!
Enjoyed the warm addition to table!  Thanks! 
(it was good enough to write this review--my first one! And I have been using this site for a few years!)

I use this recipe when I run out of syrup. If it were up to me I would make this ALL the time. My husband swears he can tell the difference. I think it is because he sees me cooking the liquid. I love this recipe! It taste just like that so-called syrup in the store. No, I actually think this syrup taste better. Try it you can't go wrong.

We have made this for years.  Real sugar thickens it better than Splenda; you can use all white sugar with fruit-flavored extracts and a little food coloring; kids love it; and if you want to experiment with thickening a sugar-free syrup, try a bit of Guar Gum, which you can buy in health food stores.  I have a feeling this IS the way they do it in the stores when it's not Vermont maple syrup.

My syrup turned to sugar in the jar! What did I do wrong? I cooked it a little longer to thicken (25 mins) and it was great last night, but this morning... I put it in the microwave to liquefy, but now it's grainy. Has this happened to anyone else? Please help!

I just made it tonight!  I added 1 Tblsp butter to it and my daughter said it smelled like panticakes (pancakes).  So that is what we are having in the morning!  So easy and so yummy.  Hmmm, maybe on some icecream...

Used 1 tsp vanilla extract in stead of maple and two tbsp butter.  I think it was a bit too much vanilla for me.  I also added about 1/4 more brown sugar to thicken it up a bit, but it didn't.  I will definitely make this again and try the maple flavoring.

We never had store bought syrup in our house growing up.  We always made a variation of this recipe with only white sugar.  This is closest to real maple syrup without spending all the money.  I looked this up to find a sub on a morning when I only had 1 cup of white sugar in the house.  Great syrup.  As far as adding vanilla and butter like others have posted I guess that might get more of the taste of store bought syrup or a flavored syrup which I don't like.  And yes, the syrup thickens as it cools.  Water to sugar raito can be changed up a bit too if you prefer less sugar, or have less on hand.  I add more maple to taste preference.

This was my 1st attempt at making syrup and this was easy and very good. Before putting it over pancakes I tasted it and I wasn't sure if I like it. It has a strong maple flavor which store bought syrup typically does not have but when I put it on the pancakes it was great. It was a bit runny but we also ate it when it was still hot.

This was very simple and tasty!  I did not have any maple flavoring, so I added about 2 tablespoons of butter, a tsp. of vanilla and a little cinnamon.  I also added a little extra brown sugar with a splash of lite karo syrup to try to thicken it up.  It was very tasty!! The kids loved it.  Thank you for the recipe!

UPDATE:  I tried it again with just 2 tbs. of butter and 1/2 vanilla bean, as suggested by another reviewer, and it was to die for!

excellent - thanks!  cooked up fine, a little runny, but that's ok.  I bit strong on the maple flavoring, but that's just for my tastes.

This is a great recipe to have on hand for those days when you want pancakes but realize you are out of syrup!  It's also a great alternative to the chemicals and corn syrup in the store bought stuff.  When making this recipe I assumed the syrup would taste like store bought "fake" syrup, but I actually think it tasted more like real maple syrup.  The recipe is great as is, but it would be fun to experiment as others have done by adding butter or vanilla or more brown sugar.  Give this recipe a try and I'm sure you'll like it.
