For CROCK POT:  Saute onions, garlic & bell pepper in oil (+ add ~TBSP butter).  After cooking ~5 minutes, stir in flour.  Slowly add water while stirring till smooth.  Transfer to crock pot.  Add remaining ingredients.  NOTE:  I cut raw chicken breast into about three chunks each and added to crock pot (raw).  Toward the end of cooking, I shredded the chicken with fork to make it more of a stew consistancy.

We thought the stew was okay the first night. When we had leftovers for lunch the next day we were very happy to discover that it tasted much better. We will make it again and let it sit in the fridge overnight before eating it.

This is a wonderful easy and delicious recipe! The only small change I made was - instead of 2 cups of water, I used 2 cups of chicken broth. I will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely delicious, I did make a few changes I was in the mood for beef  so i used beef stew meat and cooked it with the onion and garlic, then added the sweet potato, I also added regular potatoes and red pepper its what I had in the fridge and the rest of ingredients. I added some Red Cayenne pepper to add a little more heat and added a black lemon to add a little lemon flavor it was delicious, I think next time I make this I will through in some carrots I'm a big veggie lover, the making process was a bit tough but well worth, it I will defiantly make this again!

This stew has great flavor! I loved the corn and kidney beans. I added the cilantro and lime juice to my bowl and it rounded out the flavors. The recipe is a little labor intensive but well worth the effort, especially since it only takes 15 minutes to cook.

This recipe is a fantastic twist on traditional chicken soup/stew with a mexican flare. The nutrients from the chicken, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes make it a great alternative to chicken noodle soup, especially during "cold/flu season".

Instead of dissolving the flour in 2 Tbsp. water, I used 2 Tbsp. lime juice and served each bowl with a lime wedge. The lime juice creats a delicious contrast against the cilantro. Also, I suggest using at least 1 1/2 - 2 lbs. of chicken. 1 lb. of chicken seems to get lost in all the other flavors.

Excellent Stew with a boat load of flavor.  I added about a cup of mild salsa and a teaspoon of sugar to bring out the tomato flavor.  The sweet potatoes are a nice touch, and the absorb the spices.  I will make this again.

We were very happy with this stew.  I used chicken broth instead of water, white kidney beans instead of red ones, and red bell peppers instead of orange.  The lime juice rounds out the flavors nicely.  The stew was a bit thin for my taste, so I let it simmer with lid off for another 20 min. I had so many sweet potatoes left over from thanksgiving, so this was a nice recipe to make use of them.

I made this in the crock pot and added some garden jalapenos and chili peppers for more spice. My son that should eat better and hates sweet potatoes stopped by and tried a,"little". He ended up eating two full bowls. What he liked about the recipe I didn't...you can't really taste the sweet potatoes, they taste like a regular potato. So if you are someone trying to incorporate healthy sweet potatoes into you diet, this is a great place to start. Still a great tasting stew, just add more peppers if you like spice.

Pretty good recipe.  Interesting combination of flavors.  Seemed like a lot of prep work though, so I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

The flavour of this dish was very nice, I loved the unusual blend of spices. I wanted to use this as a filling for burritoes, so I decreased the amount of liquid, using just two 10oz cans of Rotel tomatoes. After a little simmering, it thickened up nicely and made fantastic burritoes with some cheese sprinkled on top.

I loved this soup. I didn't have chicken so I used ground spicy sausage and it turned out great! I was looking forward to the leftovers but the soup never made it that far. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I had typed in to the ingredient search chicken, sweet potatoes and cilantro and this is what came up. I did use Swanson's chicken broth in place of the water,added a few shakes of Ancho Chile Powder and a generous squirt of lime juice to each serving. While I'm not big on sweet potatoes in general, I did enjoy this recipe. Very Tex-Mex tasting, hearty and flavorful, and for us, something new and interesting to do with leftover Rotisserie chicken. Served with cornbread and shredded Mexican blend cheese for topping.

This soup is delicious!!! I had some leftover yams from the holidays and when I came along this soup with all the interesting spices, I had to try it. I'm so glad I did.  Husband (who hates yams) rated it in my top 5 soup recipes.

My college aged son thought this recipe sounded good, so I finally made it.  I wasn't too sure about the cinnamon and cocoa in this recipe, but boy was I wrong!  This was delicious!  Definitely a keeper and I will make this again.  The lime and cilantro add a wonderful contrasting flavor to the sweetness of the potatoes and spices .  Served with cornbread and a whit

I made this just as written and we were really happy with the results.  The only change I'd make would be to increase the red pepper flakes by quite a bit, but we like spicy food.  Quick and easy, full of flavor, hearty and healthy - I don't know what more I could want out of a fall one-pot dinner!

Very nice.  I used leftover grilled chicken, and a little more sweet potato (actually yam) than the recipe called for, just because I didn't want to save a small portion of it.  It had a very nice flavor, but it was a little harsh, so next time will add a little sugar to bring out the sweetness of the tomatoes.  I found I did not need to add any thickener as the starch in the yams seems to have done the job.  Thanks for another addition to the recipe box!

This is really good. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and didn't use the cilantro - personal preference. I also used cubed raw chicken thighs which I sauteed with the onions. I think this would also be great with pork. Gets better every day.

Yum!   I used 5 cloves garlic; red pepper instead of orange; only 1 tsp chili powder, no red pepper flakes; added a large carrot diced; and let the veggies cook a bit longer.   Otherwise followed recipe.  Could use more spice but overall very tasty!  served over brown rice.

Can't give it a 5, because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I skipped the beans, didn't have cocoa, used chicken thighs and drumsticks instead of breasts, doubled up on the spices and sweet potatoes and only used about 14oz can of tomatoes. That said, the basic recipe was intact. And this was one of the best meals I've had in months. Can't wait to share after it's been sitting in the fridge for a night. Yum.

I made this mainly for my dad. We're both on the South Beach Diet, and he keeps buying sweet potatoes although we're not sure what to do with them aside from sweet potato fries. =) I found this recipe and decided to give it a try to see if he'd like it. Everyone in my family loved it, even the people who aren't dieting! It easily fed a family of four with leftovers, and we're big eaters. I omitted the corn and substituted arrowroot powder for the flour in an effort to make it SBD friendly, but I don't think a thickener is actually necessary. Either way, the flavors are great! Don't be afraid of the spices. This recipe will be a great meal to have throughout the winter. Thank you, RCKim

This stew tasted great, a little spicy/hot but i like spicy foods. But I had to add more water to the recipe (3 cups instead of 2).

SO good! And this was without bell pepper, kidney beans, and cilantro. I also didn't have canned tomatoes, so I roasted a few fresh ones, and pureed them. Very rich, complex flavors! Left out the flour.

This was really great.  I used mixed veggies instead of corn and didn't have any bell pepper so I chopped up a few fresh tomatoes instead.  I threw it all in together and let it simmer for about an hour.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as specified except I omitted the orange pepper (my husband doesn't like peppers).  I combined the flour and water before adding it to the pot.  I used cocoa powder as called for, and added the fresh cilantro for the last 15 minutes before serving.  We ate it with Italian bread and I added some grated parmesan to mine.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

Omg. This is delicious. I did some things differently. I took user advice and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water and I used the low-sodium kind. I also used ground turkey instead of chicken because I just like ground turkey better. I increased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. because I love spicy! And I left out the garlic (family allergies), cilantro (not a fan) and cocoa powder (didn't have). I also used a yellow bell pepper instead of orange and butternut squash instead of sweet potato bc it was peeled and cubed in the Evolution section. And I used canned corn (Del Monte is my favorite) instead of frozen and added it in when I added the other veggies. Sooo good! I will try sweet potato next time. I was just lazy. ;)

Easily one of the best soups I've ever had!  Everybody that I prepare it for absolutely loves it - and wants the recipe.  I am not a pepper fan, so I omitted those and added a tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 cup salsa.  Fantastic!!  I also use almost double the amount of chicken stock, b/c I wanted more of a soup than a stew.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this!

This was basically chili, only with sweet potatoes and more liquid.  It tasted great, but I would just make chili next time instead of this.

This is a great recipe, with unusual, but excellent seasonings! I had extra time, so I let mine cook about 50-60 minutes, and I really didn't need the flour/water to thicken it. I was shy on the chili powder, but this appealed to my family more. But, what an excellent soup/stew!

This was a delicious. I was looking for something other than the typical stew or chili and this went above and beyond. So many wonderful flavors that meld together. It's a winter staple now!
I don't like bell peppers so I used a can of mild chiles.
I also don't like corn in soups, so I broke up tortilla chips - the authentic kind so they don't turn to mush. 
Instead of cocoa I had chocolate sauce on hand and added a squirt of that.

YUM! I usually make changes to most recipes, but this one is great as is! I recommend that you make it in advance, so that the flavors get a chance to meld together. I usually let it cook down a bit so that it's a thicker stew. I like to serve it over white rice, or plain noodles.It's a fabulous hearty meal.

Fantastic! Super-tasty soup and very easy to make and uses only one pot (I cooked the chicken in my large pot, set the cooked chicken aside and proceeded with the recipe). The cumin, cinnamon and cocoa makes for a freaky-good stew. The most time-consuming/difficult part was chopping some of the ingredients. My tweaks: I used Del Monte diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, replaced the water with chicken stock, and skipped the red pepper flakes. It was mild enough with a nice little kick. The only unsweetened cocoa powder I had was a dark variety so I only used 1/2 tsp. Also, instead of adding the 2T. of water to the flour, I just spooned some of the boiling soup into a separate bowl and used that. This makes a really great meal with bread/chips & salsa.

Fabulous! I did make a couple of changes: I omitted the red pepper flakes and in place of the cocoa powder, I substituted a lovely Zanzibar curry powder that I adore. I have to agree with some comments that while good when freshly made, letting the flavors meld overnight does magic. So easy and quick, too!

This was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe but made these modifications based on what I had: used 2 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes (one w/ zesty jalepenos), and didn't use cilantro because didn't have any. I substituted 2 c water with organic chicken stock. Also added 4 small jalepenos diced for a little extra kick.

FANTASTIC stew! A KEEPER! I used what I had: plum tomatoes that were getting soft, so used those w/ a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. Also, had chicken thighs thawed, so browned them along w/ onion, pepper, garlic & spices b/f adding liquid (careful they don't burn!). The TASTE, AROMA & VISUAL APPEAL are great! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe! Thanks RCKim!

This was unbelievably good. On second look at this recipe, I see I missed the cocoa! Something to look forward to next time! The combination of spices is perfect. I used black beans instead of kidneys, I think they're a better option here. I made mine quite thick and served it over quinoa - a perfect earthy tasting compliment to this terrific recipe. Thanks!!!

Mmmmm so yummy. I was looking for something to do with a sweet potato and was delighted that I had all this stuff in my cupboard! I added Carrots and left out the corn and beans but otherwise followed it exactly. It was really good!!!

The recipe is SO good.  I like to try a new recipe as close to the original as possible to test it first before making changes.  I only made two small changes...I used chicken stock instead of water, and I added mushrooms, only because they were in the fridge and needed to be used before they went bad.  Both my husband and I loved this dish.  Will make it again, and again.  Thank you.

I work night shift so when I got home I threw everything into my slow cooker without sauteing. It came out great! Served it over rice. My husband and I enjoyed it very much.

Delicious! I made some slight alterations due to what I had in my refrigerator/pantry. Since my chicken wasn't cooked, I diced it up and cooked it with my onions and garlic (and salt & pepper). I sauteed all the veggies - and included some carrots I had in the fridge before adding in everything else. I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I substituted tomato paste and veggie broth. I also used a can of cream corn instead of frozen corn and added that right away as well. Since I let it simmer for a couple hours - I didn't need to thicken it with flour. Turned out to have really great flavor!!

Good, but not great. Maybe the cilantro would have made the difference, but I didn't have any on hand. It was a good recipe for tonight, since I had the rest of the ingredients, want hot soup, and something to get me in the mood for fall. I like the sweet potatoes and spice.

This is an excellent recipe.  I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with a can of rotel before adding the other ingredients.  This might have made the final dish spicer, but I think it would be really good without pre-cooking with rote.  My husband loves this dish and has asked me to make it once a week during the fall and winter.  Definitely a keeper.

I used fresh chicken and omitted the salt. In my mortar and pestle I added the spices along with ginger and a fresh chili, I then added it after the onion & garlic.  Then added the chicken, cooked that for a few mins.  Then added the rest via the recipe. I served it on a bed of jasmine rice. Certainly will make this again.

This stew has a ton of flavour! The blend of spices is perfect. The only change I made was to reduce the salt by about half. I would strongly recommend you try this recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this stew! I did make a few alterations per my family's preference. My alterations would be: no bell pepper (not a fan in stews), diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers instead of regular, chicken stock instead of water, black beans instead of kidney and I leave off the red pepper flakes since tomatoes already give it a kick. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was definitely a success. At first I was not sure how the sweet potatoes would be with everything else but they ended up going well with everything. I was out of cocoa powder and I skipped the kidney beans but even with that it was awesome. I took a risk and invited some people over for dinner and decided to make something I had never made before and they all loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! So full of flavor and the cilantro is the perfect finishing touch, wouldn't be as good without it. Made lots and it reheats beautifully.

This is really good.  I used fresh corn and put it in about 10 minutes before the whole thing was done and it turned out great!  You can definately add more heat to this as we didn't think it was that spicy.

This is a great recipe.  I took one person's advise and used chicken broth instead of water, and I put in half the chili powder and substituted parsley for the cilantro.  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow night.

I'm vegan, but my son isn't.  I made this exactly by the recipe except for adding the chicken. Then I divided it in half and put chicken in one half and tofu in the other.  Awe inspiring!  My son agrees.

I loved the flavors that the combination of spices created.  It was superb.  However, it was a tad too watery.  The consistency was perfect until I added the flour dilluted with 2 tablespoons of water, it then became too watery.  Next time I make this dish, I will add the flour directly into the pot without diluting it in water first or just use less water overall. Perhaps then this dish will be a five star!

This stew/soup was fantastic.  My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes or vegetables for that matter and he ate TWO bowls of this.  It was just delish.  I didn't change one thing, but my husband said it would have been better without the chicken.  I think even a bit of sausage instead of the chicken might have worked.  with a dollup of sour cream on the top, this recipe is going to be a favorite that's for sure!

I was surprised at how sweet the soup became from the potatoes. It was a bit too chunky for my tastes. The Italian seasoning was a little off in my opinion.

Mmmmmmm.  This was fantastic! :)  A great, unique twist on chili. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and a red pepper instead of a yellow (all I had!) but everything else followed the recipe exactly.  I'm so glad I have leftovers!

ETA: I just made this with sweet potatoes instead of yams and I think the yams are MUCH better in it.  :)  They do get mushier (is that word?) but they really kick the flavor up a notch!

Incredible! Great eating at dinnertime and even better leftovers. I cheated and used canned sweet potatoes, subbed black beans for kidney, and pre-made mole sauce for the red pepper and cocoa.

So very good and easy to change up if you want to. I just tasted a little bit and now I cant wait till dinner! I made it early so it could sit and infuse before dinner.

I read the reviews and yes, it is better the next day.  I took it to a soup night and everyone raved about it.  I was actually surprised someone could smell the cinammon (ok, maybe I put a tad too much).

This meal was delicious! I feed 9 people of a meal time and it was a huge hit.

I doubled the recipe and only had one pepper so I used that plus some chopped mushrooms. I substituted the water for all chicken broth and just before serving I added about 3oz of cream cheese. My husband and I both tried the stew before adding the cream cheese and he was a little hesitant about that idea as he felt it was great without it, but I just felt like something a bit cozier (it was a really cold day up here in Canada!) so I took the plunge and added it. It just gave it a subtle creamy feel without taking away the really nice flavor of the original recipe. I will definately be making this again and I think next time I will try it in my slow cooker. Thanks!

This stew is great.  I've made it twice; this time I subbed plain pepper flakes for chipotle flakes and it was still awesome.

This soup came out very good. I used yams instead of sweet potatoes because yams aren't as mushy. I also took the suggestion and used white beans. I added garbanzo beans as well.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this recipe.  I liked it as well even though I'm not a huge sweet potato fan.  I made a couple of changes to ensure that it was flavorful enough for our tastes.  I rubbed the chicken with a mixture of chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper and let it sit for a couple hours and then grilled it before cutting it up to use in the stew.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalapenos for a little more spice.  I loved everything about this recipe, just wish I loved sweet potatoes!

One of the best recipes on this site! I make it in the crockpot and use black beans instead of kidney, just personal preference. The prep work is a bit time consuming, but I make it again and again because it's so delicious. Goes great with cornbread.

My husband and I both enjoyed this stew even though I made a few changes and committed a huge faux pas. I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, both with added garlic, oregano, and basil. I added only 8 oz. of water. I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker, omitting the oil and flour, with the intention of adding the corn and beans (I was going to use black beans) at the very end. I got distracted at the end of the day and served the stew up as it was without ever adding in the corn and beans! Oh well, it was still good. Now I want to make it again getting in those extra veggies!

I made this in a crock pot with the following variations: Instead of flour, I used two tbsps of tomato paste as a thickener. I used paprika instead of chili powder. I don't digest kidney beans or corn well so I added green beans instead. I also added chopped chorizo sausage. Hmmmmm. Try your own variations. It took about 4 hours to cook on high. You could cook it on low for 8 or 9 hours and it would be ready to enjoy after a day's work.

This was very good.  My husband commented on how tasty it was.  The only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of chicken stock for one of the cups of water in the recipe.  Another commenter mentioned that the chicken got a bit lost in the recipe and I agree.  Next time I make it, I will use 1.5 lbs. of chicken.  This recipe would be good served over rice, which I will do when I heat up the leftovers.

I tried this recipe as a way to use up some Thanksgiving Turkey. I substituted turkey for the chicken, used chicken broth in place of water as suggested in the reviews, used black beans instead of kidney, and added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes for extra spice. It turned out terrific! This just might become a tradition! It was so good, I'm going to try a vegetation option for our non meat friends. Thanks for the great recipe inspiration!

This was good, but no one raved - only change was I swapped chicken broth for water as others suggested.  Nice warm meal for a bowl in front of the television perhaps.

This dish is PHENOMENAL!  With all the potatoes, I figured this stew didn’t need the flour/water mixture, so I skipped that step.  So glad I did, because it turned out incredibly thick!  Instead of kidney beans, I used black beans, and I substituted an additional can of pinto beans for the corn.  This recipe is the ultimate blend of tart, spicy, warm, and sweet.  The spice blend is so unique and flavorful.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!

I made tacos out of this recipe. I just didn't add the water. I also threw the sweet potatoes in the pan first and cooked them down for about five minutes on med-high heat before adding the other veggies. once everything was cooked I put the spices in. SO delicious!

Really delicious and pretty quick to make. I used a whole chicken cut up, cooked it separately with just a little salt + pepper for about 6 min/side.  Cut that up and tossed it in the remainder of the stew at the end.  Worked beautifully.  Hand-made tortillas were a nice pairing.  Great flavors, highly recommend!

A bit spicier than my kidlet was comfortable with, but an easy adjustment next time. The flavors were a unique and interesting change of pace.  I liked it; I don't think it's something I could eat often, but would be a nice change of pace once in a while. NOTE: I also didn't need to use the flour - the soup came together by itself.  And as we are vegetarian, I skipped the chicken.  UPDATE: The leftovers sat in the fridge until they went bad... no one wanted this a second time.

Excellent dish! I too used chicken stock instead of water, but didn’t alter anything else. Delicious and hearty stew with unique and complex flavors. Can’t wait to make again!

Loved it. Cut chili powder in 1/2 also cumin in 1/2. Used beef broth instead of water. Added fresh mushrooms.

Excellent flavor! I used tomatoes from my garden instead of from a can. To compensate, I added a teaspoon of sugar and an additional teaspoon of salt. To suit my young kids' taste buds, I reduced the chili powder to 1 tsp; the stew still had a tiny bit of heat to it.
Husband asked for it to be made again and my pickiest eater devoured it. (Truth: two kids poured their milk in it, then decided they weren't hungry.) I served sweet cornbread muffins with the stew and will continue to do so.

I substituted black beans for the corn and served it over rice since I am not much of a stew person....really turned out well and open to many variations.

I made mostly as-is, but used rotisserie chicken and zucchini instead of the corn. Really interesting mix of flavors, very different.  I'll definitely make again. Per some of the other reviews,  I waited until the next day to eat.

This was way so good. The only changes I made were a few squirts of lime juice and I messed up and thawed two pieces of white fish that I thought was chicken breasts. I cooked the fish in the air fryer and dumped it into the stew instead of chicken. Awesome. Served over rice. Spices were terrific and I am not a fan of hot spicy foods.

We love this dish!  We use Black Beans instead of kidney beans, and skip the pepper flakes.  Easy and serve to guests too.

Only gave this four stars because I used cooked sweet potatoes that had been in the freezer since thanksgiving so I don't know if that changed the recipe but it was very good. I made half the recipe and that made four large servings so be warned it makes a lot as written.

Love this stew as the recipe is written. My 12 year old son loves it and insists on it being his lunch if at all possible. It keeps really well and works as a take for lunch item for me as well. I find it even better on the leftovers!

Made this in the slow cooker, left out the green pepper, the flour and used chicken broth in place of water.  I replaced the kidney beans with black beans and added green beans about 2 hours before serving.

Followed the recipe pretty closely and doubled it. 
Used chicken bullion concentrate (“Better than bullion” brand), whatever tomato cans I had (diced and crushed), and canned hominy rather than corn.
Flavors melded very well, forgot to try with the lime. We did add some sour cream on top.
Freezing a couple of containers of the leftovers for a quick and healthy dinner in the future.
Really a great opportunity to double up on the vegetables, delicious and healthy.

This was so  awesome. I get really tired of the same old chicken stew. This smells rather sweet, so at first your not sure what to expect. The spices blend so well with the sweet potatoes. I served it up with some sweet corn bread. I think that this will fast become a favorite at my house.

Better after sitting in the fridge. I agree with others that the next time I'll shred the chicken. Pretty good stew.

Different but delicious! The cinnamon was the perfect touch in my opinion (the 1/4 teaspoon amount was just right). I made minor adjustments based on what I had on hand (substituted chicken stock for the water; black beans and chick peas for kidney beans; corn starch for flour). Followed all other ingredients and measurements as stated and it turned out perfect. It was a little labor intensive but worth it. A nice change of pace from the usual veggie stew and chili.

Turned out better than expected! I made a few changes such as boiling the chicken and shredding it and then using that broth as my "2 cups of water". Shredding the chicken ensured me and my family a bit of chicken with every bite. I did what some comments have suggested such as adding Chayenne pepper for a little kick, because we too love things spicy. I also added a small can of tomato sauce and diced fresh tomatoes and carrots. I opted out of the corn or beans mainly because I didn't have any on hand.  The spices are what really surprised me and worked out really well together in this dish. I had to add more spices to what seemed fit to my tasting.  When topped it with fresh cilantro, the flavors came together beautifully. I would definitely make this again!

This was fantastic!  Sadly, I only made 1/2 the amount of servings and wish I had doubled it!  The only changes I made were to use green pepper (because that's what I had) and a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes.  I will be making this again very soon!

I had a sweet potato and a partial pkg of frozen chicken thighs, and had soup on my mind - and we like spicy food, so this was spot on!  I didn't have quite the full amount of sweet potato  (actually a garnet yam), so made up the difference with cubed carrots, and I used red bell pepper instead of yellow, because that's what I had on hand.  Since I didn't quite have the recommended amount of chicken, I went ahead and used the whole can of kidney beans (I had cut the recipe in half, since it's just the two of us - and there's still enough soup left for my lunche the next couple of days).  Oh, I really wanted more of a soup rather than stew, so didn't thicken it with the flour.  It was a bit mild for our taste, but that can easily be remedied - it will interesting to see if the spiciness increases after sitting overnight in the frig!  Will be making this again.

Very good recipe, but I recommend a few changes to make it better. First, I swap the water for stock for more flavor. Second, I make a roux first and then add the ingredients rather than adding the flour later on. Green beans work as a good option/alternative to peppers too.

Liked the concept, but it fell flat on flavor as is. I had to up the spice levels (by like a 50% increase) and add a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes in order to take it to a 5 star recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but this just was not a hit in my house. We love Mexican and we love Moroccan but they are both full of strong,  vibrant flavours and this was so bland. I even tried adding extra spices after cooking and tasting it but the leftovers still went uneaten.

A good recipe and be sure to make plenty as left overs the next day are even better.  Some users mentioned the prep time, but apart from the sweet potato it was all very simple, quick and easy.

Note I used uncooked chicken and simply sauteed it before the onions and then set it aside.

Not much washing up either

Yum! Loved it right away. I added 1/2 a teaspoon of smoked paprika for a touch of smoke. Also, I subbed in Quorn fake chicken and it worked fine, as well as used carrots instead of peppers because that's what I had, & chickpeas instead of kidney beans. It tastes great and was an easy stew to make, and it seems it holds up well to modifications to use what you have around, as long as you stick with the stew base . Will make this again!

I used the meat from baked chicken thighs instead of breast meat.  Next time I am going to cut the sweet potatoes up smaller for faster cooking, but otherwise no changes.

I took the recipe of spices but made the soup differently.  Fresh Tomato,  sweet potato boiled in the spices and chicken stock (not water).  Removed skins.  Cooked onion,  pepper and ground some  fresh ginger into that while cooking them down.  Garlic paste in potato pot. Blended all the items added together while adding some heavy cream.  The chicken and corn I added last.  The chicken was boneless skinless thighs I cooked in the oven and shredded when it cooled.  It is like a bisque I guess?  Liked it lol.

I followed this recipe nearly to a T and it was real, real delicious. The only substitutions I made were that I swapped out red beans for kidney beans and can of corn for frozen (because that's what I had on hand). There was a decent amount of prep work involved, but nothing too crazy. I boiled the cubes of chicken first, then pulled them apart, which I think just works better in a stew. Also, my 11 month old loved this stuff. I threw some in the food processor and he ate it up. Will definitely make this again. +Recipe Box

I also used used yams instead of sweet potatoes and it was fantastic!  I also only used about half the flour and it was perfect next I might just add like a cup and a half of corn but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a delicious dish! I didn't change a thing. I didn't have cooked chicken so I boiled skinless chicken thighs. After sauteing the onion and garlic, I just put everything right in the pot with the boiling chicken. It was fabulous! Such great flavor!

My family loved this! I followed most of the recipe, but made a few changes. I used regular legs and thighs, as that's what I had, and used tomato sauce in lieu of diced tomatoes, same reason. I also left out red pepper flakes, orange bell pepper and beans because of preference. All the other spices I kept the same, and it was delish! Served up with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread. Will be making again this weekend for company!

I used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes. It was very good. I also added a teaspoon of habanero powder for a little extra heat. Very good flavors. Definitely something I will be making again.

This was really good. I didn't have a bell pepper (don't really care for them anyway) and I used canned corn instead of frozen.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it turned out great. I'll make it again.

Perfect in every way. Terrific flavors. I used homemade chicken broth, diced my roasted chicken meat and added a roasted jalapeno for more spice depth. I'm addicted to this soup!!!

much to my surprised this all came together very well.. i was worried when i first started making it around midday b/c the broth didn't seem too flavorful to me.. i added the rest of the ingredients and had it that evening and wow super good.. only things i didn't add were the bell pepper, cocoa, and flour slurry.. also used chicken bouillon instead of just water.. me and bf nearly devoured this last night and i took the rest for lunch today.. cant wait to have it again.. ty so much for the recipe

Fantastic. Converted to slow cooker and doubled recipe. Used chicken thighs, cubed and slightly browned before putting in pot. Cut sweet potato in small chunks. Put everything in slow cooker, except chicken, cooked on high for total of 6 hours. Put chicken in about half way through. Didn't have any cinnamon so used 2 cinnamon sticks - fabulous aroma. Great melding of flavors. Will definitely make again. A real hit.

You've got to try this recipe, it's delicious! The blend of spices makes for a rich gravy which compliments the sweetness of the sweet potato. I used a can of Italian spiced tomatoes, added turnip, chickpeas and carrots instead of corn and kidney beans (didn't have any). A nice hearty meal on a cold snowy night! Thanks for sharing it with us.

DELICIOUS! my husband and I LOVED this recipe! I used the crock-pot for 3-hrs on high, I sauteed the onions, garlic and peppers and coated them with flour and water before I put it in the crock-pot with chicken(raw) and the other ingredients. I went light on the chili powder. I'm trying a bunch of new stews to add to my menu and this will definitely be a favorite! Yumm!!!

This soup is really delicious!  I used 1 C chicken broth in place of one of the cups of water.  My whole family loved it. I used leftover chicken and the whole thing came together in less than an hour.  Will be making this again for sure.

This was a big hit - nice alternative to chili.  Sweet potatoes were sliced pretty small, but still took longer than described to cook.  Cilantro was added with a light hand, but everything else was pretty close to the recipe.  We will definitely have this again.

Easy Version!  Saute onion and garlic, add chicken stock (instead of water) raw diced chicken (breast or thigh), spices, red or orange pepper and drained tomatoes.  Cook 10 minutes.  Add diced sweet potato.  Cook 10 minutes.  Add flour slurry, beans (I used black beans since that was what I had on hand)and corn (though I left that out).  Heat to boiling.  Top with cilantro, squeeze of lime and dollop of sour cream (important!).  Absolutely wonderful and very easy! Also, I substituted 1/4 square of unsweetened bakers chocolate since I didn't have cocoa on hand. Very forgiving recipe.  Thank you!

This is a very tasty stew!  My whole family enjoyed it and asked for seconds. I did make a few alterations, I didn't use as much chili powder or red pepper flakes (I am the only one who enjoys spicey) and I used black beans instead of kidney. Also I only had 14 oz of diced tomatoes so I added a can of condensed orange tomato soup and 1 cup of mild salsa. Oh, and I used ground chicken but it still had great flavor and texture. We heated tortillas in a skillet and used them as a dipper...yummy!

I did need to add more salt, used pinto beans, and added about a few fennel seeds. Used the pinto because that is what I had on hand, added the fennel because I like it.

Yummy as written...second time around I used chicken broth instead of water...used 1tbsp mild Chili powder and 1 tbsp curry powder...added diced celery and carrots. Also thickened it a bit more for my preference. Love it! Quick comfort food.

This stew is really yummy!  I only made minimal changes.  I used about half the amount of chili powder because that's all I had, and about half the cinnamon.  Also I used yellow bell peppers instead of orange.  The last thing I changed was that I didn't add the crushed red peppers.  This stew was well received by my family!
