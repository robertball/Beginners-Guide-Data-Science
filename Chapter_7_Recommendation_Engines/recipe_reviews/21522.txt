I use less oil (~1/2 cup), and bake the coated crakers (275 degrees for 15-20 minutes).

this is a great recipe. have made it for years. baking them in the oven for about 15 minutes is a must. it makes the crackers not so oily.

I was so excited to see this recipe.  I thought I had lost it.  These crackers are always a hit when I make them.  They come out a little greasy, but since I don't make them very often I am okay with the extra fat.  The herb mix is very tangy and these are just great.

I used one full batch of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix and half the amount of oil called for. I baked them for about 45 minutes at 250*, stirring every ten minutes or so so I wouldn't have soggy, oily crackers. They came out nice and crispy and we just love them.

Just got done mixing up a 1/2 batch of this with my son, and it is DELICIOUS! Like I said, I halved the recipe, but only used 1/4 cup oil and added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (this was perfect for us). My son had so much fun shaking everything around in the bag, and even more fun 'taste-testing' it, lol. This literally took 3 minutes to whip up, and will be a new snack staple for us~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'm so excited to find this recipe again... In my family, these are called "Stinky Crackers" and kids & adults love 'um.  

Try mixing them in a paper grocery sack... it soaks up some of the excess oil - and is fun!

This is the recipe that I have used for years and everyone loves it.  Other recipes have you bake them, but it isn't necessary.  I let the crackers sit for about an hour to absorb the oil and for the flavors to marry.  Declicious!

This recipe was given to me by a co-worker, and she added peanuts to the mix.  Great snack, if you can eat peanuts.

I haven't had these for a long time and enjoyed making them again!  Used only about 1 1/2 pkgs of crackers and added a couple cups of pretzel rings before mixing with the oil/seasonings.  Then I baked the snack mix at 250 degrees for about 10 minutes.  The saltiness of the pretzel rings was a nice addition to the crackers.  Because of baking the mix, I used the full amount of oil.

My variation on this is:
Use 1 small bottle of Orville Redenbacher butter flavored popcorn oil and 2 powdered zesty italian dressing seasoning. Mix in large garbage bag. Voila!

These are the best!!! My Dad used to make them as a special treat when I was a child and I can't wait to make them for my son. I do use significantly less oil though and more dill.

Just made this recipe in less than five minutes.  It's a great snack for my kids, as well as one that they can help me make!  My 22 mo old LOVES to help me make this one.  I use a plastic grocery bag and the kids take turns shaking the bag (I do seal it with a twist tie before giving it to them!)

This is a great snack. like others, I used only 1/2 cup and I used olive oil. Baking at 250 for about 30 minutes with a few stirs in between helps keep them from being greasy. I also added a teaspoon of creole seasoning because I like a little kick.

This is very good snack. I mix in a big bowl and stir occasionally for about 2 hours. Not greasy. I also add a trail mix, peanuts or mini pretzels.

I make it using both ranch and zesty Italian dry dressing mix then I add chez it's  pretzels and dry red pepper flakes.  Put in large container shake and  let sit over night.  By the way I also use 1 cup Olive oil.  It will look a bit oily at first but by morning it looks good

So tasty! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but didn't have enough oil, so I used what I had and it still worked.
I also didn't have any ranch.
You can use a lot of different combos and these still taste great.

I love these crackers. My grandmother made them at Christmas. Now I make them. There is a savory-ness that is missing. I wonder if it's because I use canola oil. 

Here's an idea for storing the crackers, which applies to crackers in the crinkly plastic bags. The crinkly bags tend to tear all the way to the bottom with me when I open them. So, to keep that from happening, before you open the bag, put a strip of packaging tape all around the bag, then cut the bag open with scissors where the packaging tape is.  The bag won't tear.  You can put the prepared crackers back in the bag with a clip or a piece of tape, and you have a perfect storage container. Works great if you're taking these someplace where you may not get your container back (school party, etc.).

This is a great recipe! I subbed veggie oil with sesame oil and baked them at 275 degrees for about 15 minutes stirring them once. The sesame oil gives them a great taste! Kids love this snack!
