I cut the recipe in half.  I followed all directions, but did a few things differently.  I used an ice cream scoop to form the dough onto the cookie sheet.  That way the dough is firmly packed.  I then pressed down a little on the dough to flatten it to about 3/4 inch thick.  I put the cookie sheet in the fridge for about 10 minutes, then into the oven.  That way they didn't spread out all over the pan (that happens when the butter in the recipe goes from already warm and soft to hot and liquidy!) and they still held a perfect cookie shape.

I don't like cookies with so much chocolate, but my boyfriend loved them for Valentine's Day as this is a recipe his mom always used to make!

This recipe does not work.  Don't waste your time.  You need the one with more baking soda.  The lack of baking soda causes the cookies to come out so flat.  Read other reviews. You shouldn't have to add flour after the fact. Use another monster cookie recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  We added about 1/4 cup of flour so that they would be a little firmer.

Again, I'm not a large cookie fan (esspecially those filled with chocolate) BUT, despite my bias, these are pretty tasty and my family really enjoyed them.  They make ALOT!!! I'm not sure what I'm going to do with all of them yet but we had no problems making them.  Maybe I'll try halving the recipe next time and see if success can still be achieved.

My first tray ended up all over the bottom of my oven because it ran over the sides... then I had to scrape everything off, so I ended up with bits nothing like cookies. I thought a recipe with no flour was weird, but i saw the review of 4 stars, and the pic picture posted so I went for it. NEVER AGAIN. I managed to work enough flour into the remaining dough so they didnt spread everywhere... but very unhappy with these!

Monster cookies are supposed to be BIG and full of goodies... These looked like flat puddles. They tasted fine but they are not appealing at ALL. Do not use this recipe if you want big fluffy cookies. I added extra baking soda and flour and it did not help

I thought these cookies came out great. I didnt have a problem with flat cookies. mine were big and chunky. I chilled the dough overnight as well, and only baked for 12. didnt use flour either.

I cut out 1 cup and a half of white sugar and used honey instead of corn syrup. Turned out just fine! I have had much better monster cookies than these, but the process on this one was different and fun in its own right...

I did not care for these cookies and I wish I had believed the bad reviews but instead have an enormous amount of bad cookies.  Don't make this recipe unless you enjoy very thin dry cookies.

I added 1 cup of wheat free baking mix and 1/2'd the recipe because my dad's allergic to gluten (wheat flour). Pretty good. Next time I'll use quick oats instead of regular oats.

Like other users I had to add flour. Also, I only had 8 cups of oatmeal because I ran out. Halfway through cooking I squished the cookies together so they would be smaller. The end result was a yummy cookie but I'm not sure it was worth all the extra work.

Shame that some had trouble with this recipe! It is the ultimate in the perfect cookie. As someone else said the ONLY problem with this recipe would be that it makes so much, BUT how handy to be able to freezer bag then freeze portions of the batter for a quick dozen homemade cookies at the last minute. I added M&M's, Reese's pieces, and raisens. YUM!!! THANKS for the awesome recipe!

This makes a lot of cookies, which how can you beat that!  The cookies were great tasting, but turn out very flat.  On the up side they taste great, both the boys and the husband loved them!  Thanks for a great cookie recipe!

I wasted a lot of dough and time before I added the flour.
