Great flavor, stick to your ribs, healthy breakfast for anytime of day.  I chose to omit the butter and sugar as I cooked this to accommodate my dieting daughter, so those who wanted them added them on top.  This is comfort food!  Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious. My whole family LOVED it - even my one year old. I did add an extra TBSP of brown sugar, but otherwise made it as directed. So yummy!!

This was excellent!!  It was my first attempt at making steel cut oats. I did omit the dried cranberries as I don't particularly care for them. The recipe and times are spot on!  I divided the portions into 8 1cup containers and froze for future use. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Made exactly as instructed though used my slow cooker because I had the time. Cooked on low for about four hours, stirring every hour. Delicious!

This is definitely one of the best oatmeal recipes I have ever made and eaten. I make it a lot and it is now my go to recipe for steel cut oats. 

I do substitute soy milk for the milk and Canadian maple syrup for the brown sugar and add walnuts sometimes.

So good! I'm not a fan of oatmeal in general but wanted to try steel cut oats and found this recipe. I only made 4 servings but added 1 tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon (we're big cinnamon fans) and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Oh my! So yummy! I added some toasted slivered almonds to the top as well. Thanks for sharing! I'll definitely be making this one again!

Good starter recipe. I toasted the oats in the 1 tbsp butter before anything else. I ended up using a lot more salt than 1 pinch, but I didn't measure. Used half and half in place of milk. Added 1 tsp vanilla. Only used 1/4 cup sugar, but I also threw some maple syrup in there. Added about 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut, which made it for me, the coconut makes it amazing! Also I used about 1/2 cup Golden raisins instead of the cranberries. SO GOOD!

This was so easy to make and unbelievably delicious (I did add a tad more cranberries than the recipe called for). Absolutely loved that I wanted some oats this morning and could make it in about 30mins (as opposed to in a slow cooker for hours). Highly recommend this for any morning!!

It turned out very well by following the instructions. I didn't use the cranberries because I didn't have them on hand, but still it has a nice mild flavor and it's not too sweet.

part of my new year's resolution is to work on making healthier/lighter meals, specifically those that i make for bf to take to work.. hence seeking this out.. i cut the recipe in half and made the following modifications:  3 cups water for the 4, almond milk for the whole milk, sugar substitute for the brown sugar and nonfat buttery spread for the real stuff.. i doubled the cinnamon and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.. i left out the dried cranberries as i had none.. this felt a little lacking so i added 2 tsp of actual brown sugar.. i didn't bother using another bowl for the milk mixture, just added the ingredients into the pot one by one.. i ended up cooking it for a total of 20 min's after that.. on a side note, one could argue that using artificial substitutes is not all that healthy but this is a lot easier than coaxing bf into some kind of vegan diet.. we'll save that for his daughter :-) .. ty for the recipe

I've made this several times and it's fantastic. Perfect texture and flavor. I omit the dried berries and add fresh blueberries when I heat up a bowl.

This recipe is great, filling, and makes a large quantity.  I added about 1 tsp vanilla extract, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp, added 2 tsp of nutmeg, and it was delicious!!

This is so healthy but good tasting!   I added walnuts and more cinnamon. I also increased the salt to  1 tsp given the amount of oats being cooked. I am thinking apples cooked in would also be excellent as well as raisins. Making this again for sure!

Great recipe to modify. I used raisins, brown sugar and maple syrup.  Use whatever you have, such as strawberry jam as a flavorful sweetener. Steel cut oats stick to your ribs and are good leftover, so make extra.
