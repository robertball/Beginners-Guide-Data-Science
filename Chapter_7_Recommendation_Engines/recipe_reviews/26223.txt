These cookies are so good!  I make them every year for Christmas.  I did change the recipe slightly for my own tastes.  I do not do a drizzle frosting.  Instead, as soon as the cookies come out of the oven, I dust them with powdered sugar.  But, because raspberry and almond flavors do mesh well together, I do add a tsp. of almond extract to the cookie batter.  These are also cute using a snowflake shaped cutter.

I love this recipe.  I made similar cookies a few years ago but, I like this recipe better where you make the sandwiches before you bake them.  It gives the jam a slightly chewy consistency like cookies I get at the italian bakery.  I like to make a couple of variations.  I usually put a little of the almond extract in the cookies instead of in a glaze.  Also, for a more decadent cookie I also like to melt some semi-sweet chocolate and drizzle that on the cookies after they have cooled.  The chocolate-raspberry flavor combination is delicious!

I made these by cutting the dough into circles using a clean cap from a can of spray starch - frugal and ingenious, huh? LOL Then I cut a small star shape using a very small star-shaped metal cookie cutter into the middles of the top circles. This made assembling the cookies easier while still making them pretty. I also skipped the icing and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the dough. I dusted the finished cookies with powdered sugar as did another reader, making them look rather like old-fashioned Lindzer (sp?) cookies.

These cookies are delicious and beautiful!  I gave it 4 stars because the cookies are pretty time-consuming, and the recipe doesn't make nearly as many cookies as it claims, I've found.    The cookies and icing are both fantastic.  I make these for Christmas every year and use a variety of preserves (my dad loves apricot!).  I make stars, snowflakes, bells, gingerbread men, and whatever other shapes I have lying around. I get lots of compliments on these every year!

All around it was good, my only complaint was with the dough.  I tried chilling it and that didn't work well. I tried just rolling it out and it took a great deal of flour to keep it from sticking. You can taste all of that flour in the cookie, but they are still good. Chilling it made it too tough. Hmm..

Made these last Christmas and they were everyone's favorite out of all the cookies that were there!  A lot of work, but the combination of raspberry and almond flavor is SO delicious!

Wonderful!  I made the suggested change and added 1 tsp. of almond extract to the dough.  I also used the dough from the small cut-out and topped it with a dollop of raspberry jam and a slivered almond, baked and then sifted confectioners sugar on top.

These turned out great.  Don't worry about getting the jelly exactly even because it bubbles and melts into a nice even puddle.  My only adjustment was the bake time.  My broken oven only bakes at 350 degrees and it took over 20 minutes.  I took them out when they started to brown.

I've been on AR for years & I think this is the 1st review I've written!  I bought raspberry preserves and then searched for a recipe to use it in when I came across this.  I've been looking for a good cut-out recipe for years and I think I've finally found it!  I loved that I didn't have to refrigerate the dough and wait hours, I could just mix it and roll it right away!  Based on the other reviews I added the almond extract and it was perfect.  I made the first batch into stars with the raspberry preserves but I am also going to make another batch and just decorate as a plain cut-out cookie.  This is definitely a keeper!

These cookies came out PERFECT! I made them for a 4th of July party.. they came out soooo pretty it looked like I had bought them from the store.  To be honest, they tasted a lot like a poptart.  I made them EXACTLY the way the recipe said and they came out looking perfect.  I made the drizzle but the almond extract was too strong so I made a new batch without it and drizzled it on then used various sprinkles to make them red, white and blue looking.  A lot of work but I will make them again during Christmas for sure!

I tried this recipe out to possibly use for my son's Valentine's Day party at school (used heart cut outs instead of stars).  I'm normally not a fan of butter cookies, but they looked perfect for a Valentine's party.  Another reason I thought they would be a good choice is that I wouldn't be tempted to eat them all....boy was I wrong!  These cookies are too good for words!  Perfect combination of light crunch and subtle sweet chewiness.  I left off the 'icing' as I felt they were perfect on their own.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I put 1 tsp of almond extract in the dough instead of the glaze.   I found the dough too dry and it would not roll, so I added an extra egg and it was perfect.  If you don't want the dough to have a flour-like taste you can sprinkle icing sugar down and use it on the rolling pin.  It only takes a little.  I then dusted the cookies with icing sugar when they came out of the oven.  Very good!

This recipe was excellent, we used splenda because we have some diabetic family and it was sooo good. The only other thing we did differently was that we cut circles out of the top part of the cookie instead of the same exact star. Overall it was very easy to make and everyone that has eaten them loves them and asks for the recipe!

Great recipe! However, for the dough I needed to add and egg and another cup of flour. The glaze on top makes it worth it. I made my own "jam" out of fresh raspberries, blackberries, sugar, water, and cornstarch.

these cookies are delicious.  i had to roll the dough out about 1/2 inch because it was so flimsy... even then the dough was still deforming when transferring.  also, i think  it's a good idea to put the preservatives after the cookies have been baked.  some of my top cookies slightly slided off the bottom ones because of the jam, making an unexpected  change of shapes.  (i baked mine until i saw brown edges... just because i don't like that "raw-ish" batter taste.)

Looooove these.  The ONLY alteration I made was adding a capful of vanilla extract to the dough.   We also didn’t make the frosting but chose to sprinkle confectioners sugar on the cookies when they came out of the oven.  DELICIOUS!!

These are super yummy. I used a really high quality jam with no preservatives and was generous with how much I used. I did however feel like a neurosurgeon trying to assemble them without pieces falling apart! I did a snowflake cutout instead of a star...maybe that made it harder ;) Great results, very pleased!

This is a family favorite for every Christmas. Also, I have been asked to make these for several weddings. They are FANTASTIC!! I have tried several variations, but using the circle cutouts are the easiest. ....and 8 take the tiny circle cutouts and make "mini cookies" for the "samplers" in the house!

Exactly the recipe I was looking for. I used different kinds/colors of jams and it made for a gorgeous presentation. I didn't use the icing or glaze because I liked the cookies as they were already.

This recipe is AMAZING!  A little time consuming, but well worth the effort.  I used lemon filling instead of raspberry because it was what I had on hand.  My family went through the whole batch in less than 24 hours and wants more! :)  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

What an amazing cookie! This is truly a keeper and I will be using it for many holidays in the future. Great addition to cookie platters or tins, and they hold together well. I omitted the glaze and added almond extract to the batter instead. Also dusted with powder sugar, and used apricot and strawberry preserves, as well as grape, as raspberry wasn't available to me. It turned out great anyway. Thanks!

These are the best cookies I have ever made.  They take much longer than the posted 37 minutes to come to fruition, but they are definitely gone in seconds.  I recommend using 2 1/2 cups of flour because the dough cracks when you roll it out.  Should this happen to you, just add a few pats of butter to the dough and knead it in thoroughly.  It will roll out beautifully after that.  I wanted to use some strawberry jam I made earlier in the year.  The jam stained the cookies in my first batch because it was not firm enough, so I added a little corn starch, and the problem was resolved.

I used marionberry jelly instead of raspberry and everyone loved them. They were a tad dry though. But the icing was really good, and all together it worked.

These were great. I loved the almond taste, although it was almost too strong in the glaze. They looked beautiful and were really good! Great for a holiday gift.

These cookies are delicious and the consistency of the cookies is perfect.  We added extra raspberry topping and Duncan Hines White Chocolate Almond frosting.  We will definately be making these again!
