I think the bread needs to be toasted with the truffle oil.  Some balsamic glaze would be good too.

Based on the reviewer's suggestions above, I made a couple changes. Instead of using two slices of bread, I made them open faced. And I toasted the bread after applying the olive oil but before putting on the cheese, tomato and basil. They were really good. I usually make caprese salads with balsamic; the truffle oil was a nice change of pace.

I love this combination of flavors and so does everyone I make this for. I make it as more of an open-faced sandwich and use Italian bread which I toast for a few minutes on each side before I put the mozzarella, tomato, and basil on top.
