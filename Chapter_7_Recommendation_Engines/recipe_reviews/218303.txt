I had decided to make this cake before the first review was written. I based my decision mostly on the fact that the cake contained pudding so I knew it wouldn't be dry.  The cake was just ok.  I only had 1 ounce of red food coloring but the cake was plenty red.  I probably should have added 1 ounce of water to replace the missing food coloring but I didn't think about it until it was too late.  The batter was very thick and when cooked the layers were pretty flat.  The icing was not to my liking.  My kids thought the buttercream tasted funny and in general the cake lacked flavor.  I will not be making this cake again :(

i have searched for the recipe for red velvet cake that would accually taste like chocolate, and be moist also.  I must say I was plesantly surprised! this is absolutely the best recipe for red velvet cake I have ever tried.  As a testiment to this cake, I made it and wrapped a large slice for my husband who drives trucks for a living. he said the cake was so good that he licked the aluminum foil it was wrapped in! very funny when he told it to me.  The only thing i did different was, I used cream cheese frosing instead of the buttercream.

This was my first time making red velvet cake (a birthday request from my 14 yr old son).  The cake was awesome.  It came out perfect!  It was so MOIST with great flavor.  The entire family loved it.  Cake was gone by  morning!  Will definitely make this one again.  The only change I made was I added white chocolate to the frosting.  Delicious!

it tasted fine, but lacked flavour and tasted more like a chocolate pudding cake then the fluffy sweetness one expects from a red velvet cake.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Excellent and easy red velvet recipe - I had to go with what I had on hand, so I had to use sifted all purpose flour instead of cake flour (you can also use some cornstarch in all purpose as substitute, but I didn't have any of that either).  Used only 1 oz food coloring.  As a sub for buttermilk I used 1 cup regular milk mixed w/ 1 tablespoon white vinegar (usually you would use 1 T vinegar w/ enough milk to make a cup, but with cutting out some food coloring I did it this way).  I also used nearly 3 tablespoons cocoa.  Since I was baking in dark, non-stick pans I reduced oven temp to 340 and they were perfect in 27 minutes.  For frosting I stuck with a cream cheese - 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1-3/4 cups confect. sugar - it was perfect - not too sweet!  Even with all my subs this is a real hit!

I am giving this only two stars because the buttercream frosting is decidedly lacking - it is overly sweet and leaves a waxy aftertaste on the tongue.

I had a velvet cake recipe years ago that I truly loved. I lost it and could never find another just like it.This cake is amazing!. I used 2-8inch pans because red velvet cake does not rise very much.I also had to increase my baking time,but DO NOT overbake. But again, it was fantastic.I just returned from a cook out and it was "the hit".so very moist. I used another recipe for the frosting though. I use a "smooth buttercream" recipe. I am making another tomorrow.Thank you so much for sharing. :}

I made this for my son's birthday cake, he specifically requested a Red Velvet cake with a Mario Bros. theme so that's what we did! I didn't have buttermilk so I made some sour milk (1 Tbsp. vinegar and the remaining amount of 1 cup filled with regular milk, stirred together and let it sour and thicken for a few minutes) and that worked just fine. I also didn't have regular chocolate pudding mix, but I did have the no sugar added instant pudding mix and used it. It worked out great for me. I doubled the vanilla, used HEAPING tablespoons of cocoa powder, used parchment paper on the bottom of the pans in addition to the grease and flour on the sides, used little jar of gel type food coloring instead of the liquid, cooked it for only about 25 minutes at 335 degrees and used my own cream cheese frosting recipe. All together it came out WONDERFULLY! Everyone LOVED it and even one of the people that didn't like red velvet cake commented on how good it was! I tried making 2 different red velvet recipes to have a dense layer for the bottom and lighter top layers, but the other recipe was a flop so I had to make a second batch of this recipe and both times it came out great. This is getting added to my "Tried, Tested and Great" recipe binder!

So first of all, the actual cake is very good. Easy to make. Not the most moist I've ever had but it was moist enough and everyone liked. I will make this cake again. The reason I gave this recipe only 3 stars is because the frosting is gross! It tastes like vanilla extract flavored sugar. Out of 11 people only one person liked the frosting. I followed the recipe exactly; did everything exactly. First of all its runny. I had to put it in the fridge for over an hour to get it firm enough to frost the cake. Then I had to put the cake back in the fridge immediately to keep frosting from loosening up again. It's gritty due to the sugar and tastes like vanilla extract. I will not ever make this frosting again.  Cake-most definitely. Frosting-NO! I honestly don't know how some of these people who commented actually liked the frosting!

Awesome recipe. First time making a red velvet cake and will keep this recipe for years to come! Be sure to use cake flour if at all possible - you won't regret it.

The cake was moist and tasted amazing. The only issue I had was the cake was really dense. I have never made red velvet cake before so maybe this is how it was suppose to be. I can't judge the icing as I used another one from this site.

Very moist and fluffy, but - perhaps because of the german products I had to use - there was nothing with "red velvet" and the frosting coagulated twice (i tried it again after wasting the first try). Will try it again a bit modificated due to german products.

Made this cake 2 times this week.  The first time did not turn out very good. I did not have pudding so I added extra cocoa.BIG MISTAKE, it was very dry, then as an afterthought maybe I could have used some mayonaisse to make it moist.  second time was MUCH better.  I followed the recipe for the cake to the T. and it came out perfect.  not as red as I thought a red velvet cake should have been. Next time I will try paste or gel color.

Only 4 stars because I used a different frosting instead of the one in the recipe. The cake was perfect.
