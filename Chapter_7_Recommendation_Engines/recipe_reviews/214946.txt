Very good.  But what should you serve on top?  My husband used ketchup.  I was unsure. Any suggestions?  I liked the chorizo with the ground beef.

With a name like "Devil's Meatloaf", I expected this to pack a punch, but unfortunately, it wasn't spicy enough for our taste, so we had to squirt on the Sriracha sauce. I'm always looking for new ways to "cut" a smaller amount of Chorizo w/ a different meat, only b/c it's such a rich, heavy sausage, and in all honesty, this meatloaf came out a little TOO rich (tummy-ache-inducing.) Happy to try out a new meatloaf recipe, but unlikely one that I would prepare again. (At least not as written ~ hotter BBQ sauce next time? Add jalapenos? Less chorizo -> more beef? /muse.

From a collection of leftovers found in the fridge this is an AWESOME meatloaf and very tasty. I've been a member on this site for over a year and this is the first review I've done. I make this meatloaf for my family an average of 3-4 times a month. Sometimes I'll use Spicy Italian sausage instead of the chorizo just to change things up a bit and I'll usually chop up a jalepeno or serreno pepper just to spice it up a bit more. It doesn't need any kind of ketchup or sauce to cover it cause it's already so moist especially when I cook it on my weber smoker which is what I'm doing tonight. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Great moist meatloaf to cook on the grill. I followed the recipe, very tasty as is. We like spicy foods, so only change next time is add a spicier chorizo or add some chipotle peppers.

I did not have the onion soup mix and it turned out great with the rest of the ingredients. 
For the top I added ketchup and bbq sauce, added some coriander and cumin to it. 
It was pretty good, will do again.
Not like regular meatloaf but a fun change of pace! I found this when searching under ingredients for stuff I had in my freezer.
