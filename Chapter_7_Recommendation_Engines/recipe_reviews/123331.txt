I made this with mayo (no yogurt on hand), and threw in a diced stick of celery and some leftover onion.  My salsa was a little mild, so I added some chili flakes.  For some reason, I thought this also called for pasta ... I bet it would be good mixed in.  Kudos for the tuna/salsa combo!!

I made this as a quick lunch for my kids and I. I used reduced fat sour cream instead of yogurt, homemade salsa that I pureed down and red pepper instead of green. I spread this mixture inside whole wheat tortillas and sprinkled on shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and a small amount shredded sharp cheddar cheese. We really liked this because it was both filling and a nice change on your usual tuna fish lunch plus it was quite budget friendly. Next time, I might add just a touch of homemade taco seasoning just to perk up the flavor a bit.

Quite good!  One of those simple "I can't believe I didn't think of this myself" recipes.  I used low fat sour cream instead of yogurt, and threw in some celery, and it turned out nicely.  Definitely perks up plain old tuna for lunch!  I'll make it again!

Was very good left out the corn and made into a tuna melt on a thin whole wheat bun.

Nice way to spice up the old hum-drum tuna sandwiches.  I added a dash or two of Chipotle Chile powder to the mix!

I made this for lunch the other day, and thought it turned out pretty good. Surprisingly it didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting, but it was still good. Next time I would probably add onion and since I used a mild salsa I would try a spicier one and see if that makes a difference. I liked it for a change from just the regular tuna salad. Thanks for the recipe, Jennifer!

This recipe is a great starter recipe for a healthy tuna salad. I made a few changes to it this time and it was fantastic. I added some chopped red bell pepper along with the green pepper. I also added 2 chopped green onions, a squeeze of lime juice and a dash of cayenne-- truly quick and delicious lunch!

This was absolutely delicious! Quick and easy too. I had to leave out the corn because I didn't have it on hand, but it was still good anyway. I also added a couple of shakes of Cayenne pepper which gave it a nice kick.

This is a good light and healthy alternative to traditional tuna salad, but it was pretty bland. I had to brighten mine up with some lime juice, a lot of salt and pepper, and a hefty dose of sriracha. If I made this again, I'd use just one can of tuna and definitely add a mixture of anaheim and poblano peppers instead of just bell. Maybe throw in a habanero or chile pepper too.

Incredibly easy recipe! I added some chipotle mustard and even substituted 1 can of tuna (only had the one can) with refried beans.  You cannot tell the difference!

I really didn't care for this. It was very bland and crunchy, which isn't how I like my tuna salad. Won't make this again.

I was really wanting to make tuna for dinner and i had most of the ingredients so i was glad to find this recipe!! I changed it up, though, based on what i had in my kitchen.  Instead of yogurt, i used a little bit of mustard and mixed in yellow pepper, mixed frozen veggies(peas, corn, and carrot) and black pepper.  I heated up a whole wheat tortilla and topped that with lettuce, low fat string cheese, salsa(Muir Glen Organic salsa is my favorite!) and the tuna mixture.  It may sound a little weird, but its what i had around my kitchen, and i loved it!! Different but delicious compared to my regular tuna, cheese and mayo mixture!

Good.  Sick of ordinary tuna salad? make this.  Good with crackers if you are looking for a light dinner, lunch, or a party snack!

This is really good! I didnt add green pepper. But I did add a little shredded low fat marble cheese and a hardboiled egg! Very different but a nice change from your regular tuna salad!

I was looking for an interesting twist on tuna salad, and this ended up being surprisingly good.  I am not a big fan of using yogurt in place of mayonnaise, but combined with the salsa it worked in this - I did not feel like I was eating a "yogurty" sandwich.  Salsa and tuna - I really never would have thought of that combination in tuna salad, but that also worked well for me.  However, even though I love corn I did not like it in this - it didn't taste right to me and did not look appetizing to me.  It wasn't horrible, but I think I would rather add some crunchy chopped sweet onion instead of the corn.  So with the corn, I'd give this a 3-star rating, however getting me to use AND LIKE yogurt this way deserves an extra star!  Thanks for sharing your recipe! I will make again, just sans corn next time. :)

For any traditional tuna salad lover, I do recommend this twist.  Great for a dip or a sandwich!
