This is one of the best soups I've ever made.  I did not have lemon grass or cilantro , but  squeezed a fresh seedless, lemon into the soup; then  split it open to place it  on top of the soup.  I added 2 cups of low salt chicken broth & a jalapeno.  Also used low salt tomatoes.  Even with the  coconut milk, its nutrition values were upper edge of reasonable within my personal targets.    I expect my adjustments have made it even better.   I will be making it often
