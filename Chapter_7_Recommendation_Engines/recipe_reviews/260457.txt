You haven’t had baked beans until you try this recipe. It’s SO good, and is a favorite at all my cookouts. We have a friend who refuses to eat any baked beans if it’s not this recipe. 

As the submitter please note I never use oil to grease the casserole dish. I use non stick cooking spray.

This is very similar to my mother's recipe and is really a crowd pleaser.  When I make them, I add chopped onion and a bit of molasses or golden syrup.  I also use a variety of canned baked beans and drain most of the liquid, otherwise the dish is too soupy.
