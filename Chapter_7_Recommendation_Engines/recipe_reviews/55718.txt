I did not particularly enjoy this.  FOr starters, it takes much longer to prepare than the recipe states - took me a full hour, and I even used pre-grated cheese!  Then when it finally came out of the oven, I thought it tasted OK, but nothing that I really enjoyed eating.  By the end of my serving I was wishing there wasn't more to eat.  And now I have a whole ton of leftovers I'm not too happy about, but I guess I'll be eating that the rest of the week. I definitely prefer normal rolled enchiladas to this.

I was looking for a recipe to take to a vegetarian friends house for dinner and to use up some leftover cojita cheese and I'm very glad I found this one.  This is SO good.  It's very, very flavorful and easy to make.  The prep wook for this could easily be done ahead of time and assembled and baked at a later time.

I used corn tortillas and refried beans, because I don't care for flour ones or black beans.  It turned out pretty good with salsa, sour cream and the sliced avocado on top.

It was easy (I prepped the veggies the night before), and very, very pretty! However, the flavor did not thrill me. It seemed to need more spices.
