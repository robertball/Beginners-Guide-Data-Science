This recipe turned out alright.  The pork itself was tender and flavorful but I'm undecided as to how I feel about peanut butter and pork.  It was definately interesting and worth a try if you like meat that is unique and on the sweeter side.

This could've used a bit more apple in comparison to the bread crumbs, but the basis is there.  Good flavor.  I would maybe add a little cider as a brine before stuffing and baking them if I made them again.

My guys (who love pork chops, apples and peanut butter) did NOT like this at all. My pork chops came out fantastic but they had to scrape the filling out.  :/

This had an interesting flavor and is different than other pork recipes.  I myself love the combination of apple and peanut butter so I was excited to try this.  I followed this mostly as written; but I only used about half the shallot called for and I used apple butter since I did not have apple jelly.  I also did not spray my frying pan with cooking spray (this is very bad when you have a good pan, it ruins the non-stick!!).  Since I used boneless loin chops, I only baked 15 minutes at 350 after browning.  Next time I think 10 minutes would be better.  I would make this again, but would leave out the shallot entirely to better meet our preferences.  I would also consider playing with some spices in the stuffing mixture.  I feel like this is a good starting point for a 5 star recipe.

It was not bad but not good enough to make again.
