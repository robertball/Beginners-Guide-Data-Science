I made this yesterday in a 9" x 13" pan-I doubled the recipe and baked it 18 minutes at 375* and then 48 minutes at 350*. It came out wonderful!!! Many compliments and I will make it again.
Thank you!!   Laura

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  It's super easy to make, but the end result definitely has a "custard" taste to it.  I'm not sure how one could make a no crust pumpkin pie without having that, though. If someone was expecting the same specific pumpkin pie taste they are used to, this recipe may not get the best results.  But if you're wanting to eliminate the crust and don't mind a little taste change, this could be just the thing.

This was really good.  I have made it several times since I first tried it and am always pleased with how it turns out. I used regular bisquick since that's what I had. I really like having the option to skip the crust if I don't have one and it really holds its shape well when served. I like to serve cool whip on top. Thanks Bea.

I used heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk and tweaked this by using the best of three recipes I had. Used Bisquick and just mixed it up in the batter. Also reduced the eggs to three.

i loved this because it is unbelievably easier and healthier than pumpkin pie! keep in mind that it ends up being almost like a pumpkin custard rather than pie, but it's awesome! i used reduced fat bisquick, fat free evaporated milk, and splenda in place of the white sugar. it was wonderful... my guests couldn't tell it was light at all!

I really liked this.  I just LOVE pumpkin pie, but usually can't be bothered with making the crust.  This pie was great!!  It tasted really good and was super simple to make.  I used a 9-1/2" pie plate and it need WAY more time to bake....10 minutes at 375 and just over an hour at 350.

We thought this was delicious (topped with lots of real whipped cream, of course).  I followed the recipe exactly.  For the biscuit mix, I used my own homemade mix, which consists of whole wheat flour / regular flour, and baking soda.  I will be making this again for Thanksgiving, and I don't plan on changing a thing.  Like some others said, baking time was much longer, but that was easy to monitor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is a great low fat alternative. Be aware-the size of pan it calls for will NOT fit all the ingredients. I used a 9x11 glass baking dish and it worked perfectly. I also cooked it at 375 for the entire time and it came out perfect. The texture is definitely more of a custard but if you bake it on 375 it solitifies perfectly and is not runny, just moist. Will definitely make again.

Like other reviewers, I noticed a custard type taste/texture, but it was still good. The boyfriend loves pumpkin pie and he ate it up!

Really easy and really tasty! Added 1 tablespoon of white granulated sugar. Had to cook an extra 30 minutes. Not sure if it was my oven or if it is because I live at high altitude.

This recipe works great!  I changed this recipe for 16 servings and used 1/3 cup of flour instead of the buttermilk mix. (I'm in China. We don't have buttermilk mix here) I made an EXTRA large pie and very deep, then baked it a little longer.  The key to a fantastic taste is also letting the pie cool for a full day.  It was devoured in no time! So, I'm making another one!

I really enjoy this recipe. My kids miss the crust but I'm glad to skip all those crust calories sometimes! I can also squirt a bit of whipped cream on top without guilt.

Great recipe! It was so simple to make and a big hit with my family and friends. I love recipes that taste great and are simple to make and this was the first pie I've found that falls into both these catagories.  This recipe is a keeper.

It was OK...a nice alternative to a not eating a fatty crust.  Everyone liked it, but not a fan favorte.  Sprinkled toasted pecans on top for some added crunch.

Tastes good, but it is definitely a different texture than pie filling.  It also took 25 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said!

Delicious!  For the 1/3 cup milk - I just used evaporated milk  - since I had a little left over from a previous recipe.  I also added 1 tsp. of almond extract, in addition to the vanilla.  I added some chopped, toasted pecans....and what made this very yummy - is I added 3/4 cup of those little round caramel baking bits (not the brickle bits - but Caramel!)!!!!!  Will make again!

Great pie recipe Bea! I made it in a 9" square pan, because, for some odd reason, I couldn't locate any of my pie plates. Very tasty and quick and easy to throw together.

This is not a pie I will make again. Fairly easy to make but the taste is fairly bland. I found out quickly those aluminum pans you buy in the grocery store are not 10". Made exactly as the recipe stated however the amount it made filled 2 9" pans to the top plus I had to cook them longer to get the centers done. I'm not a pumpkin pie fan (then why make it? for family!) but I made one for Thanksgiving that I actually liked. Lost that recipe, though, so thought I'd try this one since the ingredients were similar. I used Bisquik, though, since I didn't have buttermilk baking mix. I even added more pumpkin pie spice. Smelled great when making and my house now has a beautiful Christmas aroma from cooking but I wouldn't recommend this without a lot of tweaking.

I made this as a result of only having bread flour and noot wanting a dense crust; So glad I did!
My husband said he never wants it any other way and my 10 y/o son agreed. It was also a hit at our Thanksgiving potluck - I'm glad it's SO EASY to throw together. 
I did make a few changes to accommodate what I had in the kitchen - I substituted whipping cream for the evaporated milk, added a little extra nutmeg and cinnamon for that special pumpkin pie taste and also more brown sugar than white and only 3 eggs... YUM!

Keeper! As others have noted, it took longer to bake than noted, and is worth every minute. It is reminiscent of flan but fluffier and the "crust" takes on a slightly toasted meringue flavor. Easy and fun!

This one is great if you're too lazy to prepare or even buy a crust.  I made it for my grandmother and we polished off a whole pie in two days! Well worth not so much effort.
