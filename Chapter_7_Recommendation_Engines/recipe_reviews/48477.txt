As written, this dish is dry; but I've made a few adjustments that make it much better.  First, add some salt and pepper to the hamburger when cooking.  One can of tomatoes is hardly worth the effort - increase it to two.  I mix about 1 cup of light sour cream and about 1/4 cup of milk in with the soup.  Don't layer with the cheese.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake about 45 minutes.  Then, top with shredded cheese (I'm not sure what the point of a 1/4 cup of cheese is....increase it to your liking), remove foil and cook ~10 more minutes.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I followed exactly as written however, I could only cook it for 30 minutes as it was drying out and one whole onion was too much; 12 oz. of egg noodles was also too much. It tasted ok, but was dry. The second time I used 1/2 onion, plain diced tomatoes (not stewed), substituted mozzarella for the cheddar, used 1/2 package of noodles and cooked for about 20 minutes and it was very good.

No complaints here! It's very appropriate this dish is called Amish YUMzuti because it is delicious! I just took it out of the oven and had to try a little bit since it smelled so good when it was baking. The cheese made this glorious crust over the noodles, and that alone was enough to make me give this a five-star review. The combination of cream of chicken soup, canned tomatoes and ground beef sounded bizarre, but it is really complimentary. I used bow-tie pasta and greased the bottom of my baking dish with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. The noodles came out without any problems, and I'm thoroughly enjoying my tiny helping of this great casseole. Thank you for sharing, Karen! I'll be sure to make this again.

Made this twice so far!!  First time I followed the original recipe.  But it was a little dry and the noodles on top became crunchy.  The second time, I used two cans of cream of mushroom, doubled the garlic, and added chopped mushrooms to the beef and that did the trick.  excellent dish!

This was a great change from the everyday casserole. Even my hubby liked it even though he is not a big fan of casseroles.
The only modifications I made was to add another can of cream of chicken soup, about 1 cup of cheese and I used diced tomatoes with onions, peppers & celery and only 6 oz. of noodles.
I noticed some comments stated the noodles were crunchy...Tip:make sure all noodles are covered with sauce.
This is a definite keeper.

I read several of the other views.  I used cream of mushroom soup and thinned it out.  Next time I'll add 2 soups.  I also added more cheese.  I'll also plan on adding green pepper and mushroom when I brown the meat.

Overall it was good and we will add it to our meal planner!

I gave this 4 stars, but only because I altered it. I used Italian stewed tomatoes, added some chopped green bell peppers, 86ed the celery, subbed elbow macaroni noodles because I didn't have any egg noodles, and added tomato sauce because other reviewers said it was a bit dry. It was delicious! My kids loved it, which is a pretty big deal.

My husband is pretty amateur in the kitchen, but I handed him this recipe and he made it with no trouble at all.  The whole family enjoyed this meal.  It's the first recipe we've tried from this website and believe me it won't be the last.
Good comfort food.  Thanks for submitting it Karen.

I made this last night and we really liked it... I'm sure I will make it again.  It's easy to make, doesn't take a lot of prep time, and tastes great, plus the leftovers are great to take for lunch.

very tasty, but you have to add 1 extra can soup and i think maybe a half cup of milk mixed with it, tends to dry out while baking.

This is very bland. Needs more spices and definitely more cheese. Also, the proportions aren't right: too many noodles for the amount of other ingredients.

I love this recipe! It was not hard to prepare and the results were delicious. I did add: 3 times as much garlic, a half can of milk, 1 can of origal Rotel plus the can of tomatoes the recipe called for. I didn't have Cream of Chicken soup, so I substituted Cream of Mushroom, and I didn't have celery so I just left it out. I mixed the tomatoes, soup, and milk together while I browed the onions and garlic with the meat. I had some leftover jalepeno cheese that I added as an additional layer. My family loved it!

Pretty good, though bland. I would definitely add salt and use either another can of Cream of Chicken soup or actually prepare the soup and pour it over. Also, I would use a 2 cup size bag of cheese instead of the tiny amount it calls for.

This was great!  I was busy and didn't have alot of time to prepare something and this fit the bill.  The flavor of the chicken soup with the beef was surprisingly nice.  I made a mistake and bought a 28 oz. can of tomatoes and used it all because I thought the casserole might be dry otherwise.  Also, to avoid hard noodles on the top, I baked the casserole covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for the last 15.  It turned out great!  Next time I make it, I think I'll mix the chicken soup in with the meat so it will be dispersed throughout the dish better, and I'll stick with the 28 oz. can of tomatoes.

My entire family LOVES this dish.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I seasoned the meat with roasted garlic seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.  I also used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of Garlic and Onion seasoned diced tomatoes.  I didn't layer it, just mixed it all together.  Instead of just cheddar cheese I used Kraft Pizza Cheese (Cheddar and Mozzarella blend) and mixed a handful into the noodle mixture and then added more the to top.  I only cooked it for 25 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought it was pretty dry.  Maybe two cans of chicken soup would be better.

I am always looking for new ground beef dishes I adapted this recipe with help from previous reviewers to suit my taste and what I had on hand which is what I always suggest on a new recipe. Heres what I changed:  I used a box of macaroni & cheese noodles instead of egg noodles I used green pepper instead of celery since I was out of celery :)  I added salt & pepper to each layer  along with a touch of seasoning salt to meat only   I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce mixed together I added about 1/2 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream along with the cheese package from the mac n cheese to the cream of chicken soup & stirred well prior to adding to other ingredients.  I mixed it all together in the greased baking dish, covered it with marble jack cheese and sprinkled dried parsley on the top.  I baked it at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes until cheese was melted. It was very good.  Next time I will cook noodles a little less than al dente (or maybe use rotini?) because this version is not dry at all and noodles cooked more while baking.  I served with garlic bread.  Even my picky toddler ate it up!

My husband and I decided that this recipe was a keeper. We want to add another can of tomatoes next time. I didn't use the whole bag of noodles and I didn't bake it in the oven, so it didn't dry out. I mixed the cooked noodles and fried hamburger mixture together then added the soup and tomatoes, then I covered with as much cheese as I wanted and covered it till it melted on low.This saved an hour of baking time.

This is really good!! I was surprised as it sounded kinda like a mess & I can't pronounce the name, will call it Amish dish--but went with the reviews for something different for dinner. Made a double batch & froze one as someone recommended. This is a very good comfort meal, Has everything you need in it except the salad! I used kluski noodles and  used extra can of soup, lots more garlic, salt & pepper and a can of tomatoes with peppers, juice included, instead of stewed. Also added extra cheese. This would be good for leftovers. I think it will heat up well.

This dish was easy to make.  Even though I used the canned tomatoes with jalapenos, I found it to be rather bland. My husband on the other hand really liked it.  I will make the recipe again, but will add a few spices, maybe cumin and cayenne or oregano and basil.

A "good" & economical meal. I did add some all-season salt while sauting the beef and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to ensure that the dish didn't dry out in the oven. Also, (by accident) I grabbed cream of mushroom soup instead = mixed w/ a half soup can of milk. My boyfriend thought this was really good while others found it decent. If I make again, I might take another's advice and add some chopped bell peppers, sliced mushrooms and/or corn.

I changed this a bit, based on the other reviews.  I don't like celery, so I omitted that completely, and rather than layering the casserole, I just mixed it all together.  My husband and kids loved this, which for my kids to admit that is a feat!  I thought it was a bit bland and not really what I was looking for.  I will probably make this again for them though!  But I will probably tweak it a bit so that I can eat it.

This was good. I used 2 cans of soup and added 1 can of milk. I also used the 1/2 the fat campbells soups to cut back the calories. I didn't use stewed tomatoes, I thought that would be too bland so I used a can of chopped garlic & basil flavoured tomatoes instead. Pretty good.

I thought this was just ok.  I added mushrooms, used 2 cans of soup w/1 can of milk, used extra cheese and garlic.  I also used elbows, I didn't have egg noodles.  I think next time I make it, I'll just leave in the skillet and not bake it.

Pretty good. I over cooked it (which is not part of my rating) Which made a crustier top, but I king of liked the over cooked cheddar taste.  I made it per the recipe although I did omit the onion and added onion powder instead.  I also added 1/3 c. water to help with the dryness. It is better than hamburger helper.  My husband loves HH, but my daughters and I hate it...this was a good compromise...similar in a small way, but definitely better. Next time I try it I'm going to cook it maybe 40 minutes instead...the noodles had gotten too soft.

This was surprisingly tasty. I didn't think that the beef and cream of chicken would go, but they do. I made a few adjustments, according to other's suggestions. I halved the noodles (which proved to be the perfect amount), added a little bit of milk and sour cream (maybe 1/3 cup milk and 2 T s.c), and omitted the celery (mainly because I prefer celery to be fresh or cooked in a stew/soup). I then put the noodles on the bottom, then mixed everything else (except cheese) together and poured that over the noodles, then covered and baked for 30 min. Then I sprinkled cheese on it (just how much looked good to me) and then covered and baked for 10 more min. Turned out really tasty. I'll definitely make again and the ingredients are usually always in my cupboards.

Very good!! I did make some alterations... Used ground turkey and added salt and pepper while browning. Added some chopped mushrooms, fresh basil and fresh parsley as well. Used one can of condensed cream of mushroom and added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/3 cup milk as it needs extra liquid. I mixed it everything (minus the cheese) in the big pan I browned the turkey in and added salt and pepper to taste. Then dumped it into my casserole dish instead of layering. Covered with foil and added the cheese at the last 5 or 10 mins of baking without the foil on.

Everyone loved this recipe, and leftovers were quite good. The only change i made was the addition of diced green bell pepper, about 1/3 of one (had it on hand and wanted to get it used up.) i think it was a nice addition and shows the flexibility of this recipe. I did cover mine about halfway through when the top noodles started to brown up a bit, which i like but didn't want them to burn. i didn't find it like hamburger helper at all, which is what i was expected when i read the ingredients. it didn't say to drain the tomatoes so i didn't and all the liquid got absorbed during baking and gave it a nice flavor throughout. i did try the layering. i didn't find it hard, but a bit unnecessary. Wish i'd used more cheese. this was very tasty and i will certainly make it again

This recipe was just "ok".  Overall it was too dry and the top layer of noodles were baked hard.  Layering it was more of a hassle as the directions said to do it.  I will add another can of cream of chicken soup and combine the tomatoes and cheese.  I will layer the noodles, then meat, then soup mixture and top with cheese.  I think it will turn out much better.  One thing I did like about this recipe was the tablespoon of minced garlic added to the hamburger when browning.

REALLY good!  New family favourite!  I made it again at my mothers and instead of the cream of chicken soup used cream of mushroom, used leeks instead of onions, and added some of my moms homemade canned tomatoes and it was even better!  Only lasts 2 days in my house.

This recipe was okay, I followed some other peoples' suggestion and doubled the soup and added some milk.  I was really glad I did because it would have been extremely dry if I hadn't.  This is a very bland casserole, so if you are looking for something with a lot of flavor, I would suggest trying something else.

This was a really good recipe. My whole family loved this. Even the picky three year old ate it! The only thing we did different was adding French's Fried Onions to the top during the last five minutes of baking. We followed the advice of some of the other posters and added milk into the soup. The casserole was wonderfully moist. I wish I had added more cheese than what the recipe called for though. Some of my family loved the tomato in it and some weren't so keen on it. So for us adding it or not probably wouldn't make that big a deal. Try this easy to prepare and very filling meal, you will like it. Just one question though...where did the name of this recipe COME FROM???!!!

Great recipe!  I followed some suggestions in the other reviews, such as more soup and a cup of milk.  It turned out really good!  The diced tomatoes make it the best.  My family of 7 enjoyed it very much!

This was a nice, hearty dish.  I read the reviews before making it however, I went with the advice of adding more cream of chicken soup.  If I hadn't, it probably would have been too dry.  Next time I think that I will add some mushrooms.  Yummy!

Easy to make. I would make it again. I added an extra can of condensed soup (cream of celery) along with the cream of chicken.  Next time I would thin the soup out with some milk and pour this on top of the layers.

I love this! It takes a little bit of time but lasts for days. I add a can or 2 of sliced mushrooms and extra garlic. I also cook it till the sides get real crunchy but that's just the way I like it.

I also modified this recipe into a Tex Mex style dish. I added 1 package of taco seasoning while the beef was browning.  I also added 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro.  I added the diced tomatoes to the beef and not layered into the pan.   As another reviewer suggested I added 1/2 cup of milk to the soup before adding. I actually tossed the noodles into the soup mixture. I did a layer of noodles and layer of beef and topped with cheese.  Came out nice and not dry.  (i covered it with foil as well)

This was yummy!!  To combat the dryness others have spoken about, I made the soup like I was making it as a soup (meaning I mixed it with a can of milk) and added it like that....mine was not dry at all.  I also added salt and pepper.  I didn't layer it as the contributor suggested....I just kind of mixed it all together and then topped it off with a layer of cheese before putting it in the oven.  My kids LOVED this...I got "Your a good cooker, Mommy" from both of them.  This was also an economical dinner...I ended up with a huge casserole dish of this (feeding my family of 4, with PLENTY of leftovers) for about $10 in ingredients...can't beat that!!

This recipe turned out very good. I did however make a lot of changes based on what others had advised. I only used half of an onion and it was enough for me. I also used more minced garlic 3-4 cloves. I substituted 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with one can of milk mixed instead of the cream of chicken. I also double the cans of tomatoes and substituted mushrooms for celery because I am not a fan of cooked celery. I threw the mushrooms in with the meat when it was close to being done to just soften a little. Over all this turned out very well and was not dry at all!

After reading the reviews I determined some changes needed to be made. I used 2 cans cream of chicken with 2 tbs milk and an extra can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles (combined with the regular). I had a green pepper I needed to use and I threw in a 1/2 cup frozen peas that I wanted out of my freezer. I also added a little extra garlic in powder form as well as a tsp of hot sauce (a mild version) for some extra flavor. I'm glad I did, it would have been a little bland. I wound up not having shredded chedder like I though so I used a mozzerella and swiss, (next time I will run to the store and buy the cheddar. I also cheesed to taste. The kids loved it and it was nice comfort food meal. Next time I will not use tomatoes green chiles as it threw it off.

What a success! I, like other reviewers, was a bit skeptical about how ground beef and cream of chicken would go together but it's great! I added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel), and instead of celery, added a can of cream of celery soup, for a total of two cans tomatoes and two cans of soup. I seasoned some ground turkey with some mexican seasoning, upped the onion, and put plenty of cheese in the mix -- no layering. More cheese went on top and cooking it for about 30 minutes was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

Well... It tasted like goulash. Unfortunately,none of us really care for goulash. However we did eat most of it. 
Luckily, we had a lot of parmesan cheese on hand.

Not a fan. Very dry, noodles were burnt on the top, and don't want to serve it to my husband when he comes home from work.  A waste of ingrediants, should have read the reviews and added more stuff to make it moist.  I don't understand how this recipe got a 4 out of 5, when most of the reviews all say it's dry.  I just saw 4 stars out of 200+ rates and figured it had to be good.  Very disappointed.

This was so easy, filling; made enough for an army!  Great for our housing ministry; literally can feed our whole household.  Served it with fresh sauteed green beans and a fruit salad.  

Easy to increase for larger quantities.

There are better uses for these ingredients.  Usually I'm a fan of layering but there was no reason to layer this what-so-ever.  It did freeze alright.     If I ever make it again I won't bother to layer and I'll use lots of spices.  Also, the tomato chunks were too large with the diced tomatoes; crushed might be better.

this was pretty good- with some tweaking. I added an extra can of soup. After eating this I think if I try it again- which I probably will, I will mix the 2 cans of soup with a can of Diced tomatoes with the juice it seems silly to layer the soup and tomatoes when they blend together during baking anyway.  This recipes reminds me of goulash. I liked it and my husband- who is very picky ate 2 helpings.

As is this recipe would be very bland and dry.  Here's how I modified it:  added 2 cans of soup (mushroom and celery), lots and lots and lots of garlic and cheese, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Didn't have any celery so I skipped that.
Next time I think I might try using diced or crushed tomatoes instead of stewed that way they would spread throughout the dish instead of just big chunks here and there.  It would also help thin out the soup.
Another option would be to use softened cream cheese instead of milk.  Combine the soup and cheese really well, even with a little milk and use that.
Anyway, not bad!

I made this last night for supper and it was okay. I make other similar casseroles that I prefer. This one definately needs more seasoning. At least salt and pepper. I put it in the oven for the time required, and it was overcooked. I would reduce the cooking time by at least 20 minutes.

This was good but needed a little more seasoning, maybe while cooking the meat. Next time I will add corn to the casserole and instead of layering I will mix it all together then top with the cheese.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I did not have diced tomatoes or celery so I used one can of beans and celery salt.  When browning the meat I added the garlic and onion and seasoning with the meat.  I only did one layer.  I also used two cans of cream of chicken.  This was easy and everyone loved it.  I will be making this again and again.  I also used stew meat instead of ground beef.  Thank you Karen.

This dish turned out really well and tasted really good! I had no celery or stewed tomatoes, so I used cream of celery and a mixture of diced fresh tomatoes and pasta sauce instead.

I used bowtie pasta cuz that's what I had on hand. Having read the reviews, I whisked the soup (1 can cream of mushroom) and 1 can of milk together. 
  I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes in puree, to which I mixed a 10 oz. can of rotel. To the tomato mix, I added 2 tsp. chili powder, a generous squirt of hot chili sauce, and salt to taste.
  One other substitution. I used left-over brisket instead of the ground beef. (I know that's a regular comment of mine but, we b-b-q alot!)
  **We usually b-b-q on Sundays, smoking quantities of chicken, brisket, ribs, & sausage, even though it's just the two of us. We freeze portions for later in the week. Having a variety of cooked meats on hand to substitute in the many recipes found in this site means fast dinners on harried days that are fused with smoky, slow-cooked taste!    
  I used ALOT more cheese than called for, skim mozzarella. Just sprinkle til it looks like enough! This was yummy!

My Son said it should be named,"YUCK-azuti". Nothing blended together once it cooked. We had blobs of soup and then blobs of tomateos. Once I mixed everything up, it was a little better, but not something I'd make again.

Proportions in recipe are a bit odd, but it turned out all right.  I use more cheese than called for, next time I'd either use fewer noodles or another can of tomatoes.  Left the celery crunchy and thant was a nice touch.  Good leftovers.

I  added more cheese,  and an extra can of tomatoes. I  also mixed in done milk with the soup.  Baked at 400° for 35 min.   It turned out good. I  thought it needed something.... Ithink green peppers would have made it way better. 3 out of 4 kids thought it was okay.  Hubby put  hot sauce  on it.

It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste great either.  Sort of bland and did not reheat well.  I don't think I'll make it again.

As a vegetarian I'm always looking for a versatile ground beef casserole as it's easily substituted with frozen vegetarian crumblers.  I'll make this again but the following changes:
I found the cheese unnecessary so I'll omit that.
I didn't use crm of chicken as it has chicken bits so I used only crm of mushroom.  I will double that next time and add milk.  For some reason the tomatoes felt out of place.  Next time I'll use something that absorbs the flavor of other ingredients like zucchini and mushroom instead of overpowering tomato flavor.  And also keep the no yolks pasta so it's a little healthier.  Great base recipe for this veg head!

I did not follow the recipe as written, but used it as a guide along with the reviews to suit my family's taste. I cut back on the noodles, added 1 cup of chicken broth, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. I also used a can of diced tomatoes that were not stewed. I did not layer the ingredients, instead I just combined them all before pouring into the baking dish. I cooked it 30 minutes covered with foil, then uncovered and topped it with about 1/2 cup cheese and returned to the oven until melted. It turned out great. I think next time I will also add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis to kick it up a bit.
I only gave it 3 stars because I changed so much. It seemed that it would turn out bland and a little too dry as written.

This isn't something I thought I would like but I was pleasantly surprised. I added a little milk to keep it from being dry. This was a great casserole when I was short on time and looking for something I could make with what I had on hand.

Just okay.  Very bland.  You definitely need to add more moisture, I added an extra can of soup and is was still not overly moist.  The noodles to get crunchy on top and I mixed everything together instead of layering.  Maybe put foil over top for most of cooking.  Won't make again.

This was a tasty & easy meal.  I needed a very quick dinner so cooked everything and threw it into a crock pot on low for 3 1/2 hours- was perfect when we got home.  Hubby liked it with some added cayenne pepper in his portion.

This was a good casserole.  My only complaint is that it's a little dry.  Next time I'll use 2 cans of tomatoes and add some milk to the chicken soup.  I added s&p to the beef as it was cooking.

Not sure why everyone is saying this recipe was dry. Not the case here. I used 3 lbs of hamburger, 1 onion, 1 cream of chicken wirh 1 can milk, 1 can stewed tomatoes with juice, smothered with cheese. It turned out wonderful added salt and pepper on top. And poured the soup mixture on top rather than layering. It will be made again and again....Thank you

Need a bit more meat for my family, so will double the amount of GB next time.  I was out of canned tomatoes so used Rotel instead.  It was a good substitution for us as the dish would have been a bit bland without it.  Needs some salt and pepper during the cooking stage.  I doubled the soup and added extra tomatoes, but was still a bit dry.

I was desperate to make dinner and NOT go to the store, so this was okay.  I am hoping that it is better the second day, after it has been in the fridge all night.  I used two cans of tomatoes and I mixed in sour cream and milk with the soup, cream of mushroom, - as recommended by someone else.  Not a big hit with my kids.  :(

This was pretty good.  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't add any celery, since I'm not a big fan of it.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, since that is what I had on hand.  I only used about 8 oz of egg noodles - which was plenty.  And I added about 1/2 c. of milk to the dish too, since so many reviews said that it may come out too dry.  After I browned the hamburger, I mixed everything together in a casserole dish, including the cheese, which I used about a cup of, covered it and baked it for about 45 minutes.  My 11 month old loved it.  I did season it with salt and pepper, and I think I'll use a little more cheese next time.

I changed this recipe so much it was hardly the same recipe, but my daughter and my husband (who can be a bit picky at times) liked it so much I felt compelled to review. The one down side I think it had was the celery. I browned the onion, celery and meat according to directions (plus some salt & pepper to taste), but once this dish was done baking the celery was still crunchy - which I thought did not blend well with the rest of the ingredients  tasted a bit "raw". I used two fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the can of tomatoes, cream of celery soup instead of chicken, omitted the minced garlic, added salt & pepper to season and then mixed the entire thing up in a baking dish with cheese on the top. I only baked it until the cheese was nice and melted since everything was pretty much cooked before it went into the baking dish - If I would have baked it for the 1 hour directed the celery may have been softer, but if you would like to make this faster - maybe just omit the celery. Like I said my family really liked this even my husband and daughters everyone had seconds.

This was a simple, quick dinner that *almost* all my kids enjoyed.  My picky eater struggled her way through it, but everyone else liked it.  I did exchange green peppers for the celery.  Will make again, but will add more cheese, and probably more soup... didnt think it was anything like hamburger helper, though.

This dish was really good.  My husband and I loved it.  I did tweak it a little, I used bowtie noodles instead of egg noodles, 2 cans of mushroom soup, 2 Tbs of minced garlic, added real mushrooms (to the beef mixture while cooking) and large can of crushed tomatoes (that's all I had). I mixed everything up and topped it with the cheese.  I loved everything about this dish except for the celery, but my husband liked it because it made it crunchy, so leaving that in is up to you.  I will definantly make this again.

As many prior ratings have mentioned, cooking this dish for an hour is definitely not needed. However, it also depends on how tended you want your celery to be. I can't stand raw celery, but enjoy it if it's cooked so that it's very soft. So I cooked the dish for 25 minutes, then got two spoons and mixed the entire dish up and cooked for another 10-15 minutes. Everything came out perfectly cooked and delicious. I also used two cans of cream of chicken and a couple tablespoons of milk. Not only did this provide the dish with the needed moisture, but also allowed leftovers to be reheated without becoming dried out. I also like this dish because it has the potential to allow other ingredients to be added; ie: green beans, peas, etc. and also allows you to tweak the taste to your liking. I just used the basic salt and pepper and a little garlic salt but obviously any kind of spice could be worked into this recipe. You can't go wrong with a recipe that allows you to tweak the spices to your preference! This is definitely a recipe to file under the "comfort food" tab. It's a winner for us!

My husband an two kids loved this recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  I used a mixture of whole grain and regular pasta of various shapes.  I added SALT, ground PEPPER and a can of sliced BLACK OLIVES to the meat mixture.  I used diced tomatoes (not stewed) as that is what I had on hand.  I also used about 3-4 times a much mild cheddar cheese.

When I make it again, I will thin the soup with 1/2 a can of milk before layering with it.  I did'nt care for the way it stayed in globs.  I will also allow for 1 to 1.5 hours of preparation time.

This recipe is one of my favorites from this site. I love the combination of flavors, it's very different from anything else I've made. The only change I make is that I always use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken.

No recipe thus far has ever failed me when I look at the reviews, until now. This was horrible!  I followed the recipe except I added more garlic and an addition can of soup as recommended. I feel horrible that I wasted the ingredients.

My boys (husband and son) LOVE this, and so do I.  I don't like cream of chicken soup, and think it's too dry with just one can of soup.  I also don't like celery, so I use one can of Cream of Mushroom and one can of Cream of Celery to get the flavor. I under cook the noodles just a little so they aren't too mushy when it's done.  This recipe tastes even better after a night in the fridge.    This one is a keeper.

It was ok, a bit hamburger helpery. I used two cans of mushroom soup and added half a can of diced green chilies.  Would have been really bland without.  Still seemed like it was missing something.

This needed a little kick. Maybe crushed red pepper or Rotel tomatoes instead of just diced tomatoes. Also don't cook as long it had crispy cheese and noodles at the edges after an hour. But all and all not bad.

The version I made of this was pretty good for a quick dinner. I used spaghetti (for lack of any other pasta), but that turned out to be great! I skipped the celery & used cream of mushroom soup. Very good!

good, easy & a kid pleaser.  the only changes i make are adding seasoning salt to the beef while it's cooking and i don't layer.  i mix it all together then cook and it comes out fine.  (much easier that way!)

I made this just like 'Connie' did, but for the tomatoes I added Original Rotel canned tomatoes and also added about 1 12 T. of Tiger Sauce (anyone hear of it? You will find it in with your ketchup, BBQ sauces, etc. Delicious!) This dish was very, very tastey and my guys loved it. Will definately make it again.

I made this for my father while my mother was in the hospital. The main drawing point were the people who said it tasted like hamburger helper only better. He told me that it was the best thing he has ever eaten, (probably not, but it's nice to hear), and that anytime I want to make this, he will be more than happy to eat it. I followed others and used two cans of cream of chicken and diced tomatoes and more cheese. I will definitely make this dish again.

I used a little more garlic, basil flavoured tomatoes and mixed everything together instead of doing layers.  We all loved it, althought it was a little dry so next time I'm going to add a little chicken broth to the soup, and there will be a next time....thanks!

EXCELLENT...after adding the following to the existing recipe: cream of celery soup, basil, oregano,garlic salt, a small can of green chilies, one pkg. of frozen spinach. I mixed everything together, topped it with the cheese and a few of those crispy onions strings that come in a can.  Baked for 40 minutes.

This is a very hearty meal. It fed our family of five (two adults and three young children), and we had nearly half a pan of leftovers. As others have mentioned, it is a bit bland and dry. I also found that it was slightly overcooked after being in the oven for an hour. However, it was easy to prepare and with some variation, I think it could be a tasty addition to our family's menus.

Yep, this was good.  I thought 1/4cup of cheese sounded too light, so I added more.  Next time I'll use even more, as it wasn't cheesy or moist enough for my taste.  My hubby loved it though and it was easy to prepare.  Thanks!

this was very good.  i omitted celery altogether, added a green pepper instead (which was a great, colorful addition) and only needed to bake it for about 35 minutes and it was ready.  makes enough for a large family and reheats well the next day.

This casserole was very good. I left out the celery because I didn't have any and used two cans of cream of chicken soup, basil, oregano, extra cheese and some diced jalepeno peppers. I mixed everything together and topped it all with cheese.

Hamburger Helper 2.0 !
Very good recipe (with the help of the other comments).
My take:
1kg. of hamburger
Added 2 chopped green peppers, and 2 handfulls of chopped mushrooms to the cooking hamburger.

Sauce - 2 cans of cream of chicken + 2 cans of stewed tomatoes + a few squirts of *hot* sauce.

Once everything was ready for the oven:
Layer the noodles, cheese, sauce and hamburger mix twice.

Tasted great!

I added one can of milk.  It was pretty tasty, but a little bland.  I think next time I'll try throwing in some frozen peas or something to give it a little more something.

This was WONDERFUL!  I did not have the cream of chicken soup that was called for so I used cream of celery.  My husband loved it and took leftovers with him to work.  I will cook this again for sure.  Thanks Karen!

We really loved this one. I didb't cook it as long so it did not come out so dry. (except when you reheated) Also, I added the soup & tomatoes to the meat then divided. It was a lot easier. I didn't drain the juice off the tomatoes, either. Next time I am going to try some Rotel tomatoes for a little zing.

Good, but a bit dry and a little bland. Next time, I'll add more soup and tomatoes. Reheats well. Recommended for bachelors by Bachelor Steve!

This needed a lot more cheese and a fair amount of added seasoning to keep it form being bland, but it's a good "base" recipe.

The first time I make something I make it according to the recipe.  Then make changes later if I make it again.  I wasn't too sure about this and almost made changes but resisted as I dislike ppl who review a recipe they changed the daylights out of. :(   Long story, made according to the directions and was surprised but NO LEFTOVERS AT ALL.  My family of 4 ate the entire thing and my husband said I need to add it to the recipe book.  Simple, easy, quick, and tasty.  :)

The recipe was just ok the way written 3 stars. My teenagers did not mind it at all. I had a problem with the crunchy noodles because there was not enough sauce to cover them. I did make changes (I always cook one the original way and another my way so I can give an honest review.)I usually have to double a recipe due to having 3 teenage boys and an 8 year old that can eat you out of house and home. on the one I did my way I added a lot more cheese than called for, I also used rotell instead of stewed tomato. Instead of the 1 can of soup, I used 1 large can of soup. I also added salt, pepper, garlic, and basil for seasoning. It really does make a lot, but with all the teenagers here they ate till they were full and did not leave any leftovers for lunch the next day. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I took the advice of other reviewers and sauced it up with extra milk, tomato sauce and cheese. I also mixed it together instead of layering. We enjoyed it and gobbled it up with garlic toast.

I only had one problem, picture shows lots of juice so that could only mean I either used to much noodles and not enough juicy sauce other wise the flavor was good even though I did have to docter it cause i had to use what I had on hand.

Awesome, I mistakenly used too large shell noodles.  I would use smaller or the same as the recipe calls for.  Could half this recipe for myself and my husband as it makes a large amount

OMG! SO good!!!!!  I added salt & pepper to the browning meat.  I added about a half cup of water to the soup since others said it was dry.  I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  I didn't have celery so I went without. Instead of layering I mixed together with cheese and added cheese on top.  I will be making this A LOT!!!

It was good.   I added mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  It also needed general seasonings (salt, pepper, etc.)  Maybe using a 2nd can of soup and I definitely used much more cheese!  lol  Will probably make it again.

This was great. I doubled the tomatoes and used about 1.5 pounds of hamburg. I also didn't measure the cheese, so probably used more. My husband would have eaten four helpings if he could have fit it down without making himself sick!

I read reviews prior to making and kept seeing it was a bit dry. So, I forewent the celery and added 1 can cream of celery soup and one can cream of chicken soup diluted with half a can of milk to make spreading easier. Otherwise followed it to a T. Turned out great!

I'll be making this again! Doubled the recipe but really didn't need to double the noodles - just could have used a standard 16 oz bag. Also cooked and drained the meat before I added the onions,celery, etc because I didn't want to drain the veggie liquid too and used the liquid from the tomatoes and I was happy with the moistness of it. This will be a perfect meal to make in the morning and have on those nights when my afternoon is full.

Great, easy comfort food. I used one can of the cream soup, one can of milk, and about one can of sour cream.  Kids did not like the flavor of the stewed tomatoes, so maybe next time I wil just use regular ones.

This was pretty good.  Boys loved it but the adult in me needed more flavor.  No need to bake this, after I drained the noodles (I used angel hair) I placed everything in the pot and stirred until warm about 5-10 minutes.  Last 3 minutes I added my favorite cheese and it was done.  Added about 1 cup of sour cream to make it creamier.

Wow!  Quick, easy, and DELICIOUS!  I seasoned 2lbs of meat with garlic salt while cooking.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatos and used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cheddar soup!  I baked covered for 45 min.  Sprinked cheddar cheese on top (about a cup) and baked for 15 more min.  I couldn't wait to taste it!  I was soooo good!

We liked this meal; however, we did find it a little bland even after the extra seasoning I added so I will have to try it again with even more seasoning next time.

This was really good.  I didn't have any celery so I used celery salt and doubled the tomatoes and soup.  I also mixed the soup and tomato mixture together then layered.  added more cheese then called for as well.  Also, I had some cream cheese so I put that on both layers as well.  this would be super good with mozzerella cheese! really  creamy and good!

The first time I made it I used the exactly recipe. The next time we had it  I used two cans of cream of mushrooms soup instead of cream of chicken and added some mushrooms, green, yellow, and red peppers. I also drained the tomatoes Half! My husband likes food thicker. My kids, husband, and grandparents love this recipe. For more spice add diced tomatoes with green chillies.

I made this as listed but used Wacky Mac (different sized/flavor noodle mix) and probably 1/2 to 1 cup of cheese instead of the egg noodles & 1/4 c cheese. My younger boys (5&9) & I loved it. I would probably double everything but the noodles next time because there were no leftovers and of course gotta have extra cheese.

I thought this was a great recipe. It did sound a little odd at first, but I gave it a try. I thought maybe it would be better to mix everything in one big pot and then maybe bake it. It seemed strange to try to layer everything. I also increased the cheese and would use less noodles next time. I only baked mine for 30 minutes, and all in all i thought it was pretty tasty!!

This was just okay. I followed the suggestions in other reviews and added an additional can of diced tomatoes and milk to the soup. I added green pepper, mushrooms, extra garlic, salt and pepper. It was just a bland dish that I don't plan on making again. I'm giving it 3 stars because my supportive husband says it tasted okay, just needed a little nore spice.

Sorry, but we did not care for this dish. It reminded me of a jumble between Hamburger Helper, Tamale Pie and Beef Stroganoff. We will not be making this one again.

This was pretty good, but a little dry even with adding extra soup and milk.  It had good flavor, but my picky family said not a keeper.

This is a good dish.  However, as a personal preference I will leave the tomatoes out next time.  I will also use more cheese.  I added 1/4 c. of milk to the soup...because other reviews said it was dry, and it worked out good.

Where did I go wrong? Mine came out like actual soup. Added extra half can of soup because of the 'dry'ratings. It does have potential if you throw in some spice- I used a little Tapatio.

Delicious dish and easy to assemble.  However, I added two tablespoons of taco seasoning to flavor the beef.  My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I will make it again

I omitted the celery and added some seasoning salt to the ground beef as well as some milk to the soup and it was delicious!! I also used slightly less noodles, maybe about 10 oz. instead. My family likes alot of cheese so I upped the cheddar and cooked the entire thing for about 35 minutes. That seemed to be plenty. It wasn't dry at all. IT was moist, tasty and just plain a keeper!

A wee bit bland for us. Also, did not like the taste of the cooked celery in it at all. This recipe is missing something - although I am not sure what. Will just move on to other beef/noodle casserole recipes.

Excellent!  My husband made this for a birthday dinner and it got rave reviews!  He omitted the celery and garlic and used condensed mushroom soup instead of chicken soup.  Also added about half a jar of spaghetti sauce and a little dried basil.  It is a keeper!

My picky family loved this!! I did change a couple things. I added two can of the Cream of Chicken soup and put 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese on each layer. I used rotini noodles (becuase that is what I had on hand)and I used the whole 16oz box. It turned out awesome and I will definately make it again!

This is absolutely delicious! One of my favorite meals from this website. 

I read some other reviews before I made it so I did alter the recipe to avoid the dryness factor. I doubled the garlic, added mushrooms and a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and doubled the tomatoes as well. I also topped it with some grated Parmesan. Superb!

I modified this recipe and it came out pretty good.  I used a half turkey/half hamburger mix, some worchestershire sauce, no celery, 1 pkg (2 cups) Kroger casserole cheese, 2 cans cream of chicken.  I used the diced tomatoes, but nobody liked them, so I'll take them out the next time.  It really does taste like Hamburger Helper.  I will definately make this in the future as it is very simple, quick, and can be prepared ahead of time and stuck in the fridge until needed.

This is yummy!!!
Modifications I made: diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of stewed, lots more cheese, two cans of cream of chicken soup, and chile powder in meat mixture and on top of cheese layers. Really good!

We had this about 2 weeks ago, and it was great!  My hubby couldn't say enough. I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I just used petite diced and mixed it with cream of chicken soup. Not sure how much cheese I actually used, but it was a lot and it was good!!!  Thanks for this comfort food meal!!

Not eye-popping spectacular but an excellent stand-by when you have ground beef that needs to be used.  I didn't even tell my husband about the earlier reviewer's comparisons to Hamburger Helper and it was the first thing that he said that it was like.  In it's defense, it is like Hamburger Helper in that it is ground beef and egg noodles mixed but it is much tastier and a mere fraction of the sodium (not to mention the preservatives and whatever else is lurking in Hamburger Helper).  I made the recipe as it is written (minus the celery because I didn't have any) and 2cups of cheddar (we may have a cheese addiction in my home).  Good comfort food and like I mentioned earlier, a nice reliable, stand-by meal when you have the ingredients.

My husband raved about this dish!!  He loves casseroles and this one is definitely on our "repeat" list.  The only changes I made was to add some Rotel tomatoes to zip it up some, I used about 3/4 of the 12oz. bag of noodles, added a can of cream of celery soup (I didn't have any celery on hand at home), and added a little milk to the mix.  I didn't layer it, I just mixed it all up.  Also, since everything is already cooked, I only baked it for 35 minutes, until everything was bubbly hot.  We couldn't wait until the next night for the leftovers!!

Using other reviewers' comments, I halved the amount of noodles, used petite diced tomatoes (not stewed), and a dash of cayenne.  Cooked for 30 minutes, and it wasn't dry.  This just didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked even after adding the cayenne and 3 cloves garlic.  Perhaps I will make again with a different kind of cheese.  Good starter recipe.

This was just ok. I had to do a fair amount of "doctoring" to make it eatable. I added plenty more spice (salt, pepper, cayenne, celery salt, garlic powder) and I think next time, I would add more meat. The cooking time seemed suspect too. Why do you need to bake this for an hour when all of the ingredients are already cooked? My casserole was bubbling at 35 minutes and the cheese was drying out so I took it out and it was fine. The only reason I'm not giving this recipe a 1 or a 2 is because this casserole is great for a big family and is very cheap to make. Also, I used macaroni noodles instead of egg and swiss cheese instead of cheddar, this gave it a more grown up taste.

This was a great recipe, but I too altered it with twice the Rotel and cheese, I added crushed red pepper and creole seasoning- spicy and yum!  I only had ground venison- it was perfect. I think next time I will use less noodles and maybe more meat.

This was a really good dish!  I put a lot of cheese in it and did not find it dry.  Pretty easy to fix, makes great leftovers and big enough to feed the entire family.  I put some celery seed, salt and pepper in the ground beef along with the garlic, onion and celery.  I am not a huge fan of celery and plan to leave the fresh celery out next time I make it.

I made this with salsa instead of tomatoes, and upped the cheese as per other reviewers. The kids ate it but no seconds, the adults on the other hand really liked it.

My hubby liked it because of the cheese. It was ok, even after the third time making it. Each time doing something different. This time I added 1/4 cup of sour cream as recommened. It was an improvement.

Good dish, tasted a bit like a home made "Hamburger Helper" type meal.  I only had a few changes.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that had green peppers in it, I used lots more cheese, and I used two cans of the cream of chicken soup.  Will make again.

I am so reluctant to give a poor review but this was really bland.  It did make enough for an army.  We thought it was ok but had to add a lot of salt and also ended up adding Italian and Greek seasoning.  One child loved it and one did not like it.  I do not think we will have it again.

I used 8oz. egg noodles, more garlic and more cheese. I also used 2 cans of soup-cream of celery & cream of chicken mixed with a little milk. We are eating the leftovers tonight.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this following the basic recipe with a couple of changes.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed/diced ones.  I also mixed all the ingredients together and then topped the casserole with another 1/2 cup of cheese.  It turned out really great!

I added extra ingredients as was suggested by other reviewers.  Instead of adding celery I used one extra can of cream of celery soup, basil, oregeno, and a small can of green chili's. I did mix all ingredients together rather than layering. I also doubled this recipe because I had a lot of company, and this meal go's a long way!  All thought it was fantastic!

I tried this recipe last night and it was absolutely delicious.   I followed the recipe almost exactly (I didn't have any celery), with no problems.   There are only two of us and after lunches today, only one serving left.  Excellent.

I used this as a freezer recipe by combining everything except the cheese and noodles and freezing it to use later.  I pulled the "sauce" out of the freezer, defrosted it and layered it with the cheese and noodles.  It was a big hit! Even the baby liked it and my husband liked it so much he asked me to give his mother the recipe, which is the highest honor.

Overall, the dish was good.  A little bland - even after I added extra spices.  My husband really liked it.  A good and easy recipe to do substitutions/additions/modifications with.  Adapts easily to suit the ingredients you have on hand.

This recipe was ok.  Sort of like hamburger helper.  It seemed like it was missing something so I added some sour cream just before serving.  It was better with the sour cream but it still seemed to be missing something.

I read some of the reviews and noticed that you were suppose to keep layering each item so instead I First sauteed diced celery, chopped onion and garlic. Add ground beef, salt and pepper to your taste. Brown ground beef. Then I added two cans of mushroom soup, ( only kind I had on hand.) 1 1/3 can of milk.I then added a can diced tomatoes and 1/4 c of pace pacante medium.
Simmer for at least 1/2 hour, longer if you have time. I didn't have the egg noodles so I used a 12 oz box of Vegetable Trio Rotini. I then sprayed the bottom of my broiler pan with Pam added the noodles as directed and layered with sauce and grated colby cheese. I thought it was great! To complement the dish I made a fresh spinach salad with mandrin oranges, crumbled blue cheese, scallion onions and pecan halves. MMM

Good but needs a little more seasoning. Salt and pepper would help. I subbed green peppers for the celery and cut back to 8oz of pasta.

I used Italian sausage (out of gr.beef) also added can mushrooms, 1 can Rotel and 1 can diced tomatoes.  Added shredded cheddar cheese, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  I cooked the pasta separately and added later.Very good recipe.

Very good! Whole family ate it.
I made some changes used mild salsa in place of the tomatoes (i didnt have any)  it gave it some flavor. Also used one can of cream a chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. didnt dry out at all.
Will make again.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as written. It was awful. Very dry and yucky. The second time I made it, I only used 8 oz of elbow macaroni, added half can of water to the soup and liberally sprinkled Montreal Steak Seasoning. Instead of layering, I mixed it all together before baking. What a transformation this recipe made! It is delicious with these modifications. The cream of chicken soup/stewed tomatoes mixture is delicious.

A really nice casserole!  I have served this to company on several occasions and always get requests for the recipe.  The few things that I do different is using two cans of cream of chicken soup with a bit of milk to thin it out and I add fresh mushrooms to the meat mixture when I cook it.

This recipe is delicious!  I double the cream soup and add a tablespoon of Chili Garlic Sauce (the heat is cooled by the soup and cheese - delicious effect!)  It is SO easy to add veggies to this recipe to make it healthier!  We always add zucchini, mushrooms, diced tomatoes and spinach.  I also have added green peas.  I think green beans, broccoli or spaghetti squash could be added as well (at some point I may reduce the noodles to make room for all the veggies!)

Thanks for the delicious base to work off of!  We love this comfort food!

I was attracted to the "Amish" bit! :D  Now, the original recipe is a 4 but make some adjustments and it's a quick, easy dish ready to please the whole house.  As suggested, I used two cans of soup and poured a tiny bit of milk as well.

I changed this up a bit. I added sauce to the tomatoes and milk to the soup. I mixed it all together and instead of putting the cheese on the top i added it to the mixture and used a lot more then suggested. I also added balsamic vinegar, which is the extra kick i feel this needed. I also skipped the celery. I put in lots of extra garlic and used onion power instead of onions. Oh and i added salt to the meat while it was cooking and then a little more to the whole mixture. Next time I think I might add black olives, an extra can of tomatoe, and possibly artichoke hearts.

This was just ok, we all felt that it was missing something.  I double the soup & tomatoes as suggested by previous users.  I thought it could use more hamburger (1.5-2 lbs).  We also thought it would taste great using Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  Might be something to try if we ever make this again.  I baked it at 375 for 35-45min.

I thought this was just ok.  I thought it tasted a lot like something you'd get from making Hamburger Helper.  I don't think I'd make it again considering the time it took to make when I could probably just make something similar-tasting out of a box (although I'm sure this is probably healthier).  The only thing I changed was that I didn't use celery because I did not have any on hand and I also used probably closer to a full cup of cheese.

my family loves this dish...of course, we also experimented with a few changes...try adding Rotel to beef instead of the tomatoes, onion and garlic.  also, add a can of cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken..dish turns out very moist afterwards.

I can see why people complain that this is a very dry dish.  I doubled the soup called for and I thought it was barely okay for sauce quantity.  My husband loved the flavor and I'll be making this again probably doubling both the soup and the tomatoes.  I also used fat free kraft sharp cheddar slices instead of regular cheddar which helped make the sauce have a creamier consistancy.  Use low sodium soup and tomatoes to help lower to sodium content.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I modified it b/c my husband doesnt eat tomatoes, so I added mushrooms and tripled the amount of cheese it called for, using cheddar, colby, monteray jack and just a little bit of parmesan.  Not one bite left of leftovers!

If you take all the recommendations to CHANGE the recipe and then my recommendation to almost double the meat required - then it's good. I gave this a 3 rating because there's so much more you have to do to the original to make it more flavorful/less dry/more meaty. It's good when it's all said and done.

My husband and I both like this and will definitely make it again.  We both felt it needed a bit more salt.  I also thought it was just a little dry.  When I made it I added half a can of water to the cream of mushroom soup.  The next time I make it I will add a full can of water to the soup and it should be perfect.

My husband said: "This is a keeper". It was very good! It wasn't dry, we enjoyed the different flavor. Not the same old thing! I did make some changes and I was loose with my measuring (like not measuring the celery). I used less noodles. I don't use soups because I want to avoid MSG and other additives. I make a cream of soup mix, then when I need it for a recipe, that is what I use. Anyway, it turned out very good. Oh yes, I used about 3/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese--1/3 cup on 1st layer, the rest on the top.

Very good. It doesn't sound like it would but it has a different flavor from the same old same old casseroles we have been having around here as of late. The only change was I used processed cheese on top as we were out of good old cheddar, believe it or not. But it was very good nonetheless. Good on the fly as it was a late night at work too.

Very average and I don't think I'll be making it again.  I felt it was a little greasy and the noodles got mushy (and they were definately al dente going in).  I made this recipe as is except I added 1 can of milk to the soup.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I left out the celery and added some crushed crackers for texture.

I used whole canned tomatoes and chopped them up so I wasn't sure how runny the sauce was supposed to be. I put mostly the tomatoes over the pasta, doubled the meat and the garlic. I also poured a thin layer of jarred spaghetti sauce with meat flavor over the top of the pasta so it wouldn't dry out. I topped it with tons of cheese for the last 10 minutes and in the end it was super tasty!!!! We all enjoyed it though my husband did ask why we don't just start buying Hamburger Helper. :P

I double the recipe. I added one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery, three cans of tomato, a cup of light sour cream and I added three shredded zuchini and one shredded carrot. It turned out really good. I added some cheese mixed in but skipped adding it to the top. My family loved this and the kids didn't even know they were eating veggies.

We made this recipe with an extra can of cream of mushroom soup because of the other reviewers reporting dryness, and substituted turkey meat for beef. The meal was pretty good, not exceptional. For me, it had a little too much of a celery taste. Overall it was pretty good, though if I make it again I will maybe reduce or remove the celery and would add some more tomatoes. Perhaps I would also add some peppers to give it a little kick, it was a bit bland for me.

This was pretty good.  I double the cream of chicken soup and tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Nothing too fancy, but a good simple casserole.

A little odd for us.  This is our first ever casserole and we all kind of just looked at when it came out of the oven and said "huh".  Better than we had anticipated but nothing we will make again.

I used ground turkey and half of the noodles called for.  I also used two cans of cream of chicken soup.  I chopped the celery fairly small.  I mixed it all together and added more cheese.  I baked it uncovered for 45 min.  We loved it!  Very good flavors.

We did not like this recipe. I added the extra can of soup and it was still tasteless. Hamburger helper is cheaper and easier. If I was going to have this type of meal I would just stick with that.

This dish lacked some flavor, so I added some grated parmesean cheese and nature seasons.  It was good after that.  I gave 3 stars because I had  to alter it to taste really good.

We thought this was really good. I left out the celery. I didn't have ground beef on hand so I used left over sirloin steak sliced thin. I sprinkled chili pdr. over the top before adding cheese. My husband thought it needed more cheese on top. Following other's recommendations, I cut down on the amount of noodles.

I strayed a bit from the recipe.  I didn't have egg noodles so I used penne pasta.  We don't like chunks of tomatoes so I used tomato sauce.  Also omitted the celery since we didn't have any.  It was so-so.  It tastes NOTHING like Hamburger Helper so I don't know how reviewers could even think that.  We eat Hamburger Helper at least once a week and it's nothing like it.  It's missing something.  It has a funky after taste too.  Maybe next time I'll mix in sour cream after baking.  Will probably also omit the cream of chicken and use something else.  Will make again but will tweak.  It's an ok base recipe.  Don't plan on cooking this for guests until after you've done the tweaking.

True comfort food.  I did not use the tomatoes and added extra cheese.  It was kind of like Hamburger Helper, but without that nasty powdered cheese.  The husband and the kids really liked it.

Loved this recipe. I made only half a recipe and baked it in a glass loaf pan. I used a whole can of cream of chicken soup and thawed tomatoes from my garden that I froze last summer. I did use more cheese. Will make it again.

I really liked this recipe and so did my family, the only thing I would change next time is, instead of layering it, I will mix it all together and top with the cheese, seemed a bit dry otherwise, but definately will make again.

it was really good. i didn't have any noodles, so i used white rice instead. i also used fresh cluster tomatoes instead of canned, and cooked them in the beef mixture. 
delicious!
p.s. i also seasoned the meat mixture generously with lawry's

My family loved this dish. I used two 10 ounce cans of the cream of chicken and next time I'll add more diced tomatoes. But over all this will be a favorite of ours for years to come...thank you!~!!!!!

This smelled absolutely wonderful while baking... my kids couldn't wait to eat!  I did add a little cayenne pepper for some zip and extra cheese.  I will definately use two cans of soup next time....mine needed more liquid.  Maybe 1 cream of chicken, 1 cream of celery. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out well!  I did not add as many onions as husband does not like them. I also added LF sour cream and skim milk to the soup mix.  Put cheese on last 10 min or so to prevent drying out.  Makes ALOT for 2 people!  Next time I will def add more tomatoes

Very good casserole, sort of a hungarian goulash baked in casserole form.  I used the low fat and sodium COC soup, and increased the cheese to "a few handfuls" (my regular cheese measurement).  Very nice dinner, will make this again and again.

This was OK. It was filling but nothing great. Added 1 extra can of mushroom soup in the layers. Also added more cheese and salt, pepper, and garlic powder in the beef. I really like garlic. The cheese needs to be put on the top about 20 mins before done. The crust was too hard and crunchy. The extra can of soup made the middle moist and good. I save 5 stars for something special. Probably will not make this again. Filling but not a winner.

This is nothing gourmet but is a kid pleaser. My family liked this meal alot, and i will likely make it again. I put the stewed idced tomatoes in the meat mixture afte rit was brown, so i could get a better sense of the flavouring.I still think something was missing despite 6 cloves of garlic, italian seasoning and basil.  But the majority wins out on this one.

This taysted like hambuger helper, but a little better. I put lots of cheddar cheese in it. When I added the tomatoes, I included some of the juice.  I didn't like the flavor this gave it,next time would not add any juice.

This was good but I didn't think it was anything spectacular.  I went with some of the suggestions to add another can of soup and if I wouldn't have, this would have been a bit too dry.  I added extra cheese, salt & pepper, and extra garlic.  This was a bit bland but still had a good comforting flavor.

This receipe was so easy to make, however I did not add the celery and I was too lazy to add the garlic so I added stewed tomatoes with garlic already in them.  It was so good that even my husband, how is so pickey had 3 helping of it.  We had it for leftovers the next night and it was even better.  This is one dish that I will make more often... Thanks for posting it..

This was delicious, I added some more garlic, and some onion salt, and some parsley. I think next time I will also add a can of cream of mushroom soup as well, all in all everyone at my house loved it, even my picky daughters!

I do not know about the others who tried this recipe - but it turned out PERFECT for me.  Yes I did add a little salt and pepper to the ground beef while cooking that part - but other than that I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  It was not at all dry and my whole family LOVES it. I thought it was going to be a strange combo at first - but it was really refreshing.

This dish is very good, I "kicked it up a notch" with 2 tblsp salt, oregeno, basil, and cajun seasoning (in lue of pepper).  also try some sour cream when serving. Feeds an army. very hearty

I tried added a second soup like some other reviwers suggested, but noodles still ended up crunchy.  We didn't care for it.

This was great!  I added bell pepper in place of celery, used plain diced tomatoes, added sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives. I made a sauce out of the cream soups.  I used 3 cans total (2 cream of celery and 1 chicken) stired in 1 1/2 soup cans of milk, the juice from the mushrooms and tomatoes and added some sherry. Sauce was a little bland so I added dried parsley, black pepper and beef boullion granuales.  Insted of layering I just mixed every thing together and put in baking pan and topped with herbed bread crumbs. Yum!!  Will make great leftovers for lunch!

i thought this was really good. like other reviewers i used two cans of condensed soup(one low fat cream of mushroom and one low fat cream of chicken). i also had leftover salsa from the super bowl so i used that instead of the stewed tomatoes. very tasty.
