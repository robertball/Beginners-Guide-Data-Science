I made one change and that was using lemon-lime soda instead of water. I made no other changes. I used dixie cups to make ice pops instead of popsicle molds. I just set the cups on a flat baking sheet, poured the ice pop liquid into the dixie cups 3/4's of the way up and let them firm up in the freezer before inserting the popsicle sticks. The kids and I love these. Super simple and really cheap to make.

These were yummy!  We froze them in a popsicle maker set I got at the dollar store, and they tasted great.  I thought of maybe stirring in some cool whip next time to make them "creamy" tasting but I don't know if they'd freeze hard.  These were just the right sweet/tart taste.  Thanks!

I'm always looking for short cuts with recipes and this one was no different. Don't make the same mistake I did on this one. I just threw EVERYthing into the blender at the same time. I ended up with alot of froth and the ingredients seperated in the popsicle molds. I only had 2 popsicle molds (8 popsicles total) and had tons of mix left over. I think the servings on this is quite a bit off. We ended up drinking the rest (which was also good)  I personally thought they were a bit too tangy. I puckered my lips with the first bite. All the kids loved them so the recipe gets a 5 star!

I think these are pretty good.  They are a little more icy than I'd like--I guess I've gotten used to those whole fruit bars you can buy!  But otherwise I like them.  Bf thought they were too sour.  I didn't, but I love sour.  I had some mix leftover, so I put about 1/4 cup of sugar in the leftover and will freeze that to see if he likes that better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Drink that can be made in to an adult drink with a little Vodka or Peach Schnapps. Love it on the deck on a warm Summer night.

I made mine with Crystal light, since it was handy.  Made a nice treat but I wasn't a big fan of the texture... very much like eating ice, barring the flavor.  I wish I knew how to make it softer.  The mix tastes great just as lemonade, though.

These are great!  I made them for the kids and poured them into molds.  I had extra juice left and kept it in the fridge.  When the kids had one of the pops, we cleaned the molds and re-filled them with the leftover juice.  The kids liked having these as snacks after school.  Since it's the same as giving them a glass of strawberry lemonade, I felt comfortable letting the kids have these as snacks, I didn't feel like I was giving them dessert.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This produces a nice tangy popsicle reminiscent of lime flavor (a good sweet/sour combination).  There is definitely room to play here with different fruits and juices.  Everyone so far has loved it.

These are very good although they are a bit tart! I added a little sugar and halved the recipe to fill only 4 molds and still had some leftover but it wasn't a big deal

Easy to make...used fresh strawberries since in season.  Perfect balance between sweetness of strawberries and tartness of the lemonade.   Delicious and refreshing.

This is so simple and perfect for hot days. I puréed 1.5 pints of fresh strawberries instead of frozen because they're in season and it worked great.

Easy and delicious! I had pink lemonade and frozen whole strawberries in the freezer.  I made 6 pops with the one mold I have...called friends and added some rum to the remainder because it's March and it's in the 80's in Florida!

I just got some strawberries (I just eyeballed the amount of strawberries) 
Then, I hulled, washed, and cut the strawberries into quarters. Then I added about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, a little water, and then I blended it until it was smooth. Then I put them in the freezer for about 4 hours and they were delicious.

These popsicles were ok but a lot of them had random jello textures spots that were not pleasing to discover. Other than that the taste was great.
Thanks!

I cut the recipe in half, and it still made 12 popsicles.  I must have small molds.  I froze the leftover mix into cubes, which were good in juice and water.
