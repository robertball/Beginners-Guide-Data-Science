With this recipe, Elliana has come up with a classic and near authentic French beef stew, or "Boeuf a la Bourguignonne" and has the perfect blend and balance of flavors. Doubling the sauce is not necessary; there is more than enough. The sherry is not critical if you don't have it, and beef base or a little reduced beef stock could easily be substituted for the demi glace. I added some fresh minced garlic with the onion and used a French Pinot Noir, though any full-bodied red wine would work. I used top round, but I think I would have been more pleased with just regular ol' stew meat or a rump roast, cut into 2-inch chunks. Probably the most useful suggestion I could offer regards the cooking method itself--rather than simmering on the stovetop for 3 hours, I'll at that point in the preparation finish it in a 300-325 degree oven for a few hours. The heat will be more uniform, it will free up the stovetop, and elimate the need for stirring or peeking. I served this with smashed new potatoes and "Shaved Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Almonds" from this site. Not a fancy dish, just comfort food at its finest.

What a great recipe.  So much better than others I've tried that just seemed too much like stew.  I have a great tip for the herb bouquet that I learned from Tyler Florence on Food Network.  Instead of using cheesecloth to wrap the herbs, take a slice of uncooked bacon and wrap it around a bundle of rosemary and another piece to wrap around some sprigs of thyme.  Cook these in your pan as the first step until you render out some of the bacon fat and the bacon is nicely browned.  Remove the bacon/herb bundles and proceed as directed.  You then can add the bundles back when directed in the recipe to simmer in the sauce.  Since the recipe calls for using bacon drippings this really works well.  I opted to chop my fresh parsley and add it at the end with the mushrooms.  I used good quality beef base to make my broth and as a substitute for the demi glace.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as recommended by other reviewers which is definitely the way to go.  Just make sure you have a good amount of meat so the ratio is correct.  Served with mashed potatoes (to soak up all that gravy) and peas and carrots.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this website.  Takes some time, but worth it, and doesn't require you to hover around while it simmers for 3 hours.  It just looks like beef stew, which I'm not a big fan of, but it is so much better than that!  On the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce including the beef broth mixture, the sherry & wine, and am glad I increased the quantity.  The gravy is very good!  The recipe says to cut the beef into 3" pieces, but I cut it into 1" pieces.  I also tossed the bacon in from the bacon drippings.  I did not have a clue what beef demi-glace was, but I happened upon it in the grocery store near the bouillion cubes.  Demi-glace is a bit pricey, but it is very worth it; the flavor it brings is wonderful; I froze the part I didn't use for next time. Thank you, Elliana!

This was excellent Elliana! I didn't measure the wine; in fact, in the morning I placed my meat into a large plastic container and poured wine over until about half the meat was covered. I also added onions, garlic, peppercorns and carrots to the mix. I let this marinate for about five hours; flipping the meat every hour or so. By the time I was ready to cook, the meat was already incredibly tender. I didn't have any demi-glaze, so I used beef base. I probably quadrupled the sauce for this recipe, which worked out well because much of it cooked down and thickened anyway. Didn't want to waste the bacon, so I added that in too. Gave the dish a nice flavor. I served this over mashed potatoes and my family truly loved it. Thanks for a great submission!

This was very good!  I had to make a few changes due to my pantry stock.  I had no demi glace, so I mixed a teaspoon worchestire sauce, a teaspoon bacon grease and a beef buillon cube.  I also seared the beef in olive oil...my personal preference.  Right before serving, after removing from the heat, I added a cup of sour cream to the mix.  Then I poured it over hot buttery egg noodles.  My family gobbled it up!  Thank you!  I will be making this again.

I sized the recipe for 16 and made it for Christmas dinner. It was fantastic for a big crowd, prep work is done early so you can enjoy time with guests, and goes very well with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Thanks for a wonderful and delicious recipe.

This was wonderful! The only thing I did different was to sear the meat in butter after dusting it with a seasoned flour mixture. Everyone who tried it said it was the best!

I used double-strength beef broth which meant I could omit the demi glaze and stew meat instead of beef round. With all the simmering, you really couldn't tell I used a cheaper cut of meat. This was SO good. I served this over buttered egg noodles--NO leftovers. We ate every bite of this. Amazing dish.

Thank you Elliana for a great recipe!  The only thing I will differntly next time is to double the sauce, as my husband and I both like a lot of sauce.  After tasting this recipe we both said it is good enough to serve to company...now that is a good recipe!

Extremely tender.  The flavor is outstanding and downright exceptional.  Additionally, the aroma while cooking is equally as good as it tastes.  We will make this in our house again and again, especially for the holidays.

Delicious! I add libbed a little however..... I put the beef cubes into the crock pot with beef broth,red wine, bay leaves, minced garlic, salt and pepper and let it cook on low all day.  Then I sauteed onions and mushrooms with butter and a slice of bacon until tender. I added the broth/wine mix with the addition of some heavy cream and brought it to a boil. With some additional salt, pepper, garlic powder and seasoned salt. I added wondra to thicken it and served it over buttery wide egg noodles. WOW. YUMMO! Next time I may braise the beef cubes before crock potting them, but they were fall apart tender!

This was absolutely wonderful. I made a couple of very small changes - I added some minced garlic with the onion, and baked in the oven at 275 for about 3.5 hours. This was a little too long, I will try a couple of hours next time. The flavor of this was so rich and delicious. Having just made Julia Child's classic - and very time consuming - Boeuf Bourguignon just a couple of weeks ago, I can say without a doubt that my whole family preferred this version.

This recipe prompted me to make the Demi Glace.. so I had homemade and it was awesome.  The sauce has a unique taste that is out of this world.. I served it over noodles.  When I finished browning the meat, I put it directly in the crock pot.. ended up being fall apart tender!  I too, added some garlic and used baby bella mushrooms.. I will make this again many times!  Very impressive!

Lovely, brimming with great flavor dish. While I didn't have all the fresh herbs for the bouquet garni, I improvised with dried parsley and thyme. The fresh rosemary from my garden bush sent the flavors over the top! I did add 4 large minced garlic cloves with the chopped onions, personal preference. Slow cooked in the crockpot for 6 hours. Served over wide egg noodles. Fantastic on this cool October's eve!

Just not enough superlatives for this one!!!! I cut up  a boneless chuck roast, used 16 oz of mushrooms and popped it all in the pressure cooker. 25 minutes later out came perfection!

I thought this was OK. Not bad but not great. I did think the wine flavor was a little over powering even after cooking for 3 hours. I don't know that I'll make this again, because I don't think that it's worth the effort but it wasn't horrible. I had a lot of leftovers that I think will probably not get eaten.

We loved the recipe.  We ate all the leftovers.  I putit it in the oven instead of doing all the cooking on the stove.   Added pearl onions and carrots.  It was fantastic.  Couldn't find demi glace but used a browning sauce its place.  Delicious!

Excellent dish; The changes I made were small. I used baby bellas for the mushrooms. Merlot replaced burgundy because we had opened a bottle of merlot the night before. Top round sirloin was on sale, so I used that for the beef. We chopped up the herbs and threw them in without botheringing to bundle them. The meat was so tender and the sauce so good. Every year we share a beach house on Cape Hatteras, and we take turns making dinner.  This will be what we make on our night to cook!

Excellent! I followed this recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything. I think the demi glace is worth getting if you can - but don't skip this recipe if you can't find it or don't want to buy it. Thanks!

This was fabulous the differences that I made were that I did not have demi glace so I used 1 tbsp of Chicken Bouquet did not add sherry wine and instead of Burgundy wine I used Merlot which I had on hand.  I will definately be making this weekly.  I thought I was back in France.

Absolutely delicious! I used beef base rather than demi glace and I didn't have fresh herbs on hand so I used a few t. of l'herb de Provance I had as well as baby bella mushrooms and finished it off in the oven for 2 hours at 325. 

I made an herb butter with the same herb blend and toasted some good hearty semolina bread to serve with this. It was divine and perfect for a chilly winter night!

Received rave reviews.  Served as Christmas Eve meal for 12.  It's amazing how far a 4 1/2 bottom round roast will go.  Meat so tender, it cut with a fork.  I added Marjoram and it gave that "WOW, what's in this" flavor. Definatley use the Sherry, it gives the sauce richness.

Excellent!  I tossed it all in the crock pot and came back 3 hrs later (on high).  I didn't use the flour and the sauce was still a nice consistency due to the tomato paste.

Very flavourful although I didn't use bacon drippings nor demi glace.  Three pounds of cubed top round set on low in the slow cooker for 3.75 hours:  Extremely tender and was probably ready after 2.5-3 hours.  I'd doubled the sauce, but it was much more than we (two) needed--even though we're very generous when ladeling on the sauce.  Delicious!!

Excellent! Made it in an hour, substituting ingredients I didn't have. Husband raved & picky teen loved it. This is how: Didn't have fresh mushroom, so soaked dried shitake mushroom in 2 cups of warm beef broth. Browned "stew cut" beef (A MUST, since it lends to fuller flavor of beef!) real good on all sides in 3 tbs butter in PRESSURE COOKER; took it out, and added twice the sherry and onion in the pot. While it was sauteeing, squeezed, then sliced the shitake. Didn't have demi glace, which is concentrated brown stock that is reduced to meaty flavored glaze, so curmbled up 2 bouillion cubes into the in the beef broth that reconstituted mushroom slices, added 6 tbs flour, 2 tbs tomato paste, then poured into the pot. When it began boiling, poured 2 cups burgendy wine, 1 tspn each dried rosemary and thyme, a bay leaf, sliced mushroom, and beef. Tightened the pressure cooker lid, and cooked for 30 minutes total, reducing the heat to LOW after the first steam. Meat was flavorful and tender, sauce was infused perfectly with dried herbs, and plentiful. Served with a box of ziti (only carb I had on hand) that was boiled in salted water, drained and butter added. Tasted just as good the next day! Keeper. Thank you Elliana!

This is a very nice dish.  The flavour is mild.  To intensify the flavour the sauce needs to be boiled down.  I added extra wine, omitted water.

Okay, so I committed culinary blasphemy; I did not have the time to devote to all of the steps in this dish, so I used a crockpot instead.  I whisked all the liquid ingredients together with the flour and poured it over the unbrowned meat and veggies.  I also used dried herbs from the jar instead of the bouquet garni.  I did omit the bacon fat, but added some chopped pre-cooked bacon.  The dish turned out great - my greatest critics (teenage children) loved it.  I will try the traditional cooking method next time just to see if it truly makes a difference.

Wonderful flavor.  I made this for a dinner party of 11, so I tripled the recipe and had lots of great leftovers. I followed another reviewers advice and made extra sauce, it was nice to have the extra gravy.

This was delicious, and my beef was sooo tender!  I made some substitutions based on what I had.  I used a little beef consume instead of the glace, and I used a little brandy instead of the sherry wine.  After browning and combining everything, I put the pot in the oven at 300 degrees for three hours.  Absolutely a great way to get amazing flavor and tenderness out of a lowly cut of beef.

This recipe is not for those with timid taste buds.  If you don't like red wine, you may not like this.  At the stage where all the ingredients were combined, I tasted it for seasoning and was dismayed at the overpowering flavor of the red wine (I bought an Australian merlot).  Made my BF taste it, who concurred that the dish was beyond hope and I thought we would end up eating out.  However, because I had invested time and money in this already, I decided to forge ahead and ended up increasing the spices, adding a bit of sugar, increasing the amount of tomato paste, and I let a slow simmer in my electric skillet do the rest.  Fortunately, that's what the recipe needed, to go the full 3 hours for the wine flavor to subside. This dish is full of rich flavor and aroma.  BF really liked it, but we both still agreed that the wine was still too predominant.  Next time (and yes I will do this again) I will cut the red wine by half the suggested amount and that should be more suitable to our tastes.

This recipe is one of the best!  My husband went on and on about how good it was.  He said it rivaled one of his favorite restaurants.  Wow!  I'd give it more stars if I could.  I did have to make a couple of changes because of the ingredients I had on hand (didn't have demi glace, for one). I served it with mashed potatoes, peas, and carrots.  The gravy was great on the potatoes!  I'll be making this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish was enjoyed greatly by my family--including young children.  The only thing I changed was a minor substitution:  Instead of cooking the mushrooms in butter, I opted for a tablespoon or two of more burgundy wine.      This dish, nonetheless, was fantastic!

This is really good, but it took about 4 hours in my cast iron pan for the meat to become fork tender.  I made exactly as written, but I think I will make two changes next time.  First, cut the meat into smaller chunks so it will cook quicker, and also reduce the amount of rosemary to 1 sprig.  I'm not a lover of it and it was the dominant flavor in the sauce.

The flavor and aroma was okay. The meat was tender but dry. I was expecting the sauce to have some clarity, not murkey in color. At that rate, I could have just used Cream of Mushroom soup and maybe a few add in's for the same look.  I made my own demi glace (Beef Stock & Cornstarch)and used dry herbs in place of fresh and omitted the Sherry. Other then that I followed the recipe. This recipe did't present as well as pictured.

I lost my family recipe for this dish so I tried this one, and I have to say I think it is much better.  I'm glad I lost the old one!  I didn't have demi glace, but the other sauce ingredients are what is used to make a demi glace, so I don't know that it was missed all that much.  I didn't cook the beef in bacon grease to reduce the fat, and I used dried herbs because that's what I had.  I also used stew meat pieces, as that's what I've always used, and they turned out very moist and tender.  I reduced the amount of meat to 1 lb. so I could have more sauce. Since it takes a few hours to cook, I made this the day before, and when I reheated it I added the mushrooms and another 3/4 c beef stock because it had thickened too much.  Served over homemade spaetzle (the only way to eat beef burgundy, in my opinion) it was heavenly!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great.  I tested it for a party using 1 serving.  I didn't even have all the right ingredients and it was wonderful.  I'm going to serve at a formal sit-down dinner for 16 this christmas.  It is very savory and fills the kitchen with wonderful aromas.

This was so good. Instead of the demi glace, the herb bouquet and the onions I just used a package of onion soup mix. It made it a lot easier (maybe not as good) but my family ate every bite. I served it with mashed potatoes with the sauce on top. The meat was very tender and the sauce is so delicious!!!!

Excellent! I made a version of tis recipe using the materials I had on hand (omitted demi glaze and used cabranet) and still it turned out very flavorful. I did add a pinch of sugar (to offset the salt factor) which seemed to work just fine. 
Thanks for such a GREAT dish with some very complex flavors!

This was ok, but nothing to fall over about.  Make sure to use good quality wine.  I thought the tomato paste was a bit overpowering.  I'll keep trying other beef burgundy recipes as well.

I rarely follow a recipe to the t.  The same was true here.  Gave 5 stars for a good foundation.  I used a cup of Pomegranate juice and 1/2 of grape juice since I didn't have wine or sherry.  Didn't use demi glace.  I used salt, pepper and garlic powder - can't imagine cooking without those.  Since everyone at my house doesn't like mushrooms I topped the dish with sauted mushrooms for my husband.  Served it on a thin slice of french bread with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Family licked the plates clean.

Yes, this made my husband my Birthday hero. He didn't save the day he just followed this recipe and made my Birthday dinner something to slurp over.

This is a great recipe.  Gave made it a couple times now.  I double everything but the meat and mushrooms so there is sauce to serve over rice.  I don't remove the meat from the skillet, I simple keep adding things in order starting when the meat is half done which works nicely.  Also I use my stainless steel single serving tea ball for the herbs instead of cheesecloth.  Wonderful meal.

We loved this! Only our version used sliced venison and olive oil (didn't have bacon or drippings). A do-over!

Rave reviews for this recipe. Huge hit with company. Doubled everything but stew meat, flour...but dredged meat before browning, onions,  and herbs. Cooked 2 hours in the oven at 325, then the 3rd hour uncovered. Found the Demi Glacé so used that. Served with egg noodles and haricot covert. Very special dinner. Same ingredients as Julia Child's Beef Bourguignon, but a bit easier to make.

I literally just finished cooking this dish I will eat it tomorrow since it is 1:20 in the morning but cooking is the only thing that calms me. I took one bite and was instantly satisfied I to suplimented the demi glaze with a little more broth and added peppercorns and a little terragon vinegar which worked out amazingly. I only cooked about a pound of meat which was more than enough and I will pile it on a rice cup which looks beautiful. 100% SATISFIED with this dish I will eat great tomorrow! Cook this you will not be disatisfied, hearty and delicious yet refined.

While the flavor was pretty good.  We have had much better.  Although, I could not find demi-glace in the market I went to so maybe that would have made a difference.  Instead I used a tablespoon of "Better than boulion".  I will probably make this again using the proper ingredients.  Also, for the record.  I did not find this too salty as other reviewers mentioned and we are pretty sensitive to salt these days since we have started reducing our sodium intake.  Thanks for the recipe.  we will keep looking for demi-glace I have cooked with it before and think it would make a difference.

I thought this was very tasty but I found the sauce a bit thick. I followed the recipe to a 'T', right down to the demi glace. The flavour was wonderful but since I only cook for myself, it was a heavy meal to have two nights in a row.

I followed this recipe minus the fresh herbs, I went by someone else's comments and did the dried herbs. It's true, you have to love red wine to enjoy this recipe. I for one, couldn't stand all the different smells going on or the taste of the sauce, but my boyfriend said it was good.
