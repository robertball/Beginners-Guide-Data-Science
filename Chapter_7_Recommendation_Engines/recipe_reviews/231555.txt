It's a rather simple yet hearty and versatile recipe. I've made it twice now in as many months, and it seems almost foolproof and forgiving if you don't measure out the ingredients correctly. Have received nothing but positive reviews from those for whom I've cooked it. Thank you for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe! I made it pretty much as it reads except I added additional garlic (5 cloves), and extra salt to the finished product.  Since the butternut squash is added on top I made a lot extra, which was great for leftovers.  And I only needed to add about half a cup of water to the dish when it was all mixed together at the end.

This is a delicious recipe. I made it with whole wheat pasta, which gave it a nutty flavor that deliciously compliments the squash.  I added much much much more squash and my guests all loved it.  I served it with a salad and garlic bread. Simple and easy.

It was great...but I will at least double the squash next time, if not more. I used spinach and cooked it a little in the butter before I added the noodles.

Good recipe overall. I veganized it by using Earth Balance butter and substituting 1/4 cashew/almond milk and 3/4 nutritional yeast as a substitute for cheese. This worked very well (especially if you like nutritional yeast and are accustomed to using it instead of cheese). 
Next time, I'm going to use probably twice the squash because it shrank up A LOT in roasting.

This is a good, filling recipe.  It's not fantastic, but good.  I used a rotini pasta since I did not have any linguini on hand and added 6 kale leaves (cleaned, chopped). Instead of 2 cloves of garlic, I used 8.  I sliced them thin on my mandolin.  I also mixed the roasted squash in when everything else was mixed up.  I will probably make this again.

Very tasty. Made with a chunkier kind of pasta but really enjoyed it. The only downside is that it took a while to prepare and bake the squash.
