This was is a difference method than I am used to doing but it worked out just fine. I did cook the onion in the skillet before adding the eggs so I would not over cook the eggs or leave the onion raw. I did use freshly cooked rice but leftover cold rice would work well too. I needed to use more soy sauce than called for. Next time I would add more finely chopped veggies too.

I used brown rice which has a higher yield than white so I used 6 eggs 1.5 cups of frozen mixed vegetables. Still not enough for my tastes so I added another cup of veg. Definitely recommend saut√©ing the onions first. I didn't and had a choice of semi-raw onions or super dry eggs. I went with the semi -raw eggs not the greatest. Might try milder onions next time. Nevertheless a great breakfast and I'll definitely do it again. I also added hot sauce coz I love the stuff??.

I was looking for an early lunch recipe for a Saturday. This worked really well. I had 1-2/3 cups of Minute Rice. I didn't have bacon so substituted half a red pepper. Like the other reviewer I cooked the onion and pepper first. I only used three eggs because I didn't have the full amount of rice. I probably added more soy sauce than the recipe called for but overall it was very good and I will make again. My husband really enjoyed it.

The Photo of this dish was professionally done and looked far more appetizing than the photo submissions from members of Allrecipes, so I looked at the photo carefully and decided I could do it my way, using all the same ingredients, my method was to cook each ingredient by it'self, not as hard as it sounds because it only takes a minute for each. Just have the oven on warm for each (I put each on a paper plate in the oven til I assembled the dish).  The only thing I did differently, was mixing 2 TBS soy with 2 TBS bacon fat and drizzled this over the "bowl" ...... kind of like a Poke Bowl, the rice needs this, yet it doesn't really soak in if the rice is a day old, if it's fresh it will soak right in, that's why it's best to cook the rice the day (or night) before.   
I added 3 crispy slices of bacon in the bowl off to the side.  I added a couple of slices of avocado to our, it was almost overkill but delicious none the less!

It was ok - not as tasty as I had hoped. The next day, I heated some in the microwave and poached an egg on top. That was good!

Probably would have been better to actually fry the rice rather than just cook it in water

This was good as written. However I made a few changes. I only used green onions and cooked the white parts with the bacon. Also I added diced carrots to the mix. I added a little granulated garlic and ground ginger too. This is a very versatile recipe. Customize to your taste or what you have available. I once diced up a can of Spam and browned in bacon fat when I didn't have bacon. It was tasty
