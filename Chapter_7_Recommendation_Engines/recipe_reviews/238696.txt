These were superb! As moist as any 'typical brownie'. I stuck by the recipe for the brownies, however...I added brown sugar to the glaze to make it caramel. By placing butter, dark brown sugar, and evaporated milk in a saucepan, I let it come to a medium boil for about 3 minutes. Then, beat it into the confectionery sugar and added the vanilla. Made it for a group of 40 and they all loved it!

Delicious.. I added the glaze to some.. not to all of them. Was good both ways. Net time I think I'll add some cinnamon

This sweet potato brownie recipe now replaces my old standby from this site.  The pecans take it to another level and it came out very moist and decadent.  Not cakey  at all.  I live at elevation (5000 ft) so I took it out after 30 minutes.  I also cut the sugar to 1 c white and 1/3 c Splenda brown sugar blend, added two tsp. of brown sugar to the butter for the glaze and melted it in the microwave until it was like a caramel sauce then added to the confectioners sugar.  It was plenty sweet enough and will cut the white sugar back to 2/3 c next time and toast the pecans.  SO GOOD!!

I highly recommend this one.  It's so moist and flavorful.  I made it and it was all gone in a day.  I'll make it again for our family reunion this weekend and I expect grand reviews even there, with my bohemian dessert making aunts...

This is super easy to make and it is delicious! We added more pecans (because we love them) and didn't use the glaze (we thought it was perfect without it). I may try more sweet potato next time...but the recipe is perfect as is!

I really liked these. I went by the recipie pretty much, except I didnt add salt. I cut the recipie in half and used an 8 inch square pan. I cooked for 40 mins. Everybody at my house really liked them, and theyre a nice change from Chocolate. I will put this recipe in my 'keep' collection.

Outstanding. I didn't do the glaze and it was perfect. That said, if you put frosting on this it would make a great sheet cake.

Really rich and tasty!  Very sweet.  My family loved them, except for the few who really don't care for sweet potatoes.

This recipe was absolutely awesome. Instead of using one cup of butter, I used one cup of real cream that was from a 100% grass fed cow. It was rich, but my family enjoyed every bite. I will be making this again perhaps for the holiday.
