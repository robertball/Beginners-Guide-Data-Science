These vegetables were absolutely outstanding! However, I think the amount of dressing is WAY off. I doubled the amount of veggies, and even added julienned carrots and a can of corn. However, I kept the dressing amount the same (minus the garlic salt but adding 2 chopped garlic cloves), with one major change: instead of a cup and a half of olive oil, I used a half of a cup. If I were to have used that much oil I would have had to throw all of the vegetables away because they would have been DROWNED in oil. I gave it four stars because of this, but the vegetables I made were very much deserving of a five, and I will make them often for parties. I only blanched my beans for a minute and they were crisp yet slightly tender.

This had a great flavor and was easy to put together. I subbed cucumber and red pepper for broccoli and cauliflower, and Spike seasoning for MSG. I also used fresh dill and garlic, and halved the dressing, which I thought was plenty. The dressing would be good on a green salad, as well. This is a very forgiving recipe--use your favorite veggies or whatever you have on hand.

Good recipe.  I used way less olive oil, just enough to coat  well.  NO MSG.  Not neededand it's really bad for you!!

The flavor was great, but it turned out TOO SALTY.  Next time I will omit the salt and maybe use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. The recipe is great for whatever fresh veggies you have around.

I make this recipe with slightly different ingredients...no green beans but sliced carrots, and a cup of black, and cup of green olives instead. It is awesome and I always get requests in the summer for this. One star removed because ITA with the reviewer that said way too much oil. I have always made it w/1/2 or 1/4 C oil. Also...although olive oil is tastier, I find that if you refrigerate this salad (and it is much better if refrigerated overnight) OO gets kind of thick and greasy. Regular salad oil works better IMN.  Overall though...delicious recipe, one of my faves.

My daughter just made this for a church potluck and it was gone in seconds! :) I barely got a taste! But what taste I DID get was delightful. I used the extra EVOO/dressing to dip my ciabatta bread in and had an extra treat!

I read all of the reviews before making this and chose to half the amount of dressing and it was perfect. I also did not use the MSG and didn't miss it. Other than that I made as written and this was a very pretty dish that work with so many things. I will definitely make this again!

Sorry, much too strong for us. We liked the flavours but I will try again with half the spices.

Made this for a family gathering and got lots of compliments. Cut down the salt to 2 tsp and added 2 minced garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. Also cut olive oil down to 1/2 c. Did not use MSG. Marinated it overnight. Adjusting the ingredients has made this a 5 star, as we are trying to eat healthier!
