This tasted great!!  I did what others suggested and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  I also sauteed the mushrooms beforehand with olive oil and garlic. I then added salt and pepper to the egg before dipping the chicken in.  Although I used italian bread crumbs, I added some other spices such as oregano and rosemary, since some people complained that it turned out too bland.  Lastly, I added the cheese (I used swiss) during the last ten minutes of baking.  Served with fettucine.  DELICIOUS!!  I will difinitly make again, and again, and again, and again......

I have made this dish several times and am always impressed with the results. However, I do some modifications: I always saute my mushrooms first. I have tried both canned and fresh... both turn out well. I also never add the cheese until the last 3-5 min. of baking time. One time, I forgot to add the cheese at the end so I made up a plate, put the sliced cheese on top and melted it in the microwave. My husband preferred the cheese this way as it was not so runny. I think from now on, I'll just melt the cheese on the chicken through the microwave. Also, with the runny sauce at the end, I thicken it up with a bit of cornstarch. This sauce/gravy is perfect on rice. This recipe has been added to the family favorites. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious!!!!!!!  I did use way more mushrooms then called for since everyone in my family loves them...I also used powdered chicken bouillon in place of the chicken broth and seasoned the chicken a bit for extra flavor.  I made about 2 cups of the bouillon (maybe more) removed the chicken from the baking pan when done and thickened it with some corn starch which made a fabulous gravy.  I also waited to the last 5 minutes or so to put the cheese on.  I served this with white rice and my family absolutely loved it...very moist and tender.  The only request from my family was more gravy next time since it was so delicious over the rice.  Next day leftovers (only 1 piece) was also delicious.  As an added note, I sauteed the mushrooms in some olive oil first.  When I made this a second time, I didn't saute them and it really didn't turn out anything like the first time.  I ended up taking the mushrooms out of the baking pan and sauteed them and then put them back in the baking pan (didn't come out as good as the 1st time, but it would have been horrible otherwise).  I finally realized I could update my review (thank goodness) because I wouldn't have given the review I originally did...

Made this last night using "baby bella" mushrooms, otherwise followed it out the window. This definately needs to be "kicked up a notch", will make again, but will saute mushrooms(large sliced ones) a little first in butter, garlic and wine then remove to the pan you are using for the oven. Then saute the breaded chicken in the same pan using a little more butter, garlic and wine. Also I think you should use a salted mozarella cheese.

Very flavorful--I sauteed garlic and half of the mushrooms in olive oil before putting in the pan and added cream of mushroom (as suggested by others) to the broth. The rest of the meal consisted of extra wide egg noodles and steamed broccoli. My whole family loved it. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

AWESOME! I took other's advice and added the cream of mushroom soup and sauteed the mushrooms in some olive oil and garlic first. I also pounded the chicken to make sure it would be done in the timeframe recommended. The chicken was extremely moist and the flavors blended so well. I also like a stronger cheese, so in addition to the mozzarella, I added some asiago slices too. I put the cheese on the top 15 minutes into the baking time and let it get brown and bubbly. Even my VERY picky 2 year old ate this. Husband says it's a keeper. Both of those make this a winner in my book...

We LOVE this at my house. I saute mushrooms and 1/2 a chopped onion in some oil, adding garlic in the end. Then I transfer to a dish and brown my chicken (just dredged in some seasoned flour). I then remove the chicken, deglaze with the broth and then add it all back in, cover and throw in the oven for 30 minutes. I top it with shredded mozzarella after taking it out, put the lid back on for a few and then mix it all together. Serve with buttered noodles. My kids love it and gobble it up. Son (6) had 3 helpings tonight!

This is DELICIOUS!!!!.. My husband and I are crazy for this and already planning on making it again very soon.. I used 3 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms plus 1 can of mushrooms.. I also mixed in some green onions and about 1 tablespoon of minced garlic into the mushrooms.. and used the whole can of chicken broth... The chicken was so good that my husband said I could pass it off as a "gourmet" meal... definitely 5 stars from us!!!

Ok so I read a good chunk of the reviews before I made it and I think the changes made it just perfect! HERE ARE MY REVISIONS: 1. Start out by pounding the chicken to about 1/3 in thickness OR slice it in strips 3. Used Italian bread crumbs and added about 1/4 cup of parmesan, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and a few sprinkles of Italian seasoning. 3. Saute the mushrooms with 1 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/2 cup choppped onion, 1/2 Tbsp. of garlic (or one minced clove), and a few splashes of worcestershire sauce. 5. Like everyone else said, make sure to add a can of cream of mushroom to it. Summary: Otherwise follow the recipe as stated. I know this seems like its a bunch of added steps, but once you get going it doesn't seem like such a burden. This was really easy and fairly quick. Also I served it over ORZO pasta. NOTE: If you want to stick with a garlic theme, I highly recommend making it with "garlic cauliflower" found on this website.

Well worth the gooey fingers you get when dredging!  This is the second time this week I've made this so I had to come rate it.  The first time I made exactly to the recipe and it was great, ate it with egg noodles.  Second time I used muenster cheese, poured the juices from the pan into the skillet I browned the chicken in, added white wine, garlic and onions and some corn starch for a thicker sauce, and it was awesome too!  Great idea for two much used staples in our house. Thanks!

Saute fresh mushrooms w/4-5 cloves minced garlic in olive oil/butter.  Pound chicken breasts thin.  Add a few shakes of salt & pepper to eggs.  Add canned parmesan cheese to bread crumbs, as well as a few shakes of oregano & basil (for more flavor).  Add some corn starch to chicken broth for a thicker consistency.  Top chicken w/mozzarella cheese 3 mins before its done. Serve with angel hair pasta (saute in olive oil minced garlic, chopped tomatoes, sliced green onions, add salt & pepper, and sprinkle freshly grated parmesan cheese.  This is awesome as a side dish!

Super good! I added a few adjustments.  It will be a recipe for company. Nothing was mushy like I thought it would be.
Add fresh garlic & little bit of Rosemary to the Mushrooms. Add Rosemary also to Italian Bread Crumbs. Add 1 can of condensed Mushroom soup to 1 cup Chicken Broth. After adding half of Mushrooms to the bottom of the pan, place browned breaded Chicken on top those and pour on the sauce. Sprinkle the other 1/2 of Mushrooms on top.  Bake that first and then 10 min. before it is finished baking, add the Cheese.  I also used a bag of shredded Italian Cheeses.

This was a good, easy and basic recipe.  I sprinkled the mushrooms with garlic powder and sprinkled the cooked chicken and mushrooms with chopped parsley for a nice presentation.  I also pounded out the chicken breats.

This is just what I' ve been looking for. However, I would never use cream of mushroom soup. Those are some of the most unappealing pics I'ver ever seen. Looks like SOS [a military term]. I would use golden mushroom soup with some white wine mixed in if I felt I just had to add something.

Please take down those disgusting pics...they are a turn off to the beauty of this dish.

This is some dang good comfort food.  I followed directions but I also added in other posters ideas and it was really good.  Good enough for company.  I used Panko for bread crumbs and added garlic salt and rosemary and oregano to the mix. 
 Cooked breaded chicken till brown on both sides, removed to a plate.  In same pan with leftover panko I put a little more olive oil and sauteed the mushrooms with galic and some white wine.

In a bowl I mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup and the chicken broth. Stirred it around and dumped in the bottom of baking pan of which I had sprayed some Pam. 
 Put Chicken on top of the soup mixture and poured the fresh  mushroom and wine mix on top of the browned chicken.  
Covered with foil and baked for 20.  Took off foil and put swiss cheese slices on top and baked another ten minurtes.  I did not serve with noodles just trying to save some calories.  I will put some green bean with it instead.

Fabulous!!!  We loved it.  Only change was I didn't add cheese till the end just to melt it!  I don't understand people who rate recipes when they almost completely change the recipe and then give it a negative rating!  (substituting flour for bread crumbs??????)  Thanks Kim.  We love it!!

This was good but not great.  Left out the mushrooms as hubby would rather die than eat one.  This is similar to chicken parmesan.

My husband said I can make this every week and he'd never grow tired of it...I did make quite a few changes after reading the reviews. 
I did follow other reviews and put in a can of cream mushroom soup (honestly it makes the recipe). Instead of chicken broth I used white wine, and it gave a very nice flavor to the sauce. I also stir fried a whole 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms with some sweet onions in olive oil,added all that including the juices to mushroom mixture. I used one egg mixed with an egg's worth of buttermilk to dip chicken breast into (keeps the coating from falling off during baking). I also added fresh garlic cloves and fresh oregano and basil from my garden. I followed the rest of the recipe as written, but put the cheese on last ten minutes of baking. The chicken was so tender and juicy, I served with white rice and roasted veggies. Update 11-29-12, made again just as recipe is directed. The sauce is very thin and needs to be thickened, so I poured it into a pot and brought to a boil, added in some flour and milk mix, about 1/4 cup and thickened it. Made a nice gravy instead of the soup.

Definitely follow what other reviewers have written-- saute the mushrooms in olive oil and garlic first(I used 4 chopped cloves-yum!), season the eggs with salt and pepper, use italian breadcrumbs, add a can of cream of mushroom soup with the broth & add the cheese the last 5 minutes or so.  The soup and broth make a perfect gravy to serve it with rice.  I also dipped the chicken in flour before dipping in eggs (it seems to help the breading stay on better).  Remember that the mushrooms will shrink so don't think you have too many. I think I needed more.  If you love mushrooms you will love this recipe.

I reserve my 5 star reviews for only the best.  This one got it!  My boyfriend said this was one of the best things I had ever made.  I used chicken tenders (about 10) and I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and about a tablespoon of minced garlic.  WOW is really all I need to say about this one!

Was pretty good.  Quick tip:  ALWAYS season your meat BEFORE you begin cooking.  Let set for at least 2 hours if possible.  That way any meat you cook with will be flavorful.  Definitely wanna use Italian bread crumbs.  I try to get the ones with Romano cheese included.  Used provolone instead of mozzarella and I sauteed my mushrooms and used two family cans of cream of mushroom with the broth.  Next time will use garlic and green onions with mushrooms.  Bought some bread to dip in sauce.  Didn't take long to make either.

DELISH.
I did not have bread crumbs so instead I finely crushed whole wheat crackers (unsalted).  I also added one can of cream of mushroom soup and because of other reviews saying theirs turned our watery, I added only 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I did a quick 5 min sautee of mushrooms with garlic and 2 tbs of olive oil.  In the same pan that I did a quick grill of the bread crumbs and egg (adding oregano and salt and pepper to the egg mix before dunking), I lifted each breast up and spooned amounts of mushroom underneath, placing the remaining (I added extra mushrooms) on top.  I then poured the cream of mush soup on and spread it out.  Baked it for 25 minutes.  I then added a layer of baby spinach and the cheese and baked it for another 15.  
It was absolutely lovely.  I would highly recommend this version- thanks KIMPAT for posting the original!!

Im giving this 4 stars because I changed the recipe, if it was written as I made it, I would have def given 5! Went over tons of reviews and made the following changes: 1) sauteed mushrooms (i used baby bellas, yum yum) in 2 cloves of minced garlic and olive oil. 2) extra seasoned my bread crumbs, I only had plain ones on hand but even if I had seasoned ones I still would have added extra spices (i use an italian season grinder you can buy in the spice aisle, one of my best kitchen tools!) 3) added can of cream of mushroom soup with 2/3 cup chicken broth. I added the cheese at the last 10min of baking, then I turned oven off and left the dish in there for another 5 min to set up/thicken. Served over white rice, it was amazing!!!

Followed some other suggestions and added a few of my own...sauted mushrooms first and added garlic and green onions.  Added a can of golden mushroom soup and specified amount of chicken broth to pan with mushrooms...heated just until the broth and soup came together.  Used panko bread crumbs and added italian seasoning and salt/pepper.  Split very thick chicken breasts in half (length wise) so they would cook quicker (plus I'm not a big fan of big thick chicken breasts).  Fried chicken in another large pan with an oven proof handle.  Poured mushroom mixture over chicken in skillet (omitted the cheese) and placed in oven (didn't want another dirty pan to wash).  Cooked up some egg noodles, put chicken on a separate plate and added noodles to the hot pan with the sauce to incorporate.  Put sauce and noodles in a beautiful pasta bowl, placed chicken on top and added fresh parsley sprigs for garnish.  Served with steamed asparagus.  Nice meal!

I also added cream of mushroom soup, marsala wine and additional spices. With these additions my wife and I thought this was great.

I make something similar to this by adding the cream of mushroom soup but I first mix it up till blended with sour cream (about a cupful).  I add the cheese at the end too. I sometimes take the chicken out, cut it up in pieces, then stir it all together and serve over long-grain white rice.  I cut the  broth in half so it is not so 'liquidy'.  I also saute my mushrooms ahead of time. I double the mushrooms cuz we all like them so much!  My grandson (3 yrs old) and I like to taste the mushrooms as they cook by using a toothpick to take them out of the skillet so as not to burn our fingers.  I don't cook them all the way tho because they finish cooking in the oven.  I do doctor-up my mushrooms by cooking in EVOO, butter, and lemon-garlic pepper first, then I brown the chicken in the same pan. My youngest son insists on this dish every year on his birthday!   Sometimes I can get away with adding either brocolli or sweet peas so it's a One-Dish-Dinner!  YUMMO!

Coming from a bachlor who cooks his own food I must say this may be the ideal way to enjoy chicken!  I recommend seasoning the bread crumbs and pan frying to a dark brown prior to baking for the best flavor.  The mild cheese goes well with any seasoning and the mushrooms don't dominate the flavor.  Afterward thicken the mushroom flavored broth with a bit of cornstarch disolved in cold water for a flavorful gravy and serve over rice or mashed potatos.  Awesome!

Excellent chicken dish alone or great with a salad. Very quick and easy to make. Cooking time was perfect at a half hour at 350 degrees.  Will be making again and again.

This has been a favorite recipe of mine for years.  I sprinkle  a packet of Good Seasons Italian Dressing for some extra flavor before I add the cheese.  I also cut the breasts into chunks and bake covered for 30 minutes and uncover for 15 to let the cheese get a little browned.  Delicious!!

I thought this was okay, but it is not something I care to make again.  To be fair, I did use a cheese blend.  Thank you anyway.

This was very good and flavorful.  I took others advice and added a can of cream of chicken soup, I think next time I would even double the chicken broth and use two cans of soup because for four chicken breasts, the recipe as made doesn't make enough gravy.

I made this dish but with a few modifications. I cooked the chicken breasts as directed, & placed them in a 9x13 Pyrex baking dish.  I found as other reviewers that I preferred the mushrooms sautéed first.  Mushrooms by themselves have little flavor, so I sautéed them first in a large fry pan. I drizzled with olive oil, garlic salt, pepper & parsley (to taste) to the mushrooms, sautéed them until tender. In a medium sauce pot I mixed 1 can GOLDEN mushroom soup (not cream of mushroom), & 1 soup can of chicken broth. Cook until bubbly, add the cooked mushrooms & mix well.  Add to the cooked chicken. Bake  as directed. The sauce was amazing. I serve it over cooked brown rice. Wonderful !!!

I made this last night.  Used the mushroom soup, added my homemade, spiced breadcrumbs and pounded the breasts fairly flat.  Sprinkled a little fresh, chopped sage on the chicken and no cheese.  The broth thickened nicely with the cream of mushroom soup and about 1 tablespoon flour.  Even the great grandchildren loved it.

This chicken was great and really fast to prepare. I added grated cheese to the bread crumbs and I seasoned the chicken before I breaded it. I added the cheese 10 minutes before it was done and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe and thanks for all the suggestions!!!

Loved it!  I mixed the panko with some flour, and also took the others' advice. I sautéed some shitake mushrooms and shallots with butter and white wine, then added garlic near the end.  Deglazed the chicken sauté pan with some organic chicken stock and added that to the bottom of the pan along with the mushrooms and shallots.  Topped the chicken with additional sautéed mushrooms and some provolone since I was out of mozzarella.  It was delicious!   - Mona

This was really good as made but the 2nd time I made it with modifications and it was even better.  I sauteed the sliced mushrooms and 1/2 large onion cut julienne style in a little butter, adding some fresh minced garlic the last 2 minutes.  Removed to a bowl and de-glazed the pan with a little white wine and sat aside. I used 6 thin sliced boneless chicken breast half's, which works so much better. Seasoned the chicken with some garlic powder, black pepper, and a hint of salt before dredging in the eggs and breadcrumbs. I browned them in a nonstick skillet and baked them for 25 minutes. Added cheese (I have used both muenster and mozzarella and both are great). Then baked another 10 minutes until the cheese melted.  I de-glazed then skillet with a little white wine.  Scraped the bits from both skillets and combined, made a roux with a little flour and butter allowing the roux to brown slightly.  Added 32 oz.'s of chicken broth with a little sprinkle of bouillon powder.  Allowed it to simmer while chicken was baking. I used two different skillets so that the mushrooms and onions can saute while I'm browning the chicken, which saves time.  When chicken was done I thickened the gravy with a little cornstarch and water and served over white rice. It is a huge hit at my house.  It only took about an hour total to prepare and cook.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! Delish. Used 3lbs of bnls chicken breast and 6c. of sliced fresh mushrooms (bec I had a ton). Sauteed shrooms and an onion before adding to dish.  Also mixed the can of mushroom soup with the chicken broth, and added some fresh chopped garlic. Finished with sprinkle of fresh rosemary, salt and pepper. Amazing. Served over whole wheat pasta with cucumber salad. Seconds were had by all!

I would've given it 5 stars but I gave it four because I felt it needed kicked up a bit more. I didn't follow any reviews, just did my own thing. I followed everything except I added salt and pepper to the egg and also water. I added salt, pepper, parsley, and red pepper flakes to the "bread crumbs" which was in my case gluten free flours. I added half a cup sour cream mixed with 1-2 tbsp cornstarch to 3/4 cup chicken broth. It took double the cooking time, perhaps because my chicken was still a bit frozen. I saw no need to saute the mushrooms at all. They were perfectly cooked. I didn't add cream of mushroom soup because of the gluten I can't have and there's always so many preservatives in that stuff. The dish could've used onion maybe, and def more mushrooms. Otherwise it was wonderful, and made a delicious gravy to put over rice. YUM

This recipe is delightful! I only had 2 chicken breasts so I cut them in half and gently pounded them to a 1/4 inch (more to go around for my family of 4). I used only one egg for coating the chicken pieces and almost a full cup of seasoned bread crumbs. Then I fried the meat in a bit of butter till lightly browned. I had a pound of mushrooms that I wanted to use up, so I sauted them in a bit of butter with salt and garlic powder (as recommended by other reviewers). I first layered the chicken, then the mushrooms, then I poured the broth into the pan, and shook the pan to evenly distribute the liquid. I then topped with 8 oz of sliced fresh mozzarella (bocconcini). I baked till the liquid was bubbly, but covered the baking dish with aluminum foil when I noticed that the cheese was starting to brown. The meat was juicy and tender and the ooey gooey cheese just brought it over the top. I garnished wish freshly chopped parsley and chives. This was a huge hit with my family. Will definitely make again.

I took suggestions of other reviews and added 1 can reduced fat cream of mushroom soup to the broth.  I cooked the mushrooms with some garlic and fresh chopped thyme before adding to the pan.  I also used cutlets instead and waited to add the mozzarella plus some grated pecorino romano about 15 minutes before I pulled the dish from the oven.   Served over orzo and unfortunately there were no leftovers.  It's a keeper!

This was really really good.  I followed the recipe as best as I could with what I had.  I don't like changing things until I've actually tried the original recipe once.  So the only thing I did differently was to use crushed cracker crumbs with some added Italian seasoning because I didn't have bread crumbs on hand.  Other than that the dish I did exactly as written.  I took out the chicken as soon as it was done and let it rest a little so it wouldn't be dry.  Very good recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

Great technique for keeping boneless, skinless breasts from getting dry. Mushrooms/broth can be reduced to a sauce after baking, too.

This was so awesome! I loved every bite, but I did take others advice, I sauted my mushrooms in olive oil and garlic, I used parmasean bread crumbs, I didn't add the cheese until about 10 minutes before it was done, and I added a can of cream of mushroom, if you don't there won't be any gravy left! but it's worth the prep!! MMMM! This is awesome over pasta or rice!

This recipe really creates some juicy chicken and the mushrooms and cheese taste great with it!  Next time I'm going to season the chicken at some point (even if it's just simple ingredients like salt and pepper), most likely once I've coated the chicken and before I sear it.  Great recipe and is easy to serve for guests.

Yummy!  I took past reviews advice and added a can of cream of mushroom soup with the chicken stock and added the cheese at the last minute.  Cooked this all over the stovetop covered and it turned out fine.

Great tasting recipe.  The next time I make this one I think I will pound my chicken breasts thin before sauteing and use a little less cheese.

As written, this recipe is somewhat bland even using smoked mozzarella (which I think is what saved it) the first time I made this.  After looking at 800 plus reviews who loved this recipe, I decided to try, try again....  Adding garlic, onion and parmesan cheese to the breading mixture gave this dish much more flavor.  Sautéing the mushrooms with more garlic and used the smoked mozzarella again made this dish closer to 5 stars.  Served with Green Bean Orzo Pasta also from AR.  Thank you Kimpat for the recipe!

Very good...the way I made it. I wish I would of followed the recipe as written, as I usually do, before I made changes. I didn't have chicken broth so I opened a pack of Ramen noodles and mixed the seasoning packet with water. I seasoned baby bella mushrooms with garlic pepper seasoning, sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil, added in cream of mushroom soup, as others suggested, and put in my 'homemade chicken stock', cooked that down. I then seasoned the chicken with basil, oregano, garlic pepper and dipped them in egg and panko breadcrumbs and brown them in butter in a separate pan. Afer preheating the oven I put the mushroom gravy in the bottom of the pan and added the browned chicken and baked for 30 mins. I didn't have mozzarella cheese so after 30 mins I cut up some smoked gouda cheese, place it on the chicken and cooked for 5 more mins. I cooked my ramen noodles (no need to waste them) and ate the chicken and gravy over them. Super yummy! It did taste like a very fancy version of baked chicken and mushroom soup, though. Which isn't what I was craving. Next time I'll try the recipe as is in hopes of getting another flavor.

I thought this was very very good! I didn't have sliced mozzarela cheese so I sprinkled some shredded on instead.  I did use a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and mixed it with the chicken broth like others suggested.  I didn't precook the mushrooms like others said. I thought the mushrooms baked nicely in the chicken broth sauce. Served over linguine with bread sticks. YUUUUM! PS: my co-workers raved about how good the leftovers looked :) Thanks!

loved this! i browned the chicken b4 hand and placed them on a bed of fresh musshrooms. i then added some sauteed spinach and onions and garlic on top of the chicken and covered w the rest of the mushrooms. prob one of the best dishes i have had in a while. i also waited until the last 5 mins or so and topped w cheese so it wouldnt get runny. oh i also forgot to dip the chicken in egg and breadcrumbs. who needs the extra carbs anyways??? lol

I made this and it didn't look like the picture at all although I followed the recipe to a tee.  I thought it should have a can of cream of mushroom, but it didn't call for one.  Now, after reading review, I see others have added a cream of mushroom which would make it look more like the picture.

Used thick-cut Boars Head brand sharp provolone instead of the mozzarella and half white/baby bella mushrooms. It's our go to meal when we need something quick and we have no idea what to make for dinner.

This is very good and I think could be made even more simple than as written.  My only changes were to add 1/2  can of cream of mushroom soup in order to produce a bit more of a sauce and a good deal of seasoning, I think it would have been rather bland otherwise.  One problem is that the cheese simply melted down into the sauce and did not distribute evenly.  I'm not convinced that the breading step really adds anything.  Next time I will simply add pounded ck. breasts to the pan and skip the breading and mix the cheese in with the sauce.  This would make this a one pan meal.  It  just might require a bit longer of a cooking time.

Reading the reviews, I made a few changes and it was delicious! I used no eggs, bread crumbs, or chicken broth. I sauted some onion, garlic, and a minced zucchini in the butter. Added the mushrooms about half way through. As they began to cook down, I added some red wine. When all cooked down, I removed the veggie mixture to a bowl. Browned the chicken in the drippings & may have added a bit more butter.  Removed and layered veggie mix, chicken, more veggie mix and topped with the sliced mozzarella cheese. I then baked this in a 12" square Corning Ware casserole dish for about 25 minutes. I served this over arborio rice.  Excellent also as leftovers with the rice mixed in with the veggie sauce. Yum!

The recipe seemed to need additional seasoning and taste, so I sautéed the mushrooms together with garlic and onion for added flavor.  After the chicken was done, there was a little bit of mushroom/chicken broth sauce in the pan, but I felt like more liquid would have been better.  I spooned what liquid I had over pasta and it was delicious.

I agree with the last reviewer.  I made this exactly as written, thought it was OK, but just didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Lots of liquid cooked out of the mushrooms, so what I ended up with was a bunch of mushrooms sitting in a brownish puddle.  If I had time, I probably would have tried to season and thicken the liquid into a sauce, but the rest of the meal was ready to go on the table.  I have to wonder if sauteing the mushrooms at the outset would have helped a bit.  First, they would have looked more appealing, and second, they would have released some of their liquid before heading into the oven.  This wasn't bad, but there are lots of chicken recipes out there that I like better.

Super yummy, Super easy! Like other posters, I sauteed my mushrooms with garlic and onion. I also added a touch of basil. The chicken comes out really really moist with lots of flavor. I left off the cheese until the last 5 minutes and it was perfectly gooey and not hard at all! Served over brown rice. I will definitely be making this one again!

Very nice recipe, but you must saute the mushrooms first with a combo of something like onion, garlic, and tarragon...I didn't add cream of mushroom soup like others suggested, but it's lovely without...

I have been making this recipes for years, long before I found it on this site. The chicken turns out incrediby juicy and tender. The only thing I do different is dip the chicken in flour (seasoned with garlic powder, paprika and pepper) then dip into the egg, then dip it into the SEASONED bread crumbs. I always season the bread crumbs myself with thyme, savory and a little bit of parmesean cheese. If you think this recipe is a little bland, try the changes I suggested above instead of adding processed, high sodium canned soup.

With a few additions, this recipe is 5 star.  1) I added thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, and oregano to the bread crumbs.  2) Saute the mushrooms with two cloves chopped garlic in some olive oil before adding 3) Made my own sauce mixture instead of plain broth - melt 1 Tbs. butter in skillet.  Stir in 3 Tbs. flour until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup white wine.  Simmer and stir until thickened.  4) 5 minutes before it was done I added mozzarella cheese.  I purposely sprinkled some of the cheese in the sauce.  When I took the pan out of the oven I stirred the sauce and the cheese blended right in.  5) Served over angel hair

this was GREAT! Lots of flavor... I added a white wine sauce over the top and it was magnificent. I added salt and pepper to the chicken before I dipped in into the egg bath and added onion powder to the bread crumbs.... Two thumbs up!

This is excellent! Thank you for the enjoyable tastebud explosion Kimpat! I did make modifications suggested:  adding a can of cream of mushroom soup to a mixture of water and white cooking wine (instead of chicken broth, which I didn't have), I sauteed the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil and added the mozzarella cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Chicken was perfectly cooked at 35 minutes and it was tender and juicy and flavorful! Thank you!!

I've been using KIMPAT's recipe for a few years now- it's a favorite of mine! I use 4 cups of mushrooms, a can of cream of chicken soup mixed in with the broth, a splash of sherry and shredded mozzarella cheese added about 5 minutes before I take the whole thing out of the oven. It's great over egg noodles.

This recipe was delish!!!  I made it for my family tonight and it was a definite hit!!  I followed the advice of others and sauteed half of the fresh mushrooms in olive oil and crushed garlic, tenderized the chicken breasts (pounded them to flatten alittle) and added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup to the broth.  I used mozzarella cheese and a sprinkled the whole thing with a little grated parmesan.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  I served it over extra wide egg noodles with steamed carrots and broccoli.  I will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing it!!

I've been an Allrecipes member since 2000, before you could even rate or review recipes. I made this recipe way back then, and even though we all love chicken and mushrooms, no one liked this dish. I would have given it a "1" rating if I could have. It was just too bland and since there is no thickening mentioned for the broth, it was quite strange looking... the chicken and mushrooms kind of floated around in the broth...  Well anyway, I was browsing recipes yesterday afternoon and came across this one again.... and WOW what a difference a can of soup can make!! I followed the advice of several reviewers (add spices, saute mushrooms and add soup to the broth) and this chicken turned out fantastic! That's why I love these reviews... thanks to everyone for a dish I know I'll serve often to my family!

I followed others advice. Sauted mushrooms in olive oil & garlic. Added white wine, chicken broth and mushroom soup. One thing I would change is I would not add parmessan cheese to my breadcrumbs. It burned when I browned my chicken. We loved it.

It was definitely easy, but found it a bit on the plain side. Nothing fancy but easy meal that tasted pretty good. We probably wouldn't make it again though compared to other chicken recipes.

WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!!! I have to say that this is by far one of the best ways to prepare chicken. I did saute the mushrooms in some olive oil first and also added a can of cream of mushroom soup along with the broth. It was heaven. 
I placed fresh mozerella on the last 10 minutes and served over a bed of linguini. We will be eating this again very soon.

This recipe was excellent!  Similar to other reviewers, I cooked my mushrooms first and used a little cornstarch at the end - will make this again soon!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The ratings are usually pretty accurate. I'm surprised this one had 5 stars. It sounded good but was actually quite bland. The mozarella cheese on top seemed very dry. I have made a similar recipe using Amercian cheese layered with the chicken, which melts nicely and combines with the broth to create a tastly little sauce.

This was delicious!  I added an extra cup of mushrooms and 3/4 cup white wine ans served on a bed of fettucine with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  I am a big fan of mushrooms and they tasted so good in this light sauce.  My baby ate the checken breast cut up into small pieces and it was very moist.  I hightly recommend this recipe and will serve it when I have company.

I was not thrilled with this dish - my husband liked it much better than I.  Didn't like it over white rice - thought it was very bland overall.  The chicken would be better served alone with a veggie or buttered noodles on the side.  Was easy and quick, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I have been making this recipe for years now-I also do a slight variation sometimes, adding a tbsp lemon and when browning the chicken, I add a tbsp of capers, and crush them with the back side of my fork-then pouring the whole sauce pan of scrapings and capers over the chicken in the roasting pan. Adds a nice tangy flavor. Capers are one of the most under utilized

We've been making this recipe for 20 years.  We call it Aaron's Chicken ( my son's favorite dish) The only difference is that we have always used swiss cheese.  It's even better the next day.  We fight over leftovers.

Thank you KIMPAT for this lovely recipe.  My family said it was one of the best dinners I've served.  I made some changes according to what I had on hand, other reviews and just some on my own.  Basically the same recipe though.

I used italian breadcrumbs, sautéed the mushrooms and added finely chopped onion and garlic and a splash of red wine before baking.  I used portabella mushrooms and thick steak cut mushrooms (pre-cut, had on hand) .  I set the chicken on top of the the thick steak cut mushrooms because it didn't make sense to set the chicken in broth after crisping.  I used provolone because that is what I had.  

Delicious!  This is special and worthy of a meal to serve special guests or a special day.  Thanks!

Tasty! The only deviations I made were, adding some poultry seasoning to the chicken and sauteing the mushrooms as some reviewers mentioned. I did thought the gravy was just delicious with the broth (did not see the need to add cream of mushroom). Thanks for the basic recipe, I'll be making it again.

this was delicious! I changed it up a bit too. i sauteed three packages of sliced mushrooms in butter and garlic powder. I put down one layer of mushrooms in the baking dish then added my chicken breasts .Then I poured a sauce of cream of chicken  soup and 1 cup chicken broth over the chicken. I pored the remaining mushrooms overtop and baked for 30 minutes.ended with grated mozzarella on top under the broiler. yummy

A little bland in flavor. Could be improved with sautéing mushrooms first, using white wine instead of chicken broth and chicken thighs instead of breasts., and using a little more seasoning on the chicken other than the seasoned bread crumbs.

A great Versatile Basis recipe. What I mean by that is the recipe is good on its own but can be amazing with customization. My recipe used double the mushrooms (1/3 white button, 2/3 baby bellas) sauteed in EVOO. Removed the mushrooms from pan (but not the juices). Cut my chicken into smaller pieces and fried them in EVOO (egg dipped & breaded in Italian Breadcrumbs). I used 1 cup of broth and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. It was wonderful! I added cheese near the end but I dont think the cheese was needed or noticed much so I wouldnt add it again. Hubby can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

Both my husband and I loved this dish.  The only change I made was to use 4 cups of mushrooms instead of 3, and there was no need to saute them first.  It seems strange to just put them in the bottom of the pan raw, but it works. They cook up beautifully in the sauce.
Oh, one more thing:  one cup of bread crumbs is way too much.  I ended up with half the bread crumbs left and sprinkled some on top of the cheese before baking.

Very Tasty! I've made it more than once and it's been a crowd pleaser everytime! I didn't put the cheese in early enough, so it wasn't brown by the time it was done, but now I know that for next time!

Overall, very good and easy recipe!  After trying it once here are two recommendations I would try next time: use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken broth-it was too runny.  Also, try a stronger type of cheese, the mozzerella was a little too mild.

Very good, everyone including the kids asked for it again.  I used crushed soda crackers instead of bread cumbs and added a little hy's (or Lawrys) seasoning salt and a tiny bit of garlic powder.

I loved this recipe.   It was fast and easy and had my hubby licking his fingers.  I did make a few changes.  I sauteed the mushrooms first with garlic and basil, (over butter).  I also tenderized the chicken.  And instead of chicken broth I used cream of mushroom soup and white wine.  I also used Parmesan cheese and put it on about 5 minutes before I took the chicken out of the oven.  Served over orzo. Can't wait to make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly and was underwhelmed to say the least.  I felt this was a waste of good (and expensive) mushrooms and cheese.  I can't say what it was specifically that made it unappetizing.

This was absolutely fabulous!  Like others, I sauteed the mushrooms in butter and garlic as well as used the cream of mushroom soup mixed with chicken broth.  It had a nice gravy texture to it rather than being watery as I think the broth alone would yield.  I love mushrooms so it could definitely use more than the recipe calls for.  I will definitely be serving this again soon as requested by my hubby!

Not sure how this recipe got 5 stars. Made the way it is, it is very boring. The chicken is very tender however.

Super easy to put together. Next time I will try with swiss or a different type of cheese to give it a kick. We also only use Panko bread crumbs in our house, and it added a really nice flaky texture to it.

A great entry level dish. Like everyone else, I sauteed the mushrooms in garlic w/seasonings and added cream of mushroom soup. The recipe definitely needs to be supplemented with the extras to give it flavor.

I have made this recipe many times and it is remarkably good.  I always sauté the mushrooms and onions.  I love to use Vidalia onions when available.  Per other reviewers I use extra broth and mix in some cream of mushroom soup.  I season everything well with salt and pepper and garlic and onion powder and maybe a little Ms Dash.  This dish needs some seasoning so that it will not be bland in my opinion.  I also like to use panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  I then put the onion mushroom mix on top of the chicken, then the soup mixture on top of that, and finally the mozzarella. I usually serve this chicken over rice.  It is sooooo Yummy.  A great part of our regular meal rotation.  Try it you will love it

This was really good, but not outstanding. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I did saute the mushrooms with some minced garlic and sprinkled marinated artichoke hearts on top of the chicken before topping it with the cheese. I also mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup with the chicken broth, as others suggested. It was delicious, although I think I'll cut the chicken broth by 1/2 next time so  the sauce will be a little thicker.

Delicious!!!!  I followed suggestions of others and this recipe got rave reviews from my family.  I sauteed the mushrooms in a teeny bit of olive oil with some fresh minced garlic and a splash of white wine (don't overdo them!).  I used swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella and am really glad I did because it gave the dish a more interesting flavor. I  mixed the chicken broth with a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup.  Including the soup makes for a nice gravy that goes well with rice or pasta on the side.  Next time I'm going to try skipping the egg bath/bread crumb dip before browning the chicken just to make the dish a bit lighter.  This is definitely a keeper.

Very nice.  I added cream of mushroom soup, as recommended by other reviewers, and also sauted the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil.  I think it may have been very bland otherwise, but this way it was very good.

I think this turned out very tasty with the changes I made.  I followed other reviews and sauted the 'shrooms in some EVOO with a little garlic.  I added some Parm and rosemary to the breadcrumbs.  I added some cream of Mushroom to the sauce and about a half cup of white wine.  I used an italian blend of cheeses, that I sprinkled on the last 10 min of cooking.  Oh and I used tenders because that is what I took out of the freezer.  Very good with these changes, over a five.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome.  Love fresh mushrooms so I sauteed them first and used a whole pound!  I put all of the mushrooms on bottom.  Used a whole can of broth (14oz) and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Both my husband and I have "healthy appetites" and we each only ate one, very filling.  Was afraid breading would be soggy as leftovers but it wasn't.  Always looking for new ways to prepare chicken breast.  Absolutely wonderful!!

I used 3 (4oz) cans of mushrooms because it was what I had on hand. Added cream of mushroom (as suggested by others) to the broth. Topped it with the mozzarella cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking rather than at the beginning. I like to see the melted cheese. Served it over rice.  My sister and brother-in-law loved it.  My brother-in-law even had seconds. Next time I will make more sauce ... it's great over rice!

This recipe was really good!  I used 8 chicken breasts and the same amount of the rest of the ingredients and it turned out fine.  I would recommend waiting about 15 minutes before putting the cheese on since the cheese came out a little well done, but overall it was an excellent recipe!

I made this recipe as stated except for one thing.  I used Harvarti cheese, only because that is all I had on hand. Other reviewers have stated that they thought the recipe was bland, but with a stronger cheese than mozzarella it is actually quite good and adds flavor.  We really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again, but I also think I will stick with the Harvarti cheese (or some other stronger flavored cheese).  It makes the recipe a little richer.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband really loved this one.  I found it a tad bland.  I used provolone cheese instead mozzerella.  I think next time, and there will be a next time...I will use more mushrooms, less chicken broth and more cheese...thanks so much for the recipe.

This has become one of my husband's favorite recipes.  I've made it several times now and I have one son that likes it and the other will eat it but it's not his favorite (oh well can't please them all...LOL).  I modify it just because I like additional seasonings.  I add onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parm cheese to my bread crumbs and sometimes even use  different flavored breadcrumbs other than the italian ones.  The chicken is super moist and has a wonderful flavor.  It's a delicious dish and I highly recommend it!!! :)

This dish is one of my favorites and also my husband's. I followed all directions only adding a few moderations. I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh since I didn't have any fresh on hand & I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of the slices since reading previous reviews of the sliced mozzarella being runny. When I sautéed the mushrooms I also sautéed some onions & extra minced garlic with it. The last 5 mins or so is when I sprinkled the mozzarella cheese on & I also sprinkled a mixture of grated Parmesan cheese & Asiago cheese! It came out so good. I did mildly season the chicken with desired seasoning prior to dipping it in egg & bread crumb. The only thing I will change the next time I make this dish is to double the chicken broth & use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of 1 since I served it with white rice & used the juices for gravy which wasn't enough only using one can. I didn't have to use starch to thicken the juices either for gravy. It was a good consistency using the broth & soup together. I love this dish.

A very simple and quick recipe. I will probably make this again but next time I'll take the advice of one of the reviews that suggested you pound the chicken first......the centre was a bit flavorless because the meat was so thick. Also, next time I'll leave out the soup that many suggested you add with the broth and keep the original recipe. I feel the taste of the soup was a bit overpowering.

Married 54 years next month, and last night we agreed this was the BEST chicken dish ever.  Made it exactly like the recipe called for. Next time, just for fun, I will add a few canned artichoke hearts along with the fresh mushroom that I sauteed in a little butter and avocado oil.  Served with fresh peas on the side.  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow evening.  Thank you, KIMPAT.

I love using recipes as a place to start. And this was a great place to start. I did make a couple of changes that we really liked.
-Sauteed mushrooms
-Added broccoli and onions to the mushrooms
-I used the broth afterwards to make a gravy.

I season the chicken breasts a little more adding garlic powder and use shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Sprinkle about a half cup of white wine over everything and bake. The wine makes a nice sauce when the dish is plated.
I also spread the mushrooms over the chicken then the cheese followed with the wine.

Nice recipe.
I used fresh mushrooms, garlic and onions and sauteed them before adding to pan in olive oil.
Does not need any more salt - see nutrition on bottom. (used low sodium broth).  I would, if adding anything a little half and half and some flour to thicken it, if necessary.
Steamed asparagus, green beans or cauliflower goes well with it. Also brown rice, but since we try to reduce carbs at dinner, we only add veggies. Thanks for this great recipe.

Tasted great! I made this for the first time for my family and was a big hit. I made this with a bit more cheese as my family loves cheese. Next time saute the mushrooms first and add a bit more garlic to the bread crumbs. Will certainly make this again.

Quite tasty! I used half white mushrooms & half baby bellas. Sautéed them with a bit of onion & garlic and added a splash of white wine before layering with the chicken. And I thickened the sauce afterward with some corn starch. Not certain I'll make it again as I have a similar recipe that's all done in one skillet, but it was good enough that even leftovers were gobbled up quickly.

This is a delicious recipe, but even better with modifications. My family really liked it the first time I made it, and absolutely loved it the second time around with the changes I made. 

I used a large box of mushrooms because we all love them, and sautéed them, along with half a chopped onion, in white wine, olive oil and garlic.

I browned the chicken in olive oil, garlic and white wine, but had a hard time getting the breading to stay on the chicken, so I may skip that part altogether next time and also save some calories. To lighten it up even more, I also skipped the cheese. I really don't think the dish needs either. 

Instead of broth, I used a chicken bouillon cube dissolved in 3/4 cup of water and mixed in 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, as others suggested. 

I also seasoned the dish with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley and basil, and served it over rice with the sauce from the pan as a gravy. I will be making this often!

I am not exactly sure why the breading was added to the chicken except to increase calories.  It turns into a gooey mess!!  So half way throught the recipe I added the cream of mushroom others suggested only to turn out with a cheapened tetrazzini.  I have never deleted a recipe but this one is out for sure.

This is a GREAT base, as others have said.  I prepared it mostly as written, but added the can of mushroom soup and some white wine, seasoned salt, and black pepper to the chicken stock.  I also included an obscene amount of sliced mushrooms, some sliced onions, and a thick layer of spinach.  Didn't cook the veggies at all beforehand, and they came out just perfect.  Easy, moist, and delicious.  We will eat this many more times in the future.

Agree with others, somewhat bland and what the heck are you supposed to do with all of that liquid in the bottom?  If I make again, I would saute the mushrooms with some onions and skip the broth all together.

this dish was AMAZING! I followed others advice and added garlic and cream of mushroom soup to the sauteed mushrooms. I also used Swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella, the nuttiness goes so well with the earthiness of the mushrooms! Served over egg noodles. It's a keeper!

Inspiration of this dish was great! I made a healthier version of this dish and loved it. I sauteed the baby bellas with garlic and a touch of cayenne pepper for some heat. I wilted down fresh spinach at the end then added a can low fat cream of celery soup and half cup 1% milk to form a sauce. I pan seared my chicken in a little olive oil, salt and pepper. I made lentils to serve this over and added a little parm cheese at the end. I never did bake this just served directly from the pans. Much healthier version and delish!

Chicken broth is not gravy.  Found this to be pretty unremarkable recipe for chicken but perhaps I didn't make it right because everyone else seems to love it.  I had also added slices of ham between the chicken and cheese because I anticipated the flavor profile to be pretty blah.  BUT ... I drained off the chicken broth after cooking and saved the rest.  Made panini sandwiches on focaccia bread and it was a huge hit.  So, 2 stars for dinner but 5 for lunch! :)

This is soooo delicious! I made a few changes, of course, out of neccessity. I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I made my own breadcrumbs. I used one chicken bullion cube instead of the stock (or was it broth) called for, because I had none at home. I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic before adding them to the pan. I added cream of broccoli to the broth. It was sooooo creamy, the chicken was so moist. My husband said it was 'excellent'. My 5 year old daughter said it is the best chicken I've made. Thats saying a lot because she doesn't really like this type of food.  I served this with mashed potatoes from this site (traditional mashed potatoes).

I have made this twice now. I follow the recipe exactly. The only troubles I have is not enough butter in the pan to brown the chicken. I usually have to add a little more before all the chicken is browned. I love this recipe and so do the people I have made it for.

I'd give this about 4 1/2 stars if I could, but I chose 5 stars to encourage people to make it. It's not perfect, but it's certainly very delicious! 

My only complaint: the breading didn't stay on the chicken; it came off in little piles of mush. I don't know if that can be helped. I think I'll just skip the egg and bread crumbs next time - it didn't need it. Also,  added fresh, sliced red peppers to the top of mine and used Swiss cheese instead of Mozzarella. Delish!

Quick and tasty!  I added garlic to the skillet and cheated by using presliced baby bella mushrooms.  Also increased the amount of mushrooms because we love them!

Absolutely fantastic recipe. If you do not like mushrooms you should not attempt this because the mushrooms are an essential part of the wonderfulness. Just amazing, and hard to believe it was so easy.

My husband and toddler devoured this.  Only changes that I made were more mushrooms, and chicken thighs, as no breasts on hand.  Definitely will be making again.

Very good! As others suggested, I sauteed minced garlic in olive oil until aromatic then I added canned Portabello mushrooms (without juice) and sauteed about 5 mins. Meanwhile I added salt and pepper to an egg in a bowl and dipped the chicken. I only had plain bread crumbs but added garlic salt, basil and other Italian seasonings. I dredged the chicken in the bread crumbs. I melted butter ima skilled and browned the chicken on both sides. I added cream of mushroom soup to the broth to make a sauce. I put chicken in a 9x13 pan added half of the mushrooms and half of the soup. Bake at 350 for 20 mins, add the rest of the soup and mushrooms. During last 5 mins I added white American cheese. A definite keeper!

This dish is slightly bland but you can easily add your own jazz for your personal taste.  I added a chopped onion, and clove of garlic.  I did sauté them as well as the mushrooms before adding it to the dish because I thought there would be too much moisture from the mushrooms.   The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The next time I may try a little rosemary.

This dish is absolutely delicious! I added a can of mushroom soup, as some reviewers suggested and it sure made the dish! I mixed the chicken broth into the soup and also put the cheese on for the last 15 minutes. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use only 1 egg instead of 2, as teh 2nd egg went to waste. Definitely a "make again" recipe!

This was exceptional! Made this with gluten free bread crumbs and added 1 can of gluten free cream of mushroom and a tad of corn starch. Everything else was the same and delicious! Oh I even forgot to add the cheese at the end and it was still amazing!

Great recipe - lots of opportunity to customize.  I love mushrooms, so I basically doubled the amount called for. It helps to either cut the chicken breasts in half or use chicken tenderloins.

This was delicious! I only had Panko bread crumbs (which can be very bland) so I seasoned them with seasoning salt, white pepper, oregano and this garlic and onion marinade spice. I sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic in olive oil before adding them to the pan and added a can of cream of mushroom like other reviewers suggested. Served it with a veggie rice side dish. Delicious! I'm making a wrap with it today for lunch! Thanks for the quick, easy and delicious recipe!

I made this recipe four times since discovering it on this site.  Each time I sautee the mushrooms first in some garlic butter and a little bit of cooking wine.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Aside from that I made no changes.   Everything about this recipe was great!  And when served with the "Twice Baked Potatoes" recipe from this site, we had a meal that was hard not to love!  I've never made this recipe "as is" so I'll rate it based on my variation, which wasn't too big a change...

This was extremely easy and very, very tasty, although I did follow some of the advice from previous reviewers. I DIDN'T bread the chicken - I browned it in melted garlic butter seasoned with Herbs de Provence and salt & pepper. I also sauted the mushrooms in garlic butter & pepper and I did add the can of mushroom soup to the chicken broth. As to the cheese, I used a mixture of GRATED mozzarella and asiago but I sprinkled it on the chicken during the last 10 minutes of cooking. I served with plain rice smothered with the sauce from the chicken dish. YUMMY!!!!!

Very juicy :) I used kellogg's crumbs and added lemon pepper, garlic salt and basil. Use vegetable broth. I didn't have any mozzarella cheese. I did use pre sliced mushrooms. I would make this often.

I have never, ever written a review for a recipe in my entire life, though I have used many recipes off of this site and more.  This recipe compelled me to write one for the first time ever.  It was so much better than I anticipated!  I loved the idea of using a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with the broth so I did that.  Also, I sauteed the mushrooms first with some garlic as indicated by another review.  I did add baby spinach in with the sautee of mushrooms and garlic and found that to be an added extra taste that I personally love.  Oh, yes, I did use panko bread crumbs instead of italian because that's what I had on hand.  This dish tasted like something served to you in a high-end restaurant.  Please try it!  I couldn't give it more than 5 stars or I would have.

It was delicious!  I thought it might be very rich and heavy being that it's breaded and covered with cream of mushroom soup AND covered with cheese, but it was a wonderful balance of flavors.  I wouldn't change a thing accept to add more mushrooms but that's just because I love mushrooms :-)

Great recipe! I did what others suggested. Only I used large portabella mushroom heads  that I sliced and sauteed with a few cloves of garlic, fresh chopped Rosemary, and finely minced onions in olive oil but just lightly. I mixed one can of creme of mushroom soup and chicken broth in a long glass cooking dish. When I beat the egg I added pepper and salt. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I lined the bottom of the cooking dished with the mushrooms and put the chicken on top then another layer of mushrooms and sautee mixture and topped with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese! Very yummy!

Delicious and Delectable, this recipe deserve the highest ratings. I was so tired of eating the same old dishes and decided to try this one. My son who hates mushrooms was very critical just from the name of the dish, but he ate every drop from his plate...even the mushrooms. I followed the reviews and  sauteed my mushrooms in olive oil and garlic. I used italian breadcrumbs and skinless boneless chicken thighs that had been marinated in garlic and butter. I also mixed the chicken broth and cream of mushroom soup together and poured it over the chicken thighs in the baking dish then topped with more sauteed mushrooms. About five minutes before I took it out of the oven I laid the mozzarella slices on top of the chicken until it was bubbly. I also made wild rice and sauteed spinach with garlic. Talk about delicious. It was great and my family loved it!

It was alright but lacked any zip.  It really needs added salt and herbs to make it interesting.  The mushrooms and cheese gave it a slight "sour" taste and smell that put me off.

This is a very good basic recipe, but would probably be a little lacking in flavor if made as is.  I browned the chicken in olive oil and garlic instead of butter, and reduced what was left in the frying pan with broth and white wine before pouring it over the chicken and mushrooms in the baking dish.  The chicken was very moist and the sauce at the bottom of the dish was fantastic.  I will definitely make this dish again.  The cheese didn't seem to add much to the flavor, and I may omit it next time.

As suggested by others, I added one can of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic.  I also sautéed some chopped onion, and then added the mushrooms.  I think the onions were a nice balance between the mushrooms and chicken.  Easy and delicious !  Oh, and if it is bland (as others have said), make sure you season it VERY well.  It needed a lot of salt !

Fantastic recipe.  Took the advice of some of the reviewers and made the following changes: * Doubled the amount of mushrooms used * Sauteed mushrooms in garlic and olive oil before using them * Used 12 oz. and put on 5 min before chicken was finished in oven * After chicken was removed from oven, added corn starch to thicken leftover sauce in tray  Possible changes for next time: * use more broth to create more sauce (once thickened) * use 16oz of mozzarella

LOVED IT!!  This was spectacular, the only thing is I feel like I didn't have enough sauce. I added cream of mushroom to the chix broth, sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil before hand with some garlic(I think next time I will add some more mushrooms), added salt and pepper to the egg mix, added rosemary and oregano to the bread crumb mix and added the cheese the last 10 minutes and put it all over fettucine noodles. Fabulous!!  A keeper!!

This was excellent.  I took previous raters advice and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  Also added Italian Seasoning, salt and pepper to the egg mixture.  Don't forget to add some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs also.  Don't add the mozzarella til the last 5 minutes of baking.  With all those tips, this is sure to be a hit!

I have been using this recipe for over a year now and it's a favorite with everyone. I do add chopped garlic to the mushrooms on the bottom and I add mushrooms to the top as well. When I buy chicken tenders I bread them, fry them and freeze them. Then when making this recipe it's extremely easy to just pop them into this recipe. Quick, Easy and delicious!

Mabye I just didn't make this right but it did not turn out like I was thinking at all. It was watery, the chicken was dry, and the flavors just didn't mesh well. I will not make this again.

Really good with a few changes(as suggested by other reviewers). You need to sautee the mushrooms first (I used olive oil & garlic). Replaced the water with chicken broth and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. I added oregano, cracked pepper & rosemary to the bread crumbs.

This is AWESOME!  We call this "restaurant chicken" as it tastes just like it came out of an Italian Restaurant, twice as good the next day and leftovers will be devoured.  I use low sodium chicken broth and it is soooooooooo delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

I really thought this was very tasty chicken.  Although, I did fry up my mushrooms with onion and garlic before putting them in the oven.  Also, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken broth.  The Chicken was tender and there was enough of the sauce to use as gravy over potatoes.   I'm not a good cook at all, but this really turned out well for me.

If I hadn't made the recommended changes (sauteeing the mushrooms in butter, and adding a bunch of seasonings to the bread crumbs), I would have been very disappointed with this recipe.  With the changes it was OK, but not spectacular.

I really and truly wanted to LOVE this recipe, after reading all the wonderful comments about it.  I tried it with all the suggested changes, i.e.,sauteing the mushrooms with onion and garlic beforehand; adding seasoning to the chicken; adding the cheese the last 5-10 minutes; and adding a can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup to the chicken broth. The result was it was just okay.  I definitely would not go out of my way to prepare this again.  Sorry.

Very tasty!  Different way to cook chicken... I get so bored with traditional chicken recipes.  May try with a little white wine next time, too.  Only comment from the Peanut Gallery was that there wasn't enough sauce to go with the egg noodles.

I was not impressed by this recipe.  I did add the cream of mushroom soup like others suggested, but the sauce was still kind of runny and it didn't have much flavor.  It was just ok, I probably won't make it again.

I followed some of the other reviewers' advice, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and also waited until the last few minutes to put on the cheese.  It turned out great!!

This recipe was okay, but it was quite bland.  I won't be adding this to my recipe box. My advice:  stick with the Chicken Marsala recipe also found on this website.

This was awful - tasteless & terrible.. I even tried adding fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of white wine, salt, pepper.. nothing helped.  Will not make again - not sure how so many people were off on this one..

Great Recipe.  I did add the can of 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of Marsala wine, and about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic with the chicken broth.  Can wait to make it again.

Very good recipe & easy to make. I tried crimini mushrooms with this and used more than called for. I served it with rice as suggested, but I wasn't impressed. Next time, I'll try it with egg noodles & add something to thicken the broth. I think it'll be better with a more gravy-like consistency.

This really was delicious. Next time I would double the mushrooms (I used cremini, shiitake and portobellos), because they really shrink down and we love mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again!

My family did not enjoy this recipe. The sauce was too rich and salty, with too many overpowering flavors. Leaving out either the onion soup mix or the mushroom soup may improve the results.

This was a hit with the entire family and I will definitely make this again.  I doubled the amount of mushrooms, used a whole can of chicken broth, and used italian breadcrumbs with romano cheese.  Next time, I think I'll try serving the chicken with a side of noodles and marinara instead of serving the chicken over the noodles.

Tender, juicy chicken; a very tasty chicken dish.  We love mushrooms so we liked this dish a lot! Note: 1 egg was more than sufficient for coating the chicken.  I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so I used plain bread crumbs spiced with Italian seasoning (I used more than 1 cup, however). Also, I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of sliced. I served this dish with Spaghetti Squash (got that recipe from this web site) and Italian Green Beans; they complement each other very well.

All the praise left for this recipe is greatly deserved.  This dish became a part of the meal rotation after the first time we made it.  The taste is much bigger than the sum of the ingredients.  Can't wait to make it for company!

Very nice recipe as written. The only changes I suggest is add extra mushrooms and broth as the sauce is delicious. I would also add the cheese later in the cooking process as it charred a bit. I also seasoned the egg mixture with some salt and pepper.

What is the point of writing a review for THIS recipe when you make so many changes and additions that it becomes a completely different recipe. Write your own recipe with your ingredients and call it something else. I no longer read reviews because they generally deviate so far from the original recipe. I make the recipe as written and enjoy it just fine.

I usually like to make a recipe the first time exactly as directed and this one was no different.  I now know why most of the reviews of this recipe include changes or additions. As written, it couldn't be any more bland.  The breading fell off of the chicken in the skillet and what didn't fall off just became soggy in the baking pan.  So basically you have plain baked chicken in chicken broth with a mushrooms and cheese and no added seasonings or spices.  Blech!  There are so many really good baked chicken recipes out there  that I can't be bothered going through all the reviews on this one to see what needs to happen to it to make it repeatable.  It just isn't.

I made this exactly to the instructions.  There was something that was missing for me.  It has a lot of potential, though.  It needs a thicker sauce so next time I would add cornstarch.  I think it would also be much more tasty if the the entire dish was done on the stovetop.  I will sauté the mushrooms, add sliced onions, and Marsala wine for the sauce.

I didn't give  5 stars because of my modifications.   First, I add parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  Yum!  Then, as many others have done, I mix a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  This makes it so much better.   Also,  saute the mushrooms in evoo with some garlic for amped up flavor.  This basic recipe is a good start, but is much better with some changes.

This is a great recipe!! I used bonelss chicken tenders instead of  chicken breast halves. Also, I add an envelope of onion soup mix to the bread crumbs to kick it up. I end up making more than the recipe calls for and divide between 2 8x8 pans. I give one to my son. His family loves it. Drain the liquid after baking to prevent sogginess.

I think, as many have indicated, this recipe is an excellent place to start. Having made it first, exactly as written, I found it to be very bland. Nevertheless, by simply adding salt, pepper and some dried oregano (or other spices) to the bread crumbs before dredging, it is improved immensely. I would also suggest thickening the sauce with 2 teaspoons of dissolved corn starch to thicken the sauce.

I tweaked it of course and it came out not just good, but fantastic!, you won't be disappointed!
Just 2 more simple ingredients.
Instead of using all chicken broth I substituded  to 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 cup Marsala wine.
In addition I sprinkled approx 3/4 cup of GOOD ( I'm a snob about Parmesan cheese and only use Trader Joe brand)
Parmesan cheese over the fried cutlets, but under the mushrooms and mozerrala cheese.
I also shredded the mozerrala cheese instead of slices. Still used 6 oz though.
Yum yum yum!

Made it exactly as written and found it lacked flavor. Will try again using other reviewers suggestions such as sauteing the mushrooms in butter and garlic, seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and even adding some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

I made this last night and it was delish. I didn't bread the chicken because I can't seem to get the breading to bake without being soggy. I also sautéed the mushrooms in butter and garlic before placing them on the chic & added s&p. I served it with buttery egg noodles and asparagus...yum! Even my picky 2 yr old grand baby loved it!

This might be my favorite chicken recipe... Unbelievable. Sauteed the mushrooms, added cream of mushroom soup, skipped the broth entirely (just used the leftover butter from sauteing), finished off with the cheese (used pepperjack - it added spicyness!) 10 minutes before the dish was done baking. Perfect. Love it. Served over rice and asparagus!

Tasted great! I added cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth, as others suggested, in addition to a small amount of white wine and heavy cream. I think next time I will add some more seasoning to the chicken for added flavor. Overall, the dish was delicious.

This was good as written.  Next time I will add lots more seasoning like minced garlic and onions and more chicken broth at a more sauce.  I did saute the mushrooms first before putting in baking pan.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is one of our favorite meals. I make this all the time. I have done like others, and sauted the mushrooms in Olive Oil and Garlic first, and I add extra chicken broth with a little Corn Starch so we can have more gravy. I have recommended this dish to all my Family and Friends, and they love it too!

Pretty good, for a new way to make chicken! We love mushrooms and cheese and heck, chicken is cheap right now, so we went for it. I did do what others suggested and added a can of mushroom soup to the broth and sautéed my mushrooms first. I forgot, however, the tip to pound out my chicken to an even thickness. I think this would have fixed the slight blandness in the thickest part of the meat. I'm sure I'll make it again but I'll be sure to pound the chicken.

Wow!  My boys asked me to add this to their favorites.  We all enjoyed it.  The chicken was so moist we could cut it with a fork.  I wish I could offer people some great advice, but the recipe is fantastic as is!!  Thank you.

AWESOME! As other reviewers suggested, I sautéed the mushrooms. Other than that, I made no other alterations or substitutions. Next time (which will be soon) my husband suggest we make chicken sandwiches with this same recipe. Look forward to making this dish again!

I used 1/2 cup of red cooking wine, 1 container of cremini and one container of assorted mushrooms. I sautéed my mushrooms in garlic salt and butter, then cooked the chicken in the same pan. I served it over rice and y family thought it was delicious. I will definitely make this again in the future.

I tried this recipe with some of the suggestions from others. I sauteed the mushroom beforehand, I added cream of mushroom soup and instead the the broth, I added a chicken bullion sliced very thin. This was delicious and my family went crazy over it.

My Husband and I loved this dish! I did exactly what the recipe said and it was delicious! I left the cheese on the whole time and when it was done. The cheese had a slight brown look. It was very good. I used low fat Mozzarella cheese. I will definatley make this again with some company and I'll bet they will love it too! It was so easy to make. I may try saute the mushrooms next time and add garlic. But really it was just fine without doing that.

Everyone Loved it! Only things i did differently, or at least things that weren't listed. I tenderized the chicken, pounding it flat with a meat hammer. I added a spoon full of flour to the chicken broth mixed well and then added it to the pan. I also used more of everything, but that's just because i really like mushrooms!  if this sounds like you might like it, MAKE IT~!

I made this dish the other night, even though I was kind of weary but I tried it because my husband loves mushrooms.  I read some reviews and used the modifications that were suggested. 1)I sautéed the mushrooms with minced garlic in butter before putting them in the lasagna tray. 2)I added Italian seasoning to my bread crumbs for flavour. 3)I also added a can of mushroom soup to the chicken broth, mixed them together and put them onto the chicken in the bed of sautéed mushrooms in the lasagna tray.  The result was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband & I both enjoyed this very quick, easy recipe! I will be making it again very soon!

This recipe is a family favorite, been making it for years, but here is a little change up. 1st usually make this the night before or at least 6 hours before,this way the 1.5 Cups chicken broth is absorbed to make it incredible plump and juice chicken, also make it with munster cheese and a little white wine to the broth..(No cream of mushrm. please don't ruin it) Enjoy

Very nice recipe. I have a child that doesn't like cheese, so I leave it off hers. Another doesn't like the mushrooms under the cheese, no problem. I was worried it would be soggy with the broth in the pan, but the flavors were good. Our dog stole a piece off the table and she is not a dog to do that.

I made this as written, but did add salt/pepper. I served the chicken with corn and mashed potatoes. This made for a nice weekday meal that my whole family enjoyed.

I've been cooking for many years (59 years old) and made this recipe, as written.  Well, ok.  I used chicken quarters because we prefer dark meat.  Both my husband and I loved it.  We love chicken, fresh mushrooms and mozzarella so, for us, what was not to like?  The taste of each ingredient rang true.  Since I cook for 2, I used a small, deep 1.5 quart dish and squeezed the chicken quarters into the dish.  The mushrooms (above and below he chicken layer) were piled high.  It created it's own great sauce without added ingredients.  I prefer to try recipes and rate as written.  This one was a winner to me.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We loved this! I cooked the mushrooms and garlic in butter and also a little white wine. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup at the end as others did and I mixed in 1/2 cup sour cream with it. It gave it extra flavor. It was even better the next day!

I usually dont write reviews but had to on this one.  Its tough to mess up anything with mushrooms and cheese in it but this recipe was a bust.  It was so bland and mushy.  Its definitely one we will not be having again.  On to the next...

Absolutely awesome -- my family wouldn't stop raving about this the whole way through dinner.  I did sauté the mushrooms with some garlic in the butter first.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts (since that's what I had on hand) and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth.  Will definitely be making this again soon!

This is restaurant quality.  The only thing I did different than the recipe, was I added the chicken broth to the pan to get the pan drippings. I would like to serve this over some spaghetti noodles next time.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made it just as instructed, except I fretted the mushrooms wouldn't get done so I increased the broth. It must have been okay, because when I went back for seconds the entire casserole was gone.

Changed it up a bit. Used 1 pkg mushrooms. Sliced chk breast on the thin side. Used panko brd crumbs and golden mushroom soup. 
Dredge chk in flour, egg and panko - cook in skillet until browned on both sides (used a little olive oil_.Set aside.
In same pan,melt butter, add a little more OO,a splash of wine,some garlic and the leftover panko crumbs. Add mushrooms and cook til soft.
Mix chicken broth with soup.Put in bottom of 9x13 pan. Put chicken in next. Spoon mushroom mixture over chicken. Cover with foil and bake for 15 or 20 mins or until no longer pink. Remove foil ,sprinkle mozz cheese (used grated) on top and back in oven til it melts. Chicken was fork tender with an awesome gravy that was perfect served over french fries. 5 stars because I never would have had inspiration to change it up without coming across this recipe and all the reviews. Thanks everyone!

I've made this a handful of times and I'm always amazed at how moist and tender the chicken is.  Definitely saute the mushrooms first and thicken the broth afterward, using your preferred method.  I like to  melt butter on the stove and saute some minced shallots, then add flour to make a roux.  Cook for a couple minutes then add the broth and it will thicken up nicely.  I also add a little white wine and season as needed.  It makes a lovely gravy, and I serve the whole thing over egg noodles with asparagus on the side.  It's pretty fool-proof.

My husband thought this was great! I will add more seasonings next time. I added the remainder of the beaten eggs to the broth and it made a nice sauce. Parmesan cheese works, because it was all we had.  Great base recipe that we can add to or take away. Served on a bed of brown rice and broccoli.

Love this dish! I did what others suggested and made a few changes. I used 2 cartons of fresh mushrooms and parsley that I sautéed in butter and garlic. I used Italian bread crumbs that I added red pepper and Cajun seasoning to. We like our food spicy! I also mixed cream of mushroom and cream of chicken into the chicken broth. It makes a wonderful gravy! I cooked it in the oven for 50 minutes and added lots of mozzarella for the last 10 minutes. I served it over egg noodles. Delicious!!!

This was very yummy, I received rave reviews from my family on this. I took the advice of other reviewers and used the italian bread crumbs and cream of mushroom soup as well. The chicken turned out very tender, it cut with a fork and spoon! (Dont judge I ran out of forks! ;P)

As written, this recipe could be prepared to serve as a "french dip" type sandwich, or maybe with a savory rice. If you want to serve with noodles, however, add the canned mushroom soup or make a cup of white sauce to stir into the broth.

This was an easy and delicious recipe which received my husband's highest recommendation. He said it's a "make it again" recipe! I followed the recipe to the T, using exactly the ingredients listed...and I won't change a thing the next time I make it! Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Loved this!! I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, garlic, zucchini and onions until the sides were brown. Then I poured a half a can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic (diluted with half cup water) in a baking dish, put the chicken on top and poured the rest of the soup on top of that.

This is a great recipe. I forgot to add the cheese and left for an errand and come back and no one even knew it needed cheese. Next time I will not forget to add the cheese. I think cheese can only make better. Pretty Good.

SO SO SO GOOD! Sauteed 1 medium onion finely diced, about 5 cloves of garlic (the onion and garlic due to complaints about taste- that fixed it!)and about 6 whole white mushrooms sliced in EVOO. Then I lined about 3/4 of that mixture on the baking pan. Instead of using full bread crumbs, I used about 1c of flour, 1/2c bread crumbs and a few sprinkles of each of these: Lawrys Seasoned Salt, garlic powder, pepper and a salt mix. I browned the chicken in EVOO and garlic and placed them on top of the mushroom mixture in the baking pan and added the rest of the mixture to the top of the chicken(although if you didn't want to do the rest, it's PERFECT just like that!). I mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup with the 3/4c chicken broth really good and spooned about a tablespoon onto each breast, and poured the rest around them. About 10 minutes in, I started water(with about a teaspoon or 2 of EVOO) for the penne. Last 5 minutes of the chicken baking, I added a mexican mixture cheese to the top of all 4 chicken breasts. The penne was done at the same time as the chicken. I drained the pasta and took the chicken out and put them on the plates. Then I added the "sauce" to the pasta and mixed it. YUM!!!!!!!

I made this exactly as directed and didn't think it was that good. It was fairly dry and bland. If I try this again, I will take the reviewers suggestions and saute the mushrooms before hand, add either chicken mushroom soup to the sauce or wine, and maybe add a sharper cheese. I think covering the dish while baking it might help as well. Overall, I would not make this as-is.

I took others advice and sautéed fresh mushrooms and also added cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  The chicken was indeed moist, and my husband liked this dish, but I thought it was rather bland.

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it turned out amazing. I took other reviewers' advice and I sauteed the mushrooms with some garlic and olive oil before adding them to the casserole dish, and I put the cheese over the casserole about 10 minutes before it was done. Additionally, I did add the 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to the mix, and it was delicious. I found my dish took about 20 minutes longer than the 30 minutes required to cook in the oven, but my chicken breasts may have been a little frozen in the middle. Also, I added about a 1/2 cup of feta cheese to the top as well as the mozzarella to give it a slightly sharper taste. Will definintly be making again!!

We really liked this! I only had Swiss not mozzarella but you couldn't even notice, it was so gooey and melted into the chicken. Will make again for sure.

This is an excellent dish!  I just want to share how I made it, I breaded the chicken with freshly grated crumbs, I sauteed the mushrooms in butter and garlic before putting in pan as others have suggested, and I used freshly grated parmesan cheese in addition to the mozzarella.  Lots of black pepper too. As we were eating it, my 17 yr old son suggested a sprinkle of lemon juice on it, and it was awesome!  He also said it's the first time he like mushrooms.  Great recipe, it goes in my file to make again soon!

This was a tasy dish for dinner, and we enjoyed the leftovers next day. I had some dried mushrooms, so rehydrated those and combined the excess water with the chicken broth for the required amount. Used on hand havarti cheese slices instead of mozarella. Also mixed in about 3 Tbsp of finely chopped garden herbs (oregano, sage, rosemary, thyme and parsley with the egg). Added salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. Did not have significant excess liquid that other reviews mentioned.

Really liked it! I used breast tenderloins because that is what I had and it was still very juicy. Next time I might try putting a layer of spinach under the chicken, just because I love mushrooms with spinach. Homerun meal!

GREAT recipe!!  Did take the advice of others and cooked the mushrooms before hand, added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth...and actually added 1/2 of a vidalia onion...this was AMAZING.  I'd also recommend adding the cheese at the end.  Served it over rice...my husband LOVED it, I loved it...so good.  Thank you!!

This was very delicious. However, it was too salty. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup as well as the chicken broth, as I read in the reviews. Next time I would leave out the chicken broth and just go with the cream of mushroom soup.

Delicious!!!! I did a little modifications for this dish as suggested by a couple of people. I used cream of chicken because that's what I have in hand and I also sauted some garlic and mushrooms before I placed them in the pan. I have to say it turns out really good. Definitely a keeper! Keep up the good work.

absolutly loved this recipe.But I did saute the mushrooms first, and added some red wine when they were almost done to kick up the flavour. Also the breading was italian breadcrumbs, and the cheese was added in the last 5-10 min of cooking ( for the leftovers I left the cheese off untill colled then packed them with the unmelted cheese on top for better microwaving results)
I finally found a recipe the boyfriend will request I make :) Thanks!!

When preparing this dish, I used others suggestions to enhance the recipe. I put the mushrooms in a skillet with olive oil and minced garlic, added a can of Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom. I also used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. Served with broccoli and quinoa. Sipped on a glass of Riesling and it was great! My only regret is not pounding the chicken breast a little thinner.

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup as others had done, and added the cheese in the last 15 minutes.   But sadly, I really wasn't crazy about the chicken at all...it was really bland and I couldn't even finish it.     However, the gravy tasted awesome over white rice!

Super easy and tasty too. It's not to high in calories and you can easily defer the rice and noodles and eat it by itself next to a salad for an easy low calorie dinner.

I made this....I added the cream of mushroom w/the chicken broth, saute the mushrooms, and did the swiss cheese instead.   Over a bed of white rice. My husband had 2 HUGE helpings of this.  We loved this recipe...its a keeper.

This was okay. It didn't have a lot of flavor, even though I seasoned the chicken beforehand. It wasn't bad though.

This was amazing!!!  I also took the advice of others and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth, and sautéed mushrooms and onions.  In addition, I added garlic salt (a fairly generous portion as we LOVE garlic) to the bread crumbs.  I was VERY happy with the result - as was the entire family!!

I made this tonight with the addition of cream of celery soup, Panko crumbs, pre-sauteeing portobellos in EVOO and garlic, & topped with shredded Mozz/Parm. The following review is from my husband:  "This is one of the best combinations of ingredients I have eaten. It is an extraordinarily savory concoction!  I highly recommend it."

This recipe seemed somewhat bland to me, and I did add a great deal of seasonings to the bread crumbs, additionally I added a can of cream of chicken to the broth.  I would not make this recipe again.

A-. Very good. Added a can of cream of mushroom soup (lite) as recommended by others and sauteed the mushrooms w/ garlic and olive oil before hand. Honestly, this is a yummy recipe but very heavy with the creams and oils required to make it taste good. Although it was delish- I don't think I'll be making this on a regular basis because I would rather spend my calories on something more delicious and decadent.

Recommend: Sautee mushrooms with minced garlic until tender. Use 1 can cream of mushroom soup with chicken broth! Serve over white rice/wild rice. Enjoyed! This was fabulous! Posted a picture for all to see :)   Thanks again!

Freakin Delish! Instead of chicken broth I used cream of mushroom. I also sauteed the mushrooms with garlick before adding it to the pan. I added enough cream of mushroomto the pan to serve as a sauce over fettucini. Perfecto!

I have made this several times since and each time it gets better!
* I also want to make a comment to the person who said that they made this recipe "chicken with MUSHROOMS" without the mushrooms - Do NOT review a recipe that you have not followed to a T and then give it three stars because your husband doesnt like mushrooms.  Why in the Good Lords name would you try this recipe?  Dolt.

This was a simple and delicious recipe....even for picky eaters.

I followed others' advice - sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and garlic, pounded the chicken and seasoned with salt & pepper before dredging (didn't use eggs), seasoned with both bread crumbs and some dried herbs (oregano and thyme), added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and used asiago cheese which I melted over the chicken in the microwave after it was done baking.  My boyfriend and his roommate were over for dinner that night and there were no left overs!  Delicious!

One of my favorite recipes.  I do exactly what the recipe says but I add a lot of extras.  Every time is different.  You can never add too much cheese so I go all out with the cheese.  I cook pasta also and add half of it to the bed of mushrooms and then the other half on top of the chicken.  I usually use smaller pasta such as ditalini, elbow macaroni or medium shells.  Anything bite size will work.  I also add cream of potato soup often.  I have used the other "cream of....." soups and they have been excellent also.  Tonight I am adding yellow squash and jalapenos.  I also add basil, parsley, Italian seasoning and pepper on top of the cheese.  I have added broccoli ,asparagus and green peppers to this dish.  It always turns out great!  I do not think you can go wrong with this recipe.  Follow the recipe but use your imagination and you will be pleasantly surprised!

This was awesome!!!! I did add the Cream of Mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  We served it over white rice.  Loved the creamy sauce it made with the chicken and mushrooms.  Will add to my rotation of regularly made entrees.

After reading previous reviews, I looked forwarded to trying this delicious meal.  Like others, I embellished a little.  Sauted the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil, with a little sherry.  I also added cornstartch to the broth, which was a combination of the chicken broth, cream of mushroom soup and the runoff from the sauted mushroom mixture.  After adding the mozzerella in the last 10 minutes of cooking, I served over rice.  Scrumptious!!

I made this dish for my husband and he loved it. That is saying a lot because I usually get criticized for my cooking.  I'm almost excited to cook....almost.  However, this will be a dish I will add to my favorite category.

Pretty good. The only change I made was I dipped the chx in flour...then the egg...then the crumbs. I used Italian Seasoned crumbs. I served this over mashed potatoes.   Will make again.

I have made this countless times and even my husband knows the recipe by heart. We love this meal so much and always have all the ingredients on hand. As others have mentioned you can add sauteed onion and mushroom and I also add a tiny bit of sirachi sauce. I mix together 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup chicken broth and about a tablespoon of sirachi sauce which I dump on the chicken before I put it in the oven. I also sprinkle with mozzarella cheese once it comes out of the oven. It turns out perfect EVERY time!

This was really good. I did add cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth and I nused provolone cheese because it is what I had on hand.  I also sauted the mushrooms before adding to the dish. I served it over brown rice. It was yummy. Even my 3 year old liked it.

I thought this recipe was okay. There really wasn't that much flavor to it. I added a can of cream of mushroom like others suggested and that helped a little bit. I also sauted the mushrooms with some garlic before. I wish there was more of a thickened "sauce." I served with egg noodles. I may try and redo this recipe again!

Everyone loved this. I wish I had the full 3 cups of mushrooms to have added. Since I did not I added carrots in the bottom and topped with mushooms.  The chicken was nice and moist.  Next time I will make sure I have enough mushrooms. I will also add more of an assortment of veggies.

This turned out really well, but would have been a bit bland without some modifications. 5 stars with these simple changes: sautee mushrooms in olive oil with fresh garlic (I used 1 clove, minced)and just add a little garlic powder and black pepper to the bread crumbs. I also sprinkled a little parsley over everything before putting in oven just for an extra flavor boost. This had great flavor, will make again. Thank you :)

This was pretty good.  I made the following changes: - added one onion chopped in large pieces and 1 clove garlic to mushrooms and sauteed briefly.  Used panko for crust.  Added one can low-fat chicken soup.  It was a hit!  - mushrooms

Amazing. Followed the other suggestions and sauteed the mushrooms first, then added cream of chicken to broth. This was easy to make and delicious. A crowd pleaser at the fire station!

This is delicious. I made a couple of suggested changes -- added cream of mushroom soup, sauteed my mushrooms before putting them in the pan. I didn't have enough fresh mushrooms, so I supplemented with some canned (which I sauteed with the fresh; they tasted great). I coated the chicken with panko breadcrumbs that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I was also in a hurry and pounded the chicken breasts to be about 1/2" thick in hopes of speeding up cooking time. The dish was done in 30 min, and the chicken was surprisingly tender, not even requiring a knife to cut it. This recipe was a delicious surprise!

The best thing about this chicken was that it came out really moist.  I had pretty big breasts (hee hee!), so I pounded them flatter than they were before breading them.  My only complaint about the recipe was that it came out a little bland.  This was even after I added some Lawry's season salt and parmesan to the breading mixture.  I would have liked to have had just a little more flavor.

I made the recommended changes- sauteed mushrooms and garlic and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth and also added a bit of swiss cheese to the mozzarella for more flavor- awesome add in!  Added cheese the last 15 minutes of baking along with a shake of parmesan and bread crumbs.  A winner.

Yum! My family loved it and it came out great when I followed reviews from other people. Sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and garlic and mixed cream of mushroom with the broth. Definitely will be making again!

After reading some other reviews I sautéed the mushrooms in a little bit of butter and added minced garlic to it.  I also added cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth mixture and poured everything on the bottom of the dish before putting in the oven. I used mozzarella cheese and layered it on top of the chicken and also shredded some in the bottom part of the dish.  I am a pretty picky eater and found this dish incredibly easy to make and devour. My boyfriend was licking the sauce off his plate!!

THIS RECIPES WAS VERY GOOD. THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WERE...I ALSO SAUTEED THE MUSHROOMS WITH A FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC BEFORE ADDING THEM TO THE PAN. I ADDED A CAN OF CAMPBELL'S CONDENSED MUSHROOM SOUP TO THE BROTH. NEXT TIME I AMD GOING TO BUY THE MUSHROOM AND GARLIC SOUP TO GIVE IT ALITTLE KICK. I ALSO SPICED UP THE BREAD CRUMBS WITH OREGANO AND BASIL. I GARNISHED IT WITH PARSLEY AT THE END. I SERVED THIS OVER EGG NOODLES AND A TOSSED SALAD. IT WAS DELICIOUS. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE. I WILL DEFINITLY MAKE THIS AGAIN

This recipe was awesome!! I made a few changes: sauted the mushrooms in olive oil with chopped garlic, added one can of cream of mushroom soup, one can of chicken broth to the pan and added cornstarch to make a gravy like mushroom sauce that I added to the chicken before baking.  Will definately make again!!

The recipe was good, but I made a few changes.  I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and onions.  Like the other reviews stated, I added cream of mushroom soup with the broth and white wine.  I served it on top of egg noodles. My boyfriend loved it! The wine really brought out the flavor.

This recipe was wonderful! I made it last night for my family and they loved it! As other users said, sauteing the mushrooms first is best. We would have liked a creamier sauce though but it was still good the moist chicken was the best. We had ours over bow tie pasta.

We really liked this dish. I seasoned the bread crumbs heavily. After placing the chicken and mushrooms in the pan, I placed a teaspoon of butter on top the mushrooms, then the cheese. I used half chicken broth and half white wine. My husband really liked it and he's not a huge fan of chicken. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe!!!!!  My fiance (who doesn't love chicken night) quoted, "This is the best chicken I have ever ate." This is a big deal because his family operates a high class catering business. I also used other people's hints like salt and pepper the egg, salutee mushrooms after cooked, I added spices italian, rosemary, and oregano. I didnt have cream of mushrooms, but we used fresh mushrooms and cream of chicken. I loved it and cant wait to cook it with cream of mushrooms. The cheese on the top is the best!

I used one 8oz of baby bella mushrooms,sliced and sweated them a bit with some finely chopped onion, first. I also added a dash of Italian seasoning in the egg.  And used Monterey jack cheese-didn't have the other.  Just melted it in the last 3 minutes of cooking.  I halfed the recipe, because cooking for only two.  This is soooo goood.  We will have it again and again.  And my husband is not fowned of chicken, and he said it was a keeper!  Thanks!

This chicken was relatively good, needed a few changes.  Will not add the cheese next time till just before serving as it tends to over cook and get to hard.  Will add a little white wine for that extra pizzaz and I will season the chicken breats better

I thought this was very good - I LOVE mushrooms so I used more than the recipe called for (about 4 cups) and next time I make it I'll use even more than that! I used italian seasoned bread crumbs with a little parmesan cheese and black pepper added. I only had shredded mozzarella on hand and will make sure to have sliced mozz. for the next time. The chicken was very moist! The bottom of the chicken was a little mushy from the broth, but I didn't mind. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used 1/2 can of chicken stock and 1/2 can of lowfat cream of mushroom soup.  I also put a few cloves of garlic in the bottom of the baking dish for more flavor.  I served it with couscous on the side.  The leftovers were amazing for lunch today.

It was TERRIBLE!!! I give this a 2 if that. I was Beyond Disappointed!!!  I even did what some of the other suggestions like sauteing the mushrooms with olive oil and garlic before hand and also adding the cream of mushroom. This recipe is beyond help!!!

This has become a big favourite very fast.  I love mushrooms, so I use double the amount.  To my mind, sauteing the mushrooms is overkill.  30-35 minutes in the oven is more than enough time to cook them.  Some other preferences: 1)swiss or monterey jack cheese are also fab  2)I like grated cheese instead of slices - a bonus: you can get away with using a bit less, for those who are in slimming mode  3)try apple cider or 1/2 white wine 1/2 broth  4)when I'm in a rush, I don't fry the chicken - just put it in the dish and bake; it's not crispy, but quicker and fewer dishes to clean  5)I skip the egg - just moisten the chicken with water Shake'n'Bake style  6)thyme is pretty much mandatory with mushrooms - I make sure the breadcrumbs have thyme mixed in as well as other stuff  7)green beans go nicely with this
  ....  
Everyone should try this recipe!

Skipped the egg bath and breading, just seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and browned in saucepan. Followed other suggestions: sauteed mushrooms first and waited until last 10 minutes of baking to add cheese.  This was DELICIOUS and two out of the five kids do not like mushrooms....we didn't sprinkle any on top of those portions before adding cheese.  Thanks!  This one is a keeper!

This chicken was delicious.  I wouldn't bother serving it with pasta, as there really is no sauce left over.  But the chicken is definately worth it.

Very good and easy to make.  I followed the advice of other & pounded the chicken first.  Also, I didn't have enough broth to make a gravy but I didn't think it needed it.  I didn't have mozarella so used provolone & it was great.  I will make this agin.

I took others advice and cooked the mushrooms first to be sure they were done. This was really just so-so and I will probably not make it again. It was very easy to prepare.

Very easy & very quick. My three year old was able to help. It was crunch time, needed a meal, looked this up and made it exactly as stated. It's a great staple because the ingredients are always on hand and the whole family liked it. Now that I have read the reviews, I plan to doctor it up with a few of the suggestions. This dish has 5 star potential. But as is: it's really perfect for a great quick family dish! Thanks Kim, it's going in the recipe box.

This recipe is very easy and my boyfriend loved it.  I was not that impressed with how soggy the chicken got after being baked in the broth.  I guess it depends on your take.  I used pepper-jack cheese intead of motz to add some flavor.  I love all the mushrooms and I added some garlic too.  I liked this much better over rice than over noodles.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I think I may have liked it better without the chicken broth.  My husband absolutely hated it and wouldn't even eat it.  I don't think I will be making this one again.

Yummy!  I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used pepperjack which gave it so much flavor.  I will make this dish again for sure.  A very easy and very tasty chicken recipe...you can't go wrong.

This was a easy, tasty chicken dish.  I did as another reviewer suggested and sauted the mushrooms and threw in some onions and garlic with the mushrooms.  Next time I will definately double the amount of mushrooms because there wasn't enough for my family.

The recipe was OK.  I would have liked it to be a bit more creamy.  As is, it was basically a baked piece of chicken with cheese and mushrooms on top.  I would probably do as a previous reviewer suggested and add a can of cream of mushroom soup.

This recipe was very good. The only thing that I have changed with this recipe is that I used canned sliced muchrooms and I used Spicy Monteray Jack with Jalapeno's cheese.  I didn't put the cheese on right away either, I let it cook for 15 minutes, then add the cheese and let it cook for another 15. This way the cheese does not get hard or burnt.  Excellent recipe..thanks!

We enjoyed this dish, but I did make a few changes.  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't brown the chicken in a skillet, I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and I didn't have chicken broth so I used marsala wine.  It baked for about 35 min.  The chicken turned out very moist and full of flavor.  I'll probably make this again.

This was a wonderful dish! We really enjoyed it and this recipe in a keeper for sure. I served it over bow-tie noodles and it was very tasty. I think next time i'll follow others advice and not add the cheese till the last 10 minutes or so. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I was surprised with the "5-star" rating.  Normally I can't say enough about the 5-star rated recipies I've made. This was just "ok".  The chicken was very tender, but I thought it was bland.  My son loved it, though, and I will definitely try it again with the addition of some other spices.

This recipe turned out so tasty!  It was so easy to make, and my chicken wasn't bland.  I made sure to use the italian seasoned bread crumbs and it was perfect.  I served the chicken breasts on a bed of rice, next time I am going to use garlic mashed potatoes for something different.

My husband is not a chicken lover but he enjoyed this very much. I used egg beaters instead of eggs and olive oil instead of butter for dietary reasons and it was still delicious. Thanks for a keeper.

This recipe was okay. I agree with the review that stated that it was a little bland. The chicken was extremely moist which was a great surprise. The mushrooms were okay. I would really have to play with this try it again.

I made this recipe with Baby Bella mushrooms and added some white wine as suggested and it was awesome!  My husband thought it was the best meal I've ever made and my mother-in-law couldn't stop raving about it (you know that means it was good).  I will make this MANY MANY more times!

The chicken was very moist, but it was kind of a bland taste.  Needs some spicing up.

This recipe is mistakenly under the slow cooker (crock pot) section, but is cooked on the stove and in the oven. Overall, it is a tasty recipe if you love mushrooms. I used half regular mushrooms and half portabella. I used a total of 16 ounces of mushrooms and had plenty! I like a stronger tasting cheese so I added grated parmesean after cooking. In the future I will use either a smoked provolone or a swiss cheese. My husband and I really liked the recipe.

I made this for some guests and we all thought it was great.  (I used monterey jack cheese added during the last 10 min. of baking, as suggested.)We had this dish over egg noodles, accompanied by peas, breadsticks, and a nice green salad.  Delicious!  Even better as leftovers the next day.

This recipe was very yummy, the combo of chicken, mushrooms and mozzerella is awesome! It was a little too moist for my taste, so I cooked it a little longer on the stovetop, but then it was great! :)

I made a few modifications to the recipe:  I only had 2 cups mushrooms on hand. Also, I added some italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.  I sauteed the chicken in butter with a spash of olive oil and a little crushed garlic.  I did not have mozzarella cheese on hand, so I used a shredded mexican blend.  I thought the sauce looked a little thin at the end of the cooking time. So, once the chicken was done, I plated the chicken and thickend the sauce in a sauce pan with a little cornstarch.  We poured the sauce over the chicken and buttered eggnoodles.  Very good. 

My kids and hubby loved the dish.  My son loves mushrooms, so he was pretty happy with his dinner.

Really not that impressed, I think it was lacking a certain "zing".  Maybe if you added the juice of a lemon it would pick up the flavor.  You should add cornstartch if you want it to be a thicker sauce.

My husband really liked this.  It has a mild flavor and is very good with brown rice.  I added more mushrooms and chicken broth to serve as a gravy over the rice.  The chicken is very moist, even when served as a leftover.  Thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS!  It looked great! And tasted great too.  My husband who isn't much of a chicken fan loved it and finished his whole portion.  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder into the bread crumbs.  I also poured in a whole can of chicken broth so we'd have enough for our rice!  Thanks Kim for the great recipe. I look forward to making it again!

Added garlic, extra mushrooms, extra mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  Put the cheese on after baking for 20 minutes.  Served with chicken flavored rice.  My family gave this one 5 stars!

This recipe was great!  All the combinations created a wonderful flavor and this is a dish that I will be serving many times over.  My fiancee said that I can even add it as a regular meal around our house.  I added parmesan/romano cheese blend to the bread crumbs and salt and pepper to the egg wash.  I also thickened the juices as someone else suggested, but next time, I will add the whole can of chicken broth so that we can have more gravy to serve over the noodles and chicken.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!!

I have been using a very similar recipe to this one for many years. The only difference is that instead of mozzerella cheese, I use monterrey jack cheese. I highly recommend giving it a try with the different cheese. It melts as well, and gives it a VERY distinct flavor!!!

I agree with those who say 1 large egg is sufficient. The second time I made this recipe, I added salt and pepper to the egg and was very pleased with the result.  Otherwise, its a bit too bland for me.  Add as much as you would if you were sprinkling them on both sides of the chicken breasts.

I unintentionally overloaded on mushrooms and had to find a way to use them - boy, am I glad I made that mistake.  This is a wonderful  recipe and will use it again.  I've also emailed it to other mushroom/chicken lovers.

Update 2/15/12.  I made this again today and it was amazing.  The changes I made this time was to add some more herbs, garlic salt and a bit of parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  For the broth, I dissolved a Knorr chicken stock in 3/4 cup of white wine.  It added amazing flavor!  I also put the cheese on just about 5 minutes before it was done, so as to not brown it.  I served it with pasta sauted in the same pan I browned the chicken in, with olive oil, green onion, minced garlic and laughing cow garlic and herb cheese.  Thicken the broth by reducing it stovetop and spoon over.  Amazing!  

Original review:  This is a wonderful recipe.  I overcooked it a bit, and didn't use enough cheese, and my husband still loved it.  Next time I'll add some more seasoning though, the bread alone wasn't quite enough for us.  Still, delish!

The presentation of the acutal chicken dish is great. Delicous too, however I have no idea why they suggest serving it over rice. I would definitly serve it with steamed broccoli and possibly rice pilaf. But dont make the mistake I did by making white rice as the recipe suggests. I think the chicken can stand on its own.

I'm still learning to cook new things
and this recipe got me started on making
more "baked chicken" type recipes. I
like to think of this recipe as 
chicken stroganoff.

This is a great recipe to take to work to share with co-workers.  I work nights and we try to make a 30 minute dinner special.  This recipe is easy to fix, looks and tastes great. It was easy to "tote" and reheated beautfully when it was time for dinner.  The recipe was requested and shared.

I made this for my family and they couldn't stop raving.  The flavor was outstanding.  I made mine with baby bella mushrooms, which have a richer flavor than plain white mushrooms. My 5 year old had seconds, as well as my husband.

I served this to company and they really enjoyed it.  (update) However, after making it a second time, I am bumping my review up to a 5 in all catagories.  This is sooooo good.  And it seems to be one of those dishes that gets better with time....

Definitely a dish to make again and again! Reading other people’s tips and suggestions helped me a lot! I added Italian seasoning to the seasoned bread crumbs gave the chicken more flavor. I will be making this again and sharing the recipe with my friends!

I loved this and so did my family! The only changes I made was I sautéed the mushrooms before added to oven and I also added a can of cream of mushroom to the broth - it made the sauce perfect!! Served over rice! Will definitely make again!

This was excellent! My Hubby loved it, I only used two chicken breasts, pounded them down a little, used 1 egg and added water to make an egg wash, dipped. them in egg than the bread crumbs added some fresh basil oregano and salt and pepper.
Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a very tasty recipe

Great recipe. I’ve made it a couple of times. I like to sauté the mushrooms with some shallots and beef bouillon first. It adds a lot of flavor.  Also, don’t overcook.   After cooking the cutlets on the stove, they only need about 20 minutes in the oven

Please, please do NOT add cream of mushroom soup to this delicious recipe!  Or at least try it as written first, and then decide if you think it needs to have canned glop poured over it.  I think you already know how I feel about it!  The only changes I made were to saute the mushrooms lightly first, and I added a little bit of chopped onion.  I served it over rice, and it was delicious.  Next time, we'll try it over noodles.

Made this for supper tonight   Very easy recipe   I pounded the chicken
breasts a little bit to make them more tender.   I used instant chicken bullion instead of chicken broth.  I used Portobello mushrooms.  I sprinkled shredded Italian cheese over the dish as I didn't have any mozzarella cheese.  came out delicious.  This recipe is a keeper

My wife worked late, so I went for it. Very easy and straight forward. I added just a bit of truffle oil to bring out mushroom flavors, as well as a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a slight  kick. Went well served over Capellini pasta. Broccoli and carrots as a tasty side dish.

Despite reading very mixed reviews, I made this dish for dinner tonight. My teenager had a craving for mushrooms, and loves chicken, so it was a win! I cooked the mushrooms with butter and garlic in a pan before hand and seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and garlic powder (per reviews) before breading. Put everything in a pan, added a few tablespoons of broth, and topped with cheese (we opted for provolone). Then I realized my oven was not preheating - what a great time to find that out! So I finished cooking on the stove top to ensure the chicken was cooked thoroughly. SUPER easy to prepare and very tasty! We both finished our plates. I’d just be sure to season the chicken to your liking! I’ll definitely be making again!

It was great! Next time I’ll add white wine to the chicken broth. And minced garlic with the butter.

Fabulous recipe. I do change it a tiny bit each time depending on my ingredients on hand. But the original is so good-no changes are really needed.

Restaurant quality. My husband requested chicken and mushrooms so I did a quick google search and had all ingredients so made this on the fly. He loved it so much.

This was really good. We made all the changes a prior reviewer suggested, sautating mushrooms before adding to the recipe, adding cheese at the end and seasoning the chicken a little. With all these changes the meal was fantastic, I just took off one star because of the changes.

We found it tender and tasty. I pounded the chicken breast a little thinner. I made it exactly except I found that one egg was sufficient to dip 4 chicken breasts in. The breadcrumbs on the underside of the chicken were a little soggy because of the chicken broth. Next time I will only bread the tops before I brown them in skillet. Good recipe.

A wonderful recipe as is, but I like the idea of sautéing the mushrooms  first and browning the chicken in the same pan.  But even as directed, this was delicious.

I sauteed the mushrooms and fresh garlic in olive oil, removed them from the pan and browned the chicken in the same pan.  After removing the chicken, I deglazed the pan with the broth and wine.  Topped with mozzarella at the end of the cooking time.  It was so good!

after reading the reviews I modified it this way:
1. we like thighs so i used bone in skinless thighs. 
2. lightly sauted mushrooms with a little garlic before adding them to the recipie.
3. Added a can of cream of chicken soup to the broth. (didn't have mushroom soup on hand)
4. added some grated parmesan to my breadcrumbs.
5.  i reserved some of the cheese to top it off t the end - i used a grated italian cheeses mix.
5 covered it with foil until the last 5 min of cook time at which time i added the remaining cheese.  
it was fantastic  thanks !!!

Quick, easy and delicious dish!  I used a blend of canned and fresh, “gourmet-blend” mushrooms.  Served it with long grain & wild rice.

Only modification I would make is to follow others’ suggestions and add a can of either cream of mushroom or chicken but overall it was a satisfying dish.

Nope. This was a super easy recipe to throw together, but not one of my family members liked it. Very little to no flavor. Next time I would do this whole recipe in the pan, add some wine, herbs, and maybe provolone cheese instead of or with  the mozzarella.

Being honest, this recipe - while decent - was blander than I anticipated. I'll experiment with it again in the future and use higher quality bread crumbs and something to inspire more flavor from it, but it just lacked in expected flavor - in no small part because there's very little to this recipe beyond breaded chicken in chicken broth. It deserves a little saucier component to augment them mushrooms!

Super easy recipe, the only thing I added was a little garlic salt on the mushroom and chicken.  I halved the recipe since there is only two of us and still ended up with leftovers.  I will make this again.  I served with long grain rice and a fresh salad.

I added the cream of mushroom soup and made a gravy out of the juices on the bottom of the pan. Came out very good. Wish I would have pounded the chicken breasts. They came out very thick. I am going to try it next time with chicken thighs.

Love this one!  Have made a few times.  I brown up my chicken first, transfer to baking dish, then dump my mushrooms with some minced garlic in the same pan nice and hot!  Top the chicken with the mushrooms and the pour crm of mushroom already mixed with the chicken broth on top.   This time I topped using havarti slices 15 minutes before it's done.  serve with chicken flavored seasoned rice and done!

Great flavor. Although I should have listened to other reviews and waited until the end to put the cheese on. As crazy as it sounds, I love burnt cheese but it slid right off the chicken when I cut into it. I did sauté my mushrooms with garlic, oregano, Italian seasoning, garlic salt and butter beforehand.

As one reviewer suggested I pounded the chicken so it would cook more uniformly.  Sautéed the mushrooms as others suggested.  Since I didn't want a creamy sauce, I increased the broth to 1c  and mixed in some corn starch to thicken it.  I substituted panko for bread crumbs as that's what I typically use.  Added rosemary, basil, garlic powder & onion powder to the panko as it wasn't seasoned.  Added a tsp of Worcestershire to the beaten egg.   After breading the chicken I refrigerated it for about a half hr as I have found the coating sticks better.  Left the cheese until the chicken was almost done and added a little white wine just before adding the cheese.   Served this with asparagus and stuffing.  It was terrific.  I don't like the mess browning or frying makes, but I will make this again.  The seasonings could be ramped up if preferred, but this was quite lovely.

My family LOVED this! I had to cook it a bit longer in the pan, and oven because the breasts we buy are just huge (loaded with salt water most likely) anyway, It was delicious and I will cook it again, but I will add more mushrooms.

This was very good, I added the mushroom soup as suggested in reviews. (Although I'd like to try it again without). Also included some peas in with the mushrooms and onions and it added a wonderful taste and pop of green color.

Everyone loved this. I agree with the lack of sauce so I added a can of cream of chicken soup, as that was all the cream soup I had on hand. It still could have been saucier. Served it with pasta and peas. Everyone loved. Shared with a hungry neighbor who asked for the recipe

Delicious! This dish was a last minute choice for something different with ingredients I already had at home. We loved it. My husband said the leftovers were even better than the first go-around. We'll definitely be having this again.

This is a very good dish for chicken.  I used boneless skinless thighs because I didn't want the chicken to be dry.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I used double the amount of mushrooms and sautéed them slowly with salt, pepper, garlic and onions.  I added some red wine after and put the chicken in the roaster first.  Then I added the mushroom and onion mixture.  I mixed some Balsamic Vinegar in with the chicken broth.  In the last 15 minutes of cooking time, I sprinkled the chicken with shredded Italian mix of cheese.  Was delicious.  But, even better the next day for left overs.  I will make this again, though I may thicken the sauce so that it is even more tasty.

Used chicken thighs and they weren't entirely cooked. I returned them to the oven for another 20 minutes. Next time I will add some spice for more flavor.

This turned out great! Money's tight, so I substituted the whole mozzarella for shredded. I had large chicken breasts and browned the meat in my cast iron, and needed to keep adding butter to keep the meat from burning, but otherwise, I kept to the recipe. I probably could've cooked it longer, maybe 45 minutes, so that the chicken would've been done just a little bit more but it was a hit with my family which isn't easy. I was very happy!

I should have looked at the reviews and taken their advice about sautéing the mushrooms and adding the soup. Without these additional ingredients, it was bland. The broth was just, well, broth.

The crisp chicken crust just falls off while the chicken bakes. Probably should cook a little longer on the range and go on a wire rack pan so the juice runs under the chicken and it doesn't bake as long. Also, There's no seasoning. It was bland, moist and messy.

This recipe was simple to make and delicious,  It is just the two of us so I cut the ingredients in half . It would be simple to increase the amounts as well and serve it for company. I am trying to watch my carbs so didn't serve any pasta or rice, although I will if serving for company. A simple caprese salad and green beans, meal complete????

I did as suggested and sauteed the onions and  the first half of the mushrooms adding a little garlic at the end.  The rest was pretty much as directed.  Very tasty and moist.  Will make it for guests next time.

Excellent base recipe.  I sautéed the mushrooms in butter and olive oil with an onion and chopped garlic and red pepper flakes first, poured in 9x13 baking pan.  Placed the browned chicken on top, added the chicken broth and mozzarella cheese, baked for 20 minutes.  Perfect!  And yummy!  Wanted to add the cream of mushroom soup as other reviewers have suggested but didn't have any on hand.  I will make this again and will try it with the CoM soup.

Followed some suggestions from others like sautéing the mushrooms first, adding cream of mushroom soup, and Swiss cheese instead added during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I also browned the chicken in the same skillet I used to sauté the mushrooms. It’s the juiciest chicken I have ever made!

I made this without cheese, and it was very yummy. 
I mistakenly baked it with a lid on the dish, so the bread crumbs were soggy, but otherwise it was a good dish. 

I served it with white rice and lemon garlic asparagus.

Added cream of mushroom like suggested by other reviewers, sautéed the mushrooms, and replaced the cheese with a shredded version. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time!

I've made this twice, the first time following the recipe exactly. The second time I used panko crumbs and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Honestly, both times were kind of meh. The melted cheese squares added a waxiness that was unpleasant. The breadcrumb version just got soggy after the broth was poured over the chicken. It's a miss for me.

I made this dish for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend I only had about 1 hour 1/2 to buy the ingredients and make it and it was a complete success! Fun to eat, tasty, perfect for mushroom lovers! I added more mushrooms than the recipe recommends and it turned out delicious!

This was so easy, and the flavor was exceptional!  Since not everyone in my house loves mushrooms, I still put mushrooms on the bottom the entire pan, but only put them on top of 1/2 the chicken.  This made it easier to serve some chicken without mushrooms, while still capturing the necessary flavor.   Will definitely be making this again!

Since 1st time, made exactly as written .  Found it very, very bland, and excessive amnt of mushrooms for recipe size (but since I love mushrooms, not a prblm for me, but could easily be for others). Next time i make this will def add some spices, maybe onions & white wine for sure - it needs the help.

This was nice as written, 3.5 stars. Good ingredients, lovely flavour. However, it has the potential for being great if it's prepared better. The way it's written produces slightly soggy breading, slightly dry mushrooms, and slightly over cooked cheese. So I made this a second time with the following changes - cooked the chicken on a rack above the broth - pan fried the mushrooms and placed them on top of the cooked chicken instead of cooking  them together - only putting cheese on in the last 5 minutes of cooking. The result: 4.5 stars. There is still something missing, but it's a lot better than the original. Will keep playing with this one as my girls loves mushrooms.

I made this recipe over the weekend. The only change I made was that I cut the chicken breast in to smaller pieces so it would cook faster and be easier to bread. It was an absolute hit. I served it over egg noodles. Will absolutely be making this again.

I thought  mine was too salty.  I liked the  breading, thought it added flavor. I just wasn't that impressed with it. The "gravy" was ok, good with mashed potatoes but not my favorite recipe for chicken. Won't make it again.

Loved it!! Added cream of mushroom to the stock and used a cast iron skillet. I browned the chicken, took them out, sautéed the veggies in butter and the drippings for just a few. Then I replaced the chicken to the pan putting them on top of the veggies, poured the stick/soup mix to the pan around the chicken, and baked it. We forwent the cheese entirely. We had it with mashed potatoes and were practically licking the plates! Oh my goodness, so yummy!

Very good and the chicken was so moist and tender. Took the suggestions from others about sautéing the mushrooms with EVOO, a little butter and garlic. Then browned the chicken in the same pan. Used 1/2 Panko and 1/2 regular breadcrumbs and added Parmesan and Italian seasoning. Had leftover chicken gravy, so used that with some white wine. .

I followed advice of some of the others and added the can of soup and also cooked the mushrooms with some garlic first.  I also doubled the sauce as some others suggested.   It was good but I think next time I may add a boullion cube to add a bit more flavor to the sauce.  I will make it again.

I’ve made this recipe several times and love it. As others suggested I sautéed the mushrooms in butter first, put  cream of mushroom soup in the baking dish before adding chicken and used shredded mozzarella on top of the chicken during the last 5 minutes of baking.

Delicious!!!!! We all loved this dish! Used 2 pkgs of fresh mushrooms, which I did saute first in butter, minced garlic, onion powder, and a little seasoned salt.

Waited mushrooms in garlic and olive oil. Since I'm gluten free I used Progresso Creamy mushroom soup with broth and added garlic to the sauce and garlic salt. Used GF bread crumbs that I seasoned. Also added some fresh Rosemary. Very good.

This recipe was simple, but delicious! I did season the chicken and the bread crumbs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and coriander. I also put worsteshire sauce in the eggs before coating the chicken. The chicken was tender and flavorful! Easy for a weeknight meal.

Pretty good but I would suggest to saute the mushrooms a bit. I also made a light chicken gravy out of the drippings. Yum! I would also suggest adding the cheese when its about done. My cheese burnt when I put it on when I put it in the oven

this recipe is all messed up.  The temp & bake time is way off.  after 30 minutes my chicken measured 125 internal temp.  This completely messed up the timing with the vegitables and noodles.

There are no seasonings in the recipe.  what's up with that?
how does this get 4 1/2 stars?

I salvaged it by jacking the temp to 400 and seasoning to taste on the plate.  That's

I made this dish as stated with only 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves. I doubled up on the mushrooms because we love them. I think it tasted a little bland and the breading got too moist. I plan to make it again with perhaps a little rosemary added to the chicken and less chicken broth to the baking dish. My breasts were on the large side and I think they made a lot of juice. The cheese was wonderful on it. I will try again with my changes.

I suggest covering the dish if you put the cheese on early so that it doesn't burn the cheese, or you can wait til the chicken has 5 to 10 min left and put the cheese on as it finishes cooking. This was an absolute hit with my family. This is a must try. Enjoy!

After reading several reviews, I made the following changes: I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and about a 1/2 cup of onion; added a full cup of broth to the baking pan; added some Parmesan, parsley flakes, basil, and oregano to plain bread crumbs; poured the liquid from the pan into the skillet I had used to brown the chicken and added cornstarch to make a gravy; and waited to put the cheese on until I pulled the pan out of the oven. Next time I'll use more broth so that there will be more gravy. The chicken was moist and flavorful!

This is excellent as written but better if you replace broth with cream of celery soup, add a small chopped onion and a touch of garlic.

Sauce could use a bit of thickening, it really does benefit from the last unit addition of parsley prior to serving. Also, I've made this with a combination of light and dark meat, with and without skin. I think the dark meat, with it's more intense flavor, is more of a winner than the chicken breasts alone.

I loved this recipe.  So very easy to make.  I used large and thick boneless chicken breasts so I had to add about 15 minutes to the bake time.  I also doubled the mushrooms as we love mushrooms.  Everything came out perfect.  Great for leftovers too.  Definitely added this recipe to my favorites file and can't wait to make it again.

Made this for the kids and i, sautéed 2 big packages of mushrooms first with some onion and garlic powder, added some parm, a little garlic salt, and some more Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs, Also salt and pepper to all- not bland at all. Sauce was very thin but good, used 1/2 can chicken broth.

Delicious!  Made the change to sauté mushrooms, onion and 1 clove chopped garlic to put on top. Everything else as written. The chicken was pounded because they were large. It came out moist and favorable! Served with buttered egg noodles.

This was so easy to make and tasted so good. i followed the recipe as written and will definitely make it again. That being said, due to the ingredients you can easily switch different ingredients and make something truly your own. People cooking for one, you'll love this recipe because you don't need a fridge full to put it together.

I followed other reviewers advice and sautéed my mushrooms in olive oil with half of a small white onion thinly sliced, 2 cloves of garlic minced and some salt and pepper. Added those to a baking dish after they were softened a bit. Ended up using more butter than called for, the bread crumbs soaked up most of the butter. 20 minutes after being in the oven I added shredded Monetary Jack cheese cooked for 15 more mins then broiled the last 3 mins of cooking. Chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Definitely making again

My son is  picky and not a big fan of chicken,but after he ate this dish he asked if I could make this every day?!  Since I'm not a big fan of chicken breast I used skinless/ boneless chicken thighs. Most definitely will make it again.

I made this for my girls ages 67  and 95 and they thought it needed a kick.   I followed the recipe and agree it needs something, but, I don't think you should make 5 or 6 changes and then say you "made the recipe" because you didn't.   Anyway, I will make it again and experiment  with it.  Tasted pretty good right off the page, though.

I will make this again.  I actually cooked 4 times the amount of chicken for a large group.  I also added an extra 1/4 c of chicken broth since there was so much extra chicken on two shallow cookie sheets.  This recipe is very simple and the flavor is great.  I heard several compliments!

I added some salt and pepper to the bread crumbs as indicated in other reviews, yet still found the dish to be tender and moist but rather bland.  The cheese didn't add much other than a nice, gooey topping.

This was an excellent recipe! Followed it exactly and everyone LOVED it!! I might be tempted to add carmelized onions and maybe artichoke hearts, just for some additional "veggies"!! It was quick and easy and darned good!! THANKS for a new quick go to meal!

OMG it was awesome.  Everyone loves it.  I doubled the recipe so there was leftovers and the chicken was still moist when heated in the microwave.  I'm so going to make it again.

I used portabella mushrooms and 5 breasts and deli sliced mozzarella cheese (Sargento). Cooking a little longer gave the cheese more of a crusty appearance. Served with baked sweet potatoes and steamed haricorts verts.  Made a very colorful meal.

I tried this recipe and followed some of the suggestions from others like adding  a can of cream of mushroom, sauteed mushrooms in garlic and olive oil first, and add mozzarella cheese on the last 10 mins of baking.  I also mixed the chicken broth and can of mushroom before pouring it into the pan.  This is DELICIOUS!  This is my family's new favorite! I also had my friends taste it when they came over one time and they loved it! Thank you for sharing your recipe. ?

I didn't make any changes other than using a can of mushroom soups like others and using MontereyJack with hot peppers cheese just because our Tanzanian family likes heat.  It was excellent and a real surprise for them.   Now they ask for it whenever we see them.

This dish was exceptional, exactly the way it is described.  To kick it up even more (a notch), I will do as some of the other reviewers suggested and add the mushroom soup.

I used seasoned Panko crumbs, cooked the mushrooms and added a thinly sliced shallot to the mushrooms while they were sautéing.  We loved this dish.  Easy but tasty.

Tasted great!  I used plain panko bread crumbs and seasoned them.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Tip:  Pound the breasts so they are all the same thickness.

Yum Yum! Very easy recipe to make.  I made a few small change. like others suggested I added a I/2c cream of mushroom soup, 8 oz cheese shredded and 2 cups of homemade chicken broth. Otherwise all other ingredients were the same.  my daughter and husband loved that I could make a different kind of chicken.

This was delicious and fairly easy! I had to alter some stuff as per preference and to increases servings. So I took some of the pp's advice and cut the chicken into strips, but it was still a little too thick at the end so next time I will pound them as well. I marinated my chicken in Lawry's herb and wine marinade for 1 hour, along with some salt pepper, homemade Italian seasonings. Dipped it into egg/ egg whites mixture then into Parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs mixture, sautéed in butter to brown both sides as per recipe. Sautéed about 4 cups mushrooms in olive oil, added half an onions s 3 cloves of garlic once the water receded, added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and parsley. Then added 2 cups of chicken brother and a can of mushroom soup to the mushroom mixture and let cook for a min or two. Added it all to baking dish and placed brown chicken in mushroom

This is great and I will definitely make it again.   I thought that I had mozzarella in the fridge but it turned out to be provolone  and it was too late to go to the grocery store so I used the provolone.  It was awesome so now I know that I can make this recipe with either cheese and it will be fantastic.

Made this using some of the other reviewers suggestions.  I sautéed the mushrooms ahead of adding them to the pan with the chicken.  I also sautéed onions and garlic.  I sprinkled some spices onto the breaded chicken before placing into the oven.  After it was baked, I drained the liquid into a pan and made a roux to make gravy, and added it back to the chicken.  The cheese was added to the top of the chicken and  placed back into the oven for  a couple of minutes.  I served this over polenta with glazed carrots on the side.  Very good!  I think the only thing that I would do next time, is to add white wine to the chicken broth to the pan before placing into the oven.  I think that would add another depth of flavor.

This turned out pretty good. This is the second time I made it. I used tenderloin breasts instead of whole to reduce cook time. 30-35 minutes is NOT enough time. Family liked it. Will adjust for next time.

I have made this recipe several times over the last couple of years. My husband and I both love it. I prefer baby bella mushrooms but it is good with any white mushroom. The only difference from the original recipe is I use panko crumbs (personal preference) with 1/4 C. grated parmesan cheese. I wouldn't want to change anything else,  it's a wonderful recipe.

I am really happy with how this turned out at dinner tonight. I've made it once before exactly how the recipe was stated, and thought it was just "okay". This time, I followed some suggestions from reviewers and it came out so much better. These were the changes I made: sautéed the mushrooms with 2 cloves of garlic (minced) in a little olive oil, added a can of mushroom soup to the chicken broth, and i used fresh breadcrumbs with Italian seasonings. Served with angel hair pasta and salad. I will absolutely be making this again!

This recipe was delish. The only changes i made were 1. I saulted the mushrooms. 2. I added garlic powder, seasoning salt, pepper to the Italian bread crumbs. I will make this recipe again. Thanks:)

This was a delicious, moist chicken dinner.  I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed my mushrooms first.  I also added half an onion sliced thick simply because it needed to be used up. In addition, I added a can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup (one can) mixed with water to deglaze my pan.  Using soup, I did not feel the need to thicken up the gravy.  I served with egg noodles and broccoli.

I followed the other recommendations.   Sautéed my mushrooms in the butter then added garlic. I reserved all of them to a bowl, seasons my cutlets with salt, black pepper and poultry season.  Then dip in the egg, bread crumbs and fry
I basted my pan with 1/2! Of mushrooms topped with fresh spinach,  seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic, placed chicken on top, laced a slice of Munster cheese on the cutlets added the broth and baked accordingly. Have to try. absolutely delicious!  will mak again

Great recipe - I made this for my boyfriend and then again two days later for my kids...it was great!  I sauteed the mushrooms ahead of time and added a can of mushroom soup.  I also punded the chicken to make it into thin cutlets.   I may try it next time without the soup - I think either way would be delicious.   Thanks!

Delish!!!  Chicken was very tasty and super moist.   I forgot the mozzarella cheese at the store. But I had sliced smoked Gouda on hand. So I substituted the Gouda for the mozzarella. This recipe will become a regular in our household.

This could be such a great recipe if there was flavor. It was so bland, really the only thing that gave it flavor was the cheese. This has so much potential

Nicely done. The ratio of breadcrumbs to meat was wasteful. I'm sure you could get away with half as much and use one egg and still coat everything ok.

This is a GREAT recipie!! I added starch to make gravy for the rice. Also added cooked the chicken in olive oil as opposed to butter (added a little butter to taste). Also added 1/2 cup of Marsala wine and used only a mix of fresh mushrooms I prepare in advance and freeze for use in several Recipies. I used Low sodium chicken stock from the jar by "Better than Buoullion". We absolutely loved it and it was EASY to make.

This was awesome I made it almost exactly as written the only tiny change I made was I added the cheese during the last five minutes of cooking as some of the other reviewers mentioned doing. So easy to make and took no time at all. Restaurant quality. Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good. You can use less mushrooms if you choose; make sure there's a layer under the chicken otherwise your breaking will get soggy from the broth.

This was so freaking awesome! I used Panko seasoned with garlic salt and Italian seasoning, but other than that made no changes. Served over brown rice, which was done at the same time as the chicken and I started it first! This one is a keeper for sure.

Everyone in my family loved this meal! I also sautéed the mushrooms ahead of time and added one can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  Also, I used chicken tender strips and made enough for leftovers...which were quite good heated up in the oven. I served the chicken with mini spaghetti noodles and peas...which you can mix all together if u want. I would definitely make this meal again!

I had chicken thighs not breasts so I had to adjust the cooking time. For thighs it will need about 1 hour to get cooked through. I also didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I added poultry seasoning, thyme, Italian seasoning amd seasoning salt to my regular bread crumbs. This recipe was very tasty although with the broth poured in it made the crumbs on the bottom of the chicken a bit mushy. Next time I will put the chicken on a rack and pour the broth into the bottom of the pan. This way I can enjoy those yummy mushrooms but keep the crispiness of the chicken.

This was very good and easy to make.  I didn't make any changes, except to use Monterey Jack cheese because I didn't have any motzarella.  Will certainly make this again.

I made this for the first time tonight. 

I took the advice from some of the other comments and sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and 1 clove of fresh garlic.
I used 1 egg only and added some herbs to the crumbs (Greek  Seasoning, Parsley Flakes, Rosemary and ground Oregano).
I mixed 1 tin of Cream of Mushroom and 1/2 cup of stock.
I cooked covered in foil and then topped with Shredded Mozzeralla and finished off under the grill.
I served on a bed of creamy Mash with a large serve of broccili.
Chicken was lovely and moist... heaps of flavour... yum!!
Hubby raved about it!

This was delicious! I halved the recipe, and made it gluten free by subbing in almond flour (with garlic powder and Italian seasoning) for the breadcrumbs. It was pretty soupy, I should have thickened the sauce. Still, it was loved! I served it with roasted potatoes and a salad. My husband said, "This is a 'go-to' meal", as in something we know will be good.

This tasted perfect without the cheese.  I will definitely cook it again, and might try the cheese.  Maybe for a heavier meal.  I served it over rice, and I think over noodles would be great as well.

This is one of the best Chicken recipes I have ever made. I added more mushrooms and broth. I was worried it would be to dry with such a small amount. It turned out so tender and juicy I was able to make a gravy out of the broth too. Kudos!

Amazing!! I added a can of cream of chicken mushroom soup like some did and it turned out great! Side note, it might need some bacon next time and I might try shredded cheese, the sliced cheese did seem a little runny. I loved it though, perfect for this pregnant momma!

I made this twice now, turned out better the first time but was still awesome. I ate it as leftovers and they were just as good. I added some seasoning to the bread crumbs before I rolled the chicken. I added some garlic to the milk mixture.

this was delicious! I used Italian bread crumbs and added salt, pepper and oregano to the bread crumbs. mixed the chicken stock with a can of cream of mushroom soup like another reviewer suggested and it turned out awesome! very flavorful and so easy to make! I served it over brown rice and added a dash of soy sauce at the end. (I forgot to add the cheese but it was just fine without it)

Made this last night for dinner.  I did what others suggested and sauted the mushrooms in butter with a little garlic and salt  first .  I used the amount of mushrooms called for but  they did not look like much so I put them all on the bottom of the pan.  Browned the chicken in the same pan as the mushrooms, deglazed the pan with the chicken broth to be sure to get as much mushroom flavor as possible, and poured over and around the chicken.  Cooked for about 25 minutes, then added the cheese and cooked for 5 minutes more.  Removed the chicken and thickened the very thin sauce with a small amount of cornstarch to give it some body, and added some salt.   Served the sauce separately in a bowl.  The chicken was tender, and the flavor was fine if not exciting.  This would be a good weekday meal (served with rice and steamed asparagus) as it was on the table, start to finish, in 45 minutes.

Wow.  If you want a wonderful dinner make this.  I did learn from the others though, and taking their advice I fried the mushrooms and put the cheese on for the last 5 min.  It is
my husband's favourite and this is his second request, so I just had to write this.  I have used both rice and pasta as a side, both work great!  Enjoy......it is worth making.

Loved this! Also made some changes: Sautéed the Baby Bella Shrooms with garlic in oil (and a little bacon grease!) Split my chicken breasts in half, and used home made beef broth. I also used smoked gouda...WOW!!!! AWESOME!!

Excellent! I did alter slightly. Instead of breadcrumbs, I used flour/parmesan/seasoning salt/pepper combo that I generally use for fried chicken. After browning breasts, I saute'd mushrooms and onions in the pan and added chicken broth, seasonings and a splash of heavy cream. Served with peas and skillet new potatoes. The entire family's plates were licked clean!

This recipe was good, however from the beginning I could tell it was going to need some love, i.e. flavor!
I added salt and pepper and some other spices like garlic powder and parsley. I also added white wine to the broth. 
It turned out really good this way and juicy!

Delicious!  As other reviewers noted, I did saute  the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoons butter, and a clove of garlic before continuing with the recipe.    That however, is the only change I made.  I don't understand why anyone would use canned soup to make a sauce!  The ingridents listed make a pure, delicious sauce!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had portabello mushrooms to use up and this was a great way to do so. The meatiness of the portabellos really lent to the recipe. I found that I needed more butter than the recipe called for when browning the chicken. I also added a little olive oil to reduce the smoking / scorching temp. I will definitely be making this agin

My favorite chicken dish!  I've made this 4 times now & delicious every time.   I followed the recipe as written the first time.  Was great!  The next 3 times I added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs as suggested by other reviewers.  We love portobello mushrooms, so I used 16 ounces of those.  (Sauteed them first.)  I was somewhat leery the first time of adding the chicken broth to the dish, but found that it makes the chicken very moist.  I actually look forward to making this and feel confident when serving company.  Thank you Kimpat!

This recipe is just delicious.  We had some provolone and horseradish cheddar slices, so we used those up instead of buying mozzarella, but I'm sure any white cheese would be fine.  Chicken was juicy and delicious!

Very simple yet, perfect balance between chicken, shrooms, and cheese.  I did not have bread crumbs,  so I crushed some cornflakes.  I also covered it for half the cooking time just to keep mushrooms from shriveling.

As is, I give this recipe three stars. I think it's a decent base recipe to take and tweak to your preferences. Prepared strictly by the recipe, it's pretty bland and ho-hum. I tried it again, adding a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added oregano and rosemary to the breadcrumb mixture.

I am a terrible cook. I eat bland food and I'm fine with it. However, my fiance isn't as okay with it haha So, I wanted to spice up some regular chicken breast in a way that is not carb heavy. We both love grilled mushrooms. So, I was like hmmm let's search for a chicken and mushroom recipe. I looked through the ratings and recommendations for this one and followed some of you expert cooker's advice and this is what I did...

**sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce 
**browned both sides of chicken in the oil leftover from the mushrooms
**added salt and pepper to beaten eggs
**used garlic & herb bread crumbs + oregano + rosemary
**dipped chicken in eggs + breadcrumbs
**spread mushrooms, chicken broth, and cream of mushroom in pan
**put chicken on top of mushrooms
**bake for 30 mins
**add mozzy cheese on top
**bake for 5 more mins

My boyfriend loved it!! Yay me! and Yay to you expert cookers who made the recommendations!!

Awesome...few ingredients, easy prep, and incredibly tasty!  Have had passion for cooking for 20+ years, Bon Appetite mag was my go to.  Their recipes were/are the best, but time consuming, and crazy amount of ingreds. This tasted just as good, but in a pinch.  My kids don't like mushrooms, I love them. Mushroom slices placed on bottom, got the great flavor, but kept the mushrooms to myself = everyone is happy. TY to contributor : )

This was pretty good. I made a couple of minor changes based on what I had and other reviews. I didn't use breadcrumbs and skipped the browning step. I sautéed the mushrooms in butter and added can of mushroom soup to the broth. I also used muenster cheese because that's what I had. We served it over egg noodles. Will make again!

Great recipe. I thought it would be too much like regular breaded chicken but was pleasantly surprised. The broth kept the chicken moist and with the mushrooms on the bottom it wasn't all soggy. I cooked my mushrooms beforehand with a clove of garlic since I like sautéed mushrooms. For my family members that don't like mushrooms, I put baby carrots under the chicken and that worked well. Will be making it again soon.

My house full of athletic young men loved this. I read all the reviews, and did the following
•	9 pieces of chicken breast halves, pounded down to 1/3 inch
•	Sauted a 2 cup measuring cup of chopped onions, about 5 garlic cloves minced, about 6 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and a whole long package of mini bella mushrooms from Costco 
•	Used 6 eggs beaten; about 3 cups Panko crumbs, ¾ cup parmesan, a little pepper, freshly grated Italian seasoning (no need to add salt, since there is enough in the mushroom soup)
•	Browned chicken in butter, but had to add some extra olive oil because the panko kept soaking up the liquid
•	Used a carton of Campbell’s Harvest Mushroom with White Wine soup because it is low in milk products for my lactose sensitive family, adding enough vegetable broth to make 3 cups
•	Chicken took about 45 minutes to bake; when temperature of the chicken was around 160 degrees, added a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella grated cheese and baked another 5 minutes (less cheese for the lactose sensitive, and healthier for the rest of us)
•	Served over angel hair pasta and with a side of steamed beans and carrots dressed with margarine and freshly grated nutmeg

This was full of flavour, very tender chicken, and will definitely be made again. Maybe for company sometime.

This was very good! I used a mediterranean seasoning blend with 2T butter on my panko bread crumbs, I used one pint of baby bella and one pint of white button mushroom and  sauteed my mushrooms with butter, salt, pepper and a clove of garlic and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth as the other reviewers suggested. It was very delicious i served over buttered egg noodles with green beans and croissants. Next time I will double the sauce everyone loved this recipe

I significantly modified the recipe ... but used it as a base.  I added organic cream of mushroom soup.  Omitted the cheese and added fried onions to the top.  
We loved it.  
Served it with green beans almondine and a rice medley. 
A not much trouble meal with a great result.

This was a great recipe!  I made very few adjustments but followed the advice of some of the reviewers and sautéed the mushrooms with a bit of garlic and butter.  Used garlic breadcrumbs and pounded the chicken breast thinner before breading them.  I did not add cornstarch to the juice but I will next time!  The chicken was moist and flavorful with a bit of crunch.  All my family enjoyed it!

I made this with a number of the changes suggested by other reviewers- I doubled the mushrooms and sautéed them in butter and garlic. Then I deglazed the pan with white wine and added a can of golden mushroom soup and the water. I simmered the mixture until the soup was absorbed and poured into the baking dish.  I used Panko crumbs and added salt, pepper and other spices before I coated the chicken, and also salt and peppered the chicken. Then I placed the browned chicken breasts on top of the mixture and baked. I added a slice of Gouda cheese on each chicken breast 5 minutes before it was done (it was all the cheese I had in hand). My husband LOVED it and he is not a fan of "saucy" dishes. He had 3 helpings and asked me make sure I made this again. My picky kids even ate it. Really delicious!

This recipe is one of the very few ways my husband will eat chicken. The only change I made was to saute the mushrooms first in olive oil and garlic. Don't skimp on the mushrooms either!

I made this a few months ago and thought I was going to die of a heart attack....my kids ate everything I gave them and asked for MORE.  I'm going to make it again tomorrow and I'll add a can of mushroom soup to make it a little thicker and maybe some red pepper. Spicy food is great in cold weather! This time i'll try to get a picture before it disappears.

: this works great pork chops too!!

I made this exactly as it was presented, but I don't think I'll be making it again.I agree that it made a mushy and bland mess. It could be improved upon like others have suggested, but I'll just be looking for another chicken and mushroom recipe. Sorry.

Very easy, incredibly moist, and flavorful. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used matzoh meal. I added oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper since the matzoh meal was bland. I also added about 1/4 cup of wine wine to the broth in place of 1/4 cup of broth. You won't want all of the chicken covered in broth so don't overdo it. I've been looking for an easy and healthy go to chicken recipe. This is excellent. My family agrees.

Wasn't bad. Made according to recipe except sauteed mushrooms in a teaspoon of minced garlic and butter  first served with scallop potatoes. Also next time will use more mushrooms and less broth just enough broth to cover bottom of pan and a can of cream of mushroom soup.

I made this last night and it was really good. I was reading other reviews this morning and will definitely add cream of mushroom next time. We ate this with pasta and the pasta was a little bland, but I'm sure the mushroom soup will help with that.

This dish is super easy. I seasoned the breadcrumbs and mushrooms with garlic and onion powder first and sautéed my mushrooms before baking.

Loved it! So easy to make and delicious. I skipped browning the chicken in butter to save time and calories. My chicken took longer than the recipe stated to cook and the cheese  browned up a bit. Next time I will try using thinner pieces of chicken or adding the cheese halfway through cooking.

The chicken was moist, but I would not make it again. The mushrooms were quite dry and the cheese added nothing to the taste. Not even a pretty presentation when it comes out of the oven.

I converted this to a crock pot version with wild rice and added a little white wine.  Family loved it.  Will be making it often this winter.

I made 2 changes to this recipe.  The first was on acc ident... I did not egg and bread crumb the chicken, I just coated them in flour because I didn't read closely. The second change I made was to sauté the mushrooms with garlic in the pan after I removed the chicken. I then deglazed the pan with White wine before adding the chicken broth.  In hindsight I probably should have reduced the mixture further before pouring over the chicken but it wasn't bad, just thin.   The broth kept the chicken nice and moist while finishing in the oven and the cheese got nice and crusty (in a good way).  The whole family loved this but I have to say for those looking for an extra something, it's the white wine that took this meal up a notch.

Tasted good, I had to cook for another 10mins. At the end I also poured the broth and some mushrooms in a pan, added brown mustard, sweet vermouth and a little corn starch and made a gravy for the mash potatoes we had it with.

Made it almost exactly as written. Did sauté canned mushroom pieces in butter/garlic first. Added a little grated parmesan on top of the mozzarella and waited until the last 5 minutes to add the cheese. Pulled the chicken to rest when it was done and added another 1/4 cup of chicken broth (made from bullion cube) mixed with a few tablespoons of corn starch back to the pan of juices and put it back in the oven for a few minutes until it was thick. Gravy was great WITHOUT adding canned soup. Served it with garlic buttered egg noodles to go with the gravy. Hubby loved it! 
This will be my way to make chicken and mushrooms from now on. The chicken broth and breading really helped, thanks for a good recipe!

Wow, this is good and definitely would make a great company dish!  I read the other reviews because they usually offer such good advice/changes.  Therefore, I changed the recipe.  So, I sauteed 1/2 of  a chopped onion, fresh mushrooms, and 2 cloves minced garlic for about 10 minutes (I added the garlic towards the end) and put it in the pan.   I used Ital. seasoned crumbs and browned the chicken like the recipe called for in step 3.   I added 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp Bell's to the broth (step 3).   Since I was using thin sliced breasts, I only cooked the chicken in the oven for 15 minutes.   I did use shredded mozzarella on top and it worked out fine.  I will make this again and again!

Bland. Mushrooms on bottom did nothing since they just got left in the broth of the pan. Did saute mushrooms first which made them very nice.

This is the best chicken dish I have made in years!  I added the chicken broth to the frying pan and whisked up all the deliciousness in the pan.  Then I poured it gingerly over the chicken, mushrooms and cheese and it was quite the gourmet dinner. I will be serving that at upcoming holiday dinners!

I made it tonight.  Would not change a thing about the recipe!  My addition is in the Side to complement it! I used all fresh mushrooms, not sautéing, just layering and topping.  (I did add the cheese in the last fifteen minutes...so guess I DID change a thing)

As a side,  my husband made a mixture of Olive Oil, 1 tbs butter, little oregano, black pepper and 1/4 cup of wine, then tossed fresh linguine in that in a skillet, topped off by a little parmesan.  We cut the chicken up and slightly tossed into the linguine, was perfect!  Next time, I may add some artichoke hearts and capers.

I hate to compare a recipe to a restaurant, but what I had would have been Macaroni Grill's Chicken Scallopini!  Just needed the capers, artichoke and prosciutto in the linguine.  The chicken was superb!

PS:  While I'm sure the cream of mushroom addition was not bad, but I think it would take away from the real flavor meant by this great recipe!

Thanks for the weekly addition to my cooking!

PSS:  I think all the photos everyone has made look great!  They all add a different take and they ALL look great!!

I read the reviews and added more "sauce" with a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of chicken soup. I sautéed the mushrooms. I didn't have fresh garlic or onion but that might have helped and did add seasoned salt and lemon pepper. Still bland so I think kick up the spices more. If I had fresh lemons and squeezed them on each serving, THAT would have made all the difference.

this is a great and super easy dish. I added garlic, because that is what I do for almost everything! I also let my chicken bathe in the egg for a bit longer. clean up is 1-2-3

Really tasty, and my kids ate every bite!  Like others recommended, I sautéed the mushrooms first (with some garlic and olive oil), and also added additional seasoning to the bread crumbs (salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried rosemary, dried basil, and dried thyme).

Made this last night and it was delicious. Only change I made was to use low sodium chicken broth.  The sauce was smooth and full of flavor. Will definitely make this again. For heart health I will switch the butter out for olive oil

We love mushrooms!! Well, except for my daughter, but even she devoured this chicken!  I did follow others' advice and doubled &  sautéed cremini mushrooms first before placing mushrooms in pot below and above the chicken.  To the broth I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. This supplied us with a lovely mushroom gravy.  I also tripled the garlic.   
Now, I know the recipe says chicken is ready in roughly 30 min but I got sidetracked with the kids & homework  and despite the fact that it was in the oven for about  70 -80 min before I  placed the cheese on top to melt it still fell apart and was easily cut with a fork! 

Definitely a keeper.  Next time I will add even more mushrooms!  Next time i'll take a picture

I used baby portabellas.  I cooked it in a microwave convection oven @ 350 for 45 with foil cover, then another 20 min uncovered.  The breasts were super moist.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was delicious, but I did make a couple of changes. I was going to use chicken as directed but I realized that my chicken bag was punctured so I subbed with pork. I also didn't have mozzarella so I subbed parmesan. Added a little bit of half and half rather than cream of mushroom. Really yummy! Next time I will make as directed if I can.

I love this recipe and the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made some modification s suggested by the other reviewers.  I sautéed the mushrooms in butter with garlic and I fried the chicken with garlic also.  For everything else, I followed the recipe exactly.  Really a wonderful recipe.  Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My whole family loved it! I did not have chicken broth so I used the chicken flavor packet from Ramen noodles and mixed it with 3/4 cup hot water before pouring it over the pan. I also did not have sliced mozz cheese so I used fat free shredded mozz instead. The chicken was so juicy and delicious.

Loved this recipe, would definitely make it again and again. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. The only change I made was as others suggested and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth and increased the chicken broth from 3/4 to 1 cup.  I did not saute the mushrooms as others suggested and it came out GREAT!

Very easy to make.  I did modify a bit: sautéed the mushrooms for a minute in butter and garlic and used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Came out delicious and chicken was tender.

I used legs instead of thighs, I bet that is the reason that it wasn't as good as the other reviews. I'm hesitant to make it again though because I didn't really enjoy the flavor.

This is definitely a keeper!  I used other's suggestions - sautéed the mushrooms with garlic and onions.  This will become a staple only house!  Dinner was on the table in 45 minutes.

Tried this recipe the other night for dinner.     The family loved it.   Gave it to my mother tonight,  she is looking forward to trying it.  The next time we make it I am going to try to season the chicken up  a little bit more it could use a little flavoring.  Also think I will add a little Marsala  to it..

This was delicious...had to force myself to eat only 1 piece of chicken! I did make some adjustments: sautéed the mushrooms in butter; pounded each breast half to flatten slightly for even cooking; dredged the chicken in flour before dipping in egg; used Panko bread crumbs because they brown so nicely; added some olive oil to the pan for browning; seasoned the bread crumbs with salt, pepper & course ground garlic;  mixed about 2/3 c chicken broth into a can of mushroom soup; topped chicken with mushrooms; used cheese slices that are a combination of mozzarella/provolone; spooned the soup mixture over the top. Also I baked for 45 min. Turned out PERFECT!

I did saute the mushrooms with a chopped onion and garlic first and added a little sage and onion stuffing to the bread crumbs.  We really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.

The best baked chicken I have ever done.  It was so moist & so easy.  I wondered about the mozzarella cheese getting too runny but it didn't & formed a very slight crust...kinda the way it does on pizza.  I'm glad I put it on top.  I do believe the chicken broth is what helped it to stay so moist. I don't like covered up taste & glad it didn't call for a cream soup.  Wonderful, wonderful!

This dish is very simple to make and it is really good. I will definitely add it to my quick meals. I put the chicken on a bed of rice and steamed some green beans and I had everything ready within 45 minutes.

This recipe was mediocre at best.  I even did the extra tips to add more flavor and it did not help.  I am a retired caterer and a pretty good judge of successful dishes.  I would not recommend this recipe.

It actually tasted really good, the problem is is that it dries out in the middle of the chicken. The timing is a little too long to work for a boneless chicken.

Made this tonight. Came out well, just a tad bland. I did what a few others did and added the cream of mushroom and had it with some pasta.  Added some salt and pepper and the bland went away .....

Great, easy dish, my family loved it served over hot, buttered noodles. I used extra fresh mushrooms and  chicken gravy with a little red wine instead of the broth for a nice thick sauce.

This is a keeper.  I did some suggestions: sauteed the mushrooms and added cream of mushroom soup (husband likes potatoes and mushroom gravy) .  I used both fresh and canned mushrooms, since I didn't have enough fresh.  I also discovered that I didn't have mozzerella, but I did have Muenster, which I put on first, then poured soup/gravy over it before putting in oven...it still worked!  This was very good and moist. Great recipe...very versatile, which is what I like!!!

Fabulous and easy recipe!  The only thing I changed was the cheese.  I used provolone instead of mozzarella as it has more flavour.  Thank you for a great recipe!

My family loved it! My grandsons cleaned their plates and they are 5 & 7, very picky! I was so happy, we all enjoyed it. I meant to take a picture of it to add and probably will if there is any left when I get home because it was not much left last night. Thanks Allrecipes!!!

"This is a keeper" so said my husband. I did saute the  mushrooms in butter & olive oil and added cream of mushroom soup (as suggested by other viewers) otherwise I followed the recipe. It's great to have another easy chicken dish  to fall back on

Loved It!  After reading the reviews I also added the cream of mushroom soup with the chicken broth blended in it.  Seasoned up the Italian breadcrumbs with a dash of garlic powder and 1/4 cup grated parm.  Partially cooked the sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Served it over egg noodles with fresh steamed broccoli on the side.  Will definately make this again.  Thank you for this recipe.

Wow! Yummy. I will make this many more times. Something I will serve at dinner parties! My husband commented on it several times. The only thing I did in addition was adding a few slices of tomatoes around the pan. Since this is tomato season, my garden is producing over time so I add tomatoes to anything I can. Instead of rice or noodles I did small portions of cheese tortellini and garlic toast. It was gone before I could take pictures.

I fried mushrooms first, then chicken, then dish.
GOOD EASY I would make again. Easy for company dinner,
or K's  Could easily add a little flavor next time, that would make it a 5.

A wonderful recipe!  I followed the suggestion to pound the chicken breasts thin. The chicken broth made the dish very moist. My husband loved it as he likes meals with a sauce.  I served it with rice and cranberry sauce. A winner!

4 stars for easy/tasty! but mushrooms love sherry and some thyme when they get sauteed...also a trick I've been using - add a small (2tbls) bit of neufchatel cheese to thicken the sauce - it does the same thing as heavy cream but guilt free.

This was good and easy, too. I refuse to use canned soup (have you read the label??), so I made my own from a recipe on this site. I like the extra sauce that made. I'll make this again. I also added onions and garlic to my mushrooms and used several varieties of 'shrooms. 
FYI this site has recipes for cream of "just about anything" soup. They are so fresh and delicious. Please try them instead of canned soup.

First, 40 min total cook time for boneless, skinless breasts is over the top time wise, and likely to result in dried out, tough meat.  I've dredged the breasts in seasoned (oregano, basil, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika) flour, egg bath, seasoned (same) bread crumbs, then browned them at a higher heat approx. 3 min per side, sautéed the mushrooms in a balsamic vinaigrette, and in a shallow greased pan, placed chicken, topped with mushrooms, then cheese and baked at 375 for 20 - 25 min or until juices are clear.  YUMMY  If you have chicken broth in your baking dish, how on earth are you supposed to know if your juices are running clear?  The broth would have become polluted with eroded breading from bottom of chicken and the melted cheese as well.

This was really *really* good.  Not knock your socks off, but man it sure stands up there with those good old fashioned comfort food kinda meals.  We will be putting this on our weekly rotation  for sure.  I only used 1 chicken breast that I butterflied and then quartered (used a middling size pan - I think it's probably around 8x10 or so).  Made a mixture of cream/mushroom soup and chicken broth, then added the mushrooms (sauteed in olive oil with a little garlic), and then the seared breaded chicken breasts.  Mine only had to cook about 20 minutes or so (added the cheese on during the last 10 minutes).  I was worried that the chicken would turn out dry as it was just sitting there above the sauce, but it was wonderfully moist!  I was also a little put off by added mozzarella cheese, but again - it worked wonderfully with the chicken.  Served over steamed rice along with creamed corn (AR recipe Cream Corn Like No Other).  We were both really quite pleased.  Thank you so much for recipe!

Prep time was short and the end result was delicious!  My husband's favorite.  MUST add cream of mushroom soup.  Perfect!

It was a very quick and easy dish to prepare and it tasted lovely . The whole family loved it but you have to be generous with the cheese!!!!! I did make some changes - I sautéed the mushrooms before adding and I added strips of bacon on top. That added some extra zing to it.

Yum!!! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a whole onion chopped into large chunks. I laid the onion out in the same way as the mushrooms. I also added a fifth chicken breast because that's what I had on hand. Once it was done, I laid it on top of a bed of macaroni shells. It was really a hit with my husband, too!

This was good and fairly simple to make. I did incorporate a lot of the suggestions the other reviews mentioned. Next time I would add more garlic and maybe something to give it a little spice.

I made this for the first time today.  My husband and I loved it!  I used frozen sliced mushrooms which I thawed out while I prepared the chicken.  I also used shredded mozzarella.  After baking in the oven, there was a lot of juicy liquid in the baking pan. So I made a simple pan sauce with it and spooned it over the chicken.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband is a super, super picky eater and he loved this dish - he gets weirded out by textures and flavors -- doesn't like things over seasoned or bland.  I used chicken breast tenderloins and found that after browning the meat in the pan I only needed to bake it for just over 20 minutes -- the meat came out very tender and juicy.  If you hate dry meat this is a great recipe to try. I removed the stems from my mushrooms to avoid any tough texture and sliced them ultra thin -- and I used shredded cheese instead of sliced.  It came out great.  I served it with rice pilaf and steamed veggies.  Husband liked it so much he asked me to make it again next week.

I thought this was great.  So simple and quick.   The chicken came out nice a moist.   I did use 'baby bella' mushrooms and I used more than the recipe calls for.   But other than that, I kept it the same.

This recipe is oK as is. Unfortunately it needs more flavor. I like eating things low in salt but this one was on the vecinity of bland. If you are using a large egg, it will be more than enough if your breasts are not huge. I also figured that I did not need the full cup of bread crumbs. Consider to use half a cup if your breasts are not huge. Next time I would definitely add some garlic,salt and pepper to bring a bit of flavor and may probably use LESS of the chicken broth as the mushrooms do shed a lot of water in the cooking process. I believe 1/4 cup of broth would have been enough. I will give it a try again with the suggestions from others and with my own aforementioned ones, but I would say that it is not terribly bad. It is a good recipe that can be improved with a few things. It is moist very moist and that is more than a plus when baking chicken breasts uncovered!

I made this the other night and followed the recipe making only the slightest change to make it gluten free.  I used a gluten free coating for the breading on the chicken.  I thought this was great and will certainly make it again!

Two thumbs up!  Used plain panko breading, so I threw some McCormicks original chicken seasoning on the chicken, also added some fresh garlic cloves (never wrong) to the broth (Made with cube of chicken broth and hot water).  And used canned mushrooms.  Nonetheless, this dish is a winner!  Chicken was moist and delicious, mushrooms extra yummy!    Ate it with Potatoes and frozen broccoli.  Hubby is taking it to work tomorrow, so I know he liked it

WOW!  So easy and absolutely delicious.  My adjustments: instead of chicken broth, I used a 1/2 cup of white wine.  I added a chopped sweet onion to the mushrooms and a pinch of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper for some flavor.  Marinated the chicken overnight to seal in extra flavor before the egg and breadcrumb mixture.  Baked for 30 minutes - came out perfect, juicy and full of flavor - will look forward to leftovers for dinner tomorrow!

Excellent.  Sauteed Onions and mushrooms first and put them in the bottom of the pan.  Turned the heat up to 425 for last 10 minutes to get the chicken nice and crispy.

SO delicious! I skipped the broth and just used a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a can of milk and it turned out moist. Added garlic and onion flakes when I sautéed the mushrooms prior to putting in the oven. I also preferred using Swiss cheese and Italian bread crumbs. Me and my family's new favorite!

Delicious and a huge hit with the family.  I took recommendations of sauteeing the mushrooms in butter, olive oil and garlic (along with herbes de provence) first and then added a half can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth.  Topped with a mixture of mozzarella and swiss.  Will definitely be on the dinner rotation.

Yum! I sautéed the mushrooms in garlic butter,  and mixed a can of cream of chicken soup and the broth in the bottom of the pan. I sliced chicken in half so it was thinner. I added salt and pepper to the eggs. I added a little less than 1/4 c paremesan cheese to the bread crumbs, plus oregano and basil. After browning chicken I added to the pan and topped with mushrooms. I added cheese after 30 min and let it melt in oven another 5-10.

So good!  I did change a bit, I added white wine to the chicken broth and put in the skillet and reduced a bit.  I also seasoned the chicken with Italian spices, salt and pepper and some garlic/herb seasoning.  Added some grated Parmesan cheese to the panko and garlic herb bread crumbs.  My daughter really liked it and said it reminded her of Parmesan chicken without the tomato sauce.  I will be making this one again.

GREAT comfort food! Sauteed the portabella mushrooms with an onion before adding to the dish. Breaded the pounded chicken breasts with salt, pepper and salt added to the bread crumbs. Doubled the chicken broth as I deglazed the pan so that I had enough broth for the rice that I served this with and then topped with mozzarella cheese at the end just to melt the cheese. Yumm!!

Good taste. Followed the recipe. Chicken came out so soft and moist. Put it in oven for 40 min just to ensure that it cooked all the way. Next time I'll probably sauté mushroom just to give it a little more flavor. But overall, simple recipe, good taste.

This was a very good recipe.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with the chicken broth, so it had a nice gravy instead of being soupy.  I used 4 of the small cans of mushrooms.  I wish I would have had some mashed potatoes to eat this with.

Really delicious and moist. Super easy to make, too. I wasn't sure whether or not to use fresh mushrooms or canned mushrooms... I went with the canned mushrooms that I drained. The hubs and I loved it and we still have more for dinner tonight!

AMAZING recipe that I will make again and again!

 I too, took the advice of others and sautéed mushrooms with olive oil and white wine.  After browning the chicken, I added the juice and wine from the mushrooms, and one can of creamy mushroom garlic  soup, and a half a cup of chicken broth. This gravy was amazing over white rice and I served it with  whole green beans.   Thank you for the great recipe!

I tried this but changed a few things, I added garlic to the skillet and saute then brown the chicken and use a whole can of chicken broth with 1 T of cornstarch, did  not add the mozzarella cheese...bake for 50 minutes and the broth made a gravy....my husband said it was a keeper....

Loved this recipe. Being it is just the wife and myself, and we are on a budget I took one breast and pounded it to make two. I took the mushrooms and put them in a pan with butter and garlic for 2 minutes. Lined the bottom with the mushrooms, put the chicken in the egg wash and seasoned bread crumbs to brown. Put the breast on the mushrooms topped with the other we sautéed and put Campbell's golden mushroom soup with half a can of white wine and shredded mozzarella cheese. Came out so moist, it is a keeper for sure.

I added garlic and sherry.  I made the broth with a cube, 1/2 C sherry, 1/2 C water.  I covered in sliced Munster cheese and served with mashed potatoes.

Made this for the first time tonight and although I felt that the cheese didn't add anything other than a nice look, my husband loved it!  I followed other reviewers suggestions to sauté my mushrooms first and added more than called for.  I thought they were the best part of the dish.  It took me 45 minutes just to get it in the oven, another 45 minutes for clean up and then about 35-40 minutes baking time as the breasts were very large.  I also added the cheese towards the end as well.  As I said, my husband loved it so I will make it again.

I tried the recipe & to me it was very bland. Next time I try this I'll add 2 cups chicken broth to 1 can mushroom soup. I will season chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic salt before breaking. Bake it all for 40 minutes & last 5 min., top with mozzarella.

This was tasty! I did add more broth than the recipe called for because my husband likes sauce. Thicken it up with butter/flour roux. I would add spices next time (garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper).  An onion would be good in this also.  I can't see adding the cream of mushroom soup as others have mentioned.

Made the recipe this evening, and as I never seem to leave a recipe as is, I added the can of cream of mushroom soup, and in addition to the fresh mushrooms I added French cut green beans.  Use an Italian blend cheese (what I had in house) turned out really well served it with mashed potatoes

This was beyond delicious the way I did it. I sautéed the mushrooms in butter, olive oil, Mrs Dash Herb and Garlic seasoning, and a drizzle of white cooking wine. Then to the bread crumbs I added grated parmesan and more  Mrs. Dash. Then, to the chicken broth I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a fourth cup of white cooking wine, a sprinkle of Mrs.Dash herb and garlic and lemon pepper seasoning. Then I sprinkled shredded Kraft 5 cheese shredded Italian cheese over everything. 40 minutes later, absolute perfection! I now have a new favorite meal.

This was AWESOME!  So easy to make and the family loved it.  Only thing I did different was cut the chicken into bite sized cubes, put it over egg noddles, and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top.  Delicious!

I made this last night after viewing what others were saying.  I did add cream of mushroom soup and used sliced munster cheese instead of mozzerella, I wished I had sauteed the mushrooms (a bit  watery) But once you make it you will know what you want to change to suit your taste. Great recipe and I will make this again, and again, and again. I think this would make a good recipe for company.

I had high hopes for this dish, but must agree with most other three star rating. It was bland with the garlic/onion addition. I will not make this again.

One of our family's favorites! Like some other reviews stated...sautee the mushrooms/garlic first, set aside then prepare the chicken in same pan. Also top with provolone or mozzarella in the last 5 minutes. I like to broil the cheese a bit too at the end. Great served with fettuccine!

This is really good.  I doubled the mushrooms and used Muenster cheese. It served 8 of us. My chicken breasts were very large so I pounded them, browned them, then cut them.  I also thickened the broth a little with flour.  I assembles it in the morning than added the cheese and baked it right before dinner.  

Whenever I make this, everyone raves, and it's so easy to prepare.

I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone LOVED it! I sautéed the mushrooms in butter before putting them on the bottom of the baking dish and over the chicken. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup, as the others did, and it tasted great! It's definitely a five-star recipe!:)

This recipe was a hit with my family! After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to season my chicken and sauté my mushrooms. Also, I used Pepperidge Farms seasoned stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. Can you say awesome??? Definitely saving this recipe. Just when I was starting to hate chicken, this recipe gave it life!

Every week I look on the site for a new dish to try out on my husband and his buddy. They really liked this one!! I did sauté the mushrooms and I threw leeks in that I had to get rid of. We just dipped the chicken in egg and then bread crumbs. No broth, it made it's own juice. Topped with cheese last five minutes. They thought it was the most flavorful and moist chicken. What a simple idea and tastes like you fussed. Thank you for posting.

Like many others, I too sautéed the mushrooms with olive oil, garlic and onions.  I also used Panko bread crumbs which I added several spices to.  Kosher Salt, Pepper, Few red pepper flakes for a punch, oregano and rosemary.  It was delicious!

We loved the flavor on this one!  We used italian seasoned bread crumbs, but I may just use Panko next time.  The chicken broth and the slightly fried chicken (definitely use real butter!) helped give the mushrooms a rich and buttery flavor.  The only slight variation that I made was to the cheese.  I couldn't get plain sliced mozzerella, so I used sliced mozz/provolone blend and it was fantastic!

Printed this recipe for my husband to make tonight. We needed a recipe for dinner and since my 2nd simultaneous rotator cuff repair my husband asked me to decide "what's for dinner". I read a few reviews and added that to the printed recipe, adding some rosemary and oregano and romano/garlic to the breading. Also added cream of mushroom soup to the broth. The mushrooms were already grilled as I buy in bulk & grill a pond or two & freeze them spread on  a cookie sheet. The chicken was moist & tasty. Easy recipe, we had all the ingredients, bonus!

Bland but idea is great.  I added onions and asparagus to the bottom mushroom layer along with a tblsp olive oil.  I also added seasonings to the breadcrumbs and beaten eggs.  To the chicken broth I first sautéed grated onion in butter then broth and half and half thickening with a flour roux adding mushroom remainder and chopped asparagus.  Was awesome

Very nice dish.  Instead of regular bread crumbs, I used Panko.  I sauted the mushrooms with a yellow onion and a large shallot.  I added tarragon and garlic powder to the Panko before breading the chicken breasts and then proceeded with the receipe except I didn't put any of the onion-mushroon mixture on top of the chicken when it went in to bake.  I think the next time I will pound the breasts to make them uniform in thickness.

This recipe for dinner hit the spot! I was a little scared that this would taste bland but I took suggestions from others to add a can of cream of mushroom. This tasted like restaurant quality food! I'll be sure to make it again soon!

This dish is great if you know what to modify. I didn't have any mushroom soup like the other reviewers suggested, so I dashed in a little soy sauce in at the end and it gave it so much delicious flavor! I also sautéed the mushrooms in organic butter and fresh pressed garlic before adding to the pan. I dipped the chicken in 2 parts egg, 1 part coconut creamer and then dipped it in 2 parts gluten free flour and 1 part dairy free parmesan cheese substitute seasoned with salt, pepper and italian spices. I served the chicken over brown rice, but I'm sure it would go great with quinoa too!

*If you want to go completely dairy free top with the dairy free parmesan instead of mozzarella. If you want to go completely gluten free/soy free, use Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce, but use much less as it has a stronger flavor than regular soy sauce. 

Happy Cooking!

This is a great recipe.  These are the changes I made:  I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and I used part finely crushed Ritz crackers and part seasoned breadcrumbs. I mixed about 1 T of Garlic Garlic (Tastefully Simple) & 1 T of Emeril's Original Essence into the breadcrumb/cracker mixture.  After the chicken was sauteed, I put the broth in the skillet to get all the browned bits into the pan. I used shredded Italian cheese mix because that was what was in my fridge. My DD and DH agreed that this was delicious!

I used cream of mushroom soup, garlic, wine and extra seasoning as others suggested.  I still found it very bland and not worth the time and effort.  Better and faster recipes are out there with chicken and mushrooms.

Pretty Tasty Dish! Most of the family liked this, my issue was that the bottom of the chicken was soggy. Not sure if I will make again, if I do I would definitely saute the mushrooms prior to putting in the oven, and add a bit more spice to get it a kick.

Easy and yummy.  Used more mushrooms than listed (2 boxes sliced).  Made lots of liquid for mashed potatoes.

Awesome!! After pouring over all the reviews I, like most people made some modifications.  I sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and garlic.  I used approximately 3/4 lb of sliced baby bells.  For the sauce, a can of cream of mushroom, 3/4 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup white wine. I did coat the chicken with seasoned bread crumbs adding a little italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I will probably skip this step next time as the breading didn't stick to the chicken and I don't think it really needs it.  I used legs as that was what I had on hand. It took about an hour to cook.  I also topped with mozzarella cheese about 10 mins before it was done.  The mozzarella was great but I would like to try provolone next time. I will also mix the pasta (penne) with the sauce beforehand and bake with the chicken.  We definitely will make this again!!!!! Thank you for the recipe and the tips from everyone!

The chicken turned out really tender, I got a lot of compliments on this dish. I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and added a whole sliced leek to the dish...tasted great.

I made this recipe but instead of using an egg, I marinated the chicken in some Ranch dressing and the panko bread crumbs stuck to that.  I also sautéed 2 cloves of garlic with the mushrooms before assembling this dish.  All in all a great and easy dish to prepare and it was good enough for company too.

Oh my! This was delish! I like the fact that I did NOT have to sauté mushrooms beforehand....and that it did NOT call for cream soup. I made it exactly as written, and it came out perfect. One of my favs from this site. So, into the rotation it goes, and thanks for this one!

Made as directed.  Very good and very easy.  I prefer to season plain bread crumbs rather than use the store bought seasoned bread crumbs (seasoned salt, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika).  The only change I will make the next time is rather than slicing mozzarella, I will use shredded.

My bf and I absolutely devoured this dish! I served this over whole wheat pasta with a garlic, olive oil, parsley, and a can of chopped tomatoes sauce. I also added a few spices to the breadcrumbs (italian seasoning, rosemary, oregano, and pepper). Before I put the mushrooms in the pan I sauteed them in garlic, white wine, and olive oil. I browned the chicken in the same pan. I also used a little bit of flour to make the chicken broth a little thicker. So delcious !

This recipe was awesome!  I was a little skeptical at first, but after one bite . . . Yum!  I used Shitake mushrooms and seasoned my own breadcrumbs.  Next time I may add a little white wine with the chicken broth.

I loved the flavor of this. I tweaked the recipe because the chicken breast at my store did not look good. So I used tenderloins. I used a mix of mushrooms - baby ports, shitake, and canned. I also had some shredded mozzarella that I needed to get used up so I used shredded cheese instead of slices.
But it still came out wonderful! My fiancee commented that it was excellent a few times. I will be making this one again!

I think if I followed the recipe exactly this recipe might have been lucky to get 2 or 3 stars, but I followed others' suggestions and it turned out pretty good for a quick easy dinner. Here's what I did:
- Sauteed the mushrooms in butter and olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper
- Microwave-steamed some green beens until just slightly tender
- Combined the mushrooms and green beans with a can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2c milk
- Put the veggies in sauce in the pan, topped them with some fried onions, and then added the sauteed chicken on top.
- Added cheese (I used monterey jack because it's what I had on hand) in the last 5 minutes of cooking

So basically this was green bean mushroom casserole topped with chicken! And it went over well with my family, even my 2yo ate a pretty good portion. With all my changes I think it could possibly earn 4 stars.

I read several reviews and punched up the flour dip with a half shake of cayenne, a half shake of garlic powder, and about 1 teaspoon of paprika (I scaled down for one portion, so do the math for your recipe).  Also, I got more flavor by browning the dipped chicken on one side, then ADDING the onions and mushrooms when I flipped it.  I baked the chicken alone, while I finished the veggies with three times the wine, and enought butter to smooth out the sauce, which I then poured on top of the chicken at serving time. It was yummy.

It was ok but there was nothing special in the taste  although I added cream of mushroom soup but the problem with this dish was that it was so runny and the chicken was swimming in the liquid, don't recomend it really.

I think this recipe needs something, it was a little boring to me but family LOVED it, hence the 4stars! Next time I will do what other reviewers did and tweek it a bit. I did sauté the mushrooms but used broth not cream of mushroom. Still needed something though!

Tried this recipe tonight as written. While the dish is an OK taste, I thought it needed something. I do think it has potential, maybe fresh herbs, no cheese, don't know. I think the photo is not representational of the dish.

I did sauté the mushrooms prior to the baking, adding garlic.  I think I might throw minute rice in at the end to soak up the juice.  Next time more garlic!

I cheated!!!  I used a packages coating mix.  Didn't brown in butter.  Simply put the chicken on top of mushrooms and followed the recipe. Chicken was soft and tender and mushrooms were delicious.  The chicken broth turned out to be a nice mushroom sauce.

I didn't change much, and it was really good. I left out the chicken broth, and added three cloves of garlic, sliced thin and sauteed, to the bottom layer of mushrooms. I took a can of mushroom soup and spooned it on top of the chicken so the mushrooms would stay. We had some shredded mozzerella, but not enough, so I made up the difference with grated parmesean. My wife raved about it. Keeper, easy!

This was just OK.  I used mushroom soup instead of broth.  It tasted good and helped me utilize the mushrooms and chicken that I had in the frig.  Something was lacking in taste, it was kind of bland.

Sort of bland as written.  I did not add the cram of mushroom soup as I felt the recipe is more elegant without it and did not want the additional calories.  Will probably play around with it as it is a good base.

Awesome chicken! For a little different taste, try sherry instead of white wine.  It goes great with the mushrooms.

This was pretty good. The chicken did turn out moist, as other people mentioned. I added the cream of mushroom to the broth, sauteed the mushrooms before baking, and used Jarlsburg instead of mozzarella. If I made this again, I would double the mushrooms (3 cups hardly looks like anything once they're cooked) and use a sharper cheese such as parmesan. I would say you only need the cream of mushroom if you plan to serve dinner with rice or noodles; otherwise all that sauce is superfluous. In fact, I think the meal would be more elegant without it.

Very nice recipe. I substituted red wine for chicken broth after cooking it the first time. This made it taste bait less "chicken-ie" and gave it that extra zest which really perked up an already good recipe.

This was very simple, yet extremely delicious!  I also made us salads, asparagas, fried zucchini, and egg noodles to accompany the chicken with mushrooms.  I still got everything done in about an hour!  I would make this recipe again!

This was fantastic! I sauteed the mushrooms in butter in my trusty cast iron pan (and completely forgot the garlic cloves - alas!) When the mushrooms were done, I just placed the breaded chicken on top of them in the pan, added some stock, and into the oven it went. I skipped the cheese and it was not missed - this was the best chicken I've had in quite awhile, and so very easy!

This is soooo good!!  I followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  My boyfriend even said it was better then any restaurant chicken.   I would not hesitate to serve to company.  The only thing I would change next time is to double the mushrooms as I love them!

My husband said this was restaurant quality!  It was definetly very good.  I used double the mushrooms as we love mushrooms, added garlic powder, rosemary and a bit of parsley.  I also bought fresh mozzarella and sliced it and covered the top before baking.  I broiled the cheese the last 5 minutes then removed the dish and poured out the liquid carefully and made a gravy with it, which was very good.  The only thing I didn't like was the chicken got soggy which made me wonder why you brown it.  Maybe I used too much liquid but will definitely make it agian.

This recipie is AMAZING!!!!!! I followed the directions almost exactly, and that's only because I didn't have any chicken broth handy. (I used garlic olive oil and poured it over the top of the chicken to bake in.) I put the cheese in at the beginning of the baking and have had no problems, it's not runny or anything like that. I do think I'm going to use Pam instead of the butter though and see how that turns out. Will update if it turns out well!  I served mine over a bed of rice and it has been a smash hit both times! Definately my new favorite way to make chicken! Thank you so much for the recipie!

I was recently laid off so I have taken over the nightly cooking duties... usually my hubby is the master chef.  I have to say, I was very impressed with myself : )  This was so easy to make and tastes fantastic!  Like many others, sauteed the mushrooms first, used 2/3 broth w/can of mushroom soup, pounded chicken.  I used Panko BC, my new favorite thing, and can't wait for my family to be home for dinner!!   Thanks!!

This was delicious!! I added rosemary into my seasoned bread crumbs. I also followed the other reviews by adding 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. The chicken broth did make the bottom of the chicken a little soggy. Maybe next time I will add 1/2 cream of chicken soup and 1/2 of cream of mushroom. I sauteed the mushrooms with chopped onions. Served over egg noodles. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent as written - I didn't change a thing.  Hubby and 2.5 yr old both loved it!  Will definitely make this one again.

The family was tough on this one. Husband gave it a "2", son a "1" and daughter a "3". I agree with my daughter. Not bad.

Wow!  This was really good!  I used a boiling chicken and just cut it into bite-sized pieces, sauteed the mushrooms, then added some of the chicken broth and a couple of cans of cream of mushroom soup and stirred it in with a couple of pounches of 90 second microwave brown & wild rice.  I bought sliced mozzarella cheese and forgot to top it, but it was still really good. Very quick and easy too.  I'm sure the mozzarella would have enhanced it even more.  Will be making this again!!  Thank you!

I made this dish last night and it was great. I added a few of my own touches... I did saute the mushrooms before in garlic, oil and white wine. I also mixed a full can of chicken broth with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and a few dashes of white wine and garlic powder. I backed it covered for about 25 minutes and then added the cheese and baked for another 10. I served over a veggie pasta. The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful. I will make this again..... not tooo often since I think its very heavy and fattening but I am sure I can come up with a healthier version!!

This was delicious and soo easy.  The only thing I did differently was add a can of Cream of Mushroom soup so the sauce was thicker.  I did not saute the mushrooms because I was lazy and it still turned out great!  I served it over white rice with a side of broccoli.  Will make again!

This meal is quick, easy to prepare & my family loved it!   I doubled the amount of mushrooms, sauteed them in garlic & butter before combining them with the chicken.  I used about 1/ cup of chicken broth and swiss in lieu of mozzarella.  Delish! Thank you for the recip.

I have to say. This dish is one of my favorites to make. Of course I alter the recipe a little...but it is just delicious and my while family loves it.  I always add salt and pepper to the mushroom sauce, and also cook up the sliced mushrooms with onions and garlic in oil until browned.   I also double the sauce....to serve over egg noodles.  I never add cheese. I personally think adding cheese makes it too goopy.  But this recipe is absolutely delicious, and everybody I make it for, including the kids, love it!  I serve this with salad on the side...

Followed this recipe to a "T" and thought it was pretty bland.  I'd make it again, my bf loved it, but I think I'll add a few more spices next time to give it a bit more of a kick.

Hubby gave this 4 stars & a WOW.  When I saw someone's fussy 2 year old ate it I just HAD to try it for my little boy.  He loved it & I was so pleased.  I did add a tin of cream of mushroom to the chicken broth, added oregano, thyme & rosemary (dried), salt & pepper to the bread crumbs for flavour.  Also used chicken tenders - they worked out great since they brown faster & good portion control.    Next time I'll use more butter to brown the chicken & more chicken broth since everyone complained that there wasn't enough gravy.  I'll be making it again soon

Thanks!  This was great!  I make a similar dish with muenster cheese.  This is as good or better and doesn't take as long to prepare!  I did add the mushroom soup as some had suggested.  Thanks so much!  I'll be trying this again!

I've made this dish a few times now and each time the flavors just get better and better.  The first time I tried bone-in thighs and this was okay but I didnt take the skin off the thigh so that wasn't great.  The next time I did use de-boned thighs and took the skin off so it was much better.  I sauted finely chopped onions and garlic with the mushrooms before placing them in the baking dish. I used crushed buttery Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I omitted the butter and went with 2 Tbsp of olive oil and 2 Tbsp of low sodium chicken stock to the skillet before browning the thighs. After the chicken was starting to brown I put it in the baking dish and added a whole can of low sodium cream of mushroom w/ more chicken stock. I went crazy w. the cheese on top and served this all on top of brown rice.  Really tasty!!

Very good! used italian breadcrumbs and swiss cheese. I added the cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking time. My breasts were really thick, so I added an additional 10 minutes to the time.

This was excellent.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more mushrooms, sauteeing them in oil and garlic first.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I accidentally put in too much chicken broth so it was a little runny.  Next time I will add cornstarch.  I also increased the cooking time by ten minutes and did not add the cheese until the last ten minutes.  I served it over spaghetti and it was a hit!

Just made this with a few modifications.  I added 1/2 cup of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom to the sauce and sauteed the mushrooms with extra virgin olive oil, butter and garlic.  Added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up.  Very good.

Fantastic! Like so many reviewers, I sauteed mushrooms (I used 5 cups because we love them so much) with onion and garlic and lots of seasonings before adding them to the dish. I added seasonings to the breadcrumbs and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth. I left off the cheese and am glad I did--it produced a healthier meal that had a TON of flavor. Had I not added so many seasonings I suspect the meal would be rather bland. The chicken was stellar--it was so moist that I double-checked several times to make sure it was cooked! I will cook chicken this way in other recipes from now on--it really is scrumptious. I served this with lightly buttered egg noodles. Definitely a keeper!

Yum! Based on reviews I did make a few changes. I used presliced baby portabella mushrooms and threw them in with some olive oil, garlic, and onion bullion cube. I also used boneless fresh chicken tenders because it's what I had on hand. I added a can of cream of chicken soup with the broth. (Cream of mushroom makes more sense but I didn't have any) I also added my cheese during the last 10-15 minutes of baking as many others suggested. I served it over brown rice and it was so good! My husband doesn't like mushrooms so he just picked his out and left them for me. He still enjoyed the chicken though. I think next time I will add some spices/herbs to the bread crumbs.

This was great and my whole family loved it.  As suggested by others, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth.  I also used about 5 cups of mushrooms and sauteed them first in garlic, olive oil, worcestershire, and a little butter.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was my first time cooking for my girl friend, and ever. This was a easy recipe to follow that turned out awesome. It was so tasty when served with wild rice. Had a fruit with Dreamwhip for dessert to top things off and induce severe food intoxication and bliss. :)

Tasted great for the most part.  The breading was a little soggy after baking.  Also, the cheese should go on 5 minutes before the end of cooking time.  My cheese was a little crunchy.  Overall, great taste.

Wonderful, will now be a regular at our dinner table. I would suggest cutting the cheese in half, for my family the cheese was a bit much. I used only half of the broth required and added more mushrooms ( we love them)

I followed the previous suggestions to pre-saute the mushrooms and add cream of mushroom soup. I also felt that the chicken would have been bland without some seasonsing, so I did salt and pepper the chicken directly as well.  It turned out so yummy in a stick to your ribs kind of way.  We served it with a side of egg noodles.

Boyfriend said he could order this in a restaurant! Based on reviews, I did add tons of spices to the bread crumbs before rolling the chicken so it wouldnt be bland- garlic and onion powder, curry, cumin, pepper. I sautéd garlic, onion, and half the mushrooms in the butter then added the chicken to brown. I decided not to add the cheese, because it looked so good without it and it didn't seem necessary or that it would add anything. I felt like a real chef with this one when it came out looking succulent...

I've made this dish several times and it has always turned out amazing. I'm a college student without too much time to cook, yet this is an easy dish to make up. I made it for my family the last time I was home and they wouldn't stop raving about it. I did like others suggested and sauteed the mushrooms before and waited until the last few minutes to add the cheese.

My husband and I LOVED this. The only things I changed were the mushrooms which I sauteed in Worcestershire sauce, butter and cooking sherry. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I also used Italian bread crumbs for the breading. I had no problem with it being bland, dry or anything. YUMMY is more like it!!!

SO delicious! Like other reviewers, I used cream of mushroom soup and sauteed the mushrooms with some garlic before adding them to the casserole. I used shittake mushrooms and they came out great. I served with white rice that I had cooked with chicken stock instead of water. To die for!

This is my first rating, and this recipe is worth it!  I took the advice of the other reviewers, which was excellent, and added the cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some italian spices and pepper to the bread crumbs.  The chicken was moist and delicious, and the mushrooms were great (after I sauteed them in garlic and olive oil).  This is saved to my recipe box, and I will be happy to make again!

i did everything on this recipe except add cheese.  i dont really like cheese but i dont think it had any effect on the taste because it was DELICIOUS!!!! it was so moist and flavorful. not too salty at all. my friend liked it too and i consider her picky! i dont think u need to pan fry the mushrooms, theres a nice bite to it when u cook it in the oven. leaving out the cheese and cream of mushroom like many suggested saved me a lot of calories too! yummmm!!

Really good and easy.  Made a half recipe with two large boneless breasts.  I used canned sliced portobello mushrooms and a chicken bouillon cube with a 1/2 c. water instead of stock.  No sliced cheese, so just added shredded mozarella at the beginning.  So moist and beautiful but the tiniest bit bland, so maybe some pepper on the chicken next time. But maybe not. Easy for a weeknight and husband liked it.  Served with wild rice. Used a thermometer to check temp--seemed to take 25 minutes.

This was a great recipe!!! I made a few changes to it by adding some bacon which I cooked and crumbled. And like other reviews I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and waited to add the cheese until the last 5-8 minutes. Great with rice!!

Although the taste of this was good I will not make it again.  The sauce was not thick.  I had to pour the juice into a skillet and add thickener.  The chicken was tender but there were so many steps and LOTS of dirty dishes to show for it.  Maybe I did it wrong but I had a dish for the eggs, crumbs, the raw chicken dish before it had the breading, the skillet (twice) and then the oven pan.  Sorry, this was too much work for me.

Great flavor though it took me longer than it said for prep time.  Next time I plan on trying it without breading the chicken, I didn't feel it added any flavor.  Also used the suggestion of a can of cream of mushroom definitely a delicious addition without being overpowering.

This recipe was super delicious and easy to make. I found the sauce a bit too liquidy though. Next time I might try it with heavy creme instead of water (for the chicken broth cubes). Also I mixed the left over egg mass with the left over bread crumbs and cooked them next to the chicken in the pan. Afterwards I layered it on top of the chicken, which made a great topping together with the mushrooms!

SUPER YUMMY dish. I briefly sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic and EVOO (not too much, didn't want to over cook) and then added a can of Chicken and Mushroom cream soup (yes, they have a can that contains both, I found it at Ralphs, couldn't find the normal cream of mushroom so I went with this one and it turned out fantastic!) and 3/4 cup of Chicken Broth, heated through and then went to prepare the chicken.  Used chicken tenders and I think this was what got more flavors in the chicken, being smaller pieces, but still came out totally moist.  I added to the Italian bread crumbs, a few dashes of onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and italian seasoning.  Used 2 eggs to dredge.  Then browned both sides of chicken in a pan with butter, then placed them in the 9x13 pan, covered it with the sauce (which was pretty thick) and put in oven for 25 min.  Then topped with slices of Havarti cheese (decided to get a more tasty cheese) and put back in oven for 10 more min.  Came out delicious and perfect!  Served over brown rice (Because I love rice!)

Tastes good! I followed others' advice using cream of mushroom soup, mushroom saute with garlic, and spiced up the egg before coating the chicken. Served over white rice.

The chicken was very tender.  I liked the method of frying the chicken on both sides first.  Couldn't taste the cheese.

This was wonderful!
I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth before adding to the pan. I think without, the sauce would have been much to watery for our liking. 
I also used 2 cans of drained sliced mushrooms as I had no fresh mushrooms on hand. I also added 1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt & dried parsley to my plain bread crumbs. 
Very delicious! Will be added to our meal rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

Simple, delicious chicken.  The mushrooms taste amazing if you saute them with butter and garlic like everyone else says.  I flattened the chicken with a rolling pin to make sure they cooked through.  It came out nice and juicy.  Some reviewers suggested adding cream of mushroom but I think it tastes just fine without it.  Besides, that's a lot of extra calories.

This is the first recipe that I'm reviewing on this site because I was compelled to create an account just so I could rave about this recipe. I'm a pretty poor student intern cooking for myself and this was delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and minced garlic first. I also sprinkled the final creation with some oregano. Definitely try this recipe!!

I felt compelled to change the recipe because so many comments had many alterations, so I feared a bland dinner without incorporating, which is a bummer! 

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup (must be the only kitchen without it), so I added half and half to the stock once I pulled out of oven and removed chicken. I actually poured it back into the skillet and added cornstarch to thicken up for gravy. Tossed the gravy with my cooked rotini; also drizzled over chicken and noodles. 

The cheese was fine added to the beginning. I couldn't figure out if people added the mush soup after or before oven cooking...I added the cream after and reheated.

Other than that, didn't change the base of the recipe or spices and I thought it was good.  Not wow good, but a nice meal.  Don't feel pressured to change the recipe!  It'll turn out just fine with the natural flavors of the cheese and stock.

Reeeeally good!  I sauteed a small onion, a tspn of italian seasoning and mushrooms in the butter before adding the chicken.  Cooked those for 3 mins on each side, then removed them to the baking dish.  I then added the chicken broth, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch ...it thickens the gravy up nicely!  Poured over top and added the cheese...GOOD STUFF!

This was an good recipe and worked well over pasta. I also added the cream of mushroom soup with the broth. I was really scared that it would be gluey,but it wasn't. I will make this again maybe even adding white wine and garlic. Thanks for a good recipe and to all the past reviewers for their input.

It was pretty good I did as others suggested and added the can of mushroom soup and sauted the mushrooms with garlic and white wine. I served it over egg noodles. My girlfriend loves mushrooms but is usually pretty picky about trying new things, she ate all of it though. Will make it again.

My fiancee loved this meal. After cooking the meal as indicated, I did add the cream of mushroom soup to get a thicker sauce.  Went great with rice.  I will add more seasoning next time I make, was a little underseasoned.

This is my husband's favorite. I usually use pepper jack cheese to liven it up a bit. The only problem I find with the recipe is that the bottom of the chicken is soggy when it comes out of the oven, due to sitting in the broth. That makes the leftovers look less than attractive. But my husband still drools when he finds out that I'm making this one for dinner!  It's a satisfying and tasty meal.

This was very good .The following is what I did with the recipe. I mixed a little buttermilk in with the eggs. I used whole wheat bread crumbs, and I mixed in wheat germ, ground flax seed, salt, pepper, garlic salt, dried parsley, and dried basil. I used canned button mushrooms since that was all I had. I sauteed them in evoo and a little red cooking wine. I didn't have enough mushrooms to put on the bottom so mine were just on top. I only had shredded mozzerella cheese, so I liberally put that on top.  I served it with pasta and sauce, and steamed broccoli. Over all it was very yummy!

With the following modifications, I think this is a five star recipe. First, I sauteed 1 cup finely chopped onion and 1/2 cup finely chopped celery, then added about 4 cups of mushrooms, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper, and sauteed until soft.  I added 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning and 1/4 cup parmesan to the seasoned bread crumbs before dipping the chicken.  Instead of broth, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 tbsp chicken granules, and a little milk.  The cheese & sauce were delicious.  The chicken, very tender, but a bit bland.  Next time, I'm going to cut the chicken into strips, so the breading covers more surfaces.  And add even more spices to the breadcrumbs.

I'd really like to thank you for giving me the chance to try your recipe.  I've had it since Oct. 2001 and should've given it a review before now.  I'm sorry that it took so long, but my husband, my kids and myself really like it.  Thanks for your recipe, everyone here likes it very much.

This is the most tender chicken I have ever eaten in my life! It's like a chemical reaction, the cheese helping the stock steam the chicken, yet it isn't soggy! Wonderful. A splash of marsala wine didn't kill it, either!

This was very good!! My husband is not a fan of mushrooms, and I am, but he actually really liked this dish!! I did saute the mushrooms before I placed them in the pan(as recommended by others) and I added a can of cream of mushroom to it too, and it was great!

I followed the directions of other raters,(ie the addition of mushroom soup, sauteing the mushrooms) and the dish was excellent. The only other change I made was to use Bella mushrooms as well as the standard button mushrooms, and I think that was a good decision. Good dish, fairly easy to make.

With the suggessted changes it's really good. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I skipped that part and added a can of 99% fat free cream of chicken. I used chicken 'strips' and sauted them with the mushrooms and garlic, baked for 30 minutes. Separated the chicken from the gravy and poured it over mashed potatoes. Very, very good

I made this pretty close to the original recipe.  I did add some white wine in place of the chicken broth because we like wine flavored dishes.  I just couldn't get the sauce to come out right.  It was very thin, so I tried to thicken it but it just didn't do much good.  My husband liked it ok, but I didn't care for it.  I think I will try it again, but add some cream of mushroom like LOTS of others have suggested.

This recipe was nice and easy, but it felt like something was missing once I got a taste of it.  I did like others and sauteed the mushrooms in garlic first.  I added extra seasoning to the bread crumbs and I didn't add the cheese until like the last 15 minutes.  I will try this again and try to add more spices.  Thanks!

I really did not like this. I did what everyone said and added white wine to the sauce as well, as cream of mushroom soup. I thought the sauce was great and ate that over the rice. Just did not feel like the chicken went with the sauce.

this was pretty tasty.
i salted/peppered and added garlic powder to my chicken breasts. i also sauteed the mushrooms in some butter and garlic powder beforehand.
i added the can of cream of mushroom soup as well as others suggested. i'm glad i did because it would have been much too runny and bland without it.

This was good, the only issue us that the breading got soggy from the chicken broth. Instead of plain mozzarella I used a 6 cheese blend (mozzarella, parmesan, romano, fonina, & asaigo shredded) to give it more flavor.

This was pretty good.  It was a nice concept that I need to work with a little.  I think I'll try to thicken the sauce a little next time.  I, like other reviewers, did not add the cheese until the end.  My husband liked it a lot.

Easy to make and looks impressive!  I used grated mozzarella and white wine in place of chicken broth.  Yum!  We'll make this again!

I substituted flour for bread crumsb since I did not have bread crumbs.  It was okay - my husband liked it but I did not really care for it - so will not make again.

My boyfriend loves this and suggests it all the time, but i'm not the biggest fan. We've done it with and without adding cream of mushroom soup, and disagree which is better. Also, I like to add thyme to the mushrooms for some more flavor.

I followed the suggestions on this site:  sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and garlic.  I then added a can of cream of mushroom soup and the chicken broth (if you do this, make sure you mix the broth and soup... it will be better!!)  I also used sliced colby jack cheese.

We really weren't happy with the recipe.  It was ok, but we probably won't make it (at least this way) again.  I might try the recipe as written, but use canned shrooms.  I don't know what it is about this one, but neither of was thrilled.  I didn't even finish mine.

I would give this five stars but like other reviewers I altered it slightly. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, which made a nice gravy. I also sautéed the mushrooms with garlic prior to baking. My family enjoyed this. I will definitely make this again

This really was very good with the added mushroom soup to the broth. My entire family enjoyed it. I also sautee the mushrooms first with garlic as suggested and put them on both bottom and top of chicken. Our family decided that next time we will add artichokes to the mushrooms...or sauce...it would go great with this!

It smelled a lot better than it tasted.  Very bland, and the broth made the breading soggy.  There are so many better chicken recipes than this.

I knew that cooking the mushrooms in the oven for that long would make them too done, loosing a lot of their flavor, so I cooked the chicken via directions, briefly sautéed the mushrooms in butter and garlic, put them on top of the chicken dish for the last 5 minutes of baking.

This is such a good recipe!  As was suggested, I used the cream of mushroom soup, but I subsituted white wine for the chicken broth.  I don't use any cheese either.  I have used this same recipe with pork chops and gotten rave reviews.  I cannot recommend this recipe enough!

I did what others mentioned and added a can of cream of mushroom and some seasoned chicken broth. I also jazzed up the Italian bread crumbs with more seasoning and some Parmesan cheese. It was OK, but it just lacked something. I would rather make this into a chicken parm or something.

Great, the family LOVED it!  I did not bread the chicken, just browned it in some butter. (trying to keep low carb)  Then baked as recipe states but used swiss cheese and topped with bacon!  Huge success!

This was very good - but a bit dry...I will try doing the cream of mushroom soup next time.  I have to agree with what I read on another post.  Is it really a 5 star recipe when you have to modify it????  That's a good question.

This dish needed more flavor.  I used low-fat cheese and the dish was bland.  Next time I will season the chicken and use real cheese.

this is my favorite chicken recipe!!  i've made this dish several times for family & friends - they've all loved it too.  i took the advise of other reviewers to saute the mushrooms w/ olive oil & to add creme of mushroom to the chicken broth - makes the recipe much tastier.  i found that one egg was enough for dipping but i needed more butter. also, jack cheese works as a wonderful substitute for mozzarella.

This was just ok, not bad but not great. My husband said that it lacked flavor just as many other reviews mentioned. I did add the cream of mushroom soup, as well as adding additional spices (salt, pepper, oregeno, basil) to jazz it up and I sauted the mushrooms with garlic, but it did not seem to make a difference. A very similar recipe to this, but with much more falvor is "Chicken Marsal I" also from this site. Try it and decide for yourself.

I made this for dinner last night with pasta, and it was delicious and filling.  I used a whole can of chicken broth and campbells cream of mushroom soup and there was plenty of sauce for the pasta.  Excellent recipe.

Great recipe! Prepared exactly as stated, then served over white rice. Next time I may serve with potatoes or stuffing. We loved it and it will be added to our rotation! Thanks!

We are mushroom lovers so I doubled the about of mushrooms.  I added the cream of mushroom soup per other reviews.  It was good, but I think that it would also have been fine without it.  We served with egg noodles.

This was delicious!   I sprinkled on a little bit of oregano and garlic.  Next time I'll probably leave out the oregano. My husband really loved it too, and my 7-year old ate it!  The chicken was very tender.  Will definitely make this again.  Yummmmmmm!!

Very tasty meal!  My 9 year old loved it (and he hates mushrooms)!  The only changes I made were I used italian bread crumbs and add salt pepper, & parmesan cheese!

LOVED it!!!  It was a snap to make, and loaded with flavor.  The funny thing is, I forgot to add the chicken broth, and I thought it looked rather dry, but it was still excellent.  I also used a shredded Mexican blend cheese that I had on hand, since I didn't have any Mozzerella.  Excellent!!  Can't wait to make again, this time with the broth...

I liked this recipe o.k., it didn't knock my socks off like I expected. I feel it would have come out better using flattened chicken breast fillets since it takes so long to cook a large chicken breast,also the mushrooms shriveled up too much. I didn't care much for all the watery/cheesy goo at the bottom of the pan either. The Chicken itself was tender which my husband and I both liked but I didn't see what was in the pan to put over noodles or rice. This one wasn't my favorite...

I made this dish in individual aluminum plates Flavored my breadcrumbs, and used Havarati cheese to top it off. thirty minutes cooking at 350 degress was just fine.

I've made this recipe twice.  The second time I made it I left out the chicken broth by accident.  You could definitely tell the difference.  Don't skimp on the ingredients!  Yummy!

I followed the suggestions of others and substituted baby portabello mushrooms and added some white wine with the chicken broth.  It was really wonderful over cooked rice.

I am not a fan of mushrooms, especially fresh ones, but I made this for my boyfriend who loves them and I was surprised at how great it tasted. Even my 4 year old who doesn't like meat ate hers. Definetely a keeper I'll make again. I'm glad I gave this recipe a chance.

Very tasty!  My family loved it!  I added a cup of blended wild & brown rice (cooked) and it was delicious.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I seasoned my plain crumbs with dry oregano, garlic powder and onion powder. I added minced shallot with the mushrooms and used provolone instead of mozzarella. I will definitely be making this one again.

I fixed this three times so far and they've been a hit every time. So many great recipes on this website, it's hard to get the family to let me try something else. Easy to put together. Used mushroom soup last time instead of broth and it was every bit as good.

This was excellent!  I used Kraft 2% Mozz. singles and put it on top of the chicken right after I took it out of the oven.  Once it sat for a few seconds it melted perfectly.  Wonderful new way to cook chicken!!

This was an excellent and easy recipe. The chicken turned out moist and juicy and was great served with garlic noodles. I added a can of mushrooms as well which was a nice touch. My boyfriend loved it. This is a keeper...Thanks!

Normally after I make a new dish, I'll personalize it with a dash of that, a little less of this and so on.  I've made this over 10 times, and never have felt the need to change it at all.   Great meal served over angel hair pasta with breadsticks and a salad.  Fave of the kids!

I made this adding onions with the mushrooms. It was very good. You only need one egg. I didn't have the right kind of cheese, ended up using the closest thing I had which was a blend that had cheddar in it. I recommend using a white cheese, but it still tasted good.

A good chicken alternative.  My family enjoyed it.  I used more broth than the recipe called for, and wished I'd used more. I also used twice as many mushrooms, and could have used another cup of them.

I was tired of preparing chicken the same way over and over again and decided to check out the web for ideas and came across this site. I got a few different recipes and tried this one first. I wasn't sure about it at first until I took the first bite and was HOOKED.  DELICIOUS!!!  I will definately make this again and again.  Thank you

My husband LOVES mushrooms. So I tried this, and he LOVED it. The chicken was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. I just served it with carrots, and a fresh salad. I will DEFINATELY make this one again. THANK YOU!!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I'm also one of those people who does not like chicken that much.  This is one of the few times I actually ate an entire piece of chicken.  My husband raved about it too.  We'll definitely make this one again!

WOW! This was great. I cook a lot for my boyfriend and me and so far, I've never made anything he didn't like. But this...he said it was by far the best thing I've ever made. I used Roasted Garlic bread crumbs, which he loved. I have a feeling I'l be making this a lot!

For optimal flavor, be sure to use the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Very yummy!

This recipe was very good.  I added some extra spices and parmesan cheese to the breading mixture to spice it up a little.  Would definitely make this again.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I added a tad of garlic powder and basil as I was thought that the dish might not have enough flavor but it was great!  I have made this recipe several times successfully.

This was my first recipe that I've try from this web site; and the chicken was awesome! It was very tender and moist. We added more mushrooms than what it called for, since we are mushroom lovers. My husband said it look liked some thing you would see in a cook book; Almost too pretty to eat!

This recipe is one of the best we have had!
I used herb seasoned stuffing(Pepperidge Farm). I just put it in my blender for a few spins. Only one large egg. I will use a lot more mushrooms next time. My four year old ate all of her mushrooms, her sisters mushrooms plus half of mine and her fathers. I cut the mushrooms in large slices so they were still firm. Sooooooo good!!!!! Thank you.

I added about twice as many mushrooms.  I used button and shiitake.  I didn't put the cheese on until after about 20 minutes of baking.  We did enjoy this, but it wasn't spectacular.

Good enough to make a second day.  I used portabella and regular mushrooms.  Be careful not to use too much marsala wine and sherry.

This is definately good enough to serve to guests.  I added Lipton Garlic Mushroom soup mix mixed with a cup of water instead of the chicken broth, more mushrooms, and more cheese on top.  My husband was really impressed, and he doesn't normally like anything made with chicken breasts.

My husband doesn't really care for boneless chicken, but he liked it this way.  He loved all the mushrooms.  I even used more than it called for.  I thickened up the juices to make gravy and served over noodles.  Delicious!!

This is the first recipe I made from this website and it was delicious.  My husband even commented, unsolicited, that it was really good.  In fact, he mentioned again the next evening when we were having dinner.  My 9 year old liked it too, except he picked out the mushrooms.  I think when I make it the next time (and I will make it again) I'll leave the last piece of chicken without any mushrooms on top.  I served it with noodles.  A great dinner.  Thank you.

This is a great recipe.  I used fine bread crumbs and spiced them up.  Didnot
use the amount called for.  Use less. Also only used one egg and did three good
size chicken pieces with a bit left over.  Next time I will serve with mashed potatoes
and a salad or vegetables.  My husband thought it was great also.  
Will be making it again soon!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I substituted regular french onion soup and spooned the onions
from the soup over the top of the chicken. I know it would have been great with the regular broth - but
when my husband had it with the french onion soup - he went oo-la-la!!

Wonderful!  I served it over a bed of egg noodles lightly tossed with cream of mushroom soup and everyone in my family loved it.  My children even asked that I add the recipe to their recipe book (which moves out with them, the sooner the better).

I served this chicken over brown rice, when I had company, and it was a huge hit.  It is so simple to make.  We loved it.

My 11 year old doesn't eat mushrooms, but he ate these - he said they were "good"!

The whole family loved it!
