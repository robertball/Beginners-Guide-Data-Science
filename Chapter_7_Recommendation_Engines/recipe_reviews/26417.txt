This is a great basic chili recipe. The reason I only gave 3 stars is because you MUST presoak the dried beans before cooking or the will not fully cook. Especially Red Kidney beans. Be careful here because dry red kidney beans contain a toxin that can cause severe gastric distress if not fully cooked!! Pre-soak you beans overnight and this recipe is fantastic!!

Tasty,but the beans stayed crunchy for MUCH longer than the 2 to 3 hours suggested cooking time. Maybe presoaking them or blanching them first would have helped.

A bit too tomato-ey...I added waaay more chili powder and pepper sauce than the recipe called for and it still tasted a little like spaghetti sauce.  I'll try adding some bell peppers and other spices next time.  Maybe a little less tomato paste.

Awesome recipe, but two changes are needed. 1 dry beans need to be presoaked, and 2 all tomato products cannot be added until beans are completely soft. (It is a science thing -- if you add the tomatoes the beans never soften. I believe it is the acid, not sure I am remembering the why.) So this makes for 2nd step. After beans are completely soft, add all tomato products. Continue to simmer for about another hour to develop flavor.

Very tomatoy. After browning the meat with the garlic and onion I threw everything into the crockpot for 4 hours on high.
