This stuff is the best. Make sure you use the thinner cut chicken breast, and you MUST grill these! Pan cooked is ok, but the grill really makes a difference!

This is a good and easy recipe. Just don't cook the chicken too long as it will dry out.

Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts & subbed vegetable oil for olive oil; marinated for several hours before grilling.  Enjoyed alongside Black Bean & Corn Salad II from this site.

We really liked this recipe. I used skinless, boneless, chicken breast.  Letting it soak in the sauce, in the fridge for 6 hrs before grilling. You can use other meats in this marinade too. Very tasty. Thanks.

This isn't so much a recipe as it is following the instructions on the seasoning packet.  I've made this for over 2 years now, my boyfriend loves it.  My exception is that I cook it in an oven bag in the oven and not on the grill.
