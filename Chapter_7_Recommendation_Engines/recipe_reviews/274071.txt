Turned out really well. Didn’t spread too much so kept a nice, soft center. I added a little more ginger to increase the heat a little but the recommended amount should be perfect. The sugar on the outside didn’t leave a strong visual sugar so a confectioners dusting might be in order if you like the color break. Quickest best ginger bake I have come across.

Love the soft center and a bit crispy edges. I underbaked the first pan and it was too soft. Very good!

No changes. These were perfect! Sometimes I get I a holiday rut and it's the same menu year after year. So this year we started looking outside the box. We made these early and I couldn't find my grandma's recipe. We've already confirmed these are a definite for Christmas. Hurry up Santa!

DELISH!!  So easy to make!  Perfectly soft inside with a little crunch on the outside.  Will definitely make them again!  I may even add a little extra ginger as I'm a freak over the flavor!
