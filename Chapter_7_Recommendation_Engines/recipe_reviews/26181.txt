I hate measuring sticky stuff, so I simplified this recipe by using one jar of fluff, one jar of peanut butter and a bag of mini Chocolate chips. I rolled the cookies in powdered sugar and placed on a cookie sheet lined with plastic wrap. These were firm after being chilled a couple of hours, and not at all sticky. I think all the recipe needs to be perfect is a teaspoon of vanilla.

this is super easy and quick. it tastes really good! I tried it our on three preschoolers and they loved it. my only complaint it is too gooey and could be quite a mess. maybe sticking it in the fridge for a few hours would help???

This recipe was great! My first thought when I read this recipe is that it was going to be sticky, so I gave it a shot and when I was rolling the batter with a cookie scooper I was thinking to myself wow I really like this recipe. Everyone in the house loved them.

I didn't actually taste these but had my 9 yr old boy scout group make these and they loved them and wanted the recipe to take home so they could make them again. I had them dust their hands good with powdered sugar before rolling them, the ones that did didn't have any trouble with them sticking to their hands.

Works like magic!  I was a little doubtful at first b/c marshmallow fluff is too intensely sweet for me, but the peanut butter and mini-chips made a great combination!  So easy - and no problems with stickiness - they rolled right up and were ready to pop in the mouth!

They are sticky..but I found rolling them in a mixture of brown sugar and cocoa powder helped.  I did put them in the fridge unwrapped helped also.  My family loved them!

I didn't feel like rolling them because they were really sticky so I ate it off the spoon. Used homemade marhsmallow fluff.

This was very good and so easy to make. My almost 3 year old daughter loves them. I put them in the refrigerator for a couple hours and they are not really sticky.

Awesome! All the reviews were helpful especially the one that said to roll with powdered sugar and brown sugar! I loved this recipe and gobbled it right up!
But if you freeze the mix and use big choc. chips then the chips will hurt your teeth. Use small chips or melt chocolat!

This cookie was very good and chewy.  They were also sticky but hay the kids love them.  My husband thought they were an excellent treat at the super bowl party.  Thank you for a good recipe.

These are so good. I can’t buy marshmallow fluff anymore bc my teens will eat these cookies in one sitting. They quit using a bowl to make them, just using spoon to mix the ingredients together in one of the peanut butter containers that we had taken a scoop out of already.

I froze these and used dark chocolate chips. Gave three stars because I can’t imagine eating these at room temperature too much mess and gooeyness

I'm only rating this as I've eaten this recipe that my moonkid has made a few times...okay, so several times LOL! I've watched how easy and simple this is to make even for a teenager. We like this a lot. What I've encouraged her to do verses trying to roll them, is to grab one of the small cookie dough ballers and use it in place of her hands. It's simple and effective and there is no need junking up your fingers and everything else. That's my advice. All the dough balls are inform and very pretty on a plate as well as tasty in the tummy. With or with out chocolate chips is still great and even when she used crunchy peanut butter too. It's also quite quick recipe. TY

Quick, easy, and pretty darn good!  These aren't supposed to be some sort of gormet cookie - they're no bakes!  Just drop them by small spoonfull onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet, then dredge in powdered sugar.  After they are sugared, they are VERY easy to shape into balls.  An hour or so in the fridge and you're good to go!  Thanks for this one!

Unfortunately, I am not a fan. These tasted like if I were desperate for something sweet and just used whatever I could find in my cabinet. Not horrible, but not good...I won't make them again.
