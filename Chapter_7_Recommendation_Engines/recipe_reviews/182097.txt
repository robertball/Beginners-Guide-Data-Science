Sorry about that!

Add the eggs at the same time as you mix in the goat's cheese. 

Make sure you put the rosti straight into a hot oven, otherwise the eggs start to leak out of the potato mixture!

I found the same recipe on another web site and it said to stir the eggs into the grated potatoes when you stir in the cheese before baking.

Delicious. I love sweet potatoes but not the sugary sort. This was wonderful. Only change for me next time will be a splash of tabasco in the rosti

These were well received at our house! Great flavour. A wonderful use of sweet potatoes without all the sugar used in most sweet potato recipes

This was a nice change, I made the recipe as is and added a pinch of nutmeg (why not?).  This is a good lunch meal or a light dinner, would go well with salad.  I used true sweet potatoes (white flesh) not yams.

The sweet potatoes definitely needed longer than 25 minutes to cook, more like 35-40.  It tasted a bit dry and the crumbled goat cheese on top did not add anything to the dish.  I would make this again with a couple modifications such as adding some sort of sauce.

To be fair I don't particularly like sweet potatoes.  Might try these again later as the winter CSA we are in is likely to give me ample more sweet potatoes.  
These did get a little burnt at the posted time so I'd either drop the temp a touch or cook them a minute or two less.
Second ... I didn't realize when I grabbed goat cheese at the store that the standard pack was less than listed - and the cake itself was pretty bland so it needs every bit of the tangy melty goat cheese and some additionaly seasoning too ... maybe garlic salt.

I was a little nervous after reading the reviews, but dove in anyway. I ended up chopping half the potatoes in a Cuisinart and grating the rest. Still the messiest thing ever. I also added a little pumpkin pie spice which gave the flavor more depth. Draining the water from the potatoes is hard, and I did a terrible job, but it worked out pretty well. Should have used a larger baking sheet, as it makes a lot. I made more of a casserole than individual patties, but it was good regardless. Ate it like it was going out of style. Will make again - with someone else to help clean up.

Great flavor! Texture was a little bit interesting.  Not sure if I didn't squeeze out enough water or what.  Reheated well as leftovers.  Will likely make again.

It was okay... I added all the goat cheese in the mixture instead of putting it on top.  I served it as a side dish however I think if I make it again it'll be in miniture size and used as, or as part of, an appetizer.

Yummy.  I didn't have a grater, so I boiled the potatoes (whole), peeled and sliced.  I placed in 4 large muffin tins.  I love goat cheese and will add more next time I make them.  Loved them.
