This was awesome!  Cucumber kimchi is my favorite!  I already had toasted sesame seeds so I skipped the first step.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead because that is what my mom always uses when she cooks Korean food and added a pinch of sugar, or "sweetness" as my mom calls it.  It was very easy to make and really tastes like the real thing!
**I just wanted to say that kochujong isn't really a hot sauce, it is hot pepper paste...just thought this might help people who are looking for it

This was very good even though I made changes to it. I couldn't find Korean hot sauce so I used Frank's hot sauce. I also used a yellow onion instead of green. I also added 1 tsp of sugar as suggested by another member. I liked the contrast of flavors between the hot sauce and the sesame oil. This dressing was not too spicy, which I also liked. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent!!! The only thing that I recommend is to cut the vinegar in half. Also, salt the cucumbers and let them sit to "sweat them out", rinse before coating with the dressing. Great recipe!

I also wanted to add a note. To make it really authentic you can rinse your cucumbers after you slice them and sprinkle them with a pinch of salt for 10 minutes to wilt them a litte before you use them. I prefer mine a little more juicy, but my boyfriend likes them that way too.

I substituted srihacha hot sauce instead of korean hot sauce, and cilantro for green onion. Exellent.

I couldn't find the Korean hot sauce or paste so I used a Thai hot sauce I had on hand. I also used diced red onion instead of the green and added a pinch of cane sugar crystals. It was really good, but with the hot sauce I used very spicy! I'm not sure if the kochujang would be that hot, but be wary if your sensitive to spicy food. We loved it and will definitely make again!

This is very good!! I did follow another reviewer and added 1 Tbs of sugar. You HAVE to use sesame oil because I think that's what make this soooooo good.

This reminded me of another Korean cucumber recipe I've tried on this site. The other one had some salt added; it's better with salt. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same. I don't have "kochujang" so I did a little research on the net to see about making a sub. The closest I was able to come was to mix a sweetener with Sriracha (or whatever hot sauce/paste you're subbing). Apparently kochujang has sugar in it; I added a little Splenda to my Sriracha and called it a day. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for another side dish recipe for a Korean meal and this was perfect. Great recipe! I followed it almost exactly - I used apple cider vinegar and added a bit of sugar. I'd recommend either halving the sauce ingredients, or adding another cucumber, as this is quite saucy.

There's too much of the sauce. And I find it a bit too acidic, adding a bit of sugar and soy sauce or salt made it less acidic.

07.19.17 ~ A nice spicy twist on a cucumber.  My DH wanted something made with cucumbers.  I tried this using homemade spicy Thai paste instead of kochujang (Korean hot sauce), as I didn't have that on hand.  I liked them, my husband really liked them.  The longer they sat the spicier that got.  I'm sure I'll be making these again at some point, but I leave out the sesame seeds as they didn't agree with my DH. A nice change for a cuke.

I'm not an authority on Korean food but I do love cucumber with vinegar. I followed the instructions the 1st time, all except for the Korean Hot Sauce, couldn't find it so used chili paste.  I backed off on the chili paste, 2 tsp from 2 Tbsp; that had plenty of 'zip' for me.  The next time I used only 1 Tbsp of sesame seeds & bumped up the sesame oil to 2 Tbsp and added 2 onions.

I read the other reviews and kind of did a mix of other's suggestions. I also couldn't find the Korean hot sauce, so I used Sriracha and added a tablespoon of honey to it. I used 2 cucumbers and did salt them for 10 - 15 minutes before rinsing. After I mixed everything together, I thought it should be sweeter, so I added 2 teaspoons of sugar. I let it chill while I made Korean Bulgogi as the main dish.  I will make this again.
