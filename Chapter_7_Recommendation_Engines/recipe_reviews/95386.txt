This is a very nice alternative to classic egg-nog and tastes great.

This also works with cold fat free evaporated milk and sugar free french vanilla pudding. To give it a hint of alcohol flavor without adding the brandy, I added a good measure of rum extract. EXCELLENT as a coffee creamer for those who like eggnog lattes but can't afford to buy them every day.

I replaced the non dairy creamer with regular soy milk, and found this recipe delicious! The only problem I had was having to mix a 2nd time in the blender, as once it sat overnight it seperated. jj

Unfortunately, I don't think this a good substitute for the real thing, and that's too bad because it is easy to make.  My biggest complaint is that it tastes too artificial and more like a vanilla drink rather than eggnog. Another point is that it ends up costing more than the bottles of eggnog that you can buy at the supermarket that I think taste better.  There's no cost savings to making your own. After refrigeration, it thickened (like pudding should do), so I added milk and re-blended to reach the right consistency.  Sorry, Joy, this one just didn't work for me.  We drank it, but I doubt I'll make again.

Easy to adapt. I use 5 3/4 cups unsweetened plain almond milk, 1/4 cup dark rum, one of the 5.1 oz boxes of vanilla pudding mix, and a touch nutmeg and cinnamon.

I absolutely love this “nog” recipe. I make this at least once a week. I make it with sugar free creamer & sugar free vanilla pudding. I have been leaving out the nutmeg but sprinkle a small amount of it on it when I’m serving this to someone. I leave it out for me. It is my dessert & my reward at the end of the day. I sometimes add 32 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk so it increases the amount & extends how long I have it. It doesn’t affect the flavor & the consistency is that it is slightly thinned but still wonderful! Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! I used sugar free pudding and creamer, and it was still wonderful. I drank it without the brandy, my husband withit, and we both approved! Since I can't consume raw eggs anymore, I was so glad to find thi recipe.  Excellent alternative!
