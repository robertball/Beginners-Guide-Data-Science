This recipe did not work for me.  I found it impossible to cook the egg enough so that it was safe to give to a childz.  You can't flip it because of the cheese, so the egg never fully cooks on the other side.  I tried again turning down the heat, but again the bread burns before the egg even comes close to being fully cooked.  The third time I tried this, I left off the cheese and just added the egg, so that I could flip it and have a fully cooked egg.

I tried this because it reminded me that my dad would butter and fry bread when I was young and we were on camping trips.

I buttered both sides of the bread then cut out the circle.  Put the egg in  the hole and salted and peppered some.  Because I don't like my eggs runny, I covered the pan with a lid to help cook the top of the egg some.  After the bottom was browned I flipped the bread over, placed the cheese on top and covered the pan again to help melt the cheese.  It wasn't bad at all!  The crispy fried bread really is what makes it taste better than just egg and toast.

Awww memories... We called these Bullseye & 1 eyed jack. Gosh soo many names for this recipe. Hole in one, egg boat just to name a few.... Haven't tried the cheese. I always butter both sides of bread & fry for 1 minute on each side then add the egg to the hole & cook for about 3 minutes & turn it over. Add salt & pepper..... Really good & kids can make this.

This is a great recipe but be sure to put bread in skillet then crack the egg into the hole IMMEDATELY after puting bread in skillet. Do not cook bread AT ALL before adding the egg, you will have a burnt toad in the hole!

Delicious! I cut this down to one serving for breakfast and waited until the egg was cooked before adding the cheese.  Great with a side of Canadian bacon and OJ!

This is a good recipe (I made them this morning for brunch) but it is not a classic Toad-in-a-hole which is comprised of sausages quickly browned in a skillet, covered with Yorkshire pudding batter, and finished in the oven.

Been making Egg in the Hole (same thing as Toad in the Hole) for years, minus the cheese. Never cook eggs on high. They require a low to medium heat. These will burn if cooked on high. Readers have said that you can't flip these, which is, of course, true, but you can put a lid on them and cook on low heat until done to your liking, or do what I do, add the cheese after cooking the egg. The cheese will melt (if not cut thickly). My grandkids love these and often ask for them when they visit. Great with various herbs on top for the more sophisticated taste.

My mother always made these for me as a kid, although she calls them "Powder Puff Eggs."  We use a small juice glass to cut the hole in the bread.  We have never put cheese on ours, but it sounds like a good idea.  

It's also fun (and tasty) to butter and fry the "hole" you cut from the bread too.  

I also recommend flipping and frying your "Toad in a Hole" on both sides to cook the egg sufficiently for kids.  

For those adults who prefer their eggs "over easy," this is a delicious and easy way to make them.  When you cut into the bread, the yolk spreads to the bread.  You must try this simple homey recipe!

LOL, I made these with a heart shaped cookie cutter., alas after I put on the cheese you couldn't see the hearts anymore. I made them with home made bread and this was truly comfort food.

My mom made this for us all the time when we were kids and we called them "One eyed Jacks". Love all the different names for this dish. She never put cheese on the egg so I had to give it a try. Yum, even better! For the reviewer who likes the eggs a bit runnier, try browning both sides of the bread first and then place your egg on top. Thanks Joan!

This brought back lots of memories!
Yhere are lots of variations, spreading the bread with garlic or herb butter before frying, drizling the sauce of choice on the bread before buttering, using two thin bread slices to 'sandwich' bacon (after cutting holes) etc. etc.
What I mainly wanted to say was to those people who want to end up with runny yolks: Medium heat, fry the bread on one side and turn first, then - when you crack your egg, hold it over the hole and allow only some of the white to drop into the hole, then wait for it to cook and change color, before you add the rest of the egg. This keeps the yolk off the direct heat of the skillet. Then, when you add the cheese, either try adding a little water to the skillet surface and covering with a lid (this is my favourite but it takes a little practice to get the timing right) or brown the cheese under a hot Grill.

Easy and delicious. I've been making these since I was a kid myself.  We always referred to them as Eggs in a Nest. I prefer to omit the cheese.

My mom used to make these for me when I was a kid, they're fun when you're a kid but they are a little bland.  Also on a side note these are actually called "eggs in a basket", toad in a hole is a traditional english dish made by adding sausage to yorkshire pudding.

Sometimes, food should be fun.  This is fun food.  I used a shot glass to cut the hole in the uncooked bread, toasted one side, flipped it and put the egg in the hole, then flipped it again to cook the top of the egg.  Good times :)

Such a great comfort recipe--my dad used to make it for me and called it "One-Eyed Eggs."  I usually cook the bread with the egg on both sides, flipping it after a couple minutes.  Also, if you find you are over-cooking the egg by waiting for the cheese to melt, try sprinkling a couple tablespoons of water on the frying pan (not too close to the bread!) and covering it for twenty or thirty seconds--the steam will melt the cheese pretty quickly.

This was really good and easy.  I used a shot glass for the cutout.  Added butter to the pan at medium/low heat, toasted the  bread and cracked the egg. Once I was able to move it and see that it was nicely browned on one side I flipped it onto a little more butter (not sure if this was entirely necessary) then cooked till the egg was hard, I don't like mine runny.  Only then did I add Colby Jack cheese.  With a little S&P and Cholula and it was amazing!

I grew up on these too but we called them Egg's Nests. Love them! I believe Toad in the Hole is sausages in Yorkshire puddings. It must be the several generations that have mixed up the names. Love them all!! :-D

I love this with garlic pepper seasoning on top -or- frank's red hot sauce shaken over. I always lightly toast the bread before cutting out the rounds. I never cover the pan for fear of making the bread soggy, but I'm always happy with the results.

My 9 year was not as impressed as I thought she would be. She has a new thing about eggs and not eating them because of the brown thin edges so I thought this might be a change for her.  Still didn't eat it.  I thought it was good and simple but I still prefer making breakfast sandwiches.

I've been making eggs in a hole for my family some 60 plus years.  Always a welcome breakfast treat even though they've been served umpteen times and more! Brit household here, and for us, Toad in a hole, or Toad in the hole, is sausages lightly browned, then baked up in yorkshire batter.  Its funny, and quite interesting, how the old favourites end up with so many different names!

Mmmmmm. Never heard of it with cheese over the top before. But, it's good and that's why I had to try it. I used American instead of Cheddar. I do agree, however, that Toad in a Hole uses Yorkshire Pudding. I'll have to try that, too!

I didn't know that this concoction actually had a name until I found it on this website. I used to eat these when I was a poor college student. I agree w/ another reviewer who said that this recipe is good for people who have trouble flipping their eggs.

My son had fun making this. He doesn't like eggs much, but he liked this a lot. He also liked using a cookie cutter to cut out the hole, and sprinkling cheese (I used shredded mozzarella) on top of the bread. I used garlic butter on my slice--yum. For people who had trouble flipping or making this: butter both sides of the bread, and dab a bit of butter on the griddle through the hole in the bread (else the egg may stick). Put the egg in as soon as possible, and then cover with a lid. Use only med-high heat. Note that larger cookie cutter shapes work best--my son wanted to use the one shaped like the gingerbread man, but that probably would not have held the egg.

Yummy!  I flipped and fried on both sides until well done. The cheese ended up on the bottom too and it got brown and bubbly!  It was great.  Thank you.
I couldnt figure out how to keep the yolk a bit runny as I like it that way.  Any ideas?

I thought it was a cute idea.  My nine year old said "what is the big deal, next time just toast some bread and make me an egg".

Great easy morning breakfast!  I skipped on the cheese that way I could cook the egg all the way by flipping the toast and egg half way through!  Will be making this again!

These are great, I have had them since i was a child. To the reviewer who said they were impossible to cook the egg because you cant flip it because of the cheese: you dont put the cheese on until after you flip it, that way you can cook both sides!

My kids love this breakfast. Me, too. Always a comfort since childhood, when my mom would make it for me. I salt/pepper it real good and sometimes, if I have any leftover, I'll use leftover spread from Garlic Bread Fantastique for something different.

I grew up eating this as "eggs in a nest".  My husband had "gasp" NEVER had it!  I did flip it after a cooking a few minutes on one side like others did before adding the cheese.  My husband likes his eggs over medium and this way you can get the egg white cooked, but, still leave the yolk "runny".   This is also a great recipe to make if you have a crowd.  You can just pull out your griddle and line them up!

I also had these growing up. My mom made these for us, except we called them 'Frogs on a log'. Don't forget to toast the 'hole'. We always liked eating the little round pieces of toast. Thanks for the AWESOME flashback!

Mixed reviews over here...my boyfriend, who is British, loved these..I didn't very much. The toast ended up going soggy on me, therefore defeating the whole definition of 'toast'. It is a cute recipe though.

I looked for this recipe remembering my Grandmother making this years ago!  This is how I did it for my kids to make sure the eggs were cooked... Butter both sides of the bread, Cut out with cookie cutter shape.  Then I put the "frame" in the hot skillet.  Crack the egg into the shape.  Let it cook on low to medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Then I flipped the whole thing and let it cook on the other side.  Then I added a slice of cheese and the cut out shape on top.  After the cheese melted, I served it to my kids.  The eggs were totally cooked.

This is a great recipe.  I first had toad in a hole at the Applewood restaurant in Pigeon Forge about 25 years ago.  I'd like to correct the respondent who said that toad-in-a-hole is made with Yorkshire pudding.  She is confusing toad-in-A-hole with toad-in-THE-hole. Two different dishes.

Our whole family loves these! Perfect summer dinner when the chickens are laying eggs like crazy. Here's some words to those that are not so favorable or had some trouble however...
A half pint canning jar or glass will give you a good sized hole. 
Save the cut out bit, also buttered and grilled, to serve perched on top for dunking. In order to do this dish justice the yolks must be soft cooked. Only use the best quality, fresh-fresh-FRESH eggs from either your own chickens or a neighbor's. The key is to use eggs that were laid earlier that day. Supermarket eggs should never be used!
As I only use the best eggs laid that same day for this dish I have no problem serving it to my children. We've never had an issue.
Pumpernickel bread is heavenly in this!
The order in the pan should be bread then egg so that the egg is held in place. I do flip mine before I top it with cheese but this takes some skill, practice and a good spatula.
As to the name, it must be a regional thing because this is traditionally considered toad in a hole here at least. The British toad in a hole also looks delicious so we will try it too.

We called these "frogs in the pond."  We used a cheese glass (you used to buy processed cheese spread in the glass jar and then keep the glass for juice) and grilled the round center with the rest of the dish then use that to dip in the egg yolk.

I prepare this the same way as Mancuso. Shot glass to cut bread, flip it and cook both sides before adding any cheeses if at all.  But a great breakfast on a dreary day.

I have a slight bend on this recipe others may want to try.  Instead of buttering the bread and frying it, I have found that stirring up a couple eggs with a fork in a cake pan and then dipping the bread in the egg mixture (like you would for french toast) and then frying it makes a much moister and easier to fry Toad In A Hole.  I make the whole in the middle after its in the skillet and fry it along with the toast.  Give it a try!!

This is great...We called them " Frog in a Pond ". My kids loved them and my Grands do also! For those that like their eggs a little more done, butter both sides of bread before cutting out the hole, crack egg carefully into hole and fry for bout 2 minutes. then turn the bread over carefully and fry for about another 2 minutes. In the meantime, be frying the circle cutout along side the bread/egg combo.It's just big enough for little hands to pick up and eat on its own or to use to dip into the egg.

Quick and easy. It turned out great. I used a small glass to make the cut. I also like my yolks to be cooked thru, so I broke the yolk slightly and cooked it on both sides.

I suppose my grandmother first made this for me - minus the cheese. My dad called it toad in a hole but I've been corrected by an English friend. I still make this for my grown daughter but I scramble the egg since she doesn't like eggs any other way. Great memories.

I just made one of these for breakfast, and it is awesome! I actually toasted another piece of bread and made a sandwich out of it. Probably not healthy at all, but for a treat it's good! I am not sure why people are having trouble making this...as long as you let it set for long enough on low-medium heat you can easily flip it to toast the other side. Mine came out over-hard, but that's how I like them! :)  Bon Apetit!

I love these. Really buttery but good for an every now &  then treat. I don't use the cheese...it doesn't need it. Just a little salt & pepper.

I make this all the time! my husband and kids love it, its a regular breakfast on the weekends. I do add some kind of cooked meat (bacon, sausage patties, or ham) and add another slice of bread without egg to make it a whole sort of meal in one sandwich. After I fry the egg and add cheese I top that with the meat and bread then flip it over and toast that side like making a grilled cheese.

In one of the pictures I saw French Bread. So I bought a really holey bread and cut in 6-1 1/2" slices. (I did make more holes in the bread, try not to remove the bread though) I scrambled the eggs and added shredded Cheddar. I put all the bread in a pan and poured the egg mixture in each piece of bread. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper after browned and eggs are cooked. I brought this to a football tailgate and heated it up on the grill. Served it with bacon on the side. Delish! And rave reviews!!

5 stars for easiness and creativity!  Because there is nothing extravagant about toast and egg, I can't get myself to give it above a 4.  When I have kids one day though, this is how I will introduce them to cooking, and I will certainly use this method often until then since it is fun :-)  Thanks for the idea!

I had recently seen the film, "V for Vendetta," in which, a similar dish is called, "eggy in a basket." Maybe, it's slightly different, but I think it's a great idea.

This recipe was in the Betty Crocker Children's Cookbook that I got from my Grandma Cross in 1961 and was called "eggs in a frame". I loved it growing up and so did my kids. The recipe in the cookbook says to butter and brown both sides of the bread, and cover the pan so the egg will cook properly. Such a nice memory, thanks.

Wow, this recipe does bring back memories. Its funny how we all call it different things. In Kansas we call it eggs in a basket. lol There shouldn't be any reason why people can't cook this. Its so easy and taste good.

This is a good basic recipe. I buttered both sides of the bread (I used Dutch Hearth sliced French bread - slightly thicker bread seems to hold the egg better). Slapped the bread on the grill and then cracked the egg into it. Cooked on lower heat so the bread didn't burn. I haven't quite mastered the flipping over of the bread - the egg gets a little messy - but it still tastes good. I haven't tried it with the cheese on top yet. Overall, an easy breakfast!

This is great as a small snack! I loved it and so did my mom and my boyfriend likes it too! I didn't use cheese, I just added some salt and pepper instead.. and I used moderate and controlled heat.. I also covered the pan; eggs get cooked better in a covered pan.. yummie! I'm having one right now! (:

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  As I read the instructions I thought, "How will you turn over the egg to make sure it is cooked?"  I was questioning the high heat as well but thought follow the directions.  I should have read the reviews first, like I always do but didn't take the time.  Well....  the bread burnt, the egg couldn't be cooked properly and the top side of the bread was soft bread.  My 6 and 8 year olds were disappointed because they thought eating a "toad" would be fun.  I might try this again but I would lightly grill both sides of the bread, cook it on low heat with a lid and then flip it to be sure the egg was cooked.

A family favorite - we call them 'Poke-outs'.  I make mine this way.  I cut out the hole and then pre-heat a frying pan on medium heat.  I rub a stick of butter the size of the bread slice around the pan until it begins to sizzle, and then very lightly 'toast' one side of the bread.  I flip it after rubbing a little more butter in the pan and then add the egg and cook it until the bread is nicely toasted.  At this point,  the egg white often is not cooked enough for my taste, so I take my chances of breaking the yolk and I flip it, leaving it on the heat for a short time to firm up the white of the egg as when making an over-easy egg.   You can put a lid over it if you don't want to flip it, but that may take away some of the crispness of the toasted bread.  I don't add cheese.  Practice makes perfect with this recipe.

No I did not make any change except made only two 
as I am a widower and lives alone . All recipes with
allrecipes I reduce the recipe down to feed  only two
helpings but I can live with what I can make for myself. 
Thanks for your concern.  Bob Scottow.

I had this recipe as a child, but never thought about adding cheese! I experimented, and my family liked Colby jack cheese. I personally put cheese on it with a little bit of a kick, and that was my winner. I love how quick and delicious this is, even with a picky eater. Yum!!!

I am well into my 60’s and my Dad made these all the time minus the cheese when  I was growing up. He called them bulls eyes. I made them for my kids when they were growing up. Everyone loves them.

Oh, this was such a disappointment!  I should have read the suggestions in the reviews prior to making it.  As they predicted, following your directions gave me only burnt bread and runny eggs.

This recipe was taught to me by my mother in law 35 years ago. I loved it!  She was from Great Britain where the recipe originated. I have been making it for family brunches, kids and grandchildren since then. I hope everyone will try it and fall in love with it too!

These are great breakfast sandwiches that kids love. I don't care if the name is wrong -- if you tell a kid you are making them a toad in a hole they will eat it lol. I use a juice glass to cut out the hole and then toast it in the pan along with the bread slice. I flip the slice halfway through and then if desired put some cheese on top of the cooked side while the other is frying. It's quick, yummy and fun.

I have been looking to make this for some time and read many of the reviews.  I did us a shot glass for the cut out and with mine there is definitely a "presentation" side.  The advice to cook at a lower temp to make sure the egg cooks but the toast doesn't burn is key.  When I flipped the bread the first time I did drop a little butter in the hole, then added the egg.  The egg white did not all fit in the hole but that is ok, remember you are going to flip it again to cook that side of the egg.  Thank you for the fun recipe!

Perhaps not the most detailed recipe, but I wanted to point out that this dish DOES go by the name Toad in a Hole, as well as Toad in the Hole, Frog in the Hole, and Eggs in a Basket, etc. etc. It is not the same as the British pudding with sausages, obviously, but it is a name variant, not a mis-named recipe.

These are so easy and quick to make in the morning, I can even manage them before school. I also do not use the cheese, but my kids enjoyed the addition.

I liked this version with the added cheese. My only issue is with the directions. I didn’t keep the pan on high heat, but moved it between med-high and med. I put the butter in the pan and cracked the egg into the hole. Once it was grilled and the egg set a bit, I flipped the whole thing and grilled the other side. I flipped one more time and put the cheese on top. The little grilled center piece was great for dipping in the egg yolk.

Simple and yum - a favourite from childhood though I never had cheese with mine. To Diane and anyone else who says this is not Toad in the Hole, this is toad in the hole (at least it is in Australia). I'm also familiar with the old English recipe but to many, many Aussies (and possibly other nationalities) this is the Toad in the Hole recipe we grew up with so giving it a low rating because you're not familiar with this version is not really fair. You might even find you quite like this one :)

I just made this recipe, and it was amazing! Instead of letting the egg cook through on its own (I'm impatient) I simply put on the bread round then flipped it. It's a bit messier, and the yolk broke, but the rest of the uncooked white coated the underside of the bread and made it fry just the same.

Great recipe.  I made a slight modification.  I toasted the bread in the toaster, poached the eggs then made a poached egg sandwich on toast.  Oh yeah I left off the cheese.

My mother used to make this for me all the time as a kid. We never had a name for them, but they were always a great addition to the breakfast table. We also used the fun-shaped cookie cutters, like Christmas trees in the winter time, hearts in February, etc.

I love this recipe.  We called these "Bird nests" when I was a kid.  I still make them for my kids, and we even put maple syrup on them.  I also butter both sides of the bread. I've never tried them with cheese before.  I would flip it first and then put the cheese on it.  Otherwise the egg would be too runny for me.

We call this "bird in a nest".  It's very quick and simple to make, we don't add any cheese.  Once the egg is cooked one side you can flip it over if you like you eggs harder.

My mom made this for us 5 kids growing up-we loved them! We called them "Egg in a basket".I continued to make them the rest of my life and for my daughter & still do frequently.Make your hole with a juice glass,butter both sides plus the bisquit holes,drop in your egg,season with S & P,or anything else,medium heat,flip it and cook to your desired like.There's nothing hard about this other than keeping an eye on how you want your egg cooked.Its a whimsical breakfast...I dont add cheese because I want to cook both sides..yummy!

I make these at hunting camp for the hunters.  I use slice the butter and put it down right before the bread then put the egg in.  The butter flavors the toast and cooks the egg.  Perfect they get their toast and egg all in one!

OK, I have made this for a long time. My kids loved them when they were small. We call it "egg in a frame". Butter both sides of the bread before cutting out the hole. I scramble the egg before adding it to the bread. Cook on one side until done to your liking then flip and cook other side. Add whatever items you would like and season it to your liking. To all the people who rated it 1 star, it's a pretty easy item to make so if you have to follow a recipe to the "T" maybe you shouldn't be cooking. Use some common sense.

I just tried this recipe ... I used Nutty Oat bread, buttered both sides and cut a whole in the middle.  I then grilled first side, flipped it over, added the egg, salt and peppering the egg. I grilled the flipped side of bread shortly then covered the pan until egg was almost done.  Flipped the bread again to insure that the egg white was set.  I did add a slice of American cheese, but felt it was too cheesy.  Next time, I think I will add a little shredded cheese (cheddar, swiss, or marblejack).  This was a little bland ... need to season the egg with some kind of herb seasoning or a pinch of 6 pepper blend or hot sauce!  I will try this recipe again with my own variations!

This is also a great recipe for feeding a crowd. Push the bread butter side up into greased muffin tins. Crack in an egg, and bake at 400 degrees ( or broil)until the bread is toasted and eggs are done. 
Never had it with cheese before. Thanks

This is called Eggs in a Basket not Toad in a Hole.  Its best made with a freshly sliced loaf of sourdough bread cooked in bacon grease - like English fried bread.

These were great!  The whole family loved them.  I did have to flip them though in order to cook the egg all the way without burning the bread.  Even better with a thick slice of Italian bread.

I dont get the purpose of these. I made them, and while it tasted good, I just felt like it took more time then frying an egg and toasting bread. I also had to flip mine to get it to cook evenly. It is really cute, but no worth the time.

Wow this one took me back, Eggs in a Hold from my parts. This was one of the first recipes my mom taught me out of her Betty Crocker. I butter both sides of the bread just like with my grilled cheese sammys. Never tried the cheese before though, nice touch. Great to do on a camping trip! (Often have ^^)

These were good but the bottom burnt a little bit. That was most likely my fault though.

Like the last review, I think this just doesn't work the way it says.  It seems you would have to adjust the cooking methods in order to get your egg cooked well.  I cook a lot, but I couldn't get this to come out right and I ended up causing a lot of smoke and some burnt bread.  When it did come out, it tasted ok, but definately not worth all of the work.  Like a previous review said, I think it makes more sense to just fry up an egg and put it on toast.

My mother has used this recipe forever!  It is GREAT!  My nieces and nephews absolutely love it!  It is not hard at all to make, the worst cook can sucessfully make this!  :-)  We call it Eggs in a Basket though!
