As the submitter of this recipe It’s important to note the amount of broccoli should be 10 ounces (thawed frozen, chopped broccoli may be used just make sure the excess water is drained off) and please do NOT use oil to grease the casserole dish. Non stick cooking spray should be used.

Hello, Allrecipes.  In English, the adjectives precede the nouns.  Who in the world came up with this ingredient list?  The recipe is great.  The list of ingredients is beyond odd.

Love the ease of making it ... the taste is pretty darned good ... but mine was SUPER FLAT. 

Only way I deviated from the recipe was I cooked my broccoli in my Instant Pot. (Put broccoli on trivet, one cup of water in the bottom (2 if 8 quart), set to pressure cook for 0 minutes, QR).

Not sure why it is flat, but I kinda like anyway! HA! I'm curious how it will come out when I make it again, because I will make it again.

I will definitely make this recipe again. It tastes like a delicious quiche without the crust! Only substitutions/changes were Country Crock for the butter olive oil for the vegetable oil and took one egg yolk out but used all the albumen. Very delicious!!!

Loved this and so easy to fix! It is also relatively low carb and high in protein!

Made it as stated but changed eggs to Eggbeaters and oil for butter to reduce cholesterol. I made it just for myself because I wasn’t sure my husband would like it. He asked if he could try it - sure. His next words were ‘can you make this again soon?’ I will! But I will double the broccoli. It has enough seasoning and cheese to hand the extra veggies.

I loved it!   While I like cottage cheese I have never used it in a broccoli casserole but now I probably always will!  I made no changes and it turned out fantastic.

Unfortunately this just didn’t work. I followed the recipe exactly. The problem I have with this recipe is that the egg and cheese bind together but not with the broccoli so it tasted as if I had scrambled eggs and cheese , and then mixed in a handful of broccoli. The  taste was not  worth the calories .  I would probably just make a nice cheese sauce  next time.

Tasted really good.  Mine was quite flat though.  I may have used too much broccoli.  Not sure. However I really liked it and will make it again.
