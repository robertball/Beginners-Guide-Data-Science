I LOVE EGGNOG!!! I’ve never made it but I’m glad that I gave it a shot! This recipe is easy to follow and tastes almost exactly like my favorite brand. I tasted it first and then I added a shot and a half of my favorite cream bourbon. Either way you try it, you will be very pleased. Thanks for an awesome recipe!
