Everytime I make this cake for work I go home with an empty pan.  However, I prefer to use cream cheese frosting.  It goes very well with this cake.  1 package of cream cheese, 1 box of powdered sugar, 1 tbsp. butter and 1/2 tsp. almond extract

When I found this recipe I was so excited! I love the chocolate version of Texas sheet cake and this one is just as great! I like to make one chocolate and one white for summer outdoor barbecues. If you've never made a Texas sheet cake before, you will doubt the odd preparation method and probably be concerned that there is no possibility that it will turn out when you see the runny batter, but don't worry!! It will be a moist, tender cake. Also, be SURE to use the 10 x 15 pan, NOT a 9 x 13 or it won't cook properly. It's *supposed* to be flat. I love the warm icing spread over the warm cake, no waiting for anything to cool! It makes a smooth, attractive cake surface too. Anybody I've ever served this to has been impressed by the flavor and moistness even if it's not fancy. But NOT for the timid sweet tooth! It's definitely sweet!

First, let's be clear about what this is: It's a white sheet cake. I was reading some complaints about it being flavorless, but white cakes aren't supposed to taste like anything but sugar. If you want something else, try a spice cake. I've also seen complaints that it's falt, but it's a sheet cake. It's supposed to be flat. I'm giving this cake 5 stars because it is excellent at what it is -- a moist white cake and a vehicle for icing.

PAN SIZE IS ESSENTIAL!!!    If you make this cake in a size other than indicated, you will have a failure.  If you choose to do that, do NOT rate the recipe poorly.  Texas sheet cakes are *supposed* to be flat, moist, dense, and sweet.  If you try to make it be something it's not, you'll be disappointed (and that will not be the fault of the recipe).

I've introduced my part of the world to Texas Sheet Cake and it was very well-received.  Quick to prepare, moist, nice flavor.  I've made it with both almond and vanilla extract, both times it went quickly.  We did find it way too sweet so the 2nd time around I reduced the sugar in the cake to 1.5 cups and for the frosting used one third cup of butter and a bit less than 4 cups of confectioner's sugar.

I. LOVE. THIS. CAKE.

I've always made the chocolate version of Texas sheet cakes and like others had no CLUE there was a white version, but Diane, YOU my new little friend are just the BEST!

I discovered this recipe just recently and have already tried several variations, with great success with every modification I might add. My first go-round, I needed a white cake for Church, something basic to go under a white cream cheese frosting to decorate with black musical notes. Little hesitant with the almond so used half almond, half vanilla on the extracts. Everyone loved it, so that weekend when family came over for the Super Bowl I tried the recipe as written. Realizing "as written" could mean walnuts OR pecans, I opted for 
pecans and all almond extract. Rave reviews was an UNDERSTATEMENT!  Made it several times since then too. (You'd like to think I have no other dessert recipes, lol!)

Making it again tonight to be used as a dessert after our youth's Spaghetti Dinner fundraiser tomorrow.  Will be trying sprinkles instead of nuts this time since it'll be mostly kids in attendance.  I was actually asked to bring a "box cake" but why 
use a BOX when you have a recipe like THIS!  It's quick, SO easy, versatile and quite adaptable. The best part is it's mostly ingredients you already have on hand.  Not one single "con" I can think of...it's just the perfect cake just the way it's written here!

Diane, thanks SO MUCH for sharing...needless to say, for me, this one's a KEEPER!

Very flat, very terrible, bland, wet, just overall yuk. Before I bake every cake from scratch I always check out the ratings.  I am a cake decorator and bake cakes from scratch. Its just too wet and flat to sell to my customers.
If anyone out there has a better recipe please let me know. Thank you.

It's been so long I've been looking for such a cake, not knowing a "white Texas sheet cake" existed. Wonderful the way it is, but I may "play" with different tastes and flavours, depending on the extract used (vanilla, orange, lemon, coconut, whatever). Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This cake is a favorite at our house! I have a family that is not so wild about almond, so I make it for them with vanilla extract.  I also omit the nuts per my kids' request.

My husband insisted this cake was too sweet. My three year old daughter who usually is a sugarholic like myself, wouldn't touch this cake after the first bite. Personally, I love this cake! But I want to accurately reflect the opinions of my family in this review. What I might do is make this cake again and lessen the sugar content (especially in the icing) and then sneak it to them again.

If your favorite drink is Pepsi, you will probably like this. But if you are a "water drinker" who occasionally makes a cake, this will probably be too sweet for your liking (me).

I followed the recipe to the "T". And it turned out flat. There was no rise to this cake. And the taste was bland. I made it as a birthday cake for husband boy was I embarassed. I had to make two of them just to give the cake some height.

Excellent cake. It was a big hit. Easy to make. My batter was pretty thick going into the pan, but it turned out great. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

After a fair amount of mediocre baking experiences lately, this was a welcome and refreshing surprise!  Moist and sweet and dense and delicious - and the almond flavoring was just the right amount! They're pretty too. I didn't use the frosting, however, since I had some of my own favorite buttercream frosting left from another baking day - and it had vanilla flavoring, no almond, and I liked it that way.  I made half a recipe in a 9x9 inch pan, but a 7x11 inch pan would work well too.  These are going to be a hit tonight when I serve them!

This is one of the most requested treats that I make.  It is a great large quantity /potluck recipe.  Lots of people have tried the chocolate version & have never tried the almond one.  I always take home an empty pan.

Great cake!!! I love Chocolate Texas Sheet Cake so had to try this. Loved it. I did add a little vanilla extract along with the almond extract to the cake. Used Pecans instead of walnuts because I like :-)I think next time I would like to use Maple extract w/Pecan. I think that would be a GREAT combo :-)

I find the reviews stating the cake is "flat" strange. Texas sheet cake is supposed to be flat!! It's more like a cake-y brownie, but definitely should not taste like a brownie. This recipe is great as is. It is sweet, but so is the chocolate version.

I love chocolate Texas sheet cake, so I thought I'd try the white version. I thought it was very good, although I did not care for the almond flavoring. Next time I'll just use vanilla. For those having trouble with the frosting spreading properly, it is imperative that both the cake and frosting be warm when spreading. Also, for those who think the cake is too thin, it's a sheet cake made in a sheet pan. It's supposed to be thin.

I use this recipe for cupcakes and they turn out great! They're easy to frost and decorate (I use a buttercream frosting) and don't crumble when eaten like a cake mix does!

This was good.  I frosted it with Caramel Frosting I from this site.  I highly recommend the frosting!  I'm not sure the directions on this are just as they should be.  Next time I will mix the dry ingredients only in a large mixing bowl and then pour the melted butter mixture over it and mix till combined.  At this point the eggs, sour cream and almond extract should be added.  I think it might make a difference in the quality of the cake.

I did not bake this in a 10x15x1 pan only because we do not own a pan of this size.  And despite chellebelle's review I went ahead and baked it in a 9x13 anyway because another reviewer said hers turned out just fine.  Even the time she suggested of 43min @ 350 seemed to be right on the mark for my 9x13.  (BTW, "Thank You, CathyW, I am glad I took your advice.")  It worked perfectly.  It reminds me of Pineapple Upside Down cake w/out the pineapples.  It's sticky and very scrumptious.  The icing, however, didn't work out so well, too runny for me.  Instead I used a whipped topping w/ a drop of banana extract and just placed a dollop on my slice, YUM CITY!  Thanks Diane for submitting this recipe, I will consider this for birthdays in the future.

i thought this was delicious! i halved the recipe.. baked it in a 8x8" pan and made my own icing by using brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla and a touch of water to thin it out.. it was great and made a nice sugary topping.

This cake is very moist and great tasting!  It got rave reviews at the party I brought it to.  It was some what of a  novelty dessert, as no one had ever heard of a white texas sheet cake.  I did cut back on the sugar in the cake to 1 and 3/4 cups after reading that some reviewers found it to be too sweet.  I will be printing this one and putting it in my favorite recipes book!

Love this as is - my mom made this a lot growing up just like this recipe and it's one of my favorite cakes - you can definitely taste the almond, which I love, so if you don't like almond this may not be for you.  I think it's terrific!

OK, you just can't beat this cake. It's quick to make, it tastes great and it serves a crowd. It's not real pretty to look at, but that's not always the goal of good cooking. I made the recipe as it is written, except that I used a chocolate icing from "Texas Sheetcake I" instead of the one in the recipe. This is one to add to your list of go-to cake recipes.

It was okay.  I will try it again.  Maybe I didn't follow the directions correctly.

We were meeting the new man in DD's life and I needed a dessert to stand up to a good cup of coffee or a tall glass of milk. Not to mention ingredients I had on hand! This filled that need very well. The cake is easy, moist, great flavor and no frills. "Mr. Wonderful" commented that he knew DD was a great cook and after dinner and this dessert, he knew why! Yep, he's a , er, the cake is a keeper!! Made it early yesterday AM and DH just finished the last piece with the comment that he wouldn't mind if I did this one again! he will not be disappointed.  Thank you for sharing.

Hands down the best white cake I have ever tasted. I made this for my husband’s birthday party. I was asked for the recipe repeatedly. I did add a lot of milk to the icing as I found it was too thick. I also made the cake with vanilla extract. I used a hot knife to spread the icing.

I was overall pleased with this recipe. I love almond, but I might add some vanilla extract with the almond next time. I cut the recipe for the cake in half. I also cut the icing recipe in half but it wasn't enough to cover the cake which I baked on a 13 x 9.5 baking sheet. I would recommend making 3/4 of the icing recipe if baking on that size pan. I baked at 350 for 18 minutes until my cake was golden in color.

This was very easy to prepare but it turned out just awful.  I followed the recipe exactly, including the right size pan.  It tested done and was golden brown but it was no where near as thick as the cake in the photo. The cake layer was only about a centimeter thick. The icing layer was thicker than the cake. I served it at a potluck. My 6 yr. old who loves any cake couldn't even eat it. I took a taste and my best friend was kind enough to take a taste too but no one else would touch it. It was a big flop!

Honestly, I don't understand why I kept trying to get this recipe right. At 1st I thought it was my flour, so I had run and get more. 4x I tried to get this right. No luck. And it didn't even taste right after I finally got it correct.  Sorry. I wished it was all my error, but I make loads of cakes weekly by scratch and it didn't work for me at all. Sorry

I used this recipe as the base for a Coconut Poke Cake (recipe by Leslie on allrecipes.)  I added 2 teaspoons of baking powder and used 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead of the almond extract and baked it in a 13 x 9" pan at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  I made two of them for dessert at a large gathering.  It received rave reviews!!  I will use this recipe again!!

It is a sheet cake folks.  It is supposed to be flat!  Otherwise, it is very sweet and moist.  I have made it for all sorts of events and always bring home an empty pan.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Cake was awesome, followed the recipe to a T and It turned out great. I will definitely be making this one for summer picnics. I also used a 10x15 pan greased and floured.

had this recipe saved forever and finally tried it and i am so glad i did! i made it just like the recipe said, and it turned out fantastic. i thought i had overbaked it at 20 minutes because it looked so dark brown on the edges, but i didn't. it just cooks like that. it turned out really moist and flavorful. i will be making this many times i am sure in the future.

I love the taste of this cake, and how easy it was to make. I have made this cake twice.  The first time it turned out great, but with family heart problems, it has WAY too much saturated fat - even for a cake.  The second time I made it, I made the following modifications:  I used 1/2 c Grape Seed Oil in place of 1 cup of butter.  I "upped" the water to 1 1/2 cups and I reduced the sugar in the batter to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added 1 tsp of baking powder due to the altitude where we live - the first time I made it, it was a bit flat)  I also only made 1/2 the icing (but I did use butter for this).  No one in my family even noticed the difference!!  Try it and see!

First of all - this is not a WHITE cake in either color or flavor.  It's VERY yellow and even tastes like yellow cake.  In fact, it's a very weird yellow - almost greenish. The whole process of making the batter was odd and after I added the flour, I couldn't stir out the lumps - even with a whisk. So there were small white flour lumps in the batter. The frosting was not good.  It was kind of oily & grainy and you better frost the cake right after you make the frosting because it sets up quickly into a fudge like state. The frosting really didn't taste bad but the texture was horrible. I don't recommend this cake. Keep searching!

Cake is a little on the sweet side, but not bad.  Very moist.  I think the chocolate version is a little better. It is very quick and easy to make.

Great cake, yummy! Fast and easy to make. I goofed the first time I made the cake, forgot the baking soda.  My kids thought it was good even if it was flat!  Didn't take me very long to make if over.  My family wouldn't let me throw out the flat cake, they ate it anyway.

Tried this recipe because I was stuck at home with no car today and I was in the mood to bake. Tweaked the ingredients a bit due to being short on a couple things, but turned out AWESOME!I did not add nuts and incorporated cream cheese since I ran out of butter/margarine with the cake batter. I also did not have the 4 cups of confectioner's sugar required for the icing so instead of fluffy like in the picture, it was more of a glaze. I also added vanilla instead of almond extract to the icing. Definitely recommend this!! Great thing is you can add or supplement with something else or just add additional ingredients!

Since first discovering this recipe earlier this year, I have made this cake several times changing nothing except a little less icing.Because it is so sweet, a small slice is sufficient.  Cake is very moist.Can't imagine it without the almond which makes the flavor pop. Pairs nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a simple but delicious dessert. (White on white is a statement in itself) Great also for a shower or Mother 's Day.

As a Texan and southerner, I've baked and eaten a lot of sheet cakes. This is DELICIOUS. Period. For those of you not familiar with this type of cake, it's supposed to be flat. The frosting here is terrific as well, but I prefer a simple butter cream. Thanks to Diane Kester!

When we first made this cake it was amazing. The best cake I have ever tasted. The icing was especially perfect, but I added a small amount of water, just for a more creamier sort of mix. Overall, an amazing cake recipe. I will be using this recipe from now on.

Everyone loved this cake. It has a nice almond flavor to it and since it is sweet by itself, I just topped with whipped cream and berries. I had to make it twice within a month!

Good.  I ended up making three rounds instead of one sheet cake.  Simple, and tasty.  Very mild flavor - great for a flavorful icing.  I think next time I'd try a rich chocolate icing to top it off - that would be scrumptious.

fantastic cake BUT I would ease it on the conf sugar. I only use 2 cups for the frosting and 1 and 3/4 cup of regular sugar in the batter.

I made this for a holiday party last weekend and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the nuts.  Instead I sprinkled praline pieces on the top of the cake.  I will definitely keep making this.

Very tasty but the frosting puts it over the top sweet for me and I like sweet. The walnuts do help to cut the sweetness but not enough so would suggest a lower sugar option for frosting such as not too sweet whipped cream or a cream cheese frosting or just a simple glaze. I didn't have the right size pan so just used a 13 X 9 at 350 for about half an hour. Worked fine but next time I make I will do a different frosting.

I've made this cake twice, with great sucess both times.  I have always liked the chocolate Texas sheet cake, but I prefer white cake myself, so was overjoyed to find this good recipe.

One of my favorites! A wonderful moist cake with a subtle almond flavor. I use nuts on half the cake so that those who prefer "no" nuts can enjoy it.

I thought this cake very moist if you make it the day before then frost it. I also used vanilla nut flavoring because that's all I had and it still had a good flavor. Though it is sweet its great with a glass of milk .I will make this cake again-

The family was very happy with this, it is a moist and easy cake...a happy change up from chocolate sheet cake and perfect for a casual get together. I did back off the sugar 1/2 cup and also the almond extract for the children's sake. Frosted with chocolate. The husband said "Why have we been eating other cakes than this one?". Thank you for a lovely white Texas sheet cake!!

First, this cake is yellow, not white.  This cake was also flat, gummy, and not edible.  I followed this cake recipe exactly as written.  The batter was very running, but after reading the reviews, I wasn't concerned.  I put it in a 15 X 10 as specified.  After 20 minutes of baking, the cake tested done and the edges were browned.  After cooling for 20 minutes I cut into it and it was as many reviewers have said - the cake was wet, gummy and flat. Very disappointed.  I have used many cake recipes from the All Recipes sight and never had a problem with a 5 rated recipe before.  I will not be making this one again.

I did not use the frosting, so I cannot speak for the entire recipe, but the cake itself was excellent- very moist.  I doubled the recipe to use in an 11x17 pan (greased and floured), then torted to fill with fresh strawberry mango filling, and topped with vanilla-almond buttercream and fondant.  The cake held together very well when I torted it which had been a concern since it was quite a big size.  I will definitely be adding this to my arsenal!

This cake was easy to make and makes a huge quantity. My mom said the frosting has a little too much almond flavor, but I may have over done it. I would cut back on the amount of walnuts in the frosting because it makes it thick and hard to spread as it cools fast. There is just a enough frosting to cover the cake.

Perfect. Nom nom nom! This cake is so easy to make.     My daughters (10 and 4) "helped", and it came out perfectly. Thank you! We had made fudge that didn't quite set up, so we warmed it up and used it as frosting. This cake lasted only a couple days!

Tried this with some minor adjustments. The first time with half vanilla extract and half almond, the second time with all vanilla. Both times, DELISH, rave reviews and no leftovers :o) Oh, and I also omitted the walnuts... just wanted plain white cake! YUM!

"It was a rainy day, too wet to go outside. Mommy said 'Let's make cupcakes. What colour would you like?'. 'Pink!' I said. 'Pink! Pink! Pink!'". Needless to say it was a rainy day, too wet to go outside and after reading one of my little girl's favourite books, Mommy had to consult AR to find a recipe for cupcakes that could be made pink. Pink! Pink! Pink! ;)

Cake was great but the frosting was way too thick when following the given directions.  I added approximately 1/4 cup more milk, one Tablespoon at a time until it was thinned enough to spread over the cake.  Other than that, a fantastic cake that is super easy to make.

Made cupcakes.  Very sweet batter, and very yummy & moist!  I made them for a cake-decorating class I was taking.  Pretty sweet with buttercream frosting on top.  These were yummy with no frosting at all!

This recipe is excellent...very yummy! I make the chocolate version quite often and love it.   I would like to say to the people who tried this recipe and then complained that it was "flat"...it is suppose to be.  I never call this cake when I bake it, I call them brownies and serve it that way.  It is not a "cake" in the traditional sense.  I never have a crum leftover, ever!

This cake is DELICIOUS! I'm eating mine fresh out of the oven as we speak and I'm telling you, it's the best white cake I've ever baked. The bottom of the cake that was left in the pan was good as well! The top is buttery and sweet, this cake doesn't even need any icing (I'm eating the cake as is, no icing anyway, I didn't feel like making any).   I'll admit that I had my reservations about baking this cake since one of the ingredients was a good bit of water and I thought about substituting the water with milk but changed my mind and decided to go along with that part of the recipe as is and I'm glad I did.   However, I did make a couple of changes: I substituted the almond extract with vanilla and the baking soda with baking powder. I personally don't like using baking soda when I'm baking cakes and usually always use baking powder anyway. Since I had a half cup of butter softened already and not a whole cup I simply halved the entire recipe to make a smaller cake since it was just for me tonight to satisfy a cake craving.  My cake didn't really rise that much as others' said, but I care more about the taste than a big hunk of cake that won't taste good. I say unless you're baking a cake just for appearances this is the one! Thanks for posting this recipe! :-D

This is a great change from the traditional Texas Sheet cake. Only change....I didn't add the almond I added vanilla instead. This is a yummy recipe! If your family likes sheet cake they will love this. It's my non-chocolate cake lovers fav.

Good Stuff!!  I was a little nervous to make this--a white Texas Sheet Cake??  Really??  Oh yeah, so good!!  Followed recipe until adding nuts to icing--I toasted coconut instead.  Came out perfect.  Other reviewers complained about the cake not rising--it's a SHEET cake, it's not supposed to rise!  I also saw complaints about it being too sweet/rich.  This is another trait of sheet cake, maybe cut smaller pieces...  Great recipe, with lots of room to experiment...using vanilla or lemon.  Can't wait to try them all.  Thanks for sharing :-)

I reduced this recipe in half for me and my husband. I cooked it in a 9X9 square pan. It was yummy. He is not fond of almond flavor, but I love it. Next time I will use vanilla instead for him. It is quick and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so good and so rich. I love white cake, and I love almond extract, so the recipe is right up my alley. I seriously doubt I will ever make a boxed cake again. It is so rich and so good! Much to my dismay, when I went to get my sour cream out of the fridge, I realized I was out! So, I used 1/2 cup milk instead, and that's it, because I was also out of vinegar, had no yogurt or any kind of sour cream substitute whatsoever! But, it still turned out great. I'll make this many times!

I am a huge fan of the chocolate version of this recipe but this one is almost too sweet for me. I made it twice. Once using all vanilla and the second time using all almond flavoring. I liked the almond better but it's still SUPER rich. I also used pecans on top and that helped cut the sweetness. You will need to mix them into the frosting when it's hot though. Otherwise, they won't stick to the frosting. Like the chocolate version, it's important to frost the cake when the cake AND frosting are hot. Then the frosting isn't too thick as some other reviewers mentioned. I used a 9x13 in. cake pan and baked for 43 min. at 350. If you're using a foil pan it only takes 39. Make sure you have a cold glass of milk and limit your portions and this cake will be a hit!

I have used the chocolate version of this for years... I had never thought of doing it without!  I decided to use lemon flavoring and lemon zest in the cake instead of the almond.  Then put lemon juice, zest and flavoring in the icing.  It made a super lemon cake... might try it with strawberry next time!  Thank you Diane Kester for posting this recipe and giving me some super ideas!

Delicious! The chocolate version of this cake has long been popular with our family, so I thought it would be a good idea to try this. However, both versions of this cake should be made in a jelly roll pan, 15x10!  If not, your cake won't be as good.  This cake is flat, dense, very moist and just overall wonderful!  I've made it with almond extract and subbed vanilla one time; I think the family enjoyed the vanilla-flavored version the best.  The cake certainly gets moister as it sits - but you don't have to make it early, it's great both ways.

This cake is so rich and delicious, that it is the one that everyone at work requests for any kind of party, and every single birthday! If you haven't tried it, you should. I use a 1/2 sheet pan for 40 servings, and instead of walnuts, I toast sliced almonds and add them to the icing. The best EVER!!!

This is really good, but very sweet...  I cut down the sugar in the cake by half a cup and the sugar in the frosting by 1 cup.  Also used sliced almonds in the frosting instead of walnuts.  Family loved it and it didn't last long.

This was awful.  I am a Texan, born and raised and never heard of a Texas Sheet Cake, so I gave it a try.  Made it for Christmas.  Five adults tried it, all said it wasn't good, to be nice. 
Threw it out the next day.

I LOVE the chocolate version of Texas Sheet Cake and was a little skeptical but this is awesome. I made it for Christmas Eve and got many compliments. I didn't use the walnuts in the icing. I melted green and red white chocolate and drizzled it on the icing which gave it a festive look. I did follow the reviews and cut back on the sugar which was a must because it was sweet enough the way it was. Don't skip the almod flavoring. It is a great addition.

Nice taste but incredibly sweet and I even cut down on the sugar from 2 cups to about a cup and a half.  But then again, what do you expect from a cake that calls for three sticks of butter, two cups of sugar and an entire box of confectioners sugar?  I wanted to try something different, and it indeed was.  I omitted the nuts, also.  Like I said, it did have a nice taste but there are many other desserts to indulge in for the amount of fat and calories found in this cake.

Excellent recipe. I made a white texas sheet cake and a chocolate texas sheet cake. The white one was the clear winner. I had many people ask for the recipe.

This cake tasted good, sure, and after 22 minutes it definitely tested done. toothpick came out clean and everything. however, when i cut into it, it was still raw inside, and gummy. It was very dissapointing, although it had a nice flavor. 
it baked very unevenly.
i will definitely not make this recipe again.

First of all, any kind of Texas sheet cake is SUPPOSED to be flat.  Second, I'm not sure about the color- not very appealing.  It's kind of a funky yellow color, so I don't know where the white came from in the name.  This cake is SWEET SWEET SWEET.  I think next time I will try the cream cheese frosting that was recommended in another review to cut down the sweet

Fabulous!!!!  Made 4 layers of this cake for 75 people, but didn't do the frosting listed. Instead did 2 layers of a vanilla almond buttercream frosting, 1 layer of raspberry jelly, and then a whipped cream topping swirled with raspberry jelly. The result was a delicious almond flavored spectacular cake!!! It was a dense cake but didn't mind at all. Highly recommend you try it!

I also let the mixture cool before adding it to the rest the cake ingredients; so the cake won't turn out gummy. Then I mixed it in just a little and added the rest of the ingredients.

The first time I made it, I was distracted and forgot the baking soda!  Ended up with a soft and delicious sheet cookie... my family ate every morsel! Then I made another one with baking soda. Awesome cake! FYI, I halved the recipe (because we made pigs of ourselves on the sheet cookie) and made it in a 9 x 9 pan.

Our family has eaten the chocolate version of this sheet cake for years but my husband has an allergy to chocolate so I cannot even have it in our house. The first recipe someone gave me for the white version had coconut in it and that's not our favorite. When I ran on to this recipe here on allrecipes.com I was excited to make it right away and was not disappointed! I made it exactly as written and found it to be moist and delicious. I'll be making this for years to come! It will be our standard birthday cake from now on!

So far so good, sure did whip together easily.  Looks great for todays potluck. To be sure, do what you normally do with cakes, mix your dry ingredients together (I did cut back almost 1/2 cup sugar), froth up your eggs and add sour cream. Temper the egg mixture with the hot mixture a bit before combining them.  I did add about 3/4 tsp. baking powder to my dry ingredients for a little extra rise. Icing was too thick to spread without tearing the cake, so just added some milk a Tbs at a time until it was spreadable. It only took 2-3 Tbs of milk. I added more pecans than a cup. Almond is such a strong flavoring, I cut it a bit with vanilla.  Will let y'all know how it tastes later. Potluck tonight!

This is so delicious,  so easy, and not to sweet! We couldn't wait to try it. Also can't wait to try chocolate version. Too sweet? No! It's dessert!  And yes, it's flat, it's sweet, just what is supposed to be. I did half the frosting without nuts.

This recipe produced a wonderful cake.  My family is small so I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 glass pan.  I made a quick cream cheese icing and sprinkled walnuts over the top.  It was even better the next day.

The cake is very moist and has a great almond flavor. Next time I will add a little more milk or cream to the frosting; my family thought it was too sweet.  Perhaps adding cream cheese as another reviewer mentioned would help the frosting not taste quite so sweet.

Fantastic cake. I used cool whip cream cheese prepackaged frosting (I typically hate and refuse to use canned frosting) on the cooled cake for the sake of time. It was SO delicious. Wonderful cake base recipe. My chocolate loving daughter thought this was better than the chocolate version!

I made this recipe up last week and while it didn't come out white, it really got rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe for a larger cookie sheet.  I cut the cake in half to make a layer cake and used raspberry jam for the filling. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I'll make this cake again for sure.

I made this for my Husbands birthday. His mom always makes a chocolate version for everyone's birthday, and I thought I would try something new. He  doesn't like too much chocolate, whereas I am a chocolate nut! In that aspect it turned out amazing and delicious! The only aspect that I didn't expect was my family, who critiqued it as having a "weird" taste. After reviewing some of the other comments, I realized my family apparently does not like almond extract, being used to only vanilla. Oddly, I won't change it the next time I make it, because we loved the subtle difference. They just won't get any=P

This is a much easier method for making a cake doing in a pot on the stove...let me tell you. You can change it up too--one way is with lemon glaze for icing and vanilla or lemon instead of almond extract in cake. I do cut the sugar for cake in half though because glaze so sweet. I like it better. Delish!

I made this according to directions for a party. I didn't care for it because I thought the almond extract was just too much. But a friend of mine loved it. So I guess like everything it's subject to taste.

I really enjoyed this cake! I was sitting here after dinner craving something sweet.I wanted to bake something that was fast and easy to prepare and this fit the bill!! It is a very dense cake but in a good way! tastes moist not wet...lol as some users said! My only changes were I used pecans instead of walnuts and for the frosting i used half butter half cream cheese! Excellent!!! I will use this recipe again for sure!!

I thought it was a strange way to mix a cake but I followed the instructions exactly as written. The cake turned out heavy and flat and a strange yellow. I couldn't use it for a birthday. I had to bake another cake from another recipe.

This has to be one of the easiest and most moist white cakes I’ve tried. I cook for a correctional halfway house and am always looking for ideas to cook up. I tripled the recipe to make enough for a large sheet tray and it easily served the 50 residents here. The cake made a big hit with them all. The suggestion that about adding more milk to the frosting was spot on though. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this cake!  I changed the frosting - left out almond extract and added a tablespoon of vanilla instead, and left out walnuts.  THE BEST!!

I like this cake very much I sometimes use vanilla extract in place of the almond extract in the icing. My mom says since it is very sweet and rich she makes only half a batch of icing for the cake. I also have a neighbor who bakes texas sheet cakes in a regular rectangular cake pan probably for height but she may bake it longer than the given time but not sure.

I've had a hard time finding a moist white cake recipe from scratch and hoped this one would be good, since I love the chocolate version of Texas sheet cake.  It's a winner!! Thanks for a great recipe!  I did make the cake as instructed, except I used buttermilk instead of sour cream. I topped it with my own homemade chocolate frosting to accomodate the teenage boys in the house.  They had a hard time stopping themselves from eating the whole cake by themselves. I'll make this over and over.

This is easily the most popular recipe on my cooking blog.  It is absolutely delicious--or, as I like to say, "It's frantastic!" I cut down on the almond extract just a bit to balance it with the vanilla.  You will not find a moister cake!  As I said in my posting of it on my blog, "Saying this cake is moist is like saying the Atlantic Ocean is wet!"

Just baked this, great texture &	moisture. Sour cream had expired so I used low fat vanilla yogart & 11/2 t vanilla. Loved the quickness of it and my husband loved the taste. Will make this again. Goin to try substituting some brown sugar in with the butter stage along with confectioners sugar for a caramel frosting.

Amazing!  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the icing is so sweet.  I still enjoyed it, but I would like the icing to be less sweet.  The cake itself is moist and delicious!

I made this cake exactly as stated except in a round pan, so I had too increase the time. Hour of baking produced a cake that tested done but was very wet and oily. Put it back in and it dried out some but still oily and had a rawish smell and taste. I guess I was right about the preparation method - nothing beats creaming butter and sugar first!

I love this plain or with hot bittersweet chocolate sauce. I used a 9x13 and added 2 tsps of baking powder. Toothpick out clean in only 30 mins @350.

I love this cake. It turns out very dense and moist. I use round pans and between the layers I put a glaze that soaks in, then I cover it with traditional butter cream.

Very good and very easy.  I used half almond extract and half vanilla when almond was called for because it's not an ingredient I've used much and I wasn't sure how the family would like it.  They like it!  Next time I'll try it without vanilla.

I was skeptical regarding this batter since it was much more runny than I am used to but this was fantastic.  I didn't use the frosting posted.  I used the cake as the white part of a checkerboard cake and I don't think that I have ever received so many RAVING compliments on a cake.  I used a dark chocolate box cake for the dark part of the cake and had a lot of trouble cutting it and setting it so I am positive that this cake is what sent it over the top for everyone.  It was incredibly moist.

This is one of the most addicting cakes I have ever eaten.  I tried it for a large party and also make a chocolate one.  I had alot of leftovers from the party and thinking I should'nt keep alot of the sweets, I sent most of it home with my guests.  Once I tasted this, it has been on my mind like an addiction.  I can't wait to make another!

Loved the fact that I only had to dirty one pot to make it. Only thing changed was the almond extract to vanilla. Yummy and a new favourite.

This was just ok in my opinion. The cake was verydense and sweet. The almond flavor was overpowering. If I made it again, I would reduce the almond extract and maybe add an equal amount of vanilla extract

I've tried many white cake recipes and this one makes a perfectly moist cake that is sturdy enough to frost. I added anise for a twist on the flavor.

I made this in a 9X13 pan.  The frosting/cake is VERY sweet!!!!  I want to make it again in the suggested cake size, and only make 1/2 the frosting to make it more of a "glaze".  The pecans and almond extract together are amazing!!!!!!!!

This cake was excellent! The BEST white cake I have ever made. I had a request for a white birthday cake. I'm so glad I found this one! It was a hit. The only thing I did differently was I made chocolate buttercream icing for it.

This is my middle daughter's favorite kind of cake.  Today was her lucky day.  I did not put the nuts in the frosting due to personal preference.  Ate this with fresh raspberries and it was just wonderful.  I just love the almond extract flavor.  I don't make this very often because of the sugar and butter, but when I do, we sure do enjoy it.

This was delicious.  I love the taste of almond extract, so this was amazing.  I will make this cake, along with the chocolate Texas sheet cake for my husband's family reunion.  I am expecting about 50 - 75 people.

Looked a little oily to me, but then again, I cut it when it was still warm.  I've heard that this is a good one once it has set for 24 hours.  I'll try it again today.  Also, my frost was really thick, but I just added a couple of tablespoons of milk to make it more spreadable.   All in all, the flavor was really good.  I can't wait to have another piece today.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used cream cheese frosting and vanilla.  It was hit!!  I made it in a cookie sheet and baked it for 18 minutes.  Perfect!

Very Good Cake! Extremely Moist! The only problem was that it was too sweet, so the next time i'll cut back on the sugar, but i will be making this again, very soon.

We loved this cake!  I took the advice of others and cut down on the sugar.  I ground up the nuts for the icing only because that's how we like them.  I've made this recipe several times and it's been a hit each time!

Most of my family liked the cake, but I wasn't too fond of it.  I'm guessing it was the almond flavor.  If I make this recipe again, I will use vanilla extract instead.

Loved this! Great flavor....and best of all no chocolate or peanutbutter to give me a migraine. Thought my kids might balk at it not being chocolate but they really liked it.

Excellent!  As with the Chocolate Texas Sheet cake, the icing completes the cake.  Your experience is not complete unless you try it with the icing...and a glass of milk.

The cake was 95% good- but this one little section fell! Don't ask me why/how, cause I have no idea what happened. I followed the directions exactly and I do bake all the time... so it's a mystery to me. Maybe I'll take the direction of another review and change the way I mix it together. Otherwise it was fabulous! Husband and kids have been inhaling it. I only used 1/4 t almond extract, using vanilla for the remainder, as I only like a 'hint' of almond. SO good. (I mean, minus the pit!)

This was just great.  I made cream cheese frosting and put toasted coconut and almonds on the top - fabulous!  I made it for a golf club luncheon and everyone raved.  It was so good that they've asked me to do it for our member-guest!

I made this cake last night and it is absolutely delicious. My husband said it’s definitely one of my best cakes. I made no changes except I used vanilla extract instead of almond. I will definitely make this again. Thank you Diane for sharing!

I have made this cake twice in the last week.  When I first saw the recipe, I knew I had to try it.   It is absolutely delicious.  I was a little worried when I saw how thin the layer was, but the cake is so moist and delicious it doesn't matter.  The icing is just enough but I did make a change based upon reviews I read.  I put 1/2 cup less sugar in the icing.  I also did not put nuts in the icing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!   Many ladies from the the church potluck I took it to will be looking this up online soon I'm sure.   Some reviewers complain it is yellow in color which I believe can be attributed to dark egg yolks or a dark yellow butter (I used margarine for the cake and butter for the frosting).  I agree it is sweet and flat, but it's supposed to be that way.  It's not meant to be like a big chunk of birthday cake - it's meant to be served more like a square.   I used an 11x17 pan which I cut into 40 pieces and most people still cut those in half.  This also freezes like a dream!

I’ve made it twice this Christmas season because it was so popular. I didn’t use the almond extract because several members of my family prefer just vanilla. Also, the kids all preferred that there was no nuts. Other than those two things I made as written. The cake and frosting have a really nice flavor and texture. It’s also really easy to make.

I absolutely love this version of Texas Sheet cake! For many years my mom, then myself included made the chocolate version of Texas sheet cake.
I happened to find the white cake version on Allrecipes to my delight! I took it to a friend's house for a pre-Christmas gathering and got rave reviews. The only substituttutions I made was reducing the 2 cups of sugar,with 1 1/2 cups,and using 1 stick of butter, and half cup of coconut oil,because I was low on butter.I also used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla along with 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  I used the frosting in the recipe which held up nicely for travel and I didn't find it wet or grainy at all,as posted by a reviewer  who obviously doesn't like sheet cakes.I did follow one reviewer advice and used 3 and 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar,as other reviewers stated the cake was too sugary sweet.I also used slivered almonds instead of walnuts because I used more almond extract,and toasted the almonds in a skillet,then added them on top of the cake after frosting it,instead of mixing the nuts in the frosting.Very pretty effect if you decide to put any nuts on top when frosted. Alot of variations of flavored extracts and nuts can be used in this cake that I believe will be will received by sweettooths at your next potluck. I am going to try this cake with a cream cheese frosting and post an update real soon.

I made this for 100 people recently. I one and one half timed the recipe for one full sheet cake pan so 1 1/2 cups butter, 1 1/2 cups water, 3 cups flour, etc. (The pan measures 17 1/2 x 12 3/4) I received many positive comments and requests for the recipe.

Favorite last minute dessert- you don't even have to wait for the cake to cool to frost it! I like to toast my pecans before adding them to the frosting for extra flavor.

I made this for a potluck picnic. There were other cakes there as well. We left early without the cake and pan so I'm not sure how many people ate it. I thought it was fantastic!!  I served it chilled because it was a hot day. The almond flavoring in the icing made it taste amazing. I used the pecans  which made it more yummy. My brother in law raved about this cake and told me later that  "the reason I didn't return the pan is because I'm still eating  your cake!"

I've made this several times.   It's great.   I've used cream cheese frosting, buttercream, and also the one included in the recipe.   All good.
I do increase this recipe by 50% (change the "servings" from 24 to 36 for easy calculating)    I find that this fits my cookie sheet pan perfectly.  My pan is approx 12X17 inches    
Enjoy!

This was nothing like a Texas sheet cake (a review from a native Texan). I've only eaten the chocolate ones and was intrigued by a white version. Yes I know it isn't suppose to be a big fluffy cake, but this was wrong. so wrong. Firstly, it was way too dense even for a sheet cake. My whole family took one bite and said it tasted like sweet cornbread.  I thought, no way and then took a bite. yep cornbread flavor- odd.

I've yet to make it as an actual sheet cake, but I've used it as a base for petit fours (blackberry jam between the layers and clover the whole things in white chocolate) and I've made mini muffins out of it and both have been PHENOMENAL. (Though I had to wait a day for the muffins to not stick to the wrappers.) Yeah, it's sweet, but that's why I love it for little servings. The subtle almond flavor really puts it over the top. Plus all you need to mix it is a couple of saucepans? The easy cleanup is so nice.

I just couldn't bring myself to put 4 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the icing.  I started making the icing with the proper amount measured out and just sampled it as I added the sugar. I wound up with about 2 1/2 cups in it and it was plenty sweet. Overall a great cake for me with that amount of sweetener.

This cake is absolutely awesome!!  I have never served it where at least one (usually all) of the guests have asked for the recipe.  It's my go-to for just about any kind of get together.  Many of my friends love it with their coffee in the morning.  And it makes a lot, which is perfect!

This cake was delicious. I had to use walnuts because I did not have pecans in my cupboard. I changed the recipe when it came to making the frosting , one suggested used 3 cup of confection sugar, and use 1/3 cup of butter.

This is a super good cake.  Very easy to make. I used a 10x15” pan as advised. I put in much less sugar, a cup less in both cake amd frosting. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. Will definitely make it again using even less sugar.

Followed recipe exactly but was unimpressed. It was too sweet for my taste and the cake didn’t have much flavor. I cook quite a but and love to bake to share w others. Will go back to the chocolate version.

I made this cake and it was a big hit in my family. The cake reminded me a little of the Sponge cake my Mom made for us as kids. It was my brotheer’s favorite cake. I saved some for him and ca’t was for him to try it!

My son absolutely loved this one.  I thought the icing was a little thick, and I used maple flavoring instead of almond.  I thought it went with the pecans better.

I used this recipe in place of a pound cake recipe to make petit fours. They were delicious. They could not have been more moist, and the perfect vessel for sweet fillings and poured fondant icing.  Its not bland at all. Its just made to make the fillings and frostings be the highlight.

My family loves this sweet moist cake. It is flat as others have indicated but delicious.  I have made it with several modifications like adding maple flavoring to the pecan frosting which is great for fall.  Serving it this weekend without the nuts and a side of berries for a summer bbq.

I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I ran into was not having enough frosting to cover the entire cake. Maybe my consistency of the frosting was off? I just made another half batch of frosting and that took care of the problem. Otherwise a delicious cake!

I am not a baker, but this is the easiest dessert I've ever made and it's always a hit.  We have an annual gathering where I've been told, "You HAVE to bring it EVERY year!"  There are never any leftovers.  I've even made it, cut it into squares, and frozen them for a later time!

I don't know if I will make it again. The first day they were great, but the day next they were too moist, they were like 'sweating'. They are good and pretty, It was my fault I always put in too much flour or not enough.

Made the icing as directed, even after reading all the reviews. Was too sweet.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the cake.  It was super moist and still sweet.   Not sure if I’ll make it again.  IF I do...I might use a different icing. 
Thanks for the recipe!!!  I love love allrecipes.com!!!

This is super easy and very tasty!!! I did one and a half batch which made it a bit thicker.  For icing I used whip cream and put fresh cut  strawberries on top.  It was a hit ... not a crumb left over

I live above 6000 feet so I added Tbls. flour. I did use a regular cake pan on accident so I baked it for five more minutes and turned off the oven and let it sit between 5-10 more min. WOW!! It was perfect and we just topped it off with whipped cream, homemade, and the reaction was unanimous all around. Perfect texture and med sweetness that was not overbearing. .i also put yogurt on top and then made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Delicious. NEXT time vanilla extract and a flat sheet!

This Cake was fantastic, a big hit with the other half also. Made it straight by the book,  Cake & Frosting. It turned out, moist & decadent. Great made from scratch recipe & would make a great Church or Work pot luck  dish. Definitely  a keeper, will be making again.

I have been looking forward to making this cake for months! Made it yesterday and followed the instructions to the letter. 

My husband had the first piece and when he took a bite he had the strangest look on his face. He said “It’s ...moist.” 

I grabbed a piece and OMG! It tastes like a chunk of frosted butter! I seriously ran to clean the residue out of my mouth. 

It made a pretty cake. Maybe only one stick of butter? I dunno and don’t care now. Ack.

Mine came out perfect. I've made this before and knew it wasn't going to rise much. Its called a SHEET CAKE. Also cook it for a couple extra minutes. It's not very wet. Everyone loves it here!  Oh and you can clearly see the cake is yellow in color in the video. However mine still comes out pretty light.

Perfect vanilla version of the chocolate style sheet cake.  Very moist and a perfect vehicle for icing as another reviewer mentioned.

This was great! So fast and easy!  Next time i will mix the wet ingredients well before i add to the ‘hot pot’ just to make it easier to get smooth. Cooked in about 15 minutes. I frosted it hot, no problems there. Will definitely make again. I prefer almond extract to vanilla so this was a hit for me. Thanks for posting!

I made this for my husband’s birthday. I wasn’t sure how he felt about almond extract so I used vanilla instead. Other than that I followed the recipe completely. It was DELICIOUS and even better the second day. I highly recommend.

After the incredible success I had with the chocolate Texas sheet cake on this site, I decided to try the white cake.  Nothing complicated, nor are there exotic ingredients.  I used vanilla instead of almond, but otherwise just followed the instructions.  I love how easily this goes together, even if it is contrary to all other cakes.  I will change the frosting a bit to a cinnamon frosting because I love it, and will try this next time with added spices to make a spice cake.  Maybe use apple juice instead of water.  I love recipes where I can count on the base recipe to be good and then make changes as needed.  Hmmmm.  Lemon or even orange.  Can't wait.

This cake is YUMMY!  I've made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe.  No changes are necessary.  Everyone loved it!  The second time, I added lemon extract to the batter, then frosted it with a lemony cream cheese frosting.  It was a hit.  So easy to make.  This will definitely be my go to recipe!

i felt it was a little too much butter. I would have use 1/2 cup butter as I do in my other Texas sheet cake recipes.  It was a little too intense the way it was.

I am a professional baker & use both the vanilla & chocolate sheet cake recipes regularly. They are very versatile, I've cooked them in everything from a bundt pan to cupcakes. BUT I NEVER use water. I always substitute coffee or some type of fruit juice. Today I made cupcakes using this recipe but used pineapple juice instead of the water. They turned out beautifully & were the perfect base to a twist on the pineapple upside down cake. I sold out imeediately & they had rave reviews. The cake is moist & stays that way. You do need to use more batter for the cupcakes than you would with most recipes. I fill mine 3/4 of the way & they come out the perfect size.

It is VERY tasty as it is.  I also made this recipe for cupcakes (but to make it rise so it has a "muffin top", I added 2 teaspoons of vinegar (you can't taste it), an extra egg and a teaspoon of baking powder.  I played with the extract for different flavors too; swapped out the almond for vanilla, and also tried banana extract with a chunk of banana in the cupcakes.  Delicious!!!

I love this cake. A friend made it and was awesome. I used grassfed dairy gold butter in mine and it was so wet and greasy. Not the same as my friends. Not sure why. Think I'll cut back on butter next time.

This was a good basic cake however every cake that i make i always add cinnamon molasses and vanilla no matter what the recipe says. It provides that depth of flavor especially the molasses. Its nutrient dense and it always provides that satisfaction depth of flavor that lacks in some cakes and many other foods.

Made this cake and decorated it for cinco de mayo. It was so good! I used chopped maraschino cherries on top instead of nuts. I also chose to go with the cream cheese frosting. Really great bake.

I made this with the following changes:  
I used non-fat plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, because I did not have any sour cream.  
I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract in the icing because I did not have enough almond extract (I used it all in the cake).  
I baked in a 12 x 17 3/4 sheet cake pan instead of 10 x 15.  This made a very thin cake, as I expect a sheet cake to be. 
I sifted the confectioner's sugar for the icing out of habit, and I wouldn't trust it to not be lumpy without doing so.

This cake came together quickly, and it was delicious!  Hard to go wrong with 3/4 pound of butter, I guess.  It was sweet and rich.  I would probably use more extracts if I made it again, but it wasn't bland at all.

Delicious! For those of you complaining that this is a flat cake.  It is supposed to be.  I guess the title of the recipe is a little deceiving.  It is supposed to be considered more of a bar that is for snacking, like a brownie.  This is not a cake for decorating or what you would think of as a "birthday cake".

I altered it a LOT 

I added about 3 TBS True Orange orange/ginger and about 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger to the cake 

Used 1/3 C milk and added 2/3 C cocoa powder and 2 TBS True Orange orange/ginger for the frosting 

cake is SUPER moist and firm not at all crumbly  - next time I will want to sift the flour into the pot to help conquer lumping

This was such a hit with my family.  Everyone loved it.  The only change I made was to omit the pecans and add sprinkles. I love the pecans, but many of the children do not.  Love it!

This cake was overall amazing! If you don't like almonds or don't have almond extract I suggest using vanilla extract. It tastes really great!

The cake turned out more spongy in texture. The flavor isn't bad just not the texture I was expecting. I made my own butter cream frosting which always turns out and I used vanilla instead of almond. I thought the cake had enough almond flavor. with the frosting the cake was ok enough . I don't think I will be making this again.

I made this and it was amazing! It honestly tasted like a sugar cookie, which, in my experience, has been the case for almost every homemade white cake. The only thing is, in my oven I had to turn the pan halfway and one sheet cake didn't cook all the way but I think it was because I
 didn't put it in right away, and then I put fresh batter on top, which was the part that didn't cook fully. I was able to fix it though and it is not so uncooked as to make a person sick so that was good. I made two sheet cakes in a  17x12 (roughly) pan and i had to make the recipe 1 and a half times. So ,i used 3 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, and so on. Counting all the bumps along the way I still give this cake 5 stars. It did not turn out watery at all for me and the only issue was it not cooking  all the way which was my fault. I am going to top it off with custard filling and lemon buttercream! i can't wait:)

My family and I love this cake! The cake itself came out very moist while the frosting is rich and delicious. I added a few minor changes; I put a tsp. of vanilla along with the almond extract to the cake, as well as walnuts instead of pecans in the frosting. My only suggestion would be to make the frosting  right before the cake is to be frosted. Mine turned into a ball as it cooled making it difficult to frost the cake.

I love choc texas sheet cake, but at our camp surprisingly there are more white cake lovers so I gave this a try. I put sliced almonds on all of it and on half I put coconut and mini choc chips. I gotta say the coconut and chips side was gone first. I made this cake fri for camp and sunday there was only 1 piece left. YUMMY... Def not for those on diets but eat it in moderation lol

Yum, yum, yum. I only made a few minor changes: one, I was low on butter, so used 1/2 butter + 1/2 vegetable  oil for the cake. I doubled the almond extract because we love almond. I don't have the exact right sized pan, so used a baking sheet that's about an inch larger in both directions. I baked the cake for about 20 minutes, but checked every few after 13 minutes. Finally, we didn't put nuts in the frosting because we didn't want nuts. It is delicious. We'll certainly make this again and again.

For the amount of time (very little) and the amount of effort (minimal) this is an amazing cake recipe.  One pot, one pan, one whisk, and one spreader, whisk bam boom and you're done!  I toasted my walnuts, used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract in the cake, used all vanilla in the frosting and accidentally used 5 oz of evaporated milk (not the sweet kind) in the frosting and it still was awesome.  I hate to bake but love to cook, so this was right up my alley!

7/2016 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7820/white-texas-sheet-cake/ ...  This is the same recipe as this  ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/125130/white-texas-sheet-cake/ ... except this one, the one on this page, uses 1/2t salt where as the other uses 1t.  I was having a fit wondering why my review didn't show up, thinking I'd made this one & the photo just changed.  Anywayyyy, gooood cake.  I've made it as is & subbing half vanilla for the almond in the cake & the icing.  Good either way.  Tried it since some are sensitive to almond extract.  Not me.  ;D 'Also have reduced butter/margarine to 3/4c & sugar to 1 3/4c.  Oh, you're going to make a face with this one - 3 1/2c confec in the icing leaves a smooth finish & not too sweet.  Heyyy, I did make it as is a few times & it's very good with or without changes.  Since it's  the same recipe except the salt, I'm gong to repost that same review.  Oh, we don't do the nuts.  Here y'are: 
"9/4/2015
Very good, I reduced butter by 2T in the cake. 'Could've gone lower as suggested by a reviewer - reducing by 1/4c. I decreased the sugar to 1 3/4c. Really like the idea of pouroverwhilewarm frosting. Very fast & easy to make so a great choice for in-a-pinch. 'On the plainlooking side though so nuts or something else would help that. Tastewise, I don't think it needs anything. It's a large, but thin cake; lasted a while now. 'Still as good as day one. :) I figured out what it reminds me of: Sour Cream Donuts!"  Btw, to make chocolate, s

I  replaced the almond extract with vanilla because I don't like the flavor of almond, but this cake was super good! I made it for my son's birthday and everyone loved it. I made 2 of them and put a filling in between the layers. It was perfectly moist with a nice golden color after baking.  I will definitely make this cake again.

If you love white wedding cake, you will love this recipe. So easy and delicious! I put walnuts on half the iced cake instead of putting it in frosting so ones that didn't like nuts could enjoy the cake. I took it to a Memorial Day party and got rave reviews and people wanting recipe. This recipe is a crowd pleasing hit!!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and beat my eggs and sour cream first.  Then tempered in the butter/water mixture.  After that, I alternated the liquid and dry ingredients, adding the almond extract at the end.
Made a cream cheese frosting with pecans.

Made this and a chocolate cake for my poppa's 80th party. I read reviews and became worried. Until it was finished baking, It turned out great! I used a 9x13 pan and cooked it until done(didn't take much longer than the original time),  testing with a toothpick coming out clean. I also used only 4 cups of sugar in the icing. Tasted like a white almond cake but not over powering. Very moist. Definitely will make this again.

Great cake! I used toasted, sliced almonds instead of walnuts and vanilla instead of almond extract, and it worked perfectly. Thank you!

Made it exactly as the recipe, except vanilla extract instead of almond (i didn't have any almond extract) and used cream cheese frosting. Tasted lovely, family enjoyed it, I will definately make it again.

It's a white sheet cake, it's supposed to be flat, people. ?? the reviews crack me up. So this is a great cake the first day you make it, but if you put saran wrap over it and serve it the next day your friends and family may throw a parade in your honor. By far my most requested recipe. Very moist. I call it a wedding sheet cake due to the almond flavor. If you cut in half you can add a layer of raspberry or aprocot preserves, and stack it then put a thicker version of the glaze in the top. Super versatile and yummy.

I followed the directions exactly except I forgot to put the vanilla in the cake batter so I put it in the frosting. Everyone loved it! I will be making this again and I'll even try to remember to put the flavoring in the cake next time!

Made this cake last night and followed the directions exactly.  I make the chocolate version of this cake successfully on a regular basis.  This cake came out gummy - almost doughy - after testing done.  I  am not sure what happened.  I will be trying it again and hoping for better results.

Will definitely add to my recipe box.  This is a quick and easy sheet cake for large gatherings. Decreased sugar in cake from 2 to 1-1/2 cups and added crushed pineapple.  Great taste.  Made a cream cheese frosting; 1 pkg cream cheese, 4 cups powered sugar, 1 tbsp. butter and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Added some pineapple juice to the frosting. I spread on the warm cake.  I used all of the frosting and pretty sweet (too much frosting). Next time I will use a very thin layer of frosting on the cake.  I also think this would be good without any frosting.  Will make again and experiment with different options.

I took this cake to a potluck at our lodge and it was a big hit. I've made the Texas Chocolate Sheet Cake and love it, but never knew there was a white version. It is a very sweet cake, and that's how it's supposed to be. I will definitely keep this recipe.

I thought it wasn't very good right after I made it, but it's amazing the next day. It's very easy to make. I used vanilla instead of almond. I also used a chocolate, sour cream and butter frosting instead of the one here. Anyways, super delicious - moist, just melts in your mouth!

I made this recipe (despite the bad reviews), but found that I was out of a few things, so I made some minor substitutions. I didn't have sour cream, so I used buttermilk. I didnt have all purpose flour, so I used self rising, and left out the salt and baking soda. I also didnt have milk for the icing, so I used half heavy cream/half water. I also did not use the nuts, and chose to add a dash of vanilla to both the cake and icing. I only used these substitutions out of necessity, and other than using self rising flour, I don't think they changed the cake. Granted, you need to cut these slices a little smaller than usual (due to sweetness), but it was an outstanding cake. Lighter and fluffier than any boxed cake trash, and the fact this all gets prepped in a single skillet is amazing. No creaming and no mixing, means this is super fast. Embarrassingly, two of us ate the cake in only 3 days!

This was very good.  We all love Texas Sheet Cake, but my husband can no longer eat chocolate.  He loved this!  I still prefer the chocolate version, but I will make this again for my hubby! I followed the recipe except I used vanilla extract in place of the almond extract (didn't have any).  This is a very good white version of Texas Sheet Cake!

I made this yesterday for a July 4 party, because there was going to be a crowd there.  Everyone loved it, and I loved that it was so easy to make.  I took some other reviewers' suggestions and cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, used buttermilk instead of 1/2 c. of the water and used my own white frosting because I always have some in the freezer. Topped it with fresh red and blue berries and sprinkled on some red and blue sugar. Everyone agreed it was better this way, and the cake tasted more like a scratch cake.  I've been wanting to make a white Texas Sheet Cake for a while now, and I loved this one, I will definitely be making it again and again!

I never knew there was a White Texas Sheet Cake recipe around and I am so glad I found it. This cake is soooo good, moist and tender and I do like the almond flavoring that is used; I bet vanilla would be just as good. Love the ease in prep too. I used my own buttercream frosting recipe and then topped it with fresh strawberries when it was served - it was great! Many complements. Thanks Diane!

Made this the other day on the advice of friend, we omitted the water and used buttermilk instead.  Wow, it was great.  I accidentally used to much almond extract in the frosting. recommend measuring and not dumping.  anxious to find the chocolate version.

The easiest recipe I have ever made for a cake.  The flavor reminded me of a light sugar cookie flavor cornbread if that makes senses.  It was dense and not fluffy.  I LOVE sweet sweet stuff but, the icing was too sugary sweet and thin so I just made a standard chocolate buttercream.  After cooked, I divided the cake and layered it into a four tier cake.  It was very good and like everyone else said, it was so much better the next day. The only change I made was to use vanilla instead of almond extract.  I also added two tablespoons of seltzer water, I do this for every cake recipe that I make.  I will make this again and again.

I tried this recipe out on my family first before bringing to a church potluck; it was moist, sweet, delicious, and yes, it's supposed to be flat. The icing was sweet but again, it's a sheetcake so it's supposed to  be sweet. This is an excellent recipe, soooo easy and quick you could almost have the whole thing done in 40 minutes.

Very happy with this cake.  Devoured by co-workers and they are a critical bunch!  Took suggestions from several other reviewers and made the following  changes...  Used the 10 X 15 pan as called for / used 1/2 tsp of almond and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract / frosting - used only 3 cups of powdered sugar / 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cream cheese / and lastly, used maple extract instead of vanilla.    The taste almost reminded me of a pecan pancake with maple syrup!  The texture was good, dense but very moist.  Actually rose more than my Texas sheet cakes ever did - I might added a tad more baking soda than called for.   Because of that, I adjusted the icing so it would not just all spill out over the side.  The cream cheese and less sugar helped it set a little faster and I also made sideboards from tin foil to help hold it in at the edges.   I will be making it again many times as will my co- workers.   I also agree with other reviewers that this cake is a good pairing with the traditional Texas Sheet Cake

Took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit!  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups in the cake and 4 cups of  confectioners' sugar after reading the reviews.  The almond extract is the key here it is delicious so I added 1/2 tsp more.  I will make this again for sure.

This is awesome!! My goal this summer (and last summer actually) have been to find a good yellow or white cake recipe. I have tried many different yellow and white cakes that had high reviews on this site and so far none have been what I am looking for. They all end up shrinking, and while some of them had good flavor, they were also very dense. Then I decided to try this for a flag cake I wanted to make for the fourth of July. I used vanilla extract instead of almond, and I didn't use the icing recipe as I was making a flag design with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries. It was moist and had a very nice flavor. I am going to experiment with different icings and pan sizes, as I would like to make round cakes with this recipe. I will let you know how that goes! I'll put a picture of the flag cake I made with this. It was wonderful! Thank you so much!

Great cake! So easy to prepare and I always receive compliments.  I do add a bit more milk to the icing so it spreads easier.

Great recipe.  My only change is instead of sour cream, I use vanilla yogurt. I also will sometimes use a different frosting to change things up a bit.

I baked this for a potluck dinner.  I thought it was fantastically fast and easy to prepare.  Trust them when they tell you to put the frosting on warm!  It gets unmanageable fast.  I got lots of compliments.  The only reason I gave it a 4-star rating is that I personally thought it was pretty sweet.  I might use a butter cream frosting on it...with the awareness that it would take away from the quick preparation time.  All-in-all, however, I thought it was pretty good.

This is absolutely delicious! It was in the fridge for a few days and kept getting even better. I baked it in a 9X13 pan and it was the perfect height and sweetness.It looked beautiful. I used vanilla instead of almond extract because it was for kids but I can't wait to try it with almond!

Super-strong almond taste!  It's good but I think I will add a little less almond to the recipe and I can see why it might be better with a cream cheese frosting.

Almond heaven!  After reading reviews, I reduced the white sugar to 1 1/2c and made more of a glaze using the same frosting ingredients just less of them (only 1c confectioner's sugar).  The cake is fantastic & plenty sweet!  I can't imagine if I had used all the sugar the recipe called for.

This was good but didn't get very high in the pan they suggest. Also I would cut down on the almond flavoring next time. They were good but I have had better.

Very happy!  This was my first real homemade cake! It didn't drop and was nice and moist!  Yay!  lol  I even made a mistake in the cake batter!  I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the 1 cup of butter that was called for! ( Got distracted!)  lol  The frosting was just a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll cut back on the confectioners' sugar to about 3 1/2 cups instead of 4 1/2 cups and I'll use vanilla extract in the batter and frosting.   Thank you Diane!  This is a keeper!

Wow! Incredibly sweet! My husband said that it put him in a diabetic coma!! It was good but I will make it in a regular cake pan next time and not as a thin sheet cake since it was just so sweet. I'm wondering if that may cut some of the intense sweetness since the icing wouldn't be as thick.

I thought this was an excellent cake and prepared it as per the recipe.  I kept the icing on the stovetop on warm until I put it on the cake.  It spread fairly easily.  I would make it again.  We have a family dinner in a couple of weeks... I think I will make this cake and the Chocolate version and take both.

I just made the cake (subbing vanilla for almond extract). I'm not in love with the texture of the cake; it's a little oily and flat to me--It seems flatter than the regular chocolate version of a Texas Sheet Cake. I'm wondering if I should add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour to make up for the lack of cocoa powder (a dry ingredient that might help with the texture). 

One fun idea...I made 1/2 the frosting as per this recipe, and the other 1/2 as per the chocolate version of this recipe. I frosted half the cake with each frosting (started frosting the length of the cake to the middle--so you have more area of the cake that you can cut with both kinds of frosting on the pieces). It turned out kind of like a "New York Black and White Cookie." My daughter and her friends liked the cake; my husband also liked it.

I thought the cake part of the recipe was very good and moist - however the frosting turned out very lumpy and hard to spread - I had to pretty much flatten it onto the cake and take dip my knife into cold milk to attempt to make it appear smoother - not sure what happened because I followed the recipe to a T - however I did double the recipe so maybe that was why?

This is a great recipe, especially for a crowd as it makes a lot. It is very moist and stays moist for several days so it is really good to make ahead for a party or potluck. I made it for a family reunion and it was very well received.

Delicious! Used just a slightly larger pan which gave a thinner layer of icing!  Very rich and buttery.  This recipe is already in my recipe box for the future.

This cake was VERY moist and quite tasty.  I will probablly try to make the icing substituting vanilla for the almond extract or switch them in the cake.  It was a bit more almond than my family likes.  But, WOW, I am from Texas and love this alternative to the normal Chocolate Sheet cake.  Thanks!

Sooooo good. I've been looking forever for a recipe like this! If you love almond extract this is for you.  The cake is so tender and moist, and the icing is a perfect compliment.  A very small slice is enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.

Just made the cake this afternoon and it came out well.  I agree that the chocolate one is a little better which is why I'm giving this 4 stars, but this definitely has a good flavor.  My family doesn't like almond, so I used vanilla extract.   Not sure what happened to the people who had problems with the cake rising.  Mine did just fine.  It tose about the same amount as the chocolate one.

I liked the taste fairly well but the cake was definitely a "sheet"cake.  It raised only slightly.  It is more like a sponge cake.  I feel it would have been helpful if there were more specific details in adding the ingredients.  Perhaps it would have turned out better.
