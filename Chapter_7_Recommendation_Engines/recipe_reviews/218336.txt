This dressing is a nice alternative to the raspberry vinaigrettes I have had in the past.  Tastes extremely fresh, slightly sweet and orangy with a little kick from the Cayenne pepper.  It was a perfect topping for the salad greens I served with a Chicken Cordon Bleu dish and balsamic glazed asparagus.  My husband asked to have this dressing on a regular basis... quite a compliment!  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty nice dressing. Not too sweet, but sweet enough, for me anyway. Works really well with fruit (ie. blueberries, strawberries) in your salad. This will be a keeper for me.

Very light and tasty - this dressing is ideal for a summer salad. It's a little on the thin side, but there is no "thickener" in this recipe, so that's to be expected and actually allows you to use less of it.

Nice dressing! Fruity, not too sweet, good with the pepper ... I think I will reduce a cup of orange juice first next time, to give it a little more orange juice taste. Will keep this recipe!

It's a slightly runny dressing, but the flavor is amazing. It was absolutely perfect for my citrus marinated chicken and greens salad. Has just enough sweetness with just enough kick. I did not have white-wine vinegar, so I used red-wine vinegar instead, but it turned out beautifully anyway. Just don't use full white vinegar--too much tang that way. Really excellent and pretty simple recipe. I used organic honey, with no ingredients other than 'honey' in it. I highly recommend it for a slightly sweet dressing for any bitter greens or chicken salads.

AMAZING!  I followed the recipe almost exact.  I did not use the grated orange peel. I put it on our spinach,feta,sunflower seed, and mandarine orange salad and my picky spinach "hater" couldn't get enough of the salad!  And it was so easy!!  Thanks for posting!

I really liked it.  The DH said he couldn't really taste it but I served it over organic spinach which was pretty strong flavored.  I did forget the orange zest and I did find the dressing to be a little too runny.  I figured since I was trying something new on the guys it had better look closer to store bought so I got out my smallest saucepan and reduced the dressing.  Differently will be using this recipe again!

Delicious! Light, fresh, sweet and sour.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I only let it sit for a little over and hour and it was still great.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow after it sits overnight. Thank-you for a great dressing that I can add to my repertoire!

It needed a bit more flavor so I used a bit of orange oil and some additional spices.

A fabulous dressing for any summer salad, especially one with fruit!  It's the perfect blend of sweet & tangy. I made it for a spinach salad with berries, mandarin oranges & pecans. I left out the cayenne pepper and used powdered ginger instead. I used pear infused white balsamic vinegar. It got rave reviews. Fresh vinaigrette is always the best - I'll definitely make it again!

Instead of parsley I used celery leaves. And I used regular vinegar. I tasted it once it was done and it was great! I think the flavors will only intensify as it sits in the fridge waiting for dinner tonight.

I used frozen concentrate and added a bit of water. 

I had to add balsamic vinegar because it was bland!  Didn't put parsley in, it made the dressing ugly.  I just got some WHITE balsamic which I will use next time.  Decent base though.

I loved this dressing! Full of fresh, mildly sweet taste, just the right amount of everything. Yes, it is thin, but why is that a problem? I prefer thinner dressings, they combine with greens better. I didn't have 4 hours for it to sit, used it right after I made it, and it was very delicious. Definitely going to be a staple dressing in our house.

Great dressing for orange lovers. It is runny like others mentioned but I didn't mind. Served it on romaine with mandarin wedges, walnuts and cranraisins. I totally forgot to use the orange peel. I don't think it was missed. Parsley was a nice touch, added to the 'fresh' taste. thx LaurasFaves.

We made this to go with a spinach/apple salad at our high school. It was a huge hit!!!
