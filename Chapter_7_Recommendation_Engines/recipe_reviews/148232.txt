The Whole family enjoyed this meal. I made a few changes. I would recommend first stir frying the shrimp and set aside. do not marinate the shrimp because mine got mushy. I pretty much used the same recipe but I didnt have chili paste so i substituted 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. I added some shrooms. I stirfried veggies, then added cooked shrimp and the sauce mixture. For the sauce mixture I reduced garlic to 2 teaspoons because I thought it would be too much. I recommend reducing the ginger to 1 teaspoon because it was too gingering and made my mouth tingle. So I basically used the same recipe except reduced the garlic and ginger and substituted red pepper flakes for the chili paste. Very flavorful and will make it again.

Loved this! I made a couple changes. First, I only had raw shrimp, so instead of marinating I just sauteed the veggies first and set aside, then sauteed the shrimp with the sauce until almost cooked through and added veggies back in. Also, I just had brown rice so cooked that per usual. Great recipe- will definitely make again!

We loved this.  The flavors are bold, spicy and sweet.  My husband said this was the best asian dinner I have ever made...and believe me, I have made many asian recipes off of this site.  Finally, the flavors we were looking for.

Wonderful!  We cut back on the ginger and I have no idea what chili paste is so we just used about a teaspoon of red pepper flake for some heat.  Even my 4 year olds gobbled it up!

I let the shrimp marinade overnight which I'm not sure if that made a huge difference but I thought it turned out very well. Delicious!

I made this exactly except that I used a package of stoplight peppers because my store didn't have orange peppers sold seperately.  I also doubled the recipe and the shrimp. I loved the flavor. My only complaints are I think I would have liked more of a variety of vegetables, mushrooms and brocolli might have been nice. I also think I would have liked the peppers julienned instead of diced. I don't know if it is because I doubled the recipe I ended up with a lot of sauce. I would have liked the sauce a little thicker. All and all, not to bad.

Excellent! Easy to double or adjust to individual preferences. I couldn't get it out of the wok and to the table quick enough.

This was very good!  My whole family, including 3 little ones, enjoyed it!  The only change I made was  using raw shrimp instead of cooked.  As written, the recipe did make a lot of extra sauce, but I just used a slotted spoon to add the shrimp to the wok instead of pouring all the sauce  in too (and I'm glad I did this).  Next time I would reduce the amount of sugar snap peas (just personal preference) and maybe add some different veggies, like mushrooms and broccoli.  It's a great versatile recipe, and I will definitely be making this again!

I am new to cooking but was able to manage this one! We try to keep the carbs down so I used fried cabbage instead of rice but it came out great. I doubled the batch but my wok was plenty big enough. My wife was surprised at the complexity of flavors in the dish as a lot of stir fry just tastes like soy sauce. If I could do anything different I would have minced the ginger better as the pieces were a little big, but that's on me.

Excellent!  I made as stated except that i had a 12oz bag of shrimp.  I also read that if you marinate the shrimp for an hour it gets soggy so instead I marinated while I was getting everything else ready so around 20-30 minutes.  This would be good with other veggies in it too!

Delicious! Made a few changes based on personal preference / time considerations / ingredients on hand. I used 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes instead of the chili paste and apricot marmalade instead of orange. Did not marinate the shrimp. Sauteed the shrimp in the oil first for about 3 mintues until cooked, removed from skillet, and then sauteed the veggies and followed the remaining directions. Made the Jasmine rice in the rice cooker like always. Doubled the shrimp. The veggies I used: 1/2 sweet onion, 1 red pepper, 2 cups sugar snap peas, 1 zuchinni, 1 carrot.  Will definitely make again! Had a nice kick, but not too spicy.

This was great!  Served it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I went with the red pepper flakes instead of chili paste.  I used a tsp. and it was pretty spicy.  for veggies, I used yellow onion, red pepper, baby portobello mushrooms, snow peas, and zucchini.  Also used brown rice instead of jasmine.  Will make again!

I thought this was a great dish. Only changes I made were that I used apricot preserves instead of orange and added jalapeños to the sautéed veggies. I also used raw shrimp. Great flavor, will make again.

This was a tasty dish!  I added different veggies though...red pepper, white onion, carrots, bean sprouts, mushrooms, broccoli, and snap peas.  I also thickened the sauce at the end with a mixture of cornstarch and water.  I'll make this again!

I followed the recipe, almost to a tee (I doubled the shrimp - I had to, I didn't want to arm wrestle anyone for an extra shrimp or two).  The dish was delicious and so easy to prepare.  It's a great mid-week meal for a busy family.  It was my first occasion to cook Jasmine rice.  I looked at the directions on the rice box - looked ant the recipe, and ended up following the Shrimp Bowl Recipe (3 cups water/2 cups rice - no salt - no oil).  It was PERFECT and really brought the Asian flavors together.  With the sweet and salty sauce on the dish, the simple jasmine rice completely balanced the dish.  Thanks Sarah B!

Followed a reviewer's suggestion to reduce the ginger. Otherwise, followed the recipe and we thought it was wonderful. Just a hint of heat. Will definately fix it again.

Used sweet Chile sauce rather than paste.  Also added 1 tsp chili powder to give it a little more spice. Loved it!

Excellent recipe. Stir fried onions, mushrooms  in garlic first. . Removed from pan.  Used raw shrimp sautéed in butter and garlic. Added sauce before they were done.  Added veggies to shrimp mixture along with snow peas. Used oj instead of marmalade and chipotle ketchup spice instead of chili paste. Cooked rice on stove using directions from jasmine package. Was perfect.

I've made this several times.  My family loves how fresh it tastes with a great flavor profile.  It's very easy and quick to make.  I only marinade the shrimp about 30 minutes and have also added chicken.

I used raw shrimp and marinated it before cooking, and it had great flavor.  I used a variety of vegetables, and after they cooked, I added back the shrimp, Chinese egg noodles and the rest of the sauce.  The noodles soaked up most of the sauce, but I would make less next time.  It was very good.
