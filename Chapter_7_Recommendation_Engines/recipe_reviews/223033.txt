This was good!  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot!  Did not add the sugar, thought the soup had a sweet flavor as is.  Froze half the batch.  Yum!

This was tasty.. I made half the recipe but cut back the bell peppers a little.. The sour cream and horseradish topping is really good. I also pureed  a few servings of the soup.. yum

I didn't make it exactly as recipe called, but it is good and health and tasty.  I was using veggies I had, so I left out the cabbage and the green beans, but added zucchini  and some tomatoes. I used dried parsley and added quite a bit more than recipe called for, also added some garlic and used some savory blend sea salt.   I will make it again.

This is very nice - a good basic vegetable soup. I didn't have enough broth so added a small can of V8 along with the broth I had. It makes a lot so I froze some. For breakfast I heated a bowl in the microwave and added a beaten egg, cooked a bit more. It was good!

Love all the vegetables. Did not have any success grating the peppers, ended up fine dicing. Thought it was pretty bland so instead of horseradish we used Sweet Thai Chili sauce and added diced cooked chicken and topped with avocado. So I basically just used the veggie combination.

recipe turned out nice, due to so many vegetables was more like stew than soup but taste was excellent. Would have liked the egg dumpling recipe with it as this would clearly have been a meal then. The horseradish and sour cream were a nice pairing.
