I fixed this for Thanksgiving, It was very easy and very tasty. However, My kids do not like cream corn, I added 2 cans regular corn. They ate it. The best thing was, the next day, the leftovers tasted as good as when it was fresh.

Served this to about 30 people at Thanksgiving and had none left over.  Have been asked to prepare it again for Christmas dinner.  Very tasty!

This recipe was a hit with my husband who is a true "mash potatoes and corn" lover. He mixed it with his potatoes and couldn't stop complimenting the dish.

This was OK.  As with the other reviews, it was a bit runny and needed some kick. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and that did the trick.  Not sure if I'll make it again..

I think this needed a little something extra to spice it up, but it was still good.

Loved it and will make this again.  The only thing is that I will use a can of cream corn and a can of regular corn instead of 2 cans of cream corn

We tried this recipe for Thanksgiving, as suggested in a couple of the posts but no one at the table liked it. It was bland, runny and didn't go with the rest of the meal.

This was good, but a little runny. I used regular canned corn as I don't like creamed corn.

awesome side dish! I tried it just as written and loved it. Another time I substituted a can of chopped green chilis instead of bell pepper and it definately gave it a spicy kick! Garnished with bread crumbs, croutons and cheese then baked til brown. Great!

I made this exactly as printed since I'm not a fan of altering the recipe and THEN giving it a bad rating... As is, this recipe is hum drum. I made it for thanksgiving and I was disappointed since it had some decent reviews. My brother and dad liked it, but my mom and I agreed it was "eh," definitely not a keeper. Will not be making again.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It tasted good but was way to runny.  Most of it was left.  I'm going to try it for Christmas without the milk and maybe with one can of regular corn to give it more body.  Very festive looking with the red and green bellpepper.
