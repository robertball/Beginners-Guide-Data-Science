Very authentic.  When I told my Brazilian husband  I was going to make Pao de Queijo he said they'd never turn out authentic because we can't get the ingredients here.  When he tasted them, he declared them authentic!  I did use half and half but next time I'm going to try it with 2% milk to see if there's a difference because they are kind of rich.  I sprayed some cooking spray on my hands when I went to shape the balls because I found that the dough was very sticky.  Worked really well.

We loved, loved, loved these. Using half 'n half gave the rolls the softest texture and the cheese made them gooey inside. Definitely a keeper recipe. I set them on the table, then I asked my kids to taste and rate them. In 5 minutes they had completely disappeared. They are addictive! They puff up a lot in the oven leaving these air pockets of gooey goodness inside. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! I've never had Pao de Queijo before and am hooked! The measurements here were perfect even with using only 1 egg instead of 2. I was following a different recipe from this site that was failing me and ended up referring to this one to compare ingredients and help me fix my third attempt. Voila! This recipe saved the day and was used for my actual Brazilian themed dinner 1-2 weeks later. I used coconut milk as I cannot tolerate regular milk, but I think any plant based milk would work. I forgot to let the dough rest one time and the bread was still good, but much better if you let it rest a little. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I love this bread. It has the chewiness missing in GF breads. I have made it with ricotta cheese and it was great too. I make it more liquid to have a self flattening dough when it bakes. I use this for pizzas and even crackers. Very versatile. Play with this.

Absolutely amazing! The only change I made was I used about 1 3/4 c. parmesan cheese and 3/4 c. extra sharp cheese. To us they were perfect. HINT: my batter was very soupy, I think because I missed the step of stirring in the tapioca starch/flour when you take the hot half and half mixture off the stove and rather stirred it in about 20 minutes later. HOWEVER: I pulled out my mini muffin tin, sprayed it with olive oil, and poured in the batter. They baked up to perfection! (I will say this misstep made making them easier as I didn't have to deal with the gloppy batter and rolling them into balls.  I may even do this the next time I make them.) I will definitely make them again.
