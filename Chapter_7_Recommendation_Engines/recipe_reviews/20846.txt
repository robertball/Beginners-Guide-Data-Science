Was the hit of the office potluck.  One thing I found so as to not have it become too watery, is to let the chopped watermelon drain in a colander for a while; otherwise this has replaced my grilled veggies as the "you have to bring this to the bbq" item

I made this for a party last night and everyone liked it.  I used the watermelon halves as bowls and served it with Hint of Lime tortilla chips.  I didn't adhere to the stated measurements, but used whatever I bought.  I hollowed out the entire watermelon, used an entire bunch of green onions, two bell peppers, 3 limes, 1 bunch of cilantro and 3 fresh jalapenos.  I drained the watermelon and used the juice for watermelon martinis.  P.S.  Everyone probably knows this, but I didn't.  Use gloves when you chop and seed fresh jalapenos. I didn't and my hands burned like fire throughout the entire night.

who knew something this simple could be so good!  I had almost a half a seedless watermelon that was a little too ripe for eating.  I doubled the recipe.  Only changes I made were to add 1 extra tbsp. of onion(only had red onion), and used fresh garlic (1 large clove for the double recipe) and added salt to taste.  I did only use 2 tbsp. of lime juice but grated the zest of some of the lime rind.  This allowed the lime flavor to come through without the extra liquid.  Just drain it in a colander after dicing and it gets alot of the liquid out.  This was such a refreshing salsa, I ate it plain for a salad.  This would also make a great summer side dish.  Unbelievable blend of flavor and the textures.  The sweetness mixed with the other basic salsa flavors was outstanding.  I loved the crunch of it also.  A wonderful salsa/sidedish that would also make a great conversation piece at a gathering; no one would expect watermelon to be used in something like this.  Just look at the calorie/carb count also!  Another great plus.

Man, was this great! I made this for a bunch of friends, and when we ran out of chips, people started eating it straight with a spoon. I added a few dashes of a couple kinds of hot sauce to spice it up. It's best served very, very, cold.
Thanks for this interesting and delicious alternative salsa!

This is a great recipe! The combo is a little strange and I just had to try it. The watermelon is a great filler because it essentially has little taste and adds a nice clean and refreshing note to the peppers and spices. I also added more jalepeno and garlic salt, but adjust to your taste. Very good with taco chips. All the skeptics in my family loved it.

I made this tonight for a family birthday get together. Everyone loved it except my husband, but he doesen't like hardly any food. I had to tell them it was watermelon. I didn't follow the recipe exact. I used what I had. I know I put in extra lime juice. And also drained the melon. The kids took all the left overs home. Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good!  Just like the salsa used with grilled foods in expensive restaurants!  I added a chopped mango the second time. I drain the salsa in a colander just before serving.  It will continue to weep--just keep draining.  YUM!

This recipe was great.  I drained the watermelon and tried to keep out as much liquid as possible, but the bottom of the bowl was still pretty much all liquid.  My husband and my sister both said that was their favorite part and asked me not to drain it so much next time.  Made it for a family bbq and all who tried it loved it.

A five star hit at the neighborhood bbq! I should have doubled the recipe. In order to keep it from getting too watery mix the garlic salt with the chopped watermelon prior to mixing with the remaining ingredients. It will help draw out some of the moisture when straining the watermelon.

LOVED this! Draining it is key (thanks for the suggestion via reviews!) - I was amazed at how long I was able to drain it (an hour?) Kind of eyeballed the measurements - just short of a whole (small'ish) watermelon, a whole jalapeno, hence more cilantro, lime juice and onion. Loved the "hint of lime" tortilla chips with this as someone suggested, and can't wait to try this on top of grilled chicken (as yet ANOTHER person suggested!) Such an intriguging taste combination!

this was amazing! it was a big hit at my pool party. so refreshing on a hot summer day in Florida.  i highly recommend chopping this the night before, draining it the next day, and THEN add the other ingredients.   i drained as i chopped, added the ingredients, and thought it would be fine, but had watermelon soup the next morning (it is WATERmelon, after all). by the time i drained it, i feel it diluted the flavors, so definitely let sit overnight, drain, and then add other ingredients. if possible, let that sit for a few hours in the fridge so that the ingredients can meld well before serving. it was fun to serve this in the watermelon bowl as well. i added in quite a bit of garlic and garlic powder.

Very refreshing salsa with a little bite (spiced it up a bit more than the recipe suggested). A neat salsa recipe to "show off" with.

quite good. I used red onion instead of green, and added mango for fun. I even tricked my brother - he thought it was tomato salsa.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  My daughter and I are not tomato fans and found this to be an excellant alternative.  Am going to try it with more jalapeno next time.

I tried this for a summer gathering of some gal friends. I used the watermelon as the bowl for the salsa. Everyone was surprised at how much they liked it. Even some that didn't want to even attempt a fruit salsa were surprised they liked it. Served with light corn tortillas, but several just ate it like it is without the chips.

Really good with modifications! Needs more salt, lime, cilantro. Followed others' suggestions and drained the watermelon in a colander. With my changes, it's a 5 star!

YOU MUST LET IT SET!!  I tried this right after making it and I wasn't a fan, but by that night I couldn't stay out of it.  Hubby couldn't get pass salsa without tomatoes, but I brought it to work to share and we all rave about it.  Even passed the recipe on.  It's a definite summer salsa, refreshing with a bite.

Good way to use up left over watermelon. I also allowed the melon to sit overnight (cubed small) in fridge, then drained and added the other ingredients early in the day. I didn't have cilantro so I used fresh ground coriander (seed from cilantro plant). I added both minced vidalia and green onion. I only had red pepper so used that. I did add a bit more salt as it lacked something until I re-salted. Added a couple sprinkles of Cumin too. I really liked this even though it seems kinda strange.

Cool and refreshing, with a bite!    This recipe took first place at my block party recently!  I skipped the garlic and doubled the onion, cilantro and jalapeno.  My suggestions: mix a few hours ahead of time, drain the liquid and add salt JUST before serving (the salt draws out the moisture and "ages" the melon but is necessary to the flavor.)  Next time I will look for a dish that allows me to serve the salsa on ice to keep it cold longer.

This was a big hit at numerous picnics.  Doubling the lime juice, using hint of lime tortilla chips and draining were good tips I used from reviews I read.  Some people didn't know it was watermelon and thought it was tomatoes.

I made this for our company lunch. Used 1/2 of a med. size watermelon and tripled the recipe using the same ingredients. Used a whole lime, more cilantro, 1 seeded jalapeno, 1 clove of minced garlic and salt. Good idea on straining the watermelon. Made it the night before and kept the greens in a different container. In the morning, I still had to drain the watermelon again and then mixed the green ingredients together and put it in a hollowed out watermelon shell. When it was time to serve, there was quite a bit of juice that developed and more juice the longer it sits. There was barely a hotness to the salsa. They thought it was very different and enjoyed it with hint of lime chips. A few wanted the recipe. This could be a good salsa base for other types of fruits instead of watermelon.

I can see where this recipe has potential.  However, I do not recommend making this on for an outside event.  By the time we ate, the salsa was watering and lacked all flavor.

This was so great! The watermelon I chose was not fully "ripe" because I read that many people had a salsa that was a little too watery. I think this was a great choice. It was still sweet, but not so watery. The flavors really do contrast so well. This was an absolute hit. I will make it again and again. Thank you!!!!

OH. MY. GOSH.  This was fantastic!  Definitely let the watermelon sit in a strainer for a few minutes after cutting it to get some of the extra liquid out.  And if you can let the salsa sit for a couple of hours before serving it gets even better.  Yum Yum Yum.

I've been making this salsa for several years now and every time I'm asked for the recipe.  Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day I better not show up without this salsa or I never hear the end of it.  It's so refreshing.  I double or triple the recipe each time I make it cause I could (and sometimes do) eat one batch all by myself.  Serve with Tostito Scoops - you definitely want to get some of the juice with each bite and the Scoops work perfectly.  Hint - put your "patience hat" on and dice the watermelon & green pepper into 1/4" dice and the Jalapeno into a very fine dice for best results.   Enjoy!!!!

Maybe I ruined the recipe by adding an extra jalapeno and another fresh hot pepper from my friend's garden, but it was way too spicy and strange-tasting, and I love spicy food. No one really got into it at our fourth of July get together. I think it might have been better, however, on fish or chicken than with chips. (And really it's my fault for making it too spicy.)

Wonderful!  I did not use any bell pepper...family preference.  I did add fresh garlic and more green onion and lime juice and zest than called for.  You do have to drain before serving.  My 10 year old loved this with grilled swordfish.  I served with regular tortillas and the hint of lime and everyone liked them equally.  Thanks for the recipe!

THIS STUFF ROCKS!! Best salsa ever! I added habanero peppers and a tomato or two just to fool people. It's also alot less work chopping if you just take everything in chunks and stick it in a food processor and pulse it a few times! (Not the watermelon) I make a ton of this and cold pack it in mason jars, that way I can eat it even when watermelon isn't in season. As far as the taste, nobody can put their finger on the non-tomato flavor until they happen to find a missed watermelon seed and then they wonder where it came from? "Pace" or the other jarred salsa's have nothing on this!

I have made this salsa on several occassions for several different groups of people and each time everyone raves!!!!  The sweet of the watermelon is complemented with the spicy!!  What a great combination and it is even better after it sits overnight.  I ususally serve with the hint of lime tortilla chips - it enhances the flavor even more.

This is really good!  I suspected it to be too liquidy from some other reviews, so as I chopped the watermelon I put it in a strainer until I was ready to mix everything together.  This seemed to work well, it was still a little liquidy but no salsa I've ever had hasn't had any liquid :)
Thanks Dawn!

Yum!  Good recipe, easy to prepare also.  I followed another reviewer's advice and drained this several times prior to serving.  I think it is better if you let it chill for awhile before eating it, the flavors meld much better together.  This is a fun snack to share and people are so surprised with the watermelon.  Thanks for sharing such an interesting recipe.

What a unique and wonderful flavor. Like others, I let the watermelon drain for a few min. Used kosher salt and a fresh clove of garlic instead of garlic salt; vidalia onion instead of green onion. I didn't measure anything but I would guess that I used alot more that 2T of cilantro. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and all of the flavors blend together to create something truly unique. I served it over broiled tilapia, but could have just eaten it as a salad.

Yum! One son made this and chilled it, then made a pot of brown rice. Another son peeled the melon rind. I sliced some red onion and allowed it to sit in white vinegar with a touch of stevia.  Next, I made a rub of paprika, chili powder, onion powder, cumin, & salt, and used as rub on pollock.  Allowed that to sit while straightening up kitchen & setting the table.  I minced & sauteed the watermelon rind while slicing one onion (long thin slices), added it when sliced. While these were cooking, I diced some green onions and avocado, prepped a little bowl of queso fresco & cleaned a green salad.  Just before adding the fish, I threw in a couple cloves of garlic for a minute.  After the pollock was cooked, I added a couple tablespoons of lime juice to the onion and fish, and rearranged the onions onto the top of the fish for serving family style in the kitchen.  At serving time, each serving of fish was nestled into a bed of brown rice which had been allowed to sit for a few minutes with another good dash of lime and topped with cumin.  All was topped with:  the avocados, green onions, the queso fresco, and your salsa (I didn't have a jalapeno *sigh*).  To the side was a large bed of Romaine, tossed first with a touch of oil, then topped with its own good helping of marinated red onion.  Fabulous dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.  I really wanted to show it off, which got the creative juices going. We'll make this often! (BTW son may have added too much salt- I added more melon)

I stumbled upon this recipe a few years ago when I needed to use up some watermelon before it went bad.  I tend to just "eyeball" the ingredients, and it always turns out amazing.  Friends now request this every summer.  One friend called it "watermelon crack" because he couldn't stop eating it!

I made this for a family picnic and after they got over the surprise it wasn't tomato salsa, they loved it! We're going to two more picnics soon I'm making this. I agree with another review, the watermelon needs to be drained. It's even better the next day with more flavor from the cilantro.

I have already made this five times this summer and not one time did it turn out bad.  The quality of the watermelon does make a difference so try and pick a good one.  I do double this recipe and use Toritlla Scoops so you can scoop a lot into your mouth! This recipe just screams "SUMMER"!

Yummy.  I added extra green onions, fresh minced garlic and extra cilantro also.  And salt which it definitely needed.   It was good and I'll make again.

Made this for tailgating and it held up very well in the heat!  The flavors were perfect together and great for a hot day in the sun. Served it with Scoops so you could catch all the juice and not drip. Next time I will make it the night before and strain more of the juice off...but either way it wasn't too "wet".  Everyone enjoyed it because it was something different.

Made this for the holiday weekend and it was pretty good, and fun to watch people try it. The only thing is the recipe does not call for enough jalapeno so I added more...it still wasn't hot enough (for me). If you like a sweet and refreshing salsa this recipe is for you.

Fabulous! Big hit at a party. I used a smidge more lime, jalepeno and garlic salt then recipe called for as it needed a little kick.

Yum!  Used regular white onion instead of green onion because that's what I had.  This is fresh and unusual; the perfect use for summer's bounty of melon.  Will make again.

I've been searching for a good tomato-less salsa recipe for my father (he's allergic) and this is it! Wonderful!! I've made this 3 times now and I would suggest just a few minor tweaks: I actually double the cilantro and green onion AND we eat the red, sweet "heart" of the watermelon and use the rest for salsa. I like a little of the whiter melon (the part you generally don't eat) to add a little textural variety to the salsa.  Double or triple the recipe -- it goes FAST. WONDERFUL!!

Surprisingly good. Sweet and Spicy. I always prefer to make and rate recipes how the author intended them to be. I would make this again, however, I would use fresh garlic and skip the garlic salt. Not enough garlic flavor. But other than that...very good.

When I told my friends that I was going to try out this recipe, several of them doubted that it'd be tasty. I made it yesterday though and man, was it good. I didn't follow the exact measurements.. less jalapeno, more cilantro and green onion. Still real good though, I highly recommend it.

really good and a pleasant new twist from regular salsa. i love the combo of flavors that watermelon and bell peppers make. I did not use a whole jalepeno b/c I was afraid it would be too hot. so of course it wasn't hot enough. will use the recommended amount next tiem.

I've got a very similar recipe that gets great reviews but a few additions are finely diced cantalope and red onion instead of the green onions. Such a refreshing summer salsa served with lime seasoned corn chips!!!!

Really liked the contrast of the cool watermelon with the jalapeno.  I changed  it up a bit and added Italian parsley (not a big cilantrophile) and omitted the green pepper (not on hand).  Just a really nice refreshing salsa on a hot muggy day!  Thanks!

Everyone seemed to enjoy this. I too think it needed more of a kick. I thought even if the watermelon was more flavorful it would have added more to the salsa. I would make this again but add more jalapeno as others suggested.

I was a little nervous about making this salsa as it seemed so strange.  I am only giving it 4 stars as of now because personally I think the recipe needs a little more kick, whether it be more jalapeno or maybe more garlic.  I'm sure once I read through more of the reviews I will be able to successfully modify it to suit my tastes... but overall, this was a great dish.  The watermelon adds an interesting coolness.  :)

This was a great change from the traditional salsa recipes.  I doubled the recipe and added three times the amount of lime and jalapenos and cilantro.  I did as others suggested and drained the watermelon for about 2 hours before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.  I drained it again prior to serving. It was great with chips and the next day as just a salad. Definitely a keeper.

I tripled the recipe for a party and it ALL disappeared with only 10 people at the party!  I omitted green pepper (personal preference) and tripled the lime juice as well as adding the zest of all three limes.  Serving it with the 'hint of lime' tortilla chips really was the trick though.  !Thanks to the other reviewers!)  Some of the guests thought it was made with tomatoes!

Well I just made this over the fourth of July weekend and it was absolutely incredible!! It was such a nice and different twist than a regular salsa. I also took the advise of paring it up with the lime tortilla chips and it made it even better. I also added chopped red onion to the mix as well. I mixed everything the night before except the watermelon, so it could sit and marinate overnight. Then drained and added the watermelon the next morning. I gave the recipe out to a couple of other people that loved it as well. I have another cook-out next weekend and am definatly making it again... Thank you for the recipe, Dawn...

This salsa is AMAZING!  It's true that while the watermelon looks like tomatoes, it sure doesn't taste like them.  Very light and refreshing!  I made my double batch two days in advance (in hindsight, not the best idea...I think one day in advance would have been sufficient), and took it out of the refrigerator to drain in a colander a couple of times per day.  The lime tortilla chips suggested did enhance the flavor.  The only substitution I made was adding Rose's Lime juice (which is sweetened) in place of regular lime juice (I already had it in the house).  I think it actually helped flavor an otherwise-not-so-flavorful watermelon.  Thank you Dawn for the really great recipe!

Personally, after reading all these good reviews I was excited, but I really hated this salsa. Wasn't hot or spicy and it just tasted like watermelon. Maybe I did something wrong, but it's just a bunch of chopped up stuff in a bowl, so  don't know. :(

My family all loves salsa, and they loved this recipe. I did drain the watermelon well after chopping, and because we are big garlic eaters, I substituted the garlic salt for fresh garlic. Very, very good!!!

I made this for our 4th of July cookout.  I also made my famous (and most-requested) fresh tomato salsa.  At the end of the evening, there was none of my tomato salsa left and just a bit of this.  Considering that guests included a lot people who are generally weary of new things, I thought this recipe was a success.  Personally, I really liked the flavor.  I combined the ingredients the night before and drained before serving.  While my original recipe may get more a workout, I am sure this will be made again before the summer is over.

Excellent recipie!  Great taste!  It looks like regular salsa, but when you take a bite you're in for a wonderful surprise.  Definately that hot/cold sensation.  My only recomendation is to use a seedless watermellon; picking those seeds out took way too much of my time!

We weren't sure about the combination of watermelon and jalapenos, but we were amazed by how well the flavors worked together and we received rave reviews from everyone that tasted this recipe. Went very well with Tostito "Scoops" and pita chips. Already planning to make it again. Definitely recommended.

I got rave reviews at our office treat day. It was a perfect addition to our "Summer Celebration" theme. I will most definitely be making this again and again - but next time, I'm going to double (or triple?) the recipe so I have some to enjoy at home. There was nothing left!

Served this as an appetizer with Tostido Lime chips and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  It's light, fresh and would be great served on fish.  Definitely needs to be drained before serving, so store in separate container.

This was a BIG hit at my family get together. There were a lot of sceptics but one taste and they were diving in for more. Better than basic salsa as the watermelon cools done the spiceyness of the jalepeno.

My kids just sampled this at the Farmer's Market and begged me to buy it.  I paid $5 for a 250 mL container!  Then I came home and checked Allrecipes.  I can't believe I paid that much for something so easy!  The ingredients are exactly the same but of course I don't know what quantities they used so I can't comment on this particular recipe but I think I would be inclined to use the whole amount of lime juice if not extra.  It's a great flavor.

This was a big hit at a bbq.  I made a few changes - used yellow onion instead of green, doubled the whole recipe, used twice as much onion, 2 cloves of garlic pressed, and added some lime zest.  Can't wait to make again!

AMAZING! I left out the cilantro because I hate it and added habanero peppers because we like it hot! The sweetness of the melon pairs perfectly with the flavor if the habanero (and the orange color adds a nice touch). I took a milder version to a work potluck and it was a huge hit - everyone wanted the recipe!

Yum! Very tasty. The watermelon really makes the heat from the jalapenos tolerable to wimps like me. My husband doesn't love watermelon and he even liked this. Thanks!

OH MY HECK! I made this for the first time for a church event....and it was SOOO amazing. Intead of using a fresh lime, i chose to use some in the bottle...next time a fresh lime will be the way to go!  I loved this & so did everyone who tried it.

This is delicious. I added cantaloupe and lime zest and juice. My family loved it. Very similar to melon salad we had at an dinner theatre .I also substituted red onion.

I was in a hurry when I made this so I didn't read the reviews and my salsa was more like soup than a chunky salsa. It was good though! Next time I'll add some salt to my watermelon and let the juice drain before I add it to the rest of the ingredients. And I'll use red onion instead of green since I would have liked a stronger onion taste. Thanks!

Great summer salsa and a great way to use up extra watermelon! I left out the hot pepper because of my two year old and added garlic instead of garlic salt. I also sprinkled in a bit of sea salt. Served with grilled Halibut!

We loved this salsa!Put the chopped watermelon in a strainer to drain while you chop the  other ingredients. allow the flavors to combine for a few hours before serving and I always add way more cilantro(just big fans!) and usually use yellow and orange bell pepper for a prettier presentation.  Kids and adults alike love this salsa!!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I've made it a few times, and everyone loves it (except my husband who doesn't like watermelon).  I actually serve it with cinnamon chips that I make by brushing a tortilla with butter, and sprinkling with cinnamon sugar - then cutting into wedges and baking until golden and crispy.  YUM!!

This was so refreshing.  Worked nicely with a spicy main dish.  It worked better as a salad than a salsa.  I would recommend extra peppers and smaller pieces of watermelon.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This was such an interesting recipe and conversation piece!  I had everyone trying to guess what it was made with.  It had a nice, refreshing taste.  I added regular onions to the mix, so yummy!!!  I can't wait to trick more people on its secret ingredient!  Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious! I was looking for a fruit salsa and this one was even better than I had hoped. I made it to go with grilled chicken, but it was so good that my boyfriend and I ended up eating most of it with chips before we made it to dinner!

OMG this recipe is so much fun!  I prepped it tonight for the grilled fish tacos (from this site) I'm making tomorrow and I sneaked a taste- WOW!  Even before the flavors had time to mingle this was great!! The combo of the sweet and cool watermelon with the spicy heat of the jalapeno and the green onions is FABULOUS!  I actually omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand, thought I may stop and pick one up tomorrow.  Also, because I am letting this chill overnight I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt so all of the moisture doesn't get sucked out of the melon. I can't wait for dinner tomorrow!!

A wonderful new taste to traditional salsa anc chips. Great party or tailgating dip, especially on a hot summer day. I add green onions and a whole jalapeno pepper, but be careful because the longer it chills the hotter the taste. Over time the watermelon begins absorbing the pepper juices.

This is a huge hit every time I make it.  It's cool and spicy -- I must admit that I usually use a whole green pepper, 2 jalapenos, and a whole bunch of green onions.  I find that it helps to drain the watermelon a bit before mixing everything together.  My favourite All Recipes recipe!

I made this last night for a birthday cookout and everyone loved it. My nieces little 4yr. old would say ummhh with each bite she took.  Everyone was surprised about the watermelon. I will make a lot more of this!

I could easily eat this every day! Fresh and light, it tricks everyone into thinking it is tomato salsa, but IT'S NOT! Great with chips, but delicious with quesadillas, fish, or chicken.  A great recipe that you just have to try.

VERY different.  Everyone @ my BBQ raved about it except one friend who said "My mind keeps telling me it should taste like tomatoes". The reason this was said was that when you dice the watermelon, this salsa looks just like any other tomato salsa.  Tastes better the next day, that is if you are lucky enough to have leftovers. Use jar Jalapenos~easier and gives more of a punch.

This truly the best dish I've had in years.  It is different and yet it blends so nicely.  I've tried this on some many different people they love and beg for the recipe.  Also it is easy and ready to go in minutes.  Add this one to your next summer party or when ever you have a hankering for watermelon......

I made this for my grandmother's 90th birthday party. It went over well. Some of my family didn't believe that it was watermelon at all. Several people asked for the recipie. I was not prepared for that. 

The only thing that I changed was I couldn't find green onions. I used white. no one seemed to mind.

A huge success at our outdoor summer BBQ!  I doubled the recipe and it was still gone in less than an hour!
We really enjoyed the taste more when it was cold, so we kept it on ice.  A fabulous, HEALTHY, summertime treat!

This is absolutely perfect as is.  I did substitute red peppers for the green.  Green peppers don't like me.  I usually have to make a double batch, however, as we have a few in the family who prefer a spoon to a chip.  Many thanks!

I thought it was pretty good.  Everyone else thought it was incredible.  I will make this many more times.  The lime torilla chips really make the difference.  I also used all fresh ingredients.  I recommend using a seedless watermelon to save time.  If you are using fresh cilantra you might want to try just 1.5 tablespoons.

Am I ever glad I tried this!  I was feeling like doing something different, and came across this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I figured I'd give it a whirl.  It was fantastic, and everyone was really surprised at how good it was.  The watermelon is so refreshing and different.  I doubled the lime juice, and served them with the lime tortilla chips.  Excellent recipe!

I brought this salsa to a party at a friend's cottage recently, and it was gone in no time. A great big hit! I doubled the lime juice and garlic salt, and as some reviewers suggested, I drained it well before serving. I will absolutely make this one again!!

Different, but not as different tasting as you'd think.  It truly is hot and cool at the same time.  What a great alternative for people with tomato allergies!  Very good!

Excellent! The line and cilantro went surprisingly well with the watermelon. I made a trial batch last weekend and am making more tomorrow. The only thing I plan on changing is the amount of jalapeño; I couldn't taste it at all and didn't get any heat.

switched purple onions for the green onions- we thought it was yummy, a little on the sweet side but then again the watermelon was sweet. I used one of those small seedless watermelons. Thanks

This is great!  And gets even better the longer it sets.  I did remove the jalapeno seeds because I was afraid it would be too hot for me.  But it wasn't.  I will leave the seeds next time.    Definitely odd combination of ingredients but it worked so well together.

I thought this was okay, but just didn't taste right with salt in it.  I have never been a fan of salt on watermelon, so maybe that's what the problem was.  I think I'll try it one more time, without the salt.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as directed.  One thing that may have been more helpful is knowing how small to chop the watermelon.  I think it would have been much easier to eat on chips if it was in 1/2 inches or smaller cubes like you'd do for pico de gallo. My family didn't like this.  It was just okay in my opinion.  Thank you for the post though - it's fun to try something new!

We enjoyed the difference this brings, but missed the more savory/tart flavors of a traditional tomato salsa. Still, I can see it being a hit at a party if it doesn't get too watery sitting out.

This is VERY good! 
Of course, like so many others, I changed it a bit to our tastes. We used yellow bell pepper (don't like green), and a couple dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce instead of the jalapeno, which we also don't like.  The Frank's added enough heat for the "fire".  This is good the first day, second day, etc etc, if it lasts that long!  I've already had two requests this year, and we're picking up the stuff to make it again this weekend.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

MAKE THIS!!!! I was looking for a new recipe to make for a get together and I found this. Very skeptical using watermelon instead of tomatoes but tried it anyway. My husband does not like homemade salsa but he LOVED this! It is very refreshing and you can control the amount of heat you put in. Definitely take others advice and let the diced SEEDLESS watermelon drain for a few minutes in a paper towel lined strainer. Naturally, you will not be able to get all the juice out and that's ok. The only jalapeno peppers I had were jarred and they worked perfectly fine. The smell and taste is so refreshing. Great with Scoops, Hint of Lime, and Pepper Jack tortilla chips. Great conversation piece too:)

Made this for a gathering this weekend. Guests loved it and it had just the right amount of heat. I didn't use cilantro because the husband is not a fan, but I felt it was definitely missing something  without it. Also, I used chopped garlic and salt instead of garlic salt. Will make again for sure.

Absolutely delicious and VERY easy to make!  Very fresh flavors.  Let sit for awhile to allow the flavors to blend.  Perfect with salty chips!

This is an exceptionally good recipe. I really do not like the traditional salsa but this is just a 'think outside the box' recipe and I have made it twice. They were hits both times. Just stick to the recipe and it will turn out perfect each time.

I've made this quite a few times, and everyone has loved it!  People were very surprised that they liked this salsa, minus tomatoes!  They say they like it better than tomato salsa, and the combination of the cool and hot tastes great!  I added more cilantro and jalapeno ( you can tweak it to your taste) and drained a bit before serving.  I used the jar jalapeno slices, it seemed to add more flavor.

The only thing in the world that I won't eat are tomatoes. I know. BUT, this salsa recipe is a great replacement for chunky tomato salsas! Refreshing, yet a kick. A great combo to keep you coming back for more. I never have leftovers with this recipe.

Wow! Love this stuff..as did my guests! I added some fresh chopped cayenne peppers and subbed fresh banana peppers (not pickled!) for the green pepper just cause that's what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This is awesome!!! I made this for 4th of July. Many people didn't know this was watermelon at first. I had a hard time staying away from it. I had several people ask me about the recipe. I used grated garlic from a glass jar & salt. I think it's important that you make it ahead of time and drain it right before serving.

Great summer recipe.   Easy to prepare but takes time with the chopping of ingredients.  It is one of those recipes that during a hot summer's day it is so refreshing.  It was served during a pool side bbq.  Everyone loved this different appetizer.

This is still the best salsa ever ... . I always use red onion and turn up the heat with more peppers. I also  use an ice crean scoop to scoop out the melon; put the melon ball in an egg slicer..cut one direction; turn and cut the other..nice uniform slices and much easier to pick up on chips

This is very unusual salsa, I used this as a topping for mahi mahi. But don`t serve this at once, refregirate for a few hours before serving, the taste will be much better (I served this just after preparing and the salsa was a little bland).

This was very good and a hit.  My jalepeno also was not very strong so it lacked in the "fire" department.  I have made it several times, though, and it was well received.

Very interesting, and very good.  I used half a red bell pepper, and half a green bell pepper instead of the one the recipe calls for b/c I didn't want it to be overpowering in spiciness.  Very good-used freeze-dried cilantro b/c that's what I had on hand, and it was well-received.  My sister loved it b/c, as she stated, "it doesn't have the density of tomatoes in a regular tomato-based salsa."

I love fruit salsas and this is no exception.  I made it for a party I had and everyone, upon initial glace thought it was a tomato salsa until they scooped it up and tasted it.  Everyone loved it.

I love watermelon (with and without salt) and fresh pico de gallo, but I don't know... the flavors didn't work as well together as I thought they would, even after marinating for a day. It's worth a try though.

Incredible Salsa!  This was the hit of our margarita party!  Some people complained there was too much green pepper in it, but that's probably just personal preference.  Next time, I think I will spice it up more because that's how we like it!

Excellent. Made it two nights before serving to guests. The "fire" was more pronounced when first made, and lessened by
serving time. Guests raved!  Very refreshing.

Something different and really tasty! Everyone loved at the July 4th party I took this to.  The only change I made was that instead of garlic salt, I used part garlic powder and kosher salt and I also drained the diced watermelon for a few hours to help with the water content of the salsa.

This was really good and got tons of raves and requests for the recipe. I think next time i will use the entire jalapeno for a but more kick. the best part is not telling ppl that it's not a tomato salsa and having them ask why its so sweet..DRAIN DRAIN DRAIN

I cut my watermelon into two different sizes so that I could try this as a salsa & as a salad & I did drain it (the salad needed to be drained but we felt that the salsa needed teh liquid I drained off).  We thought the salad was kinda blah  but we love watermelon so enjoyed it. The salsa was also pretty blah  until we jazzed it up w/ a lot more lime (I copied Tunisian'swife & used zest), cilantro (we're not even big cilantro lovers), jalapenos, garlic (I used real) & minced sweet onions. It was really good w/ lime tortilla chips...thanks to whoever first suggested them!

I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive to try this recipe. I had a lot of watermelon and wanted to use it up so I figured I would give this recipe a try. I made my boyfriend try it first...HE LOVED IT!!!!! I am now addicted to this salsa, too. I can't get enough.

This is actually pretty good!  Definitely drain watermelon first after cutting otherwise you'll get too much liquid.  I found the original recipe kind of bland so I doubled the salt, added chopped garlic (didn't have garlic salt), and doubled the lime and jalapeno.  My husband says it's missing pico de gallo seasoning.  Will have to try that next time.

I was a little skeptical when I saw the ingredients, but it turned out absolutely wonderful! I made this over the weekend and served it with grilled chicken. Light and refreshing on a hot summer night. I took another reviewers advice and let the watermelon drain in a colander before mixing with the other ingredients. My husband told me between bites that is a "keeper" and "I need to make it more often". Thanks for a great recipe.

ok, i know most everybody liked this, and one of my friends did, but the rest of my family and i couldn't take more than a bite....i don't know if it's because we have a similar recipe to this one (using tomatoes), but something about the watermelon and cilantro mix didn't go well for us.

This was a different approach to salsa. Very good after it had time to meld the flavors together. I served it with tortilla chips. I left out the cilantro (personal preference).

I was hesitant at first but didn't have ripe tomatoes to make traditional salsa.  I've made this several times and haven't found anyone that doesn't like it.  I prefer to use jalapeno tortilla chips.

WONDERFUL IS ALL I CAN SAY! Such a great twist on a salsa. At a graduation party it was the hit of the table! Even with oops on my part with red pepper and no green onion....I think I prefer this to the tomatoe standard! THANKS!!!!!

Very easy to make. I used this recipe to serve over fish and found it to be pretty good. Don't think I would want to dip nacho chips in it, as it was a little on the sweeter side for me. I would make it again and serve it over seafood!!!

Served this at a 4th of July party and it was a BIG hit.  Did have to add a LOT more of the ingredients to the watermelon (garlic, onion, jalepenos) to get it to have enough 'kick' to fit our taste - but still a GREAT recipe.  Just alter it to fit your preferences

What a great use for watermelon! This recipe really delivers. It is a really unique salsa, and my family loved it. I omitted the green pepper (personal preference) and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, because that's what I had in the house. It was still great, and not bad for you, either!

I never made salsa before and my husband said this watermelon salsa was the best salsa he's ever tried. I put some hot sauce in it as someone has suggested. It was great! But what I found out here is that this recipe is barely enough for 4 people!! I don't know if it's just my family or what.

Anyway, thanks a lot, Dawn.

Encouraged by the reviews here, I set out to make this recipe to use up leftover watermelon.  Normally, I'm not a fan of watermelon, and buy it only for the kids.  Not now!  This salsa is a must have when watermelon season hits next summer.  Seedless watermelons are the way to go!

I have to admit, I was a skeptic but I was wrong! We just love this!  I had to laugh when I read: Number of Servings 32---- I don't think so, not in my family anyway.  I always double or triple the ingredients, otherwise it disappears to darn quick!!  Thanks for a great & fun recipe!

Our whole group loved this! Fire and Ice is the perfect name and it is indeed a lovely combination of sweet, cool and hot. We served with chips and then later with pulled pork. I found that letting the chopped watermelon sit in a colander for a while helped keep the salsa from getting too watery. Otherwise we made no changes. Looking forward to trying this on grilled fish too!

I didn't believe this at first, but it actually is good! At first, it is a burst of cold sweetness and the tang of salt, followed by a slow burn. It is a very interesting mix of flavors and different timings. No wonder this is so popular!

Absolutely FABU! Thank you so much for the recipe. Thank you reviewers for all your additional tips and tricks, I always read everything before prep. My only tweak was using fresh garlic vs. garlic salt, because we love garlic, Maldon salt and lime zest in addition with juice. Huge, HUGE HIT for family visit. I am already making a second batch for the next gathering the very next week. We also used garlic/chili tortilla chips as well as lime tortilla chips both awesome. Enjoy. Cheers.

I didn't use the bell pepper but the guests loved this. I didn't try it because I can't eat raw onions and I don't like cilantro. But it was a hit.

Love this even better the second time around. I mixed all ingredients in my 4 C measuring cup for easy clean up. I also let the mixture sit down in my colander to drain some of the juice. Perfect for a potluck!

Very disappointed. Neither my husband nor I liked it.  The first recipe I've tried from "all recipes" that had great reviews, but we didn't like and won't be eating.

absolutely delicious!  I served it with some grilled swordfish and then added the leftovers to my salad with grilled chicken and balsamic dressing the next day.  It tasted even better.  Will definitely make again, it was a huge hit.

I made it just like the recipe.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some extra watermelon that wasn't that sweet.  I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand except for the shallot.  I didn't want pineapple, mango or anything else.  The simplicity of the recipe was the main attraction.   OMG, this is so good!!!  I'm eating now and cannot stop!  I haven't shared with anyone yet, doesn't look like it will happen.  LOL
THANK YOU!!  THANK YOU!!!   This is so delicious!!

I have been asked to make this recipe COUNTLESS times. You definitely need to have a bowl with a strainer waiting for the watermelon as you cut it. This will help eliminate some of the ABUNDANT juice that the watermelon provides.  Save the jalapeno for the very last item on your cutting list.  WASH and clean up after the jalapeno (learned the hard way). Then mix, salt & pepper to taste.  I have even added 1/2 can of corn for color. So, so, good!!!! The salsa will taste incredible in a few hours or the next day!

Was good, had that taste of salsa with a twist of watermelon. If you never had tried it don't expect a tomato base flavor, it also help's if you like watermelon!!!

This was a hit at a potluck at church, but people almost didn't believe that the main ingredient was watermelon instead of tomato!! I usually share any leftovers but this time I took the very small amount home and ate it all myself.

This was good and received rave reviews! I used fresh garlic, a small whole jalapeño (which made it a little too spicy for me) and added some chopped fresh sweet cherries. Cucumber or mint might also be good in this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Teenagers seem to shy away from trying this recipe.  Although adults were willing to try it - teens were not as interested. Lovely presention by serving in the watermelon with the piqued edge, fresh flavour with the watermelon but I think the success spins on how much cilantro is in favour.  I enjoyed this recipe, but I won't make it again.

I made two batches, one with the jalapeno seeds in (hot) and one without jalapeno seeds (mild).  

Took the advice of others and left the watermelon in a strainer for a couple of hours.  Salsa was still juicy but without the excess of liquids.

OUTSTANDING! I have been asked to bring this to every summer party we are invited to. I agree with the other reviewers to let the watermelon sit in a colander while cutting the other ingredients- this allows the salsa to not get overly wet while it sits out later on. People will love this salsa so much that the regular tomato one will sit off to the side and will be a "massive let down" when they are forced to have it if the watermelon version is gone. Enjoy!

I made this for my co-workers today and they loved it! Like the other reviews suggested, I drained the watermelon (twice) and mixed all the other ingredients to marinate overnight before combining with the melon the next day. Also increased the jalapeño to 1 whole one, used real garlic instead of garlic salt and substituted white onion. Soooo good! In fact, I'm getting ready to whip up another batch with the leftover ingredients! Also, I carved out the watermelon and served the salsa in it. It was a much appreciated touch!

I'm a big fan of salsas, and never thought of trying to make one with watermelon.  Wow, this salsa was amazing!  Not only was it delicious, the colors were great.  If you want a salsa that shows well and tastes great, this one is for you!

A sensational recipe!  I increased it to a bunch of green onions thinly sliced, added four minced radishes, and added a little Cholula hot sauce,(that's an option you may not like)  plus refrigerating it for a while before serving.  Forget the salsa! It is a great summer salad!

Overall pretty good.  This was a good use of the watermelon, needing the rind to make Watermelon Rind Pickles my 90 year old mother has been craving...this was a good way to do so.  Will make again for the ladies at a retirement home but will seed the jalapeno for them.  Otherwise very good just as written!

I added a little sea salt to it for some extra flavor.  I would recommend not using all of the watermelon juice or figuring out a way to fix the ratio of watermelon to all the other ingredients.  GREAT recipe though!

This recipe just won a contest I entered it into at a local Cinco De Mayo salsa contest today.  I did add a bit more peppers than it called for and everyone really loved it! Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved loved it!  I added grated cheese and parsley to the breadcrumbs.  Also added some chicken broth and thickened the sauce as others mentioned.  Will definately make this again.

It was really good but to add a little more crunch and pizzazz, I added some chopped onion and balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

Everyone loved it. They did not know it was watermelon until I told them. I drained the watermelon as suggested, and it was a good idea. I also used regular parsley instead of cilantro as I had plenty of it in my garden.

Delicious! Best salsa ever tasted. I would let the chopped watermelon sit and drain for a bit before mixing to reduce the liquid at the bottom. Everyone loved this recipe.

I logged in just to rate this recipe!  I have made it three times this summer and today will be the fourth...all requests after its debut.  My husband loves it -- although we've been adding a little more spice to it (more jal. pep and seasoning).  Also took the advice with draining and adding a bit more lime juice.

Too much work (a lot of chopping) for mediocre results.  Watermelon had to be strained so that it was salsa and not soup.  Not much flavor.  Lime chips are a necessity to add some needed flavor.

I took some of the suggestions and added more lime juice and peppers and served with the lime chips and this sauce was GREAT!  I liked it most when it was first served and still pretty cold!  Guests were delightfully surprised with the uniquiness of the watermelon over the usual tomato.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  i took it to a barbeque and all 40 people raved about it!  they couldn't believe how good it was!
I did double the recipe and use seedless watermelon and let it sit overnight in the fridge (although, it was good right after i made it)!  

I have to send the recipe out in email b/c everyone wants it!

Thanks Dawn!

This is so good. I did take others advice on draining the melon and adding more lime. I also added several more peppers and used my own dried habenero pepper flake "blend" to really punch it up. The hint of lime chips were a great call.

Like others, I found that this good recipe becomes great when you seed and drain the watermelon, double the lime juice, and let it sit overnight. Use a firm melon that is in season to get the most impact.
