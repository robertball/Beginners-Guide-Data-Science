Came out excellent made as written. I want to make again today but I'm out of cornflakes, so I think I'll try panko just for fun.  I liked the lemon flavor a lot and wonder how it would taste with Italian spices. Very easy adaptable recipe. I particularly liked the recipe chilled the next day as slices on a salad with ranch dressing.  Very tasty.

Delicious.  Scaled down to 2 chix breasts and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of cornflakes and thyme.  Marinated about an hour, cooked in about 1/2 hour.  Served with roasted potatoes that I cooked on the same pan as the chix and steamed broccoli. Very moist, very easy, definately a keeper.

This is my husband's favourite dinner-so easy and delicious! I took some of the suggestions and marinade the breasts in limeade. I always use cornflakes and toss in a few extra spices instead of the thyme-chili and garlic powder. Will keep making this again and again, thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  The lemonade was not overpowering, just added a little flavor.  I also used panko crumbs and my whole family really enjoyed this chicken.

I thought it was really good!  Had a sweet lemony flavor.  I think it's best to pound the chicken thin so that it cooks more evenly.  If any parts get burned it can leave a really funny taste

This is good, quick, tasty cooking.  I used the basic idea of the recipe with the following modifications:  1 (12 oz) can of Minute Maid Concentrated Lemonade, Seasoned to taste prior to placing in concentrate.  I used Seasoned bread crumbs in lieu of corn flakes.  The family loved the sweet, zeasty taste.  I will definitely be making these again.

This was ok.  The lemon taste was too strong so perhaps next time i'll water it down a bit.  It was incredibly easy to make.

I really did not like the way the lemonade makes the chicken taste and it gives it a chewy texture. I will not try this again

This was good!  I used a Pumpkin Flax cereal, which resulted in a very flavorful crust on the chicken.  Otherwise I followed the recipe!  The lemon flavor in the background is great!

I made this for my husband and best friend last night...we did not care for it. We had to drench it in ranch dressing.

I haven't made this yet, but I have had it served to me before. It is very tasty as is but is also fun to play around with the recipe a little too to add your own personal touch to it. It's a great easy recipe that have tasty results. I'm sure to making it real soon!

The cornflakes deliver a nice, crispy finish but the lemon flavor from the concentrated juice was too tart and the thyme did nothing to enhance the flavor.  With all of the amazing chicken recipes out there, this one just doesn't cut it for me.

I found this to be totally inedible. I couldn't eat mine. My boyfriend managed to eat his, but we didn't save any leftovers. The combination of the sweet lemonade with the cornflakes was not good to say the least. I would not recommend trying this.

I'm gonna make this for dinner tomorrow night...with a few small changes.  I'll use fresh thyme...add fresh sage...and probably fresh garlic.  Instead of cornflakes I'll use crushed tostitos...hint of lime flavor.  I'll serve it up with wild rice done in chicken broth and some sauteed fresh asparagus.   Oh my gosh!   I can't wait...this is gonna be delicious!!!

I thought this was very good.  I used whole wheat crackers instead of corn flakes & it worked great.  I think it will be great cold on salad tomorrow.

I just made this recipe tonight and made exactly as written only cut it in half. I thought it was tasty but we like spicey so may add a little sriracha with the lemonade marinade and maybe add some garlic and cayenne with the corn flakes. All in all a good dish.

This was a little too sweet but we liked it. Marinated  it for about 2 hours. Don't know if  I'd want to do it any longer. I'm going to make this again and maybe tweak  the recipe a bit.

Didn't particularly care for this.  Marinade was just too sweet.
