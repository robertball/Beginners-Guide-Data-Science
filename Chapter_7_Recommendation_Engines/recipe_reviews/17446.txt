Easy and wonderful if you don't make the mistake I did.  RUB means use very little and really rub it in hard.  Not smash each side of the meat down into a bowl of the stuff!  LOL  a learning experience for me.  It was wonderful when used correctly.

A teriffic spice rub indeed. I have used this on lean pork chops as well as chicken with excellent results.

This is how I use it (adopted from Cook's Illustrated recipe for chops or skinless chicken breasts):

Take 4 pieces of meat (chop or breast) and brine in a solution of 1 quart water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup suger for 1 hour. Drain and pat the meat dry. In a 1 gal zip-loc bag, put 2 tablespoons of the dry rub and 2 tablespoons of olive oil (too much olive oil will dilute the spice). Mush the bag around to mix the spices and olive oil. Add the meat to the bag, seal, and toss for a minute to coat. 

Once coated, place the meat directly onto the grill and grill according to usual meat cooking instructions (5 minutes each side on high heat for the chicken, 3 minutes each side on high heat, followed by 5 minutes on meium-low heat for the chops).

We've also used this rub on chicken that we then grill, cut into slices, and use for chicken burritos. The flavors in this spice rub are excellent for mexican dishes. I make a low-carb version of a burrito using large lettuce pieces as my tortilla with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, a few slices of the spiced chicken, and a small bit of salsa  for a truly wonderful dish.

Great recipe with just the right amount of spice. For ribs, I would coat first with yellow mustard and then put the rub on. This helps it stick better and makes a nice crispy crust. During cooking, place some of the rub with the contents of 1 beer.Baste frequently while cooking for extra flavour. Mmmmmmm-Good!

This rub is outstanding!!  I tried it on a whim one night when my roomate and I were grilling some steaks and I am SOOO glad that I did!!  I scaled the recipe to 9, and it STILL made a ton.  We used it on New York strip.  I rubbed 1-2 tablespoons of the rub into each steak, then lightly coated them with about 1 tablespoon (each) of olive oil (the oil seems to make the steak ALOT jucier...which is my favorite part of a steak!) and let them sit in the fridge for about half an hour.  We made them alongside Pan-Fried Asparagus (also on this site) and some Lipton noodles and it was one of the best dinners I have ever made!!  I did cut down on the amount of Paprika (because I ran out) and Cayenne (used less than half of what was called for) and it was just perfect.  Had a little kick to it, but not what I'd call spicy.  This is SOOO good, you must try it!!   :)

We used this rub with Tri-Tip...it was amazing it gave it a wonderful taste. We used olive oil to make the rub stick and it also helps keep the meat from drying out. We will be using this rub again soon.

Good, but not great.  I halved the recipe to try out of a few different pieces of meat.  I only used 1 tablespoon of black pepper and 1 tablespoon of cayenne (kids).  I used about 3 tablespoon on a pork butt cooked on low in the crock pot for 9 hours and it really added nice flavor.  I also tried this on chicken tenders on the grill, not happy with the flavor on these.

This was awesome.  I used this on grilled chicken for  some friends who helped with a roofing project.  Even the guys pasted up the steak for the chicken, everyone is still raving about it.  Going to try it tonight on chicken with a sweet BBQ sauce over top....

I really liked this rub, but my husband thought it was over powering.  Because we have a toddler (and I found out too late I didn't have any) I left the cayenne out.  I won't make it again, because my husband hated it, but I would recommend you try it because I did like it.  I found the flavor a little smokey and used it on steaks that I grilled.

Awesome...I've used this on steak, chicken and pork so far.  My boyfriend is on Atkins so we've been looking for ways to spice up some meat and this is a great combination.

Reduced the paprika as suggested.  Still paprika & garlic are the dominant flavors.  It does make a lot of rub so I made a fourth of it with these measurements:  1T paprika, 1 1/8t cayenne, 1 1/2t black pepper, 2t garlic 1t onion powder, 1T salt, 1/2t sugar, 1/4t thyme.  Good, but not all that special.  I used mine on boneless chicken breasts.  Rubbed the spices on then coated with flour & cooked in a pan.  Fast dinner.

The dry rub itself is a good combo of flavors, BUT, I think it's important to use a good cut of meat to bring OUT those flavors!!  I used pork sirloin chops and they didn't come out as I had hoped.  I reduced the amount of cayenne drastically, otherwise, it would have been too hot for my 16 month old. I let the meat marinate all day but it was not exploding with flavor.  I guess pork has a tendency to be a little on the dry side if not cooked properly.  Maybe that's what happened in this case.  May try again in the future.

Added a little brown sugar to give it a hint of sweetness.  Put it on a tri-tip and sit for a day.  By far the best tri tip i've ever had.  This is now a regular rub in my kitchen.

Excellent recipe! I used 4 Tbsp sea salt instead of 6 Tbsp because I was cooking for someone on a low sodium diet. I used this rub on 2 whole chickens and let them marinate overnight in the refrigerator. I roasted the next day and the chicken was so flavorful and not too salty. I did not use cayenne because I didn't know if the person could handle the heat. I used chili powder instead. I also sprinkled this rub on salmon last night and it was so delicious. I will likely add cayenne to my remaining mixture, but the 4 Tbsp of sea salt is perfect. This one is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

This was really good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the Cayenne in half - but next time I'll use the full amount, I like some spice.  I used it on ribs that I left in the fridge overnight with the rub, then put them in the slow-cooker the next morning with some sauce.  Eight hours later, you could pull the bones clean out of the meat!  I also added a bit of the rub to the baked beans I made to go with the ribs.  It gave them a nice flavor that complimented the meat.

I have to 5 star this! Everyone loves this rub. I make a big container of it and use it on pork and chicken. I didn't exactly follow the amount of each ingredient and I left out cayenne pepper...only because I didn't have any. This stuff is Great!

Great Recipe.  Have used it with chicken and beef.  Very spicy hot, but we enjoyed it.  One batch goes along way.  Stores well as mentioned.  I will make more when I'm finished what I have

Simply perfect mix of flavor.  I did 15# turkey before deep frying and it cooked right into the skin.  I think this worked out better than the liquid injections into the bird.

This is my favorite hand made rub.  I especially love it on pork, but I have grilled chicken with it and also use it a lot on grilled steaks.  I tweak it a bit, but it is my standard rub that I almost always have on hand.  I am supposed to limit my salt intake, so I make it without the salt and I also cut back on the Cayenne because I don't tolerate much heat.  Other than that, I leave it as it is.  It is a great thing to mix up and put in mason jars for gifts, too.  Oh, and to make the best ribs, cook them in foil in the oven with this rub on.  Low and slow.  When getting done, but not falling apart, pull them out of the oven and throw them on the grill and baste with your favorite bbq sauce (we like Sweet Baby Ray's original flavor).  Cook the ribs on the grill just long enough to get some caramelization from the sauce and you are done.  I promise they will be AMAZING!

I covered a brisket and 2 slabs of pork ribs with this magnificent rub and wrapped them tight in foil to sit overnight in the fridge.I cooked the brisket for 7 hours in the oven at 225f and the ribs at the same for about 3 hours both still in the foil.Fired up the grill with mesquite and smoked both over low heat for another 3 hours and this was by far the best tasting and most moist brisket that I had ever cooked or had the pleasure of eating.The ribs were awesome too.It was a completely different taste on each kind of meat.Hugh, you get an A+ on this one.

My 80-somehting father didn't care for it because is's spicy, but everyone else did, even my 7 and 9 year old loved it and request it again.

This was good but next time I'm cutting back on the  black pepper n canine pepper. Way too spicy hot. 
I put the rub on a nice rack of ribs let it sit for 24 hrs then cooked it up, && let me tell you should change the name to "KICKASS DRY RUB"

I cut the salt in half as well as the cayenne pepper and black pepper just to cut back on the heat.  This goes well with chicken and pork, wonderful!

Did not have any cayenne nor any dry onion powder.  I did add some dry onion flakes and kept everything else the same.  Great recipe and will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent rub that made great tasting grilled chicken. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of salt. Thank you Hugh!

I hate to give any recipe a bad review, but we just didn't care for this.  We both felt it was way too salty and salt was the first flavor I tasted.  I didn't think it was too spicy, and thought the spice level was ok.  I did scale this down for 8 servings, so it is possible the measurements may have been slightly off, but I did follow the recipe as written.  We both felt this tasted southwestern, which wasn't really what we were looking for.  I may try this again in the future, but I would reduce the amount of salt by at least half, and perhaps add a very small amount of sugar or brown sugar.

Excellent with pork, chicken and steak, but too strong for fish. I love how easy it is to put together, and the portion here makes enough for two or three different dishes for my husband and me. This is a winner!

I liked this rub however I used it as a base.  I added 1 tbls of brown sugar and a tsp of dry mustard.  A little too much pepper for my taste I think I'll cut that back the next time I use this.  I also added a little cajun spice.  Used it on baby back ribs with a sauce to baste...turned out pretty good.  My picky nine year old even liked it and that's impressive.

Looks good, but I would drizzle honey over the rub and let that marinate for a while before smoking or grilling. I used a similar recipe on baby back or St. Louis Ribs when I worked for a restaurant in Tennessee.

This is a great recipe!
The only things I changed were lowering the amount of cayenne because my boyfriend can't handle spicy stuff, and I didn't feel comfortable using that much salt so I reduced that too.
Other than those 2 modifications I followed it exactly, it is wonderful!

Best steak seasoning I've uses so far. Although I would recommend to cut down on salt if you're not too keen on anything overly salted. I also mixed mine with olive oil so its easier to rub on.

We. Love. This. Rub!  I did have to tweak it a little...we don't care for spicy-hot food.  I only added 1 tbls of cayenne and 2 tbls of black pepper.  I also added 1/4 Cup of brown sugar (this replaces the missing cayenne/pepper).  It adds just a bit of sweetness, but for us, it's PERFECT!  Thanks Hugh, who ever you are!  :-)

This was Ok, but I thought it had way too much oregano. I think if you sub'ed the oregano for brown sugar it would be a lot better. Great base recipe though.

I made this for my family on vacation and they loved it!. I placed 4 washed and paper towel patted dry chicken breasts in a gallon zip lock bag. I then mixed 4 tsps of the mix in a bowl with some EVOO. I dumped the wet mix into the zip lock bag and let it marinate for a few hours. The key was the grilling. I preheated my Weber natural gas grill to max heat. I seared each side of the breasts for 2 minutes. I then turned off the middle burner and turned the outside burners to medium. This indirectly cooked the chicken for another 15 minutes or so. The chicken was so tender and moist, my family couldn't believe it. The recipe is a bit spicy. Cut back on the Cayenne of you want a little less kick.

This was awesome on our steaks.  Especially on the ones were seasoned and then frozen for a later date.  By the time those steaks thawed and were cooked they were mouth watering.  This dry rub recipe is a keeper!

I cut the recipe in half, but could've cut into 1/4 because it makes a lot of seasoning. I even reduced the paprika further since it's mainly for color, and cut the cayenne since we have kids. This was still too spicy for the kids, but tastes great. I'm looking forward to using this as a base for adding more seasonings for different types of rubs.

Tried this on ribs and it gave them a lovely color and flavor. I can't wait to try it on something else. Thanks for an easy, sugar-free rub. ** We used this on a whole turkey that we roasted this weekend. OMG was it good! Can't wait to show it off on Thanksgiving.

This rub was so overwhelming that my family could not enjoy the flavor of the meat.  I even reduced the amounts of both peppers and added some brown sugar.  We, normally, enjoy spicy food, but this was way too much.

Used this recipe to season chicken chunks for making kabobs.  I knew we were having some spicy sauces for dipping so cut the "spicy" spices in half (paprika, cayenne and pepper) and also couldn't see the need for that much salt in something that had so many bold flavors so left salt out altogether.  Followed the directions for brining the chicken suggested by a reviewer and marinated with the rub and olive oil overnight.  Also added a cap full of liquid smoke to the marinade which gave it a nice but subtle smokey flavor.  The family loved it and it was a fun new twist on chicken skewers.

This rub is fabulous! I put it on everything from chicken to ribs and keep extra on hand in my cupboard! As others have mentioned, I cut both peppers down to half the amount mentioned and it is still spicy enough (and I LOVE spicy food). Try adding brown sugar or even a bit of cinnamon for a hint of sweetness and variety. Overall, this is a wonderful base to start any BBQ rub!

We used this on tri-tip, and it was excellent. For our own personal tastes, we might reduce the cayenne a bit next time. I rubbed it on the meat and let it sit in the fridge for an hour or two, then grilled. The meat was really juicy and flavorful. Will make again.

We have used this rub for years.  It's our go to.  We also use it on our boston butts when smoking them.  I don't find it spicy as others have mentioned.  I'm sure it's also in the way you cook with it.  Using it on a butt and then smoking, after cooked you taste more of the smoked flavor in the bark then the spiciness.

Ignore those that say it's too strong or overpowering or that you have to apply sparingly. I purposefully went light because of those comments and the first few cuts were very underflavored. Should have known better, it's not exactly my first time, but some of the reviews spooked me. Apply like any other rub, maybe even a little heavier if you like robust taste. People must be measuring their ingredients wrong or something—I used regular table salt, regular cayenne and black pepper, and a measuring tablespoon.

Very  reasonable and flavorful overall. Has a "back to basics" quality about it. Use it for "patio grill" occasions, not for "fancy grilling for company," as it has the campfire flavor—hint of onion, garlic, salt, and wood, little touch of heat, not much else. Nothing special, but solid and satisfying.

I wonder if the spicy complaints are a regional thing—I eat a lot of spicy food and really wouldn't even think of a rub like this as "spicy." If cayenne or a dash of Tabasco are "super spicy" rather than just flavors in your neck of the woods, maybe dial them back in the ingredients.

We prepared this mixture and gave it as an item in a gift basket. The recipients can't get enough of this rub, and they use it on all meats and for all styles of cooking their meat. We used pre ground black pepper, and smoked paprika in the version we made.

Made this tonight as the directions stated.  I put it on two Costco whole chickens, and smoked/grilled them on my kamado grill.  I ended up letting the heat get too high, and kind of burned the outside, but they were still amazing.  I'm a huge griller (I have 7 grills, if that gives you any indication), and have tried many rubs.  If you like a little heat, this one is a real winner.  I'm thrilled with it!  Thanks, Hugh-ever you are.

I have tried this on hamburgers and I didn't like it. It had a funny flavor which was the oregano. My own blend was much better but I am always looking for that killer combo blend, so I wanted to give this one a try. It seems a lot of people like this rub but I didn't care for it. It's back to the kitchen lab for me.

Really good.  My favorite. The oregano and thyme add an interesting flavor.  I make this without the salt because I often brine soak the meat first and I can use as much as I want without over salting.  I can always sprinkle a bit of salt on anything that needs it.  I keep a shaker of this on the shelf so it's always handy.

I am totally sold on this rub.  The only 'tweak' I make is the addition of brown sugar, everything else is kept to the original recipe.  I have only used it on chicken and pork...so far.  Many thanks Hugh for an excellent recipe.

I thought the rub was very good. I cut it in half and have plenty left over for the next time. Great bold flavor. I used it generously and let it sit on the chicken for about an hour, I am sure the longer the better as far as thats concerned. The next time i am going to lower the amount of cayenne by  half. I want the other flavors to come through and it seemed like the cayenne was dominanting my mouth. Salt content was fine with me.

I tried this rub on some chicken.  I added a bit more cayenne for some heat as well as 3 tbsp chili powder and 3 tbsp sage.  I then grilled the chicken and it had great flavor, but it was very, very salty.  I ended up having to make my guests wait an extra 10 minutes while i prepared a salad with avocado, pine nuts, and my personal vinaigrette to toss with the chicken to kill the salty flavor.  My recommendation would be to use 3 tbsp or 4 tbsp of salt instead of the recommended 6.

I use this on a chicken halved and cooked on the grill. Delicious. Keeps the meat moist too. Also use on chops that I fry in a small amount of oil. One of our favorites.

I made this rub for pork chops, and actually used it for grilled chicken as well. I found that it coats best when mixed with olive oil (about 1:1). My boyfriend really like the flavor!

We used this on grilled chicken legs/thighs.  My husband gives it 5 stars.  I thought it was bland and needed a lot of Bulls-eye on top to enjoy it.  I guess it depends on your taste.

A great all purpose rub. I've used it on pork, chicken, and steak. I usually make the big batch so that I have it on hand whenever I need it.

I use this rub all the time. It has a great flavor. Do not use in great amounts unless you like it spicy. Works great on ribs.

Excellent recipe.  I deviated a bit from Hugh's recipe and got fantastic results.  I used smoked paprika, a pepper blend, less garlic powder and kosher salt instead of table salt.  I've used it several times and I'm getting "best ever" feed back from my tasters.  Thanks Hugh.

Loved it, we don't eat salt so I skipped that & for the pepper I used a Worcestershire Pepper blend. It will be used in many recipes here, thanks!

I made this a while ago for pork chops, and we thought it was good...then my husband used it on the turkey he grilled yesterday for Thanksgiving, and it was awesome! He rubbed it all over the turkey and sprinkled it inside the cavity. The turkey meat was outstanding, and it seems to be even tastier today.

I used this recipe again for the second time with the same changes ( 3/4 T cayenne 1/4 c brown sugar, an 1T thyme ) an it was fantastic. i cut up a fryer chicken an rubed this all over the pieces an under the skin then put little slabs of butter under an on top of the skin an broiled it. It was FANTASTIC!! Also about half way through i melted a little more butter an mixed in a little seasoning ( thanks to a friends suggestion ) an brushed it ove the chicken pieces. Yummy! Would suggest that the cayenne be decreased even more though if you have little ones. I had to make sure to give my 16 month old pieces that had no seasoning directly on them, cause it still had a kick to it. Thanks for the great recipe this will be used more!

Very good rub. I have used it many times. You can increase the cayanne pepper to kick the heat up a bit. Easy rub recipe to adjust to your personal taste too.

I like this Rub but I can't give it 5 stars because I thought it was too salty and too Hot.  I like spicy and just based on the reviews by others I left out 2 Tbs. of black pepper.  Maybe I should have left out one of the Cayenne as well.  It was good and with more changes I would probably make it again.

While this was a good rub I thought that the black pepper was overwhelming for chicken. I will use it for beef and cut the black pepper down for chicken in the future.

This is an excellent base rub.  We had this on tri-tip and the results were great.  We also used this rub to spice up some steak sandwiches that we had the next day.  In a bowl we combined the rub with several tablespoons of water and mixed in thinly sliced Tri-tip, heated and served on a roll with mushrooms, onions and cheese.

The longer this one sits to let all the spices "meld", the better it is. I wouldn't just fix and use it. It needs time to sit. I'd recommend a day before using it. But it is pretty good. I have used it on burgers, ribs and steaks. Very nice. Thanks.

Absolutely wonderful! I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand so I used chili powder and some red pepper flakes, nice and spicy.
I also use this one sliced potatoes. Slice up the potatoes, put them in a casserole dish with a 1/2 a stick of butter and 5-6 tb spoons of this rub and it's unbelieveable.

Added brown sugar, enjoyed it on pork chops. I seared them in a cast iron pan then placed them on the grill! Trying chicken next.

This was really excellent: exactly the flavor I was hoping for. I reduced the quantity to make enough for six servings, and it was more than enough for that. I followed the recipe exactly, except for two things: I reduced the cayenne slightly, and I used smoked paprika instead of regular. I highly recommend the smoked paprika. This will now be my go-to rub for chicken; I'll make it in the original quantity to have on hand.

I have not used it yet, but it looks and smells good, and as a diabetic, thrilled for a no sugar rub! I did not enjoy grinding the pepper. Perhaps, the grinder I bought was not great. I grinder the salt as well. That was a much easier process, either due to salt being solid all the way through, the grinder which came with the salt was better, or a combination of the both. Once again, I cannot wait to use it.

Marinated chicken legs in 2/3 Moore ‘s and 1/3 worcestershire sauce. Sprinkled a generous amount of this rub on the chicken as I placed them on the grill over indirect heat. WOW!!!  I have also used this rub on smoked turkey and received rave reviews. This is my go to rub when cooking birds.

We use this rub on our tri-tip nearly every time we make it... fantastic!  I use less cayenne since the kids are eating it too, but the flavor is still amazing.  Stores very well in the pantry in a sealed container.  This recipe makes enough rub to use several times.

This probably would've been too spicy if I had followed the directions as is. So, I made a few modifications. First off I converted everything from Tablespoons to teaspoons to make a smaller batch. I calculated the 1/2 cup of paprika to be around 6T and used 6t instead. As someone else suggested, I substituted lemon pepper for the black pepper and reduced the cayenne pepper (2t.) and salt (4t.). I could've reduced the salt by another tsp since the lemon pepper seasoning contained salt as well. Tasty! Will try again

Nice rub for a bit of a hotter taste for cheaper cuts of meat. Almost resembles a less hot cajun rub.

Very good.  Cut the cayenne pepper in half, but kept everything else in the same general proportions.  Took another reviewers advice and mixed around 2.5 tablespoons of rub with 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a ziplock, and then dropped in the chicken breast and gave a nice coating.

Grilled @ ~450 degrees for around 13 minutes (really thick chicken breast).  Came out super flavor-full, with the right amount of heat.

I used this rub for a roasted chicken and it was mediocre. Instead, I repurposed it as a roasted potato wedges recipe -- and holy moly, FANTASTIC! I added a bit more salt after roasting but they turned out so zesty and flavourful. I cut peeled yellow potatoes into wedges, tossed with vegetable oil and rub, then roasted at 450 for 45 minutes in a cast iron pan and flipped every so often. Finished with Maldon flakes!

Tweak: Coarse Black Pepper and Kosher Salt flakes replaced salt and pepper 1 for 1, and Onion Flakes instead of powder x 2. Everything else remained the same. Great on grilled steak.

I can't really rate it since I haven't made it yet but I wanted to point out that 1/4 cup is 4 tablespoons, so you could read the paprika amount as 8 tablespoons.  Then for each ingredient you could replace the word tablespoon with teaspoon and make a third as much (there are 3 teaspoons to a tablespoon).

This recipe is excellent without any modifications.  I regularly use it on pork butts and rib racks before smoking them on my smoker.  Much better than the store bought rubs and much cheaper to make.  Will be trying it on a rotisserie  rib eye roast soon.

Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Didn't have enough garlic powder, so I used 3 tabls garlic powder and 2 tbls garlic salt. Then compromised the salt only using 4 tbls. Previous reviewer stated never ever use salt in a rub. I disagree. Salt enhances flavor, time in dry rub is crucial. Rubbed vigorously, using remainder (all) of the mix to coat thoroughly. Let the meat, 3 racks of baby back ribs ~ 5.5 lbs, rest in the refrigerator overnight. Cooked at 250 with apple wood for 2 hours. Wrapped each rack individually with foil, continued cooking for 2 additional hours at 250. Results were excellent.

I tried this one pork chops for the grill and everyone loved it. It tasted just like those delicious pork-chop-on-a-stick at the Minnesota State Fair. Yum. The volume of rub was way too much for me, so I made 1/6th of a recipe. Perfect for a family of four.

This is a tasty, easy recipe that we used on chicken thighs instead of buffalo sauce. It was a huge success and will be used again!

It was ok. Found it was missing something so I added cumin, celery seed, and chili powder. Used a lemon flavoured salt and pepper mixture as sub for the 6 tablespoons of salt this calls for. Also the recipe didn't state the type of paprika so I used sweet paprika and you want to talk about a memorable taste!

I love this dry rub, you can also make a marinade with this by using 1/4 of a cup of dry rub and 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 of vegetable oil. Put everything in a large plastic zip bag and add about 1 to 2 lbs of meat or fish. No need to marinade overnight, I marinade about 30 minutes before I put it on the grill.  This is very spicy so use 1/8 of a cup of dry rub if you want lots of flavor a just a hint of heat.

Really great! Tried it on some pork chops and my wife and I both loved it.

A word to those who don't like too much kick, cut the cayenne in half; you'll still get the flavour without the heat.

I made this rub and used it with some NY steaks. It was very good. The only thing I would modify is the amount of cayenne. I would half the cayenne so that I could taste the meat better.

I used this for some steaks my husband wanted to grill. I used chili powder in place of the cayenne (I didn't have any) and I added some brown sugar. I thought this was good, not great. It didn't have a "wow" factor to it, but it was really good in a fajita soup I made the next day with the left over steak and a few tablespoons of this rub I threw in. Ill play around w/ the amount of some of the spices so it suits our tastes a little bit better. Thanks

This rub was a great complement to the barbecue chicken I made last night! I did cut back a bit on the cayenne (about 1/3 of the recipe's suggestion) as I didn't want it too overpowering.

Y-U-M!  The first time I used it I just quickly put it on some pork chops to grill.  They were the best pork chops I have ever had.  I use this on more than just meat like veggies and I even put it on macaroni n cheese- best macaroni I have ever had.  I had to put my input on this one!

I halved this recipe because I didn't have quite enough of some of the ingredients to make the entire thing.  Makes a lot even at half.  We used some of this as a dry rub on chicken leg quarters that we baked first then bbq'ed with sauce for 10 minutes after baking.  Produces a very juicy, tender bbq'ed chicken.  We are using Hugh's Dry Rub on a rotisserie chicken tonight - we are making the neigbors jealous as we speak...Great dry rub for probably any kind of meat - probably even fish!  In fact, sprinkle it lightly on some hot french fries or on top of some mashed potatoes or potato or macaroni salad in place of just paprika.  This rub is good in everything!

I'm a big fan of this rub - I've used it on broiled steaks 3 times and every time it's turned out wonderful - just spicy enough so that when you take a bite its perfectly seasoned. It's also a good "basic" rub from which you can branch out and experiment with different ingredients; I've added both brown sugar and dried, chopped chipotle chilis to the rub and both worked very well.

Love the taste !! Used it on a smoked turkey breast and everything turned out moist. I too cut back the salt and and added more garlic powder. Hope to use it on more meats and seafood. Thanks for sharing!~!

Delicious!  Reduced salt by 2 tablespoons and replaced cayenne pepper with red pepper flakes because that is what I had on hand.  Rubbed on chicken and grilled on the George Foreman grill for 10 minutes.

If I was standing next to Hugh I'd give him a great big hug! This rub is fantasic! The only change I made is instead of table salt I used Kosher coarse salt. It was not salty at all. I grilled some country ribs and it was delicious. Some I add BBQ sauce and some I left memphis style. This will be my rub of choice! Thanks Hugh for sharing your recipe rub. :)

We weren't all thrilled with this as the spices seemed a bit bland together and didn't do much to enhance the flavor of the meat.  Gave it a few tries on different cuts of meat.  Sadly I made too much of it so I'm using it in other capacities combined with other recipes.  Not a completely horrible rub, otherwise I would have thrown it out, but just bland compared to others we've used.  Using it with other recipes we already have for a bit more of a kick.  I haven't noticed much of a difference in using this rub.

wow, this recipe makes a LOT!! My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. We added about 3 tbsp of brown sugar as well. Like the other recipes said, this is a RUB, and a little goes a long way. It was very good and we will definetly use it again (especially since we have so much left over)  :)

Awesome!!  A perfect blend of flavours with a bit of a spicy kick but not overwhelming.  Great with ribs rubbed with this spice blend, refrigeragted overnight and slow cooked, covered and standing on end (so juice runs off) in a 200 degree oven for 5-6 hours and then finished off on the Bar-B-Que grill with your favourite bar-b-que sauce. Perfect with Danish baby back ribs!!

Awesome on baby back ribs! Can't wait to try on other meats. I baked the meat instead of grilling and it still turned out great.
Thanks Hugh!

I tryed it on shrimp kabobs.  They were delicous, but a little spicy for me.  I will definetly make this again, but with a little less cayenne pepper.

Great rub, with excellent taste.  I am not a big fan of salt, so I cut the salt in half.  Next batch I will reduce a little more.  Next batch will include a little bronw sugar as mentioned by others.

This was a great recipe for my Thanksgiving tukey. I butter injected a turkey and then but this rub under the skin. It came out wonderful. My husband hates Cajun foods but actually thought that this was really good. No deep fryer so we had to roast our turkey but it came out great!! Thanks

This is very flavorful. I cut down on the salt, and it was still good. I brushed a little olive oil on the steaks, then sprinkled with some lime juice, then added the spice rub and some chopped parsley. Marinated then put under the broiler. Delish!

I sprinkled about 1T on each boneless skinless chicken breast (they were pretty big), and let them sit in the fridge for a little over an hour before grilling.  VERY spicy.  Next time I'll cut down on the cayenne or black pepper.  I think this is best for larger pieces of meat (not flattened chicken breasts).

tried it on some sirloin steak and chicken breast.  i guess i didn't put enough on as it didn't taste like much (a coating on both sides, plus added some oil onto it as well and refrigerated overnight), though the bites that had more of the rub on it was good, but it tastes like it needs some salt or something. i also didn't add as much cayenne powder to it at all as it would have been a little too much for my taste.

We used this rub on deep fried turkey at Easter, and it was fabulous.  We got all kinds of raves from family members.  We couldn't stop picking at it while my husband was carving it.  :)  We reduced the cayenne pepper b/c of the kids, but everyone still really loved this!

This is an excellent blend of spices. It works fantastically as a dry rub prior to grilling but is also an excellent blackening seasoning, as the flavors change and blend to become very succulent as they burn into the food, be it chicken, fish or beef.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I have only tried it on chicken with nothing less than rave reviews!  The rub left the chicken so moist and flavorful! I did not have any garlic, onion, thyme or oregano the first time, so I substituted those four ingrdients with some Lipton Recipe Secrets savory herb and garlic, and found it equally wonderful!  Thanks for making my barbecuing experience so great Hugh!
