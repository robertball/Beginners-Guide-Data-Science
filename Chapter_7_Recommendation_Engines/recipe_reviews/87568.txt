I used EVOO instead of canola oil only because that was all I had on hand. I did not have Old Bay on hand but I did have homemade cajun seasoning that I used in equal amounts. We LOVED these green beans. They were anything but average for us.

This was quite good!  I made some changes.  I heated about 1/2Tbsp of olive oil, sauteed some diced onion and garlic for a few seconds, added 1/2Tbsp butter, Then I added the vegetables (I'd half cooked them in the steamer). I added some julienned carrots and yellow peppers to the green beans for extra vitamins and color.  I made them for Father's Day and my family loved them.  Even my notoriously picky sister asked for the recipe.  I almost fell over in shock.

I never thought of using Old Bay on green beans. I loved it! I omitted the nuts and added bacon bits and it was great! I made this with the Spinach Stuffed Chicken and it was a great meal!

These beans were FANTASTIC! I couldn't find any old bay blackening seasoning (I had never even heard of it), so I found a recipe to make my own blackening seasoning. They turned out perfect, even my boyfriend gives them a 5/5.

Well, I'm getting old. Thought I had pecans, but didn't. Used almonds instead. Forgot the recipe called for BLACKENED Old Bay- didn't have any, so used regular Old Bay. Turned out great anyway!

I've got to agree with one other reviewer - these are not really that tasty.  I was looking for a memorable side dish with green beans - and, this is just not it.  Couldn't really taste the Old Bay seasoning on the beans, either.  Tried adding grated parmesan cheese, and that helped a wee bit.

These were agreeable but certainly nothing extraordinary or memorable.  After all, when push comes to shove this is still nothing more than seasoned green beans.    In consideration of Hubsâ€™ sensitive innards I substituted cooked and crumbled bacon for the pecans which should have made this even better but these were still rather average green beans.

Great! Added lemon juice, salt, pepper, yellow and red pepper, garlic, onion, carrots. Steamed all items except onion and garlic (softened them in skillet with grapeseed oil). Didn't use the pecans or Old Bay.

I'm not a huge green bean lover, so I left it up to the rest of the family to rate it, and they gave it an emphatic 5 stars!  Super easy, but the Blackened Old Bay is hard to find, even here in Maryland!  I used the same Old Bay that we always use on our crabs, and it was great...

I didn't have any Old Bay so I used some Cajun seasoning and a little bit of butter with the olive oil.  It was very good.

I was looking for a recipe to cook fresh green beans from our garden that would enhance rather than mask the flavor.  Surprisingly this recipe is perfect!  I would have never imagined blackened seasoning to go on any vegetable but it was absolutely delicious!  I used a homemade blackening seasoning recipe rather than Old Bay simply because I didn't have Old Bay on hand.  Well done, very pleased with the recipe.  Thanks.

I love green bean dishes; this one was excellent. The blackened seasoning added a good flavor and the crispness of the green beans was nice.  Fixing it again, I think I would add something for a bit more flavor...maybe a grated cheese.

Great alternative to the usual green bean creamy casserole for Thanksgiving.  A bit too spicy for me, but others loved it in combination with other T-day dishes.  Easy and quick to make, would probably go excellently with fish.  Can't wait to make this again!

Who would have thought that Old Bay seasoning would work with a vegetable such as green beans.  I used frozen green beans and just put them in a pan with EVOO.  Added the Old Bay along with pepper and salt and the family enjoyed.  Thanks.  Made with Elegant Pork Tenderloin from this site.

I never really knew how to make string beans like I had in a restaurant.  Well, now I do.  Easy, tasty and will make them this way gain.  I'm not a fan of old bay so I used fine sea salt and they were perfect.  I made them for diner tonight with a steak and it was like I ordered out from a top restaurant.

My favorite part of this recipe is how quick it is to make such a nice side dish! I used olive oil, walnuts, and regular old bay since I had it on hand. It was great! I'm sure with canola, pecans and blackened old bay it would be even better! This will probably become one of my go-to recipes.

These are awesome and super quick. I have made them with canned green beans and fresh....fresh is always better of course but they both turned out delicious. Unfortunately, my boyfriend says they "still taste like green beans" and made a yuck face so I don't think they are gonna curb a green bean haters dislike. That certainly just means more for me! Also, I used regular old bay and I don't see how they could get any better with anything else.

Great receipe.  As I did not have the Old Bay Seasoning, I used basil Pesto sauce to cook the beans in with a tad bit of olive oil. Just used just enough to cover all the beans and cooked it over med heat until blackened.  The family (who were not green bean fans) LOVED IT!

My husband usually never finishes fresh green beans when I cook them, because they don't taste like his grandma's.  I don't have to worry about that anymore.  He had three helpings of these beans.  Even my kids didn't complain about eating them.  I also didn't have pecans but used whole almonds instead and they tasted great!

Fabulous taste!  I used regular blackening spice and walnuts that I had on hand and the whole thing turned out really well.  I found that chopping the walnuts pretty finely worked really well and made walnuts that were splendidly spicy!  Also used olive oil as I do for everything.

I couldn't find Old Bay Blackened so I made my own blackened seasoning and seasoned the beans with half Regular Old Bay and half blackened seasoning.  Wow!  This was delicious.  The pecans were a great addition.  The beans tasted so great that I tried the seasoning and pecans with broccoli and that was a hit too (my toddler ate the broccoli version).  Yummy!

I liked these well enough to make them again. Hubby had no comment, but I think he prefers just plain ol' green beans. I liked that they were tender-crisp and blackened a little on the outside. The Old Bay gave these a nice flavor. I could have used a lot more because I like things on the spicy side, but they were great overall. Just warm on the spice scale, very mild overall. I used hot oil (chile oil) and EVOO to make this. Very quick and very easy! I used frozen long slender green beans. Did not parboil first.

I made this twice and used a wok.  It came out great and my guests enjoyed this too.  The first time I just used the Old Bay Seasoning (without the blackening since I didn't have it) and the second time I found the seasoning. It was good either way.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of the minced garlic as well.  Excellent!

good complement to seafood or cajun main dish. Mine needed extra time in the oven; maybe it's my oven.

I only gave this four stars because I don't make it exactly as written so I felt I couldn't give five.  However, I thought I should mention that this recipe gave me the idea to use Old Bay on sautÃ©ed green beans, and I now make them this way ALL the time.  I simply heat some olive oil, throw in the beans, and season with a good bit of Old Bay (I don't measure, but for those who said the beans weren't flavorful, just use more Old Bay, they will be delicious).  I also don't have blackened Old Bay, I can't ever find it in the store.  My boyfriend loves when I make green beans this way, and I never would have thought about it if not for this recipe, so thank you!

My family loves old bay with seafood. However this was not the case with green beans. I wouldn't make this recipe again. You could substitute lawrys instead and it would turn out fine.

This was very good.  I used regular Old Bay Seasoning and no nuts as they hurt my husband's teeth.  I usually cook green beans until they are very soft, so this method was new, but the beans were quite tasty.  It will be my go-to recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe! We most often steam or boil our green beans, so it was nice to try something different. We really liked the sweet and savory flavors. We only made slight changes - half butter/half EVOO, and a cajun spice blend - and it turned out great. We will make these again and again.

Wow!  Surprisingly delicious!  Such a simple dish, but really tasty.  The beans get coated beautifully and the pecans make for some nice variation.  To those of you who wonder if you'll like this if you don't also like Old Bay, you will!  I generally don't like Old Bay (I know it from Five Guys' fries), but my fiance loves it so I made this dish, an we BOTH loved it.

This was delicious and quick. I browned an onion and some garlic in olive oil before adding the green beans to saute. I used peanuts - crushed- instead of pecans, and I used Montreal Steak seasoning instead of Old Bay just because I like the flavor better. It was  crispy and tasty.

Yummy! I love the taste of crispy fresh green beans. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't have the old bay seasoning and I know it would have made them taste 10x better.

Mmmmmm. Also added thinly sliced onions, and mushrooms once and it was awesome too. Used Tony's cajun seasoning, it was good. Thanks for the great idea. I have them often!

My husband doesn't like green beans but he rates these 5 stars ...I had to substitute canola oil for 1 TBSP bacon grease and had to use blackened seasoning 1 Tbsp and used 1/2 cup chopped pecans, whole green beans from can drained instead of fresh and sauteed all in hot grease for 1=2 minutes...fast, flavorful, spicy, crunchy...all from canned green beans in 2 minutes...will do over and try original when I have right ingrediants but will always use crisp bacon and onion too.

Probably added more than a teaspoon of Old Bay.  Good, simple dish.  Liked the flavor of added nuts.  Didn't have pecans, but used walnuts instead.

Was easy and delicious. I used montreal steak seasoning rather than old bay, and had to add more salt. Was easy and delicious! Very good with some bacon as well!!

I could not find OLD BAY Blackened seasoning, so I improvised and added some minced garlic instead.  The pecans gave some good flavor and crunch.  Excellent idea.  Extra pecans don't hurt either.  The extra pecans were used as salad topping for added flavor and crunch.

These were really good. Not everyone liked the pecans, though. May try something else next time.
