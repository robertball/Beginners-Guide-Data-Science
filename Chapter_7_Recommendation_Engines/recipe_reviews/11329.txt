An excellent, happy surprise!  As I made these I was unfortunately prepared to be disappointed.  The dough was dry and crumbly so I expected the resulting cookie to be the same.  NOT!  The cookie is just how I like them and don't often get - crunchy! Finally, a crunchy (and crispy too, obviously, from the Rice Krisipies) chocolate chip cookie!  Hmmmm,  the dry and somewhat crumbly dough made for a crunchy cookie - that makes sense!  I suppose if you're not a crunchy cookie lover like I am you could always use half brown sugar instead of all white, or add an extra egg, or a little less flour, or add a little milk, any or all of which would make for a more moist, chewy cookie - or move on to another recipe altogether because this one is just fine as is and I'm sure was designed to have the appealling crunch I love.  I used a 1 T. scoop which made for cute, perfectly shaped little cookies, great for popping in your mouth one after another.

I loved the idea of having rice crispies in chocolate chip cookies but found the dough extremely dry and had a rough time getting them to form into a ball, I will try again with 1 cup of butter and 2 eggs.

EXCELLENT--I'm not sure why the others thought the dough was dry--I followed the recipe exactly, and the dough was perfect.  The cookies are outstanding!

These cookies turned out good. They were a different kind of chocolate chip cookie, more "cake" like. I added in an extra egg, and put a cup less of the rice cereal. The rice cereal made them chewy, and crispy. I would use only 1 cup rice cereal. This recipie is a keeper!

They bake up really nice looking and I didn't have any trouble with the mixture, really fast and easy.
It tastes and smells pretty good. I would say this cookie is a kid's type of cookie.

These cookies were welcome at our picnic. Having followed the recipe exactly they seemed technically correct to me unlike what other reviewers had said. I just needed a little extra muscle in my stirring arm when making the dough and ended up mixing the chips and cereal through with my hands. Kinda messy to assemble into neat little mounds on the cookie sheet but I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty!

These are great, My dough did not seem dry and I followed the directions to a tee. I did the mixing with my kitchen aid. I made a batch with M&Ms also. I would make these again.

I substituted the white sugar with 1 1/3 C. molasses, deducted 5 tbsp of softened butter, and replaced whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour.  My 3 year old loves them, and I definitely enjoy the chocolate fix without feeling too guilty.

I followed the recipe to a "T". Although I found the dough to be dry and crumbly, I continued onward, mixing well. I used a TABLESPOON measuring spoon to scoop out little cookie balls and dropping them onto a baking sheet, sprayed with PAM baking spray. The cookies baked nicely at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. What I had were 36 cute little CRISPY chocolate chip cookies. The cookies were a nice light brown color. I could see little rice crispy cereals baked throughout each cookie as well the chocolate chips. I am so glad that these cookies turned out well. If you are looking for a chocolate chip cookie that is crunchy and crispy-this is it! However, I suggest not altering, modifying, or changing the cookie dough in any shape or form, it will turn out fine in the end. I made these for the guys who can easily pop these delicious cookies into their mouths while working. thank you for sharing this recipe.

These are awesome cookies with the right amount of chewy/crunchy texture and are great with milk.  These remind me of a recipe I cut off of a rice cereal box back in the 70's and were a favorite of mine.  I like to change out the semisweet chips for milk chocolate chips and add a cup of chopped walnuts to the mix.  By the way, if you mix in the chips first, then the cereal, it seems to go better.  Love the recipe!

Looking for a recipe that used crisp rice.  Read the reviews for this and noted that the mixture would be very stiff.  Used a pastry knife to cut it all in rather than stir it.  Added 1/2 cup shredded coconut and used brown and white sugar.  Made exactly 4 dozen cookies.  I would probably try for a softer batter if I made it again.

I didn't find these cookies anything special. They were a bit tasteless and too sweet. I most likely won't make these cookies again.

Decent cookies, but not spectacular. I thought it was a good idea to reduce the rice krispies a little (I wouldn't reduce by half, however), and add more chocolate chips, butter and egg for better batter. I think brown sugar would help out too with flavor, making it more like a traditional chocolate chip cookie.

This is a great recipe, one our whole family loves.  We prefer to make giant cookies with this recipe. 
I make a few changes to this recipe: 4X batch (results in 6 cups flour and 8 cups rice crispies), cut the sugar back to 3 cups for the 4X batch, add an extra egg, and an extra cup of rice crispies (totalling 9 cups for 4X batch). This takes a very large bowl to make, and I literally mix in the rice crispies and chocolate chips with my bare hands, you have to knead it like bread or pottery clay to get it to mix, the batter is very stiff at this point. It takes a lot of dough to make a cookie, so you need a large batch if you want very many cookies. You can use this recipe to make as large of a cookie as you want, press it out to a uniform thickness of about 1/2 inch and shape the edges to the shape you want. You can fill the whole cookie sheet with one cookie - it can be fun to make, and to eat. :) For home use, I usually make 6 inch cookies. To do this I use an empty 28 oz tomato sauce can (that is about 4 inches wide), cut out both ends and use it for the cookie mold. I dump in a big spoonfull of dough and press it down evenly (about 1/2 inch thick) with my applesauce masher. This makes quick/easy, impressive/perfect, and delicious cookies.

Just "OK" for us. Kids weren't impressed w/a "crunchy" chocolate chip cookie & we did end up tossing them after they kept coming home in lunchboxes untouched.

Very good crispy crunchy chocolate chip cookie. I made larger cookies (used a 3T. scoop) and cooked for 15 minutes. Cookies do not spread or flatten much like most other C.C. Cookie recipes. When scooping do not pack dough, cookies present better if the dough is scooped loose. Much easier to work the chips and cereal in by hand (I wore a plastic glove). Next I make these though I will reduce the sugar down to 3/4 cup because I found them to be just a bit too sweet (my preference) and hope that it doesn't change the recipe. Once cooled these cookies are crispy and crunchy all the way through.

For me, this was a great recipe to use up my leftover holiday coloured rice krispies (notice the photo!!).  I was quite pleased to stumble across it and my 4 year old was thrilled to help me make them!  The dough is kind of a pain to work with (I found) and I needed to use my hands to incorporate all of the chocolate chips and rice krispies.  It does appear at the time to be somewhat crumbly, but once baked, they hold together nicely and have a nice crunch from the krispies!  I know my 4 year old loved them, as did the hubby and my 9 and 7 year old boys will be thrilled with the treat when the get home from school today for snack!

I put my Rice Krispies in the blender and added the cereal flour instead of the whole puffed rice pieces. It gave the cookies a nice chewiness. The cookies didn’t spread like the last I made the cookie this way. I think it’s because my flour was too packed into my cup measurement (after some google research). I’ll also try to substitute some of the white sugar with brown to see if it adds to the flavor. I want to experiment with the Rice Krispies flour more!

When I saw "18 servings" I thought "why bother?" so I doubled the recipe. Other than that, for half the granulated sugar I used an equal portion of slightly packed light brown sugar (I just like the flavor that adds). I tried two thicknesses, one about 3/4" thick and the other about 3/8". The thicker ones (which my wife prefers) are a little softer but (to me) the rice krispies were a little on the chewy side. The thinner ones (which I prefer) had a very satisfying crunch, but were not hard or tough ... kinda like original Chips Ahoy texture. I used the Holiday Rice Krispies since these were for Christmas-time and they look festive. I made 2 dozen thick ones and nearly 3 dozen thin ones out of the double batch.

I loved the flavor of this cookie, although baking it exactly to recipe at 350F for 12 minutes produced a pale, somewhat soft cookie in my oven.  I baked the next sheet at 325F for 15 minutes and then rotated the pan and baked an additional 10 minutes.  The cookies were a nice golden brown at that point and I let them remain/cool on the pan.  The resulting cookies were crunchy - this is exactly the kind of cookie I was looking for!  Try this recipe and play around with the baking time and temperature to see what you get.  This one is a keeper for me.

LOVE a crisp choc chip cookie :)  Want to get creative...next time I may use 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 peppermint extracts, or use some/all mint choc chips, or maybe I'll try orange extract and semi-sweet chips :)
