Wonderfully simple and delicious.  I did not use all the same toppings that this recipe calls for, but the bread is first rate for fire-grilled pizzas.  I made my own hummus for the pizza as well as a tomato-base pizza sauce.  I substituted AP flour and olive oil for whole wheat and apple sauce without sacrificing any texture or taste.  My wife has asked me every day for the last week to make batches of the bread to freeze for future use.
