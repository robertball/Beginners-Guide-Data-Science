My mother has made this recipe for years but she uses apricot or peach flavored jello. Extremely easy and tastes great.

Really enjoyed the recipe! Found it easy and satisfying for a dessert. Would like to try it with cherry gelatin next. I couldn't find apricot baby food so I used babyfood peaches.
