these were easy to make! i left out the raisins, and watched them closely to make sure they didn't get over done or too hard on the outside, like the other reviewers mentioned. i ended up baking them for only 16 minutes at 400 degrees, but they still came out a little bit hard on just the outside edges. for the icing, i used my moms christmas cookie icing recipe that is basically the exact same except you add a bit of vanilla (or butter flavoring, whichever you prefer/have on hand) & about a tbsp of room temp. butter into the mix. i have had better cinnamon rolls, but these were still pretty good. next time i make these i will add more cinnamon and sugar, maybe some chopped nuts, and i think i'll try brushing the outer edges with some melted butter to see if that helps keep them soft.

This was my first time making these. They tasted wonderful, but were kind of hard on the outside. I will definitely be making them again, I want to see if I can maybe cook them a little less time so they are softer.

Yeah, the outside was a little hard, but they were yummy. I ADDED a "splash" of vanilla to the glaze...mmmm!

the cinnamon rolls were all right ,but the glaze was very strachy.
