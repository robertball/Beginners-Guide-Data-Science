I loved this burger. It was a little sweet. I used beef consomme instead of broth. I left mine off the bun and it was great all by itself. I don't think my husband would like this one though as it is a bit sweet and has soy and ginger. All of which I love, all of which he doesn't.  Thanks Campbell's!
