I work at a preschool and we have used this concept with various foods for some of our "pickier" eaters.  It usually works!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this 5 stars because the kids had a blast making faces. They didn't really eat the carrots very well though and all of them wanted a dip to go with it. I would suggest having peanut butter or a veggie cream cheese for them to use. Thanks for the recipe.

My daughter is 10 yrs old and still enjoys the face shapped type of food.
