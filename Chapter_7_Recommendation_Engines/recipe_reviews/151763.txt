These cookies are very good.  They are dry, so you'll need lots of milk to drink.  I used a zylis cheese grater to quickly and evenly grate the white chocolate.  Cool the cookies completely before dipping them in the milk chocolate.  After melting the milk chocolate, I waited until it cooled a bit so it would go on thick when dipped and not melt the white chocolate snow.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were great.  They looked so pretty on the plate and tasted terrific.  My husband loved them.  

I chopped up the pecans and  mixed them in with the flour while the butter softened, about 1 1/2 hrs...this flavoured the flour a little which gave the cookie a really nice flavour.  

This recipe really makes a small batch, only about 18 cookies.  

For presentation, simplicity and taste I give this 5 stars!

These cookies were a little hard to handle while shaping, but the outcome was good.  The cookie is a little dry, but very tastey.

These were pretty good. I used coconut instead of white chocolate shavings b/c I didn't have any.

Awesome recipe!  As others have said, it's dry, but it's dry in a shortbread kind of way - crumbly and melt-in-your-mouth.  Think Pecan Sandies.  I don't like white chocolate, so I topped them with shredded coconut and got the same effect.  Just great!
