I had this recipe once at a friends house and was blown away.  This is probably my favourite meal ever.  I server it with a side of grilled chicken breast and it's complete.  Some posters have commented on the overpowering of the lemon juice, but I totally have to disagree.  It's absolutely perfect as the recipe states.  It's also delicious if you throw in some diced cucumber.  If I had to live off of one meal for the rest of my life, this would be it!  I bring it to every party I go to, and always carry a few copies of the recipe because at least one person asks for it!

I took this dish to a couple of parties and I am still getting emails from people asking for the recipe.  The last time I made this, I added some artichoke hearts and used herbed feta cheese instead of plain.  Very good!!!

This is a good recipe, the feta cheese makes it sooo tasty!  I substituted sun dried tomatoes in oil for the fresh. Will make again.

This is so much like a mediterranean salad I had on a trip to San Francisco.  We had it with our grilled chicken.  Only addition I made was some chopped cucumber.  Will make this often this summer.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July party and it was a hit!  I did reduce the lemon juice a bit, added a splash of red wine vinegar and used grape tomatoes cut in half instead of cutting a whole tomato.  I made it the night before and added a little bit more olive oil along with a pinch of salt and pepper and stirred it again before serving.  Everyone just loved it!  I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! I added cucumber and used a little less lemon juice based on other reviews. I will definately be making this again.

Tasted great, except it the lemon was way too overpowering! I would put at least half of the reccomended amount of lemon juice into it.

just made this tonight --- added a baja citris grilled chicken to the recipe and just served it warm over the top and it was delicious!  I skipped the parsley because I didn't have it and would skip it again.  Very simple flavor, but enough flavor to have you coming back for me.  I am looking forward to lunch tomorrow.

super fresh, and very easy. a definite crowd pleaser. i used a kalamata olive bruschetta (instead of plain olives), which was easy and added some extra flavor.

This dish is very light-tasting, enjoyable on a hot summer's day...I just didn't love it.  The man of the house liked this much more than me.  I would possibly make this again, take as a side dish for an outside get-together or seomthing like that.  It didn't taste bad, by any means, just didn't "wow" the taste buds.

This was so acidic. I should have followed the advice of others and cut down on the lemon juice.  Overall though, not that impressed.

I make this recipe all the time now, since it is things I usually have on hand.  It is absolutely delicious.  It makes a great packed lunch as it is wonderful room temperature and better the next day!  The only change that I would make is that I prefer it without the parsley.  Just a personal preference!

This was very tasty. I added some chopped mint to mine as well as chopped cucumber. I thought it was a wee lemony, so will increase olive oil and decrease lemon juice next time.

Yummy! Really easy but I give it 4 stars because I halved the lemon juice and that was perfect for us.

The only original change I made was to cut the lemon juice in half (based on so many reviewers who said the original amount was too much). I would have liked it better had I not of chopped the tomatoes and olives as small as I did. Prior to serving I tasted it, after it had set for several hours, and I felt it was bland so I ended up having to add ingredients to "jazz it up". Sorry, but it is not a recipe I would make again.

I cut this recipe in half because I was cooking for two.  I loved it, but would cut the lemon juice in half again because it was too  much lemon, especially for my husband's taste.  I love lemon but found that was the predominant taste.  Other than that, though, I will cook it again and again.

I didn't read the reviews first. I used bottled lemon juice and my salad was soupy, I had to serve it with a slotted spoon. Less dressing would have been better. If it had been less soupy this would have been perfect.

Swapped the orzo for farfalle and left the olives on the side (bf is a fan but I am not). This was delicious! Perfect ratio of ingredients.

This was a really good recipe! I added some corn,  and leftover cauliflower and broccoli mix as well as green peas. I omitted the tomatoes because my dd is allergic to them. Next time, I'll cut the olive oil in half, it was a little too oily.

This is my go to pasta dish to bring to parties. I have been asked for the recipe every single time I have made it for people. As far as I am concerned, you can't overdo the feta or olives. Excellent recipe!

A terrific recipe.  This was a last-minute choice so  of necessity I had to make a few substitutions. But we loved them.  Home grown tomatoes were gone, so I used Bella Sun Luci Sun dried julienne cut tomatoes with Italian herbs.  This gave the orzo a wonderful flavor.  No Kalamatas so used regular black olives, sliced, and cut back on the lemon juice as others suggested.  Will make  the recipe this same way next time.

Nice recipe but instead of lemon juice I added fat-free Italian dressing less than half a cup to a half

Delish. Very light and refreshing.  My kids loved it too-they picked out the olives, though. :)

Great and easy dish for the summer or spring! I didn't have fresh oregano so I just used dried oregano. Next time I may add a few other veggies like corn corn or chickpeas.

I made this for husband and myself on a "date night."  It was absolutely delicious.  I did not change the recipe at all.  I would eat this every day if I could.  Thanks for the great dish!
