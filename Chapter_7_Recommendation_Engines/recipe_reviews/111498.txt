Jambalaya ?  Where is the Holy Trinity ? The Cayene pepper ?  and most important - the Rice ?  This is Seafood Pasta Sauce!

This has a great concept. I didn't use the crab boil and instead used 4 bay leaves,  tblsp cayenne pepper, a bit of ground sage, white pepper and 1 tbls ground thyme instead. The stewed tomatoes added a flavor that was just wonderful. 
It doesn't bother me that LASmith called it jambalaya. Would LASmith have gotten 5 stars if they'd called it Seafood Pasta?  I think people can call a dish anything they want. I'd like to know why BJ didn't like it. 

We thought it was great, and easy too. It makes a lot so I will cut the recipe in half next time, but it will be nice for lunch at work on Monday!

Great â€“ I  had no Italian sausage on hand,  I just used a polish hot sausage and  I had no scallops   So I use shrimp instead and I will make it again excellent Dinner.
