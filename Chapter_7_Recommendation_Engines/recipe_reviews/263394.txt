Pretty good. Make sure to let it it after baking to absorb liquids.

Turned out so amazing!! Literally this dish is like something you'd get from a restaurant. I didn't use Romano cheese I just added extra parm and it still turned out delicious!!

I would 100% make this dish again. Perfect and easy to make  for a family meal. I made it without dill (only because I forgot to buy it from the store) and it was a hit. Paired with a nice Chardonnay called Buttercup.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used half the pasta. (We love saucy pasta!) This was very easy to make and the whole family loved it. I do not have an oven proof saucepan, so I just put everything in a casserole dish and baked it. I will definitely make this again.

TREMENDOUS RECIPE!!! I saut√©ed some shiitake mushrooms to add some rich umami flavor. My whole family scarfed it down in minutes. I usually cook meals to last two days. There were no leftovers that night. Will definitely make this again.

Soooo delicious! I agreed scallops with the shrimp and I did not use still because I don't like the taste. I used bow tie noodles. Super easy and my husband loved it!!

This recipe is fantastic! However, I did tweak the recipe a bit. I DID NOT use any dill...not a fan...but I did add bacon and mushrooms. I added them with the shrimp as it was cooking. Turned out fantastic! I will definitely make this dish again.

I loved this recipe.  Everything sounded perfect especially with so many reviews saying they did not change a thing.   My men in the house loved it and thought it wasn't too rich and cheesy.  With that in mind I did alter it slightly only b/c of what I had in the house.  Instead of the Parmesan, Romano and Mozzarella noted in the recipe, I used 1/2 c. of Italian Blend shredded cheese.   I had only 1 lb of large shrimp but next time I will go with the suggested medium shrimp and maybe add a bit more.   Also my son went to the pantry and got some crushed red pepper to add to his dish.  That gave it a little zing.   Personally I will add more a bit more garlic next time.   All in all this is a great recipe that I will make again.  Thanks Ed and Angela!!

Wow!! Great Dish! Looking forward to the leftovers!
I doubled the Romano and ended up adding a Tbsp cornstarch to thicken near the end - juicy shrimp...
full of flavour.

I didn't have any chicken stock on hand so I just used water and I don't think you could tell the difference.  Also, I added a smidgeon extra mozzarella cheese.  It was delicious.
