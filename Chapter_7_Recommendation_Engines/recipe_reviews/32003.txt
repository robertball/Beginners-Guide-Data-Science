If you want the bread crumbs to really stick to the turkey or chicken, add a beaten egg to the milk. First flour the breasts, then dip in milk/egg mixture and then seasoned bread crumbs. This will also make a delicious chicken or turkey parmesan. Make sure you split the breasts, pound them thin but not paper thin. Layer bottom of pan with tomato sauce, place breasts on top, top with more sauce, and then grated pizza cheese and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil. Bake for about 20 min in 350' oven or until cheese melts and the sauce bubbles. Delicious

Easy, Easy, Easy!  I have a one year old son at home and the ease of this recipe is a blessing--and it tastes great too.  I followed others' advice (dredge in flour, dip in egg+milk, then coat) and fried at medium heat, and the pieces turned out beautifully.  I didn't bother cutting into strips and I actually liked the presentation better this way (served with couscous and spinach salad as sides).  

Several changes that I made (mostly due to the lack of ingredient):  Instead of Italian seasoning, I used dried thyme, basil, and parsley; instead of regular grated parmasean I only had the "zesty pepper" variety (worked great!); and I rubbed the turkey in some onion and garlic powder before coating.

One note:  this recipe makes way too much breading.  Over half of the mixture I made went unused.

This was a great fast recipe. I tinkered a bit by using chicken breasts instead of turkey and water cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. It came out great--like an upscale version of chicken fingers. Also, they were great the next day served cold with a little honey mustard for dipping. I'll be making this one often.

This is easy and great tasting. To get the bread crumbs to stick better, in this or any other breaded meat recipe, mix a good teaspoon of real mayo (not the sweet stuff!!) into the egg and milk mixture. It really helps the "stick factor."  (The mayo will look a little lumpy in the egg/milk mixture...don't worry about it...it mixes in better with a stick blender, but I've done it more often than not with a fork and it's fine.) Anyway, this is a nice, quick and delicious dinner with some green veggies and salad. Thanks.

Great recipe. Like others have mentioned, I used chicken breast, rather than turkey.  I also chose to bake in a hot oven (450) after pounding the chicken somewhat thin, rather than fry.  I used egg in the milk prior to breading.  Italian bread crumbs worked well.  The chicken was really tender.  The family loved it.

I've made this recipe for years but I  use boneless chicken breasts most of the time because my family likes chicken better than turkey. I've also used pork tenderloin, cut into medallion size pieces and flatten a little. Dip into seasoned flour, then beaten egg and finally into the breadcrumbs.

Very tasty!  My husband and son (4 yrs old) were eating the strips as soon as I took them off the pan.  Juicy and yummy!  I served them by putting them on top of hot pasta and then pouring a homemade tomato sauce over them and then melting some jack cheese on top.  YUM!

Excellent... I like the Parmesan ... Suggestion: start dredging the turkey or chicken breast in flour, then either in a beaten egg, with salt and pepper, or in buttermilk, then in seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also use Canola instead of olive oil

Great recipe!  I did what others said to do with the beaten egg/mayo and the flour.  My friend's mom made these when we were kids and she always served it with a really SWEET and THICK spaghetti/marinara sauce (just add tomato paste and sugar to some prego) and it just makes the turkey taste SO much better.  Also Pasta Roni has an angel hair pasta that goes really well as a side with the turkey and the sauce.

tasty, easy weeknight meal. I dredged the meat through a mixture of egg and a little milk before dipping in the bread crumb mixture.

I was looking for something different to do with turkey and this is it! After reading a few reviews I made a few minor changes. First I added an egg to the milk mixture, dipped the turkey in it then seasoned the meat followed with dipping them in the breadcrumb mixture (instead of plain bread crumbs I used Italian). Very tender & moist & well received. Thanks :)

I used SOOUTHPHILLY's recommendation and dipped the chicken breast in flour, then in the milk, which I added an egg to, and then in the bread crumbs.  It was absolutely delicious!  It went nicely with the "Pasta with Sweet Peas" recipe found on this website!

I think this recipe is excellent. I like a little more spice to some things, so I added a bit of garlic powder. I think ginger or allspice would be nice as well. I give it a 5.

This was an okay recipe, but I don't think it tasted right because I couldn't find a 1 1/2 lb turkey breast meat at the butcher.  All I could find was the honey roasted turkey breasts at the butcher and I don't think it was the right type of breast meat. The bread crumbs didn't really stick to the turkey breasts either probably because of the type of meat it was.

Certainly easy enough and quite tasty and quick.  Following some of the other reviewers' suggestions, I also used egg with the milk.

Great recipe.  I have a very VERY picky family and they all loved it.  The only substitute I made was using Italian bread crumbs in place of the plain bread crumbs and seasoning.  I also topped mine with cheese.  Will definately make this again.

A delicious alternative to the usual chicken. It's quick, easy and inexpensive...I already had most of the ingredients right here. I'm always looking for dishes to make when I get home from work that aren't overly complicated but still tasty..this is a definite addition.

I made this for my kids and they loved it.  very good with chicken as well, and if you have italian preseasoned bread crumbs, you can use those and omit the italian seasoning.  Very yummy, and a definate repeat

I used chicken instead of turkey, and the results were fabulous. I marinated the chicken in different spices and then followed the recipe for an absolutely delicious treat.  My entire household enjoyed it, and asked when I would make it again.

This was great I even used it on chicken which I prefer because chicken is more tender then turkey in my opinion.

This was a good recipe, but it needs a bit more flavor.  I'm going to try adding more Parmesan and italian seasoning next time.

Glad to have found a turkey cutlet recipe.  Better than chicken, I think.  Smells good.  Tastes good.  Needed some salt on the meat or in the bread crumbs to bring out the flavor.

I took the advice of another poster and used an egg with the milk to really make the bread crumbs stick. There aren't took many recipes I've found out there specifically for turkey breasts and this one is definitely a keeper.

This was a simple and quick recipe to make.  I would cut back on the bread crumbs and milk though as most of it was left over after dipping and breading.  I used Greek seasoning, but you could season with whatever you enjoy.

Good flavor, because of the olive oil, but the bread mixture did not stick to the turkey, it stuck to the pan.  I will next time, dip the turkey in egg and fry on low temperature, instead.

This was a nice alternative to chicken cutlets.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added additional basil.  Next time, I will increase the amount of parmesan cheese.  I will make this again!  It was a quick and easy mid-week meal!

Great easy recipe. I used to the cooked Turkey as burgers patties. My bf loved it so much he actually ate 2 burgers. Would definetly make again!! I also used a meat hammer to tenderise the meat and I used egg instead of milk which worked great. In fact, probably helped the bread crumbs stick better

Very good! Super easy to make, didn't have italian seasoning on hand so just use some garlic and herb salt with a teaspoon of oregano and it was tasty. Did what others suggested, used 1 egg and 1 teaspoon mayo to make the crumbs stick. Will remake this often

The breading was good, but for some reason my turkey breasts were dry.
