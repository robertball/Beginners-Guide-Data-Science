Delicious!! I made my own Cuban bread from your recipe: outstanding bread taste!  I am going to do 3 things differently the next time I make this. First: Pat dry the pickle slices. Second: coat both sides of the sandwich with the mayo/mustard sauce completely, but keep it a thin layer. Third: Rinse the barbecue sauce  off the precooked pulled pork I used and pat it dry.  I had a problem with the sandwich toppings oozing out of the sides when I compressed it.  I'm thinking the drier it is on the inside going into the pan, the less will ooze out during cooking.  (It was still yummy!) Thanks, Chef!!

Fantastic. I made it with less mustard, but I think it was not enough, so the recipe must be right on.  I loved it, and it tasted like it came from a high -end sandwich shop.

One of the few recipes I've tried and I wouldn't change a thing.  I pulled out my old George Foreman grill, and while it took a little longer than the recipe, it was delicious!!!!  The cayenne really added a great kick.  I should also add I used pork tenderloin that I grilled last night instead of carnitas.

I absolutely love Cuban sandwiches. I could eat this everyday. I think the flavors of this sandwich depend on the quality of the individual ingredients. This will be a regular in my home.

Made my pork shoulder the night before. Seasoned the pork with malt vinegar, cumin and Jamaican jerk seasoning. To build I  used ciabatta bread, pickles, peppered ham, Swiss, mayo spiced with cumin and Dijon and finally the pork. Was outstanding. Took panini machine to work and fed the guys for 3 days.!!!!!

Nice simple 5 minute way to amp up a ham and cheese. I needed more of the dressing than expected. I think I'll try adding lettuce/tomato next time, maybe even salami, and I might try squeezing some orange and limes juices on the pork to make it seem more 'Cuban'.

The recipe is delicious, but the technique is not easy to master.  I cooked a Pork Butt marinaded in Lalechonera Mojo sauce and cooked it in a pressure cooker, then pulled when done and made sandwiches.  I have not yet perfected the grilling of the sandwich for results as found in Miami/Hialeah, FL.  Mine came out either too crispy or just buttery.  Otherwise this was delicious and might even serve to guests.

This sandwich is good. However, to be more authentic, you would never use mayonnaise. Authentic Cuban bread is a must, so thank you for having the bread recipe. When Iâ€™m not where I have access to real Cuban bread, I use French bread or bolillo rolls.

Yum!  Mine turned out with a slight sweetness that I'm not sure where it came from. 
Used wheat sub roll, packaged pork shoulder (maybe the sauce was sweet, I got most of it off).

Used the Carnitas recipe on AllRecipes for the pork in this.  Love these sandwiches. Get yourself a panini press and make these. You won't regret it.

These sandwiches were a little demanding for me. I had some pork shoulder to use up, so I put it in a crock pot with some water for eight hours. Also, I made Chef John's Cuban bread. I used ham and swiss cheese from the deli. For the sauce, I finished up some Hellman's mayonnaise (the measurement was a little less than 1/4 cup) and Grey Poupon mustard, instead of yellow mustard. Since I don't like cayenne pepper, I used chili powder. Constructing the sandwich, I overloaded with the ingredients. I cooked it on the stove in a cast iron pan (with another cast iron pan to weigh it down). My sandwich ended up being browned and huge. Next time, I won't fill the bread to busting and I will season the pulled pork. It was good.

First time making a cuban sandwich and this recipe was very good. Could use more than a pinch of cayenne pepper but be careful to not over do it. For the bread we used hoagie rolls but they rolled when pressed. The taste though was very good and I will definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe!  Made it with slices of leftover pork roast that was warmed in micro before making sandwiches then cooked it on our George Foreman .  I may never eat a Cuban out again!

Amazing, Chef John has done it again. The whole family loved this sandwich. The sauce is perfect,  I love how crisp the outside of the sandwich was and oh so melty on the inside. I had made a pork roast in the slow cooker the day before to make this recipe.

I made this with french bread and precooked pulled pork from the grocery store, it was delicious! Be careful when toasting it as I almost burned mine. Also I used thick swiss cheese so I only used two slices per sandwich instead of four.

Closest thing to the famous sandwich I'd had a few years ago in South Florida. Nowhere else does it justice. Make the bread and try making your own pickles, or getting the pickles from Bubbies.  I'd recommend making this with a good Cuban black beans and rice recipe rather than chips of any sorts.

Whole family loved this recipe. I used a store-bought, premade pulled pork. It came in Hickory BBQ sauce. I am not sure if this is how it is suppose to be, but tasted great!

I will definitely make this again.  After watching the video, we wrapped a brick in foil and that did the trick.  Could not find our   sandwich press!
