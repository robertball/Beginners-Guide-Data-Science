Sorry, but this is not authentic. I am German and even live there. We never use peeled potatos, just cook whole potatos, peel them pretty hot, cut and mix them with the sauce. Then they soak it up well when still hot. This is also too less sauce, we make a mix of hot broth and put in the vinegar/oil/salt/pepper/onion and pour it over the potatos. Broth as much as you need to make it moist and lightly creamy, depends on the potatos.. between half up to one cup and season it well so the salad doesnt get bland. And no.. not so much sugar. Max. 1 tablespoon. We dont like sweet salat. Add bacon at the end.. or whatever you like. We often put thinly sliced cucumber in it, maybe give it a try. Greets from Bavaria.. :-)

I am German, 100%. I have been eating German Potato Salad almost all my many, many years. I've cooked many German Potato salads myself. I cooked this one today and my spouse and guests raved about it. We all agree it is better than what is served in our authentic German restaurants/German societies. I also cooked "Wisconsin Bratwurst" from Allrecipes. Opened up a jar of Aunt Nellie's red cabbage to go along with all this. What a feast!!!Vundabar!!!

My "authentic" recipe calls for a teaspoon of celery seed, it adds a nice texture...this is my favorite potato salad.  You can use the same bacon/onion/vinegar/sugar sauce for spinach or bibb lettuce -- pour the sauce while hot over the greens to create a fabulous "wilted lettuce" salad.

I have been wanting to make German Potato Salad for years and never knew how. I picked this one and I am so glad that I did! However I used more bacon than called for. I didn't have fresh parsley so I threw in some dried parsley and then I sprinkled in just a little celery seed. I also used white vinegar as called for and not cider vinegar as some other recipes used. It was so good that I will probably never make traditional potato salad again. This is a lot easier too! I printed this and added it to my recipe notebook! This is a keeper! I can't wait to make this for company! If I could have given it more than five stars I would have!

We were having a luncheon at the University I work at around Christmas time and everyone was to bring a recipe from their ethnic background.  I am German/Irish and I decided to cook something German rather than Irish.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a go.  The only thing I added was a little celery seed.  There was a contest for the best dish brought to this luncheon.  Everyone there, about 40/50 people, placed their vote.  I was hearing everyone around me talking about how good the german potatoe salad was and to my surprise, I won first place and a $50 gift certificate.  So, this recipe is wonderful!  I'm making it again tomorrow for another luncheon, but there won't be any prizes this time.  Pretty good for someone who never made German potatoe salad before.

This is my German mom's recipe too, minus the sugar. I also use more water as the potatoes really do soak up a lot of the liquid. This is an amazing potato salad that everyone should try at least once.

I lived in Basel, Switzerland, for 16 years and spent a lot of time right over the border in Germany. They have great salads, meats, dairy's (oh dear!) and breads! My ex German mother in law made a great potato salad, but I have to say that for my own taste buds, this blew hers right out of the water.  Be sure to curb the sugar to taste, however.  Go slow as you go, tasting it.  

One major potato rule, especially for those who found it too dry, is that baking potatoes are starchy.  Use Yukon, Charlotte, or New Red potatoes, as they are waxy...meaning they don't fall apart or lose their texture, but they also allow the dressing to rest on top rather than being absorbed and disappearing, causing the potatoes to get dry.

Too bland? Peel and slice the potatoes to quarter inch thickness and boil them in broth: they'll absorb the flavor very well :) 

For those reviewers who found it without texture, try adding yellow mustard seed...just a pinch, and thinly sliced celery over a mandolin or celery tops, finely chopped and freshly sliced green onions :)  That's my rant! I loved this, but do curb the sugar! And, yes, you can whisk in an egg into the dressing, giving it a creaminess as long as you let it set in the pan a minute or two to cook. There are so many ways to make German potato salad, so please appreciate the variations and have fun with them! If you can't say anything nice, why say anything at all? Cooking is fun! And thank you for the recipe!

This was a delicious potato salad! I hate mayo, so I was on the hunt for a potato salad that didn't have mayo in it and found this gem! I made it the night before for a BBQ the next day and just popped it in the oven 30 minutes before we were about to eat to reheat it through. It came out perfectly and not dried out. I also tripled the recipe to feed a dozen people.

My husband doesn't like the traditional egg potato salad, so I had to come up with a potato salad he would like.  I figured it must be the eggs and mayo aspect of the recipe that didn't sit well with him.  I found this wonderful rendition and he (and the rest of whosenever I make it for) loves it!  Especially others who don't normally like potato salad--I can't keep a full dish!  Thanks!

This potato salad is quite good.  My only complaint is that the sauce did not go far enough.  I'll double it next time.  We had these with barbequed ribs -- quite good!!

I thought this was a great recipe, just a little sweet for my taste.  I have been looking for a good German potato salad recipe, and I will definitely make this one again.  I will just cut back on the sugar a little next time.

Ich bin ein Berliner!!!!! No.... I'm not a jelly doughnut.....  But this german potato salad COMPLETELY RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this 5 days ago, and followed the recipe to the letter.  VERY good, but I have to say, I made it again tonight with these changes and I like my changes.... Mmmmmmmmmmmm

I cut my potatoes into cubes, but smaller cubes, so I can cram more of them into my mouth, and... so they cook faster....

4 slices of bacon?......  If I was on a diet!  I use 6 to 8 slices depending on how much I have left in the fridge.  As for putting in half and mixing and then 1/2 on top at the end, that's good for show, so if you're taking it to a group outing or cook-off, then do that for show, but if you're eating it on your own, just put 100% in the pan and mix together for best results.

I also use Apple Cider Vinegar and more like 1/3 cup for this many potatoes.  Apple Cider Vinegar is DEFINITELY worth it, as it adds a little kick to the 'taters.

Thanks!

This turned out great and very authentic!  I made some minor changes; I cooked 5 lbs of red potatoes in their skins and then, after cooking, I removed the skins and sliced them.  Since I estimated that I doubled the amount of potatoes in the existing recipe, I doubled the rest of the ingredients .. but then it still seemed dry so I made another single serving of the vinegar mixture and added that.  I would suggest that the liquid be poured ON the potatoes instead of adding the potatoes to the liquid because a lot of my potatoes broke while I was trying to stir the liquid off the bottom.  I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator and took it out in the morning to bring it to room temperature before serving so the bacon fat didn't congeal.  The end result was worth the trouble .. it really was yummy!

I don't know about the authentic name on this recipe but I do know it is great.  I got great comments on it at church luncheon.  The changes I made:  I used gourmet small red potatoes.  I boiled them for ten minutes skin on and cut them in eighths.  I layered potatoes, vinegar dressing, fresh parsley, and bacon until I finished the top of the salad with lots of parsley and bacon. Layering kept me from having to disturb the potatoes with too much stirring and evenly distibuted the great taste.  Put it in the recipe box.

Rather than frying the bacon in strips and crumbling it over the salad, I just cut the bacon into small pieces and fried it that way. I found the bacon easier to handle.

I'm from Stuttgart, Germany and this is not how we make potato salad. We cook the whole potatoes and peel them while they are still hot. In Stuttgart we slice the potatoes very thin.  We add some broth, vinegar and oil, salt, pepper and diced onions. Absolutely no sugar. You can add some sliced boiled eggs on top of the salad for decor.
No heating up the potato salad. We serve it cold. I did not know that potato salad was served warm until I came to the USA

I can't say enough about this recipe!  No one could believe that this was homemade!  I made a few adjustments, first of all I doubled the recipe b/c I was serving 12 and that was plenty.  I used almost a pound of bacon and then drained 1/2 the fat off before adding the onion.  I also cut back a little on the sugar but I would cut back even farther.  Oh..I also used redskin potatoes b/c I knew they would be sitting in a crockpot for a few hours.  They held up perfectly!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

OK, let me say how impressed I am.  I lived in Austria and Germany for several years, and have eaten kilo afer kilo of this culinary delight.  The dressing was absolutely what we ate there.  Es war halt fantatisch!
My one critique was how the potatoes were prepared.  Most of the potato salads I had in OS and DE boiled the potatoes whole for 11-15 minutes.  They would then let them cool, then peel and sliced thin into discs.  The slightly cooled discs were then added to the hot dressing.  I prefer the mouthfeel of the slices potatoes rather then cubing them, and I felt like boiling them precut they were a tiny bit overcooked.  Having said that, this was an amazing recipe, which is why I gave it five stars as written.

I've never had German potato salad before, so I had nothing to compare it to for authenticity, but this was absolutely divine!  The best part is you don't have to worry about letting it sit out like American potato salad.  Also, this is even better the next day - in fact, I would recommend making it at least a few hours ahead of time to give all the flavors a chance to combine.

I asked my authentice German neighbor (born and reared in Germany, married an American soldier 16 years ago then came to America) about this recipe, which I found to be delicious. She said it is very similar to what her 100% authentic German mother made and still makes, excepting the parsley, less sugar, and more onion.

This is about as authentic as it gets!
Delicious!!!
Because of the cholesterol, I am considering using canola or olive oil instead of bacon grease and substituting artificial bacon bits.

We had this with grilled bratwurst tonight.  What a wonderful combination.  At first I thought it was going to be too sweet, but as the flavors began to blend and cook a little bit I realized I was wrong.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband especially liked the flavors.  We’ll save this in our tried and true cookbook.  Thank you.

Wow! This is great.

I cut the sugar 1/3, as someone had mentioned it was sweet; it's easier to add more.

I doubled the sauce (as someone else had suggested) by halving the potatoes. That means, 1.5 lbs. red potatoes w/the rest of the ingredients. 

I forgot to peel the potatoes. Mistake! The peels come off when everything mixes together, so don't make my mistake.

My husband loved this, too, but prefers next time I slice, not dice, the potatoes.

I hate German food, and I don't know what possessed me to taste this, but once I did I wanted to eat the whole batch at once. It's heavenly, and I'll be making it again and again.

Thakns so much!!!

I am German, born and raised, German citizen, and there are many different ways to make German potato salad. There is no "we do it this way". For example, I make mine with Miracle Whip. Very authentic German, seeing as I am German and made this for many years before moving to the US when I was 24. There is no one way to make a German potato salad. Not to mention that different regions have different ways of doing things. 
Now go make this potato salad and enjoy it. :) Who cares what it's called, as long as it tastes good. :)

This is a great recipe, I just finished making it.  We're taking it to a cookout later today - then we'll know how good it is.  For all the complaints about whether it's "authentic German" or not:   this morning I told my German wife (unlike many Americans who say "I'm German" or whatever, she is REALLY German born in Duesseldorf and we married while I was in the Army in Germany) that I wanted to make "German potato salad" and she got out all the ingredients for potato salad from her region - North Rhein Westfalia - including pickles and mayo.   I said, no, we're doing this, and she said, "oh that's how they make it in Bavaria."  There are COUNTLESS recipes for "authentic German potato salad"!
   This is a great dish -- at the advice of many, I used much less sugar and it came out really good.  I tripled the recipe since we're going to a cookout and that was okay, too.  Thanks!

This is delicious. I boiled the potatoes whole in their jackets to avoid absorbing excess water. Then, I peeled and cubed them and poured on the marinade/dressing while both were still warm. I added dill and green onions. It was good but I think it will taste better tomorrow!

This was very good. I didn't bother to peel the potatoes.  I boiled them In the chicken broth, that another reviewer suggested. I sprinkled in the celery seed that too. The family enjoyed this was a welcome change from my stand by tater salad. I scattered chopped green onions at the serving time.   Thank you Schoolbee yummy and willl make again.

I loved this recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I would recommend cutting back on the sugar by one-third.  Although I usually prefer things on the sweet side, it was too sweet.  The next time I will definately cut back on the sugar by at least one-third.  Also I highly recommend letting the salad sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to let the flavors gel.

Very easy recipe, I prepared it a day ahead, which I knew previously would meld the flavors together even better. I did use Yukon gold potatos, the regular russets are just too dry for my taste. Added less sugar and probably a little more vinegar, it was a huge party hit!!

This was excellent. I had to make this ahead of time, refrigerate it, then reheat it in the microwave. It tasted even better than serving it fresh! The flavors had a chance to meld together. I would make this again.

Many many years ago, while married to my ex-Husband who's step Mother came here with her Army Husband, from Germany, made this every time we came over to eat. Me being really really young (17), I had an attitude about "Mother-in-laws" & I would NOT admit that I liked her German Potato Salad, so, I never asked her for the recipe... To ANYTHING she made. How stupid I was. And here after 34 years, here is her recipe!! I was used to Miracle Whip, egg, mustard etc potato salad & I always hated potato salad. Her German Potato Salad took me a while to get used to, but I DID learn to love her GPS. Now, after all my years on "Allrecipes" is the GPS My ex-Mother-in-law made. I am going to make this & take it to her house & say "Thank you" for all the patients she used with my stupid arse!! She really was good to me, in spite of my nasty attitude. Thank you for posting this.

I rated this a 3 because my husband did not like his at all--so I ate the rest of his. I would probably rate it a 4 or 5 after I reduced the vinegar by about half. Also, I'd stir all the bacon bits in. 
This definitely did not take 50 min. start to finish; it took me more like 30 min. including peeling and dicing potatoes. Perhaps the reason was that I was cooking the potatoes and bacon at the same time and also cooked chopped bacon, which reduces the amount of time needed to cook the bacon.

Boil the potatoes in the jacket the night before, they will taste better and one can slice them (not cubed), add a little ground carawayseeds and mustard to your seasoning of p.-salad, you come closer to a authentic German potatoe salad.

WOW! i haven't been back to germany since '69..tried a lot of german potato salad recipes,,,cooked this one and tasted it in the skillet and said "WOW", that was the taste I remembered...already my wife's favorite potato salad of any kind...thank you. Those of you that don't think this is authentic are missing the point that Germany has many regions like the US and and each region will put their own twist on most recipes. This to me is the most authentic German food I have tasted in 45 yrs.

Very good. I omitted the bacon and used vegetable oil instead. I baked the potatoes whole then cooled before peeling and the skin peels right off. I cool completely then cut into small cubes. Refrigerate everything together over night for best results.

Rated this as per the ingredients listed. I love hot German potato salad but this recipe misses the mark. I do not think Hot German potato salad is supposed to be sweet. Use only 1 teaspoon of the sugar, don't peel the potatoes, cut up the potatoes after they have been boiled with leaving some of the skins on, add some celery seed and this recipe would be okay.

I grew up eating this. When I make this I add fresh celery & onions which I saute in bacon grease after I fry off the bacon. I also add diced hard boiled eggs, and I use apple cider vinegar. A really wonderful dish, which leaves an empty dish every time.

This was very tasty. I followed the recipe as written, using red skinned potatoes, and it came out great. It had a nice, tangy sweet-and-sour taste to it. The potatoes had a pleasant texture, soft but not falling apart. I would like to point out to those arguing over the "authenticity" of this recipe that there is more than one type of potato salad made in Germany. It depends on the region of the country and the personal taste of the cook. In northern Germany, for example, you're more likely to come across a mayonnaise based potato salad, like the ones served in the United States.

I had the ingrediants pretty much correct, but the process here is better than mine. Loved it !

I loved it.  My kids even ate it all up.  I cooked the potatoes whole then cut them up (that's how I originally learned the salad).  I also added a tablespoon of capers - they round out the flavor nicely.

I thought it was a bit dry. I am a native German and it worked well with my other German dishes. It might have been the kind of potato I used.

I was asked to bring German potato salad for a work an Oktoberfest work function. I'd not made it before but this one looked easy and sounded good. Well, I made 15 pounds of it by recalculating ingredients, etc. and it was completely gone and everyone loved it. I had 23 emails this morning asking for the recipe. Truly a delicious potato dish. Thanks allrecipes.com!!

This is the best hot German potato salad we have ever eaten! I do make a few variations. I use either white or gold small new potatoes, leave the skins on, and quarter them before boiling.  As others have said, I double the sauce.  I also add @ a quarter cup of cream (or sour cream, if I don't have cream in fridge).  The cream cuts the strong vinegar smell and makes a really nice, creamy sauce.  Delicious!!

Really good! I used russet potatoes since that's what I had on hand, but I really should have used red potatoes since they keep their shape better. I divided the salt and added 1/2 tsp. salt to the water to boil the potatoes in and 1/2 tsp. salt for the sauce. I think this really helped to not make the potatoes too bland.

Absolutely the MOST delicious hot German Potato Salad we've ever eaten.  I increased the recipe by 10 for an Oktoberfest/housewarming party.  Had to do most of the assembly in a large foil pan and pour the dressing over top prior to baking.  It still turned out delicious.

Just made it. This recipe is delicious! It's going to become my second or third most favorite way to prepare potatoes! I modified it slightly by using vegetarian bacon and it still turned out very tasty. The only thing you have to be careful about is not to overcook the potatoes. Mine were slightly overcooked and about 30% of them turned into mush. This mush though was still extremely delicious. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the amount of sugar called for in this recipe was perfect, and not too sweet, and this is coming from someone who does not have a sweet tooth. Enjoy this recipe and make sure you don't overboil the potatoes!

Very good! I liked this better than trying to peel cooked potatoes and cut them up. This is easier. I only used 2 Tb of sugar and 3/4 tsp salt. I would use only about 1/2 tsp salt next time. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used green onions instead for color. Served this with Hungarian brats and sweet and sour slaw.

The addition of celery seed, or celery salt, as another poster suggested, does give it some added flavor. I've been making it for several years and I've always added chopped or thinly sliced green pepper along with the onion. (I usually blanch the pepper separately). 

I've never tried using the sauce with spinach, as was suggested in another review, but will definitely do so from now on. Sounds perfect for that and might even try it on cauliflower as there is a recipe for cauliflower salad that uses bacon, mayo, parmesan cheese and the sauce from the potato salad might give it a whole new 'twist.'

Wonderful recipe! Made it exactly as stated & it was great. I have used another microwave version for years, but this one is much better...and easier strangely! This is one of my hubbies fav sides & he liked it as well. Thank you!

Very tasty!  I thought it was a little greasy so maybe next time I'll broil my bacon and fry the onions in a little olive oil.  Other than that it was very good!

i just made this and the only thing i changed was the amount of sugar. i erred on the side of caution and only used 2 tbsp of sugar and it was still too sweet. my suggestion would be to make the sauce without the sugar and add the sugar to your liking

OMG Im not that great of a cook, it was easy and tasted like it could be served at a restaurant.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  You are right about there being no leftovers and I made almost double the amount called for.  This is staying on the menu for good!

This recipe is extremely similar in taste to a well-known German restaurant in the area owned and run by older German immigrants.  To make this recipe more like the restaurant's, I boiled about 3.5 lbs. unpeeled red potatoes until tender.  Drained them, rinsed in cold water, and added ice cubes to the colander to speed the cooling process.  When cool, I sliced them (not thin).  I doubled the dressing ingredients, but only used 2 tbsp. of sugar...my husband and I thought it still tasted too sweet, so next time I will try just 1 tbsp. (even with doubling the dressing ingredients.)  I also didn't add parsley.  We had enough for two meals, and the potatoes tasted just as good the next night re-heated in the microwave.

This is excellent - our entire family enjoyed it!  I've made it twice in the last week, and my daughter asked me to make it again to take along camping this weekend.  A HUGE timesaver I found is using two 15 oz. cans of potatoes.  I drain them, then slice them in my food processor and follow the rest of the recipe as written. I bet it easily cuts the prep time in half!  Great recipe!

this potato salad tasted amazing. I used a suggestion from another reviewer and used just a little olive oil and some Jarred real bacon pieces, but it still turned out fantastic. 
My husband didnt like that it was warm, but he ate every bit of it for leftovers straight from the fridge. 
I am Very impressed with this simple recipe.

I used organic red potatoes and didn't peel them first - just scrubbed them down and boiled them. For the bacon I used vegan fakin bacon and cooked the onions in olive oil.  It actually came together quite nicely as a vegan German potato salad!

Taste was wonderful but I used a waxy, red potato (skin on) that just didn't soak up the sauce.  Next time I will use a russet cooked in the skin then pealed.  I think the texture will be better.

This was good, but I had to fuss with it a bit to get the flavor where I wanted it--added course mustard and green onion and some beef soup base to the dressing.  I don't know what's authentic, but the end result was very tasty.

I made this recipe just cause my wife picked it out for a family reunion, which had a German theme and several 'real' German relatives in attendance. Out of the Germ. pot. salads present, this one was by far the attendees favorite (as opposed to seeing me in liederhosen, which was apparently disturbing). I was puzzled by the dicing of potatoes, rather than having slices as I remembered as a kid, but everyone liked it in that form fine.

My husband and son love potatoes, but hate traditional potato salad with mayo. This was a huge hit for them. Luckily I made a double batch! Note: Red potatoes are a great short cut since you don't need to peel them, plus they add nice color to the dish!

Maybe it's my German blood, but I just loved this salad.  I've made it a couple of times now and it has been a hit every time!  It is a little liquidy, so I've let it reduce a little in the skillet.  I've also used a combination of apple cider vinegar/white vinegar for a little more flavor.  And you can never go wrong with more bacon!  If you make it, increase the servings and make it for a crowd.  Also good reheated.

I'm normally not a big fan of potato salad, but this is my favorite one.

Very tasty!  I use 1/3 cup of vinegar instead of 1/4 since we like it a little more vinegar-ier.  Also, if you want it softer/slight mushier, use white potatoes.  If you like the potatoes to be a little less mushy, use red potatoes.

Oh, my. . .this was delicious.  I had only tried German Potato Salad once and it was from a can.  The taste was okay, but I didn't care for the canned potatoes.  Making this from scratch was super easy and the taste was wonderful.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.  I will be making it often.

This was sorta of tough to make since I prefer quick salads. I thought of it more as a picnic type food but didn't realize until after I made it that it was intended to be served warm. It was a bit dry and tasted a lot better reheated and eaten as a leftover. I won't make this salad again.

I want to thank you for the first "authentic" German Potato salad like mom used to make. The only addition would be to after the bacon and onions are fried, abut a cup of water is added to the pan and brought to a boil. Then about 2 heaping tablespoons of corn starch are mixed into about 1/4 cup of water. After bringing bacon, onion, and water to boil, add corn starch mix slowly, while stirring all the time. When thick enough add potatoes and let them get hot. The result is a sauce that is heavenly. That is my mom's authentic German Potato Salad. Try it. You'll love it.

I cut back on the amount of sugar.  I was doubling the recipe, but stopped at 5 T sugar (instead of 6).  It is still too sweet.   I would not make this recipe again.

My husband challenged me to make a German potato salad that could compare to his grandmother's. I made this, and he said it definitely compares, and that if she were still living, she'd have enjoyed it as much as he did.

I have made this a number of times and always get compliments and requests for seconds!  Usually I increase the recipe for 6 as we love leftovers (actually I think it tastes even better heated up the next day)  -- I use the exact recipe except I usually fry up extra bacon -- (can anything have too much bacon?)

Very, very good.  Just like my German Mom used to make, although she would cook the potatoes in their "jackets" then roughly peel/dice them into the bacon/vinegar sauce, plus I think she added some caraway.   THANK YOU for bringing back a beloved childhood recipe I was having a hard time re-creating.  Delicious!

I have made this recipe several times for potlucks and group dinner events... Sometimes I add in other sautéed veggies - mushrooms, celery, carrots, etc. It's all good! I don't eat meat, so I leave the bacon out. This dish is seriously easy to make and very seriously delicious. I love that it doesn't use the heavy mayo in other potato recipes. I sub dried parsley, and it tastes just fine.

Very easy to make! I cut up the bacon before I fry it seems faster to me. Good flavor and not too wet.

Fantastic!  I've made this three times now and I have enjoyed it each time.  Using a red onion adds color.  To cut calories, sugar and salt, I prefer to use one TBLS prepared bacon bits (sauteed), 1.5 TBSP sugar, and no extra salt. I used parsley twice, and the third time green onions.  Delicious both ways.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I cut back the sugar...added green scallions at the end with the bacon. I don't like peeled potatoes, this potato salad is supposed to be quick and rustic. I even cooked my potatoes in the microwave (stab them with a knife). The same taste as my oma always made.

I made this recipe exactly from the directions.  I have never tasted nor made German Potato Salad before.  This was delicious.  I made for Thanksgiving.  This is a definite addition to my collection.  Simply delicious.  I bet it would make delicious mashed potatoes.

Yummy! Now I don't have to go spend $100 to satisfy my German food cravings! I can make the red cabbage and this potato salad and we will be even more happy for under $20! The best part about cooking at home is not having to get ready!

Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy!!! This was superb.  I didn't even notice that sugar was part of the recipe until after I started.  I was skeptical at first but the sweetness was my fave part.  Superb.  Didn't change a thing.  (Except I didn't have white vinegar, only Cider vinegar.  Came out wonderful nonetheless.)

I grew up on a slighly different version of german potato salad and this new verison is better.  The sugar adds a little sweetness that works great.  I could not stop eating this.....the only thing is it is much 'wetter' than what I expected.  It did not look great but tasted amazing.  I am going to boil up a few extra potatos and add them in.

Would like to give this four and a half stars but  no half star available. The only thing that kept this from being perfect in my opinion is that it is too sweet. I ended up making another half batch of the dressing without sugar and blended that in. Delicious, we all enjoyed this and I will certainly make this again!

A little too sweet for me but my wife and kid like it. I may try using Stevia sweetener next time in order to trim the calories.  If not serving immediately, do not add any of  the crumbled bacon -- hold it until actual serving -- it gets soft. I may try permanently holding it -- serve on the aide as a "server yourself' condiment.  This way, the leftovers aren't filled with soggy bacon.

This is a great recipe!  I just made a few changes.  I used less sugar, I dressed the potatoes mere seconds before serving, and I  used extra bacon.  It came out great everyone loved it!  No one missed the mayo!  I do rec. you dress right before serving and make sure the potatoes are nice and warm so they soak up all the flavor!

I'm not sure how authentic this was. German potato salad cubed? This recipe was too sweet. The true version has more balanced tart/sweet taste as well as a creamier texture....this was way to dry. Not much flavor either. I have a rule of never deviating from the original recipe, but this one needs a lot of changes. Will look elsewhere for an authentic version.

My whole family loved this potato salad... even my picky son who won't eat traditional potato salad! I did change a few things. I used about half the sugar, added celery with the onions and used a bit more bacon. It was fabulous!!!

We didn't care for this at all, it was so sweet it was like syrup on the potatoes.  We love eggless potato salads, but this just wasn't for us.  I might make it again using a much smaller amount of sugar.

I tripled everything which equated to a pound of bacon (used thick cut) and a bag of potatos.  Used yellow gold potatos. Excellent. Was enough to feed a large crowd.  I also made hours in advance and just warmed in oven slightly before serving.

The salad was very good.  I gave it four stars because I didn't feel there was enough sauce and it was a tad too sweet.  I will definitely make it again, but I will double the sauce and use less sugar.

I am anything but big on potato salad, but it is my fiance's favourite. So, we decided to try this, although we both thought that a potato salad without mayo would be weird. So wrong! It knocked our socks off! Now, I have changed my mind about potato salad, and my fiance even said that it was better than his mother's, which was an all-time favourite of his! The only change I made was to double the bacon, and saute with the onions instead of frying it, because we really don't like hard, crunchy bacon.

Awesome!  The only thing I could suggest would be to add a bit of flour to the bacon drippings (before adding the water and vinegar) to thicken it up a bit.  I left the skins on (used red potatoes), saves on prep work and makes it more colorful.  My husband loved it!

Good, be careful not to overcook your potatoes.  My mom always sliced them thin, rather than cubing or dicing them. And don't accidently dump out the bacon grease before reading the rest of the recipe.

I just made this recipes for an "Oktoberfest" pot luck we're going to tonight... I quadrupled it and it tastes delicious.  I actually put it in a crock pot so it stays warm. yummm  OK.. the recipe was a HIT!  I used red skinned potatoes and kept the skins on.  I think I MIGHT reduce the sugar just a bit next time.  It was delicious.  Got recipe request.  The crock pot idea worked great... it stayed hot for the whole part, but didn't turn to mush.  A big Hit indeed!

yummy!  I brought this to a friend's BBQ and everyone kept talking about how good it was, and insisted that I would be bringing it again!!!  I actually doubled the recipe, but accidentally peeled 8 cups worth of potatoes.  I doubled the other ingredients exactly and added a little extra bacon as well.  It was so good and pretty!!!

This is so delicious! A sweet and sour type hot potato salad. Leftovers disappear quickly too. This is my stepson's favorite. (Well, mine too)  I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. Very easy to do, usually all ingredients on hand, definitely a keeper.

So easy and delicious, thank you!  The only thing I did differently was cut back the sugar to 1/2 tbsp. and used the microwaveable bacon...sauteed the onions in olive oil.  Thanks again for sharing your delicious recipe!

we thought this recipe was pretty tasty with just the right amount of tang. i omitted adding the teaspoon of salt since the bacon & grease are loaded with it. i also used dried parsley flakes instead of the fresh variety (what i had on hand). try making this a day ahead of time so the flavors come together then warm it in the microwave. thanks schoolbee!

I love this recipe! Just made it, even though I have to let it "set", the flavor now is perfect! (I added a green bell pepper, I wanted color & didn't have parsley, I used LESS than a TBSP of sugar, as I don't like sweet, & I used a good amount of dried oregano in place of parsley, added the seasonings while sautéing onion & pepper )...can't wait to try it several hours from now!

I made this recipe with just a few alterations to serve with Root Beer Pulled Pork Sliders. First of all, anything that has bacon in it is likely to be delicious! Upon sautéing the onions in the rendered bacon fat, I sprinkled white pepper, paprika, and ground garlic pepper seasoning onto them. When it came time to add the vinegar I opted for White Champagne Vinegar (mainly because I rarely use it.) I also added a cube of chicken bouillon to the vinegar/water mixture and took previous reviewers suggestions to scale the sugar down to 1 tablespoon.

I believe this recipe would be wonderful as written, but thoroughly enjoyed my variation upon it!

Great recipe! And best: no flour in the dressing. So many recipes call for flour which is unnecessary because the starch from the potatoes thickens the dressing. I do add two cut up hard-boiled eggs per my German husband.

I found this recipe to be not only delicious but I found it to be as authentic as any other's I have made from other respected cook books, (such as the Joy of Cooking, for example).
I have never heard of a recipe for GPS where one leaves the skin on!  And I enjoy 'potato skins in many different ways!!
My Mother -in Law made one of the BEST GPS I have ever enjoyed and she always peeled her potatos.  My Mother in Law is Italian and I dare anyone to find fault with her totally authentic GPS Recipe.  Thank you!

Having never tried German Potato Salad. I quite liked it. I new there was a potato salad that was with a vinagrette dressing. Instead of Mayo and eggs. I was surprised to find this was a warm salad. I prepared it almost to the letter, but I only had a few sugar cubes in the house so I used six of them which I think is equal to about 2 tbsp instead of 3. The recipe didn't say what kind of potatoes to use. I used Russets. I think it needs a firmer potato. I look forward to trying this one again. ( I have tried this again using mini red potatoes, quartered with skin on. Prepared exactly per the recipe and this is now a staple dish in my house)

This recipe was excellent, after a couple of tweaks.  It's an excellent starting point for getting it more to your preferred flavors (more vinegar, less vinegar, sweeter...etc.)  

The first time I made it, I doubled the recipe and it ended up tasting like pure vinegar.  Some people actually loved it...I love vinegar, but could not even eat it.

The second time I made a single batch of it, I used 3 tbsp cider vinegar and 1 tbsp white vinegar, instead of 1/4 cup white vinegar (just to take a little of the bite out), 2 tbsp sugar, instead of 3, 2 tsp salt, added 1/4 tsp celery seed, boiled 9 smallish/medium red potatoes whole, then sliced them, leaving some of the skins on.  Also, use 3/4 cup chicken broth, instead of 2 tbsp water.  Oh, yeah...and A LOT more bacon, 4 strips of bacon is for sissies! lol  

Anyway, after the modifications I listed above, this was an AWESOME potato salad!  The family could not get enough of it!

I've made something like this for years.  I fry up a lot more bacon and use balsamic vinegar ( light or dark, slightly sweet version).  I also agree that it needs some celery seed.  Friends from out-of-state are heart-broken if I don't have this when they arrive.  We fry it after it's made.

Liked it with the following additions: Added 1/2 cup (used light) Mayo, 2 T. of Dijon mustard and Celery Seed. Also, don't be tempted to drain off the bacon grease. It's key to this dish. (Just don't eat it too often!) Really good.

Absolutely a Great Recipe!!! Have made it multiple times and is always a hit - for bbqs everyone compliments it....when I ask what I can bring mom always says, "how about that German Potato Salad you make" ;) Leftovers taste great...my best friend can eat an entire bowl as a main course for dinner.  The only thing I did differently was to leave the skins on the potato - 1)It still tastes great 2)Saves mad time peeling potatoes 3)Adds nice color to the dish. Yayyy!!!

My husband made this while I was at work.  He couldn't find the white vinegar so used Rice Vinegar instead. Later he added a little white vinegar, a little more sugar.  I think it was delicious.  He took it to a Hunters potluck...it was a hit.

This is a great version of German Patato Salad...... I made it yesterday with Schniztel and let me tell ya, it didn't last long at all. It was really easy to make but even better to eat! I wanted more but I have to wait another day to make it again. I totally hope that whomever wants to try this to do it.....DELICIOUS and definitely one of my favorite recipes to put in my menu box!

This was delicious whether totally authentic or not.  I like this much better than other German potato salads I have tasted.  My mother is all German and she likes this better than what she used to make.

This is a great potato salad if you are looking for a change from mayo based recipes. Based on the recommendations of other users, I decreased sugar to 2 tbsps and poured the sauce over the potatoes.  I also subbed with turkey bacon and cider vinegar and left the peels on the red potaotes. Next time, I will double the sauce.

This is a nice salad.  It isn't quite as tangy as I prefer and a bit more sauce would have been nice.  But, overall a good recipe.

This is one of my favorite reipes I have cooked! SOOOO DELISH! Not difficult and so close to the real deal you won't be able to tell the difference! If I ever make another German feast, as I did last night, this will be at the top of my list! I will even be incooperating this into my American dishes! LOVED IT!

Although good, German's don't put sugar and most don't add bacon - we add Speck - which is still pork, but not so flat (especially here in Stuttgart). But it's a good Kartoffelsalat.

Very much like my grandmother's recipe.  She added  a tablespoon of flour to the fat after cooking the onions to make a thin roux.  This gives the sauce a more gravy-like texture.

This is a fantastic side dish! Full of flavor and great texture. I cut back on the sugar just a bit - 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3. I also added 1 teaspoon of celery seeds and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. The recipe, as is, is great though.

Thanks, Schoolbee!  I was looking for an authentic recipe, and I got one by tweaking this.  First, I made it as is, but it was way too sweet.  I eliminated all but a bare teaspoon of sugar.  Second, I substituted dill for parsley, partly because that's how I remember it from my childhood, partly because I don't like parsley.  It was a big hit (you're right, no leftovers).  Now I want to try the recommendation of using the same sauce for wilted greens (and perhaps also red cabbage and Brussels sprouts).

This was soo yummy. I made this along with red cabbage and Rouladen  and it was all great! The origional serving is quite small so I would suggest doubling it as I did. I didnt quite have enough bacon to fully double, and it was still delish, although I wish i had more bacon!

I made this on mass for a church fellowship and it was devoured! I think I'd go a little lighter on the vinegar next time only because I would have been able to eat more if it had bitten me back a little less.  :)

Great recipe! Quick, easy and delicious. I took some advice and made extra sauce, the potatos soaked it all up. I also added more pepper (1/2 t.), I added caraway seed (1/4 t.) and I didn't have fresh parsley so I added dry parsley (1 t.). I can't wait to make this again!!

I really didn't care for this. It was really quite bland with no depth to what flavor it did have and tasted nothing like my favorite German restaurants recipe. I'll keep looking for a good german potato salad to serve on our german family nights.

Just the recipe I was looking for! I skipped a couple steps to make it more quickly: I sliced the bacon before I cooked it (with the onions, not separately) in the bottom of a large pot. Then I just added the rest of the dressing ingredients to the pot, brought it to a boil, and tossed the potatoes in. Great! Thanks!

Totally fabulous. LOVED it and so did everyone at our dinner party. Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't peel the potatoes and I used a few more slices of bacon. It rocked and I'll definitely be making this again. Thank you!

I've never made German Potato Salad in my life but, I was asked to bring some to a family gathering and this was the easiest recipe I found on AllRecipes---what a hit!! Everyone raved about it, two people asked for the recipe and it was all gone by the end of the party!  The only change I made (to cut down on fat) was using Turkey Bacon -- but, since Turkey Bacon doesn't throw off any fat, I used about 2 TBSPs of canola oil to fry the bacon in and then had enough left to saute the onions.  It was great!  I might also cut down on the sugar just a tad the next time.

This hit the spot.  It's not my grandmother's, but close.  I will slice my potatoes next time.  Very easy.  I used half of a large red onion and half of a large sweet white.

I thought this was very good. My husband and kids did not as they are used to the typical sugar/vinegar/mayo dressing. We are German but grew up with the PA Dutch version. I would make this again for a pot luck.

I made this tonight with sliced red potatoes - and used a medium sized shallot instead of onion. It was FABULOUS! My husband appreciated it very much. I will be making this again - and even for company or potluck. It was very easy as well. Thank you for this great recipe that will be in my family for years to come.

Very good potato salad!! The only thing I did different was I added some hard boiled eggs. Made this salad for a picnic and since there was no mayonaise, it really held up well. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was great, although my husband didn't enjoy it as much as I did!  I added a tad more vinegar to give it more "twang" and used red potatoes.  Very good and I will make it again!

I have used this recipe quite a few times. Kind of hard to mess up, but just in case you over cook the potatoes you can still salvage the dish. (Idea from a co-worker when they over cooked). If the potatoes are too mushy, go ahead and mash them into the mix like you would with mashed potatoes. Add some sour cream and then sprinkle the parsley on top.  You end up with a giant baked potato.  Otherwise, I just cut down the sugar on the mix a little bit and follow the recipe.

This was an easy and tasty recipe, however it wasn't exactly what I was hoping to find. My husband's grandfather was German and I am trying to find a recipe like what he made. This one wasn't as tangy and I was hoping for.

We both loved this potato salad! My husband has always enjoyed the typical, creamy, mayo style potato salad served cold and also loves potatoes in general.  After noticing this well rated recipe, I decided to give something different a try.  I didn't change a thing, using amounts exactly as recipe stated (something I rarely do!)and it was perfect. Flavors were excellent (plus healthier without all that mayo).  Served the salad warm. 
Have already made this salad again and made a double recipe so I'd have leftovers ..which were also excellent.
It's great to find a new way to serve potatoes.  How could something so simple be so delicious?!!

EXCELLENT! This is a must try recipe for all. Goes great with wurst, but will also make a nice side for any meal. Sliced potatoes instead of dicing, and made the night before, then reheated... came out great.

My husband is from German descent, and I am always trying to find recipes that remind him of his childhood.  I had never made German potato salad before because I could never find a recipe that didn't call for mustard, (my husband is deathly allergic).  This recipe not only brought back memories of his great-grandmother's recipe, but introduced my stepdaughter to authentic German foods.  Thank you so much for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe, I can't wait to make it again.

I gave this three stars, because I liked it, but everyone else thought "it was just okay" and didn't go back for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly, but it's just not as good as some of our German restaurants here. I used white wine vinegar, so maybe next time I'll use cider vinegar. Perhaps that was the problem. Better luck next time...

I was worried about trying this recipe.  I will not eat prepared potato salad and normally only like it when it's warm.  I loved this recipe and actually preferred it cold over warm. The second time I made this, I roasted red potatoes and it was even better!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was perfect!  Not too much bacon and not too much vinegar. The flavors were so evenly distributed. We couldn’t get enough of it! A nice alternative to potato salad when you don’t want mayo.

This is great stuff. Made it for the wife's family and everyone loved it. I enjoyed reading reviews. If you live in Germany shouldn't you refer to living "here" instead of saying "there".lol

This tastes pretty close to my grandmothers recipe...the only thing I did differently was to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch and water...the sauce my nanny made was thick and that’s what we like. Really good otherwise! I’ll definitely keep this recipe!

I have never seen any German I know use sugar in their potato salad although the German diet is pretty diverse. My papa is from East Prussia and my mom is also Prussian but from the Ruhr.  My mom generally made the normal potato salad with eggs, pickles, red potatoes, spring onions (or cooking onions if necessary and homemade mayo with a dash of paprika. But even if she ventured to make Bavarian potato salad she never used sugar.  I am leaving it out next time!  It was too sweet.   I also use red potatoes and although my mother peeled everything I seldom peel my potatoes.

Way too much sugar.  My mother is German and I grew up eating potato salad similar to this recipe.  I made this the first time as-written.  The second time I modified as follows:  Peel and cook the potatoes whole.  Then cool and slice.  
 Use apple cider vinegar.  Decrease the sugar to 1/2 tablespoon and add 1 tsp beef bouillon and 1/2 cup of water.  I also added an extra splash of vinegar at the end to up the sour flavor.  With these mods it's perfect for my taste and might be better than Mom's!

Saw this because I was looking for a potato salad without eggs (had to make it without onions too because someone else was allergic to onions).  Took to a potluck and it was raved over.  Good stuff!

6.10.17  I have a German potato salad recipe that has been published on this site, but I must admit this certainly measured up to what I've been making for many, many years.  Served this with some sweet and sour red cabbage and grilled nurnberger sausages bought from a German meat market in Sarasota, FL.  I knew the warm potatoes would soak up the dressing, so I did increase that by by 50% (didn't want dry potato salad).  Very good recipe.

I had already boiled some small potatoes and sliced them. Last minute made this dish for a potluck and doubled the recipe. I live in Germany and this is an authentic taste for sure.

I  quadrupled this recipe and it turned out great. It was a full pound of bacon and it took a while to get the onions brown. I used parsley and  cilantro and added extra. If you are taking it to a party add the last bacon and parsley right before serving because it just looks more fresh. . Everyone was raving about it at the Octoberfest party and a few asked for the recipe. I was so proud.

Excellent!  I used apple cider vinegar which isn't as tart as white vinegar so the salad was a bit sweeter than I expected.  Will cut back to 2 T sugar next (if using apple cider vinegar)

This is the first time I have made this dish. I have had it several times and new what I was looking for in flavor and texture. This recipe hit right on the bull's eye. this is one recipe I will keeping in my cabinet. Thanks the whole family loved it!
Also this recipe is proportional so it's very easy to scale. I recommend scaling off of how much bacon you use to make the recipe.  The bacon and potatoes are directly proportional.

I made this recipe for the first time last week and it's a keeper. This is the only way I will be making potato salad. Don't like eggs or mayo in my potato salad. Five stars from me and my family.

I made this for the 4th of July and everyone loved it.  One of our boys won't do mayo in anything so German Potato Salads are the only kind he will eat.  I did use cider vinegar and cilantro as that's what I had on hand.  I will be making this again as my "go to" potato salad recipe. Thanks for a keeper!

I have made this salad several times and it is always a hit.  it has become my go-to recipe for summer cookouts and parties. Last year I made it for my boyfriend's family Father Day picnic and everyone liked it. This year, they requested I bring it again.  Thank you very much for sharing it.  This one is a keeper.

So good the way it is, but my family loves bacon so I add 6 slices (I'm a vegetarian and make this for my husband and son because every carnivore needs this in their life) and my mom(who makes this and will not share her recipe)told me celery seed is the secret to good potato salad so I throw it in there too.

I have made this several times over the last few years, great recipe! Have made a few modifications. First of all, I slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds instead of dicing and cook about five minutes after the water starts to boil. I also double the sauce ingredients (vinegar through black pepper) and add a 1/4t of celery seed and 2T flour. If you like German potato salad, or have never had it but want to try it, this is the recipe for you! Goes great with grilled brats, pork chops or schnitzel .

I've never made this before but it was easy and turned out great! I happened to make bacon for breakfast and saved the drippings , so that was one less step I had to do later.  I followed the recipe exactly, and just when it seemed a little too watery it just thickened right up! I would definitely make this again, but probably a double batch next time!

This recipe is excellent.  I made a few small adjustments, but it's just a matter of taste. I lowered the sugar and raised the vinegar by a little. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon each of paprika and dill weed, and an 1/8 teaspoon powdered mustard. These small adjustments are worth a try, trust me.

Delicious and very quick and easy. Used only 1 tablespoon of sugar and served with sautéed Weiss wurst and onions.  Definitely a keeper. Tasted as good as my Swiss mother would have made.

My husband doesn't like German potato salad, so I called it potatoes with bacon & onions. HE LOVED IT!!! I too loved it. This is most definitely a keeper. I had 2 hard boiled eggs in the fridge that I needed to use, so I chopped them and sprinkles them over the top of the salad...who doesn't like bacon & eggs!

Made it, loved it, will make it again. I used red potatoes and didn't bother to peel them since I like the taste, texture and color they add. Maybe next time I'll slice them instead of dice for more authenticity, will use about half the sugar and will add a bit of stone ground mustard as that's what they seem to do in German restaurants. Served with bratwurst, sauteed onions, cabbage, and shaved brussels sprouts, and of course mustard and fresh sauerkraut. A truly satisfying feast that I can't wait to make again.

This was delish!  I didn't use russets, but used Yukon golds. Next time russets - as they will absorb all the delishness. It was great tasting. Will do it again. The person who I made this for thought it was great.

Only thing I did different was double the recipe.  This was very good,  reminded me of my favorite German restaurant. Will definitely make again.

Authenticity is for historians and those who think it elevates them above the "uninformed". 
Food is about taste and other sensory satisfaction. This product is delicious and is based on at least one traditional German recipe. Even if not a single German recognized it, the dish would be just as good. Thanks for all the suggested mods! Can't wait to try them.

I had to tweak the recipe but me and my husband both loved it. I did not use so much sugar and added some mayo, it just needed something to me. The bacon adds a lot of course!

While the potatoes were a bit mushy the flavor was incredible. Next time I'll try a bit less than 10 minutes for the boil time. Either way, 5 stars for sure!

The recipe doesn't say what kind of potato to use. I used yellow boiled whole then peeled and diced when easy to handle. My onion was red but yellow would have been more flavorful. We've never had this before so we have nothing to compare it to. We loved it. Mine was over the top with just a very light sprinkle of dried thyme from my garden. ( Left out the salt and didn't miss it )

Absolutely looove this recipe! I've cooked this before and have had rave reviews from husband and guests/ friends.. Authentic or not? It's a hit! I lived in Germany for a few years, long enough to get a taste of their customs.. and I truly can't say whether it's authentic or not... While in Germany it was really good.. Living in the U.S.A. it's really good.. :-)

Found this after going to Hermann Mo and wanted to get some German style sides for home!  I follow exactly using baby red potatoes cut up in quarters.  I also use Apple Cider Vinegar since I think it's got a great flavor that works well with any meat main dishes.  The best batch I made was prepared in a cast iron pot and placed in a 200 degree oven for 30-45 minutes while the rest of the food finished cooking.  That little time in the oven put this over the top as all the flavors had a little more time to meld without overdoing the red potatoes. Also, being lazy, I dice the bacon up first and never pull it back out of the pan after it's crisp.

Quite easy to make and very good. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe very closely but cooking in bacon grease just scares me a bit too much. So now I just make it with olive oil. I add a little bit of the store bought bacon bits at the end though. When I made it exactly as written, it was good. My hubby liked it a lot, too but he likes it saucy so now I just add more sugar/vinegar mixture. No exact measurement(probably kinda like double or triple the recipe and then adjust a bit to my like). The result has been very good and I don't have to feel so bad since I don't cook in bacon grease.

Excellent recipe.  We did not peel the (red) potatoes.  Since the potatoes soak up the sauce, I will double the sauce next time which is more typical of a true German potato salad.  We also served it cold and it was great.

This was absolutely delicious!!!!  Possibly the most delicious potato salad I've ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly using russet potatoes.  My husband and kids loved it too.  Next time I might try doubling the sauce and using less sugar.  I will make this often!

This was a delicious potato salad! I like mayo, so I was on the hunt for a potato salad that didn't have a lot of mayo in it and a teaspoon of celery seed, it adds a nice texture...this is my favorite potato salad.

Yep, it's superb. Always the first potato salad to disappear at BBQs, the sloppy mayo ones have no chance against this one! As a vegetarian alternative you can add capers instead of the bacon. Only one tablespoon of sugar is necessary!

This is fantastic! My Nana used to add a few grated gherkins in to the salad instead of using the vinegar - as you get the vinegar taste from the pickles. This is one of my favourites and I have it either cold i the summer at BBQs or hot in the winter with some Bratwurst! :)

I made only a few small changes: I did not peel the potatoes, I scanted the sugar, used dried parsley and drained half the grease BEFORE sauteeing the onions then drained the excess, keeping only a small amount. The flavor of the dish was outstanding, not at all lacking because of those changes. This recipe is going to my top 10 favorite side dishes. Thank you for sharing, Schoolbee123.

I doubled the recipe. It was too much grease for me. But I never fry anything, so that was probably the issue with me. It was good but I am going to try something with flour next time. Thank you though!

Great potato salad! I doubled the recipe and made extra sauce. I probably made too much sauce but it tasted great. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again. Thank-you so much for posting :)

This is very similar to the recipe that my Grandmother Edna taught me.  She would "cut" up the bacon into bits with kitchen shears, and fry til brown with the onions.  To this she would add 2 tab of plain flour to make the rue and then add the sugar, salt, water and vinegar.  I leave out the pepper due to allergies, but substitue sweet basil in its place.  Once the "gravy" has thickened we pour it over the cooled taters and stir gently.  Sometimes we garnish with boiled egg slices, but like the recipe that's posted, ours doesn't last long either.  I've also used brown sugar when white wasn't available, worked out good too.

great potato salad..I usggest you  use less sugar, and more bacon, and cut the potato cubes a little larger size when cold and nuke'em for 1 min. 30 sec. in the  microwave (this prevents them from falling apart and cooks them thoroughly w/ no guess work)...all your guests will marvel how you got perfect cubes that were cooked thoroughly

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  I was hesitant about changing anything, because some reviews said too sweet while others said too sour.  The flavor is perfect!  Not too sweet, not too vinegary.  I'll definitely make it again but will add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  It is so delicious, and my husband and I loved it!

This is about as close as it gets to what I consider a real hot German Potato salad.  Years ago I had a recipe book with a similar recipe but it wanted you to add two medium soft boiled eggs.  The yolk would be just set.  I loved it with the bacon and potatoes.

This was a good recipe, easy to make.  Not as vinegary as other German Potato Salad, and a bit sweet, so I would adjust those a little.  Probably 2 Tablespoons sugar is enough.  Would make it again!

This was my first time ever making German Potatoe Salad. My granddaughter had requested it for her high school graduation party but I didn't have time to make it. We had a special dinner for her tonight before she leaves for college in a few days. She loved it and took home the left overs. I will make this again.

Very good. Grandma used apple cider,also add 3 hard boiled eggs. let mixture set and cool. that allows juices to gel and stick to potatoes. thanks for reminding me how good homemade really is.

Awesome potato salad! And my picky husband, who never loves any new recipe I find, loved it too! I've made it for multiple gatherings and everyone wants the recipe. It has simple ingredients that are very easy to double or triple, depending on how many people you are serving. This is definitely going into the family recipe book!

this recipe is very similar to my mother's and it was always a big hit with the family, at home and at larger family gatherings in summer and fall. She didn't use parsley, but I don't think she cared for it, or maybe she thought all the kids wouldn't eat it. And she probably used cider vinegar, simply because that was what she kept a good supply of for other salads.

I don't really like potato salad from the store, but am sharing lunches with a gluten free friend.  This looked decent, but tasted great and calorie count was quite good.

Just like my mom used to make- delicious!  I doubled the sauce recipe as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, used white wine vinegar because I was out of regular.  A great alternative to regular potato salad!  My family LOVED it!

Never made German potato salad, but had eaten plenty of it. I tried this and it was very good, but like most reviews I will cut down on the sugar a bit for the next time. For a moment I felt like I was in Germany. Thanks!

Great for gluten and dairy free crowds-delicious! I didn't use the full bacon and it was fine.
A bit time consuming though.

Has anyone made this with skins on for more nutrition?

This was absolutely perfect.  The only change was adding a little celery seed, and about a sprinkle of flour to thicken it.  I used tiny new potatoes unpeeled, and cut them in half after they were tender.  Even hubby, who is picky about his German Potato Salad, really loved this.

I made it today and have had German Potato Salad in Germany and my Grandmothers when I was a little girl and like many recipes, there are many versions for various tastes!  This recipe is delicious - not too sweet - not too tart!  Perfect!   (I did add a little celery seed)

this is a awesome sidedish! I have never had german potato salad, so wasn't sure what to expect, but wanted a different potato dish for dinner... I followed the recipe exactly, have made it numerous times now it is a family fav.. I boil the potatoes with the skin on, then let them sit on the counter to cool. when they are cool enough to touch, I peel the skins off.. I definitely use *more* bacon! the vinegar/water ratio is perfect. these also make amazing hashbrowns for breakfast the next day, just throw them in the frying pan with a tsp of coconut oil/olive oil and some ore fresh herbs. a keeper!

I use Splenda and it works well, we don't miss the sugar at all. I also use bacon ends/pieces, and I don't remove from pan when cooking the onions as we prefer the bacon dispersed in the salad. I also added that mixture to the big pot of potatoes as I was tripling the recipe and my skillet isn't big enough to fit them all. This recipe is much better than any I've had at the typical "German" restaurant I've been to (in the States). My family who lived in Germany for a few years all gave this 5 stars as well! It's so good I now bring it to potlucks, as people request it.

Very good version. I miss placed my recipe that a German friend gave me during my recent move and this recipe had similar ingredients.  I purchased the ingredients before I discovered my recipe was missing, so I used 5 lbs. Yukon gold potatoes and white wine vinegar. I cooked the potatoes  whole,  peeled them after they cooled and cut them into slices. For the first time I also used turkey bacon (12 oz.package).  The turkey bacon was slightly less crisp than the real stuff but did not affect the flavor. My recipe didn't cook the onion and I really liked the flavor it added. I had to add a a little canola oil to saute the onion, since there was not enough fat in the pan from the turkey bacon. For 5 lbs. potatoes I tripled all of the ingredients except sugar, and used a whole cup of water.

On a separate note my German  friend always told me the amount of water you add varies depending on the potatoes, how done they are, etc. Her advice was to start with 1 cup H20 for 5 lbs, potatoes.  

For a fast version you can microwave store bought bacon bits (real bacon.. not imitation bacon bits) The microwave gets the bacon crispy. I have does this in the past and it works great next time I make the quick version I will toss the onion in before microwaving. There is enough fat in the bacon bits to cook the onion.

Everyone loves when I make this dish! My grandfather (who has been a professional chef longer than I have been alive) even told me it was DIVINE! I do cut back a bit on the sugar, and add a bit more vinegar, but I couldn't tell you the amounts. I have made this so many times, I can just eyeball it now. Don't hesitate to give this a try!

My husband made this two days ago and it was so delicious that we each ate several servings. He made it for 8 and the two of us ate half of it!  That is testimony for how good it was.  We had it with brats and sauerkraut.  I felt like I was at German Village in Columbus, Ohio once again.  If you like German potato salad, I guarantee that you will like this recipe.  As another reviewer said, "Wunderbar!".

Delicious, I leave out the bacon and use apple cider vinegar but otherwise the same. It's just a lovely potato dish  that I know I'll be making over and over.

Perfect side dish for any occasion!  I make this for all the family cookouts and dinners and it's always a big hit, rarely ever leftovers!  The one thing I changed though is I add about a teaspoon and a half of minced garlic (the kind in the glass jar) to the potatoes while they're boiling.  It gives it a great flavor!

This is easy and delicious.  I cooked an entire packet of bacon, planning to incorporate the four slices called for and to use the rest for BLT's, but my husband added some of the additional bacon to the potato salad and called it dinner!

This is an excellent recipe! I never have been to Germany but it tastes better than the local German restaurant. Followed the directions except for I added an extra slice of bacon. Tasted great! Serving size was about right for my husband and I with a little leftover. I'd say it would be perfect for 3 alongside a meal.

To the people that say this is not "authentic" german, I beg to differ. It may not be authentic german from the area of Germany you are in, but that doesn't mean it's not an authentic regional dish. I lived in Germany, and this is the way we enjoyed it in the north of Germany. :)

My mother is from Nurnberg and I am used to Bavarian dishes.  This is not the authentic version that I know from Germany, however, it has similar ingredients. Although I do not believe it is "authentic" German Potato Salad, it seems like a very tasty salad but I would reduce the sugar.

This is also very typical from Spain. We call it: Papas aliñadas. You can peel the potatoes or not. It makes no difference to me. It is a very simple recipe, but very tasty and healthy. The only ingredient that this dish is missing is the extra virgin olive oil. With this oil every dish becomes healthier and more yummy!

I made this recipe starting last october. I have been searching high & low for one close to the one that my moms aunt (straight from german) makes. The aunt lives in NY & my mom LOVES her potatoe salad. I went on a search one day and made this one for my mom, she gave me a few pointers & ive made a few adjustments to it (not everyone has the same taste buds) but generally my mom loved this one. This is the one that she liked the best b/c its DOESN'T REQUIRE the use of flour. My aunt doesn't use flour either. so over all from those who know good german potato sald this is a good one. And its easy enought to adjust things to everyone's liking.

This is basically the usual german potato salad. My grandmother is 85 and her grandmother came from Germany in the 1800's and this is pretty much the same recipe! Very Good!

I recently made this potato salad to sell for a fundraiser at a German club I belong to.  I made it exactly as written.  I had people from Germany saying this was the best they had ever tasted.  It reminded them of home!  It was wonderful.

I thought I was going top my friend's german potato salad, but this one somehow didn't.  Her recipe is from good house keeping magazine.  With that said I thought it is good, just not spectacular.  I did add a little broth from a homemade onion soup and it tasted better than without it.

I loved it! I used about 5 cups of red potatoes and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and about 1/2 the onions and I thought it tasted very good! We had friends over and they all loved it too so we will be making it again for sure!

I make this recipe for our annual oktoberfest party, everyone really likes it. I took a star off cause personally I am not to fond of the sweetness.  I cut back on the sugar though, I only use 1 tablespoon. I cant picture using that full amount I think it would be way to sweet.

OUR family recipe, dating back to the 1920's and our German immigrant gr/grandmother contained egg, whisked with the vinegar, water, and bacon drippings.  Kind of like a hollandaise idea.  We ALWAYS double the sauce.  And NO SUGAR!  Try it.

This was great.  Made it a day in advance and then reheated in the microwave.  I was concerned at first because there seemed to be an excessive amount of liquid in the dressing but after it set overnight most of the liquid was absorbed. Will make again!  Other guests love it too.

This was delicious! I had to use apple cider vinegar since I did not have any white vinegar.  My husband has never liked a German potato salad until this one.  I'll have to try it again with the white vinegar to make the recipe as is and see if he likes it still!

I made this for my German husband but doubled the sauce mixture and the turkey bacon.  He absolutely went nuts.  It was just a little too sweet for us so next time I will cut the sugar in half.  Otherwise a very nice recipe.

This is so good, I made it with red skin potatoes which don't fall apart so easily if over cooked and I used Turkey Bacon to make it a little more figure friendly, I also reduced the amount of sugar to 2 TBS as it is too sweet for my taste.  It came out great, we had it for thanksgiving and everyone wanted the recipe.

I love this recipe and make it frequently. I highly advise against using russet potatoes. I find that they turn to mush rather than staying in whole pieces. In fact, I think white potatoes are the best for this recipe.  Sometimes I use the real bacon crumbles from the store and saved bacon grease from the freezer because I don't like to mess with bacon - delicious but messy. But let me be clear: LOVE THIS RECIPE!

This recipe is incredible.  I was concerned about the amount of bacon fat, but its correct.  Also added a half cup of chopped celery and a tablespoon additional vinegar.  Everyone at the dinner party raved about it and some asked for the recipe.

Pretty good. I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 Tbsp and it was still too sweet for my taste. Also, in my opinion, the salad was MUCH better the following day after having lots of time to absorb the sauce.

Very good, very simple recipe.  Absolutely use the red skinned potatoes. No need to peel them.  I just cut them into bite size pieces and boiled just until tender. We will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. My husband hates traditional potato salad so I tried this one out on him and he loved it. I made a little extra sauce and am glad I did as the potatoes needed it. I also used turkey bacon instead and it was super yummy.

This was a HIT at the reunion. At first I was worried about the amount bacon grease because it isnt really measured in the recipe, and some bacon produces more grease than others...but when the onions cook in it, the consistancy is reduced so it really turns out perfect.

This by far is the best potato salad I've ever had!! I didn't have parsley... but I just excluded it, but still, I love it!! I've always liked potato salad, but I've never tried any that didn't use eggs or mayo. It's different and probably won't go bad in the sun at a picnic because it's not kept chilled. This is fantastic!! I will definitely be making this again~ THANKS!

I have been making this recipe for years except the one I had did not specify white vinegar so I had always used the red wine vinegar.  I tried this one with the white and hubby and I both thought it was good but we both agreed that the red wine vinegar made it more flavorful.

My husband's mother was German, and we lived in Germany for several years.  This was awesome!  We eat it cold, however, so I let it cool off in the refrigerator.  He liked it even better than the kind his sister makes.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar and add a little more vinegar according to our taste, but it was fantastic following the recipe too.

Very, very good!!  I made a double batch and I didn't change a thing except for using dried parsley flakes (my poor parsley plant died!)instead of fresh.  I will keep this recipe and use it a lot.  This also got rave reviews from my picky son. :-)  Thanks!

I admit, I really love traditional, mayo based potato salad, but this is a nice change of pace! I enjoyed it more at room temperature than warm, however. I served this with Bierocks from this site. Thanks for a new twist on an old favorite!

I have been looking for a German Potato Salad recipe for a very long time; one that would please both my husband and myself. My husband, not a huge fan of vinegar, thought this one was pretty good. I thought it needed some more vinegar so I sprinkled some on my serving and we were both happy. The German Potato Salad of my childhood always had hardboiled eggs in it and I added some which helped thicken the sauce.

This is REALLY good and easy to modify!  To make it less fattening, I used Hormel's Real Crumbled Bacon (a salad topping that I've used it in all sorts of recipes and it tastes great), I substituted the sugar with splenda,  and I cooked the onions in a touch of olive oil.  This saved our necks after the power went out in the wake of Hurricane Dolly because it tastes good right out of a rapidly-warming fridge!

Absolutely wonderful!  This tasted exactly what my mother used to make.  Everyone at our dinner party loved it, even my friend that doesn't like potato salad.  The second time I made it just for my family and I doubled the recipe since it was good as cold leftovers for lunch.  This doesn't last very long in my house!

I lived in Germany for 4 years as a child and this is perfect!!  Parsley is just for color, not taste, so if you don't hsve it don't freak out.  Great departure from the everyday.  I use sea salt to taste instead of table salt and fresh ground pepper.

It was very very yummy! I made a triple batch for my husband's german themed birthday party. Everybody LOVED it! I usually make all low fat foods so this was definetely an indulgence for us. But every once in awhile is ok.

Really, really good!  A great change from the usual mayonnaise-y potato salad made in my family.  Very tangy and more substantial than the mayonnaise-y stuff.  We liked it best served hot.

I hosted an Oktoberfest party and served this as my German Potato salad ... it was gobbled up in a hurry ... I almost didn't get any!  I was asked about 5 times for the recipe ... only thing I did differently was make slightly more dressing than it called for ... awesome recipe

I made this recipe for a pitch-in at work, and after having my husband try it (and tell me that it was better than our 'famous' local deli), I still agonized over whether anyone would like it.  No one wants to be labeled as a bad cook.

It was a HIT!  Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

This is a good recipe: simple to prepare, economical and quite satisfying. I doubled the recipe. I also cooked 2 stalks of chopped celery along with the onions. I topped the salad with 1/2 dozen sliced hard-cooked eggs, sprinkled paprika over it and put it in the refrigerator. I have 2 grown sons (who happened to have a couple of friends over last Saturday morning) and this salad was gone long before the lunchtime I had prepared it for! :)

Took this to the family reunion, and it was a hit.  The only change was to add some celery seed.  Several people asked for the recipe, and I brought home an empty bowl.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for "German Night" at my husbands request. I was a little worried about potato salad without mayo but this was excellent! We love the vinegar flavor and usually add a little more than it calls for. Will make again and again!

VERY easy to make AND delicious. Also reheats well. I  didn't have one drop of leftovers, and the crowd I was feeding was sad to see the last spoonful disappear. Typically I alter every recipe to suit my needs, but this one was made “as is” because there was no need for any changes!

At first, the vinegar overwhelmed the dish, but after an overnight in the fridge, it was fabulous, it was less acidic, more tangy, and gave the potatoes a fabulous kick.

This potato salad was wonderful - even better leftover.  I reduced the sugar, as recommended by other reviewers and added real bacon bits to boost the bacon flavor without cooking additional slices.  I also saved time by using sliced red potatoes (no peeling) and by substituting sliced green onions for the onions and parsley.

Made this for a friend who loves German food and he raved.  I enjoyed it but I think I would add more vinegar, just as a personal taste, very good recipe

This was a fabulous recipe. Exactly what I think of with German Potato Salad. I used turkey bacon and thickened the sauce a little with 1 t flour and 1 T milk before adding it to the potatoes.

I made this in a cast iron skillet and put it in the oven while my pork chops were baking. The potatoes browned a little and it really set the flavors
My husband has already asked for me to fix it again!

Excellent! I ended up doubling the recipe (except for salt) and tripling the bacon (why waste it). I did remove 1/3 of the grease to make sure it wasn't too oily. My measurements might not have been right, but it tasted really good.

Very simple recipe, but very delicious.  This is a great recipe for a barbecue, or just a everynight meal.  I really like that it is vinegar based, not mayonnaise based.  It's easy to carry to other people's houses or to work for a pot luck.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic and super easy to make.  We used to go to a favorite german resturaunt just for the authentic german potato salad.      They have since closed.
Now I have this recipe which is just perfect in comparison  to the origional german potato salad we used to have.

Love it. I’ve always made my own German Potato salad that my German mother and German grandmother made. I was just gonna see something a little different. Basically the only difference is I add green onions and never measure anything so mine probably has more of the vinegar sauce. Whoever said this isn’t authentic should maybe question if it’s just a different authentic then the one they are used to. Gee, I wonder if there can be more than one “authentic”. Authentic Mexican food is different from region to region and I’m sure German potato salad is too.

This was my second time making GPS. Thr first time I used a recipe using broth,  like some said was the authentic way.  It was good,  but not as good as this recipe.  I made changes (of course). More juice! My potatoes were too dry with this amount of liquid.  Potatoes soak up TONS of liquid. I also referenced another recipe as I always do and added sour cream.  And definitely less sugar.  Did about maybe 1.5t instead of 3T. It was delicious! However,  next time I may add about 1T of mayo to coat potatoes and keep it creamy.  Just the right tang! I prefer this recipe to the broth ones.  Will make again! Thank you. It IS as authentic as any German restaurant or deli I've tasted!

This is a great recipe, very similar to one I have had for years. I used Apple cider vinegar in place of the white vinegar with no differences noted. I did add more vinegar as my German heritage likes the tang. Also, I eliminated the parsley. This salad is a great addition to any meal!

Made this for the first time today. I only added two tablespoons of sugar based on some of the reviews but it was still too sweet.  Next time I will use one.  Aside from that it was very good and I will definitely make it again.

It was good.  I withheld the salt due to salt restricted diet and bacon has a lot of salt in it.  I miss the salt.
I also like tangy salad and would have added more vinegar but this is a matter of taste.  
Easy to make.

Loved this - 10 starts if possible. Here's how I got there from other reviewers:
-Boiled, unpeeled potatoes cut 1/4" thick in chicken broth & random garlic cloves (2-5 as you wish).
-Added minced sweet onions to the cooked potatoes
-Made dressing (less sugar as suggested) didn't use all dressing as taters were swimming in dressing. Added a tsp of mustard.
- Added chopped parsley (& decorated the bowl)
-Sprinkled celery seed on the top.
-I got more kudos than Aunt Ida's mayo-based recipe, her's was wonderful with a splashes of Tabasco. 

Amazing & easily modified to your preferences. Sending recipe to Sis next. Hope you're the next hit-of-the-party!

I love this recipe.  I use red potatoes and leave the skin on, double the bacon, and use apple cider vinegar instead.   I think the proportions of everything are spot on besides needing to double it!

This was very good.  I failed to read through the whole recipe, though, and cooked the onions the in the remainder of the bacon drippings without adding the vinegar and remainder of the ingredients. No worries. I mixed the vinegar with the remainder of the ingredients then poured it over the cooked potatoes, onions, and bacon which we already in a casserole dish, and warmed everything up in the oven. The vinegar solution evaporated which I though it would and left a very nice taste to the potatoes which I cut, but did not peel. It actually worked out to my advantage as we pre cooked all of this because we were going out. When we returned, we just heated it up in the oven. I would make this again, but also added some celery seed to the potatoes before placing in the oven.

My wife and I really enjoyed these potatoes. The kids, who love buttery mashed potatoes did not care for it so much but I think they were expecting something familiar. I would definitely make them again and can’t wait to make them for my German neighbors to see their reaction. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this as written and it was ok to my taste. I like my German potato salad to be sweet, and vinegary. And when my German mom made this she always put celery in hers as well. So I added celery, more apple cider vinegar, and another table spoon of sugar, and more salt and pepper. Delicious. Sorry I changed it. But I did try it as is and that is what the 4 stars are. I figured it is my taste that made it just ok to me. But don't we all make things to our taste? And we all taste differently. I think I go back to the way my moms tasted. And I am sure we all do that.

Couldn't tell you whether this is authentic or not but I can tell you its delicious! I, too, cut the sugar (barely a tsp) and doubled the sauce. I'd like to make it a tad spicy next time...there will definitely be a next time!

Excellent recipe!  Perfect for our cul-de-sac Octoberfest get together.  Made 2 alterations to recipe.  Used part peeled and part unpeeled small-ish red potatoes.  Also, did not add sugar.

Used Yukon potato and ACV.  Half of the sugar.  Taste was very good with a some tang (not overpowering) from vinegar.  I would made again.

I made it! I can't believe I didn't botch the recipe somehow. I can now cook 3 things lol. This was very easy and OMG delicious. It tastes just like the German potato salad I miss from my favorite German restaurant in the city (3 hours drive away). And guess what?! I'm NOT sharing. Haha!

Excellent and easy recipe but I made it even easier and less fattening. I bought fully cooked bacon, which omitted the grease. So, I added olive in the place of the bacon grease. Instead of 3 tablespoons of sugar, I added 1.5, which was just as delicious! Instead of peeling and boiling the potatoes, I bought tiny potatoes and microwaved them with skins on and roughly chopped them up. Loved it!

I have made this over and over again all summer. It's so good. Everyone loves it, just like the description says and it's a good alternative to mayonnaise laden potato salads that I find fewer people want or like. Perfect for any summer BBQ. But I'll be making it year round.

Great, not everyone has had hot German potato salad but everyone I make it for loves it, this is a great recipe.  Only change is I put a little more bacon in and do slightly thick half. slices as opposed to diced

Not only did I love this salad but it turned my 9 year old into a potato salad fan. I neglected to saute the onions in bacon grease. Im guessing that wgy it wasn't baconey enough for us.

Made it just as it was described the first time. Everyone loved it. It also works very well with canned sliced potatoes if you need a quick side to bring to a potluck. Taste very good that way and people devowered it.

This turned out great!  We just returned from Germany and have been missing some of the regional dishes we enjoyed there. I have a recipe for this, somewhere, but saw this and gave it a try. My husband had seconds topped with a couple whole slices of bacon.

This was so delicious.  I made it about 2 hrs before everyone came over to let it marinade at room temp.  I wouldn't change a thing and will be making it again.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  I did use red potatoes cos they hold up in a salad and I didn't peel them, just washed and diced.

Very good I did add a few extra potatoes, just because I had them.  I will make this again.  German potato salad is yummy.   I also substituted apple cider vinegar as that was what I had .  No taste or color change that I could tell.

This was absolutely delicious and easy to make.

I substituted a small yellow onion for the scallions, which I didn't have on hand.

I had never made German potato salad before Easter 2019 so i Really had no idea what I was doing or even how it should turn out. My great aunt used to make a family recipe when I was a child and I remember everyone loving it. Well, I made this recipe, Following the recipe precisely except for I doubled the amount of onion that I put in. I also made 25% more of the liquid which seemed to work well. Between the double onion and the extra sauce, the flavor was wonderful! My whole family, who used to eat my great aunts German potato salad, could not get over how great the flavor of this was! I have made it three times since Easter already.

Potato Smasto, Authentic or not you can get the same taste from pre simmer in water . Then chill in fridge. Then fry with vinegar and olive oil. Then I chose just to stir mayo into mine ,other than the flour and water . Save that for gravy. Delicious and with some real chopped celery fried along with celery seeds awesome!!!

It was easy 30 minute prep time and soooo yummy !! Highly recommended. I used Apple Cider vinegar and I believe the Apple Cider taste enhanced the basic recipe.

Made this for a German-fest party. It was a huge hit.! Note: even better the next day! I doubled the recipe, but added less salt. Bacon had enough. Used ends and pieces style bacon for more texture. A keeper for sure!! less calories than regular potato salad too!

Delicious! *You will want/need to double this recipe* I ended up using 7 medium-sized russets but I think any potato will do. If I use red potatoes next time, I may just leave the skin on and save a step!

I don’t like mayo so I was looking for a potato salad without mayo and this recipe didn’t disappoint! The bacon definitely makes it so don’t skip it. I would maybe drain some of the grease—I don’t think it needed all of it but the flavor was excellent and my husband and kids loved it too.

This was very good and easy. I would use less sugar next time, but I think that's just a personal preference. I added more vinegar to balance out the sweetness.

The only thing I did was to pour off  about 1/3 of the bacon grease left in the pan after frying the bacon and before adding the chopped onion.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Fantastic!

Fantastic.  I included 3/4 cup of boiled carrots.  I was a little worried going without mayonnaise, but the sweetness of the sugar and the tart of the white vinegar was fabulous.  The only thing I might change is to add some diced celery.  Good, tasty recipe.  Fairly easy to make also.

I made this according to recipe, except used dried parsley instead of fresh. It was really good. My husband said he didnt want to eat the other kind (mayo based) ever again.

Easy, and essentially one pan (and one pot to boil potatoes) if you start by cooking the bacon in a decent sized skillet - then you can add the dressing to the cooked onions and last put in potatoes.

I have had this recipe for 50 years.  It came to me from my mother and before that her mother, who was born in Germany.  Anyone who says this is not authentic, please consider that different regions of Germany may make it slightly different.  We love this recipe and the person who submitted the recipe did an excellent job in prepping.  I had forgotten about sauteing the potatoes in the bacon grease.  Thanks for the reminder!!!

I am literally just learning to cook and Allrecipes has been my lifesaver!  I had a dinner party for eight this past weekend (German themed) and this dish was an ABSOLUTE HIT!  My guests loved it, it was simple to make and I made it exactly to the recipe!

Made this after reading reviews, and followed others suggestions to double the "sauce" and it turned out great.  I used red and yellow potatoes,  and didn't peel them.  Forgot to add the sugar until the very end, but since it was hot, the sugar incorporated with no problems.  This dish is best after it sits for a few minutes to let the potatoes absorb the sauce.

I had to add a little more salt and pepper for my taste,  and it could have been a tad more dressing to potato ratio,  but all in all,  was in the very good category.

Grew up in a NY in a German deli and must say this is similar to the potato salad we sold with rave reviews for years. One difference is we would add oil in the mixture and ALWAYS used red potatoes which gives it a slightly different flavor. FYI, let  the potato salad cool and mix in mayo its delicious.

It was good. The sweetness was balanced really well to the vinigor. Just not what grandma used to make. I made it a 2nd time. Added equal amount of celery and onion. About 1/2 cup each. When making the "sauce" I boiled it down for a while. The 1st time I made this recipe the sauce was very thin. It coated everything but drained to the bottom of the serving dishes. I boiled it until it thinckend. Similar to a light syrup consistentcy. Think Dory! Just keep stirring. This brought the flavors together the second time around. 5 stars.

I didn't use sugar, and sub fresh dill.  Usually use a white onion, although yellow is fine too.  Oh and white wine vinegar.  Get a great slab of bacon that will produce lovely grease.  A poorly raise pig will tend to have bacon which produces a bitter grease which is why, I believe, they want to add sugar to cover the bitterness of the pig.

Perfect tough I have two tiny alteration. I wash but do not peel my potatoes and I add a  healthy pinch of cayenne - not to make it spicy but just enough to slightly take your breath away on first bite.  I’ve made this recipe many times for dinner parties and bbqs and people get addicted to it like crack. It’s just the best.

This was amazing! First time making this dish and it won’t be the last! I doubled the receipe and it turned out great! Keep in mind if you use fatty bacon, you may have to take out some of the grease.

My Grandma used “shpeck” instead of bacon. It is ham fat cut into tiny dice and fried until crispy. And yes, she boiled the potatoes whole and peeled them while still hot and added the dressing while still warm. Otherwise, she used the same ingredients.

Discovered that I peeled enough potatoes for a double batch.  Made some adjustments for eight servings.   I used one large vidalia onion and an entire package of bacon.  I mixed the other ingredients, minus the potatoes, in a separate pan and used a slotted spoon to remove the fried onion from the bacon grease, without pressing it out.  I added a couple of tablespoons of the grease to the mixture and brought it to a boil.  I added the potatoes in after that.  For a finishing touch, I added in the fresh parsley last.  It was  fantastic,  very flavorful and delicious without being too heavy or oily.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a good salad. My spouse dislikes salads with a strong vinegar taste, so I used 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 red wine vinegar. Also used lots of cut up cucumber but could substitute lots of different veg, depending on what you have on hand . We liked it a lot, and my spouse went back for seconds. I'll be making this again!

Followed some of the tips from the German reviewers. Less sugar, less than 1tsp. And made it soupier with more vinegar and water. Really good.

Yeah! 
For Muslims, I used mutton instead of bacon 
and it was delicious 
The only mistake I did was not boiling the potato enough,  I'll avoid that mistake the next time

Maden this for dinner tonight with brats from Lidl. Too sweet, but otherwise perfect. I used apple cider vinegar, and added a teaspoon of German mustard to the sauce. Next time I’ll cut the sugar in half and it will be just like I want it.

One of the very few recipes I followed exactly to a T and I’m glad I did. This came out fantastic. I made this for a work event and everyone told me how much they LOVED this and it reminded them of a mother/grandmother. I did cook it a day ahead, placed it in the fridge and warmed it up in a crock pot the next day. Will definitely make again!!

My changes- Used 1/3c pomegranate vinegar, a couple tlbspns sweet cherry pepper juice from jar, about a tlbsp beet juice from jar in place of sugar. Used about 6 strips bacon. Kept everything else the same.

Better than store bought by miles. Really, really good recipe. Bravo, thankyou, cheers!

I've made this recipe for years.  My grandma who is Wisconsin German made a very similar dish.  This one is spot on.  I've done the other variants with red wine vinegar and purple onion. But i typically make this one for burgers and BBQ potluck type scenarios.  Cheers!

I used turkey bacon, then a little olive oil since I didn't have enough grease for the onions, and used sweet n low to replace the sugar.  Very good!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used dill instead of parsley and red potatoes with the skin.  Cooked the potatoes early in the day for a party and reheated them in the pan with the dressing.

To continue—I took the salad out of the fridge today, warmed it up a bit, and it was perfect!  The potatoes had absorbed the liquid and all the flavors melded beautifully.

Simple, easy and tastes great. I like it a lot because it's not light and not full of mayo.

Made this to go with the schnitzel and loved it.  As a couple reviews recommend, think I will add a little more liquid next time as I will make this again.

My new "go to" German Potato Salad ! As the one fellow from Deutschland advised you should adjust sugar to taste and you can boil then peel and cut potatoes if you find it easier. I added extra black pepper  and  salt as well. Thanks  for sharing this recipe !

This is freakin' delicious! I took note of some of the comments and a few other recipes--I doubled the amount of "sauce" (vinegar, water, salt, pepper, etc.), and only used 1/3 of the amount of recommended sugar. I also substituted vegetable stock for the water. I'm generally not a fan of vinegar, so when that mixture was cooking I was rather repulsed and worried what this would taste like--but it's REALLY good!

An excellent dish that was much enjoyed. However, my German student tells me that he never had warm potato salad until he came to America - they always cool it completely.

Very tasty!!  I don't know or care whether it's authentic or not, but it's a delicious dish.  The tangy vinegar and the bacon (which I added more of because more bacon never makes it worse)  made me very happy.  I mad it exactly as the recipe directs.  Since it's hard to accurately buy and measure 3 cups of diced potatoes (a weight measurement would help a lot) I didn't have quite enough sauce so next time i will perhaps double the sauce ingredients.

This was excellent flavor!  I used 6 cups small red potatoes, skins on, and chopped them after draining them.  I dumped them in the saucepan with the browned onion, etc. and warmed it all up for dinner time.  Very good!

This is an exceptional recipe!  My guests & I couldn't keep from commenting on how delicious & nice a change it was from our regular potato fare. Next time I make it, I think I'll hold back a little on the salt, though. No one made mention of it but I thought it was a "tad" bit more salty than my tastes prefer. This was most likely because the turkey-bacon I used was already salty, itself. Despite this one adjustment I still give this recipe a 5 star rating.  A definite new addition to my Favorites list!

I made this for my family on Sunday, May 27, 2018. First time ever - cut sugar down, doubled bacon and onions. Used more olive oil and less bacon fat. I also used half white half apple cider vinegar.  I also doubled the sauce and it was perfect - not soggy or too dry even the next day. This recipe is stupid delicious!!! My family is begging me to make it again next week even though I doubled the recipe. I can honestly say this is THE BEST German potato salad I have ever eaten!  I wish I had taken a picture of it as I usually do take pics of my food. Next time I make it will do another review and add a pic. Cut back on the sugar - you won’t miss it and it won’t taste so cloying.  Make it - it’s total comfort food! ??

I have used this recipe 3 times so far. Each time I amended the recipe slightly. The final version matches my 80 year old Bavarian mother’s recipe. See, she never followed a recipe on any of her authentic Bavarian dishes. Rouladen, Sauerbraten, spaetzle, schnitzel or whatever were all from practice and perfection. The final version today, I took the advice in a previous review and doubled the sauce and ingredients. Much more moisture and flavor. I did reduce the sugar by a third and didn’t notice much change. Sehr Gut.

It was really fast to make and tasty too. I followed the recipe exactly this time since it was the first time I made it. Next time I make it I will have to change it a little bit we found it a tad too sweet, but that is us. Next time I am going to cut the sugar by about half (and yes there will be a next time!!) Was also thinking about trying it with apple cider vinegar just for fun.

I have made this several times to rave reviews. I overheard one man say "See honey, this is the way German potato salad should be made." After making it exactly according to directions the first time, I switched to cooking the potatoes and then slicing (rather than cubing) them after they were cooked.

I made this for a covered dish benefit.  There was non left! I've made several German potato salads and this one ranks up there.  I doubled the sauce because the potatoes inevitably soak up so much and leave a dry salad.  I added the amount of sugar called for but personally found it way too sweet.  I prefer a vinegary salad.   It's easy and comes together at the last minute so I could take to the dinner warm.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. It reminded me of the German potato salad I grew up eating as a kid.

Turned out great!! We used 1/2 cup white vinegar AND 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, doubled the bacon and used 1/4 cup sugar.  Goes so well with a good beer or 2!

Loved this, and so did the family, although I did not end up adding the full amount of sugar. I started with 1-1/2 TBSP, intending to  add more per taste, but it was really sweet enough at that. Some thought the sweetness just-right, some thought it too much, so the sweetness level is simply a matter of custom or personal preference. I found the flavor wonderful, and I like the simplicity of preparation. I will definitely keep this among my regular recipes. Note: How many potatoes to end up with 3 cups of diced potatoes? About 4-5 medium potatoes, or 1 lb.

Easy to make. Make sure to brown the onions and bacon grease to a goldfish-brown color. Use less sugar, one tbsp  and pair with some German beer. I like my potatoes with a doughier texture, cut the potatoes smaller and over boil by two minutes.

It was absolutely delicious!  Tweaked it a little based on the previous reviews.  Used red potatoes, apple cider vinegar, Vidalia onion and only 1 tablespoon sugar.  Used 10 strips of bacon.  Made it for a very large group.  They all loved it.

A guaranteed hit no matter what.  Recently took this dish to an Oktoberfest get-together and everyone raved about it.  Such a nice change to not have the mayonnaise!   I add an extra tablespoon of ACV because I really like a heavy vinegar flavor.  My daughter recently added "potatoes" to my grocery list and when I asked her why she told me that she wanted more of this potato salad!

This was a wonderful dish, and the directions made it so simple. Personally, I would like a little sharper flavor. Maybe some mustard seed added to the vinegar mixture. However, I enjoyed this so much and our family ate every bite. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved it! I used red potatoes and left the peels on them.  I like that it's not too heavy on the sugar. I might use a little less the next time, however. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a recent Oktoberfest party and it was well received.  I thought the dish was good, but I will admit I'm more partial to the creamy style potato salad of my youth. I gave this dish 5 stars because although I wasn't a super big fan one of my friend's teenage daughter liked it so much she asked if she could take the leftovers home.  You can't get much better praise than that!

Made this with the instant pot - peeled and sliced the potatoes about 1/4" thick, cooked for 3 minutes on manual, then an instant release.  While that was going, I cut up bacon and cooked it, then added onion and cooked on low.  I should have added the onion earlier, it was still crunchy and my family detected them. ;)  Great recipe!

This is one of the best German potato salad recipes I've ever made. I've made it for my extended family a couple of times and they liked it so much there were no left overs. I was sad about that. It was a huge success. I will be making it again and I won't change anything.

I made this German Potato Salad for a cooking contest.  The flavor is best if you can let the salad rest in the refrigerator for 2 days before serving. I did saute some diced red pepper with the onions, just for color.  By the way it won a blue ribbon and it was at an October German Beer Festival

I am not German, but I care for an elderly gentleman who is. I have made this for him a couple of times and he loved it. His family recently came for a visit, all of whom are German and they all agreed that they were delicious. I love that it has no mayo and it is delicious!

Coming from a German family  of fabulous cooks (I am first generation,) I feel qualified to say that this is the real thing.  I made the salad, but it had to sit a while, absorbing the dressing.  I did add another helping of the vinegar and sugar in the re-warming.  It was wonderful!

I increased the recipe 50% but only used 2 tablespoons of sugar because I didn't want it to be that sweet. I used 3 lbs of Yukon Gold potatoes.

This is the second time I've made this potato salad, and, for someone who cannot make a great potato salad, I've received rave reviews. The only substitution was using 2 tblsp sugar, vs the 3 suggested. I also used new potatoes, tri-coloured, but stayed true to the recipe in all other ways.

I kept the potato skin on and added a tablespoon of dry ranch seasoning. 
Easy to make and great either hot or cold.

I made this. Outstanding! I thought nothing could beat my grandmother's German potato salad, but this did! I  didn't peel the potatoes, but left the nutrient rich skins on.

Not really the same as the potato salad  I remember from Germany, but similar, tasty, and easy. I'd give it 3.5 stars if it were an option. But since I can't, I decided to round up . Also, didn't bother pealing the potatoes. Such an unnecessary step.  The skins add a nice color contrast and a bit of texture.

I get rave reviews with this German Potato Salad recipe. Two cheats? I microwave my potatoes. Just make sure your potatoes are all about the same size, and try not to over cook them. We often use yellow potatoes, because that's my go to for smashed potatoes. Make sure they are cooled enough to handle. Slice them. Add them to the boiling sauce. Really feeling lazy? A staple in my panty is real bacon pieces. Use olive oil instead of bacon grease (about half cup), put bacon bits in with onion to soften them up. Bam, you've just made homemade German Potato Salad in about 10-15 minutes! Make a double batch, your family / guests will gobble it up.

This was very tasty and rather easy to make.  I did double the recipe for a pig roast and it only made 1/2 crock pot.  It was gone immediately!  I will make this again, but increase the quantity.  (my personal preference).  Thank you for the recipe.

It was a nice no mayonnaise salad.  It was a little to sweet for me and not enough of a sharp vinegar flavor for my tastes.

I used medium sized red potatoes, unpeeled and cut into small pieces after cooking.  I like to leave the peel on.  Otherwise, I followed the original recipe.  It could have used a bit more seasoning.  Next time I will follow the recommendations of GRUMBLERXL to bring up the flavour.  I've been looking for a "no mayo" potato salad and this recipe fits the bill with a few adjustments.

Awesome recipe! Super easy to make. I changed up a few ingredients. I used red potatoes instead of russets and I used green onion instead of parsley. I like the flavor that the green onion adds.

Cross cut a full pound of bacon while it is still slightly frozen, double up the vinegar, use baby red and white potatoes.   Let sit overnight in fridge and reheat!  The flavor gets a chance to mull.   Enjoy

My husband is very picky and does NOT like mayo at all. So this recipe was my attempt to get him to eat something other than mashed potatoes. He loved it! His entire family loves it! It's become a regular staple at picnics and cookouts here. Thank you for such a great, easy recipe.

Pretty close to my NYC aunt and uncle's potato salad they served at their German Deli...they GRATED the onion over the potatoes after they were boiled and drained...and they used WHITE pepper instead of black pepper. They also left the potatoes overnight in the vinegar marinade then drained in the AM and continued with the rest of the recipe

I needed a potato salad with eggs for a picnic and this was great and turns out to be one of my favorites.  I really love vinegar but  I did put a little to much.

Made it with either a variety of  Peterson's smoked sausages and beef franks. The beef franks were a lot more lean and resulted in a much more palatable meal.

Easy , tasty and satisfying. For some  reason I had leftover bacon after breakfast so I saved the drippings, and skipped the frying step, so that ,made  it super easy. Had a bag of mixed baby potatoes and a couple full sized reds , used em all. Didn't peel them. Threw some mustard in cause I've seen some recipes that call for it. Then I thought of the mustard was overpowering so I added a teaspoon honey, and voila! Even my picky son liked it.

The recipe as-is seems about a 3. Having used a lot of the suggestions other reviewers mentioned in their reviews, it is a 4.5. I used small yellow potatoes and boiled them with the skin on. Fork tender taters took longer than 10 minutes. Like many others, I also doubled the sauce recipe- increasing the liquids and onion (used 1 small yellow onion + 1 large shallot). I only used 4 slices of bacon because that's all I had left. I also only used about 1-2 TBSP sugar despite the doubled recipe called for over a 1/4 cup. Once the potatoes were boiled, I cut them into slices, keeping some skin on and removing some. I put these in a large mixing bowl, layered with paper-thin slices of cucumber. After the mixture on the stove came to a boil I poured this into the bowl over the hot potato and cucumber slices. Then I added the crumbled bacon, a generous helping of sliced scallions, some shakes of dried dill and a small handful of celery seeds. I carefully stirred this up and put it into the refrigerator to sit. It was tasty an hour later and even better/more vinegary the next day.

Loved loved loved this recipe. I have always preferred German style egg free potato salads and this one is my favorite so far. The only change I made was adding about a teaspoon of thyme and ground sage. It worked so well with the smoked bacon flavor and makes the onions more flavorful.

This is almost the exact same recipe my German  grandfather and father made. I doubled the liquids and bacon and did not completely peel my red potatoes. Also, I sautéed my onions in the bacon grease and let it sit overnight. Eight hours is not enough time for the flavors to enhance the dish although you should carefully fold it twice before tasting and serving. I never have enough and there are never leftovers!! Quick tip, taste your liquid mixture before mixing with potatoes. This is your base. Do not add any salt, pepper, or vinegar until the next day as it takes time for the  potatoes to fully draw up the seasonings.

I made this using red potatoes and cutting down to 1 tbsp. Sugar, and adding 1 tsp. of celery seed as suggested by other reviewers. Even with those small revisions, the overall flavor of this is UNMISTAKABLY DELICIOUS. Had 23 people over for a Friday night bite & sip , and had this as a side dish. People were phoning me the next day asking me to share this recipe. Very yummy!

Awesome potato salad... only thing I changed was replacing the 2 tbsp of water with more vinegar and using red onion along with the other onion. Tastes good hot or cold.

Not enough vinegar.  No thickening ingredient included in recipe, like flour or corn starch? Ended up "doctoring" this one. Not a hit at my house. Won't make it again. Not the way my German Grandma taught me... So much for trying something new.

I made this for a culture fest at my college and everyone loved it! Whenever I have to make a dish for anything, this is my go to recipe and much of the time this is what I'm told to bring.

I double the batch because no matter what it is used for, it goes fast. I used a lot more bacon. I end up using a whole package.

Too sweet. I made a double batch and used 4T sugar, but it was still too sweet. Next time, more vinegar, less sugar, and more dill, because I love dill! Also, I used little sausage weenies because I didn't feel like making bacon. It was a good dish. Everyone at the table was pleased (minus the too sweet part).

This salad is delicious and easy to make. I made it then put it in the crock pot on low the next day. I don't know if you are supposed to drain off the bacon grease. I did not. 

Though it would probably be healthier, I would think the salad would loose some of its flavor.

Take note of the # of servings! I was only going to make one batch, then realized I needed to at least double it as I started to peel potatoes.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was delicious, but I would triple the "sauce".  There just wasn't enough, IMO.  Also, like some others suggested - I added a teaspoon of celery seed.  A-mazing!  Will definitely be making this again.

This is a favorite in our house. Best served warm but cold works too. Don't over cook the potatoes or it will turn to mush. It will still take good but won't look as pretty.

My family loves this recipe! I over-cook the potatoes just a bit and make extra dressing as that's the way we prefer it. The potato chunks fall apart when you stir them so it makes kind of a  chunky mashed German potatoe salad.. Delicious!

This was a delicious and tasty recipe that was easy to make.  My only critique is that I felt it needed more vinegar in the sauce.  I also liked the idea of adding celery seed as suggested in another review.  Will make this again for sure!

I made it as per the recipe and it was great!  Actually I doubled it because I was expecting a large crowd.  I had too many left overs so next time I wont double it.

1.) boil the potatoes whole with skins and then cut up
2.) cut down on sugar - I used a teaspoon of brown sugar
3.) you will need more water added to the sauce -I just kept adding till it looked like enough to coat the potatoes 
4.) I added a pinch of celery seed 
5.) I used apple cider vinegar 
6.) Next time I will try fresh dill and parsley 

Overall, excellent recipe!! Will make again!

I would have given this 5 stars, except my husband thought the spices and vinegar were too strong.  Other guests seemed to like it.  Next time I'll try adjusting quantities.  Overall I found it easy to make and I liked it very much.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!   The only difference is I used unpeeled potatoes and used seasoned rice vinegar since that was all I had.  It did taste a little too sweet so I will cut back next time and I'll try the other suggestions of celery seed and cider vinegar.  Definitely a keeper!!

Did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe and there was way too much liquid.  I transferred the potatoes out and  reduced the sauce by half, then put the potatoes back.
   Maybe the problem was the potatoes? I used Yukon, and they are quite dense, not starchy - maybe they don't absorb liquid like other potatoes.
   But, apart from this glitch, the taste was awesome!

Since I can't find a recipe that duplicates what I grew up with, I took this one and modified it by sauteing shredded cabbage in the bacon pan drippings and doing everything  else almost as written (although I did reduce the sugar to less than 1/2 t).

Made a double batch. DELICIOUS!!!
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE
used Gold Potatoes 
1/2 tablespoon less sugar only because I like vinegary... 4 more strips of bacon but not all the grease. Two med/lg onions. 
Will never look for another recipe to follow.

Okay, so I had to substitute rice vinegar for vinegar. This made it really sour. But assuming I hadn't made it so sour, there was not a lot of taste (I'm not German, so this might be why).

With a few suggestions followed by GRUMBLERXL this is an extraordinary potato salad!!!
I doubled the vinegar using cider instead of white.  I omitted the sugar and used 1 tbsp of maple syrup instead (Canadian!). I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and some garlic/onion/thyme seasoning salt.  I didn't peel the potatoes, but kept the skin on. No parsley...I don't like that stuff.

Tangy yet creamy, without gluten, dairy, or soy...its a winner! First thing gone at the potluck. You can make it "clean" by being choosy on your bacon (uncared, ethically raised), use local produce, etc. delicious, now a monthly side dish.

This turned out ok but not the authentic flavor I expected. I followed recipe except I used red potatoes and did not peel them. Maybe it needs more seasoning.

I have made this for years! Always good.

I claimed First Prize at our church picnic yesterday with this recipe -- using two tweaks:  
1) ROASTED (instead of boiled) Small Red Potatoes, coated in a little olive oil and kosher salt. (@450, 60-70 minutes) 
2)TWICE the sauce, and reduced a bit (to make it thicker)  before adding to the quartered potatoes

Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

I usually  make potato salad with mayo when I have cook outs, but I wanted something different. I thought of the German potato salad that my mom used to make when I was a child and since she is no longer living I went to the internet to find a close match of her recipe. This recipe was even better than hers! God rest her soul. Everyone loved it and actually preferred it over the mayo potato salad version. I served this cold, but I will make in winter and serve warm.

Great base. I noted in some other reviews that folks said there wasn't enough sauce, so I increased the water and vinegar until I had about 3/4 cup total liquid. This seemed to be about right. The potatoes were still moist when I served the dish, but not drowning in excess liquid (it sat for about 15 minutes between the time I took it off the stove and the time we sat down to eat). I will probably tinker a bit with the sugar amount until I find that perfect spot between sweet and sour. I'm definitely making it again... there were no leftovers!

I made this today for lunch!  It was very good!  Nice warm comfort food to bring me back to Germany!  Thanks for the recipe we will sure make this again!   I added a little more vinegar and less sugar only because I like tart foods.

This was a quick easy recipe to serve with brats.  I have used a different, much older recipe in the past, but I was in a hurry and did not want to make a huge amount.  My old recipe was from a newspaper and provided by an older lady of German origin.  Unlike this version, the old version made ALOT of sauce and added flour to thicken the liquid and bacon drippings. For this version, I doubled the liquids (white vinegar and water).  I reduced the sugar to four tablespoons and kept the salt to one teaspoon.  In the future, I would add couple more pieces of bacon.  This was very tasty though and had a great flavor!

Cut the sugar in half and used green onion as garnish instead of parsley.  We enjoyed it.

Very good German Potato Salad!  Not sure about the authenticity - my husband's 95-year-old German Grandmother thought it was sweeter than what her mother made and his 93 year-old very German Grandfather didn't recall ever eating something similar...but it was very good all the same!

This recipe exceeded the 4 1/2 stars it had!  I'm giving it 5 stars because it was EASY to make; it had SIMPLE ingredients; and the taste was AMAZING!  I love German potato salad, and this was better than anything I've had before.  I tripled the ingredients for a large (40 people) party we were having, and everyone raved about it.  Thank you, thank you, for sharing!

Love this recipe!  It tastes authentic to me.  I doubled the sauce but not the sugar.   It did need a little more though so I probably added another 1-2tsp.  I also used Apple cider vinegar and didn't measure the potatoes but used 5 sm to med size russet potatoes, cooked them whole and then peeled and sliced.  There was plenty of sauce which is good. Served it with kielbasa sausage.  Yum.  Will most definitely make this again!

Made this as is only used a sweet onion as that is all I had.  Got raves from everyone.  Great dish for a summer party as it is light and keeps well in the heat since it's a hot dish.  I might try to add some dry mustard to it next time though.

Yummy! I can't wait to make it for a pot luck. I do think it needs more sauce, but the mix of sweet to vinegar was good (though I think I put in too much sugar). Also, it's not worth it to peel the potatoes. The skins add texture and color.

This potato salad is wonderful!!!! I followed the instructions exactly as stated, except I boiled the potatoes whole first, then peeled them and diced them. I also decided to reduce the amount of sugar to only 1 tablespoon, as other reviewers have suggested. If you don't care for the taste of vinegar or you have a keen sense of taste, however, I would reduce the amount of vinegar called for here. Will definitely be making again in the future! Thank you!

I've tweaked this recipe a bit to more closely resemble the German potato salad I get from a local German deli.  I use Apple-Cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I add fresh Dill and Chives.  Instead of sugar, I add a diced Granny Smith apple.

I made this for a potluck and it was delicious! I doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted it moist. The only thing I would do is cut down on the sugar. Maybe 2-3 tablespoons at most.

Really liked this recipe because it did not require any thickening agent such as flour or cornstarch.  I used too many potatoes and would increase the amount of the sauce next time.  Also used dried parsley and it worked out just fine.

6/8/16
My bacon (Smithfield uncured) left about a cup of fat behind.  I poured it out and wiped the cast iron pan out, then added about 1 Tbsp of the fat to the pan for frying the onions.  All the fat would have been awful and surely lethal.  Also, this particular pack of bacon was super salty, so I completely omitted the tsp of salt the recipe calls for.  Used peeled red potatoes and managed to cook them perfectly for once; they kept their shape and didn't get mushy.  It was so good!  All but my super-picky 'separate foods only' 5 year old daughter loved this.  Will be making this again and again, as time permits with this busy family.  Note: I had 6 medium sized red potatoes on hand which was somewhat less than the 6 cups called for I think.  So the 'sauce' volume was not an issue as other reviewers have complained about the recipe calling for too little liquid - it was the right amount for a smaller amount of potatoes, and we still had about 3/4 cup serving of the potato salad left over (2 adults and one 9 year old boy = adult portion; 5 year old tried one bite and refused).

Another one that I made for Memorial day event. I liked it but some others were not crazy about it. I  reduced  some of the sugar  as I read some reviews that said it was to sweet.  I should have put the dressing on the potatoes while they were hot but I had to much going on. I will make this again as I thought it tasted great.

Good recipe!! Be careful, my potatoes were done at 7 minutes and with the carry over heat, they cooked to much. Still very tasty!! Would recommend. The recipe calls for white vinegar. Video uses white wine vinegar. Also, video uses red skin potatoes. I did use the red skin but regular distilled vinegar. YUM!!

Following other raters' suggestion, we increased the "sauce" portion and that really helped.  Took it to a family BBQ and got raves for it!!  Only brought about 4 spoonfuls home.  Will make again.

Everything was perfect, but waaaaaay too sweet. I was raised in Germany, my grandmother always put a little bit of sugar in with the vinegar, but I think it was just too much this time.

This potato salad was as good as it gets! My grandma would have been proud, and a bit surprised that the 'city girl' could have made such an amazingly good German potato salad. This recipe almost mimics my grandma's recipe. There were a couple of small changes that I made. I used red potatoes, it's a personal choice and I remember that grandma's salad never had pealed potatoes. So I left the skin on.  Thank you!!!

German style potato salad was new to me as a cook, so I followed the recipe  fairly closely and found it a bit too tangy - perhaps I should have used more potatoes. I, too, had never cooked diced peeled potatoes for my family's traditional mayo salad, but found it a good idea. I will try this recipe again.

I loooove German Potato Salad. My mother used to make it from time to time..
Anyway, I wanted something hearty to eat with the oven braised beef ribs and green salad. This was it! 

I changed the amount of sugar. It would have been too sweet with 3T sugar, I only did 2T and will taste and see if I can reduce it to 1T and it still taste good. You can always add more but you can't take it back out! Also, I added about 1T more vinegar. I like it tart! It was good. I will make it again, . . .it's not low fat so I may need to find one that doesn't require bacon and bacon fat/drippings, but it was very good.

This is a very good potato salad.  I would say to use a red or a Ukon Gold potato so it isn't so crumbly.  I reduced the sugar to 1 tsp so it didn't add much sweetness, but made it interesting.  Also, per other reviews I doubled the liquid.  Everyone liked it.

this is a great recipe.   my family kills it every time I make it.   it doesn't matter if I double, triple or quadruple it.  also it goes over well at pot lucks.  sometimes I add herbs sometimes I don't.   it's your salad, do it how you like. I usually double the dressing recipe for the amount I make foe extra flavor.

I am not German so I really don't know what their potato salad should taste like, but thank you GrumblerXL for saying that this is too sweet - it is way too sweet!! It ends up being a sweet salad (it tastes as if it were made with sweet potatoes!) I will try it again but with maybe 1/2 a tbsp of sugar instead of 3 tbsps (I thought that looked like a lot, but I thought I'd try it!)

I made the following changes, I thought the amount of sugar was a little to much so I cut it to 2 tbs. it was just right. I used small boiling potatoes with the skins and chunked them after they were cooked. I enjoyed the salad and I will fix it again. I cooked Dinner Franks in a slow cooker in beer and onions, with a side of fried sourkraut and caraway seeds.

I made this as directed and agree with a few others that the sauce was kind of thin and would double it.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of celery seed to mine after a taste test once I mixed all the ingredients together and it did give it more of an authentic flavor.

Very good. I cut the sugar in half and it was still a little too sweet for my taste buds. But if you keep that in mind when preparing and make your own adjustments, you'll be very pleased with the results. And the house smells wonderful while it's been prepared.

One of my all-time favorite recipes. I usually make 4x the sauce, use a whole package of bacon, and triple the potatoes. When I make it, there are no leftovers.

Made it exactly as the recipe called for except used turkey bacon in place of pork bacon.  Turkey bacon is much leaner so I added a teaspoon of reserved oil to make up for the grease and it turned out just as yummy. There were no leftovers and It's been requested for Christmas so I'm making it again! I think this will end up being a holiday tradition.

The main concept of this dish is good. I doubled the recipe. Added 2 generous TBL spoons (1 generous TBL spoon if the recipe wasnt doubled) of Dijon mustard to add more flavor to it. I replaced the parsley with basil and added chives at the end. Personally I'm not a big mustard fan, but in this dish mustard becomes a God. I just got done cooking this dish and it's already gone. Yummy ;)

I've made the recipe as is, as well as a few variations. It's great! My favorite variations are instead of water add some good craft beer, a German Alt has been my favorite. Another variation is for the spice heads. Add 2 jalapeños sliced and de-seeded (leave in the white veins)  in with the onions as well as one seeded and veined habanero. Just a good amount of heat and pepper flavor to do you justice.

The family loved it.  It was a nice change from traditional potato salad.  Most of the family doesn't like the mayonaise based salad.

I made this as a surprise for our German Exchange Student (from Hamburg), but added ham strips (very yummy!) and he loved it. He's not sure what region of Germany this variant is from - the potato salad he is accustomed to all have mayo and mustard in them. We will definitely make it again as a healthier option to the heavy potato salads we are accustomed to!

Delicious! Had a large group over for dinner, so I tripled the recipe. It was fantastic. I did cut back on the sugar, just  by a tablespoon, because I was worried it might be too sweet. It was perfect!

Made the recipe with no changes for an Octoberfest Party. It was so easy and delicious! Made it in the morning and put it in a crockpot to warm it up later that afternoon to serve it warm. Everyone absolutely loved it.

I made this for our church's Oktoberfest  and had several compliments. This was the first time I've ever made German Potato Salad and this recipe turned out great.   I adjusted the recipe for 24 servings and used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Needless to say I didn't bring any home for leftovers.  Great recipe!

Too sweet!  Second time I used 1/4 C. sugar and added 1/2 t. dry mustard, 1/3 C. water and 3/4 t. cornstarch to thicken. 
Used red potatoes with skins.  Like others I did toss on some celery seed and parsley flakes when served.  
Perfect.

Great for game night because it goes with so many  things, such as, grilled sausage, pulled pork, sandwiches, wings, steak or you names. Always a hit no matter how bad or good the game goes.

This is so close to my mother's recipe. I do use apple cider vinegar ('cause that is what mom used) and I sprinkle a little celery seed in it. It's nice to see a real German recipe. This is really good cold also.

This has got to be the very best German potato salad I have ever eaten...and it's so easy to make. My husband wouldn't mind having it two or three times a week. We won't do that though, even though we totally love it. Thanks for sharing!

I made two minor changes. Instead of diced the onions I sliced them and I started with 2 Tbls of sugar and ended up using 2.5 Tbls.  It was delicious.  I will do it again.

Everyone loved this! I live near the Bavarian themed town of Leavenworth, WA and made it for a volunteer appreciation dinner that was German themed. I used about 12 pounds of potatoes, and made about 8 times the onion sauce. I increased the bacon, too and reduced the sugar by 1/3. I used new potatoes, boiled them whole 20 minutes, cooled them, slipped the skins off and sliced them instead of cubing them. It made two large slow cookers of potato salad, and an extra smaller casserole for my family. I heated it on low for about 2 hours which finished cooking the potatoes perfectly. It was fabulous! One man had 4 servings! My husband has visited Bavaria and said it was just like what he had there. I got many compliments and the slow cookers were scraped clean!

Okay, so it's not "authentic" in the strictest sense of the word, but this tastes really, really good, IMHO--very much like the "German potato salad" that my Czech mother used to make.   Too much sugar for my family, though; we like it better with only ONE T of sugar.  I also brought the dressing to a boil, then removed it from the heat and sprinkled/mixed in about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the dressing a bit.   SO yummy!

I liked the recipe, authentic or not, but I made a few changes along the way, mainly because of what I had available in my pantry:
1 TBS of sugar, not 3 (don’t like “sweet” potato salad).
Apple Cider vinegar instead of white.
Red New Potatoes instead of Idaho Russet .
Boiled potatoes (cubed) in 3 TBS beef bouillon with skins .
Doubled the bacon.
Reduced the bacon fat (in pan) to less than 2 TBS.
Added 6 green onions (scallions), sliced/chopped fine.
Added more chopped parsley.
Added more fresh ground pepper.
Reduced salt — for people with salt-sensitive diets (beef bouillon adds a little salt and a lot of flavor).

Even with all my changes, the salad was such a hit at the BBQ, that people ate it all up! I’ve never had my grandma’s mayo-based potato salad eaten like that, so this is probably my new potato salad recipe for future BBQs.

WOW, really good.  My Mom always made German potato salad, so I was happy to try this recipe.  I remember the "sauce" on my mother's to be thicker, so I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch mixed with a little water.  Came out perfect.  I did add one tsp. of celery seed.  Tasted just like Mom's !!

Perfect.  I boiled my potatoes then peeled them. I added fresh dill too.  One five pound bag of potatoes to a pound of bacon ( less some oil).  I adjusted the sugar too.  Thanks for posting.

When I first finished it I thought  "oh no, it's sweet!"  But by the time I served it several hours later and then some leftovers the next day.......very nice.   I would add more bacon next time.  But, I love bacon.

I have to say I was a bit skeptical but I've wanted to try German Potatoe Salad for a while. I thought this would taste a bit vinegary but it doesn't. This is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I was out of onions and had green onions so I used them. I also used bacon bits for convenience. I will make this again and it will go into my rotation.

I have been searching for an authentic recipe for German potato salad just like my mother made. Her potato salad was the envy of our entire family. Unfortunately she never wrote down her recipes and I thought all was lost until I came upon this recipe. It is exactly like my mother's and brought back many memories of our annual family picnic when family members from far and wide came to have some of Jane's potato salad. It is perfect! Thank you!

This was great! I had never had homemade German potato salad before, just the canned kind, but this was so much better. The only thing I changed was adding a little red wine.

I looked at the suggestions of others and added a teaspoon of celery seed. I also cut the sugar to a little over 1 Tablespoon of sugar. The result was delicious! This will definitely be in my "Make Again" file! One tip - you may have to remove some of the bacon grease.

This is one great recipe.  Tastes just like my mother-in-law's, which my whole family absolutely loved.  I've been trying to find a vegetable dish she made with green beans (from so many years ago, I believe she used canned green beans).  I'll try to phonetically spell what she called the dish.  It was "green beans with browness mail".  Which I believe translates to green beans with brown gravy.  Can any of these great German gals help me out?...Mary Lou LaP

Given my (very) German heritage, family reunions and other potluck gatherings always involved two or three versions of German Potato Salad.  This brings back memories.  It may be a bit sweeter than I remember, so I might try reducing the sugar to 2 tablespoons, instead of three.  Regardless, its very good!

I made this for a recent picnic.  I had to make 30 servings so I did cheat a little and used the round canned potatoes from Costco (worked out great). My dad has raved for years on how his mother is the only person who can make a decent German potato salad and that my step mom's is good but nothing like his moms... When he tried what I made, his first initial taste he was like meh... then once the vinegar kicked in he said wow and several huge servings. He said it almost tastes like his moms and he didn't know I used canned potatoes until after I told him. I was also asked to make it for my girlfriends family reunion the following week after her grandmother tasted it. So it's definitely a winner in our family

I have made potato salads for many years and this is by far the best ever.  Next time I will double it - 1 for me and 1 for the rest!  It is fantastic and so simple.  1 dish to wash and 1 fry pan -- that's it!!

Excellent recipe which doesn't suffer from modifications.  Mayo is not welcome in our home so I looked for a potatoe salad without the added fat.  I also needed flexibility as we wanted to use up ingredients in the fridge before leaving for holidays.  The following substitutions were marvelous:  ham browned in rendered chicken fat in place of bacon, red wine vinegar, cilantro instead of parsley.  Delicious and all gone...yipee....no leftovers!  Everyone loved this so much, I tried it again following the standard recipe skimming away as much bacon fat as  I could.  Again, a hit.  I recommend cubes about 1/2 in or so, as the potatoes then better absorb the vinegar.  Enjoy!

DH and I enjoyed this salad.  My rating is pretty much based on the written recipe.  The directions could be a bit clearer, and there was no specification as to what type of potatoes would be best.  I used red; the texture would certainly be different with russets.  I did take the suggestion of others and only used about a teaspoon of sugar; that was plenty sweet enough.  All in all, this is a good, solid recipe.  Thanks, Angela!

This recipe is great!  I really loved it. I used 3 potatoes diced made a small 3 cups. I believe if you used 6 potatoes its would turn out to be better for a potluck or group event. 3 potatoes seems to be a nice family dinner size for 3 to 4 people.  It smelled different when I added the white viniger but I love the melding of the two tastes of the sweet sugar which balenced out the tartly strong white viniger.  I would recomend this recipe to anyone!

I was looking for a potato salad without the mayo & this salad was delicious! The only thing I did differently was to use polish kielbasa instead of bacon because I did not have bacon on hand. I cut the sausage is small pieces and saute the sausage with sweet onions, then added the rest of the ingredients and potatoes. I also substituted one pkg of stevia for the sugar and it was perfect.

Very good.  The only change I made was to use Apple cider vinegar .  I served this with red cabbage and the Wisconsin bratwurst recipe from this site.  Next time I will slice the potatoes rather then cube, so it will be more like what I have had in German restaurants.

I used 6 strips of bacon, decreased the sugar to 2 tbsp, garnished with scallions and thinly sliced cucumbers. I followed everything else. The only things I would do differently next time is add more cucumber to heighten the flavors and decrease the amount of bacon to 4, as the recipe states. This is a keeper.

I followed this recipe as closely as possible, however the potatoes turned out mushy (I probably should have checked them sooner than the recommended 10 minutes) and it was way too sweet.  I added some more black pepper and salt to try to balance it out more, even a little garlic powder because 3 tbsp of sugar is too much.  I'll let it set for a couple hours to see if the flavor improves.   If I ever make this again I think I will use apple cider vinegar and maybe only 1 tbsp of sugar instead.   It was way too sweet and mushy .

The sugar is what really brings this from good to great. Made this tonight (with schnitzel and spaetzel) and it was a massive hit. Absolutely going to make this again (and again (and again)).

Made the recipe almost exactly as written (I reduced the sugar because i was concerned about it being too sweet) but this potato salad recipe was very bland and somewhat greasy.  It really needs something. Other reviewers have mentioned adding dill, I think that would help. And next time I wouldn't use all the bacon grease, maybe omit it all together and use olive oil to fry the onions. Even though I like all the ingredients in this recipe, I probably won't make it again.

I made this for my husband and me for dinner tonight.  I attempted to halve the recipe and eventhough the vinegar was not to my liking, I will make this again using even less vinegar.

My German wife told me she had eaten the best potato salad ever when she was a kid and her mom made it for their family, however, I raised the bar with my little twist of your recipe.  I was smoking a Boston Butt on my electric smoker and decided to cook my potatoes in an aluminum foil pan beneath the butt.  The combination of pork drippings and the pecan wood smoke on the potatoes made the most awesome potato salad using this recipe that I have ever eaten, and now my wife sometimes goes into my man-cave and clears a path to my man cooker (smoker) to give me a hint that she's wanting me to make another one.

Have been making this my whole life.  My Grandmother and her family were "Pennsylvania Dutch" and this is very close to what she made.  The only differences I could see were that she used whole boiled potatoes,  peeled and chopped after cooled down, and cider vinegar instead of white wine.  These small differences won't make that much difference in taste.   The differences seem to about what they had on hand, the cook's preferences and tweaks, and what their particular families preferred.  But this certainly is the basic recipe.

I can't do eggs.
I found this to be a terrific alternative to the usual mayo dressing salads.  This was part of a summer night salad platter I threw together for an impromptu gathering. No trip to the store for me. I was able to source the ingredients from a sorry looking refrigerator. Keeper.

it was ok, but i cannot eat pork, so i didn't add any bacon. I think the lack of meat is what made me not like it. Im sure if i had some meat, it would be 5 stars. Great recipe!

This was an amazing potato salad recipe! As many other reviewers have stated, I added about 3/4 tsp celery seed. I made a large amount for a picnic (a whole 5# bag of potatoes!) and there was just enough left afterward for me to add to my lunch the next day. This is a safe recipe for a picnic since it doesn't contain cheese or mayo, and I highly recommend it!

I also liked this potato salad but read what others said and decided to modify it. I used 6 large Yukon gold potatoes and boiled them with the skins on in salted water. Covered them with water and about 1 t salt. I used 7 slices of bacon, fried them crisp, and discarded all but about 2 T of bacon grease. One large onion and a couple green onions for color. 1/4 cup plus 2 T vinegar. (I added extra because people said it was dry). 3 T water. 2 t white sugar, and it was plenty sweet. Then 1 t salt and pepper to taste. And parsley for color. I followed the rest of the directions, but put all the crumbled bacon in at once, and poured the sauce over the cubed potatoes. I did this for 6 people and it all went. I could have even made more for leftovers had I known my guests would of went crazy for it. It was DELICIOUS!

Everyone has loved this recipe! I'm now begged to make it for family functions and dinner once a week. I'll never make any other type of potato salad. They only thing I do a little different is add a bit more vinegar! And I always have to triple it

This recipe was wonderful!  I decided to try it instead of the usual mayonnaise based recipe that I use for family gatherings.  My family loved it and everyone has requested the recipe.  There was not a drop left, even though I quadrupled the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again and again.  I used red potatoes so I left the skins on and I used apple cider vinegar because I like the flavor.  Otherwise, exactly like the recipe.

Best potato salad I have ever made. Husband and daughter loved it. So easy. Used only 2 pcs of bacon and added them while everything was in the frying pan, so the bacon didn't have the crunch; but hubby has congestive heart failure so the bacon needs to be less than most recipes. He asked me to make it again and told me what he might also want to have it with. Thanks for posting this.

Have made this particular type of potato salad several times for holidays and special occasions for those who don't care for the mayonnaise based potato salad. The only substitution I used was cider vinegar instead of white and baby gold potatoes .. This recipe is a keeper

I have made this using the method my great aunt Bertha Schunender taught me. She would either slice the potatoes or dice them. She also pointed out to me that there are many different versions. I have also tried a version that my wife's uncle Dieter made for us and it was also quite good.

I absolutely love this recipe...Americans can really benefit from steering away from the mayonnaise/mustard based potato salad by trying this. My mother's mother was from Germany, so my mother's cooking incorporated a lot of German influence.  I remember her making this type of potato salad, but even hers wasn't this good. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was great and a hit on Christmas! I made a few changes- I sliced the potatoes and didn't cook them as long initially, and used about 1/4 teas. stevia instead of sugar.

I thought it was pretty good. A bit sweet I think I may cut down a tad on the sugar next time. My family liked it I hope all the kids at my 5th graders school like it. With the sugar, they probably will.

I have made this several times and it's just the tastiest potato salad ever--German or otherwise! Best made ahead of time, and served at room temperature---or a day ahead, and taken out of the refrig a few hours before serving. We LOVE it!

Doubled the recipe except for the sugar, forgot to save the bacon for the top---didn't matter at all. Served it room temperature--it was outstanding. I would skip peeling the potatoes but my husband doesn't like the skin...such a waste of time peeling them!

I tripled the sauce, because I was not sure how much I would need to cover my potatoes and I did not want to run out. I used a pound of bacon, and I used Russet potatoes. To keep the potatoes from getting "mushy" pop them on a baking sheet in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes, then mix them with the other ingredients. This helps them hold their shape. Everyone loved it!!!

This is a really good recipe. I love the contrast of the vinegar and the sugar. Regular potato salads , the ones made with mayones make my stomach fell heavy and I just don't fell good after eating it but, this potato salad is even refreshing.

I remember my grandmother always making German potato salad for me for all the cook outs (hate mayo based salads). I wanted to make my own and chose this recipe. I can't say it is better then my grandmothers use to be, but I have yet to serve this and not have it loved.

you forgot mustard, german potato salad requires a nice grainy mustard to give it that zing. Also you don't peel  the potatoes and use MUCH less sugar.

I love this recipe.  I only had to change the white vinegar to apple cider vinegar and nix the water, and I am confident that I have my grandmother's lost recipe.  This recipe is awesome and very authentic.

Excellent recipe. This is authentic, my mother makes hers the same way and her mother before her.  And both my grandmother and grandfather came here from Germany.

This was very refreshing and good, but I'm not sure if I like the vinegar taste all that much. Next time I will put a bit less vinegar. Overall flavor was great. I love the onion and bacon mixed with warm potatoes.

This German Potato salad reminds me so much of the one my mother made.  She hadn't shared the recipe w. me, so I am very happy to find this.  Definitely going to make many times.  

Today i made one twist:  instead of parsley, I used cilantro!  Very nice.  I'd already cooked the potatoes.  I did benefit from some comments of the ladies from Germany.  Yes, we don't need so much sugar!  I like the idea of pouring the sauce on the potatoes.  Have the sauce ready to go.  Maybe some broth? Pour over the warm potatoes would be best.  

Mine were cold, but still very yummy.
I think this will be fantastic warm or cold.

I'm saving and adding on Pinterest! Thanks!

I love German Potato Salad and this is very much like I get in my favorite German restaurants. I made it even easier by doing the following: I already had a small bag of petite potatoes which I quartered, boiled for 12 minutes then let cool. I did this earlier in the day. When it was time for dinner, I just sauteed the onion in regular oil, then added the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and pepper as directed. I added the pre-cooked potatoes and some real bacon bits before serving. My husband really enjoyed it as well. Best part..it tasted great even cold the next day. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

I doubled the recipe and found there was way way too much sugar. I am trying to re- create my mother inlaw's recipe. I was sadly disappointed.  I'm not saying it doesn't taste good, but it's not what I was looking for. I had to add vinegar and it needs more parsley and way less sugar

This was very good!!  The only change I made was to add Agave nectar instead of sugar.  It doesn't change the taste.  I have diabetes so Agave nectar works great for me!!!  I will make this recipe again for sure!!!

Absolutely wonderful! I don't care if it is Authentic or not. Everyone of my American family members loved it and they usually don't care for German potato salad. I did add a extra tablespoon of water. The vinegar is not too strong.

I add chopped celery when sauteeing the onion.  Try this trick at the end.  Slice some red radishes and mix them into the top  of your serving dish of potato salad.   The warmth of the potatoes turns the radishes a beautiful rosy pink color.  Also adds crunch.

I've been a member forever and never rated a recipe, but WOW! I did this one by the book (but doubled it) and it's amazing!  Picky hubby loved it too and we have so little left that it is sad! I am hoping it's good cold, but warm was so good I didn't eat the main dish so I could spend all my calories on this! Thanks so much for submitting!

These were very good!  They don't need the bacon, but you can't go wrong with it!  They are very sweet.  We liked them alot, but I may try using less sugar next time.

We used white wine vineger but it was a bit strong. Next time I will use less or try it with regular white vineger like the recipe said. We had to use packaged bacon bits but real bacon with the grease is the ticket. This is very close to the potato salad my grandmother used to make. She was born and raised in Germany so Im sure this is very very close to the real deal.

Good recipe.  Only gave it four stars because the recipe calls for way too much sugar.  I would say 1 tablespoon would be plenty.  I would also add a little mustard seed or celery seed.  Also, be careful to not reduce the sauce too much.

My husband comes from a Very German family and he was craving some German Potato Salad.  I have never made it and have only eaten it once and was not too impressed.  So I picked one that had the most stars and I have to say this was so easy and delicious.  My husband said it was better than his Mom's.  I did add extra bacon and used less sugar after reading the other comments and added some celery seed because this seems similar to a spinich salad I make and we love the taste the celery seeds gives that and it seemed to work well for this too.  Totally added this to my recipe box and will make over and over

Just made this for a dinner tonight, tastes GREAT. I substituted red potatoes and red onions, and left the skins on the potatoes. Used a good hearty pepper bacon from my local farmer's market, and it's absolutely perfect!

I loved how simple this recipe was.  I normally don't make potato salad, as I hate the mashed potato appearance it tends to make after being mixed.  To avoid that with this recipe, I boiled the potatoes the night before I made the salad.  That made the slicing easier on the cooled potatoes.  I also doubled the amount of sauce and it turned out perfectly.  I LOVE this recipe!

Star-wise, what I made was more like a 2-star, but I don't want to ruin the submitter's rating because admittedly I did make some changes based on some of the other reviews.  I used 1 1/2 times the vinegar and water due to the complaints about there not being enough "sauce/dressing," and I cut the sugar by 1/2 T. because of the reviewers that thought this was too sweet.  My big problem with this recipe was that the dressing never soaked into the potatoes - it just pooled in the bottom of the pan, even when the  potatoes were completely reheated.  I finally added cornstarch to thicken it up so it would "cling" to the potatoes.  The end result was just ok.  I've had much better german potato salads before.  However, maybe my end result was something I did wrong, so hence the 4-star rating.

OK - so I am in search of a potato salad that is low-fat, even non-fat would be good. So I decided to try and make this without bacon or bacon fat. I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar based on other reviews, and I still found it a little sweet for my taste. I will keep looking...

Authenticity is in the kitchen from whence you grew up! It was great! Only change I make was adding 1Tbs of corn starch to the water before I added to the heated sauce. Helps sauce cling to the potatoes. BTW potatoes were not introduced to Germany until the late 15Th century.

This was absolutely amazing.  I had some good sausage and wanted a perfect german meal.  I made this potato salad exactly as the recipe says to (except for an extra strip of bacon, I live in hog country afterall), red cabbage and apples which I let the sausage simmer in after grilling, and I think it was the best meal I've ever eaten.  That was over a year ago.  I've made the same meal many times since, and we always look forward to it.

For my own variation, I substituted 1/2 of the called for white vinegar for balsamic (only because i ran out of white vinegar) and was pleasantly surprised.   I also only used 1 tablespoon sugar, as suggested by other reviews, rather than 3 and was very glad that I did so.   lastly, i sliced my potatoes verses dicing them.   Overall what a great recipe!

YUM-O!!  This was a nice change from the mayo based potato salad.  I used less onion and less sugar.  I definitely will be making this again.

This went well at our family picnic. I did add more bacon, and lessened the amount of onion it called for.

I couldn't give this 5 stars only because it was much sweeter than I would like. I even cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons. There is a chance that the sweetness is due to the onion I used (shallot--grocery store was out of small yellow onions.)  I would definitely make this again.

This was a hit at my 4th of July party.  I took other's advise and didn't add quite as much sugar and it turned out perfect!  We had ribs, cream cheese and jalepeno stuffed burgers, baked beans and so much more and so many people said this was their favorite!

This is just what I was looking for...I was in the mood for German potato salad (which should not even be called potato salad because it is WAY different and WAY better than what most people think of when they here "potato salad"). SOOO GOOD!...and pretty easy too! I will make this again and again. My husband, who had never had German potato salad before, loved it as well. Thanks for the recipe! :-)

Very good. However, I boiled the potatoes whole, then peeled and diced them, so they wouldn't get to mushy.

Sooo good!  The only thing I did differently was to throw the finished product in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. Oh & I only used about 1/4 of an onion, but that is only because I am not a big fan. Will totally make again...

My family LOVED this recipe and I think with the addition of a little dijon mustard it would be perfect.  It was gone way before any of the other leftovers from our dinner and I am sure to use this one again. Next time I make it, I will cut down a little on the onions.

german potato salad is an all around favorite with most who have tried it. This recipe is similar to my best friends family recipe (my alltime favorite!). She uses white pepper to taste also fresh purple onion (raw and chopped fine)

My parents made a BBQ last weekend and asked me to bring a potato salad. They are mayo freaks, and I wanted to prove them that you can eat a great potato salad without it. I made this recipe with a 5 pounds bag of potatoes for 11 people and it was a hit. By the way, this recipe deserves a better picture, mine looked delicious, I decorated it with fresh parsley leafs.

Wanting to use some potatoes up before heading out of town, I decided to try this. My only changes were to use 6 slices of bacon, half a small onion, and no parsley. It wasn't bad, but I think I prefer creamy-and-cold potato salads. I'll try it again when my mom visits, she likes warm potato salad. Thanks for sharing, SchoolBee123, I was glad to give it a try!

I followed directions exactly except I added some celery seed. It was only ok. I think it needs some flour to thicken up the mix. I will find a different recipe next time.

So yummy even my kids ate it. Just like I remember eating as a child when my German grandma used to come visit. Update: My family loves this recipe so much we have to double it just to barely make enough to go around. You should totally make this potato salad.

This was easy to make and tasted good, but lacked a little something for me. I added some dill relish and dry mustard and it was excellent. The dry mustard seemed to tone down the vinegar.

Absolutely great!  This was my first taste and attempt with a German potato salad and my family very impressed.  A nice blend of sour and sweet with great flavour from the browned onion and bacon.  I used baby (roasting) mixed colour potatoes, halved with skins on, which gave the salad an interesting variation.

This was really great potato salad and a wonderful alternative to a mayo based salad.   Was a huge hit with the brats we had at a mini Octoberfest!

This was the first time I tried a German Potato Salad recipe.  I was very pleased with the results.  The only change I made was to add 1 tsp of celery seed.  I will be definitely making this one on a regular basis.

Das Gut!  My husband is from Denmark, just 20 minutes north of the German border is where he grew up.  I made this for him, and he "liked it".  He is not much for words, but he went back for seconds and then finished it off the next day.  And I loved this potato salad too!  Will make again and again!

My DH loves German potato salad and I have been looking for a good recipe.  He liked this one a lot but I thought it needed something more, I don't know what though.

This recipe was so good that I "sampled" half of it while making it. I could not stop "tasting" it. I will have to make this again just so my family can enjoy equal portions.

I made this recipe for a church picnic.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and when I got in line to get the sides at the picnic, I was not surprised to see that this potato salad was the first to go.  Everyone raved about it and wants the recipe.  Even my boyfriend loved it and he is a really picky eater.  Thanks for such a great and yummy recipe.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Received rave reviews for this dish at a gathering of friends.  Cheated and used pre-cooked bacon - still turned out great!
