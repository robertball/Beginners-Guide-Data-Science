Great salad! I added fresh mushrooms and served the feta on the side. Used a small can of mandarin oranges , drained.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used one bag of spinach and 1 bag of romaine to add different textures and colors. I also used chopped walnuts instead of almonds because I had them on hand. It was a very colorful salad and everyone loved it at our Mother's Day dinner. The 2 bags of lettuce were enough for 10 people- plus seconds! Simple and delicious salad! Thanks!

Wow!! I use a bag of spring greens and used raspberry vinagrette instead of the Italian. This is a very refreshing salad and is now my favorite--everyone loved it!!

This salad came out okay when I first made it... However, it DOES NOT store well, so plan on serving it all within a couple hours of making it!

I was about to use a vinegarette dressing when my dinner date said no use the Italian- he was so right!  Make the recipe as it's written!  It's great!

Very good!  I used the prepackaged roasted sliced original flavored almonds from the store.  I also used madarin oranges in a jar so it would be quick.  Very easy and very tasty.
