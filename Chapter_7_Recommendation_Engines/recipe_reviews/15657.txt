I thought this recipe was excellent, the only thing I did different was I used graham crackers for the crust.

Mmm... this is very good.  I made it in a pie plate and cut in half b/c I didn't have enough to do the whole recipe.  I probably used more nuts in the crust.  I did enough nuts and cherries to cover the top.  Will definitely make this again soon-- the whole recipe!

Made this for Mother's Day and it was a big hit. The crust is basically shortbread. You could easily change up the pudding to chocolate and it would still be great.

Best pie I've had in a long time!  I love creamy no-bake pies, and this one was perfect.  Instead of making the crust, I just used a graham cracker crust.  I skipped the nuts on top, and instead chopped a jar of maraschino cherries in my food chopper and stirred them into the whipped cream before topping the pie with it.  To.  Die.  For.

Have been making and eating this recipe for a long time!! Great hit every time made. It is also great with other flavors, just leave the cherries off, and use whatever flavor of pudding you like. Yummy, and easy to make!!!

I modified the portions of this recipe quite a bit, and actually used it to make two very different pies.  I used the whole recipe of the white bottom, and half in a graham cracker crust and half in an Oreo crust.  I used 1 pistachio pudding and 1 chocolate pudding and put the pistachio in the graham cracker crust and the chocolate in the Oreo crust.  Topped the Oreo pie with cool whip and Heath Bar crumbles, topped the pistachio pie with cool whip mixed with chopped up cherries.  They're in the freezer right now, interest to see which will be more popular tomorrow!
