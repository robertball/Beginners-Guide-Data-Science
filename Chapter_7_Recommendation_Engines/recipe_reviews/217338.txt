Used pan fish instead of walleye and it was delicious!  It also was an easy way to make fish for a bunch of people as we made a couple of pans at the same time.  This will be a regular recipe for us going forward.  Thanks for posting!

Really easy and sooo good. I went a little heavier on the lemon pepper. It was perfect with a good white wine!! Now I am craving it again :-).

It's quick and easy, but the combination of Basil and Lemon Pepper didn't really accentuate the natural flavor of Walleye

I didn't use the lemon pepper because mine was expired by 4 years.. but i had fresh lemons and fresh ground pepper... i think the basil wasn't really necessary. I would make it again... maybe skip the basil

What a great technique for cooking walleye!  I used lemon, pepper, and Greek seasoning (what I had on hand) and loved the simplicity.  Good walleye doesn't need much more.  My only problem is my husband brought home a huge fish, so it took triple the time to cook.  I can't wait to make this again with normal sized filets!

LOVED it!  Nice change from fried walleye.  Will try on other fish for sure!  I did add salt.

Excellent recipe! This was so fast  and easy to make. My husband loved it. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I sprinkled two teaspoons of lemon juice over the fish. For spices I used ground pepper, salt, and Herbs de Province. I will make this again.

This was a wonderful way to bake walleye.  It was so flaky.  Instead of the lemon pepper I used a spice blend that I had on hand which included fine and course sea salt, lemon peel, lavendar buds, and basil leaf.  To that I added fresh ground black pepper.  This was a big hit and I will absolutely make it again!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  My Walleye fillets were quite large so it took a little longer than the directions said, but I will definitely  make this again.

Very simple, very flavorable!! Instead of walleye-I used halibut & it was very good! I'd make it again.

I was extremely short on time and this recipe fit the bill!!!!  5 stars for simplicity and 5 stars for flavor with so little ingredients. PERFECT as is although I did not cut my filets.  I baked them approximately 9 minutes and they were perfectly moist!  Give it a try.  Thanks for the recipe!

The basil and Lemon Pepper didn't really meld well with the Walleye. I understand wanting a simple recipe but salt and pepper would have been better than this combination.

I preheated oven to 450 put 2/3 of the butter in the pan with aluminum foil, spread the butter evenly with the spoon then place to fish down, poor remainder of butter over filets, seasoned with chef Paul's blackened Redfish magic and black pepper. cooked for 10 minutes it was flaky and moist.

So easy. I used fresh lemon juice and fresh ground black pepper.  If the  fish is not very thick, I suggest reducing the baking time by a minute or two.

I made it as prescribed with the addition of a few onion slices added and found it to be as billed; fast, easy, and terrific in all regards.  The basil wasnt prominent so i might beef that up a bit and i might also experiment with adding a tomato slice or two.   I am going to try this out out with halibut next.    thank you!
