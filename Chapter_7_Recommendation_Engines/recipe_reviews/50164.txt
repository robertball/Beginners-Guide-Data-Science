Loved it!  Made a lot more ice Guava cubes and put them in an ice bucket for serving.  Used boiling water to dissolve the tea and honey better (which gave it a more brewed flavor as well) and added guava nectar to the tea mixture.  Yum! The Peach nectar is also good in this.

This recipe was okay.  I could taste the instant tea pretty strongly, but others liked it and did not have a problem with the taste.  Next time, I will brew tea instead of using instant.  At my luau, it definitely was not preferred over the pina colada punch recipe from this site.
