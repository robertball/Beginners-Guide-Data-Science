The steaks only marinated half of the recommended time and while some of the flavor did manage to pop up a small amount, there needs to be something else here. We added seasoning salt, fresh cracked pepper and steak sauce. Won't be trying again.

I marinaded in whisky for 12 hours and marinade over powered the steak. Also, needs other seasonings. This one will not go into my recipe box.

Not sure why this one has low reviews...I soaked mine in Chivas and these were tender, moist and to-die-for. I will most definitely be making these again. I ate mine with a touch of homemade horseradish that we buy from a little joint bar about an hour away and man-O-man...YUM! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I used 1/2 cup of whiskey and 1/2 cup of low salt soy sauce for the marinate; I turned the meat and pierced with fork a couple of times during  the marination.  Let the meat set at room temp for 20-30 minutes between the refrigerator and hot grill.  I sprinkle with garlic salt after I turned them on the grill.
