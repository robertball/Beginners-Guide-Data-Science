Made this last night with fresh strawberries at the peak of their season. It's light, not too sweet and oh-so-tasty. Even my husband, who normally won't eat strawberries, had only good things to say. I did not find it dry at all, it just tasted like cornmeal, as one would expect. As a side note, I used regular (i.e. bleached) flour and vanilla yogurt because that's what I had on hand, and these worked fine. Simply a perfect way to use those summer strawberries!

I think most of the other reviewers have summed it up pretty well...with this cake is great! My only additional comment would be that it makes a great tasting gluten-free cake as well. I used a gluten-free flour mix instead of AP flour and the results were excellent. Thank you Jen for sharing this recipe with us.

I love this recipe and so does everyone I feed it to. For a twist, use blue cornmeal rather than the regulation yellow.

This is such a great cake!  I've been wanting to try it for some time now and finally got around to it.  I am glad I did!  Very good texture & perfect flavor.  It was the right amount of not too sweet, had a dense sponge cake texture, and the perfect hint of cornmeal.  The only thing I changed was to sub sour cream for the yogurt since I was out.  The fresh strawberries (or any fresh berries) are a must, so don't leave them out.  The Hubster loved this cake!  Served with a scoop of vanilla/strawberry ice cream.  Yummy!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Oh, how delightful!  I wanted to use up some yogurt and cornbread, so I input those two ingredients into the recipe finder and this is what came up.  It's like a dense, sweet cornbread.  I used frozen blueberries because I wanted to save my fresh strawberries for another dish.  I also try to avoid using white sugar, so instead I put in 2/3c. of brown sugar.  I had a slice with some vanilla ice cream while it was still just slightly warm and it was delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

This was really good!  I made it in the spring before strawberries were available, so I tried it with a package of frozen cranberries and it was delicious....  Also, used my "bloody butcher" cornmeal (red).  We plan to try it with strawberries, but I'm sure any fresh fruit would be good.

I doubled this recipe and it came out okay.  It tasted more like cornbread with strawberries.  Didn't go over too well with my kids and the neighborhood kids, but husband's co-worker's ate it.  I don't think I'll make this again.

I only had strawberry flavoured yoghurt in my fridge so I used it in place of plain yoghurt. I also did not have fresh strawberries. maybe it's due to the lack of the sliced fresh strawberries that my cake turned out to be dry. but i'll try again, this time with the strawberries. :)

This delicious, relatively healthy cake was easy to make and, oh so good! I used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, frozen strawberries, and added two heaping tablespoons of applesauce since other reviews said the cake was a bit dry. With the applesauce added, it was perfectly moist.

I did not care for it.  I tried using blueberries and it was not too good.  Maybe strawberries will be better.  Ill try it again.

I went with blue corn meal, blueberry yogurt, blueberries and a combo of sugar and honey...absolutely amazing! Served with blueberry yougurt and whip cream on top - great presentation and great way to end the evening's meal.

This is a really good recipe.  The flavor is nice.  The texture is nice.  The only problem that I had with it was that the strawberries all sank to the bottom of the pan.  Also, the recipe should probably be more specific about what kind of corn meal can be used (white or yellow).  It might not matter.  Anyway, This one is going in the recipe box.

This had a delicious taste and texture--it was a lot like a New England style cornbread with vanilla and fruit added. Our only complaint was that it was too sweet. If you don't like supersweet foods, just cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it will be perfect. Also, you can use any type of berry and the recipe still works even if the berries are frozen.

First, I made this the way the recipe was written.  It was nice, but very sweet, and maybe a bit on the drier side. No I make this with cutting the sugar to 3/4 cup if you don't like things overly sweet, or to make it even better, use 1/2 cup of honey instead of the sugar and also 2 heaping tbsp. of unsweetened applesauce for a moister texture.

I really enjoyed this cake. I used Vanilla Activia, since that is what I had and added a little cinnamon (I adore cinnamon). I also coated my strawberries in a small amount of flour to keep them from dropping to the bottom of the batter. It definitely has a cornmeal/cornbread taste and texture, but I love that. It was sweet, but I did not think it was overly sweet. It might be slightly dry, more like a bread than a cake. I will be making again.

A really lovely cake! Moist and flavoursome without being overly sweet. I used some extra sliced strawberries and arranged them over the top before baking but it didnt last long enough to have a photo taken :)

Mmm...this was very good, but I love the texture that cornmeal gives in cakes. Not as moist as most cakes either. Worth a try.

The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 cup.  I made two cakes - super easy to make and really delicious!  Perfect recipe for early summer, when fresh strawberries are in abundance.   I’ll make this again, for sure!

I substituted almond flour for the all purpose flour, and all else was the same.  It ran all over the oven from the 9" cake pan, and wouldn't release after cooling for 30 minutes as directed.  It tasted great, but would fill pan only half full and make muffins from the extra batter.  Would also put parchment on the bottom of the cake pan.

This was delicious!  I decreased sugar and only added one cup (instead of 1 1/4 cup) and also added an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup extra strawberries.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This cake is yummy.  I made one and a half times the measurements and cooked it in a 9 x13 pan. Just the right amount of sweet with that grit of cornmeal that I love. I wish I had whipping cream around.

Outstanding cake!  I made this for a family Easter dinner, and I also made an old standby dessert as a backup in case we didn't like the cake--but this cake was the surprise hit with everyone and was completely consumed!  I was worried that it was too plain or would be dry, but it was just perfect:  moist and delicious, simple and pretty, and the cornmeal texture made it unique.  I was asked for the recipe and was happy to share.  I did leave out the salt to reduce sodium, and I used unsalted margarine in place of butter.  I layered my strawberries in the middle of the cake, as I saw in one of the photos here, instead of stirring into the batter.  Thank you!  This will become a standard.
