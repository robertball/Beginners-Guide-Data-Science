I haven't made this recipe, just wanted to comment about using the leftover mayonnaise, cheese mixture for dipping.  I would make a seperate serving of this for dipping, wouldn't want to get food poisoning!  I plan on making this dish and will make extra for dipping.

My family had mixed reviews about this recipes. Some liked it and some didn't.  I thought it was good but next time I will season the cornflake crumbs for more flavor.  As suggested in other reviews I cut the mayonaise in half and it worked out well.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  My boyfriend loved this chicken, and said that this elevated my cooking status to "very good" now.  My 3-year old nephew who is a very picky eater loved it, too.  I let him help with the cooking by crushing the corn flakes into crumbs for me (after washing his hands thoroughly.)  He had a ball.  I used one tblsp of regular mustard and one tblsp of dijon, and it gave it a little extra "zing".

It was great.  My husband don't like chicken but ate this.  Very moist, I had to hold dinner a little longer in the oven and it still turned out great. I also added a few extra spices to the flakes only becasue I like spicy foods.

I only used about 1/2c. of mayo and that was plenty.  I liked it but my husband thought the mayo made it a bit too rich although he still enjoyed it.  My husband thought adding mushrooms would be nice so I will do that next time I make it.  Overall, it was quick and easy and inexpensive to make so it's a keeper.

Kind of bland, kind of soggy. It definitely needs a kick of something! I probably won't make this again. Not enough flavor.

This was delicious!!!  We made some changes, used 1/2 cup mayo instead of full cup; used honey mustard instead of yellow mustard; used "Shake-N-Bake" instead of corn flakes; and we baked in on a cooling rake on a cookie sheet for about 40 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!!!

This is a really quick, easy baked chicken recipe.  My husband hates dry baked chicken, so I was leary to make this, but it turned out super-moist (even better leftover).  I do think that it was a bit rich - you could probably use a little less mayo, or something a litter lighter (maybe a light sour cream or light mayo), but otherwise this was great!  I did add some spices to the mayo mixture to give it a little kick (some ceyanne pepper/various spices).  Will definitely make again!

This was very easy to make and it tasted ok--but a bit bland.  My husband liked it, but I am not a huge fan of chicken, so it did little for me.

We thought this recipe was great.  There is too much mayo mixture but you can always use it as a dipping sauce.  This recipe had plenty of flavor with mustard and parmesean cheese.  Will make again and again.

This was good juicy chicken but a little bland.  I only used half the mayo mixture, but I did not use as a dip.  Did not want the extra calories.   I may try this coating for chicken burgers.  I think it would be good on a bun with condiments.

This was wonderful!!! I made this with my 10 year old daughter. It was moist, flavorful, and yet still crispy due to the corn flake crumbs. I used seasoned salt, onion powder, and some basil flakes in the corn flakes for color. Everyone loved it. This is a new favorite at our house and I am sure it will be made time and time again. Don, Thank You So Much!

The recipe was ok. It was quick and easy but honestly, it tasted like I was eating a deviled egg. The mayo/mustard mixture is the reason. I like deviled eggs but when I eat chicken, I want to eat chicken. Great recipe for kids. My kids ate it right up.

I was looking for a recipe that used cornflakes (I was looking to free up some space in my cabinets) and found this quick and easy one.  This dish turned out great, but I did make some adjustments. For the mayo mix, I used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1 tbsp mustard, 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder. After dipping the chicken in the mayo & cornflakes I sprinkled some seasoning salt put the chicken on a tinfoil lined cookie sheet that I lightly sprayed with cooking oil and baked at 400 for 20 minutes.  Yummy.  What I loved most is was a quick and yummy dinner that I had on the table in no time.

Amazing chicken!!!!! I made a few adjustments like mixing the cheese with the corn flakes instead of the mayo/ mustard mixture and I made separate dipping sauce so there would be no raw chicken contamination. My family, including my 3 yr old, LOVED this chicken. I will def be making this again.

I honestly wasn't expecting too much - but this recipe is great, the chicken stays really moist.  I've made this several times, and will continue to keep it in our rotation.  I leave it almost completely as written, except we don't use the mayo mix for dipping sauce, so I cut down the mayonnaise a ton and sometimes add a little paprika to the corn flake crumbs for some extra flavor.

Won't make this again.  Chicken was very very bland, half of the cornflakes fell off and got soggy in the bottom of the pan.  I have no idea how this got a 4.5 star rating.

I followed the recipe. I cooked for a little longer because of the size of the chicken breasts. My son wanted seconds....always a good sign!

Ever since I found this recipe I've been making it at least once a month. Use grated parmesean. Crush frosted flakes in a bag. It works best with a big bag of frozen chicken breasts like Tyson. I thaw them, then dry and dip in mixture and into flakes bag. Sprinkle extra cheese and flakes on top. It turns out like a salty sweet. If you like that type of food you will love this. B generous with the coatings.

This is really a very wonderful starting recipe… I made a few changes. First of all after patting my chicken dry, I sprinkled it liberally on both sides with onion powder and only on one side with seasoned salt. To the mayonnaise, I added honey mustard salad dressing along with a dollop of Dijon mustard, as well as garlic powder and onion powder. I had only a fourth of a bag of corn flakes, a fourth of a bag of crispy rice and some potato chips. So to save the day, I combined all three together...mashed it up nice and good. I then added seasoned salt as well as onion powder and garlic powder. I've made this once before and it turned out wonderfully. LOL I'm making it again right now. And yes if you choose to do it at 400°, may want to make sure it's good and done, therefore making it until at least 40 minutes, if not 45 minutes. Always keep an eye on your chicken, though!

I made this as chicken tenders for my grandchildren, and we all loved it.  They request it often when they come to visit.  Goes well with homemade mac and cheese.

So good! I added honey, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of old bay seasoning to the sauce before the corn flakes. I used special K (what I had). It is out of this world

It was good but I added garlic salt to the corn flakes, I salt and peppered the chicken before I brushed the mayo mixture on and to the mayo mixture I added Franks Red Hot Sauce. The family liked it.

We just enjoyed this chicken recipe tonight and thought it was delicious!  I did add freshly ground garlic pepper to the chicken before dipping in the cornflakes, though. Next time I'll try 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain yogurt.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I used 1/2 the mayo and Emeril's Horseradish Mustard! Didn't have cornflakes so I used honey nut clusters mixed with a bit of potato flakes.  Added chopped fresh garlic to the sauce because I love garlic.  This is awesome!

I was a little nervous at first to try this recipe after reading some of the reviews. I tweaked it a little bit to give it some flavoring. I stuffed the chicken breast with pepper jack cheese and added some garlic powder. I thought it turned out great! Very moist! I will definitely make it again

I had 8 chicken breasts, so doubled recipe... but this resulted in way more mixture than needed, but surprisingly less cornflake crumbs than necessary.  Nonetheless, chicken turned out moist and yummy - even my fussy kids liked it.
