I made this recipe for my co-workers this year.  It was the most disappointing and embarrassing gift I have ever given.  The ingredients that you layer are all white, with the exception of the   M & M's.  This means that all of the flour and sugar mixtures take over the one colorful part of this mix.  The final product was very disappointing to look at but the cookies were tasty and the children of my co-workers really enjoyed them.

I haven't baked the cookies but I was very disappointed with the way the ingredients looked layered in the jar - first of all too many white ingredients and  when you layer the candies under the flour, the flour falls down between the candies so you can not even see what little colour there was - also I bought enough ingredients to make 12 jars - it turned out to be very expensive! $25.00 for the candy coated chocolate! Very disappointing.

I found this to be too dry.  I added 2 Tablespoons of milk and it did the trick.  Also the M & M's need to be placed on the top for the layering in a jar because the sugar seeps through the candies.  A good cookie.

The recipe is super simple which I love and it looks great in the jar.  I made all the Cookie Mix in a Jar recipes and this is the only one my family wasn't crazy over.

Dough was so dry, I had to add a tablespoon of milk.  Cookies were a little tastless and dry

These cookies were too dry & crunchy, with not much flavor.  I think they need more butter or something; dough was very stiff & dry.

I am sorry but these cookies turned out terribly.  I was going to make jars of these cookies to give to friends as gifts.  I am glad I tried the recipe out ahead of time because now I know I would have been embarrased.  Now I have time to get another recipe.
