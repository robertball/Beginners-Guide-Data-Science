Used turkey sausage, which made the flavor phenomenal.  Also used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, olive oil instead of butter, and whole wheat penne pasta.  Easy ways to make the recipe a little more healthy. :)

This was quick and easy to make, I had to make it with ground beef instead of pork but my kids enjoyed it.
