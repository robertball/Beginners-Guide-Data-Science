OMG!  The absolutely best muffins I've ever had (and I've been making muffins weekly for over a year now).  Don't expect some light and fluffy bakery style muffin.  These are dense and velvety.  If you don't LOVE peanut butter - don't bother.  Oh, I did make the following substitutions:  whole wheat instead of APF, brown sugar and only 1/2 cup, and natural peanut butter.

I am not usually a fan of brand sponsored recipes, but this one is delicious! It is dense, but that is how I like it! The crumble on top really makes this muffin excellent.

Love Love Love these!!!  Used Splenda instead of sugar and used coconut instead of nuts because I was out of walnuts.  Only problem with these is that I'll end up eating the whole batch very very quickly!!  :)

I love peanut butter and I love banana. It was a brilliant idea to make muffin out of them! I was contemplating what I should make with my two large, almost-ready-to-be-tossed bananas and I'm glad to pick this one. I wanted something other than regular banana bread, and this fits the bill! Because I didn't have enough banana for 1 cup I just halved the recipe (6 muffins) and used more than 1/2 C of banana and about 1T more peanut butter (always use natural), and of course, less sugar. Omitted the dates and I'm sure I didn't miss out a lot. Very delicious muffins (they are dense) and I will for sure make them again. I can't believe it's got no oil or butter! Next time I will try adding oats. **Edit: So I forgot about adding oats, but made them again with cocoa powder. Decreased amount of flour (and used WW instead AP), and added about 1/4C of cocoa (eyeballed, not exact measurement). Also used 3 large bananas with 1t banana extract, and used chunky natural peanut butter, as well as almond milk. Added about 3/4 baking soda, while still leaving out the dates. Had to cook longer than 30 min because there was more liquid "I think".. Anyhow they turned out very yummy! ** Another time I made this with hazelnut butter (all natural) and apple pieces (no nuts/dates) and it was even BETTER than with peanut butter! Expensive, but worth it!!

Pretty good, but a different texture than expected. I might leave out the dates next time - I like dates, but they seemed out of place here. Had to bake for longer than the recipe recommended, using a nonstick pan and paper muffin tin liners.

These were exceptionally sweet!  I loved the peanut butter, but I may omit the dates next time.  I did what other posters had said and scaled back the sugar to 1/2 cup as well.

I usually steer away from the commercial brand recipes but I gave these a try and they were delicious! Very moist and sweet. For those with less of a sweet tooth you could definitely reduce the sugar.

WOW...we LOVED these muffins!  They are  hearty and dense with FANTASTIC peanut butter flavour (if you don't like PB, you won't enjoy these!).  I used all natural crunchy PB, therefore left out the walnuts (which I likely wouldn't add anyway as my kids wouldn't eat them with walnuts)!  I scaled back the sugar to 1/2 cup as others noted and I left out the dates as they really seemed out of place to me.  Threw in a small handful of mini chocolate chips and mixed all ingredients together instead of reserving a cup and doing the topping step (was short on time!).  A definite repeat, thank you :)

I really like these.  I made them without the dates or walnuts, and with 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Very nice flavor.

I think the bake time of 28-30 minutes is too long.  Next time I make them I will take them out at 25 minute.  They are very tasty though!

Great.  I would skip the crumble on top next time because it made them way too messy for my kids.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and skipped the dates and walnuts.  I also use whole wheat flour.

Tried this recipe this week and it was fantastic. The only change I made was substituting chocolate chips for dates and whole wheat flour for all purpose. As one reviewer said, these are not the fluffy, airy cupcake style muffins. Our family does not like those style muffins. These are dense, rich and incredibly delicious.

Great taste and texture, with crunch on the outside and very moist inside.  Watch the oven temp, it seems a little high.  I would suggest 350 for 25-30 min, and check the muffins early.

I made these because they are high calorie, high protein and nutritious. Perfect as snacks or a breakfast addition for my kids who need that right now. Unfortunately I think they are tasty, my kids do not. It might be because I used natural peanut butter so they are less sweet and more dense. It might also be because the dates add a mushy texture without adding flavor. I am going to try these again but will replace the dates with raisins or craisins and finely chop the walnuts so they don't stand out so much.

followed this recipe fairly closely, and it came out great!! i did change a few minor things: 1) omitted the dates because i didn't have any, 2) cut the sugar to 1/2C and did half brown/half white, and 3) cut the cook time to 25mins. can't wait to bring these into work! i might try to convert this recipe to bread to gift for the holidays...

I loved these! Moist, and not overly sweet. The crumb topping made for a nice finish to the muffins. This recipe made 24 mini muffins. Substitutions: Gluten Free Baking Mix for the flour, Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar. Omitted: Nuts, dates and flax (didn't have any).

I made so many changes to the recipe, but it still turned out great. First, I used Hemp milk and omitted the egg to make it Vegan. I substituted pumpkin for the banana (an excellent egg substitute) and added a little extra flax (also a great egg substitute). I used whole wheat and my husband didn't notice, which tells me it's a great recipe! I will definitely be using it again. :)

Excellent. I used diced almonds/pumpkin seeds in the place of other nuts and went with a streusel topping, instead of more peanut butter mix, in order to sweeten things up a bit. I also used a non-branded, natural peanut butter, but I'm sure the taste and texture were not adversely affected by the substitution. The muffin's texture was thick and hearty, like a bran muffin, yet still moist and varied due to the nuts and dates. The taste is similar to a peanut buttery banana nut muffin or bread. I've had two of these each morning since first making them, and they are just enough to fill you up until lunch rolls around.

These are excellent!! I used almond milk and also added about a 1/4 cup of wheat germ. These are so healthy and so delicious.
