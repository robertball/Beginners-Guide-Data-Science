Par-boiling the gizzards really defeated the whole purpose. YOu need to marinade gizzards overnight in either buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt so the toughness is broken down naturally and absorbs the tangyness of the marinade.  Add a couple dashes hotsauce to the marinade and we're talking YUM!  Plus the marinade helps the flour coating stick better and become puffier.  Also add some pepper, a touch of cayenne and msg to the flour (I know everyone is anti-msg, but it really is needed to get the right flavor here.

I've been making chicken gizzards like this for years.  One thing I do differently is to boil them for about an hour, and season the water with salt/pepper/garlic powder.  It makes them tasty, and tender.  Great recipe though!!!

Well I used 2 lbs of gizzards instead of 1.5 lbs. I doubled the garlic powder cuz I like garlic darnit. I also changed the boiling time to around 45 minutes. They get very tender the longer you boil them. And rather than a frying pan I used my deep fryer to flash fry. I used an egg wash to get the flour mixture to stick to the gizzards better. I only deep fried them long enough for the batter to fry to a golden brown. Usually around 30 to 45 seconds. I realized I had quite a bit of egg wash left over as well as the flour mixture. So I dropped some egg wash into the flour and made a dough out of it. I also deep fried the dough balls but a little bit longer to make sure they cooked all the way thru. I then crumbled them up into a hot frying pan and added the remaining egg wash to make scrambled eggs. I served those with the gizzards and believe me it was a fantastic meal. The pepper made it a little spicy but I like that. So all I changed was the boiling time, added a bit more garlic pepper and, deep fried instead of pan fried. Delicious.

Good recipe. I did have one problem tho. The breading would not stay on the chicken :(  I was so mad, but still ate them. Any tips on preventing this?

But all-in-all a good recipe, maybe it was just me with the breading problem.

Thanks,
Tyler

The Gizzards need to be boiled with MSG or some other meat tenderizer and also I use chicken boullion and garlic powder to boil them in. Gives them the extra flavour that the plain water removes.  The other trick to keeping the batter on is to make sure the gizzards are completely cooled (run under very cold water until cool) and YES I also dip them in a beaten egg with a few drops of water added to the egg mixture. I also add a few drops of hot pepper sauce to the egg mix. Next, I add about 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs to  the flour and spice mix, and this produces the most deeeeeelish treat when fried.  Hope you try this and enjoy!

This was a total disaster.  The Par boiling time was way too long and the frying time was way too long.  After Par-Boiling I noticed the Gizzards were too tough at the 15 minute time period.  When frying, I found the browning time too long also and then the covered time was excessively way too long.

The gizzards were good except I put them in egg before I put the flour on, it makes the flour stick better.  Also, I deep fried them.  Faster cooking.

The time recommended for this recipe is a bit long for my taste. This recipe makes the gizzards VERY dry and crispy. I would recommend cutting the boil & fry time in half. Otherwise this recipe is great! I especially like the added touch of the garlic powder. I like garlic so I doubled the amount.

The ingredients are Okay, but the deep frying isn't necessary.  This is how it was fried in my Spanish family for over 50 years.  Rinse the gizzards.  Put the flour in a zip-lock bag with the S&P.  Add the gizzards and toss until thorougly coated. Shake off excess flour and fry on medium heat in 2-1/2 TBS olive oil along with some diced onion & 1 garlic clove.  When browned, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  Bring to a boil, lower heat to low, cover fry pan and simmer for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. The gizzards will be very tender, and flavorful.  YUMMO.  You can sub garlic salt in flour, for the garlic clove in oil.

Recipe should include a moisture wash for coating, which I did with the egg, a little water and the hot sauce. Big problem here is the parboiling which I think takes out a lot of the flavor of the gizzards themselves. The coating was good but I missed the natural flavors.

If you arent a seasoned cook, you wouldnt know to wet the gizzards in one way or another before coating with flour mixture....hence getting a fried gizzard with no coating! But I made a egg wash before coating with the flour mixture and it turned out great...Thanks! :)

This recipe in my opinion over cooks the meat.  I found that if you boil for less time the meat is more supple. Once the meat is cooled coat in the flour mixture, dip in egg and then in a cracker coating.  Fry in a med hot oil browning briefly on each side.  The original recipe leaves a tough piece of leather to chew on.

Its alot like the way I do them. Two words people, pressure cooker! Not sure what that par-boiling is all about. Drain them, pat dry and fry them. Mine you can cut with a fork, I kid you not. Try it you will be amazed, and you will wonder, what was I doing.

I boiled ours for about 5-7 mins (until they started turning gray). Then I DIPPED THEM IN EGG first after they cooled. We also put a little soy sauce in the egg. And some seasoning salt in the flower mixture. It gave it such great flavor that really complimented each other!! I didn't use garlic power and we used a deep fryer. Good luck!!

Using the suggestions left by another reviewer, I tried marinating the gizzards in buttermilk overnight and adding a little MSG to the flour mixture. Otherwise, I left the recipe alone. The end result: gizzards that were better than some I've tasted, but I've tasted better, as well. So I'm toeing the middle of the line and going with three stars.

Followed the recipe exactly as written except used an egg wash to make sure the batter would stick and deep fried them as several other reviewers had. The gizzards were tasteless and as tough as leather. Won't be making this recipe again.

I tried it both ways - didn't read the whole recipe and cooked it from the beginning with all the ingredients suggested but didn't boil ahead of frying.  Instead I took the gizzards, shook them in the bag of spices et al recommended and fried them for about 15 minutes total - DELICIOUS.  THEN, I realized I should have boiled them first so I did it the next time.  I like them the first try best.  Also, I didn't worry about the timing of fat , grizzle and whatever.  Just popped them in the bag of recommended spices, etc and fried them..  SUPER!

This is absolutely a great recipe but, how I made mine were I started off by slow Cooking my gizzards for 5-6 hours on low and then I place the cooked gizzards in milk and eggs. This work best to keep the flour coating on when trying and also I used hot sauce for the spice. That was so great

Good easy recipe.  I added onion granules and used white pepper in place of the black pepper.

These need to be simmered in seasoned water for at least 1  1/2 hours until tender enough to cut with a fork.  I add meat tenderizer to the water when simmering to speed up the process. I also prefer to use cayenne or red pepper instead of black pepper as is my taste.  Batter and bread in seasoned flour and fry for only 2 minutes or so until golden...yum
