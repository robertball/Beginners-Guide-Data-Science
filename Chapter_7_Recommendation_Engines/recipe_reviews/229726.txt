Fantastic! My hubby and I loved it. Only thing I changed was I used real apples chopped up and added crumbled sausage.

This is a delicious recipe! My husband LOVED it.  I have no doubt it's packed with calories, so not something I would make often but perfect as a specialty comfort breakfast. I couldn't find the Luckyleaf brand filling but any apple filling works.  My bakery was out of the brioche so used fresh French bread instead. Turned out beautifully.  The only change I may make next time is to reduce the sugar as I don't think its necessary.
