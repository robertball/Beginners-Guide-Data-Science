This recipe was great.  I did tweek it a little though.  I added creamy caesar dressing to the mayo before stirring in the chicken and lettuce.  Then actually, I stirred in the chicken and refrigerated that overnight.  The next day I folded in the dressing and chicken mix to the lettuce.

It was awesome.  My family and friends loved it!  Thanks!

I thought this was a good idea, but we made a few changes. I added red bell peppers, some thinly sliced red onion, and also used ceasar salad dressing. It was easy and tasty.

I just assumed it was a typo in the recipe calling for mayonnaise instead of caesar dressing, so I followed the recipe exactly except for using the dressing instead, and it turned out wonderful!!  I used a light caesar dressing and it made such a filling lunch!

This was not good at all and did not remotely taste like Ceasar's...maybe next time used ceasar's salad dressing INSTEAD of mayo!

Excellent flavor for the few ingredients it uses. My kids loved and so did my wife I'll probablly be making it again in the near future.

I changed this up a little by using a garlic pesto wrap instead of the suggested pita. The results were delicious! However, having used the suggested amount of dressing, I found the wraps to be a bit too messy.

After reading all the other reviews, I also used caesar dressing instead of mayo--and it was SO good. My whole family loved them!!

Delicious!  I used creamy caesar dressing instead of the mayo as well and it turned out so good.  I love that it only calls for a few ingredients that I already have in my fridge.  Hubby loved it as well!!  This is a new favorite for us.

Would have given this 5 stars if the recipe called for creamy caesar dressing.  Mayo was very bland.  Just as good in a whole wheat wrap or a whole wheat pita.
