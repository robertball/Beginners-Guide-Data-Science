This was a nice twist on meatloaf.  The only thing I am going do differently next time is add cheese in the mixture.

I enjoyed this recipe, not quite a 5, but is deserving of a 4+ rating.  I did not have hot cheese crackers so substituted breadcrumbs with chili powder and some hot sauce.  I Love the spiciness of this recipe.   Will make it again and definitely use the hot cheese crackers, perhaps this will make the difference in a 4 verses a 5 star rating.  Think mixing some cheddar in the meatloaf and topping with pepper jack cheese would be yummy.

YUM! This was so good! I used ground turkey, nacho chips instead of the crackers and put the cheese (Monterey Jack) on the inside of the loaf. Enjoyed by all and thank you!

This was a hit with my whole family, including my extremely picky 6-year-old son! I added coriander, oregano, and garlic powder, and used chipotle cheddar tortilla chips as the binder.

Good, not great.  Just kind of lacked much depth of flavor, not really sure what was missing here.

This was a very good meatloaf.  I added additional spices to suit my family's tastes by adding cumin, chili powder, and garlic as well as a few dashes of hot sauce but it came out excellent and was a hit in our home.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Also, a tip that I've learned for baking meatloaf is to line the bottom your baking dish with slices of bread before setting the meat in.  Then, any fat that drains out during cooking is soaked up by the bread.  When you dish the meatloaf out onto a serving plate, just discard the bread and you're good to go.

Best meatloaf I've ever eaten. Great for leftovers. Didn't have spicy crackers/chips so we used garlic croutons. It was great with corn and mash potatoes. We will always make this version when we want meatloaf. Yum!

Very good. We added jalapenos, 1/2 cup of onion, corn, green peppers and cheese to the recipe. Loved it! So good. Update: We also added 1/2 a bag of taco seasoning.

The rotel was light on green chilies, so I added a can of chopped green chilies.  The shredded cheddar was OK.  Next time I will try Monterey jack or pepper jack and use a hotter salsa for the topping.

Good meat loaf...makes great sandwiches.

The recipe itself is good but it sure takes longer than 35 minutes! I put it in at 11: 30 and it will come out at 1: 30.
