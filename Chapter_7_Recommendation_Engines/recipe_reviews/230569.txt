WOW muy delicioso!  My fiance and I really enjoyed these patatas bravas! I was drooling waiting for them to finish, that's how amazing the kitchen smelled ;)  Followed the recipe verbatim, it was quite simple.  I especially loved the dipping sauce (any excuse to use my mortar and pestle!!).  Thanks John for sharing your recipe!  Fierce!

Fantastic!  Marvelous!  Delicious!  As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew my boyfriend would go absolutely crazy for them, so I made them for our Valentine's dinner.  I made the sauce and the spice mix the night before, which worked out wonderfully on the busy day.  I followed this to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing about them- the flavor combination is out of this world, the spice level is just about perfect, the crispy, crunchy exterior is the perfect housing for the tender potato within.  The sauce is just lovely, and would be wonderful on many things.  I debated on buying yet another vinegar, but am so happy I did not try to substitute anything else for the sherry vinegar- it is worth it to buy yourself a bottle if you don't keep it on hand.  My boyfriend thinks me a kitchen super star- we devoured these with gusto!  Thanks Chef John!

These are fabulous!  I followed the recipe to the T. Now I know the secret to crispy fried potatoes. A few tips:
1. Make the dipping sauce first (even a day ahead) and let it sit to marry flavors.
2. You can cook the potatoes ahead of time. Just make sure they are dry when you put in oil.
3. Taste the fried potatoes as you add the seasoning after frying. I did not use all of the seasoning mixture to avoid over-saltiness.

This recipe is authentic and the sauce tastes just like I had in Barcelona and all over Catalonia.  No stars for healthiness, but 5 starts for taste. YUM!

If I can do it, you can do it lol!  I have now made this recipe 3 times for my girlfriend, she loves this recipe!  On the spicy side which I love (her not so much).  I've learned to also do steps 3 and 4 first, then step 1 and 2, then step 5.  In my opinion it makes more sense to do steps 1 and 2 while the potatoes go through their 45 min cool down.  Overall though, it's delicious, and I plan on making this for some time to come!!

So I doubled this recipe, so maybe it was a bit off. But it was WAY too salty. I would not put a tablespoon of salt. Maybe it is a misprint? I could see a teaspoon, but definitely not a tablespoon. Luckily it goes in at the end so I was able to shake a bit off. Would have been good without the extreme salt.

Amazing! Perfect crisp! I had no idea the secret was in letting the potatoes sit out. Perfectly seasoned, I'm in love. I now follow Chef John and have his blog saved in my favorites! Ever recipe is gold!

Great potatoes that taste like what you get in Spain!  This recipe was easy to follow, but it was time consuming.  Next time I'll make the sauce and boil the potatoes the night before, so that I only have to fry and season them when I'm cooking dinner.

Holy ! These were FABULOUS and so easy to make! I made them as a side dish for a dinner party with some of my husband's family and everyone loved them so much I ended up having to make them again 2 days later! Thanks so much for this awesomely crunchy recipe!

These were great! Definitely time consuming, but well worth it! Unfortunately, the grocery store I went to did not carry smoked paprika, but I looked it up online and paprika + cumin is a good substitute. I also didn't want to buy yet another vinegar, so I used some red wine vinegar that I already had and it worked just fine. The sauce takes some tweaking to get it to your own liking, but once it is right, it is DELICIOUS! I usually follow recipes to a T, but I do not think it is fair to rate a recipe differently when the person making the dish takes it upon themselves to change things! I had Yukon Gold potatoes on hand that I wanted to use up and they were delicious, but I found that I had to cook them in the oil a lot longer than the suggested 5-6 minutes to get them nice and golden brown.

This rating is just for the dipping sauce, as I used a different recipe for the potatoes. The sauce was pretty awful, and tasted mostly like mayonnaise. I much prefer the combination of homemade aioli and salsa brava for patatas braves.

FANTASTIC! Made exactly as written, and would not change a thing. I made the sauce the day before, which was great b/c it gave it more time for the flavors to blend. I have to admit that I did find this recipe a bit time consuming, but it was totally worth it...this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! And so easy. Only differences - my potatoes only took like 15 mins to cool. Also, instead of the dipping sauce, I added vinegar, onion, garlic, paprika, and cayenne to a tomato soup I made the other day and served it with linguica. So good. I would like to try the dipping sauce next time. Thanks Chef John!

Very good potatoes with a tangy dipping sauce. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, and left out the chipotle and cayenne pepper. I replaced them with chile powder. These were so good; I made them 3 times in 1 week.

These were delicious! I made them for a paella themed dinner party and I was worried how they would travel and taste if they weren’t piping hot, but they entire batch was eaten! I tripled the potato recipe but only 1.5’ed the sauce, which was still more than enough. The sauce, as is, was too mayonnaisey for my taste. I added more of everything, plus a little garlic powder, to get the right amount of heat, without tasting like mayo. This recipe got rave reviews!

This recipe was AMAZING! I made it for a Spanish food project, and they look, smell and taste great! I made no changes to the recipe. Some reviews say that the spice blend had too much salt, but not for me! I used the majority of the spice blend, but not all of it while tossing the potatoes for the final project. Great recipe and I encourage everyone reading this to make it. 
Note: It is a little bit spicy.

I made this recipe for a Spanish Wine Tasting party. It was very tasty and received great comments. The potatoes were very crispy and spicy-good. I had already made the spice seasoning mix for the potatoes when I read the comments about the salt. The seasoning mix was a bit too salty( and I generally like salt) and I did not use all of it for that reason. Other than recommending to reduce the salt, this was great. I will make this again

Worth the extra time/effort to dry out the potatoes!  My kids and husband loved these!!  Only change I made after reading other reviews was reducing the salt from 1 T to 1 t....I think that was a good call!

Delicious and easy, especially because I had most of the ingredients on hand (I followed the recipe exactly). The dipping sauce was addictive! It made a great appetizer to our Spanish themed Christmas dinner.

Great! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made it per the recipe, but did not use all of the spice blend when I tossed it with potatoes. I think that much would have had it tasting way too salty.

I did not make the dipping sauce but instead opted to drizzle them with Chimichurri sauce, but the potatoes (prepared and cooked as directed) were excellent. My picky kids even liked them quite a bit.  I served them as a side with a medium rare skirt steak that had been marinaded in smoky paprika and garlic. VERY good!

The salt ruined this for me. I thought it was too much salt,but I followed the directions. Actually theses would not have been bad,if you just left out the dry spice mix. I lived in Spain for 6 years and have traveled there every year for the past 30 years . Papas bravas are one of my favorite things,but these did not live up to what I like.

Delicious and easy. The kitchen smelled so good from the spices in the boiling water. The sauce was easy to make.  I used a mini food processor. We just returned from our first trip to Spain and these rivaled the ones we had on vacation.

I put only half the salt in the post-frying spices for the potatoes and it was perfect. Awesome recipe!

This was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I made this for a party and followed the recipe almost exactly. We made double the aioli which we ended up not using so the amount called for is probably sufficient. The aioli was very tasty! Our guests raved about it. And the potatoes were friend perfectly--my boyfriend left them in the oil a little longer than called for but he said he wasn't checking the temperature of the oil. So so so good!!!!

The dipping sauce is perfect!  I always have it ready  in my fridge to use with lots of other foods!
Its Great on burgers!
Be sure to use good quality paprika (pimenton) and sherry vinegar.

WOW! I love it. I have made it so many times with regular spanish paprika, since I couldn't find smokey paprika and the end result has been excellent every time. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

These were amazing!  I've always loved them at the tapas bars, and these were at least as good.  They had great texture, crispy outside and tender inside.  It took quite a bit longer than 5 minutes to get them to brown, but well worth the wait.  The sauce was good, but not terribly necessary as they were very good with just the seasonings.
