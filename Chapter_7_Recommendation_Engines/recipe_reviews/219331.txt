Good taste and easy to make.  However, this recipe does not mention what to do with the ground beef - figured I would just mix in the ground beef with the rest of the ingredients.

I made this for supper and my family loved it. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and angel hair pasta in place of the egg noodles. I also used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. Will definitely make it again.

The kids love it.  I just mixed everything (only added pepperoni)  together as it does not tell you where to layer the beef.  Maybe I'll try using some Ricotta next time to add more flavor

It was good, but I changed it to spaghetti noodles, and mixed the hamburger in like most others said! It was a little dry, Next time I will use more spaghetti sauce!

This is SO GOOD!  Our Church asked some of us to make casseroles for the homeless in our city.  I searched for a recipe on allrecipes.com because I'm not much of a cook.  I saw this and decided to make one for myself to make sure it was good enough before I make it for donation to others.  LOVED IT!!!!  I felt very confident making it for someone else to eat.  The lady who helped serve the homeless on that afternoon called me and asked for the recipe.  I will be bringing this one to potluck dinners from now on.

We loved this,however,it was a bit greasy for us and next time I'll cut back on the sausage I substituted and also the pepperoni....will definitely adjust the ingredients next time. I also used penne as we aren't fans of egg noodles.

Pretty Easy! You can’t go wrong really and we all know what it will taste like... but, boy!!! I’ve never gotten SO many questions on what I made and how to make it. We eat with our eyes first, and this dish is very pleasing on the eyes!

Quite tasty.  Family members request this be made again.  I doubled the recipe.  I added 1 pkg of Italian seasoning to the sauce (jar of marinara & 1 can tomato sauce) before mixing with noodles.  I used ground turkey, turkey pepperoni , black olives, red onion, mushrooms, & various cheeses: mozzarella, colby jack, parmesan,  & a pizza blend.

My family loved this recipe! I just mixed the ground beef (vs. sausage) in with the rest of the ingredients. Made per recipe first time and left out mushrooms second time. Also used some extra feta cheese and veggies. So good! A hit in our house!

Very tasty and a great way to use up some already opened jars.  I added more sauce and would add even more next time.  Also added 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  My husband loved it and I have frozen the remains for yet another good meal.

Simple sooo simple ! One of my best friends, and his father loved it ! My father even had it cold for breakfast the next day...said ,  “that one you should make again !” Great for 4 -6 people, with homemade garlic bread.  Would recommend for a family meal to anyone ! (I used 2 - 24 oz jars of pasta sauce and a scant less of pasta. Filled a 9x13 casserole dish to the top) (Sorry...my review was for the manicotti Italian casserole)

I left out the olives since my house does not eat them.  Also, I put half of the pepperoni's in the mixture and then topped the casserole with the other half.  It was a big success at my house and leftovers were even better!

Super easy! We subbed Italian sausage for hamburger and green olives for black plus used a mix of mozzarella and pizza cheese- we also only did mushrooms on half.

This dish was amazing. I loved it. I used pasta sauce with Italian Sausage in it. Really adds good flavor. Also added some cubed up ham. Didn't have the mushrooms and olives but was still really good. WILL make this again.

This recipe is very easy and absolutely delicious!!!  Tasted just like my homemade pizza I used to make with the bisquick crust.  The pasta almost gives the flavor of a crust.  Soon good!!  Will DEFINITELY make it again.

Quick and easy. I also use sausage and pizza sauce instead of ground beef. Tastes even better the second day.

It was more like spaghetti casserole that a pizza casserole.  I remade it the next week, using pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  YUM. That way it was a definite Pizza casserole

I added Italian sausages and put a Colby/Monterrey instead of mozzarella. It tasted good. However the directions were not as specific as it should have been and you didn't mention what to do with the ground beef or how to properly dress the casserole, and might I suggest adding some groung oregano and season salt for flavor while your cooking the ground beef because it tasted bland.

This is a favorite of my neice's, but I leave out the mushrooms and olives.  I mix everything but 1/3 of the mozzarella and all the pepperoni, then layer the cheese and pepperoni over the top like a pizza.  It can still be somewhat time-consuming, but less so if you already have leftover pasta sauce with meat, or already cooked ground beef.

I made this and everyone liked it.. It was a bit salty & greasy for our tastes though.  I used what I had on hand: I had a 7 oz package of pepperoni I used.  I didn't have olives or mushrooms.  I added 1/2 C onion and 1/4 bell pepper to the beef as it cooked & used Rotini noodles.  I didn't have enough Mozerella cheese so subbed some Cheddar too. Overall a very good basic recipe.  I think the big difference for next time will be to layer half the mixture in the dish, spread a layer of pepperoni, the rest of the mixture and pepperoni across the top.  That should help with the salty & greasy-ness.

Good recipe! Have made it several times and make do with what I have in my pantry. Unfortunately have to omit the mushrooms and olives because the kids don't care for them.

It was great!  Very tasty, fairly quick.  I used 45 oz sauce plus a can of diced tomatoes, 6oz cut up salami, and Italian seasonings as well.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and whole grain pasta. YUM!

We liked this a lot.  I added some garlic, onion and red bell pepper since that is the last if it from the garden but otherwise left it the same.  Even my picky eater loved it!

I really liked this casserole. Made the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce"(doubled) from this site, but otherwise followed the recipe. Oops! I also added a bit of chopped salami...I will be making this again. It's quick, easy & flavorful, but easier than making an actual pizza. Thanks for posting!
