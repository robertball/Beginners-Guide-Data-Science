I debated between 3 and 4 stars, and went for the higher rating because the product is good.  However, this is NOT a brownie.  This is a very dense cake.  I doubled the chocolate at other's suggestion and felt the chocolate-ness of it was perfect.  I also substituted one cup of brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar.  As the other Texas Brownie (cake) suggests cinnamon, I a tsp of cinnamon to this recipe.  I also used the frosting recipe from Texas Brownies I.  I am very happy with the finished product but again must stress that this is not a Brownie - it is a moist dense chocolate cake.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband, especially with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.  I had to make a few changes because I can't find buttermilk in my town in Mexico; I used 1 cup of sour cream for the buttermilk, used 10 tbsp. of cocoa rather than 4-1/2 tbsp., used 1 cup of coffee for 1 cup of water, and added 1 large tsp. of cinnamon.  I frosted with a can of frosting I had in the cupboard.  They were great, very cakey and really delicious.

I was very disappointed with this recipie. I have been looking for the original Texas Brownie recipie that I had & I was very happy to find this one. I made this recipe twice and neither time it turned out well. I know the last recipe I had called for instant coffee, but I used water instead, like this recipe. I found it very bland and lacking in 'chocolate' flavor. I do not recommend this recipe.

Definitely a cake - not a brownie, tho i think the size & richness qualifies this to be called Texas Brownies! Speaking of size - this recipe made TWO jelly roll pans (so i doubled the frosting) - i was afraid of a big mess if i only used one pan. So wonderful & made enough to share with friends & freeze some for later!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is more of a cake than a brownie...but it is delicious and moist.  I always use plain yogurt instead of the buttermilk.

Good overall, but I was dissappointed with the frosing. I have made your recipe before and it was great. .Just remember to gradually add your cocoa , icing sugar and vanilla. It makes a big differnce in the frosting.

MMM! this makes ALOT of brownie so if your just wanting a small portion recalculate. i was just trying to make enough for 2/4 and got so much rich chocolaty goodness i gave 3 portions away for the holidays. but it was GREAT! not a brownie but more like a heavy decadent ultra chocolate cake and the icing was awesome. of course i doubled the cocoa :) its the  only way

This was great the next day. Fresh and warm, it wasn't as great. The frosting came out PERFECT and I think the brownie did too, since it was very cakey. It didn't taste very chocolatey though. It probably would've been better with some chocolate chips mixed in.

I made these alll the time when the kids were home.  Now just make for special holidays.  I use the biggest cookie sheet I can find,usually a bakers half sheet and ice while they are still warm.  They are still our favorite chocolate cake.  Makes a lot.Enough to share

This definetely should be called cake rather than brownies.  They are not dense or chewy at all, but light and fluffy and lacked chocolate flavor.  The batter was very thin and pourable, not thick and spreadable like true brownie batter should be.  I am throwing them out.

Best chocolate cake ever.  I say cake because it is much more like a cake than a brownie.  I used whole milk instead of butter milk and also added some milk to the icing.  wow is this delcious!

I made this the night before because I wanted them to mellow. They were very good and moist but cake-like in texture. I used sour cream as I didn't have buttermilk. I cooked them About 4 min. less than required. I did put the frosting on while the bars were hot from the oven; for 2 reasons. One because it tends to make a more moist bar and second the frosting will stay shiney and be more like a fudge. I gave this 4 stars only because it was more like a cake than brownies.

I absolutely loved these Texas brownies, so did my husband.  They are moist and delicious!  Make sure you pour the frosting on while its hot for it sets quickly once out of the pot.  I had made these a few years ago and lost the recipe.  I am so glad I found it!  Thanks Norma!

We LOVE this recipe and no matter what you call it (texas sheet cake brownies, texas brownies or buttermilk brownies) it is all good.   For the frosting, I also used buttermilk in place of the milk, which adds extra richness and a nice tangy chocolate flavor.

Thank you for your recipe.

It was a good cake but it was definitely NOT brownies.  I'm giving it three stars taking one away because it was a very good but not a totally awesome cake and another because it says its brownies and its not.

This is basically a sheet cake. It tasted good, but the recipe wasn't edited very well. The salt that is called for in the ingredients isn't mentioned in the directions and some places the recipe calls for butter and elsewhere it says margarine. I probably won't be making these again.

Lack that chocolate flavor and quite dry, very cake-like.  We prefer moist and chewey brownies. I followed this recipe to the tee, at 20 minutes, they were not done, so they needed an extra 5 minutes or so.  Not sure I would try them again.

I have made it several times now and love the rich flavor and the ease of making it. The last time though I only had 2 cups of semisweet chocolate so I added 1 cup of white chocolate and may make it half and half the next time.

I never had made this before but had tasted a number of versions that others had made. The ingredients are also listed out of order which makes the recipe hard to follow.  Had to cook it way longer than 20 minutes given the error--I agree with other who stated it makes 2 jelly roll pans. The taste was good once I figured out the different issues with the recipe, but the fat and calorie content makes it unlikely I will make it again.

I received this recipe years ago from my Aunt Janet and it is a favorite at home and to take to work.   Sometimes I add cinnamon and use strong coffee instead of the water for a nice amp up of flavor.

These are definitely a cake like texture , but more dense and moist than cake. 
I used 6 heaping tablespoons of cocoa. I didn't have buttermilk but you can make buttermilk by squeezing lemon juice into your milk and let it sit for 5 minutes.
The amount of batter was perfect for the pan size stated in the recipe, 12x18 jellyroll pan. I lined it with parchment paper and sprayed with non stick spray.
I did not use the frosting. When the brownies came out of the oven I put mini marshmallows on top with chopped pecans. I melted a bag of chocolate chips with 1 cup of chocolate hazelnut spread. I drizzled this on top of the marshmallows .......heavenly, delicious ...out of this world!!
