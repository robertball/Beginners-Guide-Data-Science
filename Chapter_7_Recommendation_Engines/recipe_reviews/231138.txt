This was delicious! My 8 year old kids loved it. I just used oscar meyer bacon pieces instead of frying up slices. I also added about 1/4 cup of chopped red bell peppers and 1 chopped green onion and cooked that with the bacon in a little butter for a minute and then added and cooked the kale for about another 5 minutes. I also used a 4 cheese mexican blend, because I didn't have the other kind on hand. We will definately make this again!

Very good! Substituted chicken sausage and baby kale, then I added onion and fresh mushrooms, and went too heavy on the cheese (stick to the recipe here). But we WILL be making these again.

We enjoyed the flavor.  I had to make 2 substitutions based on what I had on hand.  Instead of the dijon mustard...yellow mustard.  Instead of the cheddar cheese...Mexican cheese blend.  Next time I make this recipe, I will finely chop the kale in a food processor instead of using the larger ribbons of kale.  My husband has a full set of dentures which makes it more difficult for him to chew the kale.

Yummy! Love the way you assemble the omelete. I didn't think the mustard would do much but it gave it just enough taste. Hubby loved it too. I left out the bacon.
