A great explosion of flavor combination.  This is an excellent bean salad.  I used kidney beans, green beans and garbanzo beans.  I added slivered almonds, as another reviewer recommended.  Using "medium" salsa (a nice level of "hot") provided the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the no-fat French dressing.  I will repeat this recipe many times down the road.  I'm always looking for good side dishes.

Since this recipe invited you to try different beans I made a typical 3 bean salad with kidney, wax, green and garbanzo beans. I added a little onion and left out the water chestnuts. The unusual dressing was really the thing that was supposed to give the typical bean salad a lift over the vinegar, oil and sugar type.  I wasn’t impressed. It just tasted like French dressing with some salsa mixed in it and not something unique unto itself. I did try some sliced almonds. Maybe mine were old but If I do make this again I would totally leave the almonds out, did nothing for it. It may be better the second day too. Good starter idea to use salad dressing on the beans though, maybe I’ll try Ranch with the salsa next time.

I made some variations on this salad, such as adding more beans, using a tomato sauce instead of and/or in addition to salsa. Adding some slivered almonds makes it crunchy and even more nutritious! I also found that adding mushrooms or other finely-chopped veggies spices it up a bit too.

Great recipe. I didn't have any French dressing so I used Honey Dijon instead and it turned out great.

Really quick.  Taste will vary considerably by the type of salsa that you use.

I have made this recipe many times - it is SO easy and always a crowd pleaser. I've tried all sorts of different salad dressings depending on what I have around, and they all work and add some variety.

Mmmm...healthy AND yummy. I just made this for a huge bbq get together. Most of the little kids even seemed to like it. I used black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, and decided to add a can of corn to make it look more appealing to the masses. I will definitely use this as a quick & easy standby for potluck bbq type gatherings!

Well I needed something quick for tomorrow's lunch and decided to make a bean medly salad.  I came across this unique recipe of the salsa and french dressing and decided to try it.  I used a can of 4 bean medly, chick peas, kidney beans, romano and black eye peas.  I put the garlic and the salsa in with less of the requested French dressing and I was quit surprised.  I didn't put the water chestnuts but for a quick and easy bean salad this turned out pretty good.  I have a tossed leaf salad in a tupper wear and I will be adding the bean salad on top of it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yet another recipe that seem to bring the guys around during sports seasons! Quick, cheap, and easy to make, although I end up substituting serving the French dressing for Italian and put the salsa on the side. The amount of beans called for makes loads of salad, and it tastes even better the next day once all of the beans have marinated!

This salad is good.  I changed a few things like adding Kidney beans instead of Garbonzo beans and added more salsa.  The only thing I would change in the recipe is less dressing and more garlic and salsa.  I felt it just needed a little kick.

This recipe was interesting, and it did taste good, but there wasn't really anything exciting about it.  I took it to a potluck and brought most of it home.  I added the corn as someone suggested and that added to the flavor and color.  If you are looking for healthy alternatives I suppose this recipe isn't so bad.

this has become a staple in our home! I use whatever beans we have on hand to go with the chickpeas, (mostly black beans and a tri bean mix), and use different salsas all the time. I occasionally add shredded carrots and water chestnuts for extra crunch.  there really isn't a wrong way to do it.

It was very easy! & it's good. This was my first time making it. I am going to let all the  ingredients marinate together for a couple hours before I eat some.

Great recipe.  I did add a can of corn.  I cut salsa to about 1/2 C. and then added the French dressing a little at a time until I was happy with the taste. Very easy!!
