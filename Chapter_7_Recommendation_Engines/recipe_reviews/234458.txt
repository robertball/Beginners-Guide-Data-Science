I made this recipe last night and my boys LOVED it!  The dough is very sticky, but have faith it baked up great! The final product is moist and just how you want a scone to be! The best part of the recipe is the icing! I will be using it on all sorts of treats! My only advice would be to double the spice it came out a little to bland for me.

Made these today they turned out wonderful and tasted so good. I didn’t use the icing as I was satisfied with how they tasted without. 
I used Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt 
They are moist, soft and yum!!!

I made this using GF flour and I think I added a wee bit too much purée.  Very easy and the dough was manageable.  I halved the recipe and still got more than 8 small to medium scones.  I will definitely make these again but I will as other reviewers recommended, add more spice and brown sugar.  The browned butter glaze deserves 5 stars itself!!

A lovely recipe , I only had a small change because I always like to try recipes as written the first time. I add 1/2 cup more flour as I think i went a little heavy handed on the pumpkin puree. The browned butter icing was fabulous...oh and the pecans were sprinkled on top as i forgot to put them in..lol

had bad luck with these. The texture was all wrong and I followed the recipe to the letter.
