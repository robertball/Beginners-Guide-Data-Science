My mother used to make this relish every summer.  It is a wonderful relish that goes well on a southern table.  She always sliced her squash and onions in rings though, not diced them.  They are much prettier in rings rather than diced.

This relish is by far better than any cucumber relish!! I make this every year and it is the only relish my family wants me to use.  I put it in potato salad, tuna salad, chicken salad... anywhere I would normally use pickle relish!  The squash actually seem to hold up better and stay firm longer in this relish!

I made this yesterday and so I haven't had a chance to taste it after it has sat in the can for awhile but the initial taste was wonderful! The perfect ratio of sweet to tangy. The reason I am giving it only four stars though is that is is quite liquidy. I think I will use less vinegar the next time

This is a family favorite! To save time I throw the veggies into the food processer and pulse/chop until they are fairly finely chopped. My recipe calls for turmeric, and I leave out the mustard seed entirely. It's nice as a side as well as a relish!

I make this every summer with extra veggies from the garden.  My family loves it with meats and as a relish for hotdogs.  I always add 3 jalapeno peppers for extra flavor.

I am giving it 5 stars for the prep work.  I just made a batch this afternoon and haven't tasted it but what a easy recipe.  I really hope it turns out as yummy as it looks!  I am dying to taste it but I know it will need a few weeks for all of the flavors to settle.

update 8/3/2019:  I can't believe that it has been 7 years since I have updated my review.  THIS RELISH IS DELICIOUS!!!  I have made it every summer as written and it is perfect on pork, chicken, in potato salad...you name it.  Everyone loves this recipe and beg me to make it every year!  My (now) 6 year old son loves the relish and begs to eat it straight out of the pot.  

Make it-you will not be disappointed!

I love this recipe.  I made 3 batches last year and just did a double batch for this year.  It is great on and in everything. I hand dice all of it because I love the texture.

I made 2 batches of this, and on both I only cooked the veggies about 8 minutes to keep a little bit of firmer texture.  I made the first batch exactly as written. It was really really good, but a bit too sweet for my taste and not enough kick. 2nd batch I added 3 diced jalepenos, 2 diced cayenne, bumped up the mustard seed to 2 TBS, added a pinch salt, and reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  I liked the 2nd batch better, but I think that is all a matter of taste.  Wonderful recipe!

my husband loved it. Did replace sugar with 1 cup of splenda. Outside of that, no other changes.

The was a really easy recipe. I didn't use quite as much sugar as it calls for and it still turned out really well. Would definitely recommend this recipe and will be making this again!

Excellent!! I chopped everything up really fine, like a pickle relish.  I tried it on cornbread first, and it was delicious.

I ran across this recipe last summer as we had an overabundance of squash and I was looking for squash recipes and decided try it.  It was a huge hit in our household. We use it on hamburgers, hot dogs, as a side, and it is also great on collards and kale when they start coming in during the cool weather months. I plan on making extra this year. Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great.

Made my first batch last night! Missing and substituting a few ingredients; I only used 1/2 of a green bell pepper( that's all I found in the fridge, I was completely out of Red Bell peppers so I found a small jar of diced pimentos (Hey they're sweet red bell peppers so it has to work!) I also had yellow squash as the recipe called for, but I also added Yellow Zucchini from my garden! I also misread the recipe directions( I read it no less than 5 times) at the beginning so my veggie mix sat stewing in their own waters and salt for one whole hour! I then saw my mistake and used a sieve to press out most of the water at the end of the hour, lol
It still came out delish! WOW this was a real easy recipe~!~

This is SO good! I had a giant cucuzza squash that I needed to use up, and found out that people often use them interchangeably with summer squash. I decided to try this recipe, but halved it to see if I liked it first. We LOVED it, and I will probably make more asap!
