I used half the taco sauce, mixed in crumbled tortilla chips in with the chicken mix and sprinkled cheese over all.  I also garnished with 1/4 cup chopped green onions.  Everyone enjoyed this dish and will make it again.

Excellent!!!! Great taste. I had only 8 oz of taco sauce so I added 8 oz of tomato sauce and it
tasted great. The taco shells came out a little crunchy next I will probably layer the dish. And I will probably add more cheese mixed in chicken mixture. My family loved it!!!!

Was very good.  Kids weren't thrilled with it.
