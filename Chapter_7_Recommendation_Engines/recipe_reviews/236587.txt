Simple and tasty! I thought it needed a bit of salt but that was my only change. I do like the creaminess of it. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I made this yesterday and added 2 Tbsp of lime juice 1/2 tsp of Cilantro 1/2 tsp minced garlic and salt and pepper to taste and everyone loved it. I will be making it again on the 4th of July.

It was great served with the quesadillas I made for dinner. After tasting I added some garlic salt to it.
