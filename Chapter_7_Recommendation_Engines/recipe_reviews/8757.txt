You don’t know me, but you’ve gotta believe me -this is good.  I mean REAL good.   I modified it a tad, starting with using the standard breading method of flour, egg and (seasoned) bread crumbs.  I browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil to reduce the burning point temperature.  Once I browned it thoroughly I cut into it and noticed it was still a little pink on the inside – no problem, I just threw it in a 325 degree oven while I prepared the sauce and cooked some pasta.  While I only made two chicken breasts, I hated to waste the better portion of an 8 oz. carton of chicken broth and half a carton of cream, so I thought what the heck, I’ll use it all!  I added the chicken broth to the pan first, reduced it drastically, then added the entire carton of cream and let it go until the sauce had reduced to a thick and velvety smoothness.  I added the Parmesan and pimiento just before serving and topped the chicken with a basil chiffonade rather than stirring it into the sauce.  The chicken was tender and moist, the coating dry, golden and crispy (rather than mushy and soggy), complemented by the luxurious, rich sauce.  The pimiento was a nice touch, subtly enhancing the sauce.  I’m glad I had the extra sauce - it was perfect for some nice pasta!  Since this is a dinner a little on the rich side, I chose to serve it with just a few pattypan squash, lightly seasoned with butter, salt and pepper.  At the risk of sounding corny, this was a GLORIOUS dinner.

Very good, but I made a few changes: I pounded out the chicken a bit for quick even cooking: I dipped the chicken in egg instead of milk; I added chopped garlic while the chicken was cooking and to the sauce; I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream; and I used more chicken broth and less cream to cut some of the fat. I stuck with the original recipe for the most part - it is really very good!

I baked the chicken in the oven and doubled the sauce as another reviewer suggested so I'd have enough to go over angel hair pasta.  This sauce was so heavy I should have done linguine!  It was rich, thick and very creamy.  All I had to add to give it a little more flavor was 1 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar.  My husband was looking for more of a tomato basil cream sauce, so I added a 14.5 oz. can of italian sytle diced tomatoes to some of it and a little sugar and we had it!

This is really good.  Unfortunately I made some changes to the recipe to suit our tastes (hence the 4 star rating).  I pounded out the chicken breasts for even cooking and added some fresh garlic (like another reviewer suggested).  I also omitted the pimentos (didn't have any).  I added just a splash of dry white wine.  Fabulous over some noodles.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

Here are my modifications: I cut my chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks, fried them in butter with 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I also added broccoli and used whole pimentos from the mexican food section (much cheaper) sliced in strips. I substituted half and half for the heavy cream, used 2 tsp dried basil, doubled the sauce and added a little corn starch to thicken it.  I served it over fettucini.  Overall, it was good...my family liked it a lot, but personally, I thought it was more work than I like (frying the chicken, then setting it aside, grating the parmesean, etc.)  I imagine it would be very good with fresh basil and maybe some fresh tomatoes (nice summer dish)

I'm on Atkins, so this was perfect for me.  I did add garlic to the butter as I cooked the chicken, which I coated w/parmesan-not flour.  And instead of pimentos (which I didn't have), I used chopped jalapenos.  JUST RIGHT!  (For me-if you don't like spicy food, stick w/the pimentos.)  Great recipe to build on!

No, I didn't follow the recipe; but I learned a few things so you might want to read this anyway - even if you make faces at us who don't follow recipes to a "T" :)  I didn't make the chicken - at all.  I thought I'd try the sauce first.  The sauce - well, I subbed half & half.  I used 2c thinking it was going to be fabulous - & so I could have half with basil, half without. I just melted a little butter, added the half & half & heated.  Added a cup of parmesan & almost 1/4t freshly ground black pepper.  Stirred till melted, which takes longer than I expected; but maybe I just added it too soon.  I read in another review, not from this recipe, about using mozzarella as a thickener instead of cornstarch or flour.  Hmmm, I tried it.  'Didn't work on this one.  I added a half cup of shreddded mozzarella & still had to thicken with 2T cornstarch.  Maybe the mozzarella trick would be a trick for when your first choice didn't thicken enough.  Sooo, it was good then.  Nice & thick & yum.  I added a third cup or so fresh basil to a cup of the sauce.  I love basil.  I love it.  I love it, love it, love it; but it just didn't do anything for me in this recipe.  I wanted it, too.  What a great idea - creaminess of parmesan & fresh basil.  'Sounded great, but notsomuch.  Oh yeah, I'll eat it; but prefer it without my precious basil.  :)

Excellent! I didn't have pimentos, so I diced half of a red bell pepper that I had, added a package of fresh mushrooms that I had, but other than that followed it exactly. It didn't need anything else, but I had those 2 things that I needed to use. It was excellent!! I served it over orzo pasta. I mixed half the sauce with the pasta, and then topped the pasta with the chicken, and then poured the remaining sauce over the chicken. Was soooo good and did look and taste like a restaurant cooked it!

I think that this was very good and quick to prepare.  I made some changes on the prep though.  I did not bread the chicken. Instead, I seasoned it with Lawry's salt and pepper and browned it in 1 Tbsp butter and 1Tbsp olive oil.  Once the chicken in browned on both sides, cover the chicken and cook 10 min until juices run clear.  While the chicken was browning, I crushed 3 cloves of garlic and let it infuse in the oil and butter.  I picked these out before going forward with the sauce.  I used 1% milk with cornstarch instead of cream and this worked well.  I think that next time I will sub sun dried tomatoes for the pimentos because I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Loved the base recipe and will make again! Oh, I served it over bow-tie pasta with garlic toast.  Yum!

This was excellent.  I made it with fresh basil but only 1/2 of the amount of pimentos.  Also added 2 cloves of garlic to pan of sauce.  You may also add some white wine to the sauce as my boss did; neither his family or mine had any leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I changed the recipe slightly. I substituted capers for the pimentos and dipped my chicken which I seasoned in flour instead of breadcrumbs. I didnt see the point of the milk bath before dredging so I omitted that as well. Great recipe.

This was fabulous and my husband said "You can make that again". I did make some changes, as usual. I added chopped Garlic, used half & half instead of cream and added more chicken broth to have enough to pour over the bowtie pasta. I also used sun dried tomatoes (because they were on hand) rather than Pimentos.

definitely an indulgent chicken dish with the heavy cream and butter but it was delicious.  I served this chicken with mashed potatoes.  It was a real comfort food kinda meal!

Not bad, added garlic, and toped pasta with the chicken breast pounded thin and fresh chopped tomatoes. A splash of lemon brightened the Basil flavor. Added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little kick, too.

I made a lot of modifications and it was still delicious.  I used fat-free milk to coat the chicken and I browned it using Pam instead of butter, then baked it the rest of the way in the oven. I used fat-free chicken broth, fat-free evaporated milk instead of cream, and reduce-fat Parmesan cheese. Also, no pimentos, don't like them. I cook with these ingredients all the time so it tasted great to me!  But, it probably won't be good for those who are used to the higher fat version. I will definitely make this again but next time I will add garlic like some have suggested.

This is a good base recipe.  I made a few changes and it turned out great.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.  I skipped dipping it in milk and just tossed it in seasoned bread crumbs.  I fried the chicken in olive oil instead of butter.  I added 1/2 tsp. garlic from a jar while I fried the chicken.  I doubled the sauce recipe but changed it a little too.  I added 2 Tbsp. flour to the drippings and then added the broth.  I used Half and Half instead of cream.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt and used 1 Tbsp. dried basil since I didn't have any fresh.  I also used 1/2 cup Kraft grated Parmesan Cheese and 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano Cheese.  I left out the Pimentos.   I served the chicken and sauce over Penne pasta.  All in all it turned out delicious.  I will be making this again!

This was a tasty variation to having chicken breasts.  Although the sauce was too thin to my liking, next time I will add some flour to it.  I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I used dried basil and it turned out fine.  I didn't add the pimento's (we don't care for them) and added some garlic powder and salt to taste which made the sauce even better.

A very easy and tasty dinner.  This is not the quickest meal you could make, it takes about 30-45 minutes prepare.  It is flavorful, but not very spicy.  Simply grilling chicken rather than using the milk and bread crumbs would be equally delicious.

This was pretty good.  I agree with other reviewers that the sauce needs salt & garlic.  Might try adding mushrooms to the sauce as well.

This meal was excellent!! You do have to like Basil though. I cut back some on the basil, so it wasn't so overwhelming. Once you cut back on it, it is one of the best chicken meals I have made. My husband is a picky eater and he loved it!! Will make it again over and over. It is high in fat but it was worth it =:)

This is my husbands new favorite recipe. I chopped up slices of bread for the bread crumbs and used two tablespoons of dry basil instead of fresh (that's all I had) and it was melt in your mouth delicious!

Great! I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, so I just sprinkled some 'til it looked pretty. I used 2/3 cup water and 1 chicken bullion cube for the broth. I served this with chunk-cut sweet potatoes baked in cinnamon, sugar,and butter, and also with buttery green beans. I know this is chicken, but my pinot noir tasted pretty good with this as well.

I served this at a small dinner party last night and got rave reviews. I did not use the pimentos as I don't like them. I also butterflied and pounded the chicken breast to get quick even cooking times. My only problem was I needed the suace to sit for about 30 min. to get through the first courses and it seperated during the wait. I quickly whisKed in a little cornstarch and it thickened but had a grainy texture. But every one still commented on the "lovely, delicate flavor".

I'm always looking for easy "meat" recipes to translate into vegetarian dishes that I can serve to my non-vegetarian family and this dish made the grade!

I substituted Quorn naked cutlets and vegetable broth and this dish was completely finished by my entire family. That's pretty unheard of.

I definitely agree with thickening the sauce up, just a bit, with a little cornstarch but it was superb other than that. Yum!

Another winner. This one came out great. So easy to make and so good. 

I had to make a few changes to suit my needs. I skipped dipping the chicken in the milk. I really don't think this is a necessary step. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs and 1% milk instead of heavy cream, as those are what I had. I also omitted the pimentos, since we don't like them. Lastly, I added extra Parmesan and some Romano cheeses. It was so tasty with some mashed potatoes. Yum!

This meal is simply incredible! It taste like something you would get at a fine Italian Restaurant. The only slight problem I had is that I couldn't get the bredding to stick to the chicken. I think next time I'll skip the milk and dredge it through egg instead. I also used Italain breadcrumbs and added some mushrooms too. I served over angelhair pasta, with crusty Italian bread. I'm no chef, this is one of the best meals I have ever made. My husband was even impressed, he took one bite and said it tasted like something you would get at Olive Garden. This will be something I make again and again, delicious!!

I had finished shopping and was exhausted! I did not feel like cooking at all but knew that dinner would be expected. I had bought chicken breasts that day and quickly came on allrecipes for a quick recipe. This is FANTASTIC!! I didn't have parmesan cheese, only the granulated stuff by Kraft. So, I added this cheese to the crumb mix along with onion powder. I only had a small container of longlife cream in the fridge and dried basil which I used 3/4 tsp but it all came together so well. I put in grated sharp cheddar into the sauce and everyone loved it! I served it with a salad and ranch dressing. This was so easy and will become a staple weeknight dinner.

This is a wonderful, easy to prepare dish. I will admit, I was leary to use whipping cream, so I used half and half instead. Maybe the next time I will experiment and use light cream. I used thin sliced chicken breasts with this recipe. My husband, the chicken hater, loved it--in fact, went back for seconds!!

I liked this but I put too much dried basil in and had to spend some time to get it out.  It would probably be a lot better with fresh herbs.  The chicken turned out really yummy.  I used seasoned bread crumbs.

I made this last night it was wonderful!  I did pound the chicken thin & cut them in half length wise, once it was golden brown I put it in a 350 degree oven to keep warm while I made the sauce.  I also made pasta to go with it but that really wasn't needed.  Thank you

I went the easy route, used dried basil and threw in red pepper flakes instead of the pimentos, which I didn't have on hand.   Still came out great and was consumed quite rapidly.

Very good. I did this: Fried chicken with some minced garlic, added salt,pepper and onion powder to breading, and used only half pimentos. I would like to find a way to thicken the sauce without using corn starch though. Served over fettucini.

Used egg instead of milk, steamed broccoli and 2 TBSP jarred jalapenos instead of pimento.  HUGE hit!  Added 1 tsp garlic powder to Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and doubled fresh basil.  YUMMO!!  Next time I'll serve over white rice...and may double sauce but not necessary if not serving over anything.

we enjoyed this chicken, as it was definitely something different!  super easy to make, although we didn't need nearly all of the sauce it made.  this is something i would make only once in a great while, but for a change it was nice.

I switched the butter with vegetable oil, used half and half cream but only 1/3 cup and 1/3 cup soy cream.  Sprinkled less than 1/4 cup parmesan on top. Otherwise, followed all the instructions. I served this with pasta because my husband is not on a diet, and it was delicious. The basil adds a lot. Don't leave it out.

This was an awesome chicken dish.  I had a few pieces left over so for lunch the next day I cooked prepackaged mushroom and wild rice ravioli and added the cream chicken on top.

This ended up being one of the best home cooked meals I've had in a while! I substituted the pimento peppers with sun-dried tomatoes for my dad's benefit. I served it along with capellini (very thin pasta) and poured some extra cream sauce on top. This is a fairly mild dish, but you still get that hint of basil that brings it to another level. Buon appetito!

Happened upon this recipe today and made it for dinner. What a big hit! The teens loved it as much as the adults. This will definitely become a loved recipe in our house. I used Panko because that is all I had. The chicken was so tender, but the sauce. Man! It was the star of the show.

I made a few changes, after I pan fried Chicken. I melted some butter and stirred in some flour to make a Rue then added cream ect., as we like thicker sauces and this turned out wonderful. I also added some Chardanney, and I used Roasted Red Peppers and lots of garlic and fresh Basil,  I cooked  the pasta and added the sauce to that before I plated it and sliced  the chicken up and laid that on top with a sprinkle of fresh Parmesan Cheese. Excellent Recipe that you can make to your taste.

This is my absolute favorite recipe I have found on this site! I have been making it for a few years now. I've made it for many friends and it's a winner every time. If you haven't made this exactly how the recipe was written, you have to try it!

This was so good, my mouth is watering wanting to go into the fridge for the leftovers.  I've never cooked with pimentos before; I definetly will again!  My only change was to use dried basil instead of fresh.  I was concerned that the sauce would make the chicken soggy, but it remained crisped through our meal.  I served it with mashed potatoes, using extra sauce as gravy.  Yum!

Delicious!  Easy to make and fast too!  I made this quickly while my husband was on the way home...shocked him to come home to a gourmet meal!  Served chicken over a bed of bow tie pasta...and drizzled sauce on top.  Perfecto!

The chicken alone without sauce was outstanding. It was moist inside and crispy outside. The kids loved it. I doubled the sauce since I was cooking for husband and I plus 7 kids. My kids didn't eat much of the sauce, so I had lots leftover. The only changes I made to the recipe were adding a little salt and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs and using seeded tomato instead of the pimento. The sauce was very rich and very yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good!  Did not have heavy cream, substituted 1 cup evaporated milk and 2 teaspoons cornstarch.  Came out great, wonderful flavor, served over chicken and pasta. Chicken breast also was good, juicy, not dry. Everyone loved it!

Delicious.  I'm always looking for recipes to use my fresh basil.  Suggest adding some garlic to the oil when cooking the chicken though.

I didn't have fresh basil so I used 2 Tbsp dried.  Probably could do slightly less next time.  I used fat free half and half.  The sauce was a little thick, but I stirred it in with egg noodles and spread some over the chicken.  It was a hit at our house!

I've made this 3 or 4 times. I leave out the pimentos (cause I just don't like 'em) and sautee about 3 cloves of minced garlic in the butter before cooking the chicken. I use Italian bread crumbs for the coating. Also, I double the sauce. Great over Penne or thin spaghetti. I've gotten compliments and recipe requests each time I've made this.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. However, like others, I made some changes. Here are the changes I made and/or suggest: 1) Use either sun-dried tomatoes or roasted red bell peppers instead of pimentos. I used the roasted red peppers, but will probably use sun-dried tomatoes next time - personal taste preference. 2) Cut back on the Parmesan cheese; this recipe calls for too much. Also, add a little of the Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs that you use to coat your chicken. 3) Add minced (finely chopped) garlic to the butter before you add your chicken. Be sure to have your heat on low when you add the garlic; if not, your garlic will burn and leave a bitter taste. 4) Also add salt - to taste - to the cream sauce. 5) After cooking the chicken on the stove top (if using pieces other than chicken breast), place the chicken in a warm oven and let it continue to cook while you prepare the sauce.

This recipe was just ok. It definitely needs tweaking. Dip the chicken in MILK? Um, no. I skipped that entirely because you dont really need to bread the chicken and then cover it with sauce. It would end up gritty. If I were going to do it I'd dredge the chicken in flour/egg/bread crumbs, tho'. Also - jarred pimentos are pretty much flavorless. They just got mushy in the sauce. I'd suggest a jarred roasted red pepper. What you have here is pretty much skillet fried chicken with a chicken flavored Alfredo sauce. I liked the addition of the fresh basil... but so much more could be done with this recipe. We liked it, we didnt love it.  It's kind of run of the mill. I recommend skipping the breading, cube the chicken and fry it up with more seasonings, then make the sauce and toss it in some pasta. It was a good starter recipe.. but it's Alfredo. Been there, done that. Thanks tho'!

The flavour of this dish was fresh and different. Hubby enjoyed it and says it's a keeper. However, one thing about it does bother me. I've made this twice now and each time, the sauce comes out a bit gritty. The first time I made this, I used dried grated Parmesan instead of fresh (like those you find in shakers at pizza places) so I thought this was why. However, this second time, I used fresh Parmesan and even had it on higher heat to help melt it in the sauce. It was still gritty. I think it's from the left-over breading. Next time, I'll try and remove most of it before moving on with making the sauce.

I'd do it again, but I found it a little overpowering in basil flavor.  I did use pimentos, but I am not a big fan of those either.  On the other hand, I made this primarily for my husband who loves FLAVOR and he thought this was great!

Followed suggestions of cutting into bite size pieces - cooked for 20-25 minutes.

For my tastes, I cut out the pimentos.  I also used jar'd basil instead of fresh and used pre-made breadcrumbs.  Those were the only changes and the chicken came out delicious. It tastes like something you would get at a fancy restaurant.

Yummy!  The only thing I changed was to use seasoned bread crumbs because that is all that I had.  Other than that, followed directions to a "T" and the chicken turned out so moist.  Served sauce over white rice.  (See photo) Will definetly make again.  Very easy and very quick to make.

entered cooking class, our team selected this recipe to prepare...big hit, did not win but everyone raved about the cream sauce.  severed over bowtie pasta, strawberry spinach salad, grilled vegetables.  None of knew what we were doing and this still came out really well, competition was strong, chef said the dish could be served in any restaurant and they would make money off of it.

I got this recipe from my boss and absolutely loved it!  I've made it several times for myself and my husband as well as dinner guests.  It is always a success!  The sauce goes great over pasta too!

This recipe is fantabulous!!!  Too bad about the fat grams though...;)  Just don't look at them, and they won't exist.

A bit too bland for my family... I think it needs salt. We thought it was so-so. Next time I will add a bit of salt but I will definately try to revamp it and see!

The taste was good overall, I found it best over pasta. The only thing that I altered was the amount of Basil. Too much basil in it gave the sauce too strong of a taste.

Wonderful!  I found this to use our fresh Basil from our new little herb garden and it did not disappoint.  The only change I made was mushrooms instead of the pimentos. This is definitely a keeper and I hope to place it in heavy rotation.

Oh my gosh this was the best! I tweaked the recipe a bit, only because of on what I had on hand. 
I was trying to use up leftover roast chicken breast, so I omitted the frying step. Instead I sauteed the onion and one minced clove of garlic in the butter in a heavy skillet, and added 2 tbsp flour, to make a roux. Then instead of broth, I used one heaping tbsp of chicken soup base. I didn't have pimento, so I substituted finely chopped hot sweet pickled cherry peppers (rinsed & seeds removed. I added 1 cup milk, 1/2 c cream and, the basil and blended. I allowed it to just barely simmer then added the leftover, chopped chicken breast and Parmesan. Allowed it to heat through slowly. Served over Easy Pilaf. Was absolutely outstanding. Will be making this again and again.

I followed the recipe and it was great.  It makes just enough sauce to use for the chicken and the side pasta dish.  Using fresh basil is the best!!

I did make this a little different. I used egg wash before breading the chicken. I used 5TBL of butter and olive oil. I used a bunch more basil and doubled the cream sauce. I made fusilli pasta and mixed that into the sauce. I plated the chicken on top of the pasta and had a great meal! It paired nicely with sauvignon blanc. Wife loved it one of the two kids loved it. (The other ate a bunch of geedunk before dinner and didnt have much of an appetite) I will make this again!

I did not like this recipe at all, unfortunately. I too added garlic and corn starch, but I still did not like the flavor. I like basil, but there was way too much of it for my taste. I also ended up having to cut the chicken up into small pieces, or it would've taken forever for it to cook. I was disappointed.

I found that the pimentos just disappeared in the sauce, so I replaced them with a few tomatoes. Sometimes I double the recipe so I can use an entire 14 oz can of chicken.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic. After cooking the chicken, I added a couple of tablespoons of flour to make a roux so the sauce would be thicker. This is perfect on Basmati rice. It can also be made without breading the chicken, cutting it into bite-sized pieces and just putting the sauce on rice. I have added mushrooms to the sauce as well with success.  Oh, and if you're buying basil from the grocery store, the .75 oz package is just the right amount.

Followed most of the recipe. The only difference was I used egg instead of milk and mixed bread crumbs with same amount of flour and seasoned that with thyme, poultry seasoning and garlic salt. Hint: If you dry the chicken with paper towel before dipping everything sticks perfectly and fries up perfect. And I thicken the sauce by adding couple tablespoons of flour to the butter before stirring in the liquids. The sauce is sooo good. I did add some mushrooms cus I love mushrooms. But it would be just as good without them.

Awesome recipe! I am a terrible cook so I was looking for an easy and fast recipe to surprise my husband with. I modified it by using half each of a red, yellow, and orange bell pepper instead of pimento. I doubled the cream and parm cheese to make more sauce. I also had to bake the chicken in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes after browning them for ten min in the skillet because they were not cooked all the way through and I didn't want to burn the coating. This was excellent!! My husband usually doesn't care for my cooking & he loved this so much he said I should make it for our friends next time we invite them for dinner! Went well with white rice and fresh melody veggies.

I didn't have any pimentos so I did without and it was delicious all the same.  Also, I didn't have any cream, so I used half and half.  My husband liked it too and my five year old even thought it was good - after he picked out the basil.  And, since my husband doesn't really like breading on his chicken I skipped that part.

I did make some changes.....I hate pimiento, so I subbed sun-dried tomatoes. (2 or 3 oz worth- jarred in oil, but drained) I love em. I first made it breading the chicken, but since then I just brown it in the butter. (IMO, no use in breading) I mix everything else in a bowl & pour over. When a recipe calls for a small amount of chicken broth, I just use granules with water. I also usually just use some dried basil. (1 T) That is always on hand. And since Costco has those half gallons of half & half now, I use that instead of whipping cream. :)

Great recipe..I baked the chicken instead of frying and used almond flour to bread the chicken to make it gluten free.  I also added a little almond flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

Made as instructed, and it was good, but not "wow." The one thing I wasn't totally crazy about was the breading on the chicken got soggy with the sauce on it. I'm not sure the chicken needs to be breaded. Next time I would add more flavors to the sauce as it was very mild. Definitely increase the basil.

Excellent. It tasted similar to my home made Alfredo sauce, but was a lot thinner. I may add some cream cheese next time. I only made some small revisions. Didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used about a tsp of dried basil, was unsure how we would like much more basil than that, so I added some dried parsley for additional color. Served over egg noodles. This is a very rich dish. I will make it again.

This is my MOST favorite recipe in my cookbook. The flavor is rich and oh-so-delicious, and I even get compliments from my husband who isn't usually interested in food. :) I've never made it with the pimentos, although this week I subbed sliced white mushrooms, which was quite good. I can't recommend highly enough that you add this dish to your menu soon!

Turned out really good. I eliminated the broth and just used homo milk instead to make it creamier because i like thicker sauces.

SOOOO good!!  I tried it tonight and it was delicious!  I had bought fresh basil and was looking for a recipe with chicken.  I am so glad I chose this one.  I used fresh red pepper instead of pimentos because I didn't have any.  I think I will try the sauce on talapia also! Thank you for the recipe!

Loved it- I was looking for something with fresh basil and this did the trick.  I left out the pimentos b/c I am not a huge fan of them. I also increased the broth to 2 cups and used  1  1/2 C. half and half to increase the sauce since I served it over linguine. So good!

This was very easy to make. It was good;  liked the fresh basil taste. I thought it was a little bland (the pimentos are sweet peppers) so I'll add a little spice next time. As a side note, I did not have bread crumbs, so I used a mixture of pecans, crackers, sesame seeds and oats all ground up and it turned out great.

Delicious! We also pounded the chicken and used red peppers simply because I didn't have any pimentos, but this was absolutely outstanding!

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it wasn't particularly attractive by the end! The sauce crumbled the breading and made it very damp. However, the dish was a total "5" on flavour! My brother said it tasted like KFC. It was very tender and the sauce was great. I didn't have grated parmesan so I used mozzarella, and that was good. I used part dried basil and part fresh, also good. I used part whipping cream and part 2% milk, which worked fine too. I ended up doubling the chicken broth though, as the original amount was not enough and immediately soaked right into the chicken breading and disappeared. I also thinly sliced and sauteed red peppers in place of the pimento peppers. I would make this again most likely, but not for company because of the appearance of the dish. Definitely try it though!

Me, my husband, and our 11 year old son all loved this!  I didn't have any pimentos on hand so I chopped about 1/2 of a red bell pepper and cooked with the chicken.  We had it with rice, but pasta would be great too. This is a keeper in our house!

Wow, yummy!  My 20-month-old and 4-yr-old had a full plate of seconds.  This is a favorite for us, thanks!  I added 1 clove minced garlic and a splash of chardonnay I had on hand (hm, I always have it on hand).  I think it would be excellent with or without the additions.

This was delicious. I didn't have chicken breasts, only legs and thighs, but they worked great (I didn't bread them). I served the chicken with some of the sauce drizzled on it and put the rest in a gravy boat to have as extra and to pour on the couscous I made to go with it. I'm still thinking about the sauce. Yummmm....I may add mushrooms to the sauce next time, but I love mushrooms.

Very nice! I used 8 chopped garlic cloves. I added chopped tomatos from the garden and marinated artichokes from the pantry. I did skip the peppers but will use them another time. This dish pleased the whole family.

Very tasty. I didn't add the pimentos (personal taste)and I doubled the sauce portion so I could use the extra sauce for noodles. If you're watching carbs, you could skip breading the chicken and it's still delicious.

OMG, SO yummy!  I made it just as is the first time and it was great!  The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce to get some extra sauce, plus it gave me some to have leftover to drizzle on my lunch the next day.  The sauce is good on lots of dishes. YUM!!

This recipe was great to use the leftover cooked chicken in my freezer...I just basically simmered all of the ingredients together and served over rice for a very tasty meal.  Didn't have cream so used 2% milk and thickened it with a bit of corn starch.  The taste was a 5 even as I made it, but next time I want to make the recipe as written - I think the presentation would be better.

This dish looks impressive and tastes even better.  And, it was very easy to make.  I pounded the breasts down a little before frying them.  The pimentos seemed like a strange ingredient, but they add great flavor to the finished product.

WOW! This dish is absolutely delicious. I've made it a few times since discovering the recipe and it is a new family favorite. The only thing I do differently is I double all the ingredients (except the chicken)to make extra sauce. I have served it over rice or over pasta (both are equally as good)with a nice dinner salad. This recipe has so much flavor, if you don't love it you've done something wrong!!

Fantastic!! My husband loved it also.  I liked the recipe the way it is, but next time to thicken up the sauce I will add a little more butter after removing the chicken and flour before I add my chicken broth.  I also added fresh garlic with the pimentos to add flavor for my taste.  Love everything with garlic!   Tossed some more parmesan on the chicken before serving and made roasted asparagus as a side dish.  I will definitely try again. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.  Can't wait to make it for my in-laws.

Everyone in my family loved it.  Did not have any cream, so I used skim milk instead and just thickened it with a bit of flour(dissolve about a tablespoon of flour into 1 cup of milk before adding to sauce).  Also added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used dried basil.  Served over homemade noodles (what an experiment!)  DELICIOUS!

This was fairly quick and easy to make.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any pimento so I just added some chopped yellow onion.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that sun dried tomatoes would be excellent in this as well.  The sauce was so wonderful that I licked that pan I made it in.  Next time I may make more sauce and serve on a bed of noodles.

OMG good! I've made this several times and find it's a good idea to pound the chicken or cut into smaller pieces, but mainly so you can get more of that delicious flavor in every bite!! One packed tablespoon of dried basil is plenty for us. And most important, DO NOT skimp on the pimentos.  They are a key ingredient!

Really delicious!  I impressed the in-laws with this recipe, and they all raved about it.  I did make a couple of changes since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  Instead of heavy cream, I used 2 cups of skim milk and added corn starch until it thickened.  I also didn't have pimentos, so I added sun dried tomatoes.  This is a recipe that has made its way to my personal recipe box. I would make it again the way I did it since it's a low fat option.

This is great.  The only thing I changes was adding 1 T. cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The parmesan in the sauce makes for a pleasing taste.

This recipe was great! I did not have pimentos so I used bacon pieces. I also used a couple of drops of hot sauce. Will keep this recipe for when family comes over.

Outstanding! Don't care for pimento peppers, so I substituted bacon. Yummy. This was the best recipe I've tried yet, and I've tried a lot of them. Thanks!

This recipe had an amazing flavor. It's time-intensive, but well worth the effort. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, but the sauce was still on the thick side. Next time I'll add more chicken broth. I also added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs for the chicken coating, and it turned out quite nicely.

This was delicious!  Instead of chicken breasts I used chicken legs which I fried in a little oil. I used half & half instead of the heavy whipping cream. I served it over linguine. It was great!

It all sounded great together.  It was okay but I think if I make it again I would cut the chicken into bite size pieces and serve it over pasta.

This recipe is like a restaurant dish. At first I was a little hesitant with the pimentos, but after tasting it, I would definitely make again using the full amt called for in the recipe.

This was really good! It surprised me! The only thing I changed was that I used skim milk thickened with about a tablespoon of corn starch. I ended up adding more milk in the pan to thin it out a little. You can adjust it to your liking (the thickness). You DO NOT have to use cream, though, which is great because I absolutely refuse. Very tasty!

Awesome recipe.  I give it 10 stars.  My picky family loved it.  It will definitely be a family staple.  I've made this dish two times.  I cut the pimentos both times.  The first time I substituted tofu for the chicken.  The next time I used pre-cooked chicken brests.  If you're hesitating on this recipe..Don't.  It is explode in your mouth good.

I've made this a couple of times now and it's been a huge hit.  I will definitely make this one many more times in the future!  I did substitute olive oil for 1/2 the butter for frying.

This is really good! It is quick and easy, too. I wish I'd had enough ingredients to double the sauce though, because I would have liked to have had more of it to go on my pasta. I wouldn't necessarily make any other changes to the recipe, but it does seem to be a pretty basic cream sauce that could be modified to fit your family's taste (different herbs, etc). Oh, I did use half and half (instead of cream) to cut back on the fat a little. The sauce looks so nice - it could easily be dressed up to serve at a nice dinner. The pimentos add a nice touch.

Tasty but the basil overpowered the parmesan cheese a bit too much. I'd lessen the amount of basil and thicken the sauce a bit.

Good Recipe... I added garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs... Loved the chicken! However, there was something about the cream sauce.. something a bit too strong and not enough of something else.. will try again and try to figure it out

wow - this recipe was the bomb. lessened the pimentos a bit and basil by 1/2 tbsp. added little more cream and broth than called for. added little garlic salt to chicken before breading and minced garlic to sauce. served over buttered fettuchini. more salt and pepper to taste. used dry basil and tasted like heaven.

I'm not sure if I made it wrong or not...but the sauce turned out very runny. The taste was delicious, so I will definitely make it again and try to tweak it so that it turns out thicker next time. It reminds me of a sauce at Olive Garden. Mmm!

Absolutely delicious!  I love basil and grow a ton each summer, so it's nice to find new ways to use it instead of making pesto.  Pounded the chicken to an even thickness.

Dry basil can be substituted for the fresh basil. However, fresh basil really adds great flavor!

Very versitile recipe.  I doubled the sauce and served over linguini, as suggested by others.  I used more fresh basil than the recipe called for, but would use even more next time.  Not for the health or calorie conscious.  Will make again frequently.

I made this for a few of my girlfriends and we all absolutely loved it!  I make it all of the time for husband.  The cream sauce is to die for!

How can I say very yummy!  We all loved it and I have made it for different friends and they all loved it and wanted the secret recipe!  And the sauce if you happen to have any left over makes a great sandwich spread in stead of mayo.  Super yummy.

If we could give this 10 stars I would.  I usually make chicken cutlets, never thought of adding the sauce on top!! This was delicious!  I did add cajan spice and parm. cheese to the bread crumbs just to give it a little kick, definitely with make this again!!

Yummmmy. Very good. I took the others advice of doubling the sauce and serving it over the pasta. Next time I would have potatoes.

This recipe was good to me, but my son and husband were not a big fan of it. More than likely I would not make it again.

This was great! My picky 2 year old loved it.  I had to borrow an ingredient from my neighbor, I gave them some as a thank you and they loved it to!

Absolutely delicious! This will be on our table often and for company meals. I grow my own basil and am always looking for new uses,and this is a great one. So easy and tasty. I gave the leftovers to my mother and she loved it,too.

I was expecting a much "heavier" dish with all that cream milk and butter, but I was pleasantly surprised by this light, fresh and easy dinner!  I highly recommend this and it was great the next day served cold on a slice of toast.

Very good, but needed a nice peppy drink every now and then, to cut through all that cream! :) Very easy and fast (except for mincing the darn basil) and tasty. I love using fresh basil. I would definately make it again.
