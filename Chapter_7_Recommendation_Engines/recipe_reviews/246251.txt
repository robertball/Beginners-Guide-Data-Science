Made as written and my rating for taste is a 5. My rating for execution is a 2. These start out frying up nicely  but before it is even time to flip they completely fell apart into one big crumble  in the skillet. I never touched or moved them but they just fell apart into one big pile of crumbly mush and  I even added flour.  After they were cooked thru and cooled I was able to smash them back into shape but it wasn't an easy task nor was it pretty. Sorry but as written these did not work for me. I really liked the taste so I might try to tweak them to see if I can't make them work again.
