What a happy find this neglected recipe was! Only two reviews and none for the past year?  This is one, great cookie!! While it seems like just a basic cookie dough with add-ins on it surface, it is so much better than just that.  Full of flavor, a variety of textures, not too sweet, chewy middle, crispy edges, just wonderful!  I followed the recipe with no changes save for using chocolate chips instead of the raisins - the combination of the semi-sweet chocolate and the coconut was a perfect match.  I couldn't decide between the Rice Krispies or the Special K Protein Plus ( a flake type cereal) I had on hand and in the end the Special K won out.  This is simply a good, old-fashioned, cookie jar type cookie, a make-again for sure.

These are easy and nice cookies.  I have a tendency to dump everything all at once in the bowl then mix, and I did that this morning.  They are a hearty, not too sweet cookie.  They didn't spread much; I was a bit surprised.  I don't know what the bf did with my raisins so I used currants instead and I don't have coconut so I added in craisins.  I'll try them again with coconut, and I'm sure they'll be good with coconut as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This cookie was outstanding!  I used oats instead of the whole wheat flake cereal because it was what I had on hand, and added chocolate chips because they are a family favorite!  Other than that, everything else was the same and what a great cookie they turned out to be.  Loved the coconut and oats together...

I think I may have over-cooked them, but they still came out very tasty. My kids helped me bake them and they say these cookies ROCK!! Glad I took a chance with with this new recipe!

Just made these tonight .. made a couple changes: Used splenda in place of the sugar as well as splenda brown sugar. I only used 1/4 cup of margerine (didn't have butter) and 1/2 cup apple sauce. I didn't have raisons so replaced with slivered almonds and as suggested used corn flakes.  4/5 cause of the changes. They didn't really spread out at all but turned out really good .. I'm glad I made them a bit more calorie wise cause I've eaten 2 already and may have a 3rd :o)

I added in a pinch of cinnamon, some chocolate chips and used oatmeal in place of the wheat flakes. Came out perfect!

Great cookie!!! I question the order of ingredients, mostly because I didn't see how I could physically stir all that flour in first.  Besides that mechanical change, a wonderful recipe, thank you!
