These were excellent!  I wasn't able to find the Jarlsberg cheese at my grocery store so I substituted it with Swiss cheese.  I also rolled in a slice of deli ham along with the chesse to add a little variety.  Will definately make again!

Excellent recipe.  I did not use fresh parsley and I added one slice of prosciutto to each roll up.  I did not brown the rolls prior to baking.  I added 1 clove of crushed garlic to the olive oil and then poured on top of the roll ups prior to baking.  Great recipe, paired it with "honey roasted potatoes" from this website.

Absolutely delicious.  Rolling the breasts took some getting used to, but was well worth the effort.  Very elegant.  I will make again and again!!

I make a similar dish called Chicken Peppi Rollups.  Along with the cheese I add a few slices of pepperoni on top of the cheese.  I use toothpicks to keep the rolls in place.  My family loves them.

Not exactly an inspiring dish, but very tasty. Might as well make chicken cordon blue. Same amount of work for a more impressive flavor.

I just made this for my fiance on Valentine's Day - it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was definitely good and not too difficult to make (which is key for me).  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Simple, tasty and nice presentation. I used Swiss instead of Jarlsberg.

4 stars for breaded cheesy goodness, but apparently I don't like Jarlsburg cheese!  it's very waxy and flavorless, so next time I'll use something else...goat cheese?  mmmm....

I made this recipe tonight. We all thought it was good. I didn't use the Jarlsberg cheese, which I've never had. I'll probably look for it when I'm at the store again. I used plain old cheddar, which I'm sure is not nearly as good, but it's what I had on hand. They were nice. I would have liked to try some ham or something salty in there. All in all, I will definately make again.

Loved it and so did everyone else I served.  I used Muenster cheese, spinach and cream of chicken soup.  I used frozen spinach and spread it over the chicken along with slices of Muenster cheese.  I followed the recipe as is until I put the chicken in the baking dish.  I evened out cream of chicken soup on the bottom of the dish and thinned it out with about a quarter of a cup of chicken broth.  Then I used about another quarter of a cup of broth to baste the chicken about halfway through cooking.  Fantastic!

Everyone loves this!  This recipe convinced my picky daughter that chicken is good, after all.  I used the thin sliced breasts and use meunster cheese, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  We now eat this on a regular basis.  Thanks!

I liked this but it does need more seasonings to up the flavor.  I noticed some added ham products (salt) and I can definitely tell that would help, or just season the chicken a bit with your favorites.  Great idea and I was looking for a recipe with Jarlsberg cheese - this did the trick.

This was really good and the chicken was flavorful! Couldn't really taste the cheese so much but as a whole it was really good!

Really easy and super yummy! I used swiss cheese in place of the cheese the recipe called for. I would not call the sauce in the pan a brown gravy like the description says, it is really just the chicken broth.

I love Jarlsberg cheese.  Recipe is labor intensive, but well worth the wait.

Awesome recipe!  I substituted the bread crumbs with dry potato flakes and my husband LOVED it!  Thanks for submitting this!
