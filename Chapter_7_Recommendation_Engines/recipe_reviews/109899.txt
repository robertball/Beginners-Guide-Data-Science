I made this recipe twice and I thought the 2nd time was so much better and less bitter.  I made the espresso - did not use espresso instant powder and mixed in 1 tablespoon of the espresso in the mixture.  In addition, I cut back on the rum b/c I thought it made the custard a little too bitter. I used 1/8c of dark rum. I increased the coconut milk.  I used 1 1/8c of coconut milk. Finally, I used Giaradelli bittersweet chocolate chip cookies for the chocolate glaze.  Delish!

This is a delicious panna cotta but it turned out more coffee than coconut. The coconut flavor was very subtle, almost unnoticeable. So it would be better to use strong brewed coffee. And I suggest that you use light brown sugar, because dark sugar overwhelmed  coconut flavor.

This was my first attempt at panna cotta.  It was a beautiful presentation, with a great combination of ingredients.  It had a bit of a bitter aftertaste though.  Maybe I'll leave the coffee out next time. :-)

BTW, the chocolate sauce is fabulous for making hot cocoa!

This panna cotta is so great--the flavors of the coffee go so well with the bittersweet chocolate and rum.  Plus it is so easy and a nice, lighter dessert when you are having a heavy dinner.

Not bad, overly sweet and fairly rich. Agreed on the coconut milk. I might even leave the rum out next time if I try it again.

This is sooooo good.  Just like something you'd get at an upscale restaurant.  And so easy to make.  I thought there was a lot of sauce, though.  Enough for a whole other batch of panna cotta.  Really rich & chocolaty.  You don't really taste the coconut milk or the coffee.  It just tastes really decadent.  This would be great dessert for a dinner party.  Guests will be really impressed.

I made these for dessert.  They were good but to me they weren't Panna cotta; the sour cream was just wrong in it.  I could taste the sour cream distinctly.  Real Panna cotta has a delicate cream flavor.  Four stars because the sauce was fantastic.  Thank you camila for the interesting recipe.

I serve this on a mound of "soil" which consists of rough chopped oreo cookies (remove the white inner stuff before chopping) and a large Tbl. of finely ground coffee. Mix them together well, and they should resemble potting soil.

I think that the rum flavour is too strong, and I couldn't taste the coconut milk at all. I would probably reduce the rum and compensate with more milk next time. However, the texture of this is lovely--smooth and light--even though I messed up at first and had to add more gelatin for it to set.

When I found this recipe, I couldn't wait to make it.  Based on others reviews about it being  bitter, heavy sour cream taste, and the lack of coconut flavor I revised the recipe.  The result was very good. except it still lacked coconut flavor.  I think next time I'll use coconut extract instead of vanilla and use the whole can of coconut milk (1-2/3 c.).   Here is what I did:  1 envelope of gelatin (.25 oz.),  2 Tbs. dark rum, 1-1/4 c. whipping cream, 1/2 c. dark brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. espresso powder,  1-1/3 c. coconut milk,  1 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 c. sour cream.  Followed instructions to prepare. I halved the  chocolate sauce recipe. and made it by putting the cream, corn syrup, and chocolate chips (2/3 c.) in a measuring cup and microwaved for 30 seconds.  Stirred until blended and melted and then  stirred in the rum.   It  was the perfect generous amount of sauce and especially delicious.  Will add an additional Tbs. of corn syrup next time to prevent sauce from becoming hard.  Will make this recipe again.

I am only rating the sauce. I used my favorite chocolate- Ghiradelli bittersweet - and the sauce was quite bitter. I usually do not care for very sweet desserts, yet I added two tablespoons more corn syrup- this time light- and it was still too bitter, even on some very sweet ice cream.

Great recipe!! It was super fast and simple to put together. We only made 2/3 of the chocolate sauce and it was still WAY too much. Next time we'll probably only make 1/3 what the recipe says. We'll probably replace some of the cream with milk to make it healthier, and possibly coconut milk for a little extra kick. Delicious!! Can't wait to make it again.
