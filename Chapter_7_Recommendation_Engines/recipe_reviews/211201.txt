This is my recipe, and I forgot to say that you can also just do the "drop biscuit" thing with these too, no need to roll them out really. Just as good either way. Hope everyone loves these, I've been making them for 20 years. you can add cheese, garlic and all your other goodies also to make it your own!!

I never use Bisquick or baking mix, so I went online and looked up the ingredients. I used 1 cup of AP flour, 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, and 1/4 tsp. of salt sifted together. Then add 2 tbs. of melted butter or shortening. blend with fingertips to crumb. The only yogurt I had on hand was either peach or pineapple - I chose peach. I added a dash of milk and followed the rest of the recipe. I shaped the dough into a round, cut it into four pieces and baked. the biscuits are delicious and FLUFFY!!!!

Just tried making these, uploaded a photo. The dough was hard to handle, think I had too much yogurt.
UPDATE: I've got this down for my 2 person household. I use 1 2/3 c Bisquick with one 6oz container of honey yogurt. Stir to combine and then use your hands to knead in because it will seem a little dry. I form into one big ball and when you can do this you know the texture is right. I spray an 8" cast iron skillet with butter spray, pinch off a portion of dough, round it slightly and place in skillet. I yield 5-7 depending on size. I melt 2T of margarine and drizzle over top. I bake @425 (hot as mine will go) in a convection oven for 12-15 minutes. I'm using my store brand (Food Lion) honey yogurt. If using Yoplait you will have to add 1T of milk.

I was looking for somthing to make with yogurt because I had a lot left over.  These were great! I didn't know what drop biscuites were, so I made a ball with the dough (about 1.5 to 2 inches) and flattened them and placed them on the cooking sheet.  I also decided we needed some desert... so I rolled a ball of dough, pushed my thumb in the middle and added some semi-sweet chocolate  chips (about 10).  Then closed the whole, placed on sheet and sprinkled generously with sugar.  Baked for about 9.5 minutes.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!  BTW; for those having trouble with the dough-you might be wanting to quit or add more yogurt too quickly.  If you use 2 cups mix and 1 cup yogurt (8oz) , you should be fine.  Just stir until most of the mix is no longer dried and then knead with your hands.

These really are awesome! My kids loved making them as drop biscuits.  The biscuits are great with a little butter or honey.  They have a nice spongy texture too.

This is not a review of the finished product.  Rather, it is a review of what is essentially a serving suggestion for biscuit mix.  I was looking for an alternative to my usual biscuit recipe.  I did not expect to find a "recipe" that is really just a biscuit mix with yogurt added.  I hate to sound negative, but you have done this before with a recipe for clam chowder that turned out to be a mix of canned soups.  Allrecipes.com is my primary source for recipes, but it's disappointing when the recipes are really mixes of ready-made foods.

They were easy and delicious as promised plus light and fluffy. I made them with vanilla yogurt as bases for individual strawberry shortcakes.

Worked really well. Super-easy and very versatile. I used blueberry yogurt and plain yogurt. Thanks for the recipe! Now I can use up that extra bisquick we have...

Delicious and so simple! I made them as drop biscuits and really enjoyed the flavor using yogurt added.  I think next time I make these I'll try using a fruit yogurt, as I think this can be a rather versatile recipe.  Thanks for the idea!

This truly IS awesome!  I even tried it using blueberry pancake mix, and my hubby loved it.  Works well using flavored yogurt and additions like shredded cheese.  Will definitely make these often!

I just made these when I found them on another website. I LOVED them! I used a 6oz. container of cherry yogurt for a slightly sweet biscuit. I was able to make 8 biscuits. These are so light and fluffy. Perfect served warm with butter. I enjoyed 3 of these with a cup of coffee! I'll be doubling the recipe next time! I can't wait to try other flavors such as apple/cinnamon or blueberry or chocolate! The flavor choices are endless! This is a 'must try' recipe!

Fantastic! I even made them with Fat Free yogurt & they were very yummy. For breakfast ones I might try topping w/ cinnamon & sugar and for dinner I might try topping with asiago cheese before I bake them.

The taste combined with the simplicity makes these 5 star worthy.  Sure they aren't anything unique or fancy, but they work just fine and can be whipped up in no time!

Very quick and simple recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to make an addition. I was in the mood for a savory biscuit, not just a plane jane one.  For my first batch I added some Mrs. Dash garlic and herb. They came out perfect and I was so impressed that I made a second batch using parmesan and romano cheese with a California blend of garlic powder.  They also came out very tasty.  I"m not sure how much I used but I'd guess a tablespoon of Mrs Dash and about a tablespoon of the California blend garlic powder and a guess of 1/4 cup of the parmesan romano blend of cheese. One side note. These biscuits are delicious hot out of the oven but cold, they are still good but not as good as right out of the oven.  And one other thing, mine took more like 12 minutes to back but I just rolled mine into balls and patted them flat but thicker than 1/2 an inch.

Wonderful and easy recipe! I love the texture (super light and tender) and flavor. I use the biscuit mix recipe from this site and plain yogurt. The dough was a little difficult to work, I but dusted it with flour and didn't fuss with it much. I didn't roll the dough - just lightly pressed it out to a little less than an inch thick. Mine took longer to cook than suggested but I think that was because I used a glass baking dish and make them thicker. I will make these often!

My biscuits are usually more suited as construction material, so I was hesitant to attempt these.  These DO remind me of the biscuits from the chicken from KY place...So, if you're hesitating, go for it!!

I didn't think these turned out when I made them because I only had 1/2 cup of biscuit mix in the cupboard and wasn't sure I mixed the right combination. They didn't rise much but they tasted great. I have more yogurt to use up so I'm going to buy more biscuit mix and make a huge batch. Good recipe! It doesn't get any easier than this one!

The recipe is solid - be patient with kneading... I baked for 10 minutes, fooled by lack of browning... but still good! Moist, fluffy... easy to make and great use of plain yogurt!

These turned out great! I used a biscuit mix recipe from the site rather than store bought and white whole wheat flour. They were soft and fluffy, and brushing the tops with milk kept them from being dry on top. I think I will add a little more sugar or honey next time just to offset the bitterness of the whole wheat flour and baking powder. I have had a hard time getting my son to eat biscuits, but he ate three this time! Thank you for a great recipe. Note: I used Dannon All natural nonfat yogurt and didn't need to add milk.

I used the 150g (5.3oz) container of Chobani nonfat greek yogurt and 1 1/3 cups Bisquick, made 7 biscuits. SO easy and SO tasty! Next time I think I will either make them smaller or cook at a lower temp because the inside was still a little moist while the outside was getting overcooked. Other than that they are perfect!

Easy and tasty! These didn't last long. 
I plan to try making it completely from scratch when I run out of bisquick.

This is an excellent recipe and the yogurt flavor makes these easily adaptable with additions of spices or herbs, even grated cheese for some really eatable biscuits. Delicious with homemade blackberry jam.

Very easy.  Very moist.  Very delicious.  I bet these would be spectacular if a person used strawberry yogurt and used these as a base for shortcake..

I doubled the recipe, and it took forever to bake. I did add some shredded cheddar cheese, but I can't understand how that would make such a difference. I appreciate this having more protein, but the results were a bit bland. I think I need to cut down on the yogurt ratio, add more savory seasoning to make it a bit more bready.  Yielded 12 biscuits using a medium-sized ice cream scoop (approx. 3 tbsp sccop). Didn't spread during baking.

I don’t like to use Bisquick because of the partially hydrogenated ingredients so I used fat free Greek yogurt and flour.

I made these biscuits for the first time, and they are amazing! I used fat free yogurt. I'll make these again and again! So easy and tasty.

I cooked and removed the skin and bones from a 'store bought' rotisserie chicken.  Added a can of Veg-All mixed veggies.  Poured all into a 13X9 glass baking dish.  Made the above dough. Patted it out on waxed paper and flipped onto this dish.  Baked as directed and it was delicious.  Dough was too soft to roll but worked great this way.

These didn't turn out well for us. They were hard to handle, so we added more yogurt. Unfortunately the plain yogurt we used was sweetened (dang Activia, I usually use Source and they don't sweeten theirs) and there was a noticeable sweetness upon tasting the final product. Added rosemary, pepper, marbled cheddar and Parmesan however they weren't at all like the biscuits you can make when using the recipe on the box of baking mix. They were eaten, but I won't make them again.
