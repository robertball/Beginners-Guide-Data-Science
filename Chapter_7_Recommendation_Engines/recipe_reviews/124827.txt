I ran into making this bread recipe because I discovered I was out of eggs.... but needed to use up some bananas.  I was surprised at how tasty it was!!! I made a couple of modifications based on what I had in the kitchen.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I used butter in place of the shortening.  I also stirred in some cranberries prior to baking.  I will definitely be making this bread again.  It is far superior in taste to the previous banana bread recipes I have made.  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I think this is an excellent recipe for Banana bread without eggs or milk.  Our 15 mo old is just eating it up and is having no problems with it at all.  I have been looking for a banana bread recipe for a while that was eggless and this is our ticket.  We did eat some right out of the oven and I found that the bread crumbled quite a bit but if you leave it (after it cooled we put it in a ziploc bag) it is much easier to cut.  Also I did have to increase my baking time to about 55 min.  I just kept an eye on it.  Thank you very much for a great recipe that our son (and we) can eat!

Edited 10/29/07 I am still making this recipe for our Banana Bread although now I am also using it for Banana Muffins.  I greese a large muffin tin, make recipe as above and bake in oven for 20-30 min.  They are wonderful!

The recipe turned out great.  All the kids ate it (that's a first)I added 1/4 cup of water to help make the batter easier to stir.

I modified it slightly, but it is still so delicious and easy- especially if you don't have many ingredients! Here are my measurements: 1/3 c. Butter 1/4 c. Brown Sugar 1/4 c. White Sugar 1 tsp. Baking Powder 1/4 tsp. Salt 1/4 tsp. Baking Soda 2 c. Flour 1 1/2 c. Mushed Bananas (about 3-4 regular bananas)  I crumble a little brown sugar on top before baking it, then I bake it just the same and when I take it out, I pour a brown sugar-water syrup mixture (a few tbs. of brown sugar plus enough water to make a syrup)over the loaf. After, I cover the loaf pan with foil and let it absorb its own moisture overnight. YUMMY!

This bread is pretty amazing considering it has no eggs or milk, basically no liquid of any kind! That made me nervous. But it turned out very nice, very moist, with a great banana taste. I used 6 small bananas that were left over from Thanksgiving, that were almost liquid in form, maybe that helped....who knows, it was really, really good! Thanks! PS Made this in my bread machine on the quick bread/cake setting.

I used vegan margarine instead of the shortening and added a tiny bit of vanilla.  This recipe rocks!  I have two children that are allergic to milk and eggs.  Thank you so much for posting! Oh and the second time I made it, I added dried cranberries... YUM!  Next time chocolate chips :-)

I used this recipe to make an eggless banana bread. I substituted the shortening for butter and kept everything else the same.  The bread was good but a little dry.

Very nice recipe.  I am giving it 4 because the kids didn't really like it.  But my husband and I thought it was great.  I didn't have any eggs and a couple of really ripe bananas to use and this was a perfect way to use them!

This is my NEW FAVORITE banana bread recipe. I tried it in hopes of finding a suitable substatute for days when I'm low on eggs/milk, or feeling stingy with those particular staples...and instead, I found a recipe I'll likely use WEEKLY and INSTEAD of the 'regular' egged/milked recipes! 
We did make ONE change...we used BUTTER instead of shortening. And we made both the loaf and the muffings. Delish!
FAB U LOUS!

This was a really good recipe and everyone liked it.  I made a couple changes though.  I used coconut oil instead of the shortning for the health benefits and spiced it up with some vanilla and cinnamon.  Finally, I added a couple tablespoons applesauce just cause it was kind of dry and I felt it needed a bit more moisture.

My grandson and I just made this for the first time and it was wonderful! I was out of Crisco so I substituted butter flavored Crisco and added 1 t. of vanilla. I made mini muffins baking them for 18 minutes, perfect and bite size for little fingers!

Great vegan recipe! I substituted the sugar for a maple syrup/agave nectar/honey mixture (equalling the 2/3 cup). I also stirred in 1 cup of dried cranberries and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened grated coconut. It was SO good!!! Thank you for this!

I was very impressed with the turn out of this bread. It was moist and have a great flavor and aroma. I had no eggs so that is how I came upon this recipe. My bf loved it too and that says a lot. I used 2 cups of mashed bananas too.

My 15 month old daughter is allergic to eggs so I am always looking for eggless recipes so she can eat what we eat.  This is a fantastic banana bread recipe and a definite keeper.  It makes me wonder why I've been putting eggs in my banana bread all these years since the mashed banana keeps the dough together nicely.  My only change was to use margarine instead of shortening and I added a teaspoon of vanilla just because.  It turned out very soft and with a great sweet banana flavor.  Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best ones.

love this recipe! originally tried it because i was out of eggs... and kept on making it even when i had them! i do make some changes based on personal preference: i use butter instead of crisco, add some vanilla and cinnamon, and use half white and half wheat flour. as muffins, they don't usually last more than a couple of days. and they are really easy to jazz up with chocolate chips, nuts, or a crumb topping. this is one for the recipe box.

This is a great recipe considering that there are no eggs or milk in it! It is a bit drier than traditional banana bread, but that just makes it more like a sweet type of bread. It's good and I'll definitely make it again!

I baked in 2 mini muffin pans instead of a loaf pan at 350 degrees for 18 minutes.  They were awesome!  We all agreed that they're probably the best banana muffins/bread we've ever had.  Will definitely make again.

I was skeptical about this recipe since I have tried so many Banana Bread recipes and more often then not they are terrible.  However, I was wrong.  This one was fantastic.  I did make a few minor changes:  1) Used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar  2) Added 1 tbsp of Vanilla, 1 tsp Cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp Nutmeg to the mashed bananas 3) Stirred in Currents that I had on hand  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent -- quick and easy, with lovely banana flavor.  I didn't have a loaf pan handy (just moved), so I portioned the batter into some round-bottomed muffin cups.  It turned out perfectly -- delightful little banana bread balls, each ideally sized to toss back for breakfast.

This is very good. I had all these overripe bananas but no eggs. Like some others I used 1 stick of butter instead of the shortening and added vanilla and spices. Will make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe,he said it's the best banana bread he's ever had! I don't like the typical taste/texture of banana bread, so I was excited to try a recipe that sounded unique. I made a few changes though: (1) I used 1 stick of melted butter in place of the shortening. (2) I added 1/4 tp each, of cinnamon and nutmeg. (3) I used whole wheat flour, and some flax seed and wheat germ. (4) Added 1 tp vanilla (5) After mashing the bananas, I used a hand-held mixer on them, which brought out their liquid, thus making it easier to stir in the remaining ingredients; and I believe gave it a better flavor and texture. (6) I finished off the batter by using the mixer to make it smooth and well blended. It developed a nice, chewy crust, while the inside was soft and delicious, without being overly moist. This is my banana bread recipe from now on!

I rated 4 stars for the original recipe.  I add 1/2 c milk based upon other reviews and 1 tsp cinnamon for my own taste buds.  Delicious!  Texture is amazing, flavor is terrific.

Very simple to follow. Moist and delicious. My small kids loved it! Cook time was off. I followed other reviews and added more time. Took me about 1 hour to cook. Recipe is a keeper since we are now a dairy-free home.

Moist, dense and full of banana flavor, unlike other banana bread recipes I've tried that have turned out dry, crumbly, and without much banana taste. Some substitutions that worked out well: 1/3 cup vegetable oil instead of shortening, white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Optional: add crushed nuts and raisins.

I loved this recipe!  I put in 2 cups of banana instead of one, which made it a little easier to work with plus you have that added banana taste.

Thank you for sharing!

This is a good recipe. I followed other readers' suggestions and made some modifications as follows:

1. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.
2. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.
3. I added 1/4 cup milk (in my case, almond milk because it's all I had on hand).
4. I also took a friend's advice and added nutmeg.

The bread came out soft and fluffy. In my opinion, it wasn't sweet enough which could be because I used brown sugar and added nutmeg. If that is the case, I can't blame the original recipe since I made those adjustments myself. Next time, I will try following the recipe as is and compare results!

Very good flavor and pretty moist bread.  I did add a few chocolate chips to the batter and it was delicious.

just perfect. I love this banana bread because it tastes just like the cafe made ones. I added some cinnamon to it as well and 1/4 cup of water.

Wow!  This is a keeper.  I added a little vanilla and used Pam spray and a cinnamon sugar mix to coat the pan before baking.  The bread is light and the banana taste really popped (3 over-ripe bananas).  I do believe I found the recipe that is not too dense but doesn't lose the flavor.  YUM!!  Thank you!

easy and delicious.  i made it a little healthier by using 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup oat bran.  also i used apple sauce to replace the shortening, and put less sugar (1/2 cup brown sugar)  i added a couple of tablespoons flax seed (for  added nutrition).  i added walnuts and dark chocolate chips.  it came out delicious!

Fabulous! I had no eggs in the house, so I looked online and found this recipe. I modified a little, by using margarine instead of shortening and didn't have baking soda, so skipped it. I also used a 12 muffin pan and cooked for only 25 minutes. They turned out moist and tasty!

I was really surprised at how good this was!  Proof that some allergy-free recipes can be as good as the real thing.  Used a bit more banana (four small ones) and whole wheat "white" flour.  Very moist and tasty, and bread is a beautiful golden color.  Mine took 55 minutes to bake.  Next time I might try to decrease the baking powder as I could detect a subtle baking powder taste.  I will also try with a healthier substitute for the shortening - they tend to do very well in baked goods and are also vegan, so dairy/egg free.  Excellent recipe!

I have tried many recipes with out egg. This was the best I have tried yet. I did use 1/2 a cup of butter in place of shortening and 2 over ripe bananas. It was wonderful! I will use this again!

Very good, very dense and not very sweet. I would like it to be a little more moist, will try again with more banana or some applesauce or yogurt or something. And walnuts, of course!

This is really good! I used 3 ripe medium bananas, vegan butter instead of shortening, and bread flour instead of all-purpose. I added 1/4 cup almond milk, and a splash of imitation almond extract. So nice to find a no-egg banana bread.

this recipe was easy and it turned out really good! I substituted the ripe bananas with Gerber's baby food bananas, 4 - 4oz jars, approximately 1 1/2 cup. The bread tastes great, but I would recommend to use only 1/4 of sugar with this substitution because the baby food is already too sweet.

This didn't rise well for me, but it wasn't bad. I'd make it again if I needed a recipe without eggs. 
I added a bit of extra liquid as other reviewers said and some cinnamon (my own preference).

Used part butter part applesauce in place of shortening.  Had extra bananas and a smidgen of leftover cherry yogurt that I added and compensated by adding extra flour until the batter was the right consistency.  Great banana flavor!  I liked this no egg version.

I wanted to like it because it is dairy free, but I did not care for this recipe. I will just use my old (but very good recipe) and use soy milk next time.

Used Earth Balance instead of shortening, half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup rice milk.  Smells and tastes great!!!!  Next time I will try adding more spices and maybe blueberries or chocolate chips...

Moist and delicious!  I added Hershey's chocolate chunks and around 1/4 cup of soymilk.  I used 3 very very mushy bananas.  Only main difference from the directions--It took around an hour in the oven instead of 45 minutes.

I really love this recipe. It's simple and easy to adapt, if needed. My husband can't consume dairy products, so this is a great recipe for delicious quick bread. I make a couple of minor adjustments: I add three-four tblspns of vanilla rice milk for moisture....and always 1.5 -2 cups of well ripened bananas, 1/3 c white sugar and 1/3 c. brown sugar, walnuts to mixture and sprinkled on top with 2 tblspns brown sugar. I have to bake this for a full hour, but it could be my oven or the weather. The bread gets better next day and day after (though it usually doesn't stick around that long!

I found if (onced cooked) i warmed it up and put a little butter on it then it tastes pritty good!!  also using no eggs or milk is a great idea. i rated it a 3 out of 5 because it dos not smell good and it dosnt look anything like normal banana bread (it was probably just me though).

I had to add 1/2 cup of water to make this bread usable.  I had three large bananas that were 80% black on the peel.  I also live at 4,400 feet elevatation and I have to add a little extra liquid to a  lot of recipies.  Without extra liquid of some sort I couldnt even get this mix blended. but it did bake up well and taste nice.

What a great substitute for all the recipes with dairy.  The only change I would make is adding a llittle more sugar.  Thanks a bunch for a great recipe!!

So I was searching for a recipe to make good use of the 3 ripened bananas I hated to toss. Was out of eggs, and had to sub margarine for shortening. Seemed a bit dry, so I added a couple tablespoons of water, a pinch of brown sugar, and vanilla. DELICIOUS!! My hubby is pretty spoiled, and even he commented on how good it was!! :)

When I try a new recipe I always usually follow all instructions the first time.I liked the idea of no milk and egg and decided to try this recipe. After I had put the bread in the oven I regreted not putting iin vanilla and cinnamon. So I sprinkled the top with cinnamon. I am so glad I did even tho it was to late I think the bread woould have been very bland. I will try this recipe again but I think I will add cinnamon. This bread is very heavy I thik next time I will add an egg as well.They only reason why I tried this recipe was because I was low on milk and wanted to save it until I went to the store. It wasnt the best but I think with a few modifications it could really be a great recipe. I think for me and by boys to eat it I am going to speard butter with some cinnaon on top

I just made this bread and it turned out really good. I read some reviews and I also added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, 1/4 c. soy milk, replacing butter and brown sugar. I baked for 50-55 mins. I tried it and its delicious. Thank you for recipe. It's a keeper!!

This bread tasted far too light to be a real banana bread! It was odd that no vanilla or cinnamon was in the recipe. I will not make this again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this bread and was extremely happy to find a recipe that did not require eggs or milk. I only made half in case I didnt enjoy the flavor and made a few changes. Iused oatflour for half the flour requirement, a mix of brownsugar,whitesugar,and natural stevia and a bit more banana after tasting. I also threw in just a dash of cinnamon,ginger and vanilla.This is my new breakfast favorite.

My daughter is allergic to milk, so I thought I'd try this recipe. It turned out perfectly. She's eating it up now. The only minor change I made was to add about 1 tsp vanilla. Next time I will substitute some of the flour with wheat germ.

My friends thought this bread was delicious & they could not believe it didn't have eggs or milk in it.  Very moist and tasty.  I used half wheat flour & half white flour.  Next time I might add an extra banana and eliminate the shortening.

I can't rate this 5 stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Instead of shortening I used butter. I added a touch of vanilla extract and added raisins and cinnamon. I baked it for about 30-35 minutes, then spooned a mixture of honey, brown sugar and water on top of the bread. Stuck it back in the oven for about 5 minutes. It turned out SOOOOO good. My hubby who doesn't like bananas couldn't get enough...Thanks for the foundational recipe - helped a lot! (I tried this recipe simply because I thought I had eggs in the fridge).

UPDATE: The bread wasn't so crumbly when you cut into it the next day. FIRST REVIEW: I made the recipe as is but found the batter to be bland. I added a tsp of vanilla and a shot of espresso. The batter tasted much better. The loaf took a hour or so to bake and then I let it cool completely before cutting into it. It was crumbly and extremely dry without the milk and eggs, and butter would have been a better alternative for shortening. The flavour was good but this isn't a recipe that I would make again. Thanks, anyway!

Excellent! I followed the modified version by reviewer Tea Elle and the brown sugar on top added just that little bit of crunch. I am always on the lookout for milk free baking recipes, and I will be using this one again.

Taste is great but do not attempt to mix the batter with a hand mixer. I added 1 tsp cinamon 1 tsp vanilla (1/4 c water) to moisten, also added some walnuts & chocolate chips.

Easy to make & very moist, but I found it to be bland.  There are no spices of any kind, so it's a little boring.  All in all, a great recipe that I will definitely make again, but I'll be adding some spices to be sure.  Also, shortening is probably the scariest & least healthy thing you could possibly ingest, so I used butter instead.

BEST banana bread I ever had.  I've made banana breads over and over again, but by far this is the most pure, perfectly dense, not greasy, and I added one too many banana and it was just fine!  Highly recommend above all else.

Very Good! I used butter instead. I also used extra banana and some milk,and a splash of vanilla extract. I then used my mini muffin tins so my daughter who is in kindergarten could take them as a snack for her school lunch. I baked them close to 17-20 mins watch tops as they do get hard if you dont keep eye on them. Very good and easy to do! Thank you again. :)

This is a great recipe! Even my chef boyfriend was impressed. Will most definitely make this again. I used 2/3 cup brown sugar, and I used real butter. One of the banana's was in almost liquid form, which I think contributed to the moistness.

I thought this was an excellent recipe!  I made it with Rice flour, and couldn't tell the difference. I will definately make it again. Gluten free, and Dairy free what else could you ask for!

This was so good! I made in mini bread loaf pans. It was really moist and great flavor. I bet it would be even better in a larger pan! My new favorite recipe

This came out great and the kids loved it.  I also increased the cooking time to 55 min.  When first out of the oven, the crust was very hard, but after it was cooled, wrapped in foil, and sat for a few hours, it completely softened up.

This is so easy and delicious. I used half brown/half white sugar and butter in place of shortening, and also added vanilla, cinnamon, and a handful of frozen blueberries. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe. I used a few extra extremely ripe bananas, butter instead of shortening, and Bisquick in place of the flour. Delicious! The Bisquick will cause the bread to rise a good deal more than flour will, so a larger pan is needed if you go that route.

Delicious! I made it as is. It was moist the first day and all the days afterwards. Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: I made it again with wheat flour and added walnuts. Still delicious! (About 20-25 mintes to bake.)

Fresh out of the oven now! It smells soo amazing. My 12year old son all but shoved his head in the mixer bowl to clean it out after I put the mix in the loaf pan. The dough is really really thick though so I added about 3 tbs of water to help it work together.

I was part of a team of novice cooks that work in a soup in kitchen. We wanted to make banana bread and chose this recipe because there is no eggs or milk required--we need to ration certain resources. The bread turned out perfectly (even with the serving adjustment for one hundred). The mixture was a little thick to spread out in the pans, but once completely spread out evenly, the mixture rose nicely in the oven. There was not a piece leftover! People made requests for more :) Thank-u, thank-u, and thank-u for your wonderful recipe.

I made this today because I had some bananas to use up, and no milk or eggs.  It is very, very tasty and surprisingly moist.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did add some chocolate chips because I happened to have an open package I needed to do something with.  I have no doubt it would be just as delicious without them.  Great recipe :)
UPDATE:  I have now made this recipe 2 more times.  I wanted to add chocolate chips, but was out of them.  So, I melted down some Godiva chocolate almond truffles for one loaf, and chocolate peanut butter truffles for the other.  In both cases, I added about a tablespoon of milk to the batter to make it a tad looser, and then folded the melted chocolate in.  Like before, I found I required an additional 5 minutes baking time.  All three times I have made this bread it has been excellent.  If you like chocolate, I highly recommend playing around with your favorite brands/flavors- so, SO good :)

I really can't say enough good things about this bread!! So, everyone that reads this pick your favorite positive adjective and insert! I cooked it a fraction longer (like 5 minutes) for a really crunchy outside, because that's how I roll ;) but there really is no need to adjust at all!!  So good it was GONE!!!

I substituted the shortening for melted butter and add chopped walnuts, peanuts, raisins, and cranberries.  I was happy that it turned out very moist.  My daughter (food critic) gave it the delicious 'thumbs up'!

Made this tonight because I had no eggs and had some bananas I needed to use up quickly.  It was fantastic! I made just a few little changes- I used about 1 1/2 cups mashed banana, 2 tbs milk and mixed in about 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I also made a glaze for the top with 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbs vanilla extract and 3 tbs hot water. Will definitely make again!

I'm the worst kind of reviewer because I change the recipe so much, but I feel it's important to say something since I used this recipe as my base... We LOVE LOVE LOVE this banana bread. It's so easy to make and we all can eat it. I ended up using 2/3 c coconut sugar and 1/3 c coconut oil. It didn't really "cream" so I added 2 T applesauce and that improved the texture. I did 1/2 unbleached wheat and 1/2 unbleached white flours, and added 1 t vanilla and 3 med. mashed bananas, and stirred in some cranberries and chocolate chips... Super super good. It did take a little longer to bake, but it was super moist and not crumbly at all. Thank you for your great recipe!

I generally hate bananas but I've always liked banana bread.  I've never made bread before and was amazed at how good this came out.  My family loved it and my 2 year old still asks for it though we've been out for a few weeks.  I'll definitely make this again. Made me feel like a real baker!

I followed the directions and did not modify the ingredients.  It is good, basic, easy to follow recipe.  But it's just that, a basic recipe that could use the help of a splash of vanilla and walnut to add some character and depth of flavor.  The bread came out on the dry side.  I doubt I'll make it again, there are better recipes out there.

I saw this recipe and thought it was perfect. I tried it and I definately was NOT disappointed. It came out beautifully. The first time I made it I followed the recipe excepted used butter rather than shortening and added some carob powder to it. My family LOVED it. I am now making a second batch and have made a couple modifications. To make it completely vegan, I used coconut oil instead of butter and again added carob powder. I also used spelt flour; however, you could use buckwheat or quinoa flour to make it gluten free as well :). Love this recipe. Thanks for sharing

I just made this banana bread tonight for dessert. I just so happened to not have eggs, so this recipe was perfect. I did have to add a splash or two of milk because my beaters were getting a work out and slowing down. It is def. a thick batter. But boy, was it good. Thanks for the recipe, this will be a family staple..Yummy!

Stuck inside because of this blizzard I have been doing all sorts of baking and well have run low on ingredients.... needless to say I found this recipe and decided to try it out. It turned out really good, and I'm enjoying eating it right now :) Although I made a few additions, including 1tsp vanilla, 1/4 chocolate chips, and 1tbs brown sugar sprinkled on top of dough once in pan. 
Would I do it again....? Yes.

I love-love-love this banana bread! Hubby loves it, friends love it. We butter our slices and savour them with tea! Tonight I baked it for a friend's dad, who had liked it so much that he asked for it again! :)  This is how I tweaked this recipe: 1/3 cup (golden) caster sugar 1/3 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup butter 2 cups wholemeal flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup mashed ripe bananas  I love the sweetness and moistness that the brown sugar adds, and the texture of the wholemeal flour!

This recipe was pretty good as far as vegan recipes go, but we preferred a more traditional banana bread. This bread had a really dense texture - almost like regular bread, without the crust - and a really strong banana flavor. We enjoyed it toasted with a little butter.

The whole family loved it!! My only issue is that I doubled the recipe, thinking I would get 4 loaves but I only got 2. Maybe I made an error somewhere. Other than that this recipe is easy and very tasty!

We loved it!  My husband is picky about banana bread so I was hoping it would be something he would like without all the 'stuff' other banana bread has. He is diabetic and is always concerned about the carbs, sugar, and other things to be mindful of.  I made it and we both loved it!  I decided it is now my favorite banana bread recipe.

This was good banana bread, very moist.  I added the vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate chips. I will definitely make it again.

My wife somehow lost her banana bread recipe card, so I found this one for her to use (I use Allrecipes all the time). It was good, but we both thought it was a little dry.

Turned out fantastic. I did not change the recipe at all. I made it into muffins instead of a loaf as my daughter likes banana muffins. The recipe made a dozen regular muffins and a dozen of the mini muffins. They were awesome served warm with a cup of tangy vanilla Greek yogurt.

I ended up baking this in one larger pan because I didn't have two small ones.   Had to guess as to how long to cook it.  I think I cooked it 40 minutes at 350 then turned it down to 325 and cooked until done.  Kicking myself for not writing down how I cooked it.  lol

Turned out great, though!

Had to use a 9X13 pan, AND I overcooked it.  It came out kind of flat.  The taste was great.  I will try again with the proper size pan.

Great recipe. I followed the suggestions from other reviewers and added cinnamon and baking powder, and substituted half of the butter with unsweetened applesauce.  I also increased the amount of vanilla and baked 2 small loaves in 1 qt Pyrex bowls. Delicious. Not too sweet. This quick bread is drier than my previous go-to recipe, less dense, and I like it.  My intention was to keep one loaf and give one to a neighbor. My husband ate one piece of the banana bread and it became clear that neither loaf was going to be leaving the house!

Delicious and easy!  I use this recipe as a jumping off point when making banana bread.  I use VERY ripe (black) bananas and sometimes add a little vanilla or nuts, an extra banana, etc. and maybe a little more butter.  It's nice to have this available for folks to snack on in the mornings or whenever.

Great recipe.   Made it this time with a handful of chocolate chips, but I think it would be delicious either way.   I ended up making mine in an 8x8x2 square pan and adjusted the time to 50 minutes.    Turned out beautiful!   Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is the first time that I have made this recipe.  It was also the first time that I made a bread recipe without eggs and milk.  This recipe was very easy to make.  I added a 1/4 cup of water once the bananas were added, which made it easier to mix up.  If the batter is any indication of how good the bread is going to be-------it is a home run!

This is a bread, not a cake/muffin/type-bread. DELICIOUS!! I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I did not add more bc I believe less is more and if the eater gets too many chips....no excitement. Leave 'em wanting more.

The best banana bread recipe I have found. I tweaked it slightly, I used brown sugar & white sugar. I used butter instead of shortening. I also added vanilla extract and I used an extra banana. Also added some white chocolate chips. Everyone loved it - it was gone the same day I made it. Very moist - I was surprised since it did not have any milk, water or egg. A definite keeper recipe!!!!

Great!  But i added 1 c. chopped pecans, substituted 1 stick butter for the shortening, added one container gerber banana baby food and a splash of water to help make it smoother and easier to pour into the pan

I made this as is and my family loved it.  It's good for taking on a day trip since it has no eggs or milk.

I liked it very much! I was looking for an eggless recipe that was easily customizable.  This turned out great - I added cinnamon and raisins :)

This will be the only recipe I use now.  My cholesterol is up so have to watch my egg intake.  I did use butter and didn't measure the bananas (used 3 medium ones).it was very moist and delicious.  Like other reviewers, I cooked it a few minutes longer.
