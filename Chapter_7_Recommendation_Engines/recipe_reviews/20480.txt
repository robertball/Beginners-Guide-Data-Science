I brought this to a family gathering and it definitely was a crowd pleaser!!!  They volunteer me to bring dessert every time now in hopes of this pie!  A perfect recipe to have when you just can't make up your mind.

This was good, but possibly too sweet. I don't mind sweet recipes but I think the sweetened condensed milk made it a bit overboard. My guests liked it, but I also cut large pieces of the pie, which could have been a problem. I am not too sure about the lemon juice in the recipe. I did really enjoy the crust, but might not make this again.

I love this pie! For anyone who had issues with it being 'runny' make sure you don't omit the lemon juice as it reacts with the condensed milk and cream cheese to make it thick. Also as the whipping cream needs to be whipped you cannot sub it with half and half. However in a pinch I have subbed it with cool whip. Looks great drizzled with fudge sauce and peanut butter cups cut in half!

This pie was absolutely wonderful! It was a rich and creamy pie - definitely a must make if you LOVE peanut butter.  I made it with a graham cracker crust instead of a chocolate crust. To add more chocolate to the pie I coated the graham cracker crust in semi-sweet chocolate chips before scooping in the filling and than used the remained of the melted chocolate in conjunction with the chocolate syrup.  It turned out great!

I made this pie because of the crust, and it is great!  I was a disturbed by the nutrition of it all, so I used fat-free cream cheese, fat-free sweetened condensed milk, and fat-free frozen whipped topping for the whipped cream.  Probably because of this, the peanut butter part ended up pretty soft, and I had to keep it in the freezer.  It was delicious though!  I'd never had a peanut butter pie before, but my husband is a big fan, and said this was one of the best!  I just love the crust!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend who loved peanut butter, and he loved it! The consistency was like a cheesecake or a mousse, it's very smooth :) Great recipe for peanut butter lovers!

Very rich dessert! The kids loved it and didn't mind the fact that I couldn't get it out of the pan. Used Chocolate flavored sweetened condensed milk.

the rice crispy crust became soggy and stale tasting because of the moisture.  I used half n half instead of heavy whipping cream so the filling was very runny but the filling flavor was good.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. It isn't an overwhelming peanut butter flavour, it's just right! 
And if you don't make the rice krispie crust, you're missing out. My only small complaint is that the crust is a little hard to cut into; I might add another quarter cup of butter/margarine next time to keep it a little softer.

I'd just rate this recipe okay, not wonderful.  The crust is interesting and different, I used 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 chocolate chips to make it instead of all chocolate.  The taste of the pie filling was a bit bland and weak for my preferences.  This isn't a bad recipe, it's just not great.  I wouldn't make this again.  Also, I set out to make 2 pies and ended up with 3 1/2 pies.  The recipe makes a lot, of both crust and filling.  Just be aware of that.

This was a big hit at Christmas dinner!  I made it the day before and put it in the freezer, then moved to the very cold garage for a few hours before dinner, to allow to soften a little.  Didn't have any "crispy rice cereal", so substituted a chocolate cookie crust, but will try the suggested crust (or a pretzel crust!) the next time.  Might also try doubling and making in a 9 x 13 pan.

This pie was sooo good. Very easy to make, and the crust is awesome! Didn't use the lemon juice, didn't see any reason to, and it was great! This will be a favorite for many years. The kids loved it too!

I made this tonight and it was AWESOME! I did change the crust and used crushed pretzels and unsalted butter instead because I thought that would be to die for, it was!

This is a very tasty recipe, and not as rich as you could think (fear?) when reading the ingredients needed. After I poured the filling into the crust, I put it in the freezer (as stated in Eagle Brand's recipe); if you do so, take the pie off the freezer and put it into the refrigerator 30 to 60 minutes before slicing: way easier and more comfortable to eat. The crust and the filling made went very good together, and I do not plan to change crust when making this pie again. What I would try, though, is to fix peanut butter ice-cream starting from the filling basis... maybe I will submit such a recipe some day ;)

Perfect as written! Though I liked it best partially frozen, it was also fabulous when just refrigerated.

I have been making this pie since my kids were little. They are in their 30’s now! I have tried other peanut butter pie recipes but this one is hands down my favorite. Sweet, smooth & luscious. My kids still ask for it every holiday we are together.
The original recipe called for chocolate cookie crust.  I use a regular pie crust but a Graham’s cracker crust works well too.

I gave this a four because I really didn't like the "crust".  I really love the pie part, but I think that next time I make this pie I will use a graham cracker crust or an oreo/chocolate cookie crust.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy. Was like a mousse.  Not overy sweet either. I did miss out on the recipes original crust. I got lazy and used a ready-made shortbread crust which I thought complimented perfectly well.

I was halfway into this recipe when I realized I didn't have any cream cheese!  In a pinch, I used 8 oz. of sour cream, which seemed to work pretty well.  The reason I made this recipe as opposed to some of the other peanut butter pie recipes was because of the crust.  I didn't want the usual graham cracker or chocolate cookie crust, and this one came out soooo yummy and so different!  I served some of the pie to guests, then devoured the rest of the pie after every one left!
