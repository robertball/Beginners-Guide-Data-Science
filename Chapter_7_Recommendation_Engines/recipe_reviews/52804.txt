Very good! I did make a few changes ro the recipe, most notably that 2 1/2 C of liquid looked very inadequate in the bottom of my 6-qt. slow cooker, so I ended up using 3 whole cans of beef broth + 1 C water. With that, 1 can of spicy V8 was still plenty hot enough to give me a little heartburn (and I love spicy foods.) I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, and an hour before the end of the cooking time I added the V8, 2 cubed potatoes, and a can of diced tomatoes. P.S. I just made this for the second time using 2 lbs. of meat and more seasoned salt/pepper and I AM IN LOVE with this recipe! Thanks a million!

This soup was mmm-mmm good!  I'm giving it five stars, although I did make quite a few changes.  First, I used fresh vegetables -- celery & carrots -- plus a can of corn, drained, and a can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I doubled the amount of beef broth, added 4 tablespoons of garlic, and added Acini di pepe (soup pasta).  I made some buttermilk biscuits, and the family loved this meal!

This is a keeper! Instead of canned veggies, I added fresh carrots (chopped), frozen corn, and  frozen peas (I do not care for canned veggies). I also added a bit more beef broth than it called for (used 2 cans).  Finally, I cooked some shell noodles and threw them in the last few minutes (the kids like soup with noodles). This turned out delish!!!

Outta this world good! We loved this!! It reminded me of the good stews that we brew when we are up north at the cabin during the fall! Will save this recipe for just such a time! I didn't measure out a TBLS of season salt - just added liberally until it "looked" right.  Also, during the last half hour when you add the V8 "spicy hot" juice & mixed veggies, I added a handful of macaroni noodles.  30 minutes later, this soup was great! Thanks for sharing this one Kim! Its a keeper for this household!

I thought this was pretty good. I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned.  I think if you had salty soup, reconsider the broth you are using. I ALWAYS use "Better than Buillon" which I find to be significantly less salty than most broths and certainly better than any buillon (which always have lots of salt and MSG).

This was great. I think the V8 juice made the difference. I made a double batch and served one as the recipe and the other half, I made into a stew by adding cubed potatoes, celery and some flour to thicken the broth.  Both were great!!

I loved the ease of this recipe - gosh crockpots are the best!! I took another's advice and added apprx 1c small seashell noodles during the last hour of cooking. My boyfriend took the leftovers to work and when he came home, I had to write the recipe out for 3 of his co-workers! Thanks Kim!

I thought it was good and it was very easy to make, but the other 5 members of my family didn't care much for it. They're spoiled by my original beef vegetable soup recipe that takes alot more work and uses fresh ingredients instead of canned vegetables. Otherwise, this is a good and simple recipe.

I've not had a lot of luck with slow cooker recipes, but this is one I'll make again.  The rich beef broth is enhanced by using seasoned salt and the Spicy V-8 juice gives it just a little zing.  I used frozen mixed veggies and added one chopped potato but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very nice soup even for a hot August day.

I liked it, I did add some pasta as a previous reviewer suggested, but it was a little soupy. I wanted it to be a big heartier.

This was a great recipe. And yes men do like it.  I was surprised that my husband said it was wonderful.  I made only one alteration I added a 1/2 cup red merlot wine.

Neither my hubs or I cared for this at all (sorry!). I was expecting a somewhat spicy soup, but what I ended up with was FAR from that. This soup was SUPER bland! My husband added hot sauce to his bowl and he said that seemed to help somewhat. Other than subbing a frozen mixed veggie blend for canned veggies (i.e. green beans, peas, corn and carrots), I made no changes to this recipe. If I am to ever make this again, I'll definitely need to up the spice factor to suit our tastes. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for us. Thanks anyways, Kim.

My family loved it, even four picky children.  I used lean stew meat, doubled the beef broth,fresh veggies and roux to thicken up the soup broth.  I served it over lightly buttered pasta shells.

This is a flavorful beef soup that is super easy to make.  A great way to use stew meat.  Frozen vegetables are an alternative to the canned.

Due to pantry contents I subbed a can of picante V8 for the spicy V8 and omitted the green pepper.  Great tasting broth.  A nice use for canned mixed veggies.

This one is simple and tasty. I recommend a couple of things: first, cut back on the 1tbsp of salt. Second, use leftover grease/fat from cooking burgers or bacon stove top to brown the meat for this recipe. It adds flavor and substance.

The was a great recipe.  I added a corn and potatoes to this soup instead of the mixed veggies.  The next time we added barley.  Both times it turned out wonderfully.  We will definatly make this again.

I was surprised that I hadn't reviewed this before.  I have been making this for years for my family and friends.  Everyone loves it.  The only change I make is I brown the beef cubes with gloves of garlic.  I've doubled it for parties, cooked it on the stove top as well as the slow cooker.  Perfect Everytime.

I also added two cans of beef broth and some elbow pasta at the end.  I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned.  It was decently good, although I felt that it could use a bit more spice maybe?  I may add some cayenne pepper next time.  Overall, a decent soup recipe!

This soup was very good and I found it easy to add my own personal touches.  I added frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned and I think next time I will throw in a diced potato.  Very good on leftovers.

Very good and simple to make!  I used frozen mixed veggies and left the onions in bigger chunks. I added some shredded cheese after I put it into bowls.  Served with cornbread and honey butter it's awesome!

Though very tasty, my crew agreed this recipe tasted just like Campbells soup.  I ended up wishing I had just opened the can instead of bothering to make a homemade dish for dinner.

It tasted a bit salty.  I have a 6 qt. slow cooker and cooked it on low for 6.5 hours. Next time I will add a cup of water. It was pretty good though.

My family loved this!  Only changes I made was...added potatoes, extra broth, extra V8, and sprinkled it with some "Tastefuly Simple" Fiesta spice (like a taco seasoning).  It turned out perfect! I served it over noodles for my 2 and 4 year old and they loved it. It was good with or without the noodles.  I will be makeing this again! THANKS!

My whole family loved this stew. My mother has already made a batch of it for her family. I did add the seashell noodles the last hour as others suggested. Even my picky husband who doesn't like stew gave this two thumbs up! This will become a regular in our house.

It's amazing that something this easy could taste so good!  This is very simple and requires almost no time.  We'll make this again for sure!

This is a wonderful soup!  Great flavor and the beef was good and tender.  I cut the beef cubes smaller when I started. I also added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste with the vegetables to make it thicker.  Just yummy!!

This is a very hearty soup.  The Spicy V8 Juice really gives it a different punch.  My husband wasn't that thrilled with it, but my dad and I liked it a lot.  (My husband isn't really much of a soup eater...)

I agree with some of the other reviews, this was pretty bland. If I make it again, I will definitely tweak with more vegetables to add flavor.

Used 2 cans of beef broth, didn't have time to sear the beef this morning so it turned out a little greasy (don't skip this step next time)

Very easy.  Very good soup.  Because of what I had in the pantry I used only 2 cups beef broth.  By mistake I added the V8 with the rest of ingrediets.  That cooked down a bit so I added another can of V8 30 minutes before serving.  Also used frozen vegetables instead of canned.  Hubby liked it a lot, and he is on Adkins.

This was very good.  I made it and didn't serve it for two days as I think soup is always better after the first day.  The only thing I changed was added more broth and red pepper flakes to season.  It was very tasty.
