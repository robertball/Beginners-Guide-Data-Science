I am giving these 5 stars because I very much enjoyed the warm comforting flavor of them.  When I made these, I had no canola oil so I used regular vegetable oil instead.  To bake them, I initially set my convection oven to 400 and baked for the first 6 minutes as instructed.  After 6 minutes I went to put the sugar on and the biscuits were already beginning to brown, although I could tell by poking them that the middles were still raw.  So I turned the oven down to 350 to finish off the baking and this worked nicely.  I agree with the other reviewer who said it would be better for the sugar to be put on top before you bake them at all; as these are now, the sugar falls off very easily.  So next time I would put the sugar on before baking and then convection bake at 350 (I would recommend 375 for non-convection) for about 14 minutes or until golden.  When I ate one of these (warm out of the oven, none of that "waiting for things to cool" business!), I tried several different toppings: nutella, peanut butter, strawberry rhubarb jam, and honey.  My favorite was the jam, but the others were great too, with the peanut butter being my least favorite.

These were pretty good. It was a base for an apple buckle.   I halved the dough and added a dash of ginger and put it in the fridge. I sliced up 2 apples and tossed them with applesauce and cinnamon sugar and put them in an 8x8 baking pan. I rolled the dough on a floured breadboard into an 8x8 square and put it over the apple mixture and pressed it down lightly and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Cooked at 400 for 25 minutes.

weeeellll...  I really like the flavor of these, but unfortunately, they burned.  I think the time is too long, or the temp too high.  I will def try again at a lower temp - and also put the sugar on before baking.  it doesn't stick after they have baked for a while.  I love scones and cardamom, so I will def try these again!

The baking temperature is definitely too high. I baked for two minutes less than the recipe calls for and the biscuits still burned.  They are somewhat dry and flat.

These were okay but I won't make them again.  They are dry - the temperature and length of time to cook are way off. And despite the most minimal handling, they aren't the most tender biscuit.  Scones or biscuits (depends on where you are, or from, as to what they're called) don't shine best, in my opinion and experience, without using a solid shortening such as butter

I think these are delicious as scones. Theyâ€™re certainly not what I would call a biscuit but as a scone... they are moist and the cardamom is a wonderful touch. Just be careful not to over-bake as they quickly dry out and burn the edges.

This recipe was pretty dry. Best served with butter and honey.
