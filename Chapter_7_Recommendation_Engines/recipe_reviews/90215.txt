At the 6 hour point I did a taste test and noticed that it was a little bland. Since my carrots needed a little more time I added a second packet of onion soup mix and another 1/2 cup water which made this a 5 star recipie!!!

I am big on flavor so i took the advice of one review to use 2 packets of onion mix, plus extra water. It was great, and super quick to prepare, it is the newest member to my hubbies growing recipe file.

This turned out wonderful for me. However I did add 2 packets of dry onion soup. I also went ahead and used 8 small potatoes and used baby carrots instead of 3 carrots cut up as the directions say.

I used a 7 bone roast and threw in a bunch of carrots celery onions and garlic along with the onion soup mix. My husband who is indifferent to most food said "this is good!" I will be making this one again!

Not too bad. A little bland but I would make it again and add more seasonings. Thanks!

Good I added Garlic and that helped. The liquid was a bit too low with the potatos on the bottom.

This was ok. It tasted somewhat like grandmas recipe but it needs carrots and maybe some celery onion and a little heat to kick it up a notch. Cut back on the potatoes. They just went kinda mushy and didn't taste very good.

YUUUUMMMYYYY! Never made a put roast in the crock pot but I'm glad I did. Here are the changes I made, not because I didn't trust your recipe but because these are the ingredients I had. I used a 3 lb. pork shoulder roast, a pint of roast beef stock, miniature carrots, a package of roast seasoning and made gravy with the drippings from the crock pot. Man was it good! Next time I will only use a half bag of dry onion soup mix or hold the onions. I actually thought of using french onion soup. Hmmm. Cooking to me is about experimenting and I thank you for a base to build on.

Well, this came out excellent. I was out of dry onion soup mix. So I used meat rub seasonning, beef broth, a dash of cayenne pepper, garlic and sliced white onions on top as to bleed its flavor on the meat. Bingo!! Loved it!

I hate to write a bad review but I followed the recipe exactly and this roast was really awful! The soup mix made it overly salty and the meat came out stringy. I still have the left overs in the fridge but can't imagine what I will do with it. We won't be making this again. Sorry.

I tried it yesterday and the beef just didn't get tender enough to be really easy to eat--important since I was feeding an elderly relative. I had never add packaged/canned soups to beef and doing so made it very easy. The taste was very good and the vegetables were great. I will cut the bottom round into small pieces and turn it into soup. I'm going to try it again but use a chuck roast since they are much more fail-safe.

Delicious! Cooked and frozen into individual servings before I had major back surgery. It was wonderful to just put in the microwave and then enjoy.

My roast of choice is shoulder. This is a simple and delicious recipe...love what onion soup can do for so many things and the way it makes the house smell while cooking.

This recipe is fast to get together and it's yummy! I've passed it along to friends too. I add onions to it but that's the only thing I changed.

This was ok. I don't think that I am much of a roast person (this is the first time I have cooked one). It was much easier than I thought and I will make it again.

This was so good! I also used 2 dry soup packets and added celery and mushrooms. Cooked on high in slow cooker for 6 hours and presto! Will definitely make again.
