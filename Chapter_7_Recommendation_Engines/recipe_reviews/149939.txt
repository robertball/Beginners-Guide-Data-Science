Very nice, tho' I did change the cooking method a bit as I've never had the best success cooking green beans in a fry pan. And in this case you were to cook the beans along with the already cooked jalapeno and shallots, which just  didn't appeal to me.  So...I cooked the vegetables first, adding more jalapeno than called for and some chopped red pepper as well (mainly because I'm on the road again in the morning and wanted to make use of what I had in the fridge). Meantime, I cooked the green beans in boiling, salted water for five minutes, then immediately shocked them in an ice water bath.   This made quick work of finishing them up in the fry pan with the sweated vegetables once I was about ready to serve, with little chance of over or undercooking them - this method also kept them a bright and vibrant green.  The lemon at the end lent a fresh flavor and brought out just the right hint of tanginess.  No worries about there being too much heat in the jalapenos, since you're not using the seeds or membranes.   Never would have thought to use jalapenos in green beans - it was an interesting and flavorful addition.

excellent recepie !!! i cook something like this all the time. i always have frozen green beans in the freezer and along with green chilli i also use a pinch of red chilli flakes and instead of lemon juice 1/2 tsp dry mango powder. all the dry spices just stick on the beans and its heavenly to eat.

I fixed as written but next time I would boil the beans for 4 or 5 minutes and stick them in an ice bath before proceeding with the recipe for they were a bit tough still. I loved the combo of the jalapenos and lemon though and I will make these again.

Little too much lemon for my taste buds and the green beans needed more time to steam, otherwise they were good. Served this with Tomato, Avocado and Corn as a starter and Chef John's Veracruz Style Red Snapper and a simple Mexican Rice II all from AR.  Tasty!  Thank you Trilly!

My wife and I really liked these. Very simple to prepare and cook. The jalapeno I chose happened to not be too hot, but the flavor came through along with the shallots. Will most definately make again!

Great recipe. I doubled it and added a little sesame seeds. I might leave a bit of the jalapeno seed in next time. My guys like things hot. Regardless, there were no left overs and everyone raved about them.

I was "doing Mexican" last night and had green beans that needed to be used.  This fit perfectly with the menu. I didn't have shallots so used some finely diced red onion and crushed garlic.  I doubt we would make this often, but if I did a Mexican theme again, I certainly would.

These were very good.  Next time I will use the whole half of jalopeno.  I used a half of a half because my pepper was so big.  The lemon juice really brightened the flavor.  thanks for sharing!

Very good!  My entire family liked this side. Next time I think I will use the entire jalapeno pepper though.  I will definitely make this one again!

This was just great! Thanks for sharing.  Folks should use common sense on the amount of chilies they use(according to their tolerance level) as well as the amount of lemon juice...I am making this again tonight!

It was far too lemony by adding the lemon juice at the end.  Tried it a second time, skipping that step, and it was ok.  Hot, but not spicy.

2.14.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/149939/spicy-green-beans/ ... This tasted like dishes that were prepared separately & put together to save space in the refrigerator.  :/  I thought lime juice would better suit the dish, but other than that, not much different.  I'll put leftovers in soup.
