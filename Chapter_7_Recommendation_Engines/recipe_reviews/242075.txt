We love rhubarb crisp and this was a good recipe for us. I reduced the sugar to 2 tbsps in the fruit filling, not 1/2 cup, omitted the water and used 2 tbsps flour not 1 tbsp as I used frozen rhubarb that I had thawed and drained. Baked in 45 minutes in my oven. Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous! Not overly sweet (which is how we like it). Instead of allspice, I added 1/4 t  nutmeg and 1/4 t cloves. I also added 1 t vanilla to the crisp ingredients and additional oats. Perfect for us.

Great recipe!  I increased the rhubarb to 4 c. because I had a lot, but otherwise made no changes.

This is by far my favorite rhubarb crisp recipe!  I like a high crumble to fruit ratio and this is the first time I've not had to make 1 and 1/2 times the crumble to have enough.  Just right without covering up the fruit. Other reviewers have not used the optional allspice and have substituted other spices which I'm sure is also good but if you have it on hand, use it!  It seriously enhances the rhubarb and the crisp. The only changes I made are cutting the white sugar in half (I like the tartness of the rhubarb) and I add the cinnamon & allspice  to the crumble mixture as I prefer the spice in with the oatmeal. I've made it as written and once it's in your mouth, you can't really tell which portion was spiced and which was not. Just a mental thing for me.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan instead. Everyone loved it and I received comments of "it's perfectly sweet and tart together." It was served with vanilla ice cream fresh out of the oven.

Made it again, in a 9x13 doubling everything and adding two more cups of rhubarb (8 total) and leaving out the allspice this time.   turned out great!

Doubled like so many. Did the crumb topping in the food processor for speed. Added a little salt to the filling because it enhances the sweetness. keeping this oneonmy list!

Fantastic recipe! Easy to make and tastes great. I made this as a desert for a barbecue we had. What makes it unique is the bottom crust.  Right out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream over top and you've got a winner. This will become a springtime go-to.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll try cutting the recipe for the topping in half and putting it just on the top rather than both top and bottom, in order to reduce the amount of butter.

Have made many crisps  and they were just okay but this one is a keeper.  Made it with fresh rhubarb, absolutely delicious!  I only made two change I added a little lemon zest because I think it adds a little zip to rhubarb plus I added a little nutmeg instead of allspice.  Will be making this again soon.

This was absolutely delicious! I used this recipe because I had all the ingredients and so pleased I did! Only thing I added was chia seeds to the rhubarb mixture and only because I like them! Perfect!

This was very sweet with a nice tartness from the rhubarb. I was looking for a recipe to use rhubarb in, when I came across this recipe. I've never had rhubarb before and wasn't sure that I would like it but this recipe really sweetens it up for a tasty dessert.

I made the mistake of telling my wife to follow this recipe before reading over it. Even with 30% more rhubarb than what it calls for, all you can taste in this one is oatmeal. A thick mushy layer of oatmeal on the bottom ruins this dish

Amazing and delicious.  Perfect balance of sweet and tart. I halfed the oat mixture and did it just on top of the fruit, and it still turned out beautifully. I did add an extra cup or so of rhubarb.  It's all I can do not to eat the entire pan in one sitting.

I used frozen rhubarb, so I increased the amount by one cup.  Thawed it first in the microwave, then drained.  Also, I only had finely ground oats, but it worked our just fine.  The guests loved it.

I will definitely make this again, it wasn't too sweet and had a little crunch that made texture less like mush.
I substituted Bacardi rum for the water, did not have allspice, so I grated some nutmeg. I also used Maple flakes for half the sugar.

This has been my "go-to" dessert this summer.  I've combined apples with the rhubarb and raspberries with the rhubarb.  I cut the brown sugar in half.  It's plenty sweet!

Doubled the recipe. Did not add water since the rhubarb had plenty enough moisture. Next time would have blind baked the bottom layer for a few minutes before adding rhubarb.

I made the recipe as directed and it was very tasty! It has a high crumble to fruit ratio, though, and I generally prefer more fruit than crumble in my crisps. I think I will increase the fruit by a couple of cups next time.

Made 2 -8" pans. Family and friends  loved it. Only change I made was to  increase the rhubarb from 3 cups to 4.  The tarty and  sweet taste was perfect. Definitely will be making again.

Perfect! I thought I was going to end up with too much crisp and not enough filling, but it was just right. I did substitutions for my diet: Splenda for the white sugar and half-n-half Splenda and coconut sugar for the brown sugar. Also added a pinch of salt to both the filling and the crisp. So good!

Wow! Finally a recipe that you don’t need to make any changes. I love vanilla when I bake so I added it just like another reviewer did. It would be great without it but I like the vanilla in baking! It was amazing and it had perfect sweet and tart taste!

A perfect blend of flavours for Mom's Rhubarb Crisp.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  I was surprised by how quickly I was able to put it all together and into the oven.

I used 5 cups of rhubarb because I had lots. Added the Allspice which I would do again. It adds a very different, almost too strong flavour.  It is quite tart so when serving we added  very sweet Dandilon Jelly

It was very VERY good, since I’ve had no access to fresh rhubarb I had to get frozen chunks. I let them defrost and then added a can of strawberry/rhubarb pie mix. Perfect recipe! Thanks!

I love this one!  I had  WAY more rhubarab than 3 cups so I adjusted servings to 12 and used a 8 x12 glass pan for it.  It turned out great!

Excellent; doubled the recipe and made in a 9 x 13" pan.  Baking it for 45 minutes was too long as the rhubarb was mushy but still very good. Will finish eating it over ice cream. Yum!

I didn't have a 8x8 pan @ the time so I used a 13x9 it worked out great the only difference was the layers were little thin.But very tasty.

Wow!   This recipe is delicious!  Dangerously delicious.   I think I could eat the whole pan.  I added slightly more then 3 cups of rhubarb but left the rest of the recipe the same.

I found some rhubarb at the local garden center and suddenly had a craving for MY mom’s rhubarb crisp.  Got home and couldn’t find her recipe anywhere so did a quick allrecipes search and found this.  Dad was coming over for dinner and I was under a time crunch, so I chopped up the rhubarb and tossed it in the pan, poured the flour and sugar blend over the top and popped that in the oven while mixing up the oatmeal mixture - just like I remember Mom doing.  Then I spread all of the oatmeal mixture over the top of the warmed rhubarb and back into the oven for 45 minutes.  Perfection!  Dad  thought it tasted great, we all loved it - tart but sweet, slightly crunchy topping.  So good - just like Mom use to make!  Thank you!  Buy the way, when I came back to write the review, I actually read through the directions and found out half of the crumb mixture was suppose to go on the bottom! :-) I might have to try it that way next time- even though it is not the way my mom made rhubarb crisp ;-)

Very simple, very tasty.  I used coconut sugar instead of white and brown sugars - came out a bit richer, but still delicious!
