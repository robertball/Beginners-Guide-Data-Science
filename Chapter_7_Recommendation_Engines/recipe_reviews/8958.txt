I never cook the meat for recipes like this. I file the recipe away in a "leftovers" folder in my recipe box & wait until I have leftovers. (I almost always make extra when grilling or broiling chicken, steaks, pork chops, etc & then use them in salads, pasta dishes, soups, stirfrys...the list is endless). For this recipe I used leftover turkey from  Herb Roasted Turkey Breast (from this site) & cubed it. I scaled the recipe down to two since it was just me for lunch, only I knew it was going to take a lot more than 1/2 cup of broth to cook the noodles so I added extra. Quite a bit actually as I had to keep adding it to keep it from running dry. I did not thaw the veggies (didn't see the point) & I used a large clove of roasted garlic instead of the powder. When the noodles were about half done, I added the turkey & sprinkled on some Wondra flour (it's an instant flour used to thicken sauces & gravies)....very good & extremely quick...thanks Christine!

I thought this was really good, but I added a lot of my own ingredients.  I made it more lemony.  :)

I gave this 5 stars because my very picky eater ate it up. My 10 year old is terribly picky and HATES cheese. She ate this and my other daughters were able to sprinkle cheese on top of theirs. I don't cook to please the picky eaters, but it was nice to find something everyone liked. :)

This was OK. I cooked chicken with salt & pepper in a little olive oil, and added fresh garlic  and basil part way through cooking. I removed the chicken from the pan, and added the stock. That helped to deglaze the pan and add flavor to the pasta when I added it. It also took WAY more stock than called for. I didn't thaw the vegetables first, either. 
It was OK, I'd make it again when I'm in a hurry.

Not bad, but very bland. I doubled the chicken broth, and cooking the noodles in the broth did help flavor wise. I surely wouldn't cook the noodles separately, as the noodles DID pick up flavor in absorbing the broth.  Along with the noodles and broth, I cooked cut up carrots, red pepper, onions, a little broccoli, as well as fresh basil. Stirred in fresh spinach and added left over cooked (boiled) chicken last.

Very, very healthy light pasta meal for someone like me who is losing weight.  Instead of using all four WHOLE chicken breasts, I diced 2 chicken breasts.  Came out like a stir fry without the added sodium but all the flavor!  Thank you Christine!

This dish was good. I thought there could be a few adjustments, though. The amount of noodles could probably be cut in half for the amount of broth called for. I ended up having to double the broth to a quart. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. That seems to be the norm for a dish this size. I was a bit liberal with the garlic powder, as well. My chicken was overcooked when all was said and done, so maybe next time I will not brown it as long beforehand. Thanks for sharing.

Not Fancy,  but it saved my bacon.   I was running late, without a clue as to what to fix.  My man wants his food by 5pm.  I had chicken breasts, not fully thawed, noodles and broth.  I key it in and found this.  I pretty much made it as directed, and added a tsp. of poultry season.   I dreaded the reactions,  but they loved it and claimed it a keeper.

I have made this recipe many times now.  I can't believe I hadn't rated & reviewed it!  If you're looking for an easy chicken noodle soup, this is the one!  My kids absolutely love this!  I do tend to use a lot more chicken broth than the recipe calls for but maybe I just like my soup....soupier.  :)  Instead of mixed veggies, I slice up fresh carrots.  I have made this soup using boneless chicken breasts as the recipe states and with canned chicken....both had no leftovers when all was said and done!  Love it!

Great recipe.  We used fresh basil because we had it in the garden.  Also all I had was an Asian Veggie mix in the freeze so we used it.  Thought it would be bland but had great flavor.  Easy dinner and got to love that you can make it in one pan-makes for easy clean up!

when I make this for the fam they love it, even the picky eaters! My advice make sure to mix the noodles into the broth well otherwise they will stay hard.

I cooked my bone-in chicken in the microwave and pulled it instead of cooking in the pan (I like the texture better).  It was really quick and easy!

I thought this recipe was quick and easy.  It's a very simple recipe, so if you're looking for gourmet, this is not the one.  But, for a quick lunch for the kids, I recommend this.

I made this last nite , I was very disappointed my husband and I didn't like it. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have noodles so I substituted a different kind of macaroni.  The dish had no flavor it was very bland. Maybe I'll try again with the correct noodles and definitely add seasonings

I hate to be judgmental of someone's recipe, but I found this one to be a strike out. It is too bland, and sauce is too runny so it doesn't stick to the noodles or the meat. I had to add fresh garlic, onion, more broth, and butter to make this more palatable.

I made changes to this. I made it more indian. I marinated the chicken in red chill powder, turmeric and salt. Then i cooked it in oil, onions, and cumin seeds. I cooked for 20 mins and didn't separate it. I added the broth but needed way more and i didn't have more, so i added water and more salt. I added mixed vegetables and no basil. I cooked the egg noodles for 20 mins and because of more liquid, i had to add siracha. It taste great. They don't taste spicy or anything. It tasted balance. I just thought the original recipe was slightly bland.

This recipe should definitely call for more broth, but I still found it to be very flavorful and quite good. Also, there was no way that the whole meal was going to fit in a "medium skillet." Not sure if anyone else encountered that problem.... I will definitely make it again, though!

It was easy and really yummy! The picky kids even ate it! Didn't want to open a can to just use a little out of it, so I used sun dried tomatoes instead. And I added a lot more Italian seasoning. Yu-uummm!!!

Not bad.  I can't say it was a huge it with others at my home but I enjoyed it.  A little bland as written. I added quite a bit of seasoning and it was improved!
