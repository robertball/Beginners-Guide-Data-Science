Not crazy about the sauce but the combination of pear and cinnamon makes it delicious.

Made this recipe exactly as written with leftover Marsala wine from Chicken Marsala. We did not have ice cream so served with cool whip instead.

If you use ice cream don't worry about the recommended cooling time the marriage of the warm pear and the ice cream make for a delightful results. Next time I'll peel the pear. My wife loved it!

This recipe was divine AND was easy!! My husband and I loved it! I substituted apple juice for the wine since I didn't have any wine on hand and I also substituted cloves for nutmeg (just as a personal preference). Will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! The cinnamon and nutmeg complete the sauce. I did as recipe said for ingredients. No adjustments and I’m glad I didn’t. Yummy! I did cut the sugar in 1/2 and may even try less next time. I poured the sauce into the skillet when it was bubbling and then added the pears. 20 minutes later it was ready. No need to cool as I topped with a scoop of ice cream. A recipe I will use over and over. We have 2 pear trees and I’m excited to find a tasty recipe to use.

This is an easy and delicious dessert.  I make  it for all of our dinner parties now.  Everyone loves the taste and always wants the recipe.  I did not use the nutmeg.  It is the perfect dessert to finish a meal.

Delicious and easy. However, there was not enough liquid so I would double the recipe.

I made this with the seasonings as written, but used two apples (red delicious) and 2 Bosc pears, sliced into 8ths rather than halves. Absolutely wonderful.  I will make this again.

We used a semi-sweet mead instead of the Marsala. Yum!
