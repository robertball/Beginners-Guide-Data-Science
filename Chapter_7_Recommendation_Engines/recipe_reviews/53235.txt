You have to try it this way...even though I forgot the eggs, I substituted the bread crumbs for corn tortillas I chopped in the food processor (it equals the same amount of calories as the bread crumbs), and I even omitted the cheese to save on fat and calories. I topped it w/ thinly sliced onions and salsa for the last 15 minutes. This tasted like an enchilada w/out all of the fat and calories. I also used my own blend of spices w/ no salt...salsa has plenty of salt in it already. I know I changed this recipe around, but thanks for the idea...it will definately be cooked in my house again!

We loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes based on the some of the reviews.  I added an extra tablespoon of both salsa and ranch dressing.  I accidently added the cheese in with the meat mixture, so I added an additional 1/2 cup to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking, and then broiled it a few minutes to brown it.  Also made my  own bread crumbs with 2 pieces of toast.  Very moist and great flavor!  Will make again the same way!

This meatloaf was wonderful. My picky eaters devoured the whole thing. After reading the other comments I didn't put all the breadcrumbs in and it was very moist.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I did a bunch of adjustments though.  I used 1.3lb ground turkey (99% fat free).  I added 3 tbsp of salsa since I figured the lean turkey would be dry.  Then I added only 1c plain breadcrumbs and ~1/4c rolled oat.  I did follow the other suggestions and added only 1/2 packet of taco seaoning, added some thawed corn and also 1/2c cheese inside as well.  My husband isn't big on onions, so I put in some onion powder instead.  It had tons of flavor and was very moist.  My husband is picky, but loved it!  I will definitely make this again.  I don't eat beef, so this is a great alternative for my family!

This was very easy and was good.  I added chopped onion and used sour cream instead of dressing.  I also used 2 pounds of chicken and increased the ingredients accordingly.  There was a lot for leftovers.  It is great re-heated!

This was yummy, even my 5 year old ate a big slice and he's very picky. I had no taco seaoning packet so I used about two tablespoons of some southwest seasoning I had. I also cut down on the bread crumbs by a 1/4 cup or so. This was really tasty and I will definitely make again.

Do try this!  I used ground turkey, but I'm sure it's just as good with the ground chicken.  Also, I used fajita seasoning because that is what I had on hand.  My hubby declared it was just like his mom's real meatloaf, and was shocked to hear there was Ranch and fajita seasoning in it.  He practically didn't believe me because it just didn't have a ranch/mexi taste.  This is easy to prepare and so tasty.  Thanks!

This recipe turned out great!!! It was delicious, the instructions were clear and it was very quick and easy to make. I think a layer of grated cheese in the middle would really taste good too!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted in my life!  I followed the recipe exactly but cut down slightly on the bread crumbs.  I also made it in a muffin tin as mini meatloaves instead of in a full size loaf pan.  Baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes(I stuck a thermometer in to make sure the chicken was cooked).  It was so amazingly moist that I thought it was raw!!!!  But the thermometer read that the chicken was done so I trusted it!  Great flavour, so moist that it's not even like meatloaf!!!!  5 stars and will be made over and over! EDIT*** I forgot to mention that I used whole chicken breasts because I didn't have any ground chicken and I just placed them in a food processor with all the other ingredients.

Fantastic!  So yummy! I am not a big fan of meatloaf and the hubby and kiddos are, so thought I would try something appealing to me!  This was a hit with the whole family!  You definitely need to add a little more ranch and salsa though, so it it not dry!  With salsa on top it is perfect!

This was a good lean meal.  I made mine with egg beaters and home made bread crumbs.  I used pineapple salsa and it was good.  I am going to use more salsa next though.

It's a great recipe, however 1 1/2 cups is way to much bread crumbs! The meatloaf came out very very dry. So either put less bread crumbs or more meat. I think it was supposed to be 2 pounds of meat. So anyone using this recipe make sure you add more meat or less bread crumbs!

I really liked this recipie, but my fiance thought there was too much taco flavor.  We made it according to the recipie, and we didn't find it to be too dry, and thought it held together really well.  We did use turkey though, because the store didn't have any ground chicken.

AWESOME!  My whole family loved it, even the 3 year old!  This will be served again and again in our home!  I used toast to make the breadcrumbs and added chopped peppers and onions. I also baked a little cheese inside as well as topping it with the cheese and it was fabulous!
****Since this review I have made this at least 3 times a month and have changed it almost every time!  It is just as good with ground Turkey as it is with chicken and Ritz crackers are a great substitute for the bread crumbs!  We love it with cheese on top or a salsa sour cream mixture!  Enjoy

Pretty good. However, if I would have baked for an hour it would have been really dry. After 40 minutes it was kinda dry but still good. Only used 1 cup of bread crumbs and used taco sauce instead of the salsa.

Very good. Like others, I modified slightly (who doesn't). I used Fajita seasoning and, taking a cue from others, I added more salad dressing and salsa. I also had some left-over taco shells that I crushed and used instead of bread crumbs. I didn't have that many so I used that and cracker crumbs. Turned out very well. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

AMAZING! My family absolutely loves this meatloaf. I didn't have any salad dressing in the house but it was still delicous. The consistency also works for my picky 14 month old, who is beginning to feed himself. This recipe is definately going on our favorites list.

The taste was OK, but the texture was odd and only 1 out of 4 of my family members would eat it. Frozen Pizzia to the rescue

We are major taco lovers so this was right up our alley! I made a few changes. I tore up 5 pieces of white bread (however much that amounts to), 5 tbs of salsa (instead of 3), 3tbs of ranch (instead of 2) and used mozzarella cheese (instead of cheddar ) We LOVED it. Also had sour cream and mild taco sauce on the side to dip it in and making this was SO fast and easy!

I followed the recipe exactly and I was so pleased with the results. My husband loves meatloaf and was hesitant about a chicken meatloaf but one bite was all it took to turn his frown upside down. My toddler and preschooler gobbled this up too, which made it a real winner in my book.

A little too dry for my liking, and that usually isn't the case with ground chicken. Perhaps too many bread crumbs. I won't be making this again.

I like this recipe very much.  I made a few changes after reading other reviews.  I added a small chopped onion, reduced bread crumbs to 1 cup, added extra tablespoon of Ranch and salsa, a cup of corn, a TBSP chopped jalapeno and TBSP garlic powder and added cheese to meat mixture.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was pretty good. Didn't really know what to expect, but I guess I was hoping it would be a little less dry or firm. Alterations made, used 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of the 1 1/2. Found it to be a bit on the salty side with using a whole package of taco seasoning mix. I love spicy, but this was more salty than spicy. Kids thought it was just ok.

My family loves this recipe! We top it with sour cream and pico de gallo or salsa.  I have made this with ground turkey when I can't find ground chicken.  It comes out great either way.  I  did not give this 5 stars because I did tweak the recipe some.  I double the salsa and ranch to make it come out really moist.  I cut the seasoning in half since doubling the liquid ingredients add great flavor.  I save the other half of the packet for when we have this loaf again.  The last time I made this I tried ground tortilla chips like other users recommended and it was a flop.  Still tasted great, but the texture was horrid and it was not eaten with as much enthusiasm as usual.  All in all this is a great recipe and a family favorite.

My family loves spicy food so this was a big hit.  I did make a few modifications- I added diced onions, used spicy ranch dressing instead of regular ranch dressing & replaced the bread crumbs with Panko spicy hot chipotle seasoned bread crumbs.  My family loved it so much that they have requested this meatloaf on the weekly menu!

Oh my gosh! I have never had ground Turkey before and the husband didn't want to eat it, but once he had a taste he ate almost all of it! Took advice and did 1.25 pkg of ground turkey, eggs only 1 cup bread crumbs, 4 Tbsp salsa, 3 Tbsp Ranch, 1/2 taco seasoning, 1/2 cup mild cheddar and 1 sm can of whole corn. Mixed it together and made individual loaves at 325 for 35 minutes. Last few I added a little mild cheddar to the top until melted and served with salsa and sour cream.

Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe, it is now one of our favorites!

Pretty good used ground turkey instead of chicken. I will had more salsa the next time, I found it a bit dry. As well, I added cheese to the mixture as well as on top.

I changed up the recipe a little bit. Instead of bread crumbs I put tortilla chips in my blender and used that. I also make my own taco seasoning and used that. My husband loved this. He said it tasted like chicken enchiladas. Finding recipes that he likes is great because he is so picky so I really give this one a 5 star!

This was a bit dry,  but I'll definitely be making it again.  I added the suggested amount of breadcrumbs and nexxt time I'll  either cut it in half or maybe just use 1 cup.  I did add an extra tablespoon each of salsa and ranch. We topped it with sour cream, shredded lettuce, and extra salsa. My son cleaned his plate, which makes this one a winner!

Loved this! Zesty, flavorful, and pretty low calorie. I followed many peoples suggestions, and reduced the bread crumbs to 1 cup, and increased the salsa to 1/4 cup and the ranch to 3 tbsp. I also added a large can of sliced black olives. I served it with a dollop of sour cream and a spoonful of salsa. 

I think next time, I will play even more. I want to try adding canned black beans, using crushed tortilla chips instead of bread crumbs, and adding minced garlic and fresh chopped cilantro.

I'm rating this recipe 4 stars because I did not follow it as exact. I love the idea of turning a meatloaf into a taco inspired taste. So I didn't have salsa, ranch dressing or bread crumbs. Instead I used 2 lbs of ground chicken, 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cups of instant oats, fresh minced garlic, scallions, one packet of mild taco seasoning with half packet of the hot taco seasoning. In place of the ranch dressing I used sour cream and mixed everything together. I then let the meat mixture sit in the fridge for 4-5 hours before baking in the oven at 350 for an hour. Oh I also didn't use any cheese in this recipe. So in place of melting cheese on top I used a small can of tomato sauce with half can of tomato paste and sprinkled in some mild taco seasoning - to make a enchilada inspired taste. For my dish I used a 9 x 4 dish and coated with extra virgin olive oil and place down 2 Ole corn tortillas and a thin layer of my tomato sauce mixture. I then formed my loaf and topped off with the rest of my sauce on top. I served it with brown rice & black beans, steamed brussel sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower. I enjoyed this so much! Def will make this again - not sure if I'll actually make the exact recipe reference... I preferred my creation with fresher ingredients.

Delicious!  Only changes to original were to cut bread crumbs down to 1 cup and spread additional salsa on top before baking to keep it from drying out.  Served it with Goya Black Beans & Rice and a veggie...meal was a hit!

Yummy!  My husband and I really like this recipe.  I don't add anything else to it but I'm sure you could add some red, orange or yellow peppers with a bit of onion if you had extra of to use.  I don't add the sour cream on at the end, just don't think it needs it.  I do mix the cheddar in though instead of on top at end.  Thank you for the wonderful easy to make recipe.

Very nice change of pace from the regular meatloaf.  I added mexican blend cheese into the mixture and topped it off with it too. Next time, I will use more taco seasoning for a little more zest. Overall, very good.

So this was delicious. I followed most of the instructions but did my own twist. I did less than 1 c of breadcrumbs, 3 tblsp salsa, 1 tlbs ranch. I also added some red and yellow peppers as well as some chopped jalepeno pepper, for an added kick. I also threw in some frozen corn and chopped onion and 1 tblsp minced garlic. I had some fresh cilantro and chopped a little bit of that and threw it in there as well. It was fabulous!

YUM! I made a few small changes - the ingredient quantities seemed closer to what I use for 2 lbs of meat, so I used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef (which is how I usually make meatloaf) and did NOT adjust the proportions. I was a little short on bread crumbs, and I added the cheese to the meat mixture. Will melt extra cheese on top next time, too. Delicious! Made it last night, and my fiance and I enjoyed leftovers for lunch today too. Shared the recipe with my mother, and will definitely make this again!

How can you go wrong with this one? I use ground chicken a lot and have had mixed turn out with consistency.  I found using a 12 grain bread instead of bread crumbs is helpful with moistness every time I use the chicken, so I used half the bread crumbs and half the 12 grain bread.  I decided to make this meat mixture into stuffed red peppers and at the end I sprinkled the cheese on top and then crushed some tortilla chips and put that on top for a little crunch....delicious!  Thanks Linda for the idea.  My husband only eats chicken so it is always great to get new ideas!

I just LOVE this recipe.... I had never been a big meat loaf fan until I tried this. We had it last night for diner, and I tried a few adjustments this time.... I didn't have any taco seasoning, so I just added a bit of paprika and chili powder to the mixture, and mixed in 2 links of chorrizo sausage for a little extra "zest". I added the cheese into the mixture, and topped the loaf with another handful of cheese and crumbled tortilla chips 20 before it finished baking. Yum yum! This will definitely be a constant in our house.

This was super duper easy to make. I really wanted to find something different to cook with so I picked up some ground chicken. No one even knew it was chicken and it was gone within minutes.  I will be cooking this again.

I made this last night and was very disappointed. I only added 1 cup of the bread crumbs and it was too dry. I added all of the Taco seasoning but I wish I had only used half because it was too overpowering for Chicken. I won't ever make this again. I only gave it one star for creativity but there are much better ways to use ground chicken. Leave the taco seasoning for ground beef.

This was okay.  I think 1 ½ cups of bread crumbs is too much.  It made the loaf dry and gave it a processed taste.  The bread crumbs also overpowered the other flavors.  May try again but will decrease the amount of bread crumbs.

We really liked this, but I needed to add to it a bit to make it more exciting. My adds/changes: used only 1/2 packet taco seasoning and added 1 small, 7oz can of corn, one small onion- diced and sauteed, 1/2 tblsp chopped, sauteed garlic, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, used fresh breadcrumbs, and substituted 1/4 cup ranch dressing/sour cream combo. Also added cheese and salsa inside and out. Served with sour cream and guacamole. My husband loves this!

The texture of this meatloaf is what threw me off.  It didn't taste bad but didn't blow me away.  I just couldn't get past the toughness of the meat.  I think I'll stick to old fashioned ground beef meatloaf because this just didn't do it for me.

Meatloaf turned out great.  Consider topping with picante sauce after it's done for more moisture.  It was really good.

It was a little dense, but okay.  I guess I found the whole to be a little less than the sum of the parts: not as good as I anticipated.

Tastes very Mexican. My Husband and Son absolutely loved this meatloaf. If you like mexican flavor, this is an absolute must. Great change from traditional meatloaf! Easy to make! Thanks for this one!

I omitted the ranch, taco seasoning & sour cream to keep the salt & fat low. I used extra hot salsa for flavor. I also added a green pepper & onion. I baked them in a muffin pan so I had individual servings. Served with sweet potato & broccoli. Easy to freeze for a quick dinner!

My family loved this. I prepared it exactly as set out in the recipe and it turned out perfect. Very flavourful with a nice crust outside and moist on the inside. Great tasting, simple and kid-friendly. Five stars.

Great change of pace! I pulsed some tortilla chips in the food processor and used in place of bread crumbs. Also sautéed a diced red pepper and added that. Would have done onion too but didn't have one. Finally, served salsa verde on side. Tastes just like chicken enchiladas,

Did not care for this all that much. Could not taste any of the spice from the taco seasoning or salsa - the breadcrumbs made it just bland.

So good! Everyone loved it, even my 2 yr old! I added an extra tablespoon of salsa and ranch like a review suggested, perfect! I used a garlic cilantro salsa from Muir Glen and the flavor was to die for!!

This is great, I even got my picky son who eats nothing to go back for seconds, I ground up some veggies with the food processor and mixed it in bc my son won't eat veggies, he didn't even notice, I used half of the taco mix, I wld recommend to use 1 1/2 -2lbs of chicken and use ingredients according  bc it does not mk much esp if ur hv a 6'7 man eating it.... I added cheese in the mix also, it was not dry at all.... Love it and will be making it again...

I read the reviews on this before i even made it, glad I did cause it turned out good. I used 5 Tablespoons of Salsa and 4 Tablespoons of Ranch dressing along with half packet of taco seasoning. It wasn't dry at all. Moist and delish.

I really enjoyed this easy version of meatloaf. My only change was to use ground beef. Sorry! I know thats the MAIN ingredient but for those thinking of using GB instead of chicken, I will say it turned out great anyway:)

We loved this!!  I used ground turkey instead of chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The sour cream and cheese makes it.  A great twist on the regular meatlof.  I'm sure that it would work with ground beef too.

We thought this was a fantastic flavored, easy to make recipe.  We substitured ground turkey.  No grease and it held together great.  Next time we're going to make it as turkey burgers for the grill.

This was fantabulous!!!!  I made it in a hurry...I wanted to do something different with my ground chicken...I saw the recipe...only needed the breadcrumbs.  Well I am just glad I didn't read the reviews before I cooked it...because it was delicious just the way it was, totally following the recipe!! I plan on adding onions next time...just to see if they add any more flavor...but I think this was spot on good!!

Maybe because I did not have the ranch and salsa but this seemed bland.  Used sour cream and rotel instead.  It was pretty good, but I'll season it better next time.  Gave me something to do with my ground chicken anyway.  And I only had one cup bread crumbs and it seemed to work ok

Very good. Didn't have ranch dressing , so i used bbq sauce. Think it would also be excellent using chicken stovetop stuffing instead of bread crumbs. Nice, not having the greasiness of ground beef.

Maybe it was just my taste buds.  I used 1/4 cup less of bread crumbs (as suggested) and it was still too dry.  The texture of the meal was just odd, even for 'meatloaf'.  So, maybe I'm not a fan of chicken meatloaf, but I'll stick to regular meatloaf.

I wasn't fond of the texture of the ground chicken and my husband thought that the taco seasoning was too strong. My thought was "I wonder how this would taste with good ol' ground beef." I guess I am not ready to accept "healthier" versions of meatloaf yet.

I don't think there's anything wrong with this recipe.  It was just a little too out there for my taste.  Hubby liked it just fine though.  So, if you want a different twist on meatloaf, then give it a try... but if you're a traditionalist with meatloaf, then realize that and pass on this recipe.

This was great, I used the crushed tortilla chips and we all loved it.  Very quick and easy.  I also didn't read my directions and added the cheese to the loaf and mixed it up.

Great recipe.  Gave it 4 stars as I did alter it a bit.  Added chopped onions (as I do to most recipes!), omitted ranch dressing as my husband doesn't care for it and used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup oatmeal.  Very moist.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious- I added half a small can of diced green chiles for some extra zest and spread a few tablespoons of salsa over the top, followed by more chiles and the cheese for the last 5 minutes of baking.  Also, reducing the breadcrumbs to 1 cup makes for a wonderfully moist version.

A little dry. I'd add another egg to help keep it moist. We're not onion fans, so I just added a little dehydrated minced onion and it was fine. If you're going to do that though, you should most definetely add some other type of seasoning. If not, it's kind of bland. This recipe is an awesome base for adding your own seasonings. I'll defintely make it again!

It definitely gets 5 stars for originality.  It is a nice change of pace from the regular ketchup meatloaf.  My boyfriend (not the biggest fan of meatloaf) requests this dish constantly...I'll have to show him how to make it.  Give this one a try...it's great!

What a quick, easy, tasty recipe this is. I made it as written (apart from the ranch style dressing which I didn't have) and it was much appreciated by the family. Thank you for sharing.

I just finished making this meatloaf; it was very good and easy.  I made it with ground turkey, sour cream instead of ranch dressing, chopped (in food processor) stale taco chips instead of bread crumbs) and added about 1/4 cup cheese in mix as well as recommended amount on top (then baked to melt & brown). Very moist & tasty!!!

This was a great change.  I used cooked chicken and "ground" it in my processor.  I also only had fajita seasoning, but it still turned out wonderful!  Thanks!!

I was really pleased with this recipe.  It was served with white rice and black beans. I made some changes due to some of the reviews and added more salsa.  Since I didn't have any ranch dressing I added sour cream instead and used a cheesy taco seasoning.  My guests and family enjoyed their meal and made sure to tell me that this recipe is definitely one of their favorite dishes I have made.  I will make this one again and again.  Very easy to prepare and I had all the ingredients already at home.

We tried this recipe with meatless ground chicken, and it worked out really well! I'm going to encourage vegetarian friends to try it out sometime.

I made a half batch about 3 weeks ago with left over chicken I had from another recipe i was making and froze it until tonight. I used ground chicken thigh meat which made it very juice...combined with I replaced the taco seasoning with cayanne pepper and fresh hot peppers. My husband I liked it, it was nice to have something different for dinner. I added corn like somebody else had mentioned and it was perfect!

This is a good basic recipe, made better with some improvisations.
Instead of packaged "taco seasoning" I used cumin, fresh cilantro, ground ancho chili pepper and some cayenne. It also needed a pinch of salt. I also mixed some frozen corn in to the meat mixture. 
Everyone loved it served with shredded cheddar and some sour cream!
Delicious!

This was wonderful!  After taking it out of the oven, it appeared so dry and drab.  But after throwing on some shredded cheddar cheese, warming it back up and serving it with a dollop of sour cream, it was great!  It has a different texture than normal meatloaf.  I used ground turkey and used the Kitchen Aid mixer to mix the ingredients.  It was easy to make, easy to mix and easy to slice for a nice presentation.  My husband even enjoyed it and he's not a meatloaf lover.  I would definately make it again and wouldn't change a thing.

AWESOME!  We loved this!!  Definitely top off with sour cream and cheese! YUM!
I didn't have ground chicken, I used ground turkey, that's all I ever buy.
This one is a keeper!  Very interesting.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

My husband loved it.  I'm always looking for new things to make with chicken and this was definitely different.  I was able to use a bunch of items sitting around my house too.  I didn't have ranch dressing, so I used low-fat creamy cucumber and it tasted wonderful.  I found the sour cream was a definite side order, otherwise it would have been too dry for me.  Thanks!

I was looking for something different and found this recipe.  Will it taste great it was rather dry and dense.  I topped with sour cream and extra salsa like someone suggested, but it still din't cut it.  The flavors mesh well together so I would like to give it a try again! Maybe adding sour cream and extra salsa to the meat mixture next time.

Came out delicious.  Used plain breadcrumbs.  Before baking put salsa on top and also cheese.  I used Sargento Taco cheese with seasonings but I’m sure any cheddar will do.

Delicious! I did make a few changes other reviewers suggested. Instead of breadcrumbs I used a cup of crushed tortilla chips but no more because it would've been too dry. I added an extra tablespoon of salsa and ranch and stirred in some cheese. I'll definitely make it again.

Liked this recipe. Using ground chicken I didn't have any ranch dressing, increased the salsa to 5 tbs and used chopped tortilla chips reduced to 1 cup, like others had earlier reported. Baked in a loaf tin for an hour to a temp of 165. It was good, I would do this meatloaf again

This "taco" meatloaf was easy and delicious.  Put in 7 oz can of Salsa Verde instead of 3 TB of salsa and put some of the shredded cheese in the middle as well.  Easy to serve with sour cream and cilantro. Try it!

I made "Taco Seasoning I" from this site, used egg beaters, cut bread crumbs down to 1 cup, as suggested by others.  After 45 minutes, I covered the top with 2 tbsp brown sugar mixed with 2 tblsp of barbecue sauce and returned it to the oven for 15 more minutes.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Oh yeah, and it's healthy, too!

It's not my favorite chicken meatloaf, but it is my least favorite chicken meatloaf. The taco seasoning is so strong, it doesn't taste like much else. We ate it, but I very much doubt I'd make it again

After reading the reviews I made this using a few ideas from a few reviews. I used a kilo of ground chicken, smashed a cup of Italian croutons and crushed a cup of taco shells, minced two small onions, put in 2 tbs. of minced garlic, the taco seasoning, 2 eggs and 5 tbs. of a medium chunky salsa.  I mixed together all except the dried crumbs and added those slowly till I reached the right consistency (all of them). I put 2/3 of the meat mix into a loaf pan, put the cheese on top and the last 1/3 meat mix on the top of all. Before putting it in the oven I lightly sprinkled on red pepper flakes. When I removed it from the oven at 45 minutes I poured over 1/2 of a Cambells tomato soup can mixed with 3 tbs. of salsa. Returned it to the oven for the last 15 mins.

What a treat!

I made this for my husband and 17 year old, they are both picky eaters, I added so much more; instead of bread crumbs I used 3/4 cup baked Doritos, I put them in the food processor and made crumbs, I added 1/2 c. of regular bread crumbs, I chopped baby red,yellow, and orange bell peppers, I used 1/4 c. purple onion, smoked paprika, and instead of salsa, I used a can of roasted diced peppers. Sorry for adding more but I love peppers and onions and this recipe was transformed into my families favorite. 
Seasoned rice with Mexican seasoning and fresh green beans made a delicious Sunday dinner.

I have never cooked with ground chicken before but got some that was quite inexpensive. It seemed the majority of the recipes were burgers and I did not want that. I'm glad I chose this one. My whole family enjoyed this! I used a little bit of pepper jack in the mix itself as I had some on hand. I also used 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of 1.5 and cooked it 15 minutes less. (Good thing I did as my husband said it seemed close to dry.) We topped it with salsa. Will likely make again.

Although I modified by using cracker crumbs (didn't have bread crumbs) it turned out great. I cut down some of the fat/calories by not topping with cheese and used my own homemade black bean salsa instead of store bought.  This dish was great dipped in Ranch dressing...and an alternate way of eating....was wrapping in a wheat tortilla...tasted similar to a taco!

I was surprised at how good this was.  I used 4 T. of picante sauce in place of the salsa, 3 T. nonfat plain yogurt in place of the Ranch-style dressing, and panko whole wheat bread crumbs.  I did not add the cheese either to cut back on the fat.  My husband raved about it!  We will definitely make this again!

When I first saw this recipe I thought "That sounds gross", but then I read the reviews and after reading the first few I decided to try it.  I LOVE this! I really thought it was going to taste horrible but it has a really good flavor to it and a great texture.  I am trying to cut calories, so I left off the sour cream and cheese, cutting this down to 141 calories and 5 grams of fat per serving (Yes I figured it out!) based on 8 servings.  Next I'm going to work on a substitution for the taco seasoning that will taste just as good but cuts down on the sodium.  What a GREAT addition to my new healthy lifestyle!  Thank you so much!

wow this was really great, okay so I may have been salsa and ranch dressing happy ( a added a bit too much) so I did have to add additional bread crumbs which gave me a grand total of 1 1/4 cups. My boyfriend, who originally turned up his nose at the idea of a mexican style meatloaf made with chicken to boot, ended up loving it. Will Definitely make again!

Big hit in our house. I am not a fan of store bought salsa so i substituted it out for 1 Tbsp of Chipolte tabasco sauce, used a fat free egg sustitute and my own salt free blend of taco seasonings. YUMMY!!!

We used ground beef and didn't have ranch dressing, which I'm sure contributed to how dry this was!!  It definitely cooked for way too long being in the oven for an hour.  A better name would be, "Taco Loaf" because that's exactly what it was.  We probably won't make this again...Sorry, Linda!

This was a huge bomb in my house, the consistency qas fine, but according to my husband "it smelled like Playdoh" and the taste was only slightly better.  The only changes I made were to reduce the breadcrumbs to 1 cup as suggested by other viewers, I purposely mixed the cheese in with the meatloaf and I used gluten free breadcrumbs that were made from potato and eggs. None of these changes should have broken the dish, which leads me to the conclusion it was already broken. May try again but with ground turkey or beef.

Nice, Nice NICE!! I didn't use taco seasoning - has a tendency to develop aftertastes when left over - so I used fresh chopped onions, oregano and sweet basil. I also added 1 Jamaican Scotch Bonnet Pepper (warning: proceed at your own risk!)and 6 tablespoons of salsa so it wouldn't be too dry when done.

This was very tasty the first night, though we didn't like the consistency so would maybe try it with chopped up chicken instead.  The ground chicken I used was very fine so that probably didn't help.  The flavour though was excellent but didn't like it as a left over.  Thought it might work well in manicotti.  I also added chopped up onion.

I loath meatloaf, after having to eat it all the time as a kid. But, I loved this recipe! I didn't have salsa, so I added fresh tomato, onion and a small can of green chilis. I also doubled the ranch, and left the bread crumbs as-is. My red meat loving husband devoured it, and said it is better than regular (beef) meatloaf.

This has quickly become a staple for dinner.  It's great because if you leave out the salsa or the ranch, it doesn't make much of a difference.  I cook it a little less time though, so it's a little more moist.  Awesome recipe!

I wanted to make something different for dinner and I found this recipe.  It was a nice change from ordinary meatloaf.  It was very tasty and the ingredients compliment each other very well.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it was super easy to make. I will definitely be making this again.

I mixed the cheese into the meat before cooking and then made it into meatballs rather than a loaf. I served it with enchilada sauce over rice. A very nice twist on dinner, thanks!

I didn't make it in loaf form...just used a pyrex casserole dish. Cut the bread crumb amount. Was pretty tasty.

Really, it was "the Best".  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used Italian panko breadcrumbs b/c I didn't have the regular ones on hand.  We made it a real tex-mex meal by serving it with sweet corn, chips and salsa.  A real kid-pleaser.

This was an excellent recipe! I did add some onions to the mix prior to baking for a little extra flavor, but it would have been just as good without them. Even serving it with a side of sour cream was a great change from the normal dipping sauces!

Pretty good for what it was: I don't like traditional meatloaf and this was definitely better. I did use turkey instead of chicken (I don't even know where to find ground chicken!) Again, very good for what it was, just not my kind of thing.

Really good flavours.  The leftovers tasted even better.  A great easy, weeknight meal.  I used ground turkey, and for breadcrumbs just foodprocessed two pieces of toast.  My 11 year old has declared it a keeper!

I was surprised at how much I liked this recipe! It's the first meatloaf I've ever made. It seems pretty flexible for substitutions. I used ground turkey instead of chicken (that's not really a huge change). I didn't have ranch, so I used sour cream w/ black pepper, and instead of taco mix, I used a bunch of cumin, and a couple shakes of chili powder and cayenne pepper. Fresh onions and garden peppers also work very well in this recipe. I was a bit skeptical, but I loved it, and I'm sending it to my mom. :)

This meatloaf was a little on the dry side, but overall very delicious.  I served it with salad & tortilla chips.  I also added extra cheese (I do with most everything).  I will definitely make it again!

I was skeptical of this recipe since I didn't think the photo looked very appitizing, but had some ground chicken to use up. I was pleasently surprized with how tasty it was. I didn't have the ranch dressing, but did chop up a half an onion to throw in. I also put more breading than what was called for because mine was not firm enough to put in a loaf. I served it with sour cream and salsa and my family ate it up. I will make this again.

I thought this was just okay... glad I read the reviews and cut down on the taco seasoning, even with half a pack it was still a little much.  Would probably stick with beef meatloaf in the future

Not great, not bad either. I had ground chix in the freezer and the ingredients so I decided to make this. Used 1/4 of seasoning package. Quick and easy.

This twist to meatloaf was sooo good. I have made this twice and the second time I added a little more ranch and salsa and it was more moist!  My kids LOVED it! It's a keeper

So, here's the deal: (1) Definitely cut back on the taco seasoning as recommended by the other reviewers.  I added 1/2 a packet and almost wish I had used a little less.  (2) I used ground turkey because I could not find ground chicken very easily.  The recipe turned out just fine.  I do think, however, that the taco seasoning was more pronounced in the turkey.  I also think the turkey stays moist longer.  (3) I found that my meatloaf flavored as it sat.  The first day I thought it was just "okay" but by day 3, it's wonderful!  

Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely flavorless, and almost unedible.

This made such a good meal, and a delicious alternative to standard meatloaf.  I'd recommend adding some extra ranch dressing, as the taste gets overwhelmed by the salsa and taco seasoning (although this could be because I used fat free dressing, which may have reduced the intensity of the flavor.)  As other reviewers suggested, adding chopped onions is a nice touch.  Overall, this is a very good meal to make when you don't want to spend a ton of time on preparation.  Just mix your ingredients together, stick it in the oven while you unwind after a long day of work, and you're done.

Was a little dry, served it with salsa instead of cheese to cut down on the fat a bit.  Tasted good, maybe next time I will decrease the amount of bread crumbs a little or add more ranch dressing to add more liquid.

I just made this and I recommend cutting back on the taco or fajita seasoning, mine tastes a little too strong of the mix. I really like the idea of chicken instead of beef and its definately a unique dish! The taste was good but when I added the sour cream it was wonderful! This is definately a recipe that I will play with over time

I modified this a bit - used 3/4 cup of tortilla crumbs instead of the bread, as I'm gluten intolerant. Also added 1/4 cup finely chopped onions. Used lite ranch dressing. This turned out excellent! My family says it tastes a lot like tamales with the tortilla crumbs - this will be added to our regular menu. Thanks!

A really nice alternative to the traditional meatloaf.
