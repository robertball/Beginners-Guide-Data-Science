I loved the idea of fresh ingredients for this one.  The end result was pretty good but something lacking in flavor. I'll play with it a little. I used about twice as much cheese as it called for.  Next time I think I would add a little more salt too.

I thought that this was the best green been casserole that I have ever had!!  I think the people that did the other reviews must have done something wrong with the recipe because every person that ate this at Thanksgiving dinner raved!!  The only thing i did different was use more cheese.

This is so much better than the original recipe.  I sauted the mushrooms with the onion and parsley and added 3 tablespoons of ranch dressing.  It was a big hit for Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving because I was tired of making the same ole Green Bean casserole using the cans of mushroom soup. I liked the idea of using FRESH ingredients. I used fresh green beans instead of "frozen" I boiled water, put plenty of salt and butter in the pot before adding the green beans and blanched them for about 10 min or so. the time depends on how you like your green beans. I dont like mines too soggy/mushy. I used just regular mushrooms that already came sliced/cleaned and sauteed them with the onions before adding the other ingredients. I omitted the lemon and accidently forgot to add the parsley although I did buy it. This was a hit. I was unsure of how this was going to turn out so I didnt make a lot. After seeing how fast it went, I wished I had. :) I'll be making this on a regular dinner night.

Ok so I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and as I was cooking for 5 boys, the only addition i decided to make to the recipe  was to add bacon.  As my boyfriend says, bacon makes everything better. being a vegetarian myself I wasn't able to taste this for myself, but I will say that this dish is literally the ONLY leftovers he has eaten....everyday since thanksgiving.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, something tells me I'll be making this a lot sooner than next thanksgiving!!!  also, i added the milk before stirring in the flour because the butter was not enough liquid to prevent the flour from clumping...this dish is GREAT!!!!

The taste was excellent.  I don't usually like green bean casserole but this was very good--a perfect balance between the beans and sauce.  It didn't get mushy at all.  The lemon zest was a very subtle flavor.  Next time I might try to saute the mushrooms before putting them in the casserole.

This was just fantastic.  First time I have ever cooked with lemon zest but I think that is the secret to this dish.  I saut√©ed the mushrooms with the onions as other suggested and I think it profited from that.  I did all the stove-top prep the night before then put in a casserole dish and refrigerated.  Finished them in the oven the next day for dinner, although had to cook about 2x as long because the dish was so cold.

Great flavor. I really enjoyed it however if you don't like crunch green beans then cook them longer than what she states. Otherwise extremely easy and tasty recipe.

Thank you for the great recipe!  It was just what I was looking for and it was a BIG hit on Thanksgiving.  I don't cook much, so it was lots of fun bringing something that everyone enjoyed so much.  I've been instructed to bring it every year now!  :)

My husband is allergic to the preservatives in most canned soups. This recipe is delicious. I used fresh french green beans (cut in half so it would serve more easily) and chanterelle mushrooms (that's what they had at costco) and it was amazing.

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. It is SO MUCH better than the traditional "dump the cans" dish. It is not difficult to make, but it did take me more like an hour to prepare it.

I will never make this again.  The sour cream was too overpowering (and we love sour cream!).  The lemon was a little much.

This was great! My fiance loves this stuff and gave it a thumbs up. It isn't as easy as the typical recipe, but it is very much worth it.  Would go well with many home-style meals.

I am looking for a "from scratch" recipe for Green Bean Casserole as this year I'm cooking for Gluten, Egg and Corn allergies. I don't have a problem replacing the frozen beans with fresh, however I cannot use the canned french fried onions.

Funny that the first line of the description by the author is "No cans here" yet the final ingredient is 1 can of french fried onions. I guess she meant no tin cans.

I recently moved in with my boyfriend and he only has a stove, not an oven. I made this completely on the stovetop and it came out perfect. It was only him and I so I cut the recipe in half and it was still a lot. I used 1 cup milk since I had to simmer it on the stove but it was delicious!

Perhaps I used too much lemon zest.....
the kids asked me to go back to the basic recipe.  If I make it again (not for Thanksgiving, though!) I will try more sauce, more cheese, sauting the mushrooms, and reducing the lemon zest.

I made this on both Thanksgiving and Christmas (different people).  Followed the advice of a few others and sauteed the mushrooms with the onions.  Use baby bellas instead of crimini (store didn't have them).  Added a little extra salt and a dash more pepper.  Used 2% cheese and reduced fat milk, and light sour cream to make it a tad healthier.  No one knew the difference (although I did add more cheese than the recipe called for). For convenience sake (and from lessons learned on Thanksgiving), I baked it for about 40 minutes and the string beans were still nice and firm.  This is a keeper!

I had never ever made green bean casserole before for Thanksgiving dinner because my fiancee doesn't like it. However, I decided to add it to my Thanksgiving menu last year and he LOVED it. So did the rest of my family. The entire dish disappeared!

I made this for potluck style dinner with friends.  Everyone loved it.  I sauteed mushrooms and made sure top was covered with french fried onions and cheese.  Love the recipe title, it's absolutely true.

I made it for Thansksgiving but not impreesive.  I am sure this is a kid-friendly recipe as it is mild tasting.  To us it was unimpressive and only slightly better than the soupy, can of mushroom cream soup, kind.  I steamed the french cut green beans in the microwave with some water.  I would highly recommend frying up the mushrooms with the onions to pull out some of the flavor.  The thickening with the flour and milk worked real well.  Perhaps use 3/4 sour cream and 1/4 yogurt or half-half...  Thank you for posting it!

I loved this casserole!  The sauce was super creamy and easy to make!  This was a big hit at Easter dinner, and it's nice knowing that something this tasty is also not loaded with salt and preservatives.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe! I followed the directions except I cooked the onions and mushrooms(used the kind suggested and they were worth the $$)together. Tossed them with the green beans then did the sauce after that seperately. I wish I had blanched the beans just a tad longer then suggested. The lemon zest is the key, resist the urge to add more as I did because it would have been too much had I given in to temptation!! Had other things in the oven so really didn't watch the cook time but it was more like 30-40 minutes!! I will make this again!! Thanx!

Substituted fresh green beans, skipped lemon zest and parsley, added a couple of cloves of garlic. Scrumptious!

Awesome! I was in such a hurry on turkey day that I forgot to steam the green beans and it still turned out awesome! Your know a recipe is good when you screw it up and it still tastes great!

Great addition to the Thanksgiving menu. So much better than the canned version. TEN times better! Might try making my own fried onions next time.

This was very good and very rich. If I made it again, I'd add more salt. This was good enough to make me forget the green beans were frozen, though!

I'm only leaving a review so that I can remember  how I made it when I make it again (and I will make it again). Canned green beans from our garden instead of frozen, cubed cream cheese instead of sour cream, Gruyere or Monterrey Jack instead of Cheddar, add a little garlic with the onions or sub with shallots, easy on the lemon zest.

So happy to find a recipe that does use canned soup!  It was very very good! I did make a couple changes: Used fresh green beans (2 lbs). Trimmed the ends, cooked in boiling salted water until tender crisp, about 12 minutes, the rest of the cooking happens in the oven, ((why use canned green beans if you are forgoing cans?) Second change, I increased the amount of milk.  The flour-milk ratio seems off, if was soooo thick! So I added maybe another half cup of milk until it looked more like a sauce.  I put in  the oven about 20-30minutes. OMGoodness! This is a delicious casserole !

The family raved about this recipe. This had a nice flavor, and I liked the mushroom and onion with the green beans. To make this gluten-free, I substituted 1 can (18 oz) Progresso¬Æ Vegetable Classics creamy mushroom soup with 2 Tb potato flour as a thickener. For the topping, I used gluten free onion flavor potato chips.

Usually my sister makes this type of dish for Thanksgiving (with the canned soups, which I don't like) so I offered to make it this year. Found this recipe and gave it a try and now I'm in charge of making the green bean casserole! Everyone loved it. I even made it again the following week and tweaked the recipe a little. It's ok if you don't have the lemon zest and the parsley - it's great without them. The only thing I would recommend is to saute the mushrooms with the onions so they get tender too.

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving for several years.  Since it is ‚Äòfrom scratch‚Äô, I use fresh green beans.  It satisfies those that are looking for the canned, traditional version, but is so much better for those of us who crave an alternative to canned soup.

Reviewer: I sauteed the mushrooms with the onion and parsley and added 3 tablespoons of ranch dressing. Blanche the beans just a tad longer then suggested. The lemon zest is the key, resist the urge to add more. Add 3 thick cut strips bacon, crumbled.

I have to say I‚Äôve never been a casserole person, I‚Äôd never eaten or made one..my sister asked if I would make the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving this year, I was a little hesitant but since she was hosting the dinner, I decided to give it a try...I‚Äôm so glad I did..it was a huge hit!! I was looking for a recipe that was quick and basically easy to make. This one caught my eye...I used 1 1/2 pounds of fresh green beans and Sargento shredded 6 cheese Italian instead of the cheddar. For the onions I used French‚Äôs crispy fried onions. I will definitely make this again!

I made this dish and it was absolutely delicious but it definitely needed a little more seasoning. I added more zest than it called for and also added a small amount of cayenne, a good couple shakes of garlic salt, and some paprika. Dont worry about going heavy on pepper‚Ä¶ it gets lost in the milk and sour cream. I sauteed the mushrooms in the sauce until softened and then poured mixture over the green beans. Good dish just needed a little more love. Turned out amazing!

Love this recipe, and that it's from scratch and not with the canned soups. I don't like mushrooms so I don't add them. I have made this recipe several times and the first time the lemon zest seemed too overpowering so I would either cut back or not add it at all. I agree that it lacks a little flavor, so i usually add some garlic and taste as I go and adjust seasonings as I see fit. But I am asked to make this every Thanksgiving!!!

The best I have ever had.  I didn't have any cans of cream of mushroom soup, so I used this recipe.  I didn't use as many mushrooms (and mine were canned)and didn't use any lemon zest.  It was incredibly rich and I could definitely taste the cheddar.  Thanks for sharing!  I will never go bake to the canned cream of mushroom soup version again!

Tried this as a test run pre-Thanksgiving this year.  Very good.  I will tweak a bit for the actual holiday, but so much better than canned soup recipes.

I used more cheese and french fried onion rings than called for and added a small amount of heavy cream to moisten the casserole. Took it to a large Thanksgiving dinner and it was all eaten. Excellent recipe. Will make it again.

Still a great favorite...we all had the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù recipe as children, thought we were great chefs when we made it in college...and now,  no cans! Marvelous.   and better than ever!!!

Do we like recipe with Swiss or Gruy√®re ?

I made this from fresh asparagus cut up into 1 inch pieces. Then sauted them with mushroom, garlic and onions. I didn't have any lemon so I used a few cloves of garlic instead. I also added 1/4 cup of crumbled bacon and used half sharp Vermont cheddar and half mild. I doubled the recipe and I came home with no leftovers at the church luncheon! Plus people kept telling me they loved it.

Everybody raved over this recipe, have already shared with others. I added some of the tips of bacon flavor, more cheese etc. I would recommend reading the comments.

I made this one year for Thanksgiving, and now it is a favorite for our family and I make it for all occasions!  I suggest adding finely chopped water chestnuts to give it a little additional texture, however.

Excellent recipe!  I did change a couple of things... just based on a lot of feedback from other reviews... Like:  I saut√©ed the mushrooms WITH the onions, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I also tasted the sour cream sauce and it did taste very 'sour creamy', so I added half of a packet of Lipton's onion soup mix. And, per the request of the menfolk, I added a bunch of bacon pieces to the top before I threw it in to bake.  I was a hit!

This wasn't delicious. It was meh. I made it exactly as written. Didn't change anything. I will stick with the recipe on the back of the cans of soup I guess.

I've not had success with frozen green beans in the past so I used organic, french cut beans with much success.  Also, in doubling the recipe, I did not double the mushrooms and fried onions.  Great lemony, light flavor.  Was definitely a hit at our Thanksgiving meal.

This was awesome. So much better that using canned soup. Made it just the way the recipe was but left out mushrooms because I don't like them.

This was exactly the green bean casserole I've always wanted!! Fresh and delicious and still enough like a classic casserole to please everyone at Thanksgiving. The only thing I added was two strips of chopped crispy bacon, because why not. It has been requested as a new Thanksgiving tradition! I don't have a picture because it was eaten too quickly.

It‚Äôs delicious and it‚Äôs beautiful but I found the end result just needed a brighter flavor. So I squeezed a few drops of the zested lemon over the casserole and voila! Amazing. Next time I will saut√© the mushrooms with the onions and maybe add some bacon.

This has been a hit for Thanksgiving since I stumbled across it many years ago.  I do adjust it and make it with fresh green beans, I increase the mushrooms and I add extra cheese.  The key to this recipe (IMO) is the fresh lemon!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was well liked over the traditional Green Bean Casserole from the back of the Fried Onion container. It's being added to my recipe collection! I did quarter the onions before thin slicing and did a smaller chop on the mushrooms as well. We didn't have crimini mushrooms and subbed in baby bella. Next time we'll small dice the mushrooms.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year with a few changes.  My grocery store only had white mushrooms so, I used them instead.  As others have suggested, I sauteed them with the onions.  I also added 2 large cloves of minced garlic with the onions and mushrooms.

I made the roux as instructed but the 1/2 c. of milk wasn't enough even with the cream cheese and sour cream.  I ended up adding another 1/2 c of milk and 1 T. of butter.   

I used 1/2 c of cheese, 3 crumbled strips of bacon to mix in with the roux, mushrooms/onions, and green beans.  I topped the  green beans with 2 crumbled up strips of bacon, fried onions, and 1/2 c of cheese.

My family devoured this and my hubby told me twice how good it was and he hates green beans.

I made this with fresh beans, and boiling them for 4 minutes or so and then throwing them in an ice bath. Dried them off before mixing everything in a caserole dish & finished cooking in the oven. I skipped the lemon, the cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Instead I used all purpose flour, butter, and heavy cream. You know what makes dish extra special? A sprinkle of fresh nutmeg! I also put in a clove of garlic when I saute the onion and mushrooms.

Definitely will make it again. We used fresh out of our garden beans! Only changes we made were fresh green beans, we fried the mushrooms with the onion and parsley as we aren't very fond of raw ones and we mixed the cheese for the topping with breadcrumbs.

This was delicious and a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  In the spirit of "scratch", I used fresh, trimmed green beans and cut them into 2-3" lengths.  It turned out beautifully, creamy and satisfying.  The lemon zest was a nice note.  I will definitely make this again!

Made 12 servings to fill a 9x12 pan. I like the idea behind using mostly fresh ingredients but this recipe was missing something. Think I'll stick with my go to green bean casserole recipe.

I love that this used fresh ingredients, but I found the overall effect rather bland. I would definitely make this again, but would try to add more flavor to the green beans.

I used fresh green beans and just cooked them before adding to the recipe. I also used frozen mushrooms to save time and it was great. I kind of laughed though that the title says absolutely no cans and then the ingredients says "can of fried onions". I know what the author meant, and now that they come in plastic tubs, that could be changed. :)

This was really good.   I sauteed the mushrooms and onions first and used the liquid from that for the roux.

Much better than I expected! I am not a fan of canned soup so this appealed to me. I love my giant bag of frozen fresh green beans and it worked perfectly. I did not use cheese, nor did I add bacon. The only small addition I made was Worcestershire, most traditional- this was the first left over that was gone. A keeper!

Very nice dish. I added much more cheese and fried onion. It had a much fresher taste than traditional casseroles.

I did not care for this. It just didnt turn out for me. I had to sub canned drained green beans as the store was out of frozen. The problem was the sauce. I did not care for the sour cream flavor.

I changed this by using black olive slices instead of mushrooms and adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of celery. Absolutely amazing....

I had fresh green beans I needed to use. That was my only deviation from the recipe. I like my green vegs crunchy, and this was perfect.

I liked this recipe, but it needs a little something. I added a tsp of thyme and upped black pepper to 1/2 tsp since many reviews said bland taste. I also sauteed the mushrooms with the onions. The sour cream taste is rich (used maybe 3/4 cup) and just not quite what I wanted for the sauce. I might try to modify using milk, broth and Worcestershire sauce, and reduce like when making a pot pie. Regardless, I liked this far better than the usual green bean casserole, and I would make it again.

I will be trying this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving.  I am so excited to find a recipe that doesn't use canned soup!  And the addition of mushrooms and onions just makes this sound so much more yummy than the old one.  As for those of you who said it lacked flavor, did you taste it before baking?  Any good cook knows you have to taste it first.  Maybe the addition of a little seasoning salt would zip this up a little.  I'm giving it 5 stars now but will be back after I make it.

Added some crumbled bacon and a bit of the rendered fat instead of one of the tbsp. of butter when making the roux.  LOVED this.

This was a great recipe but it was very rich,  and I added soy sauce, a few dashes of Worcester sauce and a lot of salt and pepper and it was still missing something.   Next time I make it I will use fresh green beans and cream of mushroom soup and a little sour cream.... and see what's up.

I avoid canned soups so I tried this recipe.  I ended up cutting the sour cream in half and there was still plenty.  Overall it was pretty bland other than the french fried onions.  I will not be making this again

LOVED this recipe!  Like others, it got my attention because it doesn't use anything from a can!  With the frozen beans you can control how well done you want them.  I prefer them nice and crisp which you definitely can't get from a can.  I used shiitake mushrooms which we had marinated ourselves.  The sour cream and lemon zest give the dish a nice bright tanginess and the crispy onions added a lot of flavor.  I did use the cheddar cheese but just a little as I didn't want it to be too heavy and gooey.   Great dish!

We really enjoyed this casserole. I didn't use frenched green beans, just whole ones. Also, I omitted the onions, and it still tasted great. I mixed everything together in my baking dish to save dishes. Will definitely be making this again!

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks and it has turn out perfect both times! I've tried it with fresh green beans and canned green beans and I love both! If I have time to prep it I will use the fresh green beans and if I am short on time I open up the canned green beans! By far my favorite green bean casserole! It will be a favorite for awhile! Thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe. I've made it a few times now and it is a favorite for the frequent family BBQs around here.  I add bacon because, well, what doesn't go well with more bacon right?! & I didn't have lemon but it was still super fabulous.  This is my Go To Green Bean Casserole. No more cans of SOUP!!!

The casserole was delicious but the instructions for bean cooking time was way off and resulted in crunchy beens in the casserole. Cook the beans for a good hour to allow for them to cream together with the rest of the casserole

Wow!!  I'm not a huge fan of green bean casserole, but my friends and family are. However, this was awesome!!  I really loved it. If green bean casserole had always tasted so good, I would have been a fan years ago.  Anyway, I had to make some changes to make this gluten free... I used gluten free flour and funions instead if french's fried onions.  And it was so yummy. Next time I will add some salt and garlic powder.  This is a must try recipe!!
