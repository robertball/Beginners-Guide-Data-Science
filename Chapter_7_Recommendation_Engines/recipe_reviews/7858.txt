Alright, I am an experienced cook, and this is a recipe for a custard, I actually made it as the custard and I adjusted it to make a lovely cheese cake.  The custard was divine - I baked it in bowls and garnished it with cinnamon. It made a lovely treat for a lazy evening, as it was quite easy.    The cheesecake, I did the following adjustments:  1. I doubled the recipe - 4 bars of cream cheese.  2. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup  3. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (I also used cane sugar) 4. I upped the vanilla by 1 teaspoon 5. I reduced the eggs to 2 6. I reduced the corn starch to 3 tablespoons 7.  I added a little orange zest and about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice (after I whipped everything together, while still mixing, but before the eggs).    I made a standard graham cracker crust, baked it in a spring form pan, and it was lovely.

This recipe deserves four stars for being so easy and also tasty. For a less custardy texture, maybe use only 2 eggs and beat for only 2 minutes. Also, you want to cover the cheese cake to keep it from browning.

i tried the recipe and was at first alarmed to see that the mixture is too runny, but the texture turned out okay. it's a bit sweet, so i reduced to less than a cup of sugar, and less than a cup of milk, and also i added another tablespoon of cornstarch.i also used some lemon juice instead of vanilla.on the whole, it's nice and very easy to make.

I made this on a whim for my 6 yr old that could not live another minute without cheese cake.  I whipped it together in no time flat and unlike some of the other reviews, it did resemble custard cheese cake and I LOVED IT!!!!  So did the entire family.  What a great recipe.  I will be using this one again!

A friend of my mother's gave her this recipe over 30 years ago and it always turns out great. Only difference is Mrs. G's recipe uses 3 Tbs of cornstarch and the oven temp is 325 F

Couldn't be easier.   I used only 1/2 cup of (skim) milk and "1/3 less fat" cream cheese.  Did not sprinkle with cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very good and easy, but definitely a custard type cheese cake.  I like that it doesn't need a crust.  Next time I will take it out of the oven after baking, instead of leaving it in the oven for an additional hour to cool. I think it got too done.
