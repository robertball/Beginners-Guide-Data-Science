My chocolate chip cookies are always crispy, and I always wanted to be able to make good, soft, chewy cookies... this recipe worked for me!  It made good sized, delicious, soft and chewy cookies.  I did need to cook them for a few minutes more than the recipe called for, however.

these cookies were great! i added baking powder instead of baking soda so they would come out puffier. they were perfect milk dipping cookies, they absorbed the milk. ***** five stars *****

WOW are these the BEST !!!
You can actually make the dough into a tube (like the Pilsbury cookie dough) wrap it in wax paper and freeze them to use later. You can cut off what you want frozen to cook a couple of cookies at a time. Or you can put them in a container and freeze them and just scoop out what you want.
These cookies do remain MOIST if covered. 
THANK YOU so very much for the BEST Chocolate cookie recipe I have ever had. PS.... you can substitute nuts, or raisins, etc. instead of the chocolate chips.
Enjoy everyone....
Laurie

Generally when I bake I give all or most of it away...but not this time. This is the perfect example of why I've seldom strayed from what I've learned works best.   The cookies were greasy and flat. (And I didn't even grease the cookie sheets) They're flat tasting as well, probably because there's neither enough vanilla nor chocolate chips.  Their unappealing looks are the first indicator they're not good since they're flat and rather anemic looking, and the mouth feel is unpleasant, not "soft" but greasy and mushy.  Finally, the recipe is just poorly written. I've never heard, for example, of a cookie dough being "whipped."

Cookies came out yummy :)

So I used that quantity changer because I thought it really was for "12." I didn't only want a dozen cookies that I could maybe finish in one day with my family so I upped it to 18. I also used the suggestions people had - 1 tablespoon of vanilla and substitute a bit of baking powder for the baking soda. Mine definitely didn't come out flat like everyone elses. Since it didn't come out flat, it didn't expand to be gigantic. 

I made about 40-48 cookies (I like smaller cookies 3"). I used what the ingredients said if you change the quantity to 18. The things I changed were: 1. 1 tablespoon + a bit more of vanilla extract (the taste came out great), 2. 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder (this caused them to come out very fluffy.. I suggest using maybe 1 1/4 baking soda, 1/4 baking powder so they're not flat), and 3. I used 1 cup and 4.5 tablespoons of butter. 

all in all, the cookies tasted great. My automatic scaling thing and maybe too much baking powder made them too fluffy. Good easy recipe!

The recipe is pretty good, however not the greatest.  It was a little cakey to me and the kids I made them for weren't too happy because they weren't very sweet like most cookies are.

This is an excellent cookie recipe.  I've been looking for something that is not cake-like but still turns out soft in the centre.  This is definitely the one! I have 3 recommendations: 1. I recommend adding about half a cup chopped pecans Yum! 2.Use about a heaping teaspoon of dough per cookie rather than a tablespoon, 3. Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes.

I made these for Christmas.  The recipie was SUPER easy and the cookies came out nice.  I was hoping for a fluffier cookie. The edges of these do get crispy adn the middle does stay softer.  So they are true to the description.  I did substitute the baking powder instead of what it called for hoping for extra fluffiness.  If you want a cookie that has crispness and softness this is the cookie for you.  I will be on the lookout for a fluffier one just due to personal preferences.

This is a great soft cookie recipe. Not cake like at all. Used butter flavored shortening instead of the butter and it worked great. Did add 6tsps because of the substitution. Added m&m's instead of chocolate chips. Overall the best cookie recipe I have found!!!

I made these this afternoon and are a definite winner!  The hubby keeps coming down for more and the teens took about 50%... leaving just enough for me and the mailman.  Perfect recipe.  No changes.

For those who prefer a more moist and softer chocolate chip cookie.  Not quite enough chocolate for me though, I would suggest increasing the amount of chips to 1 1/2 cups. Another suggestion I would make is to cut the hard butter into small chunks to make it easier to mix with the other ingredients. Watch carefully so you do not overbake.

This cookies have a great flavor, I had a hard time mixing the chilled butter with the other ingredients. Not sure if the butter should actually be soften. I added an extra cup of chocolate chips.I made it into 1 inch balls since the dough was too stiff to drop from spoon. My husband loved the flavor. I will probably make again but I will experiment with the butter and perhaps adding nuts next time.

Great cookie!  I admit I picked it based solely on the name.  Followed the recipe except for accidentily adding too much vanilla. I also needed to bake them for around 12 minutes.  Then I had to let them cool for quite awhile before even attempting to eat; even so the cookies were soft and chewy.

I think this is the best choco chip recipe I have made from this site. I agree with some other reviewers that this recipe does produce a cookie very similar to refrigerated cookie dough bought in the store. Will be making again and again!!!!!

I always like Oatmeal Choco-chip cookies, but my husband doesn't like the oatmeal. So I looked for the perfect cookie recipe for him. Now we're both in love with this recipe. The 2nd time I made a batch though, I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I shared the cookies with a couple of friends and everyone said the same thing - the cinnamon gives the recipe another little burst of flavor,

These cookies come out huge.  They are so good it's hard not to eat them as soon as they come out of the oven.  The whole house smells like a bakery.  My husband took these to work and one guy at practically thi whole bunch.

This is my "go to" recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Everybody asks me to make them and the grandkids want to know if PopPop made any cookies as soon as they come in the front door.  I have tried others but for my taste this is the one "baby".  Thanks for sharing Mel.

I had to double the recipe to make a 24 count but suggest adding a 1/2 cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of flour. Also my total bake time was 14 minutes total.

Pretty basic chocolate chip cookie recipe. I doubled the amount of chips, that was the only change I made. My cookies took eleven minutes to bake. This recipe made a ton, but my husband'll be happy. He likes a simple chocolate chip cookie without frills. This is exactly that.

My family says these were just ok.  Good texture, very soft & easy to make.  Flavor just a little bland.

WOW!!! These are great! The perfect combination of ingredients. I used a cup and a half of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (all I had on hand) and added a cup of chopped pecans! This one is a keeper!

Absolutely grand!  We purchased leftover Valentine chocolate (the ones made with real cocoa) and smashed them into chunks.  The kids loved doing this! We substituted this for the chocolate chips.  We also substituted baking powder for the baking soda.

OMG! I love this recipe and have been making it for years. Great cookie to sell at a lemonade stand along with lemonade. I always cream to butter and sugars before adding eggs and vannila, which makes it much easier. I once tripled the recipe and made seventy cookies. If you want to make the cookies larger, you can just make a larger ball of dough. Mix the dry ingredients before adding them to the rest, as you do not want pockets of baking soda or salt. Make this as often as possibe. You won't be sorry.

Fantastic! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter-flavored Crisco. I also used Halloween M&Ms in place of the chocolate chips (just because I was making them for a Halloween party), but I'm sure any kind of chip would be perfect with this recipe. Stayed just puffy enough out of the oven to look (and taste) great! YUM!

I just finished making this cookie recipe.  I agree with another review saying it is missing something.  Its not bad, but  its not what I was expecting. I took half and did it with the baking soda, and the other half I did the baking powder. There really wasnt much difference. I am also really glad I read the reviews for how many cookies it made, I almost doubled it. I made at least 3 dozen cookies. Again, it wasnt bad, just something tastes like it was missing. And maybe I need the cookies to sit a little while.

This recipe was bland. After reading the reviews, I was expecting a much more tasty cookie. But this is just a basic chocolate chip cookie. There's no "WOW factor." I've found much better on this site. And unfortunately, I won't be making this one again.

I thought that all chocolate chip cookies were the same before I made this recipe, but I was wrong.  These are the absolute best and I will never use another recipe!!!!  My cookies were just crispy enough on the outside and so soft on the inside that they melted in my mouth.  I got similar responses from my friends and now they all request cookie for birthday presents.  To those who said the cookies were too flat, try not over stirring and be sure to put the dough in the fridge for a few hours before baking.  I also added a bit more vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, and that might help anyone who feels the recipe is missing something.

THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES YOU'LL EVER MAKE. 

I had to put that in caps because I'm SO serious. 

I didn't have enough butter so I used half butter flavored crisco and half butter. DELICIOUS. 

***NOTE: I thought 12 servings meant a dozen cookies. Aparently not, I doubled the recipe and got 70. YES, 70. I used one of those medium pampered chef cookie scoops so they were all measured evenly.

Very nice cookies. not at all what i was looking for, but they turned out wonderfull. I bet they'd just taste like subways with white chocolate chips and macademia nuts. They do come out very flat, but the taste is great. Made one batch, it was gone b4 it was cooled down.

This made a very good cookie. I still prefer tollhouse better though, because the dough just seemed like it needed something as far as flavor. Maybe it's because I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown? These did spread a lot on the baking sheet and came out very flat, but were soft, chewy, had a wonderful texture, and overall a really good recipe. I used margarine instead of butter. I had to cook a little longer 12-13 min. til they were golden and light brown. I did use an airbake sheet, that does make a difference in cooking times, it takes a little longer than my wilton sheet. I got about 4 dozen good sized cookies from this. A must try cookie!

Great cookie! Its what I have been looking for! Have made a couple of changes though. I melted the butter very slowly and on a low setting in the microwave. I also added 1 TBSP istead of 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Yummy!

Quick, Easy Recipe.  Few ingredients compared to others.  Plain Jane chocolate chip cookies.  Mine turned out thin- but perfect texture, not too crispy, not to cakey.

( novice baker) I used brown sugar with molasses and reduced the amount a little, as in I didn’t pack 3/4 cup of sugar. I wasn’t sure about chilled butter and how to measure a cup but I let butter soften at room temperature and estimated roughly by putting it in a measuring cup, so I didn’t even fill the entire cup. And I used a local brand of cooking chocolate and cut into chunks because it’s not easy to find chocolate chips where I live.  They tasted yummy, the sweetness was just right. My first batch was finished within 2 days. My second batch browned slightly more ( distracted baker not watching the oven)  yet they tasted so nice and chewy that the family Keeps munching on them every time they pass by the biscuit tin!  Thank you for sharing such a simple n easy recipe.

A little greasy and not the soft, chewy cookie I expected. The cookies flattened even when I kept the dough chilled. I added one more cup of chocolate chips and I think that helped the flavor.

made them for my diabetic husband. used sugar free pudding mix, only had 1 oz package, splenda instead of white sugar and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe. Wish there was a substitute for the brown sugar, but I did use about half of the amount.

I have to admit to not quite understanding how to make chilled butter work, and so mine was room temp. My cookies didn't flatten at all, and so the edges were as brown as advised, but the middles just barely not raw. Nothing wrong with the taste though.

As stated by my 17 year old daughter and her friends, these are "the best ever!!" Made them two days in a row for her study group.

These cookies turned out great. We had to put them into the oven a few extra minutes. They were really soft and not crispy at all. We will be making these cookies again!!

I absolutely love this recipe! My cookies always come out cake-like and I have spent years trying to make a cookie with a crispy outside and chewy middle and that's exactly what I was able to do with these cookies. To make the cookies chewier I followed a tip I saw online and I changed the recipe only slightly by using an extra 1/4 cup of both brown sugar and flour. I had to bake a few minutes longer than called for, but I must say they turned out perfect and exactly how I wanted them. Between my family and I, they were all gone by morning. Next time I'll switch to gluten free flour so my mom can enjoy them too. Definitely going to keep this in my recipe box!

Very good recipe.  Slightly crispy edges and chewy centers(as long as you don't overcook them).  Family loved them.  Made about 3 doz. using recipe shown.

I wouldn't say that these are the "best", but they are pretty darn tasty. I scoured this website looking for a decent C.C.C recipe, and I wasn't disappointed with this one! The cookies came out light and fluffy, and had great flavor. I don't know if this comes from the butter being chilled when you make the dough and then it melts more into the cookie?! But they were definitely tasty, and I would make them again! Not floury tasting at all, and I like the fact that the butter didn't have to be at room temperature, makes it easy to be spontaneous when craving chocolate chip cookies! I also used parchment paper sprayed really lightly once with cooking spray. The cookies came off easily and were perfectly golden brown. Even the next day they were still crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Would make again for sure.

I took a batch of these with me to my theatre youth group and I didn't have any leftovers. I added more chocolate and  mint chips.  I also added an extra tsp of vanilla. They were thinner, which made them chewy,,,,yummy!

This is the recipe I've been searching for!  The cookies are perfectly crispy around the edges but chewy in the middle.  They are nice and thin, not cakelike--perfect!  I might add a tad more salt, but this recipe is now my ONLY recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have a full cup of butter so i used a half cup of margarine and a half cup of sour cream. i also didn't have the full amount of chips so i used what i had and then eye balled some coconut, raisins and walnuts. as well iused whole wheat flour. they came out great. fluffy almost like cake batter but really nice despite all my subs of ingredients.

YUM! these cookies were amazing... i baked them just a few hours ago and they are almost done already! my dad didn't believe that i baked them because they were so incredibly perfect. i used half of the white sugar in an attempt to reduce the calories. they still tasted great.

If you like flat, chewy cookies, these are for you. I mean, they are good, but I like a different texture. Yes, I used real unsalted butter. The dough is DEE-licious!!!

I have been on the hunt for chewy/soft chocolate chip cookies for a while.  I was very pleased with the result, it was also very simple. Folks from Connecticut: I would compare these to Stew Leonards mimi chocolate chip cookies.

Great, chunky cookies. But did I really understand it right with the tablespoon? The cookies were really huge??? Has anybody experience with teaspoon sized portions of dough?

If you want soft and chewy cookies that have a perfect little crunch when you bite into them these are the cookies for you. This recipe also is so easy. My friends and I love these cookies.

I've tried many, many chocolate chip recipes and this is the absolute BEST I've ever made.  They're soft, yet crisp enough.  Very delicious.
I'm sharing this recipe with all my family and friends.

Thanks, Mel!  :)
