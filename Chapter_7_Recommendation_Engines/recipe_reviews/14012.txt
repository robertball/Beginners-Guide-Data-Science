This is good, but needs some work.  It was very easy, pretty, smelled wonderful and cooked up beautifully.  However, the baking mix made the whole thing taste thick and pancaky, and the whole thing definitely needed some spices.  I think I'll try all these ingredients again and just make it a quiche (get rid of baking powder and use 3 eggs + 1 1/2 cups of cream)

I made this just as written except that I left out the corn and added a half cup of the other vegetables in the corn's place.  It tastes great and I will make it again.

This recipe absolutely needs some salt, pepper and additional seasoning. My tinkerings included  sauteing the onion w/ garlic and bell pepper, using grated squash and zucchini (both of which I drained, salted, in a colander) and adding salt, pepper, paprika and fresh basil to the top b4 baking it. It smelled heavenly, and did taste pretty good (w/ the addition of a healthy splash of hot sauce), but next time around, I'll go much heavier on the seasonings.

This on is a keeper.  I varied it by using a drained can of mild Rotel tomatos and chili instead of the chopped tomato.  A good potluck dish.

This was fantastic! I had a lot of zucchini to use so I doubled the recipe and used a larger glass pie dish to bake it in. Thanks -- this will be a new favorite!

Great taste & easy!  Wish the cook time was shorter.
I have added fresh Basil, mushrooms & Greek Olives at different times.  I use Soy Cheese & low fat Baking Mix.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It's great as is, and easy to riff.  I once served it at a New Year's Eve party, and people ignored the roast beef tenderloin with port sauce to eat the Zucchini Pie!

This started to brown way before it was done cooking, so I turned down the temp, and it ended up soggy in the middle- almost inedible. Quite a disappointment! Maybe it is just supposed to get really dark, so just down turn the temperature down!

Loved it! Tweaked a little. Added an egg white, some Parmesan, some garlic, and some black pepper.  Kids asked me to make it again.  Tasted like really good corn bread.  Great way to use farm veggies!

Great idea. 2 of us ate this up fast, so I might suggest making a larger batch especially for 3+ people. Yummy recipe though!

This recipe was pretty good, but it was a little on the bland side. It could use some salt and maybe another spice or two.

So tasty and so easy to prepare.  For more of a mexican flare add some black beans or canned chili peppers and top with sour cream.

Delicious! The only things I did differently were, 1) I used a can of diced Italian recipe tomatoes (drained well) in place of a fresh tomato; and 2) I omitted the corn and the onion. Without a doubt I will make this one again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is a great way to use up squash.  I stewed my squash...I used zucchini..(sliced in 1/2" slices) til just tender.  Like any other time I cook, I seasoned to taste.  I also added 4-5 finely diced jalapenos.  I used thyme as an addition for taste.  It was very good and I will make again!

This recipe was great! I actually used a pie crust, but I think it would be great without one. I also did not have tomatoes unfortunately, because it would be even better with them. This was so easy to make and relatively healthy so I know I'll make it again. It also makes great leftovers :) thanks!

This was very good! I added a green pepper chopped up and also some chopped up mushrooms because I happened to have them around! I think you could add other veggies to it as well, depending on what you have handy. Definitely a keeper!

I had some zucchini to use up so made this but added eggplant which I roasted ahead of adding it to the other ingredients.  I also sautéed the onion before adding it to the pie.  Also used some sun-dried tomatoes and some leftover ham, which I cubed.  We liked it and I will probably make again but I think it might need a little more spicing up for our tastes.  This is a good recipe for using up leftover veggies.

This was delicious!  Only change I made was to use frozen organic corn instead of fresh and salt and pepper.  Very tasty and easy! Low in calories too. Thanks Kim!

After some changes - this came out amazing!  The original recipe may be fine, but I was looking to add a little bang to it.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a rectangle casserole dish.  I let it bake at 400 degrees for 1 hour.  I also added salt, pepper, fresh parsley and I sprinkled fresh basil on the top.  I used half cheddar and half pepper jack.  I also sauteed the onions with three cloves of garlic and a couple teaspoons of EVOO.  I also drained the zucchini prior to mixing in with the other ingredients.  Oh, and I used corn cut straight from the cob and seasoned with a little chipotle powder.
