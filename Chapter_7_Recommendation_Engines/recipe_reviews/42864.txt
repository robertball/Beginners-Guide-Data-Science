I found this recipe delicious but I did tweak quite a bit so I can't give the full five stars. Instead of water, I used vegetable broth and what a flavorful difference. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white, and garlic infused olive oil, and again, a great flavor boost. I also used a red onion. It tasted fabulous! I think this recipe lends itself to many different variations and tastes - it's very versatile.

This is a very simple and healthy recipe. The only problem I found was that it is a little bland, so I added red peppers and substituted balsamic vinegar for white. 

I love the mixture of beans, veggies and couscous though! an awesome combination of textures.

Nice simple recipe. Glad I read the other reviews which inspired me to make some changes of my own. Used lime, balsamic and fresh herbs and made double the amount of  dressing. Also added  celery, bell pepper and blanched asparagus. Best prepared the day before to enhance the flavours.

Cheers!

Wonderfully easy and tasty! I peppered this nicely, and didn't add any extra salt. Next time I'll try lemon juice instead of vinegar for more flavour. Thanks for this one!

This was pretty tasty but I think it should be 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup white vinegar instead of teaspoon.  Otherwise it's way too dry and has no flavor to speak of.  A little fresh mint might be nice in this also.

This was a nice and simple recipe.  I added a bit more olive oil and vinegar for more of a punch.  I also added sliced red onions to bulk up the veggies.

I will definitely make this again.

Surprisingly good!  This was my first time using couscous and this recipe fit my taste buds! I did change a few things - I used lemon juice instead of vinegar (as others suggested), diced canned tomatoes (with juice) and I added some tarragon to the dressing.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Wonderful recipe, I did alter it to what I had in my pantry.  I used fresh baby spinach, petite diced tomatoes, fresh pesto (I made it the night before), and balsamic vinegar.  I must say it taste delish! This is the first time I make couscous and I will definately try it again! Enjoy!

While the recipe was OK and probably a good picnic food, there just wasn't enough flavor for our liking.  I made it 2 times, the first time with chicken broth, the second without.  Definately use the chicken broth.

This dish is a great basic dish.  The key is using the spices to taste as it is bland.  As others suggested, I did add balsamic vinegar instead of white, and I added a little more because I liked the flavor.  Just a note:  If it is easier, just use a box a couscous and cook according to package directions.  There are many flavors and you can find it in the rice aisle.  Then just use a portion of it for this dish or increase the ingredients accordingly.

This was bland. I think balsamic vinegar would add some needed flavor to this dish. However, I will not be wasting such good ingredients again.

This is fantastic when served with something much more flavorful.  I've made it twice:  once as written and once with a few changes to add some flavor since I wanted it for lunch. To add some flavor the second time around I flavored the water I cooked the couscous in with 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. black pepper, and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper.  I also added some onions cooked up in olive oil.  Those changes made this a couscous dish that could stand on its own for those days when you don't have anything else to serve it with.

This was my very first couscous experience and now I am addicted! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very good. The tomatoes and cucumbers make it a refreshing meal. I did double up on the olive oil only because I love the flavor of it.

Not a fan of couscous but really enjoyed this recipe. I used Balsamic vinegar like others suggested and added fresh cilantro.

This is a good base of couscous, eat it as is or add whatever you would like!  I like to toss in fresh dill, crumbled feta, and a tablespoon of lemon juice to put a Mediterranean 'spin' on it...delicious!

I thought this was a little dry and lacked flavor.  I'm not sure if that was because I chilled it to serve as a cold salad with BBQ. The only change I made was to use Israeli couscous which is bigger & puffier .  It's usually more most too.  I also added some lemon juice at the table to add a little zip.  I'm not sure what it needed-maybe more oil or even some salad dressing.  I'd like to make it again to bring to a potluck but I'd definitely want it more moist.  Tip: Make it in a sealable container before refrigerating. When you are ready to serve, tightly cover the top of the bowl and SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE to break up all the couscous.  Let your kids do it!

Pretty good, I used quinoa instead of couscous because I realized as I began that I had no couscous. I did think it was bland, so I added more vinegar. I used balsamic, which turned it a nasty color but tasted nice. I'll make this again.

This was good, but it didn't exactly blow me away...  I doubled the recipe, but made some changes. I used low sodium fat free chicken broth and I'm really picky about uncooked veggies being in cooked things- so I only added the garbonzos. I used sun dried tomatoes in oil with balsamic vinegar for the dressing.  I sprinkled dried onion and garlic powder over it all.  I will say that the amounts listed for the oil and vinegar are definitely not enough, simply due to the fact that couscous is a very absorbent grain!  I'm not sure how much I actually used, but it was much more than called for.  It turned out good and is definitely a great base recipe for experimenting!  Thanks!

I'm being a bit forgiving on the rating because I think this has potential and it made a quick and easy lunch. This was a tad boring and I used vegetable broth and tomato flavored balsamic vinegar, much more than the recipe called for and yet I still couldn't taste it. I used whole wheat cous cous, cherry tomatoes (around 1/2 cup or so, cut in half), but didn't have a cucumber. I think this would be better with more balsamic and olive oil, perhaps with some parmesan sprinkled on top.

Very good. I use flavored couscous and forgo any spices. I also use balsamic vinegar instead of white.

I put this together as written with the exception of leaving out the cucumber. It is a very 'quiet' dish, which is good if you are serving a main dish with a lot of flavor going on. If I did this again, I would sautee some fresh onion and garlic in the pan before adding the couscous. As it was, after taste testing, I added in black olives and some crumbled feta cheese. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jennifer.

This is a tasty, simple, and quick dish to make.  Use it either as a side or a main course.  It is open to variation, but I liked the light flavor.  I used half a packet of dry onion soup to make the couscous.  I also added half a green pepper.  I completely left out the oil and vinegar - who needs it?!  Save the calories and have dessert.

I made this at work and quadrupled the recipe for the large group I had.  I cooked the couscous in veggie stock as others mentioned.  I made the dressing using 3/4 cup each of olive oil, white vinegar, and lemon juice.  I added some dried basil to it as well.  It was awesome!  I served it cold and the group loved it.  I think it would have been very very dry had I only used the 1 teaspoon of olive oil and white vinegar called for in the quadrupled recipe.

Boring and bland. I love chickpeas and I love couscous, but this was not a great combination.

I cooked the couscous in chicken stock instead of water to give it more flavour. This was a delicious simple side dish :)

Oh my gosh. This stuff is yum. Of course the one time we don't have garbanzos in the house is when I decide to make this. So I substituted a can of peas, and it's amazing. I also added some pimientos, and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Next time I'll use garbanzos and fresh 'maters, but I'm definitely keeping the peas in there. Very delicious recipe. Thanks!

I've made a version of this for a few years but always felt it was missing something. I love this recipe and intend to replace my old and rather boring one with this. Thank you for sharing!

I changed a few things and next time I will also. I used spinach couscous and also added garlic and onion in the olive oil stated in the recipe. I also used a mix of salad vinegar and ff italian dressing. Next time, I won't use the chickpeas but add more tomato and cucumber. I'll also add more garlic and onion (i only used tiny amounts this time) and it is so much better cold! So good cold. Will also try it with original couscous rather than spinach to see if that adds/changes the flavors offered. Good base recipe to build on to your own liking.

This was a pretty good recipe! Very simple to make and tasted excellent. I used the couscous flavored with pine nuts and it added a nice crunch. Overall, a creative spin on ordinary couscous.

Yhis recipe was simple and delicious. I took the advice of another reviwer and added garlic and herbs as well as a little lemon juice. I also used vegetable broth for some of the water when cooking the couscous. Overall this was easy and tasted great!

I added some extra spices and ingredients. I saw some people said they used balsamic instead so i used that. I added spinach and some extra veggies to make it more filling. I added red pepper because i like spicy food :)

1/4 of a teaspoon of both olive oil and vinegar just can't be right. I added an eighth of a cup and that worked pretty well. I also added some fresh herbs and olives (suggestions from other cooks).
If I made it again, I'd probably use lemon juice in place of vinegar too.
However, all in all it was a good base recipe and the couscous turned 
out very well.

I loved this but can only justify 4 stars because my family didn't adore it. It's great for a busy night though - it took me only 16 minutes from start to finish. And only cost about $3 for 4 servings plus leftovers!

I made this recipe for dinner guests this Saturday to rave reviews.  In fact, far too much of the dinner conversation revolved around the couscous.  They loved the cukes.  I will say that I felt like I needed to add a lot more oil and vinegar, salt, pepper and garlic powder to the recipe.  I also ended up adding quite a bit of cumin just for some punch.  I don't want to say it is bland...maybe subtle.  As one other poster said, it's perfect served with something more savory so your tastebuds get a break.

Since reading this recipe, I have made it over four times - and it´s only been a week! Perfect quick, healthy lunch for me and my guy. However I added much more olive oil and some lemon, too. Tuna can be added in a pinch, too.

Very quick and easy recipe to make. I made a few changes and it was a hit, I omitted the cucumber and used spinach beef broth and balsamic vinegar. This added just a little bit more flavour. Will definately make this again.

My husband and I love couscous and this recipe puts a great twist on a basic dish.  I did not include tomatos; just cucumber, chickpeas, chicken stock and balsamic.  We used 1/4 cup of balsamic which gave it a nice kick.  I wouldn't suggest using that much if you are not a balsamic fan.  I hope everyone enjoys this as much as we did!

A very yummy recipe! And fairly flexible, too. I added bell peppers and used balsamic vinegar. I doubled both the oil and the vinegar... everything turned out great! Make sure to use the full two tomatoes -- they taste amazing in this salad. Thanks for the recipe!!

I tried this exactly as the recipes says, but I found it very bland.  I ended up adding some beef stock (didn't have chicken) out of desperation but that didn't do much.  Next time I'll try stock in the beginning.

Nice and simple. I omitted the olive oil, and added more spices: coriander, Italian mix, and cumin. I added a slight amount of salt and pepper. I served it on a bed of baby Romain. (Next time I will add another Roma tomato).

Original recipe looked bland. I kicked up to a Cajun level by adding - after sauteeing - half a bell pepper chopped fine, one whole onion chopped fine with Creole seasoning 1/2 teaspoon.

I made this for a PTO luncheon at our school. I had mixed reviews about it though. I did alter it as sujested the extra oil was a must. I used the seasoned couscous and used chix. broth. I added basil, cilantro, parmesano and minced garlic. As for the vinegar I had white on hand but not quite anough so I topped my measurment off with cider vinegar,so I'm wondering if that was it. My family seemed to like the left overs. It was easy enough that I do plan to try it again with the basalmic w/maybe a bite of sugar to cut the taste. Thanks, it was great for a last minute dish.

Easy, healthy and flavorful.  I have a hard time getting my children to eat vegetables.  My only mistake was I made this to be a vegetarian entree and the amount was more suited to a side dish.

I love the way the creamy chick peas and crunchy cucumbers came together with this simple salad. It was very fresh. It took no time to prepare. I used parmesan flavored couscous and left out the garlic powder.

I enjoyed this. It was a bit heavier then I would have liked, but it was  nice for a change instead of just a plain chickpea salad. I will make this again.

I thought this was very good - simple, easy to make, healthy...I don't like cucumbers, so I skipped them. Next time I will add something green or yellow (peppers?), it needed that visually. We will definitely make it again.

This was very easy and fairly tasty.  I scaled it down for 1 serving, and the oil and vinegar was so scant, I could have omitted it and not missed anything.  Good for a quick summer meal.
