Oh. My. Gosh! This is my new favorite side dish. As another reviewer suggested, I sauteed some fresh chopped garlic in the butter and brown sugar before adding the asparagus (and sliced portabellas, yummy!). Just needed a touch of salt when it was done, and the flavors all complemented each other PERFECTLY. The sauce cooked into a beautiful glaze to top my breaded chicken. I'm making this again tomorrow night!

This is a delicious and easy way to prepare asparagus.  The broth, butter and brown sugar make a really nice glaze for the asparagus.  I liked that in less than 15 minutes you can have a fresh, hot vegetable on the table.  This recipe is a keeper.

Tasty and light - didn't taste like candy as others suggested.  Next time I will add in some of the extras others discussed like soy, lemon, or garlic.

This is my new way to fix asparagus!  The only thing I did add was a little fresh squeezed lemon juice @ the very end.  Next time I will put just a tad bit of garlic in as well.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

GREAT! I was afraid this was going to be be too sweet, as it turns out it was just lightly flavored so it tasted great (I like fresh asparagus).

Loved the concept of this recipe.  I added a cap-ful of lemon juice and 2 splashes of soy sauce to round out the flavors.  This was a hit at Easter dinner!

This is the only way my family eats asparagus now!  My picky 9 year old absolutely loves asparagus now because of this recipe!  I don't cook the asparagus as long, maybe 5 minutes, and it turns out perfect.  So yummy!

I have made these twice--once based as written and the second time with my changes. 

First--as written they are still delicious but an issue I had was the cooking times were WAY too long for the asparagus. I think I cooked mine a total of 4 minutes. 
Next, I don't think you need SO much chicken broth. It takes forever to reduce and it really takes away from the caramel flavor of the sauce. 

My changes:

I saute the asparagus for 2 minutes in the sugar and butter (and I added some minced garlic). Then I add about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to kind of deglaze the pan and help coat the asparagus. I cook the asparagus for about 2-3 more minutes. I remove the asparagus and cook the sauce to reduce about 5-7 more minutes. Then I pour the rest of the yummy, hot glaze over the veggies, squeeze some fresh lemon over top and serve :D

Wow! This was fantastic! I did however add fresh minced garlic, sliced potabellas and a dash of salt. My son ate a pound to himself! He said he never liked asparagus so much and that it tasted like "candy"! Huge hit! Will make this a regular at our home! Thanx! 8)

Definitely a delicious change to the way I normally cook asparagus.  I was a bit nervous at first because mine didn't look very good (looked brown and soggy), but it tasted good!  Next time I might reduce the sauce a little more so that it's not so soupy, but the flavour was quite good.

I fixed this with dinner when my brother and his girlfriend were visiting. Neither of them like asparagus very much, but they loved it this way. My husband and I have had it several times since then. I follow the recipe exactly as it is. Tastes wonderful!

I was trying to halve the recipe, but accidentally added a full cup of broth, so I didn't get the sauce, but this is very good.  The sugar mellows the asparagus, so I think even people who don't normally like asparagus would like it.  It is a nice change of pace from butter and garlic.

Excellent!  The ingredients work!  Next time, will cut back on the brown sugar.  Added a clove of minced garlic for a sweet & savory twist.  Great with Asparagus.  UPDATE:  Used this same recipe for Baby Bok Choy and it turned out GREAT!

I was pleasently suprised by this recipe.  I was a little hesitant about adding brown sugar to asparagus, but it was great! My only recommendation is that you really don't need much chicken stock.  I sauteed the asparagus in the butter/sugar mix for a while and then just added a little chicken stock, probably too much because it took a long time to cook down.  I like my asparagus crisp, so next time I will probably only add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the stock, and just cook for a couple minutes.

Per other reviews, used 1/4 cup chicken broth and 2 tbl fresh minced garlic and also cut down cooking time to maintain crispness. I really loved the flavor of the glaze but actually needed to add a bit of salt to the asparagus. When I began the reduction process, I tossed in chunks of cod with about a tsp of Old Bay seasoning. This was a terrific use of the remainder of the sugar mix and the fish came out fabulous. Highly recommend using the one recipe to cook both your veggie and your protein. :)

I enjoy the asparagus flavor so I wouldn't use this recipe again as the brown sugar masked the asparagus flavor. I thought the amount of chicken broth made the dish pretty soupy.  As written,there was just something missing for me and I felt it wouldn't make a good company presentation dish.

This was pretty good. I served it over some Basmati Rice and with Pollock Montreal which both complemented very well.

This was a hit! I always fix a Hollandaise sauce with asparagus, and this was fast and just as good.

Great flavor! It's pretty strong, so I recommend serving it with chicken, beef or pork.  I served it with fish, which seemed overpowering.  Good recipe though!

This is a top notch recipe! I made it according to the instructons and my family thought it was great, not at all too sweet or sticky.  I see the potential for adding other flavorings such as garlic,balsamic vinegar or soy sauce, however, it was excellent as is. 
I will definately make this again while asparagus are in season.

Wonderful! Everyone LOVED this at dinner last night, even my 10 year old nephew ate some! The sauce didn't thicken up because i used a CAN of broth instead of a cup...oops. But still had GREAT flavor. I can't wait to eat it again when made correctly. 
This recipe will definitely be bringing asparagus into my kitchen more! THANKS!

I combined this recipe with another one on this site (basically just butter and garlic, which was honestly, a wee bit BORING), but after adding the brown sugar and some Sesame Seeds...it was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! LUV the sweetness from the brown sugar (but FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC is DEFINITELY A MUST as well!)  Thank you for the idea to sweeten the Asparagus....DEFINITELY will be making again!  YUMMY!!

This was a huge dinner hit at my house. I wanted a different kind of asparagus to serve with a teriyaki chicken and this went well with it. This is a keeper.

Fantastic! I boiled the sauce longer and added balsamic and white wine. I used a big serving dish made mashed patatoes and roasted chicken with the asparagus and threw the sauce over the whole thing- got two glasses of wine and ate dinner with my hubbs in the living room off the same plate while watching a movie. Instant date night : )

I was very weary about the sugar/veggie mix but I am so glad I gave it a chance.  Such a great variation to balsamic vinegar or oil and seasonings.

This is really good!  My two year old ate it without being coerced to do so.  Next time I will also add garlic.  The cooking time is too long.  I will stick with 5 or so minutes.

This is my favorite way to make asparagus. I have actually converted a couple people who thought they didn't like asparagus into fans. It's also an easy way to get kids to eat it since it's sweet.

This recipe was very good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but cut the cooking time by half.  I like my asparagus to have a little crunch.

This was very tasty.  My daughter even tried it after I told her it tastes like candy! Very easy and different from the same old plan butter, salt and pepper I usually do.

This is way too sweet, and much too long to cook asparagus. It was a syrupy mushy mess- the ruination of a good vegetable
