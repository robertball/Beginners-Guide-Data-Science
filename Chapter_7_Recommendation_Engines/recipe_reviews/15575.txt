DID NOT SET!  I followed the directions to a "t", even thickening the custard more than recommended . . . I ended up with a nice crust, great meringue and coconut soup inside.  
I suspect that the recipe needs only 3 cups TOTAL of milk.  Using the suggested amount is too much for the amount of cornstarch, sugar and egg to handle.  Also, the filling is REALLY sweet.  I think it needs about half to three-quarters of the sugar.

I just tried this recipe for the first time.  I'm not sure whether it will set up or not.  One reason is the recipe call for one pie.  I had enough for two pies.  The pie is cooling now.  If it doesn't set up, I will let you know.
It look like a great recipe, and taste great.
Thanks, Joe Woodard

The only time I had a problem with this setting was when it was humid outside.  Cutting down on the sugar by half makes it less rich.

I had setting issues with this recipe also so I cut down the milk to a little more than 2 cups in the saucepan and 1 cup in the yolk mixture. I sold the pie to a restaurant and the customers loved it!!

Very tasty recipe, but did not set. I altered the recipe by cutting the sugar to 1.5 cups and used 1.5 cups of milk and 1.5 cups of coconut milk, therefore, cutting the liquid down to a total of 3 cups instead of four. There is still not enough cornstarch in the this recipe to make the pie set. I ended up with a delicious coconut cream soup instead of a pie with a custard filling.

This is similar to what I have done for years but instead of mile I use Half and Half.. My family begs me to make this several times a year.

Rainy outside when I had to make this for a birthday, so that may be why it didnâ€™t set completely.  I also had leftover filling.  It did taste good and luckily it was for family who care more about taste than looks.  The meringue did turn out nice.

Too much sugar, cut back to one cup.  For that amount of milk, need more cornstarch or cut back milk.

This is the second time I've used this recipe. The first time, I agree with others that the recipe called for too much milk and it didn't set. This time, I realized once I had my crust made and all my ingredients out (I made a quick graham cracker crust instead of using a traditional crust) that I didn't have any milk, so I substituted 2 cups of water for 2 cups milk for the custard and added extra cornstarch,  Starting with just a little and working up to about a tablespoon extra.  It doesn't appear to have affected the final consistency. With some tweaking this recipe is great. Coconut meringue is my husband's favorite and my get out of jail free card, and this recipe is easier than others I've used while still tasting like it took hours to make.
