This is very good! The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly. The bottom crust was very soggy so the next time, I baked the bottom layer for about 8 to 10 min. then assembled it. It was much better. I recommend it strongly. Also, really easy to make.

This is exceptional!  I have been making this for about 20 years, however, I lay out the rolls, press seams closed and cut diagonal strips on the edges about 1 to 1 1/2 inch I place my ingredients in the center and overlap strips to make a braid then brush with beaten egg.  Excellent presentation and I have served it all over the country with raving reviews.  Very impressive breakfast dish that looks like it takes a lot of time but is ready to eat in minutes.

For the low reviewers try this one again! I make a variation of this recipe and it's fabulous! I don't use the broccoli and I use a roll of garlic cheese (cubed) instead of the shredded Cheddar. It's to die for!

I was soo presently surprised how well the broccoli went with this dish. My just went to town on this it was excellent.I'm giving it a 5 star for taste flavor and simplicity. However the only negative thing was the center bottom was still doughy and not done. While the rest was done the top was brown I was disappointed on that but it's an excellent recipe.

I listened to other cooks and baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes before adding the broccoli mixture and I was so glad I did. It turned out perfect. I also used low fat sour cream reduced fat cheese and turkey breakfast sausage links that I chopped up and it was delicious. You would never have know the substitutions I made.

This was wonderful!!! My family loved it. Can't wait to make it agan. I did however bake the crescent roll dough that you put on the bottom of the baking dish first 10 min does nicely.

So delicious!  Thanks to those who recommended baking the bottom crust first.  I would add onion and maybe some bell pepper, but really, would not have changed anything.  It was perfect for our breakfast this morning!

We found this very tasty, at least, for us! This was so easy to put together. I did mix everything in the skillet, though, instead of dirtying a bowl. Worked out great! I also decided to make this into a braid which I enjoy making. Will do this one again! Thanks Clara for posting.

I thought this was delicious! I halved the recipe and it was perfect for three people as an entire meal. I didn't have brocolli but since someone else suggested it I put in onion and bell pepper instead. I also precooked the bottom piece about 4 minutes. YUM!

Like others I baked bottom crust about 5 minutes before adding filling and top layer! Turned out delicious and whole family enjoyed!
