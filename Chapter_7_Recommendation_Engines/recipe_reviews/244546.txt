I will make these again, but I will definitely dial back the cardamom, maybe just to one teaspoon.  It was way too strong for me and almost tasted like a mouthful of perfume.

Quite tasty... they have an earthy taste to them and are not overly sweet. If you are not a fan of cardamom... I am.. you might want to use a bit less
