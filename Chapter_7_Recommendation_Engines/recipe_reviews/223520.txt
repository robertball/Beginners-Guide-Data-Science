Just threw this together, and do not have time to let the flavors blend, but a really good Ceaser Salad Dressing, I live in Germany and have been trying for years to get the perfect dressing this is as close as I may ever get....

My kidlets and I love salad but they stayed clear of their portion. This dressing is the bare bones of Caesar dressing - minus the egg. I did add a coddled egg yolk in the remaining dressing after eating my portion. 3 stars as is and 4 stars with the egg. Next time I would make the recipe with 1/2 of the olive oil and continue on with the egg yolk.

Really flavorful but too oily.   I added in celery salt and a bit more lemon juice.    I also used Caesar croutons for the bread crumbs and ran everything through the blender.   Next time I will substitute in a milk and mayonnaise mixture for at least half of the oil.

Great dressing if you want to use every spice in the cabinet. I have made this several times and it is excellent, my guests all love it. Just kidding about all the ingredients, this dressing is very good.

This is a great recipe.  Exactly as written, do it that way.  Then for another salad push on of the core spices forward for a slightly different take.  This recipe is very versatile that way.

Great recipe! I made it gluten-free friendly by omitting the bread crumbs. I also added anchovies to give it more of the authentic caesar flair. Have tried for weeks to find a store-bought dressing that did not use soybean oil without success, hence my discovery of this recipe. Will keep and use again and again!

This is my go-to Caesar salad dressing, although I don't use anywhere close tot the recommended amount of olive oil suggested! I totally agree with the other comment that you wouldn't think that basil would work, but it really adds to the flavour!

This is really good, but you can't go into it thinking "Caesar" or you will be disappointed.  I was looking for Caesar and didn't really get it unless I ate a bite w/Caesar croutons and fresh parm.  However, that doesn't mean this isn't a nice dressing.  Four stars from me simply because it's quite oily.  If I make this again, I'll adjust the EVOO and vinegar to more equal amounts.  THANKS for the recipe, John G!

Didn't follow measurements, but used this as inspiration regarding ingredients. Thought fresh basil might be strange or overpowering but it really elavated the taste! Thx much!
