Everyone I make this pie for loves it! It is simple, real ingredients. I like that is doesn't have pudding and cream cheese and such in it. I add half chocolate chips with the peanut butter chips on the crust. I have also used mixed nuts crushed on top instead of all peanuts. Breaks up the all peanut flavor. I think raspberry chips might also be good - kind of like a pbj pie.

Excellent flavor, but pie was very hard to cut due to the melted peanut butter chips.

This pie was tasty, but it never set up in the middle. I baked it 15 minutes longer than the recipe said and it just never firmed up. I took it out of the oven because I was afraid the top would burn. I even refrigerated it after cooling and it never solidified. I will not make this again.

Very runny and very sweet, needs some kind of thickener like a couple tablespoons of cornstarch.

Good flavor. It was a nice change from the normal pudding and cream cheese peanut butter pies. I may have underbaked mine though because it was still pretty soft in the middle even after it completely cooled although I baked it 10 minutes longer than stated.

My family loved this, I used truvia for baking instead of the sugar, used 1/2 of the honey then put dark chocolate chips on the bottom of a homemade graham cracker crust.  Did not put the crushed peanuts on the top either. Unsure why so many had issues with this pie firming up, did fine for me!
