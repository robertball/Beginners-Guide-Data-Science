I decided to try this dip just as a prelude to the lasagna.  It was really good.  My cajun roots are prominent so I had to add a little bit of seasoning, just a pinch of red pepper, made it even better.  It's a very mild and interesting flavor.  I had it with crackers, Fritos Scoops, and everyone prferred the Scoops for the hint of salt.

This was really good. I had to use minced garlic in place of the onion. Very simple to make and delicious to taste.

I used FF cream cheese, organic almonds and low-fat mayonnaise. I also added 1 tsp. of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute. Off the charts yummy. I spread a few thin smears on cukes for me and spread it on bread with ham to make sandwiches for the kids. HUGE hit. This is SO a keeper. It really was off the charts yummy. NOTE: I bet this would be good with jarred artichoke hearts, too.

I really like this but it would not be for everybody.  It is bland.  I added finely chopped red onion and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to it and felt this helped it.

Followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't find a can of just asparagus tips but that didn't seem to matter because the recipe was still a hit at my party.

This was one of the few things I really craved when I was pregnant. It is sooo good! I made it with lots of red onion and fresh, steamed asparagus. I ate it on just about anything - crackers, celery sticks, toasted bagels, baked potatoes. Delicious! Thanks so much, kpaigel!

Sounded quite bland so I would use equal parts of cream cheese sour cream and mayo and I would also use a package of dry Knorr cream of leek soup and of course  the Asparagus omit the onion I made this and I cut out the center of a pumpernickle bread, hollowed it out the bread and and cubed the remains and used the bread as the bowl nice mild dip

For me this is a bit bland and 1 t of onion hardly seems worth the effort so I dumped in more. I wish I had added some fresh garlic. I'm going to have to spice mine up a bit. I'm also wondering what it would taste like baked a bit.

I'd give it 4 stars for being somewhat bland, but it gets 5 for a dip you don't have to dip veggies in to get your veggies.  Added a dash of S & P & cayenne, maybe next time add parmesan cheese?  Great idea for something different than the same old dips : )

I made this recipe. It was a hit with my sisters and our families. Being from Texas I added a jalapeno and a tsp of minced garlic. It was delicious. Definitely doing it again. Thanks.

I left out the mayo and instead used a little more cream cheese.  I also sauteed the onion and used white and green asparagus.  The green came from the can, but the white was tossed with EVOO and kosher salt, grilled (oh yeah), then chopped.  I used the hand-mixer to beat it all into a nice pulp.

I used fresh asparagus and boiled it for 7-8 minutes, finely minced red onion, salted and roasted almonds and added a bit of black pepper.  It was delicious!! I will definitely make again.

Really tasty!  Served with pita chips.  (Those at my gathering who liked asparagus loved this dip; those who didn't like asparagus didn't go for seconds....)
