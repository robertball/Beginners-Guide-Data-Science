I will give this five stars even though it calls for Cool Whip. ;) But if you want it to taste even better, skip the cool whip and do this: whip the cream cheese and sugar until fluffy, then slowly stream into the bowl (while still beating), 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. Continue to beat on medium/high for another minute or so or until soft peaks form. (don't overbeat!). Sooooo much better than with cool whip and really super simple to accomplish. This is a delicious, easy dessert that I am happy to make and serve my guests. I also use real blueberries and make a compote to pour over the cream cheese mixture, and I highly recommend this if you have the time. If not, the canned blueberry pie filling works well in this recipe.

I rated this 5 stars but only because I ditched the graham cracker crust. Instead, I mixed up some  flour, butter, pecans, and sugar dough, pressed into the pan,  baked it until brown, and cooled completely. The best!

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loved it.  
I did make it again and this time, I doubled the cream cheese filling and whipped topping mixture and then I added some fresh blueberries and a little Splenda to the blueberry pie filling and then put additional whipped topping on top.

Nope. Loved it just as it is.  Guests loved it too.  Might use cherry pie filling next time just to try it.
