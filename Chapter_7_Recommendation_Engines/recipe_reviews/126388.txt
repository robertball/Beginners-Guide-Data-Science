I liked the ease of this recipe. The ingredients are so easy and something I always have in the pantry. It was very filling and made alot. Some cheese on top would be good, but it was good without as well.

I've made this several times, we really enjoy it.  Tastes good and easy to make.  This time I added a can of corn.

This was ok and edible, but I probably won't make again.  I did change the recipe a little.  I added onions in with the ground meat and cooked them together.  I also added shredded cheese on the top of the potatoes the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.

Very easy and filling.  I had to substitute a can of dark kidney beans for the ranch style beans because I could not find anything like that locally.  But we love kidney beans anyways.  A dish of this and a glass of milk kept me full for hours and only one dirty skillet!

I had to add some water to bring it to a boil. Topped with some sour cream and a little salsa!

Very good flavor, but too dry. I would definitely make this again but add some broth.

I loved this. My grandpa used to make something like this when I was little without the beans and I think this might be even better or at least as good. I did add rings of onions to the meat and then corn towards the end and had to add some water too but it was still more like chili than soup which was fine by me. Will make again. Oh and I used red potatoes and it was still perfect.
