Pretty tasty, but extremely salty -- even the kids thought so.  (Though, in general, this was a great way to get my kids to *eat* fish!)  Will definitely try again, but will substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt, and maybe even decrease the proportion of Old Bay to corn meal.  The cayenne is a good idea, too.

My husband cut the catfish up like "nuggets" and  all 5 kids LOVED it!!  We also tried it with a dash of ground cayanne pepper, which my husband liked better.

WOW!  Good and tasty, crispy, not to spicy, a great fry-up!  I used garlic instead of garlic salt, and basa fillets instead of the standard catfish.  The saltiness was perfect without the added salt from the garlic salt.  Also, I never bother to let the excess egg drip off, I actually like to let whatever I am frying sit in the egg wash (is that what it's called??) a while, just to get nice and slimy.  I would reccomend this without hesitation.  Can't wait to try it on shrimp!

This was a good breading.  I might sprinkle the Old Bay seasonings directy on the fish next time since it uses so much and it's a little expensive since quite a bit of the breading gets thrown out.  This is also good because I like a little more then the kids do.  They think too much is a little bit too spicy.

Fast, easy and Delicious!  This was my first time with catfish. We don't fry much, but the catfish was so moist and flavorful the whole family loved it. We will definitly add this one to our "favorite" list.  Hurray for old bay!

I didn't like this. It was too salty and the corn meal was almost chewy. I am not sure how to fix it exactly - I certainly would eschew garlic salt in addition to the bay seasoning and maybe use minced garlic instead. And I might even cut the corn meal in half and substitute plain bread crumbs. Using cayenne pepper would have helped a lot. I made a spicy tartar sauce with this recipe and it was a nice compliment.

Never met a catfish I didn't like and this was no exception. Loved it just the way it was.

My husband's comment was, "It tastes like fish rolled in dirt". We did not care for this at all and don't plan on trying it again.

We enjoyed this recipe.  We also used garlic powder and some cayenne pepper to give it zip.  We substituted almond flour and Atkins bake mix for the cornmeal to make it a low carb dinner (half and half to equal 1/3 cup).  We should have made tartar sauce to go with it.  A definite keeper.  Thanks

I didn't have all the correct ingredients and used what I had on hand ... tilapia for catfish and bread crumbs for the cornmeal.  I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt (as suggested by a reviewer to cut the saltiness) and added a dash of ground (cayenne) red pepper (as suggested by reviewers).  I melted some cheese on top, placed on a slightly toasted bread with lettuce, tomato, bacon and tartar sauce ... and made a fish club.  It was easy and delicious!

Needs some tweaking, but pretty good. Next time we'll grind the cormeal to more of a flour & go less on the Old Bay.

Wonderful recipe!! Definitely a keeper. Extremely easy and quick to prepare and very tasty. We did have to cook our fish longer than stated in the recipe, though.

I don't stock garlic salt because of the lack of control on the amount of salt.  So I used garlic powder instead.  The recipe was salty as others have indicated.  Salt is already in the Old Bay Seasoning, so I decreased the seasoning a little.  Prefer to squeeze lemon juice on top prior to serving.  I grew up on fish and never cared for catfish until now.

Liked by my kids, especially oldest (6), but a bit dry for my younger ones (3).  I have made these smaller before, like nuggets and have had to use more oil to cook, these met with better success.
